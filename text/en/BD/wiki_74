<text>The sovereign is a British gold coin with a nominal value of one pound sterling (£1) and contains of pure gold. Struck since 1817, it was originally a circulating coin that was accepted in Britain and elsewhere in the world; it is now a bullion coin and is sometimes mounted in jewellery. In addition, circulation strikes and proof examples are often collected for their numismatic value. In most recent years, it has borne the design of Saint George and the Dragon on the reverse; the initials () of the designer, Benedetto Pistrucci, are visible to the right of the date.

The coin was named after the English gold sovereign, which was last minted about 1603, and originated as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816. Many in Parliament believed a one-pound coin should be issued rather than the 21-shilling guinea that was struck until that time. The Master of the Mint, William Wellesley Pole had Pistrucci design the new coin; his depiction was also used for other gold coins. Originally, the coin was unpopular because the public preferred the convenience of banknotes but paper currency of value £1 was soon limited by law. With that competition gone, the sovereign became a popular circulating coin, and was used in international trade and overseas, being trusted as a coin containing a known quantity of gold.

The British government promoted the use of the sovereign as an aid to international trade, and the Royal Mint took steps to see lightweight gold coins withdrawn from circulation. From the 1850s until 1932, the sovereign was also struck at colonial mints, initially in Australia and later in Canada, South Africa and India—they have again been struck in India for the local market since 2013, in addition to the production in Britain by the Royal Mint. The sovereigns issued in Australia initially carried a unique local design but by 1887, all new sovereigns bore Pistrucci&#x27;s George and Dragon design. Strikings there were so large that by 1900, about forty per cent of the sovereigns in Britain had been minted in Australia.

With the start of the First World War in 1914, the sovereign vanished from circulation in Britain; it was replaced by paper money and did not return after the war, though issues at colonial mints continued until 1932. While it faded out of usage in Britain, the sovereign was still used in the Middle East and demand rose in the 1950s, to which the Royal Mint eventually responded by striking new sovereigns in 1957. Since then, it has been struck both as a bullion coin and beginning in 1979 for collectors. Although the sovereign is no longer in circulation, it – along with the half sovereign, double sovereign and quintuple sovereign – is still legal tender in the United Kingdom, having survived the decimalisation of the pound in 1971.

== Background and authorisation ==
There had been an English coin known as the sovereign, first authorised by HenryVII in 1489. It had a diameter of , and weighed , twice the weight of the existing gold coin, the ryal. The new coin was struck in response to a large influx of gold into Europe from West Africa in the 1480s, and Henry at first called it the double ryal, but soon changed the name to sovereign. Too great in value to have any practical use in circulation, the original sovereign likely served as a presentation piece to be given to dignitaries.

The English sovereign, the country&#x27;s first coin to be valued at one pound, was struck by the monarchs of the 16th century, the size and fineness often being altered. James I, when he came to the English throne in 1603, issued a sovereign in the year of his accession, but the following year, soon after he proclaimed himself King of Great Britain, France and Ireland, he issued a proclamation for a new twenty-shilling piece. About ten per cent lighter than the final sovereigns, the new coin was called the unite, symbolising that James had merged the Scottish and English crowns.

In the 1660s, following the Restoration of Charles II and the mechanisation of the Royal Mint that quickly followed, a new twenty-shilling gold coin was issued. It had no special name at first but the public soon nicknamed it the guinea and this became the accepted term. Coins were at the time valued by their precious metal content, and the price of gold relative to silver rose soon after the guinea&#x27;s issuance. Thus, it came to trade at 21 shillings or even sixpence more. Popular in commerce, the coin&#x27;s value was set by the government at 21 shillings in silver in 1717, and was subject to revision downwards, though in practice this did not occur. The term sovereign, referring to a coin, fell from use—it does not appear in Samuel Johnson&#x27;s dictionary, compiled in the 1750s.
The British economy was disrupted by the Napoleonic Wars, and gold was hoarded. Among the measures taken to allow trade to continue was the issue of one-pound banknotes. The public came to like them as more convenient than the odd-value guinea. After the war, Parliament, by the Coinage Act 1816, placed Britain officially on the gold standard, with the pound to be defined as a given quantity of gold. Almost every speaker supported having a coin valued at twenty shillings, rather than continuing to use the guinea. Nevertheless, the Coinage Act did not specify which coins the Mint should strike. A committee of the Privy Council recommended gold coins of ten shillings, twenty shillings, two pounds and five pounds be issued, and this was accepted by George, Prince Regent on 3August 1816. The twenty-shilling piece was named a sovereign, with the resurrection of the old name possibly promoted by antiquarians with numismatic interests.

== Creation ==

William Wellesley Pole, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington, was appointed Master of the Mint (at that time a junior government position) in 1812, with a mandate to reform the Royal Mint. Pole had favoured retaining the guinea, due to the number extant and the amount of labour required to replace them with sovereigns. Formal instruction to the Mint came with an indenture dated February 1817, directing the Royal Mint to strike gold sovereigns. As one troy pound (12 troy ounces) of 22-karat gold used to be minted into 44 guineas worth 44.5*£1 = £46, each troy pound of 22K gold was henceforth minted into 46.725 sovereigns, with each coin weighing and containing fine gold.

The Italian sculptor Benedetto Pistrucci came to London early in 1816. His talent opened the doors of the capital&#x27;s elite, among them Lady Spencer, who showed Pistrucci a model in wax of Saint George and the Dragon by Nathaniel Marchant and commissioned him to reproduce it in the Greek style as part of her husband&#x27;s regalia as a Knight of the Garter. Pistrucci had already been thinking of such a work, and he produced the cameo. The model for the saint was an Italian waiter at Brunet&#x27;s Hotel in Leicester Square, where he had stayed after coming to London.

In 1816, Pole hired Pistrucci to create models for the new coinage. After completing Lady Spencer&#x27;s commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci suggested to Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign would be Saint George. He created a head, in jasper, of King George III, to be used as model for the sovereign and the smaller silver coins. He had prepared a model in wax of Saint George and the Dragon for use on the crown; this was adapted for the sovereign. The Royal Mint&#x27;s engravers were not able to successfully reproduce Pistrucci&#x27;s imagery in steel, and the sculptor undertook the engraving of the dies himself.

=== Pistrucci&#x27;s George and Dragon design ===

Pistrucci&#x27;s design for the reverse of the sovereign features Saint George on horseback. His left hand clutches the rein of the horse&#x27;s bridle, and he does not wear armour, other than on his lower legs and feet, with his toes bare. Further protection is provided by the helmet, with, on early issues, a streamer or plume of hair floating behind. Also flowing behind the knight is his chlamys, or cloak; it is fastened in front by a fibula. George&#x27;s right shoulder bears a balteus for suspending the gladius, the sword that he grasps in his right hand. He is otherwise naked—the art critic John Ruskin later considered it odd that the saint should be unclothed going into such a violent encounter. The saint&#x27;s horse appears to be half attacking, half shrinking from the dragon, which lies wounded by George&#x27;s spear and in the throes of death.
The original 1817 design had the saintly knight still carrying part of his broken spear. This was changed to a sword when the garter that originally surrounded the design was eliminated in 1821, and George is intended to have broken his spear earlier in the encounter with the dragon. Also removed in 1821 was the plume of hair, or streamer, behind George&#x27;s helmet; it was restored in 1887,
modified in 1893 and 1902, and eliminated in 2009.

The George and Dragon design is in the Neoclassical style. When Pistrucci created the coin, Neoclassicism was all the rage in London, and he may have been inspired by the Elgin Marbles, which were exhibited from 1807, and which he probably saw soon after his arrival in London. Pistrucci&#x27;s sovereign was unusual for a British coin of the 19th century in not having a heraldic design, but this was consistent with Pole&#x27;s desire to make the sovereign look as different from the guinea as possible.

== Circulation years (1817–1914) ==
=== Early years (1817–1837) ===

When the sovereign entered circulation in late 1817, it was not initially popular, as the public preferred the convenience of the banknotes the sovereign had been intended to replace. Lack of demand meant that mintages dropped from 2,347,230 in 1818 to 3,574 the following year. Another reason why few sovereigns were struck in 1819 was a proposal, eventually rejected, by economist David Ricardo to eliminate gold as a coinage metal, though making it available on demand from the Bank of England. Once this plan was abandoned in 1820, the Bank encouraged the circulation of gold sovereigns, but acceptance among the British public was slow. As difficulties over the exchange of wartime banknotes were overcome, the sovereign became more popular, and with low-value banknotes becoming scarcer, in 1826 Parliament prohibited the issuance of notes with a value of less than five pounds in England and Wales.

The early sovereigns were heavily exported; in 1819, Robert Peel estimated that of the some £5,000,000 in gold struck in France since the previous year, three-quarters of the gold used had come from the new British coinage, melted down. Many more sovereigns were exported to France in the 1820s as the metal alloyed with the gold included silver, which could be profitably recovered, with the gold often returned to Britain and struck again into sovereigns. Beginning in 1829, the Mint was able to eliminate the silver, but the drain on sovereigns from before then continued.

George III died in January 1820, succeeded by George, Prince Regent, as George IV. Mint officials decided to continue to use the late king&#x27;s head on coinage for the remainder of the year.
For King GeorgeIV&#x27;s coinage, Pistrucci modified the George and Dragon reverse, eliminating the surrounding Garter ribbon and motto, with a reeded border substituted. Pistrucci also modified the figure of the saint, placing a sword in his hand in place of the broken lance seen previously, eliminating the streamer from his helmet, and refining the look of the cloak.

The obverse design for GeorgeIV&#x27;s sovereigns featured a &quot;Laureate head&quot; of GeorgeIV, based on the bust Pistrucci had prepared for the Coronation medal. The new version was authorised by an Order in Council of 5May 1821. These were struck every year between 1821 and 1825, but the king was unhappy with the depiction of him and requested a new one be prepared, based on a more flattering bust by Francis Chantrey. Pistrucci refused to copy the work of another artist and was barred from further work on the coinage. Second Engraver (later Chief Engraver) William Wyon was assigned to translate Chantrey&#x27;s bust into a coin design, and the new sovereign came into use during 1825. It did not bear the George and Dragon design, as the new Master of the Mint, Thomas Wallace, disliked several of the current coinage designs, and had Jean Baptiste Merlen of the Royal Mint prepare new reverse designs. The new reverse for the sovereign featured the Ensigns Armorial, or royal arms of the United Kingdom, crowned, with the lions of England seen in two of the quarters, balanced by those of Scotland and the harp of Ireland. Set on the shield are the arms of Hanover, again crowned, depicting the armorial bearings of Brunswick, Lüneburg and Celle. The George and Dragon design would not again appear on the sovereign until 1871.

William IV&#x27;s accession in 1830 upon the death of his brother George IV led to new designs for the sovereign, with the new king&#x27;s depiction engraved by William Wyon based on a bust by Chantrey. Two slightly different busts were used, with what is usually called the &quot;first bust&quot; used for most 1831 circulating pieces (the first year of production) and some from 1832, with the &quot;second bust&quot; used for the prototype pattern coins that year, as well as for proof coins of 1831, some from 1832 and taking over entirely by 1833. The reverse shows another depiction by Merlen of the Ensigns Armorial, with the date accompanied by the Latin word &quot;Anno&quot;, or &quot;in the year&quot;. These were struck every year until the year of the king&#x27;s death, 1837.

=== Victorian era ===

The accession of Queen Victoria in 1837 ended the personal union between Britain and Hanover, as under the latter&#x27;s Salic Law, a woman could not take the Hanoverian throne. Thus, both sides of the sovereign had to be changed. Wyon designed his &quot;Young head&quot; portrait of the Queen, which he engraved, for the obverse, and Merlen engraved the reverse, depicting the royal arms inside a wreath, and likely played some part in designing it. The new coin was approved on 26 February 1838, and with the exception of 1840 and 1867, the &quot;shield back&quot; sovereign was struck at the Royal Mint in London every year from 1838 to 1874. Sovereigns struck in London with the shield design between 1863 and 1874 bear small numbers under the shield, representing which coinage die was used. Records of why the numbers were used are not known to survive, with one widely printed theory that they were used to track die wear. George Frederick Ansell states in his 1870 book &quot;The Royal Mint, Its Workings, Conduct, And Operations Fully And Practically Explained&quot; that &quot;the reverse die has been made to carry, in addition to its recognised device, a small number, with a view to determine at which coining press, and on what particular day, the numbered die was used, that bad work might be traced to an individual.&quot;

By 1850, some £94million in sovereigns and half sovereigns had been struck and circulated widely, well beyond Britain&#x27;s shores, a dispersion aided by the British government, who saw the sovereign&#x27;s use as an auxiliary to their imperialist ambitions. Gold is a soft metal, and the hazards of circulation tended to make sovereigns lightweight over time. In 1838, when the legacy of James Smithson was converted into gold in preparation for transmission to the United States, American authorities requested recently-struck sovereigns, likely to maximise the quantity of gold when the sovereigns were melted after arrival in the United States.

The weight of a newly-struck sovereign was intended to be 123.274 grains (7.98802 g). It ceased to be legal currency for £1 if found to weigh less than 122 grains (i.e. a deficiency of 1 pence in gold per sovereign). By the early 1840s, the Bank of England estimated that twenty per cent of the gold coins that came into its hands were lightweight. In part to boost the sovereign&#x27;s reputation in trade, the Bank undertook a programme of recoinage, melting lightweight gold coins and using the gold for new, full-weight ones. Between 1842 and 1845, the Bank withdrew and had recoined some £14million in lightweight gold, about one-third the amount of that metal in circulation. This not only kept the sovereign to standard, it probably removed most of the remaining guineas still in commerce. The unlucky holder of a lightweight gold coin could only turn it in as bullion, would lose at least 1 pence because of the lightness and often had to pay an equal amount to cover the Bank of England&#x27;s costs. There was also increased quality control within the Royal Mint; by 1866, every gold and silver coin was weighed individually. The result of these efforts was that the sovereign became, in Sir John Clapham&#x27;s later phrase, the &quot;chief coin of the world&quot;.

The California Gold Rush and other discoveries of the 1840s and 1850s boosted the amount of available gold and also the number of sovereigns struck, with £150million in sovereigns and half sovereigns coined between 1850 and 1875. The wear problem continued: it was estimated that, on average, a sovereign became lightweight after fifteen years in circulation. The Coinage Act 1870 tightened standards at the Royal Mint, requiring sovereigns to be individually tested at the annual Trial of the Pyx rather than in bulk. These standards resulted in a high rejection rate for newly coined sovereigns, though less than for the half sovereign, which sometimes exceeded 50 per cent. When the Royal Mint was rebuilt in 1882, a decisive factor in shutting down production for renovation rather than moving to a new mint elsewhere was the Bank of England&#x27;s report that there was an abnormally large stock of sovereigns and that no harm would result if they could not be coined in London for a year. Advances in technology allowed sovereigns to be individually weighed by automated machines at the Bank of England by the 1890s, and efforts to keep the coin at full weight were aided by an 1889 Act of Parliament which allowed redemption of lightweight gold coin at full face value, with the loss from wear to fall upon the government. The Coinage Act 1889 also authorised the Bank of England to redeem worn gold coins from before Victoria&#x27;s reign, but on 22 November 1890 all gold coins from before her reign were called in by Royal Proclamation and demonetised effective 28 February 1891. Owing to an ongoing programme to melt and recoin lightweight pieces, estimates of sovereigns in trade weighing less than the legal minimum had fallen to about four per cent by 1900.
The sovereign was seen in fiction: in Dickens&#x27; &quot;Oliver Twist&quot;, Mrs Bumble is paid £25 in sovereigns for her information. Joseph Conrad, in his novels set in Latin America, refers several times to ship&#x27;s captains keeping sovereigns as a ready store of value. Although many sovereigns were melted down for recoining on reaching a foreign land (as were those for the Smithsonian) it was regarded as a circulating coin in dozens of British colonies and even in nations such as Brazil and Portugal; the latter accepted it at a value of 4,500 &quot;reis&quot;.

In 1871, the Deputy Master of the Mint, Charles William Fremantle, restored the Pistrucci George and Dragon design to the sovereign, as part of a drive to beautify the coinage. The return of Saint George was approved by the Queen, and authorised by an Order in Council dated 14 January 1871. The two designs were struck side by side in London from 1871 to 1874, and at the Australian branch mints until 1887, after which the Pistrucci design alone was used. The saint returned to the rarely-struck two- and five-pound pieces in 1887, and was placed on the half sovereign in 1893. Wyon&#x27;s &quot;Young head&quot; of Queen Victoria for the sovereign&#x27;s obverse was struck from 1838 until 1887, when it was replaced by the &quot;Jubilee head&quot; by Joseph Boehm. That obverse was criticised and was replaced in 1893 by the &quot;Old head&quot; by Thomas Brock. Victoria&#x27;s death in 1901 led to a new obverse for her son and successor, Edward VII by George William de Saulles, which began production in 1902; Edward&#x27;s death in 1910 necessitated a new obverse for his son, George V by Bertram Mackennal. Pistrucci&#x27;s George and Dragon design continued on the reverse.

== Branch mint coinage ==

The 1851 discovery of gold in Australia quickly led to calls from the local populace for the establishment of a branch of the Royal Mint in the colonies there. Authorities in Adelaide did not wait for London to act, but set up an assay office, striking what became known as the &quot;Adelaide Pound&quot;. In 1853, an Order in Council approved the establishment of the Sydney Mint; the Melbourne Mint would follow in 1872, and the Perth Mint in 1899. The act which regulated currency in New South Wales came into force on 18 July 1855 and stipulated that the gold coins were to be called sovereigns and half sovereigns. They were also to be the same weight, fineness and value as other sovereigns.
Early issues for Sydney, until 1870, depicted a bust of Victoria similar to those struck in Britain, but with a wreath of banksia, native to Australia, in her hair. The reverse was distinctive as well, with the name of the mint, the word and the denomination on the reverse. These coins were not initially legal tender outside Australia, as there were concerns about the design and about the light colour of the gold used (due to a higher percentage of silver in the alloy) but from 1866 Australian sovereigns were legal tender alongside those struck in London. Beginning in 1870, the designs were those used in London, though with a mint mark &quot;S&quot; or &quot;M&quot; (or, later, &quot;P&quot;) denoting their origin. The mints at Melbourne and Sydney were allowed to continue striking the shield design even though it had been abandoned at the London facility, and did so until 1887 due to local popularity. The large issues of the colonial mints meant that by 1900, about forty per cent of the sovereigns circulating in Britain were from Australia. Dies for the Australian coinage were made at London.
Following the Klondike Gold Rush, the Canadian Government asked for the establishment of a Royal Mint branch in Canada. It was not until 1908 that what is now the Royal Canadian Mint, in Ottawa, opened, and it struck sovereigns with the mint mark &quot;C&quot; from 1908 to 1919, except 1912 and 1915, each year in small numbers. Branch mints at Bombay (1918; mint mark &quot;I&quot;) and Pretoria (1923–1932; mint mark &quot;SA&quot;) also struck sovereigns. Melbourne and Perth stopped striking sovereigns after 1931, with Sydney having closed in 1926. The 1932 sovereigns struck at Pretoria were the last to be issued intended as currency at their face value.

To address the high demand for gold coins in the Indian market, which does not allow gold coins to be imported, the minting of gold sovereigns in India with mint mark I has resumed since 2013. Indian/Swiss joint venture company MMTC-PAMP mints under licence in its facility close to Delhi with full quality control from the Royal Mint. The coins are legal tender in the United Kingdom.

== Trade coin (1914–1979) ==

In the late 19th century, several Chancellors of the Exchequer had questioned the wisdom of having much of Britain&#x27;s stock of gold used in coinage. Lord Randolph Churchill proposed relying less on gold coinage and moving to high-value silver coins, and the short-lived double florin or four-shilling piece is a legacy of his views. Churchill&#x27;s successor, George Goschen, urged issuing banknotes to replace the gold coins, saying he preferred £20million in gold in the Bank of England to thirty million sovereigns in the hands of the public. Fears that widespread forgery of banknotes would shake confidence in the pound ended his proposal.

In March 1914, John Maynard Keynes noted that the large quantities of gold arriving from South Africa were making the sovereign even more important. &quot;The combination of the demand for sovereigns in India and Egypt with London&#x27;s situation as the distributing centre of the South African gold is rapidly establishing the sovereign as the predominant gold coin of the world. Possibly it may be destined to hold in the future the same kind of international position as was held for several centuries, in the days of a silver standard, by the Mexican dollar.&quot;

As Britain moved towards war in the July Crisis of 1914, many sought to convert Bank of England notes into gold, and the bank&#x27;s reserves of the metal fell from £27million on 29 July to £11million on 1August. Following the declaration of war against Germany on 4August, the government circulated one-pound and ten-shilling banknotes in place of the sovereign and half sovereign. Restrictions were placed on sending gold abroad, and the melting-down of coin made an offence. Not all were enthusiastic about the change from gold to paper: J.J. Cullimore Allen, in his 1965 book on sovereigns, recalled meeting his first payroll after the change to banknotes, with the workers dubious about the banknotes and initially asking to be paid in gold. Allen converted five sovereigns from his own pocket into notes, and the workers made no further objection. Conversion into gold was not forbidden, but the Chancellor, David Lloyd George, made it clear that such actions would be unpatriotic and would harm the war effort. Few insisted on payment in gold in the face of such appeals, and by mid-1915, the sovereign was rarely seen in London commerce. The coin was depicted on propaganda posters, which urged support for the war.

Although sovereigns continued to be struck at London until the end of 1917, they were mostly held as part of the nation&#x27;s gold reserves, or were paid out for war debts to the United States. They were still used as currency in some foreign countries, especially in the Middle East. Sovereigns continued to be struck at the Australian mints, where different economic circumstances prevailed. After the war, the sovereign did not return to commerce in Britain, with the pieces usually worth more as gold than as currency. In 1925, the Chancellor, Winston Churchill, secured the passage of the Gold Standard Act 1925, restoring Britain to that standard, but with gold to be kept in reserve rather than as a means of circulation. The effort failed—Churchill regarded it as the worst mistake of his life—but some lightweight sovereigns were melted and restruck dated 1925, and were released only later. Many of the Australian pieces struck in the postwar period were to back currency, while the South African sovereigns were mostly for export and to pay workers at the gold mines.

By the time Edward VIII came to the throne in 1936, there was no question of issuing sovereigns for circulation, but pieces were prepared as part of the traditional proof set of coins issued in the coronation year. With a bust of King Edward by Humphrey Paget and the date 1937, these sovereigns were not authorised by royal proclamation prior to Edward VIII&#x27;s abdication in December 1936, and are considered pattern coins. Extremely rare, one sold in 2020 for £1,000,000, setting what was then a record (since broken) for a British coin. Sovereigns in proof condition dated 1937 were struck for Edward&#x27;s brother and successor, George VI, also designed by Paget, the only sovereigns to bear George&#x27;s effigy. The 1925-dated GeorgeV sovereign was restruck in 1949, 1951 and 1952, lowering the value of the original, of which only a few had hitherto been known. These were struck to meet the need for sovereigns, and to maintain the skills of the Royal Mint in striking them.

The sovereign remained popular as a trade coin in the Middle East and elsewhere following the Second World War. The small strikings of 1925-dated sovereigns in the postwar period were not enough to meet the demand, which was met in part by counterfeiters in Europe and the Middle East, who often put full value of gold in the pieces. A counterfeiting prosecution was brought, to which the defence was made that the sovereign was no longer a current coin. The judge directed an acquittal although the sovereign remained legal tender under the Coinage Act 1870.

Sovereigns were struck in 1953, the coronation year of Elizabeth II, bearing the portrait of her by Mary Gillick, though the gold pieces were placed only in the major museums. A 1953 sovereign sold at auction in 2014 for £384,000. In 1957, the Treasury decided to defend the status of the sovereign, both by continuing prosecutions and by issuing new pieces with the current date. ElizabethII sovereigns bearing Gillick&#x27;s portrait were struck as bullion pieces between 1957 and 1959, and from 1962 to 1968. The counterfeiting problem was minimised by the striking of about 45,000,000 sovereigns by 1968, and efforts by Treasury solicitors which resulted in the sovereign&#x27;s acceptance as legal tender by the highest courts of several European nations. In 1966, the Wilson government placed restrictions on the holding of gold coins to prevent hoarding against inflation, with collectors required to obtain a licence from the Bank of England. This proved ineffective, as it drove gold dealing underground, and was abandoned in 1970.

The sovereign&#x27;s role in popular culture continued: in the 1957 novel &quot;From Russia, with Love&quot;, Q issues James Bond with a briefcase, the handle of which contains 50 sovereigns. When held at gunpoint on the Orient Express by Red Grant, Bond uses the gold to distract Grant, leading to the villain&#x27;s undoing. The sovereign survived both decimalisation and the Royal Mint&#x27;s move from London to Llantrisant, Wales. The last of the Gillick sovereigns had been struck in 1968; when production resumed in 1974, it was with a portrait by Arnold Machin. The last coin minted at Tower Hill, in 1975, was a sovereign.

== Bullion and collectors coin (1979–present) ==

From 1979, the sovereign was issued as a coin for the bullion market, but was also struck by the Royal Mint in proof condition for collectors, and this issuance of proof coins has continued annually. In 1985, the Machin portrait of Elizabeth was replaced by one by Raphael Maklouf. Striking of bullion sovereigns had been suspended after 1982, and so the Maklouf portrait, struck every year but 1989 until the end of 1997, is seen on the sovereign only in proof condition. In 1989, a commemorative sovereign, the first, was issued for the 500th anniversary of HenryVII&#x27;s sovereign. The coin, designed by Bernard Sindall, evokes the designs of that earlier piece, showing Elizabeth enthroned and facing front, as Henry appeared on the old English sovereign. The reverse of the 1489 piece depicts a double Tudor rose fronted by the royal arms; a similar design with updated arms graces the reverse of the 1989 sovereign.
Ian Rank-Broadley designed the fourth bust of Elizabeth to be used on the sovereign, and this went into use in 1998 and was used until 2015. Bullion sovereigns began to be issued again in 2000, and this has continued. A special reverse design was used in 2002 for the Golden Jubilee, with an adaptation of the royal arms on a shield by Timothy Noad recalling the 19th-century &quot;shield back&quot; sovereigns. The years 2005 and 2012 (the latter, Elizabeth&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee) saw interpretations of the George and Dragon design, the first by Noad, the later by Paul Day. Day&#x27;s design was used for the first strike-on-the-day sovereign which commemorated the jubilee. In 2009, the reverse was re-engraved using tools from the reign of GeorgeIII in the hope of better capturing Pistrucci&#x27;s design. A new portrait of the Queen by Jody Clark was introduced during 2015, and some sovereigns were issued with the new bust. The most recent special designs, in 2016 and 2017, were only for collectors. The 2016 collector&#x27;s piece, for Elizabeth&#x27;s 90th birthday, has a one-year-only portrait of her on the obverse designed by James Butler. The 2017 collector&#x27;s piece returned to Pistrucci&#x27;s original design of 1817 for the modern sovereign&#x27;s 200th birthday, with the Garter belt and motto. A piedfort was also minted, and the bullion sovereign struck at Llantrisant, though retaining the customary design, was given a privy mark with the number 200. For 2022, a reverse design by Noad in honour of Elizabeth&#x27;s Platinum Jubilee, depicting his interpretation of the Royal Coat of Arms was used.

Following the death of Elizabeth II in September 2022, the Royal Mint announced the issue of sovereigns showing the new king, Charles III, on the obverse, and with a depiction of the Royal Arms by Clark, chosen in memory of Elizabeth and her long reign. When they began accepting orders on 15 November, there was such demand that visitors to the Mint&#x27;s website were placed in virtual queues. For the Coronation of Charles III in May 2023, the Royal Mint issued sovereigns showing a crowned bust of the king, with the Pistrucci reverse. Both the crowned bust and the uncrowned one first issued in 2022 were designed by Martin Jennings. For 2024, Jennings&#x27; uncrowned portrait of Charles was paired with Pistrucci&#x27;s reverse on each of the five sovereign denominations struck in proof, from the quarter sovereign to the five-pound piece.
In 2024, the Royal Mint announced that sovereigns minted from 2026 onwards would return to the traditional yellow crown gold colour, a departure from the current alloy, which resembles rose gold due to its higher quantities of copper. Some 2025 sovereigns bear Pistrucci&#x27;s reverse, others bear Merlen&#x27;s Royal Arms reverse, first issued 200 years previously. A silver variant of the sovereign was also announced, to be issued in November 2024; this coin is minted to the same size and weight as the gold sovereign.

=== Collecting, other use and tax treatment ===

Many of the variant designs of the sovereign since 1989 have been intended to appeal to coin collectors, as have the other gold coins based on the sovereign, from the quarter sovereign to the five-sovereign piece. To expedite matters, the Royal Mint is authorised to sell gold sovereigns directly to the public, rather than having its output channelled through the Bank of England as was once the case. As a legal tender coin, the sovereign is exempt from capital gains tax for UK residents.

As well as being used as a circulating coin, the sovereign has entered fashion: some men in the 19th century placed one on their pocket watch chains (seen as a sign of integrity), and others carried them in a small purse linked to the chain. These customs vanished with the popularisation of the wrist watch. Women also have worn sovereigns, as bangles or ear rings. In the 21st century, the wearing of a sovereign ring has been seen as a sign of chav culture.

The staff carried by the Gentleman or Lady Usher of the Black Rod (known as Black Rod) as a symbol of office, and used to strike the door of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom during the State Opening of Parliament, has a sovereign inset into one of its ends.

Coin auction houses deal in rare sovereigns of earlier date, as do specialist dealers. As well as the 1937 EdwardVIII and 1953 ElizabethII sovereigns, rare dates in the series include the 1819, and the 1863 piece with the number &quot;827&quot; on the obverse in place of William Wyon&#x27;s initials. The 827 likely is an ingot number, used for some sort of experiment, though research has not conclusively established this. Few 1879 sovereigns were struck at London, and those that remain are often well-worn. Only 24,768 of the Adelaide Pound were struck; surviving specimens are rare and highly prized. The sovereign itself has been the subject of commemoration; in 2005, the Perth Mint issued a gold coin with face value A$25, reproducing the reverse design of the pre-1871 Sydney Mint sovereigns.

== Strike-on-the-Day ==

Strike-on-the-day pieces are limited edition coins, mostly sovereigns, that were struck by the Royal Mint on the specific day of the occasion celebrated. The coins are issued in a brilliant uncirculated condition or matte finish. Strike-on-the-day sovereigns are often minted with a plain edge, differentiating them from other, milled-edge sovereigns.

<text>Cape Town International Airport is the primary international airport serving the city of Cape Town, and is the second-busiest airport in South Africa and fourth-busiest in Africa.

Located approximately from the city center, the airport was opened in 1954 to replace Cape Town&#x27;s previous airport, Wingfield Aerodrome. Cape Town International Airport is the only airport in the Cape Town metropolitan area that offers scheduled passenger services. The airport has domestic and international terminals, linked by a common central terminal.

The airport has direct flights from South Africa&#x27;s other two main urban areas, Johannesburg and Durban, as well as flights to smaller centers in South Africa. Internationally, it has direct flights to several destinations in Africa, and locations in the Middle East, Asia, Europe, South America, Australia, and the United States.

The air route between Cape Town and Johannesburg was the world&#x27;s ninth-busiest air route in 2011 with an estimated 4.5 million passengers.

==History==
D. F. Malan Airport was opened in 1954, a year after Jan Smuts Airport (now O. R. Tambo International Airport) on the Witwatersrand, near Johannesburg, opened. The airport replaced Cape Town&#x27;s previous airport, Wingfield Aerodrome. Originally named Bellville Airport due to its proximity to the town of the same name, it initially served as a domestic airport. Then, at the request of the Bellville Federation of Taxpayers, the airport was renamed after the then South African prime minister. D.F. Malan National Airport soon achieved international airport status when a direct flight to Britain and a second flight to Britain via Johannesburg was introduced.

With the fall of apartheid in the early 1990s, ownership of the airport was transferred from the state to the newly formed Airports Company South Africa, and the airport was renamed to the politically neutral Cape Town International Airport. South African Airways launched a route to Miami in December 1992. In January 2000, the carrier replaced it with a flight to Atlanta, whose outbound leg from Cape Town included a stop in Fort Lauderdale.

The first years of the twenty-first century saw tremendous growth at the airport; from handling 6.2 million passengers per annum in 2004–05, the airport peaked at 8.4 million passengers per annum in 2007–08 before falling back to 7.8 million in 2008–09. In June 2008, Delta Air Lines started a flight to New York via Dakar. It used a Boeing 767 on the route. Delta began flying to Atlanta instead the following June. The company terminated the route in September 2009. In December 2011, Malaysia Airlines discontinued its service to Buenos Aires.

In 2016, the airport saw a 29% increase in international arrivals; 2016 also saw the airport handle 10 million passengers per annum. United Airlines commenced seasonal flights to Newark on a Boeing 787 in December 2019. The route became year-round in 2022. In October 2023, South African Airways inaugurated a link to São Paulo.

===Name change===
On 16 April 2018, it was reported in the Cape Times that the Minister of Transport, Bonginkosi Nzimande, had directed ACSA on 22 March 2018 to change the name of Cape Town International Airport to Nelson Mandela International Airport. The name change was discussed and as yet no name change had been published in the Government Gazette.

On 5 March 2019, the EFF filed a motion in Parliament calling for Cape Town International Airport to be renamed for anti-apartheid activist Winnie Madikizela-Mandela. Some Khoi activists, meanwhile, argued for the airport to be named after the !Uriǁ&#x27;aeǀona translator Krotoa. However, South Africa&#x27;s Parliament was not constitutionally empowered to enact name changes: the South African Geographical Names Council (SAGNC) held that responsibility. The motion was unsuccessful.

In February 2021, the Cape Times reported that the proposed name change of the airport had been &quot;quietly ditched&quot;.

==Developments==


In preparation for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, Cape Town International Airport was extensively expanded and renovated. The main focus was the development of a Central Terminal Building at a cost of R1.6 billion, which linked the formerly separate domestic and international terminals and provided a common check-in area. The departures level of the Central Terminal opened in November 2009, with the entire building opened in April 2010.

Apart from the now-completed 2010 expansion project, it had been proposed that a second runway for large aircraft be constructed at the airport, to be completed by 2015. However, this second runway has not been constructed. In May 2015, Airports Company South Africa announced a R7.7 billion expansion for the airport. The expansion includes the upgrades of the Domestic &amp; International terminals. The expansion has been postponed indefinitely due to the drop in passenger numbers due to the global COVID-19 pandemic from 2020.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===
The airport has two terminals linked together by one central terminal.

====Central Terminal====
The terminal building has a split-level design, with departures located on the upper floors and arrivals in the lower floors; an elevated roadway system provides vehicular access to both departures and arrivals levels. All check-in takes place within the Central Terminal Building, which contains 120 check-in desks and 20 self-service kiosks.

Passengers then pass through a consolidated security screening area before dividing. Passengers flying internationally head to the northern part of the airport which is the international terminal, and passengers flying to other parts of South Africa head to the southern part of the airport to the domestic terminal.

The terminal has 10 air bridges, evenly split between domestic and international usage. Sections of lower levels of the domestic and international terminals are used for transporting passengers via bus to and from remotely parked aircraft.

Arriving passengers collect luggage in the old sections of their respective terminals, before proceeding through new passageways to the new Central Terminal Building. The terminal contains an automated baggage handling system, capable of handling 30,000 bags per hour.

Retail outlets are located on the lower (arrivals) level of the terminal at landside, as well as airside at the departure gates. Retail outlets are diverse, including foreign exchange services, bookstores, clothing retailers, grocery stores, souvenir outlets and duty-free in international departures.

Restaurants within the terminal building are located on the upper (3rd) level above the departures level, and include Ocean Basket, Mugg &amp; Bean, Primi Cafe, Wimpy, and what is purported to be the largest Spur restaurant on the African continent, at .

The restaurant level overlooks the airside of the terminal, where a glass curtain wall separates the patrons from the planes three stories below. On the 4th floor is where the airport&#x27;s lounges are situated. The Bidvest, as well as South African Airways lounges, can be found there, as well as a Woolworths Food store.

====International Terminal====

The international terminal is located on the northern side of the airport. Customs and Immigration facilities, lounges, duty-free shops, restaurants, prayer rooms, conference rooms, airline offices, and chapels are located in the terminal.

====Domestic Terminal====
Located on the southern side of the airport, it has the same facilities as the international terminal, with the exception of Immigration facilities.

===Other facilities===
There are two hotels located within the airport precinct: Hotel Verde, a four-star hotel owned by Bon Hotels and ranked as &quot;Africa&#x27;s greenest hotel&quot;, and the other being Road Lodge, a budget hotel owned by the City Lodge hotel chain group. An ExecuJet facility is located near the southern end of the main runway and caters for business jets.

<doc id="266327" wikidata="Q44856" url="?curid=266327" title="Taoyuan International Airport">
<text>Taipei-Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport — also referred to as Taipei-Taoyuan International Airport — is an international airport situated in Taoyuan City that serves northern Taiwan, including the capital city Taipei. Located in Dayuan District, Taoyuan, about west of Taipei, the airport is the busiest and largest in Taiwan. In 2016, it was ranked the best airport for its size in the Asia-Pacific region by Airports Council International.

The airport opened for commercial operations in 1979 as Chiang Kai-shek International Airport () and was renamed in 2006. It is an important regional transshipment center, passenger hub, and gateway for destinations in Asia, and is one of two international airports that serve Taipei. The other, Taipei Songshan Airport, is located within the city limits and served as Taipei&#x27;s only international airport until 1979. Songshan now mainly serves chartered flights, intra-island flights, and limited international flights.

In 2018, Taoyuan International Airport handled a record 46.5 million passengers and 2.3 billion kg (2½ million tons) of freight, making it the 11th busiest airport worldwide by international passenger traffic, and 8th busiest in terms of international freight traffic in 2018. It is the main international hub for China Airlines, EVA Air and Starlux Airlines. It is also a hub of Mandarin Airlines, Uni Air and Tigerair Taiwan.

==History==
In the 1970s, the original airport in Taipei City — Taipei Songshan Airport — had become overcrowded and could not be expanded due to space limitations. Thus, a new airport was planned to alleviate congestion. The new airport opened (with Terminal 1) on 26 February 1979, as part of the Ten Major Construction Projects pursued by the government in the 1970s. The airport was originally planned under the name Taoyuan International Airport but was later changed to Chiang Kai-shek International Airport in memory of former President Chiang Kai-shek.

The airport is the main hub of China Airlines, the Republic of China (Taiwan)&#x27;s flag carrier, as well as EVA Air, a private airline established in 1989. Overcrowding of the airport in recent years prompted the construction of Terminal 2, which was opened on 29 July 2000, with half of its gates operational; EVA Air was the first airline to move into Terminal 2. The remaining gates opened on 21 January 2005 for China Airlines, making China Airlines the only airline to operate from both terminals.

The airport has announced construction plans for a third terminal. In October 2015, the design of British firm Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners, founded by Pritzker Architecture Prize-laureate Richard Rogers, was chosen for the Terminal 3. Over US$2.3 billion will be poured into the project, among the most costly constructions in modern Taiwanese history. The terminal is expected to be opened in 2026 and accommodate 45 million passengers per year, boosting the yearly capacity of the airport to 86 million passengers.

Formerly known as Chiang Kai-shek International Airport, it was renamed on 6 September 2006 to its current name.
The airport, originally planned as Taoyuan International Airport, bore the name of late President Chiang Kai-shek until 2006. In Chinese, its former name was literally &quot;Chung-Cheng (Zhongzheng) International Airport&quot;, where Chung-Cheng is the legal given name that Chiang Kai-shek had used since the 1910s. In Taiwan, Chiang Kai-shek is associated with the Chinese Nationalist Party or Kuomintang and its many years of one-party authoritarian rule. Local officials in Taoyuan City and members of the Pan-Green Coalition often referred to the hub by the name originally associated with it: &quot;Taoyuan International Airport&quot;. News organizations and local residents sometimes combined the two commonly used names as &quot;Taoyuan Chung-Cheng Airport&quot;.

The Executive Yuan of then-President Chen Shui-bian&#x27;s administration officially approved the name &quot;Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport&quot; for the hub on 6 September 2006. The opposition Kuomintang, which together with its political allies held a one-vote majority in the Legislative Yuan, decried the change and proposed &quot;Taiwan Taoyuan Chiang Kai-shek International Airport&quot; instead. The disagreement, like those affecting the names of the Chiang Kai-shek Memorial Hall and other landmarks in Taiwan, stands as another manifestation of the Taiwan localization efforts by pan-Green officials and resistance against it by Pan-Blue Coalition. The media in mainland China has always referred to the airport as &quot;Taoyuan International Airport&quot; so as to avoid mentioning Chiang Kai-shek.

==Terminals==
Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport currently has two terminals, which are connected by two short people movers. The third terminal is under construction, while the fourth terminal is planned, however plans may be halted. The Taoyuan Airport MRT links the terminals together underground, and provides transportation to Taipei City.

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 is the original passenger terminal of the Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport. The building was designed by Chinese-born, Taiwanese-American structural engineer Tung-Yen Lin and influenced by Eero Saarinen&#x27;s Washington Dulles International Airport. The five-storey, terminal, along with the airport, opened in 1979 to relieve the overcrowded Taipei Songshan Airport. All international flights were moved to the airport following the completion of this terminal. Terminal 1 featured 22 gates. A row of 11 gates are located on the north end of the airfield facing the north runway and another row of 11 gates are located on the south end airfield facing the south runway. The two concourses that contained the airplane gates are linked together by a main building that contained the check-in areas, baggage claim, passport immigration areas, and security checkpoint areas. Together, they form a giant &quot;H&quot;. All gates are equipped with jetways. Gates located at the end of the concourses have one jetway and also reducing people and gates not located at the end of the concourses have two jetways. The terminal was originally white in color when it first opened. As the years gradually passed, the façade and color became more tan and yellow colored due to age, while also helped by the air pollution in Taipei.

After the completion of Terminal 2, some gates from Terminal 1 were removed to make space for Terminal 2. Currently, Terminal 1 has 18 gates. Alphabetical letters were introduced when Terminal 2 was completed. The North Concourse is now Concourse A, and the South Concourse is now Concourse B. Before Terminal 2, gates were numbered from 1 to 22. China Airlines uses Concourse A for the majority of its flights in Terminal 1, while the third largest carrier of the airport, Cathay Pacific, operates most of its flights at Concourse B.

In 2012, the renovation project of the terminal, designed by Japanese architect Norihiko Dan, was completed, doubling the floor area, expanding check-in counters, increasing shopping areas and expanding car-parking facilities. Part of the project was the complete redesigning of both the exterior and interior of the terminal. The capacity of Terminal 1 is 15 million passengers per year. This renovation received the 2014 Taiwan Architecture Award from the Taiwan Architects Association.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2 opened in 2000 to reduce heavy congestion in the aging Terminal 1. Only the South Concourse had been completed by the time the terminal opened. The South Concourse alone has 10 gates, each with 2 jetways and their own security checkpoints. The North Concourse opened later in 2005, bringing the total number of gates for Terminal 2 to 20 gates; the security checkpoints were moved to a central location in front of the passport control. The 318,000-m2 facility is capable of handling 17 million passengers per year.

The Southern and Northern Concourses are also known as Concourse C and Concourse D, respectively. Terminals 1 and 2 are connected by two short people mover lines, with one from Concourse A to D and the other from B to C. China Airlines uses Concourse D for the majority of its flights in Terminal 2 while EVA Air uses Concourse C for most of its operations.

A renovation planned to increase the terminal&#x27;s annual passenger capacity by 5 million to 22 million per annum was announced in 2018.. Terminal 2 renovation was completed in 2020.

===Terminal 3 (under construction)===

Construction of Terminal 3 is part of the expansion project of Taoyuan International Airport. The 540,000 square meter Terminal 3 is designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners and will accommodate 45 million passengers per year. The new terminal was originally planned to be opened in 2020. However, the project has been delayed, which postpones its targeted completion to 2026. South Korea&#x27;s Samsung C&amp;T owns 70% of the construction project, or $1.1 billion, while the remainder is held by Taiwan&#x27;s RSEA Engineering.

===Terminal 4 (plans halted)===
Originally part of the expansion project was a new Terminal 4. However, due to the vast amount of construction, the Ministry of Transportation ordered the airport company to halt the project in order to minimize traveller inconvenience.

==Airport facilities==
===Operations===
The airport is operated by the Taoyuan International Airport Corporation, a company wholly owned by the Government of Taiwan. The Civil Aeronautics Administration (CAA) is responsible for the provision of air traffic control services, certification of Taiwan registered aircraft, and the regulation of general civil aviation activities.

The airport has two parallel runways, with one 3660 meters in length and another 3800 meters in length and both 60 meters wide, enabling them to cater to the next generation of aircraft. Both runways have been given a Category II Precision Approach, which allows pilots to land in only 350-metre visibility. The two runways have an ultimate capacity of over 60 aircraft movements an hour.

There are 41 frontal stands at the main passenger concourse, 15 remote stands and 25 cargo stands. In 2015, the airport was the 11th busiest airport worldwide in terms of international passenger numbers, and sixth busiest in terms of international freight traffic.

The operation of scheduled air services to and from Taoyuan is facilitated by air services agreements between Taiwan and other countries. Since the opening of RCTP, the Taiwan Government has implemented a policy of progressive liberalisation of air services with the intention of promoting consumer choice and competition. Many low-cost airlines have started various regional routes to compete head-on with full-service carriers on trunk routes.

The airport&#x27;s long term expansion opportunities are subject to variables. A NTD 300 billion proposal to build a third runway and a third terminal has been under feasibility study and consultation.

===Terminal transit===
Transportation between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 is provided by the Taoyuan Airport Skytrain, which transports both passengers who have cleared security and those who have not through separate train cars. The Taoyuan Airport MRT also serves Terminal 1, Terminal 2, and the Airport Hotel, offerring free fare with an electronic ticket such as the EasyCard, IPASS (Taiwan), or .

===Huan Yu VIP Terminal===
Huan Yu VIP Terminal, also known as the Taoyuan Business Aviation Centre (TYBAC), began service in September 2011 and was officially opened in mid-October 2011. The three-story facility has its own terminal and facilities separate from the public terminals. It provides a multimedia conference room, passenger lounge, private rooms and showers, spa, sauna, gym, and business centre facilities. Other services provided include ground handling, baggage handling, fuelling, security, customs and flight planning. Passengers planning to utilize TYBAC must sign up (to the Taiwanese immigration service) 3 days before use and pay a one-time service charge.

Statistics showed that 376 private jets landed and departed the airport through a six-month timeframe in 2011; this is a 100 percent increase from the same timeframe in 2010.

===E-gate===
Passengers who are citizens of the R.O.C (Taiwan) with valid passports or non-citizens who have ROC (Taiwan) Resident Certificate (ARC/APRC) can register with facial features and fingerprints for the E-Gate. After registration, the passengers can choose either E-Gate or manual immigration clearance when entering or leaving the country.

===Baggage and cargo facilities===
The handling and transportation of mail, passenger baggage, cargo, and the operation of aerobridges and passenger stairways in Taoyuan Airport is provided by Taoyuan International Airport Services Limited (TIAS) and Evergreen Airline Services (EGAS).

TTIA currently handles over 1.5 million tonnes of cargo annually. There are two air cargo terminals in the airport: one operated by Taiwan Air Cargo Terminals Limited and the other operated by Evergreen Air Cargo Services.

===Aircraft maintenance services===
China Airlines Engineering and Maintenance Organization (CALEMO) and Evergreen Aviation Technologies (EGAT) both offers maintenance services at the airport. With its huge base, CALEMO has a market share of over 75% and can offer maintenance service of five wide-body airliners and one narrow-body airliner simultaneously. In addition, EGAT is capable of aircraft conversion programs, such as the Dreamlifter program.

In 2022, aerospace company Nordam opened a major components repair facility at Taoyuan, which will serve as their regional hub replacing operations in Singapore.

==Future developments==

Taoyuan International Airport is undergoing major facility-upgrading and expansion plans. While the South runway (05R/23L) just completed its renovation in January 2015, construction started at the North runway (05L/23R) in March 2015. The runway renovations involve upgrading the runway to Category III and improving the surface conditions. On the other hand, two Terminal 2 gates, C2 and D6, had additional jet bridges installed to accommodate the A380 aircraft. After the runway and jetbridge upgrades, the airport will be able to allow regular A380 operations, with likely carriers being Emirates, China Southern Airlines and Singapore Airlines.

Plans are also underway for the construction of Terminal 3, satellite terminal, and the third runway. Terminal 3 is designed by Rogers Stirk Harbour + Partners and is expected to have an annual capacity of 45 million passengers. Specific plans for the satellite terminal have not been announced. The third runway is expected to be completed by 2030.

The master plan of the airport is the Taoyuan Aerotropolis project, an urban plan aimed at creating an industrial area surrounding Taoyuan Airport. The aerotropolis will take advantage of the competitive local infrastructure to attract developments and help stimulate economic growth. The total area, including the &quot;yolk&quot; airport area and the &quot;white&quot; area, will exceed 6845 hectares. The Terminal 3 and third runway plans are all part of the &quot;yolk&quot; area projects, with the projected expected to be completed by 2023. However, the project has been delayed due to land resumption controversies.

===Terminal 3 construction===

In October 2015, it was announced that RSHP won the bid to design the 640,000 square meter terminal. Structures will include a processor (main terminal building), two concourses, and a multi-functional building to connect the terminal with Terminal 2. The processor will have a wave-like roof structure from which lights will be hung. The lights will move up and down to reflect the flow of passengers. Terminal 3 was initially expected to be completed in 2020 and will be able to handle up to 50 million passengers per year, thus increasing the overall yearly capacity of the airport to over 90 million passengers. It is now scheduled to be complete by 2026. The construction project involves South Korean company Samsung C&amp;T and Taiwan&#x27;s RSEA.

==Accidents and incidents==
*10 August 1993: Air China Flight 973, a Boeing 767, was hijacked after takeoff from Beijing en route to Jakarta. A 30-year-old Chinese man passed a handwritten note to a flight attendant demanding to be flown to Taiwan. He threatened that his &quot;accomplice&quot; would destroy the aircraft unless he was flown to Taiwan. He was carrying a shampoo bottle containing a mixture of hydrochloric and nitric acids, and he threatened to disfigure nearby passengers with the acid if his demands were ignored. The aircraft was flown to Taoyuan International Airport, where the hijacker surrendered.
*Taiwan Taoyuan International Airport was one of many airports targeted by the failed Project Bojinka plot in 1995.
*16 February 1998: China Airlines Flight 676, an Airbus A300-600R (registered B-1814), was approaching Chiang Kai-shek International Airport after its flight from Ngurah Rai International Airport, Indonesia, crashed into a residential area while landing in poor weather, killing all 196 people on board and six on the ground.
*31 October 2000: Singapore Airlines Flight 006, a Boeing 747-400 (registered 9V-SPK), crashed into construction equipment taking off on the wrong runway, killing 83 of the 179 occupants aboard.
*2 November 2019: an unidentified man (referred to as Man A) reportedly of Russian descent jumped onto the landing gear of a China Airlines plane heading from Taoyuan International Airport to Roman Tmetuchl International Airport in Palau. An Asiana Airlines pilot who spotted the man informed air traffic control, which caused the China Airlines flight to be aborted, and the man to be arrested. Officers of the National Police Agency found a notebook and a Bible both in the Russian language in two backpacks that the man had carried with him. In February 2020, the man was charged with violating the Immigration Act of Taiwan after refusing to cooperate with authorities and a Russian interpreter, who was a priest from a Russian Orthodox Church.

<doc id="266328" wikidata="Q1432196" url="?curid=266328" title="Norfolk International Airport">
<text>Norfolk International Airport is seven miles (11 km) northeast of downtown Norfolk, within the boundaries of the independent city in Virginia, United States. It is owned and operated by the Norfolk Airport Authority: a bureau under the municipal government. The airport serves the Hampton Roads metropolitan area of southeast Virginia (along with Newport News/Williamsburg International Airport in Newport News) as well as northeast North Carolina. Despite the name, there are currently no international destinations with regularly scheduled service from the airport.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) 2022 categorized it as a small hub airport.

, with an enplanement count of 2,065,116 people, Norfolk International was ranked as the 65th-busiest airport in the United States and the third-busiest in Virginia in terms of passengers served annually, behind Dulles International Airport and Reagan National Airport, but just ahead of Richmond International. Delta Air Lines has the largest share of passenger traffic, followed by Southwest Airlines and American Airlines.

== History ==

=== 1920s ===
In 1926, Norfolk citizens experienced their first commercial flights on the Mitten Line, operated by Philadelphia Rapid Transit Air Service, Inc. The service offered round-trip flights to Washington and Philadelphia for a brief period before high costs led to its discontinuation. In 1929, Ben Epstein, a World War I veteran pilot, established an air taxi service between Norfolk and Richmond from his airfield on Granby Street. The Ludington Line commenced the first daily scheduled service from Epstein&#x27;s field to Washington, D.C. During this era, air travel was a special occasion marked by families dressing in their finest attire to board the 10-passenger Fokker Trimotor.

=== 1930s ===
Commercial air travel faced challenges in 1932 when the Navy objected to the expansion of the Granby Street field due to its proximity to Norfolk Naval Air Station. Operations moved to Glenrock Airport, but the Great Depression caused all commercial flights to be suspended indefinitely, grounding Norfolk for five years. In 1938, Norfolk Municipal Airport was established on the site of the former Truxton Manor Golf Course, featuring a 3,500-foot runway and a passenger terminal, which was completed in 1940.

=== 1940s ===
During World War II, Norfolk Municipal Airport played a crucial role in the war effort. The Army Air Corps took over operations from 1942 to 1947, expanding the runway and adding two more to accommodate increased flights. After the war, the airport returned to city control, and commercial travel resumed with the introduction of new airlines. In 1948, Piedmont Airlines began operations, coinciding with the groundbreaking for a modern terminal building.

=== 1950s ===
By the early 1950s, Norfolk had more daily flights than New York&#x27;s La Guardia Airport. In 1950, the Norfolk Port and Industrial Authority (NPIA) took over airport management, boasting Norfolk Municipal Airport as one of the nation&#x27;s finest and busiest. The new terminal was officially dedicated in 1951.

=== 1960s ===
The 1960s witnessed the transition from propeller-driven aircraft to jets. Norfolk Municipal Airport easily adapted to the demands for longer runways and taxiways, with jetliners becoming the norm. In 1968, the airport was officially recognized as the air transportation center for the entire region and was renamed Norfolk Regional Airport.

=== 1970s ===
In 1974, Norfolk Regional Airport dedicated its new terminal, expanding further with additional land acquisition and the addition of Federal Customs facilities in 1976. New facilities for the fire station, maintenance depot, and air traffic control tower were also planned and completed as needed. The airport&#x27;s name was also changed from Norfolk Regional Airport to the modern name, Norfolk International Airport.

=== 1980s ===
The 1980s saw significant developments, including the opening of a new general aviation facility and air cargo terminal, along with expanded parking facilities. In 1988, the supervising body Norfolk Port and Industrial Authority was renamed to Norfolk Airport Authority.

=== 1990s ===
Norfolk International Airport continued to grow in the 1990s, expanding its air cargo terminal, parking facilities, and passenger terminal. In 1991, a new concourse extension with 10 additional gates was completed, along with a modern fire station and FAA air traffic control tower. The airport also embraced the digital age by launching its first website and installing internet access booths for travelers.

=== 21st century ===
The Norfolk Airport Authority has undertaken a multi-phase plan to improve airport terminals, concourses, the general aviation terminal, dining and retail facilities, in-airport advertising, and customer service. Renovations and improvements to enhance the passenger experience are ongoing, with capital development projects planned for 2024 and beyond, including runway rehabilitation, pedestrian bridge enhancements, terminal development, concourse expansion, a Federal Inspection Services Facility, and an Airport Hotel.

==Facilities==
The airport covers 1,300 acres (526 ha) at an elevation of 27 feet (8 m). Its main runway, 5–23, is 9,001 by 150 feet (2,744 x 46 m), and crosswind runway 14–32 is 4,875 by 150 feet (1,486 x 46 m).

The crosswind runway (14–32) was closed for renovations on December 19, 2009, and reopened in the spring of 2011. The airport&#x27;s long-term plan calls for this runway to be destroyed to make way for a parallel runway (5R-23L) east of runway 5–23, but the FAA grounded the plan in the summer of 2016 due to diminishing demand, limited space, and environmental impacts.

In 2017 the airport had 67,679 aircraft operations, an average of 185 per day: 39% airline, 27% air taxi, 27% general aviation, and 2% military. In November 2018, 95 aircraft were based at the airport,52 single-engine, 20 multi-engine, 20 jet, and three helicopters.

General aviation services, or fixed-base operations, are provided by Signature Flight Support with full-service facilities for maintaining and housing private and corporate aircraft. The modern terminal facility offers everything from aircraft rental to sightseeing flights and aircraft repair.

Daily scheduled aircraft include ERJ140/145 (United, American,), CRJ200/550/700/900 (Delta, United, American), ERJ170/175/190/195 (American, United, Delta, Breeze), A300 (FedEx), A319/320 (United, Allegiant, American, Frontier, Spirit), B717 (Delta), B737 (Southwest, American, Delta, United), and B757 (UPS and Delta).

===FAA control tower===
Built in 1995, the FAA Norfolk Air Traffic Control Tower stands high. Operated and managed by the Federal Aviation Administration, the Norfolk Tower handles about 1,100 aircraft per day, 24 hours per day and 365 days per year. Radar coverage is provided by the ASR-9 terminal system with a six-level weather detection capability. Also available for use is an Enhanced Target Generator (ETG) lab with two radar scopes to accomplish training objectives, as well as the IDS4 system, a specialized microcomputer network system designed to distribute and display both static and real-time data regarding weather and other rapidly changing critical information to air traffic controllers.

===Gates===
Norfolk International Airport has two passenger concourses: Concourse A (gates A1-A11), and Concourse B (gates B16-B30). Allegiant Air, American Airlines and Southwest Airlines occupy Concourse A while Breeze Airways, Delta Airlines, Frontier Airlines, Spirit Airlines and United Airlines occupy Concourse B. International flights are handled at gate A1; however, there are currently no scheduled international flights. Specific gate locations are the following: 
Allegiant A7; American A2, A4, A6, A8 and A9; Delta B19, B21, B23, B24 and B25; Southwest A3 and A5; United B27-B30, with Breeze, Frontier and Spirit using common gates of B16, B17, B18, B20. Concourse B gates B22 and B26 are no longer in use and have been converted into passenger seating areas for B21 and B25.

===Cargo yard===
About 70 million pounds of air cargo are shipped in and out of Norfolk International Airport each year.
NIA houses one of the most modern and efficient air cargo facilities in the state. Its two modern air cargo terminals have of space. A ramp provides direct access from the plane to the warehouse.

===Terminal upgrade===
The terminal began major upgrades in 2024, scheduled to be finished by 2025. The moving walkway on the bridge between Arrivals and Departures will be reinstalled, the checking bags area will be consolidated, additional departures will be added to Concourse A, and a hotel will be built on the airport&#x27;s grounds. Two new destinations were also announced, with both Breeze Airways and Spirit Airlines flying to Southwest Florida International Airport, and Spirit Airlines flying to Tampa International Airport.

There are no bus or shuttle services to and from Norfolk International Airport. The nearest bus (HRT Route 15) connection is away at the intersection of Military Highway (Route 165) and Norview Avenue (Route 247).

All ground transportation services are located in the arrivals terminal. There are several on-site rental car companies, an authorized shuttle service providing door-to-door service to the entire Hampton Roads area, and taxis available through several companies. Both Uber and Lyft service the airport through an agreement with the airport authority.

===Parking===
A nine-level parking garage adjacent to the new arrivals terminal opened in July 2002. It provides 2,800 covered spaces for short-term, long-term, and rental parking. Overall, NIA parking facilities can accommodate 7,000 vehicles.
In February 2019, the airport announced it would begin construction of a brand new 1.09 million square foot parking garage. Construction started in July 2019. This new parking garage will consolidate all parking lots at ORF. It will also replace the employee shuttle that costs over $600,000 a year to operate.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On January 19, 1967, a United Airlines Vickers 754D Viscount collided with a snow plow that had entered the runway in the path of the United plane upon landing. All 50 passengers and crew on board the aircraft survived; the aircraft suffered major damage to its airframe and was written off.
* On September 1, 1974, a Martin 4-0-4 which was sitting empty on the ramp caught fire, damaging the airframe beyond repair. The cause of the fire was never determined.

<doc id="266329" wikidata="Q7770912" url="?curid=266329" title="The Two Coreys">
<text>The Two Coreys (also known as The Coreys) refer to American actor Corey Feldman (born 1971) and Canadian actor Corey Haim (1971–2010), who were often paired.

Feldman and Haim were child actors during the 1980s; the two were close friends. Both of them grew up in Jewish families and had a passing interest in Numerology. They almost even share the same lucky number – Feldman’s is 22, while Haim wore 222 on a chain around his neck. The Two Coreys appeared in a total of nine films together, including &quot;The Lost Boys&quot; (1987).

Becoming a brand, The Two Coreys achieved mainstream fame and notoriety as teen idols, but each later experienced a career downturn due to drug use.

&quot;The Two Coreys&quot;, a reality show about the two actors, aired on the A&amp;E Network from 2007 to 2008.

Following a long battle with drug addiction, Haim died of pneumonia in 2010.

In 2020, Feldman released &quot;My Truth: The Rape of 2 Coreys&quot;. The documentary explores the friendship between The Two Coreys and asserts that both were sexually abused as children in the entertainment industry.

<text>James Allan Mollison MBE (19 April 1905 – 30 October 1959) was a Scottish pioneer aviator who, flying solo or with his wife, Amy Johnson, set many records during the rapid development of aviation in the 1930s.

==Early years==
Mollison was born on 19 April 1905 in Glasgow, the only child of Hector Alexander Mollison, a consultant engineer, and Thomasina Macnee Addie (&quot;d&quot;. 1965). He was educated at The Glasgow Academy and Edinburgh Academy. He was attracted at an early age to flying. Obtaining his Royal Air Force (RAF) Short Service Commission at 18, he was the youngest officer in the service and, upon completion of training, was posted to India. He flew the Bristol F.2B on active service in Waziristan, taking part in the Pink&#x27;s War operations.

==Aviation career==

At the age of 22, Mollison became a flying instructor at the Central Flying School (CFS), again setting the record for being the youngest in this role. Shortly after, he transferred to the RAF Reserve and devoted his time to civil aviation. In 1928–29, he worked as an instructor with the South Australian Aero Club in Adelaide, leaving that position to become a pilot with Eyre Peninsular Airways and Australian National Airways.

Whilst gaining a reputation as a playboy, Mollison was a skilled pilot who, like many others, took to record breaking as a means of &quot;making his name&quot;. In July to August 1931, he set a record time of 8 days, 19 hours for a flight from Australia to England and, in March 1932, a record for flying from England to Cape Town, South Africa in 4 days, 17 hours.

Mollison had flown commercially for Charles Kingsford Smith&#x27;s ill-fated Australian National Airways. During one of his commercial flights, he met the equally famous aviator Amy Johnson, to whom he proposed only eight hours after meeting, and while still in the air. Johnson accepted; they married in July 1932, and she went off to break her husband&#x27;s England to South Africa record. They were dubbed &quot;The Flying Sweethearts&quot; by the press and public.

Mollison continued to attempt aviation records. On 18 August 1932 he made an east-to-west solo trans-Atlantic flight of 31 hours, from Portmarnock, Ireland to Pennfield, New Brunswick, Canada, using a de Havilland Puss Moth called &quot;The Heart&#x27;s Content&quot;. In 1933, using the same aircraft, Mollison flew from England to Brazil in 3 days, 13 hours, staging through West Africa, the first solo east-west South Atlantic crossing. By then, he and his wife began to plan a record-breaking flight across the world. On 22 July 1933, they took off from Pendine Sands in South Wales on a non-stop flight to New York, but were forced to crash land in Bridgeport, Connecticut, just short of their target, after running out of fuel. He and his wife were both injured, and the plane broken apart by souvenir seekers.

In October 1934 the Mollisons took part in MacRobertson Air Race. Their de Havilland DH.88 Comet &quot;Black Magic&quot; led the competitors off the line and was leading at Baghdad, but they were forced to retire at Allahabad after having to use non-aviation fuel, which damaged their engines.

In November 1936 Mollison made his last major record attempt, a flight from Croydon to Cape Town, South Africa. This time he flew with a co-pilot, French aviator Édouard Corniglion-Molinier. The attempt ended with a forced landing some 160 km short of Cape Town.

The Mollisons&#x27; marriage had become strained; they were rivals for the same aviation records and Mollison was at times a heavy drinker. They divorced in 1938 and Amy Mollison resumed her maiden name.

==World War II==
Both Johnson and Mollison eventually served in the Air Transport Auxiliary (ATA) in World War II. Johnson was killed while ferrying an aircraft in 1941. A notable incident occurred when Mollison flew as a co-pilot with Diana Barnato Walker. Their Anson was intercepted and shot at by Luftwaffe fighters. Although the aircraft was hit, the 12 passengers and crew were unhurt. On landing, Mollison&#x27;s only concern was &quot;how to get a cup of tea!&quot;

In June 1941 Mollison and an ATA crew delivered Cunliffe-Owen OA-1 G-AFMB to Fort Lamy, Chad. The aircraft was fitted out as a personal transport for General De Gaulle. Jim Mollison was made a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) for his services with the ATA.

==Postwar==

Mollison later settled in London and ran a public house. He married Maria Clasina E. Kamphuis on 26 September 1949 at the Maidenhead Register Office. 

Mollison abused alcohol and, in 1953, the Civil Aviation Authority Medical Board revoked his pilot&#x27;s licence. The couple separated but Maria bought the Carisbrooke Hotel in Surbiton for him – a temperance hotel. 

Suffering from acute alcoholism, he was admitted to The Priory, Roehampton, south-west London, where he died on 30 October 1959.

<doc id="266334" wikidata="Q6682" url="?curid=266334" title="Gustave Doré">
<text>Paul Gustave Louis Christophe Doré ( , , ; 6January 1832 – 23January 1883) was a French printmaker, illustrator, painter, comics artist, caricaturist, and sculptor. He is best known for his prolific output of wood-engravings illustrating classic literature, especially those for the Vulgate Bible and Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;. These achieved great international success, and he became renowned for printmaking, although his role was normally as the designer only; at the height of his career some 40 block-cutters were employed to cut his drawings onto the wooden printing blocks, usually also signing the image.

He created over 10,000illustrations, the most important of which were copied using an electrotype process using cylinder presses, allowing very large print runs to be published simultaneously in many countries.

Although Doré&#x27;s work was popular with the general public during his life, it was met with mixed reviews from contemporary art critics. His work has been more widely celebrated in the centuries following his death. Among his contemporary admirers were writers H. P. Lovecraft and Théophile Gautier. Julien Doré, Gustave&#x27;s great-great-grandson, is a popular singer-songwriter in France.

==Biography==

Doré was born in Strasbourg on 6January 1832. At the age of15, Doré began his career working as a caricaturist for the French paper &quot;Le journal pour rire&quot;. The illustrations of J. J. Grandville have been noted as an influence on his work. Wood-engraving was his primary method at this time. In the late 1840s and early 1850s, he made several text comics, like &quot;Les Travaux d&#x27;Hercule&quot; (1847), &quot;Trois artistes incompris et mécontents&quot; (1851), &quot;Les Dés-agréments d&#x27;un voyage d&#x27;agrément&quot; (1851) and &quot;L&#x27;Histoire de la Sainte Russie&quot; (1854). Doré subsequently went on to win commissions to depict scenes from books by Cervantes, Rabelais, Balzac, Milton, and Dante. He also illustrated &quot;Gargantua et Pantagruel&quot; in 1854.

In 1853 Doré was asked to illustrate the works of Lord Byron. This commission was followed by additional work for British publishers, including a new illustrated Bible. In 1856 he produced 12folio-size illustrations of &quot;The Legend of The Wandering Jew&quot;, which propagated longstanding antisemitic views of the time, for a short poem which Pierre-Jean de Béranger had derived from a novel of Eugène Sue of 1845.
In the 1860s he illustrated a French edition of Cervantes&#x27;s &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and his depictions of the knight and his squire, Sancho Panza, became so famous that they influenced subsequent readers, artists, and stage and film directors&#x27; ideas of the physical &quot;look&quot; of the two characters. Doré also illustrated an oversized edition of Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s &quot;The Raven&quot;, an endeavor that earned him 30,000francs from publisher Harper &amp; Brothers in 1883.

The government of France made him a Knight of the Legion of Honour in 1861.

Doré&#x27;s illustrations for the Bible (1866) were a great success, and in 1867 Doré had a major exhibition of his work in London. This exhibition led to the foundation of the Doré Gallery in Bond Street, London. In 1869, Blanchard Jerrold, the son of Douglas William Jerrold, suggested that they work together to produce a comprehensive portrait of London. Jerrold had obtained the idea from &quot;The Microcosm of London&quot; produced by Rudolph Ackermann, William Pyne, and Thomas Rowlandson (published in three volumes from 1808 to 1810). Doré signed a five-year contract with the publishers Grant &amp; Co that involved his staying in London for three months a year, and he received the vast sum of £10,000 a year for the project. Doré was celebrated for his paintings in his day, but his wood-engravings, like those he did for Jerrold, are where he excelled as an artist with an individual vision.

The completed book &quot;&quot;, with 180wood engravings, was published in 1872. It enjoyed commercial and popular success, but the work was disliked by some contemporary British critics, as it appeared to focus on the poverty that existed in parts of London. Doré was accused by &quot;The Art Journal&quot; of &quot;inventing rather than copying.&quot; The &quot;Westminster Review&quot; claimed that &quot;Doré gives us sketches in which the commonest, the vulgarest external features are set down.&quot; But they impressed Vincent van Gogh, who painted a version of the &quot;Prisoners&#x27; Round&quot; in 1890, the year of his death. The book was a financial success, however, and Doré received commissions from other British publishers.

Doré&#x27;s later work included illustrations for new editions of Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;, Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;, Tennyson&#x27;s &quot;Idylls of the King&quot;, &quot;The Works of Thomas Hood&quot;, and &quot;The Divine Comedy&quot;. Doré&#x27;s work also appeared in the weekly newspaper &quot;The Illustrated London News&quot;.

The medical doctor Jean-Baptiste Fuzier, who was a specialist in yellow fever and other tropical diseases, bequeathed watercolor paintings by Doré to the museum of Grenoble in 1880. According to the Musée de Grenoble, Doré developed his expertise as a watercolorist during a trip to Scotland in 1873.

==Death==
Doré never married and, following the death of his father in 1849, he continued to live with his mother, illustrating books until his death of a heart attack in Paris on January23, 1883, following a short illness. At the time of his death Doré was working on illustrations for an edition of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays.

==Works==
Doré was a prolific artist; thus the following list of works is not complete and it does not include his paintings, sculptures, and many of his journal illustrations:
==Reception and legacy==
Doré&#x27;s work received mixed reviews from contemporary art critics, but he was widely acclaimed by the general public. He was adored by many writers and poets, who felt he &quot;brought their wildest dreams and fantasies to life&quot;. Théophile Gautier for example stated &quot;Nobody better than this artist can give a mysterious and deep vitality to chimeras, dreams, nightmares, intangible shapes bathed in light and shade, weirdly caricatured silhouettes and all the monsters of fantasy.&quot; H.P. Lovecraft drew inspiration from Doré&#x27;s &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; illustrations in his formative years.

<text>Rabbit Don&#x27;t Come Easy is the tenth studio album by German power metal band Helloween, released in 2003. It is the first Helloween album to feature Sascha Gerstner on guitars, who replaced Roland Grapow. No drummer is listed in the band line-up for this album. Mark Cross was hired for the position before recording, but only managed to complete two tracks (&quot;Don&#x27;t Stop Being Crazy&quot; and &quot;Listen to the Flies&quot;) before being forced to leave due to illness. Mikkey Dee of Motörhead played on the rest of the songs on a session basis. The Japanese version contains a cover of Accept&#x27;s &quot;Fast as a Shark&quot;, with the band&#x27;s new drummer, Stefan Schwarzmann.

Commenting on Dee&#x27;s performance, bassist Markus Grosskopf said:

About the album title, bassist Markus Grosskopf explained in 2003 that &quot;It&#x27;s based on that English saying, pulling a rabbit out of the hat. Pulling this rabbit [the album] out of this hat [in reference to recent line up changes] wasn&#x27;t that easy this time. That gave us the idea of just calling the album &quot;Rabbit Don&#x27;t Come Easy&quot;. [Laughs] It&#x27;s not to be taken too seriously. We were joking that statement around, and then I suggested we actually call the album that&quot;.

About the recording of the album, singer Andi Deris said in 2003 that producer Charlie Bauerfeind &quot;shows on this new record that he is the biggest fan of our genre of music because he knows how to separate the frequencies and knows where the power has to be. You have to imagine that this type of music is so packed with frequencies that it is nearly impossible to mix because it is so overloaded and you have to single out all of the instruments so you can hear them all&quot;.

After the controversial release of &quot;The Dark Ride&quot;, according to Grosskopf, &quot;The record company also wanted us to show that we are back. This song &quot;Just a Little Sign&quot; represents the more typical side of Helloween, and that&#x27;s what we wanted to make clear. You can&#x27;t really represent a whole album with one track, but this shows exactly where the album actually goes. It&#x27;s more of that &#x27;happy happy Helloween&#x27; direction. It shows that this album is not a sequel to &#x27;The Dark Ride&#x27;&quot;.

<text>A vending machine is an automated machine that dispenses items such as snacks, beverages, cigarettes, and lottery tickets to consumers after cash, a credit card, or other forms of payment are inserted into the machine or payment is otherwise made. The first modern vending machines were developed in England in the early 1880s and dispensed postcards. Vending machines exist in many countries and, in more recent times, specialized vending machines that provide less common products compared to traditional vending machine items have been created.

==History==

The earliest known reference to a vending machine is in the work of Hero of Alexandria, an engineer and mathematician in first-century Roman Egypt. His machine accepted a coin and then dispensed wine or holy water. When the coin was deposited, it fell upon a pan attached to a lever. The lever opened a valve which let some water flow out. The pan continued to tilt with the weight of the coin until it fell off, at which point a counterweight snapped the lever up and turned off the valve.

Coin-operated machines that dispensed tobacco were being operated as early as 1615 in the taverns of England. The machines were portable and made of brass. An English bookseller, Richard Carlile, devised a newspaper dispensing machine for the dissemination of banned works in 1822. Simon Denham was awarded British Patent no. 706 for his stamp dispensing machine in 1867, the first fully automatic vending machine.

===Modern vending machines===

The first modern coin-operated vending machines were introduced in London, England, in the early 1880s, dispensing postcards. The machine was invented by Percival Everitt in 1883 and soon became a widespread feature at railway stations and post offices, dispensing envelopes, postcards, and notepaper. The Sweetmeat Automatic Delivery Company was founded in 1887 in England as the first company to deal primarily with installing and maintaining vending machines. Also at about that time in England, Dixon Henry Davies and inventor John Mensy Tourtel patented a coin-operated reading lamp for use on trains and founded the Railway Automatic Electric Light Syndicate, Ltd. The system ran off batteries and delivered 30 minutes of light for 1d., but was not a long-term success. Tourtel also invented a similarly coin-operated gas meter. In 1893, Stollwerck, a German chocolate manufacturer, was selling its chocolate in 15,000 vending machines. It set up separate companies in various territories to manufacture vending machines to sell not just chocolate, but cigarettes, matches, chewing gum, and soap products.

The first vending machine in the U.S. was built in 1888 by the Thomas Adams Gum Company, selling gum on New York City train platforms. The idea of adding games to these machines as a further incentive to buy came in 1897 when the Pulver Manufacturing Company added small figures, which would move around whenever somebody bought some gum from their machines. This idea spawned a whole new type of mechanical device known as the &quot;trade stimulators&quot;.

====Growth====
The vending machine industry in the United States is a multi-billion dollar sector. In 2023, it was estimated to be worth $18.2 billion, with approximately 3 million machines generating an average monthly revenue of $525. However, this is an average, and the industry is trending toward more sophisticated and automated vending machines, particularly in North America.

This trend is driven by the increasing demand for convenience and the development of advanced technologies. For instance, the hot food vending machine sector is valued at $4.8 billion and is seeing significant growth as robotics companies introduce automated solutions for dispensing pasta, burgers, and groceries. The broader fresh food vending segment is projected to reach $8 billion by 2029, offering consumers more options for nutritious and convenient meals and snacks.

==Mechanisms==

Internal communication in vending machines is typically based on the MDB standard, supported by National Automatic Merchandising Association (NAMA) and European Vending &amp; Coffee Service Association (EVA).

After payment has been tendered, a product may become available by:
* the machine releasing it, so that it falls in an open compartment at the bottom, or into a cup, either released first, or put in by the customer, or
* the unlocking of a door, drawer, or turning of a knob.

Some products need to be prepared to become available. For example, tickets are printed or magnetized on the spot, and coffee is freshly concocted. One of the most common forms of vending machine, the snack machine, often uses a metal coil which when ordered rotates to release the product.

The main example of a vending machine giving access to all merchandise after paying for one item is a newspaper vending machine (also called vending box) found mainly in the U.S. and Canada. It contains a pile of identical newspapers. After a sale the door automatically returns to a locked position. A customer could open the box and take all of the newspapers or, for the benefit of other customers, leave all of the newspapers outside of the box, slowly return the door to an unlatched position, or block the door from fully closing, each of which are frequently discouraged, sometimes by a security clamp. The success of such machines is predicated on the assumption that the customer will be honest (hence the nickname &quot;honor box&quot;), and need only one copy.

==Common vending machines==
===Change machine===

A change machine is a vending machine that accepts large denominations of currency and returns an equal amount of currency in smaller bills or coins. Typically these machines are used to provide coins in exchange for paper currency, in which case they are also often known as bill changers.

===Cigarette vending===
In the past, cigarettes were commonly sold in the United States through these machines, but this is increasingly rare due to concerns about underage buyers. Sometimes a pass has to be inserted in the machine to prove one&#x27;s age before a purchase can be made. In the United Kingdom, legislation banning them outright came into effect on 1 October 2011. In Germany, Austria, Italy, the Czech Republic, and Japan, cigarette machines are still common.

Since 2007, however, age verification has been mandatory in Germany and Italy – buyers must be 18 or over. The various machines installed in pubs and cafés, other publicly accessible buildings, and on the street accept one or more of the following as proof of age: the buyer&#x27;s identity card, bank debit card (smart card), or European Union driver&#x27;s license. In Japan, age verification has been mandatory since 1 July 2008 via the Taspo card, issued only to persons aged 20 or over. The Taspo card uses RFID, stores monetary value, and is contactless.

===Birth control and condom vending machines===

A birth control machine is a vending machine for the sale of birth control, such as condoms or emergency contraception. Condom machines are often placed in public toilets, subway stations, airports, or schools as a public health measure to promote safe sex. Many pharmacies also keep one outside, for after-hours access. Rare examples exist that dispense female condoms or the morning after pill.

===Food and snack vending machines===
Various types of food and snack vending machines exist in the world. Food vending machines that provide shelf-stable foods such as chips, cookies, cakes, and other such snacks are common. Some food vending machines are refrigerated or frozen, such as for chilled soft drinks and ice cream treats, and some machines provide hot food.

Some unique food vending machines exist that are specialized and less common, such as the French fry vending machine and hot pizza vending machines, such as Let&#x27;s Pizza. The Beverly Hills Caviar Automated Boutique dispenses frozen caviar and other high-end foods.

====Bulk candy and gumball vending====
The profit margins in the bulk candy business can be quite high – gumballs, for instance, can be purchased in bulk for around 2 cents per piece and sold for 25 cents in gumball machines in the U.S., and other countries. Gumballs and candy have a relatively long shelf life, enabling vending machine operators to manage many machines without too much time or cost involved. In addition, the machines are typically inexpensive compared to soft drink or snack machines, which often require power and sometimes refrigeration to work. Many operators donate a percentage of the profits to charity so that locations will allow them to place the machines for free.

Bulk vending may be a more practical choice than soft drink/snack vending for an individual who also works a full-time job, since the restaurants, retail stores, and other locations suitable for bulk vending may be more likely to be open during the evening and on weekends than venues such as offices that host soft drink and snack machines.

The Bulk vending machines of today provide many different vending choices with the use of adjustable gumball and candy wheels. Adjustable gumball wheels allow an operator to not only offer the traditional 1-inch gumball, but they can also vend larger gumballs, and non-edible items such as toy capsules and bouncy balls. Adjustable candy wheels allow an operator to offer a variety of pressed candies, jelly candy, chocolates and even nuts.

====Full-line vending====
A full-line vending company may set up several types of vending machines that sell a wide range of products. Products may include candy, cookies, chips, fresh fruit, milk, cold food, coffee and other hot drinks, bottles and cans of soda and other drinks, and even frozen products like ice cream. These products can be sold from machines that include hot coffee, snack, cold food, and bottle machines. In the United States, almost all machines accept bills with more and more machines accepting $5 bills, along with payment from traditional debit and credit cards, or a mobile payment system. This is an advantage to the vendor because it virtually eliminates the need for a bill changer. Larger corporations with cafeterias will often request full line vending to supplement their food service.

===Newspaper vending machine===

A newspaper vending machine or newspaper rack is a vending machine designed to distribute newspapers. Newspaper vending machines are used worldwide, and they can be one of the main distribution methods for newspaper publishers. According to the Newspaper Association of America, in recent times in the United States, circulation via newspaper vending machines has dropped significantly: in 1996, around 46% of single-sale newspapers were sold in newspaper boxes, and in 2014, only 20% of newspapers were sold in the boxes.

===Photo booth===
A photo booth is a vending machine or modern kiosk that contains an automated, usually coin-operated, camera and film processor. Today, the vast majority of photo booths are digital. Traditionally, photo booths contain a seat or bench designed to seat the one or two patrons being photographed. The seat is typically surrounded by a curtain of some sort to allow for some privacy and help avoid outside interference during the photo session. Once the payment is made, the photo booth will take a series of photographs and the customer is then provided with prints. Older photo booth vending machines used film and involved the process of developing the film using liquid chemicals.

===Stamp vending machine===

A stamp vending machine is a mechanical, electrical or electro-mechanical device which can be used to automatically vend postage stamps to users in exchange for a pre-determined amount of money, normally in coin.

===Ticket machines===
A ticket machine is a vending machine that produces tickets. For instance, ticket machines dispense train tickets at railway stations, transit tickets at metro stations and tram tickets at some tram stops and in some trams. The typical transaction consists of a user using the display interface to select the type and quantity of tickets and then choosing a payment method of either cash, credit/debit card or smartcard. The ticket or tickets are then printed and dispensed to the user.

==Specialized vending machines==
From 2000 to 2010, the specialization of vending machines became more common. Vending extended increasingly into non-traditional areas like electronics, or even artwork or short stories. Machines of this new category are generally called automated retail kiosks. When using an automated retail machine, consumers select products, sometimes using a touchscreen interface, pay for purchases using a credit or debit card and then the product is dispensed, sometimes via an internal robotic arm in the machine. The trend of specialization and proliferation of vending machines is perhaps most apparent in Japan where vending machines sell products from toilet paper to hot meals and pornography, and there is 1 vending machine per 23 people.

=== Ammunition vending machine ===
In 2024, a company called American Rounds began operating vending machines that sell firearm ammunition in grocery stores in the U.S. states of Alabama, Texas, Oklahoma, and Colorado. The machines use age-verification technology and facial recognition technology to make sure that buyers are at least 21 years old. Another company, called Master Ammo, operates similar machines that lack age-verification systems in gun clubs and gun ranges that have age requirements for entering.

===Automobile vending machine===
In November 2013, online auto retailer Carvana opened the first car vending machine in the U.S., located in Atlanta dispensing various models of used cars.

In late 2016, Autobahn Motors, a car dealership in Singapore, opened a 15-story-tall luxury car vending machine containing 60 cars, dispensing Ferrari and Lamborghini vehicles.

===Bait vending machine===
A bait machine is a vending machine that dispenses live fishing bait, such as worms and crickets, for fishing.

===Book vending machine===

Book vending machines dispense books, which may be full-sized. Some libraries use book vending machines. GoLibrary is a book lending vending machine used by libraries in Sweden and the U.S. state of California. The Biblio-Mat is a random antiquarian book vending machine located at The Monkey&#x27;s Paw bookstore in Toronto, Canada.

=== Burger vending machine ===
In 2022 RoboBurger introduced a machine to cook and vend a fresh hamburger.

=== Cotton candy vending machine ===
The cotton candy vending machine is a vending machine that dispenses freshly spun cotton candy.

===French fry vending machine===

A French fry vending machine is a vending machine that dispenses hot French fries, also known as chips. The first known french fry vending machine was developed circa 1982 by the defunct Precision Fry Foods Pty Ltd. in Australia. A few companies have developed and manufactured French fry vending machines and prototypes. Furthermore, a prototype machine was also developed at Wageningen University in the Netherlands.

===Pizza vending machine===

Let&#x27;s Pizza is the name of a vending machine that makes fresh pizza from scratch. It was developed in 2009 by Italian company Sitos srl. The machine combines water, flour, tomato sauce, and fresh ingredients to make a pizza in approximately three minutes. It includes windows so customers can watch the pizza as it is made. The pizza is cooked in an infrared oven. The device was invented by Claudio Torghele, an entrepreneur in Rovereto, Italy. The vending machine began in Italy and is now spreading into the United Kingdom and becoming popular there.

===Life insurance===

From the 1950s until the 1970s, vending machines were used at American airports to sell life insurance policies covering death, in case the buyer&#x27;s flight crashed. However, this practice gradually disappeared due to the tendency of American courts to strictly construe such policies against their sellers, such as the Fidelity and Casualty Company of New York (which later became part of CNA Financial).

===Marijuana vending machine===

The marijuana vending machine originally found a niche market for selling or dispensing cannabis. In the early 21st century with legalization of cannabis in many countries, marijuana vending machines became widespread, selling products such as marijuana, hemp and CBD based products and smoke paraphernalia. The first experiments in distributing marijuana through vending machines started in the early 2010s, when they were already in use in the United States and Canada. The primary challenge faced in selling restricted or controlled merchandise like cannabis is to verify the identity of the buyer, which is overcome by the application of biometrics and smart vending software technology, the same technology used to verify the buyer&#x27;s age in the automatic sales of tobacco.

===Mold-A-Rama===
The Mold-A-Rama is a brand name for a type of vending machine that makes blow-molded plastic figurines. Mold-A-Rama machines debuted in late 1962 and grew in prominence at the 1964 New York World&#x27;s Fair. The machines can still be found operating in dozens of museums and zoos.

===Fresh-squeezed orange juice===

This type of machine contains fresh oranges and a mechanism to cut and squeeze them in order to produce fresh juice.

===Prize vending machine===

This type of machine sells a container that may contain a prize. Some such machines advertise the possible prizes that may be won. Examples include smart phones, holiday packages, and toys.

===Social-networked vending machine===
With the rise of the social networks, vending machine has been integrated to social media in order to proliferate the interaction of the vending machine with the users from the physical machine to the social networks. The common application of social-networked vending machine is that the user can connect their social account to a specific social media designated by the vending machine, the user will be getting some rewards in return, normally in the form of free gift dispensed from the vending machine.

===Make-Up vending machines===
Vending machines are also being used by entrepreneurs to sell cosmetics to those on the go as an easy convenience.

=== Giving Machine ===

A Giving Machine is a specialized &quot;reserve vending machine&quot; that allows people to purchase donations for various nonprofits. They are placed in various public areas by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints during the Christmas and holiday season.

==Popularity in Japan==
Vending machines are a common sight in Japan, and are considerably popular. There are more than 5.5 million machines installed throughout the nation, and Japan holds the highest ratio of machines per person for any country with one machine for every twenty-three people.

Regarding the development of advanced technology, Japanese vending machines provide more services by selling different kinds of products. Food, smartphones, SIM cards, and even clothing can be found in these machines. Apart from the most popular drink vending machines, Japanese vending machines also offer certain products depending on the demand and need for different locations. For example, products like sanitary napkins and tampons can be found in vending machines in female restrooms, while machines selling condoms are usually located in male restrooms.

Convenience, low cost of running, security, and stability seem to be the main reasons for Japan to invest in vending machines.

A patent for an &quot;automatic goods vending machine&quot; was filed in 1888 in Japan; early surviving vending machines from around the 1900s include one that dispenses stamps and postcards, and one that dispenses sake. Confectionery vending machines became widespread in the 1920s, and juice vending machines became popular in the late 1950s and 1960s. By 2000, the number of vending machines in Japan had grown to 5.6 million. However, from around the early 2000s, the number of vending machines in Japan decreased slightly to 5.03 million, and the sales amount also decreased gradually, in part due to the rise of digital technology and market competition. In recent years, attention has been drawn towards older machines, such as the collection of vintage vending machines installed at the Sagamihara Vending Machine Park.

In 2024, it was reported that a sizeable portion of the vending machines in Japan would require updates to their acceptors in order to accept the new designs for the Japanese yen banknotes that were due to be released that year.

==Smart vending machines==
Similar to the development of traditional mobile phones into smartphones, vending machines have also progressively, though at a much slower pace, evolved into smart vending machines. Newer technologies at a lower cost of adoption, such as the large digital touch display, internet connectivity, cameras and various types of sensors, more cost-effective embedded computing power, digital signage, various advanced payment systems, and a wide range of identification technology (NFC, RFID, etc.) have contributed to this development. These smart vending machines enable a more interactive user experience, and reduce operating costs while improving the efficiency of the vending operations through remote manageability and intelligent back-end analytic. Integrated sensors and cameras also represent a source of such data as customer demographics, purchase trends, and other locality-specific information. It also enables better customer-engagement for the brands through interactive multimedia and social media connectivity. Smart vending machines were 79 by JWT Intelligence on its list of 100 Things to Watch in 2014. According to market research by Frost &amp; Sullivan, global shipments of smart vending machines are forecasted to reach around 2 million units by 2018, and further to 3.6 million units by 2020 with penetration rate of 20.3 percent.

<text>Space debris (also known as space junk, space pollution, space waste, space trash, space garbage, or cosmic debris) are defunct human-made objects in spaceprincipally in Earth orbitwhich no longer serve a useful function. These include derelict spacecraft (nonfunctional spacecraft and abandoned launch vehicle stages), mission-related debris, and particularly numerous in-Earth orbit, fragmentation debris from the breakup of derelict rocket bodies and spacecraft. In addition to derelict human-made objects left in orbit, space debris includes fragments from disintegration, erosion, or collisions; solidified liquids expelled from spacecraft; unburned particles from solid rocket motors; and even paint flecks. Space debris represents a risk to spacecraft.

Space debris is typically a negative externality. It creates an external cost on others from the initial action to launch or use a spacecraft in near-Earth orbit, a cost that is typically not taken into account nor fully accounted for by the launcher or payload owner.

Several spacecraft, both crewed and un-crewed, have been damaged or destroyed by space debris. The measurement, mitigation, and potential removal of debris is conducted by some participants in the space industry.

, the US Space Surveillance Network reported 25,857 artificial objects in orbit above the Earth, including 5,465 operational satellites. However, these are just the objects large enough to be tracked and in an orbit that makes tracking possible. Satellite debris that is in a Molniya orbit, such as the Kosmos Oko series, might be too high above the Northern Hemisphere to be tracked. , more than 128 million pieces of debris smaller than , about 900,000 pieces of debris 1–10 cm, and around 34,000 of pieces larger than were estimated to be in orbit around the Earth. When the smallest objects of artificial space debris (paint flecks, solid rocket exhaust particles, etc.) are grouped with micrometeoroids, they are together sometimes referred to by space agencies as MMOD (Micrometeoroid and Orbital Debris).

Collisions with debris have become a hazard to spacecraft. The smallest objects cause damage akin to sandblasting, especially to solar panels and optics like telescopes or star trackers that cannot easily be protected by a ballistic shield.

Below , pieces of debris are denser than meteoroids. Most are dust from solid rocket motors, surface erosion debris like paint flakes, and frozen coolant from Soviet nuclear-powered satellites. For comparison, the International Space Station (ISS) orbits in the range, while the two most recent large debris events, the 2007 Chinese antisatellite weapon test and the 2009 satellite collision, occurred at altitude. The ISS has Whipple shielding to resist damage from small MMOD. However, known debris with a collision chance over 1/10,000 are avoided by maneuvering the station.

According to a report published in January 2025, scientists are encouraging vigilance around closing airspace more often to avoid collisions between airline flights and space debris reentering the earth&#x27;s atmosphere amid an increasing volume of both. Following a destructive event, the explosion of SpaceX&#x27;s Starship Flight 7 on January 16, 2025, the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) slowed air traffic in the area where debris was falling. This prompted several aircraft to request diversion because of low fuel levels while they were holding outside the Debris Response Area. 

== History ==

Space debris began to accumulate in Earth orbit with the launch of the first artificial satellite, Sputnik 1, into orbit in October, 1957. But even before this event, humans might have produced ejecta that became space debris, as in the August 1957 Pascal B test. Going back further, natural ejecta from Earth has entered orbit.

After the launch of Sputnik, the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) began compiling a database (the Space Object Catalog) of all known rocket launches and objects reaching orbit, including satellites, protective shields and upper-stages of launch vehicles. NASA later published modified versions of the database in two-line element sets, and beginning in the early 1980s, they were republished in the CelesTrak bulletin board system.
NORAD trackers who fed the database were aware of other objects in orbit, many of which were the result of in-orbit explosions. Some were deliberately caused during anti-satellite weapon (ASAT) testing in the 1960s, and others were the result of rocket stages blowing up in orbit as leftover propellant expanded and ruptured their tanks. More detailed databases and tracking systems were gradually developed, including Gabbard diagrams, to improve the modeling of orbital evolution and decay.

When the NORAD database became publicly available during the 1970s, techniques developed for the asteroid-belt were applied to the study of known artificial satellite objects.

Time and natural gravitational/atmospheric effects help to clear space debris. A variety of technological approaches have also been proposed, though most have not been implemented. A number of scholars have observed that systemic factors, political, legal, economic, and cultural, are the greatest impediment to the cleanup of near-Earth space. There has been little commercial incentive to reduce space debris since the associated cost does not accrue to the entity producing it. Rather, the cost falls to all users of the space environment who benefit from space technology and knowledge. A number of suggestions for increasing incentives to reduce space debris have been made. These would encourage companies to see the economic benefit of reducing debris more aggressively than existing government mandates require. In 1979, NASA founded the Orbital Debris Program to research mitigation measures for space debris in Earth orbit.

=== Debris growth ===

During the 1980s, NASA and other U.S. groups attempted to limit the growth of debris. One trial solution was implemented by McDonnell Douglas in 1981 for the Delta launch vehicle by having the booster move away from its payload and vent any propellant remaining in its tanks. This eliminated one source for pressure buildup in the tanks which had previously caused them to explode and create additional orbital debris. Other countries were slower to adopt this measure and, due especially to a number of launches by the Soviet Union, the problem grew throughout the decade.

A new battery of studies followed as NASA, NORAD, and others attempted to better understand the orbital environment, with each adjusting the number of pieces of debris in the critical-mass zone upward. Although in 1981 (when Schefter&#x27;s article was published) the number of objects was estimated at 5,000, new detectors in the Ground-based Electro-Optical Deep Space Surveillance system found new objects. By the late 1990s, it was thought that most of the 28,000 launched objects had already decayed and about 8,500 remained in orbit. By 2005 this was adjusted upward to 13,000 objects, and a 2006 study increased the number to 19,000 as a result of an ASAT and a satellite collision. In 2011, NASA said that 22,000 objects were being tracked.

A 2006 NASA model suggested that if no new launches took place, the environment would retain the then-known population until about 2055, when it would increase on its own. Richard Crowther of Britain&#x27;s Defence Evaluation and Research Agency said in 2002 that he believed the cascade would begin about 2015. The National Academy of Sciences, summarizing the professional view, noted widespread agreement that two bands of LEO space900 to and were already past critical density.

In the 2009 CEAS European Air and Space Conference, University of Southampton researcher Hugh Lewis predicted that the threat from space debris would rise 50 percent in the next decade and quadruple in the next 50 years. , more than 13,000 close calls were tracked weekly.

A 2011 report by the U.S. National Research Council warned NASA that the amount of orbiting space debris was at a critical level. According to some computer models, the amount of space debris &quot;has reached a tipping point, with enough currently in orbit to continually collide and create even more debris, raising the risk of spacecraft failures.&quot; The report called for international regulations limiting debris and research of disposal methods.

==== Debris history in particular years ====

* By mid-1994 there had been 68 breakups or debris &quot;anomalous events&quot; involving satellites launched by the former Soviet Union/Russia and 18 similar events had been discovered involving rocket bodies and other propulsion-related operational debris.
*, 19,000 debris over were tracked by the United States Space Surveillance Network.
*, estimates of more than 170 million debris smaller than , about 670,000 debris 1–10 cm, and approximately 29,000 larger pieces of debris were in orbit.
*, nearly 18,000 artificial objects were orbiting above Earth, including 1,419 operational satellites.
*, nearly 20,000 artificial objects were in orbit above the Earth, including 2,218 operational satellites.

 there were estimated to be over 128 million pieces of debris smaller than , and approximately 900,000 pieces between 1 and 10 cm. The count of large debris (defined as 10 cm across or larger) was 34,000 in 2019, and at least 37,000 by June 2023. The technical measurement cut-off is c. .

, there were 8,000 metric tons of debris in orbit, a figure that is expected to increase.

=== Low Earth orbit ===

In the orbits nearest to Earthless than orbital altitude, referred to as low-Earth orbit (LEO)there have traditionally been few &quot;universal orbits&quot; that keep a number of spacecraft in particular rings (in contrast to GEO, a single orbit that is widely used by over 500 satellites). There is currently 85% pollution in LEO (Low Earth Orbit). This was beginning to change in 2019, and several companies began to deploy the early phases of satellite internet constellations, which will have many universal orbits in LEO with 30 to 50 satellites per orbital plane and altitude. Traditionally, the most populated LEO orbits have been a number of Sun-synchronous satellites that keep a constant angle between the Sun and the orbital plane, making Earth observation easier with consistent sun angle and lighting. Sun-synchronous orbits are polar, meaning they cross over the polar regions. LEO satellites orbit in many planes, typically up to 15 times a day, causing frequent approaches between objects. The density of satellitesboth active and derelictis much higher in LEO.

Orbits are affected by gravitational perturbations (which in LEO include unevenness of the Earth&#x27;s gravitational field due to variations in the density of the planet), and collisions can occur from any direction. The average impact speed of collisions in Low Earth Orbit is 10 km/s with maximums reaching above 14 km/s due to orbital eccentricity. The 2009 satellite collision occurred at a closing speed of , creating over 2,000 large debris fragments. These debris cross many other orbits and increase debris collision risk.

It is theorized that a sufficiently large collision of spacecraft could potentially lead to a cascade effect, or even make some particular low Earth orbits effectively unusable for long term use by orbiting satellites, a phenomenon known as the Kessler syndrome. The theoretical effect is projected to be a theoretical runaway chain reaction of collisions that could occur, exponentially increasing the number and density of space debris in low-Earth orbit, and has been hypothesized to ensue beyond some critical density.

Crewed space missions are mostly at altitude and below, where air drag helps clear zones of fragments. The upper atmosphere is not a fixed density at any particular orbital altitude; it varies as a result of atmospheric tides and expands or contracts over longer time periods as a result of space weather. These longer-term effects can increase drag at lower altitudes; the 1990s expansion was a factor in reduced debris density. Another factor was fewer launches by Russia; the Soviet Union made most of their launches in the 1970s and 1980s.

=== Higher altitudes ===

At higher altitudes, where air drag is less significant, orbital decay takes longer. Slight atmospheric drag, lunar perturbations, Earth&#x27;s gravity perturbations, solar wind, and solar radiation pressure can gradually bring debris down to lower altitudes (where it decays), but at very high altitudes this may take centuries. Although high-altitude orbits are less commonly used than LEO and the onset of the problem is slower, the numbers progress toward the critical threshold more quickly.

Many communications satellites are in geostationary orbits (GEO), clustering over specific targets and sharing the same orbital path. Although velocities are low between GEO objects, when a satellite becomes derelict (such as Telstar 401) it assumes a geosynchronous orbit; its orbital inclination increases about 0.8° and its speed increases about per year. Impact velocity peaks at about . Orbital perturbations cause longitude drift of the inoperable spacecraft and precession of the orbital plane. Close approaches (within 50 meters) are estimated at one per year. The collision debris pose less short-term risk than from a LEO collision, but the satellite would likely become inoperable. Large objects, such as solar-power satellites, are especially vulnerable to collisions.

Although the ITU now requires proof a satellite can be moved out of its orbital slot at the end of its lifespan, studies suggest this is insufficient. Since GEO orbit is too distant to accurately measure objects under , the nature of the problem is not well known. Satellites could be moved to empty spots in GEO, requiring less maneuvering and making it easier to predict future motion. Satellites or boosters in other orbits, especially stranded in geostationary transfer orbit, are an additional concern due to their typically high crossing velocity.

Despite efforts to reduce risk, spacecraft collisions have occurred. The European Space Agency telecom satellite Olympus-1 was struck by a meteoroid on 11 August 1993 and eventually moved to a graveyard orbit. On 29 March 2006, the Russian Express-AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable; its engineers had enough contact time with the satellite to send it into a graveyard orbit.

== Sources ==

=== Dead spacecraft ===


In 1958, the United States of America launched Vanguard I into a medium Earth orbit (MEO). , it, the upper stage of Vanguard 1&#x27;s launch rocket and associated piece of debris, are the oldest surviving artificial space objects still in orbit and are expected to be until after the year 2250. , the Union of Concerned Scientists listed 5,465 operational satellites from a known population of 27,000 pieces of orbital debris tracked by NORAD.

Occasionally satellites are left in orbit when they&#x27;re no longer useful. Many countries require that satellites go through passivation at the end of their life. The satellites are then either boosted into a higher, graveyard orbit or a lower, short-term orbit. Nonetheless, satellites that have been properly moved to a higher orbit have an eight-percent probability of puncture and coolant release over a 50-year period. The coolant freezes into droplets of solid sodium-potassium alloy, creating more debris.

Despite the use of passivation, or prior to its standardization, many satellites and rocket bodies have exploded or broken apart on orbit. In February 2015, for example, the USAF Defense Meteorological Satellite Program Flight 13 (DMSP-F13) exploded on orbit, creating at least 149 debris objects, which were expected to remain in orbit for decades. Later that same year, NOAA-16 which had been decommissioned after an anomaly in June 2014, broke apart on orbit into at least 275 pieces. For older programs, such as the Soviet-era Meteor 2 and Kosmos satellites, design flaws resulted in numerous break-upsat least 68 by 1994following decommissioning, resulting in more debris.

In addition to the accidental creation of debris, some has been made intentionally through the deliberate destruction of satellites. This has been done as a test of anti-satellite or anti-ballistic missile technology, or to prevent a sensitive satellite from being examined by a foreign power. The United States has conducted over 30 anti-satellite weapons tests (ASATs), the Soviet Union/Russia has performed at least 27, China has performed 10 and India has performed at least one. The most recent ASATs were the Chinese interception of FY-1C, Russian trials of its PL-19 Nudol, the American interception of USA-193 and India&#x27;s interception of an unstated live satellite.

=== Lost equipment ===

Space debris includes a glove lost by astronaut Ed White on the first American space-walk (EVA), a camera lost by Michael Collins near Gemini 10, a thermal blanket lost during STS-88, garbage bags jettisoned by Soviet cosmonauts during Mir&#x27;s 15-year life, a wrench, and a toothbrush. Sunita Williams of STS-116 lost a camera during an EVA. During an STS-120 EVA to reinforce a torn solar panel, a pair of pliers was lost, and in an STS-126 EVA, Heidemarie Stefanyshyn-Piper lost a briefcase-sized tool bag.

=== Boosters ===
A significant portion of debris is due to rocket upper stages (e.g. the Inertial Upper Stage) breaking up due to decomposition of unvented fuel. The first such instance involved the launch of the Transit-4a satellite in 1961. Two hours after insertion, the Ablestar upper stage exploded. Even boosters that don&#x27;t break apart can be a problem. A major known impact event involved an (intact) Ariane booster.

Although NASA and the United States Air Force now require upper-stage passivation, other launcherssuch as the Chinese and Russian space agenciesdo not. Lower stages, like the Space Shuttle&#x27;s solid rocket boosters or the Apollo program&#x27;s Saturn IB launch vehicles, do not reach orbit.

Examples:

* Two Japanese H-2A rockets broke up in 2006.
* A Russian Briz-M booster stage exploded in orbit over South Australia on 19 February 2007. Launched on 28 February 2006 carrying an Arabsat-4A communications satellite, it malfunctioned before it could use up its propellant. Although the explosion was captured on film by astronomers, due to the orbit path the debris cloud has been difficult to measure with radar. By 21 February 2007, over 1,000 fragments were identified. A 14 February 2007 breakup was recorded by Celestrak.
* Another Briz-M broke up on 16 October 2012 after a failed 6 August Proton-M launch. The amount and size of the debris was unknown.
*The second stage of the Zenit-2, called the SL-16 by western governments, along with the second stages of the Vostok and Kosmos launch vehicles, make up about 20% of the total mass of launch debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO). An analysis that determined the 50 &quot;statistically most concerning&quot; debris objects in low Earth orbit determined that the top 20 were all Zenit-2 upper stages.
*a Delta II rocket used to launch NASA&#x27;s 1989 COBE spacecraft exploded on December 3, 2006. This occurred even though its residual fuel had already been vented to space.
*In 2018–2019, three different Atlas V Centaur second stages broke up.
* In December 2020, scientists confirmed that a previously detected near-Earth object, 2020 SO, was rocket booster space junk launched in 1966 orbiting Earth and the Sun.
* At least eight Delta rockets have contributed orbital debris in the Sun-synchronous low Earth orbit environment. The variant of the Delta upper stage that was used in the 1970s was found to be prone to in-orbit explosions. Starting in 1981, depletion burnsto get rid of excess propellantbecame standard and no Delta Rocket Bodies launched after 1981 experienced severe fragmentations afterward, but some of those launched prior to 1981 continued to explode. In 1991, the Delta 1975-052B fragmented, 16 years after launch, demonstrating the resilience of the propellent.

=== Weapons ===
A former source of debris was anti-satellite weapons (ASATs) testing by the U.S. and Soviet Union during the 1960s and 1970s. North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) only collected data for Soviet tests, and debris from U.S. tests were identified subsequently. By the time the debris problem was understood, widespread ASAT testing had ended. The U.S. Program 437 was shut down in 1975.

The U.S. restarted their ASAT programs in the 1980s with the Vought ASM-135 ASAT. A 1985 test destroyed a satellite orbiting at , creating thousands of debris larger than . At this altitude, atmospheric drag decayed the orbit of most debris within a decade. A &quot;de facto&quot; moratorium followed the test.

China&#x27;s government was condemned for the military implications and the amount of debris from the 2007 anti-satellite missile test, the largest single space debris incident in history (creating over 2,300 pieces golf-ball size or larger, over 35,000 or larger, and one million pieces or larger). The target satellite orbited between and , the portion of near-Earth space most densely populated with satellites. Since atmospheric drag is low at that altitude, the debris is slow to return to Earth, and in June 2007 NASA&#x27;s Terra environmental spacecraft maneuvered to avoid impact from the debris. Brian Weeden, U.S. Air Force officer and Secure World Foundation staff member, noted that the 2007 Chinese satellite explosion created an orbital debris of more than 3,000 separate objects that then required tracking.

On 20 February 2008, the U.S. launched an SM-3 missile from the USS &quot;Lake Erie&quot; to destroy a defective U.S. spy satellite thought to be carrying of toxic hydrazine propellant. The event occurred at about , and the resulting debris has a perigee of or lower. The missile was aimed to minimize the amount of debris, which (according to Pentagon Strategic Command chief Kevin Chilton) had decayed by early 2009.

On 27 March 2019, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi announced that India shot down one of its own LEO satellites with a ground-based missile. He stated that the operation, part of &quot;Mission Shakti&quot;, would defend the country&#x27;s interests in space. Afterwards, US Air Force Space Command announced they were tracking 270 new pieces of debris but expected the number to grow as data collection continues.

On 15 November 2021, the Russian Defense Ministry destroyed Kosmos 1408 orbiting at around 450 km, creating &quot;more than 1,500 pieces of trackable debris and hundreds of thousands of pieces of un-trackable debris&quot; according to the US State Department.

The vulnerability of satellites to debris and the possibility of attacking LEO satellites to create debris clouds has triggered speculation that it is possible for countries unable to make a precision attack. An attack on a satellite of or more would heavily damage the LEO environment.

== Hazards ==
=== To spacecraft ===
Space junk can be a hazard to active satellites and spacecraft. It has been suggested that Earth orbit could even become impassable if the risk of collision becomes too great.

However, since the risk to spacecraft increases with exposure to high debris densities, it is more accurate to say that LEO would be rendered &quot;unusable&quot; by orbiting craft. The threat to craft &quot;passing through&quot; LEO to reach a higher orbit would be much lower owing to the short time span of the crossing.

==== Uncrewed spacecraft ====

Although spacecraft are typically protected by Whipple shields, solar panels, which are exposed to the Sun, wear from low-mass impacts. Even small impacts can produce a cloud of plasma which is an electrical risk to the panels.

Satellites are believed to have been destroyed by micrometeorites and (small) orbital debris (MMOD). The earliest suspected loss was of Kosmos 1275, which disappeared on 24 July 1981 (a month after launch). Kosmos contained no volatile fuel, therefore, there appeared to be nothing internal to the satellite which could have caused the destructive explosion which took place. However, the case has not been proven and another hypothesis forwarded is that the battery exploded. Tracking showed it broke up, into 300 objects.

Many impacts have been confirmed since. For example, on 24 July 1996, the French microsatellite Cerise was hit by fragments of an Ariane 1 H-10 upper-stage booster which exploded in November 1986. On 29 March 2006, the Russian Ekspress-AM11 communications satellite was struck by an unknown object and rendered inoperable. On 13 October 2009, Terra suffered a single battery cell failure anomaly and a battery heater control anomaly which were subsequently considered likely the result of an MMOD strike. On 12 March 2010, Aura lost power from one-half of one of its 11 solar panels and this was also attributed to an MMOD strike. On 22 May 2013, GOES 13 was hit by an MMOD which caused it to lose track of the stars that it used to maintain an operational attitude. It took nearly a month for the spacecraft to return to operation.

The first major satellite collision occurred on 10 February 2009. The derelict satellite Kosmos 2251 and the operational Iridium 33 collided, over northern Siberia. The relative speed of impact was about , or about . Both satellites were destroyed, creating thousands of pieces of new smaller debris, with legal and political liability issues unresolved even years later. On 22 January 2013, BLITS (a Russian laser-ranging satellite) was struck by debris suspected to be from the 2007 Chinese anti-satellite missile test, changing both its orbit and rotation rate.

Satellites sometimes perform Collision Avoidance Maneuvers and satellite operators may monitor space debris as part of maneuver planning. For example, in January 2017, the European Space Agency altered the orbit of one of its three Swarm mission spacecraft, based on data from the US Joint Space Operations Center, to lower the risk of collision from Cosmos-375, a derelict Russian satellite.

==== Crewed spacecraft ====

Crewed flights are particularly vulnerable to space debris conjunctions in the orbital path of the spacecraft. Occasional avoidance maneuvers or longer-term space debris wear have affected the space shuttle, the MIR space station, and the International Space Station.

===== Space Shuttle missions =====

From the early shuttle missions, NASA used NORAD space monitoring capabilities to assess the shuttle&#x27;s orbital path for debris. In the 1980s, this consumed a large proportion of NORAD capacity. The first collision-avoidance maneuver occurred during STS-48, in September,1991, a seven-second thruster burn to avoid debris from the derelict satellite Kosmos 955. Similar maneuvers were executed on missions 53, 72 and 82.

One of the earliest events to publicize the debris problem occurred on &#x27;s second flight, STS-7. A fleck of paint struck its front window, creating a pit over wide. On STS-59 in 1994, &quot;Endeavour&quot;&#x27;s front window was pitted about half its depth. Minor debris impacts increased from 1998.

Window chipping and minor damage to thermal protection system tiles (TPS) were already common by the 1990s. The Shuttle was later flown tail-first to take a greater proportion of the debris load on the engines and rear cargo bay, which are not used in orbit or during descent, and thus are less critical for post-launch operation. When flying attached to the ISS, a shuttle was flipped around so the better-armoured station shielded the orbiter.

A NASA 2005 study concluded that debris accounted for approximately half of the overall risk to the Shuttle. Executive-level decision to proceed was required if the catastrophic impact was more likely than 1 in 200. On a normal (low-orbit) mission to the ISS, the risk was approximately 1 in 300, but the Hubble telescope repair mission was flown at the higher orbital altitude of where the risk was initially calculated at a 1-in-185 (due in part to the 2009 satellite collision). A re-analysis with better debris numbers reduced the estimated risk to 1 in 221, and the mission went ahead.

Debris incidents continued on later Shuttle missions. During STS-115 in 2006, a fragment of circuit board bored a small hole through the radiator panels in &quot;Atlantis&quot;″s cargo bay. On STS-118 in 2007, debris blew a bullet-like hole through &quot;Endeavour&quot;″s radiator panel.

===== &quot;Mir&quot; =====
Impact wear was notable on the Soviet space station &quot;Mir&quot;, since it remained in space for long periods with its original solar module panels.

===== International Space Station =====
The ISS also uses Whipple shielding to protect its interior from minor debris. However, exterior portions (notably its solar panels) cannot be protected easily. In 1989, the ISS panels were predicted to degrade approximately 0.23% in four years due to the &quot;sandblasting&quot; effect of impacts with small orbital debris. An avoidance maneuver is typically performed for the ISS if &quot;there is a greater than one-in-10,000 chance of a debris strike&quot;. , there have been sixteen maneuvers in the fifteen years the ISS had been in orbit. By 2019, over 1,400 meteoroid and orbital debris (MMOD) impacts had been recorded on the ISS.

As another method to reduce the risk to humans on board, ISS operational management asked the crew to shelter in the Soyuz on three occasions due to late debris-proximity warnings. In addition to the sixteen thruster firings and three Soyuz-capsule shelter orders, one attempted maneuver was not completed due to not having the several days&#x27; warning necessary to upload the maneuver timeline to the station&#x27;s computer. A March 2009 event involved debris believed to be a piece of the Kosmos 1275 satellite. In 2013, the ISS operations management did not make a maneuver to avoid any debris, after making a record four debris maneuvers the previous year.

==== Kessler syndrome ====
The Kessler syndrome, proposed by NASA scientist Donald J. Kessler in 1978, is a theoretical scenario in which the density of objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) is high enough that collisions between objects could cause a cascade effect where each collision generates space debris that increases the likelihood of further collisions. He further theorized that one implication, if this were to occur, is that the distribution of debris in orbit could render space activities and the use of satellites in specific orbital ranges economically impractical for many generations.

The growth in the number of objects as a result of the late-1990s studies sparked debate in the space community on the nature of the problem and the earlier dire warnings. According to Kessler&#x27;s 1991 derivation and 2001 updates, the LEO environment in the altitude range should be cascading. However, only one major satellite collision incident occurred: the 2009 satellite collision between Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251. The lack of obvious short-term cascading has led to speculation that the original estimates overstated the problem. According to Kessler in 2010 however, a cascade may not be obvious until it is well advanced, which might take years.

=== On Earth ===

Although most debris burns up in the atmosphere, larger debris objects can reach the ground intact. According to NASA, an average of one cataloged piece of debris has fallen back to Earth each day for the past 50 years. Despite their size, there has been no significant property damage from the debris. Burning up in the atmosphere contributes to air pollution. Numerous small cylindrical tanks from space objects have been found, designed to hold fuel or gasses.

== Tracking and measurement ==
=== Tracking from the ground ===
Radar and optical detectors such as lidar are the main tools for tracking space debris. Although objects under have reduced orbital stability, debris as small as 1 cm can be tracked, however determining orbits to allow re-acquisition is difficult. Most debris remain unobserved. The NASA Orbital Debris Observatory tracked space debris with a liquid mirror transit telescope. FM Radio waves can detect debris, after reflecting off them onto a receiver. Optical tracking may be a useful early-warning system on spacecraft.

The U.S. Strategic Command keeps a catalog of known orbital objects, using ground-based radar and telescopes, and a space-based telescope (originally to distinguish from hostile missiles). The 2009 edition listed about 19,000 objects. Other data come from the ESA Space Debris Telescope, TIRA, the Goldstone, Haystack, and EISCAT radars and the Cobra Dane phased array radar, to be used in debris-environment models like the ESA Meteoroid and Space Debris Terrestrial Environment Reference (MASTER).

=== Measurement in space ===

Returned space hardware is a valuable source of information on the directional distribution and composition of the (sub-millimetre) debris flux. The LDEF satellite deployed by mission STS-41-C &quot;Challenger&quot; and retrieved by STS-32 &quot;Columbia&quot; spent 68 months in orbit to gather debris data. The EURECA satellite, deployed by STS-46 &quot;Atlantis&quot; in 1992 and retrieved by STS-57 &quot;Endeavour&quot; in 1993, was also used for debris study.

The solar arrays of Hubble were returned by missions STS-61 &quot;Endeavour&quot; and STS-109 &quot;Columbia&quot;, and the impact craters studied by the ESA to validate its models. Materials returned from Mir were also studied, notably the Mir Environmental Effects Payload (which also tested materials intended for the ISS).

=== Gabbard diagrams ===
A debris cloud resulting from a single event is studied with scatter plots known as Gabbard diagrams, where the perigee and apogee of fragments are plotted with respect to their orbital period. Gabbard diagrams of the early debris cloud prior to the effects of perturbations, if the data were available, are reconstructed. They often include data on newly observed, as yet uncatalogued fragments. Gabbard diagrams can provide insights into the features of the fragmentation, the direction and point of impact.

== Dealing with debris ==

An average of about one tracked object per day has been dropping out of orbit for the past 50 years, averaging almost three objects per day at solar maximum (due to the heating and expansion of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere), but one about every three days at solar minimum, usually five and a half years later. In addition to natural atmospheric effects, corporations, academics and government agencies have proposed plans and technology to deal with space debris, but , most of these are theoretical, and there is no business plan for debris reduction.

A number of scholars have also observed that institutional factorspolitical, legal, economic, and cultural &quot;rules of the game&quot;are the greatest impediment to the cleanup of near-Earth space. There is little commercial incentive to act, since costs are not assigned to polluters, though a number of technological solutions have been suggested. However, effects to date are limited. In the US, governmental bodies have been accused of backsliding on previous commitments to limit debris growth, &quot;let alone tackling the more complex issues of removing orbital debris.&quot; The different methods for removal of space debris have been evaluated by the Space Generation Advisory Council, including French astrophysicist Fatoumata Kébé.

In May 2024, a NASA report from the Office of Technology, Policy, and Strategy (OTPS) introduced new methods for addressing orbital debris. The report, titled &quot;Cost and Benefit Analysis of Mitigating, Tracking, and Remediating Orbital Debris&quot;, provided a comprehensive analysis comparing the cost-effectiveness of over ten different actions, including shielding spacecraft, tracking smaller debris, and removing large debris. By evaluating these measures in economic terms, the study aims to inform cost-effective strategies for debris management, highlighting that methods like rapid deorbiting of defunct spacecraft can significantly reduce risks in space.

=== National and international regulation ===

There is no international treaty minimizing space debris. However, the United Nations Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space (COPUOS) published voluntary guidelines in 2007, using a variety of earlier national regulatory attempts at developing standards for debris mitigation. As of 2008, the committee was discussing international &quot;rules of the road&quot; to prevent collisions between satellites. By 2013, a number of national legal regimes existed, typically instantiated in the launch licenses that are required for a launch in all spacefaring nations.

The U.S. issued a set of standard practices for civilian (NASA) and military (DoD and USAF) orbital-debris mitigation in 2001. The standard envisioned disposal for final mission orbits in one of three ways: 1) atmospheric reentry where even with &quot;conservative projections for solar activity, atmospheric drag will limit the lifetime to no longer than 25 years after completion of mission;&quot; 2) maneuver to a &quot;storage orbit:&quot; move the spacecraft to one of four very broad parking orbit ranges (, , above , or out of Earth orbit completely and into any heliocentric orbit; 3) &quot;Direct retrieval: Retrieve the structure and remove it from orbit as soon as practicable after completion of mission.&quot; The standard articulated in option 1, which is the standard applicable to most satellites and derelict upper stages, has come to be known as the &quot;25-year rule&quot;. The US updated the Orbital Debris Mitigation Standard Practices (ODMSP) in December 2019, but made no change to the 25-year rule even though &quot;[m]any in the space community believe that the timeframe should be less than 25 years.&quot; There is no consensus however on what any new timeframe might be.

In 2002, the European Space Agency (ESA) worked with an international group to promulgate a similar set of standards, also with a &quot;25-year rule&quot; applying to most Earth-orbit satellites and upper stages. Space agencies in Europe began to develop technical guidelines in the mid-1990s, and ASI, UKSA, CNES, DLR and ESA signed a &quot;European Code of Conduct&quot; in 2006, which was a predecessor standard to the ISO international standard work that would begin the following year. In 2008, ESA further developed &quot;its own &quot;Requirements on Space Debris Mitigation for Agency Projects&quot; which &quot;came into force on 1 April 2008.&quot;

Germany and France have posted bonds to safeguard property from debris damage. The &quot;direct retrieval&quot; option (option no. 3 in the US &quot;standard practices&quot; above) has rarely been done by any spacefaring nation (exception, USAF X-37) or commercial actor since the earliest days of spaceflight due to the cost and complexity of achieving direct retrieval, but the ESA has scheduled a 2026 demonstration mission (ClearSpace-1) to do this with a single small satellite (PROBA-1) at a projected cost of €120 million not including the launch costs.

By 2006, the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) had developed a number of technical means of debris mitigation (upper stage passivation, propellant reserves for movement to graveyard orbits, etc.) for ISRO launch vehicles and satellites, and was actively contributing to inter-agency debris coordination and the efforts of the UN COPUOS committee.
In 2007, the ISO began preparing an international standard for space-debris mitigation. By 2010, ISO had published &quot;a comprehensive set of space system engineering standards aimed at mitigating space debris. [with primary requirements] defined in the top-level standard, ISO 24113.&quot; By 2017, the standards were nearly complete. However, these standards are not binding on any party by ISO or any international jurisdiction. They are simply available for use in voluntary ways. They &quot;can be adopted voluntarily by a spacecraft manufacturer or operator, or brought into effect through a commercial contract between a customer and supplier, or used as the basis for establishing a set of national regulations on space debris mitigation.&quot;

The voluntary ISO standard also adopted the &quot;25-year rule&quot; for the &quot;LEO protected region&quot; below altitude that has been previously (and still is, ) used by the US, ESA, and UN mitigation standards, and identifies it as &quot;an upper limit for the amount of time that a space system shall remain in orbit after its mission is completed. Ideally, the time to deorbit should be as short as possible (i.e., much shorter than 25 years)&quot;.
Holger Krag of the European Space Agency states that as of 2017 there is no binding international regulatory framework with no progress occurring at the respective UN body in Vienna.

=== Growth mitigation ===

As of the 2010s, several technical approaches to the mitigation of the growth of space debris are typically undertaken, yet no comprehensive legal regime or cost assignment structure is in place to reduce space debris in the way that terrestrial pollution has reduced since the mid-20th century.

To avoid excessive creation of artificial space debris, manybut not allsatellites launched to above-low-Earth-orbit are launched initially into elliptical orbits with perigees inside Earth&#x27;s atmosphere so the orbit will quickly decay and the satellites then will be destroyed upon reentry into the atmosphere. Other methods are used for spacecraft in higher orbits. These include passivation of the spacecraft at the end of its useful life; as well as the use of upper stages that can reignite to decelerate the stage to intentionally deorbit it, often on the first or second orbit following payload release; satellites that can, if they remain healthy for years, deorbit themselves from the lower orbits around Earth. Other satellites (such as many CubeSats) in low orbits below approximately orbital altitude depend on the energy-absorbing effects of the upper atmosphere to reliably deorbit a spacecraft within weeks or months.

Increasingly, spent upper stages in higher orbitsorbits for which low-delta-v deorbit is not possible, or not planned forand architectures that support satellite passivation, are passivated at end of life. This removes any internal energy contained in the vehicle at the end of its mission or useful life. While this does not remove the debris of the now derelict rocket stage or satellite itself, it does substantially reduce the likelihood of the spacecraft destructing and creating many smaller pieces of space debris, a phenomenon that was common in many of the early generations of US and Soviet spacecraft.

Upper stage passivation (e.g. of Delta boosters) achieved by releasing residual propellants reduces debris from orbital explosions; however even as late as 2011, not all upper stages implement this practice. SpaceX used the term &quot;propulsive passivation&quot; for the final maneuver of their six-hour demonstration mission (STP-2) of the Falcon 9 second stage for the US Air Force in 2019, but did not define what all that term encompassed.

With a &quot;one-up, one-down&quot; launch-license policy for Earth orbits, launchers would rendezvous with, capture, and de-orbit a derelict satellite from approximately the same orbital plane. Another possibility is the robotic refueling of satellites. Experiments have been flown by NASA, and SpaceX is developing large-scale on-orbit propellant transfer technology.

Another approach to debris mitigation is to explicitly design the mission architecture to leave the rocket second-stage in an elliptical geocentric orbit with a low-perigee, thus ensuring rapid orbital decay and avoiding long-term orbital debris from spent rocket bodies. Such missions will often complete the payload placement in a final orbit by the use of low-thrust electric propulsion or with the use of a small kick stage to circularize the orbit. The kick stage itself may be designed with the excess-propellant capability to be able to self-deorbit.

=== Self-removal ===
Although the ITU requires geostationary satellites to move to a graveyard orbit at the end of their lives, the selected orbital areas do not sufficiently protect GEO lanes from debris. Rocket stages (or satellites) with enough propellant may make a direct, controlled de-orbit, or if this would require too much propellant, a satellite may be brought to an orbit where atmospheric drag would cause it to eventually de-orbit. This was done with the French Spot-1 satellite, reducing its atmospheric re-entry time from a projected 200 years to about 15 by lowering its altitude from to about .

The Iridium constellation – 95 communication satellites launched during the five-year period between 1997 and 2002 – provides a set of data points on the limits of self-removal. The satellite operator – Iridium Communications – remained operational over the two-decade life of the satellites (albeit with a company name change through a corporate bankruptcy during the period) and, by December 2019, had &quot;completed disposal of the last of its 65 working legacy satellites.&quot; However, this process left 30 satellites with a combined mass of (, or nearly a third of the mass of this constellation) in LEO orbits at approximately altitude, where self-decay is quite slow. Of these satellites, 29 simply failed during their time in orbit and were thus unable to self-deorbit, while one – Iridium 33 – was involved in the 2009 satellite collision with the derelict Russian military satellite Kosmos-2251. No contingency plan was laid for the removal of satellites that were unable to remove themselves. In 2019, the CEO of Iridium, Matt Desch, said that Iridium would be willing to pay an active-debris-removal company to deorbit its remaining first-generation satellites if it were possible for an unrealistically low cost, say &quot; per deorbit, but [he] acknowledged that price would likely be far below what a debris-removal company could realistically offer. &#x27;You know at what point [it&#x27;s] a no-brainer, but [I] expect the cost is really in the millions or tens of millions, at which price I know it doesn&#x27;t make sense.″&quot;

Passive methods of increasing the orbital decay rate of spacecraft debris have been proposed. Instead of rockets, an electrodynamic tether could be attached to a spacecraft at launch; at the end of its lifetime, the tether would be rolled out to slow the spacecraft. Other proposals include a booster stage with a sail-like attachment and a large, thin, inflatable balloon envelope.

In late December 2022, ESA successfully carried out a demonstration of a breaking sail-based satellite deorbiter, , which could be used by mitigation measures and is part of ESA&#x27;s Zero Debris Initiative. Around one year earlier, China also tested a drag sail.

=== External removal ===
A variety of approaches have been proposed, studied, or had ground subsystems built to use other spacecraft to remove existing space debris.

A consensus of speakers at a meeting in Brussels in October 2012, organized by the Secure World Foundation (a U.S. think tank) and the French International Relations Institute, reported that removal of the largest debris would be required to prevent the risk to spacecraft becoming unacceptable in the foreseeable future (without any addition to the inventory of dead spacecraft in LEO). To date in 2019, removal costs and legal questions about ownership and the authority to remove defunct satellites have stymied national or international action. Current space law retains ownership of all satellites with their original operators, even debris or spacecraft which are defunct or threaten active missions.

Multiple companies made plans in the late 2010s to conduct external removal on their satellites in mid-LEO orbits. For example, OneWeb planned to use onboard self-removal as &quot;plan A&quot; for satellite deorbiting at the end of life, but if a satellite were unable to remove itself within one year of end of life, OneWeb would implement &quot;plan B&quot; and dispatch a reusable (multi-transport mission) space tug to attach to the satellite at an already built-in capture target via a grappling fixture, to be towed to a lower orbit and released for re-entry.

==== Remotely controlled vehicles ====
A well-studied solution uses a remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with, capture, and return debris to a central station. One such system is Space Infrastructure Servicing, a commercially developed refueling depot and service spacecraft for communications satellites in geosynchronous orbit originally scheduled for a 2015 launch. The SIS would be able to &quot;push dead satellites into graveyard orbits.&quot; The Advanced Common Evolved Stage family of upper stages is being designed with a high leftover-propellant margin (for derelict capture and de-orbit) and in-space refueling capability for the high delta-v required to de-orbit heavy objects from geosynchronous orbit. A tug-like satellite to drag debris to a safe altitude for it to burn up in the atmosphere has been researched. When debris is identified the satellite creates a difference in potential between the debris and itself, then using its thrusters to move itself and the debris to a safer orbit.

A variation of this approach is for the remotely controlled vehicle to rendezvous with debris, capture it temporarily to attach a smaller de-orbit satellite and drag the debris with a tether to the desired location. The &quot;mothership&quot; would then tow the debris-smallsat combination for atmospheric entry or move it to a graveyard orbit. One such system is the proposed Busek ORbital DEbris Remover (ORDER), which would carry over 40 SUL (satellite on umbilical line) de-orbit satellites and propellant sufficient for their removal.

On 7 January 2010 Star, Incorporated reported that it received a contract from the Space and Naval Warfare Systems Command for a feasibility study of the ElectroDynamic Debris Eliminator (EDDE) propellantless spacecraft for space-debris removal. In February 2012 the Swiss Space Center at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne announced the Clean Space One project, a nanosatellite demonstration project for matching orbit with a defunct Swiss nanosatellite, capturing it and de-orbiting together. The mission has seen several evolutions to reach a pac-man inspired capture model. In 2013, Space Sweeper with Sling-Sat (4S), a grappling satellite which captures and ejects debris was studied. In 2022, a Chinese satellite, SJ-21, grabbed an unused satellite and &quot;threw&quot; it into an orbit with a lower risk for it to collide.

In December 2019, the European Space Agency awarded the first contract to clean up space debris. The €120 million mission dubbed ClearSpace-1 (a spinoff from the EPFL project) is slated to launch in 2026. It aims to remove the 94 kg PROBA-1 satellite from orbit. A &quot;chaser&quot; will grab the junk with four robotic arms and drag it down to Earth&#x27;s atmosphere where both will burn up.

==== Laser methods ====
The laser broom uses a ground-based laser to ablate the front of the debris, producing a rocket-like thrust that slows the object. With continued application, the debris would fall enough to be influenced by atmospheric drag. During the late 1990s, the U.S. Air Force&#x27;s Project Orion was a laser-broom design. Although a test-bed device was scheduled to launch on a Space Shuttle in 2003, international agreements banning powerful laser testing in orbit limited its use to measurements. The 2003 Space Shuttle &quot;Columbia&quot; disaster postponed the project and according to Nicholas Johnson, chief scientist and program manager for NASA&#x27;s Orbital Debris Program Office, &quot;There are lots of little gotchas in the Orion final report. There&#x27;s a reason why it&#x27;s been sitting on the shelf for more than a decade.&quot;

The momentum of the laser-beam photons could directly impart a thrust on the debris sufficient to move small debris into new orbits out of the way of working satellites. NASA research in 2011 indicates that firing a laser beam at a piece of space junk could impart an impulse of per second, and keeping the laser on the debris for a few hours per day could alter its course by per day. One drawback is the potential for material degradation; the energy may break up the debris, adding to the problem. A similar proposal places the laser on a satellite in Sun-synchronous orbit, using a pulsed beam to push satellites into lower orbits to accelerate their reentry. A proposal to replace the laser with an Ion Beam Shepherd has been made, and other proposals use a foamy ball of aerogel or a spray of water, inflatable balloons, electrodynamic tethers, electroadhesion, and dedicated anti-satellite weapons.

==== Nets ====
On 28 February 2014, Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) launched a test &quot;space net&quot; satellite. The launch was an operational test only. In December 2016 the country sent a space junk collector via Kounotori 6 to the ISS by which JAXA scientists experimented to pull junk out of orbit using a tether. The system failed to extend a 700-meter tether from a space station resupply vehicle that was returning to Earth. On 6 February the mission was declared a failure and leading researcher Koichi Inoue told reporters that they &quot;believe the tether did not get released&quot;.

Between 2012 and 2018, the European Space Agency was working on the design of a mission to remove large space debris from orbit using mechanical tentacles or nets. The mission, e.Deorbit, had an objective to remove debris heavier than from LEO. Several capture techniques were studied, including a net, a harpoon, and a combination robot arm and clamping mechanism. Funding of the mission was stopped in 2018 in favor of the ClearSpace-1 mission, which is currently under development.

==== Harpoon ====
The RemoveDEBRIS mission plan is to test the efficacy of several ADR technologies on mock targets in low Earth orbit. In order to complete its planned experiments the platform is equipped with a net, a harpoon, a laser ranging instrument, a dragsail, and two CubeSats (miniature research satellites). The mission was launched on 2 April 2018.

====Recycling space debris====
Metal processing technologies to melt space debris and transform it into other useful form factors are developed by CisLunar Industries. Their system uses electromagnetic heating to melt metal and shape it into metal wire, sheet metal, and metal fuel.

====Reusing space debris====

A propulsion system dubbed the Neumann Drive has been developed in Adelaide, South Australia, and first sent into space in June 2023. Metal space junk is converted into fuel rods, which can be plugged into the Neumann Drive, &quot;basically converting the solid metal propellant into plasma&quot;. The Drive will be used by American space companies which already carry nets or robotic arms to capture orbital waste. The thruster enables these satellites to return to Earth with the waste they have collected, allowing it to be melted down to make more fuel.

=== Barriers to dealing with debris===
With the rapid development of the computer and digitalization industries, more countries and companies have engaged in space activities since the turn of the 21st century. The tragedy of the commons is an economic theory referring to a situation where maximizing self-interest through using a shared resource can lead to the resource degradation shared by all. Based on the theory, individuals&#x27; rational action in space will lead to an irrational collective result: orbits crowded with debris. As a common-pool resource, the Earth&#x27;s orbits, especially LEO and GEO that accommodate most satellites, are nonexcludable and rivalrous.

To address the tragedy and ensure space sustainability, many technical approaches have been developed. In terms of governance mechanisms, a top-down centralized one is less suitable to tackle the complex debris problem due to the increasing number of space actors. Instead, a polycentric form of governance developed by Elinor Ostrom may work in space. In the process of promoting the polycentric network, there are some existing barriers needed to be dealt with.

==== Incomplete data of space debris ====
As orbital debris is a global problem affecting both spacefaring and non-spacefaring nations, it is necessary to be handled in a worldwide context. Because of the complexity and dynamics of object movements like spacecraft, debris, meteorites, etc., many countries and regions including the United States, Europe, Russia, and China have developed their space situational awareness (SSA) to avoid potential threats in space or plan actions in advance. To an extent, SSA plays a role in tracking space debris. In order to build a powerful SSA system, there are two prerequisites: international cooperation and exchange of information and data. However, limitations exist in spite of the improving data quality over the past decades. Some space powers are not willing to share the information that they have collected, and those, such as the U.S., that have shared the data keep parts of it secret. Instead of joining in a coordinated way, a great deal of SSA programs and national databases run parallel to each other with some overlaps, hindering the formation of a collaborative monitoring system.

Some private actors are also trying to establish SSA systems. For example, the Space Data Association (SDA) formed in 2009 is a non-governmental entity. It currently consists of 21 global satellite operators and 4 executive members: Eutelsat, Inmarsat, Intelsat, and SES. SDA is a non-profit platform, aiming to avoid radio interference and space collisions through pooling data from operators independently. Researchers suggest that it is essential to establish an international center for exchanging information on space debris because SSA networks do not completely equal debris tracking systemsthe former ones focus more on active and threatening objects in space. In terms of debris populations and defunct satellites, few operators have provided data.

In a polycentric governance network, a resource that cannot be holistically monitored is less likely to be well managed. Both insufficient transnational cooperation and information sharing bring resistance to addressing the debris problem. There is a long way to go to build a global network that covers complete data and has strong interconnection and interoperability.

==== Insufficient participation of private actors ====
With the commercialization of satellites and space, the private sector is getting more interested in space activities. For example, SpaceX is planning to create a network of around 12,000 small satellites that can transmit high-speed internet to any place in the world. The proportion of commercial spacecraft has increased from 4.6% in the 1980s to 55.6% in the 2010s. Despite the high participation rate of commercial entities, UN COPUOS once deliberately excluded them from having a voice in discussions unless being formally invited by a member state. Ostrom said that the involvement of all relevant stakeholders in the rule-design and implementation process is one of the critical elements of successful governance. The exclusion of private actors largely reduces the effectiveness of the committee&#x27;s role in making collective-choice arrangements that reflect the interests of all space users.

The limited engagement of private actors slows the process of addressing space debris. Ties between dissimilar stakeholders in the governance network offer access to diverse resources. Different competence among stakeholders can help allocate the tasks more reasonably. In that case, the expertise and experience of private operators are critical to help the world achieve space sustainability. The complementary strengths of different stakeholders enable the governance network to be more adaptable to changes and reach common goals more effectively. In recent years, many private actors have seen commercial opportunities of eliminating space debris. It is estimated that by 2022 the global market for debris monitoring and removal will generate a revenue of around $2.9 billion. For example, Astroscale has contracted with European and Japanese space agencies to develop the capacity of removing orbital debris. Despite that, they are still in small quantity compared to the number of those who have placed satellites in space. Privateer Space, a Hawaiian-based startup company by American engineer Alex Fielding, space environmentalist Moriba Jah, and Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, announced plans in September 2021 to launch hundreds of satellites into orbit in order to study space debris. However, the company stated it is in &quot;stealth mode&quot; and no such satellites have been launched.

Fortunately, the current space exploration is not completely driven by competition, and there still exists a chance for dialogues and cooperation among all stakeholders in both developed and developing countries, to reach an agreement on tackling space debris and assure an equitable and orderly exploration. Besides private actors, network governance does not necessarily exclude the states from playing a role. Instead, the different functions of states might promote the governance process. To improve the polycentric governance network of space debris, researchers suggest: encourage data-sharing among different national and organizational databases at the political level; develop shared standards for data collection systems to improve interoperability; and enhance the participation of private actors through involving them in national and international discussions.

==On other celestial bodies==
The issue of space debris has been raised as a mitigation challenge for missions around the Moon with the danger of increasing space debris around it.

It is thought that on 4 March 2022, for the first time, human space debris—most likely a spent rocket body, Long March 3C third stage from the 2014 Chang&#x27;e 5 T1 mission—unintentionally hit the lunar surface, creating an unexpected double crater.

In 2022, several elements of space debris were found on Mars: &quot;Perseverance&quot;&#x27;s backshell was found on the surface of Jezero Crater, and a piece of a thermal blanket which may have come from the descent stage of the rover.

, Mars is littered with about seven tons of human-made debris. Most of it consists of crashed and inactive spacecraft as well as discarded components.

==In popular culture==
&quot;Until the End of the World&quot; (1991) is a French sci-fi drama set under the backdrop of an out-of-control Indian nuclear satellite, predicted to re-enter the atmosphere, threatening vast populated areas of the Earth.

&quot;Gravity&quot;, a 2013 survival film directed by Alfonso Cuaron, is about a disaster on a space mission caused by Kessler syndrome.

In season 1 of &quot;Love, Death &amp; Robots&quot; (2019), episode 11, &quot;Helping Hand&quot;, revolves around an astronaut being struck by a screw from space debris which knocks her off a satellite in orbit.

Manga and anime &quot;Planetes&quot; tells a story about a crew of Space Debris station that collects and disposes of space debris.

Beside space debris as an issue of science-fiction stories other stories feature it as a reservoir for the story, as in stories about space junk scavengers like &quot;Space Sweepers&quot; (2021), or as a result or environment of the story.

The episode &quot;Conflict&quot; from Gerry and Sylvia Anderson&#x27;s &quot;U.F.O.&quot; sci-fi TV series shows how small alien spaceships could use Terrestrial space debris such as orbital boosters to become undetectable by &quot;SHADO&quot;&#x27;s orbital &quot;Space Intruder Detector&quot; (&quot;S.I.D.&quot;).

<text>Ke Huy Quan ( ; ; born August 20, 1971), also known as Jonathan Ke Quan, is an American actor. As a child actor, Quan rose to fame playing Short Round in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; (1984) and Data in &quot;The Goonies&quot; (1985). Following a few roles as a young adult in the 1990s, he took a 19-year acting hiatus, during which he worked as a stunt choreographer and assistant director. His accolades include a Golden Globe Award and an Academy Award.

Quan returned to acting with the family adventure film &quot;Finding ʻOhana&quot; (2021), followed by the critically acclaimed &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot; (2022), a performance that won him various accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. He is the first Vietnam-born actor to win an Academy Award. &quot;Time&quot; magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2023. He has since starred in the second season of the Disney+ series &quot;Loki&quot; in 2023.

==Early life==
Quan Kế Huy was born on August 20, 1971 in Saigon, South Vietnam, into a family of Chinese descent, with eight siblings. Three years after the end of the Vietnam war in 1975, Quan and his family fled from Vietnam. He, along with his father and five siblings, went to Hong Kong, while Quan&#x27;s mother and three other siblings went to Malaysia. After staying at a refugee camp in Hong Kong, Quan&#x27;s entire family was admitted to the United States as part of the Refugee Admissions Program in 1979. In the U.S., Quan grew up in California, where he attended the Mount Gleason Junior High School in Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles and Alhambra High School in Alhambra.

== Career ==
=== 1984–1999: Early career ===
Quan became a child actor at age 13, starring as Harrison Ford&#x27;s 12-year-old sidekick Short Round in the Steven Spielberg film &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot; in 1984. The casting director auditioned a number of children at Castelar Elementary School, including Quan&#x27;s younger brother. He described the role as &quot;one of the happiest times of my life&quot;. For his performance, he was nominated for the Saturn Award for Best Performance by a Younger Actor. In 1985, Quan co-starred in &quot;The Goonies&quot; as a member of the eponymous group of children, the inventor Richard &quot;Data&quot; Wang. He played a pickpocket orphan in the 1986 Taiwanese movie &quot;It Takes a Thief&quot;. In 1987, he appeared in the Japanese movie &quot;Passengers&quot; () with the Japanese idol singer Honda Minako. He played Sam on the short-lived TV series &quot;Together We Stand&quot; (1986–1987) and played Jasper Kwong in the sitcom &quot;Head of the Class&quot; from 1990 to 1991. In 1991, he starred in the movie &quot;Breathing Fire&quot;, and had a small role in &quot;Encino Man&quot; the following year. He played the starring role in the 1993 Mandarin-language Taiwan TV show &quot;Eunuch &amp; Carpenter,&quot; which ran for forty episodes. He also starred in the 1996 Hong Kong-Vietnam co-production &quot;Red Pirate&quot;.

He studied Taekwondo under Philip Tan on the set of &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;, and later trained under Tao-liang Tan.

=== 2000–2020: Acting sabbatical and other work ===
As an adult, Quan found it difficult to find acting work in the United States. He eventually quit acting and enrolled in the film program at University of Southern California. During his time there, he edited a comedy horror short film titled &quot;Voodoo&quot; alongside his friend and fellow student Gregg Bishop, who directed the film. &quot;Voodoo&quot; won the Audience Award at the 2000 Slamdance Film Festival, and continues to be shown to USC students to this day. After graduating from USC, Quan was asked by Corey Yuen to go to Toronto, Ontario, to help choreograph fighting sequences in &quot;X-Men&quot; (2000). For the next decade, he worked behind the scenes on various productions in Asia and the United States. He again helped Yuen as a stunt choreographer for &quot;The One&quot; (2001). Quan worked as assistant director on Wong Kar-wai&#x27;s &quot;2046&quot; (2004).

=== 2021–present: Return to acting ===
Quan was inspired to return to acting following the success of &quot;Crazy Rich Asians&quot; in 2018. In 2019, he was cast in a supporting role in the Netflix film &quot;Finding ʻOhana&quot;, released in 2021. Quan approached director Jude Weng after overhearing her describing the film as &quot;The Goonies&quot; meets &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;, in both of which Quan had appeared. That same year, the filmmaking duo Daniels began casting for their film &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;. They struggled to cast an actor in the role of Waymond Wang, a character who would appear in three different incarnations of the film. Co-director Daniel Kwan stumbled upon Quan on Twitter. Two weeks after getting a talent agent, Quan received a call to audition for the film. In January 2020, Quan was announced as a cast member of &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;. The film was released in March 2022 to overwhelming acclaim, becoming the most-awarded film of all time, with Quan&#x27;s performance receiving near unanimous praise and media attention, eventually leading to him winning a Golden Globe, a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Academy Award for his role. The Screen Actors Guild Award win made him the first Asian man to win any individual category at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, with his win of the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role. He was the first Vietnamese-American actor to be nominated in that category. Quan is one of two actors of Asian descent to win an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor, the other being Haing S. Ngor in 1985, and is the first Vietnamese-born actor to win an Academy Award.

In February 2022, it was announced that he had joined the cast of the TV adaptation of &quot;American Born Chinese&quot; for Disney+, which was subsequently released in May 2023. In September 2022, Quan was announced to have joined the cast for the second season of the Marvel Cinematic Universe series &quot;Loki&quot; for Disney+, which premiered on October 6, 2023. For his performance he received a Critics&#x27; Choice Television Award for Best Supporting Actor in a Drama Series nomination. In June 2023, it was announced that he had been invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences as an actor. He had a voice role in &quot;Kung Fu Panda 4&quot; (2024). Quan has later then starred in his first leading role in &quot;Love Hurts&quot; (2025), and is set to star in &quot;The Electric State&quot;, along side Millie Bobby Brown and Chris Pratt.

==Personal life==
Quan is of Han Chinese ancestry from the Hoa ethnic minority group of Vietnam. He is fluent in English, Vietnamese, Cantonese, and Mandarin. Quan is married to Echo Quan, who served as the on-set translator for &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;, and resides in Woodland Hills, Los Angeles. Quan holds a second-degree black belt in taekwondo; he started taking classes after learning from a taekwondo instructor for his role in &quot;Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom&quot;. He remains close friends with his &quot;Goonies&quot; co-star Jeff Cohen, who is also Quan&#x27;s entertainment lawyer and helped Quan negotiate his contract to star in &quot;Everything Everywhere All at Once&quot;.

<text>Assyrians are an indigenous ethnic group native to Mesopotamia, a geographical region in West Asia. Modern Assyrians claim descent directly from the ancient Assyrians, one of the key civilizations of Mesopotamia. While they are distinct from other Mesopotamian groups, such as the Babylonians, they share in the broader cultural heritage of the Mesopotamian region. Modern Assyrians may culturally self-identify as Syriacs, Chaldeans, or Arameans for religious, geographic, and tribal identification.

Assyrians speak Aramaic, specifically dialects such as Suret and Turoyo, which are among the oldest continuously spoken and written languages in the world. Aramaic was the lingua franca of West Asia for centuries and was the language spoken by Jesus. It has influenced other languages such as Hebrew and Arabic, and, through cultural and religious exchanges, it has had some influence on Mongolian and Uighur. Aramaic itself is the oldest continuously spoken and written language in the Middle East, with a history stretching back over 3,000 years.
Assyrians are almost exclusively Christian, with most adhering to the East and West Syriac liturgical rites of Christianity. Both rites use Classical Syriac as their liturgical language. The Assyrians were among the early converts to Christianity, along with Jews, Arameans, Armenians, Greeks, and Nabataeans.

The ancestral indigenous lands that form the Assyrian homeland are those of ancient Mesopotamia and the Zab rivers, a region currently divided between modern-day Iraq, southeastern Turkey, northwestern Iran, and northeastern Syria. A majority of modern Assyrians have migrated to other regions of the world, including North America, the Levant, Australia, Europe, Russia and the Caucasus. Emigration was triggered by genocidal events throughout the 19th and 20th centuries, including the Assyrian genocide or Sayfo, as well as religious persecution by Islamic extremists.

The emergence of the Islamic State and the occupation of a significant portion of the Assyrian homeland resulted in another major wave of Assyrian displacement due to events such as the 2003 invasion of Iraq by the United States and its allies, and the Syrian civil war, which began in 2011. Of the one million or more Iraqis who have fled Iraq since the occupation, nearly 40% were indigenous Assyrians, even though Assyrians accounted for only around 3% of the pre-war Iraqi population.

The Islamic State was driven out from the Assyrian villages in the Khabour River Valley and the areas surrounding the city of Al-Hasakah in Syria by 2015, and from the Nineveh Plains in Iraq by 2017. In 2014, the Nineveh Plain Protection Units was formed and many Assyrians joined the force to defend themselves. The organization later became part of Iraqi Armed forces and played a key role in liberating areas previously held by the Islamic State during the War in Iraq. In northern Syria, Assyrian groups have been taking part both politically and militarily in the Kurdish-dominated but multiethnic Syrian Democratic Forces (see Khabour Guards and Sutoro) and Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria.

== History ==
=== Pre-Christian history ===

Assyria is the homeland of the Assyrian people, located in the ancient Near East. The earliest Neolithic sites in Assyria belonged to the Jarmo culture c. 7100 BC and Tell Hassuna, the centre of the Hassuna culture, c. 6000 BC.

The history of Assyria begins with the formation of the city of Assur, perhaps as early as the 25th century BC. During the early Bronze Age period, Sargon of Akkad united all the native Semitic-speaking peoples, including the Assyrians, and the Sumerians of Mesopotamia under the Akkadian Empire (2335–2154 BC). The cities of Assur and Nineveh (modern-day Mosul), which was the oldest and largest city of the ancient Assyrian Empire, together with several other towns and cities, existed as early as the 25th century BC. They appear to have been Sumerian-ruled administrative centres at this time rather than independent states. The Sumerians were eventually absorbed into the Akkadian (Assyro-Babylonian) population. An Assyrian identity distinct from other neighboring groups appears to have formed during the Old Assyrian period, in the 21st or 20th century BC.
In the traditions of the Assyrian Church of the East, they are descended from Abraham&#x27;s grandson, Dedan son of Jokshan, progenitor of the ancient Assyrians. However, there is no other historical basis for this assertion. The Hebrew Bible does not directly mention it, and there is no mention in Assyrian records, which date as far back as the 25th century BC. What is known is that Ashur-uballit I overthrew the Mitanni c. 1365 BC and the Assyrians benefited from this development by taking control of the eastern portion of Mitanni territory and later annexing Hittite, Babylonian, Amorite and Hurrian territories. The rise and rule of the Middle Assyrian Empire (14th to 10th century BC) spread Assyrian culture, people and identity across northern Mesopotamia.

The Assyrian people, after the fall of the Neo-Assyrian Empire in 609 BC, were under the control of the Neo-Babylonian Empire and later, the Persian Empire, which consumed the entire Neo-Babylonian or &quot;Chaldean&quot; Empire in 539 BC. Assyrians became front line soldiers for the Persian Empire under Xerxes I, playing a significant role in the Battle of Marathon under Darius I in 490 BC. However, Herodotus, whose &quot;Histories&quot; are the primary source of information about that battle, makes no mention of Assyrians in connection with it.

Despite the influx of foreign elements, the presence of Assyrians is confirmed by the worship of the god Ashur. References to the name survive into the 3rd century AD. The Greeks, Parthians, and Romans had a relatively low level of integration with the local population in Mesopotamia, which allowed their cultures to survive. Semi-independent kingdoms influenced by Assyrian culture (Hatra, Adiabene, Osroene) and perhaps semi-autonomous Assyrian vassal states (Assur) sprung up in the east under Parthian rule, lasting until conquests by the Sasanian Empire in the region in the 3rd century AD.

====Language====
Modern Assyrian derives from ancient Aramaic, part of the Northwest Semitic languages. Around 700 BC, Aramaic slowly replaced Akkadian in Assyria, Babylonia and the Levant. Widespread bilingualism among Assyrian nationals was already present before the fall of the Empire. The Akkadian language has influenced the Aramaic that the modern Assyrians speak.

The Kültepe texts, which were written in Old Assyrian, preserve some loanwords from the Hittite language. Those loanwords are the earliest attestation of any Indo-European language, dated to the 20th century BC. Most of the archaeological evidence is typical of Anatolia rather than of Assyria, but using both cuneiform and the dialect is the best indication of Assyrian presence. Over 20,000 cuneiform tablets have been recovered from the site.

From 1700 BC and onward, the Sumerian language was preserved by the ancient Babylonians and Assyrians only as a liturgical and classical language for religious, artistic, and scholarly purposes.

The Akkadian language, with its main dialects of Assyrian and Babylonian, once the lingua franca of the Ancient Near East, began to decline during the Neo-Assyrian Empire around the 8th century BC, being marginalized by Old Aramaic during the reign of Tiglath-Pileser III. By the Hellenistic period, the language was largely confined to scholars and priests working in temples in Assyria and Babylonia.

===Early Christian period===

From the 1st century BC, Assyria was the theatre of the protracted Roman–Persian Wars. Much of the region would become the Roman province of Assyria from 116 AD to 118 AD following the conquests of Trajan. Still, after a Parthian-inspired Assyrian rebellion, the new emperor Hadrian withdrew from the short-lived province Assyria and its neighboring provinces in 118 AD. Following a successful campaign in 197–198, Severus converted the kingdom of Osroene, centred on Edessa, into a frontier Roman province. Roman influence in the area came to an end under Jovian in 363, who abandoned the region after concluding a hasty peace agreement with the Sassanians.

The Assyrians were Christianized in the first to third centuries in Roman Syria and Roman Assyria. The population of the Sasanian province of Asoristan was a mixed one, composed of Assyrians, Arameans in the far south and the western deserts, and Persians. The Greek element in the cities, still strong during the Parthian Empire, ceased to be ethnically distinct in Sasanian times. Most of the population were Eastern Aramaic speakers.

Along with the Arameans, Armenians, Greeks, and Nabataeans, the Assyrians were among the first people to convert to Christianity and spread Eastern Christianity to the Far East despite becoming, from the 8th century, a minority religion in their homeland following the Muslim conquest of Persia.

In 410, the Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, the capital of the Sasanian Empire, organised the Christians within that Empire into what became known as the Church of the East. Its head was declared to be the bishop of Seleucia-Ctesiphon, who in the acts of the council was referred to as the Grand or Major Metropolitan and who soon afterward was called the Catholicos of the East. Later, the title of Patriarch was also used. Dioceses were organised into provinces, each of which was under the authority of a metropolitan bishop. Six such areas were instituted in 410.

Another council held in 424 declared that the Catholicos of the East was independent of &quot;Western&quot; ecclesiastical authorities (those of the Roman Empire).

Soon afterward, Christians in the Roman Empire were divided by their attitude regarding the Council of Ephesus (431), which condemned Nestorianism, and the Council of Chalcedon (451), which condemned Monophysitism. Those who for any reason refused to accept one or other of these councils were called Nestorians or Monophysites, while those who accepted both councils, held under the auspices of the Roman emperors, were called Melkites (derived from Syriac &quot;malkā&quot;, king), meaning royalists.

All three groups existed among the Syriac Christians, the East Syriacs being called Nestorians and the West Syriacs being divided between the Monophysites (today the Syriac Orthodox Church, also known as Jacobites, after Jacob Baradaeus) and those who accepted both councils, primarily today&#x27;s Eastern Orthodox Church, which has adopted the Byzantine Rite in Greek, but also the Maronite Church, which kept its West Syriac Rite and was not as closely aligned with Constantinople.

Roman/Byzantine and Persian spheres of influence divided Syriac-speaking Christians into two groups: those who adhered to the Miaphysite Syriac Orthodox Church (the so-called Jacobite Church), or West Syrians, and those who adhered to the Church of the East, the so-called Nestorian Church. Following the split, they developed distinct dialects, mainly based on the pronunciation and written symbolization of vowels. With the rise of Syriac Christianity, eastern Aramaic enjoyed a renaissance as a classical language in the 2nd to 8th centuries, and varieties of that form of Aramaic (Neo-Aramaic languages) are still spoken by a few small groups of Jacobite and Nestorian Christians in the Middle East.

Theodora, who lived from April 1, 527 A.D. to June 28, 548 A.D., was a notable empress of the Byzantine Empire and the wife of Emperor Justinian I. Although her exact ethnic background is not definitively established, some sources suggest she was of Assyrian origin. She played a significant role in advocating for women&#x27;s rights and social reforms. Theodora is particularly remembered for her efforts to improve the status of women, including legislation against forced prostitution and support for widows and orphans. She was a key supporter of her husband&#x27;s efforts to restore and expand the Byzantine Empire from their capital, Constantinople. Additionally, Theodora worked towards alleviating the persecution of Miaphysites, although full reconciliation with this Christian sect was not achieved during her lifetime.

=== Arab conquest ===
The Assyrians initially experienced periods of religious and cultural freedom interspersed with periods of severe religious and ethnic persecution after the 7th century Muslim conquest of Persia. Assyrians contributed to Islamic civilizations during the Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates by translating works of Greek philosophers to Syriac and afterward to Arabic. They also excelled in philosophy, science (Masawaiyh, Eutychius of Alexandria, and Jabril ibn Bukhtishu) and theology (such as Tatian, Bardaisan, Babai the Great, Nestorius, and Thomas of Marga) and the personal physicians of the Abbasid Caliphs were often Assyrians, such as the long-serving Bukhtishu dynasty. Many scholars of the House of Wisdom were of Assyrian Christian background.

Indigenous Assyrians became second-class citizens (&quot;dhimmi&quot;) in a greater Arab Islamic state. Those who resisted Arabization and conversion to Islam were subject to severe religious, ethnic, and cultural discrimination and had certain restrictions imposed upon them. Assyrians were excluded from specific duties and occupations reserved for Muslims. They did not enjoy the same political rights as Muslims, and their word was not equal to that of a Muslim in legal and civil matters. As Christians, they were subject to payment of a special tax, the jizya.

They were banned from spreading their religion further or building new churches in Muslim-ruled lands, but were expected to adhere to the same laws of property, contract, and obligation as the Muslim Arabs. They could not seek the conversion of a Muslim, a non-Muslim man could not marry a Muslim woman, and the child of such a marriage would be considered a Muslim. They could not own an enslaved Muslim and had to wear different clothing from Muslims to be distinguishable. In addition to the jizya tax, they were required to pay the kharaj tax on their land, which was heavier than the jizya. However, they were protected, given religious freedom, and to govern themselves according to their own laws.
As non-Islamic proselytising was punishable by death under Sharia, the Assyrians were forced into preaching in Transoxiana, Central Asia, India, Mongolia and China where they established numerous churches. The Church of the East was considered to be one of the major Christian powerhouses in the world, alongside Latin Christianity in Europe and the Byzantine Empire (Greek Orthodoxy).

From the 7th century AD onwards, Mesopotamia saw a steady influx of Arabs, Kurds and other Iranian peoples, and later Turkic peoples. Assyrians were increasingly marginalized, persecuted and gradually became a minority in their homeland. Conversion to Islam was a result of heavy taxation, which also resulted in decreased revenue from their rulers. As a result, the new converts migrated to Muslim garrison towns nearby.

Assyrians remained dominant in Upper Mesopotamia as late as the 14th century, and the city of Assur was still occupied by Assyrians during the Islamic period until the mid-14th century when the Muslim Turco-Mongol ruler Timur conducted a religiously motivated massacre against Assyrians. After, no records of Assyrians remained in Assur according to the archaeological and numismatic record. From this point, the Assyrian population was dramatically reduced in their homeland.

From the 19th century, after the rise of nationalism in the Balkans, the Ottomans started viewing Assyrians and other Christians on their eastern front as a potential threat. The Kurdish Emirs sought to consolidate their power by attacking Assyrian communities, which were already well-established there. Scholars estimate that tens of thousands of Assyrians in the Hakkari region were massacred in 1843 when Bedr Khan Beg, the emir of Bohtan, invaded their region. After a later massacre in 1846, western powers forced the Ottomans into intervening in the region, and the ensuing conflict destroyed the Kurdish emirates and reasserted the Ottoman power in the area. The Assyrians were subject to the massacres of Diyarbakır soon after.

Being culturally, ethnically, and linguistically distinct from their Muslim neighbors in the Middle East—the Arabs, Persians, Kurds, Turks—the Assyrians have endured much hardship throughout their recent history as a result of religious and ethnic persecution by these groups.

===Mongolian and Turkic rule===

After initially coming under the control of the Seljuk Empire and the Buyid dynasty, the region eventually came under the control of the Mongol Empire after the fall of Baghdad in 1258. The Mongol khans were sympathetic with Christians and did not harm them. The most prominent among them was probably Isa Kelemechi, a diplomat, astrologer, and head of the Christian affairs in Yuan China. He spent some time in Persia under the Ilkhanate.

The 14th century massacres of Timur devastated the Assyrian people. Timur&#x27;s massacres and pillages of all that was Christian drastically reduced their existence. At the end of the reign of Timur, the Assyrian population had almost been eradicated in many places. Toward the end of the thirteenth century, Bar Hebraeus, the noted Assyrian scholar and hierarch, found &quot;much quietness&quot; in his diocese in Mesopotamia. Syria&#x27;s diocese, he wrote, was &quot;wasted.&quot;

The region was later controlled by the in Iran-based Turkic confederations of the Aq Qoyunlu and Kara Koyunlu. Subsequently, all Assyrians, like with the rest of the ethnicities living in the former Aq Qoyunlu territories, fell into Safavid hands from 1501 and on.

=== From Iranian Safavid to confirmed Ottoman rule ===

The Ottomans secured their control over Mesopotamia and Syria in the first half of the 17th century following the Ottoman–Safavid War (1623–39) and the resulting Treaty of Zuhab. Non-Muslims were organised into millets. Syriac Christians, however, were often considered one millet alongside Armenians until the 19th century, when Nestorian, Syriac Orthodox and Chaldeans gained that right as well.

The Aramaic-speaking Mesopotamian Christians had long been divided between followers of the Church of the East, commonly referred to as &quot;Nestorians&quot;, and followers of the Syriac Orthodox Church, commonly called Jacobites. The latter were organised by Marutha of Tikrit (565–649) as 17 dioceses under a &quot;Metropolitan of the East&quot; or &quot;Maphrian&quot;, holding the highest rank in the Syriac Orthodox Church after that of the Syriac Orthodox Patriarch of Antioch and All the East. The Maphrian resided at Tikrit until 1089, when he moved to the city of Mosul for half a century, before settling in the nearby Monastery of Mar Mattai (still belonging to the Syriac Orthodox Church) and thus not far from the residence of the Eliya line of Patriarchs of the Church of the East. From 1533, the holder of the office was known as the Maphrian of Mosul, to distinguish him from the Maphrian of the Patriarch of Tur Abdin.

In 1552, a group of bishops of the Church of the East from the northern regions of Amid and Salmas, who were dissatisfied with reservation of patriarchal succession to members of a single family, even if the designated successor was little more than a child, elected as a rival patriarch the abbot of the Rabban Hormizd Monastery, Yohannan Sulaqa. This was by no means the first schism in the Church of the East. An example is the attempt to replace Timothy I (779–823) with Ephrem of Gandīsābur.

By tradition, a patriarch could be ordained only by someone of archiepiscopal (metropolitan) rank, a rank to which only members of that one family were promoted. For that reason, Sulaqa travelled to Rome, where, presented as the new Patriarch elect, he entered communion with the Catholic Church and was ordained by the Pope and recognized as Patriarch. The title or description under which he was recognized as Patriarch is given variously as &quot;Patriarch of Mosul in Eastern Syria&quot;; &quot;Patriarch of the Church of the Chaldeans of Mosul&quot;; &quot;Patriarch of the Chaldeans&quot;; &quot;Patriarch of Mosul&quot;; or &quot;Patriarch of the Eastern Assyrians&quot;, this last being the version given by Pietro Strozzi on the second-last unnumbered page before page 1 of his &quot;De Dogmatibus Chaldaeorum&quot;, of which an English translation is given in Adrian Fortescue&#x27;s &quot;Lesser Eastern Churches&quot;.

Mar Shimun VIII Yohannan Sulaqa returned to northern Mesopotamia in the same year and fixed his seat in Amid. Before being imprisoned for four months and then in January 1555 put to death by the governor of Amadiya at the instigation of the rival Patriarch of Alqosh, of the &quot;Eliya line&quot;, he ordained two metropolitans and three other bishops, thus beginning a new ecclesiastical hierarchy: the patriarchal line known as the &quot;Shimun line&quot;. The area of influence of this patriarchate soon moved from Amid east, fixing the see, after many changes, in the isolated village of Qochanis.

The &quot;Shimun line&quot; eventually drifted away from Rome and in 1662 adopted a profession of faith incompatible with that of Rome. Leadership of those who wished communion with Rome passed to the Archbishop of Amid Joseph I, recognized first by the Turkish civil authorities (1677) and then by Rome itself (1681). A century and a half later, in 1830, headship of the Catholics (the Chaldean Catholic Church) was conferred on Yohannan Hormizd, a member of the family that for centuries had provided the patriarchs of the legitimist &quot;Eliya line&quot;, who had won over most of the followers of that line. Thus the patriarchal line of those who in 1553 entered communion with Rome are now patriarchs of the &quot;traditionalist&quot; wing of the Church of the East, that which in 1976 officially adopted the name &quot;Assyrian Church of the East&quot;.

In the 1840s many of the Assyrians living in the mountains of Hakkari in the south eastern corner of the Ottoman Empire were massacred by the Kurdish emirs of Hakkari and Bohtan.

Another major massacre of Assyrians (and Armenians) in the Ottoman Empire occurred between 1894 and 1897 by Turkish troops and their Kurdish allies during the rule of Sultan Abdul Hamid II. The motives for these massacres were an attempt to reassert Pan-Islamism in the Ottoman Empire, resentment at the comparative wealth of the ancient indigenous Christian communities, and a fear that they would attempt to secede from the tottering Ottoman Empire. Assyrians were massacred in Diyarbakir, Hasankeyef, Sivas and other parts of Anatolia, by Sultan Abdul Hamid II. These attacks caused the death of over thousands of Assyrians and the forced &quot;Ottomanisation&quot; of the inhabitants of 245 villages. The Turkish troops looted the remains of the Assyrian settlements and these were later stolen and occupied by Kurds. Unarmed Assyrian women and children were raped, tortured and murdered.

==== World War I and aftermath ====


The Assyrians suffered a number of religiously and ethnically motivated massacres throughout the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, culminating in the large-scale Hamidian massacres of unarmed men, women and children by Muslim Turks and Kurds in the late 19th century at the hands of the Ottoman Empire and its associated (largely Kurdish and Arab) militias, which further greatly reduced numbers, particularly in southeastern Turkey.

The most significant recent persecution against the Assyrian population was the Assyrian genocide which occurred during the First World War. Between 275,000 and 300,000 Assyrians were estimated to have been slaughtered by the armies of the Ottoman Empire and their Kurdish allies, totalling up to two-thirds of the entire Assyrian population.

This led to a large-scale migration of Turkish-based Assyrian people into countries such as Syria, Iran, and Iraq (where they were to suffer further violent assaults at the hands of the Arabs and Kurds), as well as other neighbouring countries in and around the Middle East such as Armenia, Georgia and Russia.

During World War I (Sayfo), the Assyrians suffered heavy losses due to deportations and mass killings organized by the Ottoman Turks. Several representatives of the Assyrian people participated in the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 after the war had ended. These representatives aimed to free Assyria and sought to influence the victorious powers to place it under one mandatory power. Although many felt sympathy for the Assyrians, none of their demands were implemented. The Assyrians failed in their efforts due to geographical and denominational differences among themselves, as well as the fact that the major powers, Britain and France, had their own plans for the territories where the Assyrians lived.

====Assyrian volunteers====
In reaction to the Assyrian Genocide and lured by British and Russian promises of an independent nation, the Assyrians led by Agha Petros and Malik Khoshaba of the Bit-Tyari tribe, fought alongside the Allies against Ottoman forces known as the Assyrian volunteers or Our Smallest Ally. Despite being heavily outnumbered and outgunned the Assyrians fought successfully, scoring a number of victories over the Turks and Kurds. This situation continued until their Russian allies left the war, and Armenian resistance broke, leaving the Assyrians surrounded, isolated and cut off from lines of supply. The sizable Assyrian presence in south eastern Anatolia which had endured for over four millennia was thus reduced significantly by the end of World War I.

====Assyrian rebellion====

The Assyrian rebellion was an uprising by the Assyrians in Hakkari that began on the 3rd of September 1924 and ended on the 28th of September. The Assyrians of Tyari and Tkhuma returned to their ancestral land in Hakkari in 1922, shortly after World War I without permission from the Turkish government. This led to clashes between the Assyrians and the Turkish army with their Kurdish allies that grew into a rebellion in 1924, it ended with the Assyrians being forced to retreat to Iraq.

=== Modern history ===
The majority of Assyrians living in what is today modern Turkey were forced to flee to either Syria or Iraq after the Turkish victory during the Turkish War of Independence. In 1932, Assyrians refused to become part of the newly formed state of Iraq and instead demanded their recognition as a nation within a nation. The Assyrian leader Shimun XXI Eshai asked the League of Nations to recognize the right of the Assyrians to govern the area known as the &quot;Assyrian triangle&quot; in northern Iraq. During the French mandate period, some Assyrians, fleeing ethnic cleansings in Iraq during the Simele massacre, established numerous villages along the Khabur River during the 1930s.

The Assyrian Levies were founded by the British in 1928, with ancient Assyrian military rankings such as Rab-shakeh, Rab-talia and Tartan, being revived for the first time in millennia for this force. The Assyrians were prized by the British rulers for their fighting qualities, loyalty, bravery and discipline, and were used to help the British put down insurrections among the Arabs and Kurds. During World War II, eleven Assyrian companies saw action in Palestine and another four served in Cyprus. The Parachute Company was attached to the Royal Marine Commando and were involved in fighting in Albania, Italy and Greece. The Assyrian Levies played a major role in subduing the pro-Nazi Iraqi forces at the battle of Habbaniya in 1941.

However, this cooperation with the British was viewed with suspicion by some leaders of the newly formed Kingdom of Iraq. The tension reached its peak shortly after the formal declaration of independence when hundreds of Assyrian civilians were slaughtered during the Simele massacre by the Iraqi Army in August 1933. The events lead to the expulsion of Shimun XXI Eshai the Catholicos Patriarch of the Assyrian Church of the East to the United States where resided until his death in 1975.

The period from the 1940s through to 1963 saw a period of respite for the Assyrians. The regime of President Abd al-Karim Qasim in particular saw the Assyrians accepted into mainstream society. Many urban Assyrians became successful businessmen, others were well represented in politics and the military, their towns and villages flourished undisturbed, and Assyrians came to excel, and be over represented in sports.

The Ba&#x27;ath Party seized power in Iraq and Syria in 1963, introducing laws aimed at suppressing the Assyrian national identity via arabization policies. The giving of traditional Assyrian names was banned and Assyrian schools, political parties, churches and literature were repressed. Assyrians were heavily pressured into identifying as &quot;Iraqi Christians&quot; or &quot;Syrian Christians&quot;. Assyrians were not recognized as an ethnic group by the governments and they fostered divisions among Assyrians along religious lines (e.g. Assyrian Church of the East vs. Chaldean Catholic Church vs Syriac Orthodox Church).

In response to Baathist persecution, the Assyrians of the Zowaa movement within the Assyrian Democratic Movement took up armed struggle against the Iraqi government in 1982 under the leadership of Yonadam Kanna, and then joined up with the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front in the early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna in particular was a target of the Saddam Hussein Ba&#x27;ath government for many years.

The Anfal campaign of 1986–1989 in Iraq, which was intended to target Kurdish opposition, resulted in 2,000 Assyrians being murdered through its gas campaigns. Over 31 towns and villages, 25 Assyrian monasteries and churches were razed to the ground. Some Assyrians were murdered, others were deported to large cities, and their lands and homes then being appropriated by Arabs and Kurds.

However, comparing to Syria, the Ba&#x27;athist government in Iraq was not as repressive as Syria. Saddam Hussein had an Assyrian Deputy Prime Minister and foreign minister, who was Tariq Aziz. There were also many Assyrians, who were offered high positions in the government.

==== 21st century ====
After the 2003 Invasion of Iraq by US and its allies, the Coalition Provisional Authority disbanded the Iraqi military, security, and intelligence infrastructure of former President Saddam Hussein and began a process of &quot;de-Baathification&quot;. This process became an object of controversy, cited by some critics as the biggest American mistake made in the immediate aftermath of the Invasion of Iraq, and as one of the main causes in the deteriorating security situation throughout Iraq.

Social unrest and chaos resulted in the unprovoked persecution of Assyrians in Iraq mostly by Islamic extremists (both Shia and Sunni) and Kurdish nationalists (ex. Dohuk Riots of 2011 aimed at Assyrians &amp; Yazidis). In places such as Dora, a neighborhood in southwestern Baghdad, the majority of its Assyrian population has either fled abroad or to northern Iraq, or has been murdered. Islamic resentment over the United States&#x27; occupation of Iraq, and incidents such as the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; Muhammad cartoons and the Pope Benedict XVI Islam controversy, have resulted in Muslims attacking Assyrian communities. Since the start of the Iraq war, at least 46 churches and monasteries have been bombed.

In recent years, the Assyrians in northern Iraq and northeast Syria have become the target of extreme unprovoked Islamic terrorism. As a result, Assyrians have taken up arms alongside other groups, such as the Kurds, Turcomans and Armenians, in response to unprovoked attacks by Al Qaeda, the Islamic State (ISIL), Nusra Front and other terrorist Islamic Fundamentalist groups. In 2014 Islamic terrorists of ISIL attacked Assyrian towns and villages in the Assyrian Homeland of northern Iraq, together with cities such as Mosul and Kirkuk which have large Assyrian populations. There have been reports of atrocities committed by ISIL terrorists since, including; beheadings, crucifixions, child murders, rape, forced conversions, ethnic cleansing, robbery, and extortion in the form of illegal taxes levied upon non-Muslims. Assyrians in Iraq have responded by forming armed militias to defend their territories.

In response to the Islamic State&#x27;s invasion of the Assyrian homeland in 2014, many Assyrian organizations also formed their own independent fighting forces to combat ISIL and potentially retake their &quot;ancestral lands.&quot; These include the Nineveh Plain Protection Units, Dwekh Nawsha, and the Nineveh Plain Forces. The latter two of these militias were eventually disbanded.
In Syria, the &quot;Dawronoye&quot; modernization movement has influenced Assyrian identity in the region. The largest proponent of the movement, the Syriac Union Party (SUP) has become a major political actor in the Democratic Federation of Northern Syria. In August 2016, the &quot;Ourhi Centre&quot; in the city of Zalin was started by the Assyrian community, to educate teachers in order to make Syriac an optional language of instruction in public schools, which then started with the 2016/17 academic year. With that academic year, states the Rojava Education Committee, &quot;three curriculums have replaced the old one, to include teaching in three languages: Kurdish, Arabic and Assyrian.&quot; Associated with the SUP is the Syriac Military Council, an Assyrian militia operating in Syria, established in January 2013 to protect and stand up for the national rights of Assyrians in Syria as well as working together with the other communities in Syria to change the current government of Bashar al-Assad. However, many Assyrians and the organizations that represent them, particularly those outside of Syria, are critical of the Dawronoye movement.

A 2018 report stated that Kurdish authorities in Syria, in conjunction with Dawronoye officials, had shut down several Assyrian schools in Northern Syria and fired their administration. This was said to be because these schooled failed to register for a license and for rejecting the new curriculum approved by the Education Authority. Closure methods ranged from officially shutting down schools to having armed men enter the schools and shut them down forcefully. An Assyrian educator named Isa Rashid was later badly beaten outside of his home for rejecting the Kurdish self-administration&#x27;s curriculum.
The Assyrian Policy Institute claimed that an Assyrian reporter named Souleman Yusph was arrested by Kurdish forces for his reports on the Dawronoye-related school closures in Syria. Specifically, he had shared numerous photographs on Facebook detailing the closures.

== Demographics ==

=== Homeland ===

The Assyrian homeland includes the ancient cities of Nineveh (Mosul), Nuhadra (Dohuk), Arrapha/Beth Garmai (Kirkuk), Al Qosh, Tesqopa and Arbela (Erbil) in Iraq, Urmia in Iran, and Hakkari (a large region which comprises the modern towns of Yüksekova, Hakkâri, Çukurca, Şemdinli and Uludere), Edessa/Urhoy (Urfa), Harran, Amida (Diyarbakır) and Tur Abdin (Midyat and Kafro) in Turkey, among others. Some of the cities are presently under Kurdish control and some still have an Assyrian presence, namely those in Iraq, as the Assyrian population in southeastern Turkey (such as those in Hakkari) was ethnically cleansed during the Assyrian genocide of the First World War. Those who survived fled to unaffected areas of Assyrian settlement in northern Iraq, with others settling in Iraqi cities to the south. Though many also immigrated to neighbouring countries in and around the Caucasus and Middle East like Armenia, Syria, Georgia, southern Russia, Lebanon and Jordan.

In ancient times, Akkadian-speaking Assyrians have existed in what is now Syria, Jordan, Palestine, Israel and Lebanon, among other modern countries, due to the sprawl of the Neo-Assyrian empire in the region. Though recent settlement of Christian Assyrians in Nisabina, Qamishli, Al-Hasakah, Al-Qahtaniyah, Al Darbasiyah, Al-Malikiyah, Amuda, Tel Tamer and a few other small towns in Al-Hasakah Governorate in Syria, occurred in the early 1930s, when they fled from northern Iraq after they were targeted and slaughtered during the Simele massacre. The Assyrians in Syria did not have Syrian citizenship and title to their established land until late the 1940s.

Sizable Assyrian populations only remain in Syria, where an estimated 400,000 Assyrians live, and in Iraq, where an estimated 300,000 Assyrians live. This is a decline from an estimate of 1,100,000 Assyrians in the 1980’s, following instability caused by the American invasion of Iraq in 2003. In Iran and Turkey, only small populations remain, with only 20,000 Assyrians in Iran, and a small but growing Assyrian population in Turkey, where 25,000 Assyrians live, mostly in the cities and not the ancient settlements.

In Tur Abdin, a traditional centre of Assyrian culture, there are only 2,500 Assyrians left. Down from 50,000 in the 1960 census, but up from 1,000 in 1992. This sharp decline is due to an intense conflict between Turkey and the PKK in the 1980s. However, there are an estimated 25,000 Assyrians in all of Turkey, with most living in Istanbul. Most Assyrians currently reside in the West due to the centuries of persecution by the neighboring Muslims. Prior to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, in a 2013 report by a Chaldean Syriac Assyrian Popular Council official, it was estimated that 300,000 Assyrians remained in Iraq.

===Assyrian subgroups===
There are three main Assyrian subgroups: Eastern, Western, Chaldean. These subdivisions are only partially overlapping linguistically, historically, culturally, and religiously.
* The Eastern subgroup historically inhabited Hakkari in the northern Zagros Mountains, the Simele and Sapna valleys in Nuhadra, and parts of the Nineveh and Urmia Plains. They speak Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialects and are religiously diverse, adhering to the East Syriac churches and Protestantism. 
* The Chaldean subgroup is a subgroup of the Eastern one. The group is often equated with the adherents of the Chaldean Catholic Church, however not all Chaldean Catholics identify as Chaldean. They are traditionally speakers of Northeastern Neo-Aramaic dialects, however there are some Turoyo speakers. In Iraq, Chaldean Catholics inhabit the western Nineveh Plains villages of Alqosh, Batnaya, Tel Keppe and Tesqopa, as well as the Nahla valley and Aqra. In Syria they live in Aleppo and the Al-Hasakah Governorate. In Turkey, they live scattered in Istanbul, Diyarbakir, Sirnak Province and Mardin Province.
* The Western subgroup, historically inhabited Tur Abdin. They mainly speak the Central Neo-Aramaic language Surayt (also known as Turoyo). Most adhere to the West Syriac churches, such as the Syriac Orthodox Church of Antioch and the Syriac Catholic Church. Today there are also evangelical groups that have founded their own churches in the diaspora. Historically, Syriac Orthodox culture was centred in two monasteries near Mardin (west of Tur Abdin), Mor Gabriel and Deyrulzafaran. Historic Assyrian villages, some of which are still inhabited by Assyrians in Turabdin, include the following: Aynwardo, Anhil, Kafro, Miden, Arnas, Beth Debe, Beth Kustan, Beth Sbirino, Dayro da-Slibo, Hrabemishka, Qartmin, Arkah, Arbo, Mizizah, Kfraze, Hah, Marbobo, Salah, Sare and Hapsis. In addition, the cities of Midyat and Beth Zabday (&quot;Azech)&quot; were historically Assyrian cities with an Assyrian majority, this is no longer the case today. Outside of the area of core Assyrian settlement in Tur Abdin, there were also sizable populations in the towns of Diyarbakır, Urfa, Harput, and Adiyaman as well as some other villages. 

=== Persecution ===
Due to their Christian faith and ethnicity, the Assyrians have been persecuted since their adoption of Christianity. During the reign of Yazdegerd I, Christians in Persia were viewed with suspicion as potential Roman subversives, resulting in persecutions while at the same time promoting Nestorian Christianity as a buffer between the Churches of Rome and Persia. Persecutions and attempts to impose Zoroastrianism continued during the reign of Yazdegerd II.

During the eras of Mongol rule under Genghis Khan and Timur, there was indiscriminate slaughter of tens of thousands of Assyrians and destruction of the Assyrian population of northwestern Iran and central and northern Iran.

More recent persecutions since the 19th century include the massacres of Badr Khan, the massacres of Diyarbakır (1895), the Adana massacre, the Assyrian genocide, the Simele massacre, and the al-Anfal campaign.

=== Diaspora ===

Since the Assyrian genocide, many Assyrians have left the Middle East entirely for a more safe and comfortable life in the countries of the Western world. As a result of this, the Assyrian population in the Middle East has decreased dramatically. As of today there are more Assyrians in the diaspora than in their homeland. The largest Assyrian diaspora communities are found in Sweden (100,000), Germany (100,000), the United States (80,000), and in Australia (46,000).

By ethnic percentage, the largest Assyrian diaspora communities are located in Södertälje in Stockholm County, Sweden, and in Fairfield City in Sydney, Australia, where they are the leading ethnic group in the suburbs of Fairfield, Fairfield Heights, Prairiewood and Greenfield Park. There is also a sizable Assyrian community in Melbourne, Australia (Broadmeadows, Meadow Heights and Craigieburn) In the United States, Assyrians are mostly found in Chicago (Niles and Skokie), Detroit (Sterling Heights, and West Bloomfield Township), Phoenix, Modesto (Stanislaus County) and Turlock.

Small Assyrian communities are found in San Diego, Sacramento and Fresno in the United States, Toronto in Canada and also in London, UK (London Borough of Ealing). In Germany, pocket-sized Assyrian communities are scattered throughout Munich, Frankfurt, Stuttgart, Berlin and Wiesbaden. In Paris, France, the commune of Sarcelles has a small number of Assyrians. Assyrians in the Netherlands mainly live in the east of the country, in the province of Overijssel. In Russia, small groups of Assyrians mostly reside in Krasnodar Kray and Moscow.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.aina.org/brief.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

To note, the Assyrians residing in California and Russia tend to be from Iran, whilst those in Chicago and Sydney are predominantly Iraqi Assyrians. More recently, Syrian Assyrians are growing in size in Sydney after a huge influx of new arrivals in 2016, who were granted asylum under the federal government&#x27;s special humanitarian intake. The Assyrians in Detroit are primarily Chaldean speakers, who also originate from Iraq. Assyrians in such European countries as Sweden and Germany would usually be Turoyo-speakers or Western Assyrians, and tend to be originally from Turkey.

== Identity and subdivisions ==



Syriac Christians of the Middle East and diaspora employ different terms for self-identification based on conflicting beliefs in the origin and identity of their respective communities. During the 19th century, English archaeologist Austen Henry Layard believed that the native Christian communities in the historical region of Assyria were descended from the ancient Assyrians, a view that was also shared by William Ainger Wigram. Although at the same time Horatio Southgate and George Thomas Bettany claimed during their travels through Mesopotamia that the Syriac Christians are the descendants of the Arameans.

Today, Assyrians and other minority ethnic groups in the Middle East, feel pressure to identify as &quot;Arabs&quot;, &quot;Turks&quot; and &quot;Kurds&quot;. In addition, Western media often makes no mention of any ethnic identity of the Christians in the region, and simply call refer to them as Christians, Iraqi Christians, Iranian Christians, Christians in Syria, and Turkish Christians, a label rejected by Assyrians.

=== Self-designation ===

Below are terms commonly used by Assyrians to self-identify:.
* Assyrian, named after their ethnicity as the descendants of the ancient Assyrian people, is advocated by followers from within all Middle Eastern based East and West Syriac Rite Churches. (see Syriac Christianity)
* Chaldean is a term that was used for centuries by western writers and scholars as designation for the Aramaic language. It was so used by Jerome, and was still the normal terminology in the nineteenth century. Only in 1445 did it begin to be used to designate Aramaic speakers who had entered communion with the Catholic Church. This happened at the Council of Florence, which accepted the profession of faith that Timothy, metropolitan of the Aramaic speakers in Cyprus, made in Aramaic, and which decreed that &quot;nobody shall in future dare to call [...] Chaldeans, Nestorians&quot;. Previously, when there were as yet no Catholic Aramaic speakers of Mesopotamian origin, the term &quot;Chaldean&quot; was applied with explicit reference to their &quot;Nestorian&quot; religion. Thus Jacques de Vitry wrote of them in 1220/1 that &quot;they denied that Mary was the Mother of God and claimed that Christ existed in two persons. They consecrated leavened bread and used the &#x27;Chaldean&#x27; (Syriac) language&quot;. Until the second half of the 19th century, the term &quot;Chaldean&quot; continued in general use for East Syriac Christians, whether &quot;Nestorian&quot; or Catholic. In 1840, upon visiting Mesopotamia, Horatio Southgate reported that local &quot;Chaldeans&quot; consider themselves to be descended from ancient &quot;Assyrians&quot;, and in some later works also noted the same origin of local &quot;Jacobites&quot;.
* Aramean, also known as Syriac-Aramean, named after the ancient Aramean people, is advocated by some followers from within Middle Eastern based West Syriac Rite Churches. Furthermore, Assyrians identifying as Aramean have obtained recognition from the Israeli government. To note, ancient Arameans were a separate ethnic group that lived concurrently with the Assyrian empire in what is now Syria and parts of Lebanon, Israel the West Bank and Gaza, Jordan, Iraq and Turkey.

=== Assyrian vs. Syrian naming controversy ===

As early as the 8th century BC Luwian and Cilician subject rulers referred to their Assyrian overlords as &quot;Syrian&quot;, a western Indo-European corruption of the original term &quot;Assyrian&quot;. The Greeks used the terms &quot;Syrian&quot; and &quot;Assyrian&quot; interchangeably to indicate the indigenous Arameans, Assyrians and other inhabitants of the Near East, Herodotus considered &quot;Syria&quot; west of the Euphrates. Starting from the 2nd century BC onwards, ancient writers referred to the Seleucid ruler as the King of Syria or King of the Syrians. The Seleucids designated the districts of Seleucis and Coele-Syria explicitly as Syria and ruled the Syrians as indigenous populations residing west of the Euphrates in contrast to Assyrians who had their native homeland in Mesopotamia east of the Euphrates.

This version of the name took hold in the Hellenic lands to the west of the old Assyrian Empire, thus during Greek Seleucid rule from 323 BC the name &quot;Assyria&quot; was altered to &quot;Syria&quot;, and this term was also applied to areas west of Euphrates which had been an Assyrian colony, and from this point the Greeks applied the term without distinction between the Assyrians of Mesopotamia and Arameans of the Levant. 

The question of ethnic identity and self-designation is sometimes connected to the scholarly debate on the etymology of &quot;Syria&quot;. The question has a long history of academic controversy, but majority mainstream opinion currently strongly favours that &quot;Syria&quot; is indeed ultimately derived from the Assyrian term &quot;Aššūrāyu&quot;. Meanwhile, some scholars has disclaimed the theory of Syrian being derived from Assyrian as &quot;simply naive&quot;, and detracted its importance to the naming conflict.

Rudolf Macuch points out that the Eastern Neo-Aramaic press initially used the term &quot;Syrian&quot; (&quot;suryêta&quot;) and only much later, with the rise of nationalism, switched to &quot;Assyrian&quot; (&quot;atorêta&quot;). According to Tsereteli, however, a Georgian equivalent of &quot;Assyrians&quot; appears in ancient Georgian, Armenian and Russian documents. This correlates with the theory of the nations to the East of Mesopotamia knew the group as Assyrians, while to the West, beginning with Greek influence, the group was known as Syrians. Syria being a Greek corruption of Assyria. The debate appears to have been settled by the discovery of the Çineköy inscription in favour of Syria being derived from Assyria.

The &quot;Çineköy inscription&quot; is a Hieroglyphic Luwian-Phoenician bilingual, uncovered from Çineköy, Adana Province, Turkey (ancient Cilicia), dating to the 8th century BC. Originally published by Tekoglu and Lemaire (2000), it was more recently the subject of a 2006 paper published in the Journal of Near Eastern Studies, in which the author, Robert Rollinger, lends support to the age-old debate of the name &quot;Syria&quot; being derived from &quot;Assyria&quot; (see Etymology of Syria).

The object on which the inscription is found is a monument belonging to Urikki, vassal king of Hiyawa (i.e., Cilicia), dating to the eighth century BC. In this monumental inscription, Urikki made reference to the relationship between his kingdom and his Assyrian overlords. The Luwian inscription reads &quot;Sura/i&quot; whereas the Phoenician translation reads &quot;ŠR&quot; or &quot;Ashur&quot; which, according to Rollinger (2006), &quot;settles the problem once and for all&quot;.

The modern terminological problem goes back to colonial times, but it became more acute in 1946, when with the independence of Syria, the adjective &quot;Syrian&quot; referred to an independent state. The controversy is not restricted to exonyms like English &quot;Assyrian&quot; vs. &quot;Aramaean&quot;, but also applies to self-designation in Neo-Aramaic, the minority &quot;Aramaean&quot; faction endorses both &quot;Sūryāyē&quot; and &quot;Ārāmayē&quot; , while the majority &quot;Assyrian&quot; faction endorses &quot;Āṯūrāyē&quot; or &quot;Sūryāyē&quot;.

== Culture ==
Assyrian culture is largely influenced by Christianity. There are many Assyrian customs that are common in other Middle Eastern cultures. Main festivals occur during religious holidays such as Easter and Christmas. There are also secular holidays such as Kha b-Nisan (vernal equinox).

People often greet and bid relatives farewell with a kiss on each cheek and by saying &quot;&quot; &quot;Shlama/Shlomo lokh&quot;, which means: &quot;Peace be upon you&quot; in Neo-Aramaic. Others are greeted with a handshake with the right hand only; according to Middle Eastern customs, the left hand is associated with evil. Similarly, shoes may not be left facing up, one may not have their feet facing anyone directly, whistling at night is thought to waken evil spirits, etc. A parent will often place an eye pendant on their baby to prevent &quot;an evil eye being cast upon it&quot;. Spitting on anyone or their belongings is seen as a grave insult.

Assyrians are endogamous, meaning they generally marry within their own ethnic group, although exogamous marriages are not perceived as a taboo, unless the foreigner is of a different religious background, especially a Muslim. Throughout history, relations between the Assyrians and Armenians have tended to be very friendly, as both groups have practised Christianity since ancient times and have suffered through persecution under Muslim rulers. Therefore, mixed marriage between Assyrians and Armenians is quite common, most notably in Iraq, Iran, and as well as in the diaspora with adjacent Armenian and Assyrian communities.

=== Language ===
The Neo-Aramaic languages, which are in the Semitic branch of the Afroasiatic language family, ultimately descend from Late Old Eastern Aramaic, the lingua franca in the later phase of the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which displaced the East Semitic Assyrian dialect of Akkadian and Sumerian. After being conquered by the Assyrians, many people, including the Arameans, were deported to the Assyrian heartland and elsewhere. Due to a large number of Aramaic-speaking people, the Aramaization of Assyria began. The relationship between Arameans and Assyrians grew stronger, with Aramean scribes working with Assyrian ones.

Around 700 B.C., the Aramaic alphabet replaced cuneiform and became the official writing system of the Assyrian empire. Aramaic was the language of commerce, trade, and communication and became the vernacular language of Assyria in classical antiquity. By the 1st century AD, Akkadian was extinct, although its influence on contemporary Eastern Neo-Aramaic languages spoken by Assyrians is significant and some loaned vocabulary still survives in these languages to this day.

To the native speaker, the language is usually called &quot;Surayt&quot;, &quot;Soureth&quot;, &quot;Suret&quot; or a similar regional variant. A wide variety of dialects exist, mainly Suret, and Surayt. All are classified as Neo-Aramaic languages and are usually written using Syriac script, a derivative of the ancient Aramaic script. Jewish varieties such as Lishanid Noshan, Lishán Didán and Lishana Deni, written in the Hebrew script, are spoken by Assyrian Jews.

There is a considerable amount of mutual intelligibility between Suret dialects. Therefore, these &quot;languages&quot; would generally be considered to be dialects rather than separate languages. The Jewish Aramaic languages of Lishan Didan and Lishanid Noshan share a partial intelligibility with these varieties. The mutual intelligibility between Suret and Surayt/Turoyo is, depending on the dialect, limited to partial, and may be asymmetrical.

Being stateless, Assyrians are typically multilingual, speaking both their native language and learning those of the societies they reside in. While many Assyrians have fled from their traditional homeland recently, a substantial number still reside in Arabic-speaking countries speaking Arabic alongside the Neo-Aramaic languages and is also spoken by many Assyrians in the diaspora. The most commonly spoken languages by Assyrians in the diaspora are English, German and Swedish. Historically many Assyrians also spoke Turkish, Armenian, Azeri, Kurdish, and Persian and a smaller number of Assyrians that remain in Iran, Turkey (Istanbul and Tur Abdin) and Armenia still do today.

Many loanwords from the aforementioned languages exist in the Neo-Aramaic languages, with the Iranian languages and Turkish being the greatest influences overall. Only Turkey is reported to be experiencing a population increase of Assyrians in the four countries constituting their historical homeland, largely consisting of Assyrian refugees from Syria and a smaller number of Assyrians returning from the diaspora in Europe.

====Script====

Assyrians predominantly use the Syriac script, which is written from right to left. It is one of the Semitic abjads directly descending from the Aramaic alphabet and shares similarities with the Phoenician, Hebrew and the Arabic alphabets. It has 22 letters representing consonants, three of which can be also used to indicate vowels. The vowel sounds are supplied either by the reader&#x27;s memory or by optional diacritic marks. Syriac is a cursive script where some, but not all, letters connect within a word. It was used to write the Syriac language from the 1st century AD.

The oldest and classical form of the alphabet is the &#x27; script. Although ʾEsṭrangēlā is no longer used as the main script for writing Syriac, it has received some revival since the 10th century, and it has been added to the Unicode Standard in September, 1999. The East Syriac dialect is usually written in the &#x27; form of the alphabet, which is often translated as &quot;contemporary&quot;, reflecting its use in writing modern Neo-Aramaic. The West Syriac dialect is usually written in the &quot;&quot; form of the alphabet. Most of the letters are clearly derived from ʾEsṭrangēlā, but are simplified, flowing lines.

Furthermore, for practical reasons, Assyrian people sometimes use the Latin alphabet, especially in social media.

=== Religion ===
Assyrians belong to various Christian denominations, such as the Syriac Orthodox Church, which has over 1 million members around the world, the Chaldean Catholic Church, with about 600,000 members, the Assyrian Church of the East, with an estimated 400,000 members, and the Ancient Church of the East, with some 100,000 members. The churches that constitute the East Syriac rite include the Chaldean Catholic Church, Assyrian Church of the East, and the Ancient Church of the East, whereas the churches of the West Syriac rite are the Syriac Orthodox Church and the Syriac Catholic Church.

A small minority of Assyrians accepted the Protestant Reformation and became Reform Orthodox in the 20th century, possibly due to British influences, and are now organised in the Assyrian Evangelical Church, the Assyrian Pentecostal Church and other Protestant/Reform Orthodox Assyrian groups. While there are some atheist Assyrians, they tend to still associate with some denomination.

Many members of the following churches consider themselves Assyrian. Ethnic identities are often deeply intertwined with religion, a legacy of the Ottoman Millet system. The group is traditionally characterized as adhering to various churches of Syriac Christianity and speaking Neo-Aramaic languages. It is subdivided into:
* adherents of the Assyrian Church of the East and Ancient Church of the East following the East Syriac Rite, also known as &quot;Nestorians&quot;
* adherents of the Chaldean Catholic Church following the East Syriac Rite, also known as &quot;Chaldeans&quot;
* adherents of the Syriac Orthodox Church following the West Syriac Rite, also known as &quot;Jacobites&quot;
* adherents of the Syriac Catholic Church following the West Syriac Rite

Baptism and First Communion are celebrated extensively, similar to a Brit Milah or Bar Mitzvah in Jewish communities. After a death, a gathering is held three days after burial to celebrate the ascension to heaven of the dead person, as of Jesus; after seven days another gathering commemorates their death. A close family member wears only black clothes for forty days and nights, or sometimes a year, as a sign of mourning.

During the &quot;Seyfo&quot; genocide, there were a number of Assyrians who were forced to convert to Islam. They reside in Turkey, and practice Islam but still retain their identity. A small number of Assyrian Jews exist as well.


=== Music ===
Assyrian music is a combination of traditional folk music and western contemporary music genres, namely pop and soft rock, but also electronic dance music. Instruments traditionally used by Assyrians include the zurna and davula, but has expanded to include guitars, pianos, violins, synthesizers (keyboards and electronic drums), and other instruments.

Some well known Assyrian singers in modern times are Ashur Bet Sargis, Sargon Gabriel, Evin Agassi, Janan Sawa, Juliana Jendo, and Linda George. Assyrian artists that traditionally sing in other languages include Melechesh, Timz and Aril Brikha. Assyrian-Australian band Azadoota performs its songs in the Assyrian language whilst using a western style of instrumentation.

The first international Aramaic Music Festival was held in Lebanon in August 2008 for Assyrian people internationally.

=== Dance ===
Assyrians have numerous traditional dances which are performed mostly for special occasions such as weddings. Assyrian dance is a blend of ancient indigenous and general Near Eastern elements. Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of circle dances that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both. The most common form of Assyrian folk dance is khigga, which is routinely danced as the bride and groom are welcomed into the wedding reception. Most of the circle dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the &quot;Sabre Dance&quot;, which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and tempo of a song.

=== Festivals ===
Assyrian festivals tend to be closely associated with their Christian faith, of which Easter is the most prominent of the celebrations. Members of the Assyrian Church of the East, Chaldean Catholic Church and Syriac Catholic Church follow the Gregorian calendar and as a result celebrate Easter on a Sunday between March 22 and April 25 inclusively.

Members of the Syriac Orthodox Church and Ancient Church of the East celebrate Easter on a Sunday between April 4 and May 8 inclusively on the Gregorian calendar, March 22 and April 25 on the Julian calendar. During Lent, Assyrians are encouraged to fast for 50 days from meat and any other foods which are animal based.

Assyrians celebrate a number of festivals unique to their culture and traditions as well as religious ones:
* Kha b-Nisan &quot;, the Assyrian New Year, traditionally on April 1, though usually celebrated on January 1. Assyrians usually wear traditional costumes and hold social events including parades and parties, dancing, and listening to poets telling the story of creation.
* Sauma d-Ba&#x27;utha &quot;, the Nineveh fast, is a three-day period of fasting and prayer.
* Somikka, All Saints Day, is celebrated to motivate children to fast during Lent through use of frightening costumes
* Kalu d&#x27;Sulaqa, feast of the Bride of the Ascension, celebrates Assyrian resistance to the invasion of Assyria by Tamerlane
* Nusardyl, commemorating the baptism of the Assyrians of Urmia by St. Thomas.
* Sharra d&#x27;Mart Maryam, usually on August 15, a festival and feast celebrating St. Mary with games, food, and celebration.
* Other Sharras (special festivals) include: Sharra d&#x27;Mart Shmuni, Sharra d&#x27;Mar Shimon Bar-Sabbaye, Sharra d&#x27;Mar Mari, and Shara d&#x27;Mar Zaia, Mar Bishu, Mar Sawa, Mar Sliwa, Mar Odisho, and many more. Each town or city also have their own Sharras based on the patron saints of the churches, monasteries, or other holy sites in the settlement or nearby.
* Yoma d&#x27;Sah&#x27;deh (Day of Martyrs), commemorating the thousands massacred in the Simele massacre and the hundreds of thousands massacred in the Assyrian genocide. It is commemorated annually on August 7.

Assyrians practice unique marriage ceremonies. The rituals performed during weddings are derived from many different elements from the past 3,000 years. An Assyrian wedding traditionally lasted a week. Today, weddings in the Assyrian homeland usually last 2–3 days. In the Assyrian diaspora they last 1–2 days.

=== Traditional clothing ===

Assyrian clothing varies from village to village. Clothing is usually blue, red, green, yellow, and purple; these colors are also used as embroidery on a white piece of clothing. Decoration is lavish in Assyrian costumes, and sometimes involves jewellery. The conical hats of traditional Assyrian dress have changed little over millennia from those worn in ancient Mesopotamia, and until the 19th and early 20th centuries the ancient Mesopotamian tradition of braiding or platting of hair, beards and moustaches was still commonplace.

===Cuisine===
Assyrian cuisine is similar to other Middle Eastern cuisines, and is rich in grains, meat, potato, cheese, bread and tomatoes. Typically, rice is served with every meal, with a stew poured over it. Tea is a popular drink, and there are several dishes of desserts, snacks, and beverages. Alcoholic drinks such as wine and wheat beer are organically produced and drunk. Assyrian cuisine is primarily identical to Iraqi/Mesopotamian cuisine, as well as being very similar to other Middle Eastern and Caucasian cuisines, as well as Greek cuisine, Levantine cuisine, Turkish cuisine, Iranian cuisine, Israeli cuisine, and Armenian cuisine, with most dishes being similar to the cuisines of the area in which those Assyrians live/originate from. It is rich in grains such as barley, meat, tomato, herbs, spices, cheese, and potato as well as herbs, fermented dairy products, and pickles.

== Genetics ==

Late-20th-century DNA analysis conducted by Cavalli-Sforza, Paolo Menozzi and Alberto Piazza, &quot;shows that Assyrians have a distinct genetic profile that distinguishes their population from any other population.&quot; Genetic analyses of the Assyrians of Persia demonstrated that they were &quot;closed&quot; with little &quot;intermixture&quot; with the Muslim Persian population and that an individual Assyrian&#x27;s genetic makeup is relatively close to that of the Assyrian population as a whole. &quot;The genetic data are compatible with historical data that religion played a major role in maintaining the Assyrian population&#x27;s separate identity during the Christian era&quot;.

In a 2006 study of the Y chromosome DNA of six regional Armenian populations, including, for comparison, Assyrians and Syrians, researchers found that, &quot;the Semitic populations (Assyrians and Syrians) are very distinct from each other according to both [comparative] axes. This difference supported also by other methods of comparison points out the weak genetic affinity between the two populations with different historical destinies.&quot; A 2008 study on the genetics of &quot;old ethnic groups in Mesopotamia&quot;, including 340 subjects from seven ethnic communities (&quot;Assyrian, Jewish, Zoroastrian, Armenian, Turkmen, the Arab peoples in Iran, Iraq, and Kuwait&quot;) found that Assyrians were homogeneous with respect to all other ethnic groups sampled in the study, regardless of religious affiliation.

In a 2011 study focusing on the genetics of Marsh Arabs of Iraq, researchers identified Y chromosome haplotypes shared by Marsh Arabs, Iraqis, and Assyrians, &quot;supporting a common local background.&quot; In a 2017 study focusing on the genetics of Northern Iraqi populations, it was found that Iraqi Assyrians and Iraqi Yazidis clustered together, but away from the other Northern Iraqi populations analyzed in the study, and largely in between the West Asian and Southeastern European populations. According to the study, &quot;contemporary Assyrians and Yazidis from northern Iraq may in fact have a stronger continuity with the original genetic stock of the Mesopotamian people, which possibly provided the basis for the ethnogenesis of various subsequent Near Eastern populations&quot;.

===Haplogroups===
Y-DNA haplogroup J-M304 which originated from a geographical zone that includes northeastern Syria, northern Iraq and eastern Turkey from where it expanded to the rest of the Near East and North Africa has been measured at 55% among Assyrians of Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, and diaspora; while it has been found at 11% among Assyrians of Iran. the same haplogroup also have high prevalence among Iraqi Arabs which is &quot;indicative of their indigenous nature&quot;.

Haplogroup T-M184 [reported as K*] has been measured at 15.09% among Assyrians in Armenia. The haplogroup is frequent in Middle Eastern Jews, Georgians, Druze and Somalians. According to a 2011 study by Lashgary et al., R1b [reported as R*(xR1a)] has been measured at 40% among Assyrians in Iran, making it major haplogroup among Iranian Assyrians. Yet another DNA test comprising 48 Assyrian male subjects from Iran, the Y-DNA haplogroups J-M304, found in its greatest concentration in the Arabian peninsula, and the northern R-M269, were also frequent at 29.2% each. Lashgary et al. explain the presence of haplogroup R in Iranian Assyrians as well as in other Assyrian communities (~23%) as a consequence of mixing with Armenians and assimilation/integration of different peoples carrying haplogroup R, while explain its frequency as a result of genetic drift due to small population size and endogamy due to religious barriers.

Haplogroup J2 has been measured at 13.4%, which is commonly found in the Fertile Crescent, the Caucasus, Anatolia, Italy, coastal Mediterranean, and the Iranian plateau.

<doc id="266356" wikidata="Q1039078" url="?curid=266356" title="List of The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy characters">
<text>&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; is a comedy science fiction franchise created by Douglas Adams. Originally a 1978 radio comedy, it was later adapted to other formats, including novels, stage shows, comic books, a 1981 TV series, a 1984 text adventure game, and 2005 feature film. The various versions follow the same basic plot but they are in many places mutually contradictory, as Adams rewrote the story substantially for each new adaptation. Throughout all versions, the series follows the adventures of Arthur Dent and his interactions with Ford Prefect, Zaphod Beeblebrox, Marvin the Paranoid Android, and Trillian.

== Main characters ==

=== Arthur Dent ===
Arthur Philip Dent, accompanied by Ford Prefect, barely escapes the Earth&#x27;s destruction when it is demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass. Arthur spends the next several years, still wearing his dressing gown, helplessly launched from crisis to crisis while trying to straighten out his lifestyle. He rather enjoys tea, but seems to have trouble obtaining it in the far reaches of the galaxy. In time, he learns how to fly and carves a niche for himself as a sandwich maker. He is also worried about &quot;everything.&quot;

=== Ford Prefect ===
Ford Prefect is Arthur Dent&#x27;s friend. He rescued Dent when the Earth is unexpectedly demolished to make way for a hyperspace bypass at the start of the story. Although his heart is in the right place and he is shown to be highly intelligent, resourceful, and even brave, Ford is essentially a dilettante when it comes to causes such as the search for the question to the ultimate answer of &quot;life, the universe, and everything.&quot; Ford takes a more existential view of the universe, sometimes bordering on joyful nihilism. He is eccentric and broad-minded – no doubt due to his vast experience of roughing it around the galaxy – and has an off-key and often very dark sense of humour.

=== Zaphod Beeblebrox ===
Zaphod Beeblebrox is a &quot;semi-half-cousin&quot; of Ford Prefect. He is hedonistic and irresponsible, narcissistic, and often extremely insensitive to the feelings of those around him. Zaphod invented the Pan Galactic Gargle Blaster. Zaphod wears unique clothing that contains a mixture of bright and contrasting colours to make him stand out and be the centre of attention wherever he goes. He was voted &quot;Worst Dressed Sentient Being in the Known Universe&quot; seven consecutive times. He&#x27;s been described as &quot;the best Bang since the Big One&quot; by Eccentrica Gallumbits, and as &quot;one hoopy frood&quot; by others. He was briefly the President of the Galaxy and is the only man to have survived the Total Perspective Vortex (In the artificial galaxy created by Zarniwoop).

=== Marvin the Paranoid Android ===
Marvin the Paranoid Android is the ship&#x27;s robot aboard the starship Heart of Gold. Built as one of many failed prototypes of Sirius Cybernetics Corporation&#x27;s GPP (Genuine People Personalities) technology, Marvin is afflicted with severe depression and boredom, in part because he has a &quot;brain the size of a planet&quot; which he is seldom, if ever, given the chance to use. Indeed, the true horror of Marvin&#x27;s existence is that no task he could be given would occupy even the tiniest fraction of his vast intellect. Marvin claims he is 50,000 times more intelligent than a human.

=== Trillian ===
Trillian (Tricia McMillan) is a mathematician and astrophysicist whom Arthur Dent attempted to talk to at a party in Islington. She and Arthur next meet six months later on the spaceship Heart of Gold, shortly after the Earth has been destroyed to make way for a hyperspace bypass.

=== Slartibartfast ===
Slartibartfast is a Magrathean, and a designer of planets. His favourite part of the job is creating coastlines, the most notable of which are the fjords found on the coast of Norway on planet Earth, for which he won an award. When Earth Mk. II is being made, Slartibartfast is assigned to the continent of Africa. He is unhappy about this because he has begun &quot;doing it with fjords again&quot; (arguing that they give a continent a lovely baroque feel), but has been told by his superiors that they are &quot;not equatorial enough&quot;. In relation to this, he expresses the view that he would &quot;far rather be happy than right any day.&quot;

== Minor characters ==

=== Agrajag ===
Agrajag is a tragic and piteous creature who is continually reincarnated and subsequently killed, each time unknowingly, by Arthur Dent. Agrajag is first identified in , but it is revealed that several of Arthur&#x27;s encounters in the first and second novels (and in previous chapters of the third) were with previous incarnations of Agrajag. The first occurs in , when a bowl of petunias is yanked into existence miles above the planet Magrathea in place of one of the missiles targeting the Heart of Gold after its Improbability Drive is used, and begins falling, having only time to think &quot;Oh, no, not again&quot; before crashing to the ground. The &quot;Guide&quot; states that &quot;many had speculated that if we knew exactly why the bowl of petunias had thought that, we should know a lot more about the nature of the universe than we do now&quot;. The reason behind the bowl&#x27;s lament is revealed in , when Agrajag identifies the bowl of petunias as one of his prior incarnations, and tells Arthur that he had seen his face in a spaceship window as he fell to his doom. In another incarnation, Agrajag was a rabbit on prehistoric Earth (during the time period recounted in ) who was killed by Arthur for breakfast and whose skin was fashioned into the pouch Arthur is still carrying, which is then used to swat a fly who also happened to be Agrajag. In yet another, near the beginning of , Agrajag is an old man who dies of a heart attack after seeing Arthur and Ford materialise, seated on a Chesterfield sofa, in the midst of a match at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground.

In due course, Agrajag harbors a fervent desire for vengeance against Arthur Dent, scheming to redirect his teleportation to a Cathedral of Hate. However, in the midst of articulating his animosity towards Arthur, Agrajag references an incident at &quot;Stavromula Beta&quot; where Arthur inadvertently evaded an assassin&#x27;s bullet, causing Agrajag&#x27;s demise. Perplexed by this mention of a place he&#x27;s never visited, Arthur remains oblivious to Agrajag&#x27;s grievances, leading Agrajag to realize his premature timing in bringing Arthur to the cathedral. Despite this revelation, Agrajag still attempts to eliminate Arthur, only to meet his demise once again at Arthur&#x27;s hands while the latter defends himself. In a final act of defiance, Agrajag sets off explosives meant to dispatch Arthur, but trigger a colossal rockfall. Miraculously, Arthur emerges unscathed from the debris.

For the next few years, Arthur travels the universe, secure in his knowledge that, no matter what happens, he cannot die at least until after he survives his assassination attempt at Stavromula Beta. In Arthur&#x27;s daughter Random Frequent Flyer Dent holds him hostage in a London club. When she fires her weapon Arthur dodges, causing the bolt to pass over his head and hit the man standing behind him. Earlier the victim (Agrajag) had dropped a book of matches which revealed the owner of the nightclub to be Stavro Mueller, and the name of the club to be Beta. Thus, what Arthur believed to be the name of a planet was the name of the nightclub, and Agrajag has died once again. Because of this, Arthur is now able to die as well, which, thanks to the Vogons, he supposedly does a few seconds later.

In , Douglas Adams plays Agrajag, having recorded the part for an audiobook version of . Producer Dirk Maggs added a suitable voice treatment, and Simon Jones as Arthur Dent recorded his lines opposite the pre-recorded Adams. Adams was thus able to &quot;reincarnate&quot; to participate in the new series.

At the end of , Arthur Dent&#x27;s extreme bad luck in life coupled with cosmic balance mean that as he materialises on a planet shortly before Vogons are due to destroy it, Agrajag wakes up from a coma after six months having won the lottery and been recognised by a long lost love whilst on &quot;Celebrity Coma&quot;. This event presumably leads to cosmic balance ruining his other lives for the benefit of Arthur Dent.

Agrajag makes a brief appearance in his bowl of petunias form in the 2005 film, the moment he and the sperm whale were called into existence being portrayed exactly as it was in the first book.

In the 2017 second season of the television adaptation of &quot;Dirk Gently&#x27;s Holistic Detective Agency&quot; a dog is named Agrajag with expected consequences.

=== Mrs Alice Beeblebrox ===
Alice Beeblebrox is Zaphod&#x27;s favourite mother, lives at 108 Astral Crescent, Zoovroozlechester, Betelgeuse V, and guards the true story of Zaphod&#x27;s visit to the Frogstar, waiting for &quot;the right price.&quot; She is referenced in .

=== The Allitnils ===
As their names were written to suggest, every Allitnil is an anti-clone of a Lintilla. They were created by the cloning company to eliminate the billions of cloned Lintillas flooding out of a malfunctioning cloning machine. Being anti-clones, when an Allitnil comes into physical contact with a Lintilla, they both wink out of existence in a puff of unsmoke.

Along with Poodoo and Varntvar the Priest, three Allitnils arrived on Brontitall to get the three Lintillas there to &quot;agree to cease to be&quot;. Two of the clones eliminate their corresponding Lintillas, but Arthur shoots the third Allitnil, so that one Lintilla survives.

Appearing only in , every one of the Allitnils is voiced by David Tate.

The Allitnils, like the Lintillas, do not appear in the novels or in the BBC television series.

=== Almighty Bob ===
The Almighty Bob is a deity worshipped by the people of Lamuella. Old Thrashbarg is one of the priests who worships Almighty Bob; however, Thrashbarg is often ignored by the villagers of Lamuella. The Almighty Bob appears in the fifth book, .

=== Anjie ===
Anjie was a woman, on the brink of retirement, on whose behalf a raffle was being held in order to buy her a kidney machine. An unnamed woman (played by June Whitfield on the radio) convinces Arthur Dent to buy raffle tickets while he and Fenchurch are in a railway pub, attempting to have lunch. Arthur won an album of bagpipe music.

She is referred to in 

=== Arcturan Megafreighter crew ===
The captain and first officer were the only crew of an Arcturan Megafreighter carrying a larger number of copies of &quot;Playbeing&quot; magazine than the mind can comfortably conceive. They brought Zaphod Beeblebrox to Ursa Minor Beta, after he had escaped from the Haggunenon flagship. Zaphod was let on board by the Number One, who was cynical about the Guide&#x27;s editors becoming soft. He admired the fact that Zaphod was &quot;hitching the hard way&quot;.

They only appear in , where the captain is played by David Tate, and his number one by Bill Paterson. However, some of their dialogue was given to other characters in .

=== Aseed ===
Leader of the cheese-worshipping Tyromancers on the planet Nano. Appears in .

=== Barmen ===
Three different barmen appear during the series.

==== Barman of the Horse and Groom ====
In , in , and the film, Ford and Arthur quickly down three pints each – at lunchtime – to calm their muscles before using the teleport to escape on the Vogon ship. Being told the world is about to end he calls &quot;last orders, please.&quot; The Red Lion Inn at Chelwood Gate, East Sussex, was used during the TV series, and referenced in the dialogue (Adams himself can be seen in the background of this scene); Steve Conway played the character on TV. This barman was played by David Gooderson in the original radio series and Stephen Moore in the LP recording. In the 2005 motion picture, Albie Woodington portrayed the barman.

==== Barman in Old Pink Dog Bar ====
Ford visits the Old Pink Dog Bar in Han Dold City, orders a round for everyone and then tries to use an American Express card to pay for it, fails, is threatened by a disembodied hand and so offers a Guide write-up instead. This happens in . In the radio adaptation of this novel, the barman was played by Arthur Smith.

==== Barman in the Domain of the King ====
Another barman takes a galactic sized tip for Elvis from Ford on his Hitchhiker&#x27;s corporate Dine-O-Charge credit card in an attempt to bankrupt InfiniDim Enterprises in and the final radio series. This bartender was played by Roger Gregg.

=== BBC department head ===
When Arthur returns to Earth in , he calls his department head to explain why he was absent from work the last six months: &quot;I&#x27;ve gone mad.&quot; His superior is very relaxed about it and asks when Arthur will return to work, and is quite satisfied by the reply &quot;When do hedgehogs stop hibernating?&quot; In the fourth radio series, the part was played by Geoffrey Perkins, who had produced the first two radio series and who had been the BBC TV head of comedy from 1995 to 2001.

=== Blart Versenwald III ===

In the epilogue of , Blart Versenwald III was a top genetic engineer, and a man who could never keep his mind on the job at hand. When his homeworld was under threat from an invading army, he was tasked with creating an army of super-soldiers to fight them. Instead, he created (among other things) a remarkable new breed of superfly that could distinguish between solid glass and an open window, and also an off-switch for children. Fortunately, because the invaders were only invading because they couldn&#x27;t cope with things back home, they too were impressed with Blart&#x27;s creations, and a flurry of economic treaties rapidly secured peace.

=== Bodyguard ===
The strong silent type, an unnamed bodyguard is seen guarding the late Hotblack Desiato in . His face, according to the book &quot;had the texture of an orange and the colour of an apple, but there the resemblance to anything sweet ended.&quot; In he is portrayed by actor David Prowse, &quot;Star Wars&quot;″ Darth Vader, as a man of few words who can lift Ford Prefect clean off the floor. In the LP adaptation of the radio series, the character was voiced by David Tate.

=== Caveman ===
Arthur attempts to play Scrabble with a caveman, who is not even able to spell &quot;Grunt&quot; and &quot;Agh&quot;, and &quot;he&#x27;s probably spelt library with one R again&quot;. However, he does spell &quot;forty-two&quot;, giving Arthur the idea to pull out letters from the letters bag at random to attempt to find the ultimate question; this results in the unhelpful &quot;What do you get when you multiply six by nine?&quot; which does not match the answer (except in base-13).

The caveman appears in played by David Jason, , and .

=== Colin ===
Colin (a.k.a. part #223219B) is a small, round, melon-sized, flying security robot which Ford Prefect enslaves to aid in his escape from the newly re-organized Guide offices in . &quot;Its motion sensors are the usual Sirius Cybernetics garbage.&quot; Ford captures Colin by trapping the robot with his towel and re-wiring the robot&#x27;s pleasure circuits, inducing a cyber-ecstasy trip.

Ford uses Colin&#x27;s cheerfulness to break into the Guide&#x27;s corporate accounting software in order to plant a Trojan Horse module that will automatically pay anything billed to his InfiniDim Enterprises credit card. Colin also saves Ford&#x27;s life when the Guide&#x27;s new security force, the Vogons, fire at him with a rocket launcher after Ford feels the need to jump out of the window. Colin was last seen being sent (at the risk of possible incineration) to look after the delivery of the Guide Mark II to Arthur Dent in the Vogon postal system.

Colin was named after a dog which belonged to a girl, Emily Saunders, of whom Ford had fond memories. Colin appears in , and in the radio series he was played by Andrew Secombe.

=== Constant Mown ===
Crew member on the Vogon ship commanded by Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz, and Jeltz&#x27;s son. Notable for his very un-Vogon-like emotions, ethics and agility, all of which he attempts to keep hidden (with varying degrees of success) from his father and crewmates, lest he be demoted to more unpleasant (even for a Vogon) duties or killed outright for aberrant behavior. Appears in .

=== Dr. Dan Streetmentioner ===
Author of &quot;Time Traveller&#x27;s Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations&quot; which is handy for those travelling through time, and especially to Milliways. His guide is more complete than &quot;The Guide&quot; itself, which ignores the time travel tense topic – other than pointing out that the term &#x27;future perfect&#x27; has been abandoned since it was discovered not to be. He is also mentioned in the third radio series, which gives many examples of his tense forms.

=== Deep Thought ===

Deep Thought is a computer that was created by a pan-dimensional, hyper-intelligent species of beings (whose three-dimensional protrusions into our universe are ordinary white mice) to come up with the Answer to The Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. Deep Thought is the size of a small city. When, after seven and a half million years of calculation, the answer finally turns out to be 42, Deep Thought admonishes Loonquawl and Phouchg (the receivers of the Ultimate Answer) that &quot;[they] checked it very thoroughly, and that quite definitely is the answer. I think the problem, to be quite honest with you, is that you&#x27;ve never actually known what the question was.&quot;

Deep Thought does not know the ultimate question to Life, the Universe and Everything, but offers to design an even more powerful computer, Earth, to calculate it. After ten million years of calculation, the Earth is destroyed by Vogons five minutes before the computation is complete.

Appears in:

On radio, Deep Thought was voiced by Geoffrey McGivern. On television and in the LP re-recording of the radio series, it was voiced by Valentine Dyall. In the feature film, Deep Thought&#x27;s voice was provided by actress Helen Mirren.

In the television series, Deep Thought was shaped like a massive black metal trapezoid with a yellow rectangular display that blinked on and off in time with the computer&#x27;s speaking. The timing of the light&#x27;s flashing was done on set by author Douglas Adams. Valentine Dyall&#x27;s voice was dubbed in later.

In the feature film, it appears as a large, vaguely humanoid computer, with a gigantic head supported, as if in bored repose, by two arms and has a female voice (provided by actress Helen Mirren). This particular version of Deep Thought likes to watch television in her spare time and late in the film can also be seen to have the Apple Computer logo above her eye. This is a reference to Adams being a fan and advocate of the Apple Macintosh. It is also revealed that, in the intervening time, Deep Thought was commissioned by an intergalactic consortium of angry housewives to create the Point of View Gun, a weapon that causes any man it is used on to see things from the firer&#x27;s point-of-view, regardless of the firer&#x27;s gender (due to it being originally used by those housewives having got fed up with ending arguments with their husbands with the phrase &quot;You just don&#x27;t get it, do you?&quot;).

IBM&#x27;s chess-playing computer Deep Thought was named in honour of this fictional computer.

Deep Thought can be seen inscribed on a computer in the NORAD VI area of the 1992 computer game The Journeyman Project.

=== Dionah Carlinton Housney ===
Dionah appears in &quot;And Another Thing...&quot; by Eoin Colfer. Dionah is one of Zaphod Beeblebrox&#x27;s favorite singer/prostitutes. She appears out of nowhere in the &#x27;Heart of Gold&#x27; starship and sings Zaphod a cryptic song about the entrance to the planet Asgard. Zaphod does not understand the song. She vanishes after saying &quot;oh for Zark&#x27;s sake&quot; and then turns into an ice sculpture of herself. The sculpture soon melts into water, the water droplets rise up into the ceiling and every drop disappears after making a &#x27;oh&#x27; sound. Zaphod later comments &quot;That girl always could sing&quot;.

=== Disaster Area&#x27;s chief research accountant ===
As Disaster Area&#x27;s earnings require hypermathematics, their chief research accountant was named Professor of Neomathematics at the University of Maximegalon and in his &quot;Special Theories of Tax Returns&quot; he proves that space-time is &quot;not merely curved, it is, in fact, totally bent.&quot; The Guide shows a graphic indicating that most of the earnings ends up with the accountant.

=== Dish of the Day ===
The quadruped Dish of the Day is an Ameglian Major Cow, a ruminant specifically bred to not only have the desire to be eaten, but to be capable of saying so quite clearly. When asked if he would like to see the Dish of the Day, Zaphod replies, &quot;We&#x27;ll meet the meat.&quot; The Major Cow&#x27;s quite vocal and emphatic desire to be consumed by Milliways&#x27; patrons is the most revolting thing that Arthur Dent has ever heard, and the Dish is nonplussed by a queasy Arthur&#x27;s subsequent order of a green salad, since it knows &quot;many vegetables that are very clear&quot; on the point of not wanting to be eaten – which was part of the reason for the creation of the Ameglian Major Cow in the first place. After Zaphod orders four rare steaks, the Dish announces that it is nipping off to the kitchen to shoot itself. Though it states, &quot;I&#x27;ll be very humane,&quot; this does not comfort Arthur at all.

Several years later, the principal characters encounter a herd of Ameglian Major Cows on the planet Nano, a colony planet established for exceedingly rich refugees from the destroyed Earth. Ford and Arthur (who is now far more open-minded after years spent traversing the galaxy) seriously consider the Cows&#x27; offering themselves as a meal, only to be interrupted by the arrival of the Norse thunder god Thor and his subsequent duel with Bowerick Wowbagger. However, the lightning display accompanying Thor&#x27;s arrival kills and chars several Major Cows (while their still-living herdmates curse their fellows&#x27; luck), and Ford and Arthur take the opportunity to sample the cooked meat. Later, a Major Cow is shown offering itself to Thor at the thunder god&#x27;s victory party.

*

The character is not present in the original radio series, but does make a cameo appearance in the finale of the fifth radio series. The first appearance of it was in a stage adaptation in 1980 at the Rainbow Theatre. Since then it appeared in , and . In the TV series, it was played by Peter Davison, who was at that time both Sandra Dickinson&#x27;s husband and the newly announced fifth Doctor. Dickinson played Trillian in the television series (and &quot;Tricia McMillan&quot; in the final radio series), and suggested casting Davison, who was a fan of the radio series.

=== East River Creature ===
As Ford Prefect travels through space in a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation spaceship, he has a dream in which he encounters a strange creature made of slime from the East River in New York who has just come into existence. After asking Ford a series of questions about life, and Ford&#x27;s recommendation of finding love on 7th Avenue, the creature leaves Ford to talk to a nearby policeman on his status in life.

=== Eccentrica Gallumbits ===
Known as &quot;The Triple-Breasted Whore of Eroticon Six&quot;, Eccentrica Gallumbits, the author of &quot;The Big Bang Theory – A Personal View&quot;, is mentioned in all six of the novels. She is first mentioned in &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; when Arthur looks up &quot;Earth&quot; for the first time in the guide. The entry for Earth follows that for Eccentrica Gallumbits. She is heard about again during a newscast that Zaphod Beeblebrox tunes into shortly after stealing the spaceship &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. The newsreader quotes Eccentrica describing Zaphod as &quot;The best bang since the Big One.&quot; It was also reported in that Zaphod had delivered a presidential address from her bedroom on at least one occasion. Commentary on Zaphod in intimates that one reason for his acquiring a third arm is the ability to fondle all of Eccentrica&#x27;s breasts at the same time.

Pears Gallumbit, a dessert which has several things in common with her, is available at Milliways.

Some people say her erogenous zones start some four miles from her actual body; Ford Prefect disagrees, saying five.

She is referenced in an issue of the &quot;Legion of Super Heroes&quot;.

She is again mentioned in after a wheel of cheese appears above the Nanites: &quot;This sudden and most unexpected apparition shifted the crowd&#x27;s focus faster than the appearance of Eccentrica Gallumbits wearing a neon T-shirt flashing the slogan &quot;Freebie Friday&quot; would shift the focus of the crowd at a VirginNerd convention on a Friday.&quot;

=== Eddie ===
Eddie is the name of the shipboard computer on the starship &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. Like every other system on the spaceship, it has a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Genuine People Personality. Thus, Eddie is over-excitable, quite talkative, over-enthused and ingratiating, or alternatively a coddling, school matron-type as a back-up personality. Shipboard networking interconnects Eddie with everything on the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;; at one point, the whole ship is effectively crippled by Arthur Dent&#x27;s request for tea from the Nutrimatic drinks dispenser; the computation of which nearly crashed Eddie and everything connected to him.

On one occasion when certain destruction seems quite imminent, Eddie sings &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; in a cheesy and upbeat tone.

He is voiced in the first two radio series and on television by David Tate. In the television version, Eddie has lights on his case that flash when he speaks. Douglas Adams read in Eddie&#x27;s lines during filming to operate the lights.

In the 2004–2005 radio series, he is voiced by Roger Gregg and in the 2005 feature film by Thomas Lennon.

=== Effrafax of Wug ===
A sciento-magician who bet his life that he could make an entire mountain invisible within a year. Having wasted most of the period of time failing to create a cloaking device, he hired a company to simply remove the mountain, though this course of action lost him the bet, and his life. This was all due in part to the sudden and rather suspicious presence of an extra moon, and in addition, the fact that you could never touch anything when you walked near the supposed invisible mountain. It is remarked that he should have established a simple Somebody Else&#x27;s Problem field, which would make the mountain invisible even if it were to be painted bright pink.

=== Elders of Krikkit ===
The Elders of Krikkit were, in , under influence of the remains of the supercomputer Hactar, which æons previously had been blown to dust, but retained a measure of consciousness, and determined to destroy the entire universe using the supernova bomb they had built. Trillian used her feminine charm and smart rhetoric in an attempt to dissuade the elders, but failed to stop them deploying the ultimate weapon, which simply dented the council chamber badly.

=== Elvis Presley ===
Elvis Presley is a real-life singer, who died in 1977. It has been suggested that he has been abducted by aliens, or that he is actually an alien who faked his own death so he could return to his home planet.

In , Elvis is discovered by Ford Prefect and Arthur Dent working as a bar singer on an alien planet, and owning a large pink spaceship. Ford, having become a huge fan of Elvis while he was stranded on Earth, watched the performance intently for its entire duration. Presley is not actually named, however his identity is easy to determine from the facts that the bar is called &quot;The Domain of The King,&quot; the &quot;EP&quot; initials in the pink spaceship which Ford and Arthur buy from him, and the accent in which he sings. He tells Ford that, contrary to popular belief, he was not abducted by aliens; he went with them of his own free will.

Ford&#x27;s irreplaceable blue suede shoes, one of which is destroyed during the events in the early part of , are a tribute to his Elvis fandom.

In the radio adaptation of , , it has been indicated that in the alternate Earth which is the focus of the story, Elvis never died, and there is mention of an album &quot;Elvis sings Oasis&quot;. He appears (but is not directly named) in , voiced by Philip Pope.

=== Emperor of the Galaxy ===
Many millennia prior to the events of the series, the final Emperor of the Galactic Empire (in the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; universe) was placed into a stasis field during his dying moments: thus leaving the Empire with a technically ruling, but actually near-dead Emperor, with all his heirs long since dead. And so today, an Imperial President, elected by the Galactic Assembly, has all the trappings of power, without actually wielding any. This was the office held by Yooden Vranx and Zaphod Beeblebrox.

=== Mrs Enid Kapelsen ===
An old woman from Boston who rediscovers purpose in life by seeing Arthur and Fenchurch flying (and performing &quot;other activities&quot;) outside the aeroplane within which she is flying to Heathrow. Witnessing this, she became enlightened, and realized that everything she had ever been taught was varyingly incorrect. She annoys the flight attendants by continually pressing her call button for reasons such as &quot;the child in front was making milk come out of his nose.&quot; Later she ends up seated next to Arthur and Fenchurch on another aeroplane en route from Los Angeles to London (though in the original radio series, she flies with Arthur and Fenchurch on a flight from London to Los Angeles).

Appears in:

She was played by Margaret Robertson in during the Quandary Phase.

=== Eric Bartlett ===
In , it is gardener Eric Bartlett who discovers that space-aliens have landed on Tricia&#x27;s lawn and haven&#x27;t cut her grass.

=== Fenchurch ===
Fenchurch is Arthur Dent&#x27;s soulmate in the fourth book of the Hitchhiker &quot;trilogy&quot;, . Fenchurch was named after the Fenchurch Street railway station where she was conceived in the ticket queue. Adams revealed in an interview that it was really the ticket queues at Paddington Station that made him think of conceiving a character there, but chose Fenchurch to avoid complications with Paddington Bear.

She first appears as the unnamed girl in the café on the first page of ; she is the girl referred to as &quot;sitting on her own in a small café in Rickmansworth.&quot; In , when the Earth and everyone including Fenchurch had mysteriously reappeared, a romantic relationship blooms between her and Arthur Dent. He teaches her to fly, before a first aerial sexual encounter, and a second with a Sony Walkman.

At the beginning of , Fenchurch is referred to as having vanished during a hyperspace jump on their first intergalactic holiday. Douglas Adams later said that he wanted to get rid of the character as she was getting in the way of the story. Much of this is evident from the self-referential prose surrounding Arthur and Fenchurch&#x27;s relationship.

In , she is revealed to have been working as a waitress at Milliways since she vanished, and is reunited with Arthur Dent.

In to and , Fenchurch is played by actress Jane Horrocks.

She appears in the television series played by an uncredited actress for the &quot;girl in a café in Rickmansworth&quot; segment from the second episode. Her appearance corresponds to the one described in &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish&quot;.

In , the computer of the &quot;Tanngrisnir&quot; takes the form of Fenchurch in its programmed attempts to live out the sub-conscious desires of the ship&#x27;s occupiers. While in this form she and Arthur talk and ponder together, exacerbated by the effects of the ship&#x27;s dark matter travel on people&#x27;s emotions. Later in the book Arthur encounters another form of Fenchurch during a travel in hyperspace only to dematerialize, similar to his Fenchurch, across a plural zone into a different part of the universe.

Appears in:
* (unnamed cameo)
* (only mentioned in passing)
*Fenchurch Everris, mentioned in Destiny 1 and 2, was likely inspired by Fenchurch.

=== Frankie and Benjy Mouse ===
Frankie and Benjy are the mice that Arthur (et al.) encounter on Magrathea. Frankie and Benjy wish to extract the final readout data from Arthur&#x27;s brain to get the Ultimate Question. Frankie and Benjy are, after all, part of the pan-dimensional race that created the Earth as a supercomputer successor to Deep Thought in order to find out the question to which the answer was 42.

In the first version, the radio series, they offered Arthur and Trillian a large amount of money if they could tell them what the Question is. In later versions this was changed – unfortunately for Arthur, they claim the only way to do this is to remove his brain and prepare it, apparently by dicing it. They promise to replace it with a simple computer brain, which, suggested Zaphod, would only have to say things like &quot;What?&quot;, &quot;I don&#x27;t understand&quot; and &quot;Where&#x27;s the tea?&quot;. Arthur objects to this (&quot;What?&quot; he says. &quot;See!&quot; says Zaphod), and escapes with the help of his friends. Frankie says:

In , they are in fact the manifestations of Lunkwill and Fook, the pan-dimensional beings who designed and built Deep Thought, and were killed by Arthur Dent when they attempted to remove his brain.

=== Frogstar Prisoner Relations Officer ===
In the, Frogstar Prisoner Relations Officer (referred to in the scripts as the &quot;FPRO&quot;) does his best to annoy Zaphod by hosing him down, letting him think that he escaped to an Ursa Minor robot disco by body debit card, asking him for an autograph and teleporting away whilst Zaphod helps him with his respiratory problem – that he is breathing.

=== Gag Halfrunt ===
Gag Halfrunt is the private brain care specialist of Zaphod Beeblebrox and Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz. Halfrunt describes Beeblebrox as &quot;Just this guy, you know?&quot;

In and , he is responsible for the order to destroy Earth, reasoning that if the ultimate question is revealed, everybody would be happy and psychiatrists would be put out of business. When he learns of two escaped Earth people (Arthur and Trillian), he orders the Vogons to attack the Heart of Gold, at around the same time that Arthur unwittingly sabotages the ship&#x27;s computers by asking them to make a cup of tea.

Halfrunt was played by Gil Morris in the TV show and by Jason Schwartzman in . In both these versions, he only appears briefly.

=== Gail Andrews ===
In , Gail Andrews is an astrologer who is interviewed by Tricia McMillan about the impact that the discovery of the planet Persephone, or Rupert will have on astrology. She is an advisor to the President of the United States, President Hudson, but denies having recommended the bombing of Damascus.

=== Gargravarr ===
Gargravarr, the disembodied mind and custodian of the Total Perspective Vortex on Frogstar World B (&quot;the most totally evil place in the galaxy&quot;), suffers from real-life dualism and is therefore having trial separation with his body, which has taken his forename Pizpot. The dispute arose over whether sex is better than fishing or not, a disastrous attempt at combining the two activities, and his body going out partying too late.

Since he has no physical form that can be seen, he leads those condemned to the Total Perspective Vortex by humming various morose tunes so that the condemned can follow the sound of his voice.

Appears in:

Gargravarr was voiced on radio by Valentine Dyall. He appears in .

=== Garkbit ===
Garkbit is the Head Waiter at Milliways, the impossible &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;. He is unfazed by Arthur, Ford, Zaphod, and Trillian&#x27;s unruly arrival. He has a fine sales patter and a dry sense of humour.

=== Genghis Temüjin Khan ===
Son of Yesügei, Genghis Khan is both a distant ancestor of Mr Prosser and was called &quot;a wanker, a tosspot, a very tiny piece of turd&quot; by Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged in &quot;The Private Life of Genghis Khan&quot;, originally based on a sketch written by Adams and Graham Chapman. The short story also appears in some editions of &quot;The Salmon of Doubt&quot;.

=== Girl with a Master&#x27;s degree ===
After leaving the Old Pink Dog Bar (in ), Ford Prefect discovers his life&#x27;s work has been undeleted. He shares this discovery and some Ol&#x27; Janx Spirit with a working girl who has &quot;a Master&#x27;s degree in Social Economics and can be very convincing&quot;. Engrossed in his own writing, she leaves Ford and leaves with a client in a steel grey Han Dold limousine. Ford later overhears her saying &quot;It&#x27;s OK, honey, it&#x27;s really OK, you got to learn to feel good about it. Look at the way the whole economy is structured...&quot;.

=== God ===
Aside from being the favourite subject of author Oolon Colluphid (&quot;Where God Went Wrong&quot;, &quot;Some More of God&#x27;s Greatest Mistakes&quot;, &quot;Who is this God Person Anyway?&quot; and &quot;Well That About Wraps it Up for God&quot;), God also makes a disappearance in the Guide&#x27;s entry for the Babel Fish (&quot;I refuse to prove that I exist,&quot; says God, &quot;for proof denies faith, and without faith I am nothing&quot;. &quot;But,&quot; says man, &quot;The Babel fish is a dead giveaway, isn&#x27;t it? It could not have evolved by chance. It proves you exist, and so therefore, by your own arguments, you don&#x27;t. QED.&quot;).

Majikthise worries about philosophers sitting up half the night arguing that there may (or may not) be a God if Deep Thought can give His phone number the next morning. Arthur, Fenchurch and Marvin visit God&#x27;s Final Message to His Creation in .

At least six other characters have the status of a god: Almighty Bob, the Great Green Arkleseizure, Thor, Rob McKenna, who is unknowingly a rain god, Gaia, the Greek goddess who personifies the Earth, and Cthulhu, who is one of the Great Old Ones from the Cthulhu Mythos. Gaia, Thor, and Cthulhu are among the deities interviewed by Hillman Hunter for the job of God of the Earth-refugee planet of Nano, with Thor being selected.

=== Gogrilla Mincefriend ===
An enterprising chap who addressed the problem of elevators refusing to operate because they had been afforded a degree of prescience (to facilitate their operation by allowing them to be waiting for you before you&#x27;ve even decided you want to go up or down a floor) but consequently became terrified of the future, and so taken to hiding in basements. Mincefriend became very wealthy when he patented and successfully marketed a device he had seen in a history book: the staircase.

=== Golgafrinchans ===
The Golgafrinchans first appear in . In the novel series, their appearances are all in and they appear in . In all formats, the story is essentially the same. Following their adventures at Milliways, Arthur and Ford teleport onto an &quot;Ark Ship&quot; containing a number of Golgafrinchans. This particular group consists of the Wodehousian &quot;middle class&quot; who have common, middle-management types of occupations. They were sent away from their planet under false pretences by the (upper class) &quot;thinkers&quot; and (working class) &quot;doers&quot; of their society, who deemed them useless. They were told that the entire society had to move to a new planet, with a variety of thin excuses, and that it was necessary for them to go first to prepare the new planet for their occupation. However, it turns out that one of the middle-men was necessary for survival, and as a result, the rest of the Golgafrinchan society died off (see below). They arrive on Earth, where they become the ancestors of modern humans. At the beginning of the novel &quot;Life, The Universe, and Everything&quot; it is mentioned that many of them died out, but Arthur assumes some must have survived.

==== Agda and Mella ====
Agda and Mella are Golgafrinchan girls that Arthur and Ford hit on. On Golgafrincham, Agda used to be a junior personnel officer and Mella an art director. Agda is taller and slimmer and Mella shorter and round-faced. Mella and Arthur become a couple, as do Agda and Ford. In a way Mella is very relieved because she has been saved from a life of looking at moodily lit tubes of toothpaste. Agda dies a few weeks later from a chain of events that Ford unknowingly starts by throwing the Scrabble letter Q into a privet bush: it startles a rabbit, which runs away and is eaten by a fox, who chokes on the rabbit and dies, contaminating a stream that Agda drinks from upon which she falls ill—it is said that the only moral that one could possibly learn from these occurrences is not to throw the letter Q into a privet bush. Agda and Mella only appear in the novel.

==== Captain ====
The Captain of the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B likes to bathe with his rubber duck (he spent practically the entire time he was captain of the B Ark and as much of his time on Earth, a total time of over three years, as has been documented in the bath) and has got a very relaxed attitude towards everything. The Captain also has a fondness for a drink called &quot;jynnan tonnyx&quot;. His personality was based on Douglas Adams&#x27; habit of taking long baths as a method of procrastination to avoid writing.

He was voiced by David Jason in the radio series and by Frank Middlemass in the LP album adaptation. On television, he was played by Aubrey Morris.

==== Great Circling Poets of Arium ====
These rock throwing poets can be seen in the &quot;Guide&quot; graphics in , heard about in and read about in . They are original inhabitants of Golgafrincham, one of whose descendants inspire the stories that caused the creation of the &quot;&#x27;B&#x27; Ark&quot; that Arthur and Ford find themselves on. The first part of their songs tell of how five princes with four horses from the City of Vassilian travel widely in distant lands, and the latter – and longer – part of the songs is about which of them is going to walk back.

==== Hairdresser ====
One of the Golgafrinchans on the prehistoric Earth, the hairdresser was put in charge of the fire development sub-committee. They gave him a couple of sticks to rub together, but he made them into a pair of scissors in the radio series, or curling tongs in the television and book series.

He was played by Aubrey Woods in the radio series, by Stephen Greif in the LP album adaptation, and by David Rowlands on television.

==== Management consultant ====
The Golgafrinchans&#x27; management consultant tried to arrange the meetings of the colonization committee along the lines of a traditional committee structure, complete with a chair and an agenda. He was also in charge of fiscal policy, and decided to adopt the leaf as legal tender, making everyone immensely rich. In order to solve the inflation problem this caused, he planned a major deforestation campaign to revalue the leaf by burning down all the forests.

He was played by Jonathan Cecil in the radio series, by David Tate in the LP album adaptation, and by Jon Glover on television.

==== Marketing girl ====
Another Golgafrinchan on prehistoric Earth, the marketing girl assisted the hairdresser&#x27;s fire development sub-committee in researching what consumers want from fire and how they relate to it and if they want it fitted nasally. She also tried to invent the wheel, but had a little difficulty deciding what colour it should be.

She was played by Beth Porter both in the radio series and on television and by Leueen Willoughby in the LP album adaptation.

==== Number One ====
Number One is the First officer in the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B. He is not very smart, having difficulty tying up his shoelaces, but is regarded by the captain as a nice chap. His only function to appear in the series is to offer Ford and Arthur drinks.

He was voiced by Jonathan Cecil in the radio series and by David Tate in the LP album adaptation. On television, the character was renamed Number Three and played by Geoffrey Beevers.

==== Number Two ====
Number Two is a militaristic officer in the Golgafrinchan Ark Fleet Ship B. He belongs to the Golgafrinchan 3rd Regiment. He captures Arthur and Ford and interrogates them. When they land on Earth, Number Two declares a war on another, uninhabited continent, leaving an &quot;open-ended ultimatum&quot;, blows up some trees which he claims are &quot;potential military installations,&quot; and &#x27;interrogates&#x27; a gazelle. He likes shouting a lot, and thinks the Captain is an idiot.

He is played by Aubrey Woods in the radio series and by Stephen Greif in the LP album adaptation. On television, the character was divided into two different characters: Number Two played by David Neville on the planet Earth, and Number One played by Matthew Scurfield on the B Ark.

==== Telephone Sanitizer ====
The Golgafrinchan telephone sanitizer is in . By tragic coincidence, after all the telephone sanitizers were sent away with the rest of the &quot;useless&quot; Golgafrinchans, the rest of the society died off from an infectious disease contracted from an &quot;unexpectedly dirty&quot; telephone.

=== Googleplex Starthinker ===
In the scripts for , the first programmer asks Deep Thought if it is not &quot;a greater analyst than the Googleplex Starthinker in the Seventh Galaxy of Light and Ingenuity which can calculate the trajectory of every single dust particle throughout a five-week Aldebaran sand blizzard?&quot;, which the great computer dismisses because he has already &quot;contemplated the very vectors of the atoms in the Big Bang itself&quot;. The Googleplex Starthinker also appears in and .Note the much later use (but same spelling) of Googleplex for the Google corporate headquarters, another homage to the number googolplex.

=== Great Green Arkleseizure ===
The creator of the universe, according to the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI. Their legend has it that the universe was sneezed out of the nose of the Great Green Arkleseizure, and they thus &quot;live in perpetual fear of the time they call &#x27;The Coming of the Great White Handkerchief&#x27;&quot; (their cosmology&#x27;s own version of the end of the Universe).

In the movie, Humma Kavula, played by John Malkovich, is a missionary of the Great Green Arkleseizure religion on Viltvodle VI, ending his sermons with a simple &quot;Bless you&quot;.

The Jatravartid&#x27;s God appears (conceptually) in , , and .

=== Great Hyperlobic Omnicognate Neutron Wrangler ===

A great computer, which according to Deep Thought, can &quot;talk all four legs off an Arcturian Megadonkey&quot; (although only Deep Thought could allegedly persuade said Megadonkey to go for a walk &quot;afterwards&quot;), from .

=== Grunthos the Flatulent ===
Grunthos the Flatulent was the poetmaster of the Azgoths of Kria, writers of the second worst poetry in the universe, just between Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings and the Vogons.

During Arthur and Ford&#x27;s torture by Vogon poetry, the Guide recites a tale of how, during a reading by Grunthos of his poem &quot;Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning&quot;, &quot;four of the audience died of internal hemorrhaging and the president of the Mid-Galactic Arts Nobbling Council survived only by gnawing one of his own legs off.&quot;

Reportedly &quot;disappointed&quot; by the reception of his poem, Grunthos then prepared to read his 12-book epic, &quot;My Favourite Bathtime Gurgles&quot; (or &quot;Zen and the Art of Going to the Lavatory&quot; in ). He was prevented from doing so when his small intestine leapt up his neck and throttled his brain in a desperate bid to save civilization, killing him.

Excerpt from &quot;Ode to a Small Lump of Green Putty I Found in My Armpit One Midsummer Morning&quot;, taken from the TV series graphics:

:&quot;Putty. Putty. Putty.&quot;

Appears in:

*&quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;

=== Guide Mark II ===
In the fifth novel, the Guide Mark II is used by the Vogons to help them destroy all the many Earths that appear in the novels. By using &quot;reverse temporal engineering&quot; throughout the book, the Guide Mark II – which takes on the appearance of a bird with &quot;Unfiltered perception&quot; – cajoles the cast to their final destination at Club Beta on Earth to first re-meet Agrajag and then be destroyed by the Vogons.

=== Hactar ===
Flexible and imaginative, Hactar was the first computer whose individual components reflected the pattern of the whole. Hactar is assembled and programmed by the Silastic Armourfiends, who then order him to assemble an &quot;Ultimate Weapon.&quot; Hactar, receiving no other guidance from the Armourfiends, takes the request literally and builds a supernova bomb which would connect every major sun in the universe through hyperspace, thus causing every star to go supernova. Deciding that he could find no circumstance where such a bomb would be justified, Hactar builds a small defect into it. After discovering the defect, the Armourfiends pulverize Hactar.

Rather than being destroyed, Hactar is merely crippled. He can still manipulate matter, but even a simple item takes millennia to manufacture. Over æons Hactar moves and recombines to become a dark cloud surrounding Krikkit, isolating the inhabitants. Deciding that the decision not to destroy the universe was not his to make, he uses his influence to make them build their first space ship and discover the universe; he then manipulates them into the same rage which the Armourfiends possessed, urging that they destroy all other life; Hactar has reassembled the supernova bomb, this time in working condition.

After an incredibly long and bloody galactic war, Judiciary Pag banishes Krikkit to an envelope of &quot;Slo-Time&quot; to be released after the rest of the universe ends. At the end of , after his scheme fails, Hactar slips the cricket-ball-shaped supernova bomb to Arthur Dent, who trips while trying to bowl it at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground; he ends up flying over the pitch and is able to throw the bomb aside without setting it off, thus saving the universe.

Appears in:

He is played on radio first by Geoffrey McGivern, in a flashback for which McGivern is not credited during . He is then voiced by Leslie Phillips, appearing again in .

=== Haggunenon Underfleet Commander ===

The Underfleet Commander reports directly to the Haggunenon Admiral. The admiral had gone off for a quick meal at Milliways, where Ford and Zaphod attempted to steal his/her/its/their flagship. But as it had a pre-set return course, it resumed its place at the front of about a hundred thousand horribly be-weaponed black battle cruisers. But because the Haggunenons have very unstable DNA and change their shape/appearance at random and often inconvenient times, the Underfleet Commander mistakenly assumes that Zaphod and Trillian are actually the admiral.

The Underfleet Commander only appears in , voiced by Aubrey Woods. The Haggunenons were written out of subsequent versions, as they were originally co-written with John Lloyd, although they did appear in some stage adaptations.

Haggunenons are greatly inconvenienced by their genetic instability and so have vowed to wage terrible war against all &quot;filthy, rotten, stinking, same-lings.&quot;

A similar creature appears on the BBC TV series Red Dwarf.

There is a shapeshifting Dungeons &amp; Dragons monster called a &quot;hagunemnon.&quot;

=== Heimdall ===
Keeper of the gate into Asgard. Appears in .

=== Hig Hurtenflurst ===
Hig Hurtenflurst &quot;only happens to be&quot; the risingest young executive in the Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation. During , he is on Brontitall. What he is doing there is something of a mystery, as the Shoe Event Horizon was reached long ago and the survivors of the famine have long since evolved into bird people and set up home inside a fifteen-mile high statue of Arthur Dent. His foot-warriors capture Arthur Dent and three Lintilla clones, who are threatened by Hurtenflurst to be &quot;revoked. K-I-L-L-E-D, revoked&quot;. He then proceeds to show them a film about the activities of the Dolmansaxlil Shoe Corporation, which is interrupted by Marvin, who has cut the power in order to rescue Arthur and the Lintillas.

He appeared in played by Marc Smith. He has not appeared in any versions after this.

=== Hillman Hunter ===
Hillman Hunter is an Irish property developer from Earth who has been tricked by Zaphod into moving to a planet created by Magrathea. He interviews various gods, as he is keen to employ Thor to keep the society he has created on the planet devoutly controlled. He acts as a &quot;stereotype Paddy from a bygone era&quot; using phrases such as &quot;Bejaysus&quot; and invoking leprechauns. He is a major character in . He has considerable problems with the Tyromancers from an alternative reality who have also settled on the planet. Like Ford Prefect, whose name derived from the Ford Prefect automobile, Hillman Hunter&#x27;s name derives from an automobile sold in the United Kingdom in the 1960s. In the radio series &quot;Hexagonal Phase&quot;, Hunter was played by Ed Byrne.

=== Hotblack Desiato ===

Hotblack Desiato is the guitar keyboard player of the plutonium rock group &quot;Disaster Area&quot;, claimed to be the loudest band in the universe, and in fact the loudest noise of any kind, anywhere. So loud is this band that the audience usually listens from the safe distance of away in a well-built concrete bunker. &quot;Disaster Area&#x27;s&quot; lavish performances went so far as to crash a space ship into the sun to create a solar flare. Pink Floyd&#x27;s lavish stage shows were the inspiration for &quot;Disaster Area&quot;. In the book he is described as being connected to a &quot;death support system&quot; and communicates only by supernatural means. At the time when the main characters meet him, in , Hotblack is spending a year dead &quot;for tax reasons&quot;.

The character is named after an estate agency based in Islington, with branches throughout North London. Adams said he was struggling to find a name for the character and, spotting a Hotblack Desiato sign while driving, liked the name so much he &quot;nearly crashed the car&quot; and eventually telephoned to ask permission to use the firm&#x27;s name for a character. Apparently, the firm later received phone calls telling them they had a nerve naming their company after Adams&#x27;s character.

The Disaster Area sub-plot was first heard in the LP album adaptations and later in . It replaces the Haggunenon material from . The character appears in , and his ship in . He does not have any lines (due to being technically dead), and is played by Barry Frank Warren.

The B-side of the 7-inch single of the &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide&quot; TV Series theme music featured a performance of a song entitled &quot;Only The End of the World Again&quot;, credited to &#x27;Disaster Area&#x27;.

=== Humma Kavula ===
Humma Kavula is a semi-insane missionary living amongst the Jatravartid people of Viltvodle VI, and a former space pirate. (It was presumably during his time as a pirate that he lost his lower half and had it replaced with telescoping mechanical spider appendages). He wears thick glasses, which make his eyes appear normal when worn; however, when he removes the glasses, he appears to have shrunken black pits where his eyes should be. He seems to be a religious leader on that planet, preaching about the &quot;Coming of the Great White Handkerchief&quot; (The Jatravartids&#x27; interpretation of the end of the universe, as they believe the universe was sneezed out of the nose of the Great Green Arkleseizure). Hence, his sermons end with the words &quot;Bless You&quot; rather than &quot;Amen&quot; as all the Jatravartids sneeze stimultaneously at the end of a &#x27;prayer&#x27;. 

He also ran against Zaphod Beeblebrox in the campaign for President of the Galaxy (his campaign slogan &quot;Don&#x27;t Vote For Stupid&quot; indicated he was one of the few residents of the galaxy to not be fooled by Zaphod&#x27;s incompetence) but lost, and has remained bitter about it ever since. In the film he is seeking the Point-of-View Gun to further his religion&#x27;s acceptance (presumably), and he takes one of Zaphod&#x27;s two heads and one of his three arms (though its removal is not shown, Zaphod says while attempting to avoid the thermonuclear missiles above Magrathea &quot;I can&#x27;t do this without my third arm&quot;) hostage to ensure his help. 

While the Jatravartids were mentioned in the books, the character of Humma Kavula was created by Adams for . Quoting Robbie Stamp: &quot;All the substantive new ideas in the movie, Humma, the Point of View Gun and the &quot;paddle slapping sequence&quot; on Vogsphere are brand new Douglas ideas written especially for the movie by him.&quot;

Appears in:

*the 2005 film &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, played by John Malkovich.

=== Hurling Frootmig ===
Hurling Frootmig is said to be the founding editor of the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide, who &quot;established its fundamental principles of honesty and idealism, and went bust.&quot; Later, after much soul-searching, he re-established the Guide with its &quot;principles of honesty and idealism and where you could stuff them both, and went on to lead the Guide to its first major commercial success.&quot;

He is mentioned in . He did not make , but was mentioned in .

=== Judiciary Pag ===
His High Judgmental Supremacy, Judiciary Pag, L.I.V.R. (the Learned, Impartial, and Very Relaxed) was the chairman of the board of Judges at the Krikkit War Crimes Trial. He privately called himself Zipo Bibrok 5 × 108 (which is five hundred million or half a billion in short-scale terminology).

It was Judiciary Pag&#x27;s idea that the people of Krikkit be permanently sealed in a Slo-Time envelope, and the seal could only be broken by bringing a special Key to the Lock. When the rest of the universe had ended, the seal would be broken and Krikkit could continue a solitary existence in the universe. This judgement seemed to please everybody except the people of Krikkit themselves, but the only alternative was to face annihilation.

Pag appears to be related to Zaphod Beeblebrox; they share the same carefree and charming attitude, and Pag&#x27;s real name (Zipo Bibrok 5 × 108) appears to be a mutation of Zaphod&#x27;s name. (They also share the initials Z.B.) Since the Beeblebrox family lives backwards in time, Pag (despite living in the distant past) is therefore one of Zaphod&#x27;s descendants.

Appears in:

He is played on radio by Rupert Degas, and appears in .

=== Karl Mueller ===
Karl Mueller operates a nightclub, Club Alpha, in New York City. He is German with a Greek mother, and was handed the running of the club by his brother Stavro Mueller, who renamed Club Alpha with his own name. He appears in , in the storyline regarding the final death of Agrajag.

=== Know-Nothing Bozo the Non-Wonder Dog ===
A dog belonging to advertiser Will Smithers which was so stupid that it was incapable of eating the right dog food on camera, even when engine oil was poured on the wrong food. It was so named because its hair stuck upright on its head in a way that resembled Ronald Reagan. It also had an adverse reaction whenever someone said the word &quot;commies&quot;. Bozo barked at Arthur when he considered entering the Horse and Groom pub on his return to Earth in &quot;So Long and Thanks for all the Fish&quot;.

=== Krikkiters ===
Ford, Arthur, Trillian and Slartibartfast meet a group of murderous Krikkiters on the surface of their planet. Away from the influence of Hactar, they are troubled by their Elders wanting to destroy the Universe as they are keen to have sporting links with the rest of the Galaxy. They appear in and the Tertiary Phase of the radio series. They&#x27;re described as being white, but that&#x27;s nearly all the indication of their appearance in the book series, but the cover of the CD version of the Tertiary Phase features a drawing of the robots, one of them batting a Cricket ball. On the image, they look rather like Marvin from the 2005 movie, only with longer legs, and smaller heads, including sunglasses-like eyes and antennae, like a play on their name.

=== Kwaltz ===
Kwaltz is one of the Vogons on Vogsphere, directing Jeltz&#x27;s Vogon Constructor Fleet during the demolition of Earth and enforcing the galaxy&#x27;s bureaucracy. He is the partner and advisor of vice-president Questular Rontok, who seems to care more about winning Zaphod&#x27;s affections than retrieving the &quot;Heart of Gold.&quot; Kwaltz also leads a team of a few hundred Vogons to capture the president&#x27;s kidnapper in the penultimate scene of the movie, a chase which takes them to Magrathea, where they discover and capture Marvin the Paranoid Android (not shown), then to Earth Mark II, where they shoot up Arthur Dent&#x27;s house, and are finally defeated by Marvin who gives them all a lethargic and depressed nature, at least for the moment, by use of the Point-of-view gun which works on non-organic life forms.

Appears in:
*, voiced by Ian McNeice.

=== Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton ===
Lady Cynthia Fitzmelton is described in the original radio script as &quot;a sort of Margaret Thatcher, Penelope Keith character.&quot; She is responsible for christening the &quot;very splendid and worthwhile yellow bulldozer&quot; which knocks down Arthur Dent&#x27;s house in &quot;cruddy Cottington&quot;, and it gives her &quot;great pleasure&quot; to make a &quot;very splendid and worthwhile&quot; speech beforehand.

She only appears in , where she was voiced by Jo Kendall. Her &quot;very splendid and worthwhile&quot; lines were entirely dropped from later versions.

=== The Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob ===
The Lajestic Vantrashell of Lob is a small man with a strange hat who guards God&#x27;s Final Message to His Creation, and who sells Arthur and Fenchurch a ticket to it before passing them on a scooter and imploring them to &quot;keep to the left&quot;. Introduced by Prak in the epilogue to , he finally appears towards the end of when we also realize that he has been a regular visitor to Wonko The Sane, who describes angels with golden beards and green wings, Dr Scholl sandals, who eat nachos and do a lot of coke. He says that he runs a concession stand by the message and when Wonko says &quot;I don&#x27;t know what that means&quot; he says &quot;no, you don&#x27;t&quot;.

=== Lallafa ===
Lallafa was an ancient poet who lived in the forests of the Long Lands of Effa. His home inspired him to write a poetic opus known as &quot;The Songs of the Long Land&quot; on pages made of dried habra leaves. His poems were discovered years after Lallafa&#x27;s death, and news of them quickly spread. For centuries, the poems gave inspiration and illumination to many who would otherwise be much more unhappy, and for this they are usually considered around the Galaxy to be the greatest poetic works in existence. This is remarkable because Lallafa wrote his poems without the aid of education or correction fluid.

The latter fact attracted the attention of some correction fluid manufacturers from the Mancunian nebula. The manufacturers worked out that if they could get Lallafa to use their fluids in a variety of leafy colours in the course of his work, their companies would be as successful as the poems themselves. They therefore traveled back in time and persuaded him—in the book, by explaining the situation, with difficulty; in the radio adaptation, by beating him—to go along with their plan. The plan succeeded and Lallafa became extremely rich, but spent so much time on chat shows that he never got around to actually writing &quot;The Songs&quot;. This was solved by each week, in the past, giving Lallafa a copy of his poems, from the present, and having him write his poems again for the first time, but on the condition that he make the odd mistake and use the correction fluid.

Some argued the poems were now worthless, and set out to stop this sort of thing with the Campaign for Real Time (a play on Campaign for Real Ale), or CamTim, to keep the flow of history untampered by time travel. Slartibartfast is a member of CamTim. (The necessity for this campaign is contradicted by other events in the novels. For example, when Arthur Dent and Ford Prefect landed on primitive Earth, they decided that nothing they could do would change history. And when Agrajag diverted him to a Cathedral of Doom to try to kill him, Arthur Dent&#x27;s perpetual victim said that he&#x27;d try to kill Dent even if it were a logical impossibility, Dent not having ducked a bullet yet.)

Lallafa appears in and .

=== Lazlar Lyricon ===
A customizer of starships to the rich and famous time travellers, who first appeared in , and later in and . Ford Prefect apparently believes that &quot;the man has no shame.&quot; His trademark is an infra-pink lizard emblem.

=== Lig Lury, Jr ===
The fourth editor of the Guide, who never actually resigned from his job. He simply left one morning for lunch and never returned to his office, making all later holders of the position &quot;Acting Editors.&quot; His old office is still preserved by the Guide employees in the hope that he will return. His desk sports a sign that reads &quot;Missing, presumed fed.&quot;

=== Lintilla ===
Lintilla is a rather unfortunate woman who has (as of ) been cloned 578,000,000,000 times due to an accident at a Brantisvogan escort agency. While creating six clones of a wonderfully talented and attractive woman named Lintilla (at the same time another machine was creating five hundred lonely business executives, in order to keep the laws of supply and demand operating profitably), the machine got stuck in a loop and malfunctioned in such a way that it got halfway through completing each new Lintilla before it had finished the previous one. This meant that it was for a very long while impossible to turn the machine off without committing murder, despite lawyers&#x27; best efforts to argue about what murder actually was, including trying to redefine it, repronounce it, and respell it in the hope that no one would notice.

Arthur Dent encounters three of her on the planet of Brontitall, and takes a liking to (at least) one of them. He kills one of three male anti-clones, all called Allitnil (Lintilla backwards), sent by the cloning company to get her to &quot;agree to cease to be&quot; (although the other two of her &quot;consummate&quot; this legal agreement with their respective anti-clones). When Arthur leaves Zaphod, Ford, and Zarniwoop stranded with the Ruler of the Universe and his cat (at the conclusion of ), he takes one of the Lintillas with him aboard the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;.

All Lintillas were played by the same actress: Rula Lenska. Lintilla (and her clones) appeared only in the final three episodes of the second radio series. Rula Lenska did return to the fourth and fifth radio series – she was first an uncredited &quot;Update Voice&quot; for the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide itself and then played the Voice of the Bird (the new version of the Guide introduced in ). Zaphod noted in the new series that the new Guide has the same voice as &quot;those Lintilla chicks.&quot; The footnotes of the published scripts make the connection, confirming that the bird is actually an amalgam of the Lintilla clones, the solution alluded to in the second series. Lintilla and her clones (of which at the end there are now more than 800,000,000,000 – &quot;800 thousand million&quot;) do make a re-appearance of sorts on the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; in an alternate ending to (which can only be heard on CD).

The Lintillas do not appear in the novels nor in the BBC television series.

The name Lintilla was reused for an adult-oriented multiple-worlds talker that opened in 1994.

The scripts for the radio series make it clear that The Three Lintillas are &quot;NOT an Italian High Wire Act, though I&#x27;m sure we don&#x27;t actually need to mention this fact, only perhaps, well I don&#x27;t know put it in anyway&quot; (script for ).

=== Loonquawl and Phouchg ===
:&quot;See Phouchg and Loonquawl&quot;

=== The Lord ===
The Lord is a cat, owned by The Ruler of the Universe. He might like fish and might like people singing songs to him, as the Ruler of the Universe isn&#x27;t certain if people come to talk to him, or sing songs to his cat or even if the cat exists at all.

=== Lord High Sanvalvwag of Hollop ===
A man who never married. Had he done so, and forgotten his wife&#x27;s birthday for the second year, he would have globbered. This definition of globber casts doubt on the usefulness of &quot;Ultra-Complete Maximegalon Dictionary of Every Language Ever&quot;. (&quot;Life, the Universe and Everything&quot;)

=== Lunkwill and Fook ===
Lunkwill and Fook are the two programmers chosen to receive Deep Thought&#x27;s answer to the great question of Life, The Universe, and Everything! 7-1/2 million years after the day of the Great On-Turning.

Appear in:

On TV, Antony Carrick plays Lunkwill and Timothy Davies plays Fook, and they appear in .

On radio, the characters are just called &quot;First computer programmer&quot; and &quot;Second computer programmer&quot;, and appear in , and are played by Ray Hassett and Jeremy Browne respectively.

In , they are merged with the characters of Frankie and Benjy Mouse. Jack Stanley plays Lunkwill and Dominique Jackson plays Fook.

=== Magician ===
Appears wandering along a beach in , but no one needs him.

=== Majikthise and Vroomfondel ===
Majikthise and Vroomfondel may (or may not) be philosophers. They quite definitely appear as representatives of the &quot;Amalgamated Union of Philosophers, Sages, Luminaries and other Professional Thinking Persons&quot;. When the supercomputer Deep Thought is being programmed to determine the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe and Everything, they declare a demarcation dispute since the search for ultimate truth is the &quot;inalienable prerogative of your professional working thinkers&quot;. They insist on rigidly defined areas of doubt and uncertainty, and demand Deep Thought be switched off immediately. They are disarmed when Deep Thought, already committed to its seven and a half million years&#x27; calculation, suggests that a great deal of money can be made by philosophers willing to exploit the expected media interest. It is later apparent that their distant descendants revere them as &quot;the greatest and most truly interesting pundits the universe has ever known.&quot;

Appear in:

On radio, Majikthise was played by Jonathan Adams, and Vroomfondel was played by Jim Broadbent. In the television series (but not on The Big Read), David Leland played Majikthise and Charles McKeown played Vroomfondel.

The characters were omitted from .

The frog Litoria majikthise was named after the character Majikthise to reference this species&#x27; &quot;vividly coloured thighs and groin.&quot;

=== Max Quordlepleen ===
Max Quordlepleen is an entertainer who hosts at Milliways, the Restaurant at the End of the Universe and the Big Bang Burger Bar (or &quot;Big Bang Burger Chef&quot; in the original radio version). His feelings about the Universe outside of his onstage persona are unclear, but he has witnessed its end over five hundred times.

His name is derived from a phenomenon during a rocket&#x27;s ascent.

Appears in:

On radio, Roy Hudd played him. On television, it was Colin Jeavons.

He re-appears in the final episode of , played by Roy Hudd again.

=== Mo Minetti ===
In , it is Mo Minetti who had left, due to pregnancy, being the anchor the USAM TV breakfast show which Tricia McMillan is in New York to try out for. Apparently, she declined, surprisingly for reasons of taste, to deliver her child on the air.

=== Murray Bost Henson ===
Murray Bost Henson is &quot;a journalist from one of those papers with small pages and big print&quot; as Arthur Dent puts it. He is a friend of Arthur&#x27;s whom Arthur phones one day to find out how he can get in touch with Wonko the Sane, and uses odd idioms in conversation, including such phrases as &quot;my old silver tureen&quot;, &quot;my old elephant tusk&quot; and &quot;my old prosthetic limb&quot; (as terms of endearment) and &quot;the Great Golden Spike in the sky&quot; (referring to the death-place of old newspaper stories).

He is played in by Stephen Fry.

=== Old Man on the Poles ===
Played by Saeed Jaffrey in , the old man on the poles on Hawalius, tells Arthur some old information wrapped up as news, and that everyone should have a beach house. The character appears in .

=== Old Thrashbarg ===
Old Thrashbarg first appears in , as a sort of priest on Lamuella, the planet on which Arthur becomes the Sandwich-Maker. He worships &quot;Bob&quot; and is often ignored by his villagers. Whenever he is questioned about Almighty Bob he merely describes him as &quot;ineffable.&quot; No one on Lamuella knows what this means, because Thrashbarg owns the only dictionary, and it is &quot;the ineffable will of Almighty Bob&quot; that he keeps it to himself. Someone who sneaked into his house while he was out having a swim found that &quot;&quot; was defined in the dictionary as &quot;unknowable, indescribable, unutterable, not to be known or spoken about&quot;.

In Fit the Twenty-Fifth and Fit the Twenty-Sixth of the radio series, Old Thrashbarg is voiced by Griff Rhys Jones.

=== Old Woman in the Cave ===
Played by Miriam Margolyes in , the smelly Old Woman in the Cave in the village of oracles on Hawalius provides Arthur Dent with bad olfactory stimulation and a photocopied story of her life, suggesting he live his life the opposite way so he won&#x27;t end up living in a rancid cave. This occurs in .

The original, real &quot;smelly goat&quot; event happened during the &quot;Last Chance to See&quot; radio series, found on the &quot;Douglas Adams at the BBC&quot; CD as a &quot;Pick of the Week&quot;.

=== Oolon Colluphid ===
Oolon Colluphid is the author of several books on religious and other philosophical topics. Colluphid&#x27;s works include:

*&quot;Where God Went Wrong&quot;
*&quot;Some More of God&#x27;s Greatest Mistakes&quot;
*&quot;Who Is This God Person Anyway?&quot;
*&quot;Well That About Wraps It Up for God&quot;
*&quot;Everything You Ever Wanted To Know About Guilt But Were Too Ashamed To Ask&quot; (A play on the title of a sex manual written by Dr. David Reuben which inspired a Woody Allen film)
*&quot;Everything You Never Wanted To Know About Sex But Have Been Forced To Find Out&quot; (Another play on that same title)

Colluphid is also shown as the author of the book &quot;The Origins of the Universe&quot; in the first part of the &quot;Destiny of the Daleks&quot; serial of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. The Doctor scoffs that he &quot;got it wrong on the first line&quot;. The reference was inserted by Douglas Adams, who was at the time working as the show&#x27;s script editor.
An early version of Colluphid was the character &quot;Professor Eric Von Contrick&quot; appearing in a December 1979 episode of the BBC radio series &quot;The Burkiss Way&quot;, which was based on author Erich von Däniken. &quot;Spaceships of the Gods&quot;, &quot;Some more of the Spaceships of the Gods&quot;, &quot;It Shouldn&#x27;t Happen to Spaceships of the Gods&quot;, were books by the fictional author who had a Gag Halfrunt-style accent and who is visited in the Adams-written sketch by the aliens to demand a cut of Von Contrick&#x27;s profits.

=== Paul Neil Milne Johnstone ===

Paul Neil Milne Johnstone of Redbridge, Essex, was the writer, according to Adams, of the worst poetry in the universe. He appeared under that name in the original radio series and the first printings of the 1979 novelization (Pan Books, paperback, page 53), and his real address was given.

The real Paul Neil Milne Johnstone (1952–2004) attended Brentwood School with Adams, and they jointly received a prize for English. At the school, Johnstone edited &quot;Broadsheet&quot;, &quot;the Artsphere Magazine&quot; that included mock reviews by Adams as well as Johnstone&#x27;s own poetry. Johnstone won an exhibition to study at Emmanuel College, Cambridge while Adams won an exhibition to St John&#x27;s College.

Johnstone achieved moderate prominence in the poetry world as an editor and festival organiser, including the 1977 Cambridge Poetry Festival. He died a few years after Adams of pancreatic failure.

After he requested the removal of his name and address, Johnstone was replaced with &quot;Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings of Greenbridge, Essex&quot; (a garbled form of his name). On the 1979 ORA042 vinyl record release, his name has been made indecipherable by cutting up that part of the mastertape and reassembling it in the wrong order. 
In the film version Paula Nancy Millstone Jennings has moved from Essex to Sussex. In the TV adaptation of the series, a portrait of Jennings was Adams with pigtails.

A sample of Jennings&#x27;s poetry, taken from the animated readout in the TV series, is:

:&quot;The dead swans lay in the stagnant pool.&quot;
:&quot;They lay. They rotted. They turned&quot;
:&quot;Around occasionally.&quot;
:&quot;Bits of flesh dropped off them from&quot;
:&quot;Time to time.&quot;
:&quot;And sank into the pool&#x27;s mire.&quot;
:&quot;They also smelt a great deal. &quot;

In the TV series, Jennings is reported as living at 37 Wasp Villas, Greenbridge, Essex, GB10 1LL which is neither an actual town nor a valid postcode. The real Johnstone lived at Beehive Court in Redbridge.

=== Phouchg and Loonquawl ===
In the first novel, Phouchg and Loonquawl received Deep Thought&#x27;s answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything on the day of the answer, seven and a half million years (75,000 generations) after Deep Thought had been asked the question. They were chosen at birth for this task. The name &quot;Phouchg&quot; may be a bastardization of the word Fuck, as his predecessor&#x27;s name is Fook.

=== Poodoo ===
Poodoo is a representative of the cloning company responsible for all the Lintilla clones. He arrives on Brontitall with Varntvar The Priest on a mission to &#x27;revoke&#x27; the three Lintillas there by marrying them to their anti-clones, each of which is named Allitnil. The marriage certificates are actually legally binding forms that make the signers agree to terminate their existence, and the unctuous Poodoo may therefore be a lawyer of some sort.

After two of the newly married couples disappear in unsmoke, Arthur shoots the third Allitnil dead and, after tying up Poodoo and Varntvar, forces them to listen to a recording of Marvin&#x27;s autobiography, so as he says, &quot;It&#x27;s all over for them.&quot;

Poodoo only appears in , in which he is played by Ken Campbell.

=== Prak ===
In the epilogue of , a journalist with the &quot;Sidereal Daily Mentioner&quot; tells of Prak and then collapses into a coma.

Prak was a witness in a trial on Argabuthon where the Dwellers in the Forest were suing the Princes of the Plains and the Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides. Prak was a messenger for Dwellers in the Forest sent to the other two parties to ask &quot;the reason for this intolerable behaviour.&quot; He would always walk away thinking about how well-thought out the reason was, but he would always forget what it was by the time he got back. The white robots of Krikkit broke into the court room to steal the Argabuthon Sceptre of Justice, as it was part of the Wikkit Gate Key. In so doing they may have jogged a surgeon&#x27;s arm, while the surgeon was injecting Prak with truth serum, resulting in too high a dose.

When the trial resumed, Prak was instructed to tell &quot;the Truth, the Whole Truth, and Nothing but the Truth,&quot; which he did, in its entirety. People at the scene had to flee or risk insanity as Prak told every single bit of the entire truth of the entire universe and all of its history, much of which they found ghastly. Prak recalled that many of the weird bits involved frogs or Arthur Dent.

As a result, when Arthur Dent came to visit him in search of the truth, he nearly died laughing. He never did write down anything he discovered while telling the truth, first because he could not find a pencil and then because he could not be bothered. He has therefore forgotten almost all of it, but did recall the address of God&#x27;s Last Message to His Creation, which he gave to Arthur when the laughter subsided. He died afterwards, not having recovered from his laughing fit.

On radio, he appears in and is voiced by Chris Langham, who had played Arthur Dent in the very first stage adaptation of the scripts of the first radio series, in 1979.

=== Pralite monks ===
Pralite monks are an order that undergo extreme mental training before taking their final vows to be locked in small metal boxes for the rest of their lives; consequently, the galaxy is full of ex-Pralite monks who leave the order just before taking their final vows. Ford visited the ex-Pralite monks to Mind Surf and learned the techniques he used to charm animals on prehistoric Earth long enough for him to kill them for food and clothing.

=== President Hudson ===
Fictional former president of the US who was known to have had an affair with astrologer Gail Andrews in . One of his presidential orders was the bombing of Damascus or &quot;Damascectomy&quot; (the taking out of Damascus), an issue Andrews denied that she counselled him on. At the time of , Hudson had died for unknown reasons.

=== Princess Hooli ===
On the tri-d TV, Trillian Astra reports on the future wedding of Princess Hooli of Raui Alpha to Prince Gid of the Soofling Dynasty whilst Arthur is visiting Hawalius in . The seer who is showing Arthur the future news in order to demonstrate the sudden lack of need for future tellings quickly changes the channel. Arthur says that he knows her (referring to Trillian) and tells the seer to turn the channel back. The seer, thinking that Arthur was referring to the princess, replies &quot;Look mate, if I had to stand here saying hello to everyone who came by who knew Princess Hooli, I&#x27;d need a new set of lungs!&quot;

=== Mr Prosser ===
Mr L. Prosser is a nervous fat and shabby married 40-year-old road builder who would like to build a bypass right through Arthur Dent&#x27;s house. He is unaware that he is a direct but very distant descendant of Genghis Khan which causes him to have occasional visions of Mongol hordes and a preference for fur hats and axes above the door. He unfailingly addresses Arthur as &quot;Mr Dent.&quot;

After some negotiation with Ford Prefect (or with Arthur Dent in the radio series), he is temporarily persuaded to halt the demolition. This respite does not last because the Vogons demolish Earth.

Prosser holds the distinction of having the very first line of dialogue ever in the Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide canon, as he is the first character (not counting The Guide itself) to speak in .

Appears in:
*

On radio, he was played by Bill Wallis and appears in . On television, he appears in , played by Joe Melia. He is played by Steve Pemberton in the movie version. He appears in , despite not appearing in , voiced by Bruce Hyman; this Prosser exists on a parallel Earth where the cottage he wishes to demolish is the home of both Arthur Dent and Fenchurch.

=== Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz ===
The Vogon Captain in charge of overseeing the destruction of the Earth, Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz is sadistic, even by Vogon standards. When not shouting at or executing members of his own crew for insubordination, Jeltz enjoys torturing hitchhikers on board his ship by reading his poetry at them, then having them thrown out of an airlock into open space.

Jeltz is described as being unpleasant to look at, even for other Vogons. Given that Ford Prefect describes Vogons as having &quot;as much sex appeal as a road accident&quot;, one can only imagine how much worse Jeltz must appear. This may explain his disposition.

It is revealed in that Jeltz had been hired by Gag Halfrunt to destroy the Earth. Halfrunt had been acting on behalf of a consortium of psychiatrists and the Imperial Galactic Government in order to prevent the discovery of the Ultimate Question. When Halfrunt learns that Arthur Dent escaped the planet&#x27;s destruction, Jeltz is dispatched to track him down and destroy him. Jeltz is unable to complete this task, due to the intervention of Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth, Zaphod&#x27;s great-grandfather.

In , Jeltz is once again responsible for the destruction of the Earth, this time presumably killing Arthur, Ford, Trillian, and Arthur&#x27;s daughter, Random.

In , it is revealed that Jeltz did not kill Arthur, Ford, Trillian and Random. It is also revealed that he has a son called Constant Mown and that his space ship is called the &quot;Business End&quot;.

&quot;Prostetnic Vogon&quot; is a title, rather than part of his name, as at the beginning of the Quandary Phase he is described as belonging to the &quot;Prostetnic class&quot;. During the second episode of the third radio series (Fit the Fourteenth), two other Prostetnic Vogons are heard from. Also, in , Gag Halfrunt refers to Jeltz as &quot;Captain of Vogons Prostetnic&quot; (although this may have been a play on Halfrunt&#x27;s accent).
Appears in:

In the first radio series, he was played by Bill Wallis. On television, it was Martin Benson. In the third, fourth and fifth radio series, he was played by Toby Longworth, although Longworth did not receive a credit for the role during the third series. In the film, he is voiced by Richard Griffiths.

Prostetnic is a play on the word prosthetic in regard to special effects make-up. Adams was known to have a very low opinion of monsters (describing them as &quot;cod&quot; meaning fake looking) during his tenure as a writer for &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

=== Questular Rontok ===

Questular Rontok is the Vice President of the Galaxy. The character did not appear in the radio or television series or any of the novels; she was introduced in the 2005 film.

Rontok is desperately in love with Zaphod Beeblebrox, the fugitive President of the Galaxy, and he knows it, as she unsuccessfully tries to hide it. Throughout , Questular alternately tries to arrest Zaphod for stealing the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; (even enlisting the help of the Vogons), protects his life (when endangered by Vogon blaster fire), and at one point beseeches him to just give the stolen spaceship up. Questular appears to be the &quot;doer&quot;, performing all the real functions of the Presidency, whilst Zaphod enjoys his status as the figurehead President. After Trillian interrogates Zaphod by repeatedly zapping him with the Point-of-view gun and he learns that she is truly in love with Arthur Dent and not him, he and Questular end up together at the end of the film, Zaphod telling her &quot;Let&#x27;s trip the light fantastic, babe.&quot; Questular is also jealous of Trillian for obvious reasons (&quot;She&#x27;s lying. She&#x27;s skinny, and she&#x27;s pretty, and she&#x27;s lying!&quot;), until Trillian and Zaphod part as lovers. In the early drafts of the film the character was male. In a deleted scene on the DVD, Questular expresses her love for Zaphod shortly after all the Vogons become depressed.

In the 2005 movie, she is played by Anna Chancellor.

=== Raffle ticket woman ===
In , Arthur Dent and Fenchurch attempt to get to know each other in a grim public house near Taunton railway station, their conversation is somewhat thwarted by a woman selling raffle tickets &quot;for Anjie who&#x27;s retiring&quot;. The numbers on both the front and back of the cloakroom ticket prove highly relevant to the protagonist. She is played in the Fit the Twentieth episode of the radio series by British comedy stalwart June Whitfield.

=== Random Dent ===
Originally prophesied by her father, Arthur Dent, after he hears a Vogon for the first time (&quot;I wish I had a daughter so I could forbid her to marry one.&quot;), a disillusioned, teenaged Random Frequent Flyer Dent (the in-vitro progeny with Trillian Astra) is found in . The line is followed up in and , the 2005 radio series adaptation of this book. The new Poe-reminiscent black bird version of the Guide manipulates her (as it has the Grebulons and Ford Prefect), so she is indirectly responsible for the destruction of all possible Earths.

Early in , Arthur travels from planet to planet by donating to &quot;DNA banks&quot;, finding that when he makes these deposits, he can travel first class. Trillian, wishing to have a child, finds some of his sperm in a DNA bank (which was very easy, since he was the only donor of the same species) and uses it to conceive Random.

Shortly before the events of , Random is kept in a dream sequence and frozen along with all the other main characters thanks to her telling the &quot;Guide Mark II&quot; to safeguard their lives. In her dream she is Galactic President and highly successful (having been rescued from Earth by a suspiciously girlish troop of unicorns) and marries a flaybooz (a large, guinea-pig-like creature named Fertle) to annoy her mother. When the &quot;Guide&quot;&#x27;s batteries run out, she is released from her dream with all the other main characters. The events of the book then occur. Strangely, she seems affected by her dream sequence and often laments the loss of her position and her &#x27;husband&#x27;. By the end of the book, Arthur proposes to go with her to find a good university for her to attend.

In , adapted from , she is played by Samantha Béart.

=== Receptionists ===

==== New York Hotel receptionist ====
In , Tricia gets garbled messages via the receptionist from Gail Andrews. Tricia interprets the message &quot;Not happy,&quot; as meaning Gail Andrews wasn&#x27;t happy with their interview.

==== Megadodo receptionist ====
Appearing in and the large, pink-winged, insectoid receptionist in the Megadodo offices points Zaphod using a petulant tentacle towards Zarniwoop&#x27;s office, the one with a whole electronic universe in it, and is also bugged by Marvin who just wants someone to talk to. In , he directs Zaphod towards Zarniwoop&#x27;s new office, having put on the old hippy act.

=== Reg Nullify ===

Reg Nullify leads the &quot;Cataclysmic Combo&quot; band at Milliways. His band—from —performed on the LP album/cassette re-recording of and , released as &quot;The Restaurant at the End of the Universe&quot;. The role was played by Graham de Wilde. In 1980 the song was also released as a track on an EP (Original Records ABO 5).

=== Rob McKenna ===
Described by the scientific community in as a &quot;Quasi Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer,&quot; Rob McKenna is an ordinary lorry driver who can never get away from rain and he has a log-book showing that it has rained on him every day, anywhere that he has ever been, to prove it. Arthur suggests that he could show the diary to someone, which Rob does, making the media deem him a &#x27;Rain God&#x27; (something which he actually is) for the clouds want &quot;to be near him, to love him, to cherish him and to water him&quot;. This windfall gives him a lucrative career, taking money from resorts and similar places in exchange for not going there. Rob McKenna is, in &quot;So Long, and Thanks for All the Fish,&quot; a &quot;miserable bastard and he knew it because he&#x27;d had a lot of people point it out to him...he disliked...everyone.&quot; In the book, he is shown only twice, first when he splashes Arthur Dent, who is hitchhiking in a normal environment, on the side of a desolate road in England, for the first time on record. Second when Arthur meets him in a café, in &quot;Thundercloud Corner,&quot; Rob McKenna&#x27;s personal spot, which most people wouldn&#x27;t venture near. But McKenna is mentioned throughout the book, especially when he is hailed by the media as a &quot;Rain God,&quot; though not in those terms. In the radio show, however, he picks Arthur up instead of ignoring him, and meets him again later, after he acquired his fame. He then has a much more positive attitude towards Life, the Universe, and Everything, and is thrilled to meet Arthur again. He explains, as the narrator does in the book, that &quot;Quasi Supernormal Incremental Precipitation Inducer&quot; means, in layman&#x27;s terms, a Rain God, but the media couldn&#x27;t call him simply that, because it would suggest that the ordinary people knew something they didn&#x27;t.

He appears in , and and is played by Bill Paterson, who also played one of the Arcturan Megafreighter crew in .

Rob McKenna is assumed to be English because that is where he is always driving round, trying to escape the elements, and where, thanks to the summer resorts who&#x27;ve heard of him, he will be confined until his death in the Quintessential Phase; however, in the Quandary Phase, he has a Scottish-sounding voice.

=== Roosta ===
Roosta is a hitchhiker and researcher for the &quot;Guide&quot;, whom Ford Prefect knows at least in passing and holds in some regard (Ford describes him as &quot;a frood who really knows where his towel is&quot;). He carries a special towel infused with nutrients, wheat germ, barbecue sauce, and antidepressants, which can be obtained by sucking on different areas. The last two of these, he explains, are for use when the taste of the first two sickens or depresses him. He saves Zaphod Beeblebrox from a horrible death in the offices of the &quot;Guide&quot; (by taking him into the artificial universe in Zarniwoop&#x27;s office), and is then kidnapped along with Zaphod and the left-hand tower of the &quot;Guide&quot; building by a squadron of Frogstar Fighters. In the radio series, he serves no other purpose than to provide conversation (and deliver the line &quot;here Zaphod, suck this!&quot;) while the pair are travelling to the Frogstar. However, in the books, he instructs Zaphod to leave the office through the window instead of the door after the building lands. This allows Zaphod to remain in Zarniwoop&#x27;s universe and survive the Total Perspective Vortex.

In , Roosta is a much more officious, standoffish and antagonistic character than he appears in the radio series.

On radio, he was voiced by Alan Ford.

=== The Ruler of the Universe ===
The Ruler of the Universe is a man living in a small shack on a world that can only be reached with a key to an improbability field or use of an Infinite Improbability Drive. He does not want to rule the universe and tries not to whenever possible, and therefore is the ideal candidate for the job. He has an odd, solipsistic view of reality: he lives alone with his cat, which he has named &#x27;The Lord&#x27; even though he is not certain of its existence. He has a very dim view of the past, and he only believes in what he senses with his eyes and ears (and doesn&#x27;t seem too certain of that, either): anything else is hearsay, so when executive-types visit to ask him what he thinks about certain matters, such as wars and the like, he tells them how he feels without considering consequences. As part of his refusal to accept that anything is true, or simply as another oddity, &quot;He talked to his table for a week to see how it would react.&quot; He does sometimes admit that some things may be more likely than others – e.g., that he might like a glass of whisky, which the visitors leave for him.

In the radio adaptation of , Ford also meets Zaphod in the accounting department of the new Guide offices. Zaphod describes being bored by a man in a shack and his cat for over a year.

He was voiced on radio by Stephen Moore (in the original &quot;Radio Times&quot; listing he was announced as being played by Ron Hate – an anagram of &quot;A.N. Other&quot; or possibly &quot;No Earth&quot; – because the show was so far behind schedule that the role had not been cast when the magazine went to print).

=== Russell ===
Russell is Fenchurch&#x27;s burly, blonde-moustached, blow-dried brother. He picks up Arthur Dent in his car after Arthur arrives on Earth at the beginning of . Arthur and Russell take an instant dislike to each other. This is also the first time Arthur meets Fenchurch, his lover and co-flyer to be – albeit she is asleep or in a comatose/fugue state and only utters one word – &quot;This&quot; – then lapses back into wherever she is. Fenchurch also doesn&#x27;t like Russell – he calls her &quot;Fenny&quot; which she dislikes intensely. He also tries to simplify her problems so he can explain and understand them better (for example, he tells Arthur that Fenchurch believes herself to be a hedgehog).

He first appeared in , and when this was adapted to radio appears in , where he is played by Rupert Degas.

=== Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration Officials ===
In the story &quot;Young Zaphod Plays it Safe&quot;, a young Zaphod visits the wreck of the Starship Billion Year Bunker that has crashed on the planet with the best lobsters in the Western Galaxy. He is accompanied by two Officials from the Safety and Civil Reassurance Administration and an empty spacesuit, as they search for aorist rods and a Sirius Cybernetics Corporation Designer Person (babbling gently about a shining city on a hill) who it turns out has escaped to Earth. The Officials declare the planet ZZ9 Plural Z Alpha (Earth) must be made &quot;perfectly safe&quot;.

=== Sheila Steafel ===
Whilst asleep in a cave on prehistoric Earth, Arthur Dent dreams of visiting comedian Sheila Steafel on the radio show &quot;Steafel Plus&quot; on 4 August 1982. Arthur, in his dressing gown, talks of missing Mars Bars, various types of tea, Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;News Quiz&quot;, chat shows, &quot;The Archers&quot; and &quot;Just a Minute&quot;. &quot;There is nothing quite like Kenneth Williams in the entire galaxy, I&#x27;ve looked!&quot; Space, he says, is &quot;staggering, bewilderingly dull&quot;: there is so much of it and so little in it, &quot;it sometimes reminds me of &quot;The Observer&quot;&quot;.

Adams wrote this segment specifically for Steafel&#x27;s show, and Simon Jones appeared in character as Arthur Dent. Steafel can be regarded as a canonical &quot;Hitchhiker&#x27;s&quot; character.

=== Shooty and Bang Bang ===
Shooty and Bang Bang are Blagulon galactic policemen. They pursue Zaphod Beeblebrox to the planet of Magrathea, whereupon they proceed to shoot at him. In the radio and television series, this results in a hyperspatial field generator exploding and throwing Arthur Dent, Ford Prefect and Zaphod forwards in time to the Restaurant at the End of the Universe. In the books, Arthur, Ford and Zaphod are saved from certain death when Marvin talks to the cops&#x27; spaceship, which becomes so depressed it commits suicide, disabling the cops&#x27; life support units and rendering them unable to breathe as they were described as being &quot;methane breathers.&quot; They claim to be well balanced and caring, while gratuitously shooting everything in sight. Shooty writes novels (in crayon), and Bang Bang agonizes for hours to his girlfriend about gratuitously shooting everything in sight.

Bang Bang was played on radio by Ray Hassett and on television by Marc Smith. Shooty was played on radio by Jim Broadbent and on television by Matt Zimmerman.

In the &quot;Illustrated Guide to the Galaxy&quot;, the pair are played by Douglas Adams and Ed Victor (his literary agent).

Thor also appears in the Dirk Gently novel and radio series &quot;The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul&quot;.

=== Tribesmen of the Cold Hillsides ===
These tribesmen fought with (in the epilogue of ) the Princes of the Plains in the land of the Dwellers in the Forest, to the detriment of the latter, for a really good reason, but Prak cannot remember why.

=== Trin Tragula ===
Trin Tragula was a speculative philosopher who invented the Total Perspective Vortex basically in order to annoy his wife. His wife thought he was an idiot who needed to &quot;have some sense of proportion&quot;, exhorting her view frequently. When he attached his wife to the Total Perspective Vortex, the shock of seeing herself in relation to the rest of the universe instantly annihilated her brain. Although he was horrified by this, Trin Tragula found some satisfaction in discovering that the one thing that a person cannot afford to have in a universe this size is a sense of proportion.

=== Varntvar The Priest ===
He has only four lines in the programme, accompanying Poodoo and the Allitnils in the conspiracy to destroy Lintilla&#x27;s clones. Varntvar is eventually forced to listen to a tape of Marvin&#x27;s autobiography.

=== Veet Voojagig ===
Veet Voojagig is described as &quot;a quiet, young student at the University of Maximegalon&quot;, who initially studied ancient philology, transformational ethics and the Wave Harmonic Theory of Historical Perception. Then, after drinking some Pan Galactic Gargle Blasters with Zaphod Beeblebrox, he became obsessed with the problem of what happens to all the biros he&#x27;d bought over the years which had somehow disappeared. Voojagig claimed to have discovered the solution that they disappear to a world of their own, and claimed further to have worked on that world, working for a family of cheap green retractables. The character was described as ending up in &quot;tax exile&quot; – and may have had a hand in &quot;Zaphod Beeblebrox&#x27;s highly profitable second-hand [pen] business.&quot; Also of note that when others visited the planet where Veet Voojagig claimed to have lived, all they found was a small asteroid inhabited by &quot;a strange old man who repeatedly claimed that nothing was true, though he was later found to be lying.&quot;

Veet Voojagig appears in and is mentioned in .

:&quot;See Majikthise and Vroomfondel&quot;

=== War Command Krikkiters ===
Zaphod overheard the two War Command Krikkiters in the Robot War Zones, discussing the lassitude of the Krikkit War Robots, saying &quot;The war, sir, it seems to be getting them down. They just seem to get a little tired and a little grim ... and then they sulk&quot;. In ().

=== The Wise Old Bird ===
The Wise Old Bird is the leader of the Bird People of Brontitall. He does not like saying the word &quot;shoe&quot;, as he and the bird people consider it unspeakable. The Bird People live in the right ear of a fifteen-mile-high statue of Arthur Dent, constructed by their ancestors.

The &quot;wise old bird&quot; is a phrase which features in the nursery rhyme &quot;A Wise Old Owl&quot;

:A wise old owl lived in an oak;
:The more he saw the less he spoke;
:The less he spoke the more he heard.
:Why can&#x27;t we all be like that wise old bird?

=== Werdle Sneng ===
Werdle Sneng, in , has a book out, &quot;Bath Sheets in Space&quot; which is found adorning contemporary hot beverage tables, as it is far too large for anyone&#x27;s pocket, fashionable or otherwise.

=== Wonko the Sane ===

John Watson aka Wonko the Sane lives in coastal California with his wife, Arcane Jill Watson, in a house called &quot;The Outside of the Asylum&quot; (which features interior features on its outside and exterior on its inside). When Wonko saw instructions on how to use a toothpick on a packet of toothpicks, he became convinced that the world had gone crazy and so built the house as an asylum for it, hence the reversal of the interior and exterior. Arthur and Fenchurch pay Wonko a visit and learn that like both of them, he had also received a fishbowl from the dolphins (having been a marine biologist and close to them). He also claims to have seen angels with golden beards, green wings and Dr Scholl sandals, who drive little scooters, do a lot of coke and are very wonderful about a whole range of things. Arthur and Fenchurch discover the truth behind this after they have seen God&#x27;s Last Message to His Creation.

John Watson appears in . In the radio series, he is played by Christian Slater.

=== Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged ===
In contrast to most other immortals, Bowerick Wowbagger was not born one, but became immortal due to an accident with &quot;an irrational particle accelerator, a liquid lunch, and a pair of rubber bands&quot;, an event which no-one has been able to replicate without ending up looking rather silly or dead (or both). Unlike other immortals, whom he calls &quot;a load of serene bastards&quot;, he doesn&#x27;t cope very well with his infinite life, having not been born into it and thus lacking the innate ability to handle it. Finding something to do on Sunday afternoons causes him particular difficulties. Eventually he comes up with a plan to keep himself busy: he will insult every single living being in the universe – in alphabetical order. He appears in , while insulting Arthur Dent with the phrase, &quot;You&#x27;re a jerk, a complete arsehole&quot; (in the US changed to &quot;...complete kneebiter&quot;). Later, after Arthur escapes prehistoric Earth, Wowbagger shows up again in the present, but when he sees Arthur he says, &quot;I&#x27;ve done you before, haven&#x27;t I?&quot; After Arthur, his next planned victim is A-Rth-Urp-Hil-Ipdenu, a slug he intends to call &quot;a brainless prat.&quot; In , one Arthur Philip Deodat is also a victim of Wowbagger, during the Krikkit Robot attack on Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground.

Wowbagger makes a return in in his ship, the &quot;Tanngrisnir&quot; where he falls in love with Trillian, fights with Thor (during which he loses his immortality, but survives) and calls Zaphod &quot;a fat arse&quot;.

Wowbagger is also present in &quot;The Private Life of Genghis Khan&quot;, where he insults Genghis Khan, so that he &quot;stormed into Europe in such a rage that he almost forgot to burn down Asia before he left.&quot;

In the new radio series, he is voiced by Toby Longworth. In , he finally reaches the end of his quest by insulting the Great Prophet Zarquon, who revokes Wowbagger&#x27;s immortality.

Cultural reference:

*Wowbagger the Infinitely Prolonged was the inspiration for an insult generation program of the same name, originally available on Atari ST computers and later rewritten for Windows-based systems. Since early 2013 its support site has also incorporated the insult functionality, at which moment the software got a &quot;no longer supported&quot; status.

=== Yooden Vranx ===
Yooden Vranx is the late former President of the Galaxy, the direct predecessor to Zaphod Beeblebrox. Just before his death, Yooden came to see Zaphod and presented his idea to steal the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot;. Following Yooden&#x27;s suggestion, Zaphod locked out a section in each of his own brains so that no one could figure out why he ran for the presidency.

Zaphod and Ford Prefect&#x27;s first encounter with Yooden occurred when they were children on Betelgeuse and Yooden was a ship&#x27;s captain. Zaphod had bet Ford that he could raid a heavily fortified Arcturan megafreighter and took Ford along for the attempt, using a souped-up trijet scooter. They boarded the ship (captained by Yooden), stormed the bridge with toy pistols, and demanded conkers. Yooden gave them conkers, food, booze, and various other items before teleporting them to the maximum-security wing of the Betelgeuse state prison.

=== Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth ===
Zaphod Beeblebrox&#x27;s father&#x27;s name was Zaphod Beeblebrox the Second, and Zaphod&#x27;s grandfather was called Zaphod Beeblebrox the Third. This was due to an &quot;accident with a contraceptive and a time machine&quot;.

The great-grandfather of Zaphod Beeblebrox, Zaphod Beeblebrox the Fourth is one of two active characters in books who are &quot;dead&quot; (see also: Hotblack Desiato). When Arthur Dent inadvertently freezes the systems on board &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; at the same moment Prostetnic Vogon Jeltz attacks, the younger Zaphod holds a séance to contact Zaphod the Fourth.

Zaphod the Fourth berates his great-grandchild for being self-absorbed and learns of the ship&#x27;s imminent destruction. He stops time so he can continue deriding Zaphod, who tries (rather weakly) to defend his life. Zaphod the Fourth saves the ship and crew to keep his great-grandchild and his &quot;modern friends&quot; from joining him in the afterlife and thereby ruining the experience.

When he learns that the ship had seized up to solve the dilemma of either making tea (in ) or figuring out why Arthur would want dried leaves in water (), he solves these problems before leaving by either leaving a pot of tea in the Nutri-Matic Drink Synthesizer or by explaining to Eddie that &quot;he&#x27;s an ignorant monkey who doesn&#x27;t know better&quot;, respectively. In the book Z.B. the Fourth approves of the tying up of all computer resources to make tea – unlike everyone else present on the &quot;Heart of Gold&quot; at the time, including Arthur who originally made the request of Eddie.

As a final note, Zaphod explains that his great-grandfather is &quot;the Fourth&quot; due to an accident with a contraceptive and a time machine. Zaphod the Fourth, therefore, refers to his great-grandson as &quot;Zaphod Beeblebrox the Nothingth&quot; (Zaphod tries to counter this by referring to himself as &quot;the First&quot;).

He was voiced on radio by Richard Goolden.

=== Zarniwoop (Vann Harl) ===
Zarniwoop Vann Harl works in the offices of the &quot;Guide&quot;, on Ursa Minor Beta.
He appears in , , , and .

When Zaphod travels to Ursa Minor Beta to meet him, he is informed that Zarniwoop is unavailable, and too cool, to see him right now. He &quot;is&quot; in his office, but he&#x27;s on an intergalactic cruise.
Zaphod subsequently discovers that Zarniwoop&#x27;s intergalactic cruise ship has spent 900 years on Brontitall (in ), or Frogstar B (in ), waiting for delivery of a complement of small lemon-soaked paper napkins, and every single passenger has aged considerably despite enforced hibernation. Only one person has not aged: Zarniwoop, who was not a passenger, but who hid himself on the spaceship. Zaphod subsequently learns that before he sealed part of his own brain, he was collaborating with Zarniwoop to find out who rules the universe – this being Zarniwoop&#x27;s obsession. In the books, Zarniwoop is marooned on The Ruler of the Universe&#x27;s planet by Zaphod et al. and is stuck outside the only shelter for weeks in driving rain, because The Ruler is unsure as to whether Zarniwoop&#x27;s desperate thumping on the door is real or not. At the end of the second radio series, he is similarly marooned, but this time by Arthur, with Ford Prefect and Zaphod Beeblebrox for company.

In the Quintessential Phase radio series, Zarniwoop is revealed to be the same person as character &quot;Vann Harl&quot; (Zarniwoop is his first name), and a Vogon in disguise. He has escaped being left on the desolate planet and is masterminding the Guide&#x27;s new all-powerful format.

On the radio, Zarniwoop Vann Harl is voiced by Jonathan Pryce. His casting was accidental – he had been hired to play a different role (The Ruler of the Universe) whose lines had apparently not been written in time. However, he was happy to return for the final series, at which point a lot more was revealed about his character – much of it appropriately sinister, since Pryce had then become well known for playing villains.

=== Zarquon ===
Zarquon is a legendary prophet. He is worshipped by a small group visiting The Restaurant at the End of the Universe, and is old, bearded, robed, wreathed in light, has starry eyes and a crown of gold. His name is frequently invoked as a curse, such as &quot;Holy Zarquon&#x27;s singing fish&quot; and &quot;for Zark&#x27;s sake&quot;.

It is only on the visit to Milliways that Zarquon does indeed appear – his overdue second coming – moments before the Universe ends (His last words are &quot;How are we doing for time?&quot;). The host Max claims that he had done the show &quot;over five hundred times&quot; and &quot;nothing like this had ever happened before&quot;.

He appears in , voiced by Anthony Sharp, in the book and in is played by Colin Bennett.

He has a final brief cameo in played by William Franklyn.

=== Zem ===
Zem is an affable, yet stupid, swamp-dwelling mattress. The pocket-sprung lifeform flollops, willomies and glurries around Sqornshellous Zeta and tries his best to cheer up Marvin the Paranoid Android, who became stranded on the planet after having one arm welded to his side and one leg replaced by a steel pillar. Because of his limited intellect he has the same conversation with Marvin every day until the android leaves. After attempting to make conversation about the weather (Marvin: &quot;The dew has fallen with a particularly sickening thud this morning... if I had teeth I would grit them at this point&quot;), Marvin&#x27;s life story, and the (formerly thriving) economy of Sqornshellous itself, Zem offers that Marvin should be more mattresslike in his outlook. Zem is the sole witness to Marvin&#x27;s abduction by the Krikkit war robots.

Note: &quot;Zem&quot; is the name of &quot;all&quot; Sqornshellous Zeta mattresses; as Zem himself puts it, &quot;Some of us are killed, [i.e. taken away to be dried and slept on] but all of us are called Zem, so we never know which and globbering is thus kept to a minimum.&quot; He appears in .

On radio, he is voiced by Andy Taylor.

<doc id="266376" wikidata="Q327504" url="?curid=266376" title="Benedetto Pistrucci">
<text>Benedetto Pistrucci (29 May 1783 – 16 September 1855) was an Italian gem-engraver, medallist and a coin engraver, probably best known for his Saint George and the Dragon design for the British sovereign coin. Pistrucci was commissioned by the British government to create the large Waterloo Medal, a project which took him thirty years to complete.

Born in Rome in 1783, Pistrucci studied briefly with other artists before striking out on his own at age 15. He became prominent as a cameo carver and was patronised by royalty. In 1815, he moved to Britain, where he would live for most of the rest of his life. His talent brought him to the attention of notables including William Wellesley-Pole, the Master of the Mint. Pole engaged Pistrucci to design new coinage, including the sovereign, which was first issued in 1817 to mixed reactions. Although Pole probably promised Pistrucci the post of Chief Engraver, the position could not be awarded as only a British subject could hold it. This slight became a long-term grievance for Pistrucci.

Talented but temperamental, Pistrucci refused to copy the work of other artists. When in 1823 George IV demanded that an unflattering portrait of him on the coinage be changed with a new likeness to be based on the work of Francis Chantrey, Pistrucci refused and was nearly dismissed. The Mint did not dismiss him, lest the money already spent on the Waterloo Medal be wasted. Pistrucci kept his place with the Mint for the rest of his life, eventually completing the Waterloo Medal in 1849, though because of its great size it could not be struck. After Pistrucci&#x27;s death, the George and Dragon design was restored to the sovereign coin, and is still used today.

==Early life and career (1783–1815) ==
Benedetto Pistrucci was born in Rome on 29 May 1783, second child and son of Federico Pistrucci, Senior Judge of the High Criminal Court under the papal government, and Antonia (née Greco). His elder brother Filippo displayed artistic tendencies from a young age, but Benedetto showed mainly a disinclination to study. Federico Pistrucci wanted his sons to follow in his footsteps and sent them to Latin schools. Benedetto began his education in Bologna, where the family had property, but the Pistrucci family was forced to move to Rome in 1794 when Napoleon invaded Italy, and the boys were enrolled in the Roman College.

Napoleon had put a price on Federico Pistrucci&#x27;s head, as he had prosecuted Bonapartist rebels, so the family fled Rome when the French advanced towards it, stopping in Frosinone, where the boys were again put into an academic school. Filippo satisfied his father with enough academic achievement that he was allowed to take a job with a painter named Mango. Deprived of his brother, Benedetto became despondent and was eventually allowed to work at Mango&#x27;s. There, he quickly displayed his artistic talent. Mango told Benedetto of his brother Giuseppe Mango, a cameo engraver in Rome. With the Pope and the French having made peace, the family was able to return there, and Benedetto Pistrucci began his training as a cameo carver. He advanced quickly, also taking lessons from Stefano Tofanelli, and soon Giuseppe Mango was selling Pistrucci&#x27;s carvings as his own. Realising that his works were being sold as counterfeit antiques, Pistrucci began placing a secret mark, the Greek letter &quot;λ&quot; (lambda) on his creations.
Pistrucci&#x27;s obvious talent made his fellow apprentices envious, and one provoked a fight with him, stabbing him in the abdomen before Pistrucci fended off the attack. Recovering at home, he taught himself to model with wax. Federico Pistrucci decided his son would be better off with a new master, and secured a position for him with Giuseppe Cerbara, but the boy refused, believing that he would have to work in poor conditions. A place with gem-carver Nicolo Morelli was secured, and Pistrucci also attended the &quot;scuola del nudo&quot; art academy at the Campidoglio, where in 1800 he took the first prize for sculpture. Pistrucci felt Morelli was seeking to profit from his ability while giving him little training, and left his position at the age of 15, working from the family home. He was able to pay rent, as from the beginning he had ample commissions for cameos.

Pistrucci&#x27;s early clients included two of Rome&#x27;s major art dealers, Ignazio Vescovali and Angelo Bonelli, and Napoleon&#x27;s three sisters, Elisa, Pauline and Caroline. Pistrucci gained prominence by winning a competition to make a cameo of Elisa (the Grand Duchess of Tuscany), working nearly nonstop for eight days to complete it. The Grand Duchess was so impressed by his work that she gave him studio space at her palace. Pistrucci felt secure enough with this patronage that in 1802, he married Barbara Folchi, daughter of a well-to-do merchant; they had nine children together. He continued working in Rome, turning out portrait cameos and engraved gems, until 1814.
Bonelli returned from a successful trip to Britain in 1814 and proposed that Pistrucci go back with him, arguing that the artist&#x27;s future was there. Pistrucci was willing, and after making provision for his family left Rome with Bonelli. They first stopped in Perugia so that Pistrucci could say farewell to his brother Filippo, but found him willing to accompany them. By Turin, Filippo Pistrucci had decided that Bonelli was not to be trusted, and so informed his brother. When they reached Paris in December 1814, the brothers refused to accompany Bonelli further, and after making threats, the dealer departed. Filippo soon returned to Italy, but Benedetto Pistrucci found his name and art were known in Paris, and set to work. He was there when Napoleon returned from Elba, beginning the Hundred Days, but worked on, unaffected by the war. He saw Napoleon in a garden, and always having a ball of wax with him, quietly modelled the emperor, the last portrait of him done in Europe. After the Battle of Waterloo in June 1815, Pistrucci began preparations to move on to Britain, but it was not until 31 December that he arrived there.

== Rise to prominence (1815–1819) ==

On arrival at Dover, Pistrucci had difficulty with Customs, possibly caused by Bonelli&#x27;s malice. Once he was able to, he journeyed to London. He had letters of introduction to several people, and Charles Konig, Keeper of Minerals at the British Museum, proved a loyal friend. Through Konig, Pistrucci met the famous naturalist, Sir Joseph Banks, who commissioned the artist to do a portrait of him. While Banks was sitting for Pistrucci, the connoisseur Richard Payne Knight came by, anxious to show Sir Joseph a cameo fragment he had purchased, and which he dated to Ancient Greece. After Banks praised it highly, Pistrucci, on examining it, identified it as his own work, displaying the secret mark he had placed on it. The incident increased Pistrucci&#x27;s reputation in London.

Pistrucci was introduced to Lord and Lady Spencer by Banks. Lady Spencer showed Pistrucci a model of Saint George and the Dragon by Nathaniel Marchant and commissioned him to reproduce it in the Greek style as part of her husband&#x27;s regalia as a Knight of the Garter. Pistrucci had already been thinking of such a work, and he produced the cameo. The model for the saint was an Italian waiter at Brunet&#x27;s Hotel in Leicester Square, where he had stayed after coming to London.

Sir Joseph commissioned Pistrucci to craft a cameo of King George III. As the King was ill with porphyria, Pistrucci modelled the likeness from Marchant&#x27;s three-shilling bank token, and cut it in red jasper for a fee of 50 guineas. Banks showed the cameo to William Wellesley-Pole, elder brother of the Duke of Wellington and the Master of the Mint, who was greatly impressed by the quality of what he saw. At this time, the Royal Mint was preparing to issue new gold and silver coins as part of the Great Recoinage of 1816, and in June of that year, Pole decided to hire Pistrucci to make models in stone for the new coinage that could be converted into steel dies by the Mint&#x27;s engravers.

Pole had Pistrucci create three portraits of the King in different sizes. Only two were used, one for the obverse of the half crown, and the other for the shilling and sixpence. Both were modified by Thomas Wyon of the Mint, who engraved the designs in steel. What was dubbed the &quot;bull head&quot; of the King on the 1816 half crown was disliked by the public, and it was replaced by another in 1817. The criticism incensed Pistrucci, who blamed Wyon for bungling the design, and who set about learning to engrave in steel himself.

After completing Lady Spencer&#x27;s commission, by most accounts, Pistrucci suggested to Pole that an appropriate subject for the sovereign, a new gold coin equal to one pound that was to be struck, would be Saint George. Until the early 20th century, gold coins were struck for circulation, rather than as bullion pieces. Kevin Clancy, in his volume on the history of the sovereign coin, doubted whether the Spencer commission was truly the inspiration for the George and Dragon design which that coin has long featured, and that the idea might not even have come from Pistrucci. Clancy argued that such motifs were common at the time and that the story originated with Pistrucci, whom he deemed an unreliable witness on his own past.

For a fee of 100 guineas (£105), Pistrucci created the sovereign&#x27;s design, engraving it himself. He depicted the saint atop a fiery steed which is trampling the wounded dragon. George has a broken spear in his hand; part is in the dragon and another fragment lies on the ground. Pistrucci&#x27;s original design, used for circulation in 1817–1819 and reprised by the Royal Mint in 2017, has the ribbon of the Order of the Garter surrounding the George and dragon design, with its motto . The design, with Saint George bearing a sword rather than a spear, is ordinarily seen on the sovereign, and was also used for the crown from 1818. Clancy noted of the design process for the crown, &quot;what emerges is the presence of Pole at each turn. He bombarded the young artist with suggestions and instructions on how the design should be changed from the shape of the sword to the perceived ferocity of the dragon.&quot; Pistrucci had placed his full last name on both sides of the crown, for which he was criticised by the public, and some said the saint would surely fall off his horse with the next blow.

After the death in 1817 of Thomas Wyon Sr, the father of the man who had adapted Pistrucci&#x27;s designs, Pole most probably offered Pistrucci the post of chief engraver at the Royal Mint, with a salary of £500 per annum. and a house within the grounds of the Mint. However, it soon appeared that a law passed under William III barred foreigners from the post, and so Pole left it vacant, while granting Pistrucci the salary and emoluments of the office. Sir John Craig wrote in his history of the Royal Mint: &quot;The arrangement was not put into writing, and misunderstanding was easy for a foreigner. Pole categorically denied any commitment beyond the grant for the time being of a salary for coinage designs as cheaper than payment of fees. The Italian persistently contended that he was seduced into Mint service by a promise of formal appointment to the chief engravership&quot;. According to H.W.A. Linecar in his book on British coin designs and designers, &quot;the arrangement might have worked very well, even though it was against accepted procedure, had Pistrucci been other than he was.&quot;

In 1819, Pistrucci was awarded the commission to design the Waterloo Medal, a huge piece some in diameter that the government planned to award to the victorious generals and national leaders who had defeated Napoleon. Such a medal had been proposed by the Prince Regent (later George IV) soon after the battle. Pistrucci&#x27;s price was £2,400, and the down payment allowed him to bring his family from Italy. The medal was originally supposed to be a design by John Flaxman, but Pistrucci refused to engrave the work of another artist, and Pole allowed him to design his own medal, a decision that antagonised London&#x27;s art establishment against Pistrucci. A gigantic undertaking, the medal would take Pistrucci 30 years to complete.

== Conflict at the Mint (1820–1836) ==

After the death of George III in 1820, Pistrucci prepared the coinage bust of the new King, George IV. The King despised Pistrucci&#x27;s work for its bloated expression—according to Clancy, &quot;its full features implying something of the appetites of the monarch&quot;. The King and Pistrucci also came into conflict over the Coronation medal, with the King objecting to being placed on the same level as the allegorical representations of his kingdoms. Pistrucci stated, &quot;I shall elevate His Majesty&quot;, and did so. The King&#x27;s toupee also caused difficulty in the engraving process. On the coinage, the sovereign was modified to remove its garter, and the saint&#x27;s broken spear was replaced by a sword. Thus, it became very similar to the design used on modern-day sovereigns but for the lack of a streamer on Saint George&#x27;s helmet. This version of the reverse was struck from 1821 to 1825, but Pistrucci&#x27;s design would be thereafter absent from the sovereign from 1825 to 1874, after his death.

Aware of King George&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the coinage effigy, the Mint played for time. Pole&#x27;s resignation in 1823 deprived Pistrucci of a friend and supporter at the Mint. Sculptor Francis Chantrey had prepared a bust of the King which the monarch liked, and ordered that it be placed on the coinage. Pistrucci would not copy the work of another artist, and refused. The new coinage of 1823–1825 was engraved by Pistrucci&#x27;s assistant, Jean Baptiste Merlen, and by William Wyon; Pistrucci was thereafter excluded from work on the coinage. The Mint considered sacking Pistrucci, but realised that if it did, the £1,700 advanced for fees and expenses on the Waterloo medal would probably be wasted, and he kept his position and pay on condition he focused on the completion of the medal. Despite this, by 1826, only a portion of one side had been completed. Though the banishment of the George and Dragon design from the sovereign after 1825 was more part of a general redesign of the coinage than an attack upon Pistrucci, according to Clancy he &quot;cannot have masked the sense he must have felt of tides turning against him&quot;.

There was conflict at the Mint between Pistrucci and William Wyon, that sometimes involved Merlen. According to Graham Pollard in the &quot;Oxford Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, &quot;Pistrucci&#x27;s temperament did not foster good relations with his colleagues at the mint; the insecurity of his position there was deepened by a spasmodic but bitter campaign conducted through the newspapers by his partisans and those of William Wyon.&quot; Pistrucci appealed to each new Master of the Mint for appointment to the post of chief engraver. In 1828, the incumbent Master, George Tierney, worked a compromise that satisfied no one. Wyon was appointed as chief engraver, and Pistrucci as chief medallist, with the salaries of the top two engraving positions divided between them. Of Pistrucci&#x27;s salary of £350, £50 was conditional on his training an apprentice. Pistrucci in succession named two of his sons, but the allowance was stopped after 1830 as it had come to light that each resided abroad, and one was not a British subject and so was ineligible for regular Mint employment. Pistrucci&#x27;s understanding of the arrangement was that he would create such medals as might be ordered by government departments, with each medal a separate fee in addition to the annual salary.

This effectively left Pistrucci with little to do at the Mint. He created several medallic works, for example, a small memorial medal for the King&#x27;s brother, Frederick, Duke of York in 1827 that was popular, in royal circles, mounted in rings. He was asked to design the Coronation medal after King William IV came to the throne on George&#x27;s death in 1830, but declined as he was asked to copy a bust by Chantrey, and the King refused to sit for him. He created, in 1830–1831, the Army Long Service and Good Conduct Medal, the first non-campaign medal of the British Army. He took twelve months to do so, a period of time Craig found unduly long. He continued to cut cameos, and to work, slowly, on the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci&#x27;s biographer, Michael A. March, tied his disinclination to work on the Waterloo Medal to his unhappiness about his position at the Mint, and he may have concluded that he would be sacked if he finished the medal. In 1836, the new Master, Henry Labouchere, stated that he felt the medal could be finished in 18 months, and offered Pistrucci payment if he would take on four apprentices and finish it. Pistrucci declined.

== Later career and death (1837–1855) ==

Pistrucci enjoyed a friendly relationship with Princess Victoria of Kent, the niece and heiress presumptive of King William, and cut several cameos of her. After she succeeded to the throne as Queen Victoria in 1837, Pistrucci was selected to sculpt her Coronation medal, which he did; the Queen granted him several sittings. Although the Queen was pleased, there were mixed reviews. When questions were asked in the House of Commons, Labouchere stated that Pistrucci may have been ill. Joseph Hume opined that the reverse was no better done than the cheap medals sold in the streets for a penny each. In 1838, Pistrucci made the silver seal of the Duchy of Lancaster, using a new process by which the punch or die could be cast in metal directly from the original wax or clay mould, rather than having to be copied by hand engraving. The following year, Pistrucci left for Rome to take up a position as chief engraver at the papal mint, but returned to London a few months later, deeming the salary too low.

By the early 1840s, the Audit Office was questioning the amount spent on Pistrucci. In 1844, the Master of the Mint, William Gladstone restored Pistrucci&#x27;s salary to the full £350 and offered him £400 to complete the Waterloo Medal. Pistrucci moved his residence from the Mint on Tower Hill to Fine Arts Cottage, Old Windsor, and set to work in full earnest. He was slowed by injuries from a fall, and it was not until the beginning of 1849 that he submitted the matrices of the medal, and was paid the remaining balance of £1,500. The matrices were so large no one at the Royal Mint was willing to take the risk of hardening them and possibly ruining three decades&#x27; work. So only soft impressions were taken, with no medals in gold, silver and bronze as intended, though replicas have since been minted from other dies. Even if the government had struck the medals, there was almost no one to present them to, for of the intended recipients, all were dead but the Duke of Wellington.

The conflict between Pistrucci and William Wyon continued into the late 1840s, and was sometimes featured in the press, contributing to the feeling that all was not well at the Mint. A Royal Commission on reform of the Royal Mint was appointed in 1848. Pistrucci submitted a report, in which he settled some old scores. The reforms abolished the positions of chief engraver (Wyon died in 1851) and chief medallist, with Pistrucci appointed a modeller and engraver to the Mint, to receive a salary in addition to payment for any work done.

Pistrucci in 1850 moved from Old Windsor to Flora Lodge, Englefield Green, near Windsor, where he lived with his daughters Maria Elisa and Elena, both gem engravers. He continued to accept private commissions for cameos and medals. Pistrucci died there of &quot;inflammation of the lungs&quot;, on 16 September 1855, and is buried at Christ Church, Virginia Water, Surrey.

== Appraisal ==

Pistrucci is probably remembered most for his George and Dragon design for the sovereign. Not greatly liked at the time of its origin, it has come to be celebrated. The Deputy Master of the Mint who restored the design to the sovereign in 1871, Charles Fremantle, stated his view that &quot;it is hardly possible to over-rate the advantages accruing to a coinage from an artistic and well-executed design&quot;. By 1893, it was on all of Britain&#x27;s gold coins; &quot;The Art Journal&quot; described Pistrucci&#x27;s design as having &quot;triumphantly borne the test of time&quot;. Marsh noted, &quot;it is indeed a tribute that his wonderful design should still adorn the gold coinage of our current Queen Elizabeth II. It is one of the finest ever in our coinage history, and has certainly stood the test of time. Long may it continue.&quot; Pistrucci&#x27;s design has also appeared on a non-circulating £20 silver coin in 2013 and on the crown in 1818–1823, 1887–1900, 1902 and 1951.

Roderick Farey, in his biographical articles on Pistrucci, described him as &quot;an Italian with a fiery disposition, he had numerous arguments with the authorities but no-one could doubt his genius firstly as a cameo cutter and later as an engraver and medallist.&quot; Those disputes, and a perceived slowness to complete his works (especially the Waterloo Medal) have been sources of criticism by later writers. Howard Linecar, in his book on British coin designs and designers, wrote, &quot;there is little doubt that Pistrucci held the cutting of these dies as a bargaining counter in his relentless efforts to obtain the post of Chief Engraver at the Royal Mint ... On balance it is perhaps fair to say that Pistrucci, having probably been promised that which he could not have ... squeezed the last drop of blood out of the situation.&quot; According to Clancy, &quot;With great talent can often come controversy and throughout his career Pistrucci was acclaimed and reviled in equal measure, maintaining a series of tense relationships with his colleagues, the most pointed of which [was] with his fellow engraver William Wyon.&quot; Craig concluded, &quot;Apart from the George and Dragon design, which was less esteemed then than now ... this artist&#x27;s Mint works, unlike his private commissions, were failures&quot;.

The Waterloo Medal is regarded by many as a masterpiece on par with his St George and the Dragon. Pollard stated that the Waterloo Medal, &quot;shows Pistrucci&#x27;s command of the types (or figures) of cameos, an understanding of the figurative language of the Roman Renaissance, and an appreciation of the antique sculptured relief—his types, none the less, were always original&quot;. Marsh also praised the medal: &quot;no better piece of intaglio engraving or design has surely ever been seen before or since. It contains as much as thirty ordinary-sized medals, and this alone is more than most medalists achieved in a life time.&quot;

Farey concluded his study of Pistrucci,

<doc id="266388" wikidata="Q182822" url="?curid=266388" title="French Riviera">
<text>The French Riviera, known in French as the  (; , ; ), is the Mediterranean coastline of the southeast corner of France. There is no official boundary, but it is considered to be the coastal area of the Alpes-Maritimes department, extending from the rock formation Massif de l&#x27;Esterel to Menton, at the France–Italy border, although some other sources place the western boundary further west around Saint-Tropez or even Toulon. The coast is entirely within the Provence-Alpes-Côte d&#x27;Azur region of France. The Principality of Monaco is a semi-enclave within the region, surrounded on three sides by France and fronting the Mediterranean. The French Riviera contains the seaside resorts of Cap-d&#x27;Ail, Beaulieu-sur-Mer, Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat, Villefranche-sur-Mer, Antibes, Juan-les-Pins, Cannes, and Théoule-sur-Mer.

&quot;Riviera&quot; is an Italian word that originates from the ancient Ligurian territory of Italy, wedged between the Var and Magra rivers. &quot;Côte d&#x27;Azur&quot; is originally a nickname given by France to the County of Nice after its annexation in 1860, because the climate was similar to that of the north of Italy, even in winter, with &quot;a sky as blue as its sea&quot;. When the Mistral (Northwest) and the Tramontane (North) winds are blowing in the Languedoc and Provence areas, the temperature of the Mediterranean can be very cool in summer. This phenomenon is observed very little or not at all on the coast between the French Riviera and the Italian Riviera.

This coastline was one of the first modern resort areas. It began as a winter health resort for the British upper class at the end of the 18th century. With the arrival of the railway in the mid-19th century, it became the playground and vacation spot of British, Russian, and other aristocrats, such as Queen Victoria, Tsar Alexander II and King Edward VII, when he was Prince of Wales. In the summer, it also played home to many members of the Rothschild family. In the first half of the 20th century, it was frequented by artists and writers, including Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Francis Bacon, Edith Wharton, Somerset Maugham and Aldous Huxley, as well as wealthy Americans and Europeans. After World War II, it became a popular tourist destination and convention site. Many celebrities, such as Elton John and Brigitte Bardot, have homes in the region.

Officially, the French Riviera is home to 163 nationalities with 83,962 foreign residents, although estimates of the number of non-French nationals living in the area are often much higher. Its largest city is Nice, which has a population of 340,017 as of 2017. The city is the centre of a —Nice-Côte d&#x27;Azur—bringing together 49 communes and more than 540,000 inhabitants and 943,000 in the urban area. Nice is home to Nice Côte d&#x27;Azur Airport, France&#x27;s third-busiest airport (after Charles de Gaulle Airport and Orly Airport), which is on an area of partially reclaimed coastal land at the western end of the Promenade des Anglais. A second airport at Mandelieu was once the region&#x27;s commercial airport, but is now mainly used by private and business aircraft.

The A8 autoroute runs through the region, as does the old main road generally known as the Route nationale 7 (officially now DN7 in Var and D6007 in Alpes-Maritimes). High-speed trains serve the coastal region and inland to Grasse, with the TGV Sud-Est service reaching Nice-Ville station in five and a half hours from Paris. The French Riviera has a total population of more than two million. It is home to a high tech and science park (French: &quot;technopole&quot;) at Sophia-Antipolis (north of Antibes) and a research and technology centre at the University of Nice Sophia Antipolis. The region has 35,000 students, of whom 25 percent are working toward a doctorate. The French Riviera is a major yachting and cruising area with several marinas along its coast. According to the Côte d&#x27;Azur Economic Development Agency, each year the Riviera hosts 50 percent of the world&#x27;s superyacht fleet, with 90 percent of all superyachts visiting the region&#x27;s coast at least once in their lifetime. As a tourist centre, the French Riviera benefits from 310 to 330 days of sunshine per year, of coastline and beaches, 18 golf courses, 14 ski resorts and 3,000 restaurants.

== Etymology ==
===Origin of term===

The term &quot;French Riviera&quot; comes by analogy with the term Italian Riviera, which extends east of the French Riviera (from Ventimiglia to La Spezia). As early as the 19th century, the British referred to the region as the &quot;Riviera&quot; or the &quot;French Riviera&quot;, usually referring to the eastern part of the coast, between Monaco and the Italian border. &quot;Riviera&quot; is an Italian noun which means &quot;coastline&quot;.

The name &quot;Côte d&#x27;Azur&quot; was given to the coast by the writer Stéphen Liégeard in his book, &quot;La Côte d’azur&quot;, published in December 1887. Liégeard was born in Dijon, in the French department of Côte-d&#x27;Or, and adapted that name by substituting the azure colour of the Mediterranean for the gold of Côte-d&#x27;Or.

In Occitan (Niçard and Provençal) and French, the only usual names are &quot;Còsta d&#x27;Azur&quot; in Occitan and &quot;Côte d&#x27;Azur&quot; in French. A term like &quot;French Riviera&quot; (&quot;Ribiera Francesa&quot; in Occitan, &quot;Riviera Française&quot; in French) would only be used in literal translation, or adaptations of it. For instance, in French, &quot;Riviera Française&quot; is found in the online Larousse encyclopedia to refer to the holidays of a group of English workers (moreover, in Occitan, the word &quot;ribiera&quot; &quot;coastline&quot; mostly works as a common name, whereas in French, the old-fashioned term &quot;Rivière de Gênes&quot; was used to refer to the Italian Riviera whose center is Genoa).
=== Disputes over the extent of the Riviera and the Côte d&#x27;Azur ===

Côte d&#x27;Azur and the French Riviera have no official boundaries. Some sources put the western boundary at Saint-Tropez. Others include Saint Tropez, Hyères or Toulon in the Var (departement), or as far as Cassis in the Bouches-du-Rhône departement. In her 1955 novel, &quot;The Talented Mr. Ripley&quot;, Patricia Highsmith describes the Riviera as including all of the coast between Toulon and the Italian border.

== History ==
=== From prehistory to the Bronze Age ===
The region of the French Riviera has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Primitive tools dating to between 1,000,000 and 1,050,000 years ago were discovered in the Grotte du Vallonnet, near Roquebrune-Cap-Martin, with stones and bones of animals, including bovines, rhinoceros, and bison. At Terra Amata (380,000 to 230,000 years ago), near the Nice Port, a fireplace was discovered that is one of the oldest found in Europe.

Stone dolmens, monuments from the Bronze Age, can be found near Draguignan, while the Valley of Marvels (Vallée des Merveilles) near Mount Bégo, at elevation, is presumed to have been an outdoor religious sanctuary, having over 40,000 drawings of people and animals, dated to about 2000 BC.

=== Greek influence ===
Beginning in the 7th century BC, Greek sailors from Phocaea in Asia Minor began to visit and then build emporia along the Côte d&#x27;Azur. Emporia were started at Olbia (Hyères); Antipolis (Antibes) and Nikaia (Nice). These settlements, which traded with the inhabitants of the interior, became rivals of the Etruscans and Phoenicians, who also visited the Côte d&#x27;Azur.

=== Roman colonization ===
In 8 BC, the Emperor Augustus built an imposing trophy monument at La Turbie (the Trophy of the Alps or Trophy of Augustus) to mark the pacification of the region.

Roman towns, monuments and amphitheatres were built along the Côte d&#x27;Azur and many still survive, such as the amphitheatre and baths at Cimiez, above Nice, and the amphitheatre, Roman walls and other remains at Fréjus.
=== Barbarians and Christians ===
Roman Provence reached the height of its power and prosperity during the 2nd and 3rd centuries AD. In the mid-3rd century, Germanic peoples began to invade the region, and Roman power weakened.

In the same period, Christianity started to become a powerful force in the region. The first cathedrals were built in the 4th century, and bishoprics were established: in Fréjus at the end of the 4th century, Cimiez and Vence in 439, and Antibes in 442. The oldest Christian structure still in existence on the Côte d&#x27;Azur is the baptistery of Fréjus Cathedral, built at the end of the 5th century, which also saw the founding of the first monastery in the region, Lerins Monastery on an island off the coast at Cannes.

The fall of the Western Roman Empire in the first half of the 5th century was followed by invasions of Provence by the Visigoths, the Burgundians and the Ostrogoths. There was then a long period of wars and dynastic quarrels, which in turn led to further invasions by the Saracens and the Normans in the 9th century.

=== The Counts of Provence and the House of Grimaldi ===
Some peace was restored to the coast by the establishment in 879 of a new kingdom of Provence, ruled first by the Bosonids dynasty (879–1112), then by the Catalans (1112–1246), and finally by the Angevins (1246–1382, elder branch, 1382–1483 (younger branch).
In the 13th century, another powerful political force appeared, the House of Grimaldi. Descended from a Genoese nobleman expelled from Genoa by his rivals in 1271, members of the different branches of the Grimaldis took power in Monaco, Antibes and Nice, and built castles at Grimaud, Cagnes-sur-Mer and Antibes. Albert II, the current Prince of Monaco, is a descendant of the Grimaldis.

In 1388, the city of Nice and its surrounding territory, from the mouth of the Var to the Italian border, were separated from Provence and came under the protection of the House of Savoy. The territory was called the &quot;Comté de Nice&quot; after 1526, and thereafter its language, history and culture were separate from those of Provence until 1860, when it was re-attached to France under Napoleon III.

Provence retained its formal independence until 1480, when the last &quot;Comte de Provence&quot;, René I of Naples, died and left the Comté to his nephew, Charles du Maine, who in turn left it to Louis XI of France. In 1486, Provence formally became part of France.

=== Popularity with the British upper class in 18th and 19th centuries ===
Until the end of the 18th century, the area later known as the Côte d&#x27;Azur was a remote and impoverished region, known mostly for fishing, olive groves and the production of flowers for perfume (manufactured in Grasse).

A new phase began when the coast became a fashionable health resort for the British upper class in the late 18th century. The first British traveller to describe its benefits was the novelist Tobias Smollett, who visited Nice in 1763 when it was still an Italian city within the Kingdom of Sardinia. Smollett brought Nice and its warm winter climate to the attention of the British aristocracy with &quot;Travels through France and Italy&quot;, written in 1765. At about the same time, a Scottish doctor, John Brown, became famous for prescribing what he called climato-therapy, a change in climate, to cure a variety of diseases including tuberculosis, known then as consumption. The French historian Paul Gonnet wrote that, as a result, Nice was filled with &quot;a colony of pale and listless English women and listless sons of nobility near death&quot;.

In 1834, a British nobleman and politician named Henry Peter Brougham, First Baron Brougham and Vaux, who had played an important part in the abolition of the slave trade, travelled with his unwell daughter to the south of France, intending to go to Italy. A cholera epidemic in Italy forced him to stop at Cannes, where he enjoyed the climate and scenery so much that he bought land and built a villa. He began to spend his winters there and, owing to his fame, others followed: Cannes soon had a small British enclave.

Robert Louis Stevenson was a later British visitor who came for his health. In 1882 he rented a villa called La Solitude at Hyères, where he wrote much of &quot;A Child&#x27;s Garden of Verses&quot;.

=== Railway, gambling and royalty ===
In 1864, six years after Nice became part of France following the Second Italian War of Independence the first railway was completed, making Nice and the Riviera accessible to visitors from all over Europe. One hundred thousand visitors arrived in 1865. By 1874, residents of foreign enclaves in Nice, most of whom were British, numbered 25,000.
In the mid-19th century, British and French entrepreneurs began to see the potential of promoting tourism along the Côte d&#x27;Azur. At the time, gambling was illegal in France and Italy. In 1856, the Prince of Monaco, Charles III, began constructing a casino in Monaco, which was called a health spa to avoid criticism by the church. The casino was a failure, but in 1863 the Prince signed an agreement with François Blanc, a French businessman already operating a successful casino at Baden-Baden (southwestern Germany), to build a resort and new casino. Blanc arranged for steamships and carriages to take visitors from Nice to Monaco, and built hotels, gardens and a casino in a place called Spélugues. At the suggestion of his mother, Princess Caroline, Charles III renamed the place Monte Carlo after himself. When the railway reached Monte Carlo in 1870, many thousands of visitors began to arrive and the population of the principality of Monaco doubled.

The French Riviera soon became a popular destination for European royalty. Just days after the railway reached Nice in 1864, Tsar Alexander II of Russia visited on a private train, followed soon afterwards by Napoleon III and then Leopold II, the King of the Belgians.
Queen Victoria was a frequent visitor. In 1882 she stayed in Menton, and in 1891 spent several weeks at the Grand Hotel at Grasse. In 1892 she stayed at the Hotel Cost-belle in Hyères. In successive years from 1895 to 1899 she stayed in Cimiez in the hills above Nice. First, in 1895 and 1896, she patronised the Grand Hôtel, while in later years she and her staff took over the entire west wing of the Excelsior Hôtel Régina, which had been designed with her needs specifically in mind (part of which later became the home and studio of the renowned artist Henri Matisse). She travelled with an entourage of between sixty and a hundred, including chef, ladies in waiting, dentist, Indian servants, her own bed and her own food.

The Prince of Wales was a regular visitor to Cannes, starting in 1872. He frequented the Club Nautique, a private club on the Croisette, the fashionable seafront boulevard of Cannes. He visited there each spring for a two-month period, observing yacht races from shore while the royal yacht, Britannia, was sailed by professional crewmen. After he became King in 1901, he never again visited the French Riviera.

By the end of the 19th century the Côte d&#x27;Azur began to attract artistic painters, who appreciated the climate, the bright colors and clear light. Among them were Auguste Renoir, who settled in Cagnes-sur-Mer and in Mougins, Henri Matisse and Pablo Picasso.

=== Inter-war period, American visitors and decline of the aristocracy ===
The First World War brought down many of the royal houses of Europe and altered the nature and the calendar of the French Riviera. Following the war, greater numbers of Americans began arriving, with business moguls and celebrities eventually outnumbering aristocrats. The &#x27;High Society&#x27; scene moved from a winter season to a summer season.

Americans began coming to the south of France in the 19th century. Henry James set part of his novel &quot;The Ambassadors&quot; on the Riviera. James Gordon Bennett Jr., the son and heir of the founder of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, had a villa in Beaulieu. Industrialist John Pierpont Morgan gambled at Monte Carlo and bought 18th-century paintings by Fragonard in Grasse – shipping them to the Metropolitan Museum in New York.

A feature of the French Riviera in the inter-war years was the Train Bleu, an all first-class sleeper train which brought wealthy passengers down from Calais. It made its first trip in 1922, and carried Winston Churchill, Somerset Maugham, and the future King Edward VIII over the years.

While Europe was still recovering from the war and the American dollar was strong, American writers and artists started arriving on the Côte d&#x27;Azur. Edith Wharton wrote &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1920) at a villa near Hyères, winning the Pulitzer Prize for the novel (the first woman to do so). Dancer Isadora Duncan frequented Cannes and Nice, but died in 1927 when her scarf caught in a wheel of the Amilcar motor car in which she was a passenger and strangled her. The writer F. Scott Fitzgerald first visited with his wife Zelda in 1924, stopping at Hyères, Cannes and Monte Carlo – eventually staying at Saint-Raphaël, where he wrote much of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; and began &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;.

While Americans were largely responsible for making summer the high season, a French fashion designer, Coco Chanel, made sunbathing fashionable. She acquired a striking tan during the summer of 1923, and tans then became the fashion in Paris.

During the abdication crisis of the British Monarchy in 1936, Wallis Simpson, the intended bride of King Edward VIII, was staying at the Villa Lou Viei in Cannes, talking with the King by telephone each day. After his abdication, the Duke of Windsor (as he became) and his new wife stayed at the Villa La Croë on the Cap d&#x27;Antibes.

The English playwright and novelist Somerset Maugham also became a resident in 1926, buying the Villa La Mauresque toward the tip of Cap Ferrat, near Nice.

=== Second World War ===
When Germany invaded France in June 1940, the remaining British colony was evacuated to Gibraltar and eventually to Britain. American Jewish groups helped some of the Jewish artists living in the south of France, such as Marc Chagall, to escape to the United States. In August 1942, 600 Jews from Nice were rounded up by French police and sent to Drancy, and eventually to death camps. In all about 5,000 French Jews from Nice perished during the war.

Following D-Day in Normandy, Operation Dragoon (initially Operation Anvil), the code name for the Allied invasion of Southern France, commenced on 15 August 1944, when American parachute troops landed near Fréjus, and a fleet landed 60,000 troops of the American Seventh Army and French First Army between Cavalaire and Agay, east of Saint-Raphaël. German resistance was not as fanatical as Hitler and the High Command had ordered, and crumbled in days.

Saint-Tropez was badly damaged by German mines at the time of the liberation. The novelist Colette organized an effort to assure the town was rebuilt in its original style.

When the war ended, artists Marc Chagall and Pablo Picasso returned to live and work.

=== Post-war period and late 20th century ===
The Cannes Film Festival was launched in September 1946, marking the return of French cinema to world screens. The Festival Palace was built in 1949 on the site of the old Cercle Nautique, where the Prince of Wales had met his mistresses in the late 19th century. The release of the French film &quot;Et Dieu… créa la femme&quot; (&quot;And God Created Woman&quot;) in November 1956 was a major event for the Riviera, making an international star of Brigitte Bardot, and making an international tourist destination of Saint-Tropez, particularly for the new class of wealthy international travellers called the jet set.

The marriage of American film actress Grace Kelly to Prince Rainier of Monaco on 18 April 1956, attracted world attention once again. It was viewed on television by 30 million people.

During the 1960s, the Mayor of Nice, Jacques Médecin, decided to reduce the dependence of the Riviera on ordinary tourism, and to make it a destination for international congresses and conventions. He built the &quot;Palais des Congrès&quot; at the Acropolis in Nice, and founded a Chagall Museum and a Matisse Museum at Cimiez.

At the end of August 1997, Princess Diana and Dodi Fayed spent their last days together on his father&#x27;s yacht off Pampelonne Beach near Saint-Tropez, shortly before they died in the Alma Tunnel in Paris.

=== Environmental and Conservation Efforts ===
Île St Honorat: This serene island, home to monks and vineyards, has become a focal point for nature enthusiasts, reflecting the region&#x27;s dedication to preserving its natural heritage.

=== Climate ===
The French Riviera is mostly subtropical, featuring a Mediterranean climate, with sunny, hot, dry summers and mild winters. Winter temperatures are moderated by the Mediterranean; days of frost are rare. The average daily low temperature in Nice in January is ; the January average daily low temperature in Toulon is . The average high temperature in August in Nice is ; in Toulon the average daily high temperature is 

The Côte d&#x27;Azur receives more rainfall annually than Paris ( annually in Nice and in Toulon compared with in Paris), but the rainy days are much less frequent and the Riviera is considerably sunnier; 111 rainy days a year in Paris compared with 61 days in Toulon and 63 in Nice. Rain is generally more common in the Autumn and Winter months while the summers are drier. Toulon has 2,793 hours of sunshine a year, Nice has 2,668 hours.

Micro-climates exist in these coastal regions, and there can be great differences in the weather between various locations. Strong winds such as the mistral, a cold dry wind from the northwest or from the east, are another characteristic, particularly in the winter. Nice, in particular is surrounded by mountains to the North, protecting it from the Mistral winds making it feel milder on sunny days.

The Sirocco is a southerly wind, coming from the African continent and often felt on the Mediterranean coast of Europe. It is a hot and humid wind, occasionally carrying sand from the Sahara which is then deposited in coastal areas across Southern Europe.

The French Riviera is one of the mildest locations in the world for its latitude, owing to the Gulf Stream which moderates the temperatures in Western Europe, particularly in winter and the warming effect of the Mediterranean Sea. Because of this, the region boasts a long growing season and supports the growth of exotic flora such as Citrus Fruits and Palm Trees. Snow is very uncommon in the winters and the long, hot and sunny summers have long been a draw for tourists since the days of British Aristocracy.

==== Nice and Alpes-Maritimes ====
Nice and the Alpes-Maritimes département are sheltered by the Alps. The winds are usually gentle, from the sea to the land, though sometimes the mistral blows strongly from the northwest, or, turned by the mountains, from the east. In 1956 a mistral from the northwest reached at Nice Airport. Sometimes, in summer, the sirocco brings high temperatures and reddish desert sand from the Sahara (see Winds of Provence).

Rain can be torrential, particularly in the autumn, when storms and rain are caused by the difference between the colder air inland and the warm Mediterranean water temperature (). The rainiest months are September ( average rainfall); October (); November () and December ().

Snow on the coast is rare, falling on average once every ten years. 1956 was exceptional, when blanketed the coast. In January 1985 the coast between Cannes and Menton received . In the mountains, snow is present from November to May.

==== Var ====
The département of Var (which includes Saint-Tropez and Hyères) has a climate slightly warmer, drier and sunnier than Nice and Alpes-Maritimes, but is less sheltered from the wind.

The mistral, which brings cold and dry air down from the upper Alpine regions via the Rhône valley and extends with diminishing intensity along the Côte d&#x27;Azur, blows frequently during the winter. Strong winds blow for about 75 days a year in Fréjus.

== Events and festivals ==
Several major events take place:

<text>Sir Frederic Madden KH (16 February 1801 – 8 March 1873) was an English palaeographer.

==Biography==
Born in Portsmouth, he was the son of William John Madden (1757–1833), a captain in the Royal Marines of Irish origin, and his wife Sarah Carter (1759–1833). From his childhood he displayed a flair for linguistic and antiquarian studies. In 1826 he was engaged by the British Museum to assist in the preparation of the classified catalogue of printed books, and in 1828 he became assistant keeper of manuscripts. In 1832 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. At the age of 32 he was made a knight, entitling him to the initials KH after his name, and in 1837 he succeeded Josiah Forshall as Keeper of Manuscripts. He did not get on well with his colleagues, and retired in 1866.
Madden was the leading palaeographer of his day. However, his ignorance of German prevented his ranking high as a philologist, although he paid much attention to the early dialectical forms of French and English. His minor contributions to antiquarian research were numerous: the best known, perhaps, was his dissertation on the spelling of Shakespeare&#x27;s name, which, mainly on the strength of a signature found in John Florio&#x27;s copy of the work of Montaigne, he contended should be &quot;Shakspere&quot;. This led to a lengthy debate and to a period when the &quot;Shakspere&quot; spelling nearly became the norm.

On his death at his home in St Stephen&#x27;s Square, London, he bequeathed his journals and other private papers to the Bodleian Library, where they were to remain unopened until 1920.

==Scholarship==
He edited for the Roxburghe Club &quot;Havelok the Dane&quot; (1828), discovered by himself among the Laudian manuscripts in the Bodleian Library, &quot;William and the Werwolf&quot; (1832) and the old English versions of the &quot;Gesta Romanorum&quot; (1838). In 1839 he edited the ancient metrical romances of &quot;Syr Gawayne&quot; for the Bannatyne Club, and in 1847 Layamon&#x27;s &quot;Brut&quot;, with a prose translation, for the Society of Antiquaries. In 1850 the magnificent edition, in parallel columns, of what are known as the &quot;Wycliffite&quot; versions of the Bible, from the original manuscripts, upon which he and his coadjutor, Josiah Forshall, had been engaged for twenty years, was published by the University of Oxford.

In 1866–69 he edited the &quot;Historia Minor&quot; of Matthew Paris for the Rolls Series. In 1833 he wrote the text of Henry Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Illuminated Ornaments of the Middle Ages&quot;; and in 1850 he edited the English translation of Joseph Balthazar Silvestre&#x27;s &quot;Paléographie universelle&quot;.

He was one of the three contributors to &quot;Collectanea Topographica et Genealogica&quot;.

== Conservation ==
In April 1837, when still the Assistant Keeper of Manuscripts, Madden was shown a garret of the old museum building which contained a large number of burnt and damaged fragments and codices of vellum manuscripts. Madden immediately identified them as part of the Cotton library collection, which had been badly damaged in a fire of 1731.

During his tenure as Keeper of Manuscripts, Madden undertook extensive conservation work on the Cotton manuscripts (often in the face of opposition from the museum&#x27;s board, who deemed the enterprise prohibitively expensive). In collaboration with the bookbinder Henry Gough, he developed a conservation strategy that restored even the most badly damaged fragments and manuscripts to a usable state. Vellum sheets were cleaned and flattened and mounted in paper frames. Where possible, they were rebound in their original codices.

As well as the fragments found in the garret, he carried out conservation work on the rest of the collection. Many manuscripts had become brittle and fragile, including the codex that contains the only known copy of Beowulf (Cotton Vittelius A xv). By 1845, the work was largely complete, though Madden was to suffer one more setback when a fire broke out in the museum bindery, destroying completely some further works from the collection.

==Family==
In the summer of 1837 in the district of Edmonton, then in Middlesex, he married Emily Sarah Robinson (1813–1873). She was the daughter of William Robinson (1777–1848), lawyer and historian of Tottenham, and his wife Mary Ridge (1781–1856), daughter of the Chichester banker William Ridge. Some sources suggest that William Robinson was the illegitimate son of Anne Nelson, unmarried sister of Horatio Nelson, 1st Viscount Nelson.

Frederic and Emily had six known children, the eldest being Frederic William Madden (1839–1904), who in 1860 married Elizabeth Sarah Rannie (1839–1893) and had four children. Frederic, a numismatist of note, was Secretary and Bursar of Brighton College 1874–88 and then Chief Librarian of the Public Library in Brighton 1888–1902.

<text>Eustace I, Count of Boulogne, was a nobleman and founder of the Boulogne branch of the House of Flanders. He held the county of Boulogne from 1024 until his death in 1047.

==Life==
Eustace was the elder son of Count Baldwin II of Boulogne and Adelina of Holland. He succeeded his father as count of Boulogne in 1024. Eustace was also the count of Lens. In 1028 Eustace confirmed the foundation of a college of canons in his castle at Lens and despite accounts of Lens passing to Baldwin V of Flanders circa 1036 it was still held by Eustace and was passed to his son Lambert at his death.

During the minority of Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders, Eustace&#x27;s grandfather, Arnulf III, Count of Boulogne had broken free of Flanders and operated as an independent prince, as did Eustace&#x27;s father and Eustace himself. In 995, having attained his majority, Baldwin IV attempted to recover several of the independently held castles and to expand the Flemish borders. This had caused considerable animosity between Baldwin IV, Count of Flanders and Eustace&#x27;s father, but when Baldwin IV&#x27;s son Baldwin V succeeded him in 1035 Eustace and Baldwin V of Flanders cooperated on several ventures including several charters and in limiting the powers of the Castellan-advocates of several abbeys including the Abbey of Saint Bertin in Flanders.

Eustace was allied to the ducal house of Normandy by the marriage of his son Eustace II to Goda, niece of Richard II. This had far reaching alliances to other branches of these families including that of Edward the Confessor, King of England. Under Eustace the counts of Boulogne rose to great prominence in Northern France. Eustace I died in 1047.

Eustace was apparently a patron of Samer Abbey near Calais and he is said to have been buried there.

==Family and children==

Eustace married Matilda of Louvain, daughter of Lambert I of Louvain and Gerberga of Lower Lorraine and had:

*Eustace II of Boulogne.
*Godfrey, Bishop of Paris from 1061 to 1095
*Lambert II, Count of Lens.
*Gerberga, married Frederick, Duke of Lower Lorraine

<text>Gabriel Monod (7 March 1844 – 10 April 1912) was a French historian, the nephew of Adolphe Monod.

==Biography==
Born in Ingouville, Seine-Maritime, he was educated at Le Havre then went to Paris to complete his education, lodging with the de Pressensé family. The influence of Edmond de Pressensé, a pastor and large-minded theologian, and of Madame de Pressensé, a woman of superior intellect and refined feeling, who devoted her life to educational works and charity, made a great impression on him. In 1865 he left the École normale supérieure, and went to Germany, where he studied at the University of Göttingen and Humboldt University in Berlin. The teaching of Georg Waitz definitely directed his studies towards the history of the Middle Ages. Returning to France in 1868 he was nominated by Victor Duruy to give lectures on history, following the method used in German seminaries, at the École des hautes études.

When the Franco-Prussian War broke out, Gabriel Monod, with his cousins Alfred and Sarah Monod, organized an ambulance with which he followed the whole campaign, from Sedan to Le Mans. He wrote a small book of memoirs of this campaign, &quot;Allemands et Français&quot; (1871), in which he spoke of the conquerors without bitterness; this attitude was all the more praiseworthy as his mother was originally from Alsace, and he was unable to resign himself to the loss of Alsace and Lorraine.

The war being over he returned to teaching. At this period of his life he wrote &quot;Grégoire de Tours et Marius d&#x27;Avenche&quot; (1872); &quot;Frédégaire&quot;, whose history, taken from original manuscripts, he published in 1885; a translation of a book of W. Junghans, &quot;Histoire critique des règnes de Childerich et de Chlodovech&quot;, with introduction and notes (1879); &quot;Études critiques sur les sources de l&#x27;histoire carolingienne&quot; (1898, 1st part only published); and &quot;Bibliographie de l&#x27;histoire de France&quot; (1888). He himself said that his pupils were his best books; he intended to teach them not so much new facts as the way to study, endeavouring to develop in them an idea of criticism and truth. They showed their gratitude by dedicating a book to him in 1896, &quot;Études d&#x27;histoire du moyen âge&quot;, and after his retirement in 1905 by having his features engraved on a slab (see &quot;À Gabriel Monod, en souvenir de son enseignement: École pratique des hautes études&quot;, 1868–1905, &quot;École normale supérieure&quot;, 1880–1904. 26 May 1907).

Monod married Olga Herzen, daughter of Russian political thinker Alexander Herzen, in 1873.

In 1876 he founded the &quot;Revue Historique&quot;, which rapidly became a great authority on scientific education. Some of his articles in this and other periodicals were put together in book form, &quot;Les Maîtres de l&#x27;histoire: Ernest Renan, Hippolyte Taine, Jules Michelet&quot; (1894); &quot;Portraits et souvenirs&quot; (1897: on Victor Hugo, Fustel de Coulanges, Victor Duruy, etc.) In 1903 he published &quot;Souvenirs d&#x27;adolescence&quot;, and in 1905 &quot;Études sur Michelet, sa vie et ses Œuvres&quot;.

Gabriel Monod died in 1912 in Versailles and is buried there in the Cimetière des Gonards.

<text>John Sessions (born John Marshall; 11 January 1953 – 2 November 2020) was a British actor and comedian. He was known as a regular performer on comedy improvisation show &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, as co-creator, co-writer and co-star of the sitcom &quot;Stella Street&quot;, as a panellist on &quot;QI&quot;, and as a character actor in numerous films, both in the UK and Hollywood.

==Early life==
John Sessions was born as John Marshall on 11 January 1953 to John and Esme (née Richardson) Marshall. His family was Scottish; his father was a gas engineer from Largs, Ayrshire, and his mother was from Glasgow. He had an older brother, Bill, and a twin sister, Maggie. He was raised in Bedford and St Albans.

===Education===
Sessions was educated at Bedford Modern School, an independent school for boys (now co-educational), and Verulam School, St Albans, followed by the University College of North Wales in Bangor, from which he graduated with an MA in English literature. At university, he had begun to appear to audiences with his comedy in shows such as &quot;Look back in Bangor&quot; and &quot;Marshall Arts&quot;. He later studied for a PhD on John Cowper Powys at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, although he did not complete the doctorate.

This period in his life was unhappy. In a &quot;Worst of Times&quot; column for &quot;The Independent&quot; from around 1990, he talked of how the freezing Canadian weather had depressed him, he was smoking &quot;far too many cigarettes&quot; and &quot;had a couple of disastrous flings&quot;, and described his PhD dissertation as &quot;200 pages of rubbish&quot;.

==Career==
Sessions attended RADA in the late 1970s, studying alongside Kenneth Branagh; the two would work together on many occasions later in their careers. His name change occurred when he became a performer, owing to the presence of a John Marshall already on the Equity register. In the early 1980s, he worked on the small venue comedy circuit with largely improvised freewheeling fantasy monologues. He topped a double bill with French and Saunders during this period. He had a number of small parts in films including &quot;The Sender&quot; (1982), &quot;The Bounty&quot; (1984) and &quot;Castaway&quot; (1986).

Sessions played to his strengths in improvisation and comedy with his one-man stage show &quot;Napoleon&quot;, which ran in London&#x27;s West End for some time in the mid-1980s. He and Stephen Fry were the only two regular panellists on the original radio broadcast of &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot; in the late 1980s. When the show, still hosted by Clive Anderson, made the transition to television, Fry departed from regular appearances, but Sessions remained the featured panellist for the first season. A frequent player in the second, he did not appear again after his two appearances in the third series.

A gifted impressionist who also voiced characters for &quot;Spitting Image&quot;, he drew heavily on his extensive literary education and developed a reputation for being &quot;a bit of a swot&quot;, being able to quote extensive passages of text and make endless cultural and historical references. His ready ability to switch between accents and personae meanwhile allowed his career in improvisation to flourish. On &quot;Whose Line Is It Anyway?&quot;, his ability to affect the contrived witticisms of &quot;Restoration Comedy&quot; became an audience favourite. In 1987 he played Lionel Zipser in Channel 4&#x27;s mini-series &quot;Porterhouse Blue&quot;.

In 1989, he starred in his own one-man TV show, &quot;John Sessions&quot;. Filmed at the Donmar Warehouse in London, the show involved Sessions performing before a live audience who were invited to nominate a person, a location and two objects from a selection, around which Sessions would improvise a surreal performance for the next half-hour. This series prompted two further one-man TV shows: &quot;John Sessions&#x27; Tall Tales&quot; (1991) and &quot;John Sessions&#x27; Likely Stories&quot; (1994). Although billed as improvisation, these were increasingly pre-planned. In an interview headlined &#x27;Who The Hell Does John Sessions Think He Is?&#x27; in &quot;Q&quot; magazine in the early 1990s, he admitted that some of his improv was not entirely spontaneous, but that if it were advertised as scripted &#x27;it had to be funnier&#x27;. 1991 also saw Sessions in the BBC drama &quot;Jute City&quot;, a three-part thriller based around a sinister Masonic bunch of villains, co-starring with vocalist Fish (Derek W. Dick, singer in the first incarnation of rock band Marillion).

In 1994, Sessions auditioned for the role of the Eighth Doctor in &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. In 1996, he was commissioned by the Royal Academy of Arts to write &quot;Paint, said Fred&quot;, the life of Frederic, Lord Leighton, the pre-eminent Victorian artist, in a one-man show that used his comic writing abilities and his gift for impersonation.

Sessions also starred in &quot;Stella Street&quot;, a surreal &quot;soap opera&quot; comedy about a fantasy suburban British street inhabited by celebrities such as Michael Caine and Al Pacino, which he conceived with fellow impressionist Phil Cornwell, the two of them playing several parts in each episode.

Sessions later returned to formal acting, with parts ranging from James Boswell (to Robbie Coltrane&#x27;s Samuel Johnson) in the UK TV comedy drama &quot;Boswell and Johnson&#x27;s Tour of the Western Isles&quot; (1993) to Doctor Prunesquallor in the BBC adaptation of &quot;Gormenghast&quot; (2000) and in 1998 as Hercules Fortesque, a BBC HR manager in the BBC mini-series &quot;In The Red&quot; adapted from the book and the BBC radio series by Mark Taverner. He provided the voice of the Professor in &quot;The Adventures of Pinocchio&quot; in 1996. He also appeared in several Shakespeare films, playing Macmorris in Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Henry V&quot; (1989), Philostrate in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; (1999), and Salerio in the movie &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; (2004), with Al Pacino and Jeremy Irons. He also contributed &quot;Sonnet 62&quot; to the 2002 compilation album &quot;When Love Speaks&quot; (EMI Classics), which consists of famous actors and musicians interpreting Shakespearean sonnets and play excerpts.

In between appearing in regular film and TV roles, Sessions made appearances on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; and, more recently, as a semi-regular panellist on &quot;QI&quot;. He was one of four panellists, including the permanent Alan Davies, on the inaugural episode of &quot;QI&quot;, in which he demonstrated his effortless memory of the birth and death dates of various historical figures (while simultaneously and apologetically deeming the knowledge of such facts &quot;a sickness&quot;).

On radio, Sessions was a guest in December 1997 on the regular BBC Radio 3 show &quot;Private Passions&quot;, presented by Michael Berkeley, not as himself but as a 112-year-old Viennese percussionist called Manfred Sturmer, who told anecdotes (about Brahms, Clara Schumann, Richard Strauss, Arnold Schoenberg and others) so realistically that some listeners did not realise that the whole thing was a hoax. Other Sessions&#x27; creations appeared on Berkeley&#x27;s show in subsequent years. Sessions had taken the role of narrating the popular Asterix stories for audiobook, since the death of Willie Rushton.

Sessions made a guest appearance in a special webcast version of &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, in a story called &quot;Death Comes to Time&quot;, in which he played General Tannis. He occasionally appeared in the BBC series &quot;Judge John Deed&quot; as barrister Brian Cantwell QC. In 2007, he guest-starred in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; audio adventure &quot;100&quot;.

In 2006, Sessions presented some of the BBC&#x27;s coverage of The Proms and featured in one of the two &quot;Jackanory&quot; specials, voicing the characters and playing the storyteller in the audiobook version of Paul Stewart and Chris Riddell&#x27;s children&#x27;s book &quot;Muddle Earth&quot;. In 2007 he appeared in the final episode of the second series of &quot;Hotel Babylon&quot;, playing hotel owner Donovan Credo, and as Geoffrey Howe in 2009&#x27;s &quot;Margaret&quot;. In 2010, he played Kenny Prince in &quot;Sherlock&quot;.

Sessions appeared in the teen drama TV show &quot;Skins&quot; in 2011 as one of two adopted fathers of Franky Fitzgerald. He also appeared as a Brummie vicar in an episode of &quot;Outnumbered&quot; on BBC One.

He had the distinction of playing two British prime ministers in films, Harold Wilson in &quot;Made in Dagenham&quot; and Edward Heath in &quot;The Iron Lady&quot;. In 2013 he appeared in the premiere production of the new play &quot;Longing&quot;.

In 2014, he made a short appearance in &quot;Outlander&quot; as Arthur Duncan. In October 2014, Sessions was heard as Gus, the mysterious, psychopathic computer that controlled the eponymous train/spaceship in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Mummy on the Orient Express&quot; as well as appearing as Mycroft Holmes in the 2015 film &quot;Mr. Holmes&quot;.

In addition to appearing in the role of Arthur Lowe in the 2015 drama &quot;We&#x27;re Doomed! The Dad&#x27;s Army Story&quot;. he also played Dr Hermann in the 2016 film &quot;Florence Foster Jenkins&quot;.

Sessions narrated a 10-part radio adaptation of &quot;The Adventures of Captain Bobo&quot; on Fun Kids in 2020, which was still running at the time of his death.

==Personal life==
Sessions was gay. He was outed in a 1994 &quot;Evening Standard&quot; article, while starring in the comedy &quot;My Night with Reg&quot;, a play set in London&#x27;s gay community.

A Eurosceptic, Sessions voiced his support for the UK Independence Party (UKIP) in 2014. He stated, &quot;I get so bored with people going, &#x27;UKIP are a bunch of racists.&#x27; They&#x27;re nothing of the kind. Nigel Farage talks more sense than the rest of the politicians put together. The United States of Europe is madness.&quot;

He was also critical of Scottish nationalism, and argued for the abolition of the Scottish, Welsh and European parliaments. In August 2014, he was one of 200 public figures who were signatories to a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in September&#x27;s referendum on that issue.

== Death ==
Sessions died at his home in Raynes Park, South London on 2 November 2020, aged 67. His agent noted that he had a heart condition; his entry in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, citing his death certificate, gives the exact cause of death as &quot;an excess of aspirin, paracetamol, and caffeine&quot;.

The team behind the BBC television programme &quot;QI&quot; praised his &quot;incredible wit and encyclopaedic knowledge [which] played a huge part in the show&#x27;s history.&quot;

<doc id="266401" wikidata="Q116248" url="?curid=266401" title="Adolphe Monod">
<text>Adolphe-Louis-Frédéric-Théodore Monod (21 January 1802 – 6 April 1856) was a French Protestant churchman. His elder brother was Frédéric Monod.

He was born in Copenhagen, where his father, Jean Monod (Sept. 5, 1765 – April 23, 1836; himself the eldest son of pastor Gaspard Joël Monod /1717-1782/ and his wife Suzanne Madeleine Puerari /1739-1799/), was a pastor of the French Reformed church and where Jean Monod met his wife and consequently Adolph&#x27;s mother, Louise-Philippine de Coninck (1775-1851). Educated at Paris and Geneva, Adolph began his life-work in 1825 as founder and pastor of a Protestant church in Naples, moving to Lyon in 1827. Here his evangelical preaching, and especially a sermon on the duties of communicants (&quot;Qui doit communier&quot;?), led to his deposition by the Catholic Minister of education and religion. Instead of leaving Lyon he began to preach in a hall and then in a chapel.

On 2 September 1829 he married Hannah Honyman (1799-1868) in Lyon. They had seven children, including pastor André John William Honyman Monod (1834–1916), philanthropist and feminist Alexandrine Elisabeth Sarah Monod (1836–1912), Émilie Monod, Camille Monod (1843–1910).

In 1836 he took a professorship in the theological college of Montauban, removing in 1847 to Paris as preacher at the Oratoire. He died in Paris on 6 April 1856.

Monod was considered by some the foremost Protestant preacher of 19th-century France (e.g. Guillaume Guizot (1833-1892), son of the French statesman and Protestant historian François Guizot (1787-1874) referred to him in an article published in the “Journal des débats politiques et littéraires” (Journal of political and literary debates) on April 11, 1856, i.e. a few days after Adolphe Monod&#x27;s funeral, as &quot;one of the foremost Christian speakers of his time.&quot; He published three volumes of sermons in 1830, another, &quot;La Crédulité de l&#x27;incrédule&quot; in 1844, and two more in 1855. Two further volumes appeared after his death. One of his most influential books was the posthumous, &quot;Les Adieux d&#x27;Adolphe Monod à ses Amis et à l&#x27;Église&quot; (1857).

<doc id="266402" wikidata="Q316709" url="?curid=266402" title="Steve Coogan">
<text>Stephen John Coogan (; born 14 October 1965) is an English-Irish actor, comedian, screenwriter and producer. His accolades include four BAFTA Awards and three British Comedy Awards, and nominations for two Academy Awards and a Golden Globe Award. He is best known for his character Alan Partridge, a socially inept and politically incorrect media personality, which he developed while working with Armando Iannucci and Chris Morris on &quot;On the Hour&quot; (1991–1992) and &quot;The Day Today&quot; (1994). Partridge has featured in several television series, such as &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot; (1997–2002), and the film &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot; (2013). 

Coogan began his career in the 1980s as a voice actor on the satirical puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot; and providing voice-overs for television advertisements. He grew in prominence in the film industry in 2002, after starring in &quot;The Parole Officer&quot; and &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot;. He continued to appear in films such as &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; (2004), the Night at the Museum trilogy (2006–2014), &quot;Tropic Thunder&quot; (2008), &quot;Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians: The Lightning Thief&quot; (2010), &quot;Our Idiot Brother&quot; (2011), &quot;Ruby Sparks&quot; (2012), &quot;Irreplaceable You&quot; (2018), and &quot;Greed&quot; (2019). He co-starred as himself with Rob Brydon in &quot;A Cock and Bull Story&quot; (2005) and the BBC series &quot;The Trip&quot; (2010), &quot;The Trip to Italy&quot; (2014), &quot;The Trip to Spain&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Trip to Greece&quot; (2020), all of which were also re-edited into films.

In 1999, Coogan co-founded the production company Baby Cow Productions with Henry Normal. In 2013, he co-wrote, produced, and starred in the film &quot;Philomena&quot;, which earned him nominations at the Golden Globes and BAFTAs, and at the Academy Awards for Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Picture. Coogan has also played dramatic roles, including &quot;Marie Antoinette&quot; (2006), &quot;What Maisie Knew&quot; (2012), &quot;The Look of Love&quot; (2013) and &quot;The Dinner&quot; (2017). For his portrayal of Stan Laurel in &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot; (2018), he earned a BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role nomination. For his portrayal of Jimmy Savile in the BBC drama &quot;The Reckoning&quot; (2023), he received a nomination for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor.

==Early life ==
Stephen John Coogan was born on 14 October 1965 in Middleton, Lancashire, the son of housewife Kathleen (née Coonan) and IBM engineer Anthony &quot;Tony&quot; Coogan. He has four brothers and one sister, and was raised Roman Catholic in what he described as a &quot;lower-middle or upper-working class&quot; family which emphasised the values of education. His elder brother Martin is a musician, while his younger brother Brendan is a presenter. Coogan&#x27;s mother is Irish and hails from County Mayo, while his father was born in Manchester to Irish parents Margaret (from County Kilkenny) and Thomas Coogan (a tailor from County Cork), who had settled there shortly before the First World War. During the 1950s, his paternal grandfather established a dance hall for Irish immigrants. Coogan has stated that he had a happy childhood, and his parents fostered children on a short-term basis.

Coogan lived on Manchester New Road in Alkrington. His father stood for the SDP-Liberal Alliance in the Middleton South ward at the Rochdale Borough Council elections in both May 1983 and May 1984. He was also chairman of the Catholic Grammar Schools Parents Association, and protested against the proposal by the Salford Roman Catholic Diocesan Schools Commission to close the sixth form (which ultimately did not happen). Coogan attended St. Thomas More Roman Catholic Primary School and Cardinal Langley Roman Catholic High School. Coogan passed two O-levels in 1983, which were likely re-take exams, aged 17. In 1984 he gained 4 A-levels: English Literature, British Government and Politics, Art, and General Studies. In the same year, his brother Kevin acquired nine O-levels at the same school and took part in local and regional sports competitions, notably in basketball and cross country running.

Coogan&#x27;s sister trained to be a teacher at the nearby Hopwood Hall College. As a family, it was assumed that all the children would become teachers. Coogan had a talent for impersonation and wanted to go to drama school, despite being advised by a teacher that it could lead to a precarious profession. After five failed applications to various drama schools in London, he received a place at the theatre company New Music before gaining a place at the Manchester Polytechnic School of Drama, where he met future collaborator John Thomson.

==Career==
===1989–2002: Breakthrough as Alan Partridge ===
Coogan began his career as a comic and impressionist, performing regularly in Ipswich, before working as a voice artist for television advertisements and the satirical puppet show &quot;Spitting Image&quot;. In 1988, he provided vocals for the acid house record &#x27;Don&#x27;t Believe the Hype&#x27; credited to Mista E. The record peaked at number 41 in December 1988, narrowly missing the main chart rundown. In 1989, he appeared in a series of specially shot sketches in the Observation round in the long-running ITV game show &quot;The Krypton Factor&quot;. In 1992, Coogan won the Perrier Award at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe for his performance with long-time collaborator John Thomson, and starred alongside him and Caroline Aherne in a one-off Granada TV sketch show, &quot;The Dead Good Show&quot;. His most prominent characters developed at this time were Paul Calf, a stereotypical working class Mancunian, and his sister Pauline, played by Coogan in drag. While working on the Radio 4 comedy &quot;On the Hour&quot;, Coogan created Alan Partridge, a parody of British sports presenters, with the producer Armando Iannucci. Coogan described Partridge as a Little Englander, with right-wing values and poor taste. He is socially inept, often offending his guests, and has an inflated sense of importance and celebrity. According to Coogan, Partridge was originally a &quot;one-note, sketchy character&quot; and &quot;freak show&quot;, but slowly became refined as a dysfunctional alter ego.

In 1992, Partridge hosted a spin-off Radio 4 spoof chat show, &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You with Alan Partridge&quot;. &quot;On the Hour&quot; transferred to television as &quot;The Day Today&quot; in 1994, followed by &quot;Knowing Me, Knowing You&quot; later that year. In 1997, Coogan starred as Partridge in a BBC sitcom, &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, written by Coogan, Iannucci and Peter Baynham, following Partridge&#x27;s life in a roadside hotel working for a small radio station. It earned two BAFTAs and was followed by a second series in 2002. After &quot;I&#x27;m Alan Partridge&quot;, Coogan tired of Partridge and limited him to smaller roles. Coogan said he did not want to say goodbye to Partridge, and that &quot;as long as I can do my other things, that, to me, is the perfect balance&quot;. He later said that Partridge had once been an &quot;albatross&quot; but had become &quot;a battered, comfortable old leather jacket&quot;. Critics have praised Partridge&#x27;s complexity, realism and pathos. &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; called him a British national treasure and the &quot;Guardian&quot; described him as &quot;one of the greatest and most beloved comic creations of the last few decades&quot;. Partridge is credited with influencing cringe comedies such as &quot;The Inbetweeners&quot;, &quot;Nighty Night&quot; and &quot;Peep Show&quot;. In 2001 a poll by Channel 4, Partridge was voted seventh on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters. 

Paul Calf began as a character named &#x27;Duncan Disorderly&#x27; in Coogan&#x27;s early stand-up routines. Calf first came to wider public notice in 1993, with several appearances on &quot;Saturday Zoo&quot;, a late-night variety show presented by Jonathan Ross on Channel 4. Paul has appeared in two video diaries, an episode of &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Run&quot;, and in various stand-up performances. He is an unemployed Mancunian wastrel with a particular hatred of students. His catchphrase, spoken to disparage something or someone, is &quot;Bag o&#x27; shite&quot;. Paul lives in a council house in the fictional town of Ottle with his mother and his sister, Pauline Calf (also played by Coogan). His father, Pete Calf (played by Coogan in &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Run&quot;) died some time before the first video diary was made. For a long time he was obsessed with getting back together with his ex-girlfriend, Julie. Paul&#x27;s best friend is &quot;Fat&quot; Bob (played by John Thomson), a car mechanic who eventually married Pauline. Paul supports Manchester City and is very partial to Wagon Wheels. He wears Burton suits, sports a bleached mullet hairstyle, and drives a Ford Cortina. &quot;Pauline Calf&#x27;s Wedding Video&quot; won the 1995 BAFTA Television Award for Best Comedy.

Other Coogan creations include Tommy Saxondale, Duncan Thicket, Ernest Eckler and Portuguese Eurovision Song Contest winner Tony Ferrino. Duncan Thicket has appeared in a tour of live shows. Coogan, along with his writing partner Henry Normal, founded Baby Cow Productions in 1999. Together, they have served as executive producers for shows such as &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;, &quot;Nighty Night&quot;, &quot;Marion and Geoff&quot;, &quot;Gavin &amp; Stacey&quot;, &quot;Human Remains&quot; and &quot;Moone Boy&quot;, as well as the Alan Partridge feature film &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot;. They have also produced &quot;Where Are the Joneses?&quot;, an online sitcom which uses wiki technology to allow the audience to upload scripts and storyline ideas. Other TV shows he has starred in include &quot;Coogan&#x27;s Run&quot;, &quot;Dr. Terrible&#x27;s House of Horrible&quot;, &quot;Monkey Trousers&quot; and &quot;Saxondale&quot;. Coogan has provided voices for the animated series &quot;I Am Not an Animal&quot; and &quot;Bob and Margaret&quot;, two Christmas specials featuring &quot;Robbie the Reindeer&quot;, and an episode of the BBC Radio Four spoof sci-fi series &quot;Nebulous&quot;. He played the Gnat in the 1998 TV adaptation of &quot;Alice Through the Looking-Glass&quot; starring Kate Beckinsale,

===2003–2009: Film roles and standup ===
Coogan starred in BBC2&#x27;s &quot;The Private Life of Samuel Pepys&quot; in 2003, and &quot;Cruise of the Gods&quot; in 2002 and portrayed Factory Records boss, Tony Wilson in the film, &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002). In 2006, he had a cameo in the &quot;Little Britain&quot; Christmas special as a pilot taking Lou and Andy to Disneyland. Coogan has played himself several times on screen. First, in one of the vignettes of Jim Jarmusch&#x27;s 2003 film &quot;Coffee and Cigarettes&quot;, alongside Alfred Molina. Second, in 2006 Coogan starred with Rob Brydon in Michael Winterbottom&#x27;s &quot;A Cock and Bull Story&quot;, a self-referential film of the &quot;unfilmable&quot; self-referential novel &quot;Tristram Shandy&quot; by Laurence Sterne. In the film, Coogan plays a fictional, womanising version of himself. The first film that Coogan co-wrote with Henry Normal was &quot;The Parole Officer&quot;, in which he also acted alongside Ben Miller and Lena Headey. He has an uncredited cameo in &quot;Hot Fuzz&quot;, scripted by &quot;Shaun of the Dead&quot; writers Simon Pegg and Edgar Wright. He also starred in the &quot;Night at the Museum&quot; trilogy in which he played Octavius, a miniature Roman general figure, alongside Owen Wilson&#x27;s Jedediah, a miniature cowboy figure. In 2007, Coogan played a psychiatrist on Larry David&#x27;s &quot;Curb Your Enthusiasm&quot; on HBO, and in 2008, starred in the BBC1 drama &quot;Sunshine&quot;. 

In March 2008, it was confirmed that Coogan would return to doing comedy as part of his first stand-up tour in ten years. The tour, named &quot;Steve Coogan as Alan Partridge and other less successful characters&quot;, saw the return of some of his old characters including Paul Calf and Alan Partridge. Reviews of the tour were mixed. Much of the criticism focused on the apparent unrehearsed quality of some of the performances and on Coogan&#x27;s nervous stage presence. &quot;Chortle&quot; comedy guide described it as &quot;most definitely a show of two-halves: the superlative Alan Partridge plus a collection of characters that are not only less successful, but woefully less funny&quot;.

As the tour progressed and the problems were ironed out, reviews were very positive. Dominic Maxwell of &quot;The Times&quot; described the show as &quot;twice as entertaining as most other comedy shows this year&quot;. Brian Logan of &quot;The Guardian&quot; awarded it four stars and described it as &quot;shamelessly funny&quot;. Reviews such as the one from the Trent FM Arena exemplified how much the show had improved after dealing with the glitches on its first few dates: &quot;When Steve Coogan first brought this show to Nottingham last month, the reviews were poor... the intervening weeks have made a big difference, and last night&#x27;s audience at the Trent FM Arena went home happy. More please, and soon.&quot;

In 2008, BBC Worldwide bought a 25% stake in the production company. It did not offer the largest sum, but was chosen by Coogan and Normal owing to their previous work with and strong connection with the BBC. In 2009, Coogan was featured, alongside Vic Reeves, Bob Mortimer and Julia Davis, in the spoof documentary TV film &quot;Steve Coogan – The Inside Story&quot;. The same year he spoke on the influence of Monty Python on his comedy when he appeared in the television documentary, &quot;Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)&quot;.

=== 2010–2019: &quot;The Trip&quot; and &quot;Philomena&quot; ===

In 2010, he worked again with Brydon and Michael Winterbottom for the partially improvised BBC2 sitcom &quot;The Trip&quot;, in which he and Brydon tour northern restaurants. The movie was followed in 2014 with the film, &quot;The Trip to Italy&quot;, about him and Brydon taking a food-tasting trip through Italy, followed by &quot;The Trip to Spain&quot; (2017) and &quot;The Trip to Greece&quot; (2020). He worked again with director Winterbottom in &quot;The Look of Love&quot; (2013), about &#x27;50s porn-king, Paul Raymond. 
Partridge returned in 2010 with a series of shorts, &quot;Mid Morning Matters with Alan Partridge&quot;, written with new writers Rob and Neil Gibbons. It was followed by the spoof memoirs &quot;I, Partridge: We Need to Talk About Alan&quot; (2011) and &quot;Nomad&quot; (2016), the feature film &quot;Alan Partridge: Alpha Papa&quot; (2013), and several TV specials. In his autobiography, Coogan wrote that &quot;Alpha Papa&quot; was the hardest he had ever worked and that the production was fraught; however, he was proud of the finished film.

Coogan produced, co-wrote and co-starred in the drama film &quot;Philomena&quot; (2013). He portrayed the journalist Martin Sixsmith, who helps a former resident of an Irish Roman Catholic mother and baby home, Philomena Lee, played by Judi Dench, find her son after decades long absence. The film received acclaim and was a financial success. The &quot;Variety&quot; critic Justin Chang wrote, &quot;The two leads make decent sparring partners and better allies, and Coogan is especially good whenever Martin&#x27;s impatient manner tilts into genuine moral indignation.&quot; Coogan received the BAFTA Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and the Venice Film Festival Award for Best Screenplay as well as nominations for the Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay and the Golden Globe Award for Best Screenplay. The film earned four Academy Award nominations including for Best Picture losing to Steve McQueen&#x27;s historical drama &quot;12 Years a Slave&quot; (2013). Coogan&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Easily Distracted&quot;, was published in October 2015.

In 2016, after Henry Normal stood down, Christine Langan (head of BBC Film at the time) was hired by Coogan (creative director of Baby Cow Productions) as the new CEO; this led to BBC Worldwide increasing its stake to 73%. Since joining, Langan has executive-produced all of the content from Baby Cow Productions, including &quot;Camping&quot;, &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot;, &quot;Zapped&quot; and &quot;The Witchfinder&quot;. 
Coogan played the comedian Stan Laurel in the 2018 biographical film &quot;Stan &amp; Ollie&quot;, alongside the American actor John C. Reilly, who played Oliver Hardy. Todd McCarthy of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that Coogan &quot;slips neatly into the role&quot; and added, &quot;Coogan and Reilly not only excel at creating convincing impressions of one of the most famous comic teams of the last century, but they do an uncanny job of recreating a handful of their famous routines, which today mostly play as mild yet expertly timed delights.&quot; For his performance, he earned a nomination for the BAFTA Award for Best Actor in a Leading Role. In 2019, Partridge returned to the BBC with &quot;This Time with Alan Partridge&quot;, a spoof of magazine shows such as &quot;The One Show,&quot; followed by an Audible podcast, &quot;From the Oasthouse&quot;, in 2020. The podcast has now run for three seasons, including a free teaser episode where Partridge commented on the coronation of Charles III and Camilla.

=== 2020–present ===
In April 2022, Coogan began an Alan Partridge tour, &quot;Stratagem&quot;. Reviewing the show for the &quot;Guardian&quot;, Brian Logan noted that though Coogan had once tired of Partridge, he now &quot;clearly takes pleasure in the performance&quot;. Coogan starred in the 2022 film &quot;The Lost King&quot;, playing the husband of the writer Philippa Langley, who discovered the bones of King Richard III.

Coogan played Jimmy Savile in the BBC One series &quot;The Reckoning&quot; (2023). Coogan said the decision to play Savile was &quot;not one I took lightly&quot;, and that the script &quot;tackled a horrific story which – however harrowing – needs to be told&quot;. Despite the controversy surrounding the series, Coogan&#x27;s performance was mostly praised by critics, and he was nominated for the British Academy Television Award for Best Actor. Coogan appeared in the 2024 film &quot;&quot; as Paddy Meyers, a TV personality who interviews the Joker.

Filming for the next Partridge project, &quot;Alan Partridge: How Are You?&quot;, began in early 2024. Coogan stars in multiple roles in a London stage version of the 1964 film &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;, adapted by Iannucci. The play opened at the Noël Coward Theatre on 8 October 2024.

==In the media==
===Public image===
Coogan has said that he likes to &quot;keep [himself] private&quot;, and added: &quot;I have never wanted to be famous, as such – fame is a by-product.&quot; He has been a British tabloid fixture since as early as 1996, and has stated that such outlets have subjected him to entrapment and blackmail, printed obvious lies about him, and have targeted his family and friends in attempts to extract stories from them. Coogan in some cases strongly denied allegations, but in others did not contest them because he wanted to shield vulnerable friends from adverse publicity. 

The tabloids also published intrusive information about his relationships and the schooling of his child. Coogan has also been critical of the broadsheet press, saying they have colluded with the tabloids in the interests of selling newspapers. In 2005, he said &quot;&quot;The Guardian&quot; tends to have its cake and eat it. It waits for the tabloids to dish the dirt and then it talks about the tabloids dishing the dirt while enjoying it themselves.&quot; He later gave credit to the same newspaper for its investigation of the phone hacking scandal. He has said that the press, by persistently intruding in his private life, has effectively made him &quot;immune&quot; to further attack as his &quot;closet is empty of skeletons&quot;.

===Phone hacking scandal===

Coogan favours reform and regulation of the British press. He became a prominent figure in the News International phone hacking scandal as one of the celebrities who took action against the British tabloids in light of these events. He was made aware by his phone service provider of &quot;possible anomalies&quot; on his phone in 2005 and 2006. In 2010, Coogan&#x27;s legal firm obtained a partially redacted version of Glenn Mulcaire&#x27;s hacking notebook by a court order which showed Coogan had been targeted and his personal information was in the possession of Mulcaire.

Mulcaire was forced by the High Court of Justice to disclose to Coogan&#x27;s legal team who amongst the staff at the &quot;News of the World&quot; ordered him to hack phones. This information was obtained by Coogan&#x27;s lawyers on 26 August 2011. Interviewed on &quot;Newsnight&quot; on 8 July 2011, Coogan said he was &quot;delighted&quot; by the closure of the &quot;News of the World&quot; and said it was a &quot;fantastic day for journalism&quot;. He said the idea of press freedom was used by the tabloids as a &quot;smokescreen for selling papers with tittle-tattle&quot; and said the argument against press regulation was &quot;morally bankrupt&quot;.

Coogan provided an eight-page witness statement to the Leveson Inquiry, and appeared at the inquiry on 22 November 2011 to discuss the evidence. He said he was there reluctantly representing a lot of celebrities who felt they could not speak out for fear of reprisals from the tabloid press.

In March 2021, Coogan said &quot;the tabloid press is controlled by a handful of tax shy billionaires with an agenda. Anyone who stands up to the press is attacked by them because they&#x27;re bullies.&quot; He added &quot;the fact that Meghan Markle and Harry were attacked has nothing to do with jet-setting hypocrisy. It&#x27;s because they broke the golden rule, which is to leave us alone and we&#x27;ll go easy on you next time.&quot;

==Personal life==
In 1993, Coogan was living in Didsbury. He later lived in the manor house Ovingdean Grange in Ovingdean, East Sussex, until 2017, when it was advertised for sale at £3.25 million. As of 2022, Coogan has lived in Barcombe, in the Lewes District of East Sussex.

Coogan married Caroline Hickman in 2002 and they divorced in 2005. He dated the model China Chow for three years. In March 2011, he was guest editor for the men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Loaded&quot;, where he began dating the glamour model Loretta &quot;Elle&quot; Basey. They split in 2014. He has a daughter from a four-year relationship with the solicitor Anna Cole.

Although raised Catholic, Coogan is now an atheist. A motoring enthusiast, he has owned a number of Ferraris, but ceased after calculating that the costs exceeded those of running a private plane. In February 2016, he was fined £670 and banned from driving for 28 days after being caught speeding in Brighton. In August 2019, he escaped the usual six-month ban for a further speeding offence as his next TV series depended on his ability to drive; he was given a two-month ban and a £750 fine. He was again spared six penalty points and a six-month ban for speeding in February 2025, reduced to five points and two months as a longer ban would have prevented filming of a new series of &quot;The Trip&quot;, which would have affected the many people involved.

He has been open about his depression and past drug use. He described himself as &quot;half-Irish&quot; in an interview in 2020, and was granted an Irish passport in March 2023.

==Political views==
Coogan has supported Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the Green Party. He believes that the Conservative Party think &quot;people are plebs&quot; and that &quot;they like to pat people on the head&quot;. In 2013, he voiced his support for abolishing the British monarchy. In August 2014, Coogan was one of 200 public figures to sign a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; expressing their hope that Scotland would vote to remain part of the United Kingdom in the Scottish independence referendum.

Coogan endorsed the Labour Party leader Jeremy Corbyn in the 2017 general election. He hosted a rally for Corbyn in Birmingham, saying: &quot;The Tory tactic was to try to make this a choice between Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn, but this has backfired as people – and I readily admit to being one of them – have started to listen to what Jeremy Corbyn says rather than what other people have been saying about him.&quot; In November 2019, along with other public figures, Coogan signed a letter defending Corbyn, describing him as &quot;a beacon of hope in the struggle against emergent far-right nationalism, xenophobia and racism in much of the democratic world&quot; and endorsed him in the 2019 general election. In December 2019, along with 42 other cultural figures, Coogan signed a letter endorsing the Labour Party in the election. The letter stated that &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritises the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few&quot;.

In September 2023, Coogan addressed the Liberal Democrat Conference by video link, expressing that he would tactically vote for the Liberal Democrats over the Labour Party in the 2024 general election, as &quot;the candidate best placed to kick the Tories out is the Lib Dem candidate&quot;. In October, Coogan was among more than 2,000 cultural figures to sign a letter calling for a Gaza ceasefire and accused the UK government of &quot;not only tolerating war crimes but aiding and abetting them&quot; in the wake of the 2023 Israel-Hamas war. Following criticism that the letter did not acknowledge the 7 October attack by Hamas on Israel, Coogan said that &quot;it goes without saying that what Hamas did is evil beyond imagination — it was horrific and brutal&quot;. In June 2024, Coogan was one of more than 100 cultural figures to sign a letter calling for Labour to halt sales of arms to Israel if it is elected. That month, ahead of the general election, he endorsed the Green Party and campaigned for Siân Berry.

<text>Robert Haldane (28 February 1764 – 12 December 1842) was a religious writer and Scottish theologian. Author of &quot;Commentaire sur l&#x27;Épître aux Romains, On the Inspiration of Scripture&quot; and &quot;Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans.&quot;

==Early life ==

Robert Haldane 3rd of Airthrey was the son of James Haldane 2nd of Airthrey, and his wife, Katherine Duncan. Robert was born on 28 February 1764 in Queen Anne Street, Cavendish Square in London. Robert and his younger brother James Alexander Haldane were raised by their grandmother Lady Lundie and uncles. Robert and James attended classes at Dundee Grammar School, the Royal High School in Edinburgh, and the University of Edinburgh.

In 1780 Robert joined HMS &quot;Monarch&quot; as an officer, of which his maternal uncle, Adam Duncan, was in command. In 1781, he was transferred to HMS &quot;Foudroyant&quot;. He was on HMS &quot;Foudroyant&quot; under John Jervis during the night engagement in April 1782 with the French ship &quot;Pegase&quot; and greatly distinguished himself. Haldane was afterwards present at the relief of Gibraltar in September 1782. Some months later after the peace treaty of 1783, he left the Royal Navy.

== Airthrey Estate ==
Soon after leaving the Navy, he settled on his family estate Airthrey, near Stirling where he contacted the Whites of Durham to landscape the grounds. These estate improvements included the creation of a man-made loch, rolling lawns, several wooded plantations, a hermitage and a boundary wall which is nearly four miles in length. In 1790 he commissioned the neoclassical architect Robert Adam to make a draft for the building of Airthrey Castle of which Adam created two designs. Haldane picked his favourite design but chose to have Thomas Russell complete the works instead of Robert Adam. Airthrey Castle was completed in 1791 and as built corresponded largely to the final design by Robert Adam without the forecourt which was never built. Although there were changes to the north facade in the late nineteenth century, the south facade is still essentially as designed by Adam.

==Evangelism==
Robert&#x27;s tutor was David Bogue of Gosport. After reading about the start of the French Revolution he grew to disapprove strongly of the war with France. Robert resolved to devote himself to advancing Christianity. In 1795 Robert converted to the evangelical church shortly after his brother James converted. Robert became one of the first members of the London Missionary Society in 1795, the same year that he was converted. He offered the British Government and the East India Company to sell Airthrey Estate in order to set up a vast mission in Bengal but was turned down by the East India Company, and the mission was abandoned.

In December 1797 he also joined his brother and some others in the formation of the &quot;Society for the Propagation of the Gospel at Home,&quot; in building chapels or &quot;tabernacles&quot; for congregations, in supporting missionaries, and in maintaining institutions for the education of young men to carry on the work of evangelization. In 1798 he sold the Airthrey Estate to Robert Abercromby to obtain funding for his mission work and with the funds raised to set up the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home in Edinburgh. In 1799 Robert organised for Plean Estate to be sold and this was bought in 1800 by Francis Simpson.

Over the next twelve years (1798–1810) he gave over £70,000; this was used to further the cause of the Society for Propagating the Gospel at Home by building chapels for congregations, supporting missionaries and helping to maintain institutions for young men to be educated to carry on the work of evangelization. Robert was inspired by George Whitefield&#x27;s two tabernacles in London and built preaching centres strategically placed throughout Scotland. These tabernacles were located in Glasgow, Dundee, Perth, Thurso, Wick, Edinburgh and Elgin. His brother James took over the Edinburgh tabernacle until 1851.

Robert funded John Campbell&#x27;s Society for the Education of Africans which initially planned to evangelise in Africa by bringing over native children to be trained as Christian missionaries in Edinburgh. However, owing to an outbreak of smallpox, the group of children remained in the London area at what became known as the African Academy in Clapham.

From 1799 to 1807, Robert set up theological seminars in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Dundee to train young men with a passion for the gospel. Young men would come and train for 2–3 years with all their expenses paid for. Over this time 300 men were trained and sent out to spread their teachings all over the world.

In 1816 Robert published a work on the &quot;Evidences and Authority of Divine Revelation&quot;. In the summer of 1816 Robert Haldane visited Europe, first at Geneva and afterwards in Montauban. He lectured and interviewed large numbers of theological students with remarkable effect; among them were César Malan, Frédéric Monod and Jean-Henri Merle d&#x27;Aubigné. This circle of men spread the revival of evangelical Protestant Christianity across the continent of Europe (&quot;Le Réveil&quot;), impacting France, Germany (Die Erweckung) and the Netherlands (Het Reveil). Through conversion and missionary impetus the effects of this revival were felt as far afield as Italy and Hungary.

== Later life ==
In 1819, Robert had his theological prelections published in a &quot;Commentaire sur l&#x27;Épître aux Romains&quot;. He returned to Scotland in 1819 to live partly at the estate he had bought in 1809, Auchengray and partly in Edinburgh at 10 Duke Street
 (later renamed Dublin Street). Like his brother James, he took part in many of the religious controversies of the time, mainly through correspondence in the newspapers.

Robert&#x27;s later writing included a number of pamphlets on the Apocrypha controversy, as well as a treatise &quot;On the Inspiration&quot; &quot;of Scripture&quot; which was published in 1828 and a later &quot;Exposition of the Epistle to the Romans&quot; published in 1835, which has been translated into French and German.

Robert died on 12 December in 1842 in Edinburgh and was buried in Glasgow Cathedral.

==Family==
Robert Haldane married Catherine Cochrane Oswald, daughter of George Oswald of Scotstoun, on 24 April 1785. They were married for 58 years and had one child, Margaret Haldane, during their marriage. Margaret married James Farquhar Gordon in 1805.

Robert died on , Catherine six months afterward. Margaret died on 29 September 1849.
==Church and ministry==
Along with his brother, James Haldane, Robert Haldane established 85 churches in Scotland and Ireland. Churches planted by the Haldanes practiced baptism by immersion, weekly communion, and congregational polity (autonomous government). The Haldanes also operated a seminary, and were influenced in their principles by other independent thinkers such as John Glas and Robert Sandeman.

<doc id="266405" wikidata="Q7750507" url="?curid=266405" title="The Mary Whitehouse Experience">
<text>The Mary Whitehouse Experience is a British topical sketch comedy show that the BBC produced in association with Spitting Image Productions. It starred two comedy double acts, one being David Baddiel and Rob Newman, the other Steve Punt and Hugh Dennis. All four comedians had graduated from Cambridge University. It was broadcast on both radio and television in the late 1980s and early 1990s.

The show was named after Mary Whitehouse, a campaigner against what she saw as a decline in television standards and public morality. She became the target of mockery in the UK for her attitudes. The BBC feared Whitehouse would initiate litigation for the use of her name in the show&#x27;s title, and for a period the alternative title &quot;The William Rees-Mogg Experience&quot; was considered.

==BBC Radio One show==

A radio pilot was broadcast on 10 March 1989 on BBC Radio 1 and a series of 13 shows began on 7 April the same year. Bill Dare devised the format. The two pairings of Newman and Baddiel and Punt and Dennis were central to the show, with support from Nick Hancock, Jo Brand, Jack Dee, Mark Thomas and Mark Hurst. The show also included musical interludes from Skint Video and The Tracy Brothers.

It was originally aired at midnight on Friday. It was subsequently moved to a 10:30pm slot, before being moved again for its fourth and final series to 7pm on Saturday evenings. The show ran for four series and a special (44 episodes in total) from March 1989 to December 1990.

==Television==

A television pilot aired on BBC2 shortly before the fourth and final radio series, on 3 October 1990. The first series started on 3 January 1991 and ran for six episodes, with a second set of six episodes in 1992.

The television series was a mix of observational comedy sketches and monologues, in a format similar to shows such as &quot;Mr. Show&quot; and &quot;The Kids in the Hall&quot;. The show featured a lot of satirical takes on famous people, films and TV shows of the day along with original character material.

Each show was made up of sections usually headed by a caption relating to the topic about to be discussed. The caption took the form of &#x27;The [topic] Experience&#x27;. One of the performers would begin talking about the topic in monologue form, sometimes with input from another performer who appeared in character. The monologue would make reference to a humorous scenario which would be played out in sketch form, returning either to the same topic or moving on to a different or loosely related one. Lines or characters from sketches might recur throughout the show either as a continuation of the original sketch or an invasion of another one.

The pace of the show was fairly rapid, helped by the inclusion of a boom camera in the studio which panned quickly around the audience and back to the stage at the beginning of each monologue. Each section was punctuated with a small excerpt of the theme music, &quot;Jack to the Sound of the Underground.&quot;

A companion book to the series was released in 1991, titled &quot;The Mary Whitehouse Experience Encyclopedia&quot;, which contains references to some of the sketches featured on the show and much new additional material.

==Recurring characters==

===Ray===
(played by Rob Newman)

A man afflicted with a disease that gives him a permanently sarcastic tone of voice, so that everything he says comes out sounding sarcastic, no matter how sincerely he means it. This sketch is presented as a medical case history told by Ray&#x27;s psychiatrist (played by David Baddiel), who gives accounts of various situations in which Ray&#x27;s affliction has got him into trouble. These are usually sensitive situations such as speaking out at a funeral, apologising to an old man after running over his wife in his car, and complimenting a suicidal child on his drawings. At other times Ray has experienced near-fatal accidents, such as having an arrow shot through his brain, which are ignored by passers-by given that even his cries of pain sound sarcastic. Ray&#x27;s disorder also affects his body language, as demonstrated in one sketch in which he converses with his deaf foster mother. Ray&#x27;s psychiatrist discovers that the only things Ray&#x27;s voice can say normally are those that he means sarcastically. In one sketch he makes friends with some media types, who appreciate his seemingly endless sarcasm when talking about the film &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;. In the final episode, on being given a Cure album as a present, Ray cannot bring himself to sound sarcastic when thanking his friend and, bizarrely, starts speaking Flemish. Ray has quite a successful run of appearances on Flemish chat-shows, before the inevitable happens, and he begins speaking Flemish in a sarcastic tone. Ray often uses the phrase &quot;Oh no, what a personal disaster&quot; which became one of the show&#x27;s most popular catchphrases.

===Ivan===
(played by Rob Newman)

Ivan is a daytime television presenter who hosts a show similar to the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Pebble Mill at One&quot;. He appears at first glance to be like any normal daytime TV presenter; however, his appearance becomes increasingly unusual as the sketches progress (his hair ends up extremely ruffled and he has plasters on his face). Ivan is very overemotional and will fly into a tormented rage at the slightest mention of anything vaguely bad. One such example is when a professional gardener he is interviewing tells him in passing that someone has trodden on and broken a garden cane he was going to use, and Ivan proceeds to fly into a hysterical rage and smash apart the whole greenhouse. Likewise, when informed that the situation is not so bad after all, Ivan will similarly react in an overly ecstatic manner, much to the annoyance of his guests.

===Mr. Strange===
(played by Hugh Dennis, better known as the &#x27;Milky Milky&#x27; sketch)

Mr. Strange is the archetypal &#x27;man your mother warned you about&#x27;, the weird man who walks around town in a dirty old mac, indulging in disturbingly eccentric behaviour. Mr. Strange&#x27;s main trait is that he has an absurd addiction to off milk that is, and is always carrying cartons or bottles of milk with him, not only drinking from them but obsessively sniffing them before uttering the words &quot;Lovely—Milky Milky&quot; (which became another one of the show&#x27;s most popular catchphrases). This led to a 1992 novelty tie-in single &quot;Milky Milky (Take Me to the Fridge)&quot; by Mr Strange and the Lactose Brotherhood, as well as Punt and Dennis&#x27; tour of the same year being named &quot;The Milky Milky Tour&quot;.

One sketch features Mr. Strange as a contestant on &quot;Mastermind&quot; whose specialist subject is &#x27;Milk and the way it smells&#x27; while another features him presenting a Party political broadcast offering himself as an alternative to the main political leaders because &quot;I don&#x27;t wash my pants—it&#x27;s not nature&#x27;s way&quot;.

===History Today===
History Today made its debut in the second half of the show&#x27;s second TV series. History Today is a supposed historical discussion TV programme presented by two elderly, scholarly professors, both well-spoken and well-groomed. The first of these professors, who introduces each &#x27;episode&#x27; and its topic of discussion, is played by David Baddiel although the character is never named. The second is Professor F. J. Lewis, Emeritus Professor of History at All Souls College, Oxford, who is played by Rob Newman. Each &#x27;episode&#x27; begins as a standard historical debate, but quickly degenerates into a playground-style quarrel with the professors exchanging childish insults. The humour lies largely in the juxtaposition of the professors&#x27; formal tone of voice with their puerile words. This sketch spawned perhaps the show&#x27;s most popular catchphrase &quot;...That&#x27;s you, that is&quot;, spoken after they had described someone/something supposedly pathetic and/or disgusting. This sketch was later carried over into Newman and Baddiel&#x27;s own show, &quot;Newman and Baddiel in Pieces&quot;.

==Parodies==
Robert Smith (played by Rob Newman)

A parody of the singer Robert Smith, front-man with the British rock band The Cure. This was prompted by Baddiel&#x27;s observation that, although the band&#x27;s earlier material had been recorded in a downbeat, &#x27;doom and gloom&#x27; Gothic rock style, they had later moved in a more poppy direction (with singles such as &quot;Friday I&#x27;m in Love&quot;). Each sketch features Robert Smith and The Cure performing a particularly happy, cheery song or nursery rhyme in the band&#x27;s goth style. The songs included &quot;Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport&quot; (originally by Rolf Harris), &quot;The Laughing Policeman&quot; and Tommy Steele&#x27;s &quot;Flash Bang Wallop&quot;. Robert Smith himself also made a guest appearance on the final episode of the show, in the last of the &#x27;Ray&#x27; sketches, in which he was seen to sing &quot;The Sun Has Got His Hat On&quot;.

Edward Colanderhands (played by Rob Newman)

A parody of the Tim Burton film &quot;Edward Scissorhands&quot;, which featured a similar character but with colanders for hands instead of scissors. He was seen in a sketch helping a housewife to drain vegetables. He was also present in the Robert Smith sketch as an audience member clapping to the beat of the songs, instead of clapping his hands he clapped his colanders together and unlike the rest of the audience he showed immense enjoyment of the performance. He later returned as &quot;Edward &#x27;Good Movie Guide&#x27; Knob&quot;.

Mark and Tim

A parody of Mark Gardener and Tim Burgess. Rob Newman admits to growing his hair to look like Mark Gardener and Tim Burgess (members of, respectively, the bands Ride and the Charlatans), and while praising their musical accomplishments, he demonstrates why you wouldn&#x27;t want to &#x27;hang out with them&#x27; in several scenarios. These include playing football, helping to check if Rob&#x27;s car brake lights are working and as backup while Rob is being held at knifepoint. In each scenario, Tim and Mark both remain silent and motionless apart from moving their heads slowly from side to side.

==Repeats==
The majority of the first three radio series were repeated on BBC 7 in 2003. However, rights issues precluded further transmissions, although there have been very occasional one-off airings in the Saturday morning &quot;Comedy Controller&quot; slot. A run of selected episodes started on Friday nights in September 2013.

Although there were edited compilation repeats of the television series on the BBC within a year of the original broadcasts, it has never been released on home video.

<text>David Bogue (18 February 175025 October 1825) was a Scottish nonconformist religious leader.

==Life==
He was born at Hallydown Farm, in the parish of Coldingham, Berwickshire, Scotland, the son of John Bogue, farmer, and his wife, Margaret Swanston. He received his early education in Eyemouth.

After studying Divinity at Edinburgh University, he was licensed to preach by the Church of Scotland, but, failing to find a patron in Scotland, was sent by the Church to London in 1771, to teach in schools at Edmonton, Hampstead and then Mansion House Cottage in Camberwell. In 1777, he settled as minister of the independent Congregational church at Gosport in Hampshire. His predecessors at the Independent Chapel of Gosport were James Watson (1770–76) and Thomas Williams (1750–70).

In 1771 he established an institution for preparing men for the ministry. It was the age of the new-born missionary enterprise, and Bogue&#x27;s academy was largely the seed from which the London Missionary Society grew. In 1800 the society placed missionaries with Bogue for preparation for their ministries. 
Among the notable students he taught, the most impactful were the first two Protestant missionaries to China, Robert Morrison (missionary) (from 1804 to 1805), and William Milne (missionary) (from 1809 to 1812).
Bogue himself would have gone to India in 1796 if not for the opposition of the East India Company. In 1824 he taught Samuel Dyer at Gosport before he left for Penang as a missionary with the London Missionary Society.

He was also involved in founding the British and Foreign Bible Society and the Religious Tract Society, and in conjunction with James Bennett, minister at Romsey, wrote a well-known &quot;History of Dissenters&quot; (3 vols., 1809). Another of his writings was an &quot;Essay on the Divine Authority of the New Testament&quot;. 

In 1815 Yale University awarded him a doctor of divinity (DD).

He died on 25 October 1825 in Brighton during the London Missionary Society&#x27;s annual tour.

<doc id="266410" wikidata="Q211674" url="?curid=266410" title="Sykes–Picot Agreement">
<text>The Sykes–Picot Agreement () was a 1916 secret treaty between the United Kingdom and France, with assent from Russia and Italy, to define their mutually agreed spheres of influence and control in an eventual partition of the Ottoman Empire.

The agreement was based on the premise that the Triple Entente would achieve success in defeating the Ottoman Empire during World War I and formed part of a series of secret agreements contemplating its partition. The primary negotiations leading to the agreement took place between 23 November 1915 and 3 January 1916, on which date the British and French diplomats, Mark Sykes and François Georges-Picot, initialled an agreed memorandum. The agreement was ratified by their respective governments on 9 and 16 May 1916.

The agreement effectively divided the Ottoman provinces outside the Arabian Peninsula into areas of British and French control and influence. The British- and French-controlled countries were divided by the Sykes–Picot line. The agreement allocated to the UK control of what is today southern Israel and Palestine, Jordan and southern Iraq, and an additional small area that included the ports of Haifa and Acre to allow access to the Mediterranean. France was to control southeastern Turkey, the Kurdistan Region, Syria and Lebanon.

As a result of the included Sazonov–Paléologue Agreement, Russia was to get Western Armenia in addition to Constantinople and the Turkish Straits already promised under the 1915 Constantinople Agreement. Italy assented to the agreement in 1917 via the Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne and received southern Anatolia. The Palestine region, with a smaller area than the later Mandatory Palestine, was to fall under an &quot;international administration&quot;.

The agreement was initially used directly as the basis for the 1918 Anglo–French Modus Vivendi, which provided a framework for the Occupied Enemy Territory Administration in the Levant. More broadly it was to lead, indirectly, to the subsequent partitioning of the Ottoman Empire following Ottoman defeat in 1918. Shortly after the war, the French ceded Palestine and Mosul to the British. Mandates in the Levant and Mesopotamia were assigned at the April 1920 San Remo conference following the Sykes–Picot framework; the British Mandate for Palestine ran until 1948, the British Mandate for Mesopotamia was to be replaced by a similar treaty with Mandatory Iraq, and the French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon lasted until 1946. The Anatolian parts of the agreement were assigned by the August 1920 Treaty of Sèvres; however, these ambitions were thwarted by the 1919–23 Turkish War of Independence and the subsequent Treaty of Lausanne.

The agreement is seen by many as a turning point in Western and Arab relations. Arabs saw it as the failure to keep a British promise in the McMahon–Hussein correspondence with Hussein bin Ali of the Kingdom of Hejaz. regarding a national Arab homeland in exchange for supporting the British against the Ottoman Empire. The British later claimed that Palestine was meant to be excluded from the area of Arab rule, as it is technically located west of Damascus: for obvious reasons the Zionists took the same position. The Arabs interpreted the letter as it reads: Lebanon, not Palestine, is to the west of Damascus and the other areas mentioned. The agreement, along with others, was made public by the Bolsheviks in Moscow on 23 November 1917 and repeated in &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; on 26 November 1917, such that &quot;the British were embarrassed, the Arabs dismayed and the Turks delighted&quot;. The agreement&#x27;s legacy has led to much resentment in the region, among Arabs in particular but also among Kurds who were denied an independent state.

==Motivation and negotiations==
===Earlier agreements with Russia and Italy (March–April 1915)===

In the Constantinople Agreement of 18 March 1915, following the start of naval operations in the run up to the Gallipoli campaign the Russian Foreign Minister, Sergey Sazonov, wrote to the French and UK ambassadors and staked a claim to Constantinople and the Dardanelles. In a series of diplomatic exchanges over five weeks, the UK and France both agreed, while putting forward their own claims, to an increased sphere of influence in Iran in the case of the UK and to an annexation of Syria (including Palestine) and Cilicia for France. The UK and French claims were both agreed, all sides also agreeing that the exact governance of the Holy Places was to be left for later settlement. Were it not for the Russian Revolutions of 1917, Constantinople and the Straits could have been given to Russia upon the Allied victory. This agreement and the Sykes–Picot Agreement were complementary, as France and Britain first had to satisfy Russia in order to finalize the partitioning of the Middle East.

In the Treaty of London of 26 April 1915, Article 9 included commitments regarding Italian participation in any partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. The article stated: &quot;If France, Great Britain and Russia occupy any territories in Turkey in Asia during the course of the war, the Mediterranean region bordering on the Province of Adalia within the limits indicated above shall be reserved to Italy, who shall be entitled to occupy it.&quot;

===Earlier agreement with the Arabs (July 1915 – March 1916)===

While Sykes and Picot were in negotiations, discussions were proceeding in parallel between Hussein bin Ali, Sharif of Mecca, and Lieutenant Colonel Sir Henry McMahon, British High Commissioner to Egypt (the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence). Their correspondence comprised ten letters exchanged from July 1915 to March 1916, in which the British government agreed to recognize Arab independence after the war in exchange for the Sharif of Mecca launching the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire.

The area of Arab independence was defined to be &quot;bounded on the North by Mersina and Adana up to 37 degrees of latitude, on which degree fall Birijik, Urfa, Mardin, Midiat, Jerizat (Ibn ʿUma), Amadia, up to the border of Persia; on the east by the borders of Persia up to the Gulf of Basra; on the South by the Indian Ocean, with the exception of the position of Aden to remain as it is; on the west by the Red Sea, the Mediterranean Sea up to Mersina&quot;, with the exception of &quot;portions of Syria&quot; lying to the west of &quot;the districts of Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo&quot;.

Hussein&#x27;s reply of 1 January to McMahon&#x27;s 14 December 1915 was received at the Foreign Office, McMahon&#x27;s cover stating:

Satisfactory as it may be to note his general acceptance for the time being of the proposed relations of France with Arabia, his reference to the future of those relations adumbrates a source of trouble which it will be wise not to ignore. I have on more than one occasion brought to the notice of His Majesty&#x27;s Government the deep antipathy with which the Arabs regard the prospect of French Administration of any portion of Arab territory. In this lies considerable danger to our future relations with France, because difficult and even impossible though it may be to convince France of her mistake, if we do not endeavour to do so by warning her of the real state of Arab feeling, we may hereafter be accused of instigating or encouraging the opposition to the French, which the Arabs now threaten and will assuredly give.

After discussions, Grey instructed that the French be informed of the situation, although Paul Cambon did not take the agreement that seriously.

===Anglo-French negotiations (October 1915 – March 1916)===
On 21 October 1915, Grey met Cambon and suggested France appoint a representative to discuss the future borders of Syria as Britain wished to back the creation of an independent Arab state. At this point Grey was faced with competing claims from the French and from Hussein and the day before had sent a telegram to Cairo telling the High Commissioner to be as vague as possible in his next letter to the Sharif when discussing the northwestern, Syrian, corner of the territory Hussein claimed and left McMahon with &quot;discretion in the matter as it is urgent and there is not time to discuss an exact formula&quot;, adding, &quot;If something more precise than this is required you can give it.&quot;

The first meeting of the British interdepartmental committee headed by Sir Arthur Nicolson with François Georges-Picot took place on 23 November 1915. Picot informed the Nicolson committee that France claimed the possession of land starting from where the Taurus Mountains approach the sea in Cilicia, following the Taurus Mountains and the mountains further East, so as to include Diyarbekir, Mosul and Erbil, and then returning to Deir ez-Zor on the Euphrates and from there southwards along the desert border, finishing eventually at the Egyptian frontier. Picot, however, added that he was prepared &quot;to propose to the French government to throw Mosul into the Arab pool, if we did so in the case of Baghdad&quot;.

A second meeting of the Nicolson committee with Picot took place on 21 December 1915 wherein Picot said that he had obtained permission to agree to the towns of Aleppo, Hama, Homs and Damascus being included in the Arab dominions to be administered by the Arabs. Although the French had scaled back their demands to some extent, the British also claimed to want to include Lebanon in the future Arab State and this meeting also ended at an impasse.

On Tuesday 28 December, Mark Sykes informed Gilbert Clayton that he had &quot;been given the Picot negotiations&quot;. Sykes and Picot entered into &quot;almost daily&quot; private discussions over the six-day period; no documents survive from these discussions.

On Monday 3 January 1916, they agreed and initialled a joint memorandum containing what was to become known as the Sykes–Picot Agreement. They had agreed to compromise on the two primary areas of difference—they split the Mosul Vilayet in two at the Little Zab river, with the French taking the northern part (Mosul and Erbil) and the British taking the southern part (Kirkuk and Sulaymaniyah), and Palestine was to be placed under an &quot;international administration, the form of which is to be decided upon after consultation with Russia, and subsequently in consultation with the other allies, and the representatives of the sheriff of Mecca.&quot;

The memorandum was forwarded to the Foreign Office and circulated for comments. On 16 January, Sykes told the Foreign office that he had spoken to Picot and that he thought Paris would be able to agree. An interdepartmental conference was convened by Nicolson on 21 January. Following the meeting, a final draft agreement was circulated to the cabinet on 2 February, the War Committee considered it on the 3rd and finally at a meeting on the 4th between Bonar Law, Chamberlain, Lord Kitchener and others it was decided that:

M. Picot may inform his government that the acceptance of the whole project would entail the abdication of considerable British interests, but provided that the cooperation of the Arabs is secured, and that the Arabs fulfil the conditions and obtain the towns of Homs, Hama, Damascus and Aleppo, the British Government would not object to the arrangement. But, as the Blue Area extends so far Eastwards, and affects Russian interests, it would be absolutely essential that, before anything was concluded, the consent of Russia was obtained.

Picot was informed and five days later Cambon told Nicolson that &quot;the French government were in accord with the proposals concerning the Arab question&quot;.

Later, in February and March, Sykes and Picot acted as advisors to Sir George Buchanan and the French ambassador respectively, during negotiations with Sazonov.

===Formal British, French and Russian agreements (April–October 1916)===
Eventually, Russia having agreed on 26 April 1916, the final terms were sent by Paul Cambon, the French Ambassador in London, to the Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Edward Grey, on 9 May 1916, and ratified in Grey&#x27;s reply on 16 May 1916.

The formal agreements between Britain, France and Russia comprised the eleven letters below.
In the chain of agreements between France, Russia and Britain, the Russian claims were assented to first: France confirmed their agreement on 26 April and Britain on 23 May, with formal sanction on 23 October. The Anglo-French agreement was confirmed in an exchange of letters on 9 May and 16 May.

===Agreement with Italy (April–August 1917)===

In a meeting in a railway car at Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne on 19 April 1917, a tentative agreement was reached between British and French Prime Ministers, David Lloyd George and Alexandre Ribot, and the Italian Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, Paolo Boselli and Sidney Sonnino; to settle the Italian interest in the Ottoman Empire—specifically article 9 of the Treaty of London. The agreement was needed by the Allies to secure the position of Italian forces in West Asia.

The goal was to balance the military power drops at the Middle Eastern theatre of World War I as Russian (Tsarist) forces were pulling out of the Caucasus campaign, even though they were replaced with the forces of what would be called the First Republic of Armenia. It was clear to the Italians that the area allotted to them may not be easily given up by the Turkish Empire, such that the British Prime Minister proposed a vague formula for post-war adjustment should the actual post-war allocation not appear to be balanced.

The agreement was drafted and negotiated by the countries&#x27; diplomats over the coming months, and signed by the allies between 18 August and 26 September 1917. Russia was not represented in this agreement as the Tsarist regime was in the midst of a revolution. The lack of Russian consent to the Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne agreement was subsequently used by the British at the 1919 Paris Peace Conference to invalidate it, a position that greatly incensed the Italian government.

===The brown zone and the imperial interest===
Vereté describes how a dispute with the Ottoman Empire over the Eastern boundary of Egypt ended in 1906 when the borders were redrawn along the Rafa-Aqaba line and subsequently the fear of an attack on Egypt led to an increased strategic importance of &quot;The hinterland of Sinai, western and eastern Palestine at least up to the Acre-Dar&#x27;a line&quot;.

Palestine was discussed between various members of the British Civil Service. Lord Kitchener, the recently appointed Secretary of State for War had been recalled from his position as Consul-General in Egypt; his secretary Oswald FitzGerald discussed the matter with Ronald Storrs, the Oriental Secretary in Cairo, who wrote on 28 December 1914: &quot;the inclusion of a part of Palestine in the Egyptian Protectorate [with Jerusalem as a free city could be] a possible solution... [This would make] Jewish infiltration into Palestine... less obvious and annoying to the susceptibilities of the Moslem and even certain elements in the Christian world&quot;

After the Constantinople agreement, the French approached the British with a view to working out their mutual desiderata and the British, on 8 April 1915, set up the De Bunsen Committee to consider British options. Zionism was not considered by the report of the committee, submitted in June 1915, which concluded that, in case of the partition or zones of influence options, there should be a British sphere of influence that included Palestine while accepting that there were relevant French and Russian as well as Islamic interests in Jerusalem and the Holy Places.

Mark Sykes was dispatched on instructions of the War Office at the beginning of June to discuss the committee&#x27;s findings with the British authorities in the Near and Middle East and at the same time to study the situation on the spot. He went to Athens, Gallipoli, Sofia, Cairo, Aden, Cairo a second time and then to India coming back to Basra in September and a third time to Cairo in November (where he was apprised of the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence) before returning home on 8 December and finally delivering his report to the War Committee on 16 December.

==Economic aspects==
In his introduction to a 2016 Symposium on the subject of Sykes–Picot, law professor Anghie notes that much of the agreement is given over to &quot;commercial and trade arrangements, to access to ports and the construction of railways&quot;.

Loevy makes a similar point in respect of sections 4 to 8 of the agreement and refers to British and French practicing &quot;Ottoman colonial development as insiders&quot; and that this experience acted as a road map for the later wartime negotiations. Khalidi point to the negotiations between Britain and France in 1913 and 1914 with respect to the Homs–Baghdad railway as well as the pre-war agreements that both empires made with Germany over other regions of the Middle East, as laying &quot;a clear basis&quot; for their later spheres of influence under the agreement.

In his doctoral thesis, Gibson discusses the part played by oil in British strategic thinking at the time and mentions the Mosul vilayet as the largest potential oilfield and France&#x27;s agreement in 1918 to agree to its inclusion in the Iraq Mandate (the Clemenceau Lloyd George Agreement) in exchange for &quot;a share of the oil and British support elsewhere&quot;.

==The agreement in practice==
===Syria, Palestine and the Arabs===
====Asquith Government (1916)====
Hussein&#x27;s letter of 18 February 1916 appealed to McMahon for £50,000 in gold plus weapons, ammunition and food claiming that Feisal was awaiting the arrival of &quot;not less than 100,000 people&quot; for the planned revolt and McMahon&#x27;s reply of 10 March 1916 confirmed the British agreement to the requests and concluded the ten letters of the correspondence. In April and May, there were discussions initiated by Sykes as to the merits of a meeting to include Picot and the Arabs to mesh the desiderata of both sides. At the same time, logistics in relation to the promised revolt were being dealt with and there was a rising level of impatience for action to be taken by Hussein. Finally, at the end of April, McMahon was advised of the terms of Sykes–Picot and he and Grey agreed that these would not be disclosed to the Arabs.

The Arab revolt was officially initiated by Hussein at Mecca on 10 June 1916 although his sons &#x27;Ali and Faisal had already initiated operations at Medina starting on 5 June. The timing had been brought forward by Hussein and, according to Cairo, &quot;Neither he nor we were at all ready in early June, 1916, and it was only with the greatest of difficulty that a minimum of sufficient assistance in material could be scraped together to ensure initial success.&quot;

Colonel Édouard Brémond was dispatched to Arabia in September 1916 as head of the French military mission to the Arabs. According to Cairo, Brémond was intent on containing the revolt so that the Arabs might not in any way threaten French interests in Syria. These concerns were not taken up in London, British-French cooperation was thought paramount and Cairo made aware of that. (Wingate was informed in late November that &quot;it would seem desirable to impress upon your subordinates the need for the most loyal cooperation with the French whom His Majesty&#x27;s Government do not suspect of ulterior designs in the Hijaz&quot;.)

As 1916 drew to a close, the Asquith government which had been under increasing pressure and criticism mainly due to its conduct of the war, gave way on 6 December to David Lloyd George who had been critical of the war effort and had succeeded Kitchener as Secretary of State for War after his untimely death in June. Lloyd George had wanted to make the destruction of the Ottoman Empire a major British war aim, and two days after taking office told Robertson that he wanted a major victory, preferably the capture of Jerusalem, to impress British public opinion. The EEF were, at the time, in defensive mode at a line on the eastern edge of the Sinai at El Arish and 15 miles from the borders of Ottoman Palestine. Lloyd George &quot;at once&quot; consulted his War Cabinet about a &quot;further campaign into Palestine when El Arish had been secured&quot;. Pressure from Lloyd George (over the reservations of Chief of the General Staff) resulted in the capture of Rafa and the arrival of British forces at the borders of the Ottoman Empire.

====Lloyd George Government (1917 onwards)====
Lloyd George set up a new small War Cabinet initially comprising Lords Curzon and Milner, Bonar Law, Arthur Henderson and himself; Hankey became the Secretary with Sykes, Ormsby-Gore and Amery as assistants. Although Arthur Balfour replaced Grey as Foreign Secretary, his exclusion from the War Cabinet and the activist stance of its members weakened his influence over foreign policy.

The French chose Picot as French High Commissioner for the soon to be occupied territory of Syria and Palestine. The British appointed Sykes as Chief Political Officer to the Egyptian Expeditionary Force. On 3 April 1917, Sykes met with Lloyd George, Curzon and Hankey to receive his instructions in this regard, namely to keep the French onside while pressing for a British Palestine. First Sykes in early May and then Picot and Sykes together visited the Hejaz later in May to discuss the agreement with Faisal and Hussein. Hussein was persuaded to agree to a formula to the effect that the French would pursue the same policy in Syria as the British in Baghdad; since Hussein believed that Baghdad would be part of the Arab State, that had eventually satisfied him. Later reports from participants expressed doubts about the precise nature of the discussions and the degree to which Hussein had really been informed as to the terms of Sykes–Picot.

Italy&#x27;s participation in the war, governed by the Treaty of London, eventually led to the Agreement of Saint-Jean-de-Maurienne in April 1917; at this conference, Lloyd George had raised the question of a British protectorate of Palestine and the idea &quot;had been very coldly received&quot; by the French and the Italians. The War Cabinet, reviewing this conference on 25 April, &quot;inclined to the view that sooner or later the Sykes–Picot Agreement might have to be reconsidered ... No action should be taken at present in this matter&quot;.

In between the meetings with Hussein, Sykes had informed London that &quot;the sooner French Military Mission is removed from Hedjaz the better&quot; and then Lord Bertie was instructed to request the same from the French on the grounds that the mission was hostile to the Arab cause and which &quot;cannot but prejudice Allied relations and policy in the Hedjaz and may even affect whole future of French relations with the Arabs&quot;. After the French response to this, on 31 May 1917, William Ormsby-Gore wrote:
The British Government, in authorising the letters despatched to King Hussein [Sharif of Mecca] before the outbreak of the revolt by Sir Henry McMahon, would seem to raise a doubt as to whether our pledges to King Hussein as head of the Arab nation are consistent with French intentions to make not only Syria but Upper Mesopotamia another Tunis. If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguished origin and prestige means anything it means that we are prepared to recognize the full sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria. It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our detailed pledges to King Hussein, and to make it clear to the latter whether he or someone else is to be the ruler of Damascus, which is the one possible capital for an Arab State, which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.
In a further sign of British discontent with Sykes–Picot, in August, Sykes penned a &quot;Memorandum on the Asia Minor Agreement&quot; that was tantamount to advocating its renegotiation else that it be made clear to the French that they &quot;make good—that is to say that if they cannot make a military effort compatible with their policy they should modify their policy&quot;. After many discussions, Sykes was directed to conclude with Picot an agreement or supplement to Sykes–Picot (&quot;Projet d&#x27;Arrangement&quot;) covering the &quot;future status of the Hejaz and Arabia&quot; and this was achieved by the end of September. However, by the end of the year, the agreement had yet to be ratified by the French Government.

The Balfour Declaration along with its potential claim in Palestine was in the meantime issued on 2 November and the British entered Jerusalem on 9 December, with Allenby on foot 2 days later accompanied by representatives of the French and Italian detachments.

====After public disclosure (1917–18)====

Russian claims in the Ottoman Empire were denied following the Bolshevik Revolution and the Bolsheviks released a copy of the Sykes–Picot Agreement (as well as other treaties). They revealed full texts in &quot;Izvestia&quot; and &quot;Pravda&quot; on 23 November 1917; subsequently, &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; printed the texts on 26 November 1917. That caused great embarrassment to the allies and growing distrust between them and the Arabs. Earlier, in April, the Zionists had confirmed the details of the Agreement with the British government.

U.S. President Woodrow Wilson had rejected all secret agreements made between the Allies and promoted open diplomacy as well as ideas about self-determination. On 22 November 1917, Leon Trotsky addressed a note to the ambassadors at Petrograd &quot;containing proposals for a truce and a democratic peace without annexation and without indemnities, based on the principle of the independence of nations, and of their right to determine the nature of their own development themselves&quot;. Peace negotiations with the Quadruple Alliance—Germany, Austria–Hungary, Bulgaria and Turkey—started at Brest–Litovsk one month later. On behalf of the Quadruple Alliance, Count Czernin, replied on 25 December that the &quot;question of State allegiance of national groups which possess no State independence&quot; should be solved by &quot;every State with its peoples independently in a constitutional manner&quot;, and that &quot;the right of minorities forms an essential component part of the constitutional right of peoples to self-determination&quot;.

In his turn, Lloyd George delivered a speech on war aims on 5 January, including references to the right of self-determination and &quot;consent of the governed&quot; as well as to secret treaties and the changed circumstances regarding them. Three days later, Wilson weighed in with his Fourteen Points, the twelfth being that &quot;the Turkish portions of the present Ottoman Empire should be assured a secure sovereignty, but the other nationalities which are now under Turkish rule should be assured an undoubted security of life and an absolutely unmolested opportunity of autonomous development&quot;.

On 23 December 1917, Sykes (who had been sent to France in mid-December to see what was happening with the Projet d&#x27;Arrangement) and a representative of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs had delivered public addresses to the Central Syrian Committee at Paris in Paris on the non-Turkish elements of the Ottoman Empire, including liberated Jerusalem. Sykes had stated that the accomplished fact of the independence of the Hejaz rendered it almost impossible that an effective and real autonomy should be refused to Syria. However, the minutes also record that the Syrian Arabs in Egypt were not happy with developments and absent a clearer, less ambiguous statement in regard to the future of Syria and Mesopotamia then the Allies as well as the King of the Hedjaz would lose much Arab support.

Sykes was the author of the Hogarth Message a secret January 1918 message to Hussein following his request for an explanation of the Balfour Declaration and the Bassett Letter was a letter (also secret) dated 8 February 1918 from the British Government to Hussein following his request for an explanation of the Sykes–Picot Agreement.

The failure of the Projet d&#x27;Arrangement reflected poorly on Sykes and following on from the doubts about his explanations of Sykes–Picot to Hussein the previous year, weakened his credibility on Middle Eastern affairs throughout 1918. Still (at his own request, now Acting Adviser on Arabian and Palestine Affairs at the Foreign Office) he continued his criticism of Sykes–Picot, minuting on 16 February that &quot;the Anglo–French Agreement of 1916 in regard to Asia Minor should come up for reconsideration&quot; and then on 3 March, writing to Clayton, &quot;the stipulations in regard to the red and blue areas can only be regarded as quite contrary to the spirit of every ministerial speech that has been made for the last three months&quot;.

On 28 March 1918 the first meeting of the newly formed Eastern Committee was held, chaired by Curzon.

In May, Clayton told Balfour that Picot had, in response to a suggestion that the agreement was moot, &quot;allowed that considerable revision was required in view of changes that had taken place in the situation since agreement was drawn up&quot;, but nevertheless considered that &quot;agreement holds, at any rate principle&quot;.

The British issued the Declaration to the Seven on 16 June, the first British pronouncement to the Arabs advancing the principle of national self-determination.

On 30 September 1918, supporters of the Arab Revolt in Damascus declared a government loyal to the Sharif of Mecca. He had been declared King of the Arabs by a handful of religious leaders and other notables in Mecca.

The Arab and British armies entered Damascus on 1 October 1918, and on 3 October 1918 Ali Rida al-Rikabi was appointed Military Governor of Occupied Enemy Territory Administration East. Faisal entered Damascus on 4 October and appointed Rikabi Chief of the Council of Directors (i.e. prime minister) of Syria.

On 5 October, with the permission of General Allenby, Faisal announced the establishment of a fully and absolutely independent Arab constitutional government. Faisal announced it would be an Arab government based on justice and equality for all Arabs regardless of religion.

The Anglo-French Declaration of November 1918 pledged that Great Britain and France would &quot;assist in the establishment of indigenous Governments and administrations in Syria and Mesopotamia&quot; by &quot;setting up of national governments and administrations deriving their authority from the free exercise of the initiative and choice of the indigenous populations&quot;. The French had reluctantly agreed to issue the declaration at the insistence of the British. Minutes of a British War Cabinet meeting reveal that the British had cited the laws of conquest and military occupation to avoid sharing the administration with the French under a civilian regime. The British stressed that the terms of the Anglo–French declaration had superseded the Sykes–Picot Agreement in order to justify fresh negotiations over the allocation of the territories of Syria, Mesopotamia, and Palestine.

George Curzon said the Great Powers were still committed to the Règlement Organique agreement, which concerned governance and non-intervention in the affairs of the Maronite, Orthodox Christian, Druze and Muslim communities, regarding the Beirut Vilayet of June 1861 and September 1864, and added that the rights granted to France in what is today modern Syria and parts of Turkey under Sykes–Picot were incompatible with that agreement.

=====Mosul and Palestine modification=====
On 30 October, the Ottoman Empire had signed the Armistice of Mudros. On 2 November, the British occupied the Mosul Vilayet which led to the territorial dispute known as the Mosul Question.

At the French embassy in London on Sunday 1 December, David Lloyd George and Clemenceau had a private and undocumented meeting where the latter surrendered French rights to Mosul (the city of Mosul and south to the Little Zab) and to Palestine that had been given by the Sykes–Picot Agreement. Although Lloyd George and others have suggested that nothing was given in return, according to Ian Rutledge and James Barr, Lloyd George promised at least one or even all of, support for French claims on the Ruhr, that when oil production in Mosul began, France would receive a share and that Sykes–Picot obligation would be maintained as regards Syria.

====Paris Peace Conference (1919–20)====

The Eastern Committee met nine times in November and December to draft a set of resolutions on British policy for the benefit of the negotiators.

On 21 October, the War Cabinet asked Smuts to prepare the peace brief in summary form and he asked Erle Richards to carry out this task resulting in a &quot;P-memo&quot; for use by the Peace Conference delegates. The conclusions of the Eastern Committee at page 4 of the P-memo included as objectives the cancellation of Sykes–Picot and supporting the Arabs in their claim to a state with capital at Damascus (in line with the McMahon–Hussein Correspondence).

At the Peace Conference, which officially opened on 18 January, the Big Four (initially a &quot;Council of Ten&quot; comprising two delegates each from Britain, France, the United States, Italy and Japan, but Japan withdrew from the conference) agreed, on 30 January, the outlines of a Mandate system (including three levels of Mandate) later to become Article 22 of the League Covenant. The Big Four would later decide which communities, under what conditions and which Mandatory.

Minutes taken during a meeting of The Big Four held in Paris on 20 March 1919 and attended by Woodrow Wilson, Georges Clemenceau, Vittorio Emanuele Orlando as well as Lloyd George and Arthur Balfour, explained the British and French points of view concerning the agreement. It was the first topic brought up during the discussion of Syria and Turkey, and formed the focus of all discussions thereafter.

The Anglo-French Declaration was read into the minutes, Pichon commenting that it showed the disinterested position of both governments in regard to the Arabs and Lloyd George that it was &quot;more important than all the old agreements&quot;. Pichon went on to mention a proposed scheme of agreement of 15 February based on the private agreement reached between Clemenceau and Lloyd George the previous December. (According to Lieshout, just before Faisal made his presentation to the conference on the 6th, Clemenceau handed Lloyd George a proposal which appears to cover the same subject matter; Lieshout having accessed related British materials dated the 6th whereas the date in the minutes is unsourced.)

In the subsequent discussions, France staked its claim to Syria (and its mandate) while the British sought to carve out the Arab areas of zones A and B arguing that France had implicitly accepted such an arrangement even though it was the British that had entered into the arrangement with the Arabs.

Wilson intervened and stressed the principle of consent of the governed whether it be Syria or Mesopotamia, that he thought the issues involved the peace of the world and were not necessarily just a matter between France and Britain. He suggested that an Inter-Allied Commission be formed and sent out to find out the wishes of local inhabitants in the region. The discussion concluded with Wilson agreeing to draft a Terms of Reference to the commission.

On 21 April, Faisal left for the East. Before he left, on 17 April Clemenceau sent a draft letter, in which the French government declared that they recognized &quot;the right of Syria to independence in the form of a federation of autonomous governments in agreement with the traditions and wishes of the populations&quot;, and claimed that Faisal had recognized &quot;that France is the Power qualified to render Syria the assistance of various advisors necessary to introduce order and realise the progress demanded by the Syrian populations&quot; and on 20 April, Faisal assured Clemenceau that he had been &quot;Deeply impressed by the disinterested friendliness of your statements to me while I was in Paris, and must thank you for having been the first to suggest the dispatch of the inter-allied Commission, which is to leave shortly for the East to ascertain the wishes of the local peoples as to the future organisation of their country. I am sure that the people of Syria will know how to show you their gratitude.&quot;

Meanwhile, as of late May, the standoff between the French and the British as to disposition of forces continued, the French continued to press for a replacement of British by French troops in Syria amid arguments about precise geographical limits of same and in general the relationship suffered; after the meeting on the 21st, Lloyd George had written to Clemenceau and cancelled the Long–Bérenger Oil Agreement (a revised version of which had been agreed at the end of April) claiming to have known nothing about it and not wanting it to become an issue while Clemenceau claimed that had not been the subject of any argument. There were also discussions as to what precisely had been agreed or not at the private meeting between Clemenceau and Lloyd George the previous December.

In June 1919, the American King–Crane Commission arrived in Syria to inquire into local public opinion about the future of the country. After many vicissitudes, &quot;mired in confusion and intrigue&quot;, &quot;Lloyd George had second thoughts...&quot;, the French and British had declined to participate.

The Syrian National Congress had been convened in May 1919 to consider the future of the region of Syria and to present Arab views contained in a 2 July resolution to the King-Crane Commission.

The Peace treaty with Germany was signed on 28 June and with the departure of Wilson and Lloyd George from Paris, the result was that the Turkey/Syria question was effectively placed on hold.

On 15 September, the British handed out an Aide Memoire (which had been discussed privately two days before between Lloyd George and Clemenceau) whereby the British would withdraw their troops to Palestine and Mesopotamia and hand over Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo to Faisal&#x27;s forces. While accepting the withdrawal, Clemenceau continued to insist on the Sykes–Picot agreement as being the basis for all discussions.

On 18 September, Faisal arrived in London and the next day and on the 23rd had lengthy meetings with Lloyd George who explained the Aide Memoire and British position. Lloyd George explained that he was &quot;in the position of a man who had inherited two sets of engagements, those to King Hussein and those to the French&quot;, Faisal noting that the arrangement &quot;seemed to be based on the 1916 agreement between the British and the French&quot;. Clemenceau, replying in respect of the Aide Memoire, refused to move on Syria and said that the matter should be left for the French to handle directly with Faisal.

Faisal arrived in Paris on 20 October and eventually on 6 January 1920 Faisal accepted a French mandate &quot;for the whole of Syria&quot;, while France in return consented &quot;to the formation of an Arab state that included Damascus, Homs, Hama and Aleppo, and was to be administered by the Emir with the assistance of French advisers&quot; (acknowledged &quot;the right of Syrians to unite to govern themselves as an independent nation&quot;.). In the meantime, British forces withdrew from Damascus on 26 November.

Faisal returned to Damascus on 16 January and Millerand took over from Clemenceau on the 20th. A Syrian National Congress meeting in Damascus declared an independent state of Syria on 8 March 1920. The new state intended to include portions of Syria, Palestine, and northern Mesopotamia. Faisal was declared the head of State. At the same time Prince Zeid, Faisal&#x27;s brother, was declared Regent of Mesopotamia.

In April 1920, the San Remo conference handed out Class A mandates over Syria to France, and Iraq and Palestine to Britain. The same conference ratified an oil agreement reached at a London conference on 12 February, based on a slightly different version of the Long Berenger agreement previously initialled in London on 21 December.

France had decided to govern Syria directly, and took action to enforce the French Mandate of Syria before the terms had been accepted by the Council of the League of Nations. The French issued an ultimatum and intervened militarily at the Battle of Maysalun in June 1920. They deposed the indigenous Arab government, and removed King Faisal from Damascus in August 1920. Great Britain also appointed a High Commissioner and established their own mandatory regime in Palestine, without first obtaining approval from the Council of the League of Nations, or obtaining the formal cession of the territory from the former sovereign, Turkey.

===Iraq and the Persian Gulf===

In November 1914, the British had occupied Basra. According to the report of the de Bunsen Committee, British interests in Mesopotamia were defined by the need to protect the western flank of India and protect commercial interests including oil. The British also became concerned about the Berlin–Baghdad railway. Although never ratified, the British had also initialled the Anglo-Ottoman Convention of 1913.

As part of the Mesopotamian campaign, on 11 March 1917, the British entered Baghdad, the Armistice of Mudros was signed on 30 October 1918 although the British continued their advance, entering Mosul on 2 November.

Following the award of the British Mandate of Mesopotamia at San Remo, the British were faced with an Iraqi revolt against the British from July until February 1921, as well as a Kurdish revolt in Northern Iraq. Following the Cairo Conference it was decided that Faisal should be installed as ruler in Mandatory Iraq.

===Kurds and Assyrians===
As originally cast, Sykes–Picot allocated part of Northern Kurdistan and a substantial part of the Mosul vilayet including the city of Mosul to France in area B, Russia obtained Bitlis and Van in Northern Kurdistan (the contemplated Arab State included Kurds in its Eastern limit split between A and B areas). Bowman says there were around 2.5 million Kurds in Turkey, mainly in the mountain region called Kurdistan.

Şerif Pasha known as Sharif Pasha presented a &quot;Memorandum on the Claims of the Kurd People&quot; to the Paris Peace Conference in 1919 and the suppressed report of the King–Crane Commission also recommended a form of autonomy in &quot;the natural geographical area which lies between the proposed Armenia on the north and Mesopotamia on the south, with the divide between the Euphrates and the Tigris as the western boundary, and the Persian frontier as the eastern boundary&quot;.

The Russians gave up territorial claims following the Bolshevik revolution and at the San Remo conference, the French were awarded the French Mandate of Syria and the English the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. The subsequent Treaty of Sèvres potentially provided for a Kurdish territory subject to a referendum and League of Nations sanction within a year of the treaty. However, the Turkish War of Independence led to the treaty being superseded by the Treaty of Lausanne in which there was no provision for a Kurdish State.

The result was that the Kurds, along with their Assyrian neighbors, were divided between Turkey, Iraq, Syria and Iran.

==Conflicting promises and consequences==
Many sources contend that Sykes–Picot conflicted with the Hussein–McMahon Correspondence of 1915–1916 and that the publication of the agreement in November 1917 caused the resignation of Sir Henry McMahon. There were several points of difference, the most obvious being Iraq placed in the British red area and less obviously, the idea that British and French advisors would be in control of the area designated as being for an Arab State. Lastly, while the correspondence made no mention of Palestine, Haifa and Acre were to be British and the brown area (a reduced Palestine) internationalised.

==Modern politics==
Leading up to the centenary of Sykes–Picot in 2016, great interest was generated among the media and academia concerning the long-term effects of the agreement. The agreement is frequently cited as having created &quot;artificial&quot; borders in the Middle East, &quot;without any regard to ethnic or sectarian characteristics, [which] has resulted in endless conflict.&quot; The extent to which Sykes–Picot actually shaped the borders of the modern Middle East is disputed.

The Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) claimed one of the goals of its insurgency is to reverse the effects of the Sykes–Picot Agreement for the purpose of building a united Islamic State. &quot;We don&#x27;t recognise it and we will never recognise it. This is not the first border we will break, we will break other borders,&quot; a jihadist from the ISIL, Abu Safiyya, warned in a video titled &quot;End of Sykes–Picot&quot;. ISIL&#x27;s former leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, in a July 2014 speech at the Great Mosque of al-Nuri in Mosul, vowed that &quot;this blessed advance will not stop until we hit the last nail in the coffin of the Sykes–Picot conspiracy&quot;. Former French Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin presented a similar geopolitical analysis in an editorial contribution for the French newspaper &quot;Le Monde&quot;.

<doc id="266411" wikidata="Q2654742" url="?curid=266411" title="Solomon Caesar Malan">
<text>Solomon Caesar Malan (22 April 1812 – 25 November 1894) D.D., Vicar of Broadwindsor, Prebendary of Sarum, was a Geneva-born Anglican divine, a polyglot and orientalist. He published around 50 works related to biblical studies and translations.

Malan&#x27;s &quot;Original Notes on the Book of Proverbs&quot; (1889–1893) is now considered significant for his critical insights. Near the end of his life he gave to notable institutions, including a set of Tibetan sutras to the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, and most of his personal library to the Indian Institute in Oxford. It became the Malan Library, and after its dispersal in the 1960s, was recognized as foundational for the Oriental Division in the Bodleian Libraries.

==Early life in Geneva==

By birth a Genevan descended from an exiled French family, Malan was born as César Jean Salomon Malan in Geneva. He was the first of a dozen children born to his gifted father, Dr. Henri Abraham César Malan (1787–1864) and his Swiss wife, Salomé Georgette Jeanne Schönberger (1790-unknown). She is rarely mentioned in any of the published writings related to Solomon Caesar Malan&#x27;s life. His father was a counter-cultural theological teacher in the final years of Genevan city-state history and became a controversial Swiss religious leader, whose evangelical version of Protestant faith challenged the rationalized Enlightenment Calvinism that had become dominant in the first years of 19th century Geneva. Ultimately rejected by the Genevan Calvinist hierarchy as a minister in their community in 1818, the father Malan set up his own church community on his own property, offering a vital Christian alternative in worship to what was offered in the state church. Writing hymns in French that became famous for their theological vitality, and publishing numerous short stories and some larger works as a Swiss evangelical intellectual, the father Malan became known as an evangelical international missionary in various European countries, as well as in Great Britain, particularly within Scotland. His honorary doctorate was given by the University of Glasgow, indicating the level of respect he had attained outside of Switzerland.
This situation of social alienation and counter-cultural religious assertiveness profoundly shaped the early years and educational training of the first son, César Jean Salomon. The education his first son received was essentially a home education, in which César Jean Salomon thrived. Under his father&#x27;s guidance, he initially learned Latin (his &quot;father tongue&quot; and first language), French, German and Italian. According to his son&#x27;s biography, at the age of 18 César Jean Salomon Malan had already made progress in Sanskrit, Arabic and Hebrew. In addition, however, he also was trained by his father in a wide variety of fine and technical arts. His lessons in sketching and watercolours were taught by a private tutor and bore extensive fruitfulness in much-appreciated sketches and paintings in his later years. During these formative years, César Jean Salomon also was taught botany, and because of his father&#x27;s gift of a rather sophisticated workshop for his bright son, he learned skills in carpentry, bookbinding, and printing. As revealed later in his life, his bookbinding skills were aesthetically impressive. Also, the mature son Malan knew enough music theory and how to play some musical instruments to employ them in his ministry. Probably during this early period of his life, he had also begun to study calligraphy, an art in which he later excelled in numerous styles and languages. Because of his father&#x27;s growing international reputation as an evangelical theologian, there were a number of international guests who visited their Swiss Genevan home, and in that context, the eldest son met the first love of his life, the daughter of an English evangelical Anglican, Mary Marsh Mortlock (1813-1840). Though his father had hoped that the first son would follow him in his distinctive ministry in Geneva as what could be seen as a Free Church or Dissenter Christian community, César Jean Salomon chose another route that led him to leave Switzerland and his father&#x27;s work.

==To Great Britain and formal education in Oxford==
From his earliest youth, he manifested a remarkable faculty for the study of languages, but it was the romantic relationship he developed with Mary Mortlock that would reshape his destiny, move him to leave his father&#x27;s home, and adopt the English name, Solomon Caesar Malan. After some difficult questions emerged regarding the romantic relationship between César Jean Salomon Malan and Mary Morlock, an agreement between the two fathers was reached, that included a way for the son Malan to attain a solid grasp of English, obtain a formal education, and marry. Mary&#x27;s father agreed to support the young Malan&#x27;s education if he could successfully matriculate into a college in Oxford. In order to do so, they agreed that he should serve as a family tutor in Great Britain for a period, so that he could become capable in English to sit for the university entrance examinations. If he succeeded in these matters, then it was also agreed that César and Mary could marry. What was an additional religious problem involved in these arrangements is that colleges in Oxford required that a person who graduated would agree with the principles of the Anglican faith, including its support for the English royal family, a principle that was opposed by Malan&#x27;s father. Nevertheless, once the arrangements were settled, a new set of challenges and opportunities opened up for the life of the son who would subsequently be known as Solomon Caesar Malan.
As a consequence, when the young Malan was twenty years old, an arrangement was made for him in 1832 to travel to Scotland and serve as a tutor in the marquis of Tweeddale&#x27;s family. The university examinations occurred the following year, but the young Malan was still self-consciously lacking confidence in the quality of his English. Hoping to overcome that difficulty, he petitioned the examiners to allow him to do his paperwork during the examination in French, German, Spanish, Italian, Latin or Greek, rather than in English. Though his request was not granted, the young Swiss scholar managed to pass. Consequently, in 1833 he matriculated at St Edmund Hall, Oxford. A year later in 1834, Solomon and Mary were married, and the relatively young Swiss student began to thrive in his studies. Unquestionably, the young Malan took up his opportunity to study in Oxford with a vigour and intensity driven by both an insatiable desire to learn all that he could and to please those who had agreed to support him and his wife. Unfortunately, this led to his losing sight in his left eye during those years, a threat to his gifted scholarly intentions, but one that did not ultimately obstruct either his personal motivation to learn or his intense self-imposed disciplines. In fact, during his years of study in Oxford, he earned two major scholarships: the Boden scholarship for Sanskrit in 1834, and the Pusey and Ellerton scholarship for Hebrew in 1837. Obviously, this indicates something about his level of scholarly attainment in those two classical languages. When he graduated in 1837, it was not with extraordinary honours, but he did achieve a 2nd class in &quot;Literae humaniores&quot;. 
Unknown to many others at the time, Solomon Caesar Malan took it upon himself as a newcomer to Oxford to become an expert in proverbial literature. Using the Hebrew biblical text of the proverbs, which are mostly attributed to his namesake, King Solomon, as the basis for this personal research project, Malan took this task also as an act of devotion to the biblical text that he, his father, and his wife all considered to be divine revelation. As the inside flyleaf to the manuscript version of his &quot;Original Notes on the Book of Proverbs&quot; reveals, he began the multilingual recordings of parallel or antagonistic proverbs in 1833, the year he initiated his university studies in Oxford. For just over sixty years he devoted himself to this study, ultimately donating the huge manuscript that he had produced at the end of his life to the Bodleian Library in Oxford in 1894, just a few months before his death. Originally pursued 
as a matter of interest in comparative wisdom literature and an enrichment of his own biblical convictions, and so never meant to be published, later in his life others urged him to consider publishing some account of this unusual intellectual journey. Consequently, during the last decade of his life Malan figured out how he might approach that major effort, and so ended up making it his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, publishing the results of his six decades of labour in an English translated version in three volumes, a matter that will be discussed in greater detail below. So, even as Solomon and Mary were starting their young family, the young Oxford scholar&#x27;s interest in biblical studies and proverbial wisdom had begun in earnest while he was studying at St. Edmund Hall.

==A missionary-educator in Calcutta==
Because the young Malan couple were evangelical in their Protestant faith, and had become oriented to a low-church Anglican expression of Christianity during their residence in Oxford, it became possible for the young Swiss university graduate from Oxford to apply to the [Anglican] Church Missionary Society to take up a position as a missionary-educator. Though this was an extraordinary request from a 25-year-old foreign student in 1837, the need for qualified missionary educators in India, where he applied, was profound, and so arrangements were made so that his application could be accepted. By early 1838 the Malan family was on a ship headed to India, arriving in May 1838, so that he could take up the position of Professor of Classical Languages at Bishop&#x27;s College, Calcutta. Once they had arrived, Malan began his educational work and a month later was made a deacon of the Anglican church, and so could be formally recognized in his position at Bishop&#x27;s College as an Anglican church leader. A young faculty member eager to serve, and to throw himself into his work with an intensity that had previously cost him the sight in his left eye, Malan added to his duties as a lecturer also his musical talents on organ, the responsibilities of leading chapel, and was also made the Secretary to the Bengal Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society. Notably, by November 1838 he and his family were suffering physically from illnesses, and Malan himself was once again troubled with visual problems that greatly hindered his work. Ultimately 
he and his family were required by a physician to depart for a milder climate in order to recuperate. Joining his wife and three sons on their voyage to South Africa in early 1839, Malan agreed for Mary and their sons to travel back to Great Britain while he returned to Calcutta. Enduring work back in Bishop&#x27;s College from November 1839 till April 1840, Malan was once again forced to leave Calcutta because of his deteriorating health. Later in 1840, while recuperating in South Africa, Malan learned that Mary had died after returning to Great Britain. 
This traumatic context of Malan&#x27;s short-lived tenure as a missionary educator in Calcutta should not be understated or overlooked, because his acquisition of living and ancient &quot;eastern languages&quot; began in earnest during this period. From a younger Chinese student, whose name in Cantonese was Ho Tsun-sheen (Mandarin, He Jinshan, 1817-1871), and who attended Bishop&#x27;s College at that time as the only person of Chinese ethnicity there, Malan learned the rudiments and grammar of ancient and contemporary Chinese writing. Additionally, from the rather shy and reclusive librarian assistant at the Library of the Royal Asiatic Society in Calcutta, a Hungarian named Alexander Csoma de Kőrös (1784-1842), he not only learned foundational knowledge of both Tibetan language and Tibetan Buddhism, but also was given a cache of nearly forty Tibetan manuscripts Csoma de Kőrös had collected from his interactions with Tibetan monks in the area of Ladahk. Subsequently, Malan would demonstrate his competence in reading texts in Chinese and Tibetan that stemmed from these initial personal encounters with those who could teach him those languages. In addition, Malan managed to learn and continue to collect and study texts written in Indian sub-continental languages from this period, so that within his own personal library he had collected books and manuscripts from thirteen Indian languages. One might say that Malan&#x27;s relatively brief experiences in India ignited his appetite for foreign language learning in ways that would have been impossible otherwise.

==Traumatic transformations and vicarate in Broadwindsor==

The death of his young wife, Mary, required Malan to reconsider his life&#x27;s vocation and adjust to the needs of his sons. Having learned of her death while in South Africa for his second period of recuperation, Malan made arrangements for the care of his sons, and worked out his grief in part by a means that would become a repeated pattern in his later years: obtaining permission to travel internationally. In the early 1840s, he travelled for the first time to Palestine, carrying along with him a sketchbook in which he documented his itinerary with sketches and watercolours. Returning to England with a renewed will, he cared for his sons while serving in two curacies, and in 1843 was married to the daughter of an Anglican leader, Caroline Seline Mount (1821-1911). Being nine years younger than Malan himself, Caroline Malan cared for the boys from his previous marriage and became mother of at least five other children. After serving as a subordinate priest for several years, Malan was offered in 1845 the vicarate in Broadwindsor, Dorset, one that included a sizeable home and provided a handsome income that could house his growing family. Having settled into this ministry along with his family, Malan remained affiliated as vicar of this countryside congregation for four decades, a period he once referred to as his own &quot;forty years in the wilderness.&quot; In spite of this self-deprecating reference to Broadwindsor and his ministry there, Malan was enabled to do many more things that his polymath interests prompted him to pursue while there than if he had been, for example, a professor in Oxford. His living amounted to more than twice the salary given to some notable professors in Oxford, and so allowed him to adopt a lifestyle that would not have been possible even in the prestigious context of Oxford.
As has been indicated already to some degree, it was during this extensive period as vicar of Broadwindsor that Malan thrived not only as a pastoral figure but also in producing numerous publications and other works. These included translations from ancient Christian sources, various architectural and artistic productions, and extended into biblical studies as well as proverbial literature in as many languages as he could learn from texts that he was able to obtain from a relatively wide range of locations. Though hyperpolyglots are known to live within an autistic spectrum that can make them difficult to live with, Malan tried to manage his tendencies and attitudes associated with perfectionism as well as his highly opinionated assessments of some persons and issues, by occasionally gaining the approval of his bishop to travel in Eastern Europe and Mediterranean lands. This included Syria and Palestine. During those four decades, his published biblical works were wide-ranging, including not only textual studies of ancient translations of the Gospel of John, but also critical studies of translations of the Bible in a number of Asiatic languages, including Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Mongolian. Malan also produced two large works for children about Gospel parables and miracles. It is notable that his sketch art was considered of such quality that nearly four dozen of his pieces were included in an edition of the King James Bible produced in 1865. In his &quot;magnum opus&quot;, the three-volume work entitled &quot;Original Notes on the Book of Proverbs&quot; (1889-1893), Malan demonstrated various levels of what could be assessed as &quot;general competence&quot; in reading and translating proverbial literature into English from at least fifty-four different languages. In that final and massive work—one that has been largely overlooked and not understood to any degree until very recently—most of the proverbial sayings he had read and translated into English came from texts in &quot;eastern&quot; cultures, including works in East Asian, Southeast Asian, and Central Asian languages. In that same work, he also included a good number of suitable sayings from Mediterranean and European language texts, including among those most often cited language texts proverbial sayings from Aramaic, Egyptian hieroglyphics, Georgian, Greek, Hebrew, Italian, Latin, Spanish and Welsh. 
Public recognition of his talents as a linguist and his wide-ranging contributions as a Biblical scholar was confirmed through the University of Edinburgh, who presented him with an honorary doctorate for these achievements in 1880. In order to portray these multifaceted aspects of his life and interests, further summaries of his contributions will be described and evaluated in the following three sections of this article.

==Contributions to Christian and biblical scholarship==
For more than a century after his death, Solomon Caesar Malan&#x27;s published works have been generally characterized as having, revealed through translation, many important aspects of non-European Christian and sapiential traditions; yet, while heightening his polyglot talents by this means, at the same time Malan&#x27;s critics have denied that there was anything notably scholarly, critical, or creative within them. Recent scholarly assessments of his published Christian and biblical studies have challenged these previous judgments. An initial indication of some of Malan&#x27;s critical insights applied to biblical texts is discovered within the 1862 account of the &quot;deeper truths&quot; revealed by comparing eleven older translations of the Gospel of John with its &quot;koiné&quot; Greek standard text. As the subtitle of the work indicates, Malan&#x27;s research into those eleven ancient versions (notably not including the Vulgate version) was intended to counteract textual changes to the Gospel of John proposed by a group of Anglican clerics using other standards of textual analysis. What Malan was essentially arguing is that variants found in some Greek versions of the Gospel of John should not only be weighed against the standard Greek text (the Textus Receptus) used in the creation of the King James Bible but also those variants should be evaluated in the light of how many other early translations of the Gospel of John support those alternatives. On this basis, Malan argued that &quot;deeper truths&quot; about the text and claims of that New Testament document could then be discerningly and more justifiably confirmed. As a consequence, Malan was providing critical textual insights into ancient Christian traditions of the transmission of the Gospel of John, and applying them as critical standards to challenge the textual alterations adopted by his more radical Anglican clerical colleagues. He did this notably by offering English renderings of eleven other ancient translations, accompanied by footnotes indicating various subtleties in those texts. This is despite having to work with ancient translations in &quot;Syrian, Ethiopic, Armenian, Sahidic, Mephitic, Gothic, Georgian, Sclavonic [sic], Anglo-Saxon, Arabic, and Persian.&quot; Malan was countering a textual skepticism that arose from those clerics&#x27; assertions of the need for &quot;textual alternatives,&quot; and anticipating an approach that has now been adopted regularly in New Testament textual scholarship. A second area of critically insightful evaluations that Malan published had to do with the use of various theological terms in biblical translations within Chinese, Japanese, Korean, and Mongolian renderings as they were found in versions produced in the mid-19th century. These works were written and published in order to help those producing Bibles in various languages to have critical awareness of what they were promoting. Two other critical advances in biblical scholarship have been recently highlighted through studies of Malan&#x27;s three-volume &quot;magnum opus&quot;, &quot;Original Notes on the Book of Proverbs&quot; (1889-1893). One of these critical advances was the addition of etymological notes before most sections of the biblical book of Proverbs studied in this work. Within them, Malan used scholarly accounts of the Hebrew standard text to challenge renderings in the Septuagint Greek, Latin Vulgate, and English King James Version of those same texts. He did this by means of his substantial Hebrew scholarly assessments, by reference to the Chaldean Targum, and versions of the biblical proverbial texts in Arabic, Armenian, Coptic and Syriac. The fact that he criticized the King James Version&#x27;s English renderings in this context is quite unexpected by those who knew Malan to be, as he was a strong advocate for the beauty and authority of the King James English Bible. The second critical advance within Malan&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus&quot; is his recognition of a series of ancient Egyptian proverbial texts with those found in a section he highlighted from Proverbs 22:17 to 24:22. The importance and significance of these Hebrew-Egyptian parallels within these specific portions of the biblical book of Proverbs was only recognized in biblical scholarship in the early 1920s, and has continued to be debated by biblical scholars and Egyptologists into the 21st century. Though Malan&#x27;s work does not contribute to the debates that later have become attached to these passages, he did recognize the parallels existed, and documented them in his footnotes with a thoroughness that anticipated the debates by at least three decades, if not more.
Finally, two other contributions Malan made to Christian scholarship in 19th-century Great Britain rightly deserve to be identified and elaborated. First, there was his extensive interest in what can be called &quot;Eastern Christianity,&quot; an interest that stood in stark contrast to his principled opposition to Roman Catholic liturgical and theological traditions. From his own assessment of these alternative traditions of Christianity, he considered them not to be heretical (which was the general attitude of many in his day), but worthy of recognition and having creatively produced spiritual literature that he felt could be edifying for Anglican priests and their parishes. The number of translations from various traditions vary, but it is notable to point out that he rendered Greek Orthodox, Russian Orthodox, Georgian, Syrian, Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopic sources into English texts. Malan contributed to what could become part of an ecumenical bridge to these other Christian traditions that did not otherwise exist in 19th century Great Britain. His second contribution was to Christian missiology, as seen particularly in an unassuming volume he published in 1858 under the title of &quot;Letters to a Young Missionary&quot;. Within that volume, Malan offered advice regarding the maintenance of a &quot;cross-cultural openness&quot;, in opposition to an aggressive cultural rejection of traditions in various mission fields. Instead, Malan provided justifications for a missionary attitude that respects ancient and classical traditions within non-Christian cultures. His final published effort began after he had retired from his vicarate in the small village of Broadwindsor, and took up residence with his wife in Bournemouth starting in 1885. Perhaps it was because he had left his pastoral position that he felt more free to present critical assessments of the renderings of the Book of Proverbs in the King James Bible. Malan worked in Bournemouth on the published version of &quot;Original Notes on the Book of Proverbs&quot; without access to his personal library until very near his death in 1894.

==The Malan Library in Oxford and its dissolution==
Only in the most recent scholarship on Malan has a thorough attempt to identify and describe what was called &quot;The Malan Library&quot; been documented. The personal library of Solomon Caesar Malan was unique, not only because of the more than one hundred languages represented within it, but because it consisted of not only published books or codices, but also parchments and hand-written manuscripts in numerous languages. Another way to characterize this library is through a portrayal of the scholarly achievement of Malan himself. This was done in part in the previous section, but here a citation from Monier Monier-Wiliams (1819-1899), the Boden Professor of Sanskrit as well as Keeper and Curator of the Indian Institute in Oxford at the time, had this to say about Malan: Malan was &quot;an Orientalist absolutely unequalled, and never likely to be equalled, in respect of the marvellous diversity of his linguistic attainments and the profundity of his scholarship.&quot; Historically, it was the personal libraries of Malan and Monier-Williams that set the foundation for what is now the Oriental Division in the Bodleian Libraries, highlighting their significance as donations to Oxford University. There is a need to be alert to several factors related to the donation of this library collection made by Malan in January 1885. What was donated did not include the vast majority of the Tibetan documents that Malan had kept until 1884. The extensive collections of the Church Fathers that Malan obtained have now been relocated to the library of Keble College. The collection that became the Malan Library as housed in the Indian Institute in 1896, two years after Malan&#x27;s death, was probably the majority of Malan&#x27;s personal library, but clearly not all of it. There was an initial promise to maintain the library as a distinct entity &quot;in perpetuam&quot;, but later, the Malan Library was dispersed into what is now the Oriental Division of the Bodleian Libraries in 1965. There were other interests involved in redistributing the collection and making the Indian Institute available for other purposes. One of the main problems was that there weren&#x27;t enough funds to hire suitable librarians to manage and organize such a unique library.

It is now impossible to identify the actual contents of the Malan Library as it existed from 1896 to 1965, but there are at least some ways current librarians, scholars, and bibliographers have found to identify portions of that library. One way is to locate tomes, codices, and manuscripts that bear a book plate which indicates that the text originally belonged originally to Malan&#x27;s personal library. This approach to reconstructing the content of the Malan Library is fallible because not all of the computerized bibliographic notes document that they originally belonged to Malan. Another way would be to read through and identify the titles mentioned in book lists and card catalogue entries made for the Malan Library. They had been relocated by Oxford librarians around 2011 when reconstructing the Bodleian Libraries in order to make them more accessible by computers. These lists and catalogue cards do not provide a comprehensive account of the former Malan Library. There has not been a proven way to identify all the items that used to belong to the Malan Library. These three ways mentioned above have been speculated to be able to identify as much as 60% to 70% of the original collection.

Most of the items Malan donated to the Bodleian Libraries were books or codices that came from a wide variety of publishers. As much as one-fifth of the whole collection were Christian works, including samples of Bibles or Bible sections in many languages, translations of various major Christian classics, and several large sets of the writings of church fathers. Some works were already considered antiquarian texts in Malan&#x27;s own lifetime, and there are at least 17 items already identified that were published before the year 1700. Though many of the publishers who produced works were from the European continent, there were also items produced from as many as 17 different places in India (including what is now Pakistan and Bangladesh), four in Burma (now Myanmar), two in Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), and a number of others from Algiers, Beirut, China, Japan, Jerusalem and Siam (now Thailand). Malan&#x27;s donations included rare manuscripts and items in at least eleven languages as well as polyglot writings that display the breadth of Malan&#x27;s interests. There are also two major manuscripts that Malan created himself. The largest is the manuscript version of the &quot;Original Notes on the Book of Proverbs.&quot; The second largest is a volume of devotional texts written as 31 daily readings, calligraphed in red and black ink designs. Those texts are illustrated in more than 80 languages. Malan referred to it as the &quot;Sacra Privata&quot;, because it was a testimony to his Christian devotion and delight in languages that he created for himself when he had reached the age of 40.

==Malan&#x27;s hyperpolyglossia and polymath interests==
Much emphasis has been made in his son&#x27;s biography as well as in later scholarship regarding Solomon Caesar Malan&#x27;s extraordinary linguistic talents. Recent work has highlighted the high quality of his amateur sketching in pencil, pen, and watercolour. Some attention has been given to his calligraphic skills, as revealed in his &quot;Sacra Privata&quot; as well as in the manuscript version of the &quot;Original Notes on the Book of Proverbs&quot;. It has been noted that in &quot;Sacra Privata,&quot; his Manchurian script involved a good many scripted errors, but improved over time. His calligraphic presentation in Manchurian in the &quot;Sacra Privata&quot; in 1852 was almost without error. One Swiss Tibetologist noted that Malan wrote in three different styles of Tibetan, a relatively rare achievement. His Chinese calligraphy was elegant and written in Traditional Chinese characters with a controlled brush that rarely contained errors. How well he wrote in languages such as Sanskrit, Hebrew, Arabic, Burmese, Persian, and Mongolian have yet to be studied. The collections of birds&#x27; eggs held at the Royal Albert Memorial Museum show that he had an eye for natural details and a nuanced way of categorization. His attainments in bookbinding, music composition, carpentry, and architecture, of which there are important and extant examples, have not been expertly examined as of writing. 

An issue of Malan&#x27;s hyperpolyglossia has taken centre stage in recent scholarship. Malan&#x27;s studies of linguistic learning, hyperpolyglossia, and aspects of supposed autistic personality traits casts uncertainty about his social skills. A. N. Malan&#x27;s biography of his father indicates that at times, Solomon Caesar Malan was harshly dismissive of those who dared to criticize him. He was strongly opinionated, dictatorial in his relationships to those under his authority, and a perfectionist in attitude, if not in attainment. These attitudes were also reflected in Malan&#x27;s principled opposition to the promotion of Westcott and Hort&#x27;s revised Greek text of the New Testament, started in 1853 and completed in
1881. It was one of the earlier presentations of that revised Greek text that provoked Malan to write a scholarly rebuttal from the Gospel of John in 1862. Another attitude was his rejection of using transliterations of non-European languages because there were phonetic elements within them that had no equivalent in European languages. Instead, he preferred to write them out in their own script, rather than struggle with the arbitrariness of developing linguistic signs for what was unpronounceable in European languages. Later scholars have noted that neither of these two positions has become dominant in subsequent Christian or linguistic scholarly traditions. Despite these problematic attitudes, and poor personality traits, Malan was also a compassionate writer of Christian books for children and had an open-hearted attitude toward non-European expressions of Christianity. He held an appreciation of wisdom that was expressed in Asian cultural contexts that defied the narrowness of negative and dismissive attitudes. One of his teachers who taught the younger Swiss student Syriac, proclaimed, &quot;God must have made his brain of a brick form the Tower of Babel.&quot; Another, who had never known him personally, recognized from one of his translations of &quot;Eastern Christianity&quot; that he was a &quot;strange near-genius.&quot; He was an unusually gifted man who was driven not only by an insatiable linguistic desire to understand human expressions of wisdom but also by a profoundly Christian vision of reality that curtailed and redirected many of his more unpalatable autistic habits.

Historically, no other modern scholar has approached the linguistic diversity of Mezzofanti;, who was said to have come to know about fifty living languages to a relatively high degree. Solomon Caesar Malan wrote and read more than eighty languages, but one should question the relative level of comprehension he attained in them. For at least a century since his death, those who wrote about Malan believed that he, like Mezzofanti, was more of a linguist than a critic. Solomon Caesar Malan&#x27;s linguistic explorations clearly outpaced his ability to bring a thoroughly critical assessment to that which he was learning from the study of comparative wisdom sayings. His paremiology, reveals limitations in his understandings of the literary and linguistic hermeneutic contexts of ancient texts. This has now been shown in recent studies of Malan&#x27;s numerous references to the &quot;Mahābhārata,&quot; the &quot;Confucian Analects&quot; and other related classical Chinese texts, and various Chinese folk proverbs. It can be claimed that he did better with texts in languages learned from living persons, rather than those learned by his own self-study. His realization of different world views within the various Tibetan texts he studied appears to be more precise and less misjudged than those in Chinese texts. He did not always comprehend the complexities of the texts he read (especially in the case of the &quot;Mahābhārata&quot;), and sometimes he tended to internalize his understanding of certain passages or phrases in terms of his Christian theology and its concomitant worldview. This did not happen often, but it is manifest in various places within the published version of his &quot;magnum opus&quot; that make some of his English renderings of foreign language texts awkward to read. These shortcomings should not eclipse what Malan was able to understand and apply to his evaluations of translations of biblical texts in East Asian languages, as well as expressions of Eastern Christian traditions. Malan&#x27;s achievements went beyond skills of translation into areas of critical insight.

<doc id="266412" wikidata="Q1193660" url="?curid=266412" title="Cutting fluid">
<text>Cutting fluid is a type of coolant and lubricant designed specifically for metalworking processes, such as machining and stamping. There are various kinds of cutting fluids, which include oils, oil-water emulsions, pastes, gels, aerosols (mists), and air or other gases. Cutting fluids are made from petroleum distillates, animal fats, plant oils, water and air, or other raw ingredients. Depending on context and on which type of cutting fluid is being considered, it may be referred to as cutting fluid, cutting oil, cutting compound, coolant, or lubricant.

Most metalworking and machining processes can benefit from the use of cutting fluid, depending on workpiece material. Common exceptions to this are cast iron and brass, which may be machined dry (though this is not true of all brasses, and any machining of brass will likely benefit from the presence of a cutting fluid).

The properties that are sought after in a good cutting fluid are the ability to:
* Keep the workpiece at a stable temperature (critical when working to close tolerances). Very warm is acceptable, but extremely hot or alternating hot-and-cold are avoided.
* Maximize the life of the cutting tip by lubricating the working edge and reducing tip welding.
* Ensure safety for the people handling it (toxicity, bacteria, fungi) and for the environment upon disposal.
* Prevent rust on machine parts and cutters.

==Function==
=== Cooling ===
Metal cutting generates heat due to friction and energy lost deforming the material. The surrounding air has low thermal conductivity (conducts heat poorly) meaning it is a poor coolant. Ambient air cooling is sometimes adequate for light cuts and low duty cycles typical of maintenance, repair and operations (MRO) or hobbyist work. Production work requires heavy cutting over long time periods and typically produces more heat than air cooling can remove. Rather than pausing production while the tool cools, using liquid coolant removes significantly more heat more rapidly, and can also speed cutting and reduce friction and tool wear.

However, it is not just the tool which heats up but also the work surface. Excessive temperature in the tool or work surface can ruin the temper of both, soften either to the point of uselessness or failure, burn adjacent material, create unwanted thermal expansion or lead to unwanted chemical reactions such as oxidation.

=== Lubrication ===
Besides cooling, cutting fluids also aid the cutting process by lubricating the interface between the tool&#x27;s cutting edge and the chip. By preventing friction at this interface, some of the heat generation is prevented. This lubrication also helps prevent the chips from being welded onto the tool, which would interfere with subsequent cutting.

Cutting fluids may also assist in reducing cutting forces through the Rehbinder effect.

Extreme pressure additives are often added to cutting fluids to further reduce tool wear.

== Delivery methods ==

Every conceivable method of applying cutting fluid (e.g., flooding, spraying, dripping, misting, brushing) can be used, with the best choice depending on the application and the equipment available. For many metal cutting applications the ideal has long been high-pressure, high-volume pumping to force a stream of liquid (usually an oil-water emulsion) directly into the tool-chip interface, with walls around the machine to contain the splatter and a sump to catch, filter, and recirculate the fluid. This type of system is commonly employed, especially in manufacturing. It is often not a practical option for maintenance, repair and overhaul or hobbyist metal cutting, where smaller, simpler machine tools are used. Fortunately it is also not necessary in those applications, where heavy cuts, aggressive speeds and feeds, and constant, all-day cutting are not vital.

As technology continually advances, the flooding paradigm is no longer always the clear winner. It has been complemented since the 2000s by new permutations of liquid, aerosol, and gas delivery, such as minimum quantity lubrication and through-the-tool-tip cryogenic cooling (detailed below).

Through-tool coolant systems, also known as through-spindle coolant systems, are systems plumbed to deliver coolant through passages inside the spindle and through the tool, directly to the cutting interface. Many of these are also high-pressure coolant systems, in which the operating pressure can be hundreds to several thousand psi (1 to 30 MPa)—pressures comparable to those used in hydraulic circuits. High-pressure through-spindle coolant systems require rotary unions that can withstand these pressures. Drill bits and endmills tailored for this use have small holes at the lips where the coolant shoots out. Various types of gun drills also use similar arrangements.

==Types==

=== Liquids ===
There are generally three types of liquids: mineral, semi-synthetic, and synthetic. Semi-synthetic and synthetic cutting fluids represent attempts to combine the best properties of oil with the best properties of water by suspending emulsified oil in a water base. These properties include: rust inhibition, tolerance of a wide range of water hardness (maintaining pH stability around 9 to 10), ability to work with many metals, resist thermal breakdown, and environmental safety.

Water is a good conductor of heat but has drawbacks as a cutting fluid. It boils easily, promotes rusting of machine parts, and does not lubricate well. Therefore, other ingredients are necessary to create an optimal cutting fluid.

Mineral oils, which are petroleum-based, first saw use in cutting applications in the late 19th century. These vary from the thick, dark, sulfur-rich cutting oils used in heavy industry to light, clear oils.

Semi-synthetic coolants, also called &quot;soluble oil&quot;, are an emulsion or microemulsion of water with mineral oil. In workshops using British English, soluble oil is colloquially known as SUDS. These began to see use in the 1930s. A typical CNC machine tool usually uses emulsified coolant, which consists of a small amount of oil emulsified into a larger amount of water through the use of a detergent.

Synthetic coolants originated in the late 1950s and are usually water-based.

The official technique to measure oil concentration in cutting fluid samples is manual titration: 100ml of the fluid under test is titrated with a 0.5M HCl solution to an endpoint of pH 4 and the volume of titrant used to reach the endpoint is used to calculate the oil concentration. This technique is accurate and not affected by fluid contamination, but needs to be performed by trained personnel in a laboratory environment. A hand-held refractometer is the industrial standard used to determine the mix ratio of water-soluble coolants that estimates oil concentration from the sample refractive index measured in the Brix scale. The refractometer allows for in situ measurements of oil concentration within industrial plants. However, contamination of the sample reduces the accuracy of the measure. Other techniques are used to measure the oil concentration in cutting fluids, such as measure of the fluid viscosity, density, and ultrasound speed. Other test equipment is used to determine such properties as acidity and conductivity.

Others include:
* Kerosene and rubbing alcohol often give good results when working on aluminum.
* WD-40 and 3-In-One Oil work well on various metals. The latter has a citronella odor; if the odor offends, mineral oil and general-purpose lubricating oils work about the same.
* Way oil (the oil made for machine tool ways) works as a cutting oil. In fact, some screw machines are designed to use one oil as both the way oil and cutting oil. (Most machine tools treat way lube and coolant as separate things that inevitably mix during use, which leads to tramp oil skimmers being used to separate them back out.)
* Motor oils have a slightly complicated relationship to machine tools. Straight-weight non-detergent motor oils are usable, and in fact SAE 10 and 20 oils used to be the recommended spindle and way oils (respectively) on manual machine tools decades ago, although nowadays dedicated way oil formulas prevail in commercial machining. While nearly all motor oils can act as adequate cutting fluids in terms of their cutting performance alone, modern multi-weight motor oils with detergents and other additives are best avoided. These additives can present a copper-corrosion concern to brass and bronze, which machine tools often have in their bearings and leadscrew nuts (especially older or manual machine tools).
* Dielectric fluid is used as a cutting fluid in electrical discharge machines (EDMs). It is usually deionized water or a high-flash-point kerosene. Intense heat is generated by the cutting action of the electrode (or wire) and the fluid is used to stabilize the temperature of the workpiece, along with flushing any eroded particles from the immediate work area. The dielectric fluid is non-conductive.
* Liquid (water or petroleum oil) cooled water tables are used with the plasma arc cutting (PAC) process.
* Neatsfoot oil of the highest grade is used as a lubricant. It is used in metalworking industries as a cutting fluid for aluminum. For machining, tapping and drilling aluminum, it is superior to kerosene and various water-based cutting fluids.

=== Pastes or gels ===
Cutting fluid may also take the form of a paste or gel when used for some applications, in particular hand operations such as drilling and tapping. In sawing metal with a bandsaw, it is common to periodically run a stick of paste against the blade. This product is similar in form factor to lipstick or beeswax. It comes in a cardboard tube, which gets slowly consumed with each application.

=== Aerosols (mists) ===
Some cutting fluids are used in aerosol (mist) form (air with tiny droplets of liquid scattered throughout). The main problems with mists have been that they are rather bad for the workers, who have to breathe the surrounding mist-tainted air, and that they sometimes don&#x27;t even work very well. Both of those problems come from the imprecise delivery that often puts the mist everywhere and all the time except at the cutting interface, during the cut—the one place and time where it&#x27;s wanted. However, a newer form of aerosol delivery, (minimum quantity of lubricant), avoids both of those problems. The delivery of the aerosol is directly through the flutes of the tool (it arrives directly through or around the insert itself—an ideal type of cutting fluid delivery that traditionally has been unavailable outside of a few contexts such as gun drilling or expensive, state-of-the-art liquid delivery in production milling). MQL&#x27;s aerosol is delivered in such a precisely targeted way (with respect to both location and timing) that the net effect seems almost like dry machining from the operators&#x27; perspective. The chips generally seem like dry-machined chips, requiring no draining, and the air is so clean that machining cells can be stationed closer to inspection and assembly than before. MQL doesn&#x27;t provide much cooling in the sense of heat transfer, but its well-targeted lubricating action prevents some of the heat from being generated in the first place, which helps to explain its success.

=== Carbon dioxide ===
Carbon dioxide (chemical formula CO2) is also used as a coolant. In this application pressurized liquid CO2 is allowed to expand and this is accompanied by a drop in temperature, enough to cause a change of phase into a solid. These solid crystals are redirected into the cut zone by either external nozzles or through-the-spindle delivery, to provide temperature controlled cooling of the cutting tool and work piece.

=== Air or other gases (e.g., nitrogen) ===
Ambient air, of course, was the original machining coolant. Compressed air, supplied through pipes and hoses from an air compressor and discharged from a nozzle aimed at the tool, is sometimes a useful coolant. The force of the decompressing air stream blows chips away, and the decompression itself has a slight degree of cooling action. The net result is that the heat of the machining cut is carried away a bit better than by ambient air alone. Sometimes liquids are added to the air stream to form a mist (mist coolant systems, described above).

Liquid nitrogen, supplied in pressurized steel bottles, is sometimes used in similar fashion. In this case, boiling is enough to provide a powerful refrigerating effect. For years this has been done (in limited applications) by flooding the work zone. Since 2005, this mode of coolant has been applied in a manner comparable to MQL (with through-the-spindle and through-the-tool-tip delivery). This refrigerates the body and tips of the tool to such a degree that it acts as a &quot;thermal sponge&quot;, sucking up the heat from the tool–chip interface. This new type of nitrogen cooling is still under patent. Tool life has been increased by a factor of 10 in the milling of tough metals such as titanium and inconel.

Alternatively, using airflow combined with a quick evaporating substance (ex. alcohol, water etc.) can be used as an effective coolant when handling hot pieces that cannot be cooled by alternate methods.

=== Past practice ===
* In 19th-century machining practice, it was not uncommon to use plain water. This was simply a practical expedient to keep the cutter cool, regardless of whether it provided any lubrication at the cutting edge–chip interface. When one considers that high-speed steel (HSS) had not been developed yet, the need to cool the tool becomes all the more apparent. (HSS retains its hardness at high temperatures; other carbon tool steels do not.) An improvement was soda water (sodium bicarbonate in water), which better inhibited the rusting of machine slides. These options are generally not used today because more effective alternatives are available.
* Animal fats such as tallow or lard were very popular in the past. These are used infrequently today, because of the wide variety of other choices, but remain as an option.
* Old machine shop training texts speak of using red lead and white lead, often mixed into lard or lard oil. This practice is obsolete due to the toxicity of lead.
* From the mid-20th century to the 1990s, 1,1,1-trichloroethane was used as an additive to make some cutting fluids more effective. In shop-floor slang it was referred to as &quot;one-one-one&quot;. It has been phased out because of its ozone-depleting and central nervous system-depressing properties.

==Safety concerns==
Cutting fluids present some mechanisms for causing illness or injury in workers. Occupational exposure is associated with increases in cardiovascular disease. These mechanisms are based on the external (skin) or internal contact involved in machining work, including touching the parts and tooling; being splattered or splashed by the fluid; or having mist settle on the skin or enter the mouth and nose in the normal course of breathing.

The mechanisms include the chemical toxicity or physical irritating ability of:
* the fluid itself
* the metal particles (from previous cutting) that are borne in the fluid
* the bacterial or fungal populations that naturally tend to grow in the fluid over time
* the biocides that are added to inhibit those life forms
* the corrosion inhibitors that are added to protect the machine and tooling
* the tramp oils that result from the way oils (the lubricants for the slideways) inevitably finding their way into the coolant

The toxicity or irritating ability is usually not high, but it is sometimes enough to cause problems for the skin or for the tissues of the respiratory tract or alimentary tract (e.g., the mouth, larynx, esophagus, trachea, or lungs).

Some of the diagnoses that can result from the mechanisms explained above include irritant contact dermatitis; allergic contact dermatitis; occupational acne; tracheitis; esophagitis; bronchitis; asthma; allergy; hypersensitivity pneumonitis (HP); and worsening of pre-existing respiratory problems.

Safer cutting fluid formulations provide a resistance to tramp oils, allowing improved filtration separation without removing the base additive package. Room ventilation, splash guards on machines, and personal protective equipment (PPE) (such as safety glasses, respirator masks, and gloves) can mitigate hazards related to cutting fluids. Additionally, Skimmers may be used to remove tramp oil from the surface of cutting fluid, which prevents the growth of micro-organisms.

Bacterial growth is predominant in petroleum-based cutting fluids. Tramp oil along with human hair or skin oil are some of the debris during cutting which accumulates and forms a layer on the top of the liquid; anaerobic bacteria proliferate due to a number of factors. An early sign of the need for replacement is the &quot;Monday-morning smell&quot; (due to lack of usage from Friday to Monday). Antiseptics are sometimes added to the fluid to kill bacteria. Such use must be balanced against whether the antiseptics will harm the cutting performance, workers&#x27; health, or the environment. Maintaining as low a fluid temperature as practical will slow the growth of microorganisms. Some health and safety regulators (such as the HSE in the United Kingdom) require weekly testing of metal working fluids to help maintain the fluid&#x27;s health. These tests involve checking the bacterial CFU/ml Level of the MWF (using Dipslides) and the pH level by using either a pH meter or pH test strips (since a low pH can be caused by a high bacterial level).

==Degradation, replacement, and disposal==

Cutting fluids degrade over time due to contaminants entering the lubrication system. A common type of degradation is the formation of &quot;tramp oil&quot;, also known as &quot;sump oil&quot;, which is unwanted oil that has mixed with cutting fluid. It originates as lubrication oil that seeps out from the slideways and washes into the coolant mixture, as the protective film with which a steel supplier coats bar stock to prevent rusting, or as hydraulic oil leaks. In extreme cases it can be seen as a film or skin on the surface of the coolant or as floating drops of oil.

Skimmers are used to separate the tramp oil from the coolant. These are typically slowly rotating vertical discs that are partially submerged below the coolant level in the main reservoir. As the disc rotates the tramp oil clings to each side of the disc to be scraped off by two wipers, before the disc passes back through the coolant. The wipers are in the form of a channel that then redirects the tramp oil to a container where it is collected for disposal. Floating weir skimmers are also used in these situations where temperature or the amount of oil on the water becomes excessive.

Since the introduction of CNC additives, the tramp oil in these systems can be managed more effectively through a continuous separation effect. The tramp oil accumulation separates from the aqueous or oil based coolant and can be easily removed with an absorbent.

Old, used cutting fluid must be disposed of when it is fetid or chemically degraded and has lost its usefulness. As with used motor oil or other wastes, its impact on the environment should be mitigated. Legislation and regulation specify how this mitigation should be achieved. Modern cutting fluid disposal involves techniques such as ultrafiltration using polymeric or ceramic membranes which concentrates the suspended and emulsified oil phase.

Chip handling and coolant management are interrelated. Over the decades they have been improved, to the point that many metalworking operations now use engineered solutions for the overall cycle of collecting, separating, and recycling both chips and coolant. For example, the chips are graded by size and type, tramp metals (such as bolts and scrap parts) are separated out, the coolant is centrifuged off the chips (which are then dried for further handling), and so on.
