<text>Alejandro Jodorowsky Prullansky (; born 17 February 1929) is a Chilean and French avant-garde filmmaker. Best known for his films &quot;El Topo&quot; (1970), &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; (1973) and &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; (1989), Jodorowsky has been &quot;venerated by cult cinema enthusiasts&quot; for his work which &quot;is filled with violently surreal images and a hybrid blend of mysticism and religious provocation&quot;.

Born to Jewish-Ukrainian parents in Chile, Jodorowsky experienced an unhappy and alienated childhood, and so immersed himself in reading and writing poetry. Dropping out of college, he became involved in theater and in particular mime, working as a clown before founding his own theater troupe, the &quot;Teatro Mimico&quot;, in 1947. Moving to Paris in the early 1950s, Jodorowsky studied traditional mime under Étienne Decroux, and put his miming skills to use in the silent film &quot;Les têtes interverties&quot; (1957), directed with Saul Gilbert and Ruth Michelly. From 1960 onwards he divided his time between Mexico City and Paris, where he co-founded Panic Movement, a surrealist performance art collective that staged violent and shocking theatrical events. In 1966 he created his first comic strip, &quot;Anibal 5&quot;, and in 1967 he directed his first feature film, the surrealist &quot;Fando y Lis&quot;, which caused a huge scandal in Mexico, eventually being banned.

His next film, the acid western &quot;El Topo&quot; (1970), became a hit on the midnight movie circuit in the United States, considered the first-ever midnight cult film, and garnered high praise from John Lennon, who convinced former Beatles manager Allen Klein to provide Jodorowsky with $1 million to finance his next film. The result was &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; (1973), a surrealist exploration of western esotericism. Disagreements with Klein, however, led to both &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; and &quot;El Topo&quot; failing to gain widespread distribution, although both became classics on the underground film circuit. After a cancelled attempt at filming Frank Herbert&#x27;s 1965 science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot;, Jodorowsky produced five more films: the family film &quot;Tusk&quot; (1980); the surrealist horror &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; (1989); the failed blockbuster &quot;The Rainbow Thief&quot; (1990); and the first two films in a planned five-film autobiographical series &quot;The Dance of Reality&quot; (2013) and &quot;Endless Poetry&quot; (2016).

Jodorowsky is also a comic book writer, most notably penning the science fiction series &quot;The Incal&quot; throughout the 1980s, which has been described as having a claim to be &quot;the best comic book&quot; ever written. Other comic books he has written include &quot;The Technopriests&quot; and &quot;Metabarons&quot;. Jodorowsky has also extensively written and lectured about his own spiritual system, which he calls &quot;psychomagic&quot; and &quot;psychoshamanism&quot;, which borrows from alchemy, the tarot, Zen Buddhism and shamanism. His son Cristóbal has followed his teachings on psychoshamanism; this work is captured in the feature documentary &quot;Quantum Men&quot;, directed by Carlos Serrano Azcona.

==Early life and education==
Jodorowsky was born in 1929 in the coastal town of Tocopilla, Chile, to parents who were Jewish immigrants from Yekaterinoslav (now Dnipro), Elisavetgrad (now Kropyvnytskyi) and other cities then in the Russian Empire (and now in Ukraine). His father, Jaime Jodorowsky Groismann, was a merchant, who was largely abusive to his wife Sara Felicidad Prullansky Arcavi, and at one time accused her of flirting with a customer. Angered, he subsequently beat and raped her, getting her pregnant, which led to the birth of Alejandro. Because of this brutal conception, Sara both hated her husband and disliked her son, telling him that &quot;I cannot love you&quot; and rarely showing him tenderness. Alejandro also had an elder sister, Raquel Jodorowsky, but disliked her, for he believed that she was selfish, doing &quot;everything to expel me from the family so that she could be the centre of attention.&quot; Alongside his dislike for his family, he also held contempt for many of the local people, who viewed him as an outsider because of his status as the son of immigrants, and also for the American mining industrialists who worked locally and treated the Chilean people badly. It was this treatment at the hands of Americans that led to his later condemnation of American imperialism and neo-colonialism in Latin America in several of his films. Nonetheless, he liked his local area and was greatly unhappy when he was forced to leave it at the age of nine years old, something for which he blamed his father. His family subsequently moved to the city of Santiago, Chile.

He immersed himself in reading, and also began writing poetry, having his first poem published when he was sixteen years old, alongside associating with such Chilean poets as Nicanor Parra, Stella Díaz Varín and Enrique Lihn. Becoming interested in the political ideology of anarchism, he began attending college, studying psychology and philosophy, but stayed for only two years. After dropping out, and having an interest in theatre and particularly mime, he took up employment as a clown in a circus and began a career as a theatre director. Meanwhile, in 1947 he founded his own theatrical troupe, the Teatro Mimico, which by 1952 had fifty members, and the following year he wrote his first play, &quot;El Minotaura&quot; (&quot;The Minotaur&quot;). Nonetheless, Jodorowsky felt that there was little for him left in Chile, and so that year he moved to Paris.

It was while in Paris that Jodorowsky began studying mime with Étienne Decroux and joined the troupe of one of Decroux&#x27;s students, Marcel Marceau. It was with Marceau&#x27;s troupe that he went on a world tour, and wrote several routines for the group, including &quot;The Cage&quot; and &quot;The Mask Maker&quot;. After this, he returned to theatre directing, working on the music hall comeback of Maurice Chevalier in Paris. In 1957, Jodorowsky turned his hand to filmmaking, creating &quot;Les têtes interverties&quot; (&quot;The Severed Heads&quot;), a 20-minute adaptation of Thomas Mann&#x27;s novella. It consisted almost entirely of mime and told the surreal story of a head-swapping merchant who helps a young man find courtship success. Jodorowsky played the lead role. The director Jean Cocteau admired the film and wrote an introduction for it. It was considered lost until a print of the film was discovered in 2006.

In 1960, Jodorowsky moved to Mexico, where he settled down in Mexico City. Nonetheless, he continued to return occasionally to France, on one occasion visiting the Surrealist artist André Breton, but he was disillusioned in that he felt Breton had become somewhat conservative in his old age. Continuing his interest in surrealism, in 1962 he founded the Panic Movement along with Fernando Arrabal and Roland Topor. The movement aimed to go beyond conventional surrealist ideas by embracing absurdism. Its members refused to take themselves seriously, while laughing at those critics who did. In 1966, he produced his first comic strip, &quot;Anibal 5&quot;, which was related to the Panic Movement. The following year he created a new feature film, &quot;Fando y Lis&quot;, loosely based on a play written by Fernando Arrabal, who was working with Jodorowsky on performance art at the time. &quot;Fando y Lis&quot; premiered at the 1968 Acapulco Film Festival, where it instigated a riot amongst those objecting to the film&#x27;s content, and subsequently it was banned in Mexico.

It was in Mexico City that he encountered Ejo Takata (1928–1997), a Zen Buddhist monk who had studied at the Horyuji and Shofukuji monasteries in Japan before traveling to Mexico via the United States in 1967 to spread Zen. Jodorowsky became a disciple of Takata and offered his own house to be turned into a zendo. Subsequently, Takata attracted other disciples around him, who spent their time in meditation and the study of koans. Eventually, Takata instructed Jodorowsky that he had to learn more about his feminine side, and so he went and befriended the English surrealist Leonora Carrington, who had recently moved to Mexico.

==Career==
===&quot;El Topo&quot; and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; (1970–1974)===
In 1970, Jodorowsky released the film &quot;El Topo&quot;, which sometimes is known in English as &quot;The Mole&quot;, which he had both directed and starred in. An acid western, &quot;El Topo&quot; tells the story of a wandering Mexican bandit and gunslinger, El Topo (played by Jodorowsky), who is on a search for spiritual enlightenment, taking his young son along with him. Along the way, he violently confronts a number of other individuals, before finally being killed and being resurrected to live within a community of deformed people who are trapped inside a mountain cave. Describing the work, he stated that &quot;I ask of film what most North Americans ask of psychedelic drugs. The difference being that when one creates a psychedelic film, he need not create a film that shows the visions of a person who has taken a pill; rather, he needs to manufacture the pill.&quot; Knowing how &quot;Fando y Lis&quot; had caused such a scandal in Mexico, Jodorowsky decided not to release &quot;El Topo&quot; there, instead focusing on its release in other countries across the world, including Mexico&#x27;s northern neighbour, the United States. It was in New York City where the film would play as a &quot;midnight movie&quot; for several months at Ben Barenholtz&#x27;s Elgin Theater. It attracted the attention of rock musician and countercultural figure John Lennon, who thought very highly of it, and convinced the president of The Beatles&#x27; company Apple Corps, Allen Klein, to distribute it in the United States.

Klein agreed to give Jodorowsky $1 million to go toward creating his next film. The result was &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, released in 1973. It has been suggested that &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; may have been inspired by René Daumal&#x27;s Surrealist novel &quot;Mount Analogue&quot;. &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; was another complex, multi-part story that featured a man credited as &quot;The Thief&quot; and equated with Jesus Christ, a mystical alchemist played by Jodorowsky, seven powerful business people representing seven of the planets (Venus and the six planets from Mars to Pluto), a religious training regimen of spiritual rebirth, and a quest to the top of a holy mountain for the secret of immortality. During the completion of &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, Jodorowsky received spiritual training from Oscar Ichazo of the Arica School, who encouraged him to take LSD and guided him through the subsequent psychedelic experience. Around the same time (2 November 1973), Jodorowsky participated in an isolation tank experiment conducted by John Lilly.

Shortly thereafter, Allen Klein demanded that Jodorowsky create a film adaptation of Pauline Réage&#x27;s classic novel of female masochism, &quot;Story of O&quot;. Klein had promised this adaptation to various investors. Jodorowsky, who had discovered feminism during the filming of &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, refused to make the film, going so far as to leave the country to escape directing duties. In retaliation, Allen Klein made &quot;El Topo&quot; and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, to which he held the rights, completely unavailable to the public for more than 30 years. Jodorowsky frequently decried Klein&#x27;s actions in interviews.

Soon after the release of &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, Jodorowsky gave a talk at the Teatro Julio Castillo, University of Mexico on the subject of koans (despite the fact that he initially had been booked on the condition that his talk would be about cinematography), at which Ejo Takata appeared. After the talk, Takata gave Jodorowsky his kyosaku, believing that his former student had mastered the art of understanding koans.

===&quot;Dune&quot; and &quot;Tusk&quot; (1975–1980)===
In December 1974, a French consortium led by Jean-Paul Gibon purchased the film rights to Frank Herbert&#x27;s epic 1965 science fiction novel &quot;Dune&quot; and asked Jodorowsky to direct a film version. Jodorowsky planned to cast the Surrealist artist Salvador Dalí, in what would have been his only speaking role as a film actor, in the role of Emperor Shaddam IV. Dalí agreed when Jodorowsky offered to pay him a fee of $100,000 per hour. He also planned to cast Orson Welles as Baron Vladimir Harkonnen; Welles only agreed when Jodorowsky offered to get his favourite gourmet chef to prepare his meals for him throughout the filming. The book&#x27;s protagonist, Paul Atreides, was to be played by Jodorowsky&#x27;s son, Brontis Jodorowsky, 12 years old at the start of pre-production. The music would be composed by Pink Floyd and Magma. Jodorowsky set up a pre-production unit in Paris consisting of Chris Foss, a British artist who designed covers for science fiction publications, Jean Giraud (Mœbius), a French illustrator who created and also wrote and drew for &quot;Métal Hurlant&quot; magazine, and H. R. Giger. Frank Herbert travelled to Europe in 1976 to find that $2 million of the $9.5 million budget had already been spent in pre-production, and that Jodorowsky&#x27;s script would result in a 14-hour movie (&quot;It was the size of a phonebook&quot;, Herbert later recalled). Jodorowsky took creative liberties with the source material, but Herbert said that he and Jodorowsky had an amicable relationship. The production for the film collapsed when no film studio could be found willing to fund the movie to Jodorowsky&#x27;s terms. The aborted production was chronicled in the documentary &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot;, directed by Frank Pavich. Subsequently, the rights for filming were sold to Dino De Laurentiis, who employed the American filmmaker David Lynch to direct, creating the film &quot;Dune&quot; in 1984. The documentary does not include any original film footage of what was to be &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot; though it states that the unmade film was an influence on other science fiction films, such as &quot;Star Wars&quot;, &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Flash Gordon&quot; and &quot;Raiders of the Lost Ark&quot;. In particular, the Jodorowsky-assembled team of O&#x27;Bannon, Foss, Giger, and Giraud went on to collaborate on the 1979 film &quot;Alien&quot;. Later, in January 2023, Frank Pavich, director of the documentary film &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot;, published an essay in &quot;The New York Times&quot; related to &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot; (and more) that involved artwork generated by generative AI.

After the collapse of the &quot;Dune&quot; project, Jodorowsky completely changed course and, in 1980, premiered his children&#x27;s fable &quot;Tusk&quot;, shot in India. Taken from Reginald Campbell&#x27;s novel &quot;Poo Lorn of the Elephants&quot;, the film explores the soul-mate relationship between a young British woman living in India and a highly prized elephant. The film exhibited little of the director&#x27;s outlandish visual style and was never given wide release.

===&quot;Santa Sangre&quot; and &quot;The Rainbow Thief&quot; (1981–1990)===

In 1989, Jodorowsky completed the Mexican-Italian production &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; (&quot;Holy Blood&quot;). The film received limited theatrical distribution, putting Jodorowsky back on the cultural map despite its mixed critical reviews. &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; was a surrealistic slasher film with a plot like a mix of Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Psycho&quot; with Robert Wiene&#x27;s &quot;The Hands of Orlac&quot;. It featured a protagonist who, as a child, saw his mother lose both her arms, and as an adult let his own arms act as hers, and so was forced to commit murders at her whim. Several of Jodorowsky&#x27;s sons were recruited as actors.

He followed in 1990 with a very different film, &quot;The Rainbow Thief&quot;. Though it gave Jodorowsky a chance to work with the &quot;movie stars&quot; Peter O&#x27;Toole and Omar Sharif, the executive producer, Alexander Salkind, effectively curtailed most of Jodorowsky&#x27;s artistic inclinations, threatening to fire him on the spot if anything in the script was changed (Salkind&#x27;s wife, Berta Domínguez D., wrote the screenplay).

That same year (1990), Jodorowsky and his family returned to France to live.

===Attempts to return to filmmaking (1990–2011)===
In 2000, Jodorowsky won the Jack Smith Lifetime Achievement Award from the Chicago Underground Film Festival (CUFF). Jodorowsky attended the festival and his films were shown, including &quot;El Topo&quot; and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, which at the time had grey legal status. According to festival director Bryan Wendorf, it was an open question of whether CUFF would be allowed to show both films, or whether the police would show up and shut the festival down.

Until 2007, &quot;Fando y Lis&quot; and &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; were the only Jodorowsky works available on DVD. Neither &quot;El Topo&quot; nor &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; were available on videocassette or DVD in the United States or the United Kingdom, due to ownership disputes with distributor Allen Klein. After settlement of the dispute in 2004, however, plans to re-release Jodorowsky&#x27;s films were announced by ABKCO Films. On 19 January 2007, it was announced online that Anchor Bay would release a box set including &quot;El Topo&quot;, &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, and &quot;Fando y Lis&quot; on 1 May 2007. A limited edition of the set includes both the &quot;El Topo&quot; and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; soundtracks. And, in early February 2007, Tartan Video announced its 14 May 2007, release date for the UK &quot;PAL DVD&quot; editions of &quot;El Topo&quot;, &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;, and the six-disc box set which, alongside the aforementioned feature films, includes the two soundtrack CDs, as well as separate DVD editions of Jodorowsky&#x27;s 1968 debut feature &quot;Fando y Lis&quot; (with his 1957 short &quot;La cravate&quot; a.k.a. &quot;Les têtes interverties&quot;, included as an extra) and the 1994 feature-length documentary &quot;La constellation Jodorowsky&quot;. Notably, &quot;Fando y Lis&quot; and &quot;La cravate&quot; were digitally restored extensively and remastered in London during late 2006, thus providing a suitable complement to the quality restoration work undertaken on &quot;El Topo&quot; and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; in the States by ABKCO, and ensuring that the presentation of &quot;Fando y Lis&quot; is a significant improvement over the 2001 Fantoma DVD edition. Prior to the availability of these legitimate releases, only inferior quality, optically censored, bootleg copies of both &quot;El Topo&quot; and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; have been circulated on the Internet and on DVD.

In the 1990s and early 2000s, Jodorowsky attempted to make a sequel to &quot;El Topo&quot;, called at different times &quot;The Sons of El Topo&quot; and &quot;Abel Cain&quot;, but did not find investors for the project.

In an interview with &quot;Première&quot;, Jodorowsky said he intended his next project to be a gangster film called &quot;King Shot&quot;. In an interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot; newspaper in November 2009, however, Jodorowsky revealed that he was unable to find the funds to make &quot;King Shot&quot;, and instead would be entering preparations on &quot;Sons of El Topo&quot;, for which he claimed to have signed a contract with &quot;some Russian producers&quot;.

In 2010, the Museum of Arts and Design in New York City staged the first American cinema retrospective of Alejandro Jodorowsky entitled &quot;Blood into Gold: The Cinematic Alchemy of Alejandro Jodorowsky&quot;. Jodorowsky would attend the retrospective and hold a master class on art as a way of transformation. This retrospective would inspire the museum MoMA PS1 to present the exhibition &quot;Alejandro Jodorowsky: The Holy Mountain&quot; in 2011.

===&quot;The Dance of Reality&quot; and &quot;Endless Poetry&quot; (2011–present)===
In August 2011, Alejandro arrived in a town in Chile where he grew up, also the setting of his autobiography &quot;The Dance of Reality&quot;, to promote an autobiographical film based upon his book.

On 31 October 2011, Halloween night, the Museum of Modern Art (New York City) honored Jodorowsky by showing &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot;. He attended and spoke about his work and life. The next evening, he presented &quot;El Topo&quot; at the Walter Reade Theatre at Lincoln Center.

Alejandro has stated that after finishing &quot;The Dance of Reality&quot; he was preparing to shoot his long-gestating &quot;El Topo&quot; sequel, &quot;Abel Cain&quot;. By January 2013, Alejandro finished filming on &quot;The Dance of Reality&quot; and entered into post-production. Alejandro&#x27;s son and co-star in the film, Brontis, claimed the film was to be finished by March 2013, and that the film was &quot;very different than the other films he made&quot;. On 23 April, it was announced that the film would have its world premiere at the Film Festival in Cannes. coinciding with &quot;The Dance of Reality&quot; premiered alongside the documentary film &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot;, which premiered in May 2013 at the Cannes Film Festival, creating a &quot;Jodorowsky double bill&quot;.

In 2015, Jodorowsky began a new film entitled &quot;Endless Poetry&quot;, the sequel to his last &quot;auto-biopic&quot;, &quot;The Dance of Reality&quot;. His Paris-based production company, Satori Films, launched two successful crowdfunding campaigns to finance the film. The Indiegogo campaign has been left open indefinitely, receiving donations from fans and movie-goers in support of the independent production. The film was shot between June and August 2015, in the streets of Matucana in Santiago, Chile, where Jodorowsky lived for a period in his life. The film portrays his young adulthood in Santiago, years during which he became a core member of the Chilean poetic avant-garde alongside artists such as Hugo Marín, Gustavo Becerra, Enrique Lihn, Stella Díaz Varín, Nicanor Parra and others. Jodorowsky&#x27;s son Adan Jodorowsky plays him as an adult; and Brontis Jodorowsky plays as his father, Jaime. Jeremias Herskovitz, from &quot;The Dance of Reality&quot;, portrays Jodorowsky as a teenager. Pamela Flores plays as Sara (his mother) and Stella Díaz Varín (poet and young Jodorowsky&#x27;s girlfriend). Leandro Taub portrays Jodorowsky&#x27;s best friend, the poet and novelist Enrique Lihn. The film premiered in the Directors&#x27; Fortnight section of the Cannes Film Festival on 14 May 2016. Variety&#x27;s review was overwhelmingly positive, calling it &quot;...the most accessible movie he has ever made, and it may also be the best.&quot;

During an interview at the Cannes Film Festival in 2016, Jodorowsky announced his plans to finally make &quot;The Son of El Topo&quot; as soon as financial backing is obtained.

==Other work==
Jodorowsky released a 12&quot; vinyl with the Original Soundtrack of Zarathustra (Discos Tizoc, Mexico, 1970).

===Comics===
Jodorowsky started his comic career in Mexico with the creation of &quot;Anibal 5&quot; series in mid-1966 with illustrations by Manuel Moro. He also drew his own comic strip in the weekly series &quot;Fabulas pánicas&quot; that appeared in the Mexican newspaper, &quot;El Heraldo de México&quot;. He also wrote original stories for at least two or three other comic books in Mexico during those days: &quot;Los insoportables Borbolla&quot; was one of them. After his fourth film, &quot;Tusk&quot;, he started &quot;The Incal&quot;, with Jean Giraud (Mœbius). This graphic novel has its roots deep in the tarot and its symbols, e.g., the protagonist of &quot;The Incal&quot;, John Difool, is linked to the Fool card. &quot;The Incal&quot; (which would branch off into a prequel and sequel) forms the first in a sequence of several science fiction comic book series, all set in the same space opera Jodoverse (or &quot;Metabarons Universe&quot;) published by Humanoids Publishing.

Comic books set in this milieu are Incal (trilogy: &quot;Before the Incal / Incal / Final Incal&quot;), Metabarons (trilogy: &quot;Castaka / The Caste of the Metabarons / Weapons of the Metabaron&quot;), and &quot;The Technopriests&quot; and also an RPG adaptation, &quot;The Metabarons Roleplaying Game&quot;. Many ideas and concepts derived from Jodorowsky&#x27;s planned adaptation of &quot;Dune&quot; (which he would have loosely based upon Frank Herbert&#x27;s original novel) are featured in this universe.

Mœbius and Jodorowsky sued Luc Besson, director of &quot;The Fifth Element&quot;, claiming that the 1997 film borrowed graphic and story elements from &quot;The Incal&quot;, but they lost their case. The suit was plagued by ambiguity since Mœbius had willingly participated in the creation of the film, having been hired by Besson as a contributing artist, but had done so without gaining the approval of &quot;Incal&quot; co-creator Jodorowsky, whose services Besson did not call upon. For more than a decade, Jodorowsky pressured his publisher Les Humanoïdes Associés to sue Luc Besson for plagiarism, but the publisher refused, fearing the inevitability of the outcome. In a 2002 interview with the Danish comic book magazine &quot;Strip!&quot;, Jodorowsky stated that he considered it an honour that somebody stole his ideas.

Other comics by Jodorowsky include the Western &quot;Bouncer&quot; illustrated by Francois Boucq, &quot;Juan Solo&quot; (&quot;Son of the Gun&quot;), and &quot;Le Lama blanc&quot; (&quot;The White Lama&quot;), the latter were illustrated by Georges Bess.

&quot;Le Cœur couronné&quot; (&quot;The Crowned Heart&quot;, translated into English as &quot;The Madwoman of the Sacred Heart&quot;), a racy satire on religion set in contemporary times, won Jodorowsky and his collaborator, Jean Giraud, the 2001 Haxtur Award for Best Long Strip. He is currently working on a new graphic novel for the U.S. market.

Jodorowsky&#x27;s comic book work also appears in &quot;Taboo&quot; volume 4 (ed. Stephen R. Bissette), which features an interview with the director, designs for his version of Frank Herbert&#x27;s &quot;Dune&quot;, comic storyboards for &quot;El Topo&quot;, and a collaboration with Moebius with the illustrated &quot;Eyes of the Cat&quot;.

Jodorowsky collaborated with Milo Manara in &quot;Borgia&quot; (2006), a graphic novel about the history of the House of Borgia.

===Psychomagic===

Jodorowsky spent almost a decade reconstructing the original form of the Tarot de Marseille. From this work he moved into more therapeutic work in three areas: psychomagic, psychogenealogy and initiatic massage. Psychomagic aims to heal psychological wounds suffered in life. This therapy is based on the belief that the performance of certain acts can directly act upon the unconscious mind, releasing it from a series of traumas, some of which practitioners of the therapy believe are passed down from generation to generation. Psychogenealogy includes the studying of the patient&#x27;s personality and family tree in order to best address their specific sources. It is similar, in its phenomenological approach to genealogy, to the Constellations pioneered by Bert Hellinger.

Jodorowsky has several books on his therapeutic methods, including &quot;Psicomagia: La trampa sagrada&quot; (&quot;Psychomagic: The Sacred Trap&quot;) and his autobiography, &quot;La danza de la realidad&quot; (&quot;The Dance of Reality&quot;), which he was filming as a feature-length film in March 2012. To date, he has published more than 23 novels and philosophical treatises, along with dozens of articles and interviews. His books are widely read in Spanish and French, but are for the most part unknown to English-speaking audiences.

For a quarter of a century, Jodorowsky held classes and lectures for free, in cafés and universities all over the city of Paris. Typically, such courses or talks would begin on Wednesday evenings as tarot divination lessons, and would culminate in an hour-long conference, also free, where at times hundreds of attendees would be treated to live demonstrations of a psychological &quot;arbre généalogique&quot; (&quot;tree of genealogy&quot;) involving volunteers from the audience. In these conferences, Jodorowsky would pave the way to building a strong base of students of his philosophy, which deals with understanding the unconscious as the &quot;over-self&quot;, composed of many generations of family relatives, living or deceased, acting on the psyche, well into adult lives, and causing compulsions. Of all his work, Jodorowsky considers these activities to be the most important of his life. Though such activities only take place in the insular world of Parisian cafés, he has devoted thousands of hours of his life to teaching and helping people &quot;become more conscious,&quot; as he puts it.

Since 2011 these talks have dwindled to once a month and take place at the Librairie Les Cent Ciels in Paris.

His film &quot;Psychomagic, a Healing Art&quot; premiered in Lyon on 3 September 2019. It was then released on streaming services on 1 August 2020.

==Influences and impact==

He has cited the filmmaker Federico Fellini as his primary cinematic influence; other artistic influences included Jean-Luc Godard, Sergio Leone, Erich von Stroheim, Buster Keaton, George Gurdjieff, Antonin Artaud, and Luis Buñuel. He has been described as an influence on such figures as Marilyn Manson, David Lynch, Darren Aronofsky, Taika Waititi, Guillermo del Toro, Nicolas Winding Refn, Jan Kounen, Dennis Hopper, Eric Andre, the musical duo Suicide, and Kanye West.

Fans included musicians Peter Gabriel, Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodríguez-López of The Mars Volta, Brann Dailor of Mastodon, Luke Steele and Nick Littlemore (of the pop-duo Empire of the Sun). Wes Borland, guitarist of Limp Bizkit, said that the film &quot;Holy Mountain&quot; was a big influence on him, especially as a visual artist, and that the concept album &quot;Lotus Island&quot; of his band Black Light Burns was a tribute to it. Lady Gaga was influenced by Jodorowsky and &quot;The Holy Mountain&quot; in the video for her song 911.

Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn thanks Alejandro Jodorowsky in the ending titles of his 2011 film &quot;Drive,&quot; and dedicated his 2013 Thai crime thriller, &quot;Only God Forgives&quot;, to Jodorowsky. Jodorowsky also appeared in the documentary &quot;My Life Directed by Nicolas Winding Refn&quot;, directed by Refn&#x27;s wife Liv, giving the couple a tarot reading.

Jodorowsky has influenced the poetic work of his friend Diego Moldes, in two books: &quot;Ni un día sin poesía&quot; (&quot;Not One Day Without Poetry&quot;, Madrid, 2018), with a prologue by Alejandro Jodorowsky and in &quot;Ni una poesía sin día-Not a Poem Without a Day&quot; (New York, 2023). 

Argentinean actor Leandro Taub thanks Alejandro Jodorowsky in his book &quot;La Mente Oculta&quot;, for which Jodorowsky wrote the prologue.

Jodorowsky holds both Chilean and French citizenship. His first wife was the actress Valérie Trumblay. They had three sons: Teo, Axel &quot;Cristobal&quot;, and Adan. They divorced in 1982. He is currently married to the artist and costume designer Pascale Montandon.

He had five children. 
*Brontis Jodorowsky (b. 1962), an actor who worked with his father in &quot;El Topo&quot;, &quot;The Dance of Reality&quot; and &quot;Endless Poetry&quot;, is the child of Jodorowsky and Bernadette Landru. Brontis has a child, the fashion model Alma Jodorowsky, who is the granddaughter of Alejandro.
*Teo (d. 1995), who appeared in &quot;Santa Sangre&quot;, was the eldest child of Jodorowsky and Valérie Trumblay.
*Axel Cristóbal (b. 1965, d. 2022), a psychoshaman and an actor (interpreter in &quot;Santa Sangre&quot; and the main character in the shamanic documentary &quot;Quantum Men&quot;), was the second child of Jodorowsky and Valérie Trumblay.
*Eugenia Jodorowsky, Jodorowsky&#x27;s fourth child, is the child of Jodorowsky and an unknown mother.
*Adan Jodorowsky (b. 1979), a musician known by his stage name of Adanowsky, was the third child of Jodorowsky and Valérie Trumblay, and Jodorowsky&#x27;s fifth child overall.

On his religious views, Jodorowsky has called himself an &quot;atheist mystic&quot;.

He does not drink or smoke, and has stated that he does not eat red meat or poultry because he &quot;does not like corpses&quot;, basing his diet on vegetables, fruits, grains and occasionally marine products.

In 2005, Jodorowsky officiated at the wedding of Marilyn Manson and Dita Von Teese.

==Criticism and controversy==
When Jodorowsky&#x27;s first feature film, &quot;Fando y Lis&quot;, premiered at the 1968 Acapulco Film Festival, the screening was controversial and erupted into a riot, due to its graphic content. Jodorowsky had to leave the theatre by sneaking outside to a waiting limousine, and when the crowd outside the theatre recognized him, the car was pelted with rocks. The following week, the film opened to sell-out crowds in Mexico City, but more fights broke out, and the film was banned by the Mexican government. Jodorowsky himself was nearly deported and the controversy provided a great deal of fodder for the Mexican newspapers.

In regard to the making of &quot;El Topo&quot;, Jodorowsky allegedly stated in the early 1970s:

In the documentary &quot;Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune&quot;, Jodorowsky states:

Jodorowsky was criticised for these statements. Matt Brown of Screen Anarchy wrote that &quot;it&#x27;s easier to wall off a certain type of criminality behind the buffer of time—sure, Alejandro Jodorowsky is on the record in his book on the making of the film as having raped Mara Lorenzo while making El Topo—though he later denied it—but nowadays he&#x27;s just that hilarious old kook from Jodorowsky&#x27;s Dune!&quot; Emmet Asher-Perrin of Tor.com called Jodorowsky &quot;an artist who condones rape as a means to an end for the purpose of creating art. A man who seems to believe that rape is something that women &#x27;need&#x27; if they can&#x27;t accept male sexual power on their own&quot;. Jude Doyle of &quot;Elle&quot; wrote that Jodorowsky &quot;has been teasing the idea of an unsimulated rape scene in his cult classic film &quot;El Topo&quot; for decades ... though he&#x27;s elsewhere described the unsimulated sex in that scene as consensual&quot;, and went on to state that the quote &quot;has not endangered his status as an avant-garde icon&quot;.

On 26 June 2017, Jodorowsky released a statement on his Facebook account in response to the question: &quot;Did you rape an actress during the filming of &quot;El Topo&quot;?&quot; The following excerpts are from said statement:

Unlike a pad, it is placed internally, inside of the vaginal canal. Once inserted correctly, a tampon is held in place by the vagina and expands as it soaks up menstrual blood.

As tampons also absorb the vagina&#x27;s natural lubrication and bacteria in addition to menstrual blood, they can increase the risk of toxic shock syndrome by changing the normal pH of the vagina and increasing the risk of infections from the bacterium &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. TSS is a rare but life-threatening infection that requires immediate medical attention.

The majority of tampons sold are made of blends of rayon and cotton, along with synthetic fibers. Some tampons are made out of organic cotton. Tampons are available in several absorbency ratings.

Several countries regulate tampons as medical devices. In the United States, they are considered to be a Class II medical device by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are sometimes used for hemostasis in surgery.

==Design and packaging==

Tampon design varies between companies and across product lines in order to offer a variety of applicators, materials and absorbencies. There are two main categories of tampons based on the way of insertion – digital tampons inserted by finger, and applicator tampons. Tampon applicators may be made of plastic or cardboard, and are similar in design to a syringe. The applicator consists of two tubes, an &quot;outer&quot;, or barrel, and &quot;inner&quot;, or plunger. The outer tube has a smooth surface to aid insertion and sometimes comes with a rounded end that is petaled.

Differences exist in the way tampons expand when in use: applicator tampons generally expand axially (increase in length), while digital tampons will expand radially (increase in diameter). Most tampons have a cord or string for removal. The majority of tampons sold are made of rayon, or a blend of rayon and cotton. Organic cotton tampons are marketed as 100% cotton, but they may have plastic covering the cotton core. Tampons may also come in scented or unscented varieties.

===Absorbency ratings===

==== In the US ====
Tampons are available in several absorbency ratings, which are consistent across manufacturers in the U.S. These differ in the amount of cotton in each product and are measured based on the amount of fluid they are able to absorb. The absorbency rates required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for manufacturer labeling are listed below:
==== In Europe ====
Absorbency ratings outside the US may be different. The majority of non-US manufacturers use absorbency rating and Code of Practice recommended by EDANA (European Disposables and Nonwovens Association).
==== In the UK ====
In the UK, the Absorbent Hygiene Product Manufacturers Association (AHPMA) has written a Tampon Code of Practice which companies can follow on a volunteer basis. According to this code, UK manufacturers should follow the (European) EDANA code (see above).

=== Testing ===
A piece of test equipment referred to as a Syngyna (short for synthetic vagina) is usually used to test absorbency. The machine uses a condom into which the tampon is inserted, and synthetic menstrual fluid is fed into the test chamber.

A novel way of testing was developed by feminist medical experts after the toxic shock syndrome (TSS) crisis, and used blood – rather than the industry standard blue saline – as a test material.

=== Labeling ===
The FDA requires the manufacturer to perform absorbency testing to determine the absorbency rating using the Syngyna method or other methods that are approved by the FDA. The manufacturer is also required to include on the package label the absorbency rating and a comparison to other absorbency ratings as an attempt to help consumers choose the right product and avoid complications of TSS. In addition, The following statement of association between tampons and TSS is required by the FDA to be on the package label as part of the labeling requirements: &quot;Attention: Tampons are associated with Toxic Shock Syndrome (TSS). TSS is a rare but serious disease that may cause death. Read and save the enclosed information.&quot;

Such guidelines for package labeling are more lenient when it comes to tampons bought from vending machines. For example, tampons sold in vending machines are not required by the FDA to include labeling such as absorbency ratings or information about TSS.

=== Costs ===

The average person who menstruates uses approximately 11,400 tampons in their lifetime, assuming exclusive use of tampons. Tampon prices have risen due to inflation and supply chain challenges. Currently, a box of tampons typically costs between $7 and $12 USD and contains 16 to 40 tampons, depending on the brand and size. This means users might spend between $63 and $108 annually on tampons alone, assuming the need for around 9 boxes per year. This corresponds to an average cost of approximately $0.22–$0.75 per tampon, reflecting price increases of up to 33% since the pandemic.
Activists call the problem some women have when not being able to afford menstrual products &quot;period poverty&quot;. The fact that, in certain U.S. states, sales tax applies to menstrual products is referred to as a &quot;tampon tax&quot;. As of 2024, 23 states exempt these products, while others impose taxes up to 7%. Local taxes can also apply, adding further costs. Some states such as Texas recently abolished this tax. Some states provide free tampons and pads in public schools and prisons, helping to alleviate period poverty.

== Health aspects ==
===Toxic shock syndrome===
Menstrual toxic shock syndrome (mTSS) is a life-threatening disease most commonly caused by infection of superantigen-producing &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;. The superantigen toxin secreted in &quot;S. aureus&quot; infections is TSS Toxin-1, or TSST-1. Incidence ranges from 0.03 to 0.50 cases per 100,000 people, with an overall mortality around 8%. mTSS signs and symptoms include fever (greater than or equal to 38.9 °C), rash, desquamation, hypotension (systolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg), and multi-system organ involvement with at least three systems, such as gastrointestinal complications (vomiting), central nervous system (CNS) effects (disorientation), and myalgia.

Toxic shock syndrome was named by James K. Todd in 1978. Philip M. Tierno Jr., Director of Clinical Microbiology and Immunology at the NYU Langone Medical Center, helped determine that tampons were behind toxic shock syndrome (TSS) cases in the early 1980s. Tierno blames the introduction of higher-absorbency tampons made with rayon in 1978, as well as the relatively recent decision by manufacturers to recommend that tampons can be worn overnight, for the surge in cases of TSS. However, a later meta-analysis found that the material composition of tampons is not directly correlated to the incidence of toxic shock syndrome, whereas oxygen and carbon dioxide content of menstrual fluid uptake is associated more strongly.

In 1982, a liability case called &quot;Kehm v. Proctor &amp; Gamble&quot; took place, where the family of Patricia Kehm sued Procter &amp; Gamble for her death on September 6, 1982, from TSS, while using Rely brand tampons. The case was the first successful case to sue the company. Procter &amp; Gamble paid $300,000 in compensatory damages to the Kehm family. This case can be attributed to the increase in regulations and safety protocol testing for current FDA requirements.

Some risk factors identified for developing TSS include recent labor and delivery, tampon use, recent staphylococcus infection, recent surgery, and foreign objects inside the body.

The FDA suggests the following guidelines for decreasing the risk of contracting TSS when using tampons:
* Choose the lowest absorbency needed for one&#x27;s flow (test of absorbency is approved by FDA)
* Follow package directions and guidelines for insertion and tampon usage (located on box&#x27;s label)
* Change the tampon at least every 4 to 8 hours
* Alternate usage between tampons and pads
* Increase awareness of the warning signs of Toxic Shock Syndrome and other tampon-associated health risks (and remove the tampon as soon as a risk factor is noticed)

The FDA also advises those with a history of TSS not to use tampons and instead turn to other feminine hygiene products to control menstrual flow. Other menstrual hygiene products available include pads, menstrual cups, menstrual discs, and reusable period underwear.

Cases of tampon-connected TSS are very rare in the United Kingdom and United States. A controversial study by Tierno found that all-cotton tampons were less likely than rayon tampons to produce the conditions in which TSS can grow. This was done using a direct comparison of 20 brands of tampons, including conventional cotton/rayon tampons and 100% organic cotton tampons. In a series of studies conducted after this initial claim, it was shown that all tampons (regardless of composition) are similar in their effect on TSS and that tampons made with rayon do not have an increased incidence of TSS. Instead, tampons should be selected based on minimum absorbency rating necessary to absorb flow corresponding to the individual.

Sea sponges are also marketed as menstrual hygiene products. A 1980 study by the University of Iowa found that commercially sold sea sponges contained harmful materials like sand and bacteria.

Studies have shown non-significantly higher mean levels of mercury in tampon users compared to non tampon users. No evidence showed an association between tampon use and inflammation biomarkers.

=== Other considerations ===

==== Bleached products ====
According to the Women&#x27;s Environmental Network research briefing on menstrual products made from wood pulp:The basic ingredient for menstrual pads is wood pulp, which begins life as a brown coloured product. Various &#x27;purification&#x27; processes can be used to bleach it white. Measurable levels of dioxin have been found near paper pulping mills, where chlorine has been used to bleach the wood pulp. Dioxin is one of the most persistent and toxic chemicals, and can cause reproductive disorders, damage to the immune system and cancer (26). There are no safe levels and it builds up in our fat tissue and in our environment.

==== Marine pollution ====
In the UK, the Marine Conservation Society has researched the prevalence and problem of plastic tampon applicators found on beaches.

====Disposal and flushing====

Disposal of tampons, especially flushing (which manufacturers warn against) may lead to clogged drains and waste management problems.

==== Tampon-drug interactions ====
There are multiple cases in which the use of tampons may need medical advice from a healthcare professional. For example, as part of the National Institutes of Health, the U.S. National Library of Medicine and its branch MedlinePlus advise against using tampons while being treated with any of several medications taken by the vaginal route such as vaginal suppositories and creams, as tampons may decrease the absorbance of these drugs by the body. Example of these medications include clindamycin, terconazole, miconazole, clotrimazole, when used as a vaginal cream or vaginal suppository, as well as butoconazole vaginal cream.

==== Increased risk for infections ====
According to the American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation (ASBMT), tampons may be responsible for an increased risk of infection due to the erosions it causes in the tissue of the cervix and vagina, leaving the skin prone to infections. Thus, ASBMT advises hematopoietic stem cell transplantation recipients against using tampons while undergoing therapy.

==Other uses==
===Clinical use===
Tampons are currently being used and tested to restore and/or maintain the normal microbiota of the vagina to treat bacterial vaginosis. Some of these are available to the public but come with disclaimers. The efficacy of the use of these probiotic tampons has not been established.

Tampons have also been used in cases of tooth extraction to reduce post-extraction bleeding.

Tampons are currently being investigated as a possible use to detect endometrial cancer. Endometrial cancer does not currently have effective cancer screening methods if an individual is not showing symptoms. Tampons not only absorb menstrual blood, but also vaginal fluids. The vaginal fluids absorbed in the tampons would also contain the cancerous DNA, and possibly contain precancerous material, allowing for earlier detection of endometrial cancer. Clinical trials are currently being conducted to evaluate the use of tampons as a screening method for early detection of endometrial cancer.

== Environment and waste ==

Appropriate disposal of used tampons is still lacking in many countries. Because the lack of menstrual management practices in some countries, many sanitary pads or other menstrual products will be disposed into domestic solid wastes or garbage bins that eventually becomes part of a solid wastes.

The issue that underlies the governance or implementation of menstrual waste management is how country categorizes menstrual waste. This waste could be considered as a common household waste, hazardous household waste (which will required to be segregated from routine household waste), biomedical waste given amount of blood it contains, or plastic waste given the plastic content in many commercial disposal pads (some only the outer case of the tampon or pads).

Ecological impact varies according to disposal method (whether a tampon is flushed down the toilet or placed in a garbage bin – the latter is the recommended option). Factors such as tampon composition will likewise impact sewage treatment plants or waste processing. The average use of tampons in menstruation may add up to approximately 11,400 tampons in someone&#x27;s lifetime (if they use only tampons rather than other products). Tampons are made of cotton, rayon, polyester, polyethylene, polypropylene, and fiber finishes. Aside from the cotton, rayon and fiber finishes, these materials are not biodegradable. Organic cotton tampons are biodegradable, but must be composted to ensure they break down in a reasonable amount of time. Rayon was found to be more biodegradable than cotton.

Environmentally friendly alternatives to using tampons are the menstrual cup, reusable sanitary pads, menstrual sponges, reusable tampons, and reusable absorbent underwear.

The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm carried out a life-cycle assessment (LCA) comparison of the environmental impact of tampons and sanitary pads. They found that the main environmental impact of the products was in fact caused by the processing of raw materials, particularly LDPE (low density polyethylene) – or the plastics used in the backing of pads and tampon applicators, and cellulose production. As production of these plastics requires a lot of energy and creates long-lasting waste, the main impact from the life cycle of these products is fossil fuel use, though the waste produced is significant in its own right.

The menstrual material was disposed according to the type of product, and even based on cultural beliefs. This was done regardless of giving any importance to the location and proper techniques of disposal. In some areas of the world, menstrual waste is disposed into pit latrines, as burning and burial were difficult due to limited private space.

==History==
Women have used tampons during menstruation for thousands of years. In her book &quot;Everything You Must Know About Tampons&quot; (1981), Nancy Friedman writes,[T]here is evidence of tampon use throughout history in a multitude of cultures. The oldest printed medical document, Ebers Papyrus, refers to the use of soft papyrus tampons by Egyptian women in the fifteenth century B.C. Roman women used wool tampons. Women in ancient Japan fashioned tampons out of paper, held them in place with a bandage, and changed them 10 to 12 times a day. Traditional Hawaiian women used the furry part of a native fern called hapu&#x27;u; and grasses, mosses and other plants are still used by women in parts of Asia and Africa.R. G. Mayne defined a tampon in 1860 as: &quot;a less inelegant term for the &quot;plug&quot;, whether made up of portions of rag, sponge, or a silk handkerchief, where plugging the &quot;vagina&quot; is had recourse to in cases of hemorrhage.&quot;

Earle Haas patented the first modern tampon, Tampax, with the tube-within-a-tube applicator. Gertrude Schulte Tenderich (née Voss) bought the patent rights to her company trademark Tampax and started as a seller, manufacturer, and spokesperson in 1933. Tenderich hired women to manufacture the item and then hired two sales associates to market the product to drugstores in Colorado and Wyoming, and nurses to give public lectures on the benefits of the creation, and was also instrumental in inducing newspapers to run advertisements.

In 1945, Tampax presented a number of studies to prove the safety of tampons. A 1965 study by the Rock Reproductive Clinic stated that the use of tampons &quot;has no physiological or clinical undesired side effects&quot;.

During her study of female anatomy, German gynecologist Judith Esser-Mittag developed a digital-style tampon, which was made to be inserted without an applicator. In the late 1940s, Carl Hahn and Heinz Mittag worked on the mass production of this tampon. Hahn sold his company to Johnson &amp; Johnson in 1974.

In 1992, Congress found an internal FDA memo about the presence of dioxin, a known carcinogen, in tampons. Dioxin is one of the toxic chemicals produced when wood pulp is bleached with chlorine. Congressional hearings were held and tampon manufacturers assured Congress that the trace levels of dioxin in tampons was well below EPA level. The EPA has stated there is no acceptable level of dioxin. Following this, major commercial tampon brands began switching from dioxin-producing chlorine gas bleaching methods to either elemental &quot;chlorine-free&quot; or &quot;totally chlorine free&quot; bleaching processes.

In the United States, the Tampon Safety and Research Act was introduced to Congress in 1997 in an attempt to create transparency between tampon manufacturers and consumers. The bill would mandate the conduct or support of research on the extent to which additives in feminine hygiene products pose any risks to the health of women or to the children of women who use those products during or before the pregnancies involved. Although yet to be passed, the bill has been continually reintroduced, most recently in 2019 as the Robin Danielson Feminine Hygiene Product Safety Act. Data would also be required from manufacturers regarding the presence of dioxins, synthetic fibers, chlorine, and other components (including contaminants and substances used as fragrances, colorants, dyes, and preservatives) in their feminine hygiene products.

==Society and culture==
===Tampon tax===

&quot;Tampon tax&quot; refers to tampons&#x27; lack of tax exempt status that is often in place for other basic need products. Several political statements have been made in regards to tampon use. In 2000, a 10% goods and services tax (GST) was introduced in Australia. While lubricant, condoms, incontinence pads and numerous medical items were regarded as essential and exempt from the tax, tampons continue to be charged GST. Prior to the introduction of GST, several states also applied a luxury tax to tampons at a higher rate than GST. Specific petitions such as &quot;Axe the Tampon Tax&quot; have been created to oppose this tax, and the tax was removed in 2019.
In the UK, tampons are subject to a zero rate of value added tax (VAT), as opposed to the standard rate of 20% applied to the vast majority of products sold in the country. The UK was previously bound by the EU VAT directive, which required a minimum of 5% VAT on sanitary products. Since 1 January 2021, VAT applied to menstrual sanitary products has been 0%.

In Canada, the federal government has removed the goods and services tax (GST) and harmonized sales tax (HST) from tampons and other menstrual hygiene products as of 1 July 2015.

In the US, access to menstrual products such as pads and tampons and taxes added on these products, have also been controversial topics especially when it comes to people with low income. Laws for exempting such taxes differ vastly from state to state. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has published a report discussing these laws and listing the different guidelines followed by institutions such as schools, shelters, and prisons when providing menstrual goods.

The report by ACLU also discusses the case of Kimberly Haven who was a former prisoner that had a hysterectomy after she had experienced toxic shock syndrome (TSS) due to using handmade tampons from toilet paper in prison. Her testimony supported a Maryland bill that is intended to increase access of menstrual products for imprisoned women.

=== Etymology ===
Historically, the word &quot;tampon&quot; originated from the medieval French word &quot;tampion&quot;, meaning a piece of cloth to stop a hole, a &quot;stamp&quot;, &quot;plug&quot;, or &quot;stopper&quot;.

=== Virginity ===
There is a misconception described as sexist that using a tampon rids a person of their virginity. This is because some cultures regard virginity as indicated by whether the hymen is still intact, and may believe that inserting a tampon breaks the hymen. However, this belief is not rooted in medical science. The hymen, a thin membrane partially covering the vaginal opening, varies greatly in thickness, elasticity, and shape from person to person. It almost never blocks the entire vaginal opening, stretches and thins naturally over time, and can stretch or break due to non-sexual everyday activities such as exercise; conversely, it may not break even after penetrative sexual intercourse, as it is able to stretch. Therefore, the presence or condition of the hymen is not an indicator of virginity.

Medical professionals have pointed out that misconceptions about the hymen lead to medically unfounded and harmful practices such as virginity testing and hymenoplasty.

=== In popular culture ===
In Stephen King&#x27;s novel &quot;Carrie&quot;, the title character is bullied for menstruating and is bombarded with tampons and pads by her peers.

In 1985, Tampon Applicator Creative Klubs International (TACKI) was established to develop creative uses for discarded, non-biodegradable, plastic feminine hygiene products, commonly referred to as &quot;beach whistles&quot;. TACKI President Jay Critchley launched his corporation in order to develop a global folk art movement and cottage industry, promote awareness of these throwaway objects washed up on beaches worldwide from faulty sewage systems, create the world&#x27;s largest collection of discarded plastic tampon applicators, and ban their manufacture and sale through legislative action. The project and artwork was carried out during numerous site-specific performances and installations.

=== Intersectionality ===
==== Gender inclusion ====
Tampons are traditionally marketed as products for women, conserving the idea that menstruation only affects cisgender women, or women who were assigned female at birth and continue to identify with that label. This framing marginalizes transgender men, nonbinary individuals, and genderqueer people who menstruate. This makes their experiences with menstruation largely invisible in public discourse, marketing, and product design. Addressing gender inclusion in the context of tampons involves examining societal stigmas, access challenges, and evolving efforts to create more inclusive spaces for all people who menstruate. In recent years, when discussing periods, academia has shifted terminology to be more inclusive, thus beginning to use the term &quot;menstruators&quot; instead of &quot;women.&quot;

Additionally, public restrooms often reinforce a binary understanding of gender. Men&#x27;s restrooms rarely, if ever, provide menstrual product dispensers, leaving many queer people without access to tampons when needed. When using the women&#x27;s bathroom in attempt to have access to period products, transgender and nonbinary individuals may face safety concerns or harassment for accessing restrooms that do not align with their gender identity.

Some menstrual product companies, such as Aunt Flow and Thinx, have started using inclusive language like “menstrual products” instead of “feminine hygiene products.” These efforts aim to normalize menstruation for all individuals who experience it, regardless of gender. In marketing, efforts to redesign tampon packaging to be more gender-neutral help make these products less alienating for trans and nonbinary users. Removing pink or floral designs, for example, makes them more approachable.

==== Socioeconomic disparities ====
Access to tampons is shaped by significant socioeconomic disparities, with systemic barriers disproportionately affecting individuals from low-income backgrounds. These disparities show up in various ways, including affordability challenges, stigmatization, and inadequate infrastructure. Addressing these issues requires recognizing how economic inequality intersects with social factors to restrict access to menstrual products like tampons.

A large issue in our society is period poverty, which refers to the lack of access to menstrual products, hygiene facilities, and education due to financial constraints. It is a prevalent issue in both developing and developed countries, where many people cannot afford tampons and other menstrual products. In many low-income communities, individuals often miss school, work, or social activities due to a lack of menstrual products. This contributes to cycles of poverty, as menstruation becomes a barrier to education and economic opportunities. Globally, an estimated 500 million people face period poverty. In United States, studies have shown that one in five students have struggled to afford menstrual products.

Many schools, shelters, and prisons fail to provide tampons for free or in sufficient quantities. Low-income students, in particular, may resort to unsafe alternatives like paper towels or rags, which can lead to health risks such as infections. Homeless menstruators face unique challenges, as they often lack both the financial means to purchase tampons and access to clean facilities for changing them. Nonprofits like The Homeless Period Project work to distribute tampons to these populations, but systemic support is still lacking.

==== Racial inequities ====
Racial inequities in access to menstrual products are shaped by a complex interplay of systemic racism, socioeconomic disparities, cultural stigmas, and healthcare inequality. These inequities disproportionately affect menstruators from marginalized backgrounds, limiting their access to essential products.

Menstruators from racialized communities are more likely to live in poverty due to historical economic inequities. This economic disadvantage makes purchasing tampons and other menstrual products a financial burden. This is because in some predominantly Black and Brown communities, menstrual products may be sold at higher prices due to fewer retail options and the &quot;poverty tax,&quot; where essential goods cost more in underserved areas.

Cultural stigmas around menstruation can be particularly pronounced in certain racial and ethnic communities, where periods may be considered taboo or inappropriate to discuss openly. This silence can discourage menstruators from seeking tampons or advocating for their needs. In some cultures, tampons are viewed with suspicion. They are linked to myths about virginity or seen as inappropriate for younger menstruators. These beliefs can limit the willingness or ability of individuals in certain racial groups to access tampons.

Additionally, schools in marginalized racial communities often lack comprehensive menstrual education programs. This lack of education can leave menstruators unaware of the variety of menstrual products available, or unsure how to use them safely. On top of that, racial biases in the education system may contribute to a lack of attention to the menstrual health needs of students from different racial groups.

There are many other aspects of racial inequity when it comes to menstrual product education and accessibility. People of color are less likely to have access to adequate gynecological care, and more likely to face discrimination in the health world regardless of their health issue. To add onto that, the diverse needs of people from ethnic backgrounds have historically been neglected by marketing companies. When advertising does attempt to include people of color, it often fails to address the unique cultural stigmas, challenges, or values that shape their experiences with menstruation.

==== Tampons and disability ====
Individuals with conditions that affect fine motor skills or hand strength (e.g., arthritis, cerebral palsy, or multiple sclerosis) may find it difficult to unwrap, insert, or remove tampons. The small size of tampons and their applicators can be a significant barrier. Most tampons are designed with the assumption of able-bodied users, lacking features like ergonomic grips, adaptive applicators, or designs that accommodate reduced hand mobility. Public restrooms, especially those not compliant with accessibility standards, may not provide sufficient space or the necessary support structures (e.g., grab bars) for disabled individuals to manage tampon insertion or removal. People who struggle with vision may encounter difficulties identifying tampon sizes, brands, or instructions due to the lack of braille on packaging or tactile features on the products themselves. For menstruators with hearing impairments, they may miss out on important product usage information if it is only provided through audio formats or poorly captioned content.

People with intellectual or developmental disabilities may require additional support to learn how to use tampons safely and effectively. Complex instructions, such as proper insertion angles and removal timing, can be challenging to navigate without guidance. Caregivers or support workers may need to assist disabled menstruators with tampon usage. However, this raises concerns about autonomy, privacy, and dignity, as menstruation is a deeply personal experience.

Certain disabilities or chronic illnesses (e.g., endometriosis, pelvic floor disorders, or interstitial cystitis) may make tampon use uncomfortable or painful. These conditions can limit access to tampons as a viable option for menstrual care. Some disabled individuals have heightened sensitivity to tampon materials (e.g., rayon, chlorine bleach, or fragrances), which can increase discomfort or lead to allergic reactions.

Disabled menstruators often face compounded stigma, as society tends to marginalize both disabled individuals and discussions around menstruation. This can lead to isolation and discomfort in seeking out appropriate menstrual products.

==== Activism and advocacy ====
Advocacy around tampons intersects with broader movements for menstrual equity. These movements aim to dismantle the societal, economic, and cultural barriers that perpetuate inequality. Activism plays a critical role in shaping policy and ensuring that tampons are accessible and affordable for all menstruators. Many advocacy groups campaign to remove sales tax on tampons and other menstrual products, arguing that these items are essential healthcare products rather than luxury goods. Success stories include states and countries that have already abolished the tax, setting a precedent for global change.

Campaigns also work to normalize conversations about menstruation, dismantling stigma that has historically silenced discussions around menstrual products. Destigmatization efforts include public education campaigns, art installations, and social media movements aimed at reframing menstruation as a natural aspect of human health. Advocates are pushing for the portrayal of menstruation in mainstream media, emphasizing diverse menstruators’ experiences and highlighting the role of tampons in empowering individuals to manage their periods effectively.

Organizations like Period: The Menstrual Movement and Menstrual Equity for All are working to raise awareness about the need for inclusivity in menstruation-related discussions. Advocating for free menstrual products in schools, prisons, and public spaces, particularly in areas serving predominantly racialized populations, can help bridge gaps in access. Schools and healthcare providers must offer menstrual care that reflect the cultural challenges faced by diverse racial groups, ensuring that tampons are accessible to all.

<text>The Albanian alphabet () is a variant of the Latin alphabet used to write the Albanian language. It consists of 36 letters:

The vowels are shown in bold.

The letters are named simply by their sounds, followed by ë for consonants (e.g. shë). to the pronunciation of the 36 letters.

== History ==
The earliest known mention of Albanian writings comes from a French Catholic church document from 1332. Written either by archbishop Guillaume Adam or the monk Brocardus Monacus the report notes that &quot;Licet Albanenses aliam omnino linguam a latina habeant et diversam, tamen litteram latinam habent in usu et in omnibus suis libris&quot; (&quot;Though the Albanians have a language entirely their own and different from Latin, they nevertheless use Latin letters in all their books&quot;). Scholars warn that this could mean Albanians also wrote in the Latin language, not necessarily just Albanian with a Latin script.

The history of the later Albanian alphabet is closely linked with the influence of religion among Albanians. The writers from the North of Albania used Latin letters under the influence of the Catholic Church, those from the South of Albania under the Greek Orthodox church used Greek letters, while others used Arabic letters under the influence of Islam. There were also attempts for an original Albanian alphabet in the period of 1750–1850. The current alphabet in use among Albanians is one of the two variants approved in the Congress of Manastir held by Albanian intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Manastir (Bitola, North Macedonia).

=== Alphabet used in early literature ===
The first certain document in Albanian is the &quot;Formula e pagëzimit&quot; (1462) (baptismal formula), issued by Pal Engjëlli (1417–1470); it was written in Latin characters. It was a simple phrase that was supposed to be used by the relatives of a dying person if they could not make it to churches during the troubled times of the Ottoman invasion.

Also, the five Albanian writers of the 16th and 17th centuries (Gjon Buzuku, Lekë Matrënga, Pjetër Budi, Frang Bardhi and Pjetër Bogdani) who form the core of early Albanian literature, all used a Latin alphabet for their Albanian books; this alphabet remained in use by writers in northern Albania until the beginning of the 20th century.

The Greek intellectual Anastasios Michael, in his speech to the Berlin Academy () mentions an Albanian alphabet produced &quot;recently&quot; by Kosmas from Cyprus, bishop of Dyrrachium. It is assumed that this is the alphabet used later for the &quot;Gospel of Elbasan&quot;. Anastasios calls Kosmas the &quot;Cadmus of Albania&quot;.

=== National awakening 19th-century endeavours ===

In 1857 Kostandin Kristoforidhi, an Albanian scholar and translator, drafted in Istanbul, Ottoman Empire, a &quot;Memorandum for the Albanian language&quot;. He then went to Malta, where he stayed until 1860 in a Protestant seminary, finishing the translation of &quot;The New Testament&quot; in the Tosk and Gheg dialects. He was helped by Nikolla Serreqi from Shkodër with the Gheg version of the New Testament. Nikolla Serreqi was also the propulsor for the use of the Latin script for the translation of the New Testament, which had already been used by the early writers of the Albanian literature; Kristoforidhi enthusiastically embraced the idea of a Latin alphabet.

In November 1869, a Commission for the Alphabet of the Albanian Language was gathered in Istanbul. One of its members was Kostandin Kristoforidhi and the main purpose of the commission was the creation of a unique alphabet for all the Albanians. In January 1870 the commission ended its work of the standardisation of the alphabet, which was mainly in Latin letters. A plan on the creation of textbooks and spread of Albanian schools was drafted. However this plan was not realized, because the Ottoman government would not finance the expenses for the establishment of such schools.

Although this commission had gathered and delivered an alphabet in 1870, the writers from the North still used the Latin-based alphabet, whereas in southern Albania writers used mostly the Greek letters. In southern Albania, the main activity of Albanian writers consisted in translating Greek Orthodox religious texts, and not in forming any kind of literature which could form a strong tradition for the use of Greek letters. As the albanologist Robert Elsie has written:

The turning point was the aftermath of the League of Prizren (1878) events when in 1879 Sami Frashëri and Naim Frashëri formed the Society for the Publication of Albanian Writings. Sami Frashëri, Koto Hoxhi, Pashko Vasa and Jani Vreto created an alphabet. This was based on the principle of &quot;one sound one letter&quot; (although the revision of 1908 replaced the letter &quot;ρ&quot; with the &quot;rr&quot; digraph to avoid confusion with &quot;p&quot;). This was called the &quot;Istanbul alphabet&quot; (also &quot;Frashëri alphabet&quot;). In 1905 this alphabet was in widespread use in all Albanian territory, North and South, including Catholic, Muslim and Orthodox areas.

One year earlier, in 1904 had been published the Albanian dictionary () of Kostandin Kristoforidhi, after the author&#x27;s death. The dictionary had been drafted 25 years before its publication and was written in the Greek alphabet.

The so-called &quot;Bashkimi&quot; alphabet was designed by the Society for the Unity of the Albanian Language for being written on a French typewriter and includes no diacritics other than &quot;é&quot; (compared to ten graphemes of the Istanbul alphabet which were either non-Latin or had diacritics).

=== Congress of Manastir ===
In 1908, the Congress of Manastir was held by Albanian intellectuals in Bitola, in what is now the Republic of North Macedonia. The Congress was hosted by the &quot;Bashkimi&quot; (&quot;unity&quot;) club, and prominent delegates included Gjergj Fishta, Ndre Mjeda, Mit&#x27;hat Frashëri, Sotir Peçi, Shahin Kolonja, and Gjergj D. Qiriazi. There was much debate and the contending alphabets were &quot;Istanbul&quot;, &quot;Bashkimi&quot; and &quot;Agimi&quot;. However, the Congress was unable to make a clear decision and opted for a compromise solution of using both the widely used &quot;Istanbul&quot;, with minor changes, and a modified version of the &quot;Bashkimi&quot; alphabet. Usage of the alphabet of Istanbul declined rapidly and it was essentially extinct over the following decades, due largely to its inconvenience in requiring new custom-made glyphs that Bashkimi did not.

During 1909 and 1910 there were movements by members of the Young Turks to adopt an Arabic alphabet, as they considered the Latin script to be un-Islamic. In Korçë and Gjirokastër, demonstrations took place favoring the Latin script, and in Elbasan, Muslim clerics led a demonstration for the Arabic script, telling their congregations that using the Latin script would make them infidels. In 1911, the Young Turks dropped their opposition to the Latin script; finally, the Latin &quot;Bashkimi&quot; alphabet was adopted, and is still in use today.

The modifications to the Bashkimi alphabet were made to include characters used in the Istanbul and Agimi alphabets. &quot;Ç&quot; was chosen over &quot;ch&quot; since &quot;c with cedilla&quot; could be found on every typewriter, given its use in French. Other changes were more esthetic and as a way to combine the three scripts.

A second congress at Manastir (Bitola) was held in April 1910, which confirmed the decision taken in the first congress of Manastir. After Albanian independence in 1912, there were two alphabets in use. Following the events of the Balkan wars and World War I, the Bashkimi variant dominated. The Bashkimi alphabet is at the origin of the official alphabet of the Albanian language in use today. The digraphs of the Albanian alphabet are the letters Dh, Gj, Ll, Nj, Rr, Sh, Th, Xh, and Zh.

== Other alphabets used for written Albanian ==
The modern Latin-based Albanian alphabet is the result of long evolution. Before the creation of the unified alphabet, Albanian was written in several different alphabets, with several sub-variants:

=== Derived alphabets ===

Latin-derived alphabet

Albanian in Latin script used various conventions:
* The oldest surviving document with Albanian text is from the 15th century and written in the Latin script. Early Albanian writers such as Gjon Buzuku, Pjetër Bogdani, Pjetër Budi, and Frang Bardhi also used a Latin-based script, adding Greek characters to represent extra sounds.
* A &quot;Catholic alphabet&quot; used by Arbëreshë (Italo-Albanians).
* The Istanbul alphabet, created by Sami Frashëri, combining Latin and Greek. This became widely used as it was also adopted by the Istanbul Society for the Printing of Albanian Writings, which in 1879 printed &quot;Alfabetare&quot;, the first Albanian abecedarium.
* &quot;Bashkimi&quot;, developed by the Albanian literary society Bashkimi (Unity) in Shkodër with the help of Catholic clergy and Franciscans aiming at more simplicity than its forerunners. It used digraphs for unique sounds of the Albanian language. It resembles the current alphabet with the differences being the use of &quot;ch&quot; for &quot;ç&quot;, &quot;c&quot; for &quot;q&quot;, &quot;ts&quot; for &quot;c&quot;, &quot;é&quot; for &quot;e&quot;, &quot;e&quot; for &quot;ë&quot;, &quot;gh&quot; for &quot;gj&quot;, &quot;gn&quot; for &quot;nj&quot;, and &quot;z/zh&quot; have swapped places with &quot;x/xh&quot;.
* &quot;Agimi&quot;, developed by the Agimi (&quot;Dawn&quot;) Literary Society in 1901, and spearheaded by Ndre Mjeda. It made use of diacritics instead of digraphs used by Bashkimi.


Sample text in the Agimi alphabet:

Kelit i fali lala ńi mołə tə bukurə. Sá škoj nə špiə i þa Linəsə, sə moterəsə. „Ḱyr sá e bukurə âšt kəjo mołə! Eja e t’ a dájmə baškə.“ „Me kênə mã e mađe, i þa e motəra, kišimə me e daə baškə; por mbassi âšt aḱ e vogelə, haje vetə.“ „Ani ča? þa Keli, t’ a hámə baškə, se mə vjen mã e mirə.“

&quot;Kəndime pər škołə tə para tə Šḱypəniəsə: Pjesa e parə&quot;, at Albanian National Library, f. 100.

Greek-derived alphabet
* The Greek alphabet; used to write Tosk starting in about 1500 (Elsie, 1991). The printing press at Voskopojë published several Albanian texts in Greek script during the 18th century (Macrakis, 1996).

Ottoman-derived alphabet
* The Ottoman Turkish alphabet, favored by Muslims. Last version called &quot;Elifbaja shqip&quot; was published by scholar and writer Rexhep Voka, a prominent figure of the Albanian National Awakening.

Arabic-derived alphabet
* The Arabic alphabet; a primer was published in 1861 in Constantinople by Mullah Daut Boriçi.

=== Original alphabets ===

The Franco-Danish geographer Conrad Malte-Brun sparked interest in developing an Albanian alphabet in the 18th century. In his Universal Geography published in 1826 Malte-Brun mentions an Albanian &quot;ecclesiastical alphabet, which consists of thirty letters.&quot; After him Johann Georg von Hahn, Leopold Geitler, Gjergj Pekmezi and others continued studies on the same topic. Seven original Albanian alphabets have been discovered since.

* The Elbasan script (18th century); used to write the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript. Widely thought to be the work of Gregory of Durrës. According to Robert Elsie, &quot;The alphabet of the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript is quite well suited to the Albanian language. Indeed, on the whole, one might regard it as better suited than the present-day Albanian alphabet, based on a Latin model. The Elbasan alphabet utilises one character per phoneme, with the exception of &quot;n&quot;, for which there are two characters, and &quot;g&quot;, for which there are three characters (two of which being restricted to specific Greek loanwords). The distinction between Albanian &quot;r&quot; and &quot;rr&quot; and between &quot;l&quot; and &quot;ll&quot; is created by a dot over the character. A dot over a &quot;d&quot; creates an &quot;nd&quot;. A spiritus lenis plus acute above the line, as in Greek, seems to be utilized on a sporadic basis to indicate word or phrase stress. On the whole, the writing system utilized in the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript is clear, relatively precise, and appears to be well thought out by its inventor.&quot;
* Undeciphered Script from the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript. On the front page of the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript itself is a drawing and about a dozen words, perhaps personal names, written in a script which differs completely from that of the rest of the manuscript. This writing system has as yet to be deciphered, although Elbasan scholar Dhimitër Shuteriqi (b. 1915) has made an attempt to read it.
* The Todhri script (18th century), attributed to Theodhor Haxhifilipi. The Todhri alphabet was discovered by Johann Georg von Hahn (1811–1869), Austrian consul in Janina and the father of Albanian Studies. Hahn published what he regarded as &#x27;the original&#x27; Albanian alphabet in his monumental Albanesische Studien (Jena 1854) and saw in it a derivative of ancient Phoenician script. The study of this alphabet was subsequently taken up by Leopold Geitler (1847–1885) who regarded Todhri script as derived primarily from Roman cursive, and by the Slovenian scholar Rajko Nahtigal (1877–1958). The Todhri alphabet is a complex writing system of fifty-two characters which was used sporadically for written communication in and around Elbasan from the late eighteenth century on. It does not conform adequately to the Albanian language, certainly not as well as the alphabet of the Elbasan Gospel Manuscript, to which it shows no relation
* Another original script, sometimes called the Berati script, is found in Codex of Berat (not to be confused with Codex Beratinus I and II). This 154-page manuscript, now preserved in the National Library of Tiranë, is in fact a simple paper manuscript and must not be envisaged as an illuminated parchment &#x27;codex&#x27; in the Western tradition. It seems to have been the work of at least two hands and to have been written between the years 1764 and 1798. The manuscript is commonly attributed to one Constantine of Berat (c. 1745 – c. 1825), known in Albanian as Kostandin Berati or Kostë Berati, who is thought to have been an Orthodox monk and writer from Berat. Constantine of Berat is reported to have possessed the manuscript from 1764 to 1822, although there is no indication that he was its author. The Codex of Berat contains various and sundry texts in Greek and Albanian: biblical and Orthodox liturgical texts in Albanian written in the Greek alphabet, all of them no doubt translated from Greek or strongly influenced by Greek models; a forty-four-line Albanian poem with the corresponding Greek text known as Zonja Shën Mëri përpara kryqësë (The Virgin Mary before the cross); two Greek-Albanian glossaries comprising a total of 1,710 entries; various religious notes; and a chronicle of events between 1764 and 1789 written in Greek. On page 104 of the codex, we find two lines of Albanian written in an original alphabet of 37 letters, influenced, as it would seem, by Glagolitic script. On page 106, the author also gives an overview of the writing system he created. It, too, is not well devised and does not seem to occur anywhere else. Recently it has been observed that the same script had a wider usage, including in Elbasan and possibly in Voskopojë.
* The Veso Bey alphabet, another original alphabet by Veso bey, who is one of the most prominent chiefs of Gjirokastër, from the family of Alizot Pasha. Veso Bey learned it in his youth from an Albanian hodja as a secret script which his family inherited, and used it himself for correspondence with his relatives.
* Vellara script was used in southern Albania, named after the Greek doctor, lyricist and writer Ioannis Vilaras (Alb: Jan Vellara). The son of a doctor, Vilaras studied medicine in Padua in 1789 and later lived in Venice. In 1801, he became a physician to Veli, son of the infamous Ali Pasha Tepelena (1741–1822). Vilaras is remembered primarily as a modern Greek poet and does not seem to have been a native Albanian speaker at all. He is the author of eighty-six pages of bilingual grammatical notes, dated 1801, which were designed no doubt to teach other Greek-speakers Albanian. The Albanian in question is a Tosk dialect written in an original alphabet of thirty letters based on Latin and to a lesser extent on Greek. The manuscript of the work was donated to the Bibliothèque Nationale in Paris (supplément grec 251, f. 138–187) in 1819 by François Pouqueville (1770–1839), French consul in Janina during the reign of Ali Pasha Tepelena . Pouqueville was aware of the value of the work, noting: &quot;Je possède un manuscrit, une grammaire grecque vulgaire et schype qui pourrait être utile aux philologues&quot;, but chose not to publish it in his travel narratives. Appendixed to the grammatical notes is also a letter dated 30 October 1801, written in Albanian in Vellara&#x27;s handwriting from the village of Vokopolë, south of Berat, where the physician had been obliged to follow Veli during the latter&#x27;s military campaign against Ibrahim of Berat. Part of the manuscript is also a list of proverbs, both in modern Greek and Albanian.
* The Vithkuqi alphabet (1844). From 1824 to 1844, Naum Veqilharxhi developed and promoted a 33-letter alphabet which he had printed in an eight-page Albanian spelling book in 1844. This little spelling book was distributed throughout southern Albania, from Korçë to Berat, and was received, as it seems, with a good deal of enthusiasm. In the following year, 1845, the booklet was augmented to forty-eight pages in a now equally rare second edition entitled Faré i ri abétor shqip per djélm nismetore (A very new Albanian spelling book for elementary schoolboys). However, the resonance of this original alphabet, which reminds one at first glance of a type of cursive Armenian, was in fact limited, due in part to the author&#x27;s premature death one year later and in part no doubt to financial and technical considerations. In the mid-nineteenth century, when publishing was making great strides even in the Balkans, a script requiring a new font for printing would have resulted in prohibitive costs for any prospective publisher. As such, although reasonably phonetic and confessionally neutral, the Veqilharxhi alphabet never took hold.

=== Older versions of the alphabet in Latin characters ===

Before the standardisation of the Albanian alphabet, there were several ways of writing the sounds peculiar to Albanian, namely ⟨c⟩, ⟨ç⟩, ⟨dh⟩, ⟨ë⟩, ⟨gj⟩, ⟨ll⟩, ⟨nj⟩, ⟨q⟩, ⟨rr⟩, ⟨sh⟩, ⟨th⟩, ⟨x⟩, ⟨xh⟩, ⟨y⟩, ⟨z⟩ and ⟨zh⟩. Also, ⟨j⟩ was written in more than one way.

;⟨c⟩, ⟨ç⟩, ⟨k⟩, and ⟨q⟩
The earliest Albanian sources were written by people educated in Italy, as a consequence, the value of the letters were similar to those of the Italian alphabet. The present-day c was written with a ⟨z⟩, and the present-day ç was written as ⟨c⟩ as late as 1895. Conversely, the present-day k was written as ⟨c⟩ until 1868. c was also written as ⟨ts⟩ (Reinhold 1855 and Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨tz⟩ (Rada 1866) and ⟨zz⟩. It was first written as ⟨c⟩ in 1879 by Frashëri but also in 1908 by Pekmezi. ç was also written as ⟨tz⟩ (Leake 1814), ⟨ts̄⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨ci⟩ (Rada 1866), ⟨tš⟩ (Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨tç⟩ (Dozon 1878), ⟨č⟩ (by Agimi) and ⟨ch⟩ (by Bashkimi). ç itself was first used by Frasheri (1879).

The present-day q was variously written as ⟨ch⟩, ⟨chi⟩, ⟨k⟩, ⟨ky⟩, ⟨kj⟩, k with dot (Leake 1814) k with overline (Reinhold 1855), k with apostrophe (Miklosich 1870), and ⟨ḱ⟩ (first used by Lepsius 1863). ⟨q⟩ was first used in Frashëri&#x27;s Stamboll mix-alphabet in 1879 and also in the &quot;Grammaire albanaise&quot; of 1887.

;⟨dh⟩ and ⟨th⟩
The present-day dh was originally written with a character similar to the Greek xi (ξ). This was doubled (ξξ) to write &#x27;th&#x27;. These characters were used as late as 1895. Leake first used ⟨dh⟩ and ⟨th⟩ in 1814. dh was also written using the Greek letter delta (δ), while Alimi used ⟨đ⟩ and Frasheri used a ⟨d⟩ with a hook on the top stem of the letter.

;⟨ë⟩
This letter was not usually differentiated from ⟨e⟩, but when it was, it was usually done by means of diacritics: ⟨ė⟩ (Bogdani 1685, da Lecce 1716 and Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨e̊⟩ (Lepsius 1863), ⟨ẹ̄⟩ (Miklosich 1870) or by new letters ⟨ö⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨υ⟩ (Rada 1866), ⟨œ⟩ (Dozon 1878), ⟨ε⟩ (Meyer 1888 and 1891, note Frasheri used ⟨ε⟩ for ⟨e⟩, and ⟨e⟩ to write ⟨ë⟩; the revision of 1908 swapped these letters) and ⟨ə⟩ (Alimi). Rada first used ⟨ë⟩ in 1870.

;⟨gj⟩ and ⟨g⟩
These two sounds were not usually differentiated in writing. They were variously written as ⟨g⟩, ⟨gh⟩ and ⟨ghi⟩. When they were differentiated, g was written as ⟨g⟩ or (by Liguori 1867) as ⟨gh⟩, while gj was written as ⟨gi⟩ (Leake 1814), ⟨ḡ⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨ǵ⟩ (first used by Lepsius 1863), ⟨gy⟩ (Dozon 1878) and a modified ⟨g⟩ (Frasheri). The &quot;Grammaire albanaise&quot; (1887) first used gj, but it was also used by Librandi (1897). Rada (1866) used ⟨g⟩, ⟨gh⟩, ⟨gc⟩, and ⟨gk⟩ for g, and ⟨gki⟩ for ⟨gj⟩.

;⟨h⟩
The older versions of the Albanian alphabet differentiated between two &quot;h&quot; sounds, one for one for the Voiceless velar fricative . The second sound was written as ⟨h⟩, ⟨kh⟩, ⟨ch⟩, and Greek khi ⟨χ⟩.

;⟨j⟩
This sound was most commonly written as ⟨j⟩, but some authors (Leake 1814, Lepsius 1863, Kristoforidis 1872, Dozon 1878) wrote this as ⟨y⟩.

;⟨ll⟩ and ⟨l⟩
Three &quot;l&quot; sounds were distinguished in older Albanian alphabets, represented by IPA as . l was written as ⟨l⟩. ll was written as ⟨λ⟩, italic ⟨&quot;l&quot;⟩, ⟨lh⟩ and ⟨ł⟩. Blanchi (1635) first used ll. was written as ⟨l⟩, ⟨li⟩, ⟨l’⟩ (Miklosich 1870 and Meyer 1888 and 1891), ⟨ĺ⟩ (Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨lh⟩, ⟨gl⟩, ⟨ly⟩ and ⟨lj⟩.

;⟨nj⟩
This sound was most commonly written as ⟨gn⟩ in Italian fashion. It was also written as italic ⟨&quot;n&quot;⟩ (Leake 1814), ⟨n̄⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨ń⟩ (first used by Lepsius 1863), ⟨ṅ⟩ (Miklosich 1870), ⟨ñ⟩ (Dozon 1878). The &quot;Grammaire albanaise&quot; (1887) first used nj.

;⟨rr⟩
Blanchi first used ⟨rr⟩ to represent this sound. However, also used were Greek rho (ρ) (Miklosich 1870), ⟨ṙ⟩ (Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨rh⟩ (Dozon 1878 and &quot;Grammaire albanaise&quot; 1887), ⟨r̄⟩ (Meyer 1888 and 1891), ⟨r̀⟩ (Alimi) and ⟨p⟩ (Frasheri, who used a modified ⟨p⟩ for [p]).

;⟨sh⟩ and ⟨s⟩
These two sounds were not consistently differentiated in the earliest versions of the Albanian alphabet. When they were differentiated, s was represented by ⟨s⟩ or ⟨ss⟩, while sh was represented by ⟨sc⟩, ⟨ſc⟩, ⟨s̄⟩ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨ç⟩ (Dozon 1878) and ⟨š⟩. sh was first used by Rada in 1866.

;⟨x⟩
Frasheri first used ⟨x⟩ to represent this sound. Formerly, it was written variously as ⟨ds⟩ (Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨dz⟩, ⟨z⟩, and ⟨zh⟩.

;⟨xh⟩
The &quot;Grammaire albanaise&quot; (1887) first used ⟨xh⟩. Formerly, it was written variously as ⟨gi⟩, ⟨g⟩, ⟨dš⟩ (Kristoforidis 1872), ⟨dž⟩, ⟨x⟩ and ⟨zh⟩.

;⟨y⟩
This sound was written as ⟨y⟩ in 1828. Formerly it was written as ȣ (Cyrillic uk), italic ⟨&quot;u&quot;⟩ (Leake 1814), ⟨ü⟩, ⟨ṳ⟩, and ⟨ε⟩.

;⟨z⟩
Leake first used ⟨z⟩ to represent this sound in 1814. Formerly, it was written variously as a backward 3, Greek zeta (ζ) (Reinhold 1855), ⟨x⟩ (Bashkimi) and a symbol similar to ⟨p⟩ (Altsmar).

;⟨zh⟩
This sound was variously written as an overlined ζ (Reinhold 1855), ⟨sg⟩ (Rada 1866), ⟨ž⟩, ⟨j⟩ (Dozon 1878), underdotted z, ⟨xh⟩ (Bashkimi), ⟨zc⟩. It was also written with a backward 3 in combination: 3gh and 3c.

=== Old Greek alphabets ===

Arvanites in Greece used the altered Greek alphabet to write in Albanian. There are several variants.

Various remedies are used to graphically distinguish Greek Β from Latin B, including for the Greek and Cyrillic for the Latin, though sometimes it&#x27;s just a matter of the different typefaces used for Latin and Greek being sufficient.

<doc id="262672" wikidata="Q177727" url="?curid=262672" title="Morbier cheese">
<text>Morbier () is a semi-soft cows&#x27; milk cheese of France named after the small village of Morbier in Franche-Comté. It is ivory colored, soft and slightly elastic, and is immediately recognizable by the distinctive thin black layer separating it horizontally in the middle. It has a yellowish, sticky rind.

==Description==

The aroma of Morbier cheese is mild, with a rich and creamy flavour. It has a semblance to Raclette cheese in consistency.

The Jura and Doubs versions both benefit from an (AOP), though other non-AOP Morbier exist on the market.

==Preparation==
Traditionally, the cheese consists of a layer of evening milk curd and a layer of morning milk curd. When making Comté, cheesemakers would end the day with leftover curd that was not enough for an entire cheese. Thus, they would press the remaining evening curd into a mold, and spread ash over it to protect it overnight. The following morning, the cheese would be topped with morning milk curd. The layer of ash is left in place in between the layers of milk.

Today, it is typically prepared in factories and larger dairy cooperatives from one batch of milk, with the traditional ash line replaced by edible commercial vegetable ash.

<doc id="262673" wikidata="Q552511" url="?curid=262673" title="Bill Laswell">
<text>William Otis Laswell (born February 12, 1955) is an American bass guitarist, record producer, and record label owner. He has been involved in thousands of recordings with many collaborators from all over the world. His music draws from funk, world music, jazz, dub, and ambient styles.

According to music critic Chris Brazier, &quot;Laswell&#x27;s pet concept is &#x27;collision music&#x27; which involves bringing together musicians from wildly divergent but complementary spheres and seeing what comes out.&quot; Although his bands may be credited under the same name and often feature the same roster of musicians, the styles and themes explored on different albums can vary dramatically. Material began as a noisy dance music band, but later albums concentrated on hip hop, jazz, or spoken word readings by William S. Burroughs. Most versions of the band Praxis have included guitarist Buckethead, but they have explored different permutations on albums.

== Early life ==
Bill Laswell was born on February 12, 1955, in Salem, Illinois. As a child, his family relocated frequently, exposing Laswell to a variety of regional cultural and musical traditions.

In his teenage years, Laswell&#x27;s family settled in Michigan, an area with a very diverse music scene during the 1960s and 1970s, from Motown Records to Detroit&#x27;s burgeoning punk and rock scenes. During this time, Laswell taught himself to play bass guitar, and he developed an unconventional approach to the instrument, experimenting with its potential to create soundscapes rather than merely support rhythm.
==Career==

===Early years===
Laswell began performing as a bass guitarist in R&amp;B and funk bands in Detroit and Ann Arbor, Michigan, and saw shows that combined genres, such as Iggy and the Stooges, MC5, and Funkadelic. He was also influenced by jazz musicians John Coltrane, Albert Ayler, and Miles Davis. The live jazz performances and experimental rock acts of Michigan&#x27;s music festivals encouraged him towards musical experimentation and non-traditional forms, including African drumming, Indian ragas, and Middle Eastern maqams. Later, he was intrigued by the avant-garde and experimental movements of the 1970s, including the works of minimalist composers and electronic music pioneers. He began experimenting with effects pedals and early recording techniques, reflecting his broader artistic philosophy, that music could transcend traditional categorizations and connect diverse cultural and sonic elements.

===New York and Material===
In the late 1970s Laswell moved to New York City, immersing himself in the thriving New York music scene. He moved into producer Giorgio Gomelsky&#x27;s loft and became part of a group of musicians that would become the first version of Material. Material became the backing band for Daevid Allen and New York Gong. The band consisted of Laswell, keyboardist Michael Beinhorn, and drummer Fred Maher. They were usually supplemented by guitarists Cliff Cultreri or Robert Quine.

He worked with Brian Eno, Fred Frith, John Zorn, Daniel Ponce, Ginger Baker, Peter Brötzmann, Kip Hanrahan, Sonny Sharrock, and with musicians in no wave, a genre that combined avant-garde jazz, funk, and punk.

He started a recording studio with Martin Bisi and met Jean Karakos, owner of Celluloid Records. Under the Material name Laswell became the &quot;de facto&quot; house producer for Celluloid until the label was sold in the 1980s. He recorded music that was experimental, combining jazz, funk, pop, and R&amp;B, by musicians such as Whitney Houston, Sonny Sharrock, Archie Shepp, Henry Threadgill, and the band Massacre with Fred Frith and Fred Maher. His association with Celluloid allowed his first forays into &quot;collision music&quot;, a term coined by British writer Chris May of &quot;Black Music &amp; Jazz Review&quot;. Recordings with the Golden Palominos and production on albums by Shango, Toure Kunda, and Fela Kuti appeared on the label. Celluloid was an early advocate of hip hop, producing albums by Fab 5 Freddy, GrandMixer D.ST, Phase II, and Afrika Bambaataa. The album &quot;World Destruction&quot; paired John Lydon with Afrika Bambaataa years before Aerosmith and Run–D.M.C. collaborated on their rock/hip hop version of &quot;Walk This Way&quot;.

In 1982, Laswell released &quot;Baselines&quot;, his solo debut album. A year later, he had a breakthrough with &quot;Rockit&quot;, a song he co-wrote and produced for Herbie Hancock&#x27;s album &quot;Future Shock&quot;. He played bass guitar and co-wrote other songs on the album, leading to collaborations with Hancock through the 2000s. He won a Grammy Award for producing Hancock&#x27;s next album, &quot;Sound-System&quot;.

He became a member of the band Last Exit in 1986 with Peter Brötzmann, Ronald Shannon Jackson, and Sonny Sharrock. Aside from one album that Laswell cobbled together in the studio, the band was primarily a live one, showing up at gigs with no rehearsal. The first time the four members played together was on stage at their first show.

Laswell produced albums for Sly and Robbie, Mick Jagger, PiL, Motörhead, Ramones, Stevie Salas, Iggy Pop and Yoko Ono. Many of these bands afforded Laswell the opportunity to hire his working crew to record on more mainstream records. Sly and Robbie hired him to produce their 1985 album &quot;Language Barrier&quot; and 1987 album &quot;Rhythm Killers&quot;.

===Running Axiom===
Island Records founder Chris Blackwell gave him the opportunity to begin a label in 1990, thus forming Axiom Records. In addition to albums by Material that included Sly and Robbie, William S. Burroughs, Bootsy Collins, Wayne Shorter, and Bernie Worrell, he produced and released albums by Ginger Baker, Ronald Shannon Jackson, Sonny Sharrock, Nicky Skopelitis, and Umar Bin Hassan. Among the studio-based albums, Palestinian oud and violinist Simon Shaheen recorded an album of music by Egyptian composer Mohammed Abdel Wahab. Gambian virtuoso Foday Musa Suso recorded an album of dance music with his electric Kora, and Turkish saz master Talip Oezkan recorded an album. Master Musicians of Jajouka recorded an album in their village in the Rif Mountains. There were albums by Mandinka and Fulani recorded at Suso&#x27;s family compound in Gambia and Gnawa music from Morocco.

Praxis featured guitarist Buckethead on &quot;Transmutation&quot; with Bootsy Collins, Bryan Mantia, Bernie Worrell, and Afrika Baby Bam from the Jungle Brothers. The album blended funk grooves and heavy metal riffs with many tracks co-written by Laswell.

&quot;Funkcronomicon&quot; included previously released tracks by Praxis and Skopelitis and tracks with members of Parliament-Funkadelic. George Clinton, Bootsy Collins, Bernie Worrell, and the last recordings of Eddie Hazel are featured prominently. The album includes DXT, Umar Bin Hassan, Abiodun Oyewole and Torture. Laswell remixed the Axiom catalog for &quot;Axiom Ambient&quot;, blending seemingly disparate tracks, releasing some of the music for &quot;Sample Material – International Free Zone&quot;, a sample library for other musicians to use as material.

===Other labels===
Subharmonic, conceived by Laswell and ex-Celluloid A&amp;R Robert Soares, though not owned by Laswell, was essentially a vehicle for his projects, most in the ambient or ambient-dub categories. The label licensed a few releases from European labels for American re-release, notably &quot;Psychonavigation&quot; with Pete Namlook and &quot;Cymatic Scan&quot; with Tetsu Inoue from Pete Namlook&#x27;s FAX label; &quot;Somnific Flux&quot; with Mick Harris and &quot;Cold Summer&quot; by Lull from the Sentrax label. Other collaborators included Jonah Sharp and Terre Thaemlitz. The label also released albums by Painkiller, Praxis, and Divination, an ambient dub project by Laswell. A sub-label called Strata was created with five releases in a more experimental dub/noise/ambient vein. Each of these releases (Death Cube K, Cypher 7, Azonic, and two under his alias Automaton) came in a black jewel case with the name of the project and album title printed on the front.

Three other short-lived labels were created after the demise of the Subharmonic deal. One was Meta, which was intended to be a spoken word label. The second label, Submeta, managed four releases before folding. Meta, formed with Janet Rienstra, released only one album, &quot;Baptism of Solitude&quot; with novelist Paul Bowles reading excerpts from his work over soundscapes by Laswell. Meta would appear periodically, distributed by other labels, over the next few years until it returned as a spiritual/yogic label run by Rienstra. The third label, Black Arc, was an associated label of Rykodisc focusing on &quot;Black Rock, Cyber Funk, and Future Blues&quot;, according to a sampler. The label featured members of P-Funk on most of the albums and released albums by Bootsy Collins (under the name &quot;Zillatron&quot;), Bernie Worrell (Japan-only), Mutiny (Jerome Brailey), and Billy Bass.

&quot;Charged&quot; (1999) by Eraldo Bernocchi and Toshinori Kondo was released by Laswell&#x27;s label Innerythmic. After a brief inactive period, the label restarted in 2001, releasing over the next few years and albums by Nicky Skopelitis, Raoul Björkenheim, James Blood Ulmer, Shin Terai, and Gonervill. Innerhythmic also released a live recording by Praxis and reissued Black Arc albums from the 1990, including Zillatron, The Last Poets&#x27; &quot;Holy Terror&quot; and Buddy Miles&#x27; &quot;Hell &amp; Back&quot;.

Laswell moved his studio to West Orange, New Jersey and called it Orange Music Sound Studios. Under Palm&#x27;s umbrella, though, four albums and a DVD set were released, including a studio album and a live 2-disc set from Tabla Beat Science centered on tabla virtuoso Zakir Hussain, son of Alla Rakha. The album included Karsh Kale, Trilok Gurtu, Ustad Sultan Khan, and Talvin Singh. This group has performed in the US, Lebanon, and Japan. Laswell, Kale, Kahn, and Hussain are usually supplemented by other musicians, which have included Gigi, DJ Disk, Serj Tankian from System of a Down, Sussan Deyhim, and artist Petulia Mattioli. In 2001 &quot;Life Space Death&quot; was released with Japanese trumpeter Toshinori Kondo, Laswell on bass, guitar, and keyboards, and words by the 14th Dalai Lama interviewed by Kondo. At the request of Blackwell, Laswell oversaw the debut album by Ethiopian singer Gigi for Palm Pictures with Wayne Shorter, Herbie Hancock, and Laswell. He also produced &quot;Abyssinia Infinite&quot; and &quot;Gold &amp; Wax&quot;.

Laswell has stated in interviews that he met with Miles Davis a number of times and discussed working together, but busy schedules kept them from arranging such a recording before Davis&#x27; death. He remixed some of Davis&#x27;s music for &quot;&quot; (Axiom, 1998).

===New century, new labels===
He signed a contract with Sanctuary Records that led to the creation of his label Nagual. He worked in the drum and bass genre, starting with &quot;Brutal Calling&quot; credited to Bill Laswell vs. Submerged that was released by Avant in 2004. He and Submerged worked together again on &quot;The Only Way to Go is Down&quot; (2006) under the name Method of Defiance. After this album, they assembled producers in drum and bass to collaborate with musicians from jazz. Evol Intent, Future Prophecies, and SPL recorded with Buckethead, Herbie Hancock, and Pharoah Sanders.

In 2010, Laswell created the label M.O.D. Technologies. Its first releases were the albums &quot;Jahbulon&quot; and &quot;Incunabula&quot; by Method of Defiance and &quot;Mesgana Ethiopia&quot; by Material with Gigi.

Along with live dates around the world with Massacre, Material, Method of Defiance, and Painkiller, Laswell travels to Japan every year for recordings and live dates, including with Tokyo Rotation.

In November 2018, he performed in Dave Douglas Uplift band at the London Jazz Festival.

Laswell suffered health problems which required hospitalization in December 2022 and prolonged recovery, which jeopardized his tenure of Orange Music Studio.

Prior to his health problems, Laswell had been recording as a duo with his long-time on-and-off collaborator Zorn releasing the albums &quot;The Cleansing&quot; (2022) and &quot;Memoria&quot; (2023) on Zorn&#x27;s Tzadik label. His first venture during his health recovery in 2024 was a new Painkiller album titled &quot;Samsara&quot; with Zorn and original drummer Harris, although for this recording Harris&#x27; percussion is electronic and Zorn then Laswell layered up their contributions separately.

===Collaborators===
Laswell works frequently with a small group of collaborators. These include bassists Jah Wobble, Josh Werner, Jonas Hellborg, and Bootsy Collins; guitarists Buckethead and Nicky Skopelitis; keyboardists Jeff Bova and Bernie Worrell; percussionists Aïyb Dieng and Karsh Kale, and musicians from P-Funk. Robert Musso has been his chief engineer for over twenty years. Oz Fritz has occasionally filled the role. Fritz is usually Laswell&#x27;s live engineer of choice, known for live mixing technique. Remixes have been done for Sting, Nine Inch Nails, Almamegretta, Scorn, Ozzy Osbourne, and Tori Amos. He has done much work for John Zorn&#x27;s Tzadik Records.

In 2005, Laswell was invited to appear on the PBS series &quot;Soundstage&quot;. The show featured musicians he has played with over the years, including members of Praxis and Tabla Beat Science, Pharoah Sanders, Foday Musa Suso, Bootsy Collins, and Catfish Collins.

Laswell worked with Sony Creative Software on a box set loop library called &quot;The Bill Laswell Collection&quot;.

He has also worked with Eraldo Bernocchi and Mick Harris on a project called &quot;Equations of Eternity&quot;, which is an ambient music project started in 1995 by Eraldo. Since its members live in separate parts of the world (Mick Harris in England; Bill Laswell in the US; and Eraldo Bernocchi in Italy), the project has been predominantly studio-based, with its members recording music in their respective countries.

<text>Green tea is a type of tea made from the leaves and buds of the &quot;Camellia sinensis&quot; that have not undergone the withering and oxidation process that creates oolong teas and black teas. Green tea originated in China in the late 1st millennium BC, and since then its production and manufacture has spread to other countries in East Asia.

Several varieties of green tea exist, which differ substantially based on the variety of &quot;C. sinensis&quot; used, growing conditions, horticultural methods, production processing, and time of harvest.

==History==

Tea consumption has its legendary origins in China during the reign of mythological Emperor Shennong.

A book written by Lu Yu in 618–907 AD, &quot;The Classic of Tea&quot; (), is considered important in green tea history. The &quot;Book of Tea&quot; (&quot;Kissa Yōjōki&quot;, lit. &quot;Record [of] Drinking Tea [for] Nourishing Life&quot;), written by Zen priest Eisai in 1211, describes how drinking green tea may affect five vital organs, the shapes of tea plants, flowers and leaves, and how to grow and process tea leaves.

==Steeping, brewing and serving==
Steeping, or brewing, is the process of making tea from leaves and hot water, generally using of tea per of water or about 1 teaspoon of green tea per cup. Steeping temperatures range from to and steeping times from 30 seconds to three minutes.

Generally, lower-quality green teas are steeped hotter and longer while higher-quality teas are steeped cooler and shorter, but usually multiple times (2–3 typically). Higher-quality teas like gyokuro use more tea leaves and are steeped multiple times for short durations. Steeping too hot or too long results in the release of excessive amounts of tannins, leading to a bitter, astringent brew, regardless of initial quality. The brew&#x27;s taste is also affected by the steeping technique; two important techniques are to warm the steeping container beforehand to prevent the tea from immediately cooling down, and to leave the tea leaves in the pot and gradually add more hot water during consumption.

==Extracts==

Polyphenols found in green tea include epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), epicatechin gallate, epicatechins and flavanols, which are under laboratory research for their potential effects in vivo. Other components include three kinds of flavonoids, known as kaempferol, quercetin, and myricetin. Although the mean content of flavonoids and catechins in a cup of green tea is higher than that in the same volume of other food and drink items that are traditionally considered to promote health, flavonoids and catechins have no proven biological effect in humans.

Green tea leaves are initially processed by soaking in an alcohol solution, which may be further concentrated to various levels; byproducts of the process are also packaged and used. Extracts are sold over the counter in liquid, powder, capsule, and tablet forms, and may contain up to 17.4% of their total weight in caffeine, though decaffeinated versions are also available.

Green tea extract is usable as a clean label food preservative, protecting fats from rancidity. The oil-soluble form used is palmitoylated green tea catechins, ruled generally recognized as safe in 2020.

==Health effects ==

Regular green tea is 99.9% water, provides 1 kcal per 100 mL serving, is devoid of significant nutrient content (table), and contains phytochemicals such as polyphenols and caffeine.

Numerous claims have been made for the health benefits of green tea, but human clinical research has not found good evidence of benefit. In 2011, a panel of scientists published a report on the claims for health effects at the request of the European Commission: in general they found that the claims made for green tea were not supported by sufficient scientific evidence. Although green tea may enhance mental alertness due to its caffeine content, there is only weak, inconclusive evidence that regular consumption of green tea affects the risk of cancer or cardiovascular diseases, and there is no evidence that it benefits weight loss.

In some cases of excessive consumption, green tea extract is hepatotoxic with evidence of liver damage. A 2020 review by the Cochrane Collaboration listed some potential adverse effects of green tea extract including gastrointestinal disorders, higher levels of liver enzymes, and, more rarely, insomnia, raised blood pressure, and skin reactions.

===Cancer===

Cancer Council Australia and Cancer Research UK have stated that there is not enough reliable evidence that green tea can prevent cancer. The National Cancer Institute have noted that &quot;the evidence regarding the potential benefits of tea consumption in relation to cancer is inconclusive at present&quot;.

Green tea interferes with the chemotherapy drug bortezomib (Velcade) and other boronic acid-based proteasome inhibitors, and should be avoided by people taking these medications.

===Cardiovascular disease===
A meta-analysis of observational studies reported an increase in one cup of green tea per day was correlated with slightly lower risk of death from cardiovascular causes. Green tea consumption may be correlated with a reduced risk of stroke. Meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials found that green tea consumption for 3–6 months may produce small reductions (about 2–3 mm Hg each) in systolic and diastolic blood pressures. A separate systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials found that consumption of 5–6 cups of green tea per day was associated with a small reduction in systolic blood pressure (2 mmHg), but did not lead to a significant difference in diastolic blood pressure.

===Glycemic control===
Green tea consumption lowers fasting blood sugar but in clinical studies the beverage&#x27;s effect on haemoglobin A1c and fasting insulin levels was inconsistent.

===Hyperlipidemia===
Drinking green tea or taking green tea supplements decreases the blood concentration of total cholesterol (about 3–7 mg/dL), LDL cholesterol (about 2 mg/dL), and does not affect the concentration of HDL cholesterol or triglycerides. A 2013 Cochrane meta-analysis of longer-term randomized controlled trials (&gt;3 months duration) concluded that green tea consumption lowers total and LDL cholesterol concentrations in the blood.

===Inflammation===
A 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis of 11 randomized controlled trials found that green tea consumption was not significantly associated with lower plasma levels of C-reactive protein levels (a marker of inflammation).

===Weight loss===
There is no good evidence that green tea aids in weight loss or weight maintenance.

===Potential for liver toxicity===
Excessive consumption of green tea extract has been associated with hepatotoxicity and liver failure. In 2018, a scientific panel for the European Food Safety Authority reviewed the safety of green tea consumption over a low-moderate range of daily EGCG intake from 90 to 300 mg per day, and with exposure from high green tea consumption estimated to supply up to 866 mg EGCG per day. Dietary supplements containing EGCG may supply up to 1000 mg EGCG and other catechins per day. The panel concluded that EGCG and other catechins from green tea in low-moderate daily amounts are generally regarded as safe, but in some cases of excessive consumption of green tea or use of high-EGCG supplements, liver toxicity may occur.

==Production==
In 2013, global production of green tea was approximately 1.7 million tonnes, with a forecast to double in volume by 2023. As of 2015, China provided 80% of the world&#x27;s green tea market, leading to its green tea exports rising by 9% annually, while exporting 325,000 tonnes in 2015. In 2015, the US was the largest importer of Chinese green tea (6,800 tonnes), an increase of 10% over 2014, and Britain imported 1,900 tonnes, 15% more than in 2014.

===Growing, harvesting and processing===

Green tea is processed and grown in a variety of ways, depending on the type of green tea desired. As a result of these methods, maximum amounts of polyphenols and volatile organic compounds are retained, affecting aroma and taste. The growing conditions can be broken down into two basic types − those grown in the sun and those grown under the shade. The green tea plants are grown in rows that are pruned to produce shoots in a regular manner, and in general are harvested three times per year. The first flush takes place in late April to early May. The second harvest usually takes place from June through July, and the third picking takes place in late July to early August. Sometimes, there will also be a fourth harvest. The first flush in the spring brings the best-quality leaves, with higher prices to match.

Green tea is processed after picking using either artisanal or modern methods. Sun-drying, basket or charcoal firing, or pan-firing are common artisanal methods. Oven-drying, tumbling, or steaming are common modern methods. Processed green teas, known as &quot;aracha&quot;, are stored under low humidity refrigeration in 30- or 60-kilogram paper bags at . This aracha has yet to be refined at this stage, with a final firing taking place before blending, selection and packaging take place. The leaves in this state will be re-fired throughout the year as they are needed, giving the green teas a longer shelf-life and better flavour. The first flush tea of May will readily store in this fashion until the next year&#x27;s harvest. After this re-drying process, each crude tea will be sifted and graded according to size. Finally, each lot will be blended according to the blending order by the tasters and packed for sale.

===Import of radioactive Japanese tea===
On 17 June 2011, at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris, France, radioactive caesium of 1,038 becquerels per kilogram was measured in tea leaves imported from Shizuoka Prefecture, Japan as a result of the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster on 11 March, which was more than twice the restricted amount in the European Union of 500 becquerels per kilogram. The government of France announced that they rejected the leaves, which totalled .

In response, the governor of Shizuoka Prefecture, Heita Kawakatsu, stated: &quot;there is absolutely no problem when they [people] drink them because it will be diluted to about 10 becquerels per kilogram when they steep them even if the leaves have 1,000 becquerels per kilogram;&quot; a statement backed by tests done in Shizuoka. Japanese Minister for Consumer Affairs and Food Safety Renhō stated on 3 June 2011 that &quot;there are cases in which &quot;aracha&quot; [whole leaves of Japanese green tea] are sold as &quot;furikake&quot; [condiments sprinkled on rice] and so on and they are eaten as they are, therefore we think that it is important to inspect tea leaves including aracha from the viewpoint of consumers&#x27; safety.&quot;

In 2018, the US Food and Drug Administration updated its import status on Japanese products deemed to be contaminated by radionuclides, indicating that tea from the Ibaraki prefecture had been removed from the list by the Government of Japan in 2015.

== Green tea across East Asia ==
=== Mainland China and Taiwan ===


Loose leaf green tea has been the most popular form of tea in China since at least the Southern Song dynasty. While Chinese green tea was originally steamed, as it still is in Japan, after the early Ming dynasty it has typically been processed by being pan-fired in a dry wok. Other processes employed in China today include oven-firing, basket-firing, tumble-drying and sun-drying. Green tea is the most widely produced form of tea in China, with 1.42 million tons grown in 2014.

Popular green teas produced in China today include:
* &quot;Biluochun&quot; (碧螺春) Produced in Jiangsu, this tea is named after the shape of the leaves, which are curled like snails.
* &quot;Chun Mee&quot; (珍眉) Known in English by its Cantonese name, and popular outside China. It has a plum-like flavour.
*&quot;Zhū chá&quot; (珠茶) &quot;Pearl tea&quot;, also called Gunpowder tea, is a form of tea which is tumble-dried so that each leaf is rolled into a small pellet that resembles gunpowder.
* &quot;Huangshan Maofeng&quot; (黄山毛峰) A type of &quot;maofeng&quot; tea grown in the microclimate of the Huangshan mountain range in Anhui province. &quot;Maofeng&quot; teas are harvested by plucking intact two equal-sized leaves and a bud together.
* &quot;Longjing&quot; (龍井茶) Also known as &quot;Dragon Well&quot; tea, the English translation of its name. Grown near Hangzhou in Zhejiang province, Longjing is the most well-known pan-fired Chinese green tea. Its flavour derives partly from the terroir of the region in which it is produced.
* &quot;Lu&#x27;an Melon Seed&quot; (六安瓜片) Grown in Anhui province. Unlike typical Chinese teas, two leaves are plucked separately from each branch, with no bud and no stems. Harvested later in the season, it has a grassier flavour than typical Chinese green teas.
* &quot;Taiping Houkui&quot; (太平猴魁) Grown in Anhui province. Uses a cultivar with an unusually large leaf. The production process flattens the tea leaves, creating the so-called &quot;two knives and a pole&quot; shape from the leaves and stem.
* &quot;Xinyang Maojian&quot; (信陽毛尖) A type of &quot;maojian&quot; tea grown in Xinyang, Henan province. &quot;Maojian&quot; teas are harvested by plucking a bud and one leaf together.

=== Japan ===


Tea seeds were first brought to Japan in the early 9th century by the Buddhist monks Saicho and Kūkai. During the Heian period (794–1185), Emperor Saga introduced the practice of drinking tea to the imperial family. The Zen Buddhist priest Eisai (1141–1215), founder of the Rinzai school of Buddhism, brought tea seeds from China to plant in various places in Japan. Eisai advocated that all people, not just Buddhist monks and the elite, drink tea for its health benefits.

The oldest tea-producing region in Japan is Uji, located near the former capital of Kyoto. It is thought that seeds sent by Eisai were planted in Uji, becoming the basis of the tea industry there. Today, Japan&#x27;s most expensive premium teas are still grown in Uji. The largest tea-producing area today is Shizuoka Prefecture, which accounts for 40% of total Japanese sencha production. Other major tea-producing regions include the island of Kyushu and the prefectures of Shiga, Gifu, and Saitama in central Honshu.

All commercial tea produced in Japan today is green tea, though for a brief period black tea was also produced in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Japanese tea production is heavily mechanized, and is characterized by the use of modern technology and processes to improve yields and reduce labour. Because of the high cost of labour in Japan, only the highest quality teas are plucked and processed by hand in the traditional fashion.

Japanese green teas have a thin, needle-like shape and a rich, dark green colour. Unlike Chinese teas, most Japanese teas are produced by steaming rather than pan-firing. This produces their characteristic colour, and creates a sweeter, more grassy flavour. A mechanical rolling/drying process then dries the tea leaves into their final shape. The liquor of steamed Japanese tea tends to be cloudy due to the higher quantity of dissolved solids.

Most Japanese teas are blended from leaves grown in different regions, with less emphasis on terroir than in the Chinese market. Because of the limited quantity of tea that can be produced in Japan, the majority of production is dedicated to the premium tea market. Cheaper bottled teas and tea-flavoured food products usually use lower-grade Japanese-style tea produced in China.

Although a variety of commercial tea cultivars exist in Japan, the vast majority of Japanese tea is produced using the &quot;Yabukita&quot; cultivar developed in the 1950s.

Popular Japanese green teas include:
* &quot;Bancha&quot; (番茶) A lower-grade tea plucked from the same bushes used to produce &quot;sencha&quot;. It has a somewhat bolder flavour, and is plucked each season after &quot;sencha&quot; production is finished.
* &quot;Genmaicha&quot; (玄米茶) Made by combining &quot;sencha&quot; tea leaves with toasted puffs of rice.
* &quot;Gyokuro&quot; (玉露) Grown under shade for three weeks prior to plucking, &quot;gyokuro&quot; is one of the most exclusive varieties of tea produced in Japan. The shading technique imparts a sweeter flavour, and produces a particularly rich colour thanks to the higher amounts of chlorophyll in the shaded leaf. &quot;Gyokuro&quot; tea is associated with the Uji region, the first tea-growing region in Japan. It is often made using smaller-leaf cultivars of the tea plant.
* &quot;Hōjicha&quot; (焙じ茶) This type of tea is made by roasting &quot;sencha&quot; or &quot;bancha&quot; leaves with &quot;kukicha&quot; twigs.
* &quot;Kabusecha&quot; (かぶせ茶) Similar to &quot;gyokuro&quot;, kabusecha is shaded for only a week prior to plucking. Its flavour is somewhat between that of &quot;gyokuro&quot; and normal &quot;sencha&quot;.
* &quot;Kukicha&quot; (茎茶) A blended tea made of &quot;sencha&quot; leaves and stems.
* &quot;Matcha&quot; (抹茶) Like &quot;gyokuro&quot;, &quot;matcha&quot; is shaded before plucking. The plucked and processed leaf is called &quot;tencha&quot;. This product is then ground into a fine powder, which is &quot;matcha&quot;. Because the tea powder is very perishable, &quot;matcha&quot; is usually sold in small quantities. It is typically rather expensive. &quot;Matcha&quot; is the type of tea used in the Japanese tea ceremony. It is prepared by whisking the tea with hot water in a bowl, until the surface is frothy. If the water is too hot, the tea may become overly bitter.
* &quot;Sencha&quot; (煎茶) This type of tea is produced throughout the tea season, and is the standard style today, representing 80% of all tea produced in Japan. 90% of &quot;sencha&quot; is grown from the &quot;Yabukita&quot; cultivar.
* &quot;Shincha&quot; (新茶) The first early harvest of tea, plucked before the first flush, is called &quot;shincha&quot;. &quot;Shincha&quot; is made from the youngest new growth leaves, and is plucked from early April to early May. &quot;Shincha&quot; typically refers to the early harvest of &quot;sencha&quot;, but can refer to any type of tea plucked early in the season, before the main harvest. Because of the limited quantities in which it is produced, &quot;shincha&quot; is highly prized and expensive to obtain.

=== Korea ===


According to &quot;Record of Gaya&quot; cited in &quot;Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, the legendary queen Heo Hwang-ok, a princess of the Ayodhya married to King Suro of Gaya, brought the tea plant from India and planted it in Baegwolsan, a mountain in current Changwon. However, it is a widely held view that systematic planting of tea bushes began with the introduction of Chinese tea culture by the Buddhist monks around the 4th century. Amongst some of the earliest Buddhist temples in Korea, Bulgapsa (founded in 384, in Yeonggwang), Bulhoesa (founded in 384, in Naju) and Hwaeomsa (founded in Gurye, in 544) claim to be the birthplace of Korean tea culture. Green tea was commonly offered to Buddha, as well as to the spirits of deceased ancestors. Tea culture continued to prosper during the Goryeo period, with the tea offering being a part of the biggest national ceremonies and tea towns were formed around temples. Seon-Buddhist manners of ceremony prevailed. During the Joseon period, however, Korean tea culture underwent secularization, along with the Korean culture itself. Korean ancestral rite &quot;jesa&quot;, also referred to as &quot;charye&quot; (, &quot;tea rite&quot;), has its origin in &quot;darye&quot; (, &quot;tea rite&quot;), the practice of offering tea as simple ancestral rites by the royal family and the aristocracy in Joseon.

Tea culture of Korea was actively suppressed by the Japanese during the Japanese forced occupation period (1910‒1945), and the subsequent Korean War (1950‒1953) made it even harder for the Korean tea tradition to survive. The restoration of the Korean way of tea began in the 1970s, around Dasolsa. Commercial production of green tea in South Korea only began in the 1970s. By 2012 the industry was producing 20% as much tea as Taiwan and 3.5% as much as Japan. Green tea is not as popular as coffee or other types of Korean teas in modern South Korea. The annual consumption per capita of green tea in South Korea in 2016 was , compared to coffee. Recently however, as the coffee market reached saturation point, South Korean tea production doubled during 2010‒2014, as did tea imports during 2009–2015, despite very high tariff rate (513.6% for green tea, compared to 40% for black tea, 8% for processed/roasted coffee, and 2% for raw coffee beans).

Korean green tea can be classified into various types based on several different factors. The most common is the flush, or the time of the year when the leaves are plucked (and thus also by leaf size).
* &quot;Ujeon&quot;&quot;Ujeon&quot; (), or &quot;cheonmul-cha&quot; (), is made of hand-picked leaves plucked before &quot;gogu&quot; (20–21 April). The ideal steeping temperature for &quot;ujeon&quot; tea is .
* &quot;Sejak&quot;&quot;Sejak&quot; (), or &quot;dumul-cha&quot; (), is made of hand-picked leaves plucked after &quot;gogu&quot; (20–21 April) but before &quot;ipha&quot; (5–6 May). The tea is also called &quot;jakseol&quot; () as the tea leaves are plucked when they are about the size of a sparrow&#x27;s tongue. The ideal steeping temperature for &quot;sejak&quot; tea is .
* &quot;Jungjak&quot;&quot;Jungjak&quot; (), or &quot;semul-cha&quot; (), is made of leaves plucked after &quot;ipha&quot; (5–6 May) until the mid May. The ideal steeping temperature for &quot;jungjak&quot; tea is .
* &quot;Daejak&quot;&quot;Daejak&quot; (), or &quot;kkeunmul-cha&quot; (), is made of tea leaves plucked in late May and after. It is usually made into tea bags or used in cooking. The ideal steeping temperature for &quot;daejak&quot; tea is .

The mode of preparation also differs:
* &quot;Ipcha&quot; (&quot;yeopcha&quot;)The synonyms &quot;ipcha&quot; () and &quot;yeopcha&quot; () refer to loose leaf tea, often in contrast to tea in tea bags. As the words mean &quot;leaf tea&quot;, they can also be used in contrast to powdered tea.
* &quot;Garucha&quot; (&quot;malcha&quot;)The synonyms &quot;garucha&quot; () and &quot;malcha&quot; () refer to powdered tea.

Leaf teas are processed either by roasting or steaming.
* &quot;Deokkeum-cha&quot; (&quot;bucho-cha&quot;)Roasting is the most common and traditional way of tea processing in Korea. Also translated into &quot;pan-fried tea&quot;, the &quot;deokkeum-cha&quot; () or &quot;bucho-cha&quot; () varieties are richer in flavour.
* &quot;Jeungje-cha&quot;Steaming is less popular in Korean green tea processing, but the method is still used in temple cuisine. Tea prepared with steamed tea leaves, called &quot;jeungje-cha&quot; (), are more vivid in colour.

Southern, warmer regions such as Boseong in South Jeolla Province, Hadong in South Gyeongsang Province, and Jeju Island are famous for producing high-quality tea leaves.
* &quot;Banya-cha&quot;&quot;Banya-cha&quot; () is one of the most renowned Korean green teas. This steamed tea is developed by Buddhist monks in Boseong. The tea is grown on sandy loam near mountains and sea. The word &quot;banya&quot; is a Korean transliteration of the Buddhist concept &quot;prajñā&quot;. 
* &quot;Jungno-cha&quot;&quot;Jungno-cha&quot; () is one of the most renowned Korean green teas. The roasted variety of tea is made of tea leaves grown among the bamboo in Gimhae, Hadong, and Jinju in South Gyeongsang Province.
Green tea can be blended with other ingredients.
* &quot;Hyeonmi-nokcha&quot;&quot;Nokcha&quot; (green tea) blended with &quot;hyeonmi-cha&quot; (brown rice tea) is called &quot;hyeonmi-nokcha&quot; ().
* &quot;Remon-nokcha&quot; &quot;Nokcha&quot; (green tea) blended with lemon is called &quot;remon-nokcha&quot; ().

=== Vietnam ===

Green tea is the most popular tea among the Vietnamese people. In 2011, it accounted for over 63% of overall retail volume sales. Vietnamese tea culture is ancient, but large scale cultivation was introduced in the late 19th century by French colonists who ran the first plantations in the Phú Thọ area.

Though less well known than Japanese and Chinese green teas, there are various types of Vietnamese green tea and various cultivars. They have recently entered the international market, usually at lower prices. Vietnam is fifth in the world for tea production today.

There is a long tradition of growing and processing green tea in the Thái Nguyên area, north of Hanoi, which has been called the &quot;cradle&quot; of Vietnamese tea. This region is now known for its green tea, which is shipped internationally.

There are also many scented varieties of Vietnamese green tea, most of which are scented with a certain flower petals. These include:

* Lotus tea (&quot;trà sen&quot;), scented with Lotus flowers, sometimes the petals will be mixed into the tea leaves.
* Jasmine tea (&quot;trà lài&quot;), scented with jasmine
* Chrysanthemum tea (&quot;trà cúc&quot;)
* Aglaia tea (&quot;trà ngâu&quot;, tea infused with the flower from the Aglaia duperreana plant)
* &quot;Trà sói&quot;, tea infused with the flower from the Chloranthaceae family.
* &quot;Trà sâm dứa&quot;, made from a herbal mix of green tea, jasmine, Aglaia duperreana flower, basil and pandan leaves.

<text>Flanging is an audio effect produced by mixing two identical signals together, one signal delayed by a small and (usually) gradually changing period, usually smaller than 20 milliseconds. This produces a swept comb filter effect: peaks and notches are produced in the resulting frequency spectrum, related to each other in a linear harmonic series. Varying the time delay causes these to sweep up and down the frequency spectrum. A flanger is an effects unit that creates this effect.

Part of the output signal is usually fed back to the input (a re-circulating delay line), producing a resonance effect that further enhances the intensity of the peaks and troughs. The phase of the fed-back signal is sometimes inverted, producing another variation on the flanger sound.

==Origin==
As an audio effect, a listener hears a &quot;drainpipe&quot; or &quot;swoosh&quot; or &quot;jet plane&quot; sweeping effect as shifting sum-and-difference harmonics are created analogous to use of a variable notch filter. The term &quot;flanging&quot; comes from one of the early methods of producing the effect. The finished music track is recorded simultaneously to two matching tape machines, then replayed with both decks in sync. The output from the two recorders is mixed to a third recorder. The engineer slows down one playback recorder by lightly pressing a finger on the flange (rim) of the supply reel. The &quot;drainpipe&quot; or subtle &quot;swoosh&quot; effect &quot;sweeps&quot; in one direction, and the playback of that recorder remains slightly behind the other when the finger is removed. By pressing a finger on the flange of the other deck, the effect sweeps back in the other direction as the decks progress towards being in sync. The Beatles&#x27; producer George Martin disputed this &quot;reel flange&quot; source, attributing the term to himself and John Lennon instead.

Despite claims over who originated flanging, Les Paul discovered the effect in the late 1940s and 1950s; however, he did most of his early phasing experiments with acetate disks on variable-speed record players. On &quot;Mammy&#x27;s Boogie&quot; (1952) he used two disk recorders, one with a variable speed control. The first hit song with a very discernible flanging effect was &quot;The Big Hurt&quot; (1959) by Toni Fisher.

Further development of the classic effect is attributed to Ken Townsend, an engineer at EMI&#x27;s Abbey Road Studio, who devised a process in the spring of 1966. Tired of laboriously re-recording dual vocal tracks, John Lennon asked Townsend if there was some way for the Beatles to get the sound of double-tracked vocals without doing the work. Townsend devised automatic double tracking (ADT). According to historian Mark Lewisohn, it was Lennon who first called the technique &quot;flanging&quot;. Lennon asked George Martin to explain how ADT worked, and Martin answered with the nonsense explanation &quot;Now listen, it&#x27;s very simple. We take the original image and we split it through a double vibrocated sploshing flange with double negative feedback&quot;. Lennon thought Martin was joking. Martin replied, &quot;Well, let&#x27;s flange it again and see&quot;. From that point, when Lennon wanted ADT he would ask for his voice to be flanged, or call out for &quot;Ken&#x27;s flanger&quot;. According to Lewisohn, the Beatles&#x27; influence meant the term &quot;flanging&quot; is still in use today, more than 50 years later. The first Beatles track to feature flanging was &quot;Tomorrow Never Knows&quot; from &quot;Revolver&quot;, recorded on 6 April 1966. When &quot;Revolver&quot; was released on 5 August 1966, almost every song had been subjected to flanging.

Others have attributed it to George Chkiantz, an engineer at Olympic Studios in Barnes, London. Another flanging instance on a rock-era pop recording occurs in the Small Faces&#x27; 1967 single &quot;Itchycoo Park&quot;, recorded at Olympic and engineered by Chkiantz&#x27;s colleague Glyn Johns.

The first stereo flanging is credited to producer Eddie Kramer, in the coda of Jimi Hendrix&#x27;s &quot;Bold as Love&quot; (1967). Kramer said in the 1990s that he read BBC Radiophonic Workshop journals for ideas and circuit diagrams.
In 1968, the record producer for the Litter, Warren Kendrick, devised a method to precisely control flanging by placing two 15 ips (inches per second) stereo Ampex tape recorders side by side. The take-up reel of recorder A and supply reel of B were disabled, as were channel 2 of recorder A, channel 1 of recorder B and the erase head of recorder B. The tape was fed left-to-right across &quot;both&quot; recorders and an identical signal was recorded on each channel of the tape, but displaced by approximately 18 inches along the length of the tape. During recording, an ordinary screwdriver was wedged between the recorders to make the tape run &quot;uphill&quot; and &quot;downhill.&quot; The same configuration was employed during the playback/mixdown to a third recorder. The screwdriver was moved back and forth to cause the two signals to diverge, then converge. The latter technique permits zero point flanging; i.e., the lagging signal crosses over the leading signal and the signals change places.

A similar &quot;jet plane-like&quot; effect can occur naturally in long distance shortwave radio music broadcasts. In this case the delays are caused by variable radio wave propagation time and multipath radio interference.

==Artificial flanging==
In the 1970s, advances in solid-state electronics made flanging possible using integrated circuit technology. Solid-state flanging devices fall into two categories: analog and digital. The Eventide Instant Flanger from 1975 is an early example of a studio device that was able to successfully simulate tape flanging using bucket-brigades to create the audio delay. The flanging effect in most newer digital flangers relies on DSP technology. Flanging can also be accomplished using computer software.

The original tape-flanging effect sounds a little different from electronic and software recreations. Not only is the tape-flanging signal time-delayed, but response characteristics at different frequencies of the tape and tape heads introduced phase shifts into the signals as well. Thus, while the peaks and troughs of the comb filter are more or less in a linear harmonic series, there is a significant non-linear behaviour too, causing the timbre of tape-flanging to sound more like a combination of what came to be known as flanging and phasing.

===&quot;Barber pole&quot; flanging===
Also known as &quot;infinite flanging&quot;, this sonic illusion is similar to the Shepard tone effect, and is equivalent to an auditory &quot;barber pole&quot;. The sweep of the flanged sound seems to move in only one direction (&quot;up&quot; or &quot;down&quot;) infinitely, instead of sweeping back-and-forth. While Shepard tones are created by generating a cascade of tones, fading in and out while sweeping the pitch either up or down, barber pole flanging uses a cascade of multiple delay lines, fading each one into the mix and fading it out as it sweeps to the delay time limit. The effect is available on various hardware and software effect systems.

== Comparison with phase shifting ==

Flanging is one specific type of phase-shifting, or &quot;phasing&quot;. In phasing, the signal is passed through one or more all-pass filters with non-linear phase response and then added back to the original signal. This results in constructive and destructive interference that varies with frequency, giving a series of peaks and troughs in the frequency response of the system. In general, the position of these peaks and troughs do not occur in a harmonic series.

In contrast, flanging relies on adding the signal to a uniform time-delayed copy of itself, which results in an output signal with peaks and troughs which &quot;are&quot; in a harmonic series. Extending the comb analogy, flanging yields a comb filter with regularly spaced teeth, whereas phasing results in a comb filter with irregularly spaced teeth.

In both phasing and flanging, the characteristics (phase response and time delay respectively) are generally varied in time, leading to an audible sweeping effect. To the ear, flanging and phasing sound similar, yet they are recognizable as distinct colorations. Commonly, flanging is referred to as having a &quot;jet-plane-like&quot; characteristic. In order for the comb filter effect to be audible, the spectral content of the program material must be full enough within the frequency range of this moving comb filter to reveal the filter&#x27;s effect. It is more apparent when it is applied to material with a rich harmonic content, and is most obvious when applied to a white noise or similar noise signal. If the frequency response of this effect is plotted on a linearly-scaled graph, the trace resembles a comb, and so is called a comb filter.

<text>Lotus position or Padmasana () is a cross-legged sitting meditation pose from ancient India, in which each foot is placed on the opposite thigh. It is an ancient asana in yoga, predating hatha yoga, and is widely used for meditation in Hindu, Tantra, Jain, and Buddhist traditions.

Variations include easy pose (Sukhasana), half lotus, bound lotus, and psychic union pose. Advanced variations of several other asanas including yoga headstand have the legs in lotus or half lotus. The pose can be uncomfortable for people not used to sitting on the floor, and attempts to force the legs into position can injure the knees.

Shiva, the meditating ascetic God of Hinduism, Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, and the Tirthankaras in Jainism have been depicted in the lotus position, especially in statues. The pose is emblematic both of Buddhist meditation and of yoga, and as such has found a place in Western culture as a symbol of healthy living and well-being.

== Etymology and history==
The name Padmasana is from the Sanskrit पद्म &quot;Padma&quot;, &quot;lotus&quot; and आसन, Āsana, &quot;posture&quot; or &quot;seat&quot;. In Asian cultures, the sacred lotus is used as a symbol of growth towards perfection and enlightenment as it is rooted in the mud at the bottom of the pond, but rises and blooms above the water. In Chinese and Tibetan Buddhism, the pose is also called the &quot;vajra position&quot; (Skt. &quot;vajrāsana&quot;, Ch. 金剛座 &quot;jīngāngzuò&quot;).

The pose is ancient and is described, along with other asanas (sitting postures), in the 8th century book &quot;Patanjalayogashastravivarana&quot;. A figure seated in lotus position on a lotus flower is shown on dinar coins of Chandragupta II, who reigned c. 380–c. 415 AD. The first tantric text to discuss posture (asana), the 6th-10th century &quot;Nisvasattvasamhita Nayasutra&quot; (4.11-17, 4.104-106), directs the meditator and &quot;user of mantras&quot; to sit in lotus or a similar posture. The 15th century &quot;Hatha Yoga Pradipika&quot; states that the pose destroys all diseases, and that a yogin in the pose who retains the air breathed in through the nadi channels attains liberation.

Sukhasana is from Sanskrit सुख &quot;sukha&quot;, meaning &quot;pleasure&quot; or &quot;ease&quot;. The 19th century &quot;Sritattvanidhi&quot; describes and illustrates the pose. The name, and the more general name Yogasana (&quot;Yoga pose&quot;) which may denote a variety of sitting poses, is found in much older documents as a meditation seat, such as in the 4th century &quot;Darshana Upanishad&quot;.

== Position ==

From sitting cross-legged on the floor (Sukhasana), one foot is placed on top of the opposite thigh with its sole facing upward and heel close to the abdomen. The other foot is then placed on the opposite thigh as symmetrically as possible. The pose requires &quot;very open hips&quot;. It can be modified using a support such as a cushion or blanket; by sitting on its forward edge, the pelvis is tilted forward.

==Variations==

Sukhasana (), Easy Pose, has the legs simply crossed in front of the body.

In half lotus, अर्ध पद्मासन (Ardha Padmasana), one leg is bent and resting on the ground, the other leg is bent with the foot in lotus position. It is an easier meditation position than full lotus.

In bound lotus, बद्ध पद्मासन (Baddha Padmasana), the practitioner sits in full lotus, and each hand reaches around the back to grasp the opposite foot.

For psychic union pose, योगमुद्रासन (Yogamudrasana), the practitioner bends forward in full lotus, bringing the forehead as close to the floor as possible. The pose is both an asana and a mudra; easier variants begin from Ardha Padmasana.

Variations of several other asanas such as Sirsasana (yoga headstand), Sarvangasana (shoulderstand), Simhasana (lion pose), Matsyasana (fish pose), and Gorakshasana (cowherd pose) have the legs in lotus. Asanas such as Vatayanasana (horse pose) and advanced forms of Ardha Matsyendrasana (half lord of the fishes pose) have one leg as in half lotus.

==Effects==

Lotus is one of the yoga poses that most commonly causes injury. Attempts to force the legs into lotus pose can injure the knees by squeezing and damaging the medial meniscus cartilage; this is painful and takes a long time to heal. The hip joints must rotate outwards approximately 115 degrees to permit full lotus. Students who cannot achieve this much hip rotation may try to compensate by bending the knee joint sideways, risking injury. Rather than bending the knee, the thighs can be encouraged to rotate outwards (using hand pressure or a strap). 

The yoga guru B. K. S. Iyengar notes that people unused to sitting on the floor will initially feel &quot;excruciating&quot; pain in the knees, but that this subsides with practice, until the pose becomes relaxing, both restful and alert and hence ideal for pranayama.

Twentieth century advocates of some schools of yoga, such as Iyengar, made claims for the effects of yoga on specific organs, without adducing any evidence. 
Iyengar claimed that Padmasana encourages blood circulation in the abdomen and lumbar region, toning the spine and abdominal organs.

== In art and culture ==

===Asian art===
In Buddhism, statues of the founder, Gautama Buddha, sometimes depict him seated in lotus position and enthroned on a lotus flower.
In Hinduism, statues often depict gods, especially Shiva, meditating in Padmasana. In Bali, a Padmasana is also a type of Hindu shrine, named for the posture.
In Jainism, seated Tirthankaras are represented in Lotus posture.

===Western culture===

The scholar of religion Thomas Tweed wrote in 2008 that &quot;the prevailing image of Buddhist practice has been the solitary meditator, eyes half closed, sitting in the lotus position.&quot; Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1964 novel &quot;You Only Live Twice&quot; has the action hero James Bond visiting Japan, where he &quot;assiduously practised sitting in the lotus position.&quot; The critic Lisa M. Dresner notes that Bond is mirroring Fleming&#x27;s own struggles with the pose. The BBC journalist Megan Lane commented in 2003 that since yoga as exercise had become mainstream, lotus position (like tree pose) had been used by advertisers to sell &quot;all manner of goods and services.&quot; She noted that both &quot;healthy living&quot; goods such as vitamins, fitness clubs, water filter and probiotic yogurt, and unrelated items such as cars, airlines, financial services &quot;and even beer&quot; have made use of images of yoga to convey a message of well-being. Poland&#x27;s Obory Dairy gave its advertising agency the goal of creating awareness of their &quot;Jogi&quot; yogurt as exclusive and with a positive image. The agency responded with a photograph of two young women meditating in lotus pose at dawn under the heading &quot;Start your day with Jogi&quot;, the brand name also meaning &quot;yoga&quot; in Polish.

<text>The harlequin duck (Histrionicus histrionicus) is a small sea duck. It takes its name from Harlequin (Italian &quot;Arlecchino, French Arlequin&quot;), a colourfully dressed character in Commedia dell&#x27;arte. The species name comes from the Latin word &quot;histrio&quot;, meaning &quot;actor&quot;. Other names include painted duck, totem pole duck, rock duck, glacier duck, mountain duck, white-eyed diver, squeaker, lords and ladies and blue streak.

==Taxonomy==
In 1747 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the harlequin duck in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Dusky and Spotted Duck&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a preserved specimen that had been brought to London from Newfoundland in eastern Canada. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the harlequin duck with the ducks, geese and swans in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Anas histrionica&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The harlequin duck is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Histrionicus&quot; that was introduced in 1828 by the French naturalist René Lesson. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The name &quot;histrionicus&quot; is from Latin and means &quot;theatrical&quot; or &quot;like a harlequin&quot; (&quot;histrio&quot; means &quot;actor&quot;).

Two prehistoric harlequin ducks have been described from fossils, although both were initially placed in a distinct genus: &quot;Histrionicus shotwelli&quot; is known from Middle to Late Miocene deposits of Oregon, United States and was considered to form a distinct monotypic genus, &quot;Ocyplonessa&quot;. &quot;Histrionicus ceruttii&quot;, which lived in California during the Late Pliocene, was at first taken to be a species of the related genus &quot;Melanitta&quot;.

==Description==

Adult breeding males have a colorful and complex plumage pattern. The head and neck are dark slate blue with a large white crescent marking in front of the eye that extends up to the crest, a small round dot behind the eye, and a larger oval spot down the side of the neck. A black crown stripe runs over the top of the head, with chestnut patches on either side. A black-bordered white collar separates the head from the breast. The body is largely a lighter slate blue with chestnut sides. A black-bordered white bar divides the breast vertically from the sides. The tail is black, long and pointed. The speculum is metallic blue. The inner secondary feathers are white and form white markings over the back when folded. The bill is blue-grey and the eye is reddish. Adult females are less colourful, with brownish-grey plumage with three white patches on the head: a round spot behind the eye, a larger patch from the eye to the bill and a small spot above the eye.

==Distribution and habitat==

Their breeding habitat is cold fast moving streams in north-western and north-eastern North America, Greenland, Iceland and eastern Russia. The nest is usually located in a well-concealed location on the ground near a stream. They are usually found near pounding surf and white water. They are short distance migrants and most winter near rocky shorelines on the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. They are very rare migrants to western Europe.

The eastern North American population is declining and is considered endangered. Possible causes include loss of habitat due to hydroelectric projects and loss of life due to oil spills near coastal areas.

==Behaviour==
These birds feed by swimming under water or diving. They also dabble. They eat molluscs, crustaceans and insects. Harlequins have smooth, densely packed feathers that trap a lot of air within them. This is vital for insulating such small bodies against the chilly waters they ply. It also makes them exceptionally buoyant, making them bounce like corks after dives.

===Breeding===
Harlequin ducks adhere to a monogamous mating system, during their winter mating season will form multi-year pair bonds, though the males rarely participate in paternal care. Young ducks begin courtship in their first winter, females will find success by the second year, yet the males will rarely form a persistent bond before their fourth winter. Harlequin males will have an alternate plumage during this winter mating season.

Both female and male harlequins exercise mate choice preference and pair-bond defense, to demonstrate fidelity to their partner. Either partner is able to divorce the pair-bond to pursue a higher-quality option, however this behavior is uncommon.

<doc id="262696" wikidata="Q741005" url="?curid=262696" title="Tanya Grotter">
<text>Tanya Grotter () is the protagonist of a Russian fantasy novel series by Dmitri Yemets. Tanya (short for Tatiana) Grotter is an orphan with intentional resemblances to J. K. Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter&quot;. Despite its reputation in Russia and the many books it has spawned, the series is not available in English translation, because of the first book having been judged a breach of copyright.

==Content==
The central character and plot elements of the first novel, &quot;Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass&quot;, are a humorous parody of &quot;Harry Potter and the Philosopher&#x27;s Stone&quot;, but are transposed into a Russian setting. Tanya Grotter has an unusual birthmark on her nose, magical powers, an upbringing by &quot;Lopukhoid&quot; (equivalent to Muggle) relatives after her parents were killed by an evil sorceress Chuma-del-Tort (the official translation of Voldemort&#x27;s name in Russian was &#x27;Volan-de-Mort&#x27;), and goes to study at the Tibidokhs (Тибидохс) School for Behaviorally-Challenged Young Witches and Wizards. Tanya&#x27;s foster-family, the Durnevs, live in an urban apartment block, and Tanya is forced to sleep not in a cupboard but in the apartment&#x27;s loggia.

Yemets described the books as &quot;a cultural reply&quot; to the Potter series, and they feature allusion to Russian culture and folklore such as Baba Yaga, rusalki, witches on Bald Mountain and the works of Pushkin (for instance, Tibidox is on the island of Buyan mentioned in Pushkin&#x27;s &quot;The Tale of Tsar Saltan&quot;).

After the first book, the plots diverge from those of the Harry Potter series. For instance, in &quot;Tanya Grotter and the Golden Leech&quot;, Tanya finds herself pitted against &quot;Hurry Pooper&quot; (a thinly disguised Harry Potter) in the World Dragonball Championship. While trying to reach the ball, they crash, creating a new timeline in which Chuma-del-Tort has won, good and evil being reversed, and all the characters are speaking a Russian equivalent of Orwellian Newspeak. To restore normality, Tanya must defeat the Golden Leech.

==Legal history==

While the series is legally published in Russia, it is not available in translation due to a lawsuit on behalf of J. K. Rowling and Time Warner. Having failed to obtain a cease and desist order in Russia, Rowling and Time Warner targeted publication in the Netherlands, where first translations of international editions are commonly published. In 2003, courts there prevented the distribution of a Dutch translation of the first in the series, &quot;Tanya Grotter and the Magical Double Bass&quot;, after Rowling and Time Warner&#x27;s lawyers issued a cease and desist order, arguing that the Grotter books violated copyright law, specifically infringing on Rowling&#x27;s right to control derivative works. Yemets and his Moscow-based publishers, Eksmo, argued unsuccessfully that the book constituted a parody, permitted under copyright.

Later that year, as the Dutch translation &quot;Tanja Grotter en de magische contrabas&quot; was still legal in Belgium, the Flemish publishers Roularta Books decided to print 1,000 copies (and no more) in order to let people decide whether it was plagiarism, hoping that under those circumstances Rowling and her publishers would not sue.

==Subsequent history==
In 2003, after the first five books, the total circulation of Tanya Grotter books reached a million. As of 2006 the figure, including spinoffs, was approaching 3 million. In a 2006 interview, Yemets said that he had moved on to &quot;urban absurd comic genre fantasy&quot; with the Buslaev series, but that there was still reader demand, and sufficient material, for an 11th Tanya book. He described the Tanya Grotter series as a purely Russian phenomenon, dependent on the language and culture, and commented that he would not place much faith in Tanya living a full life if she were brought to the playing field of Europe or America.

In 2006, Yemets&#x27; books featured in the 10 best children&#x27;s books 2006 in a reader&#x27;s poll at the Pushkin Central Children&#x27;s Library, Saint Petersburg. In July 2006, his &quot;Tanya Grotter and the Pearl Ring&quot; was the highest-selling children&#x27;s book in Russia (his &quot;Methodius Buslaev: Vengeance of the Valkyries&quot; was #10, while JK Rowling&#x27;s &quot;Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince&quot; and &quot;Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix&quot; ranked #2 and #6.

<text>Riau (Jawi: ) is a province of Indonesia. It is located on the central eastern coast of the island of Sumatra, and extends from the eastern slopes of the Barisan Mountains to the Malacca Strait, including several large islands situated within the Strait. The province shares land borders with North Sumatra to the northwest, West Sumatra to the west, and Jambi to the south, and a maritime border with the Riau Islands and the country of Malaysia to the east. It is the second-largest province in the island of Sumatra after South Sumatra, and is slightly larger than the nation of Jordan. According to the 2020 census, Riau had a population of 6,394,087 across a land area of 89,935.90 km²; the official estimate of population as of mid-2023 was 6,642,874 (comprising 3,398,387 males, which is 51.19% of the total population and 3,246,487 females, which is 48.81% of the total population). The province comprises ten regencies and two cities, with Pekanbaru serving as the capital and largest city.

Historically, Riau has been a part of various monarchies before the arrival of European colonial powers. Muara Takus, a Buddhist temple complex believed to be a remnant of the Buddhist empire of Srivijaya -12th century, is situated in Kampar Regency in Riau province. Following the spread of Islam in the 14th century, the region was then under control of Malay sultanates of Siak Sri Indrapura, Indragiri, and Johor. The sultanates later became protectorate of the Dutch and were reduced to puppet states of the Dutch East Indies. After the establishment of Indonesia in 1945, Riau belonged to the republic&#x27;s provinces of Sumatra (1945–1948) and Central Sumatra (1948–1957). On 10 August 1957, the province of Riau was inaugurated and it included the Riau Islands until 2004.

Although Riau is predominantly considered the land of Malays, it is a highly diverse province. In addition to Malays constituting one-third of the population, other major ethnic groups include Javanese, Minangkabau, Batak, and Chinese. The local Riau dialect of Malay language is considered as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; in the province, but Indonesian, the standardized form of Malay is used as the official language and also as the second language of many people. Other than that, different languages such as Minangkabau, Hokkien and varieties of Batak languages are also spoken.

Riau is one of the wealthiest provinces in Indonesia and is rich in natural resources, particularly petroleum, natural gas, rubber, palm oil and fibre plantations. Extensive logging and plantation development in has led to a massive decline in forest cover Riau, and associated fires have contributed to haze across the larger region.

== Etymology ==
There are three possible origins of the word &quot;riau&quot; which became the name of this province. First, from the Portuguese word, &quot;&quot; which means river. In 1514, there was a Portuguese military expedition that traced the Siak River, in order to find the location of a kingdom they believed existed in the area, and at the same time to pursue followers of Sultan Mahmud Shah who fled after the fall of the Malacca Sultanate.

The second version claims that &quot;riau&quot; comes from the word &quot;riahi&quot; which means sea water. The word is allegedly derived from the figure of Sinbad al-Bahar in the book of the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

Another version is that &quot;riau&quot; is derived from the Malay word &quot;riuh,&quot; which means &quot;crowded, frenzied working people&quot;. This word is believed used to reflect the nature of the Malay people in present-day Bintan. The name is likely to have become famous since Raja Kecil moved the Malay kingdom center from Johor to Ulu Riau in 1719. This name was used as one of the four main sultanates that formed the kingdoms of Riau, Lingga, Johor and Pahang. However, as the consequences of the Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824 between the Netherlands and United Kingdom, the Johor-Pahang sultanates fell under British influence, while the Riau-Lingga sultanates fell under Dutch influence.

== History ==
===Prehistoric era===
Riau is thought to have been inhabited since between 40,000 and 10,000 BC, with the discovery of tools from the Pleistocene era in the Sengingi River area in Kuantan Singingi Regency in August 2009. Stone tools found include: an axle, a drawstring, and shale and core stone axes. The research team also found some wood fossils estimated to be older than the stone tools. It is suspected the tool users were &quot;Pithecanthropus erectus&quot; (reclassified as &quot;Homo erectus&quot;) similar to those found in Sangiran, Central Java. These tools proved the existence of prehistoric settlement in Riau. Earlier settlement was assumed to be possible in the area since the discovery of the Muara Takus Temple in Kampar in 1860.

=== Early historic era ===
The Malay kingdoms in Riau were at first based on the Buddhist Srivijaya Empire. This is evidenced by the Muara Takus Temple which was thought to be the center of the Srivijaya government in Riau. Its architecturally resembles temples that can be found in India. In addition, French historian George Cœdès also discovered the similarity of the Srivijaya governmental structure and the Malay sultanates of the 15th century. The earliest text that deals with the Malay world is &quot;Sulalatus Salatin&quot; (&quot;Malay Annals)&quot; by Tun Sri Lanang, in 1612. According to the annals, Bukit Seguntang in modern-day Palembang in South Sumatra is where Sang Sapurba came to the world and his descendants would scatter throughout the Malay world. His descendants such as Sang Mutiara would become king in Tanjungpura and Sang Nila Utama would become king in Bintan before finally moving to Singapura. Before the arrival of Islam to the archipelago, many parts of the Riau region were under the Srivijaya Empire between the 7th to the 14th century which was greatly influenced by the Hindu-Buddhist tradition. Islam was introduced to the region when the Maharaja of Srivijaya sent a letter to Caliph Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz of the Umayyad Caliphate in Egypt containing a request to send a messenger to introduce Islamic law to him.

=== Islamic sultanates ===
In the 12th century, the entry of Islam into the archipelago was carried through the Samudera Pasai Sultanate in Aceh which was the first Islamic sultanate in the archipelago. The process of the spread of Islam occurred through trade, marriage and missionary activities of Muslim clerics. These factors led to the spread and growth of Islamic influence throughout the Malay world. The strong acceptance of Islam by Malay people is the aspect of equality, which contrasted the caste system in Hinduism, where lower class caste people were less than members of a higher castes.

The golden age of Islam in the region was when Malacca became an Islamic sultanate. Many elements of Islamic law, including political and administrative sciences were incorporated into Malacca law, especially the &quot;Udang-Undang Melaka&quot; (Law of Melaka). The ruler of Malacca received the title &#x27;Sultan&#x27; and was responsible for Islam in his kingdom. In the 15th century, Islam spread and developed throughout the Melaka region including the entire Malay Peninsula, Riau Islands, Bintan, Lingga, Jambi, Bengkalis, Siak, Rokan, Indragiri, Kampar, and Kuantan. Malacca is considered a catalyst in the expansion of Islam into other areas such as Palembang, Sumatra, Patani in southern Thailand, North Kalimantan, Brunei and Mindanao.

According to the journals of the Portuguese explorer Tomé Pires between 1513 and 1515, Siak controlled an area that lies between &quot;Arcat&quot; and &quot;Indragiri&quot;. It was a port city under a Minangkabau king, but became a Malacca vassal before being conquered by the Portuguese. Since the fall of Malacca to the Dutch East India Company (VOC), the Johor Sultanate claimed Siak as part of its sovereign territory. This continued until the arrival of Sultan Abdul Jalil Rahmat Shah or &quot;Raja Kecil&quot; who later founded the Siak Sultanate. In the &quot;Syair Perang Siak&quot;, it is told that &quot;Raja Kecil&quot; was asked to become the ruler of Siak for the consensus of the people in Bengkalis. This aims to release Siak from the influence of the Johor Sultanate. While according to the &quot;Hikayat Siak&quot;, &quot;Raja Kecil&quot; was also called the true inheritor of the throne of the Sultan of Johor who lost the power struggle. Based on the correspondence of the Sultan Indermasyah with the Dutch Governor-General in Malacca at that time, it was mentioned that Sultan Abdul Jalil was his brother who was sent for business affairs with the VOC. Sultan Abdul Jalil then wrote a letter addressed to the Dutch, calling himself the &quot;Raja Kecil&quot; of Pagaruyung, that he would take revenge for the death of the Sultan of Johor.

In 1718, &quot;Raja Kecil&quot; succeeded in conquering the Johor Sultanate, at the same time crowning himself as the Sultan of Johor with the title &quot;Yang Dipertuan Besar Johor&quot;. But in 1722, a rebellion led by Raja Sulaiman, the son of the former Sultan Abdul Jalil Shah IV, demanded the right to the throne of Johor. With the help of Bugis mercenaries, Raja Sulaiman then succeeded in seizing the throne of Johor, and established himself as the ruler of Johor in Peninsular Malaysia, crowning himself as Sultan Sulaiman Badrul Alam Shah of Johor, while &quot;Raja Kecil&quot; moved to Bintan and in 1723 established a new government center on the bank of the Siak River with the name Siak Sri Inderapura. While the center of the Johor government which had been around the estuary of the Johor River was abandoned. Whereas the claim of &quot;Raja Kecil&quot; as the legitimate heir to the throne of Johor, was recognized by the Orang Laut community. The Orang Laut is a Malay sub-group that resides in the Riau Islands region that stretches from east Sumatra to the South China Sea, and this loyalty continued until the collapse of the Siak Sultanate.

By the late 18th century, the Siak Sultanate had become the dominant power on the eastern coast of Sumatra. In 1780, the Siak Sultanate conquered the Sultanate of Langkat, and made the area its protectorate, alongside the Deli and Serdang Sultanates. Under the ties of a cooperation agreement with the VOC, in 1784 the Siak Sultanate helped the VOC attack and subdue the Selangor Sultanate. Previously they had collaborated to quell the Raja Haji Fisabilillah rebellion on Penyengat Island.

The Siak Sultanate took advantage of the trade supervision through the Straits of Malacca, as well as the ability to control pirates in the region. The progress of Siak&#x27;s economy can be seen from the Dutch records which stated that in 1783 there were around 171 merchant ships making a voyage from Siak to Malacca. Siak is a trading triangle between the Netherlands in Malacca and the United Kingdom on Penang. But on the other hand, the glory of Siak caused jealousy of the descendants of &quot;Yang Dipertuan Muda&quot;, especially after the loss of their power in the Riau Islands. The attitude of dislike and hostility towards the Sultan of Siak was, seen in the Tuhfat al-Nafis, where in the description of the story they describe the Sultan of Siak as &quot;a person who is greedy for the wealth of the world&quot;.

The dominance of the Siak Sultanate towards the eastern coast of Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula was quite significant. They were able to replace the influence of Johor before on the control of the trade route in the Strait of Malacca. In addition, the Siak Sultanate also emerged as a key holder of the Minangkabau highland, through three main rivers, of Siak, Kampar, and Kuantan, which had previously been the key to the glory of Malacca. However, the progress of Siak&#x27;s economy faded caused by the turmoil in the Minangkabau interior known as the Padri War.

=== Colonial rule ===

The expansion of Dutch colonialization into the eastern part of Sumatra caused the influence of the Siak Sultanate to wane, leading to the independence of the Deli Sultanate, the Asahan Sultanate, the Langkat Sultanate, and the Inderagiri Sultanate. Likewise in Johor, where a sultan of the descendants of Tumenggung Johor was crowned, under British protection in Singapore. While the Dutch restored the position of the &quot;Yang Dipertuan Muda&quot; on Penyengat Island, and later established the Riau-Lingga Sultanate on Lingga Island. In addition, the Netherlands also reduced the territory of Siak, by establishing the Residency of Riouw (Dutch: &quot;Residentie Riouw&quot;) which was part of the Dutch East Indies government based in Tanjung Pinang.

British control of the Straits of Malacca, prompted the Sultan of Siak in 1840 to accept the offer of a new treaty to replace the agreement they had made earlier in 1819. This agreement made the Siak Sultanate area smaller and sandwiched it between other small kingdoms which were protected by Britain. Likewise, the Dutch made the sultanate a protectorate of the Dutch East Indies, after forcing the Sultan of Siak to sign an agreement on 1 February 1858. From the agreement, the sultanate lost its sovereignty, then in the appointment of a new sultan, the sultanate must get approval from the Netherlands. Furthermore, under regional supervision, the Dutch established a military post in Bengkalis and banned the Sultan of Siak from making agreements with foreign parties without the approval of the Dutch East Indies government.

Changes in the political map over the control of the Malacca Strait, the internal disputes of Siak and competition with Britain and the Netherlands, weakened the influence of the Siak Sultanate over the territories it had once conquered. A tug of war between the interests of foreign forces caused the signing of the Anglo-Dutch Treaties of 1870–71 between the British and the Dutch, put Siak in a weak bargaining position. Then based on the agreement on 26 July 1873, the Dutch East Indies government forced the Sultan of Siak to hand over the Bengkalis area to the Riouw Residency. But in the midst of this pressure, the Siak Sultanate still remained until Indonesia&#x27;s independence, even though during the Japanese occupation most of the military power of the Siak Sultanate was no longer significant.

At about the same time, the Indragiri Sultanate also began to be influenced by the Dutch, but only came under the control of Batavia in 1938. Dutch control of Siak later became the beginning of the outbreak of the Aceh War.

On the coast, the Dutch moved quickly to abolish the sultanates that did not submit to the government in Batavia. The Dutch appointed a resident in Tanjung Pinang to supervise coastal areas, and the Dutch succeeded in toppling the Sultan of Riau-Lingga, Sultan Abdul Rahman Muazzam Syah in February 1911.

=== Japanese occupation ===
During the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, Riau was one of the primary strategic targets. The Japanese army occupied Rengat on 31 March 1942. All of Riau was quickly occupied by the Japanese. A relic of the Japanese occupation is the 220 km railway line that connects Muaro Sijunjung in West Sumatra and Pekanbaru, also known as the Pekanbaru Death Railway which is now abandoned. Hundreds of thousands of Riau people were forced to work by the Japanese to complete the project. Japan led the construction of the railroad using forced labor and prisoners of war. The construction took 15 months through mountains, swamps and fast-flowing rivers. As many as 6,500 Dutch (mostly Indo-Europeans) and British prisoners of wars and more than 100,000 romusha Indonesians (mostly Javanese) were mobilized by the Japanese military. When the project was completed in August 1945, almost one third of European prisoners of war and more than half of Indonesian workers died. The railroad was intended as a medium for transporting coal and soldiers from Pekanbaru to Muaro Sijunjung on the west of Sumatra. Construction of the railroad was completed on 15 August 1945, before the Japanese surrendered. The railroad was used only once to transport prisoners of war out of the area. The line was then abandoned.

=== Independence and contemporary era ===
At the beginning of Indonesia&#x27;s independence, the former Riau Residency was merged and incorporated into the Sumatra Province based in Bukittinggi. Along with the crackdown on PRRI sympathizers, Sumatra was divided into three provinces, North Sumatra, Central Sumatra, and South Sumatra. Central Sumatra became a stronghold of the PRRI, this caused the central government to breakup Central Sumatra in order to weaken the PRRI movement, in 1957, based on Emergency Law Number 19 of 1957, Central Sumatra was divided into three provinces, Riau, Jambi and West Sumatra. The newly formed Riau province was composed of the former territory of the Siak Sri Sultanate of Inderapura and the Riau Residency as well as the Kampar.

As Riau was one of the areas influenced by the Revolutionary Government of the Republic of Indonesia, the central government conducted Operation Tegas to quell the rebellion, under the leadership of Kaharuddin Nasution, who later became governor of the province, succeeded in quelling the remnants of PRRI sympathizers.

Afterwards, the central government began to consider moving the provincial capital from Tanjung Pinang to Pekanbaru, which is more centrally located. The government established Pekanbaru as the new provincial capital on 20 January 1959 through Kepmendagri No. December 52 / I / 44–25.

After the fall of the Old Order, Riau became one of the pillars of the New Order&#x27;s economic development. In 1944, geologist Richard H. Hopper, Toru Oki and their team discovered the largest oil well in Southeast Asia, in Minas, Siak. This well was originally named Minas No. 1. Minas is famous for its Sumatra Light Crude (SLC) oil which is good quality as it has low sulfur content. In the early 1950s, new oil wells were found in Minas, Duri, Bengkalis, Pantaicermin, and Petapahan. Petroleum extraction in Riau began in the Siak Block in September 1963, with the signing of a work contract with PT California Texas Indonesia (now Chevron Pacific Indonesia). This province contributed 70% of Indonesia&#x27;s oil production in the 1970s.

Riau was also the main destination for the transmigration program launched by the Suharto administration. Many families from Java moved to the newly opened oil palm plantations in Riau, forming a separate community.

In 1999, Saleh Djasit was elected as the second native Riaunese (besides Arifin Achmad) and first elected by the Provincial House of Representatives as governor. His administration saw the separation of the Riau Archipelago to become Riau Islands Province in 2002, leaving Riau with just the mainland territories. In 2003, former Regent of Indragiri Hilir, Rusli Zainal, was elected governor, and was re-elected through direct elections by the people in 2008. Starting on 19 February 2014, Riau Province was officially led by the governor, Annas Maamun, leading for 7 months, Annas Maamun was removed after he was arrested by the Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) in a case of land use change in Kuantan Singingi Regency.

==Geography==
Geographically, Riau is located at position 02 ° 25 &#x27;LU-01 ° 15 ° LS and 100 ° 03&#x27;-104 ° 00&#x27; BT. The area is quite extensive and is located in the central part of Sumatra. Riau is directly adjacent to North Sumatra and the Straits of Malacca in the north, Jambi to the south, West Sumatra to the west and the Riau Islands in the east. The province shares maritime borders with Singapore and Malaysia.

In general, the geography of Riau consists of mountains, lowlands, and islands. The mountain area lies in the western part, namely the Bukit Barisan Mountains, near the border of West Sumatra. The elevation decreases towards the east, making most of the central and eastern part of the province covered with lowlands. Off the eastern coast lies the Strait of Malacca where several island lies.

=== Climate ===
In general, Riau Province has a wet tropical climate that is influenced by two seasons, namely the rainy and dry seasons. The average rainfall received by Riau Province is between 2,000 – 3,000 mm / year with an average annual rainfall of 160 days. The areas that received the most rain were Rokan Hulu Regency and Pekanbaru City. Meanwhile, the area that received the least rainfall was Siak Regency.

The average air temperature of Riau is 25.9 °C with maximum temperatures reaching 34.4 °C and minimum temperatures reach 20.1 °C. The highest temperature occurs in urban areas on the coast. On the contrary, the lowest temperature covers the high mountains and mountains. Air humidity can reach an average of 75%. Slightly different for the island region in the eastern region is also influenced by the characteristics of the sea climate.As in most other province of Indonesia, Riau has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Af&quot;) bordering on a tropical monsoon climate. The climate is very much dictated by the surrounding sea and the prevailing wind system. It has high average temperature and high average rainfall.

=== Ecology ===
Forest cover in Riau has declined from 78% in 1982 to only 33% in 2005. This has been further reduced an average of 160,000 hectares on average per year, leaving 22%, or 2.45 million hectares left as of 2009. Fires associated with deforestation have contributed to serious haze over the province and cities to the East, such as Singapore and Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia

Giam Siak Kecil – Bukit Batu Biosphere Reserve, Indonesia, is a peatland area in Sumatra featuring sustainable timber production and two wildlife reserves, which are home to the Sumatran tiger, Sumatran elephant, Malayan tapir, and Malayan sun bear. Research activities in the biosphere include the monitoring of flagship species and in-depth study on peatland ecology. Initial studies indicate a real potential for sustainable economic development using native flora and fauna for the economic benefit of local inhabitants.

Cagar Biosfer Giam Siak Kecil Bukit Batu (CB-GSK-BB) is one of seven Biosphere Reserves in Indonesia. They are located in two areas of Riau Province, Bengkalis and Siak. CB-GSK-BB is a trial presented by Riau at the 21st Session of the International Coordinating Council of Man and the Biosphere (UNESCO) in Jeju, South Korea, on 26 May 2009. CB-GSK-BB is one of 22 proposed locations in 17 countries accepted as reserves for the year. A Biosphere Reserve is the only internationally recognised concept of environmental conservation and cultivation. Thus the supervision and development of CB-GSK-BB is a worldwide concern at a regional level.

CB-GSK-BB is a unique type of Peat Swamp Forest in the Kampar Peninsula Peat Forest (with a small area of swamp). Another peculiarity is that the CB-GSK-BB was initiated by private parties in co-operation with the government through BBKSDA (The Center for the Conservation of Natural Resources), including the notorious conglomerate involved in forest destruction, Sinar Mas Group, owning the largest paper and pulp company in Indonesia.

==Government==
The Province of Riau is led by a governor who is elected directly with his representative for a 5-year term. In addition to being a regional government, the Governor also acts as a representative or extension of the central government in the province, whose authority is regulated in Law No. 32 of 2004 and Government Regulation number 19 of 2010.

While the relationship between the provincial government and the regency and city governments is not a sub-ordinate, each of these regional governments governs and manages government affairs according to the principle of autonomy and co-administration.

=== Administrative divisions ===
When the province of Riau was created on 10 August 1957 from the splitting of the former province of Central Sumatra, it consisted of four regencies - Bengkalis, Bintan (covering the offshore archipelagoes now comprising the Riau Islands Province), Indragiri and Kampar - together with the independent city of Pekanbaru. On 14 June 1965 the Indragiri Regency was divided into an Indragiri Hilir Regency and an Indragiri Hulu Regency. On 4 October 1999 four of these regencies were divided up in a wholesale reorganisation: Bengkalis Regency was split up into Rokan Hilir Regency, Siak Regency and a new city of Dumai, as well as a smaller Bengkalis Regency; a new Kuantan Singingi Regency was cut out of the Indragiri Hulu Regency, while Rokan Hulu Regency and Pelalawan Regency were cut out of Kampar Regency. Finally, on the same date, the Bintan Regency was split, with a new city of Batam and new regencies of Karimun and Natuna being split off; a further city of Tanjung Pinang was cut out of the residual part of Bintan Regency on 21 June 2001; however on 24 September 2002 the five Riau Islands administrations were split off from Riau Province to form a separate Riau Islands Province. Subsequently on 19 December 2008 a new Meranti Islands Regency was cut off the remaining Bengkalis Regency.

Riau Province is thus subdivided into ten regencies (&quot;kabupaten&quot;) and two autonomous cities (&quot;kota&quot;), listed below with their areas and their populations at the 2010 and 2020 Censuses, and according to the official estimates as at mid 2023.

The province comprises two of Indonesia&#x27;s 84 national electoral districts to elect members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Riau I Electoral District consists of 5 of the regencies in the province (Siak, Bengkalis, Meranti Islands, Rokan Hilir and Rokan Hulu), together with the cities of Pekanbaru and Dumai, and elects 7 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council. The Riau II Electoral District consists of the remaining 5 regencies (Kuantan Singingi, Indragiri Hulu, Indragiri Hilir, Pelalawan and Kampar), and elects 6 members to the People&#x27;s Representative Council.

==Demographics==
The total population of Riau spread over ten regencies and two cities as at mid 2023 reached 6,642,874 people consisting of 3,396,387 males and 3,246,487 females. Based on the population per regency/city in 2022, the largest population was in Pekanbaru City with 506,231 male population and 501,309 female, while the smallest population was in the Kepulauan Meranti Regency where about 110,100 people were male and 103,400 were female. Overall males constituted 51.13% of the population and females 48.87% in 2023.
=== Ethnic groups ===

Riau is considered a very ethnically diverse province. As of 2010, the ethnic groups in Riau consist of Malays (43%), Javanese (25%), Minangkabau (8%), Batak (12%), Banjar (4%), Chinese (2%), and Bugis (2%). The Malays are the largest ethnic group with a composition of 45% of the entire population of the province. They generally come from coastal areas in Rokan Hilir, Dumai, Bengkalis, Pulau Meranti, up to Pelalawan, Siak, Inderagiri Hulu and Inderagiri Hilir. Riau was once the seat of great Malay sultanates, such as the Sultanate of Siak Sri Indrapura, the Pelalawan Sultanate and the Indragiri Sultanate.

There is also a sizable population of Minangkabau people living in Riau Province, mostly in the areas bordering West Sumatra, such as Rokan Hulu, Kampar, Kuantan Singingi, and part of Inderagiri Hulu. Pekanbaru, the capital of Riau Province, has a Minangkabau majority, since it was once one of the Minangkabau &quot;rantau&quot; (migration) area. Many Minangkabau in Pekanbaru have lived there for generations and has since assimilated into the Malay community. Most Minangkabau in Riau generally work as merchants and live in urban areas such as Pekanbaru, Bangkinang, Duri, and Dumai.

There are many other ethnic groups migrating from other provinces of Indonesia, such as the Batak Mandailing people who mostly lives in areas bordering North Sumatra such as Rokan Hulu. Most of the Mandailing people now identify themselves as Malay rather than as Minangkabau or Batak. In the 19th century, the Banjarese of South Kalimantan and the Bugis of South Sulawesi also began arriving in Riau to seek better lives. Most of them settled in the Indragiri Hilir areas, especially around Tembilahan. The opening of Caltex oil mining company in the 1940s in Rumbai, encouraged people from throughout the country to migrate to Riau.

There are sizeable Javanese and Sundanese population in Riau Province. Javanese forms the second-largest ethnic group in the province, forming 25.05% of the total population. Most of them migrated to Riau due to the transmigration program dating from the Dutch East Indies and continued during the Soeharto administration. The majority of them lives in transmigration communities spread throughout the region.

Likewise, the Chinese people are generally similar to the Minangkabau as many of them also work as merchants. Many Riau Chinese lives in the capital Pekanbaru, and many can also found in coastal areas in the east such as Bagansiapiapi, Selatpanjang, Rupat and Bengkalis. Most of the Chinese people in Riau are Hoklo people, whose ancestors migrated from Quanzhou in modern-day Fujian from the early 19th-century to the mid 20th-century. Some of the Riau Chinese has migrated to other parts of Indonesia, such as Medan and Jakarta, to seek better life opportunities, while some have also migrated to other countries such as Singapore and Taiwan.

There are also some groups of indigenous people who live in rural areas and riverbanks, such as the Orang Sakai, Akit, Talang Mamak, and Orang Laut. Some of them still leading the nomadic and Hunter-gatherer lifestyle in the remote interior of Riau, while most settled into major cities and towns in with the rise of industrialisation.

=== Language ===

The people of Riau generally uses the local dialect of Malay and Indonesian, the official language of Indonesia. Malay is commonly used in coastal areas such as Rokan Hilir, Bengkalis, Dumai, Pelalawan, Siak, Indragiri Hulu, Indragiri Hilir and around the islands off the coast of Riau.
The dialect of Malay spoken in Riau is considered by linguists to have one of the least complex grammars among the languages of the world, apart from creoles, possessing neither noun declensions, temporal distinctions, subject/object distinctions, nor singular/plural distinction. For example, the phrase &quot;Ayam makan&quot; (lit. &#x27;chicken eat&#x27;) can mean, in context, anything from &#x27;the chicken is eating&#x27;, to &#x27;I ate some chicken&#x27;, &#x27;the chicken that is eating&#x27; and &#x27;when we were eating chicken&#x27;. A possible reason for this is that Riau Malay has been used as a &quot;lingua franca&quot; for communication between different people in this area during its history, and extensive foreign-language speaker use of this kind tends to simplify the grammar of a language used. The traditional script in Riau is Jawi (locally known in Indonesia as &quot;Arab-Melayu&quot;), an Arabic-based writing in the Malay language. It is sometimes supposed that Riau Malay is the basis for the modern national language, Indonesian. However, it is instead based on Classical Malay, the court language of Johor-Riau Sultanate, based primarily from the one used in the Riau Archipelago and the state of Johor, Malaysia, which is distinct from the local mainland Riau dialect. Non-mainstream varieties in Riau include Orang Sakai, Orang Asli, Orang Akit, and Orang Laut.

Riau Malay can be divided into two sub-dialects, namely the inland dialect and the coastal dialect. The inland dialect has phonological features that are similar to Minangkabau, while coastal dialect has phonological features that are close to Malay in the regions of Selangor, Johor and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia (because other Malaysian regions have very different dialects). In addition to various other characteristics, the two subdialects are marked with words which in Indonesian are words that end with vowels /a/; the inland dialect is pronounced with vowel /o/, while in coastal dialect is pronounced with the weak vowel /e/ . Some examples include: /bila/, /tiga/ and /kata/ in Indonesian (if, three and word in English respectively) will be pronounced in inland dialect as /bilo/, /tigo/ and /kato/ respectively. While in the coastal dialect it will be pronounced as /bile/, /tige/ and /kate/ respectively.

The Minangkabau language is widely used by the Minangkabau people in Riau, especially in the areas bordering West Sumatra such as Kampar, Kuantan Singingi and Rokan Hulu, which are culturally allied to Minang as well as migrants from West Sumatra. It is also currently being the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Pekanbaru, the capital city in addition to Indonesian. The pronunciation of Riau Minangkabau is similar to the Payakumbuh-Batusangkar dialect, even differs from that of other dialects varieties of West Sumatra. Historically, Minangkabau language used in the Pagaruyung highlands is now spoken in the lower Siak River basin following the waves of migration from West Sumatra.

In addition, Hokkien is also still widely used among the Chinese community, especially those living in Pekanbaru, Selatpanjang, Bengkalis, and Bagansiapiapi. The Hokkien spoken in Riau is known as Riau Hokkien, which is mutually intelligible to the Hokkien spoken by the Malaysian Chinese in Johor, southern Malaysia and Singapore. They are both derived from the Quanzhou dialect of Hokkien that originated from the city of Quanzhou in Fujian. Riau Hokkien is slightly mutually unintelligible with Medan Hokkien spoken in Medan since the latter is derived from the Zhangzhou dialect of Hokkien that originated from Zhangzhou, also in Fujian. Presently, Riau Hokkien has incorporated many words from the local language such as Malay and Indonesian.

Javanese is spoken by the Javanese people who migrated to the province. While several varieties of Batak is spoken by Batak immigrants from North Sumatra.

===Religion===
Based on the composition of the population of Riau which is full of diversity with different socio-cultural, linguistic and religious backgrounds, it is basically an asset for the Riau region itself. The religions embraced by the inhabitants of this province are very diverse, including Islam, Protestantism, Catholicism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism.

As of 2015, Islam is the dominant religion in the province, forming 86.87% of the total population.

Then there is Buddhism which forms around 2.28% of the total population and Confucianism which forms around 0.07% of the total population. Most of the Buddhist and Confucianism are of ethnic Chinese origin. Lastly, about 0.01% of the total population embrace Hinduism, mostly are Balinese and Indonesians of Indian descent.

== Culture ==
As Riau is the homeland of the Malays, the customs and cultures of Riau is mostly based on Malay customs and cultures.

Every Malay family lives in their own house, except for new couples who usually prefer to stay at the wife&#x27;s house until they have their first child. Therefore, their sedentary patterns can be said to be neat. The nuclear family they called genitals generally built a house in the neighborhood where the wife lived. The principle of lineage or kinship is more likely to be parental or bilateral.

Kinship is done with a typical local nicknames. The first child is called &quot;long&quot; or &quot;sulung&quot;, the second child is &quot;ngah&quot;/&quot;ongah,&quot; below him is called &quot;cik&quot;, the youngest is called &quot;cu&quot;/&quot;ucu&quot;. Usually the nickname is added by mentioning the physical characteristics of the person, for example, if the person is dark-skinned and is a &quot;cik&quot; or a third child, he will be called &quot;cik itam&quot;. Another example is when the particular person is a first-born and has a short characteristic. he/she will be called &quot;ngah undah&quot;. But sometimes when greeting people who are unknown or new to them, they can simply greet them with &quot;abang&quot;, &quot;akak&quot;, &quot;dek&quot;, or &quot;nak&quot;.

In the past, Malays also lived in groups according to their ancestral origin, which they called tribes. This group of descendants uses a patrilineal kinship line. But the Riau Malays who lived on the mainland Sumatra partially embraced matrilineal tribalism. There are also those who referthe tribe as a &quot;hinduk&quot; or a &quot;cikal bakal&quot;. Each tribe is led by a leader. If the tribe lives in a village, then the head will be referred to as &quot;Datuk Penghulu Kampung&quot; or &quot;Kepala Kampung&quot;. Each leader is also assisted by several figures such as &quot;batin&quot;, &quot;jenang&quot;, &quot;tua-tua&quot; dan &quot;monti&quot;. Religious field leaders in the village are known as .

=== Traditional dress ===

In Malay culture, clothes and textiles are very important and it signify beauty and power. The &quot;Hikayat-Hikayat Melayu&quot; mentioned the importance of textile in Malay culture. The history of the Malay woven industry can be traced back to the 13th century when trade routes in the East are rapidly expanding under the role of the Song dynasty. The description of locally-made textiles and the development of the embroidery industry in the Malay Peninsula is expressed in several Chinese and Indian records. Among the famous Malay textiles that still exist today are &quot;Songket&quot; and &quot;Batik&quot;.

The earliest Malay traditional dress was concise, the woman wearing a &quot;sarong&quot; that covered the lower body to the chest while the man dressed in short, sleeveless or shorts, with shorts down to the knee level. However, when trade with the outside world flourishes, the way in which the Malay dress begins to gain external influence and becomes more sophisticated. The 15th-century is the peak of the power of the Malacca Sultanate. As told in the Malay Annals, this is where traditional &quot;Baju Melayu&quot; clothing is created. The strong Islamic influence has transformed the way of dressing the Malays later on features that are matching with Islamic laws. The classic Malay general attire for men consists of shirts, small sacks, &quot;sarongs&quot; worn at the waist, and a &quot;tanjak&quot; or &quot;tengkolok&quot; worn on the head. It is common for a Malay warrior to have a &quot;keris&quot; tucked into the front fold of sarong. The Malay version of the early women&#x27;s clothing is also more loose and long. However, it was subsequently renewed and popularized by Sultan Abu Bakar of Johor in the late 19th century, into the form of &quot;Baju Kurung&quot; used today.

However, Riau also has some traditional dress that cannot be found in other parts of the Malay world. The Riau traditional dress is not only used for certain occasions. But some of these traditional clothes are functioned as everyday clothes, one of which is daily clothing for children. The children&#x27;s daily wear used is divided into two types, namely clothes for boys and clothes for girls. For boys&#x27; clothes in the customs of the Riau people, they are called &quot;baju monyet&quot; (Monkey clothes). This outfit is combined with the type of trousers that are responsible, and complete with a &quot;kopiah&quot; or rectangular shaped cloth as a head covering. While for everyday clothes for girls is &quot;Baju Kurung&quot; with floral motifs. This outfit is combined with a wide skirt with a &quot;hijab&quot; or &quot;tudong&quot;. The daily clothes of Riau people are commonly used for reciting or for studying.

For the people of Riau who are adults, they wear distinctive clothing and are also very close to religious and cultural values. For males, they use clothing called &quot;Baju Kurung Cekak Musang&quot;. Namely, clothes like Muslim clothing are combined with loose trousers. This shirt is used together with &quot;sarong&quot; and &quot;kopiah&quot;.

For Malay women, they can wear 3 different types of clothing, namely the &quot;Baju Kebaya Pendek&quot;, &quot;Baju Kurung Laboh&quot;, and &quot;Baju Kurung Tulang Belut&quot;. The different clothes are used in conjunction with a shawl cloth that is used as a head covering. In addition, women&#x27;s clothing can also be combined with a &quot;hijab&quot; or &quot;tudong&quot;.

=== Traditional house ===

In traditional Malay societies, the house is an intimate building that can be used as a family dwelling, a place of worship, a heritage site, and a shelter for anyone in need. Therefore, traditional Malay houses are generally large. In addition to the large size, the Malay house is also always in the form of a &quot;rumah panggung&quot; or stage house, facing the sunrise. The types of Malay houses include residential houses, offices, place of worship and warehouses. The naming of the houses is tailored to the function of each building. In general, there are five types of Riau Malay traditional houses, namely the and .

The &quot;Balai Salaso Jatuh is&quot; usually used for consensus decision-making and other activities. It is rarely used for private homes. In accordance with the functions of the &quot;Balai Salaso Jatuh&quot;, this building has other local names such as &quot;balai panobatan&quot;, &quot;balirung sari&quot;, &quot;balai karapatan&quot;, etc. Presently, the function of this building has been replaced by a house or a mosque. The building has an alignment, and has a lower floor than the middle room. In addition, &quot;Balai Salaso Jatuh&quot; is also decorated with various carvings in the form of plants or animals. Each carving in this building has its own designation.

&quot;Rumah Melayu Atap Lontik&quot; or &quot;Lontiok House&quot; can usually be found in Kampar Regency&quot;.&quot; It is called so because this house has a decoration on the front wall of the house in the form of a boat. When viewed from a distance, this house will look like boat houses that are usually made by the local residents. Besides being referred to as &quot;lancing&quot; and &quot;pancalang&quot;, this traditional house is also called &quot;lontik&quot;, since this house has a roof paring that is soaring upwards. This house is heavily influenced on the architecture of the Minangkabau &quot;Rumah Gadang,&quot; since Kampar Regency is directly adjacent to the province of West Sumatra. A unique feature of this traditional house is that it has five stairsteps. The reason they chose the number five was because this is based on the Five Pillars of Islam. The shape of the pillars in this house also varies, there are rectangles, hexagons, heptagon, octagon and triangles. Each type of pole contained in this traditional house has meaning believed by the people of Riau. A rectangular pole can be interpreted as four corners of the wind, just like an octagon, and the hexagon symbolizes the number of pillars of Islam.

&quot;Rumah Salaso Jatuh Kembar&quot; was declared an icon and symbol of the province of Riau. The architecture of this house is similar to the &quot;Balai Salaso Jatuh&quot;, but this house tends to be used for private homes. 

&quot;Rumah Melayu Lipat Kajang&quot; can usually found in the Riau Islands and the coastal part of Riau. It is called &quot;Lipat Kajang&quot;because the roof of this house has a shape resembling the shape of a boat. The top of this building is curved upwards and is often referred to &quot;lipat kejang&quot; or &quot;pohon jeramban&quot; by the locals. This traditional house is rarely or even no longer used by Riau residents. One reason for the loss of this culture is because of the increasing influence of western architecture, and people consider their building forms to be simpler and easier to build.

&quot;Rumah Melayu Atap Limas Potong&quot; is a Malay traditional house that can usually be found in mainland Riau, but rarely in the Riau Islands. This house has a roof that is shaped like a cut pyramid. Like other Riau traditional houses, this house is also included in the &quot;rumah panggung&quot; group. The stage of this house has a height of about 1.5 meters above the ground. The size of the house depends on the ability and desires of the owner.

=== Traditional dance ===
Most of Riau traditional dances are influenced by Malay cultures, but there are also some dances that are only unique to Riau.

&quot;Mak Yong&quot; is a traditional theater art of Malay society that is often performed as a drama in an international forum. In the past, &quot;mak yong&quot; was held by villagers in the rice fields which had finished harvesting rice. The &quot;mak yong&quot; is performed by a group of professional dancers and musicians who combine

various elements of religious ceremonies, plays, dance, music with vocal or instrumental, and simple texts. The male and female main characters were both performed by female dancers. Other figures that appear in the story are comedians, gods, jinn, courtiers, and animals. &quot;mak yong&quot; performance is accompanied by musical instruments such as rebab, gendang, and tetawak In Indonesia, the &quot;mak yong&quot; was developed in Lingga, which was once the center of the Johor-Riau Sultanate. The difference with the &quot;mak yong&quot; performed in the Kelantan-Pattani region is that they usually does not use masks, as &quot;mak yong&quot; in Riau uses masks for some of the King&#x27;s female characters, princesses, criminals, demons, and spirits. At the end of the last century, &quot;mak yong&quot; not only became a daily show, but also as performance for the sultan.

The &quot;tari zapin&quot; is a Malay traditional dance originated from the Siak Regency that is entertaining and are full of religious and educational messages. This &quot;tari zapin&quot; has rules and regulations that cannot be changed. &quot;Tari zapin&quot; is usually accompanied by traditional Riau musical instruments namely &quot;marwas&quot; and &quot;gambus&quot;. This &quot;tari zapin&quot; shows footwork quickly following the pounding of punches on a small drum called &quot;marwas&quot; . The rhythmic harmony of the instrument is increasingly melodious with stringed instruments. Because of the influence of the Arabs, this dance does indeed feel educative without losing the entertainment side. There is an insert of a religious message in the song lyrics. Usually the dance is told about the daily lives of Malay people. Initially, &quot;tari zapin&quot; was only danced by male dancers but along with developments, female dancers were also shown. Sometimes, there are both male and female dancers performing. There is a form of &quot;tari zapin&quot; performed in Pulau Rupat Utara in Bengkalis called &quot;tari&quot; &quot;zapin api&quot;. The identifying characteristic of &quot;tari&quot; &quot;zapin api&quot; is the incorporation of fire and strong focus on the mystical elements. The dance form was historically dormant and extinct for nearly 40 years before its revival in 2013.

&quot;Tarian makan sirih&quot; is accompanied by distinctive Malay music accompanied by a song titled &quot;Makan Sirih&quot;. As for the costumes performed by dancers, they usually wore traditional Malay attire, such as pants, clothes, and &quot;kopiah&quot; for men. Whereas the female dancers wear the clothes that are usually worn by the bride, namely traditional clothes called the &quot;Baju Kurung teluk belanga&quot;. At the head, there is a crown equipped with flower-shaped decorations. Meanwhile, the lower part of the dancers&#x27; bodies was wrapped in brightly coloured &quot;songket&quot; cloth. &quot;Tarian makan sirih&quot; is performed by both men and women. The dancers are obliged to understand special terms in Malay dance, such as &quot;igal&quot; (emphasizing hand and body movements), &quot;liuk&quot; (movement of bowing or swinging body), &quot;lenggang&quot; (walking while moving hands), &quot;titi batang&quot; (walking in a line as if climbing the stem), &quot;gentam&quot; (dancing while stomping on the feet), &quot;cicing&quot; (dancing while jogging), &quot;legar&quot; (dancing while walking around 180 degrees), and so on. During the performance, one of the dancers in the offering dance will bring a box containing betels. The box would then be opened and the guests who are considered the greatest are given the first opportunity to take it as a form of respect, then followed by other guests. Therefore, many people call this dance as t&quot;arian makan sirih.&quot;

=== Traditional music ===
There are several musical instruments in Riau that is used for ceremonial events. 

The traditional Malay accordion is almost the same as the accordion founded by Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann from (Germany). accordion includes a musical instrument that is quite difficult to play even though it looks easy. accordion produces diatonic scales that are very in accordance with the song lyrics in the form of rhymes. The accordion player holds the instrument with both hands, then plays the chord buttons with the fingers of the left hand, while the fingers of the right hand play the melody of the song that is being performed. Usually players who have been trained are very easy to change hands. When played, the accordion is pulled and pushed to adjust the air movement inside the instrument, the movement of the air coming out (to the tongue of the accordion) will produce sound. The sound can be adjusted using the player&#x27;s fingers.

&quot;Gambus&quot; is a type of traditional Riau musical instrument that is played by picking. Formerly, &quot;Gambus&quot; was used for events related to spiritual matters. At this time &quot;Gambus&quot; switched functions to be an accompaniment for the &quot;tari zapin.&quot; &quot;Gambus Riau&quot; is played by individuals as entertainment for fishermen on boats who are looking for fish.

&quot;Kompang&quot; is a type of traditional Riau musical instrument that is quite well known among Malays, &quot;Kompang&quot; is included in the group of traditional musical instruments which are played by being beaten. In general, &quot;kompang&quot; uses materials derived from the skin of livestock. Making &quot;kompang&quot; is more similar to making &quot;dhol&quot; or other musical instrument or other leather drum that uses animal skin such as buffalo, cattle, and others. &quot;Kompang&quot; a uses female goat ski on the part that is hit, but now uses a cow which is believed to be more elastic. To produce a loud sound, there is a technique to make the paired skin become very tight and not easily separated from the nail (which can be dangerous when played).

&quot;Rebana ubi&quot; is a type of Tambourine that is played by being hit by hand. &quot;Rebana ubi&quot; is included in the drum group as well as percussion instruments. &quot;Rebana ubi&quot; has a larger size than ordinary tambourines because &quot;Rebana ubi&quot; has the smallest diameter of 70 cm and a height of 1 meter. &quot;Rebana ubi&quot; can be hung horizontally or left on the floor to be played. In ancient times, &quot;Rebana ubi&quot;was believed to be a tool to spread the news such as the wedding ceremony of local residents or the danger that came (such as strong winds). &quot;Rebana ubi&quot; is placed in the highlands and beaten with a certain rhythm depending on the information the player wants to convey.

=== Traditional weapons ===
&quot;Klewang&quot; is a traditional weapon from Riau. &quot;klewang&quot; is a kind of machete with the tip of an enlarged blade. In the past, &quot;klewang&quot; was used by royal soldiers when in war. However, in the present, it is more widely used by farmers in their activities in rice fields or as agricultural tools. Because of this function, &quot;klewang&quot; has remained sustainable compared to other types of traditional Riau weapons.

&quot;Beladau&quot; is a skewer type weapon found in the culture of Riau society. This weapon is a sharp dagger on one side. what makes this &quot;beladau&quot; different from the dagger in general is that &quot;beladau&quot; tends to have curvature at the base of the handle, so the handle is easier to hold and push when used. In accordance with its length of only 24 cm, this traditional Riau weapon is often used as a means of self-protection from melee attacks.

&quot;Pedang jenawi&quot; is a weapon that was often used by Malay royal warlords when facing their enemies. Its size is quite long, which is about 1 meter making it used in close-range warfare. At a glance, &quot;pedang jenawi&quot; looks like a typical Japanese katana. Therefore, many historians and cultural experts argue that this weapon originated from ancient Japanese culture which experienced acculturation with Malay culture. Apart from these opinions, what is clear at this time is that &quot;pedang jenawi&quot; has been regarded as the identity of the Riau Malay community.

&quot;Kris&quot; is a heritage weapon that has been used for centuries. Not only in Riau, keris is generally used by nobles in Southeast Asia. &quot;Kris&quot; is a symbol of honor and self-defense. This weapon is used to stab at close range. The position of the &quot;kris&quot; in history as a symbol of honor is undeniable, that in the kingdom it was clearly seen as a form of self-protection, as well as pride. Even in modern history, the function continues to develop as an object of history, and can also be a determinant of history based on the period of manufacture and the type of material used. Up to now in Riau Malay customs and culture, always cooperating with kris in every dress as a complementary weapon from generation to generation. However, what is different in the form of &quot;kris&quot; from adat in Java is, if the use of &quot;kris&quot; in Java is tucked in the back of the waist, in Riau and the Malay people, in general, the use of &quot;kris&quot; is in front.

== Economics ==
The economy of Riau expands faster (8.66% in 2006) than the Indonesian average (6.04% in 2006), and is largely a resource-based economy, including crude oil (600,000 bpd), palm oil, rubber trees and other forest products. Local government income benefits from a greater share of tax revenue (mainly from crude oil) due to the decentralisation law of 2004. The province has natural resources, both riches contained in the bowels of the earth, in the form of oil and gas, as well as gold, as well as forest products and plantations. Along with the implementation of regional autonomy, gradually began to apply the system for results or financial balance between central and local. The new rules provide expressly limits the obligations of investors, resource utilization, and revenue-sharing with the surrounding environment.

Riau&#x27;s economy in the first quarter of 2017 grew by 2.82 per cent, improving compared to the same period in the previous year which grew 2.74 per cent (year-over-year). This growth was supported by growth in almost all businesses, except mining and excavation which contracted 6.72 per cent. The highest growth occurred in the Corporate Services Business Field at 9.56 per cent, followed by the processing Industry of 7.30 per cent, and government administration, defense and obligatory social security of 6.97 per cent. Riau&#x27;s economy in the first quarter of 2017 contracted by 4.88 per cent compared to the fourth quarter of 2016. This contraction was influenced by seasonal factors in the Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries Business Field (−5.04 per cent). In addition, contractions occur due to a decrease in several business fields, including: Mining and Excavation (−3.50 per cent); Processing Industry (−5.41 per cent); Large Trade and Retail, Car and Motorcycle Repair (−2.46 per cent); and Construction (−8.94 per cent).

=== Energy and natural resources ===

The energy and mineral resources sector is one sector that plays a major role in the development of the province. The leading commodities in the energy and mineral resources sector in Riau include electricity and mining.

Electricity is an important commodity for human life at this time. Without electricity, almost certainly many construction sectors will be paralyzed. Most of the electricity in Riau Province is still supplied by the Perusahaan Listrik Negara (PLN).

From 2013 to 2015, the electricity capacity produced was 114 Kva/Kwh in hydropower, 94.6 Kva/Kwh in diesel power and 131.2 Kva/Kwh in the gas power. The amount of this electricity capacity does not increase or shrink as well as the number of power generating units. Throughout Riau Province there are 1 unit of hydroelectric power plants, 65 units of diesel power plants and 6 units of gas power plants.

=== Farming ===
The agricultural sector is also one of the factors that play a role in the economic development of Riau. The main commodities of agriculture are rice, corn and soybeans. In addition, other agricultural products which are commodities of Riau Province are peanuts, green beans, cassava and sweet potatoes. In 2015, rice production in Riau reached 393,917 tons of milled dry grain. The production was calculated to increase by 2.2 per cent compared to production in 2014. The increase in production was influenced by the increase in the harvested area of 107,546 hectares which increased by around 1,509 hectares (1.42%) compared to the previous year. In addition, rice productivity also increased by around 0.26 quintal / hectare or around 0.71%.

While the increase occurred in corn production, which amounted to 30,870 tons of dry shelled rice, this production increased by around 7.75 per cent or 2,219 tons of dry shelled rice. This increase can be affected because of an increase in the area of maize production by 368 hectares (3.1%) compared to the production area in 2014 of 12,057 hectares. The increase also occurred in corn productivity in 2015 amounting to 1.09 quintal / hectare from 2014 or around 4.59%.

Soybean production also decreased in 2015 by 187 tons of dry beans (8.02%) from soybean production in 2014. The decrease in production was influenced by the harvested area of 1,516 hectares which decreased by around 514 hectares (25.32%). However, soybean productivity increased by 2.66 quintal / hectare or 23.15% compared to the previous year.

In 2015, peanut production was lower than in previous years. This production fell by 8.39 per cent compared to 2014 and 16.65 per cent compared to 2013. The decline in production was influenced by the declining area of peanut farming compared to 2013 and 2014, each of 18.41 per cent and 9.23 per cent .

In 2015, green beans production was lower than in previous years. This production fell by 7.28 per cent compared to 2014 and 3.39 per cent compared to 2013. The decline in production was influenced by the decline in the area of green beans compared to 2013 and 2014, respectively 1.53 per cent and 3.67 per cent.

In addition, cassava production also experienced a decline in 2015 of 11.89 per cent compared to 2014. Actually, cassava production had increased in 2014 by 14.08 per cent. This decrease in production was also influenced by the decline in cassava farming area by 11.61 compared to 2014.

In the last three years, sweet potato production in 2015 was the lowest. This yield fell by 5.36 per cent in 2014 and again fell by 18.05 per cent. As before, the decline in production was also influenced by the declining area of sweet potato farming by 4.96 per cent in 2014 and 18.83 per cent in 2015.

=== Fishing ===

One of Riau&#x27;s leading commodities is the fisheries sector. The geographical condition of Riau where 17.40% of the total area is an oceanic area and there are 15 rivers making the fisheries sector well developed. In addition, the vast extent of untapped land is a great potential for inland aquaculture to develop. In addition, the market demand for fishery products has increasingly made the catchment sector not enough so that fish farming activities such as cages, ponds, public fisheries and ponds are well developed.

Riau fisheries production mostly comes from marine fisheries. In 2015, the data showed that marine fisheries were 106,233.1 tons or decreased 1 per cent from the previous year. In addition, the number of fishery households decreased to 14,610 households, an increase of 0.98 per cent. In addition, there was also a decline in the number of fishing vessels as many as 123 units.

The land fishery product processing industry can be divided into four types, namely floating nets, ponds, public fisheries and ponds. In 2015, fish production from floating nets was 5,378.56 tons or decreased by 82.52 per cent. This decrease was caused by a decrease in the number of floating nets as many as 157,638 units. Fish production in public fisheries also decreased by 3.9 per cent due to a decrease in the number of households. Fish pond production increased by 5,425.2 tons or 10.8 per cent. Temporary data on fish pond production showed a drastic decrease of 82.23 per cent even though the number of fish ponds increased by 89.15 hectares compared to 2014.

=== Stockbreeding ===
Along with increasing public consumption needs for livestock products, both in terms of consumption of livestock meat and other livestock products, such as milk and eggs, the Riau provincial government through the Agriculture and Livestock Service Office continues to try to meet these needs. In addition to the commitment of Riau province to increase food self-sufficiency in 2020, the number of animal populations continues to be increased to meet consumption needs. This is reflected in the increase in some aspects of livestock in Riau in the last 3 years.

=== Agriculture and plantation ===

Plantation industry mainly centre around oil palm and rubber tree cultivation. They are either run by the state, big corporations or by small holders. There are also citrus and coconut plantations to be found. For oil palm plantations, land areas currently being cultivated in Riau province are around 1:34 million hectares. In addition there have been about 116 palm oil mills (PKS) which operate and produce a total of 3.38 millions tons of crude palm oil (CPO) per year.

=== Industry ===
In this province there are several international companies engaged in the oil and gas as well as the processing of forest products and oil. In addition there is also a copra and rubber processing industry. Several major companies including Chevron Pacific Indonesia a subsidiary of Chevron Corporation, PT. Indah Kiat Pulp &amp; Paper Tbk in Perawang, and PT. Riau Andalan Pulp &amp; Paper in Pangkalan Kerinci Riau provincial mining. Minerals are petroleum, gas, and coal.

=== Finance and banking ===
In the field of banking in the province is growing rapidly, this marked the number of private banks and rural banks, in addition to local government-owned banks such as Bank of Riau Kepri.

== Transportation ==
Sultan Syarif Kasim II International Airport in Pekanbaru is the largest airport in the province. It serves as the gateway to Pekanbaru and Riau in a whole. The airport serves flights to other major cities in Indonesia such as Jakarta, Surabaya, Bandung and Medan. Moreover, the airport also serves international flights to cities neighbouring countries such as Singapore, Malacca and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia. Furthermore, the airport also was used for hajj embarkation to Jeddah and Medina in Saudi Arabia. On 16 July 2012, a Rp 2 trillion ($212 million) new terminal has been opened to accommodate 1.5 million passengers a year. The new terminal spanning 17,000 square meters and a more spacious aircraft apron which can accommodate 10 wide-body aircraft, twice the capacity of the old apron. The new terminal is designed with a mix of Malay and modern architecture. The physical form of the building is inspired from the typical flying fauna form of Riau, Serindit birds. To meet the technical requirements of a world-class airport, the airport runway is extended from 2,200 meters to 2,600 meters and then to 3,000 meters. There are other smaller airports in Riau which mostly serves regional or charter flights, such as Pinang Kampai Airport in Dumai, Tuanku Tambusai Airport in Pasir Pangaraian, Japura Airport in Rengat, Sei Pakning Airport in Tembilahan, Sei Pakning Airport in Sungai Pakning and Sultan Syarief Haroen II Airport in Pangkalan Kerinci.
The Trans-Sumatran Highway runs along the length of the province. Riau serves as a junction of the highway, with North Sumatra to the north, Jambi to the south and West Sumatra to the west. Most of the roads have been paved, but there are some sections that is in poor condition. Road damage was allegedly due to the large number of trucks carrying palm oil crops passing from Riau to North Sumatra or vice versa. As part of the Trans-Sumatra Toll Road program, the government is currently constructing the 131,48 km long Pekanbaru–Dumai Toll Road, which would connect Pekanbaru, the provincial capital and the port city of Dumai on the Strait of Malacca. The first section between Pekanbaru and Minas is expected to begin operation in December 2019 and the whole toll road is expected to begin operation in 2020. Another toll road connecting Pekanbaru and Padang in West Sumatra is also under the planning stage. Construction is expected to start on the Riau side due to land clearing issue on the West Sumatran side. The project would also include the construction of the construction of an 8.95 km tunnel in the Payakumbuh area that will penetrate the Bukit Barisan Mountains, which would be the longest tunnel in Indonesia.

The Port of Dumai is the largest port in the province. It serves both passengers and cargo. The port serves ferries to Batam and Tanjung Pinang in the Riau Islands, as well as international destinations such as Singapore, Johor and Malacca in Malaysia. River transportation is also important in Riau, as the province is crossed by many large rivers.

After the Pekanbaru Railway was abandoned at the end of World War II, there is currently no active railway line in Riau. However, there has been a proposal of reactivating the Pekanbaru-West Sumatra railway to connect Pekanbaru and Padang on the western coast of Sumatra, as well as building the Pekanbaru-Duri-Rantau Prapat railway which would connect Riau and the existing railway line in North Sumatra, as well as building the Pekanbaru-Jambi-Betung-Palembang railway which would connect Riau with Jambi and th existing railway line in South Sumatra. Overall, this railway system would form the Trans-Sumatra Railway.

== Tourism ==

The prime tourist attractions of Riau can be divided into natural environment, as well as the culture and history of the Riau Malay people.

Tourist attractions in Riau are diverse, ranging from marine tourism, because of the location of Riau which is directly facing the Strait of Malacca. The province has a long history and is present throughout the province, thus making its historical and cultural tourism diverse and well-known. Each of the regencies in Riau has a tourist attraction within.

The Indragiri Hilir Regency also has a number of tourist attractions, and among them is Solop Beach which is a mainstay tourist attraction in Riau. As Indragiri Hilir was once the seat of the Indragiri Sultanate, there are many remnants from the sultanate than can be still found throughout the region, such as the Indragiri Kings Cemetery in Rengat and traditional houses with typical Malay architecture. Moreover, Indragiri Hilir is also known for its many waterfalls.

For example, rice symbolizes agricultural fertility and buffalo horns that symbolize livestock. In the festival, guests were presented with a variety of entertainment, including &quot;Rarak Calempong&quot;, &quot;Panjek Pinang&quot;, and &quot;Potang Tolugh&quot;. The process of making a baganduang boat is usually blessed with a Malay ceremony. Another festival in Kuansing is the Pacu Jalur Festival. Pacu Jalur is the largest annual festival for the people of the Kuantan Singingi Regency, especially in the capital, Taluk Kuantan, which is along the bank of the Kuantan River. Originally, the festival was held to commemorate the Islamic holidays such as the Mawlid, or the commemoration of the New Year&#x27;s Eve. But after the Indonesian independence, Pacu Jalur is now usually held to celebrate the Independence Day of the Republic of Indonesia. Pacu Jalur is a long rowing boat race, similar to the Dragon Boat race in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore, which is a boat or canoe made of wood that can reach 25 to 40 meters in length. In the Taluk Kuantan area, the native people called the longboat used in the festival as &quot;Jalur&quot;. The boat rower team ranges from 50 to 60 people.

The capital of Riau, Pekanbaru, contains several tourist attractions. The Idrus Tintin Art Building is named after an Indonesian artist named Idrus Tintin. Judging from the architecture of the Idrus Tintin Art Building almost looks like a Malay Royal Palace, even though this building functioned as an art performance venue. Various works by Indonesian artists are displayed in the building. The An-Nur Great Mosque is the pride of Pekanbaru. An-Nur Great Mosque is one of the grandest mosques in Indonesia. An-Nur Great Mosque was built in 1968 from the side of its architecture which is similar to the Taj Mahal in India. Therefore, many people Riau called the mosque as the &quot;Taj Mahal of Riau&quot;. Soeman H.S Library is named after Soeman H.S, a novelist from Riau and his name is immortalized as the name of the library in downtown Pekanbaru.

This tourist spot in Riau has quite a collection of books, and has even been the largest library in Asia.

== Cuisine ==
The cuisine of Riau is heavily influenced by Malay and Minangkabau cuisines, and also slightly influenced by Chinese and Javanese cuisines. The cuisine in Riau is somewhat similar to the cuisine in the Malay Peninsula across the Strait of Malacca.

Traditional Malay cuisine in Riau has much in common with other Malay cuisines in other part of the Malay world and Sumatran cuisine which generally uses spices and coconut milk to produce spicy, fatty and thick curry.. Most dishes use basic ingredients of fish, from pangasius, mystus, anchovy, Spanish mackerels, rays, and prawns, and often uses buffalo or ox meat. Additional ingredients commonly used are Belacan. Almost every Malay dish is served with white rice or with &quot;nasi lemak&quot; and is usually eaten using hands.

&quot;Nasi Lemak&quot; is a typical Riau food in the form of rice cooked with coconut milk to provide a savory flavor and fragrant aroma. &quot;Nasi Lemak&quot; is generally served with side dishes such as eggs, fried anchovy, chili sauce, cucumber slices and other side dishes. This &quot;nasi lemak&quot; is easily found in stalls and restaurants in Pekanbaru. In archipelagic region like the Riau Islands province of Indonesia, usually seafood are used to accompany nasi lemak, such as &quot;ikan bilis&quot; (anchovy), &quot;ikan tamban&quot; (&quot;Sardinella longiceps&quot;), &quot;ikan selar kuning&quot; (&quot;Selaroides leptolepis&quot;), &quot;sotong&quot; or &quot;cumi-cumi&quot; (squid) or small prawns. The Riau islands traditional nasi lemak is quite similar to Malaysian version; it comes as a platter of coconut rice wrapped in banana leaf, with cucumber slices, small dried anchovies (&quot;ikan bilis&quot;), roasted peanuts, hard boiled egg, and hot spicy sauce (&quot;sambal&quot;). The Riau islands version however, comes with an addition of small fish locally known as &quot;ikan tamban&quot;, usually fried with &quot;sambal&quot; chili paste and very crispy, the whole fish is edible. Prawns and squids are also commonly stir-fried in chili paste as &quot;sambal udang&quot; or &quot;sambal cumi&quot;. In Indonesia, nasi lemak is often sprinkled with &quot;bawang goreng&quot; (crispy fried shallot granules). In Pekanbaru city in Sumatran province of Riau however, freshwater river fishes are commonly used as &quot;lauk&quot; to accompany nasi lemak. The freshwater fishes includes &quot;ikan selais&quot; (&quot;Kryptopterus cryptopterus&quot;) and &quot;ikan patin&quot; (&quot;Pangasius&quot;). Other fish such as &quot;ikan lomek&quot; (&quot;Harpadon nehereus&quot;) is also commonly used. These fishes are usually cooked in Minang style &quot;lado ijo&quot; (green chili pepper), minced and fried as &quot;perkedel ikan&quot;, or just plainly fried.

The &quot;Gulai Ikan Patin&quot; (Catfish soup) has a very delicious and powerful taste and it can be easily be found around Pekanbaru. &quot;Gulai Ikan Patin&quot; is a typical Pekanbaru food that has a deep yellow sauce to soak the pieces of catfish. The people of Riaum especially Pekanbaru, generally also consume other ingredients other than the catfish. There are sidedishes accompanying the dish, such as boiled yams, leaf tops and more. &quot;Gulai Ikan Patin&quot; is usually cooked with the &quot;etlingera elatior&quot; to enhance the flavouring.

&quot;Asam pedas&quot; (or &quot;Asam padeh&quot; in Minangkabau) is a Malay-Minangkabau dish that can be found in Riau and the surrounding area.. It is a type sour and spicy fish stew dish. The main ingredients in &quot;asam pedas&quot; are usually seafood or freshwater fish. They are cooked in &quot;asam&quot; (tamarind) fruit juice with chilli and spices. The cooking process involves soaking the pulp of the tamarind fruit until it is soft and then squeezing out the juice for cooking the fish. &quot;Asam&quot; paste may be substituted for convenience. Vegetables such as &quot;terong&quot; or &quot;brinjals&quot; (Indian eggplants), okra and tomatoes are added. Fish and seafood – such as mackerel, mackerel tuna, tuna, skipjack tuna, red snapper, gourami, pangasius, hemibagrus or cuttlefish – either the whole body or sometimes only the fish heads are added to make a spicy and tart fish stew. It is important that the fish remain intact for serving so generally the fish is added last. In the Riau region, the most common fish used in asam pedas is &quot;tongkol&quot; (mackerel tuna).

Aside from the main dish, typical Riau restaurant also serves local snacks. An example is the &quot;roti jala&quot;. &quot;Roti jala&quot; typical Riau food which is influenced by Malay culture. &quot;Roti jala&quot; is a dish that is generally present at large parties such as weddings. This food is made from the basic ingredients of flour which, after being cooked, will be served with a spill of durian sauce for those who like sweet foods. Aside from being served with sauce, &quot;roti jala&quot; is also commonly eaten with curry chicken, mutton or beef. &quot;Roti jala&quot; has a triangular shape that is produced from a mold. Although it is usually white in colour, some creative cooker also gives food colouring such as &quot;pandanus&quot; to make the &quot;roti jala&quot; green in colour. &quot;Roti cane&quot; is a typical Riau food. This bread has much in common with &quot;roti pratha&quot; in India and Singapore aside from the taste and eating method.

==Sports==

<text>Baraita ( &quot;external&quot; or &quot;outside&quot;; pl. &quot;bārayāṯā&quot; or in Hebrew &quot;baraitot&quot;; also baraitha, beraita; Ashkenazi pronunciation: berayse) designates a tradition in the Oral Torah of Rabbinical Judaism that is not incorporated in the Mishnah. &quot;Baraita&quot; thus refers to teachings &quot;outside&quot; of the six orders of the Mishnah. Originally, &quot;Baraita&quot; probably referred to teachings from schools outside the main Mishnaic-era yeshivas – although in later collections, individual barayata are often authored by sages of the Mishna (&quot;Tannaim&quot;).

According to Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Introduction to Mishneh Torah&quot;, the barayata were compiled by Hoshaiah Rabbah and Bar Kappara, although no other compilation was passed down that was similar to the Tosefta.

Because the Mishnah encapsulates the entire Oral Law in a purposely compact form (designed to both facilitate &quot;and&quot; necessitate oral transmission), many variant versions, additional explanations, clarifications and rulings were not included in the Mishnah. These were later compiled in works called barayata, often in the form of a list of teachings by one sage. Barayata can thus also designate collections of such traditions. The main collections of barayata are the Tosefta and the Halakhic Midrashim (Mekhilta, Sifra and Sifre).

The authority of the barayata is somewhat less than that of the Mishnah. Nevertheless, these works are the basic &quot;proof-text&quot; cross-referenced by the Talmudic sages in their analysis and interpretation of the Mishna; see Gemara. Here, a teaching from the &quot;baraita&quot; is usually introduced by the Aramaic words &quot;tanya&quot; &quot;It was orally taught&quot;, &quot;tana&quot;, or &quot;tanu rabanan&quot; &quot;Our Rabbis have orally taught&quot;, whereas &quot;tnan&quot; &quot;We have orally taught&quot; introduces quotations from the Mishnah. Anonymous barayata are often attributed to particular tannaim by the Talmud. In the Jerusalem Talmud, references to the baraita are less common.

The style of the baraita is basically indistinguishable from that of the Mishna, but some come closer to Mishnaic idiom than others. For example, the second chapter of &quot;Kallah Rabbathi&quot;, a baraita compilation, is often appended to &quot;Pirkei Avot&quot;, as both are similar in style and content.

<text>India has several Special Forces (SF) units, with the various branches of the Indian Armed Forces having their own separate special forces units. The Para SF of the Indian Army, MARCOS of the Indian Navy and the Garud Commando Force of the Indian Air Force. There are other special forces which are not controlled by the military, but operate under civilian organisations, such as the National Security Guard under the Home Ministry and the Special Group under the Research and Analysis Wing, the external intelligence agency of India. Small groups from the military SF units are deputed in the Armed Forces Special Operations Division, a unified command and control structure.

R&amp;AW, has separate special forces under its control, namely the Special Group and the Special Frontier Force. While the COBRA commandos are a special guerrilla warfare fighter unit of the CRPF known for their jungle fighting tactics India&#x27;s only jungle warriors special force

==Indian Army==
===Para (Special Forces)===
The Paratrooper (Special Forces), or Para (SF), are the special forces of the Indian Army.
This unit was created in June 1966 in the aftermath of the 1965 Indo-Pakistani war. An impromptu commando unit called Meghdoot Force, which took part in the 1965 war, formed the first nucleus of the permanent Para commando battalion which was to be raised under the Parachute Regiment. By 1969, the unit had grown into 2 battalions, viz. the 9 Para and the 10 Para. The unit&#x27;s first combat missions were conducted during the 1971 Indo-Pakistani war in which they undertook raids against Pakistan&#x27;s military.

In 1988, 6 Para spearheaded the only foreign intervention operation conducted by Indian Armed Forces to restore democracy in Maldives by the order of prime minister Rajiv Gandhi. The operation was code-named Operation Cactus. Operation Cactus was launched to thwart a coup against the government of President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom. In the late 1980s, the Para (SF) were deployed in Sri Lanka where they conducted helicopter-borne assaults and security operations.

Since the 1990s, the Para (SF) have been deployed on counter-terrorism operations in the Kashmir region against insurgents. These operations include raids and ambushes. In 1999, Para (SF) undertook operations against Pakistan&#x27;s military during the Kargil war which included raids against Pakistani infantry and special forces. In 2002, the 2 Para (SF) participated in Operation Khukri in Sierra Leone to rescue 223 soldiers of the Indian Army&#x27;s 5/8 Gorkha Rifles who were deployed as UN peacekeepers but were surrounded by militants from the Revolutionary United Front of Sierra Leone. Some of the later reported missions carried out by Para (SF) include the counter-insurgency operation purportedly undertaken inside Myanmar in 2015, and the 2016 Surgical Strikes. 
The unit 21 Para (SF) is reported to have killed many terrorists of Meitei and Kuki groups along the India Myanmar boundary in 2022-23 while also avenging killing of a Commanding Officer of Assam Rifles and his family and eliminating the masterminds of ambush on Army column in 2015 earning many awards, accolades and praise for the leadership. This has firmly established the unit as the best in Indian Army. 

The list of PARA (SF) Battalions is as follows:

* 1 PARA (SF) &quot;Pratham&quot; 
* 2 PARA (SF) &quot;Predators&quot; 
* 3 PARA (SF) &quot;Russell&#x27;s Vipers&quot; 
* 4 PARA (SF) &quot;Daggers&quot; 
* 5 PARA (SF) &quot;Batalik&quot; 
* 6 PARA (SF) &quot;Sakht Para&quot;
* 7 PARA (SF) &quot;SE7EN&quot;
* 9 PARA (SF) &quot;Mountain Rats/Pirates&quot; 
* 10 PARA (SF) &quot;Desert Scorpions&quot; 
* 11 PARA (SF) &quot;Helleven&quot; 
* 12 PARA (SF) &quot;Dirty Dozens&quot; 
* 13 PARA (SF) &quot;Thunderbolts&quot; 
* 21 PARA (SF) &quot;Waghnakhs&quot; 
* 23 PARA (SF) &quot;Devil&#x27;s Own&quot; 
* 29 PARA (SF) &quot;Warriors N Monks&quot;

==Indian Navy==
===MARCOS===
First conceived in 1985, the Marine Commando Force, also called MARCOS, was raised in February 1987. It is the special forces unit of the Indian Navy. Initially, the U.S. Navy SEALs and British special forces trained a few officers of the Indian navy who formed the first core of MARCOS. Months after their creation, MARCOS were deployed in Sri Lanka against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in July 1987. In the 1990s, MARCOS undertook numerous operations such as Operation Tasha (1991) against the LTTE, and Operation Zabardust (1992) against a ship that was smuggling arms and in support of the United Nations in Somalia (1993). They also participated in the 1999 Kargil War. Since 1995, MARCOS are permanently deployed for counter-terrorism operations in Jammu and Kashmir against militants. MARCOS had participated in efforts against the 2008 Mumbai attacks alongside the National Security Guards but their effectiveness was diluted due to bureaucratic indecision. MARCOS have also been deployed in anti-piracy operations.

After a 10-week-long basic training, MARCOS are sent to train alongside Indian Army&#x27;s Para (SF) for 3 weeks. Advanced training follows, during which MARCOS learn skills such as sky-diving, weapons training, counter-insurgency, languages, and warfare in different terrains, among other things. Each MARCOS squad, called &quot;Prahar&quot;, is composed of 8 soldiers.

Some of the responsibilities of MARCOS are-

* Providing support to Amphibious operations.
* Special surveillance and reconnaissance operations.
* Clandestine operations inside hostile territory, including diving operations and raids.
* Counter-terrorism operations.

==Indian Air Force==
===Garud Commando Force===
The Garud commandos are the special forces of the Indian Air Force (IAF). Their tasks include counter-terrorism, hostage rescue, providing security to IAF&#x27;s assets, and various air force-specific special operations. First conceived in 2002, this unit was officially established on 6 February 2004.

All Garuds are volunteers who have imparted a 52-week basic training, which includes a three-month probation followed by special operations training, basic airborne training, and other warfare and survival skills. The last phase of basic training sees Garuds being deployed to get combat experience. Advanced training follows, which includes specialised weapons training.

The mandated tasks of the Garuds include direct action, special reconnaissance, rescuing downed pilots in hostile territory, establishing airbases in hostile territory, and providing air-traffic control to these airbases. The Garuds also undertake suppression of enemy air defences and the destruction of other enemy assets such as radars, evaluation of the outcomes of Indian airstrikes and use laser designators to guide Indian airstrikes.

The security of IAF installations and assets is usually performed by the Air Force Police and the Defence Security Corps even though some critical assets are protected by the Garuds.

== Research and Analysis Wing ==
=== Special Frontier Force ===

The Special Frontier Force was raised in 1962 to defend India&#x27;s eastern border and to perform covert cross border operations.

=== Special Group ===

The Special Group is a clandestine special forces unit of the Research and Analysis Wing. It was formed in 1981. The responsibilities of the Special Group includes clandestine intelligence operations and covert operations, with which the Government of India may not wish to be overtly associated.

== National Security Guard ==
The National Security Guard (NSG) is a specialized counter-terrorism federal contingency force. It was formally created in 1986. It is based on the British Army&#x27;s Special Air Service and the German GSG 9. The NSG is popularly referred to as the &#x27;Black Cats&#x27; due to its distinct black uniforms. It consists of the following two elements-

* SAG (Special Action Group), which recruits personnel from the Indian Army.
*SRG (Special Rangers Group), which recruits personnel from the Central Armed Police Forces, and State police

==In popular culture==

*&quot;&quot; (2019) is an account of the tactical strikes conducted by the Para (Special Forces) on the camps of terrorists across the Line of Control in retaliation for the 2016 Uri attack.

<text>Slash-and-burn agriculture is a farming method that involves the cutting and burning of plants in a forest or woodland to create a field called a swidden. The method begins by cutting down the trees and woody plants in an area. The downed vegetation, or &quot;slash&quot;, is then left to dry, usually right before the rainiest part of the year. Then, the biomass is burned, resulting in a nutrient-rich layer of ash which makes the soil fertile, as well as temporarily eliminating weed and pest species. After about three to five years, the plot&#x27;s productivity decreases due to depletion of nutrients along with weed and pest invasion, causing the farmers to abandon the field and move to a new area. The time it takes for a swidden to recover depends on the location and can be as little as five years to more than twenty years, after which the plot can be slashed and burned again, repeating the cycle. In Bangladesh and India, the practice is known as [[jhum]] or jhoom.

Slash-and-burn is a type of shifting cultivation, an agricultural system in which farmers routinely move from one cultivable area to another. A rough estimate is that 200–300 million people worldwide use slash-and-burn. Slash-and-burn causes temporary deforestation. Ashes from the burnt trees help farmers by providing nutrients for the soil. In low density of human population this approach is very sustainable but the technique is not scalable for large human populations.

A similar term is assarting, which is the clearing of forests, usually (but not always) for the purpose of agriculture. Assarting does not include burning.

==History==
Historically, slash-and-burn cultivation has been practiced throughout much of the world. Fire was already used by hunter-gatherers before the invention of agriculture, and still is in present times. Clearings created by the fire were made for many reasons, such as to provide new growth for game animals and to promote certain kinds of edible plants.

During the Neolithic Revolution, groups of hunter-gatherers domesticated various plants and animals, permitting them to settle down and practice agriculture, which provided more nutrition per hectare than hunting and gathering. Some groups could easily plant their crops in open fields along river valleys, but others had forests covering their land. Thus, since Neolithic times, slash-and-burn agriculture has been widely used to clear land to make it suitable for crops and livestock.

Large groups wandering in the woodlands was once a common form of society in European prehistory. The extended family burned and cultivated their swidden plots, sowed one or more crops, and then proceeded on to the next plot.

==Technique==

Slash-and-burn fields are typically used and owned by a family until the soil is exhausted. At this point the ownership rights are abandoned, the family clears a new field, and trees and shrubs are permitted to grow on the former field. After a few decades, another family or clan may then use the land and claim usufructuary rights. In such a system there is typically no market in farmland, so land is not bought or sold on the open market and land rights are traditional.

In slash-and-burn agriculture, forests are typically cut months before a dry season. The &quot;slash&quot; is permitted to dry and then burned in the following dry season. The resulting ash fertilizes the soil and the burned field is then planted at the beginning of the next rainy season with crops such as rice, maize, cassava, or other staples. This work was once done using simple tools such as machetes, axes, hoes and shovels.

==Benefits and drawbacks==

This system of agriculture provides millions of people with food and income. It has been ecologically sustainable for thousands of years. Because the leached soil in many tropical regions, such as the Amazon, are nutritionally extremely poor, slash-and-burn is one of the only types of agriculture which can be practiced in these areas. Slash-and-burn farmers typically plant a variety of crops, instead of a monoculture, and contribute to a higher biodiversity due to creating mosaic habitats. The general ecosystem is not harmed in traditional slash-and-burn, aside from a small temporary patch.

This technique is most unsuitable for the production of cash crops. A huge amount of land, or a low density of people, is required for slash-and-burn. When slash-and-burn is practiced in the same area too often, because the human population density has increased to an unsustainable level, the forest will eventually be destroyed.

==Regionally==
===Asia===
Tribal groups in the northeastern Indian states of Tripura, Arunachal Pradesh, Meghalaya, Mizoram and Nagaland and the Bangladeshi districts of Rangamati, Khagrachari, Bandarban and Sylhet refer to slash-and-burn agriculture as podu, &quot;jhum&quot; or &quot;jhoom&quot; cultivation. The system involves clearing land, by fire or clear-felling, for economically important crops such as upland rice, vegetables or fruits. After a few cycles, the land&#x27;s fertility declines and a new area is chosen. &quot;Jhum&quot; cultivation is most often practiced on the slopes of thickly-forested hills. Cultivators cut the treetops to allow sunlight to reach the land, burning the trees and grasses for fresh soil. Although it is believed that this helps fertilize the land, it can leave it vulnerable to erosion. Holes are made for the seeds of crops such as sticky rice, maize, eggplant and cucumber. After considering &quot;jhum&quot;″s effects, the government of Mizoram has introduced a policy to end the method in the state.

Vietnam is home to a diverse range of ethnic groups. Some of these groups form primarily rural communities that reside far from the larger cities of the country, living on swidden fields where slash-and-burn agriculture is still in regular use as a part of everyday life.

===Americas===

Some American civilizations, like the Maya, have used slash-and-burn cultivation since ancient times. American Indians in the United States also used fire in agriculture and hunting. In the Amazon, many peoples such as the Yanomami Indians also live off the slash and burn method due to the Amazon&#x27;s poor soil quality.

=== Northern Europe ===
Slash-and-burn techniques were used in northeastern Sweden in agricultural systems. In Sweden, the practice is known as .

Telkkämäki Nature Reserve in Kaavi, Finland, is an open-air museum where slash-and-burn agriculture is demonstrated. Farm visitors can see how people farmed when slash-and-burn was the norm in the Northern Savonian region of eastern Finland beginning in the 15th century. Areas of the reserve are burnt each year.

 is a Swedish and Norwegian term for slash-and-burn agriculture derived from the Old Norse word , which means &quot;to burn&quot;. This practice originated in Russia in the region of Novgorod and was widespread in Finland and Eastern Sweden during the Medieval period. It spread to western Sweden in the 16th century when Finnish settlers were encouraged to migrate there by King Gustav Vasa to help clear the dense forests. Later, when the Finns were persecuted by the local Swedes, farming was spread by refugees to eastern Norway, more specifically in the eastern part of Solør, in the area bordering Sweden known as Finnskogen (&quot;the Finnish woods&quot;).

The practice also spread to New Sweden in North America. Reinforced by the use of fire in agriculture and hunting by American Indians, it became an important part of pioneering in America.
====Description of process====

 involved stripping a ring of bark completely around the trunk of coniferous trees like pine or spruce or felling them, allowing them to dry, setting fire to the dried forest and growing crops on the fertile ash-covered soil. The resulting ash was highly fertile, but only for a short period. The clearing was initially planted to rye as soon as the ash had fully settled and sufficiently cooled. When the rain came, it packed the ash around the rye. The rye germinated and grew prolifically, with anywhere from 25 to 100 stalks (or straws), each with multiple grains.

Only two tools were required, the axe and the sickle. The axe cut the trees to start the cycle. When the rye had ripened, it was harvested with a sickle, which could reach among the rocks and stumps where a scythe would have been ineffective.

In the second and third year the field would be sown with turnips or cabbages. It then might be grazed for several years before being allowed to return to woodland.

==== culture====

 required felling new forest and burning a new area every year. It was necessary to allow the former fields to regrow with forest for 10–30 years before repeating the cycle. As a result, the dwellings were often many kilometers from the fields. Furthermore, since the process was man-power intensive, extended families tended to work together and live in compact communities.

The farming approach required a large area. When forest was plentiful, the Finns were very prosperous. As population grew and restrictions were placed on the forest which could be burned, it became increasingly difficult. By 1710, during the conflict with Sweden, because of their suspect loyalties Norwegian authorities considered expelling them from the border area, but did not do so because it was judged they were too poor to survive if evicted.
==Research==
This type of agriculture is discouraged by many developmental or environmentalist organisations, with the main alternatives being promoted as switching to more intensive, permanent farming methods, or promoting a shift from farming to working in different, higher-paying industries altogether. Other organisations promote helping farmers achieve higher productivity by introducing new techniques.

Not allowing the slashed vegetation to burn completely and ploughing the resultant charcoal into the soil (slash-and-char) has been proposed as a way to boost yields.

Promoters of a project from the early 2000s claimed that slash-and-burn cultivation could be reduced if farmers grew black pepper crops, turmeric, beans, corn, cacao, rambutan, and citrus between &quot;Inga&quot; trees, which they termed &#x27;Inga alley cropping&#x27;.

A method of improving the yields in a type of traditional assarting cultivation used to grow common beans in Central America called &#x27;slash-and-cover&#x27; has been proposed by additionally planting leguminous shrubs to act as a fallow crop after the soil is exhausted and one is ready to clear a new patch of forest.

<doc id="262713" wikidata="Q4688003" url="?curid=262713" title="Aerial bombing of cities">
<text>The aerial bombing of cities is an optional element of strategic bombing, which became widespread in warfare during World War I. The bombing of cities grew to a vast scale in World War II and is still practiced today. The development of aerial bombardment marked an increased capacity of armed forces to deliver ordnance from the air against combatants, military bases, and factories, with a greatly reduced risk to its ground forces. The killing of civilians and non-combatants in bombed cities has variously been a deliberate goal of strategic bombing, or unavoidable collateral damage resulting from intent and technology. A number of multilateral efforts have been made to restrict the use of aerial bombardment so as to protect non-combatants and other civilians.

==Before World War I==

===Kites===
Incendiary kites were first used in warfare by the Chinese. During the Song dynasty the &quot;Fire Crow&quot;, a kite carrying incendiary powder, a fuse, and a burning stick of incense was developed as a weapon. Walter de Milemete&#x27;s 1326 &quot;De nobilitatibus, sapientiis, et prudentiis regum&quot; treatise depicts a group of knights flying kites laden with a black-powder filled firebomb over the wall of city. In the 17th century, the forces of Thai king Phetracha tied gunpowder barrels to kites used for airborne assault.

===First Italian War of Independence ===
In 1849, Austrian forces besieging Venice during the First Italian War of Independence launched some 200 incendiary balloons, each carrying a 24- to 30-pound bomb that was to be dropped from the balloon with a time fuse over the besieged city. The balloons were launched from land and from the Austrian navy ship SMS &quot;Vulcano&quot; that acted as a balloon carrier, though the attack ended in failure as winds blew the balloons away, none reaching their intended target.

===Italian Invasion of Libya===
The first ever air raid was conducted during the Italo-Turkish War by Italian forces against the Ottoman province of Libya on November 1, 1911. Giulio Gavotti dropped 1.5 kg of bombs on Ain Zara, a village 8 km west of the capital Tripoli.

===Balkan War===
Adrianople (presently Edirne) was bombed by Bulgaria in 1912 in the First Balkan War. Historically, it was the first bombardment of a city from a heavier-than-air aircraft.
In the morning of 29 October 1912 at 9:30 a.m. the plane Albatros F-3 took off from an airfield near the village of Mustafa Pasha – present day Svilengrad, Bulgaria. The pilot was captain Radul Mikov with spotter and bombardier Prodan Tarakchiev. The airfield was specially created to carry out the take off and landing. According to the report weather conditions were perfect. The flight lasted for 1 hour and 20 minutes and the altitude was 500m. During the flight the crew flew over the city of Edirne, discovered hidden Ottoman forces in the nearby villages and flew towards to city railroad station, near the village of Karaagach. The plane was equipped with two bombs, which were released at 10:00 am over the station. The crew landed successfully at the airfield with 4 holes on the hull.
A number of journalists and military attachés attended the site.

===Mexican Revolution===
In May 1914, during the revolution of 1910–17, General Venustiano Carranza, later president, ordered a biplane to bomb Neveria Hill adjacent to the downtown area of Mazatlán in order to take the city. The bomb landed not on target but in a city street and in the process killed four civilians, including a French diplomat, and wounded several others.

==World War I==
The first civilian target to be bombed from the air was the Belgian city of Antwerp. This city, at that moment the National Redoubt of Belgium, was bombed during the night of 24–25 August 1914. Instead of targeting the surrounding fortresses, the Zeppelin LZ 25&#x27;s intention was to bomb the clearly distinguishable historical centre of the city. The zeppelin dropped approximately ten bombs, killing ten people and injuring forty.
The British Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) undertook the first Entente strategic bombing missions on 22 September 1914 and 8 October, when it bombed the Zeppelin bases in Cologne and Düsseldorf. The aeroplanes carried twenty-pound bombs, and at least one airship was destroyed. On 19 January 1915 two German Zeppelins dropped 24 fifty-kilogram (110 lb) high-explosive bombs and ineffective three-kilogram incendiaries on the English towns of Great Yarmouth, Sheringham, King&#x27;s Lynn, and the surrounding villages; in all, four people were killed, 16 injured, and monetary damage was estimated at £7,740.

London was bombed for the first time on 30 May 1915. In July 1916, the German government allowed directed raids against urban centers, sparking 23 airship raids in 1916 in which 125 tons of ordnance were dropped, killing 293 people and injuring 691. Gradually British air defenses improved and the Germans also introduced large bomber aircraft for bombing Britain. In 1917 and 1918 there were only eleven Zeppelin raids against England, and the final raid occurred on 5 August 1918, which resulted in the death of KK Peter Strasser, commander of the German Naval Airship Department. By the end of the war, 51 raids had been undertaken, in which 5,806 bombs were dropped, killing 557 people and injuring 1,358. In the course of the Zeppelin raids the Germans lost more than half their airships and 40% of their crew. It has been argued that the raids were effective far beyond material damage inflicted, in diverting and hampering wartime production, and diverting twelve squadrons and over 10,000 men to air defenses.
The British developed an Independent Force of long-range bombers that could bomb Berlin, but the war ended before these raids began.

After the war, bombers&#x27; increasing sophistication led to the general belief that aerial bombing would both destroy cities and be impossible to stop; as Stanley Baldwin stated in a 1932 speech, &quot;The bomber will always get through&quot;.

== Interwar period ==

===Iraqi revolt against the British===
After World War I, there were protests in Iraq against continued British rule. Many Iraqis across a wide spectrum of opinion opposed the British Mandate for Iraq. The Iraqi revolt against the British began, with peaceful demonstrations in May 1920. Initial demands were rejected by the British administration, and fighting broke out in June 1920. This was suppressed, with many deaths, and at very high costs to the Empire. A policy of &#x27;aerial policing&#x27;, an invention of Winston Churchill&#x27;s was brought in. This amounted to aerial bombing of rebelling tribesmen, followed up by pacification by ground troops. This continued up to the mid 1920s. The aerial campaign included Sir Arthur Harris, who commanded a Vickers Vernon squadron engaged in the bombing and strafing of revolting tribesmen. Harris once remarked that &quot;the only thing the Arab understands is the heavy hand.&quot;

===Somaliland Campaign===
Following the end of World War I, the British stepped up their efforts in their war against the Dervish movement, their sultan Diiriye Guure and emir, the so-called &quot;Mad Mullah&quot;, whom they had been fighting for the control the area formerly known as British Somaliland. However, they had been unable to defeat the Dervish movement for nearly 25 years. In January 1920, the British launched a combined aerial and land attack against the Dhulbahante garesas, bombarding Taleeh, the capital of the revolt. The Somaliland Campaign has been described as one of the bloodiest and longest-running conflicts in the history of sub-Saharan Africa and the Somali forces are noted for concurrently repelling the invading British, Italian and Abyssinian forces for a period of 25 years.

=== Tulsa race massacre ===
In the United States during the Tulsa race massacre of May 31 – June 1, 1921, private aircraft flown by white men dropped kerosene bombs on the Greenwood neighborhood.

===Cristero War===

During the Cristero War in Mexico in 1929, Irish pilot and mercenary Patrick Murphy mistakenly dropped several improvised &quot;suitcase bombs&quot; on the border town of Naco, Arizona, while bombing government forces in the adjacent town of Naco, Sonora, for the Cristero revolutionaries. The bombing, which caused damage to many buildings and injured several bystanders on the American side of the international border, became the first aerial bombardment of the Continental United States by a foreign power in American history.

===Second Italo-Abyssinian War===
The Italians used aircraft against the Ethiopian cities in the Second Italo-Abyssinian War. For example, in February 1936, the Italian invasion forces in the south prepared for a major thrust towards the city of Harar. On 22 March, the &quot;Regia Aeronautica&quot; bombed Harar and Jijiga as a prelude. Both cities were reduced to ruins even though Harar had been declared an &quot;open city&quot;.

===Spanish Civil War===
During the Spanish Civil War, the Nationalists under Francisco Franco made extensive use of aerial bombing on civilian targets. Nazi Germany gave aircraft to Franco to support the overthrow of the Spanish Republican government. The first major example of this came in November 1936, when German and Spanish aircraft bombed Republican-held Madrid; this bombardment was sustained throughout the Siege of Madrid. Barcelona and Valencia were also targeted in this way. On 26 April 1937, the German &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (Condor Legion) bombed the Spanish city of Guernica carrying out the most high-profile aerial attack of the war. This act caused worldwide revulsion and was the subject of a famous painting by Picasso, but by the standards of bombings during World War II, casualties were fairly minor (estimates ranging from 500 to 1,500).

Shortly after, the front-page headlines of the &quot;Diario de Almeria&quot;, dated June 3, 1937, referred to the press in London and Paris carrying the news of the &quot;criminal bombardment of Almeria by German planes&quot;.

Barcelona was bombarded for three days beginning on 16 March 1938, at the height of the Spanish Civil War. Under the command of the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini, Italian aircraft stationed on the island of Majorca attacked 13 times dropping 44 tons of bombs, aimed at the civil population. The medieval Cathedral of Barcelona suffered bomb damage and more than one thousand people died, including many children. The number of people injured is estimated to be in the thousands. Many others Spanish towns and cities were bombed by the German &quot;Legion Condor&quot; and the Italian &quot;Aviazione Legionaria&quot; among them Jaen, Durango, Granollers and Alicante.

The Spanish Republican government also used aerial bombings, but not as extensively, as they did not have as many planes available. Cities such as Valladolid, Granada, Sevilla, Zaragoza or Burgos were bombarded, killing some people. The biggest aerial attack against civil population was in Cabra, a small town away from the war front, and with no strategic value, that was bombed due to an error. 109 people were killed and more than 200 wounded. Planes coming from Barcelona launched three bombs against the Cathedral-Basilica of Our Lady of the Pillar on August 3, 1936. The bombs failed to detonate, but did damage one of the cupolas painted by Goya. The fact was considered a miracle, as, if the bombs had exploded, the eastern half of the Cathedral would have been completely destroyed.

===Second Sino-Japanese War===
During the Manchurian Incident of 1931, the Japanese widely used airplanes to indiscriminately bomb key targets and cities, such as Mukden. After the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, the Imperial Japanese Army Air Service, in conjunction with the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, began relentlessly bombing Shanghai, Beijing (Peking), Tianjin (Tientsin) and several cities on the Chinese coast from the beginning of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937.

The bombing campaigns on Nanjing and Canton which started in September 1937 evoked protests from the Western powers culminating in a resolution by the Far Eastern Advisory Committee of the League of Nations. An example of the many expressions of indignation came from Lord Cranborne, the British Under-Secretary of State For Foreign Affairs: Words cannot express the feelings of profound horror with which the news of these raids had been received by the whole civilized world. They are often directed against places far from the actual area of hostilities. The military objective, where it exists, seems to take a completely second place. The main object seems to be to inspire terror by the indiscriminate slaughter of civilians ...
==World War II==

===European Theater===

At the beginning of World War II, bombing of cities prior to invasion was an integral part of Nazi Germany&#x27;s strategy. In the first stages of war, the Germans carried out many bombings of towns and cities in Poland (1939), including the capital Warsaw (also bombed in 1944), with Wieluń being the first city destroyed by 75%. The Soviet Union also attempted strategic bombing against Poland and Finland, bombing Helsinki.

Rotterdam was bombed by Germany at 14 May 1940. The city had already surrendered an hour earlier and the attack was called off, but this did not reach the already flying bombers.

Germany began aerial bombing of British cities immediately after the British declaration of war on Germany in September 1939, while the first British bombing raids against Germany were on the night of 15/16 May 1940, with 78 bombers against oil targets, 9 against steelworks and 9 against marshalling yards, all military and industrial targets in the German hinterland. Oil remained the main British objective until the summer of 1941, although German cities and towns were regularly bombed from May 1940. Previous raids had been carried out by the RAF, but when targets were not found, the bombers returned without making an attack.

After the Fall of France, the Luftwaffe redirected its full attention to the United Kingdom. The scale of the attack increased greatly in July 1940, with 258 civilians killed, and again in August with 1,075 dead. During the night of 25 August, British bombers raided targets in and around Greater Berlin for the first time, in response to the misdirected bombing of Oxford Street and the West End by the Luftwaffe while it was bombing the London docks. On 4 September 1940 Hitler, frustrated by the RAF&#x27;s superiority over the Luftwaffe and enraged by its bombing of German cities, decided to retaliate by bombing London and other cities in the UK. On 7 September the Luftwaffe began massed attacks on London. The bombing campaign was known in the UK as &quot;the Blitz&quot;, and ran from September 1940 through to May 1941. The Coventry Blitz and the Belfast Blitz were two of the heaviest of all bombings by the Luftwaffe, killing 568–1,000 civilians of Coventry, killing over 1,100 civilians in Belfast, and destroying much of both city centres.

British bombing policy evolved during the war. In the beginning, the RAF was forbidden to attack urban targets in Germany due to the risk of accidental civilian casualties. Following a German attack on military targets in the Orkney Islands on 16 March 1940 that killed a civilian, the RAF mounted an attack on the seaplane base on the island of Sylt. The RAF began attacking transport targets west of the Rhine on the night of 10 May following the German invasion of the Low Countries, and military targets in the rest of Germany after the bombing of Rotterdam. On 9 September 1940 RAF crews were instructed that due to the &quot;indiscriminate&quot; nature of German bombing, if they failed to find their assigned targets they were to attack targets of opportunity rather than bring their bombs home. On the 15/16 December the RAF carried out its first area bombing attack (destroying 45% of the city of Mannheim), officially in response to the raid on Coventry.

In 1942, the goals of the British attacks were defined: the primary goal was the so-called &quot;morale bombing&quot;, to weaken the will of the civil population to resist. Following this directive intensive bombing of highly populated city centers and working class quarters started. On 30 May 1942, the RAF Bomber Command launched the first &quot;1,000 bomber raid&quot; when 1,046 aircraft bombed Cologne in Operation Millennium, dropping over 2,000 tons of high explosive and incendiaries on the medieval town and burning it from end to end. 411 civilians and 85 combatants were killed, more than 130,000 had to leave the city.

Two further 1,000 bomber raids were executed over Essen and Bremen, but to less effect than the destruction at Cologne. The effects of the massive raids using a combination of blockbuster bombs and incendiaries created firestorms in some cites. The most extreme examples were caused by the bombing of Hamburg in Operation Gomorrah (45,000 dead), and the bombings of Kassel (10,000 dead), Darmstadt (12,500 dead), Pforzheim (21,200 dead), Swinemuende (23,000 dead), and Dresden (25,000 dead).

The Allies also bombed urban areas in the other countries, including occupied France (Caen) and the major industrial cities of northern Italy, like Milan and Turin. Some cities were bombed at the different times by the Luftwaffe and the Allies, for example Belgrade in Yugoslavia and Bucharest in Romania.

The Luftwaffe also bombed cities in the Soviet Union, destroying Stalingrad in a massive air raid at the start of the Battle of Stalingrad and bombing Leningrad during the siege of the city of 1941–1943. The Soviet bombing of the German cities was limited in comparison with the RAF bombing (destruction caused by the Soviet army was mainly due to the land artillery). The Soviet Air Force also bombed Budapest in Hungary.

===Asiatic-Pacific Theater===
In the Asiatic-Pacific Theater, Japan continued to bomb Chinese cities and expanded its air operations towards others in Asia such as Singapore, Rangoon, and Mandalay. In the first few months of the war with the Western Powers, Japan projected its airpower on settlements as distant as Honolulu, Darwin, and Unalaska.

The capture of the Mariana Islands in 1944 enabled the United States Army Air Forces to reach the Japanese home islands using the Boeing B-29 Superfortress. The U.S. firebombed Tokyo on the night of March 9–10, 1945, and killed more than 100,000 people in the deadliest conventional bombing in history, known as &quot;Operation Meetinghouse&quot;. In a few hours, 100,000 people who were in Tokyo including civilians died either by the bombing or the conflagration that followed the bombing by 325 B-29&#x27;s night attacks. The bombing was meant to burn wooden buildings and indeed the bombing caused fire that created a 50 m/s wind that is comparable to tornadoes. A total of 381,300 bombs amounting to 1783 tons, were used in the bombing.

After the successful &quot;Operation Meetinghouse&quot; raid, the USAAF went on to firebomb other Japanese cities in effort to pulverize the Japanese war industry and shatter Japanese civilian morale. From March to August 1945, the U.S. firebombing of 67 Japanese cities had killed 350,000 civilians. In addition, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki killed 120,000 people.

== Since World War II ==

===Korean War===

During the Korean War of 1950–1953, U.S.-led UN air forces heavily bombed the cities in North Korea and the North-occupied South Korea, including their respective capital cities. There were also plans to use nuclear weapons against North Korea and the People&#x27;s Republic of China.

===Vietnam War===
From 1965 to 1968, during the Vietnam War, the United States Air Force conducted an aerial campaign known as Operation Rolling Thunder. The campaign began with interdiction of supply lines in rural areas of southern North Vietnam but incrementally spread northward throughout the country. In 1966, restrictions against bombing the capital city of Hanoi and the country&#x27;s largest port, Haiphong, were lifted, and they were bombed by the USAF and Navy. The bombing of the city centers continued to be prohibited. However, the South Vietnamese cities seized by the communists were bombed, including the former capital of Huế during the 1968 Tet Offensive.

The Republic of Vietnam Air Force bombed contested cities in South Vietnam in 1968, 1972 and 1975, while the Vietnam People&#x27;s Air Force attacked Southern cities (including the capital city of Saigon) in 1975.

===Arab-Israeli Conflict===

Israeli cities were bombed by Egyptian, Syrian and Jordanian aircraft during the 1948 Arab-Israeli war and the Six-Day War. The bombing included attacks on some of Israel&#x27;s largest cities, such as Tel Aviv, Jerusalem and Haifa. The Lebanese capital of Beirut was attacked by the Israeli aircraft during the Siege of Beirut in 1982, and during the 2006 Lebanon War (using guided munitions). Israel also conducted air strikes targeting Palestinian targets during the Second Intifada, including against Hamas in Gaza.

===Wars in Afghanistan===
In March 1979, in response to an uprising, the Khalq-control army of Democratic Republic of Afghanistan carpet-bombed the Afghanistan&#x27;s third-largest city of Herat, causing massive destruction and some 5,000 to 25,000 deaths. Herat was also repeatedly bombed during the following Soviet involvement in the Afghan civil war.

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, the U.S.-led coalition attacked the urban targets in Afghanistan using mainly precision-guided munitions (or &quot;smart bombs&quot;). The United States government maintains that it has a policy of striking only significant combatant targets while doing all possible to avoid what it terms &quot;collateral damage&quot; to civilians and non-combatants during the U.S.-led war in Afghanistan.

===Iran–Iraq War===

Saddam Hussein&#x27;s Iraq attacked civilian targets in Iranian cities in the War of the Cities during the Iran–Iraq War in the 1980s, with Iranians retaliating in kind (both sides soon switched to ballistic missile attacks). Iraqi aircraft also bombed the Iraqi Kurdistan city of Halabja in 1988 with conventional and chemical weapons in 1988, killing more than 5,000 people in the largest aerial poison gas attack in history.

=== Somalia&#x27;s campaign against Isaaq ===
In 1988 Somali Air Force aircraft conducted intense aerial bombardment of major Isaaq cities targeting civilian Isaaqs during its campaign against Somali National Movement in the north of the country. Civilians were also strafed by Somali Air Force aircraft as they were fleeing the aerial bombardment. The artillery shelling and aerial bombardment caused the deaths of estimated 50,000–200,000 Isaaq civilians, as well as the complete destruction of Somalia&#x27;s second and third largest cities. It also caused up to 500,000 Somalis (primarily of the Isaaq clan) to flee and cross the border into Hartasheikh in Ethiopia as refugees in what was described as &quot;one of the fastest and largest forced movements of people recorded in Africa&quot;, and resulted in the creation of the world&#x27;s largest refugee camp then (1988), with another 400,000 being internally displaced. The scale of destruction led to Hargeisa being known as the &#x27;Dresden of Africa&#x27;.

===Gulf War===

The Iraqi Air Force attacked Kuwait City in 1990 and bombed their own cities during the 1991 uprisings in Iraq, targeting civilians with the use of bomb-carrying helicopters (use of airplanes was banned by the Coalition as part of the ceasefire agreement that ended hostilities of the Gulf War but not the war itself).

UN-led coalition aircraft attacked targets in Iraqi cities, including in the capital Baghdad and the largest southern city of Basra during Operation Desert Storm in 1991.

On 13 February 1991, a United States Air Force (USAF) warplane fired two laser-guided missiles at an air raid shelter in the Al-A&#x27;amiriya neighborhood of Baghdad, killing at least 408 civilians sheltering there. U.S. officials subsequently claimed that the shelter also served as a communications center for the Iraqi military. BBC correspondent Jeremy Bowen, who was one of the first television reporters on the scene, was given access to the shelter and claimed that he did not find any evidence of it being used by the Iraqi military. His claims were later contradicted by Iraqi general Wafiq al-Samarrai, who claimed that the shelter was used by the Iraqi Intelligence Service, and that Saddam Hussein had personally made visits to it. The day after the bombing of the shelter, a Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter jet fired two laser-guided missiles which were aimed at a bridge in Fallujah which was used as part of an Iraqi military supply line. The missiles malfunctioned and struck Fallujah&#x27;s largest marketplace (which was situated in a residential area), killing between 50 and 150 non-combatants and wounding many more. After news of the mistake became public, an RAF spokesman, Group Captain David Henderson issued a statement noting that the missile had malfunctioned but admitted that the Royal Air Force had made an error.

===Yugoslav wars===

At the beginning of the Yugoslav Wars, in Croatia (1991), the Yugoslav People&#x27;s Army (JNA) carried out aerial bombing of Dubrovnik and Vukovar.

NATO&#x27;s aerial bombing of FR Yugoslavia in 1999 included targeted aerial bombing throughout Serbia, notably of targets in Belgrade, Novi Sad and Niš. In addition to military casualties, there were at least 500 civilian casualties. Despite the NATO campaign appearing to violate NATO&#x27;s charter, the UNSC rebutted the case on March 24 and March 26, 1999. In addition to purely military targets NATO targeted the national power grid (leaving many cities in the dark), water purification plants, oil refineries, fertilizer factories, and a petrochemical plant in Pancevo. The 78-day bombing campaign is assessed as having been an &#x27;economic catastrophe&#x27;, cutting the Yugoslav economy in half.

===Chechen wars===
Post-Soviet Russia heavily bombed the Chechen capital of Grozny from the air with mostly unguided munitions (including fuel-air explosives) as well as bombarding it with a massive artillery barrages (1994–1995, 1996 and 1999–2000), killing thousands of people (some estimates say 27,000 civilians were killed during the 1994–1995 siege alone) including civilians during the First and Second Chechen Wars. Although the Russian pilots and soldiers were ordered to attack designated targets only, such as the Presidential Palace, due to their inexperience and lack of training, Russian soldiers and pilots bombed and shelled random targets inside the city. In 2003, the UN still called Grozny the most destroyed city on earth.

===Iraq War===
In 2003 Invasion of Iraq, the U.S.-led coalition aircraft again bombed Iraq, including the Shock and Awe campaign of precision bombing of government targets in the city centers. From 2003 to 2011 and 2014 to 2018, coalition aircraft attacked Iraqi insurgent targets, including in urban locations like Najaf, Fallujah, Mosul, Basra, and Baghdad. There are frequent reports of civilian casualties, though it is often hard to distinguish guerrillas and civilians.

===Syria===
Syrian MiG-23s bombed the city of Aleppo on 24 July 2012, the first use of aerial bombing in the Syrian Civil War. Over the course of the war, the Syrian government has dropped tens of thousands of bombs, mostly unguided barrel bombs, on the cities of Aleppo, Damascus, Homs, Hama, Deir ez-Zor, Hasakah, Daraa, Darayya, and Al-Bab.

=== Ukraine ===
Russia has strategically bombed the Ukrainian civilian power grid, with low or null military purpose, in order to weaken Ukraine resistance or distract it from attacking and taking back Russian occupied territories. This is in addition to Russian bombing of civilian buildings such as apartment blocks, retail shops, offices, schools, hospitals, etc.

=== Gaza ===

During the Israel–Hamas war, Israeli airstrikes damaged or destroyed Palestinian refugee camps, schools, hospitals, mosques, churches, and other civilian infrastructure. By late April 2024 it was estimated that Israel had dropped over 70,000 tons of bombs over Gaza, surpassing the bombing of Dresden, Hamburg, and London combined during World War II.

===Other conflicts===
Budapest was attacked by intense Soviet air strikes in 1956 during the Hungarian Revolution. A year before, on 16 June 1955, Casa Rosada, the Argentine government seat at Buenos Aires, was the target of four waves of fighter-bombers during a military uprising to overthrow Juan Perón. Fourteen-tons of bombs scattered on a wide area, killing hundreds of civilian passers-by as well as 11 soldiers. In 2008, the cities of Tskhinvali and Gori were hit by the Georgian and Russian aircraft during the war in Georgia.

==International law==


Air warfare, theoretically, must comply with laws and customs of war, including international humanitarian law by protecting the victims of the conflict and refraining from attacks on protected persons.

These restraints on aerial warfare are covered by the general laws of war, because unlike war on land and at sea – which are specifically covered by rules such as the 1907 Hague Convention and Protocol I additional to the Geneva Conventions, which contain pertinent restrictions, prohibitions and guidelines – there are no treaties specific to aerial warfare.

To be legal, aerial operations must comply with the principles of humanitarian law: &quot;military necessity&quot;, &quot;distinction&quot;, and &quot;proportionality&quot;: An attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a legitimate military objective, and the harm caused to protected civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated.

<doc id="262714" wikidata="Q631794" url="?curid=262714" title="Explanatory gap">
<text>In the philosophy of mind, the explanatory gap is the difficulty that physicalist philosophies have in explaining how physical properties give rise to the way things feel subjectively when they are experienced. It is a term introduced by philosopher Joseph Levine. In the 1983 paper in which he first used the term, he used as an example the sentence, &quot;Pain is the firing of C fibers&quot;, pointing out that while it might be valid in a physiological sense, it does not help us to understand how pain feels.

The explanatory gap has vexed and intrigued philosophers and AI researchers alike for decades and caused considerable debate. Bridging this gap (that is, finding a satisfying mechanistic explanation for experience and qualia) is known as &quot;the hard problem&quot;. The hardness of the problem is such that mysterians believe it can never be solved by humans. Ned Block argues that there also exists a &quot;harder problem&quot; of consciousness, due to the possibility of different physical and functional neurological systems potentially having phenomenal overlap.

An example of a phenomenon in which there is no gap is a modern computer&#x27;s behavior, which can be adequately explained by its physical components alone, such as its circuitry and software. In contrast, it is thought by many mind-body dualists (e.g. René Descartes, David Chalmers) that &quot;subjective conscious experience&quot; constitutes a separate effect that demands another cause that is either outside the physical world (dualism) or due to an as yet unknown physical phenomenon (see for instance quantum mind, indirect realism).

Proponents of dualism claim that the mind is substantially and qualitatively different from the brain and that the existence of something metaphysically extra-physical is required to &quot;fill the gap&quot;. Similarly, some argue that there are further facts—facts that do not follow logically from the physical facts of the world—about conscious experience. For example, they argue that what it is like to experience seeing red does not follow logically from the physical facts of the world.

In addition to the qualities of subjective experiences, the existence of personal identity also poses potential problems for physicalist philosophies. The question of why an individual has their particular personal identity has been called the vertiginous question by philosopher Benj Hellie, and has been termed the &quot;Even Harder Problem of Consciousness&quot; by Tim S. Roberts. However, proponents of open individualism may argue that the existence of personal identity is illusory.

== Implications ==
The nature of the explanatory gap is disputed. Some consider it to be simply a limit on our current explanatory ability. They argue that future findings in neuroscience or future work from philosophers could close the gap. Others argue that the gap is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities as humans—no amount of further information will allow us to close it. There is no consensus about what metaphysical conclusions the existence of the gap provides. Those who use its existence to support dualism have often taken the position that an epistemic gap—particularly if it is a definite limit on our cognitive abilities—necessarily entails a metaphysical gap.

Joseph Levine and others opt to either remain silent on the matter or argue that no such metaphysical conclusion should be drawn. He agrees that conceivability (as used in the Zombie and inverted spectrum arguments) the theory is flawed as a means of establishing metaphysical realities; but argues that even if we come to the &quot;metaphysical&quot; conclusion that qualia are physical, they still present an &quot;explanatory&quot; problem.
While I think this materialist response is right in the end, it does not suffice to put the mind-body problem to rest. Even if conceivability considerations do not establish that the mind is in fact distinct from the body, or that mental properties are metaphysically irreducible to physical properties, still they do demonstrate that we lack an explanation of the mental in terms of the physical.

However, such an epistemological or explanatory problem might indicate an underlying metaphysical issue—the non-physicality of qualia, even if not proven by conceivability arguments, is far from ruled out.
In the end, we are right back where we started. The explanatory gap argument doesn&#x27;t demonstrate a gap in nature, but a gap in our understanding of nature. Of course, a plausible explanation for there being a gap in our understanding of nature is that there is a genuine gap in nature. But so long as we have countervailing reasons for doubting the latter, we have to look elsewhere for an explanation of the former.

At the core of the problem, according to Levine, is our lack of understanding of what it means for a qualitative experience to be fully comprehended. He emphasizes that we do not even know to what extent it is appropriate to inquire into the nature of this kind of experience. He uses the laws of gravity as an example, which laws seem to explain gravity completely yet do not account for the gravitational constant. Similarly to the way in which gravity appears to be an inexplicable brute fact of nature, the case of qualia may be one in which we are either lacking essential information or in which we are exploring a natural phenomenon that simply is not further apprehensible. Levine suggests that for this reason perhaps we should consider whether it is necessary to find a more complete explanation of qualitative experience.

Levine points out that understanding how much there is to be known about qualitative experience seems even more difficult because we lack a way to articulate what it means for actualities to be knowable in the manner that he has in mind. He concludes that there are good reasons to want a more complete explanation of qualitative experiences. One is that consciousness appears to manifest only where mentality is demonstrated in physical systems that are quite highly organized. Levine argues that it seems counterintuitive to accept this implication that the human brain, so highly organized as it is, could be no more than a routine executor. He notes that while materialism appears to entail reducibility of anything that is not physically primary to an explanation of its dependence on a mechanism that can be described in terms of physical fundamentals, that kind of reductionism does not attempt to reduce psychology to physical science. However, it still entails that there are inexplicable classes of facts which are not treated as relevant to statements pertinent to psychology.

Christian List believes that the existence of first-personal facts provide a refutation of not only physicalist theories of consciousness, but also most standard versions of dualism.

Many philosophers have doubted that the explanatory gap can be solved. As proponents of the argument use it to support arguments against materialism, physicalism, and naturalism, its arguments appear to resist any scientific or philosophical solution to the problem. David Chalmers acknowledged that even when science bridges the gap to some degree, the problem will persist.

== History ==

Leibniz&#x27;s passage describing the explanatory gap is as follows:
It must be confessed, moreover, that perception, and that which depends on it, are inexplicable by mechanical causes, that is, by figures and motions, And, supposing that there were a mechanism so constructed as to think, feel and have perception, we might enter it as into a mill. And this granted, we should only find on visiting it, pieces which push one against another, but never anything by which to explain a perception. This must be sought, therefore, in the simple substance, and not in the composite or in the machine.

<doc id="262723" wikidata="Q372532" url="?curid=262723" title="Cyanotype">
<text>The cyanotype (from , and , ) is a slow-reacting, photographic printing formulation sensitive to a limited near ultraviolet and blue light spectrum, the range 300 nm to 400 nm known as UVA radiation. It produces a monochrome, blue coloured print on a range of supports, often used for art, and for reprography in the form of blueprints. For any purpose, the process usually uses two chemicals: ferric ammonium citrate or ferric ammonium oxalate, and potassium ferricyanide, and only water to develop and fix. Announced in 1842, it is still in use.

== History ==

The cyanotype was discovered, and named thus, by Sir John Herschel who in 1842 published his investigation of light on iron compounds, expecting that photochemical reactions would reveal, in form visible to the human eye, the infrared extreme of the electromagnetic spectrum detected by his father William Herschel and the ultra-violet or &#x27;actinic&#x27; rays that had been discovered in 1801 by Johann Ritter. Though Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner had published in 1831 in German on the light-sensitivity of ferric oxalate, of which Herschel became aware during his visit to Hamburg, it is too lightly toned to form a satisfactory image and would require a second reaction to make a permanent print.

Alfred Smee had in 1840 used electrochemistry to isolate a pure form of potassium ferricyanide, which he sent to Herschel whose innovation was to use the ammonium iron(III) citrate or tartrate, then commercially available as an iron tonic and also introduced to him by Smee, for photographic purpose. He mixed the ammonium ferric citrate in a 20% aqueous solution, with 16% of the potassium ferricyanide, to make the sensitizer for coating plain paper. Exposed to sunlight, the ferric salt is reduced then combines with the ferricyanide to yield ferric ferrocyanide; Prussian blue (also known as Turnbull&#x27;s blue, or Berlin Blue in Germany). Intensifying and fixing is achieved simply by rinsing the print in water in which unexposed sensitizer and reaction products are readily soluble.

Anna Atkins, a friend of the Herschel family, over 1843–61 and with the assistance of Anne Dixon, hand-printed several albums of botanical and textile specimens, especially &quot;Photographs of British Algae: Cyanotype Impressions,&quot; effectively the world&#x27;s first photographically-illustrated books. After the Ross Antarctic Expedition (1839–1843) John Davis, artist and naturalist on the expedition, made or commissioned some cyanotypes in 1848 from seaweeds collected on the voyage. Also in the Antipodes, Herbert Dobbie in imitation of Atkins produced a book &quot;New Zealand ferns: 148 varieties,&quot; but with double-sided pages of cyanotype prints, in 1880.

John Mercer in the 1850s used the process for printing photographs onto cotton textiles and discovered means of toning the cyanotype violet, green, brown, red, or black.

As with all of his photographic inventions, Herschel did not patent his cyanotype process. Chemist George Thomas Fisher Jr. quickly disseminated information on the new medium internationally in his popular 1843 fifty-page manual &quot;Photogenic manipulation, containing plain instructions in the theory and practice of the arts of photography: calotype, cyanotype, ferrotype, chrysotype, anthotype, daguerreotype, and thermography,&quot; which the following year was translated into German and Dutch. The medium was immediately taken up and perfected by notable photographic practitioners of the time, including William Henry Fox Talbot and Henry Bosse. The latter in making fine presentation albums of bridges and structural steel, foresaw an appropriate effect in colour: the intense blues of his refined cyanotypes from large glass plates were printed on fine French paper 37 cm x 43.6 cm, watermarked &quot;Johannot et Cie. Annonay, aloe&#x27;s satin&quot; and leather bound.

Commercial use came only in 1872, the year after Herschel&#x27;s death. Marion and Company of Paris were first to market the cyanotype, under the proprietary name of &quot;Ferro-prussiate&quot;, for reprography of plans and technical drawings and to advantage due to its low cost and simplicity of processing which required only water. In this application and with the manufacture of blueprint papers, it remained the dominant reprographic process until the 1940s. During the 217-day Siege of Mafeking of the town of Mafeking (Mafikeng) in South Africa during the Second Boer War from October 1899, the process was used to print stamps and banknotes.

On the other hand the simple technology of the cyanotype remained accessible in the non-industrial realm and contributed to folk art; Francois Brunet notes the cyanotypes on cloth used by American home quilt-makers after 1880, and Geoffrey Batchen cites thirty or more early cyanotyped family snapshots on cloth, sewn into pillow slips or quilts, in the collection of Eastman House. Sandra Sider perpetuates this tradition in her own quilt making and as a proponent for increased museum acquisitions of Art Quilts.

The cyanotype produced negatives, reversing the darks and lights of the image or object exposed on it, but Herschel also contrived a version, though more complex, to produce positives which he hoped would aid in his ambition to achieve images of full natural colour. Its difficulties were overcome by Henri Pellet in 1877 in his gum arabic iron &quot;cyanofer&quot; direct positive photographic tracing method, which he commercialised.

== Process ==
=== Herschel&#x27;s formula and method ===
In a typical procedure, equal volumes of an 8.1% (w/v) solution of potassium ferricyanide and a 20% solution of ferric ammonium citrate are mixed. The overall contrast of the sensitizer solution can be increased with the addition of approximately 6 drops of 1% (w/v) solution potassium dichromate for every 2 ml of sensitizer solution.

This mildly photosensitive solution is then applied to a receptive surface (such as paper or cloth) and allowed to dry in a dark place. Cyanotypes can be printed on any support capable of soaking up the iron solution. Although watercolor paper is a preferred medium, cotton, wool and even gelatin sizing on nonporous surfaces have been used. Care should be taken to avoid alkaline-buffered papers, which degrade the image over time.

An image can be produced by exposing sensitised paper to a source of ultraviolet light (such as sunlight) as a contact print. The combination of UV light and the citrate reduces the iron(III) to iron(II). This is followed by a complex reaction of the iron(II) with ferricyanide. The result is an insoluble, blue pigment (ferric ferrocyanide) known as Prussian blue. The exposure time varies widely, from a few seconds in strong direct sunlight, to 10–20 minute exposures on a dull day.

After exposure, the paper is developed by washing in cold running water: the water-soluble iron(III) salts are washed away. The parts that were exposed to ultraviolet turn blue as the non-water-soluble Prussian blue pigment remains in the paper. This is what gives the print its typical blue color. The blue color darkens upon drying.

=== Improved formula ===
The ingredients have remained mostly unchanged since its inception in 1840. In 1994 Mike Ware improved on Herschel&#x27;s formula with ammonium iron(III) oxalate, also known as ferric ammonium oxalate, to replace the variable and unreliable ammonium ferric citrate. It has the advantages of being made up as a convenient single stock solution with a good shelf-life that does not nourish mould growth. The solution is well-absorbed by paper fibres, so it does not pool on the surface or result in a &#x27;tackiness&#x27; which may adhere to negatives. The paper better retains the pigment, with little of the Prussian blue image being lost in the washing stage, and exposure is shorter (ca. 4-8 times) than the traditional process. The cyanotype solution, even once its excess is washed off with water, remains photo-sensitive to some degree. A print that has been stored or displayed in bright light will eventually fade, the light causing a chemical reaction that changes the Prussian blue of the cyanotype to white. However, this process can be reversed by storing the cyanotypes in darkness. This will return them to their original vibrancy.

Different composition levels of ferric ammonium citrate (or oxalate) and potassium ferricyanide will result in a variety of effects in the final cyanotypes. Mixtures of half ferric ammonium citrate and half potassium ferricyanide will produce a medium, even shade of blue that is most commonly seen in a cyanotype. A mix of one third ferric ammonium citrate and two thirds potassium ferricyanide will produce a darker blue, and a more high-contrast final print.

Disadvantages of the Ware formula are a higher cost, more complicated preparation, and a level of toxicity.

=== Printmaking ===
The simplest kind of cyanotype print is a photogram, made by arranging objects on sensitised paper. Fresh or pressed plants are a typical subject but any opaque to translucent object will create an image. A sheet of glass will press flat objects into close contact with the paper, resulting in a sharp image. Otherwise, three-dimensional objects or less than perfectly flat ones will create a more or less blurred image depending on the incidence and breadth of the light source.

A variant of photograms are chemigrams. The cyanotype solution is applied, poured or sprayed irregularly. A variant of action painting results from repeated washing and application, placing objects on top.

More sophisticated prints can be made from artwork or photographic images on transparent or translucent media. The cyanotype process reverses light and dark, so a negative original is required to print as a positive image. Large format photographic negatives or transparent digital negatives can produce images with a full tonal range, or lithographic film can be used to create high-contrast images.

The cyanotype may be combination-printed with gumoil, or with a gum bichromate image, in which, for full-colour imaging from colour separations, it may form the blue layer; or it may be combined with a hand-painted or hand-drawn drawn layer.

=== Toning ===

In a cyanotype, blue is usually the desired color. However, a variety of alternative effects can be achieved. These fall into three categories: reducing, intensifying, and toning. It is common to bleach prints before toning them, but also possible to achieve different effects by toning prints without bleaching.
* Bleaching processes are ways of decreasing the intensity of the blue. Sodium carbonate, ammonia, borax, Dektol photographic developer and other chemicals can be used to do this. Household bleach is also effective, but tends to destroy the paper base. How much and how long to bleach depends on the image content, emulsion thickness and what kind of toning is being used. When using a bleaching agent it is important to control the bleaching process by washing in clean water as soon as the desired effect is achieved, to prevent loss of detail in the highlights.
* Intensifying processes will strengthen the blue effect. Chemicals used are hydrogen peroxide or mild acidic substances: citric acid, lemon juice, vinegar or acetic acid etc. These can also be used to speed up the oxidation process that creates the blue pigment.
* Toning processes are used to change the color of the iron oxide in the print. The color change varies with the reagent used. A variety of agents can be used, including various types of tea, coffee, wine, urine, tannic acid or pyrogallic acid, resulting in tones varying from brown to black. Most toning processes will to some extent tint the white parts of a print.

=== Long-term preservation ===
One of the most robust of Victorian print technologies, cyanotypes are quite stable on their own, but in contrast to most historical and present-day processes, the prints do not react well to basic environments. As a result, it is not advised to store or present the print in chemically buffered museum board, as this makes the image fade. Another unusual characteristic of the cyanotype is its regenerative behavior: prints that have faded due to prolonged exposure to light can often be significantly restored to their original tone by simply temporarily storing them in a dark environment.

Cyanotypes on cloth are permanent but must be washed by hand with non-phosphate soap so as to not turn the blue to yellow.

== Cyanotype in artistic practice ==

=== Artistic potential ===
The cyanotype&#x27;s success as a form of artistic expression lies in its capacity for manipulation or distortion. It produces distinctive effects and is versatile, enabling prints to be made on a wide variety of surfaces, including paper, wood, fabric, glass, Perspex, bone, shell and eggshell, plaster and ceramics, and at any scale; to date 2017, the largest is 276.64 m (2977.72 ft), created by Stefanos Tsakiris in Thessaloniki, Greece, on 18 September 2017. Robin Hill in 2001 exhibited &quot;Sweet Everyday&quot;, a 30.5 m (100 ft) cyanotype enwrapping Lennon, Weinberg, Inc.&#x27;s Soho gallery, and evoking wavy brushstrokes by placing ordinary shopping bags on photo-sensitive paper exposed to light. For photographic negatives or positives enlargement directly onto the emulsion is not feasible due to the low sensitivity of the emulsion (except with a solar enlarger), so requires contact printing at 1:1 ratio. The low sensitivity permits progress to be inspected in a printing frame during exposure. Consequently and because of its long exposure scale it suits most negatives whether of high or low contrast. As a recognisably 19th century technology, artists like John Dugdale use it to evoke, or to critique, Victorian aesthetics and social constructs.

The artist is not restricted to the reproduction of existing photographic negatives. Prints can be made of three-dimensional objects, utilising the ability of the objects to be placed on top of the photosensitive material. Once exposed to light, the final print is of an outline of an item with internal detail where they allow light, depending on their relative transparency and exposure, to filter through; Anna Atkins&#x27; botanical cyanotypes sharply register the more transparent segments of a petal or leaf. An object original, used to make a cyanotype photogram, including the human figure for example, is reproduced at actual size. Robert Rauschenberg&#x27;s and Susan Weil&#x27;s collaborative cyanotypes, including &quot;Untitled (Double Rauschenberg)&quot;, were made by both artists lying down, hands held, on a large piece of photosensitive paper (treated with cyanotype chemicals). The resulting prints of their bodies in various poses are currently part of the Museum of Modern Art&#x27;s permanent collection. In France, from the end of the 1970s, Nancy Wilson-Pajic made cyanotype photograms of everything from a broken windshield to herself (Falling Angels), and eventually several long series of museum collections and of Haute-Couture robes by Christian Lacroix and other designers. The results have been shown all over the world and are in major institutions and public collections.

The blue hue naturally associates symbolically with sea or sky. As German photographer Thomas Kellner notes of his 1997 Cubist multi-pinhole portraits of porcelain dolls; &quot;I am specially happy with the blue colour in this series as the blue has a different depth in the background than a black print. Blue is still infinite, whereas black usually has the character of ending.&quot; The negative form may be disorienting or surreal; while white is often used to frame or highlight a central subject in many artistic media, the opposite may be true in the cyanotype, requiring the artist to adapt their ideas to the effect.

Equally important is the expressive potential of the application of emulsion using brush, squeegee, roller or cloth, or by stamping, for calligraphic effect.

The cyanotype process is quite flexible, and it can be scaled up to incredible sizes. For example, in 2017, Stefanos Tsakiris created a 276.64 square meter cyanotype in Thessaloniki, Greece. The print, which holds the world record for the largest cyanotype print, was made to help teach people about cyanotype photography and increase environmental awareness.

== Artists ==

=== Nineteenth century ===
==== Britain ====
Anna Atkins, who was also an accomplished watercolorist, in her cyanotype botanical specimens, is considered the first to make art with the medium in which the sea plants appear suspended in an oceanic blue, and while her hundreds of images satisfy a scientific curiosity, their aesthetic quality has served as inspiration for cyanotype artists ever since.

Cyanotype photography was popular in Victorian England, but became less popular as photography improved. By the mid-1800s few photographers continued to exploit its accessible qualities and at the Great Exhibition of 1851, despite extensive displays of photographic technology, only a single example of the cyanotype process was included. Peter Henry Emerson exemplified the British attitude that cyanotypes were unworthy of purchase or exhibition with his assertion that: &quot;No one but a vandal would print a landscape in red, or in cyanotype.&quot;

Consequently, the process devolved to the proofing of domestic negatives by hobbyist photographers and to postcards, though another British scientist, Fellow of the Royal Astronomical Society Washington Teasdale, delivered hundreds of lectures throughout his lifetime and was among the first to illustrate them with lantern slides, and, up to 1890, to record his experiments and specimens, used the cyanotype, a collection of which is held at the Museum of the History of Science, Oxford.

Edwin Linley Sambourne used cyanotypes as an archive of reference images for his &quot;Punch&quot; cartoons.

==== France ====
Curators and practitioners in France embraced the process. Caricaturist, illustrator, writer and portrait photographer Bertall (born Charles Albert, vicomte d&#x27; Arnoux, comte de Limoges-Saint-Saëns) as partner of Hippolyte Bayard was commissioned in the 1860s to make cyanotype portraits from glass negatives for the Société d&#x27;Ethnographie for their publication &quot;Collection anthropologique&quot;. While artistic in execution they also satisfy with the scientific interests of the group as each subject is photographed nude with front, back and profile views, not in the field but in his studio. The project also takes advantage of the ease of making multiples of cyanotypes for the publication Henri Le Secq&#x27;s cyanotypes, which he made after he gave up photography after 1856 to continue painting and collecting art, were reprints of his famous works and made around 1870 as he was afraid of possible loss due to fading. He gave the reprints dates of the original negatives, some of which are still in good condition. They are well-represented in French collections. From the early 1850s through the 1870s Corot, with associated artists working in and near the town Barbizon adopted the hand-drawn &quot;cliché-verre&quot;, and though most were printed on salted or albumenized paper, some used the cyanotype.

==== United States ====
In the US the medium persevered into the 20th century. Eadweard Muybridge made cyanotype contact prints of his animal locomotion sequences, and Edward Curtis&#x27; ethnographic cyanotypes of native North Americans are preserved in the George Eastman House.

=== Pictorialism ===
Pictorialists, throughout Europe and other western countries, in efforts to have photography accepted as an art form, emphasised handcraft in printing, in imitation of painting and drawing, and drew on Symbolist subject matter and themes. Many of the practitioners were respected amateurs whose work was rewarded in a system of international &#x27;salons&#x27; run by such organisations as the Camera Club of New York, and competition promoted an elevated level of technical experimentation with all of the then-current processes, such as calotypy, cyanotypy, gum printing, platinum printing, bromoil and Autochrome colour.

Clarence White&#x27;s impeccable domestic and plein-air pictures are indebted in their bold composition to his contemporaries the painters Thomas Wilmer Dewing, William Merritt Chase and John White Alexander. His labor-intensive process entailed developing the negatives then making tests on cyanotype, playing with dimensions, proportions, and other variables, before making a print in platinum, which he then meticulously and expressively retouched. Alfred Steiglitz in White&#x27;s portrait of him (1907) held in Princeton University Art Museum, appears gloweringly critical in the cyanotype print preserved there.

At the turn of the century, painter-photographer Edward Steichen, then associated with Alfred Steiglitz who promoted the Photo-Secession and Pictorialism through his &quot;Camera Work&quot; (1903–1917) produced prints of &quot;Midnight Lake George&quot; now held in &quot;The Alfred Stieglitz Collection: Photographs&quot; at the Art Institute of Chicago where in 2007 scientific examination of the prints and his records concluded that cyanotype had been incorporated in their predominant gum bichromate over platinum production. Steichen argued provocatively in the first issue of &quot;Camera Work&quot; that &quot;every photograph is a fake from start to finish, a purely impersonal, unmanipulated photograph being practically impossible.&quot;

Photo-Secessionist Franco-American Paul Burty-Havilland, involved through marriage with the Lalique company, evinces a Japonisme in his moody cyanotype portraits and nudes made between 1898–1920. Another American Pictorialist Fred Holland Day made cyanotypes of youths, nude or in sailor suits, in 1911, that are held in the Library of Congress, and French artist Charles-François Jeandel printed his erotic imagery of bound women in his painting workshop in Paris and then in Charente 1890–1900.

The more traditional American printmaker Bertha Jaques, aligned with the antimodernist views of the late Victorian Arts and Crafts movement, from 1894 produced more than a thousand cyanotype photographs of wildflowers.

=== Impressionism ===
American artist Theodore Robinson painted in Giverny 1887–1892, contemporaneous with Monet of whom he made a portrait in cyanotype, and of the haystacks that Monet famously painted. He noted that &quot;Painting directly from nature is difficult as things do not remain the same; the camera helps to retain the picture in your mind.&quot; He often drew a grid over his cyanotypes or albumen prints to assist transferring the composition, with compositional amendments, onto canvas, though conscious that &quot;I must beware of the photo, get what I can of it and then go.&quot; His photographic imagery is held in the Canajoharie Library and Art Gallery and the Terra Foundation for the Arts.

=== Modernism ===
Arthur Wesley Dow&#x27;s modernist approach was influential on the Pictorialists in the eloquently simple compositions of his New England environment, like &quot;Pine Tree&quot; (1895), a cyanotype, related to his interest, while studying in France, in the flat, decorative qualities of Japanese art and that of Les Nabis.

In Europe, Josef Sudek, the &#x27;Poet of Prague&#x27; sometimes employed the cyanotype to impressionist effect during the early Modernist period.

Milan-born photographer, printmaker, painter, set designer and experimental film-maker, Luigi Veronesi, well-informed about the international debate on abstraction, was impressed with the abstract potential of the photogram. He participated in a 1934 exhibition in Paris with the international group of abstract artists &#x27;Abstraction-Création&#x27;, through which he met with Fernand Léger. He drew inspiration from Léger&#x27;s &quot;Ballet Mécanique&quot;, Surrealism via the Metaphysical painting of Georgio de Chirico, and fellow photographer Giuseppe Cavalli with whom, convinced of the essential &#x27;uselessness&#x27; of art, in 1947 he founded a group named &quot;La Bussola&quot; (The Compass). Influenced by Constructivist theories (and politically aligned with Communism), Veronesi used the cyanotype photogram after 1932 as a means of revealing metaphysical qualities in objects.

=== Late modern ===

In a 2008 essay A.D. Coleman perceived a return of the legacy Pictorialist methods being applied in art photography from 1976, a tendency represented in Francesca Woodman&#x27;s late cyanotypes and in contact prints by Barbara Kasten and Bea Nettles. Weston Naef, curator of photography at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, in a 1998 &quot;New York Times&quot; article by critic Lyle Rexer, confirmed that &quot;Looking back at [photography&#x27;s] pioneers, today&#x27;s artists see a way to restore expression to an art beguiled by technology,&quot; referring to the loss of &#x27;intimacy&#x27; in digital imaging to account for artists&#x27; attraction to daguerreotypes, tintypes, cyanotypes, stereopticon images, albumen prints, collodion wet plates; all physical and &#x27;hands-on&#x27; methods. Artists David McDermott and Peter McGough, who met in the East Village New York art scene of the 1980s, and until 1995 took the phenomenon to the extreme of reconstructing themselves as Victorian gentlemen, adopting the lifestyle and documenting it and their possessions using vintage cameras and materials, first inspired by their discovery of the cyanotype, and dating their contemporary works in the nineteenth century.

=== Contemporary ===

Since 2000 around 10 books, and in growing numbers, are published each year in English in which &#x27;cyanotype&#x27; appears in the title, compared to only 95 in total from 1843 to 1999. Though it has been an artform since its inception, the numbers of artists now employing the cyanotype process have burgeoned, and they are not solely photographers. In the book of the 2022 British exhibition &quot;Squaring the Circles of Confusion: Neo-Pictorialism in the 21st Century&quot; eight contemporary artists: Takashi Arai, Céline Bodin, Susan Derges, David George, Joy Gregory, Tom Hunter, Ian Phillips-McLaren and Spencer Rowell employ the craft of photography for postmodern purpose, including the cyanotype.

==== International ====
Many were included in the first American international survey of the cyanotype in 2016; the Worcester Art Museum&#x27;s &quot;Cyanotypes: Photography&#x27;s Blue Period&quot; which displayed uses of the medium that extend well beyond the utilitarian contact-printing of negatives; Annie Lopez stitched together cyanotypes printed on tamale paper to create dresses; Brooke Williams tea-toned her cyanotypes, adjusting their color to accord with her story as a Jamaican American woman; and Hugh Scott-Douglas experimented with photograms and abstraction.

In 2018, the New York Public Library exhibited the work of nineteen contemporary artists who employ the medium. Mounted 175 years after Anna Atkin&#x27;s first book of cyanotypes, &quot;British Algae&quot;, the exhibition was titled &quot;Anna Atkins Refracted: Contemporary Works&quot;.

Amongst others currently working in, or with, cyanotype are;

==== United States ====
Christian Marclay who suggests musical scores in his grids of cassette tapes or their unspooling.

Kate Cordsen applies Japanese aesthetics and non-Cartesian perspective in her mural-scale cyanotype landscapes.

Betty Hahn was early to incorporate cyanotype with other art media including hand-painting with embroidery as a feminist statement

Meghann Riepenhoff reprises Anna Atkins by exposing her prepared papers underneath the waves, so light filters through moving sand, shells, and water currents.

==== Canada ====
Canadian Erin Shirreff translates her sculptural interests into large-scale cyanotype photograms of temporary three-dimensional compositions in her studio with hours-long exposures during which component forms are moved, added or subtracted for transparent effect.

==== Germany ====
German artist Marco Breuer abrades cyanotype prints on watercolour paper in representations of the passing of time.

==== Iceland ====
Icelandic artist and filmmaker Inga Lísa Middleton employs the cyanotype for nostalgic representations of her homeland, and as a symbolic colour in imagery alerting audiences to an emerging catastrophe in the marine environment.

==== United Kingdom ====
British-born American resident Walead Beshty&#x27;s Barbican Art Gallery installation of 12,000 cyanotype prints traces a visual time line from October 2013 to September 2014 in a work called &quot;A Partial Disassembling of an Invention Without a Future: Helter-Skelter and Random Notes in Which the Pulleys and Cogwheels Are Lying Around at Random All Over the Workbench,&quot; produced from each object from the artists&#x27; studio being exposed on cyanotype-coated found paper, card or wood.

<text>Dynamic range compression (DRC) or simply compression is an audio signal processing operation that reduces the volume of loud sounds or amplifies quiet sounds, thus reducing or &quot;compressing&quot; an audio signal&#x27;s dynamic range. Compression is commonly used in sound recording and reproduction, broadcasting, live sound reinforcement and some instrument amplifiers.

A dedicated electronic hardware unit or audio software that applies compression is called a compressor. In the 2000s, compressors became available as software plugins that run in digital audio workstation software. In recorded and live music, compression parameters may be adjusted to change the way they affect sounds. Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A limiter is a compressor with a high ratio and, generally, a short attack time.

Compression is used to improve performance and clarity in public address systems, as an effect and to improve consistency in mixing and mastering. It is used on voice to reduce sibilance and in broadcasting and advertising to make an audio program stand out. It is an integral technology in some noise reduction systems.

== Types ==

There are two types of compression: downward and upward. Both types of compression reduce the dynamic range of an audio signal.

&quot;Downward&quot; compression reduces the volume of loud sounds &quot;above&quot; a certain threshold. The quiet sounds &quot;below&quot; the threshold remain unaffected. This is the most common type of compressor. A limiter can be thought of as an extreme form of downward compression as it compresses the sounds over the threshold especially hard. 

&quot;Upward&quot; compression increases the volume of quiet sounds &quot;below&quot; a certain threshold. The louder sounds &quot;above&quot; the threshold remain unaffected. 

Some compressors also have the ability to do the &quot;opposite&quot; of compression, namely &quot;expansion&quot;. Expansion &quot;increases&quot; the dynamic range of the audio signal. Like compression, expansion comes in two types, downward and upward. 

&quot;Downward&quot; expansion makes the quiet sounds below the threshold even quieter. A noise gate can be thought of as an extreme form of downward expansion as the noise gate make the quiet sounds (for instance: noise) quieter or even silent, depending on the floor setting.

&quot;Upward&quot; expansion makes the louder sounds above the threshold even louder.
== Design ==
The signal entering a compressor is split; one copy is sent to a variable-gain amplifier and the other to a &quot;side-chain&quot; where the signal level is measured and a circuit controlled by the measured signal level applies the required gain to the amplifier. This design, known as a &quot;feed-forward&quot; type, is used today in most compressors. Earlier designs were based on a &quot;feedback&quot; layout where the signal level was measured after the amplifier.

There are a number of technologies used for variable-gain amplification, each having different advantages and disadvantages. Vacuum tubes are used in a configuration called &quot;variable-mu&quot; where the grid-to-cathode voltage changes to alter the gain. Optical compressors use a photoresistor stimulated by a small lamp (incandescent, LED, or electroluminescent panel) to create changes in signal gain. Other technologies used include field effect transistors and a diode bridge.

When working with digital audio, digital signal processing (DSP) techniques are commonly used to implement compression as audio plug-ins, in mixing consoles, and in digital audio workstations. Often the algorithms are used to emulate the above analog technologies.

== Controls and features ==

A number of user-adjustable control parameters and features are used to adjust dynamic range compression signal processing algorithms and components.

=== Threshold ===
A compressor reduces the level of an audio signal if its amplitude exceeds a certain &quot;threshold&quot;. Threshold is commonly set in decibels (dBFS for digital compressors and dBu for hardware compressors), where a lower threshold (e.g.−60 dB) means a larger portion of the signal is treated. When the signal level is below the threshold, no processing is performed and the input signal is passed, unmodified, to the output. Thus a higher threshold of, e.g.,−5 dB, results in less processing, less compression.

Threshold timing behavior is subject to attack and release settings (see below). When the signal level goes above threshold, compressor operation is delayed by the &quot;attack&quot; setting. For an amount of time determined by the &quot;release&quot; after the input signal has fallen below the threshold, the compressor continues to apply dynamic range compression.

=== Ratio ===
The amount of gain reduction is determined by ratio: a ratio of 4:1 means that if input level is 4 dB over the threshold, the output signal level is reduced to 1 dB over the threshold. The gain and output level has been reduced by 3 dB. Another way of stating this is that any input signal level over the threshold will, in this case, be output at a level which is only 25% as much over the threshold as its input level was.

The highest ratio of formula_1:1 is often known as &quot;limiting&quot;, and effectively denotes that any signal above the threshold is brought down to the threshold level once the &quot;attack&quot; time has expired.

=== Attack and release ===

A compressor may provide a degree of control over how quickly it acts. The &quot;attack&quot; is the period when the compressor is decreasing gain in response to the increased level at the input to reach the gain determined by the ratio. The &quot;release&quot; is the period when the compressor is increasing gain in response to reduced level at the input to reach the output gain determined by the ratio, or, to unity, once the input level has fallen below the threshold. Because the loudness pattern of the source material is modified by the time-varying operation of compressor, it may change the character of the signal in subtle to quite noticeable ways depending on the attack and release settings used.

The length of each period is determined by the rate of change and the required change in gain. For more intuitive operation, a compressor&#x27;s attack and release controls are labeled as a unit of time (often milliseconds). This is the amount of time it takes for the gain to change a set amount of dB or a set percentage towards the target gain. There is no industry standard for the exact meaning of these time parameters.

In many compressors, the attack and release times are adjustable by the user. Some compressors, however, have the attack and release times determined by the circuit design and cannot be adjusted. Sometimes the attack and release times are &quot;automatic&quot; or &quot;program dependent&quot;, meaning that the behavior may change depending on the input signal.

=== Soft and hard knees ===

Another control a compressor might offer is hard knee or soft knee selection. This controls whether the bend in the response curve between below threshold and above threshold is abrupt (hard) or gradual (soft). A soft knee slowly increases the compression ratio as the level increases and eventually reaches the compression ratio set by the user. A soft knee reduces the potentially audible transition from uncompressed to compressed, and is especially applicable for higher ratio settings where the changeover at the threshold would be more noticeable.

=== Peak vs RMS sensing ===
A peak-sensing compressor responds to the peak level of the input signal. While providing tighter peak level control, peak level sensing does not necessarily relate to human perception of loudness. Some compressors apply a power measurement function (commonly root mean square or RMS) on the input signal before comparing its level to the threshold. This produces a more relaxed compression that more closely relates to human perception of loudness.

=== Stereo linking ===
A compressor in &quot;stereo linking&quot; mode applies the same amount of gain reduction to both the left and right channels. This is done to prevent image shifting that can occur if each channel is compressed individually.

=== Make-up gain ===
Because a downward compressor only reduces the level of the signal, the ability to add a fixed amount of &quot;make-up gain&quot; at the output is usually provided so that an optimum output level is produced.

=== Look-ahead ===
The look-ahead function is designed to overcome the problem of being forced to compromise between slow attack rates that produce smooth-sounding gain changes, and fast attack rates capable of catching transients. Look-ahead is implemented by splitting the input signal and delaying one side (the audio signal) by the look-ahead time. The non-delayed side (the gain control signal) is used to drive the compression of the delayed signal, which then appears at the output. This way a smooth-sounding slower attack rate can be used to catch transients. The cost of this solution is added audio latency through the processor.

== Uses ==

=== Public spaces ===
Compression is often applied in audio systems for restaurants, retail, and similar public environments that play background music at a relatively low volume and need it compressed, not just to keep the volume fairly constant, but also to make quiet parts of the music audible over ambient noise.

Compression can increase average output gain of a power amplifier by 50 to 100% with a reduced dynamic range. For paging and evacuation systems, this adds clarity under noisy circumstances and saves on the number of amplifiers required.

=== Music production ===

Compression is often used in music production to make instruments more consistent in dynamic range, so that they &quot;sit&quot; more nicely in the mix with the other instruments (neither disappear during short periods of time, nor overpower the other instruments during short periods). Vocal performances in rock music or pop music are compressed for the same reason. 

Compression can also be used on instrument sounds to create effects not primarily focused on stabilizing the volume. For instance, drum and cymbal sounds tend to decay quickly, but a compressor can make the sound appear to have a more sustained tail. Guitar sounds are often compressed to produce a fuller, more sustained sound.

Most devices capable of compressing audio dynamics can also be used to reduce the volume of one audio source when another audio source reaches a certain level; this is called side-chaining. In electronic dance music, side-chaining is often used on basslines, controlled by the kick drum or a similar percussive trigger, to prevent the two from conflicting, and provide a pulsating, rhythmic dynamic to the sound.

=== Voice ===
A compressor can be used to reduce sibilance (&#x27;ess&#x27; sounds) in vocals (de-essing) by feeding the compressor&#x27;s side-chain an equalized version of the input signal, so that specific, sibilance-related frequencies (typically 4000 to 8000 hz) activate the compressor more.

Compression is used in voice communications in amateur radio that employ single-sideband (SSB) modulation to make a particular station&#x27;s signal more readable to a distant station, or to make one&#x27;s station&#x27;s transmitted signal stand out against others. This is applicable especially in DXing. An SSB signal&#x27;s strength depends on the level of modulation. A compressor increases the average level of the modulation signal thus increasing the transmitted signal strength. Most modern amateur radio SSB transceivers have speech compressors built-in. Compression is also used in land mobile radio, especially in transmitted audio of professional walkie-talkies and remote control dispatch consoles.

=== Broadcasting ===
Compression is used extensively in broadcasting to boost the perceived volume of sound while reducing the dynamic range of source audio. To avoid overmodulation, broadcasters in most countries have legal limits on instantaneous peak volume they may broadcast. Normally these limits are met by permanently inserted compression hardware in the on-air chain.

Broadcasters use compressors in order that their station sounds louder than comparable stations. The effect is to make the more heavily compressed station jump out at the listener at a given volume setting. This is not limited to inter-channel differences; they also exist between programme material within the same channel. Loudness differences are a frequent source of audience complaints, especially TV commercials and promos that seem too loud.

The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) has been addressing this issue in the EBU PLOUD group, which consists of over 240 audio professionals, many from broadcasters and equipment manufacturers. In 2010, the EBU published EBU R 128 which introduces a new way of metering and normalizing audio. The Recommendation uses ITU-R BS.1770 loudness metering. , several European TV stations have announced their support for the new norm and over 20 manufacturers have announced products supporting the new &quot;EBU Mode&quot; loudness meters.

To help audio engineers understand what loudness range their material consists of (e.g. to check if some compression may be needed to fit it into the channel of a specific delivery platform), the EBU also introduced the &quot;Loudness Range&quot; (LRA) descriptor.

=== Marketing ===
Most television commercials are heavily compressed to achieve near-maximum perceived loudness while staying within permissible limits. This causes a problem that TV viewers often notice: when a station switches from minimally compressed program material to a heavily compressed commercial, the volume sometimes seems to increase dramatically. Peak loudness might be the same—meeting the letter of the law—but high compression puts much more of the audio in the commercial at close to the maximum allowable, making the commercial seem much louder.

=== Over-usage ===

Record companies, mixing engineers and mastering engineers have been gradually increasing the overall loudness of commercial albums. This is achieved by using higher degrees of compression and limiting during mixing and mastering; compression algorithms have been engineered specifically to accomplish the task of maximizing audio level in the digital stream. Hard limiting or clipping can result, affecting the tone and timbre of the music. The effort to increase loudness has been referred to as the loudness war.

=== Other uses ===
Noise reduction systems use a compressor to reduce the dynamic range of a signal for transmission or recording, expanding it afterward, a process called companding. This reduces the effects of a channel or recording medium with limited dynamic range.

Instrument amplifiers often include compression circuitry to prevent sudden high-wattage peaks that could damage the speakers. Electric bass players often use compression effects, either effects units available in pedal, rackmount units, or built-in devices in bass amps, to even out the sound levels of their basslines.

Gain pumping, where a regular amplitude peak (such as a kick drum) causes the rest of the mix to change in volume due to the compressor, is generally avoided in music production. However, many dance and hip-hop musicians purposefully use this phenomenon, causing the mix to alter in volume rhythmically in time with the beat.

Hearing aids use a compressor to bring the audio volume into the listener&#x27;s hearing range. To help the patient perceive the direction sound comes from, some hearing aids use binaural compression.

Compressors are also used for hearing protection in some electronic active hearing protection earmuffs and earplugs, to let sounds at ordinary volumes be heard normally while attenuating louder sounds, possibly also amplifying softer sounds. This allows, for example, shooters wearing hearing protection at a shooting range to converse normally, while sharply attenuating the much louder sounds of the gunshots, and similarly for musicians to hear quiet music but be protected from loud noises such as drums or cymbal crashes.

In applications of machine learning where an algorithm is training on audio samples, dynamic range compression is a way to augment samples for a larger data set.

== Limiting ==
Compression and limiting are identical in process but different in degree and perceived effect. A limiter is a compressor with a high ratio and, generally, a fast attack time. Compression with ratio of 10:1 or more is generally considered limiting.

&quot;Brick wall limiting&quot; has a very high ratio and a very fast attack time. Ideally, this ensures that an audio signal never exceeds the amplitude of the threshold. Ratios of 20:1 all the way up to ∞:1 are considered &quot;brick wall&quot;. The sonic results of more than momentary and infrequent brick-wall limiting are harsh and unpleasant, thus it is more common as a safety device in live sound and broadcast applications.

Some bass amps and PA system amplifiers include limiters to prevent sudden volume peaks from causing distortion or damaging the speakers.

== Side-chaining ==

A compressor with a side-chain input controls gain from main input to output based on the level of the signal at the side-chain input. An early innovator of side-chain compression in an effects unit was the Eventide Omnipressor from 1974. With side-chaining, the compressor behaves in the conventional manner when both main and side-chain inputs are supplied with the same signal.

The side-chain input is used by disc jockeys for ducking – lowering the music volume automatically when speaking. The DJ&#x27;s microphone signal is routed to the side-chain input so that whenever the DJ speaks the compressor reduces the volume of the music.

A sidechain with equalization controls can be used to reduce the volume of signals that have a strong spectral content within a certain frequency range: it can act as a de-esser, reducing the level of vocal sibilance in the range of 6–9 kHz. Another use of the side-chain in music production serves to maintain a loud bass track without the bass drum causing undue peaks that result in loss of overall headroom.

==Parallel compression==

Inserting the compressor in a parallel signal path is known as parallel compression. It is a form of upward compression that facilitates dynamic control without significant audible side effects so long as the ratio is relatively low and the compressor&#x27;s sound is relatively neutral. On the other hand, a high compression ratio with significant audible artifacts can be chosen in one of the two parallel signal paths. This is used by some concert mixers and recording engineers as an artistic effect called &quot;New York compression&quot; or &quot;Motown compression&quot;. Combining a linear signal with a compressor and then reducing the output gain of the compression chain results in low-level detail enhancement without any peak reduction; The compressor significantly adds to the combined gain at low levels only.

== Multiband compression == 

Multiband compressors can act differently on different frequency bands. The advantage of multiband compression over full-bandwidth compression is that problems related to a specific frequency range can be fixed without unnecessary compression in the other, unrelated frequencies. The downside is that frequency-specific compression is more complex and requires more processing capacity than full-bandwidth compression and can introduce phase issues.

Multiband compressors work by first splitting the signal through some number of band-pass filters, crossover filters or filter banks. Each split signal then passes through its own compressor and is independently adjustable for threshold, ratio, attack, and release. The signals are then recombined and an additional limiting circuit may be employed to ensure that the combined signals do not create unwanted peak levels.

In music production, multiband compressors are primarily an audio mastering tool, but their inclusion in digital audio workstation plug-in sets is increasing their use among mix engineers. 
The TC Electronic Finalizer included a three band compressor and was a popular audio mastering tool around year 2000. 

On-air signal chains of radio stations commonly use multiband compressors to increase loudness while avoiding overmodulation. Having a louder sound is often considered an advantage in commercial broadcasting.

==Serial compression==

Serial compression is a technique used in sound recording and mixing. Serial compression is achieved by using two fairly different compressors in a signal chain. One compressor generally stabilizes the dynamic range while the other aggressively compresses stronger peaks. This is the normal internal signal routing in common combination devices marketed as &quot;compressor-limiters&quot;, where an RMS compressor (for general gain control) is followed by a fast peak-sensing limiter (for overload protection). Done properly, even heavy serial compression can sound natural in a way not possible with a single compressor. It is most often used to even out erratic vocals and guitars.

== Software audio players ==

Some software audio players support plugins that implement compression. These can increase loudness of audio tracks, or level out the volume of highly-variable music (such as classical music, or a playlist that spans multiple music types). This improves the listenability of audio played through poor-quality speakers, or when played in noisy environments (such as in a car or during a party).

== Objective influence on the signal ==

In an article published in January 2014 by the &quot;Journal of the Audio Engineering Society&quot;, Emmanuel Deruty and Damien Tardieu performed a systematic study describing the influence of compressors and brickwall limiters on the musical audio signal. The experiment involved four software limiters: Waves L2, Sonnox Oxford Limiter, Thomas Mundt&#x27;s Loudmax, Blue Cat&#x27;s Protector, as well as four software compressors: Waves H-Comp, Sonnox Oxford Dynamics, Sonalksis SV-3157, and URS 1970. The study provides objective data on what limiters and compressors do to the audio signal.

Five signal descriptors were considered: RMS power, EBU R 128 integrated loudness, crest factor, R 128 LRA, and density of clipped samples. RMS power accounts for the signal&#x27;s physical level, R 128 loudness for the perceived level. The crest factor, which is the difference between the signal&#x27;s peak and its average power, is on occasions considered as a basis for the measure of micro-dynamics, for instance in the &quot;TT Dynamic Range Meter&quot; plug-in. Finally, R 128 LRA has been repeatedly considered as a measure of macro-dynamics or dynamics in the musical sense.

=== Limiters ===

The tested limiters had the following influence on the signal:
* increase of RMS power,
* increase of EBU R 128 loudness,
* decrease of crest factor,
* decrease of EBU R 128 LRA, but only for high amounts of limiting,
* increase of clipped sample density.

In other words, limiters increase both physical and perceptual levels, increase the density of clipped samples, decrease the crest factor and decrease macro-dynamics (LRA) given that the amount of limiting is substantial.

=== Compressors ===

As far as the compressors are concerned, the authors performed two processing sessions, using a fast attack (0.5 ms) in one case, and a slow attack (50 ms) in the other. Make-up gain is deactivated, but the resulting file is normalized.

Set with a fast attack, the tested compressors had the following influence on the signal:
* slight increase of RMS power,
* slight increase of EBU R 128 loudness,
* decrease of crest factor,
* decrease of EBU R 128 LRA,
* slight decrease of clipped sample density.

In other words, fast-attack compressors increase both physical and perceptual levels, but only slightly. They decrease the density of clipped samples, and decrease both crest factor and macro-dynamics.

Set with a slow attack, the tested compressors had the following influence on the signal:
* decrease of RMS power,
* decrease of EBU R 128 loudness,
* no influence on crest factor,
* decrease of EBU R 128 LRA,
* no influence on clipped sample density.

In other words, slow-attack compressors decrease both physical and perceptual levels, decrease macro-dynamics, but have no influence on crest factor and clipped sample density.

<text>The hoatzin ( ) or hoactzin ( ) (Opisthocomus hoazin) is a species of tropical bird found in swamps, riparian forests, and mangroves of the Amazon and the Orinoco basins in South America. It is the only extant species in the genus Opisthocomus which is the only extant genus in the Opisthocomidae family under the order of Opisthocomiformes. Despite being the subject of intense debate by specialists, the taxonomic position of this family is still far from clear.

The hoatzin is notable for its chicks having primitive claws on two of their wing digits; the species also is unique in possessing a digestive system capable of fermentation and the effective breaking-down of plant matter, a trait more commonly known from herbivorous ungulate-ruminant mammals and some primates. This bird is also the national bird of Guyana, where the local name for this bird is Canje pheasant.

== Description ==
The hoatzin is pheasant-sized, with a total length of , and a long neck and small head. It has an unfeathered blue face with maroon eyes, and its head is topped by a spiky, rufous crest. The long, sooty-brown tail is bronze-green tipped with a broad whitish or buff band at the end. The upper parts are dark, sooty brown-edged buff on the wing coverts, and streaked buff on the mantle and nape. The underparts are buff, while the crissum (the undertail coverts surrounding the cloaca), primaries, underwing coverts, and flanks are rich rufous-chestnut, but this is mainly visible when the hoatzin opens its wings.

It is a noisy bird, and makes a variety of hoarse calls, including groans, croaks, hisses, and grunts. These calls are often associated with body movements, such as wing spreading.

=== Young wing claws ===
Hoatzin chicks have two claws on each wing. Immediately after hatching, they can use these claws, and their oversized feet, to scramble around the tree branches without falling into the water. When predators such as the great black hawk attack a hoatzin nesting colony, the adults fly noisily about, trying to divert the predator&#x27;s attention, while the chicks move away from the nest and hide among the thickets. If discovered, however, they drop into the water and swim under the surface to escape, then later use their clawed wings to climb back to the safety of the nest. This has inevitably led to comparisons to the fossil bird &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot;, but the characteristic is rather an autapomorphy, possibly caused by an atavism toward the dinosaurian finger claws, whose developmental genetics (&quot;blueprint&quot;) presumably is still in the avian genome. Since &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; had three functional claws on each wing, some earlier systematists speculated that the hoatzin was descended from it, because nestling hoatzins have two functional claws on each wing. Modern researchers, however, hypothesize that the young hoatzin&#x27;s claws are of more recent origin, and may be a secondary adaptation from its frequent need to leave the nest and climb about in dense vines and trees well before it can fly. A similar trait is seen in turacos, whose nestlings use claws on their wings to climb in trees.

== Taxonomy, systematics, and evolution ==

The generic name &quot;Opisthocomus&quot; comes from Ancient Greek &quot;ópisthokomos&quot; derived from &quot;ópisthe&quot; ( &quot;ópisthen&quot; before a consonant) &quot;behind&quot; and &quot;kómē&quot; &quot;hair&quot; altogether meaning &quot;long hair behind&quot; referring to its large crest.

The hoatzin was originally described in 1776 by German zoologist Statius Müller. Much debate has occurred about the hoatzin&#x27;s relationships with other birds. Because of its distinctness, it has been given its own family, the Opisthocomidae, and its own suborder, the Opisthocomi. At various times, it has been allied with such taxa as the tinamous, the Galliformes (gamebirds), the rails, the bustards, seriemas, sandgrouse, doves, turacos and other Cuculiformes, and mousebirds. A whole genome sequencing study published in 2014 places the hoatzin as the sister taxon of a clade composed of Gruiformes (cranes) and Charadriiformes (plovers). Another genomic study in 2024 instead places it as the sister group to the Phaethoquornithes (containing numerous aquatic bird orders). The combined group was found to be sister to the Mirandornithes (flamingos and grebes).

In 2015, genetic research indicated that the hoatzin is the last surviving member of a bird line that branched off in its own direction 64 million years ago, shortly after the extinction event that killed the nonavian dinosaurs. Another genetic study from 2024 instead suggested a Late Cretaceous origin (around 70 million years ago), but found that this early divergence is shared with a majority of extant bird orders, making it no more primitive than them.

===Fossil record===

With respect to other material evidence, an undisputed fossil record of a close hoatzin relative is specimen UCMP 42823, a single cranium backside. It is of Miocene origin and was recovered in the upper Magdalena River Valley, Colombia, in the well-known fauna of La Venta. This has been placed into a distinct, less derived genus, &quot;Hoazinoides&quot;, but clearly would be placed into the same family as the extant species. It markedly differs in that the cranium of the living hoatzin is characteristic, being much domed, rounded, and shortened, and that these autapomorphies were less pronounced in the Miocene bird. Müller discussed these findings in the light of the supposed affiliation of the hoatzins and the Galliformes, which was the favored hypothesis at that time but had been controversial almost since its inception. He cautioned, however, &quot;that &quot;Hoazinoides&quot; by no means establishes a phyletic junction point with other galliforms&quot; for obvious reasons, as we know today. Anything other than the primary findings of Müller are not to be expected in any case, as by the time of &quot;Hoazinoides&quot;, essentially all modern bird families are either known or believed to have been present and distinct. Going further back in time, the Late Eocene or Early Oligocene (some 34 Mya) &quot;Filholornis&quot; from France has also been considered &quot;proof&quot; of a link between the hoatzin and the gamebirds. The fragmentary fossil &quot;Onychopteryx&quot; from the Eocene of Argentina and the quite complete, but no less enigmatic Early-Middle Eocene (Ypresian-Lutetian, some 48 Mya) &quot;Foro panarium&quot; are sometimes used to argue for a hoatzin-cuculiform (including turacos) link. As demonstrated above, though, this must be considered highly speculative, if not as badly off the mark as the relationship with the Cracidae discussed by Miller.

The earliest record of the order Opisthocomiformes is &quot;Protoazin parisiensis&quot;, from the latest Eocene (about 34 Mya) of Romainville, France. The holotype and only known specimen is NMB PG.70, consisting of partial coracoid, partial scapula, and partial phalanx. According to the phylogenetic analysis performed by the authors, &quot;Namibiavis&quot;, although later, is more basal than &quot;Protoazin&quot;. Opisthocomiforms seem to have been much more widespread in the past, with the present South American distribution being only a relic. By the Early to Middle Miocene, they were probably extinct in Europe already, as formations dated to this time and representing fluvial or lacustrine palaeoenvironments, in which the hoatzin thrives today, have yielded dozens of bird specimens, but no opisthocomiforms. A possible explanation to account for the extinction of &quot;Protoazin&quot; between the Late Eocene and the Early Miocene in Europe, and of &quot;Namibiavis&quot; after the Middle Miocene of sub-Saharan Africa is the arrival of arboreal carnivorans—predation which could have had a devastating effect on the local opisthocomiforms, if they were similarly poor flyers and had a similarly vulnerable nesting strategies as today&#x27;s hoatzins. Felids and viverrids first arrived in Europe from Asia after the Turgai Sea closed, marking the boundary between the Eocene and the Oligocene. None of these predators, and for the matter, no placental predator at all was present in South America before the Great American Interchange 3 Mya; this absence could explain the survival of the hoatzin there. In addition to being the earliest fossil record of an opisthocomiform, &quot;Protoazin&quot; was also the earliest find of one (1912), but it was forgotten for more than a century, being described only in 2014.

&quot;Hoazinavis&quot; is an extinct genus of early opisthocomiforms from Late Oligocene and Early Miocene (about 24–22 Mya) deposits of Brazil. It was collected in 2008 from the Tremembé Formation of São Paulo, Brazil. It was first named by Gerald Mayr, Herculano Alvarenga and Cécile Mourer-Chauviré in 2011 and the type species is &quot;Hoazinavis lacustris&quot;.

&quot;Namibiavis&quot; is another extinct genus of early opisthocomiforms from early Middle Miocene (around 16 Mya) deposits of Namibia. It was collected from Arrisdrift, southern Namibia. It was first named by Cécile Mourer-Chauviré in 2003 and the type species is &quot;Namibiavis senutae&quot;.

== Behavior ==
=== Feeding and habits ===
The hoatzin is a folivore—it eats the leaves (and to a lesser degree, the fruits and flowers) of the plants that grow in its marshy and riverine habitat. It clambers around along the branches in its search for food. The hoatzin uses a leathery “bump” on the bottom of its crop to help balance its weight on the branches. The species was once thought to eat the leaves of only arums and mangroves, but the species is now known to consume the leaves of more than 50 botanical species. One study, undertaken in Venezuela, found that the hoatzin&#x27;s diet was 82% leaves, 10% flowers, and 8% fruit. Any feeding on insects or other animal matter is purely opportunistic or accidental.

One of this species&#x27; many peculiarities is its unique digestive system, which contains specialized bacteria in the front part of the gut that break-down and ferment the foliar material they consume (much like cattle and other ruminants do). This process is more efficient than what has been measured in many other species of birds, with up to 70% of the plant fiber being digested. Unlike ruminants, however, which possess a rumen (a specialized, chambered stomach for bacterial fermentation), the hoatzin has an unusually large crop that is folded into two chambers, with a large, multi-chambered lower esophagus. 

Serrations on the beak help cut leaves into smaller pieces before they are swallowed. Because they lack the teeth of mammals, hoatzins do not chew the cud; instead, a combination of muscular pressure and abrasion by a “cornified” lining of the crop is used as an equivalent to remastication, allowing fermentation and trituration to occur at the same site. The fermented foliage produces methane which the bird expels through burping. Its stomach chamber and gizzard are much smaller than in other birds. Its crop is so large as to displace the flight muscles and keel of the sternum, much to the detriment of its flight capacity. The crop is supported by a thickened skin callus on the tip of the sternum, which helps the bird support the crop on a branch during rest and while digesting its food. A hoatzin&#x27;s meal takes up to 45 hours to pass through its body. With a body weight as low as , the adult hoatzin is the smallest known animal with foregut fermentation (the lower limit for mammals is about ).

Because of aromatic compounds in the leaves they consume, and the bacterial fermentation required to digest them, the birds have a disagreeable, manure-like odor and are only hunted by humans for food in times of dire need; local people also call it the &quot;stinkbird&quot; because of it. Much of the hoatzin’s diet, including various types of &quot;Monstera&quot;, &quot;Philodendron&quot; and other aroids, contains a high concentration of calcium oxalate crystals, which, even in small amounts, can be greatly uncomfortable (and even dangerous) for humans to consume.

=== Breeding ===
Hoatzins are seasonal breeders, breeding during the rainy season, the exact timing of which varies across their range. Hoatzins are gregarious and nest in small colonies, laying two or three eggs in a stick nest in a tree hanging over water in seasonally flooded forests. The chicks are fed on regurgitated fermented food.

==Relationship with humans==
In Brazil, indigenous peoples sometimes collect the eggs for food, and the adults are occasionally hunted, but it is generally rare to consume mature birds, as hoatzin meat is reputed to have a bad taste. Its preferred habitats of forests and inland wetlands are threatened by Amazonian deforestation. The hoatzin is believed to remain fairly common in a large part of its range, but its population is likely decreasing due to habitat loss. The hoatzin is the national bird of Guyana.

<text>During World War II, Mission Elmira was the landing of a significant part of the 82nd Airborne Division’s glider train in Normandy on the evening of 6 June 1944 as part of Operation Neptune, the assault phase of Operation Overlord.

==Mission composition and purpose==
Elmira consisted of 176 Douglas C-47 Skytrain troop carrier aircraft acting as glider tugs, 36 Waco CG-4 gliders, and 140 of the larger Airspeed Horsa gliders, divided into one serial of 26 and three serials of 50 tug-glider combinations. One additional C-47, which had returned to base earlier in the day without dropping its stick of paratroopers, accompanied the last flight of the mission. The planned and briefed landing zone for the gliders was LZ W, located two miles (3 km) southeast of Sainte-Mère-Église, but a smaller landing zone had also been put in operation that morning north of the town on Drop Zone O.

Elmira was considered an essential mission, delivering two battalions of glider artillery and 24 howitzers to the 82nd Airborne. It consisted of four serials of aircraft, the first to arrive ten minutes after Mission Keokuck, a similar but much smaller mission to reinforce the 101st Airborne Division. To reduce congestion over the landing zones, two serials of mission Elmira were delayed two hours until just before sunset. These carried both battalions of glider field artillery and their guns. Because the missions were flown on British Double Summer Time, both were daylight missions, with the first wave taking off at 1907 and arriving at 2104, and the second wave taking off at 2037 and arriving at 2255.

==Mission details==
The first two serials of 76 tug-glider combinations came under heavy ground fire just before the release point. Two C-47s were shot down after release and half the survivors suffered battle damage. Unknown to the troop carriers, troops of the German 795th Georgian Battalion occupied part of the landing zone, and the &quot;Eureka&quot; transponding radar beacon landing aids had been moved two miles (3 km) to the northwest on Drop Zone/Landing Zone O. The C-47s released their gliders for the original LZ, unaware of the aids on LZ O. Although the 82nd Airborne considered the landings inaccurate because they did not land on LZ O, most came down within of the original LZ. Of the 3 Wacos and 21 Horsa destroyed, most were the result of German mortar and artillery fire after landing.

The second wave of mission Elmira arrived at 2255 just as the terrain was enveloped in shadow, and since no other pathfinder aids were operating, headed for the Eureka beacon on LZ O. Approximately halfway there, it came under the most severe ground fire of the day, since the route to LZ O passed directly over and along the German lines. Despite this, damage was similar to that of the serials that had come in two hours earlier, with three C-47s ditching on the way home. The last two glider serials had mixed accuracy. The first released early and came down near or within German lines, but the second came down on Landing Zone O, except for 5 who followed their briefing orders and landed on LZ W. Even so, virtually all of the personnel of both battalions made their way to the 82nd Airborne positions by morning, and had 15 of their 24 guns in operation by sundown of June 8.

Casualties in mission Elmira were 15 killed, 17 wounded, and 4 missing among the glider pilots; and 33 killed and 124 wounded among the passengers. Strom Thurmond, then a lieutenant colonel in a civil affairs unit was at age 41 credited with being the oldest person attached to the division to go into Normandy with the invasion. He later became the longest-serving senator in United States history.

==Description==
The only living representative is the hoatzin (&quot;Opisthocomus hoazin&quot;), which lives in the Amazon and the Orinoco delta in South America. Several fossil species have been identified, including one from Africa and one from Europe.

The hoatzin is a stunning, colourful bird from South America. The hoatzin is found in the rainforest of the Amazon. It has a long, permanently erected crest which gives the species a distinctive silhouette. This gregarious species is often found in groups of more than 40 birds, and up to 100 birds during breeding season which occurs during rainfalls. The nest is a flat platform in bush or tree above water. The chicks are semi-precocial and leave the nest at about two to three weeks of age. The adults feed them with semi-digested slimy mass from their crops, and the young are fed during the first four or five months of their life. The young nestlings can jump out into the water, and swim with wings and feet, in order to escape predators at nest. Hoatzin embryos are known to develop very quickly compared to other birds.

The hoatzin lives in tropical forested wetlands of 200 to 500 meters elevation. The hoatzin is an arboreal species and is folivorous, feeding on leaves, flowers and fruits of a small number of plant species. It has a large crop that uses bacteria to break down the leaves that it eats. The hoatzin is unique because it has bacteria in its crop that breaks down its food while it is still in the crop. This is a process called foregut fermentation. It rarely drinks because its diet is high in water. The hoatzin is sedentary and widespread in suitable habitat. They are noisy birds, calling in unison, uttering large numbers of varied sounds.

In addition to foregut fermentation, the hoatzin has a highly modified skeleton to accommodate its large crop, and in the young of this species, wing claws at the wrist joint which are used to climb among the branches of the nest tree.

<text>Robert Douglas McIntyre (15 December 1913 – 2 February 1998) was a Scottish physician and a Scottish National Party politician and Member of Parliament.

McIntyre studied medicine at the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow, and worked as a GP and a consultant pulmonologist. He came to political prominence in 1945 when he won the Motherwell by-election, becoming the SNP&#x27;s first ever Member of Parliament.

McIntyre served as the Leader of the Scottish National Party from 1947 to 1956, and as President of the SNP from 1958 to 1980. He was the Provost of Stirling from 1967 to 1975. Known affectionately as &quot;Doc Mac&quot;, he was often referred to as the &quot;Father of the SNP&quot;.

==Early life and medical career==
McIntyre was born in Motherwell, the son of John Ebenezer McIntyre, a minister of the United Free Church of Scotland. He was educated at Hamilton Academy and Daniel Stewart&#x27;s College. After a short period working at an accountants&#x27; office, McIntyre managed to acquire the necessary qualifications to attend the University of Edinburgh, where he initially studied Chemistry, before switching to study Medicine.

At university, he was Chairman of the University Labour Party and an active member of Edinburgh University Socialist Society. He also served as the University Labour Party&#x27;s delegate on the Edinburgh Trades and Labour Council in 1935.

In December 1938, McIntyre graduated with an MB ChB, and joined a general practice in Warwick, England as an assistant. Following brief spells as a General practitioner in Musselburgh and Polmont, he served as a house surgeon at Stirling Royal Infirmary, and then as House Physician at Bangour Village Hospital. In this period, he developed an interest in the area of public health and studied at the University of Glasgow to gain a Diploma in Public Health. After qualifying, McIntyre was appointed as Senior Resident at Hawkhead Hospital in Paisley; a hospital for infectious diseases. The early-1940s witnessed a dramatic increase in the confirmed cases of diphtheria in Scotland. McIntyre was in charge of a major campaign of diphtheria immunisation directed at Paisley&#x27;s schoolchildren, visiting every school in the area to persuade the children and their parents to get themselves vaccinated against the lethal disease.

Robert McIntyre then took up a position under Glasgow Corporation&#x27;s Department of Health as Port Boarding Medical Officer, based at Greenock. This involved his being part of a team which had the responsibility of ensuring that ships were free of infections before they proceeded up the River Clyde to Glasgow, and also liaising with the vessels&#x27; medical staff.

Following his defeat at the 1945 general election, he served for a short period as a locum GP on North Uist, before obtaining a position with Stirling County Council as a Tuberculosis Officer responsible to the Medical Officer for Health. With the creation of the National Health Service in 1948, McIntyre was appointed as Consultant Chest Physician at Stirling Royal Infirmary. He would remain in the post until his retirement.

==Political career==
McIntyre had joined the Labour Party in 1936, and was active in Labour politics at Edinburgh University. However, he had become increasingly disillusioned with the Labour Party&#x27;s commitment to Scottish home rule and had been disappointed when he and his fellow students at the Edinburgh University Labour Party had sent a resolution to the Scottish Council of the Labour Party, only to be informed that the council was not involved in the formation of Labour Party policy. Steeped in Scottish history and culture, he believed in the right of small nations to self-government.

In 1940, McIntyre joined the Scottish National Party and became the party&#x27;s membership secretary when it was still headed by John MacCormick, but he resisted MacCormick&#x27;s later attempts to change the SNP from supporting a policy of full Scottish independence to supporting a modicum of Home Rule. MacCormick would leave the SNP in 1942 from which point McIntyre became the party&#x27;s leading figure, serving as National Secretary (1942-1945) and as vice-chairman (1945-1947), before being chosen as Chairman (leader) of the SNP in May 1947.

On 13 April 1945, shortly before the end of World War II, McIntyre won the Motherwell by-election, with a narrow majority of 617 votes over his Labour opponent. He made history as the first SNP candidate to be elected as a Member of Parliament. Upon arriving at Parliament, he had difficulty finding the customary two sponsors to allow him to take his seat, as members did not want to break party loyalties. Two reluctant sponsors were found but McIntyre chose to present himself to the Speaker alone, later writing &quot;I very clearly stated to the people of Motherwell and Wishaw that I would give no allegiance to the London-controlled parties&quot;. A vote to waive the rule was lost, and eventually he accepted the sponsorship of James Barr and Alexander Sloan &quot;under protest&quot;.

He lost the seat only three months later at the 1945 general election, to the Labour Party. He then returned to his medical practice, working in Stirling Royal Infirmary to treat and prevent tuberculosis. However, he continued to stand at every subsequent general election, up to October 1974, also standing at a bye-election in 1971, thirteen in total, the most unsuccessful attempts by a former MP to be re-elected to the UK Parliament. 
After McIntyre stood down as party leader in 1956, he was elected as President of the Scottish National Party, holding this office until 1980. In 1956, he was also elected as a member of Stirling Burgh Council, a position he held until 1975. He was Provost of Stirling from 1967 to 1975. McIntyre was first (and last) vice-president of the Celtic League (from 1961 to 1971). Gwynfor Evans was president at the time.

In 1962 he was nominated by the Scottish Nationalist Association as a candidate for Rector of the University of Glasgow, where he finished second behind Albert Luthuli who was then the President of the African National Congress.

==Personal life==
McIntyre married Letitia Macleod in 1954 and they had one son together.

Robert McIntyre died on 2 February 1998, aged 84.

<text>Bondage cuffs are restraints designed for use in sexual bondage situations. Compared to conventional handcuffs, they are wide wrist and ankle restraints generally made of leather, often padded with soft leather or fake fur. Bondage cuffs may be fastened at the wrists and/or ankles by a locking mechanism, by a buckle or by velcro. They are secured around the wrist or ankle, and the cuffs may then be attached to each other or another object.

They may be fitted with D-ring attachments or buckles to which nylon webbing, chain or another restraining strap may be attached. The straps may have a loop mechanism to allow the tightening of the straps.

Bondage cuffs are typically secured to each wrist and ankle, and to each other and other objects depending on the needs of each play. A set of cuffs may be used to create a hogtie, and a pair of ankle cuffs can be used together with thigh-width straps to create a frogtie. They are typically used in conjunction with other bondage equipment, such as leg spreader bars.

== Safety considerations ==
Bondage cuffs are designed to be safer than conventional handcuffs. Unlike bondage cuffs, the primary design goals of handcuffs are not comfort and safety, but immobilization and prevention of escape, and they are not padded to try to reduce the risk of nerve damage and other injuries. Nevertheless, as with all restraint devices, it is still possible for the use of bondage cuffs to cause serious injuries if misused or not monitored carefully.

Ordinary bondage cuffs are not designed to be safe when used to carry any significant load. Suspension cuffs are a specialized form of bondage cuffs, designed to be used to suspend the body during suspension bondage.

<doc id="262751" wikidata="Q233483" url="?curid=262751" title="Diamanda Galás">
<text>Diamanda Galás (born August 29, 1955) is an American musician, singer-songwriter, and visual artist. She has campaigned for AIDS education and the rights of the infected.

Galás&#x27;s commitment to addressing social issues and her involvement in collective action has made her concentrate on themes such as AIDS, mental illness, despair, loss of dignity, political injustice, historical revisionism, and war crimes. Galás has attracted the attention of the press particularly for her voice – a soprano sfogato – and written accounts that describe her work as original and thought-provoking refer to her as &quot;capable of the most unnerving vocal terror&quot;, an &quot;aesthetic revolutionary&quot;, &quot;a mourner for the world&#x27;s victims&quot; and &quot;an envoy of risk, honesty and commitment&quot;.

As a composer, pianist, organist and performance artist, Galás has presented mainly her own work, but her live performances have also included works by other musicians, such as the avant-garde composers Iannis Xenakis and Vinko Globokar, jazz musician Bobby Bradford, saxophonist John Zorn, and Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones. Galás&#x27;s recordings have also included collaborations, some of which are with the bands Recoil and Erasure, instrumentalist Barry Adamson, and musician Can Oral (also known as Khan), among others.

==Background and education==

Galás was born and raised in San Diego, California, to a Maniot Greek-American mother from Dover, New Hampshire, Georgianna Koutrelakos-Galás, and an Egyptian-American father from Lynn, Massachusetts, James Galás, both of whom belonged to the Greek Orthodox culture but considered themselves agnostic. Her father&#x27;s Greek ancestors were from Smyrna, Pontus, and Chios, while one of his grandmothers was an Egyptian from Alexandria. Galás does not refer to her Smyrniote and Pontic ancestry as &quot;Turkish&quot;, but rather as Anatolian.

Galás&#x27;s first contact with music was during her childhood in San Diego, where her parents lived and worked as teachers. Her father, who was also a gospel choir director, taught her how to play the piano when she was three years old, while introducing her later to classical music, the New Orleans jazz tradition, rebetika and other classics of his Greek heritage, some blues standards, and other historical music genres. Galas also took cello and violin lessons, and studied a wide range of musical forms. By the age of fourteen, she had been playing gigs in San Diego with her father&#x27;s band, performing Greek and Arabic music, and she had also made her orchestral debut with the San Diego Symphony as the soloist for Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Piano Concerto No. 1&quot;. But while her father encouraged her to play the piano, he did not want her to sing because he believed that singing was for &quot;hookers and idiots.&quot;

Galás and her brother Phillip-Dimitri acquired a taste for dark literature at an early age. Their inspirations were the Marquis de Sade, Friedrich Nietzsche, Antonin Artaud, and Edgar Allan Poe.

In the 1970s, Galás studied biochemistry at the University of Southern California, specializing in immunology and hematology studies. Her post-graduate studies include a master&#x27;s program in the music department of the University of California, San Diego, which encouraged her to work at its Center for Music Experiment to develop her own vocal technique. Outside academia, Galás&#x27;s vocal training was supported by private lessons in San Diego with bel canto tutor Frank Kelly, and with voice coaches Vicky Hall in Berlin and Barbara Maier Gustern in New York.

==Music==

=== Early years (1970s–1986) ===
In the early 1970s, Galás and her friend contra-bass player Mark Dresser joined the jazz band Black Music Infinity, which included drummer Stanley Crouch, trumpeter Bobby Bradford, cornetist Butch Morris, flautist James Newton, and saxophonist David Murray. She later collaborated with members of the San Diego band CETA VI, which included, among others, jazz saxophonist Jim French, with whom Galás went on to record and release her first compositions, as part of the album &quot;If Looks Could Kill&quot; (1979), together with guitarist and sound engineer Henry Kaiser.

At the same time, Galás was preparing for her live solo debut, which took place at the 1979 Festival d&#x27;Avignon, in France, where she was doing post-graduate studies. It was a performance of Vinko Globokar&#x27;s &quot;Un Jour Comme un Autre&quot; (A Day Like Any Other), an opera based on Amnesty International&#x27;s documentation about the arrest and torture of a Turkish woman for alleged treason. Globokar was the director of the Instruments and Voice department at the music and sound research center IRCAM (Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique), where Galás had been doing further experimentation on her vocal technique. During her time in Paris, Galás also met the Greek composer and architect Iannis Xenakis, whose composition &quot;Akanthos&quot; (1977) she sang with IRCAM&#x27;s Ensemble InterContemporain in 1980, while she was still in Europe. After her return to the US, Galás performed one more work by Xenakis, his composition &quot;N&#x27;Shima&quot; (1975), in the US premiere of it in New York in 1981, alongside soprano Genevieve Renon-McLaughlin, who sang one of the two vocal parts of this piece.

Her first solo album, &quot;The Litanies of Satan&quot; (1982), was also an operatic work. It included only two compositions: a twelve-minute piece entitled &#x27;Wild Women with Steak-Knives&#x27;, which was described by Galás in the album notes as tragedy-grotesque deriving from her work &quot;Eyes Without Blood&quot;, and another lengthy composition, &#x27;Litanies of Satan&#x27;, an adaptation to music of a section from Charles Baudelare&#x27;s poem &quot;Les Fleurs du Mal&quot;. Her second album, &quot;Diamanda Galas&quot; (1984), also contained two lengthy compositions. They were &#x27;Panoptikon&#x27;, which was dedicated to Jack Henry Abbott, whose 1981 autobiographical book &quot;In the Belly of the Beast&quot; described his experience of the prison system, and &#x27;Tragoudia Apo To Aima Exoun Fonos&#x27; (&#x27;Song From the Blood of Those Murdered&#x27;), a Greek-language piece dedicated to those political prisoners who were either murdered or executed during the Greek military regimes in the years 1967–74.

=== Mute Records (1986–2008) ===
Galás began writing and performing on the subject of AIDS around 1984, while living in San Francisco. This theme resulted in the trilogy &quot;Masque of the Red Death&quot;, an operatic trilogy which included &quot;The Divine Punishment&quot; (1986), &quot;Saint of the Pit&quot; (1986) and &quot;You Must Be Certain of the Devil&quot; (1988). In these three works Galás detailed the suffering of people with AIDS. Shortly after the recording of the trilogy&#x27;s first volume began, her brother, playwright Philip-Dimitri Galás, became sick with AIDS, which inspired her to join activist groups that raised awareness about this new illness. Her brother died in 1986, just before the completion of the trilogy.

Taking a break from her own recordings, Galás appeared on the 1989 studio album &quot;Moss Side Story&quot; by Barry Adamson (formerly of Magazine and Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds). In &quot;Moss Side Story&quot;, which was described by the press as a &quot;soundtrack for a non-existent film-noir&quot;, Galás sang the opening track, &#x27;On the Wrong Side of Relaxation&#x27;. In 1992, Galás released the album &quot;Vena Cava&quot;, a series of unaccompanied voice pieces recorded in New York during a live performance at The Kitchen. For her next record, Galás changed stylistic direction by turning to the blues tradition and interpreting a wide range of songs with only a piano and solo voice. This stylistic turn produced the studio album &quot;The Singer&quot; (1992), on which she covered songs by Willie Dixon, Roy Acuff, and Screamin&#x27; Jay Hawkins, as well as &quot;Gloomy Sunday&quot;, a song written by Hungarian pianist and composer Rezső Seress in 1933 and translated into English by Desmond Carter. This material formed the basis of the video &quot;Judgement Day&quot;, which was released in 1993.

In the next three years, Galás returned to collaborations with other musicians. She first worked with Led Zeppelin bassist John Paul Jones, a longtime admirer of her work, to write material for a record, and the album &quot;The Sporting Life&quot; was produced with him in 1994. A tour that followed the album&#x27;s release saw the two musicians performing together live on stage as well as on the popular MTV show The Jon Stewart Show. Then, in the same year, two of Galás&#x27;s songs from her previous album were featured on the soundtrack for Oliver Stone&#x27;s film &quot;Natural Born Killers&quot;. In 1995, Galás contributed vocals to the eponymous album of British synth-pop duo Erasure at the invitation of the lead singer, Andy Bell, and the following year she took part in the album &quot;Closed on Account of Rabies&quot;, a tribute to Edgar Allan Poe which also included Iggy Pop, Debbie Harry and Marianne Faithfull, who lent their voices to the tales of the legendary author. Galás&#x27; reading of &quot;The Black Cat&quot; was the longest recording on the compilation.

In 1998, Galás released &quot;Malediction and Prayer&quot;, which was recorded live in 1996 and 1997. In 2000, Galás worked with Recoil by contributing her voice to the album &quot;Liquid&quot;. She was the lead vocalist on the album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Strange Hours&quot;, for which she also wrote the lyrics, and can be heard on &quot;Jezebel&quot; and &quot;Vertigen&quot; as a backing vocalist.
Galás&#x27;s next project revolved around the Armenian, Anatolian-Greek and Assyrian genocides that occurred between 1914 and 1923. This work took the title &#x27;Defixiones – Will and Testament&#x27; in reference to the last wishes of the dead who had been taken to their graves under extreme circumstances, as &#x27;defixiones&#x27; in Greece and Asia Minor is associated with the warnings written on gravestones by relatives of the dead to warn people against desecrating them. This material formed part of the 80-minute long album &quot;&quot; (2003), which was released simultaneously with &quot;La Serpenta Canta&quot; (2003), a live album including cover versions recorded between May 1999 and November 2002. One of the unaccompanied vocal pieces from &quot;Defixiones: Will and Testament&quot; (2003), &quot;Orders from the Dead&quot;, was later used on the album &quot;Aealo&quot; (2010) by Greek black metal band Rotting Christ.

In 2008, Galás released her seventh live album, &quot;Guilty Guilty Guilty&quot;, a collection of cover songs that she used to play as a piano accompanist in her father&#x27;s band when she was young. The album emerged from material she began to work on around the time when her parents – to whom it is dedicated – happened to stay in the same hospital at the same time for different treatments; seeing how they handled it and how they held hands and took courage from each other during that time reminded her of the love songs she had learned in her father&#x27;s band. Galás has stated that these songs also made her explore her own emotions at a time when a long-term personal relationship had ended, particularly Henderson&#x27;s and Brown&#x27;s &quot;The Thrill Is Gone&quot;, a song performed by Chet Baker and others. This set of new re-interpretations of old, love songs was recorded live at Galás&#x27;s Valentine&#x27;s Day concert at New York&#x27;s Knitting Factory in 2006.

=== Intravenal Sound Operations (2009–present) ===
After 2009 Galás found herself without a record deal, and until 2016 she was remixing and remastering her earlier works as well as recording some new songs which were made available online digitally as self-released singles. Galás&#x27;s focus in this period was on regaining ownership and control of her entire catalogue, since the selling of her records by Mute to EMI, which passed them to BMG, had made Galás&#x27;s back catalogue unavailable. In the meantime, two new albums, &quot;All the Way&quot; (2017) and &quot;At Saint Thomas the Apostle Harlem&quot; (2017), were released simultaneously through her own label, Intravenal Sound Operations, and a world tour followed.

In 2019, Galás regained the rights of her back catalogue and her discography was made available again. The result was the release of a remastered version of her debut album &quot;The Litanies of Satan&quot; (1982), which had been originally released on Y Records. This was followed by the 21-minute piano work &quot;De-formation: Piano Variations&quot; (2020), which was based on music for the 1912 poem &quot;Das Fieberspital&quot; &quot;(The Fever Hospital)&quot; by the German expressionist writer Georg Heym. As work on remastering her previous releases continued, Galás made available another two remastered works: her albums &quot;Diamanda Galas&quot; (1984) and &quot;The Divine Punishment&quot; (1986), which came out in October 2021 and in June 2022 respectively.

In August 2022, Galás released the studio album &quot;Broken Gargoyles&quot;. The first incarnation of the work was played in July 2021 as a sound installation at the Nikolaikapelle (former Kapellen Leprosarium – Leper Sanctuary) in Hanover, Germany. Earlier versions had been performed at the Dark Mofo festival and other live music events, and sections of it had also been included in different multi-media installations. The inspiration came from a pre-First World War poem by the German poet Georg Heym that Galás came across in a book about German expressionist art and poetry. This led her to other cultural artefacts from the period, including a 1924 book by anti-war campaigner Ernst Friedrich of photographs showing soldiers with damaged faces, which were also responsible for the album title, as &#x27;gargoyles&#x27; was a term used by hospital staff to refer to those soldiers. The album comprises two long pieces titled &#x27;Mutilatus&#x27; and &#x27;Abiectio&#x27;.

On 14 June 2024, a new album of live recordings was released. Titled &quot;Diamanda Galás in Concert&quot; (2024), it contained a selection of songs from her 2017 performances at Thalia Hall in Chicago and Neptune Theatre in Seattle. They were both previously unreleased songs as well as different versions of material from earlier albums. In September 2024, Galás released a remastered version of her album &quot;Saint of the Pit&quot; (1986).

== Art ==

=== Performance art ===
Although Galás found herself in the mid-70s studying and practicing music and performance in the West Coast, where performance artists tended to be much more reliant on text and closer to the theatrical event than their European and East-Coast counterparts, her use of text did not restrict her performances to a script, as her introduction of electronically processed sounds shifted her attention towards vocal improvisation to allow more freedom. Her first public performances at New York&#x27;s The Kitchen and the 1980 Moers Festival reflect this direction, and works such as &#x27;Wild Women with Steak-Knives&#x27; and &#x27;Panoptikon&#x27;, which were developed in this period and used heavily the improvisation element and vocal experimentation, were later recorded and released as music records for her first two solo albums in 1982 and 1984 respectively.

In 1990, Galás selected material from her AIDS trilogy and created a performance piece for the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in New York. With a theme addressing the Roman Catholic Church&#x27;s indifference to sufferers of HIV and Galás&#x27;s introduction of theatrical props, such as artificial blood and special lights, her performance, for some members of her audience, &quot;combined ululating shrieks, whispers and howls with an intensity that left the audience stunned.&quot; The performance was documented in photographs and audio, and a live album was released under the title &quot;Plague Mass&quot; in 1991.

=== Painting ===
Galás has stated that, for her, painting acts as &quot;an exorcism of that which is troubling [her] deeply&quot;, and that the visual language she uses allows her &quot;to paint an analogue of the experience, the misery, and therefore get rid of it for the time being. But only because of that vocabulary&quot;, she adds. Commentators suggest that Galás&#x27;s paintings look to the past by presenting stylistic similarities with artworks by Expressionist artists such as Edvard Munch, Paul Klee and Jean Dubuffet. One of the Expressionist artists that Galás mentions as influential to her is the Austrian painter and playwright Oskar Kokoschka, especially with his short play &quot;Murderer, the Hope of Women&quot; (1909), which has very little text but creates &#x27;explosions&#x27; by being immensely expressive. Galás has also been compared to the artist David Wojnarowicz, whose work is seen as falling within the wider limits of neo-expressionism, for the similarities in which they invite horror through immediate and explicit expression. For Galás, the visual art that she does &quot;has the same impulse and subject material&quot; as her music, because she cannot interrupt the creative process when working on a subjects, &quot;so these are simply different treatments of similar subjects.&quot; Many of Galás&#x27;s paintings often borrow their subjects from themes she has explored in her performances and recordings, looking back to the same historical events that have been inspiring her to write lyrics and compose music, as is made apparent by the use of titles such as &#x27;Ragip:Turkish Prison for Infidels&#x27;, &#x27;Medusa&#x27;, &#x27;Artemis&#x27;, Cleopatra&#x27;, &#x27;Mani: Me Epifilakzin – Salt Maketh A Man Who Fears No God&#x27; and &#x27;Ethiopian Martyr/Amharic Brother to Greek Orthodox, Egyptian Coptic and Palestinian Orthodox&#x27;, among others.

In 2011, Galás donated a painting to the Coilhouse International Fundraising Silent Auction, which was part of The Black &amp; White &amp; Red All Over Ball organized by New York&#x27;s digital and print magazine, and corresponding blog, Coilhouse. Galás&#x27;s work was a luminescent, or a &#x27;glow-in-the-dark fabric painting&#x27;, as described by the magazine editors, featuring &quot;mysterious and ferocious organic shapes painted on a thick piece of black fabric and adorned with a bright prism″.

=== Installation ===
In 1988, Galás provided the music to the audiovisual installation &quot;Faded Wallpaper&quot; (1988) by British artist Tina Keane, which included a neon sign and a video work that featured, among other material, extracts from Charlotte Perkins Gilman&#x27;s 1892 story &#x27;The Yellow Wallpaper&#x27;.

In 2010, a four-minute video artwork entitled &quot;A Fire in My Belly&quot; (1992), which was made using a composition by Galás from her album &quot;Plague Mass&quot; (1991) and a film by the artist David Wojnarowicz, was featured in the exhibition Hide/Seek at Smithsonian&#x27;s National Portrait Gallery. The artwork was deemed by some groups to be controversial and it was removed from that show, with Galas immediately responding to the Smithsonian&#x27;s removal with a written statement that was circulated in the press.

In 2011, Galás collaborated with Soviet dissident artist Vladislav Shabalin on &quot;Aquarium&quot;, a sound installation inspired by the environmental disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. The event took place at Leonhardskirche in Basel (Switzerland) from June 12 to 19. &quot;Aquarium&quot; was then installed at the church of San Francesco in Udine (Italy), at the festival &quot;Vicino/Lontano&quot;, from May 9 to 12, 2013.

In July 2020, Galás presented via Fridman Gallery&#x27;s online space a work inspired by poetry and visuals related to physical and mental scars in soldiers who were injured in the First World War. With collaborators such as artist and sound engineer Daniel Neumann, video artist Carlton Bright, and artist Robert Knocke on a guest appearance, Galás produced &#x27;Broken Gargoyles&#x27;, an installation based on the words of German poet Georg Heym and on photographs by Ernst Friedrich.

==Films==
In 1984, Galás made a voice cameo appearance, performing the voices for the Japanese assassins and flying weapons in Cannon Films&#x27; Ninja III: The Domination. This was followed by three more film appearances: she made the voice of the witch in John Milius&#x27;s &quot;Conan the Barbarian (1982 film)&quot;, the voice of the dead in Wes Craven&#x27;s film &quot;The Serpent and the Rainbow,&quot; and also offered her voice to Francis Ford Coppola&#x27;s 1992 film, &quot;Bram Stoker&#x27;s Dracula&quot;, adding erotically charged moans, breathless sighs, and high-pitched shrieks. She also contributed the song &quot;Exeloume&quot; to the film. In 1995, Galás was commissioned to record a cover version of the Schwartz-Dietz song &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; for Clive Barker&#x27;s film &quot;Lord of Illusions,&quot; and her song appeared during the closing credits.

While two of her earlier recordings, &quot;Le Treizième Revient&quot; and &quot;Exeloume&quot;, appeared on the soundtrack to Derek Jarman&#x27;s &quot;The Last of England&quot; (1987), Galás herself also made an appearance in a film, as in 1990 she took part in Rosa von Praunheim&#x27;s documentary &quot;Positive&quot; about AIDS in the New York gay scene.

In 2011, Galás premiered &quot;Schrei 27&quot;, a film made in collaboration with Italian filmmaker Davide Pepe. It was based on &quot;Schrei X&quot;, a 1994 radio piece which was a co-commission to Galás by New American Radio and the Walker Art Center, and it has been described as an &quot;unrelenting&quot; portrait of a body suffering torture in a medical facility.

Most recently, Galás contributed work to James Wan&#x27;s 2013 horror film, &quot;The Conjuring&quot;, and her composition &quot;Free Among the Dead&quot; from the album &quot;The Divine Punishment&quot; (1986) was featured in Zoe Mavroudi&#x27;s documentary, &quot;Ruins: Chronicle of an HIV Witch-Hunt&quot; (2013).

== Awards ==
In 2005, Galás was awarded Italy&#x27;s prestigious Demetrio Stratos International Career Award.

== Activism ==
In 1986, Galás&#x27;s brother, playwright Philip-Dimitri Galás, died from AIDS, and this inspired her to join the AIDS activist group ACT UP. Her subsequent involvement in ACT UP&#x27;s Stop the Church demonstration resulted in her arrest on December 10, 1989, inside Saint Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. The group was protesting Cardinal O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s opposition to AIDS education and to the distribution of condoms in public schools. She was among 53 people arrested that day.

== Cultural references ==
Galás was mentioned in Michael Kustow&#x27;s autobiographical book &quot;One in Four&quot; (1987), which uses the form of a journal to tell the author&#x27;s story for the year 1986, when he was working as a Commissioning Editor for the Arts in the British TV station Channel Four. Galás&#x27;s name does not appear directly in the book, but several references to her are made in a conversation between the author and the owner of the independent music label Some Bizzare Records Stevo Pearce, such as the use of cutting-edge technology in her live performances, her singing technique, and her Greek heritage. The following dialogue between these two persons illustrates best how this is an indirect mention of Galás:
My label&#x27;s called Some Bizzare. ... I&#x27;ve got the best f***ing TV show you&#x27;ll ever see. Drama, video art, music, films made by the bands themselves. You&#x27;ll get ratings. Innovation? I can give Channel Four all the innovation it wants. Greek singer, for example. She wears twenty contact microphones round her body, like necklaces, she&#x27;s an opera singer, it&#x27;s pure unaccompanied transformed voice. It&#x27;ll drive your viewers crazy!

== Critical analyses ==
Musicologist Susan McClary has written about Galás in her study &quot;Feminist Endings: Music, Gender, and Sexuality&quot; (2002). McClary looks at Galás&#x27;s work in a discussion about the representation of women in famous operas as an example of how Galás&#x27;s approach confronts the narrow portrayal of women in those works and how she renovated the operatic tradition with subjects created through enactment.

Art historian Nicholas Chare discusses the concert performance &quot;Todesfuge&quot; (&quot;Death&#x27;s Fugue&quot;) by Diamanda Galás in his study &quot;Auschwitz and Afterimages: Abjection, Witnessing and Representation&quot; (2011). Chare is interested in the Holocaust and representations of it in painting, photography, musical performance and museum artefacts, so in the section where he examines how Galás has transformed the words in the poem &quot;Todesfuge&quot;, which was written by the Romanian-born German-language poet Paul Celan, he looks at her work to investigate the relationship between style and horror in music, poetry and art.

== Influences ==
Galás has cited multiple artists as influences on her music, including Maria Callas, Annette Peacock, Patty Waters, John Lee Hooker, Johnny Cash, Ray Charles, and Jimi Hendrix. She is additionally influenced greatly by Greek and Middle Eastern styles of singing, and also blues music. Galás has also expressed admiration for the comedian Don Rickles, who she has called &quot;my hero&quot;, as well as the work of poets such as Henri Michaux and Georg Heym, and an array of other musicians, including Chet Baker, Doris Day, The Supremes, Gladys Knight, Miki Howard, Whitney Houston, Amy Winehouse and Adele.

<text>Tango is a partner dance and social dance that originated in the 1880s along the Río de la Plata, the natural border between Argentina and Uruguay. The tango was born in the impoverished port areas of these countries from a combination of Argentine Milonga, Spanish-Cuban Habanera, and Uruguayan Candombe celebrations. It was frequently practiced in the brothels and bars of ports, where business owners employed bands to entertain their patrons. It then spread to the rest of the world. Many variations of this dance currently exist around the world.

On August 31, 2009, UNESCO approved a joint proposal by Argentina and Uruguay to include the tango in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

==History==

Tango is a dance that has influences from African and European culture. Dances from the Candombe ceremonies of former African enslaved people helped shape the modern day tango. The dance originated in working-class districts of Buenos Aires and Montevideo. The music derived from the fusion of various forms of music from Europe. The words &quot;tango&quot; and &quot;tambo&quot; around the River Plate basin were initially used to refer to musical gatherings of slaves, with written records of colonial authorities attempting to ban such gatherings as early as 1789.

Initially, it was just one of the many dances, but it soon became popular throughout society, as theatres and street barrel organs spread it from the suburbs to the working-class slums, which were packed with hundreds of thousands of European immigrants.

When the tango began to spread internationally around 1900, cultural norms were generally conservative, and so tango dancing was widely regarded as extremely sexual and inappropriate for public display. This led to a phenomenon of culture shock. Additionally, the combination of African, Native American and European cultural influences in tango was new and unusual to most of the Western world.

Many neighbourhoods of Buenos Aires have their particular tango histories: for example La Boca, San Telmo and Boedo. At Boedo Avenue, Cátulo Castillo, Homero Manzi and other singers and composers used to meet at the Japanese Cafe with the Boedo Group.

In the early years of the 20th century, dancers and orchestras from Buenos Aires travelled to Europe, and the first European tango craze took place in Paris, soon followed by London, Berlin, and other capitals. Tango historian Nardo Zalko, a native of Buenos Aires who lived most of his life in Paris, investigated the mutual fertilization between the two cities in his work, &quot;Paris – Buenos Aires, Un Siècle de Tango&quot; (&quot;A Century of Tango&quot;). Towards the end of 1913, it hit New York City as well as Finland. In the U.S., around 1911, the word &quot;&quot; was often applied to dances in a or rhythm such as the one-step. The term was fashionable and did not indicate that tango steps would be used in the dance, although they might be. Tango music was sometimes played but at a rather fast tempo. Instructors of the period would sometimes refer to this as a &quot;North American tango&quot;, versus the so-called &quot;Argentine tango&quot;. The tango was controversial because of its perceived sexual overtones and, by the end of 1913, the dance teachers who had introduced the dance to Paris were banished from the city. By 1914, more authentic tango stylings were soon developed, along with some variations like Albert Newman&#x27;s &quot;Minuet&quot; tango.

In Argentina, the onset in 1929 of the Great Depression, and restrictions introduced after the overthrow of the Hipólito Yrigoyen government in 1930, caused a temporary decline in tango&#x27;s popularity. Its fortunes were reversed later in the 1930s, and tango again became widely fashionable and a matter of national pride under the first Perón government, which in turn had a major effect on Argentinian culture overall. Mariano Mores played a role in the resurgence of the tango in 1950s Argentina. Mores&#x27;s &quot;Taquito Militar&quot; was premiered in 1952 during a governmental speech by President Juan D. Perón, which generated a strong political and cultural controversy between different views of the concepts of &quot;cultured&quot; music and &quot;popular&quot; music, as well as the links between both &quot;cultures&quot;.

Tango declined again in the late 1950s, as a result of economic depression and the banning of public gatherings by the military dictatorships; male-only tango practice—the custom at the time—was considered &quot;public gathering&quot;. That, indirectly, boosted the popularity of rock and roll because, unlike tango, it did not require such gatherings. However, in the late 1980s the tango again experienced a resurgence in Argentina, partly due to the endeavors of Osvaldo Peredo.

In 2009, the tango was added to the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

=== Etymology ===

There are several theories regarding the origin of the word &quot;tango&quot;, none of which has been proven. An African culture is often credited as the creator of this word; in particular, it is theorized that the word derives from the Yoruba word &quot;&quot;, which refers to Shango, the God of Thunder in traditional Yoruba religion. This theory suggests that the word “shangó” was morphed through the dilution of the Nigerian language once it reached South America via slave trade. According to an alternative theory, &quot;tango&quot; is derived from the Spanish word for &quot;drum&quot;, &quot;&quot;. This word was then mispronounced by Buenos Aires’ lower-class inhabitants to become &quot;tambo&quot;, ultimately resulting in the common &quot;tango&quot;. It is also sometimes theorized that the word is derived from the Portuguese word &quot;&quot;, which means &quot;to play a musical instrument&quot;. Another Portuguese word, &quot;&quot;, a combination of the verb &quot;tanger&quot; (&quot;to touch&quot;) with the noun &quot;mão&quot; (&quot;hand&quot;) meaning &quot;to play a musical instrument with one&#x27;s hands&quot;, has been suggested as the etymon of &quot;tango&quot;. 

According to some authors, &quot;tango&quot; is derived from the Kongo word &quot;ntangu&quot; which means &quot;sun&quot;, &quot;hour&quot;, &quot;space-time&quot;.

==Styles==

The tango consists of a variety of styles that developed in different regions and eras of Argentina, as well as in other locations around the world. The dance developed in response to many cultural elements, such as the crowding of the venue and even the fashions in clothing. The styles are mostly danced in either open embrace, where lead and follow have space between their bodies, or close embrace, where the lead and follow connect either chest-to-chest (Argentine tango) or in the upper thigh, hip area (American and International tango).

Different styles of tango are:
*Tango argentino
* Tango canyengue
*Tango fantasia
* Tango liso
*Tango oriental
* Tango orillero
*Tango salon
* Tango camacupense (Angola)
* Tango milonguero (tango apilado) (see also &quot;Milonguero&quot;)
* Tango nuevo (new tango)
* Tango vals (Tango waltz)
*Milonga
* Ballroom tango
* Finnish tango
*Uruguayan tango
*Maxixe (Brazilian tango)
These are danced to several types of music:
* Tango
* Electronic tango-inspired music (Tango electronico)
* &quot;Alternative tango&quot;, i.e. music that is an alternative to tango, or non-tango music employed for use in tango-inspired dance

The milonguero style is characterized by a very close embrace, small steps, and syncopated rhythmic footwork. It is based on the or style of the crowded downtown clubs of the 1950s.

In contrast, the tango that originated in the family clubs of the suburban neighborhoods (Villa Urquiza/Devoto/Avellaneda etc.) emphasizes long elegant steps, and complex figures. In this case the embrace may be allowed to open briefly, to permit the execution of the complex footwork.

The complex figures of this style became the basis for a theatrical performance style of tango seen in the touring stage shows. For stage purposes, the embrace is often open, and the complex footwork is augmented with gymnastic lifts, kicks, and drops.

A newer style sometimes called &quot;tango nuevo&quot; or &#x27;new tango&#x27; has been popularized in recent years by a younger generation of dancers. The embrace is often quite open and very elastic, permitting the leader to lead a large variety of very complex figures. This style is often associated with those who enjoy dancing to jazz- and techno-tinged &quot;alternative tango&quot; music, in addition to traditional tango compositions.

===Tango de salon (salon tango)===
===Tango canyengue===

&quot;Tango canyengue&quot; is a rhythmic style of tango that originated in the early 1900s and is still popular today. It is one of the original roots styles of tango and contains all fundamental elements of traditional Tango from the River Plate region (Uruguay and Argentina). In &quot;tango canyengue&quot; the dancers share one axis, dance in a closed embrace, and with the legs relaxed and slightly bent. &quot;Tango canyengue&quot; uses body dissociation for the leading, walking with firm ground contact, and a permanent combination of on- and off-beat rhythm. Its main characteristics are its musicality and playfulness. Its rhythm is described as &quot;incisive, exciting, provocative&quot;.

The complex figures of this style became the basis for a theatrical performance style of Tango seen in the touring stage shows. For stage purposes, the embrace is often very open, and the complex footwork is augmented with gymnastic lifts, kicks, and drops.

===Tango nuevo===
A newer style sometimes called &quot;tango nuevo&quot; or &#x27;new tango&#x27; was popularized after 1980 by a younger generation of musicians and dancers. Ástor Piazzolla, composer and virtuoso of the bandoneón (so-called &quot;tango accordion&quot;) played a major role in the innovation of traditional tango music. The embrace is often quite open and very elastic, permitting the leader to initiate a great variety of very complex figures. This style is often associated with those who enjoy dancing to jazz- and techno-tinged, electronic and alternative music inspired in old tangos, in addition to traditional Tango compositions.

&quot;Tango nuevo&quot; is largely fueled by a fusion between tango music and electronica (), though the style can be adapted to traditional tango and even non-tango songs. Gotan Project released its first tango fusion album in 2000, quickly following with La Revancha del Tango in 2001. Bajofondo Tango Club, a Rioplatense music band consisting of seven musicians from Argentina and Uruguay, released their first album in 2002. Tanghetto&#x27;s album &quot;Emigrante (electrotango)&quot; appeared in 2003 and was nominated for a Latin Grammy in 2004. These and other electronic tango fusion songs bring an element of revitalization to the tango dance, serving to attract a younger group of dancers.

=== New tango songs ===

In the second half of the 1990s, a movement of new tango songs was born in Buenos Aires. It was mainly influenced by the old orchestra style rather than by Piazzolla&#x27;s renewal and experiments with electronic music. The novelty lies in the new songs, with today&#x27;s lyrics and language, which find inspiration in a wide variety of contemporary styles.

In the 2000s, the movement grew with prominent figures such as the Orquesta Típica Fernandez Fierro, whose creator, Julian Peralta, would later start Astillero and the Orquesta Típica Julián Peralta. Other bands also have become part of the movement such as the Orquesta Rascacielos, Altertango, Ciudad Baigón, as well as singer and songwriters Alfredo &quot;Tape&quot; Rubín, Victoria di Raimondo, Juan Serén, Natalí de Vicenzo and Pacha González.

===Ballroom tango===

Ballroom tango, divided in recent decades into the &quot;International&quot; and &quot;American&quot; styles, has descended from the tango styles that developed when the tango first went abroad to Europe and North America. The dance was simplified, adapted to the preferences of conventional ballroom dancers, and incorporated into the repertoire used in International Ballroom dance competitions. English tango was first codified in October 1922, when it was proposed that it should only be danced to modern tunes, ideally at 30 bars per minute (i.e. 120 beats per minute – assuming a measure).

Subsequently, the English tango evolved mainly as a highly competitive dance, while the American tango evolved as an unjudged social dance with an emphasis on leading and following skills. This has led to some principal distinctions in basic technique and style. Nevertheless, there are quite a few competitions held in the American style, and of course mutual borrowing of technique and dance patterns happens all the time.

Ballroom tangos use different music and styling from the tangos from the River Plata region (Uruguay and Argentina), with more staccato movements and the characteristic &quot;head snaps&quot;. The head snaps are totally foreign to Argentine and Uruguayan tango, and were introduced in 1934 under the influence of a similar movement in the legs and feet of the tango from the River Plate, and the theatrical movements of the pasodoble. This style became very popular in Germany and was soon introduced to England. The movements were very popular with spectators, but not with competition judges.

===Finnish tango===

Tango arrived in Finland in 1913. The tango spread from the dominant urban dance form to become hugely popular across Finland in the 1950s after World War I and World War II. The melancholy tone of the music reflects the themes of Finnish folk poetry; Finnish tango is almost always in a minor key.

The tango is danced in very close full thigh, pelvis and upper body contact in a wide and strong frame, and features smooth horizontal movements that are very strong and determined. Dancers are very low, allowing long steps without any up and down movement, although rises and falls are optional in some styles. Forward steps land heel first except when descending from a rise, and in backward steps dancers push from the heel. In basic steps, the passing leg moves quickly to rest for a moment close to the grounded leg. Dips and rotations are typical. There is no open position, and typically feet stay close to the floor, except in dips the follower might slightly raise the left leg. Unlike in some Argentine-Uruguayan tango styles, in Finnish tango there is no kicking of any kind, and there are no aerials.

The annual Finnish tango festival &quot;Tangomarkkinat&quot; draws over 100,000 tango fans to the central Finnish town of Seinäjoki; the town also hosts the Tango Museum.

==Comparison of techniques==

Argentine-Uruguayan and ballroom tango use very different techniques. In Argentine and Uruguayan tango, the body&#x27;s center moves first, then the feet reach to support it. In ballroom tango, the body is initially set in motion across the floor through the flexing of the lower joints (hip, knee, ankle) while the feet are delayed, then the feet move quickly to catch the body, resulting in snatching or striking action that reflects the staccato nature of this style&#x27;s preferred music.

In tango, the steps are typically more gliding, but can vary widely in timing, speed, and character, and follow no single specific rhythm. Because the dance is led and followed at the level of individual steps, these variations can occur from one step to the next. This allows the dancers to vary the dance from moment to moment to match the music (which often has both legato and/or staccato elements) and their mood.

The Tango&#x27;s frame, called an &quot;abrazo&quot; or &quot;embrace&quot;, is not rigid, but flexibly adjusts to different steps, and may vary from being quite close, to offset in a &quot;V&quot; frame, to open. The flexibility is as important as is all movement in dance. The American Ballroom Tango&#x27;s frame is flexible too, but experienced dancers frequently dance in closed position: higher in the elbows, tone in the arms and constant connection through the body. When dancing socially with beginners, however, it may be better to use a more open position because the close position is too intimate for them. In American Tango open position may result in open breaks, pivots, and turns which are quite foreign in Argentine tango and International (English) tango.

There is a closed position as in other types of ballroom dance, but it differs significantly between types of tango. In Tango from the River Plata region, the &quot;close embrace&quot; involves continuous contact at the full upper body, but not the legs. In American Ballroom tango, the &quot;close embrace&quot; involves close contact in the pelvis or upper thighs, but not the upper body. Followers are instructed to thrust their hips forward, but pull their upper body away and shyly look over their left shoulder when they are led into a &quot;corte&quot;.

In tango from the River Plate region, the open position, the legs may be intertwined and hooked together, in the style of Pulpo (the Octopus). In Pulpo&#x27;s style, these hooks are not sharp, but smooth ganchos.

In tango from the River Plate, the ball or toe of the foot may be placed first. Alternatively, the dancer may take the floor with the entire foot in a cat-like manner. In the international style of tango, &quot;heel leads&quot; (stepping first onto the heel, then the whole foot) are used for forward steps.

Ballroom tango steps stay close to the floor, while the River Plate tango (Uruguayan and Argentine) includes moves such as the &quot;boleo&quot; (allowing momentum to carry one&#x27;s leg into the air) and &quot;gancho&quot; (hooking one&#x27;s leg around one&#x27;s partner&#x27;s leg or body) in which the feet travel off the ground. Both Uruguayan and Argentine tango features other vocabulary foreign to ballroom, such as the &quot;parada&quot; (in which the leader puts his foot against the follower&#x27;s foot), the &quot;arrastre&quot; (in which the leader appears to drag or be dragged by the follower&#x27;s foot), and several kinds of &quot;sacada&quot; (in which the leader displaces the follower&#x27;s leg by stepping into her space).

==Famous tango singers==

*Carlos Acuña (1915–1999) was known for his deep, high and expressive voice. His foreign travels brought him success in Uruguay, Mexico, Italy and Spain, where he became a close friend of the exiled Juan Perón.
*Néstor Fabián
*Carlos Gardel
*Roberto Goyeneche 
*Julio Sosa (1926–1964) from Uruguay was one of the most important tango singers during tango&#x27;s unhappy years in the 1950s and early 1960s. His passion for poetry led to his sole published book; his passion for fast cars led to his young death.
*Olavi Virta
*Reijo Taipale
*Eino Grön
*Tita Merello
*Edmundo Rivero
*Pyotr Leschenko

==Tango influence==

Music and dance elements of tango are popular in activities related to gymnastics, figure skating, synchronized swimming, etc., because of its dramatic feeling and its cultural associations with romance.

For the 1978 FIFA World Cup in Argentina, Adidas designed a ball and named it Tango, likely a tribute to the host country of the event. This design was also used in 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain as &quot;Tango Málaga&quot;, and in 1984 and 1988 UEFA European Football Championships in France and West Germany.

==In society==

Tango appears in different aspects of society: regular milongas and special festivals. A very famous festival is the Tango Buenos Aires Festival y Mundial in Buenos Aires also known as World tango dance tournament. On a regional level there are also many festivals inside and outside of Argentina. One local festival outside Argentina is Buenos Aires in the Southern Highlands in Australia.

== Gender and tango ==

Gender roles play a big part in the mechanics of tango due to the tango needing a leader. But in more recent times this is being challenged due to woman not wanting to be dependent on the male for the dance. In the early 1900s, there were often more male dancers than female so the dance was performed between two men. This allowed for both men to learn the leading and following roles of tango and adapt to both lead equally in the dance. This changed the mechanics of the dance to be closer to two equally leading roles between men and women or same sex pairs.

A Queer Tango movement has emerged from the first Queer Tango Festival, held in Hamburg in 2001, to counter conformity to the traditional male-leader, female-follower convention.

<doc id="262756" wikidata="Q4346256" url="?curid=262756" title="Tango (drink)">
<text>Tango is a carbonated soft drink originating in the United Kingdom, primarily sold in the UK and Ireland. It was first launched by Corona in 1950. Corona was purchased by the Beecham Group in 1958, and Corona Soft Drinks by Britvic in 1987.

, the flavours available in the United Kingdom include Orange, Apple, Cherry and Mango in addition to flavours of the &quot;Tango Ice Blast&quot; slush range. On 7 April 2021, the UK range was extended to include sugar free Dark Berry. Tango is known in the United Kingdom for their advertisements, mostly those broadcast on television in the 1990s from the Howell Henry Chaldecott Lury advertising agency.

==Logos and packaging==
The first packaging that Britvic introduced, upon buying the brand in 1987, featured the word &#x27;Tango&#x27; on a circle with an orange background. In 1989, the cast, material and graphic design of the can changed considerably. No longer moulded in the shape of a baked bean can in steel, Tango was now available in a aluminium, with an innovative new ring pull system. On the can itself, the word &#x27;Tango&#x27; was featured inside an oval on a backdrop of half sliced oranges.
The design was often seen on display in the form of laminated stickers, in the shop windows of confectionery stores and newsagents. 1992 saw the packaging change again, with the &#x27;Tango&#x27; logo depicted on the fruit the drink was flavoured with against a black background, with the flavour specified at the bottom.

In the beginning of 1996, Tango packaging changed again, with the words &#x27;Tango&#x27; and the respective flavour written on something representing the drink (for example, an orange explosion for Tango Orange). Slight changes were made in 1997, adding more detail. In April 2002, another revamp occurred, with a more three dimensional logo. The design was dropped in 2007, although is still used by Tango Ice Blast. The Diet Tango Orange products from this era featured a grey background instead of a black one.

The summer of 2007 saw a much simpler logo and design, featuring the &#x27;Tango&#x27; logo on top of a carved version of the fruit, with the flavour written in lower case at the bottom. Intended to help restore sales of Tango, it actually led to a further decline. May 2009 saw new packaging created by &quot;Blue Marlin Brand Design&quot;. It featured mashed up images of fruit and graffiti style type, and contributed to a rise in sales.

For limited edition variations of Tango, special packaging has sometimes been produced for them. Notably, the &#x27;Tango Talk&#x27; rebrand of Tango Orange and Tango Apple featured a mobile phone in place of the flavour representation featured on regular versions of the flavours at the time. The 2009 larger can packaging of Tango Orange known as &quot;Tango with Added Tango Orange&quot; featured more oranges in the background. The same can be said for the 2010 &quot;King Tango&quot; Tango Orange bottles. More apples were used on the label for King Tango Apple and more cherries for King Tango Cherry. No changes to flavour was made only the size of the can or bottle.

The labelling of the short lived Tango Strange Soda featured a &quot;strange&quot; fruit with facial features, patterned after the name and flavour of the drink. &quot;Tango Orange Sound System: Official Can&quot;, a 2010 repackaging of the notably large &quot;Tango with Added Tango Orange&quot; featured speakers on the can, in place of the mashed-up fruit. Both these large cans were advertised as &quot;the first time Tango cans are larger&quot;. This is not true, as from 1991 until roughly 2000, all Tango flavours could be purchased in similar size larger cans. The large cans, at the initial 1991 launch, were called &quot;King-Size&quot;.

During 2000, short lived 250ml bottles of Tango were introduced as part of a £42m campaign by Britvic, to market their drinks as being suitable for children&#x27;s lunch boxes. The campaign also introduced the popular Robinson&#x27;s line of juice drinks Fruit Shoot.

Tango Cherry and Tango Lemon were first to feature the revamp of 2002, getting the treatment in September 2001.

==Flavours and variants==
In addition to orange, Tango has been sold in numerous flavours.

===Standard===
===Sugar-Free===
===Still Tango===
Still Tango was a selection of juice drinks, initially sold in Orange flavour.

The drink&#x27;s launch in June 1994 proved to be a disaster following reports of the drink fermenting on store shelves, leading to Britvic re-calling over a million bottles of the product.

The drink was relaunched in September 1995, with an advertising campaign focusing on a single newsagent in Dorking, Surrey. A fellow television advertising campaign in 1996 showcased the failed attempt at the drink&#x27;s launch. and in May 1996, Apple, Lemon and Blackcurrant variants were introduced.

===Tango Strange Soda===
Tango Strange Soda was a sub-brand that consisted of juice and milk-based drinks, being available in &quot;Strange Strawberry&quot; and &quot;Odd Orange&quot; flavours and had targeted the children and teenager market. The drink was put into development in 2000 and was initially announced as Freekin&#x27; Soda in Late-2002 for a release within the start of 2003, but was pulled following concerns about the brand&#x27;s name being unsuitable for the brand&#x27;s target audience of children and teenagers, and the word &quot;Freekin&quot; being linked as a milder alternative to a strong profanity, which would have made the drink unsuitable to be marketed on children&#x27;s television channels at any time or any networks prior to the 9 pm Watershed.

The drink was eventually introduced under the modified name of Freekee Soda in February 2003; but suffered from low sales throughout its run. Due to a legal complaint over the trademark of the brand name and the initial low sales, it was relaunched under the Tango brand as Tango Strange Soda in September 2003.

Despite this move and a reduction of pricing, the drink continued to suffer from very low sales until Britvic announced the product&#x27;s discontinuation in January 2004.

===Tango Ice Blast===
Tango Ice Blast is a Slushie drink originally introduced in 2004. It is produced by Frozen Brothers (previously by Slush Puppie), under license from Britvic.

* Tropical
* Strawberry &amp; Kiwi

====Summer Flavour Festival (2016)====

* Punchy Peach and Passionfruit

===Tango Clear===
Tango Clear was a brand of no-calorie clear drinks introduced in April 2005. It was another attempt by Britvic to increase sales of the Tango brand and was aimed at the young female market.

The Drink was initially introduced in Apple and Watermelon and Lemon and Kiwi flavours, and in 2006, the brand was expanded with two more flavours - Raspberry and White Cranberry, and Orange.

Tango Clear was discontinued in September 2007, after Britvic announced that they would strictly focus the Tango brand on its core flavours.

===Other products===
As well as drinks, the brand have also sold two different chocolate bars, chewy ball sweets and car air fresheners.

In October 2000, Cadbury announced they would team up with Britvic to create a limited edition Tango Orange-flavoured Crunchie.

In July 2011, Turbo Tango, when launched, was described as the &quot;first aerosol drink&quot;.

During 2011, several flavours of Chew Stick and Chewy Bonbons were introduced. In January 2013, a Tango branded shower gel was launched. A Tango branded hand soap was also launched around the same time.

==Advertising==
Beginning in the late 1980s, surrealism was becoming a mainstream technique in advertising. Answering Tango&#x27;s search for a new ad campaign, ad agency HHCL created the catchphrase &quot;You know when you&#x27;ve been Tango&#x27;d&quot;. The campaign began in 1992 with the advert &quot;Orange Man&quot;; it featured a man drinking Tango and immediately being slapped around the face by a portly man painted orange (Peter Geeves). The advert received widespread condemnation after a craze for &quot;Tangoing&quot; people swept the nation&#x27;s playgrounds, and there were reports of children receiving serious injuries, or even being deafened by being slapped on the ears.

Tango voluntarily replaced the &quot;slapping&quot; advert with an almost identical new version, where the orange clad person kisses the man instead of hitting him. The original version was ranked third in a list of &quot;The 100 Greatest TV Ads&quot;, in a 2000 poll conducted by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; and Channel 4.

Most subsequent Tango advertisements have avoided showing violence, except for the advert from October 2004, &quot;Pipes&quot;, which showed a man rolling down a hill with concrete pipes, causing it to be banned, and the advert from March 1997, &quot;Vote Orange Now&quot;, where the orange clad man made another appearance, slapping the advert&#x27;s protagonist several times. This latter advert was featured in the first advert break on Channel 5.

In March 2000, an advert originally produced in 1998, which depicted a pre-fame James Corden being bullied for not drinking Tango, was banned because it was seen as encouraging the bullying of overweight children. The replacement was a satirically inoffensive advert, &quot;Drink Tango: It&#x27;s Nice&quot;.

During August 1999, Tango teamed up with the newspapers &quot;Daily Mail&quot; and &quot;Daily Record&quot; to extend their summer peak sales period in a campaign called &quot;Tango Time&quot;. The main thread of the campaign activity was a competition where a time of day is printed on the base of cans of Tango. The winning &#x27;Tango Time&#x27; was published in the Daily Mirror and Daily Record and winners invited to call a prize claim line. The newspaper adverts were trailed by branding on the front page, including a free offer for a bottle of Tango. The adverts containing the winning &#x27;Tango Time&#x27; ran for twenty six days in August 1999.

Tango Apple has often been subject to experimental advertising including an &quot;Apple Tango Calendar&quot; given free in June 1996 with the &quot;Daily Star&quot; and, in 2003, the &quot;Big Drench Tour&quot;, a roadshow of a thirty foot tall apple shaped installation filled with water. Players must stand underneath and take part in a game of &#x27;drench roulette&#x27; to win prizes.

Later that year, as Tango Strange Soda launched, three ultimately unsuccessful advertisements for the drink (&quot;Taste Buds&quot;, &quot;Trainers&quot; and &quot;Classroom&quot;) were aired featuring a man&#x27;s &quot;taste buddies&quot; which are a group of young men behaving as the man&#x27;s taste buds that vibrate rapidly when the man consumes Strange Soda. The &quot;taste buddy&quot; actors in the advertisements were shot as live action, with the actor standing on a moveable circular frame which was then manoeuvred via a handle to give the &quot;vibrating&quot; trembling effect for each of the &quot;buddies&quot; seen on screen.

In August 2009, a billboard campaign extolled the &quot;weird and wonderful&quot; side effects of drinking too much &quot;Tango with added Tango Orange&quot; (such as &quot;Too much Tango made me suck a bull&#x27;s udder&quot;). The British press pointed out that the initials of &quot;Tango With Added Tango&quot; spelled the insult &quot;twat&quot; when read vertically, and this was later revealed to be intentional.

Tango advertisements have sometimes featured phone numbers for viewers to call, although the phone numbers would typically appear too briefly on the screen for viewers to type in the number or write it down. Many of these advertisements incorporate a send-away prize, including a rubber doll or a clown horn (the Tango Horn).

A notable exception was an advert which first premièred in 1993 for Still Tango disguised as a subvert falsely alerting people that the drink is unauthorised, and features a phone number for &#x27;affected&#x27; viewers to call. Tango sponsored the television show &quot;The Word&quot; in 1994 and the Underage Festival in 2010. Historically, slogans have included &quot;You Taste the Tang in Tango Every Sparkling Sip You Take&quot; in the 1960s and &quot;The Whole Fruit&quot; in the late 1980s.

===Blackcurrant Tango===

Blackcurrant Tango is notable for the multiple award-winning television commercial from 1997, St George, which was used to promote it.

For the launch of Blackcurrant Tango in 1996, HHCL produced the &quot;St. George&quot; television and cinema advertisement. In the advertisement, a member of Tango&#x27;s customer service staff, Ray Gardner, provides a response to a letter of complaint about the flavour of Blackcurrant Tango he has received from Sebastien Loyes, a French exchange student. The letter prompts an increasingly jingoistic tirade during which Ray Gardner removes his suit to reveal bright purple boxing shorts. In one seemingly continuous take, he walks from his office, marches out of Tango&#x27;s building, and is joined by a flag waving crowd as he enters a boxing ring.

As the camera pulls back, the ring is revealed to be perched on the edge of the White Cliffs of Dover. As the camera circles, Gardner can be heard shouting, &quot;Come on France, Europe, the world. I&#x27;ll take you all on! I&#x27;m Ray Gardner. I drink Blackcurrant Tango. Come and get me!&quot; whilst three Harrier jump jets with purple landing lights hover in the background.

The advertisement was notable for the use of digital editing to seamlessly merge a number of tracking shots, including the final transition from a sky camera to a helicopter shot. Ray Gardner later won the ITV &quot;Best Actor in a Commercial&quot; award for his performance. The commercial was voted the Best Long Commercial (1956–2001), by the United Kingdom&#x27;s Film4 television channel in June 2007. The song that appeared in the advertisement, &quot;Don&#x27;t You Want Me&quot; by Felix, was rereleased with Tango branding.

==Recalls==
On 25 August 2005, over 100,000 cans of Tango Cherry and Tango Fruit Fling were recalled over fears they could explode due to an ingredient in the drink.

<text>ʿAbd al-Raḥmān al-Ṣūfī (; 7 December 90325 May 986) was a Persian astronomer. His work &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Book of Fixed Stars&quot;), written in 964, included both textual descriptions and illustrations. The Persian polymath Al-Biruni wrote that al-Ṣūfī&#x27;s work on the ecliptic was carried out in Shiraz. Al-Ṣūfī lived at the Buyid court in Isfahan.

==Biography==
ʿAbd al-Rahmān al-Ṣūfī (full name: Abū’l-Ḥusayn ʿAbd al-Raḥmān ibn ʿUmar ibn Sahl al-Ṣūfī al-Rāzī) was one of the nine famous Muslim astronomers. He lived at the court of Emir &#x27;Adud al-Dawla in Isfahan, and worked on translating and expanding ancient Greek astronomical works, especially the &quot;Almagest&quot; of Ptolemy. He made corrections to Ptolemy&#x27;s star list, and his estimations of star brightness and magnitude deviated from those by Ptolemy; just over half of al-Ṣūfī&#x27;s magnitudes being identical to Ptolemy&#x27;s. A Persian, al-Ṣūfī wrote in Arabic, the lingua franca of the scientific Muslim world.

Al-Ṣūfī was a major contributor to the translation into Arabic of the Hellenistic astronomy that had been centered in Alexandria, Egypt. His was the first to attempt to relate the Greek with the traditional Arabic star names and constellations, which were completely unrelated and overlapped in complicated ways.

==Astronomy==
Al-Ṣūfī made his astronomical observations at a latitude of 32.7N° in Isfahan. It has been claimed that he identified the Large Magellanic Cloud, but this seems to be a misunderstanding of a reference to some stars south of Canopus which he admits he has not seen. He also made the earliest recorded observation of the Andromeda Galaxy in 964, describing it as a &quot;small cloud&quot;. This was the first galaxy other than the Milky Way to be mentioned in writing.

=== Astrolabe ===
Al-Ṣūfī also wrote about the astrolabe, finding numerous additional uses for it: According to American Near Eastern scholar Adam L. Bean, Al-Ṣūfī&#x27;s work reportedly described over 1000 different uses in areas as diverse as astronomy, astrology, horoscopes, navigation, surveying, timekeeping, Qibla and Salat prayer.

===&quot;&quot; (&quot;&quot;The Book of Fixed Stars&quot;)===
Al-Ṣūfī published &quot;&quot; (&quot;The Book of Fixed Stars&quot;&quot;) in 964, and dedicated it to Adud al-Dawla, the ruler of Buwayhid at the time. This book describes 48 constellations and the stars within them.

Al-Ṣūfī compared Greek constellations and stars as described in Ptolemy’s &quot;Almagest&quot; with Arabic ones, linking those that were the same. He included two illustrations of each constellation, one showing the orientation of the stars from the perspective outside the celestial globe, and the other from the perspective of looking at the sky while standing on the Earth. He separated them into three groups; 21 seen from the north, 15 seen from the south, and the 12 zodiac constellations. He included a complete set of star charts, that included the names and numbers of the individual stars in each of the 48 constellations, and each star&#x27;s longitudinal and latitudinal coordinates, magnitude, and location north or south of the ecliptic. 

Scribal errors within the 35 surviving copies of &quot;The Book of Fixed Stars&quot; have caused the value of the magnitude for a particular star to vary from manuscript to manuscript. Al-Ṣūfī organized the stars in each of his drawings into two groups: those that form the image depicted, and others that are in close proximity to the image. He identified and described stars not included by Ptolemy, but he did not include them in his own star charts. Stating that his charts were modelled after Ptolemy, he left the stars excluded in Ptolemy&#x27;s catalogue out of his charts as well.

To allow for the longitudinal placement of the stars within constellations having changed over the eight centuries since the &quot;Almagest&quot; was written, Al-Ṣūfī added 12° 42&#x27; to all the longitudes values provided by Ptolemy. Al-Ṣūfī differed from Ptolemy by having a three level scale to measure the magnitude of stars instead of a two level scale. This extra level increased the precision of his measurements. His methodology for determining these magnitude measurements cannot be found in any of his extant texts.

Despite the importance of &quot;The Book of Fixed Stars&quot; in the history of astronomy, it took more than 1000 years until the first partial English translation of the book was published in 2010.

==Legacy==

Al-Ṣūfī&#x27;s astronomical work was subsequently used by many other astronomers, including Ulugh Beg who was both a prince and astronomer.

The lunar crater Azophi and the minor planet 12621 Alsufi are named after Al-Ṣūfī.

The Astronomy Society of Iran – Amateur Committee has held international Sufi Observing Competitions in memory of the astronomer. The first competition was held in 2006 in the north of Semnan Province, and the second was held in the summer of 2008 in Ladiz near the Zahedan. More than 100 attendees from Iran and Iraq participated in these events.

Google Doodle commemorated Al-Ṣūfī&#x27;s 1113th birthday on 7 December 2016.

<doc id="262761" wikidata="Q1547792" url="?curid=262761" title="Self-bondage">
<text>Self-bondage refers to the use of restraints on oneself for erotic pleasure. It is a form of erotic bondage which can be practiced alone.

Self-bondage is characterized by experimentation and ingenuity, and can be riskier than conventional bondage. Self-bondage requires use of techniques for self-binding as movement becomes increasingly restricted as more restraints are applied, and also requires a reliable release mechanism. Many types of bondage equipment can be applied before the one that restrains the hands. For example, leg irons can be applied, as well as gags, blindfolds, etc.

For many of its practitioners, the added challenges and dangers are a part of the appeal of self-bondage, who often devise elaborate self-bondage schemes and release mechanisms, both in practice and in erotic fiction.

==Risks==
Self-bondage is considered a higher-risk activity than many other BDSM practices — particularly when combined with autoerotic asphyxia — and has led to a number of recorded deaths. The death in 1994 of Stephen Milligan, the British Conservative MP for Eastleigh, was a case of autoerotic asphyxiation combined with self-bondage.

Self-bondage has all the risks of physical restraint and sexual bondage, with the added factor that should anything go wrong, there is no one to effect a rescue. For example, if blood circulation cuts off sensation in limbs, the planned escape mechanism may not be usable.

==Types==

Self-bondage can be either &quot;strict&quot; or &quot;sensual&quot;.

===Sensual self-bondage===
In sensual self-bondage, escape from restraints is simple and available immediately, if desired. For example, the keys might be within reach or the knots loosely tied. The chief aim is the sensation of immobility and of constrained movement.

===Strict self-bondage===
Strict self-bondage requires that the means of escape be unavailable until the lapse of time before the release mechanism activates itself. This feature of strict self-bondage makes it potentially more hazardous, but some practice it for the greater sense of helplessness it creates.

===Emergency intervention===
A compromise position between safety and strictness allows for a backup release mechanism that is available immediately, but carries with it some penalty or cost with its use. For example, keys could be placed in a bucket of paint. The person in self-bondage can escape quickly if necessary, such as a fire breaking out, or excessive numbness of limbs. However, the annoyance of cleaning up the paint afterwards would coerce the person into waiting for the main release mechanism to come into effect if he or she were merely bored or uncomfortable. Another penalty may be the need to contact somebody, with the penalty being having to explain what has happened.

==Release mechanisms==
Many release mechanisms are used in self-bondage to allow the practitioner to escape the restraints after a period of time. There are various trade-offs to be made between ease of use, reliability, precision of timing, cost, and so forth. There should be several mechanisms available, thus ensuring redundancy and safety.

* &quot;Ice cubes&quot; are commonly used as a release mechanism. For example, a key can be placed in water which is then frozen. The key will not be available until the ice melts. Advantages include simplicity and reliability. The disadvantage is that it can be difficult to gauge precisely how long a scenario will last, although some enjoy the uncertainty.
* &quot;Ice locks&quot; are frozen together and do not move until the ice has melted down. These can be used alone (to lock a person to a stationary object) or in combination with tightening devices (to keep the tension for a certain period of time).
* &quot;Salt locks&quot;: Salt, sugar or any other safe water-soluble substance blocks parts of a lock. It needs to be dissolved in order to release the mechanism.
* &quot;Combination locks&quot; can be used as release mechanisms. These can rely on the time needed to try every possibility for an unknown combination, or they can rely on light in order to see to enter the known combination correctly.
** &quot;Unknown combination&quot;: The idea is that the lock is reset to an unknown combination, then used to lock the bondage in place. The person must find the correct combination by trial and error. A three digit combination lock contains a thousand possibilities. At a second per attempt, this could take up to 16 minutes and 40 seconds, usually less assuming the combination starts with lower numbers. For a four-digit lock, it is nearer two hours. Disadvantages include the fact that it may be distracting to actively &quot;crack&quot; the lock.
** &quot;In darkness&quot;: Even if the number is known, for many locks, it is not possible to enter the combination without being able to see the faces of the dials. This release mechanism relies on darkness. The light can be provided either by the morning sunlight, or, preferably, through a light on a time switch. The advantages include a large amount of control over how long the bondage lasts (with a timer), and a backup of the onset of daylight. The disadvantages are only being able to use the technique at night, and having to perform the bondage in the dark.
* &quot;Electromagnets&quot;: Electromagnets can be used to release keys after a delay. If combined with electronics or a computer, a large amount of control is possible over the timing, and the mechanism is somewhat &quot;fail-safe&quot; — if power fails, the key will fall early. Disadvantages include complexity and cost. The powerful electromagnets used in door locks can also be adapted for use directly as restraints.
* &quot;Soldering irons&quot;: Soldering irons can be used, in conjunction with a timing mechanism, to cut a nylon rope, or to release keys. This may be a fire hazard unless appropriate precautions are taken.
* The use of a delivery/messenger service or regular mail in order to obtain the object (usually key/keys) needed in order to become released. This relies on the delivery service being 100% reliable.

===Emergency backup===
There are also a number of release mechanisms designed to be emergency backups. The idea behind these release mechanisms is that triggering them will cause something undesirable to happen, and thus are only used in situations where death or serious injury could occur otherwise.

* &quot;Paint tin&quot;: A backup key is stored in a bucket of paint, ink or motor oil in such a way that recovering the key will cause the contents of the container to spill, causing costly damage to a carpet or other possessions. This mechanism can be used for extremely quick release in an emergency such as a fire, but can make the situation worse if a flammable liquid is used.
* &quot;Unpleasant drink&quot;: An unpleasant liquid, such as urine (the safety of this is discussed in the article Urophagia), is stored in a container. The key is only released when the contents of the container have been drunk (it should be designed so that the contents can not be spilled). The idea is to make the drink so unpleasant that it will only be considered as a last resort.
* &quot;Rescue&quot;: A friend or relative is notified to come over at a certain time (that time being after the bondage session is planned to end). The friend may or may not be aware of the bondage. An alternative is to position a phone somewhere that is accessible during the bondage, so that a friend or the emergency services may be called if the planned release mechanisms fail.

==Techniques==
Apart from release mechanisms, self-bondage poses a somewhat awkward problem of getting &quot;into&quot; bondage, especially when using rope. What might be a relatively simple matter for more than one person can be considerably more complex alone.

With rope, the main difficulty is tying the hands in a way that is not easy to untie. One common solution is to use a &quot;cinch noose&quot; — essentially a kind of slip knot — together with a &quot;coil&quot; (a loop of rope). The wrists are placed through the coil with the cinch noose between the wrists and around the coil. To achieve a basic hogtie position, the cinch noose is tied to the ankles. With pressure, the noose tightens the wrist coil, securing the hands. It proves very difficult to escape from, and usually a knife or scissors is required to cut free.

Equipment that can be tightened only, and not loosened, often has application in self-bondage. This includes handcuffs, zip ties and ratcheting pulleys.

==Commercial equipment==

While for the most part self-bondage is performed using ordinary and easily available equipment (indeed, it lends itself to impromptu adaptation and a &quot;do it yourself&quot; approach), a few commercial products have appeared — in the United States and United Kingdom for the most part — catering for the self-bondage practitioner.

<text>Chen Yun (, pronounced ; 13 June 1905 – 10 April 1995) was a Chinese revolutionary leader who was one of the most influential leaders of the People&#x27;s Republic of China during the 1980s and 1990s and one of the major architects and important policy makers for the reform and opening up period, alongside Deng Xiaoping. He was also known as Liao Chenyun (), as he took his uncle&#x27;s (Liao Wenguang; ) family name when he was adopted by him after his parents died.

A major Chinese Communist Party (CCP) political figure before the establishment of the PRC, Chen first joined the CCP Central Committee in 1931, and the Politburo in 1934. He became the head of the CCP&#x27;s Organization Department in 1937, and became one of CCP leader Mao Zedong&#x27;s close advisors. He played an important role in the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement of 1942, and started becoming responsible for economic affairs that year, ultimately heading the Central Finance and Economic Commission from 1949.

After the establishment of the PRC, Chen was a key figure in moderating many of Mao&#x27;s radical economic ideas and participated in the drafting of the First five-year plan. Chen was instrumental in China&#x27;s economic reconstruction following the disastrous Great Leap Forward (1958–1960) along with Deng Xiaoping and Zhou Enlai, advocating for a &quot;bird cage&quot; economy in which the market economy should be allowed to play a role but kept contained like a &quot;bird in a cage&quot;. Chen was demoted during the Cultural Revolution though he returned to power after Mao&#x27;s death in 1976.

After Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s rehabilitation, Chen voiced his criticism of Maoist policies, decrying China&#x27;s lack of economic policies, and later became one of the architects of Deng&#x27;s reform and opening up policy. During the 1980s and the 1990s, Chen was regarded as the second-most powerful person in China after Deng and was later recognized as one of the Eight Elders of the Chinese Communist Party. Initially a strong advocate for economic reforms, Chen increasingly became conservative towards the reforms as they progressed, becoming a key figure in slowing many reforms and becoming the leader of CCP&#x27;s conservative factions. Chen resigned from the Central Committee in 1987 though keeping his influence as the chairman of the Central Advisory Committee until 1992, when he fully retired from politics.

== Early life ==
Chen was born in Qingpu, Jiangsu (now part of Shanghai) in 1905. Chen was typesetter for the famous Commercial Press of Shanghai, which printed revolutionary books and even Protestant Bibles. He played a prominent role as a younger organizer in the labor movement during the early and mid-1920s, joining the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1924. Following the May Thirtieth Movement of 1925, Chen was an important organizer under Zhou Enlai and Liu Shaoqi. For a time, Zhou and Yun resided at a Church of Christ in Changting which was the site of a revolutionary committee. After Chiang Kai-shek turned against the CCP in 1927, Chen fled to his hometown, but soon returned to Shanghai and secretly continued his work as a labor unionist.

Chen was one of the few Communist Party organizers from an urban working-class background; he worked underground as a union organizer in the late 1920s, participated in the Long March, and served on the Central Committee from 1931 to 1987. He was active throughout his career in the field of economics, despite receiving no formal education after elementary school.

== Early Communist Party career ==
He served on the Central Committee in the Third Plenary Session of 6th Central Committee of CCP in 1930 and became a member of the Politburo in 1934. In 1933 he evacuated to Ruijin, in Jiangxi province, the headquarters of the CCP&#x27;s main &quot;soviet&quot; area. He was in overall charge of the Party&#x27;s &quot;white areas&quot; work, that is, underground activities in places not under Party control. On the Long March he was one of the four Standing Committee members of the Political Bureau who attended the January 1935 Zunyi Conference. He left the Long March sometime in the spring of 1935, returning to Shanghai, and in September 1935 he went to Moscow, serving as one of the CCP&#x27;s representatives to the Comintern sent by the Fifth Plenum Politburo, although he did not take part in the work of the delegation because he was sent to the Stalingrad Tractor Factory as a punishment for his participation in the Luo Zhanglong faction.

In 1937 Chen returned to China as an adviser to the Xinjiang leader Sheng Shicai. Chen later joined Mao in Yan&#x27;an, probably before the end of 1937. In November 1937 he became director of the Party&#x27;s Organization Department, serving in that capacity until 1944, and by the early 1940s was in the inner circle of Mao&#x27;s advisers. His writings on organization, ideology, and cadre training were included in the important study materials for the Yan&#x27;an Rectification Movement of 1942, a campaign of political persecutions which consolidated Mao&#x27;s power within the Party. During this time, it is known that he protected some comrades accused of being Trotskyites, and criticized the exaggerations of the campaign in the Shandong base area.

Chen&#x27;s economic career began in 1942, when he was replaced by Ren Bishi as head of the CCP Organization Department. In his new position, Chen was assigned responsibility for the financial management of Northwest China. Two years later, he was identified as responsible for finance in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region as well. He added Northeast China to his portfolio in 1946 (then under the overall leadership of General Lin Biao and Political Commissar Peng Zhen).

During the middle of the 1940s, Chen was a major contributor to the party&#x27;s strategy of &quot;economic warfare.&quot; Under this concept, reviving the economy in liberated areas was a major contribution to the revolutionary struggle. Chen argued that economic development and production were critical, explaining that &quot;[o]nly if we can solve the problem of food and clothing for the masses can we become leaders of the masses. Thus, a revolutionary businessman is an outright revolutionary.&quot;

A main challenge for the Communists during this period was driving out the Nationalist&#x27;s competing currency and replacing it with the currencies used in the revolutionary base areas. Chen argued that the approach should rely on both economic and political mechanisms (as opposed to prohibition), including regulating the value of competing currencies and controlling trade in key commodities. Another Chen Yun&#x27;s contribution to the early development of the Chinese economy was his stabilization of prices in Shanghai after the Nationalist government failed to curb the financial crisis caused by speculations of corporate monopolies.

== Political career under Mao ==
In May 1949, Chen Yun was named head of the new national Central Finance and Economic Commission. In July 1948, he was appointed to lead the newly-established Northeastern Financial and Economic Commission. The Northeast Administrative Commission formed the Northeastern Economic Planning Committee (the primary bureaucratic body responsible for economic planning in Manchuria region), with Chen as the Committee&#x27;s head.

In early 1952, Zhou Enlai led a team to draft the first Five-Year Plan which included Chen, Bo Yibo, Li Fuchun and General Nie Rongzhen. Zhou, Chen and Li presented the draft to Soviet experts in Moscow, who rejected it. In early 1953, Gao Gang and the State Planning Commission began work on what would eventually become the final version. After Gao&#x27;s fall, Chen Yun, Bo Yibo, Li Fuchuan and (later) Li Xiannian would manage the Chinese economy for more than 30 years.

=== Economic management ===
During the 1950s and 1960s, Chen was a proponent of more market-oriented economic measures. Looking back, Chen would later believe that it was Mao&#x27;s errors that most kept China from achieving its Five-Year Plans. In 1956, when the 8th National Congress of Chinese Communist Party was held, Chen was elected a vice chairman of the Central Committee. Around that time, both Mao and Chen had come to believe that the economic system, modeled on that of the Soviet Union, was overly centralized, but had different ideas about what to do about it. Chen believed that markets should have a larger economic role but remain subject to a state-controlled plan. Chen used the metaphor of a caged bird to describe the socialist economy. If the cage was too small, the bird would not survive. If the cage was left open, the bird would fly away.

Mao&#x27;s idea, rather, was to devolve powers to provincial and local authorities, which were in practice Party committees rather than state technocrats, and to use mass mobilization rather than either a detailed central plan or the market to promote economic growth. Mao&#x27;s program prevailed, and these policies converged with the rest of the ultimately disastrous Great Leap Forward. By early 1959, the economy was already showing signs of strain. In January of that year, Chen Yun published an article calling for increased Soviet aid. In March, he published a subdued but general critique of the Leap, especially its reliance on mass movement. Economic growth, he asserted, was not simply a matter of speed. It required attention to safe working conditions and quality engineering. It depended on technical skill, not just political awareness.

=== Cultural Revolution ===
Chen fell out of favor with Mao. In the summer of 1959 the Party convened a meeting at the resort town of Lushan to review the policies of the Leap. The Minister of Defense, Marshal Peng Dehuai, attacked the radicalism of the Leap, and Mao took this, or affected to take it, as an attack on himself and his authority. Mao responded with a vicious personal attack on Peng. Peng lost his military positions and the Party undertook a general purge of what Mao termed right opportunism. Further reform of the Leap&#x27;s policies were now out of the question. China continued on its set course for another year or more, and by the end of 1960 had fallen deep into famine.

Chen Yun was certainly in sympathy with Peng Dehuai&#x27;s criticism of the Leap and joined forces with Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping to manage the economy in the post-Great Leap Forward period, which required deft handling of Chairman Mao&#x27;s sensitivity to criticism.

Chen retained his positions as Party vice chairman and member of the Politburo and continued to express his opinions behind the scenes. In 1961 he conducted investigations of the rural areas around Shanghai. According to a Cultural Revolution attack on him by the radical group within the finance system, he reported the peasants as saying: &quot;In the days of Chiang Kai-shek we had rice to eat. In the glorious era of Chairman Mao, we have only gruel.&quot; According to his obituary, Chen was one of the main designers of the economic policies of the 1961-1962 &quot;capitalist road&quot; era, when China&#x27;s economic policy stressed material incentives and sought to encourage economic growth in preference to pursuing ideological goals. This approach is often referred to as Chen&#x27;s &quot;bird-cage&quot; theory of post-Great Leap economic recovery, where the bird represents the free market and the cage represents a central plan. Chen proposed that a balance should be found between &quot;setting the bird free&quot; and choking the bird with a central plan that was too restrictive; this theory would later become a focal point of criticism against Chen during the Cultural Revolution. His only public appearance during this time was a photograph of him published on the front page of the People&#x27;s Daily and other major newspapers on May 1, 1962, showing Chen shaking hands with Chairman Mao, while Liu Shaoqi, Zhou Enlai, Zhu De, and Deng Xiaoping (the entire inner core of leadership of that time, with the exception of Lin Biao) look on. There was no caption or any other explanation.

During the Cultural Revolution, Chen Yun was denounced in Red Guard publications but not in the official press. He was re-elected to the Central Committee in the Ninth Party Congress in April 1969 but not to the Politburo. He no longer held any functional positions. Later that year he was &quot;evacuated&quot; from Beijing, as were many other inactive or disgraced first-generation leaders, as part of a supposed plan preparing against the eventuality of an invasion by the Soviet Union with whom China had a serious split. Chen was put to work in a factory in Nanchang in Jiangxi province, where he stayed for three years. In January 1975, he was elected to the Standing Committee of China&#x27;s legislature, the National People&#x27;s Congress.

== Career during the reform period ==
Following the death of Mao in September 1976 and the coup d&#x27;état against the radical Gang of Four a month later, Chen became increasingly active in the country&#x27;s political life. He and General Wang Zhen petitioned Party chairman Hua Guofeng to rehabilitate Deng Xiaoping at the March 1977 CCP CC Work Conference, but were turned down. After Deng was rehabilitated later that year, Chen led the attack on the Maoist era at the November–December 1978 CCP CC Work Conference, raising the sensitive &quot;six issues&quot;: the purges of Bo Yibo, Tao Zhu, Wang Heshou and Peng Dehuai; the 1976 Tiananmen Incident; and, Kang Sheng&#x27;s errors. Chen raised the six issues in order to undermine Hua and his leftist supporters. Chen&#x27;s intervention tipped the balance in favor of movement toward an open repudiation of the Cultural Revolution and Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s promotion, in December 1978, to de facto head of the regime. Chen laid the basis for Deng&#x27;s &quot;reform and opening&quot; program.

In July 1979, Chen Yun was named head (and Li Xiannian deputy head) of the new national Economic and Financial Commission staffed with his own allies and conservative economic planners. In April and July of that year he made further provocative statements in internal Party meetings, although their authenticity was denied (in an equivocal manner) by official spokesmen. In these Chen deplored China&#x27;s lack of economic progress and the people&#x27;s loss of confidence in the Party. In April he criticized the luxurious life of Party leaders (including himself), and said if he had known in the period before the liberation what the past ten-some years would be like (that is, the Cultural Revolution period), he would have defected to Chiang Kai-shek. He deplored Mao&#x27;s dictatorial ways and implied, although not very strongly, that the Party should take a milder line against dissidents. If &quot;Lin Biao and the Gang of Four; that is, the radical leftists&quot; had been able to assure the people food and clothing, he said, they would not have been so easy to overthrow.

In July, Chen developed these themes in another exposition (which also included some sarcastic observations on the late Chairman&#x27;s taste in literature). Chen said: &quot;We say the old dynasties and the KMT &#x27;ruled&#x27; the country, but talk instead of the &#x27;leadership&#x27; of the Communist Party. But the Party is in fact a ruling party, and if it wishes to keep its position it must also keep the support of the people. It should not float above the masses but should live among them as their servants. Both the welfare of the people and the Party&#x27;s ruling position require that the Party shrink the distance between itself and the people.&quot;

The old dynasties, Chen said, knew the value of a policy of yielding or retreating from untenable positions. The Party has to be able to step back from its past practices: in economy, culture, education, science, and ideology. Without compromising the basic principle of socialism, Chen believed that the Party must accommodate, for the time being, co-existence with aspects of capitalism. But all of this, Chen added, must be done carefully: otherwise China would be in danger of abandoning socialism and restoring capitalism. These pronouncements presaged the major reorientation of Chinese communism in the reform movement.

===Role in promoting economic reform===

Though Deng Xiaoping is credited as the architect of modern China&#x27;s economic reforms, Chen Yun contributed much to the strategy adopted by Deng, and Chen was more directly involved in the details of its planning and construction. A key feature of the reform was to use the market to allocate resources, within the scope of an overall plan. The reforms of the early 1980s were, in effect, the implementation, finally, of the program Chen had outlined in the mid-1950s. Chen called this the &quot;birdcage economy&quot;. According to Chen, &quot;the cage is the plan, and it may be large or small. But within the cage the bird [the economy] is free to fly as he wishes.&quot;

In 1981 a rival &quot;Financial and Economic Leading Group&quot; was established under Zhao Ziyang and staffed by a balanced mix of economic planners. In 1982 Chen Yun, who was 77 years old, stepped down from the Politburo and Central Committee and served as Chairman of the new Central Advisory Commission, an institution set up to provide a place for leadership of the founding generation to remain involved in public affairs.

During the 1980s, Chen was very much involved in policy discussions. In the beginning and as one of the major architects for the reform and opening up, he supported Deng and the liberal market reforms that had been so successful in agriculture to urban areas and the industrial sector. Moreover, he still posited for the state to retain an active role in market development and planning, a policy that would influence future generations of leadership, including Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao, and Xi Jinping. He played an active role in the &quot;Anti-Spiritual Pollution Campaign&quot; organised in late 1983, to help safeguard China&#x27;s political status quo and domestic stability.

Chen Yun was widely admired and respected for striking a balance between excessive laissez faire capitalism and retaining state leadership in guiding China&#x27;s market economy. Deng and Chen&#x27;s reforms and foresight helped make generations of Chinese become richer since the days of Mao&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, as well as propel China into becoming one of the top economies in the world (number one by PPP and number two by nominal GDP).

===Late opponent of reform===
Chen was not, in principle, opposed to the scope of Deng&#x27;s reforms; China&#x27;s economic policy had effectively frozen consumer prices for decades, to the point that prices in China no longer had much relationship to the relative value of resources, goods, or services. Chen objected to the way in which the urban reforms were carried out. The immediate consequence of Deng&#x27;s price reforms was a sudden and massive inflation, unprecedented in the experience of the younger generation and particularly frightening to older folks who could still remember the rampant inflation in the last years of the Nationalist regime. The increasing circulation of money in the economy, together with a hybrid system in which those in official positions or with official connections were particularly well-placed to take advantage of the new opportunities to make a profit, encouraged official corruption. Chen Yun also fought against corruption and harshly cracked down on corrupt officials.

The government&#x27;s first response to inflation was to issue bonuses to workers in state-owned enterprises, to help make up for the price increases. Chen Yun argued that, if there were to be such bonuses, they should be gauged to increased productivity. In practice, the bonuses were universal throughout the state sector and had the same economic effect as if the government had simply printed more money. Because Chinese farmers were not eligible for bonuses since they were not technically state employees, China&#x27;s agricultural sector, which had prospered in the first stage of the reform, was especially damaged by inflation.

Chen&#x27;s theory had been that the market should supplement the plan. In the context of radical Maoism this made him seem like a social democratic proponent of market socialism. It turned out, however, that Chen meant exactly what he had said. He was much less enthusiastic about the market than Deng Xiaoping and Deng&#x27;s younger colleagues. Although in his &quot;secret&quot; pronouncements of 1979 Chen had shown an unusual personal disdain for Mao, he also indicated he shared the late Chairman&#x27;s worries that China would abandon socialism and revert to capitalism. Chen was skeptical regarding the special economic zones (SEZ), viewing them as a non-socialist experiment. Chen viewed the development of a socialist market economy as unscientific and unrealistic.

During the 1980s Chen emerged as the main figure among the more hard-line opponents of reform. He supported the vigorous campaign in the early 1980s against the &quot;three kinds of people&quot;, a general purge of all those who had been identified with radical factions during the Cultural Revolution. He made common cause with conservatives among other Party elders. During the reform era Chen refused to meet with foreigners. Chen never visited the new SEZs. In a memorial tribute to Li Xiannian, an old colleague from the economic system (and, like Chen, one of the few real proletarians among the first generation of Party leaders), Chen stated that he was not necessarily opposed to everything about the SEZs. While Chen became the moral leader of the conservative opposition to Deng Xiaoping, he did not challenge Deng&#x27;s personal primacy as head of regime.

Although Zhao Ziyang&#x27;s promotion of political and economic reform made Zhao one of Chen&#x27;s main political rivals, Chen was one of the Party elders active in the 1980s who Zhao respected most. In Zhao&#x27;s autobiography, Chen was one of the few elders who Zhao referred to regularly as a &quot;comrade&quot;. Before implementing new policies, Zhao made a habit of visiting Chen, in order to solicit Chen&#x27;s advice and attempt to gain Chen&#x27;s approval. In the event that Zhao failed to gain Chen&#x27;s approval, Zhao would then normally attempt to fall back on the favor of Deng Xiaoping in order to promote reforms.

=== Tiananmen Square protests ===
In 1989, Chen, alongside Deng Xiaoping, Li Peng, and others, was among the Party elders responsible for making the key decisions concerning the student-led Tiananmen Square protests. There is no evidence that Chen indulged in diatribes against the students or actively advocated their violent repression. While Chen was opposed to the violent suppression of the students, he gave his support to the military once the action had begun. Chen agreed that Zhao Ziyang should be replaced as the formal head of the Party, and he endorsed Li Xiannian&#x27;s nomination of Jiang Zemin as the new Party General Secretary.

== Retirement and death ==
After the 13th Party Congress in November 1987, Chen ended his 56 year–long political career as a member of the CCP Central Committee, also leaving the Politburo Standing Committee, along with both Deng Xiaoping and Li Xiannian. However, Chen succeeded Deng as the Chairman of the Central Advisory Committee. During Chen&#x27;s term, the Central Advisory Committee has become a leading force of the conservative faction within the Chinese Communist Party.

After the Tiananmen Square incident in June 1989, Chen Yun&#x27;s influence grew within the party due to the removal of reformists Zhao Ziyang and Hu Qili from the Politburo Standing Committee. However, after Deng Xiaoping&#x27;s southern tour in early 1992, Chen Yun and the conservative faction&#x27;s influence within the party waned significantly.

In October 1992 at the age of 87, Chen retired from politics along with other party elders at the 14th Party Congress when the Central Advisory Committee was also abolished.

Chen died in 12 April 1995, at the age of 89. He was cremated at Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery. His official obituary described him as &quot;a great proletarian revolutionary and statesman&quot; and an &quot;outstanding Marxist&quot;.

==Legacy==

Chen Yun was known for his foundational role in spearheading the reform and opening up alongside Deng Xiaoping. During Deng&#x27;s term, Chen Yun was the second most powerful person in China. Chen was praised for implementing many of the reforms that made the new generation of Chinese richer, but was also admired for striking a balance between too much laissez-faire economics and retaining state control over key areas of the market. He was liberal in the beginning, but later more cautious and conservative, especially in his last years. He was widely admired by the Chinese populace, known for his wide-sweeping economic strategic planning, morality and incorruptibility.

Chen&#x27;s political perspective is generally viewed as reformist until about 1980, but conservative after about 1984. Chen Yun remains one of China&#x27;s most powerful and influential leaders, especially in the PRC&#x27;s first 50 years, as he was a central decision-maker for the CCP, serving on the Central Committee and Politburo for over 40 years.

In the beginning, Chen supported Deng, carried out and implemented many of the influential reforms that made a generation of Chinese richer. But later, Chen realized that the state still needed an active iron hand involvement in the market to prevent the private sector from becoming untamable. Chen&#x27;s criticism of Deng&#x27;s later economic reforms was widely influential within the Communist Party and was reflected in the policies of China&#x27;s leaders after Deng. Chen&#x27;s theories supported the efforts of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao to use state power to provide boundaries for the operation of the market, and to mediate the damage that capitalism can do to those who find it difficult to benefit from the free market. Chen&#x27;s notion of the CCP as a &quot;ruling party&quot; is central to the redefinition of the role of the Party in Jiang Zemin&#x27;s Three Represents. In 2005, on the occasion of the hundredth anniversary of Chen&#x27;s birth, the Party press published, over the course of several weeks, the proceedings of a symposium discussing Chen&#x27;s contributions to CCP history, theory and practice.

Although Chen opposed the Mao regime and opposed some of Deng&#x27;s later policies, Chen was still widely respected as one of the leading elders of the Chinese Communist Party. During the Cultural Revolution, Chen was able to escape political persecution, especially in Mao&#x27;s time, as he carefully avoided challenging the top leadership too much. Whatever the wisdom of his substantive positions, Chen consistently appeared to act on principle rather than for personal advantage, and retained his influence in the party throughout the Mao and Deng eras.

His eldest son, Chen Yuan, is the founding Governor of the China Development Bank and the former Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference.

<text>Operation Latchkey was a series of 38 nuclear tests conducted by the United States in 1966–1967 at the Nevada Test Site. These tests followed the &quot;Operation Flintlock&quot; series and preceded the &quot;Operation Crosstie&quot; series.

==Nuclear tests==
===Persimmon===
Persimmon included a vertical line-of-sight pipe fitted with a fast-acting closure. At the time of detonation, this vacuum pipe provided a pathway for neutrons from the nuclear device to travel to instruments in a tower located above the shot hole. A few seconds after detonation, these instruments and their samples were dragged out of the tower on a sled, before the subsidence crater formed and destroyed the tower.

<doc id="262766" wikidata="Q50684" url="?curid=262766" title="Paramount leader">
<text>Paramount leader () is an informal term for the most important political figure in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC). The paramount leader typically controls the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People&#x27;s Liberation Army (PLA), often holding the titles of CCP General Secretary and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (CMC). The state representative (president) or head of government (premier) are not necessarily paramount leader—under China&#x27;s party-state system, CCP roles are politically more important than state titles.

The paramount leader is not a formal position nor an office unto itself. The term gained prominence during the era of Deng Xiaoping (1978–1989), when he was able to wield political power without holding any official or formally significant party or government positions at any given time (state representative, head of government or leader of the CCP). As the leader of the world&#x27;s largest economy by GDP purchasing power parity (PPP), the second-largest economy by nominal GDP, and a potential superpower, the paramount leader is considered to be one of the world&#x27;s most powerful political figures.

There has been significant overlap between paramount leader status and leadership core status, with a majority but not all of paramount leaders being also leadership cores, though they are separate concepts. The term has been used less frequently to describe Deng&#x27;s successors, Jiang Zemin, Hu Jintao and Xi Jinping, who have all formally held the offices of General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party (party leader), President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (state representative) and Chairman of the Central Military Commission (commander-in-chief). Jiang, Hu and Xi are therefore usually referred to as president in the international scene, the title used by most other republican heads of state. However, Deng&#x27;s successors derive their real power from the post of general secretary, which is the primary position in the Chinese power structure and generally regarded by scholars as the post whose holder can be considered paramount leader. The presidency is a largely ceremonial office according to the Constitution, and the most powerful position in the Chinese political system is the CCP general secretary.

Xi Jinping is the current paramount leader. He is considered to have taken on the role in November 2012, when he became CCP general secretary, rather than in March 2013 when he succeeded Hu Jintao as president.

==History==
Chairman Mao Zedong was the undisputed ruler of Communist China from its beginning in 1949 and held three chairman offices at once: Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party, Chairman of the Central Military Commission and Chairman of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (1954–59), making him the leader of the party, military and state, respectively. Following the Cultural Revolution, a rough consensus emerged within the party, that the worst excesses were caused by lack of checks and balances in the exercise of political power and the resulting &quot;rule of personality&quot; by Mao.

Beginning in the 1980s, the CCP leadership desired to prevent a single leader from rising above the party, as Chairman Mao had done. Accordingly, the post of CCP Chairman was abolished in 1982. Most of its functions were transferred to the revived post of General Secretary. The leadership experimented with a quasi-separation of powers, whereby the offices of general secretary, president and premier were held by different people. In 1985, for example, the CCP General Secretary was Hu Yaobang, the Chinese President was Li Xiannian and the Chinese Premier was Zhao Ziyang. However, Deng Xiaoping was still recognized as the core of the leadership. Both Hu and Zhao fell out of favour in the late 1980s, but Deng was able to retain ultimate political control.

In a discussion with Central Committee members in the lead-up 4th Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee (Jun. 23-24 1989), Deng Xiaoping introduced the concept of the &quot;Core Leader&quot;. In his analysis, despite the existence of figures like Chen Duxiu, Qu Qiubai, Xiang Zhongfa, Li Lisan, and Wang Ming, the Party did not have a proper &quot;Core Leader&quot; until the ascent of Mao Zedong at the Zunyi Conference of 1935. Mao&#x27;s election ushered in the &quot;First Generation&quot; of CCP leadership. As for the second generation, Deng conceded that in retrospect, he had himself been the &quot;Core&quot;, but that he had been constantly planning for the transition to a third generation. For this purpose, he encouraged his audience to rally around Jiang Zemin as the core of the &quot;Third Generation&quot;. Despite Deng formally relinquishing the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission until the 5th Plenum (Nov. 6-9 1989), official histories published by the CCP regard this endorsement, at the 4th Plenum, as the transition from the Deng administration to the Jiang administration.

The paramount leader label has been applied to Deng&#x27;s successors, Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, though it is generally recognized that they did not wield as much power as Deng despite their having held more offices of leadership. There has been a greater emphasis on collective leadership, whereby the top leader is a first among equals style figure, exercising power with the consensus of the CCP Politburo Standing Committee. This was particularly apparent during the tenure of Hu Jintao. Beginning in 1993, Jiang formally held the three offices that made him the head of the party, state, and military:
*General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party: the party leader and the primary position of the state.
*Chairman of the Central Military Commission: Supreme Military Command of the People&#x27;s Liberation Army.
*President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China: the largely ceremonial state representative under the 1982 Constitution.

When Jiang left the offices of General Secretary and President in 2002 and 2003, respectively, he held onto the position of Chairman of the Central Military Commission. Military power had always been an important facet in the exercise of political power in Communist-ruled China and as such holding the top military post meant Jiang retained some formal power. When Jiang stepped down from his formal posts between 2002 and 2004, it was ambiguous who the paramount leader was. Hu Jintao held the same trio of positions during his years in power. Hu transferred all three positions onto his successor Xi Jinping between November 2012, when Xi became CCP General Secretary and Chairman of the Central Military Commission; and March 2013, when Xi became president. Since Xi&#x27;s ascendance to power, two new bodies, the National Security Commission and Central Comprehensively Deepening Reforms Commission, have been established, ostensibly concentrating political power in the paramount leader to a greater degree than anyone since Deng. These bodies were tasked with establishing the general policy direction for national security, as well as economic reform. Both groups are headed by the General Secretary.

<doc id="262770" wikidata="Q545616" url="?curid=262770" title="The Tango Lesson">
<text>The Tango Lesson () is a 1997 drama film written and directed by Sally Potter. It is a semi-autobiographical film starring Potter and Pablo Verón, about Argentinian Tango.

The film, a co-production of Argentina, France, Germany, Netherlands and the United Kingdom, was produced by Christopher Sheppard in Britain and Oscar Kramer in Argentina, and was shot mostly in black and white in Paris and Buenos Aires. The soundtrack includes original recordings of Carlos Gardel&#x27;s &quot;Mi Buenos Aires querido&quot; and Ástor Piazzolla&#x27;s &quot;Libertango&quot;, two of the most iconic tangos in the history of the genre. It also includes an original song written and sung by Potter.

==Synopsis==
Sally, a filmmaker and screenwriter suffering from writer&#x27;s block, is dissatisfied with her film project, a murder mystery called &quot;Rage&quot;, which features the fashion industry. Taking a break, she travels to Paris, where she sees the dancer Pablo (Pablo Verón) performing tango. She becomes obsessed with the dance and offers Pablo a part in her film in exchange for dance lessons. The two become deeply involved as dancers and as lovers. Their emotional intimacy threatens the success of their dancing together. The film explores the conflict between the woman dancer accepting the man&#x27;s lead in the dance, while the man must accept the woman&#x27;s lead in the film. It is a love story and a showcase for Verón&#x27;s dancing.

==Critical reception==
&quot;New York Times&quot; film critic, Janet Maslin, thought the film was rather simple, and wrote,
&quot;Stiffly playing a filmmaker with a growing passion for the tango, [Sally Potter] makes this a handsome, dryly meticulous film with no real fire anywhere beyond its supple dance scenes. The lessons are numbered and cataloged with an obsessive care like that of Peter Greenaway, but this material has little of his corresponding complexity.&quot;

&quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; film critic Roger Ebert discussed in his review the film&#x27;s major goal, writing, &quot;Most dances are for people who are falling in love. The tango is a dance for those who have survived it, and are still a little angry about having their hearts so mishandled. &quot;The Tango Lesson&quot; is a movie for people who understand that difference.&quot;

Edward Guthmann, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; staff critic, lauded the film and the courage of director Potter, and wrote,
&quot;British director Sally Potter stuck her neck out when she made &quot;The Tango Lesson,&quot; a fictionalized account of her relationship with Argentine tango master Pablo Veron...Potter takes what seemed like a recipe for embarrassment and excess and delivers a film that&#x27;s sweet and understated and devoid of diva posturing...[the film is] smoothly directed, nicely written and falters only in the performance that Potter was able to squeeze out of herself while performing her multiple tasks.&quot;Yet, Guthmann says Potter should have cast another actor in her role. He adds,
&quot;It&#x27;s too bad, then, that Potter couldn&#x27;t have figured out a way to use another actress to play herself. She often looks worn out, which makes sense given her offscreen responsibilities but works against her tale of courtship, infatuation and the emotional sparks that fly between two gifted, bullheaded artists.&quot;

<doc id="262772" wikidata="Q786444" url="?curid=262772" title="Autoerotic fatality">
<text>Autoerotic fatalities are accidental deaths that occur during sexual self-stimulation when an apparatus, device or prop that is being employed to enhance pleasure causes the death. Researchers only apply the term to unintentional deaths resulting from solitary sexual activity, not suicide or acts with a partner. The incidence of autoerotic fatalities in Western countries is around 0.5 per million inhabitants each year.

Autoerotic asphyxia is the leading cause. 70 to 80% of autoerotic deaths are caused by hanging, while 10 to 30% are attributed to plastic bags or chemical use. Both of these lead to autoerotic asphyxia. 5 to 10% are related to electrocution, foreign body insertion, overdressing/body wrapping, or another atypical method. Specific causes include the use of chemicals such as amyl nitrite, GHB, or nitrous oxide, and props and tools such as knives, oversized dildos, ligatures or bags for asphyxiation, duct tape, electrical apparatus for shocks, water for self-immersion, fire-making equipment for self-immolation, or sharp, unhygienic or large fetishized objects.

The subject has been treated in two books, &quot;Autoerotic Fatalities&quot; by Hazelwood et al. (1983) and &quot;Autoerotic Asphyxiation: Forensic, Medical, and Social Aspects&quot; by Sheleg et al. (2006).

==Famous cases==
* Peter Anthony Motteux, English author, playwright, translator, publisher and editor of &quot;The Gentleman&#x27;s Journal&quot;, &quot;the first English magazine&quot;, from 1692 to 1694, died from apparent autoerotic asphyxiation in 1718, which is probably the first recorded case.
* Frantisek Kotzwara, composer, died from erotic asphyxiation in 1791.
* Albert Dekker, stage and screen actor, was found dead in his bathroom in 1968 with his body graffitied and a noose around his neck.
* Nigel Tetley ( – 2 February 1972) was a British sailor who was the first person to circumnavigate the world solo in a trimaran. His body was found hanging from a tree in woods near Dover, England. At the coroner&#x27;s inquest, it was revealed that the body had been discovered clothed in lingerie and the hands were bound behind the back. The opinion offered by a pathologist suggested masochistic sexual activity.
* Vaughn Bodē, artist, died from autoerotic asphyxiation in 1975.
* Diane Herceg sued &quot;Hustler&quot; magazine in 1983, accusing it of causing the death of her 14-year-old son, Troy D., who had experimented with autoerotic asphyxia after reading about it in that publication.
* Stephen Milligan, a British politician and Conservative MP for Eastleigh, died from autoerotic asphyxiation combined with self-bondage in 1994.
* Kevin Gilbert, a musician and songwriter, died of apparent autoerotic asphyxiation in 1996.
* David Carradine was found dead on 4 June 2009 from accidental asphyxiation, according to the medical examiner who performed a private autopsy on the actor. His body was found near naked and hanging by a rope in a closet in his hotel room in Thailand, and there was evidence of a recent orgasm; two autopsies were conducted and concluded that his death was not suicide, and the Thai forensic pathologist who examined the body stated that his death may have been due to autoerotic asphyxiation. Two of Carradine&#x27;s ex-wives, Gail Jensen and Marina Anderson, stated publicly that his sexual interests included the practice of self-bondage.

Although Paula Yates contradicted earlier statements she had made by saying during a 1999 interview that Michael Hutchence&#x27;s 1997 death might have been caused by autoerotic asphyxiation, the coronial inquest found it to be suicide due to a combination of depression and intoxication with alcohol and other drugs.

<text>The Shahab-3 (; meaning &quot;Meteor-3&quot;) is a family of liquid-fueled ballistic missiles developed by Iran, under the IRGC, and based upon the North Korean Nodong-1/A and Nodong-B missiles. The Shahab-3 family has a range of 1,000-. It was tested from 1998 to 2003 and added to the military arsenal on 7 July 2003, with an official unveiling by Ayatollah Khamenei on July 20. It has an estimated accuracy of about 2,500m CEP. According to the IAEA, Iran in the early 2000s may have explored various fuzing, arming and firing systems to make the Shahab-3 more capable of reliably delivering a nuclear warhead.

The forerunners to this missile include the Shahab-1 and Shahab-2. Iran&#x27;s Defense Ministry has alternately denied plans to develop a Shahab-4 and admitted that a Shahab-4 program is in development, having claimed it both to be a MRBM and an SLV. Some successors to the Shahab have longer range and are more maneuverable.

Operating under the Sanam Industrial Group (Department 140), which is part of the Defense Industries Organization of Iran, the Shahid Hemmat Industrial Group (SHIG), led the development of the Shahab missile.

In 2019, the US Defense Intelligence Agency described the Shahab 3 as &quot;the mainstay of Iran’s MRBM force&quot;. In June 2017, the US Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center estimated that fewer than 50 launchers were operationally deployed.

Shahab-3 missiles are considered obsolete and are being progressively changed for their more recent upgrades of Shahab family missiles, such as the Ghadr-110H and Emad missile. The US government says that the Shahab-3 is &quot;generally&quot; less accurate than the Fateh-110.

==Shahab-3A==
The range of the Shahab-3A is about or . According to the New York Times, the Shahab-3A was no longer in production as of 2008.

==Shahab-3B==

The Shahab-3B differs from the basic production variant. It has improvements to its guidance system and a warhead with a greater range, a few small changes on the missile body, and a new re-entry vehicle whose terminal guidance system and rocket-nozzle steering method are completely different from the Shahab-3A&#x27;s spin-stabilized re-entry vehicle.

The new re-entry vehicle uses a triconic aeroshell geometry, or &quot;baby bottle&quot; design, which improves the overall lift to drag ratio for the re-entry vehicle. This allows greater range maneuverability, which can result in better precision. The triconic design reduces the overall mass of the warhead from an estimated to .

==Shahab-3C and D==
Little is known about the Shahab-3C and Shahab-3D. From what can be gathered, the missiles have an improved precision, navigation system, and a longer range. The missiles were indigenously developed, and are being mass-produced. In 2008, Iran had a production capacity of 70 units per year.

==History, development and tests==

During the early 1990s Iran began to shift from the acquirement of ballistic missiles to their production through a well documented technological partnership with North Korea, despite its denial by Iranian foreign ministry official Hassan Taherian, in February 1995. The main reason for this transition was to minimalise the effects of sanctions and interdictions posed by the USA, as well as military embargoes and international actions against Iran. According to Seitz and Cordesman, another possible reason was the fact that more capable long-range missiles are necessary for deploying heavy nuclear weapons, and would allow Iran to threaten targets outside the region, intimidate the US and prevent them from taking military action against Iran.

Based on the designs of the North Korean No-Dong medium range ballistic missile, which some analysts suggest was developed with Iranian financial support, Iran manufactured the Shahab-3. And while Iran claimed that its purpose was to deliver conventional payloads, it is more likely that it was meant to carry biological, chemical and nuclear weapons.

=== Timeline ===
In October 1997 Russia commenced training Iranian engineers in missile production, for the Shahab-3 missile system.

Iran has conducted at least six test flights of the Shahab-3. During the first one, in July 1998, the missile reportedly exploded in mid-air during the latter portion of its flight. U.S. officials wondered whether the test was a failure or the explosion was intentional. A second, successful test, using a North Korean engine, took place in July 2000.

In September 2000, Iran conducted a third test, in which the missile reportedly exploded shortly after launch.

In May 2002, Iran conducted another successful test, leading then-Iranian Defense Minister Ali Shamkhani to say the test improved the Shahab-3&#x27;s &quot;power and accuracy&quot;.

Another successful test reportedly occurred in July 2002.

On 7 July 2003, the foreign ministry spokesman said that Iran had completed a final test of the Shahab 3 &quot;a few weeks ago&quot;, that was &quot;the final test before delivering the missile to the armed forces&quot;, according to a &quot;New York Times&quot; report. Additionally, allegations regarding Chinese assistance in resolving the missile&#x27;s final technical issues began to emerge. Shahab-3 missiles were displayed openly in military parades, production was said to have begun at a rate of several per month and they were introduced into service.

In September 2003 Shahab-3 missiles were displayed on mobile launchers in a military parade and were claimed to have a range of 1000 km.

On 11 August 2004, the design of the Shahab-3 missile was modified (often referred to as Shahab-3M). The &quot;Cone-shaped&quot; warhead was replaced with a smaller &quot;Bottleneck&quot; warhead, the latter having a slower reentry and being advantageous when carrying chemical and biological agents, as well as being more suitable for carrying a nuclear payload. Another variant may include a larger fin, an airframe shorter by 1 m and a range of less than 1500 km.

On 19 September 2004, a subsequent test was conducted, followed by a parade on September 21, 2004, during which missiles were covered in banners proclaiming &quot;We will crush America under our feet.&quot;

In November 2004, Shamkhani said Iran could mass-produce the missile.

On 31 May 2005, Shamkhani declared that a new missile motor, using solid fuel technology and capable of carrying a payload of 700 kg over a distance of 1500–2000 km was successfully tested.

In September 2005 two new variants of the Shahab-3, with three metre long triconic (&quot;Baby-bottle&quot;) nose-cones, were tested and displayed publicly. Experts are in disagreement with regard to their intended purpose. Some are of the opinion that they are to carry a warhead of the air-burst type, geared toward the dispersal of chemical and biological agents, while others believe it is better suited for a nuclear payload.

On 16 February 2006 it was reported that Iran had successfully test-launched four missiles, one of which was the Shahab-3 with a range of 1300 km and another was the Shahab-4 with a range of 2200 km.

On 7 April 2006 The London Telegraph reported that Iran had modified the nose cone of the Shahab-3 to carry a nuclear warhead such as that manufactured by Pakistan - the designs of which Iran is rumoured to possess.

On 2 November 2006, Iran fired unarmed missiles to begin 10 days of military war games. Iranian state television reported &quot;dozens of missiles were fired including Shahab-2 and Shahab-3 missiles. The missiles had ranges from to up to ...Iranian experts have made some changes to Shahab-3 missiles installing cluster warheads in them with the capacity to carry 1,400 bombs&quot;. These launches came after some United States-led military exercises in the Persian Gulf on 30 October 2006, meant to train for blocking the transport of weapons of mass destruction.

===2008 Great Prophet III test===
On 8 July 2008, Iran test fired a non-upgraded version of the Shahab-3, as one of 9 medium- and long-range missiles launched as part of the Great Prophet III exercise.

Other missiles fired include the surface-to-surface Fateh-110 and Zelzal missiles. Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps air and naval units conducted these tests in a desert location. Air Force commander Hossein Salami said that &quot;Iran was ready to retaliate to military threats... we warn the enemies who intend to threaten us with military exercises and empty psychological operations that our hand will always be on the trigger and our missiles will always be ready to launch&quot;.

On 9 July 2008, Iran allegedly tested a version of the Shahab-3 in the Strait of Hormuz, which Iran has threatened to shut down traffic into if it is attacked. Arms control analyst Jeffrey Lewis analyzed Iranian launch footage and concluded that Iranian claims of testing an upgraded Shahab missile were unfounded. A senior Republican Guard commander said Iran would maintain security in the Strait of Hormuz and the Persian Gulf. According to the Israeli newspaper &quot;Haaretz&quot; and the French news agency Agence France-Presse, which published pictures from the missile test, &quot;Iran had apparently doctored photographs of missile test-firings and exaggerated the capabilities of the weapons&quot;, and an additional missile was added afterwards to cover up a failed launch.

<doc id="262774" wikidata="Q495999" url="?curid=262774" title="Hwasong-7">
<text>The Hwasong-7 () is a single-stage, mobile liquid propellant medium-range ballistic missile developed by North Korea. Developed in the mid-1980s, it is a scaled-up adaptation of the Soviet R-17 Elbrus missiles, more commonly known by its NATO reporting name &quot;Scud&quot;. The inventory is estimated to be around 200–300 missiles. US Air Force National Air and Space Intelligence Center estimates that as of June 2017 fewer than 100 launchers were operationally deployed.

It influenced the design of Pakistan&#x27;s Ghauri-1 missile, as well as the Iranian Shahab-3.

==Overview==

It is believed North Korea obtained R-17 designs from Egypt, and possibly modified designs from China, allowing them to reverse-engineer them into a larger and longer-distance weapon. United States reconnaissance satellites first detected this type in May 1990 at the Musudan-ri test launch facility, in northeastern North Korea.

The precise capabilities and specifications of the missile are unknown; even the fact of its production and deployment are controversial. It is a larger variant of the R-17, scaled up so its cross-sectional area is about doubled, with a diameter of and a length of .

Its aerodynamic design is stable, reducing the need for modern active stabilization systems while the missile is flying in the denser lower atmosphere. It can only be fueled when vertical, therefore it cannot be fueled before transport as is normal for modern missiles. Its range is estimated as with a payload to .

It has an estimated circular error probable (CEP) of . With GPS guidance, accuracy is believed to be between and . North Korea is believed to possess some 300 Hwasong-7 missiles and fewer than 50 mobile launchers.

The Hwasong-7&#x27;s technology has been exported to foreign nations (such as Iran and Pakistan) in secrecy on the basis of mutual exchange of technologies, with Iran being one of the largest beneficiaries of such technology. Successful variants were tested and deployed by Iran after developing the Shahab-3 which is roughly based on Hwasong-7. Some press reports (including &quot;The Sunday Telegraph&quot;, &quot;Jerusalem Post&quot;, and &quot;Janes&quot;) claimed that Libya signed a contract for a total of 50 Nodong systems in October 1999, with the first batch delivered in July 2000, however such rumors proved to be false when Libya voluntarily dismantled its weapons of mass destruction programs in December 2003 and invited foreign inspectors to verify the disarmament process. In that same year, US inspectors learned that Iraq attempted to buy Nodong missiles, but the North Koreans never delivered the missiles and refused to refund the $10 million down payment.

North Korea test-fired Hwasong-7 missiles in 2006 and 2014, in which North Korea fires two missiles that flew .

Although it has an estimated range of , launches in March 2014 flew only . Their range was shortened by firing at a higher launch angle. The missiles flew to an altitude of 160 km (100 mi) at . U.S. and South Korean Patriot PAC-2/3 interceptors are more specialized to hit ballistic missiles up to .

On 5 September 2016, North Korea fired three missiles into the Sea of Japan, these missiles achieved about range. Initially, these missiles were believed to be Hwasong-7, however, the actual missiles used for this launch were Hwasong-9 (Scud-ER). The United States strongly condemned the launch.

To enable interception at higher altitudes, South Korea is indigenously developing the long-range surface-to-air missile (L-SAM), and on 8 July 2016 the U.S. agreed to deploy one Terminal High Altitude Area Defense missile defense system in Seongju County, in the south of South Korea, by the end of 2017.
===Variant for reconnaissance satellite testing===
Hwasong-7 has a variant with white paint job for reconnaissance satellite cameras testing.

On 18 December 2022, North Korea launched two medium-range ballistic missiles from Sohae Satellite Launching Station. These missiles flew with an apogee of .

According to North Korea, the missiles were test-fired by National Aerospace Technology Administration (then National Aerospace Development Administration) for testing reconnaissance satellite cameras.

Based on photos released by North Korea, the missiles appear to be derived from Hwasong-7 (or Hwasong-9).

<doc id="262775" wikidata="Q1391746" url="?curid=262775" title="Ali Shamkhani">
<text>Ali Shamkhani (, born 29 September 1955) is an Iranian rear admiral upper half (two-star general). He served as the secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran from 2013 to 2023. He is currently member of the Expediency Discernment Council and political advisor of Supreme Leader of Iran since May 2023.

==Early life and education==
Shamkhani was born on 29 September 1955 in Ahvaz, Khuzestan. His family is of Iranian Arab origin. Before the Iranian Revolution, Shamkhani was member of a clandestine Islamist guerilla group named &quot;Mansouroun&quot; (), engaging in armed struggle against the Pahlavi dynasty. After the revolution, he joined the Mojahedin of the Islamic Revolution Organization. He studied engineering at Shahid Chamran University of Ahvaz.

==Career==
Shamkhani served as the commander of the IRGC navy with the rank of rear admiral. Later he also commanded the Artesh navy in addition to the IRGC navy. He was appointed the Minister of Revolutionary Guards in 1988.

He held the post of the minister of defense from August 1997 until August 2005 in the government of Mohammad Khatami. Shamkani was replaced by Mostafa Mohammad-Najjar in the post. Shamkhani also ran for office in the 2001 presidential elections.

He was the director of the Iranian Armed Forces&#x27; Center for Strategic Studies from 2005 to 2013. He is also military advisor to the Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei.

On 10 September 2013, Shamkhani was appointed to secretary of the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC) by president Hassan Rouhani.

After the US airstrike that was responsible for killing on 3 January 2020 the head of IRGC&#x27;s Quds force Qasem Soleimani as he travelled in Baghdad Iraq, Shamkhani said on 6 January of the response that it would be a &quot;historic nightmare&quot; for the US: &quot;Even if the weakest of these scenarios gains a consensus, the implementation of it can be a historic nightmare for the Americans... The entirety of the resistance forces will retaliate,&quot; he said to the Fars News Agency. The SNSC was assessing 13 revenge scenarios.

On 10 January 2020, the US State Department extended its sanctions under Executive Order 13876 to Shamkhani and seven other individuals, and &quot;twenty-two entities and three vessels pursuant to Executive Order 13871&quot; as well as a Chinese steel trading organization under the Iran Freedom and Counter-Proliferation Act.

On 20 February 2020, the US Treasury Department extended its sanctions again under Executive Order 13876 to Shamkhani amongst other individuals, following &quot;the disqualification of several thousand electoral candidates by Iran&#x27;s Guardian Council&quot;.

At a Baghdad news conference after meeting with Iraqi politicians on 7 March 2020, Shamkhani said &quot;Zionists are against regional security.&quot;

Ali Shamkhani resigned as the country&#x27;s top security official in May 2023. The New York Times disclosed that the Iranian government removed Ali Shamkhani from his position as a national security official following scrutiny over his close ties with a senior British spy. Speculation about his departure arose in January after his former ally, Alireza Akbari, was executed for espionage on behalf of the UK.

In June 2023, a report by Iran International revealed that Ali Shamkhani was forced to resign after his involvement as a key member of the government circle linked to Naji Sharifi Zindashti, a cartel engaged in kidnapping and drug trafficking in collaboration with the IRGC, was made public.

==Personal life==
Ali Shamkhani is the father of Hossein Shamkhani, said to successfully manage international oil trading operations despite U.S. sanctions targeting Iranian oil. According to U.S. officials, Hossein is a major figure in the supply of Iranian arms to Russia.

==Awards and honors==
In 2003, Shamkhani received the Shoja&#x27;at Medal, the highest military medal from President Mohammad Khatami. He was also honored for his eight years service as minister of defense in 2005. In 2004, Shamkhani received the Order of Abdulaziz Al Saud, the highest award in Saudi Arabia from King Fahd for his prominent role in the design and implementation in developing relations with Arabic countries in the Persian Gulf. He is the first Iranian minister to receive the medal. and received medals from the presidents of Syria and Lebanon in February 2004.

<text>Sheree Lynn Fitch (born 3 December 1956) is a Canadian writer and literacy advocate. Known primarily for her children&#x27;s books, she has also published poetry and fiction for adults.

== Biography ==
Fitch was born on 3 December 1956 in Ottawa, Ontario, where her father was serving with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Her father was originally from Nova Scotia, and her mother was from Sussex, New Brunswick. Sheree is the eldest of three children. When she was less than a year old, the family moved to Miramichi, New Brunswick. Three years later they moved to Moncton, where they lived for ten years, and then to Fredericton. Fitch graduated from Fredericton High School in 1974 as her class&#x27;s valedictorian. She married while still in her teens and had two sons, whom she raised as a single parent after divorcing at the age of 24.

Fitch attended St. Thomas University in Fredericton as a mature student and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English in 1987. She earned a Master of Arts in English from Acadia University in 1994. Her MA thesis was entitled &quot; &quot;The Sweet Chorus of Ha, Ha, He!&quot; Polyphony in utterature: A collection of writings on children&#x27;s poetry&quot;. In it she coined the term &quot;utterature&quot; to refer to &quot;all literature which depends upon the oral tradition and community of listeners&quot;.

In the 1990s Fitch was based in Halifax, Nova Scotia, where her second husband Gilles Plante worked for the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation. In 2001 he was transferred to Washington, D.C., and she spent almost 10 years there. Fitch and her husband moved to River John, Nova Scotia, when he retired from the CBC. Gilles Plante died in March 2024.

== Writing for children ==
Fitch is best known as the author of children&#x27;s poetry books characterized by &quot;exuberant wordplay and humour&quot;. She began writing poems for her own young sons, and took creative writing courses to develop her skills. She performed her poems at schools and libraries for several years before her first book, &quot;Toes in My Nose&quot;, with illustrations by Molly Bobak, was published in 1987. Her second book, &quot;Sleeping Dragons All Around&quot;, was published in 1989 and won that year&#x27;s Atlantic Booksellers&#x27; Choice Award. Its title comes from a line in the poem &quot;The Eve of St. Agnes&quot;, by John Keats.

During the 1990s Doubleday Canada published several of Fitch&#x27;s books of children&#x27;s poetry, a number of which won awards. In 1992 &quot;There Were Monkeys in My Kitchen&quot; won the Canadian Children&#x27;s Book Centre&#x27;s Mr. Christie&#x27;s Book Award for a book for children eight years and under. Her 1995 book &quot;Mabel Murple&quot; won the Ann Connor Brimer Award, and in 2000 she was awarded the Vicky Metcalf Award for Literature for Young People, which is presented to a Canadian author for a &quot;body of work (at least four books) that, in the opinion of the judges, demonstrates the highest literary standards&quot;. &quot;If You Could Wear My Sneakers: A Book about Children&#x27;s Rights&quot;, which was published in 1998, was commissioned by UNICEF. Its 15 poems are based on some of the articles of the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, including the rights to education, privacy, free speech and protection from war. Canadian journalist and broadcaster Peter Gzowski wrote the foreword for the book, which won the Ontario Library Association&#x27;s Silver Birch Award and the Atlantic Canadian Hackmatack Children&#x27;s Choice Award.

In the 2000s Fitch continued to publish books for young children, including her first board book, &quot;Kisses Kisses Baby-O&quot;, which was presented to the families of all babies born in Nova Scotia in 2008 as part of a family literacy program. She also expanded her range to the young adult fiction audience with her 2002 novel &quot;One More Step&quot;, followed by &quot;The Gravesavers&quot; in 2005.

In addition to poetry and novels, Fitch has written two non-fiction books for children who are aspiring writers: &quot;Breathe, Stretch, Write: Learning to Write with Everything You&#x27;ve Got&quot;, and &quot;Writing Maniac: How I Grew up to be a Writer (And You Can Too)&quot;.

== Writing for adults ==
In 1993 Fitch&#x27;s book of poetry for adults, &quot;In This House are Many Women&quot;, was published. It deals with serious issues in the lives of working-class women. The title refers to a sequence of poems set in a shelter for women escaping domestic violence. The author identifies strongly with the women in her poems, who are presented as survivors. Like her work for children, the adult poems play with words, but the material is darker, as in &quot;Civil Servant&quot;, in which a receptionist in an unemployment office imagines herself as Saint Peter at the Pearly gates, asking her clients &quot;Can I have your sin?&quot; (i.e. social insurance number). An expanded edition of &quot;In This House are Many Women&quot; was published in 2004.

Fitch&#x27;s first novel for adults, &quot;Kiss the Joy as it Flies&quot;, was published in 2008. The heroine is a single parent and a writer with &quot;realistic financial and familial problems, who experiences dark times without losing her playfulness and humour&quot;. &quot;Kiss the Joy as it Flies&quot; was shortlisted for the 2009 Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour.

== Literacy advocacy and honours ==
Fitch is active in the promotion of literacy, both through her writing and performing for children, and through her support of literacy organizations. In the 1990s she was a frequent guest and member of a discussion panel on Peter Gzowski&#x27;s Morningside radio program on CBC Radio One. As a result, she became involved in the Peter Gzowski Invitational (PGI) golf tournaments, which raise funds for literacy organizations. She has often acted as the PGI tournament&#x27;s poet laureate, including several times when the event was held in the Arctic.

She is the Honorary Patron of the Literacy Coalition of New Brunswick (LCNB). The LCNB&#x27;s Fitch Adult Learner Scholarship Awards, which are awarded annually, honour her commitment to the cause of literacy. She is also Honorary Spokesperson for the Nova Scotia Read to Me program. She sponsors the annual Sheree Fitch Prize for Young Writers awarded by the Writers&#x27; Federation of New Brunswick to a writer between 14 and 18 years old.

Fitch was granted an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by Saint Mary&#x27;s University in Halifax in May 1998. In May 2004 she was awarded an honorary Doctor of Letters degree by Acadia University. St. Thomas University awarded her an honorary doctorate in May 2010, citing her contributions as an author, educator, and &quot;tireless advocate for literacy&quot;.

Fitch was appointed to the Order of Canada in June 2023 with the rank of Officer. She lives in River John, Nova Scotia.
