<text>Lee de Forest (August 26, 1873 – June 30, 1961) was an American inventor, electrical engineer and an early pioneer in electronics of fundamental importance. He invented the first practical electronic amplifier,
the three-element &quot;Audion&quot; triode vacuum tube in 1906. This helped start the Electronic Age, and enabled the development of the electronic oscillator. These made radio broadcasting and long distance telephone lines possible, and led to the development of talking motion pictures, among countless other applications.

He had over 300 patents worldwide, but also a tumultuous career – he boasted that he made, then lost, four fortunes. He was also involved in several major patent lawsuits, spent a substantial part of his income on legal bills, and was even tried (and acquitted) for mail fraud. 

Despite this, he was recognised for his pioneering work with the 1922 IEEE Medal of Honor, the 1923 Franklin Institute Elliott Cresson Medal and the 1946 American Institute of Electrical Engineers Edison Medal.

==Early life==
Lee de Forest was born in 1873 in Council Bluffs, Iowa, the son of Anna Margaret ( Robbins) and Henry Swift DeForest. He was a direct descendant of Jessé de Forest, the leader of a group of Walloon Huguenots who fled Europe in the 17th century due to religious persecution.

De Forest&#x27;s father was a Congregational Church minister who hoped his son would also become a pastor. In 1879 the elder de Forest became president of the American Missionary Association&#x27;s Talladega College in Talladega, Alabama, a school &quot;open to all of either sex, without regard to sect, race, or color&quot;, and which educated primarily African-Americans. Many of the local white citizens resented the school and its mission, and Lee spent most of his youth in Talladega isolated from the white community, with several close friends among the black children of the town.

De Forest prepared for college by attending Mount Hermon Boys&#x27; School in Gill, Massachusetts, for two years, beginning in 1891. In 1893, he enrolled in a three-year course of studies at Yale University&#x27;s Sheffield Scientific School in New Haven, Connecticut, on a $300 per year scholarship that had been established for relatives of David de Forest. Convinced that he was destined to become a famous—and rich—inventor, and perpetually short of funds, he sought to interest companies with a series of devices and puzzles he created, and expectantly submitted essays in prize competitions, all with little success.

After completing his undergraduate studies, in September 1896 de Forest began three years of postgraduate work. However, his electrical experiments had a tendency to blow fuses, causing building-wide blackouts. Even after being warned to be more careful, he managed to douse the lights during an important lecture by Professor Charles S. Hastings, who responded by having de Forest expelled from Sheffield.

With the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, de Forest enrolled in the Connecticut Volunteer Militia Battery as a bugler, but the war ended and he was mustered out without ever leaving the state. He then completed his studies at Yale&#x27;s Sloane Physics Laboratory, earning a Doctorate in 1899 with a dissertation on the &quot;Reflection of Hertzian Waves from the Ends of Parallel Wires&quot;, supervised by theoretical physicist Willard Gibbs.

==Early radio work==

Reflecting his pioneering work, de Forest has sometimes been credited as the &quot;Father of Radio&quot;, an honorific which he adopted as the title of his 1950 autobiography. In the late 1800s he became convinced there was a great future in radiotelegraphic communication (then known as &quot;wireless telegraphy&quot;), but Italian Guglielmo Marconi, who received his first patent in 1896, was already making impressive progress in both Europe and the United States. One drawback of Marconi&#x27;s approach was his use of a coherer as a receiver, which, while providing for permanent records, was also slow (after each received Morse code dot or dash, it had to be tapped to restore operation), insensitive, and not very reliable. De Forest was determined to devise a better system, including a self-restoring detector that could receive transmissions by ear, thus making it capable of receiving weaker signals and also allowing faster Morse code sending speeds.

After making unsuccessful inquiries about employment with Nikola Tesla and Marconi, de Forest struck out on his own. His first job after leaving Yale was with the Western Electric Company&#x27;s telephone lab in Chicago, Illinois. While there he developed his first receiver, which was based on findings by two German scientists, Drs. A. Neugschwender and Emil Aschkinass. Their original design consisted of a mirror in which a narrow, moistened slit had been cut through the silvered back. Attaching a battery and telephone receiver, they could hear sound changes in response to radio signal impulses. De Forest, along with Ed Smythe, a co-worker who provided financial and technical help, developed variations they called &quot;responders&quot;.

A series of short-term positions followed, including three unproductive months with Professor Warren S. Johnson&#x27;s American Wireless Telegraph Company in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and work as an assistant editor of the &quot;Western Electrician&quot; in Chicago. With radio research his main priority, de Forest next took a night teaching position at the Lewis Institute, which freed him to conduct experiments at the Armour Institute. By 1900, using a spark-coil transmitter and his responder receiver, de Forest expanded his transmitting range to about seven kilometers (four miles). Professor Clarence Freeman of the Armour Institute became interested in de Forest&#x27;s work and developed a new type of spark transmitter.

De Forest soon felt that Smythe and Freeman were holding him back, so in the fall of 1901 he made the bold decision to go to New York to compete directly with Marconi in transmitting race results for the International Yacht races. Marconi had already made arrangements to provide reports for the Associated Press, which he had successfully done for the 1899 contest. De Forest contracted to do the same for the smaller Publishers&#x27; Press Association.

The race effort turned out to be an almost total failure. The Freeman transmitter broke down—in a fit of rage, de Forest threw it overboard—and had to be replaced by an ordinary spark coil. Even worse, the American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph Company, which claimed its ownership of Amos Dolbear&#x27;s 1886 patent for wireless communication meant it held a monopoly for all wireless communication in the United States, had also set up a powerful transmitter. None of these companies had effective tuning for their transmitters, so only one could transmit at a time without causing mutual interference. Although an attempt was made to have the three systems avoid conflicts by rotating operations over five-minute intervals, the agreement broke down, resulting in chaos as the simultaneous transmissions clashed with each other. De Forest ruefully noted that under these conditions the only successful &quot;wireless&quot; communication was done by visual semaphore &quot;wig-wag&quot; flags. (The 1903 International Yacht races would be a repeat of 1901—Marconi worked for the Associated Press, de Forest for the Publishers&#x27; Press Association, and the unaffiliated International Wireless Company (successor to 1901&#x27;s American Wireless Telephone and Telegraph) operated a high-powered transmitter that was used primarily to drown out the other two.)

==American De Forest Wireless Telegraph Company==
Despite this setback, de Forest remained in the New York City area, in order to raise interest in his ideas and capital to replace the small working companies that had been formed to promote his work thus far. In January 1902 he met a promoter, Abraham White, who would become de Forest&#x27;s main sponsor for the next five years. White envisioned bold and expansive plans that enticed the inventor—however, he was also dishonest and much of the new enterprise would be built on wild exaggeration and stock fraud. To back de Forest&#x27;s efforts, White incorporated the American DeForest Wireless Telegraph Company, with himself as the company&#x27;s president, and de Forest the Scientific Director. The company claimed as its goal the development of &quot;world-wide wireless&quot;.

The original &quot;responder&quot; receiver (also known as the &quot;goo anti-coherer&quot;) proved to be too crude to be commercialized, and de Forest struggled to develop a non-infringing device for receiving radio signals. In 1903, Reginald Fessenden demonstrated an electrolytic detector, and de Forest developed a variation, which he called the &quot;spade detector&quot;, claiming it did not infringe on Fessenden&#x27;s patents. Fessenden, and the U.S. courts, did not agree, and court injunctions enjoined American De Forest from using the device.

Meanwhile, White set in motion a series of highly visible promotions for American DeForest: &quot;Wireless Auto No.1&quot; was positioned on Wall Street to &quot;send stock quotes&quot; using an unmuffled spark transmitter to loudly draw the attention of potential investors, in early 1904 two stations were established at Wei-hai-Wei on the Chinese mainland and aboard the Chinese steamer &quot;SS Haimun&quot;, which allowed war correspondent Captain Lionel James of &quot;The Times&quot; of London to report on the brewing Russo-Japanese War, and later that year a tower, with &quot;DEFOREST&quot; arrayed in lights, was erected on the grounds of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition in Saint Louis, Missouri, where the company won a gold medal for its radiotelegraph demonstrations. (Marconi withdrew from the Exposition when he learned de Forest would be there).

The company&#x27;s most important early contract was the construction, in 1905–1906, of five high-powered radiotelegraph stations for the U.S. Navy, located in Panama, Pensacola and Key West, Florida, Guantanamo, Cuba, and Puerto Rico. It also installed shore stations along the Atlantic Coast and Great Lakes, and equipped shipboard stations. But the main focus was selling stock at ever more inflated prices, spurred by the construction of promotional inland stations. Most of these inland stations had no practical use and were abandoned once the local stock sales slowed.

De Forest eventually came into conflict with his company&#x27;s management. His main complaint was the limited support he got for conducting research, while company officials were upset with de Forest&#x27;s inability to develop a practical receiver free of patent infringement. (This problem was finally resolved with the invention of the carborundum crystal detector by another company employee, General Henry Harrison Chase Dunwoody). On November 28, 1906, in exchange for $1000 (half of which was claimed by an attorney) and the rights to some early Audion detector patents, de Forest turned in his stock and resigned from the company that bore his name. American DeForest was then reorganized as the United Wireless Telegraph Company, and would be the dominant U.S. radio communications firm, albeit propped up by massive stock fraud, until its bankruptcy in 1912.

==Radio Telephone Company==
De Forest moved quickly to re-establish himself as an independent inventor, working in his own laboratory in the Parker Building in New York City. The Radio Telephone Company was incorporated in order to promote his inventions, with James Dunlop Smith, a former American DeForest salesman, as president, and de Forest the vice president (De Forest preferred the term radio, which up to now had been primarily used in Europe, over wireless).

===Arc radiotelephone development===
At the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition, Valdemar Poulsen had presented a paper on an arc transmitter, which unlike the discontinuous pulses produced by spark transmitters, created steady &quot;continuous wave&quot; signals that could be used for amplitude modulated (AM) audio transmissions. Although Poulsen had patented his invention, de Forest claimed to have come up with a variation that allowed him to avoid infringing on Poulsen&#x27;s work. Using his &quot;sparkless&quot; arc transmitter, de Forest first transmitted audio across a lab room on December 31, 1906, and by February was making experimental transmissions, including music produced by Thaddeus Cahill&#x27;s telharmonium, that were heard throughout the city.

On July 18, 1907, de Forest made the first ship-to-shore transmissions by radiotelephone—race reports for the Annual Inter-Lakes Yachting Association (I-LYA) Regatta held on Lake Erie—which were sent from the steam yacht &quot;Thelma&quot; to his assistant, Frank E. Butler, located in the Fox&#x27;s Dock Pavilion on South Bass Island. De Forest also interested the U.S. Navy in his radiotelephone, which placed a rush order to have 26 arc sets installed for its Great White Fleet around-the-world voyage that began in late 1907. However, at the conclusion of the circumnavigation the sets were declared to be too unreliable to meet the Navy&#x27;s needs and removed.

The company set up a network of radiotelephone stations along the Atlantic coast and the Great Lakes, for coastal ship navigation. However, the installations proved unprofitable, and by 1911 the parent company and its subsidiaries were on the brink of bankruptcy.

===Initial broadcasting experiments===

De Forest also used the arc-transmitter to conduct some of the earliest experimental entertainment radio broadcasts. Eugenia Farrar sang &quot;I Love You Truly&quot; in an unpublicized test from his laboratory in 1907, and in 1908, on de Forest&#x27;s Paris honeymoon, musical selections were broadcast from the Eiffel Tower as a part of demonstrations of the arc-transmitter. In early 1909, in what may have been the first public speech by radio, de Forest&#x27;s mother-in-law, Harriot Stanton Blatch, made a broadcast supporting women&#x27;s suffrage.

More ambitious demonstrations followed. A series of tests in conjunction with the Metropolitan Opera House in New York City were conducted to determine whether it was practical to broadcast opera performances live from the stage. &quot;Tosca&quot; was performed on January 12, 1910, and the next day&#x27;s test included Italian tenor Enrico Caruso. On February 24, the Manhattan Opera Company&#x27;s Mme. Mariette Mazarin sang &quot;La Habanera&quot; from &quot;Carmen&quot; and selections from the controversial &quot;Elektra&quot; over a transmitter located in de Forest&#x27;s lab. But these tests showed that the idea was not yet technically feasible, and de Forest would not make any additional entertainment broadcasts until late 1916, when more capable vacuum-tube equipment became available.

===&quot;Grid&quot; Audion detector===

De Forest&#x27;s most famous invention was the &quot;grid Audion&quot;, which was the first successful three-element (triode) vacuum tube, and the first device which could amplify electrical signals. He traced its inspiration to 1900, when, experimenting with a spark-gap transmitter, he briefly thought that the flickering of a nearby gas flame might be in response to electromagnetic pulses. With further tests he soon determined that the cause of the flame fluctuations was due to air pressure changes produced by the loud sound of the spark. Still, he was intrigued by the idea that, properly configured, it might be possible to use a flame or something similar to detect radio signals.

After determining that an open flame was too susceptible to ambient air currents, de Forest investigated whether ionized gases, heated and enclosed in a partially evacuated glass tube, could be used instead. In 1905 to 1906 he developed various configurations of glass-tube devices, which he gave the general name of &quot;Audions&quot;. The first Audions had only two electrodes, and on October 25, 1906, de Forest filed a patent for the diode vacuum tube detector, that was granted U.S. patent number 841387 on January 15, 1907. Subsequently, a third &quot;control&quot; electrode was added, originally as a surrounding metal cylinder or a wire coiled around the outside of the glass tube. None of these initial designs worked particularly well. De Forest gave a presentation of his work to date to the October 26, 1906, New York meeting of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, which was reprinted in two parts in late 1907 in the &quot;Scientific American Supplement&quot;. He was insistent that a small amount of residual gas was necessary for the tubes to operate properly. However, he also admitted that &quot;I have arrived as yet at no completely satisfactory theory as to the exact means by which the high-frequency oscillations affect so markedly the behavior of an ionized gas.&quot;
In late 1906, de Forest made a breakthrough when he reconfigured the control electrode, moving it from outside the tube envelope to a position inside the tube between the filament and the plate. He called the intermediate electrode a &quot;grid&quot;, reportedly due to its similarity to the &quot;gridiron&quot; lines on American football playing fields. Experiments conducted with his assistant, John V. L. Hogan, convinced him that he had discovered an important new radio detector. He quickly prepared a patent application which was filed on January 29, 1907, and received on February 18, 1908. Because the grid-control Audion was the only configuration to become commercially valuable, the earlier versions were forgotten, and the term &quot;Audion&quot; later became synonymous with just the grid type. It later also became known as the triode.

The grid Audion was the first device to amplify, albeit only slightly, the strength of received radio signals. However, to many observers it appeared that de Forest had done nothing more than add the grid electrode to an existing detector configuration, the Fleming valve, which also consisted of a filament and plate enclosed in an evacuated glass tube. De Forest passionately denied the similarly of the two devices, claiming his invention was a relay that amplified currents, while the Fleming valve was merely a rectifier that converted alternating current to direct current. (For this reason, de Forest objected to his Audion being referred to as &quot;a valve&quot;.) The U.S. courts were not convinced, and ruled that the grid Audion did in fact infringe on the Fleming valve patent, now held by Marconi. In contrast, Marconi admitted that the addition of the third electrode was a patentable improvement, and the two sides agreed to license each other so that both could manufacture three-electrode tubes in the United States. (De Forest&#x27;s European patents had lapsed because he did not have the funds needed to renew them).

Because of its limited uses and the great variability in the quality of individual units, the grid Audion would be rarely used during the first half-decade after its invention. In 1908, John V. L. Hogan reported that &quot;The Audion is capable of being developed into a really efficient detector, but in its present forms is quite unreliable and entirely too complex to be properly handled by the usual wireless operator.&quot;

==Employment at Federal Telegraph==

In May 1910, the Radio Telephone Company and its subsidiaries were reorganized as the North American Wireless Corporation, but financial difficulties meant that the company&#x27;s activities had nearly come to a halt. De Forest moved to San Francisco, California, and in early 1911 took a research job at the Federal Telegraph Company, which produced long-range radiotelegraph systems using high-powered Poulsen arcs.

===Audio frequency amplification===
One of de Forest&#x27;s areas of research at Federal Telegraph was improving the reception of signals, and he came up with the idea of strengthening the audio frequency output from a grid Audion by feeding it into a second tube for additional amplification. He called this a &quot;cascade amplifier&quot;, which eventually consisted of chaining together up to three Audions.

At this time the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was researching ways to amplify telephone signals to provide better long-distance service, and it was recognized that de Forest&#x27;s device had potential as a telephone line repeater. In mid-1912 an associate, John Stone Stone, contacted AT&amp;T to arrange for de Forest to demonstrate his invention. It was found that de Forest&#x27;s &quot;gassy&quot; version of the Audion could not handle even the relatively low voltages used by telephone lines. (Owing to the way he constructed the tubes, de Forest&#x27;s Audions would cease to operate with too high a vacuum.) However, careful research by Dr. Harold D. Arnold and his team at AT&amp;T&#x27;s Western Electric subsidiary determined that improving the tube&#x27;s design would allow it to be more fully evacuated, and the high vacuum allowed it to operate at telephone-line voltages. With these changes the Audion evolved into a modern electron-discharge vacuum tube, using electron flows rather than ions. (Dr. Irving Langmuir at the General Electric Corporation made similar findings, and both he and Arnold attempted to patent the &quot;high vacuum&quot; construction, but the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 1931 that this modification could not be patented).

After a delay of ten months, in July 1913 AT&amp;T, through a third party who disguised his link to the telephone company, purchased the wire rights to seven Audion patents for $50,000. De Forest had hoped for a higher payment, but was again in bad financial shape and was unable to bargain for more. In 1915, AT&amp;T used the innovation to conduct the first transcontinental telephone calls, in conjunction with the Panama-Pacific International Exposition at San Francisco. 

==Reorganized Radio Telephone Company==
Radio Telephone Company officials had engaged in some of the same stock selling excesses that had taken place at American DeForest, and as part of the U.S. government&#x27;s crackdown on stock fraud, in March 1912 de Forest, plus four other company officials, were arrested and charged with &quot;use of the mails to defraud&quot;. Their trials took place in late 1913, and while three of the defendants were found guilty, de Forest was acquitted. With the legal problems behind him, de Forest reorganized his company as the DeForest Radio Telephone Company, and established a laboratory at 1391 Sedgewick Avenue in the Highbridge section of the Bronx in New York City. The company&#x27;s limited finances were boosted by the sale, in October 1914, of the commercial Audion patent rights for radio signalling to AT&amp;T for $90,000, with de Forest retaining the rights for sales for &quot;amateur and experimental use&quot;. In October 1915 AT&amp;T conducted test radio transmissions from the Navy&#x27;s station in Arlington, Virginia that were heard as far away as Paris and Hawaii.
The Radio Telephone Company began selling &quot;Oscillion&quot; power tubes to amateurs, suitable for radio transmissions. The company wanted to keep a tight hold on the tube business, and originally maintained a policy that retailers had to require their customers to return a worn-out tube before they could get a replacement. This style of business encouraged others to make and sell unlicensed vacuum tubes which did not impose a return policy. One of the boldest was Audio Tron Sales Company founded in 1915 by Elmer T. Cunningham of San Francisco, whose Audio Tron tubes cost less but were of equal or higher quality. The de Forest company sued Audio Tron Sales, eventually settling out of court.

In April 1917, the company&#x27;s remaining commercial radio patent rights were sold to AT&amp;T&#x27;s Western Electric subsidiary for $250,000. During World War I, the Radio Telephone Company prospered from sales of radio equipment to the military. However, it also became known for the poor quality of its vacuum tubes, especially compared to those produced by major industrial manufacturers such as General Electric and Western Electric.

===Regeneration controversy===
Beginning in 1912, there was increased investigation of vacuum-tube capabilities, simultaneously by numerous inventors in multiple countries, who identified additional important uses for the device. These overlapping discoveries led to complicated legal disputes over priority, perhaps the most bitter being one in the United States between de Forest and Edwin Howard Armstrong over the discovery of regeneration (also known as the &quot;feedback circuit&quot; and, by de Forest, as the &quot;ultra-audion&quot;).

Beginning in 1913 Armstrong prepared papers and gave demonstrations that comprehensively documented how to employ three-element vacuum tubes in circuits that amplified signals to stronger levels than previously thought possible, and that could also generate high-power oscillations usable for radio transmission. In late 1913 Armstrong applied for patents covering the regenerative circuit, and on October 6, 1914 was issued for his discovery.

U.S. patent law included a provision for challenging grants if another inventor could prove prior discovery. With an eye to increasing the value of the patent portfolio that would be sold to Western Electric in 1917, beginning in 1915 de Forest filed a series of patent applications that largely copied Armstrong&#x27;s claims, in the hopes of having the priority of the competing applications upheld by an interference hearing at the patent office. Based on a notebook entry recorded at the time, de Forest asserted that, while working on the cascade amplifier, he had stumbled on August 6, 1912, across the feedback principle, which was then used in the spring of 1913 to operate a low-powered transmitter for heterodyne reception of Federal Telegraph arc transmissions. However, there was also strong evidence that de Forest was unaware of the full significance of this discovery, as shown by his lack of follow-up and continuing misunderstanding of the physics involved. In particular, it appeared that he was unaware of the potential for further development until he became familiar with Armstrong&#x27;s research. De Forest was not alone in the interference determination—the patent office identified four competing claimants for its hearings, consisting of Armstrong, de Forest, General Electric&#x27;s Langmuir, and a German, Alexander Meissner, whose application would be seized by the Office of Alien Property Custodian during World War I.

The subsequent legal proceedings become divided between two groups of court cases. The first court action began in January 1920 when Armstrong, with Westinghouse, which purchased his patent, sued the De Forest Company in district court for infringement of patent 1,113,149. On May 17, 1921, the court ruled that the lack of awareness and understanding on de Forest&#x27;s part, in addition to the fact that he had made no immediate advances beyond his initial observation, made implausible his attempt to prevail as inventor.

However, a second series of court cases, which were the result of the patent office interference proceeding, had a different outcome. The interference board had also sided with Armstrong, and de Forest appealed its decision to the District of Columbia district court. On May 8, 1924, that court concluded that the evidence, beginning with the 1912 notebook entry, was sufficient to establish de Forest&#x27;s priority. Now on the defensive, Armstrong&#x27;s side tried to overturn the decision, but these efforts, which twice went before the U.S. Supreme Court, in 1928 and 1934, were unsuccessful.

This judicial ruling meant that Lee de Forest was now legally recognized in the United States as the inventor of regeneration. However, much of the engineering community continued to consider Armstrong to be the actual developer, with de Forest viewed as someone who skillfully used the patent system to get credit for an invention to which he had barely contributed. Following the 1934 Supreme Court decision, Armstrong attempted to return his Institute of Radio Engineers (present-day Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers) Medal of Honor, which had been awarded to him in 1917 &quot;in recognition of his work and publications dealing with the action of the oscillating and non-oscillating audion&quot;, but the organization&#x27;s board refused to let him, stating that it &quot;strongly affirms the original award&quot;. The practical effect of de Forest&#x27;s victory was that his company was free to sell products that used regeneration, for during the controversy, which became more a personal feud than a business dispute, Armstrong tried to block the company from even being licensed to sell equipment under his patent.

De Forest regularly responded to articles which he thought exaggerated Armstrong&#x27;s contributions with animosity that continued even after Armstrong&#x27;s 1954 suicide. Following the publication of Carl Dreher&#x27;s &quot;E. H. Armstrong, the Hero as Inventor&quot; in the August 1956 Harper&#x27;s magazine, de Forest wrote the author, describing Armstrong as &quot;exceedingly arrogant, brow beating, even brutal...&quot;, and defending the Supreme Court decision in his favor.

===Renewed broadcasting activities===

In the summer of 1915, the company received an Experimental license for station 2XG, located at its Highbridge laboratory. In late 1916, de Forest renewed the entertainment broadcasts he had suspended in 1910, now using the superior capabilities of vacuum-tube equipment. 2XG&#x27;s debut program aired on October 26, 1916, as part of an arrangement with the Columbia Graphophone Company to promote its recordings, which included &quot;announcing the title and &#x27;Columbia Gramophone [&quot;sic&quot;] Company&#x27; with each playing&quot;. Beginning November 1, the &quot;Highbridge Station&quot; offered a nightly schedule featuring the Columbia recordings.

These broadcasts were also used to advertise &quot;the products of the DeForest Radio Co., mostly the radio parts, with all the zeal of our catalogue and price list&quot;, until comments by Western Electric engineers caused de Forest enough embarrassment to make him decide to eliminate the direct advertising. The station also made the first audio broadcast of election reports—in earlier elections, stations that broadcast results had used Morse code—providing news of the November 1916 Wilson-Hughes presidential election. The &quot;New York American&quot; installed a private wire and bulletins were sent out every hour. About 2,000 listeners heard &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and other anthems, songs, and hymns.

With the entry of the United States into World War I on April 6, 1917, all civilian radio stations were ordered to shut down, so 2XG was silenced for the duration of the war. The ban on civilian stations was lifted on October 1, 1919, and 2XG soon renewed operation, with the Brunswick-Balke-Collender company now supplying the phonograph records. In early 1920, de Forest moved the station&#x27;s transmitter from the Bronx to Manhattan, but did not have permission to do so, so district Radio Inspector Arthur Batcheller ordered the station off the air. De Forest&#x27;s response was to return to San Francisco in March, taking 2XG&#x27;s transmitter with him. A new station, 6XC, was established as &quot;The California Theater station&quot;, which de Forest later stated was the &quot;first radio-telephone station devoted solely&quot; to broadcasting to the public.

Later that year a de Forest associate, Clarence &quot;C.S.&quot; Thompson, established Radio News &amp; Music, Inc., in order to lease de Forest radio transmitters to newspapers interested in setting up their own broadcasting stations. In August 1920, The &quot;Detroit News&quot; began operation of &quot;The Detroit News Radiophone&quot;, initially with the callsign 8MK, which later became broadcasting station WWJ.

==Phonofilm sound-on-film process==
In 1921, de Forest ended most of his radio research in order to concentrate on developing an optical sound-on-film process called Phonofilm. In 1919 he filed the first patent for the new system, which improved upon earlier work by Finnish inventor Eric Tigerstedt and the German partnership Tri-Ergon. Phonofilm recorded the electrical waveforms produced by a microphone photographically onto film, using parallel lines of variable shades of gray, an approach known as &quot;variable density&quot;, in contrast to &quot;variable area&quot; systems used by processes such as RCA Photophone. When the movie film was projected, the recorded information was converted back into sound, in synchronization with the picture.

From October 1921 to September 1922, de Forest lived in Berlin, Germany, meeting the Tri-Ergon developers (German inventors Josef Engl (1893–1942), Hans Vogt (1890–1979), and Joseph Massolle (1889–1957)) and investigating other European sound film systems. In April 1922 he announced that he would soon have a workable sound-on-film system. On March 12, 1923, he demonstrated Phonofilm to the press; this was followed on April 12, 1923, by a private demonstration to electrical engineers at the Engineering Society Building&#x27;s Auditorium at 33 West 39th Street in New York City.

In November 1922, de Forest established the De Forest Phonofilm Company, located at 314 East 48th Street in New York City. But none of the Hollywood movie studios expressed interest in his invention, and because at this time these studios controlled all the major theater chains, this meant de Forest was limited to showing his experimental films in independent theaters (The Phonofilm Company would file for bankruptcy in September 1926.).

After recording stage performances (such as in vaudeville), speeches, and musical acts, on April 15, 1923, de Forest premiered 18 Phonofilm short films at the independent Rivoli Theater in New York City. Starting in May 1924, Max and Dave Fleischer used the Phonofilm process for their Song Car-Tune series of cartoons—featuring the &quot;Follow the Bouncing Ball&quot; gimmick. However, de Forest&#x27;s choice of primarily filming short vaudeville acts, instead of full-length features, limited the appeal of Phonofilm to Hollywood studios.

De Forest also worked with Freeman Harrison Owens and Theodore Case, using their work to perfect the Phonofilm system. However, de Forest had a falling out with both men. Due to de Forest&#x27;s continuing misuse of Theodore Case&#x27;s inventions and failure to publicly acknowledge Case&#x27;s contributions, the Case Research Laboratory proceeded to build its own camera. That camera was used by Case and his colleague Earl Sponable to record Calvin Coolidge on August 11, 1924, which was one of the films shown by de Forest and claimed by him to be the product of his inventions.

Believing that de Forest was more concerned with his own fame and recognition than he was with actually creating a workable system of sound film, and because of his continuing attempts to downplay the contributions of the Case Research Laboratory in the creation of Phonofilm, Case severed his ties with de Forest in the fall of 1925. Case successfully negotiated an agreement to use his patents with studio head William Fox, owner of Fox Film Corporation, who marketed the innovation as Fox Movietone. Warner Brothers introduced a competing method for sound film, the Vitaphone sound-on-disc process developed by Western Electric, with the August 6, 1926, release of the John Barrymore film &quot;Don Juan&quot;.

In 1927 and 1928, Hollywood expanded its use of sound-on-film systems, including Fox Movietone and RCA Photophone. Meanwhile, theater chain owner Isadore Schlesinger purchased the UK rights to Phonofilm and released short films of British music hall performers from September 1926 to May 1929. Almost 200 Phonofilm shorts were made, and many are preserved in the collections of the Library of Congress and the British Film Institute.

==Later years and death==
In April 1923, the De Forest Radio Telephone &amp; Telegraph Company, which manufactured de Forest&#x27;s Audions for commercial use, was sold to a group headed by Edward Jewett of Jewett-Paige Motors, which expanded the company&#x27;s factory to cope with rising demand for radios. The sale also bought the services of de Forest, who was focusing his attention on newer innovations. De Forest&#x27;s finances were badly hurt by the stock market crash of 1929, and research in mechanical television proved unprofitable. In 1934, he established a small shop to produce diathermy machines, and, in a 1942 interview, still hoped &quot;to make at least one more great invention&quot;.

De Forest was a vocal critic of many of the developments in the entertainment side of the radio industry. In 1940 he sent an open letter to the National Association of Broadcasters in which he demanded: &quot;What have you done with my child, the radio broadcast? You have debased this child, dressed him in rags of ragtime, tatters of jive and boogie-woogie.&quot; That same year, de Forest and early TV engineer Ulises Armand Sanabria presented the concept of a primitive unmanned combat air vehicle using a television camera and a jam-resistant radio control in a &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; issue. In 1950 his autobiography, &quot;Father of Radio&quot;, was published, although it sold poorly.
De Forest was the guest celebrity on the May 22, 1957, episode of the television show &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, where he was introduced as &quot;the father of radio and the grandfather of television&quot;. He suffered a severe heart attack in 1958, after which he remained mostly bedridden. He died in Hollywood on June 30, 1961, aged 87, and was interred in San Fernando Mission Cemetery in Los Angeles, California. De Forest died relatively poor, with just $1,250 in his bank account.

==Legacy==

The grid Audion, which de Forest called &quot;my greatest invention&quot;, and the vacuum tubes developed from it, dominated the field of electronics for forty years, making possible long-distance telephone service, radio broadcasting, television, and many other applications. It could also be used as an electronic switching element, and was later used in early digital electronics, including the first electronic computers, although the 1948 invention of the transistor would lead to microchips that eventually supplanted vacuum-tube technology. For this reason de Forest has been called one of the founders of the &quot;electronic age&quot;.

According to Donald Beaver, his intense desire to overcome the deficiencies of his childhood account for his independence, self-reliance, and inventiveness. He displayed a strong desire to achieve, to conquer hardship, and to devote himself to a career of invention. &quot;He possessed the qualities of the traditional tinkerer-inventor: visionary faith, self-confidence, perseverance, the capacity for sustained hard work.&quot;

De Forest&#x27;s archives were donated by his widow to the Perham Electronic Foundation, which in 1973 opened the Foothills Electronics Museum at Foothill College in Los Altos Hills, California. In 1991 the college closed the museum, breaking its contract. The foundation won a lawsuit and was awarded $775,000. The holdings were placed in storage for twelve years, before being acquired in 2003 by History San José and put on display as The Perham Collection of Early Electronics.

== Personal life ==
=== Marriages ===

De Forest was married four times, with the first three marriages ending in divorce:
* Lucille Sheardown in February 1906. Divorced before the end of the year.
* Nora Stanton Blatch Barney (1883–1971) on February 14, 1908. They had a daughter, Harriet, but were separated by 1909 and divorced in 1912.
* Mary Mayo White (1891–1957), stage name Mary Mayo, in December 1912. According to census records, in 1920 they were living with their infant daughter, Deena (born ); divorced October 5, 1930 (per &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;). Mayo died December 30, 1957, in a fire in Los Angeles.
* Marie Mosquini (1899–1983) on October 10, 1930; Mosquini was a silent film actress, and they remained married until his death in 1961.

=== Politics ===
De Forest was a conservative Republican and fervent anti-communist and anti-fascist. In 1932, in the midst of the Great Depression, he voted for Franklin Roosevelt, but later came to resent him, calling Roosevelt America&#x27;s &quot;first Fascist president&quot;. In 1949, he &quot;sent letters to all members of Congress urging them to vote against socialized medicine, federally subsidized housing, and an excess profits tax&quot;. In 1952, he wrote to the newly elected Vice President Richard Nixon, urging him to &quot;prosecute with renewed vigor your valiant fight to put out Communism from every branch of our government&quot;. In December 1953, he cancelled his subscription to &quot;The Nation&quot;, accusing it of being &quot;lousy with Treason, crawling with Communism.&quot;

=== Religious views ===
Although raised in a strongly religious Protestant household, de Forest later became an agnostic. In his autobiography, he wrote that in the summer of 1894 there was an important shift in his beliefs: &quot;Through that Freshman vacation at Yale I became more of a philosopher than I have ever since. And thus, one by one, were my childhood&#x27;s firm religious beliefs altered or reluctantly discarded.&quot;

==Quotes==
De Forest was given to expansive predictions, many of which were not borne out, but he also made many correct predictions, including microwave communication and cooking.
* &quot;I discovered an Invisible Empire of the Air, intangible, yet solid as granite.&quot;
* &quot;I foresee great refinements in the field of short-pulse microwave signaling, whereby several simultaneous programs may occupy the same channel, in sequence, with incredibly swift electronic communication. [...] Short waves will be generally used in the kitchen for roasting and baking, almost instantaneously.&quot; – 1952
* &quot;So I repeat that while theoretically and technically television may be feasible, yet commercially and financially, I consider it an impossibility; a development of which we need not waste little time in dreaming.&quot; – 1926
* &quot;To place a man in a multi-stage rocket and project him into the controlling gravitational field of the moon where the passengers can make scientific observations, perhaps land alive, and then return to earth—all that constitutes a wild dream worthy of Jules Verne. I am bold enough to say that such a man-made voyage will never occur regardless of all future advances.&quot; – 1957
* &quot;I do not foresee &#x27;spaceships&#x27; to the moon or Mars. Mortals must live and die on Earth or within its atmosphere!&quot; – 1952
* &quot;As a growing competitor to the tube amplifier comes now the Bell Laboratories’ transistor, a three-electrode germanium crystal of amazing amplification power, of wheat-grain size and low cost. Yet its frequency limitations, a few hundred kilocycles, and its strict power limitations will never permit its general replacement of the Audion amplifier.&quot; – 1952
* &quot;I came, I saw, I invented—it&#x27;s that simple—no need to sit and think—it&#x27;s all in your imagination.&quot;

<text>Barnaby Evans (born 1953) is an American artist who works in many media including site-specific sculpture installations, photography, film, garden design, architectural projects, writing and conceptual works. Evans is known for WaterFire, a sculpture that he installed on the three rivers of downtown Providence, Rhode Island.

== Work ==
His original training was in the sciences, but he has been working exclusively as an artist for more than twenty-five years.
In 1994, he created First Fire to celebrate the tenth anniversary of First Night Providence; in June 1996, he created Second Fire for the International Sculpture Conference and the Convergence International Arts Festival in Providence. With hundreds of volunteers and the broad support of the community he established WaterFire as an ongoing installation in 1997. Evans also created WaterFire Houston in 1998 and installed Moving Water for the Institute of Contemporary Art&#x27;s Vita Brevis Program in Boston in 2001. Among other installation works, Barnaby Evans created Temple to Milk in 1989, Protecting the Flag in 1990, Execution Coda (with artist Irene Lawrence) in 1993, and Solstice Courtyard in 1997. Evans created Rikyu&#x27;s Second Dream for the Rhode Island School of Design Museum of Art for the summer of 1999, a related work, 613 Lengths of Bamboo, at the Brattleboro Museum of Art, and Heart of Glass for the Museum of Glass in Tacoma, Washington, both in 2001. Evans is currently exploring art installations for a number of other cities including St. Petersburg, Barcelona, and Seoul.

Barnaby Evans is also known for his photography which is included in the permanent collections of the Victoria and Albert Museum, London; the Bibliothèque nationale, Paris; the Musee&#x27; d&#x27;art et d&#x27;histoire, Fribourg, Switzerland; the Addison Gallery of American Art, Andover, Massachusetts; and the Museum of Art, Rhode Island School of Design among others. His photographs have also been nationally and internationally exhibited and published in &quot;Camera&quot;, Lucerne, Switzerland; &quot;Photokina&quot;, Cologne, Germany; &quot;Photography Annual&quot;, New York; and &quot;Schweizerische Photorundschau&quot; / &quot;Revue Suisse de Photographie&quot;.

Barnaby Evans received his bachelor&#x27;s degree in biology and environmental science from Brown University in 1975, where he was a member of the Brown Association for Cooperative Housing. He was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Humanities by Brown University and an honorary Doctorate of Fine Arts by Rhode Island College, both in 2000. Evans has also received the Aaron Siskind Fellowship in Photography, several fellowships from the Rhode Island State Council on the Arts, the Silver Prize for Colour Photography at the International Triennial Exhibition (in Switzerland) and Providence&#x27;s Renaissance Award in 1997. Evans received the 2003 Kevin Lynch Award from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and WaterFire was honored with the 2003 Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence silver medal from the Bruner Foundation, given to Providence for the renaissance of its downtown. Evans has lectured at many universities including Brown University, the Rhode Island School of Design, MIT, Harvard, Cornell, McGill, and the University of Barcelona. Evans was a 2003/2004 Artist in Residence at MIT where he co-taught a course at the Department of Urban Studies with the late Mark Schuster at MIT on the impact of ephemera on the urban environment. In 2008 Evans created a new work on the Boston Common for First Night Boston. Evans was inducted into the Rhode Island Heritage Hall of Fame in 2011.

<text>Fulton John Sheen (born Peter John Sheen, May 8, 1895 – December 9, 1979) was an American bishop of the Catholic Church known for his preaching and especially his work on television and radio. Ordained a priest of the Diocese of Peoria in Illinois, in 1919, Sheen quickly became a renowned theologian, earning the Cardinal Mercier Prize for International Philosophy in 1923. He went on to teach theology and philosophy at the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C. and served as a parish priest before he was appointed auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York in 1951. He held this position until 1966 when he was made bishop of the Diocese of Rochester in New York. He resigned as bishop of Rochester in 1969 as his 75th birthday approached and was made archbishop of the titular see of Newport, Wales.

For 20 years as &quot;Father Sheen&quot;, later monsignor, he hosted the night-time radio program &quot;The Catholic Hour&quot; on NBC (1930–1950) before he moved to television and presented &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot; (1952–1957). Sheen&#x27;s final presenting role was on the syndicated &quot;The Fulton Sheen Program&quot; (1961–1968) with a format that was very similar to that of the earlier &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot; show. For that work, Sheen twice won an Emmy Award for Most Outstanding Television Personality, and was featured on the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine. Starting in 2009, his shows were being re-broadcast on the EWTN and the Trinity Broadcasting Network&#x27;s Church Channel cable networks. His contribution to televised preaching resulted in Sheen often being called one of the first televangelists.

The cause for his canonization was officially opened in 2002. In June 2012, Pope Benedict XVI officially recognized a decree from the Congregation for the Causes of Saints stating that he lived a life of &quot;heroic virtues,&quot; a major step towards beatification, and he is now referred to as venerable. On July 5, 2019, Pope Francis approved a reputed miracle that occurred through the intercession of Sheen, clearing the way for his beatification. Sheen was scheduled to be beatified in Peoria on December 21, 2019, but his beatification was postponed after Bishop Salvatore Matano of Rochester expressed concern that Sheen&#x27;s handling of a 1963 sexual misconduct case against a priest might be cited unfavorably in a forthcoming report from the New York Attorney General. The Diocese of Peoria countered that Sheen&#x27;s handling of the case had already been &quot;thoroughly examined&quot; and &quot;exonerated&quot; and that Sheen had &quot;never put children in harm&#x27;s way&quot;.

==Early life==
Fulton Sheen was born on May 8, 1895, in El Paso, Illinois, the oldest of four sons of Newton and Delia Sheen. His parents were of Irish descent, and their own parents were from Croghan, County Roscommon, Connacht. He was known as &quot;Fulton&quot;, his mother&#x27;s maiden name, but he was baptized as &quot;Peter John Sheen&quot;. As an infant, Sheen contracted tuberculosis. 

After the family had moved to nearby Peoria, Illinois, Sheen&#x27;s first role in the Catholic Church was as an altar boy at Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Peoria.

Sheen graduated in 1913 from high school at Spalding Institute in Peoria with valedictorian honors. He then entered St. Viator College in Bourbonnais, Illinois. Deciding to become a priest, he started his studies at Saint Paul Seminary in St. Paul, Minnesota.

== Ordination and further education ==
Sheen was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Peoria at the Cathedral of Saint Mary in Peoria on September 20, 1919 by Bishop Edmund Dunne. After his 1919 ordination, Sheen continued his studies at the Catholic University of America. He celebrated his first Christmas Mass at St. Mark Parish in Peoria His youthful appearance was still evident on one occasion when a local priest asked Sheen to assist as altar boy during the celebration of the mass.

After finishing his studies at Catholic University of America, he entered the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, earning a Doctor of Philosophy degree in 1923. His thesis was titled &quot;The Spirit of Contemporary Philosophy and the Finite God&quot;. At Leuven, he became the first American to win the Cardinal Mercier Prize for the best philosophical treatise. In 1924, Sheen went to Rome to attend the Pontificium Collegium Internationale Angelicum, where he was awarded a Doctor of Sacred Theology degree.

==Priestly life==
After Sheen returned to Peoria in 1926, Bishop Dunn assigned him as curate at St. Patrick&#x27;s, a poor parish in Peoria. At that time, both Columbia University in New York and Oxford University in England wanted him to teach philosophy. Sheen took the assignment at St. Patrick&#x27;s without any complaints and later said that he enjoyed his time there. Nine months later, Dunne summoned Sheen to his office. Dunne told him:I promised you to Catholic University over a year ago. They told me that with all your traipsing around Europe, you&#x27;d be so high hat you couldn&#x27;t take orders. But Father Cullen says you&#x27;ve been a good boy at St. Patrick&#x27;s. So run along to Washington.Instead of Catholic University of America, Sheen went to teach theology at St. Edmund&#x27;s College, Ware, in England where he met Ronald Knox. He also assisted the pastor at St. Patrick&#x27;s Church in the Soho section of London. In 1928, Sheen finally returned to the Catholic University of America, where he would teach philosophy until 1950.

In 1929, Sheen gave a speech at a meeting of the National Catholic Educational Association in which he encouraged teachers to &quot;educate for a Catholic Renaissance&quot; in the United States. Sheen was hoping that Catholics would become more influential in their country through education, which would help attract others to the faith. He believed that Catholics should &quot;integrate&quot; their faith into the rest of their daily life.

===Bishop and archbishop===
Sheen was consecrated a bishop on June 11, 1951 and served as an auxiliary bishop of the Archdiocese of New York from 1951 to 1966. The principal consecrator was the Discalced Carmelite Cardinal Adeodato Giovanni Piazza, the Cardinal-Bishop of Sabina e Poggio Mirteto and the Secretary of the Sacred Consistorial Congregation (now the Dicastery for Bishops). The co-consecrators were Archbishop Leone Giovanni Battista Nigris, Titular Archbishop of Philippi and the Secretary of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith (now the Dicastery for Evangelization); and Archbishop Martin John O&#x27;Connor, Titular Archbishop of Laodicea in Syria and President Emeritus of the Pontifical Council for Social Communications.

In 1966, Sheen was made the Bishop of Rochester. He served in this position from October 21, 1966, to October 6, 1969, when he resigned and was made the archbishop of the titular see of Newport, Wales.

===Ecumenical efforts===
In the 1950s and 1960s, Sheen was notable for early efforts seeking common ground with Christians from non-Roman churches, both Eastern and Protestant. He occasionally celebrated Byzantine Divine Liturgy, with papal permission awarding him certain bi-ritual faculties. He often commended Protestant devotion to Bible study: &quot;The first subject of all to be studied is Scripture, and this demands not only the reading of it but the study of commentaries. ... Protestant commentaries, I discovered, were also particularly interesting because Protestants have spent more time on Scripture than most of us.&quot; His autobiography summarized his ecumenical outlook: &quot;The combination of travel, the study of world religions and personal encounter with different nationalities and peoples made me see that the fullness of truth is like a complete circle of 360 degrees. Every religion in the world has a segment of that truth.&quot;

A popular instructor, Sheen wrote the first of 73 books in 1925 and in 1930 began a weekly NBC Sunday-night radio broadcast, &quot;The Catholic Hour&quot;. Sheen called World War II not only a political struggle but also a &quot;theological one&quot;. He referred to Adolf Hitler as an example of the &quot;Anti-Christ&quot;. Two decades later, the broadcast had a weekly listening audience of four million people. &quot;Time&quot; referred to him in 1946 as &quot;the golden-voiced Msgr. Fulton J. Sheen, U.S. Catholicism&#x27;s famed proselytizer&quot;, and reported that his radio broadcast received 3,000–6,000 letters weekly from listeners. During the middle of that era, he narrated the first religious service broadcast on the new medium of television and put into motion a new avenue for his religious pursuits.

===Television===

At the Catholic University of America, Sheen provided voice-over commentary for an Easter Sunday Mass in 1940, one of the first televised religious services. During the sermon, which was telecast on experimental station W2XBS, Sheen remarked, &quot;This is the first religious television in the history of the world. Let therefore its first message be a tribute of thanks to God for giving the minds of our day the inspiration to unravel the secrets of the universe.&quot;

On February 12, 1952, he began a weekly television program on the DuMont Television Network, &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot;. Filmed at the Adelphi Theatre in New York City, the program consisted of the unpaid Sheen simply speaking in front of a live audience without a script or cue cards and occasionally using a chalkboard.

The show, scheduled in a prime time slot on Tuesday nights at 8:00 p.m., was not expected to challenge the ratings giants Milton Berle and Frank Sinatra but did surprisingly well. Berle, who was known to many early television viewers as &quot;Uncle Miltie&quot; and for using ancient vaudeville material, joked about Sheen, &quot;He uses old material, too.&quot; He also observed, &quot;If I&#x27;m going to be eased off the top by anyone, it&#x27;s better that I lose to the One for whom Bishop Sheen is speaking.&quot; Sheen responded in jest that maybe people should start calling him &quot;Uncle Fultie&quot;. &quot;Life&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazines ran feature stories on Sheen. The number of stations carrying &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot; jumped from three to fifteen in less than two months. There was fan mail that flowed in at a rate of 8,500 letters per week. There were four times as many requests for tickets as could be fulfilled. Admiral, the sponsor, paid the production costs in return for a one-minute commercial at the show&#x27;s opening and another minute at its close. In 1952, Sheen won an Emmy Award for his efforts and accepted the acknowledgment by saying, &quot;I feel it is time I pay tribute to my four writers – Matthew, Mark, Luke and John.&quot; When Sheen won the Emmy, Berle quipped, &quot;We both work for &#x27;Sky Chief, a reference to Berle&#x27;s sponsor, Texaco. &quot;Time&quot; called him &quot;the first &#x27;televangelist and the Archdiocese of New York could not meet the demand for tickets.

One of his best-remembered presentations came in February 1953, when he forcefully denounced the Soviet regime of Joseph Stalin. Sheen gave a dramatic reading of the burial scene from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; that substituted the names of prominent Soviet leaders Stalin, Lavrenty Beria, Georgy Malenkov, and Andrey Vyshinsky for the original Caesar, Cassius, Marc Antony, and Brutus. He concluded by saying, &quot;Stalin must one day meet his judgment.&quot; Days later, the dictator suffered a stroke, and he died within the week.

Indeed, Sheen was often quick to rebuke what he considered wrongful conduct. For example, in his televised sermon &quot;False Compassion&quot;, he shouted: &quot;There are sob sisters; there are the social slobberers who insist on compassion being shown to the muggers, to the dope fiends, to the throat slashers, to the beatniks, to the prostitutes, to the homosexuals, to the punks, so that today the decent man is practically off the reservation.&quot; He then clarified his criticism and charged his viewers with the responsibility to &quot;hate the sin ... and love the sinner.&quot;

The show ran until 1957 and drew as many as 30 million people weekly, mostly non-Catholics. In 1958, Sheen became the national director of the Society for the Propagation of the Faith, serving for eight years before being appointed Bishop of the Diocese of Rochester, New York, on October 26, 1966. He also hosted a nationally-syndicated series, &quot;The Fulton Sheen Program&quot;, from 1961 to 1968, first in black-and-white and later in color. The format of the series was essentially the same as &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot;.

===International cassette tape ministry===
In September 1974, the Archbishop of Washington, Thomas William Lyons, asked Sheen to be the speaker for a retreat for diocesan priests at the Loyola Retreat House in Faulkner, Maryland. It was recorded on reel-to-reel tape, which was then state-of-the-art.

Sheen requested for the recorded talks to be produced for distribution. This was the first production of a worldwide cassette tape ministry called Ministr-O-Media, a nonprofit company that operated on the grounds of St. Joseph&#x27;s Parish, Pomfret, Maryland. The retreat album was &quot;Renewal and Reconciliation&quot; and included nine 60-minute audiotapes.

===Evangelization===
Sheen was credited with helping convert a number of notable figures to the Catholic faith, including the agnostic writer Heywood Broun, politician Clare Boothe Luce, automaker Henry Ford II, ex-communist writer Louis F. Budenz, ex-communist organizer Bella Dodd, theatrical designer Jo Mielziner, violinist and composer Fritz Kreisler, and actress Virginia Mayo. Each conversion process took an average of 25 hours of lessons, and reportedly more than 95% of his students in private instruction were baptized.

==Falling-out with Cardinal Spellman==
According to the foreword written for a 2008 edition of Sheen&#x27;s autobiography, &quot;Treasure in Clay: The Autobiography of Fulton J. Sheen&quot;, the Catholic journalist Raymond Arroyo wrote why Sheen &quot;retired&quot; from hosting &quot;Life Is Worth Living&quot; &quot;at the height of its popularity[...] [when] an estimated 30 million viewers and listeners tuned in each week.&quot; Arroyo wrote that &quot;It is widely believed that Cardinal Spellman drove Sheen off the air.&quot;

Arroyo relates: &quot;In the late 1950s, the government donated millions of dollars&#x27; worth of powdered milk to the New York Archdiocese. In turn, Cardinal Spellman handed that milk over to the Society for the Propagation of the Faith to distribute to the poor of the world. On at least one occasion, he demanded that the director of the Society, Bishop Sheen, the Archdiocese for the donated milk. He wanted millions of dollars. Despite Cardinal Spellman&#x27;s considerable powers of persuasion and influence in Rome, Sheen refused. These were funds donated by the public to the missions, funds Sheen himself had personally contributed to and raised over the airwaves. He felt an obligation to protect them, even from the itchy fingers of his own Cardinal.&quot;

Spellman later took the issue directly to Pope Pius XII by pleading his case with Sheen present. The Pope sided with Sheen. Spellman later confronted Sheen and stated, &quot;I will get even with you. It may take six months or ten years, but everyone will know what you are like.&quot; Besides being pressured to leave television, Sheen also &quot;found himself unwelcome in the churches of New York City. Spellman canceled Sheen&#x27;s annual Good Friday sermons at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and discouraged clergy from befriending the Bishop.&quot; In 1966, Spellman had Sheen reassigned to Rochester, New York, and caused his leadership at the Society for the Propagation of the Faith to be terminated although it was a position that he had held for 16 years, he had raised hundreds of millions of dollars for it, and he had personally donated $10million of his earnings to it. On December 2, 1967, Spellman died in New York City.

Sheen never talked about the situation and made only vague references to his &quot;trials both inside and outside the Church&quot;. In his autobiography, he even went so far as to praise Spellman.

==Later years==
While serving in Rochester, he created the Sheen Ecumenical Housing Foundation. He also spent some of his energy on political activities such as his denunciation of the Vietnam War in late July 1967. On Ash Wednesday in 1967, Sheen decided to give St. Bridget&#x27;s Parish building to the federal Housing and Urban Development program. Sheen wanted to let the government use it for black Americans. There was a protest since Sheen acted on his own accord. The pastor disagreed by saying, &quot;There is enough empty property around without taking down the church and the school.&quot; The deal fell through.

On October 15, 1969, one month after celebrating his 50th anniversary as a priest, Sheen resigned from his Rochester position. He was then appointed archbishop of the titular see of Newport, Wales () by Pope Paul VI. The ceremonial position gave him a promotion to archbishop and helped him continue his extensive writing. Sheen wrote 73 books and numerous articles and columns.

On October 2, 1979, two months before Sheen&#x27;s death, Pope John Paul II visited St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York City, embraced Sheen, and said, &quot;You have written and spoken well of the Lord Jesus Christ. You are a loyal son of the Church.&quot;

==Death and legacy==
Beginning in 1977, Sheen &quot;underwent a series of surgeries that sapped his strength and even made preaching difficult&quot;. Throughout that time, he continued to work on his autobiography, parts of which &quot;were recited from his sickbed as he clutched a crucifix.&quot; Soon after an open-heart surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital, Sheen died on December 9, 1979, in his private chapel while praying before the Blessed Sacrament. He was interred in the crypt of St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral near the deceased archbishops of New York, including Spellman. On June 27, 2019, Sheen&#x27;s remains were transferred to The Cathedral of St. Mary in Peoria, IL, where his cause is being promoted for sainthood.

The official repository of Sheen&#x27;s papers, television programs, and other materials is at St. Bernard&#x27;s School of Theology and Ministry in Rochester, New York.

Joseph Campanella introduced the reruns of Sheen&#x27;s various programs that are aired on EWTN. Reruns are also aired on the Trinity Broadcasting Network. In addition to his television appearances, Sheen can be heard on Relevant Radio.

The Fulton J. Sheen Museum, which is operated by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Peoria and located in Peoria, Illinois, houses the largest set of Sheen&#x27;s personal items in five collections. The museum is located one block south of Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception, where Sheen served as an altar boy, had his first communion and confirmation, was ordained and celebrated his first Mass. Another museum is located in Sheen&#x27;s hometown of El Paso, Illinois. The museum contains various Sheen artifacts but is not connected to the Diocese of Peoria.

The Sheen Center for Thought &amp; Culture, along Bleecker Street in Lower Manhattan, is named after him.

The actor Ramón Gerard Antonio Estévez adopted the stage name of Martin Sheen partly in admiration of the bishop.

Sheen did much of his preaching at Saint Agnes Church, in Midtown Manhattan, from 1927 to his death. On October 7, 1980, New York Mayor Ed Koch renamed East 43rd Street in front of the church as &quot;Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen Place&quot;.

==Cause for canonization==
The Archbishop Fulton J. Sheen Foundation was formed in 1998 by Gregory J. Ladd and Lawrence F. Hickey to make known the archbishop&#x27;s life. The foundation approached Cardinal John O&#x27;Connor of the Archdiocese of New York for permission to commence the process of his cause, which was under the authority of the Diocese of Peoria. In 2002, Sheen&#x27;s cause for canonization was officially opened by Bishop Daniel R. Jenky, CSC, of the Diocese of Peoria. From then on, Sheen was referred to as a &quot;Servant of God&quot;. On February 2, 2008, the archives of Sheen were sealed at a ceremony during a special Mass at the Cathedral of Saint Mary of the Immaculate Conception in Peoria, Illinois, where the diocese was sponsoring his canonization. In 2009, the diocesan phase of the investigation came to an end, and the records were sent to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints at the Holy See in Rome.

On June 28, 2012, the Holy See announced officially that it had recognized Sheen&#x27;s life as one of &quot;heroic virtue&quot;, a major step towards eventual beatification. From then on, Sheen has been styled &quot;Venerable Servant of God&quot;. According to the Catholic News Service and &quot;The Catholic Post&quot; (the official newspaper of the Peoria Diocese), the case of a newborn boy who had no discernible pulse for 61 minutes, who was about to be declared dead at OSF Saint Francis Medical Center in Peoria, Illinois, as a stillborn infant, and yet lived to be healthy without physical or mental impairment was in the preliminary stages of being investigated as the possible miracle needed for Sheen&#x27;s potential beatification. If the miracle is approved at the diocesan level and then by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints at the Holy See, by being both medically unexplainable and directly attributable theologically to Sheen&#x27;s intercession according to expert panels in both subject areas, beatification may proceed. Another such miracle would be required for him to be considered for canonization.

On September 7, 2011, a tribunal of inquiry was sworn in to investigate the alleged healing. During a special Mass at 10:30 am on Sunday, December 11, 2011, at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Peoria, the documentation gathered by the tribunal over nearly three months was boxed and sealed. It was then shipped to the Holy See for consideration by the Congregation for the Causes of Saints, concluding the diocesan tribunal&#x27;s work.

On Sunday, September 9, 2012, a Mass of Thanksgiving and banquet was held at St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral and the Spalding Pastoral Center in celebration of the advancement of Archbishop Sheen&#x27;s cause. Attendees included Bishop Jenky, and his predecessor as Bishop of Peoria, Archbishop John J. Myers of Newark, New Jersey, along with many clergy and religious from around the country. Copies of the &quot;positio&quot;, the book detailing the documentation behind his cause, were presented to Myers, representatives of the Church in other states, a delegate from the Archdiocese of Chicago, and other patrons and supporters of Sheen&#x27;s cause. According to statements made during the service by clergy connected to the cause, the medical and theological study of the possible miracles needed for his beatification and canonization was well underway. At least one was being seriously considered. New procedures under Pope Benedict XVI stated that beatification should ideally occur in the candidate&#x27;s home diocese. Therefore, Sheen&#x27;s beatification would likely take place in Peoria, where it would be the first. If he is beatified and canonized, he would be among a select few natives of the US to hold that distinction.

===Transfer of remains===

In September 2014, it was announced that the canonization cause would be suspended because of a disagreement with the Archdiocese of New York concerning the return of Sheen&#x27;s remains to the Diocese of Peoria. In a press release on June 14, 2016, it was announced that Sheen&#x27;s surviving family petitioned the New York Supreme Court to allow the transfer of Sheen&#x27;s remains to Peoria. The press release stated that &quot;on several occasions, the Archdiocese [of New York] has declared its desire to cooperate with the wishes of the family.&quot;

In an action brought in New York Supreme Court, the trial-level court in New York, on November 16, 2016, Justice Arlene P. Bluth ordered the Archdiocese of New York to grant permission to disinter Sheen&#x27;s body. The court ruled that the archdiocese&#x27;s objection that Sheen would not want the disinterment was without factual basis. Given that his elevation to sainthood was being blocked, the court found the family had sufficient justification for moving his body.

However, on February 6, 2018, the New York State Appellate Division overturned Bluth&#x27;s decision and ordered an evidentiary hearing be held as to whether moving Sheen&#x27;s body would be consistent with his wishes. The court noted that &quot;it is unclear if Archbishop Sheen&#x27;s direction in his will to be buried in &#x27;Calvary Cemetery, the official cemetery of the Archdiocese of New York&#x27; evinces an express intention to remain buried in the Archdiocese of New York, or was merely a descriptive term for Calvary Cemetery.&quot; However, after re-examining the case and holding the evidentiary hearing on June 9, 2018, Bluth affirmed her earlier ruling. The archdiocese had allowed Peoria to begin the work on his cause for canonization, which eventually would have required at the least a collection of his relics.

The Archdiocese of New York announced on June 9, 2019 that it was officially giving up the fight to keep Sheen&#x27;s remains under the altar at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in New York. On June 27, 2019, the remains were transferred to St. Mary&#x27;s Cathedral in Peoria.

===Miracle recognized for beatification===
On July 6, 2019, the Congregation for the Causes of Saints promulgated the decree approving Sheen&#x27;s miracle needed for beatification. The miracle involved the unexplained recovery of James Fulton Engstrom, a boy stillborn in September 2010 to Bonnie and Travis Engstrom of the town of Goodfield, near Peoria. Engstrom&#x27;s parents prayed for the intercession of Sheen for their son&#x27;s recovery. Pope Francis approved the miracle, and Sheen was scheduled for beatification on December 21, 2019, at the Cathedral of St. Mary in Peoria.

===Postponement of beatification===
On December 3, 2019, the Diocese of Peoria announced that the Holy See had decided on December 2 that Sheen&#x27;s beatification would be &quot;postponed&quot;. The postponement was prompted by Salvatore Matano, Bishop of Rochester, who expressed concern that his predecessor&#x27;s handling of a 1963 sexual misconduct case against a priest might be cited unfavorably in a report from New York State Attorney General Letitia James. The Diocese of Peoria countered that Sheen&#x27;s handling of the case had already been &quot;thoroughly examined&quot; and &quot;exonerated&quot; and that Sheen had &quot;never put children in harm&#x27;s way.&quot; The Diocese of Peoria continues to promote the beatification of Sheen.

As of August 2023, the Holy See had not announced whether or when the beatification would move ahead. As of April 2024, New York State&#x27;s Rochester investigation was still ongoing.

<doc id="256771" wikidata="Q308905" url="?curid=256771" title="Presidency of the Council of the European Union">
<text>The presidency of the Council of the European Union is responsible for the functioning of the Council of the European Union, which is the co-legislator of the EU legislature alongside the European Parliament. It rotates among the member states of the EU every six months. The presidency is not an individual, but rather the position is held by a national government. It is sometimes incorrectly referred to as the &quot;president of the European Union&quot;. The presidency&#x27;s function is to chair meetings of the council, determine its agendas, set a work program and facilitate dialogue both at Council meetings and with other EU institutions. The presidency is currently, as of January 2025, held by Poland.

Three successive presidencies are known as &quot;presidency trios&quot;. The current trio is made up of Poland (January–June 2025), Denmark (July–December 2025), and Cyprus (January–June 2026). The 2020 German presidency began the second cycle of presidencies, after the system was introduced in 2007.

==History==
When the council was established, its work was minimal and the presidency rotated between each of the then six members every six months. However, as the work load of the Council grew and the membership increased, the lack of coordination between each successive six-month presidency hindered the development of long-term priorities for the EU.

In order to rectify the lack of coordination, the idea of trio presidencies was put forward where groups of three successive presidencies cooperated on a common political program. This was implemented in 2007 and formally laid down in the EU treaties in 2009 by the Treaty of Lisbon.

Until 2009, the Presidency had assumed political responsibility in all areas of European integration and it played a vital role in brokering high-level political decisions.

The Treaty of Lisbon reduced the importance of the Presidency significantly by officially separating the European Council from the Council of the European Union. Simultaneously it split the foreign affairs Council configuration from the General Affairs configuration and created the position of High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

After the United Kingdom&#x27;s vote to leave the European Union in 2016 and its subsequent relinquishment of its scheduled presidency in the Council of the European Union which was due to take place from July to December 2017, the rotation of presidencies was brought six months forward. Estonia was scheduled to take over the UK&#x27;s six-month slot instead. The presidency is currently (as of January 2025) held by Poland.

==Functioning==

The Council meets in various formations where its composition depends on the topic discussed. For example, the Agriculture Council is composed of the national ministers responsible for Agriculture.

The primary responsibility of the Presidency is to organise and chair all meetings of the council, apart from the Foreign Affairs Council which is chaired by the High Representative. So, for instance, the Minister of Agriculture for the state holding the presidency chairs the Agriculture council. This role includes working out compromises capable of resolving difficulties.

 provides:
Each three successive presidencies cooperate on a &quot;triple-shared presidency&quot; work together over an 18-month period to accomplish a common agenda by the current president simply continuing the work of the previous &quot;lead-president&quot; after the end of his/her term. This ensures more consistency in comparison to a usual single six-month presidency and each three includes a new member state. This allows new member states to hold the presidency sooner and helps old member states pass their experience to the new members.

The role of the rotating Council Presidency includes:
* agenda-setting powers: in its 6-month programme, it decides on the order to discuss propositions, after they have been submitted by the Commission in its agenda monopoly powers
* brokering inter-institutional compromise: Formal Trilogue meetings between Commission, Parliament and Council are held to reach early consensus in the codecision legislative procedure; the Presidency takes part to the Conciliation Committee between Parliament and Council in the third stage of the codecision legislative procedure
* coordinating national policies and brokering compromise between member states in the council (&quot;confessional system&quot;)
* management and administration of the council, external and internal representation

Holding the rotating Council Presidency includes both advantages and disadvantages for member states;
The opportunities include:
# member states have the possibility to show their negotiating skills, as &quot;honest brokers&quot;, thus gaining influence and prestige
# member states gain a privileged access to information: at the end of their term, they know member states&#x27; preferences better than anyone else
# the Council programme may enable member states to focus Council discussion on issues of particular national/regional interest (for example Finland and the Northern Dimension initiative)

The burdens include:
# lack of administrative capacities and experience, especially for small and new member states; the concept of &quot;trio&quot;/&quot;troika&quot; has been introduced to enable member states to share experiences and ensure coherence on an 18-months base
# expenses in time and money, needed to support the administrative machine
# not being able to push through their own interests, as the role of Council Presidency is seen as an impartial instance; member states trying to push for initiatives of their own national interest are likely to see them failing in the medium run (for example the French 2008 Presidency and the Union for the Mediterranean project), as they need consensus and do not have enough time to reach it. This element is particularly substantial: holding the presidency may be, on balance, a disadvantage for member states

<text>Wu Bangguo (22 July 1941 – 8 October 2024) was a Chinese politician who served as the second-ranking member of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party from 2002 to 2012, and as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress from 2003 to 2013.

Wu was an electrical engineer by profession, and rose to political prominence during his work in Shanghai. During the early 1980s, he was in charge of science and technology related work in Shanghai, where he worked with Jiang Zemin, then mayor and later Party secretary of the city, leading Wu to be affiliated with Jiang&#x27;s political faction. He became Shanghai&#x27;s party secretary in 1991, succeeding Zhu Rongji, leading him to assume a seat in the CCP Politburo in 1992.

He became the country&#x27;s third-ranking Vice Premier of the State Council in 1995, with a portfolio including state-owned enterprises and the construction of the Three Gorges Dam. He joined the Politburo Standing Committee in 2002, and was appointed the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress in 2003. Serving as one of the highest-ranking officials under Party general secretary Hu Jintao, Wu is generally regarded to have taken more conservative positions towards political reforms during his tenure. He stepped down from the Politburo Standing Committee in 2012, and was succeeded by Zhang Dejiang as Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress in 2013.

==Early life==
Wu was born in 22 July 1941, in Pingba, Guizhou, with ancestral roots in Feidong, Anhui. His father Wu Zhongxing was a cartographer working on map projection. He entered Tsinghua University in 1960, majoring in electron tube engineering at the Department of Radio Electronics, where he graduated in 1967. He joined the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) in 1964. After graduation, he was employed as a worker and technician at Shanghai&#x27;s No. 3 Electronic Tube Factory, and then deputy chief and chief of the technical section from 1976 to 1978. He would eventually go on to lead the factory as its party secretary. In 1978 he was assigned to become the deputy manager of Shanghai Electronic Elements Company, and between 1979 and 1981 the deputy manager of Shanghai Electron Tube Company. Between 1981 and 1983 he worked as the deputy secretary of Shanghai Meters, Instruments and Telecommunications Bureau.

==Political career==
Wu&#x27;s work in electronics companies earned him a tenure in the city&#x27;s upper echelons of power. He became part of the Standing Committee of the Shanghai party committee in 1983, effectively becoming part of Shanghai&#x27;s political inner circle, and was put in charge of work related to science and technology. During this time, he worked with Jiang Zemin, who was mayor and later the CCP secretary of the city. Between 1985 and 1991, Wu was elevated to CCP deputy secretary of Shanghai, and subsequently as CCP secretary of Shanghai, succeeding Jiang. During his tenure in Shanghai, he was seen as the official most responsible for developing the Pudong New Area.

As Shanghai&#x27;s political and economic stature grew due to economic reforms, Wu gained a seat on the Politburo of the Chinese Communist Party, China&#x27;s ruling council, in 1992. He was subsequently appointed the third-ranking vice premier in 1995 under premier Li Peng. During this period, he served in a portfolio dealing with industry and reforming state-owned enterprises, and also oversaw the Three Gorges Dam. He continued as vice premier under Zhu Rongji, and served as the role until 2003.

== Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress ==
At the 16th Party Congress in November 2002, Wu entered the highest power elite in the country, ranking second in the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, only under then general secretary Hu Jintao. In 2003, at the first session of the 10th National People&#x27;s Congress, he was appointed as the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress. At the first session of the 11th National People&#x27;s Congress, he was re-elected as Chairman of the NPC Standing Committee on 15 March 2008, becoming the first person to serve as the NPCSC Chair for more than two terms since Zhu De.

During his tenure, Wu was generally regarded as a member of the Shanghai clique and an associate of Jiang Zemin, generally taking a conservative approach towards reform. He was also described as having a low-key profile during his time in office.

During a speech about the Hong Kong Basic Law in the territory in June 2007, Wu warned that Hong Kong will only have as much authority as granted from Beijing, and that the Special Administrative Region&#x27;s government is an executive-led model and should not blindly follow Western systems. He also stated that the Central Government supported Hong Kong&#x27;s development of democracy, so long as it is within the boundaries of the Hong Kong Basic Law. Although the remarks were left open to interpretation, they generated significant controversy in Hong Kong, with pro-democracy politicians calling it a challenge on the autonomy of the territory.

In his capacity as NPCSC chair, Wu delivered an annual address each year at the National People&#x27;s Congress sessions in March. These speeches have always noted that China will not adopt multiparty democracy, separation of powers, or a federal system. In 2011, Wu proposed the &quot;five don&#x27;ts () by declaring that &quot;[w]e have made a solemn declaration that we will not employ a system of multiple parties holding office in rotation, diversification of guiding ideology, separation of powers and bicameralism, federalism or privatization&quot;.

On 16 July 2012, Wu attended the launch ceremony of Shenzhou 9 crewed spacecraft.

Wu retired from the CCP Politburo Standing Committee at the 18th Party Congress in November 2012, and was succeeded as NPCSC chairman by Zhang Dejiang in March 2013. In his last speech as the NPCSC chair, he said that &quot;we will absolutely not copy models in the Western political system&quot;.

== Post-retirement ==
Similar to other retired top-ranking officials in China, Wu stopped making public appearances except to attend important events such as the National Day celebration. In March 2015, Wu was pictured visiting a rapeseed farm in Wuyuan, Jiangxi province.

Wu died at 4:36 am on 8 October 2024, at the age of 83. A farewell ceremony was held on 14 October; Xi Jinping, Li Qiang, Zhao Leji, Wang Huning, Cai Qi, Ding Xuexiang, Li Xi, Han Zheng and other leaders paid their final respects at the Babaoshan Revolutionary Cemetery, while Hu Jintao sent a wreath. His body was cremated on the same day. National flags were flown at half-mast at Chinese government buildings, diplomatic missions, and in Hong Kong and Macau.

<text>Barry Edward Dempster (born 17 January 1952) is a Canadian poet, novelist, and editor.

== Career ==
Barry Dempster was born in Toronto, Ontario, and educated in child psychology. He is the author of two novels, a children&#x27;s book, three volumes of short stories, and sixteen collections of poetry. Dempster&#x27;s prose was first noticed by renowned Canadian editor and writer, John Metcalf, for his anthology &quot;Third Impressions&quot; (Oberon Press) in which Metcalf showcased three promising young authors. A contract from Oberon Press soon followed for the publication of two collections of highly praised short stories. Quarry Press came forward with an offer to publish his first novel, &quot;The Ascension of Jesse Rapture&quot;, which also received excellent reviews.

Dempster has twice been nominated for the Governor General&#x27;s Award for literature—for his first book, Fables for Isolated Men (Guernica, 1982), and for &quot;The Burning Alphabet&quot; (Brick Books, 2005), which also won the Canadian Authors Association Jack Chalmers Award for poetry. In 2010 and 2015 he was a finalist for the Ontario Premier&#x27;s Award of Excellence in the Arts. In 2013, Dempster was a finalist for his second novel, &quot;The Outside World,&quot; (Pedlar Press, 2013) for Ontario&#x27;s Trillium Award.

From 1990 to 1997, he was poetry and reviews editor for &quot;Poetry Canada,&quot; which quickly became one of Canada&#x27;s most esteemed literary magazines. For over 10 years, he was the mainstay of the publication in the role of reviews editor and then poetry and reviews editor, as it changed ownership and staff. During this time, Dempster became known for his helpful, supportive letters to submitting writers, his astute book reviews and his &quot;New Voice&quot; discoveries of some of Canada&#x27;s finest poets.

From 1999 to 2018, he was senior acquisitions editor with Brick Books, where he discovered and edited many of Canada&#x27;s finest emerging and established poets. His editorial successes include a Griffin Prize winner and a Griffin nominee; he has also edited a Governor General&#x27;s Award winning collection as well as a collection that won the 2005 Trillium Award.

Equally comfortable working in prose and poetry, Dempster also has extensive experience as a creative writing instructor. He has been on the faculty at The Banff Centre as mentor for the Writing Studio, Wired Writing and Writing with Styles programs, and has twice been the writer-in-residence at the Richmond Hill Public Library. He has run hundreds of workshops in Ontario elementary and high schools, as well as teaching at the Upper Canada Writers&#x27; Workshop in Kingston, Ontario and Sage Hill, Saskatchewan. He has also offered master classes in Santiago, Chile; Victoria, British Columbia; Mahone Bay and Shelbourne, Nova Scotia; Winnipeg, Manitoba; and in Ottawa, Hamilton, Barrie, Holland Landing and Newmarket in Ontario.

&quot;Tread &amp; Other Stories&quot; was shortlisted for the 2019 ReLit Award for short fiction.

Dempster was living in York Region with his wife where he ran a very popular film series &quot;Southlake Cinemania,&quot; which raised funds to support literacy through the arts. He and his wife are now currently living in Grey Bruce.

<doc id="256791" wikidata="Q16001535" url="?curid=256791" title="Accent (sociolinguistics)">
<text>In sociolinguistics, an accent is a way of pronouncing a language that is distinctive to a country, area, social class, or individual. An accent may be identified with the locality in which its speakers reside (a regional or geographical accent), the socioeconomic status of its speakers, their ethnicity (an ethnolect), their caste or social class (a social accent), or influence from their first language (a foreign accent).

Accents typically differ in quality of voice, pronunciation and distinction of vowels and consonants, stress, and prosody. Although grammar, semantics, vocabulary, and other language characteristics often vary concurrently with accent, the word &quot;accent&quot; may refer specifically to the differences in pronunciation, whereas the word &quot;dialect&quot; encompasses the broader set of linguistic differences. &quot;Accent&quot; is often a subset of &quot;dialect&quot;.

==History==
As human beings spread out into isolated communities, stresses and peculiarities develop. Over time, they can develop into identifiable accents. In North America, the interaction of people from many ethnic backgrounds contributed to the formation of the different varieties of North American accents. It is difficult to measure or predict how long it takes an accent to form. Accents from Canada, South Africa, Australia and the United States for example, developed from the combinations of different accents and languages in various societies and their effect on the various pronunciations of British settlers.

Accents may vary within regions of an area in which a uniform language is spoken. In some cases, such as regional accents of English in the United States, accents can be traced back to when an area was settled and by whom. Areas like the city of New Orleans in Louisiana that are, or at one point in time were, semi-isolated have distinct accents due to the absence of contact between regions. Isolated regions allow dialects to expand and evolve independently. Social and economic factors can also influence the way people speak.

==Development==
During the early period of rapid cognitive development in a child&#x27;s life, it is much easier to develop and master foreign skills such as learning a new (or first) language. Verbal cues are processed and silently learned in preparation for the day the vocal system is developed enough to speak its first words (usually around 12 months). Before infants can identify words, they just hear &quot;sounds&quot; that they come to recognize. Eventually neural pathways are established in the brain that link each sound with a meaning. The more frequently a word is heard, the more its connection is solidified and the same goes for accents. There is no &quot;standard&quot; accent for the child to practice; as far as they are concerned, the accent they hear from their parents is not the &quot;right&quot; way but the only way. Eventually children graduate from the conscious act of recalling each word, and it becomes natural, like breathing. As children grow up, they learn vocabulary of the language they are immersed in, whether assisted by parents or not. However, their first few encounters with words determine the way they will pronounce them for the rest of their lives. This is how accents are cultivated in groups as small as towns and as large as countries; it is a compounding effect. Though it is possible to develop a new accent or lose an old one, it is difficult because the neural pathways created when learning the language were developed with the &quot;original&quot; pronunciations.

Children are able to take on accents relatively quickly. Children of immigrant families, for example, generally have a pronunciation more similar to people native to where they live compared to their parents, but both children and parents may have an accent noticeably differing from local people. Accents seem to remain relatively malleable until a person&#x27;s early twenties, after which a person&#x27;s accent seems to become more entrenched.

Nonetheless, accents are not fixed even in adulthood. An acoustic analysis by Jonathan Harrington of Elizabeth II&#x27;s Royal Christmas Messages revealed that the speech patterns of even so conservative a figure as a monarch can continue to change over her lifetime.

==Non-native accents==
Accents of non-native speakers may be the result of the speaker&#x27;s native language. Each language contains distinct sets of sounds. At around 12 months of age, human infants will pick out which sounds they need to learn their language. As they get older it becomes increasingly harder to learn these &quot;forgotten&quot; sounds. A prime example of this can be seen between German and English—the &quot;w&quot; and &quot;th&quot; sounds, like in the English words &quot;wish&quot; and &quot;this&quot; respectively, do not exist in German—the closest sounds are &quot;v&quot; and &quot;z&quot;. As a result, many English-speaking Germans pronounce &quot;wish&quot; as &quot;vish&quot; and &quot;this&quot; as &quot;zis&quot;. A similar disjunction occurs in German-speaking native English speakers, who may find it difficult to pronounce the vowels in German words such as &quot;schön&quot; (beautiful) and &quot;müde&quot; (tired).

An important factor in predicting the degree to which the accent will be noticeable (or strong) is the age at which the non-native language was learned. The critical period theory states that if learning takes place after the critical period (usually considered around puberty) for acquiring native-like pronunciation, an individual is unlikely to acquire a native-like accent. This theory, however, is quite controversial among researchers. Although many subscribe to some form of the critical period, they either place it earlier than puberty or consider it more of a critical &quot;window,&quot; which may vary from one individual to another and depend on factors other than age, such as length of residence, similarity of the non-native language to the native language, and the frequency with which both languages are used.

Nevertheless, children as young as 6 at the time of moving to another country often speak with a noticeable non-native accent as adults. There are also rare instances of individuals who are able to pass for native speakers even if they learned their non-native language in early adulthood. However, neurological constraints associated with brain development appear to limit most non-native speakers&#x27; ability to sound native-like. Most researchers agree that for most adults, acquiring a native-like accent in a non-native language is near impossible.

==Social factors==
When a group defines a standard pronunciation, speakers who deviate from it are often said to &quot;speak with an accent&quot;. However, everyone speaks with an accent. People from the United States would &quot;speak English with an accent&quot; from the point of view of an Australian, and vice versa. Accents such as Received Pronunciation or General American English may sometimes be erroneously designated in their countries of origin as &quot;accentless&quot; to indicate that they offer no obvious clue to the speaker&#x27;s regional or social background.

Accents are an important dimension of social identity, both individual and communal, due to their ability to identify group or community belonging. One&#x27;s accent can showcase their class, religion or sexual orientation.

===Being understood===
Many teachers of English as a second language for example neglect teaching speech and pronunciation. Many adult and near-adult learners of second languages have unintelligible speech patterns that may interfere with their education, profession, and social interactions. Pronunciation in a second or foreign language involves more than the correct articulation of individual sounds. It involves producing a wide range of complex and subtle distinctions which relate sound to meaning at several levels.

Teaching of speech/pronunciation is neglected in part because of the following myths:
* Pronunciation is not important: &quot;This is patently false from any perspective.&quot; Speech/Pronunciation forms the vehicle for transmitting the speaker&#x27;s meaning. If the listener does not understand the message, no communication takes place, and although there are other factors involved, one of the most important is the intelligibility of the speaker&#x27;s pronunciation.
* Students will pick it up on their own: &quot;Some will learn to pronounce the second language intelligibly; many will not.&quot;
Inadequate instruction in speech/pronunciation can result in a complete breakdown in communication. The proliferation of commercial &quot;accent reduction&quot; services is seen as a sign that many ESL teachers are not meeting their students&#x27; needs for speech/pronunciation instruction.

The goals of speech/pronunciation instruction should include: to help the learner speak in a way that is easy to understand and does not distract the listener, to increase the self-confidence of the learner, and to develop the skills to self-monitor and adapt one&#x27;s own speech.

Even when the listener does understand the speaker, the presence of an accent that is difficult to understand can produce anxiety in the listener that he will not understand what comes next, and cause him to end the conversation earlier or avoid difficult topics. &quot;In speech the perceptual salience of the accent overrides other measures of competence and performance,&quot; wrote Ingrid Piller.

Intelligibility of speech, in comparison to native-like accent, has been experimentally reported to be of greater importance for the second language speakers. As such ways of increasing intelligibility of speech has been recommended by some researchers within the field. A strong accent does not necessarily impede intelligibility despite common perceptions.

===Prestige===
Certain accents, particularly those of European heritage, are perceived to carry more prestige in a society than other accents, such that some speakers may as a result consciously adopt them. This is often due to their association with the elite part of society. For example, in the United Kingdom, Received Pronunciation of the English language is associated with the traditional upper class. The same can be said about the predominance of Southeastern Brazilian accents in the case of the Brazilian variant of the Portuguese language, especially considering the disparity of prestige between most &quot;caipira&quot;-influenced speech, associated with rural environment and lack of formal education, together with the Portuguese spoken in some other communities of lower socioeconomic strata such as &quot;favela&quot; dwellers, and other sociocultural variants such as middle and upper class &quot;paulistano&quot; (dialect spoken from Greater São Paulo to the East) and &quot;fluminense&quot; (dialect spoken in the state of Rio de Janeiro) to the other side, inside Southeastern Brazil itself.

In linguistics, there is no differentiation among accents in regard to their prestige, aesthetics, or correctness. All languages and accents are linguistically equal.

===Accent stereotyping and discrimination===
Negative perceptions of accents, the basis of which may relate to the speaker&#x27;s social identity, can manifest as stereotyping, harassment or employment discrimination.

Researchers consistently show that people with non-native accents are judged as less intelligent, less competent, less educated, having poor English/language skills, and unpleasant to listen to. Not only people with standard accents subscribe to these beliefs and attitudes, but individuals with accents also often stereotype against their own or others&#x27; accents. Research demonstrates that an average listener is adept at detecting an accent typical of a language differing from their own.

Accents have even found to be more impactful on perception of babies than known perceptual dividers like race, religion, or sex. In a &quot;PNAS&quot; study, babies were told to choose a toy from two recorded speakers with varying characteristics. Ahead of all variables tested, including race and gender, recordings speaking with an accent native to the child were selected at a considerably higher frequency.

Unlike other forms of discrimination, there are no strong norms against accent discrimination in the general society. Rosina Lippi-Green writes,

Accent serves as the first point of gate keeping because we are forbidden, by law and social custom, and perhaps by a prevailing sense of what is morally and ethically right, from using race, ethnicity, homeland or economics more directly. We have no such compunctions about language, thus, accent becomes a litmus test for exclusion, and excuse to turn away, to recognize the other.

In the English speaking world, speakers with certain accents often experience discrimination in housing and employment. For example, speakers who have foreign or ethnic-minority accents are less likely to be called back by landlords and are more likely to be assigned by employers to lower status positions than those with standard accents. In business settings, individuals with non-standard accents are more likely to be evaluated negatively. Accent discrimination is also present in educational institutions. For example, non-native speaking graduate students, lecturers, and professors, across college campuses in the US have been targeted for being unintelligible because of accent. Second language speakers have reported being discriminated against, or feeling marginalized for, when they attempted to find a job in higher ranking positions mainly because of their accents. On average, however, students taught by non-native English speakers do not underperform when compared to those taught by native speakers of English. Some English native-speaker students in Canada reported a preference for non-native speaker instructors as long as the instructor&#x27;s speech is intelligible. This was due to the psychological impacts such circumstances has on the students requiring them to pay closer attention to the instructor to ensure they understand them.

Studies have shown the perception of the accent, not the accent by itself, often results in negative evaluations of speakers. In a study conducted by Rubin (1992), students listened to a taped lecture recorded by a native English speaker with a standard accent. They were then shown an image of the &quot;lecturer&quot;, sometimes Asian-looking, sometimes white. Participants in the study who saw the Asian picture believed that they had heard an accented lecturer and performed worse on a task that measured lecture comprehension. Negative evaluations may reflect the prejudices rather than real issues with understanding accents.

===Legal implications===
In the United States, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 prohibits discrimination based on national origin, implying accents. However, employers may claim that a person&#x27;s accent impairs their communication skills that are necessary to the effective business operation. The courts often rely on the employer&#x27;s claims or use judges&#x27; subjective opinions when deciding whether the (potential) employee&#x27;s accent would interfere with communication or performance, without any objective proof that accent was or might be a hindrance.

Kentucky&#x27;s highest court in the case of &quot;Clifford vs. Commonwealth&quot; held that a white police officer, who had not seen the black defendant allegedly involved in a drug transaction, could, nevertheless, identify him as a participant by saying that a voice on an audiotape &quot;sounded black&quot;. The police officer based this &quot;identification&quot; on the fact that the defendant was the only African American man in the room at the time of the transaction and that an audio-tape contained the voice of a man the officer said &quot;sounded black&quot; selling crack cocaine to a European American informant planted by the police.

===Acting and accents===
Actors are often called upon to speak a language variety other than their own. For instance, an actor may portray a character of some nationality other than their own by adopting into their native language the phonological profile typical of the nationality to be portrayed, in what is commonly known as &quot;speaking with an accent&quot;. 

Accents may have stereotypical associations in entertainment. For example, in Disney animated films, mothers and fathers typically speak with White, middle-class American or English accents. On another note, English accents in Disney animated films are frequently employed for one of two purposes: slapstick comedy and the portrayal of es. Examples of this can be seen in characters from the films &quot;Aladdin&quot; (the Sultan and Jafar, respectively) and &quot;The Lion King&quot; (Zazu and Scar, respectively), among others.

<doc id="256799" wikidata="Q165740" url="?curid=256799" title="Aphorism">
<text>An aphorism (from Greek ἀφορισμός: &quot;aphorismos&quot;, denoting &#x27;delimitation&#x27;, &#x27;distinction&#x27;, and &#x27;definition&#x27;) is a concise, terse, laconic, or memorable expression of a general truth or principle. Aphorisms are often handed down by tradition from generation to generation. 

The concept is generally distinct from those of an adage, brocard, chiasmus, epigram, maxim (legal or philosophical), principle, proverb, and saying; although some of these concepts could be construed as types of aphorism. 

Often aphorisms are distinguished from other short sayings by the need for interpretation to make sense of them. In &quot;A Theory of the Aphorism&quot;, Andrew Hui defined an aphorism as &quot;a short saying that requires interpretation&quot;. 

A famous example is:

==History==
The word was first used in the &quot;&quot; of Hippocrates, a long series of propositions concerning the symptoms and diagnosis of disease and the art of healing and medicine. The often-cited first sentence of this work is: &quot;&quot; – &quot;life is short, art is long&quot;, usually reversed in order (&quot;Ars longa, vita brevis&quot;).

This aphorism was later applied or adapted to physical science and then morphed into multifarious aphorisms of philosophy, morality, and literature. Currently, an aphorism is generally understood to be a concise and eloquent statement of truth. 

Aphorisms are distinct from axioms: aphorisms generally originate from experience and custom, whereas axioms are self-evident truths and therefore require no additional proof. Aphorisms have been especially used in subjects to which no methodical or scientific treatment was originally applied, such as agriculture, medicine, jurisprudence, and politics.

==Literature==
Aphoristic collections, sometimes known as wisdom literature, have a prominent place in the canons of several ancient societies, such as the Sutra literature of India, the Biblical Ecclesiastes, Islamic hadiths, the golden verses of Pythagoras, Hesiod&#x27;s &quot;Works and Days&quot;, the Delphic maxims, and Epictetus&#x27; Handbook. Aphoristic collections also make up an important part of the work of some modern authors. A 1559 oil–on–oak-panel painting, &quot;Netherlandish Proverbs&quot; (also called &quot;The Blue Cloak&quot; or &quot;The Topsy Turvy World&quot;) by Pieter Bruegel the Elder, artfully depicts a land populated with literal renditions of Flemish aphorisms (proverbs) of the day.

The first noted published collection of aphorisms is &quot;Adagia&quot; by Erasmus. Other important early aphorists were Baltasar Gracián, François de La Rochefoucauld, and Blaise Pascal.

Two influential collections of aphorisms published in the twentieth century were &quot;Unkempt Thoughts&quot; by Stanisław Jerzy Lec (in Polish) and &quot;Itch of Wisdom&quot; by Mikhail Turovsky (in Russian and English).

==Society==
Many societies have traditional sages or culture heroes to whom aphorisms are commonly attributed, such as the Seven Sages of Greece, Chanakya, Confucius, or King Solomon.

Misquoted or misadvised aphorisms are frequently used as a source of humour; for instance, wordplays of aphorisms appear in the works of P. G. Wodehouse, Terry Pratchett, and Douglas Adams. Aphorisms being misquoted by sports players, coaches, and commentators form the basis of Private Eye&#x27;s Colemanballs section.

== Philosophy ==
Professor of Humanities Andrew Hui, author of &quot;A Theory of the Aphorism&quot; offered the following definition of an aphorism: &quot;a short saying that requires interpretation&quot;. Hui showed that some of the earliest philosophical texts from traditions around the world used an aphoristic style. Some of the earliest texts in the western philosophical canon feature short statements requiring interpretation, as seen in the Pre-Socratics like Heraclitus and Parmenides. In early Hindu literature, the Vedas were composed of many aphorisms. Likewise, in early Chinese philosophy, Taoist texts like the Tao Te Ching and the Confucian Analects relied on an aphoristic style. Francis Bacon, Blaise Pascal, Desiderius Erasmus, and Friedrich Nietzsche rank among some of the most notable philosophers who employed them in the modern time.

Andrew Hui argued that aphorisms played an important role in the history of philosophy, influencing the favored mediums of philosophical traditions. He argued for example, that the Platonic Dialogues served as a response to the difficult to interpret fragments and phrases which Pre-Socratic philosophers were famous for. Hui proposes that aphorisms often arrive before, after, or in response to more systematic argumentative philosophy. For example, aphorisms may come before a systematic philosophy, because the systematic philosophy consists of the attempt to interpret and explain the aphorisms, as he argues is the case with Confucianism. Alternately, aphorisms may be written against systematic philosophy, as a form of challenge or irreverence, as seen in Nietzsche&#x27;s work. Lastly, aphorisms may come after or following systematic philosophy, as was the case with Francis Bacon, who sought to bring an end to old ways of thinking.

The ability to elide the extraneous is what makes the aphorism bite, but the possibility of inferring backward to a missing text is what makes the aphorism poetic.&quot; (p.69.)

<text>Eichsfeld is a district in Thuringia, Germany, and part of the historical region of Eichsfeld. It is bounded by (from the east and clockwise) the districts of Nordhausen, Kyffhäuserkreis and Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis, and by the states of Hesse (district Werra-Meißner-Kreis) and Lower Saxony (district Göttingen).

== History ==

In medieval times the Eichsfeld region, which is larger than the current district Eichsfeld, was property of the Archbishops of Mainz.

Eichsfeld was the only region of Thuringia not to accept the Protestant Reformation, largely due to the efforts of the Archbishops of Mainz.

In 1801, the clerical states were dissolved, and the Kingdom of Prussia gained the region, only to lose it again in the Napoleonic Wars. In the Congress of Vienna (1815) Prussia as well as the Kingdom of Hanover raised claims for the Eichsfeld. The region was divided between both states. Although Hanover was annexed by Prussia in 1866, this border remained the boundary between two Prussian provinces, later between East and West Germany, and today between Thuringia and Lower Saxony.

The present district was established in 1994 by merging the former districts of Worbis and Heiligenstadt.

== Geography ==
The district is named after the historical region of Eichsfeld, which covers the northern portions of the present district and parts of Lower Saxony, the area around Duderstadt, called &quot;Untereichsfeld&quot; (lower Eichsfeld). It is a hilly countryside, that is attached to the Harz hills in the north. Incidentally it is the geographical centre of Germany. The Leine and Unstrut rivers both rise in the Eichsfeld.

The name is believed to be derived from &quot;Eichenfeld&quot;, which means &quot;field of oaks&quot;. A less popular theory is the origin in the word &quot;Eisfeld&quot; (&quot;field of ice&quot;).

== Coat of arms ==
The coat of arms displays the heraldic eagle of Brandenburg together with the Wheel of Mainz, which was a symbol of the bishops of Mainz. These arms were granted shortly after Prussia gained the Eichsfeld (1801). In 1816 the Eichsfeld was not a geographical unit anymore, and the arms became irrelevant. They were reintroduced in 1945 (used until 1952) and again in 1994.

<text>The Brontës () were a nineteenth-century literary family, born in the village of Thornton and later associated with the village of Haworth in the West Riding of Yorkshire, England. The sisters, Charlotte (1816–1855), Emily (1818–1848) and Anne (1820–1849), are well-known poets and novelists. Like many contemporary female writers, they published their poems and novels under male pseudonyms: Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell. Their stories attracted attention for their passion and originality immediately following their publication. Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; was the first to know success, while Emily&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, Anne&#x27;s &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; and other works were accepted as masterpieces of literature after their deaths.

The first Brontë children to be born to rector Patrick Brontë and his wife Maria were Maria (1814–1825) and Elizabeth (1815–1825), who both died at young ages due to disease. Charlotte, Emily and Anne were then born within approximately four years. These three sisters and their brother, Branwell (1817–1848), who was born after Charlotte and before Emily, were very close to each other. As children, they developed their imaginations first through oral storytelling and play, set in an intricate imaginary world, and then through the collaborative writing of increasingly complex stories set in their fictional world. The deaths of their mother and two older sisters marked them and influenced their writing profoundly, as did their isolated upbringing. They were raised in a religious family. The Brontë birthplace in Thornton is a place of pilgrimage and their later home, the parsonage at Haworth in Yorkshire, now the Brontë Parsonage Museum, has hundreds of thousands of visitors each year.

== Origin of the name ==
The Brontë family can be traced to the Irish clan &quot;Ó Pronntaigh&quot;, which literally means &quot;descendant of Pronntach&quot;. They were a family of hereditary scribes and literary men in Fermanagh. The version &quot;Ó Proinntigh&quot;, which was first given by Patrick Woulfe in his &quot;&quot; () and reproduced without question by Edward MacLysaght, cannot be accepted as correct, as there were a number of well-known scribes with this name writing in Irish in the 17th and 18th centuries and all of them used the spelling &quot;Ó Pronntaigh&quot;. The name is derived from the word or , which is related to the word , meaning &quot;giving&quot; or &quot;bestowal&quot; ( is given as an Ulster version of in O&#x27;Reilly&#x27;s &quot;Irish English Dictionary&quot;.) Patrick Woulfe suggested that it was derived from (the refectory of a monastery). &quot;Ó Pronntaigh&quot; was earlier anglicised as &quot;Prunty&quot; and sometimes &quot;Brunty&quot;.

At some point, Patrick Brontë (born Brunty), the sisters&#x27; father, decided on the alternative spelling with the diaeresis over the terminal to indicate that the name has two syllables. Multiple theories exist to account for the change, including that he may have wished to hide his humble origins. As a man of letters, he would have been familiar with classical Greek and may have chosen the name after the Greek (). One view, which biographer C. K. Shorter proposed in 1896, is that he adapted his name to associate himself with Admiral Horatio Nelson, who was also Duke of Bronte. One might also find evidence for this theory in Patrick Brontë&#x27;s desire to associate himself with the Duke of Wellington in his form of dress.

==Family tree==




== Members of the Brontë family ==

=== Patrick Brontë ===

Patrick Brontë (17 March 1777 – 7 June 1861), the Brontë sisters&#x27; father, was born in Loughbrickland, County Down, Ireland, of a family of farm workers of moderate means. His birth name was Patrick Prunty or Brunty. His mother, Alice McClory, was of the Roman Catholic faith, whilst his father Hugh was a Protestant, and Patrick was brought up in his father&#x27;s faith.
He was a bright young man and, after studying under the Rev. Thomas Tighe, won a scholarship to St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. There, he studied divinity, ancient history and modern history. Attending Cambridge may have made him feel that his name was too Irish and he changed its spelling to Brontë (and its pronunciation accordingly), perhaps in honour of Horatio Nelson, whom Patrick admired. It is more likely, however, that his brother William was &#x27;on the run&#x27; from the authorities for his involvement with the radical United Irishmen, leading Patrick to distance himself from the name Brunty. Having obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree, he was ordained on 10 August 1806. He is the author of &quot;Cottage Poems&quot; (1811), &quot;The Rural Minstrel&quot; (1814), numerous pamphlets, several newspaper articles and various rural poems.

In 1811, Patrick was appointed minister at Hartshead-cum-Clifton. In 1812, he met and married 29 year old Maria Branwell at Guiseley. In 1813, they moved to Clough House Hightown, Liversedge, West Riding of Yorkshire and by 1820 they had moved into the parsonage at Haworth, where he took up the post of perpetual curate. (Haworth was an ancient chapelry in the large parish of Bradford, so he could not be rector or vicar.) They had six children. On the death of his wife in 1821, his sister-in-law, Elizabeth Branwell, came from Penzance, Cornwall, to help him bring up the children. Open, intelligent, generous and dedicated to educating his children personally, he bought all the books and toys the children desired. He also accorded them great freedom and unconditional love, although he may have alienated them from the world due to his eccentric personal habits and peculiar theories of education.
After several failed attempts to remarry, Patrick accepted permanent widowerhood at the age of 47, and spent his time visiting the sick and the poor, giving sermons and administering communion. In so doing, he would often leave his children Maria, Elizabeth, Emily, Charlotte, Branwell and Anne alone with Elizabeth—Aunt Branwell and a maid, Tabitha Aykroyd (Tabby). Tabby helped relieve their possible boredom and loneliness especially by recounting local legends in her Yorkshire dialect as she tirelessly prepared the family&#x27;s meals. Eventually, Patrick would survive his entire family. Six years after Charlotte&#x27;s death, he died in 1861 at the age of 84. His son-in-law, the Rev. Arthur Bell Nicholls, would aid Mr Brontë at the end of his life as well.

=== Maria, née Branwell ===

Patrick&#x27;s wife Maria Brontë, née Branwell (15 April 1783 – 15 September 1821), was born in Penzance, Cornwall, and came from a comfortably well-off, middle-class family. Her father had a flourishing tea and grocery store and had accumulated considerable wealth. Maria died at the age of 38 of uterine cancer. She married the same day as her younger sister Charlotte in the church at Guiseley after her fiancé had celebrated the union of two other couples. She was a literate and pious woman, known for her lively spirit, joyfulness and tenderness, and it was she who designed the samplers that are on display in the museum and had them embroidered by her children. She left memories with her husband and with Charlotte, the oldest surviving sibling, of a very vivacious woman. The younger ones, particularly Emily and Anne, admitted to retaining only vague images of their mother, especially of her suffering on her sickbed.

=== Elizabeth Branwell ===

Elizabeth Branwell (2 December 1776 – 29 October 1842) arrived from Penzance in 1821, aged 45, after her younger sister Maria&#x27;s death, to help Patrick look after the children, to whom she was known as &#x27;Aunt Branwell.&#x27; Elizabeth Branwell was a Methodist, though it seems that her denomination did not exert any influence on the children. It was Aunt Branwell who taught the children arithmetic, the alphabet, and how to sew, embroider and cross-stitch, skills appropriate for ladies. Aunt Branwell also gave them books and subscribed to &quot;Fraser&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, less interesting than &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;, but, nevertheless, providing plenty of material for discussion. She was a generous person who dedicated her life to her nieces and nephew, neither marrying nor returning to visit her relations in Cornwall. She probably told the children stories of events that had happened in Cornwall, such as raids by pirates in the eighteenth century, who carried off British residents to be enslaved in North Africa and Turkey; enslavement in Turkey is mentioned by Charlotte Brontë in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. She died of bowel obstruction in October 1842, after a brief agony during which she was comforted by her beloved nephew Branwell. In her last will, Aunt Branwell left to her three nieces the considerable sum of £900 (about £95,700 in 2017 currency), which allowed them to resign from their low-paid jobs as governesses and teachers.

=== Children ===
* Maria (1814–1825), the eldest, was born in Clough House, Hightown, Liversedge, West Yorkshire, on 23 April 1814. She suffered from hunger, cold, and privation at Cowan Bridge School. Charlotte described her as very lively, very sensitive, and particularly advanced in her reading. She returned from school with an advanced case of tuberculosis and died at Haworth aged 11 on 6 May 1825.
* Elizabeth (1815–1825), the second child, joined her sister Maria at Cowan Bridge where she suffered the same fate. Elizabeth was less vivacious than her brother and sisters and apparently less advanced for her age. She died on 15 June 1825 aged 10, within two weeks of returning home to her father.
* Charlotte (1816–1855), born in Market Street, Thornton, near Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire, on 21 April 1816, was a poet and novelist and is the author of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, her best-known work and three other novels. She died on 31 March 1855, just before reaching the age of 39.
* Patrick Branwell (1817–1848) was born in Market Street, Thornton on 26 June 1817. Known as &quot;Branwell&quot;, he was a painter, writer, and casual worker. He became addicted to alcohol and laudanum and died in Haworth on 24 September 1848, aged 31.
* Emily Jane (1818–1848), born in Market Street, Thornton, 30 July 1818, was a poet and novelist. She died in Haworth on 19 December 1848, aged 30. &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was her only novel.
* Anne (1820–1849), born in Market Street, Thornton on 17 January 1820, was a poet and novelist. She wrote a largely-autobiographical novel entitled &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, but her second novel, &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; (1848), was far more ambitious. She died on 28 May 1849 in Scarborough, aged 29.

== Education ==
=== Cowan Bridge School ===
In 1824, the four eldest girls (excluding Anne) entered the Clergy Daughters&#x27; School at Cowan Bridge, which educated the children of less prosperous members of the clergy, and had been recommended to Mr Brontë. The following year, Maria and Elizabeth fell gravely ill and were removed from the school, later dying on 6 May and 15 June 1825, respectively. Charlotte and Emily were also withdrawn from the school and returned to Haworth. Charlotte expressed the traumatic impact that her sisters&#x27; deaths had on her in her future works. In &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, Cowan Bridge became Lowood, Maria inspired the young Helen Burns, the cruel mistress Miss Andrews inspired the headmistress Miss Scatcherd, and the tyrannical headmaster Rev. Carus Wilson, Mr Brocklehurst.

Tuberculosis, which afflicted Maria and Elizabeth in 1825, also caused the eventual deaths of three of the surviving Brontës: Branwell in September 1848, Emily in December 1848, and, finally, Anne in May 1849.

Patrick Brontë faced a challenge in arranging for the education of the girls of his family, which was barely middle class. They lacked significant connections and he could not afford the fees for them to attend an established school for young ladies. One solution was the schools where the fees were reduced to a minimum—so called &quot;charity schools&quot;—with a mission to assist families like those of the lower clergy. 

(Barker had read in the &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; of 6 November 1823 reports of cases in the Court of Commons in Bowes: he later read of other cases, of 24 November 1824 near Richmond, in the county of Yorkshire, where pupils had been discovered gnawed by rats and suffering so badly from malnutrition that some of them had lost their sight.) Yet for Patrick, there was nothing to suggest that the Reverend Carus Wilson&#x27;s Clergy Daughters&#x27; School would not provide a good education and good care for his daughters. The school was not expensive and its patrons (supporters who allowed the school to use their names) were all respected people. Among these was the daughter of Hannah More, a religious author and philanthropist who took a particular interest in education. More was a close friend of the poet William Cowper, who, like her, advocated extensive, proper and well-rounded education for young girls. The pupils included the offspring of different prelates and even certain acquaintances of Patrick Brontë including William Wilberforce, young women whose fathers had also been educated at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge. Thus Brontë believed Wilson&#x27;s school to have many of the necessary guarantees needed for his daughters to receive proper schooling.

=== John Bradley ===

In 1829–30, Patrick Brontë engaged John Bradley, an artist from neighbouring Keighley, as drawing-master for the children. Bradley was an artist of some local repute rather than a professional instructor, but he may well have fostered Branwell&#x27;s enthusiasm for art and architecture.

=== Miss Wooler&#x27;s school ===

In 1831, fourteen-year-old Charlotte was enrolled at the school of Miss Wooler in Roe Head, Mirfield. Patrick could have sent his daughter to a less costly school in Keighley nearer home but Miss Wooler and her sisters had a good reputation and he remembered the building, which he passed when strolling around the parishes of Kirklees, Dewsbury and Hartshead-cum-Clifton where he was vicar. Margaret Wooler showed fondness towards the sisters and she accompanied Charlotte to the altar at her marriage. Patrick&#x27;s choice of school was excellent—Charlotte was happy there and studied well. She made many lifelong friends, in particular Ellen Nussey and Mary Taylor who later went to New Zealand before returning to England. Charlotte returned from Roe Head in June 1832, missing her friends, but happy to rejoin her family.

Three years later, Miss Wooler offered her former pupil a position as her assistant. The family decided that Emily would accompany her to pursue studies that would otherwise have been unaffordable. Emily&#x27;s fees were partly covered by Charlotte&#x27;s salary. Emily was 17 and it was the first time she had left Haworth since leaving Cowan Bridge. On 29 July 1835, the sisters left for Roe Head. The same day, Branwell wrote a letter to the Royal Academy of Art in London, to present several of his drawings as part of his candidature as a probationary student.

Charlotte taught, and wrote about her students without much sympathy. Emily did not settle: after three months her health seemed to decline and she had to be taken home to the parsonage. Anne took her place and stayed until Christmas 1837.

Charlotte avoided boredom by following the developments of the imaginary Empire of Angria—invented by Charlotte and Branwell—that she received in letters from her brother. During holidays at Haworth, she wrote long narratives while being reproached by her father who wanted her to become more involved in parish affairs. These were coming to a head over the imposition of the Church of England rates, a local tax levied on parishes where the majority of the population were dissenters. In the meantime, Miss Wooler moved to Heald&#x27;s House, at Dewsbury Moor, where Charlotte complained about the humidity that made her unwell. Upon leaving the establishment in 1838 Miss Wooler presented her with a parting gift of &quot;The Vision of Don Roderick and Rokeby&quot;, a collection of poems by Walter Scott.

== Literary evolution ==
The children became interested in writing from an early age, initially as a game. They all displayed a talent for narrative, but for the younger ones it became a pastime to develop them. At the centre of the children&#x27;s creativity were twelve wooden soldiers which Patrick Brontë gave to Branwell at the beginning of June 1826. These toy soldiers instantly fired their imaginations and they spoke of them as &quot;the Young Men&quot;, and gave them names. However, it was not until December 1827 that their ideas took written form, and the imaginary African kingdom of Glass Town came into existence, followed by the Empire of Angria. Emily and Anne created Gondal, an island continent in the North Pacific, ruled by a woman, after the departure of Charlotte in 1831. In the beginning, these stories were written in &quot;little books&quot;, the size of a matchbox and cursorily bound with thread. The pages were filled with close, minute writing, often in capital letters without punctuation and embellished with illustrations, detailed maps, schemes, landscapes and plans of buildings, created by the children according to their specialisations. The idea was that the books were of a size for the soldiers to read. The complexity of the stories matured as the children&#x27;s imaginations developed, fed by reading the three weekly or monthly magazines to which their father had subscribed, or the newspapers that were bought daily from John Greenwood&#x27;s local news and stationery store.

=== Literary and artistic influence ===
These fictional worlds were the product of fertile imagination fed by reading, discussion and a passion for literature. Far from suffering from the negative influences that never left them and which were reflected in the works of their later, more mature years, the Brontë children absorbed them eagerly.

==== Press ====
The periodicals that Patrick Brontë read were a mine of information for his children. The &quot;Leeds Intelligencer&quot; and &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Edinburgh Magazine&quot;, conservative and well written, but better than the &quot;Quarterly Review&quot; that defended the same political ideas whilst addressing a less-refined readership (the reason Mr. Brontë did not read it), were exploited in every detail. &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot;, in particular, was not only the source of their knowledge of world affairs, but also provided material for the Brontës&#x27; early writing. For instance, an article in the June 1826 number of &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s&quot;, provides commentary on new discoveries from the exploration of central Africa. The map included with the article highlights geographical features the Brontës reference in their tales: the Jibbel Kumera (the Mountains of the Moon), Ashantee, and the rivers Niger and Calabar. The author also advises the British to expand into Africa from Fernando Po, where, Christine Alexander notes, the Brontë children locate the Great Glass Town. Their knowledge of geography was completed by Goldsmith&#x27;s &quot;Grammar of General Geography&quot;, which the Brontës owned and annotated heavily.

==== Lord Byron ====
From 1833, Charlotte and Branwell&#x27;s Angrian tales begin to feature Byronic heroes who have a strong sexual magnetism and passionate spirit, and demonstrate arrogance and even black-heartedness. Again, it is in an article in &quot;Blackwood&#x27;s Magazine&quot; from August 1825 that they discover the poet for the first time; he had died the previous year. From this moment, the name Byron became synonymous with all the prohibitions and audacities as if it had stirred up the very essence of the rise of those forbidden things. Branwell&#x27;s Charlotte Zamorna, one of the heroes of &quot;Verdopolis&quot;, tends towards increasingly ambiguous behaviour, and the same influence and evolution recur with the Brontës, especially in the characters of Heathcliff in &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, and Mr. Rochester in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, who display the traits of a Byronic hero. Numerous other works left their mark on the Brontës—the &quot;Thousand and One Nights&quot;, for example, which inspired jinn in which they became themselves in the centre of their kingdoms, while adding a touch of exoticism.

==== John Martin ====

The children&#x27;s imagination was also influenced by three prints of engravings in mezzotint by John Martin around 1820. Charlotte and Branwell made copies of the prints &quot;Belshazzar&#x27;s Feast&quot;, &quot;Déluge&quot;, and &quot;Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still upon Gibeon&quot; (1816), which hung on the walls of the parsonage.

Martin&#x27;s fantastic architecture is reflected in the Glass Town and Angrian writings, where he appears himself among Branwell&#x27;s characters and under the name of Edward de Lisle, the greatest painter and portraitist of Verdopolis, the capital of Glass Town. One of Sir Edward de Lisle&#x27;s major works, &quot;Les Quatre Genii en Conseil&quot;, is inspired by Martin&#x27;s illustration for John Milton&#x27;s &quot;Paradise Lost&quot;. Together with Byron, John Martin seems to have been one of the artistic influences essential to the Brontës&#x27; universe.
==== Anne&#x27;s morals and realism ====
The influence revealed by &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; and &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; is much less clear. Anne&#x27;s works are largely founded on her experience as a governess and on that of her brother&#x27;s decline. Furthermore, they demonstrate her conviction, a legacy from her father, that books should provide moral education. This sense of moral duty and the need to record it, are more evident in &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;. The influence of the gothic novels of Ann Radcliffe, Horace Walpole, Gregory &quot;Monk&quot; Lewis and Charles Maturin is noticeable, and that of Walter Scott too, if only because the heroine, abandoned and left alone, resists importunities not only through her almost supernatural talents, but by her powerful temperament.

&quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, &quot;Shirley&quot;, &quot;Villette&quot; and even &quot;The Professor&quot; present a linear structure concerning characters who advance through life after several trials and tribulations, to find a kind of happiness in love and virtue, recalling works of religious inspiration of the 17th century such as John Bunyan&#x27;s &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot; or his &quot;Grace abounding to the Chief of Sinners&quot;. In a more profane manner, the hero or heroine follows a picaresque itinerary such as in Miguel de Cervantes (1547–1616), Daniel Defoe (1660–1731), Henry Fielding (1707–1764) and Tobias Smollett (1721–1771). This lively tradition continued into the 19th century with the &quot;rags to riches&quot; genre to which almost all the great Victorian romancers have contributed. The protagonist is thrown by fate into poverty and after many difficulties achieves a golden happiness. Often an artifice is employed to effect the passage from one state to another such as an unexpected inheritance, a miraculous gift, grand reunions, etc, and in a sense it is the route followed by Charlotte&#x27;s and Anne&#x27;s protagonists, even if the riches they win are more those of the heart than of the wallet. Apart from its Gothic elements, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; moves like a Greek tragedy and possesses its music, the cosmic dimensions of the epics of John Milton, and the power of the Shakespearian theatre. One can hear the echoes of &quot;King Lear&quot; as well as the completely different characters of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;. The Brontës were also seduced by the writings of Walter Scott, and in 1834 Charlotte exclaimed, &quot;For fiction, read Walter Scott and only him—all novels after his are without value.&quot;

=== Governesses and Charlotte&#x27;s idea ===

====Early teaching opportunities====
 Through their father&#x27;s influence and their own intellectual curiosity, they were able to benefit from an education that placed them among knowledgeable people, but Mr Brontë&#x27;s emoluments were modest. The only options open to the girls were either marriage or a choice between the professions of school mistress or governess. The Brontë sisters found positions in families wherein they educated often rebellious young children, or found employment as school teachers. The possibility of becoming a paid companion to a rich and solitary woman might have been a fall-back role but one that would have probably bored any of the sisters intolerably. Janet Todd&#x27;s &quot;Mary Wollstonecraft, a revolutionary life&quot; mentions the predicament. 
Only Emily never became a governess. Her sole professional experience would be an experiment in teaching during six months of intolerable exile in Miss Patchett&#x27;s school at Law Hill (between Haworth and Halifax). In contrast, Charlotte had teaching positions at Miss Margaret Wooler&#x27;s school and in Brussels with the Hégers. She became governess to the Sidgwicks, the Stonegappes and the Lotherdales where she worked for several months in 1839, then with Mrs White, at Upperhouse House, Rawdon, from March to September 1841. Anne became a governess and worked for Mrs Ingham, at Blake Hall, Mirfield from April to December 1839, then for Mrs Robinson at Thorp Green Hall, Little Ouseburn, near York, where she also obtained employment for her brother in a futile attempt to stabilise him.

==== Working as governesses ====
The family&#x27;s finances did not flourish, and Aunt Branwell spent the money with caution. Emily had a visceral need of her home and the countryside that surrounded it, and to leave it would cause her to languish and wither. Charlotte and Anne, being more realistic, did not hesitate in finding work and from April 1839 to December 1841 the two sisters had several posts as governesses. Not staying long with each family, their employment would last for some months or a single season. However, Anne did stay with the Robinsons in Thorp Green where things went well, from May 1840 to June 1845.

In the meantime, Charlotte had an idea that would place all the advantages on her side. On advice from her father and friends, she thought that she and her sisters had the intellectual capacity to create a school for young girls in the parsonage where their Sunday School classes took place. It was agreed to offer the future pupils the opportunity of correctly learning modern languages and that preparation for this should be done abroad, which led to a further decision. Among the possibilities, Paris and Lille were considered, but were rejected due to aversion to the French. Indeed, the French Revolution and the Napoleonic wars had not been forgotten by the Tory-spirited and deeply conservative girls. On the recommendation of a pastor based in Brussels, who wanted to be of help, Belgium was chosen, where they could also study German and music. Aunt Branwell provided the funds for the Brussels project.

=== School project and study trip to Brussels ===

==== Charlotte&#x27;s and Emily&#x27;s journey to Brussels ====


Emily and Charlotte arrived in Brussels in February 1842 accompanied by their father. Once there, they enrolled at Monsieur and Madame Héger&#x27;s boarding school in the Rue d&#x27;Isabelle, for six months. Claire Héger was the second wife of Constantin, and it was she who founded and directed the school while Constantin had the responsibility for the higher French classes. According to Miss Wheelwright, a former pupil, he had the intellect of a genius. He was passionate about his auditorium, demanding many lectures, perspectives, and structured analyses. He was also a good-looking man with regular features, bushy hair, very black whiskers, and wore an excited expression while sounding forth on great authors about whom he invited his students to make a pastiche on general or philosophical themes.

The lessons, especially those of Constantin Héger, were very much appreciated by Charlotte, and the two sisters showed exceptional intelligence, although Emily hardly liked her teacher and was somewhat rebellious. Emily learned German and to play the piano with natural brilliance and very quickly the two sisters were writing literary and philosophical essays in an advanced level of French. After six months of study, Mme Héger suggested they stay at the boarding school free of charge, in return for giving some lessons. After much hesitation, the girls accepted. Neither of them felt particularly attached to their students, and only one, Mademoiselle de Bassompierre, then aged 16, later expressed any affection for her teacher Emily, which appeared to be mutual, and made her a gift of a signed, detailed drawing of a storm ravaged pine tree.

==== Return and recall ====
The death of their aunt in October of the same year forced them to return once more to Haworth. Aunt Branwell had left all her worldly goods in equal shares to her nieces and to Eliza Kingston, a cousin in Penzance, which had the immediate effect of purging all their debts and providing a small reserve of funds. Nevertheless, they were asked to return to the Héger&#x27;s boarding school in Brussels as they were regarded as being competent and were needed. They were each offered teaching posts in the boarding school, English for Charlotte and music for Emily. However, Charlotte returned alone to Belgium in January 1843. Emily remained critical of Monsieur Héger, in spite of the excellent opinion he held of her. He later stated that she &#x27;had the spirit of a man&#x27;, and would probably become a great traveller due to her being gifted with a superior faculty of reason that allowed her to deduce ancient knowledge from new spheres of knowledge, and her unbending willpower would have triumphed over all obstacles.

==== Charlotte returns ====
Almost a year to the day, enamoured for some time for Monsieur Héger, Charlotte resigned and returned to Haworth. Her life at the school had not been without suffering, and on one occasion she ventured into the cathedral and entered a confessional. She may have had intention of converting to Catholicism, but it would only have been for a short time. During her absence, life at Haworth had become more difficult. Mr. Brontë had lost his sight although his cataract had been operated on with success in Manchester, and it was there in August 1846, when Charlotte arrived at his bedside that she began to write &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. Meanwhile, her brother Branwell fell into a rapid decline punctuated by dramas, drunkenness and delirium. Due partly to Branwell&#x27;s poor reputation, the school project failed and was abandoned.

Charlotte wrote four long, very personal, and sometimes vague letters to Monsieur Héger that never received replies. The extent of Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s feelings for Héger were not fully realised until 1913, when her letters to him were published for the first time. Héger had first shown them to Mrs. Gaskell when she visited him in 1856 while researching her biography &quot;The Life of Charlotte Brontë&quot;, but she concealed their true significance. These letters, referred to as the &quot;Héger Letters&quot;, had been ripped up at some stage by Héger, but his wife had retrieved the pieces from the wastepaper bin and meticulously glued or sewn them back together. Paul Héger, Constantin&#x27;s son, and his sisters gave these letters to the British Museum, and they were shortly thereafter printed in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper.

==Brontë sisters&#x27; literary career==

=== First publication: &quot;Poems&quot;, by Currer, Ellis, and Acton Bell ===

The writing that had begun so early never left the family. Charlotte had ambition like her brother, and wrote to the poet laureate Robert Southey to submit several poems in his style (though Branwell was kept at a distance from her project). She received a hardly encouraging reply after several months. Southey, still illustrious today although his star has somewhat waned, was one of the great figures of English Romanticism, along with William Wordsworth and Samuel Taylor Coleridge, and he shared the prejudice of the times; literature, or more particularly poetry (for women had been publishing fiction and enjoying critical, popular and economic success for over a century by this time), was considered a man&#x27;s business, and not an appropriate occupation for ladies.

However, Charlotte did not allow herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, coincidence came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone in the dining room she noticed a small notebook lying open in the drawer of Emily&#x27;s portable writing desk and &quot;of my sister Emily&#x27;s handwriting&quot;. She read it and was dazzled by the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt &quot;more than surprise ..., a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music—wild, melancholy, and elevating.&quot; In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister&#x27;s indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.
Charlotte envisaged a joint publication by the three sisters. Anne was easily won over to the project, and the work was shared, compared and edited. Once the poems had been chosen, nineteen for Charlotte and twenty-one each for Anne and Emily, Charlotte went about searching for a publisher. She took advice from William and Robert Chambers of Edinburgh, directors of one of their favourite magazines, &quot;Chambers&#x27;s Edinburgh Journal&quot;. It is thought, although no documents exist to support the claim, that they advised the sisters to contact Aylott &amp; Jones, a small publishing house at 8, Paternoster Row, London, who accepted, but at the authors&#x27; own risk since they felt the commercial risk to the company was too great. The work thus appeared in 1846, published using the male pseudonyms of Currer (Charlotte), Ellis (Emily) and Acton (Anne) Bell. These were very uncommon forenames but the initials of each of the sisters were preserved and the patronym could have been inspired by that of the vicar of the parish, Arthur Bell Nicholls. It was in fact on 18 May 1845 that he took up his duties at Haworth, at the moment when the publication project was well advanced.

The book attracted hardly any attention. Only three copies were sold, of which one was purchased by Fredrick Enoch, a resident of Cornmarket, Warwick, who in admiration, wrote to the publisher to request an autograph—the only extant single document carrying the three authors&#x27; signatures in their pseudonyms, and they continued creating their prose, each one producing a book a year later. Each worked in secret, unceasingly discussing their writing for hours at the dinner table, after which their father would open the door at 9 p.m. with &quot;Don&#x27;t stay up late, girls!&quot;, then rewinding the clock and taking the stairs up to his room.

=== Fame ===
==== 1847 ====
Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, Emily&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and Anne&#x27;s &quot;Agnes Grey&quot; appeared in 1847 after many tribulations, again for reasons of finding a publisher. The packets containing the manuscripts were often returned to the parsonage and Charlotte simply added a new address; she did this at least a dozen times during the year. The first one was finally published by Smith, Elder &amp; Co in London. The 23-year-old owner, George Smith, had specialised in publishing scientific revues, aided by his perspicacious reader William Smith Williams. Emily and Anne&#x27;s manuscripts were confided to Thomas Cautley Newby, who intended to compile a &quot;three-decker&quot;; more economical for sale and for loan in the &quot;circulating libraries&quot;. The two first volumes included &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and the third one &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;. Both novels attracted critical acclaim, occasionally harsh about &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, praised for the originality of the subject and its narrative style, but viewed with suspicion because of its outrageous violence and immorality—surely, the critics wrote, a work of a man with a depraved mind. Critics were fairly neutral about &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, but more flattering for &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, which soon became a best-seller, despite some commentators denouncing it as an affront to good morals.

==== &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and rising fame ====

The pseudonymous (Currer Bell) publication in 1847 of &quot;Jane Eyre, An Autobiography&quot; established a dazzling reputation for Charlotte. In July 1848, Charlotte and Anne (Emily had refused to go along with them) travelled by train to London to prove to Smith, Elder &amp; Co. that each sister was indeed an independent author, for Thomas Cautley Newby, the publisher of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, had launched a rumour that the three novels were the work of one author, understood to be Ellis Bell (Emily). George Smith was extremely surprised to find two gawky, ill-dressed country girls paralysed with fear, who, to identify themselves, held out the letters addressed to &quot;Messrs. Acton, Currer and Ellis Bell&quot;. Taken by such surprise, he introduced them to his mother with all the dignity their talent merited, and invited them to the opera for a performance of Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Barber of Seville&quot;.

==== &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; ====

Emily Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; was published in 1847 under the masculine pseudonym Ellis Bell, by Thomas Cautley Newby, in two companion volumes to that of Anne&#x27;s (Acton Bell), &quot;Agnes Grey.&quot; Controversial from the start of its release, its originality, its subject, narrative style and troubled action raised intrigue. Certain critics condemned it, but sales were nevertheless considerable for an unknown author of a novel that defied all conventions.

It is a work of black Romanticism, covering three generations isolated in the cold spring of the countryside with two opposing elements: the dignified manor of Thrushcross Grange and the rambling dilapidated pile of Wuthering Heights. The main characters, swept by tumults of the earth, the skies and the hearts, are strange and often possessed of unheard-of violence and deprivations. The story is told in a scholarly fashion, with two narrators, the traveller and tenant Lockwood, and the housekeeper/governess, Nelly Dean, with two sections in the first person, one direct, one cloaked, which overlap each other with digressions and sub-plots that form, from apparently scattered fragments, a coherently locked unit.

==== 1848, Anne&#x27;s &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; ====
One year before her death in May 1849, Anne published a second novel. Far more ambitious than her previous novel, &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; was a great success and rapidly outsold Emily&#x27;s &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. However, the critical reception was mixed—praise for the novel&#x27;s &quot;power&quot; and &quot;effect&quot; and sharp criticism for being &quot;coarse&quot;. Charlotte Brontë herself, Anne&#x27;s sister, wrote to her publisher that it &quot;hardly seems to me desirable to choice of subject in that work is a mistake.&quot; After Anne&#x27;s death, Charlotte prevented the novel&#x27;s republication and thus condemned her sister to temporary oblivion.

The master theme is the alcoholism of a man who causes the downfall of his family. Helen Graham, the central character, gets married for love to Arthur Huntingdon, whom she soon discovers to be lecherous, violent and alcoholic. She is forced to break with the conventions that would keep her in the family home that has become hell, and to leave with her child to seek secret refuge in the old house of Wildfell Hall. When the alcohol causes her husband&#x27;s ultimate decline, she returns to care for him in total abnegation until his death.

Today, &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot; is considered by most of the critics to be one of the first sustained feminist novels.

==== Identities revealed ====
In 1850, a little over a year after the deaths of Emily and Anne, Charlotte wrote a preface for the re-print of the combined edition of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; and &quot;Agnes Grey&quot;, in which she publicly revealed the real identities of all three sisters.

== Charlotte Brontë ==

=== Denunciation of boarding schools (&quot;Jane Eyre&quot;) ===
Conditions at the school at Cowan Bridge, where Maria and Elizabeth may have contracted the tuberculosis from which they died, were probably no worse than those at many other schools of the time. (For example, several decades before the Brontë sisters&#x27; experience at Cowan Bridge, Jane Austen and her sister Cassandra contracted typhus at a similar boarding school, and Jane nearly died. The Austen sisters&#x27; education, like that of the Brontë sisters, was continued at home.) Nevertheless, Charlotte blamed Cowan Bridge for her sisters&#x27; deaths, especially its poor medical care—chiefly, repeated emetics and blood-lettings—and the negligence of the school&#x27;s doctor, who was the director&#x27;s brother-in-law. Charlotte&#x27;s vivid memories of the privations at Cowan Bridge were poured into her depiction of Lowood School in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;: the scanty and often spoiled food, the lack of heating and adequate clothing, the periodic epidemics of illness such as &quot;low fever&quot; (probably typhus), the severity and arbitrariness of the punishments, and even the harshness of particular teachers (a Miss Andrews who taught at Cowan Bridge is thought to have been Charlotte&#x27;s model for Miss Scatcherd in &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;). Elizabeth Gaskell, a personal friend and the first biographer of Charlotte, confirmed that Cowan Bridge was Charlotte&#x27;s model for Lowood and insisted that conditions there in Charlotte&#x27;s day were egregious. More recent biographers have argued that the food, clothing, heating, medical care and discipline at Cowan Bridge were not considered sub-standard for religious schools of the time, testaments of the era&#x27;s complacency about these intolerable conditions. One scholar has commended Patrick Brontë for his perspicacity in removing all his daughters from the school, a few weeks before the deaths of Maria and Elizabeth.

=== Literary encounters ===
Following the overwhelming success of &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;, Charlotte was pressured by George Smith, her publisher, to travel to London to meet her public. Despite the extreme timidity that paralysed her among strangers and made her almost incapable of expressing herself, Charlotte consented to be lionised, and in London was introduced to other great writers of the era, including Harriet Martineau and William Makepeace Thackeray, both of whom befriended her. Charlotte especially admired Thackeray, whose portrait, given to her by Smith, still hangs in the dining room at Haworth parsonage. On one occasion during a public gathering, Thackeray introduced Charlotte to his mother as &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; and when Charlotte called on him the next day, he received an extended dressing-down, in which Smith had to intervene.

During her trip to London in 1851 she visited the Great Exhibition and The Crystal Palace. In 1849 she published &quot;Shirley&quot; and in 1853 &quot;Villette&quot;.

=== Marriage and death ===
The Brontë sisters were highly amused by the behaviour of the curates they met. Arthur Bell Nicholls (1818–1906) had been curate of Haworth for seven and a half years, when contrary to all expectations, and to the fury of Patrick Brontë (their father), he proposed to Charlotte. Although impressed by his dignity and deep voice, as well as by his near complete emotional collapse when she rejected him, she found him rigid, conventional and rather narrow-minded &quot;like all the curates&quot;—as she wrote to Ellen Nussey. After she declined his proposal, Nicholls, pursued by the anger of Patrick Brontë, left his functions for several months. However, little by little her feelings evolved and after slowly convincing her father, she finally married Nicholls on 29 June 1854.

On return from their honeymoon in Ireland where she had been introduced to Mr. Nicholls&#x27; aunt and cousins, her life completely changed. She adopted her new duties as a wife, which took up most of her time. She wrote to her friends telling them that Nicholls was a good and attentive husband, but that she nevertheless felt a kind of holy terror at her new situation. In a letter to Ellen Nussey (Nell), in 1854 she wrote &quot;Indeed-indeed-Nell-it is a solemn and strange and perilous thing for a woman to become a wife.&quot;

The following year she died aged 38. The cause of death given at the time was tuberculosis, but it may have been complicated with typhoid fever (the water at Haworth being likely contaminated due to poor sanitation and the vast cemetery that surrounded the church and the parsonage) and hyperemesis gravidarum from her pregnancy that was in its early stage.

The first biography of Charlotte was written by Elizabeth Cleghorn Gaskell at the request of Patrick Brontë, and published in 1857, helping to create the myth of a family of condemned genius, living in a painful and romantic solitude. After having stayed at Haworth several times and having accommodated Charlotte in Plymouth Grove, Manchester, and having become her friend and confidant, Mrs Gaskell certainly had the advantage of knowing the family.

=== Novels ===
* &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; (1847)
* &quot;Shirley&quot; (1849)
* &quot;Villette&quot; (1853)
* &quot;The Professor&quot; (1857)

=== Unfinished fragments ===
These are outlines or unedited roughcasts which with the exception of &quot;Emma&quot; have been recently published.
* &quot;Ashford&quot;, written between 1840 and 1841, where certain characters from Angria are transported to Yorkshire and are included in a realistic plot.
* &quot;Willie Ellin&quot;, started after &quot;Shirley&quot; and &quot;Villette&quot;, and on which Charlotte worked relatively little in May and July 1853, is a story in three poorly linked parts in which the plot at this stage remains rather vague.
* &quot;The Moores&quot; is an outline for two short chapters with two characters, the brothers Robert Moore, a dominator, and John Henry Moore, an intellectual fanatic.
* &quot;Emma&quot;, already published in 1860 with an introduction from Thackeray. This brilliant fragment would doubtlessly have become a novel of similar scope to her previous ones. It later inspired the novel &quot;A Little Princess&quot; by Frances Hodgson Burnett.
* &quot;The Green Dwarf&quot; published in 2003. This story was probably inspired by &quot;The Black Dwarf&quot; by Walter Scott of whose novels Charlotte was a fan. The novel is a fictional history about a war that breaks out between Verdopolis (the capital of the confederation of &quot;Glass Town&quot;) and Senegal.

== Branwell Brontë ==

Patrick Branwell Brontë (1817–1848) was considered by his father and sisters to be a genius, while the book by Daphne du Maurier (1986), &quot;The Infernal World of Branwell Brontë&quot;, contains numerous references to his addiction to alcohol and laudanum. He was an intelligent boy with many talents and interested in many subjects, especially literature. He was often the driving force in the Brontë siblings&#x27; construction of the imaginary worlds. He was artistic and was encouraged by his father to pursue this.

While trying to make a name as an artist, he left for London, but used up his father&#x27;s allowance in a matter of days in cafés of ill-repute. His attempts to obtain low-paid work failed, and very quickly he foundered in alcohol and laudanum, unable to regain his stability.

Anne Brontë obtained employment for him in January 1843, but nearly three years later he was dismissed. In September 1848, after several years of decline, he died from tuberculosis. On his death, his father tearfully repeated, &quot;My brilliant boy&quot;, while the clearheaded and totally loyal Emily wrote that his condition had been &quot;hopeless&quot;.

Branwell is the author of &quot;Juvenilia&quot;, which he wrote as a child with his sister Charlotte, &quot;Glass Town&quot;, &quot;Angria&quot;, poems, pieces of prose and verse under the pseudonym of Northangerland, such as &quot;Real Rest&quot;, published by the &quot;Halifax Guardian&quot; (8 November 1846) from several articles accepted by local newspapers and from an unfinished novel probably from around 1845 entitled &quot;And the Weary are at Rest&quot;.

== Emily Brontë ==
Emily Brontë (1818–1848) has been called the &quot;Sphinx of Literature&quot;, writing without the slightest desire for fame and only for her own satisfaction. She was obsessively timid outside the family circle, to the point of turning her back on her partners in conversation without saying a word.

With a single novel, &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; (1847), and poems with an elemental power, she reached the heights of literature. Though she was almost unknown during her life, posterity classes her as &quot;top level&quot; in the literary canon of English literature. Simone de Beauvoir, in &quot;The Second Sex&quot; (1949), chooses only Emily Brontë, Virginia Woolf and (&quot;sometimes&quot;) Mary Webb, Colette and Mansfield, as among those who have tried to approach nature &quot;in its inhuman freedom&quot;.

Above all, Emily loved to wander about the wild landscape of the moors around Haworth. In September 1848 her health began to decline rapidly. Consumptive, she refused all treatment, with the exception of a visit from a London doctor, because although it was already too late, her relatives insisted. Despite popular belief, Emily did not die on the dining room sofa. There is no contemporary evidence for the story and Charlotte, in her letter to William Smith Williams, mentions Emily&#x27;s dog Keeper lying at the side of her death bed. It is possible that she left an unfinished manuscript that Charlotte burned to avoid such controversy as followed the publication of &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. Several documents exist that allude to the possibility, although no proof corroborating this suggestion has ever been found.

=== Emily Brontë&#x27;s poems ===

Emily&#x27;s poems were probably written to be inserted in the saga of &quot;Gondal&quot;, several of whose characters she identified with right into adulthood. At the age of 28 she still acted out scenes from the little books with Anne while travelling on the train to York. &quot;Remembrance&quot; was one of the 21 of her poems that were chosen for 1846 joint publication with her siblings&#x27;.
== Anne Brontë ==


Anne was not as celebrated as her other two sisters. Her second novel, &quot;The Tenant of Wildfell Hall&quot;, was prevented from being republished after Anne&#x27;s death by her sister Charlotte, who wrote to her publisher that &quot;it hardly appears to me desirable to preserve. The choice of subject in that work is a mistake, it was too little consonant with the character, tastes and ideas of the gentle, retiring inexperienced writer.&quot; This prevention is considered to be the main reason for Anne&#x27;s being less renowned than her sisters.
Anne&#x27;s health began to decline rapidly, like that of her brother and sister some months earlier. On 5 April 1849, she wrote to Ellen Nussey asking her to accompany her to Scarborough on the east coast. Anne confides her thoughts to Ellen:

Anne hoped that the sea air would improve her health, as recommended by the doctor, and Charlotte agreed to go.

On the Sunday morning she felt weaker and asked if she could be taken back to Haworth. The doctor confirmed that she was near to death and Anne thanked him for his candour. &quot;Take courage, take courage&quot; she murmured to Charlotte. She died at 2 pm on Monday 28 May. She is buried in the cemetery of St Mary&#x27;s of Scarborough. Her gravestone inscription carried an error in her age: she died at the age of 29 and not at 28. It was noticed by Charlotte during her only visit, and she had the intention of asking the mason to correct it. Ill health did not leave him time to effect the repair and the tombstone remained in the same state until it was replaced by the Brontë Society in April 2013.

== Northern England at the time of the Brontës ==
In her 1857 biography &quot;The Life of Charlotte Brontë&quot;, Mrs Gaskell begins with two explanatory and descriptive chapters. The first one covers the wild countryside of the West Riding of Yorkshire, the little village of Haworth, the parsonage and the church surrounded by its vast cemetery perched on the top of a hill. The second chapter presents an overview of the social, sanitary and economic conditions of the region.

=== Social, sanitary and economic conditions in Haworth ===
The death toll within the Brontë family was not unusual for the area, and left little impression on the village population, who were confronted with death on a daily basis. When Patrick Brontë arrived, the parish was suffering from unemployment. The men sought work in the quarries and local handicrafts. The only businesses were the pharmacy, which supplied Branwell, and John Greenwood&#x27;s stationery store where the Brontës were the best customers.

Haworth&#x27;s population grew rapidly during the first half of the 19th century, from hardly 1,000 to 3,365 in 50 years. The village did not have a sewage system and the well water was contaminated by faecal matter and the decomposition of bodies in the cemetery on the hilltop. Life expectancy was less than 25 years and infant mortality was around 41% for children under six months of age. Most of the population lived by working the poorly fertile land of the moors and supplemented their incomes with work done at home, such as spinning and weaving wool from the sheep that were farmed on the moors. Conditions changed when the textile industry, already present since the end of the 17th century, grew with the mills being located on the banks of the River Worth, whose waters turned the wheels. Consequently fewer people were needed to work them.

Food was scarce, often little more than porridge, resulting in vitamin deficiencies. Public hygiene was non-existent and lavatories were basic. The facilities at the parsonage were no more than a plank across a hole in a hut at the rear, with a lower plank for the children. In her thirties, Charlotte was described as having a toothless jaw by such persons as Mrs Gaskell, who stated in a letter dated 25 August 1850 to Catherine Winkworth: &quot;large mouth and many teeth gone&quot;. However, food was reasonably plentiful in the family. They ate from well filled plates of porridge in the morning and piles of potatoes were peeled each day in the kitchen while Tabby told stories about her country, or Emily revised her German grammar. Sometimes Mr Brontë would return home from his tours of the village with game donated by the parishioners.

=== Role of the women ===
According to Robert Southey, poet laureate, in his response to Charlotte, ladies from a good background should be content with an education and a marriage embellished with some decorative talents. Mr Patrick Brontë had one of the characters in his &quot;The Maid of Kilarney&quot;—without knowing whether it reflected a widespread opinion supporting or condemning it—say, &quot;The education of female ought, most assuredly, to be competent, in order that she might enjoy herself, and be a fit companion for man. But, believe me, lovely, delicate and sprightly woman, is not formed by nature, to pore over the musty pages of Grecian and Roman literature, or to plod through the windings of Mathematical Problems, nor has Providence assigned for her sphere of action, either the cabinet or the field. Her &quot;forte&quot; is softness, tenderness and grace.&quot; In any case, it seemed to contradict his attitude towards his daughters whom he encouraged, even if he was not completely aware of what they did with their time.

== Sisters&#x27; place in literature ==
Due to their forced or voluntary isolation, the Brontë sisters constituted a separate literary group that neither had predecessors nor successors. There is not a &#x27;Brontë&#x27; line such as exists among authors of realist and naturalist novels, or in poetry, the romantic and the symbolic.

Their influence certainly existed, but it is difficult to define in its totality. Writers who followed them doubtlessly thought about them while they were creating their dark and tormented worlds such as Thomas Hardy in &quot;Jude the Obscure&quot; or &quot;Tess of the d&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;, or George Eliot with &quot;Adam Bede&quot; and &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot;. There were also more conventional authors such as Matthew Arnold, who in a letter from 1853 says of Charlotte that she only pretends to heartlessness: &quot;nothing but hunger, rebellion and rage&quot;. In contrast, Mrs Humphry Ward, author of &quot;Robert Elsmere&quot; and other morality novels, only finds the didactic among the works of Charlotte, while she appreciates the happy blend of romance and realism in the works of Emily. There is however nothing that could constitute a literary vein.

=== Pilgrimages to Haworth from 1860 ===

By 1860 Charlotte had been dead for five years, and the only people living at the parsonage were Mr. Brontë, his son-in-law, Arthur Bell Nicholls, and two servants. In 1857 Mrs. Gaskell&#x27;s biography of Charlotte was published, and though at its first reading, Mr. Brontë approved of its commissioning, several months later he expressed doubts. The portrait of Nicholls, founded partly on the confidence of Ellen Nussey, seemed to him to be unjustified. Ellen Nussey, who hated Arthur, insists that his marital claims had perverted Charlotte&#x27;s writing and she had to struggle against an interruption of her career. It is true that Arthur found Nussey to be too close to his wife, and he insisted that she should destroy her letters—although this never actually happened.

Mrs. Gaskell&#x27;s book caused a sensation and was distributed nationwide. The polemic launched by Charlotte&#x27;s father resulted in a squabble that only served to increase the family&#x27;s fame.

During Charlotte&#x27;s lifetime friends and sponsors visited the parsonage, including Sir James and Lady Kay Shuttleworth, Ellen Nussey, Elizabeth Gaskell, John Store Smith, a young writer from Manchester, Bessie Parkes, who recounted her visit to Mrs. Gaskell, and Abraham Holroyd, poet, antiquarian and historian. However, following the publication of the book and the pastor&#x27;s public remonstrations, the parsonage became a place of pilgrimage for admirers wanting to see it with their own eyes. Charlotte&#x27;s husband recalled that he had to protect his father-in-law, when on the short path to the church they had to push their way through the crowds of people wanting to reach out and touch the cape of the father of the Brontë girls. The hundreds of visitors became thousands, coming from all over Britain and even from across the Atlantic. Whenever he agreed to meet them, Patrick received them with utmost courtesy and recounted the story of his brilliant daughters, never omitting to express his displeasure at the opinions held about Charlotte&#x27;s husband.

The flow of visitors has never abated. Indeed, the parsonage at Haworth received an estimated 88,000 visitors in 2017.

=== Brontë Society ===
The Brontë Parsonage Museum is managed and maintained by the Brontë Society, which organises exhibitions and takes care of the cultural heritage represented by objects and documents that belonged to the family. The society has branches in Australia, Canada, France, Ireland, the Scandinavian countries, South Africa and the USA.

=== Haworth ===
In 1904, Virginia Woolf visited Haworth and published an account in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on 21 December. She remarked on the symbiosis between the village and the Brontë sisters, and on the fact that utensils and clothes that would normally have disappeared before those who used them, have survived, enables one to better understand their singular presence. She wrote: &quot;Haworth expresses the Brontës; the Brontës express Haworth; they fit like a snail to its shell&quot;.

===Brontë Birthplace===
 The sisters&#x27; birthplace in Thornton has been acquired by a community benefit society to preserve it, and there are plans to restore the house for use as a &quot;social and educational space&quot;.

===Brontë Stones===
In a 2018 project curated and delivered by University of Huddersfield academic and writer Michael Stewart and the Bradford Literature Festival, four specially-commissioned poems are inscribed on four stones set in the area between the sisters&#x27; birthplace and the Haworth parsonage. The Anne Stone has a poem by Jackie Kay and stands in a wildflower meadow behind the Haworth Parsonage; the Charlotte Stone, with a poem by Carol Ann Duffy, is set in the wall of the Brontë Birthplace in Thornton; Emily is remembered in a poem by Kate Bush, known for her 1978 song &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;, which is carved into a rock outcrop of Ogden Kirk on wild moorland above Ogden Water; and a fourth stone, the Brontë Stone, commemorates all three sisters with a poem by Jeanette Winterson and stands in Thornton Cemetery. There are various published walks around the stones, including the Emily Brontë Walk which is recognised by the Long Distance Walkers Association. The Brontë Stones Project was found to have &quot;increased local engagement with the landscape, regenerated and preserved ancient public rights of ways, and provided an important stimulus to cultural tourism, contributing to the quality of the tourist experience&quot;.

== Commemoration in Westminster Abbey ==
A plaque to the three Brontë sisters was erected in Poets&#x27; Corner in Westminster Abbey on 8 October 1939, although it was not marked with any ceremony, due to the outbreak of the Second World War. A formal unveiling took place in 1947 but it took until 2024 for the lack of diaeresis over the final e in their names to be noticed and corrected.

== Descendants ==
The line of Patrick Brontë died out with his children, but Patrick&#x27;s brother had notable descendants, including James Brontë Gatenby, whose most important work was studying Golgi bodies in various animals, including humans, and Peter Gatenby, formerly the medical director of the UN.

== In popular culture ==
=== Books, comics and graphic novels ===

* In Catherynne M. Valente&#x27;s young-adult fiction novel &quot;The Glass Town Game&quot; (2017), &quot;Glass Town turns into a Narnia-like world of its own, and the Brontës find themselves pulled through into their own creation&quot;.
*In the comic series &quot;Die&quot; (2018) by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Stephanie Hans, three of the locations on the icosahedron shaped world are Gondal, Angria and Glass Town based on the Brontë juvenilia. In issue #9, Charlotte is a narrative character and reveals the connection between the world of &quot;Die&quot;, her siblings and their paracosms. Charlotte is also featured on the cover of the issue.
*In the graphic novel &quot;Glass Town&quot; (2020) by Isabel Greenberg, parts of the Brontë juvenilia are retold and intersected with the lives of four Brontë children—Charlotte, Branwell, Emily and Anne, as they explore the imaginary world they created. &quot;Greenberg blurs fiction and memoir: characters walk between worlds and woo their creators. [...] This is a tale, bookended by funerals, about the collision between dreamlike places of possibility and constrained 19th-century lives&quot;.

=== Cinema ===
* In the American short film &quot;Three Sisters of the Moors&quot; (1944) by John Larkin, Molly Lamont plays Charlotte Brontë, Lynne Roberts plays Emily Brontë, and Heather Angel plays Anne Brontë.
* In the American film &quot;Devotion&quot; (1946) by Curtis Bernhardt, which constitutes a biography of the Brontë sisters, Ida Lupino plays Emily, Olivia de Havilland plays Charlotte, and Nancy Coleman plays Anne.
* In the French film &quot;Week-end&quot; (1967) by Jean-Luc Godard, Emily Brontë appears in a scene where one of the protagonists asks for geographical information.
* In the French film &quot;Les Sœurs Brontë&quot; (1979) by André Téchiné, Isabelle Adjani plays Emily, Marie-France Pisier plays Charlotte, Isabelle Huppert plays Anne, Patrick Magee plays Patrick Brontë, and Pascal Greggory plays Branwell Brontë.
* In the Canadian film &quot;The Carmilla Movie&quot; (2017) by Spencer Maybee, Grace Lynn Kung plays Charlotte and Cara Gee plays Emily.
* In the British/American film &quot;Emily&quot; (2022) by Frances O&#x27;Connor, Emma Mackey plays Emily, Alexandra Dowling plays Charlotte, and Amelia Gething plays Anne.

===Dance===
* Several 20th-century choreographic works have been inspired by the lives and works of the Brontë sisters.
* Dancer Gillian Lynne presented a composition titled &quot;The Brontës&quot; (1995).

===Music===
* &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; is presented as John Lennon&#x27;s favourite book in &quot;The Sky is Everywhere,&quot; a young adult fiction novel by author Jandy Nelson.
* English singer-songwriter Kate Bush released a song titled &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; in 1978 to critical success. Coincidentally, Bush and Emily share the same Birthday, 140 years apart. A cover version of Bush&#x27;s song was included on the Pat Benatar album &quot;Crimes of Passion&quot;, bringing it a much larger audience.
*&quot;Glass Town&quot;, a 2021 meta rock musical by Miriam Pultro, features the &quot;Brontë siblings as band members: Anne as the modern, feminist neosoul star; Emily as the alt-rock prodigy; Branwell, singing the blues; and Charlotte, the passionate rocker frontwoman&quot;.

===Objects in outer space===
* Charlottebrontë is the name of asteroid #39427, discovered at the Palomar Observatory, located on Palomar Mountain in southern California, on 25 September 1973. The asteroids #39428 and #39429 (both discovered on 29 September 1973, at Palomar Observatory) are named Emilybrontë and Annebrontë respectively.
* The diameter impact crater Brontë on the surface of the planet Mercury is named in honour of the Brontë family.

=== Opera ===
* &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; has been the subject of at least three completed operas of the same name: Bernard Herrmann wrote his version between 1943 and 1951, and Carlisle Floyd&#x27;s setting was premiered in 1958. Frédéric Chaslin also wrote an operatic version. Frederick Delius also started work on a &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot; opera but abandoned it early.

=== Sport ===
* In 2018, a new horse race at York Racecourse was named the Brontë Cup in honour of the family.

=== Stage productions ===
* The play &quot;Brontë&quot; (2005), by Polly Teale, explores their lives as well as the characters they created.
* The musical &quot;Schwestern im Geiste&quot; (2014; &quot;Sisters in Spirit&quot;), by Peter Lund, is about the Brontës.

* Elizabeth Goudge wrote a two-act stage play, &quot;The Brontës of Haworth&quot;, which was staged in 1932, according to Goudge&#x27;s biographer, Christine Rawlins (&quot; Beyond the Snow: The Life and Faith of Elizabeth Goudge&quot;, Thomas Nelson, 2015, p 143). This was included in Goudge&#x27;s &quot;Three Plays: Suomi; The Brontës of Haworth; Fanny Burney&quot; (Gerald Duckworth, 1939). Goudge&#x27;s play was staged again, in June 1934, at the Taylor Institute in London (Rawlins, p 159).

* John Davison published &quot;The Brontës of Haworth Parsonage: A Chronicle Play of a Famous Family in Five Acts&quot; (J. Garnet Miller, London, 1934).

=== Television ===
* Christopher Fry (1907–2005), the Twentieth century poet and dramatist, wrote the telescript for the 1973 television mini-series, &quot;The Brontës of Haworth&quot;. This was filmed at the vicarage in Haworth. It had five one-hour episodes. It was nominated for a BAFTA Award.
* In the &quot;Family Guy&quot; episode &quot;New Kidney in Town&quot;, a cutaway gag shows Charlotte and Emily congratulating each other on their literary achievements, while Anne is shown as a crude simpleton (implying her literary contributions were negligible compared to her sisters).
* In the short-lived MTV 2002–2003 animated series &quot;Clone High&quot;, the Brontë sisters were recurring background characters. In the season finale, &quot;&quot;, they go out as Clone JFK&#x27;s prom dates, along with Catherine the Great and Joan of Arc. Later on, he states that he gave them away to The Three Stooges.
** The creators of &quot;Clone High&quot;, Phil Lord and Christopher Miller previously made a failed pilot entitled &quot;Super X-Treme Mega History Heroes&quot; where it depicts a fictional toy line where the three sister action figures morph together into &quot;Brontësaurus&quot; à la other action figure toys such as Transformers and Power Rangers.
** In the 2023–24 revival of &quot;Clone High&quot;, JFK gets back together with the Brontë sisters following his breakup with Joan of Arc in &quot;Sexy Ed&quot;. In the season finale, &quot;Clone Alone&quot;, the sisters are unable to get through the door to the Clone High College &quot;entrance exam&quot; labyrinth death game before it closes, and JFK is forced to go on without them, indicating that they will be unable to attend the university.
* In the episode &quot;Educating Doug&quot; of the American television series &quot;The King of Queens&quot;, Doug and Carrie enrol in a course on classic literature to improve their level of sophistication. They are assigned the book &quot;Jane Eyre&quot; where Doug struggles to get past even the second page.
* In the episode of CBBC children&#x27;s television show &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; entitled &quot;Staggering Storytellers&quot;, Charlotte (Jessica Ransom), Emily (Gemma Whelan), Anne (Natalie Walter) and Branwell (Thom Tuck) try to get their work published, forgetting all about the Brontë brother.
* In 2016 a BBC TV drama, &quot;To Walk Invisible&quot;, was made about the initial success of their novels and the death of Branwell.
* In 2018, a TV sitcom series, &quot;Mom&quot;, episode titled, &quot;Charlotte Brontë and a Backbone&quot;, references being a college educated waitress who knows the difference between Charlotte and Emily.

<text>Millom is a town and civil parish on the north shore of the estuary of the River Duddon in southernmost Cumberland, Cumbria, England. It is situated just outside the Lake District National Park, about north of Barrow-in-Furness ( by road) and south of Whitehaven.
Most of modern-day Millom, excluding Holy Trinity Church and Millom Castle, dates from after 1866 following the founding of the Millom Ironworks. It subsumed the village of Holborn Hill. Built around the ironworks, the town grew to a size of over 10,000 people by the 1960s, but has struggled since the works were closed in 1968. Culturally, Millom is notable as the birthplace of poet Norman Nicholson, and for its historical links with rugby league.

==History==

In January 2023, 29-year-old metal detectorist Josh Carr and his brother found six Bronze Age socketed axe heads at a site near Millom. The finds were featured in the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Digging for Britain&quot; in January 2025.

Millom is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as one of the townships forming the Manor of Hougun which had been held by Tostig Godwinson, Earl of Northumbria.

Millom Castle is a grade I listed building and scheduled ancient monument which by 1739 was in dilapidated condition.

In 1251 a market charter was granted by King Henry III of England to John de Huddleston, Lord of Millom.

Millom is the most southerly town in the historic county of Cumberland.

The Whitehaven &amp; Furness Junction Railway opened a station in 1850, which was known as &#x27;Holborn Hill Halt&#x27; until the new town of Millom was built in 1866. It was taken over by the Furness Railway in 1866.

A map of 1862 shows that there was a small hamlet by the name of Holborn Hill on the northwest side of the railway line. It had a railway station, an inn and a tile and brickworks. By 1899 the small town of Millom had grown up, with terraced streets on either side of the railway, a public library, police station, banks, hotels, school, market square and allotments.

In the intervening years, the Hodbarrow iron mines began extracting haematite from deposits between the village of Holborn Hill and the seashore at Hodbarrow. The first shafts were sunk in the 1850s and by 1881 there were seven pits operated by the Hodbarrow Mining Company. Millom &amp; Askam Iron Company built Millom Ironworks and the first furnaces were completed in 1866. The opening of the ironworks led to the building of the new town of Millom . The Hodbarrow Outer Barrier, the third seawall to be built to protect the mines from the sea, was completed in 1905 . It took five years to construct at a cost of almost £600,000. The Hodbarrow Mines and Millom Ironworks were closed in 1968. The town&#x27;s population of 10,997 in 1967 fell to 7,101 by the 1971 census.

In 1877 the expanding town needed more water and Whicham Beck was dammed at Baystone Bank (54.261226,-3.274237) to form Baystone Bank Reservoir. The reservoir remained in use until about 1996. It was drained in 2011, the dam removed and the valley returned to its original form. This work was carried out by water network company United Utilities.

During the Second World War an airfield, RAF Millom, was developed on flat coastal land at Haverigg. This was an advanced flying training station, mainly for Observers and also Air Gunners. Aircraft stationed there were firstly the Blackburn Botha and Fairey Battle, then the more popular and successful Avro Anson. Post-war this became the site of HM Prison Haverigg.

Throughout its history the town has struggled with socio-economic problems, once being described by the Mayor of Copeland as &#x27;a place of despair&#x27;.
Millom &amp; District Local History Society was formed at a public meeting held on 4 February 1972.

==Governance==

Millom is within the Barrow and Furness UK Parliamentary constituency, Michelle Scrogham is the Member of Parliament.

For local government purposes, it is in the Cumberland unitary authority.

Millom also has a parish council, Millom Town Council. The parish had a population of 7,829 in 2011 and is divided into four wards: Holborn Hill, Newtown North, Newtown South and Haverigg.

The Old Town Hall was completed in 1879.

==Economy==
Millom&#x27;s economy is now mainly based around retail, services and tourism. It is a relatively low wage area, with a lot of people employed in skilled trades such as building, painting and decorating. Many also work in the service sector in hotels, pubs and shops within the nearby Lake District National Park. Higher wage centres are Barrow-in-Furness to the south and Sellafield to the north-west with commuting each way on the road or via the railway.

The prison at Haverigg, away is a large employer.

Millom was granted the status of a Fairtrade town in 2004.

==Culture and community==
Millom Palladium is a theatre, bar and full multi-functional venue. Completed in 1911, it has stood on the site for over 100 years. This building and entertainments venue is home to Millom Amateur Operatic Society (MAOS), founded in 1909, and is currently an ongoing project run and managed by a registered charity and group of volunteers with hopes to reinstate the cinema facility within the building. 

The Beggar&#x27;s Theatre is a multi-function arts base with several activities, performing-arts based, for local talent and provides a venue for touring theatres, stand-up comedians etc.

==Norman Nicholson Society==
The Norman Nicholson Society promotes and explores the work of the town&#x27;s most famous son, the poet and writer Norman Nicholson, who spent his whole life in the town.

==Landmarks==

St. George&#x27;s Church stands within the town on a small hill and with its steeple is the biggest landmark of the town, being visible from many miles away.

The area&#x27;s bigger landmark is the significant hill of Black Combe standing above sea level. It forms a grand panoramic viewing platform of the south-western Lake District and also offers views of England, Scotland, Ireland and Wales on a clear day.

Millom Discovery Centre (previously known as &#x27;Millom Folk Museum&#x27; and &#x27;Millom Heritage Museum And Visitor Centre&#x27;) presents a snapshot of past times in Millom, paying particular attention to the historical development of the area brought about by the significant iron ore mining and iron works.

Millom Rock Park is situated high on the north rim of the nearby Ghyll Scaur Quarry in the parish of Millom Without. A viewpoint in the Rock Park permits views into the working quarry and overlooks the processing machinery. There is an avenue of 15 large rock specimens with detailed interpretation panels.

There are two nature reserves near the town, both of which are located on the Duddon Estuary; an internationally important area for wildlife and designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Hodbarrow Nature Reserve is owned by the RSPB and is located to the south of the town, which in October 2005, saw the unveiling of its new public aid, with logos produced by local artists Stuart Edwards and Holly Parminter. Millom Iron Works Local Nature Reserve is located to the east of the town. Both reserves are important for tern species and a number of wading birds and waterfowl. Hodbarrow is renowned for large numbers of wildfowl during the winter. Various birds of prey can be seen hunting on both reserves throughout the year.

In 1866 the Hodbarrow Mining Company built a lighthouse on Hodbarrow Point to guide ships to its dock. When the company built a seawall in 1905 to protect its mineworkings, it established a new lighthouse on the wall and abandoned the old one. Both structures still stand. In 2004 the newer lighthouse (which had itself been abandoned in 1949) was refurbished as part of a local community initiative. At the time a new solar-powered light was placed in the lantern which used to operate at night, but by 2016 it was no longer functioning.

RAF Millom Museum closed in 2010.

==Transport==
Millom is served by Millom railway station on the Cumbrian Coast Line.

The A5093 road goes through the town and is itself a loop off of the A595. The town council supports the building of a road bridge across the Duddon estuary between Millom and the Furness peninsula.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill and the local relay TV transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Cumbria on 96.1 FM, Heart North West on 96.9 FM and CandoFM 106.3 FM, a community based station. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, North West Evening Mail. 

==Education==
Millom School is a secondary school and sixth form, it includes the adult education centre, an all-weather sports pitch and the &quot;Melvyn Bragg Drama Studio&quot; which was opened in 2005. At one time it had a swimming pool, however this was subsequently demolished by Cumbria County Council.

There are a number of other schools in the town including;
* Millom Infants School, 
* The Nursery, 
* St James&#x27; Catholic Primary School,
* Black Combe Junior School, which was built in the early 1970s; its first headmaster, Frank Eccles, died 1 January 2013 aged 89.

==Health==
Primary health care is provided at the town&#x27;s community hospital. It also provides some clinics, physiotherapy, podiatry and has a small x-ray facility. The in-patients occupy one ward spanning a six- (now five-) bed bay, a four-bed bay, twin and single rooms. The hospital does not offer A+E service nor any other &#x27;drop-in&#x27; healthcare services. The nearest A+E (Accident and Emergency) service is at Furness General Hospital away by road at Barrow-in-Furness.

==Religious sites==
Millom&#x27;s original parish church is Holy Trinity, a grade I listed building dating to the 12th century. In 1877 the growth of the town required the building of another church and architects Paley and Austin were commissioned to build St George&#x27;s, a Grade II Listed building. It contains an impressive memorial window to Norman Nicholson by the stained-glass artist Christine Boyce. There are also Roman Catholic, Baptist and Methodist churches and a community church. Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses also have a Kingdom Hall in the town.

<text>The Electric Ballroom is a 1,500-capacity performance venue (primarily for rock bands) and indoor market located at 184 Camden High Street in Camden Town, London, England.

==History==
The Electric Ballroom started as an Irish ballroom in the 1930s, renamed as Electric Ballroom in the summer of 1978 and owned by Bill Fuller, up until his death in 2008, aged 91. It hosts various events.

==Venue==
The two-storey building has two dance floors and four bars. The ground floor has a stage and full concert facilities, with a capacity of 1,500.

&quot;Stand Up Central&quot; (formerly known as &quot;Russell Howard&#x27;s Stand Up Central&quot;) is a British stand-up comedy television show in front of a live audience at the Electric Ballroom.

MTV Brand New for (2011-2018) is a showcase at Electric Ballroom.

The Electric Ballroom was a roller disco for a brief period from the late 1970s to the early 1980s. By 1990, the building had an indoor market on weekends with about fifty stalls, selling a variety of fashion-, lifestyle- and music-related goods. The market closed at short notice in 2015, resulting in unemployment for many staff and traders.

The Friday club night is Sin City, playing rock and alternative genres. The Friday club was formerly goth night Full Tilt. On Saturday, &quot;Shake&quot; plays mostly pop and dance from the 1970s, 1980s onwards, as well as modern hip hop and R&amp;B.

The Electric Ballroom is the London home for PROGRESS Wrestling, holding events on a regular basis since March 2014.

On 15 April 2018, the People&#x27;s Vote campaign was started there.

==Camden Town tube station==
Transport for London proposed to demolish the Electric Ballroom in order to allow the redevelopment of the Camden Town Underground station, but the planning application for the redevelopment was rejected by Camden London Borough Council in 2004. A revised proposal from Transport for London in 2005 to demolish the whole block including the Ballroom, Buck Street Market and the Dr Martens store was rejected by Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott. In 2007 the government declared the Electric Ballroom a dilapidated building, a new argument which allows planning for the extension of the Camden Town tube station to be restarted. A public consultation ended on 22 February 2007. Details, the adoption statement and the adopted planning brief for the Camden Town Underground Station site are on the Camden Council website.

<doc id="256822" wikidata="Q7681908" url="?curid=256822" title="Tamworth Castle">
<text>Tamworth Castle, a Grade I listed building, is a Norman castle overlooking the mouth of the River Anker into the Tame in the town of Tamworth in Staffordshire, England. Before boundary changes in 1889, however, the castle was within the edge of Warwickshire while most of the town belonged to Staffordshire.

The site served as a residence of the Mercian kings in Anglo Saxon times, but fell into disuse during the Viking invasions. Refortified by the Normans and later enlarged, the building is today one of the best preserved motte-and-bailey castles in England.

==History==
When Tamworth became the chief residence of Offa, ruler of the expanding Mercian kingdom, he built a palace there from which various charters were issued &quot;sedens in palatio regali in Tamoworthige&quot;, the first dating from 781. Little trace of its former glory survived the Viking attack in 874 that left the town &quot;for nearly forty years a mass of blackened ruins&quot;. Then in 913 Tamworth was rebuilt by Æthelflæd, Lady of the Mercians, who newly fortified the town with an earthen burh. This, however, did little to defend the place when it was again sacked by the Danes in 943.

Over the following centuries there is no more mention of Tamworth as a royal residence, although a mint there struck coins for later Anglo-Saxon kings and eventually for the new Norman monarch, William the Conqueror. The place was then granted to William&#x27;s steward, Robert Despenser, who built a wooden castle during the 1080s in the typical Norman motte and bailey fashion. Occupying the south western part of the earlier burh, this was the forerunner of the present building.

When Robert died childless, the castle passed to his nieces, one of whom, Matilida, married Robert Marmion. The Marmion family, hereditary champions of the Dukes of Normandy and then of the new Kings of England, held the castle for six generations from c.1100 to 1294. It was during their occupancy that the castle began to be remodelled in stone, although on one occasion it was also in danger of being demolished altogether. Robert Marmion, 3rd Baron Marmion of Tamworth, deserted King John in 1215 during the turmoil of his reign. As a consequence, the king ordered Robert&#x27;s son Geoffrey to be imprisoned, all of Robert&#x27;s lands to be confiscated and Tamworth Castle to be demolished. But the fabric had only been partially destroyed by the time of John&#x27;s death the following year, when Robert&#x27;s sons were able to regain their father&#x27;s lands.
The last male of the family to own the castle was Philip Marmion. Since he had no legitimate sons, the castle passed on his death (c.1291) to his daughter and, after she died without an heir in 1294, to her niece Joan. As she was the wife of Sir Alexander Freville, Joan&#x27;s descendants initiated the next dynasty of owners who held the castle until 1423. The male line then came to an end with Baldwin de Freville, whose son died a minor, and the castle passed to the eldest daughter, Elizabeth, and her husband, Thomas Ferrers of Groby.

Numerous additions were made to the castle over the centuries, especially in the Jacobean period, from which time the arms of the Ferrers family and those with whom they intermarried came to dominate the interior. The shell keep contains a 12th-century gate tower and later residential accommodation in an H plan comprising a 13th-century three-storey north range, and a 17th-century Jacobean three-storey south range linked by an oak timbered Great Hall of the 15th century. A notable exterior feature surviving from early times is the herring-bone pattern of masonry laid diagonally at the base of the causeway up to the gate tower.

===The modern period===
Originally entry to the castle grounds was by a gateway (little of which now remains) fronting onto the town&#x27;s market-place. In his itinerary of Britain (1539/43), John Leland found the outworks &quot;cleane decayed and the Wall fallen downe&quot;, although on the mound there remained &quot;a great round Tower of Stone, wherein Mr [Humphrey] Ferrers dwelleth, and now repaireth it&quot;.

However adapted as a residence, the castle&#x27;s defences had been built with the conditions of mediaeval warfare in mind. During the English Civil War, it was captured by Parliamentary forces on 25 June 1643 after only a two-day siege and was garrisoned by them. In July 1645 the garrison comprised ten officers and 77 soldiers under the command of the military governor, Waldyve Willington. Owing to this use, the castle therefore escaped the slighting ordered for so many others at that period.

After 1668 the castle passed to the relatives of the Ferrers, initially the Shirleys of Chartley and then in 1715 to the Comptons when Elizabeth Ferrers married the 5th Earl of Northampton. During their period of ownership, the castle again fell into disrepair but after the Ferrers grandniece, Charlotte Compton, had married George Townshend of Raynham, it was again refurbished. Following his death in 1811, the castle was acquired by an auctioneer, John Robbins in 1814, although he did not move in until 1821: ownership reverted to the Townshend family on his death.

The moat on the town side had fallen into disuse and from the 15th century onwards parts of it were leased to the houses on that side of Market Street. In 1810 a new gatehouse was built at the foot of the Holloway, where the road ran south along the Lady Bridge. From it a carriageway wound up through the grounds to the castle&#x27;s entrance. The castle mill was sited further along the Anker, where it was depicted in J. M. W. Turner&#x27;s panoramic watercolour of the castle from the south-east (1832). Also included there is the Lady Bridge to the left and the square tower of St Editha&#x27;s Church on the right.

The castle had earlier made a brief appearance in Walter Scott&#x27;s narrative poem &quot;Marmion: A Tale of Flodden Field&quot; (1808). Set in Tudor times, its anachronistic anti-hero is proclaimed at the banquet in the first canto as &quot;Lord of Fontenaye…Of Tamworth tower and town&quot;, although the barony of Marmion had by then been extinct for more than two centuries.

Finally in 1891 the Marquess Townshend put the castle up for sale by auction and it was purchased by its present owners, Tamworth Corporation (now Tamworth Borough Council), for £3,000 in 1897 to mark Queen Victoria&#x27;s diamond jubilee. It was then opened to the public by the Earl of Dartmouth as a museum in 1899.

<doc id="256823" wikidata="Q180991" url="?curid=256823" title="Common merganser">
<text>The common merganser (North American) or goosander (Eurasian) (Mergus merganser) is a large sea duck of rivers and lakes in forested areas of Europe, Asia, and North America. The common merganser eats mainly fish. It nests in holes in trees.

==Taxonomy==
The first formal description of the common merganser was by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He introduced the current binomial name &quot;Mergus merganser&quot;. The genus name is a Latin word used by Pliny and other Roman authors to refer to an unspecified waterbird, and &quot;merganser&quot; is derived from &quot;mergus&quot; and &quot;anser&quot;, Latin for &quot;goose&quot;. In 1843 John James Audubon used the name &quot;Buff-breasted Merganser&quot; in addition to &quot;goosander&quot; in his book &quot;The Birds of America&quot;.

The three subspecies differ in only minor detail:
==Description==
It is long with a wingspan and a weight of ; males average slightly larger than females, but with some overlap. Like other species in the genus &quot;Mergus&quot;, it has a crest of longer head feathers, but these usually lie smoothly rounded behind the head, not normally forming an erect crest. Adult males in breeding plumage are easily distinguished, the body white with a variable salmon-pink tinge, the head black with an iridescent green gloss, the rump and tail grey, and the wings largely white on the inner half, black on the outer half. Females and males in &quot;eclipse&quot; (non-breeding plumage, July to October) are largely grey, with a reddish-brown head, white chin, and white secondary feathers on the wing. Juveniles (both sexes) are similar to adult females but also show a short black-edged white stripe between the eye and bill. The bill and legs are red to brownish-red, brightest on adult males, dullest on juveniles.

==Behaviour==

===Feeding===
Like the other mergansers, these piscivorous ducks have serrated edges to their bills to help them grip their prey, so they are often known as &quot;sawbills&quot;. In addition to fish, they take a wide range of other aquatic prey, such as molluscs, crustaceans, worms, insect larvae, and amphibians; more rarely, small mammals and birds may be taken. As in other birds with the character, the salmon-pink tinge shown variably by males is probably diet-related, obtained from the carotenoid pigments present in some crustaceans and fish. When not diving for food, they are usually seen swimming on the water surface, or resting on rocks in midstream or hidden among riverbank vegetation, or (in winter) on the edge of floating ice.

===Habits===
In most places, the common merganser is as much a frequenter of salt water as fresh water. In larger streams and rivers, they float down with the stream for a few miles, and either fly back again or more commonly fish their way back, diving incessantly the whole way. In smaller streams, they are present in pairs or smaller groups, and they float down, twisting round and round in the rapids, or fishing vigorously in a deep pool near the foot of a waterfall or rapid. When floating leisurely, they position themselves in water similar to ducks, but they also swim deep in water like cormorants, especially when swimming upstream. They often sit on a rock in the middle of the water, similar to cormorants, often half-opening their wings to the sun. To rise from water, they flap along the surface for many yards. Once they are airborne, their flight is strong and rapid. They often fish in a group forming a semicircle and driving the fish into shallow water, where they are captured easily. Their ordinary voice is a low, harsh croak, but during the breeding season, males in display, as well as young, make a plaintive, soft whistle. Generally, they are wary, and one or more birds stay on sentry duty to warn the flock of approaching danger. When disturbed, they often disgorge food before moving. Though they move clumsily on land, they resort to running when pressed, assuming a very upright position similar to penguins, and falling and stumbling frequently.

===Breeding===
Nesting is normally in a tree cavity, so it requires mature forest as its breeding habitat; they also readily use large nest boxes where provided, requiring an entrance hole in diameter. In places devoid of trees (like Central Asian mountains), they use holes in cliffs and steep, high banks, sometimes at considerable distances from the water. The female lays 6–17 (most often 8–12) white to yellowish eggs, and raises one brood in a season. The ducklings are taken by their mother on her back to rivers or lakes immediately after hatching, where they feed on freshwater invertebrates and small fish fry, fledging when 60–70 days old. The young are sexually mature at the age of two years. Common mergansers are known to form crèches, with single females having been observed with over 70 ducklings at one time. 

===Movements===
The species is a partial migrant, with birds moving away from areas where rivers and major lakes freeze in the winter, but resident where waters remain open. Eastern North American birds move south in small groups to the United States wherever ice-free conditions exist on lakes and rivers; on the milder Pacific coast, they are permanent residents. Scandinavian and Russian birds also migrate southwards, but western European birds, and a few in Japan, are largely resident. In some populations, the males also show distinct moult migration, leaving the breeding areas as soon as the young hatch to spend the summer (June to September) elsewhere. Notably, most of the western European male population migrates north to estuaries in Finnmark in northern Norway (principally Tanafjord) to moult, leaving the females to care for the ducklings. Much smaller numbers of males also use estuaries in eastern Scotland as a moulting area.

==Status and conservation==
Overall, the species is not threatened, though illegal persecution by game-fishing interests is a problem in some areas. In February 2020, a rare common merganser sighting was documented in Central Park, New York; the bird was in obvious distress, with its beak being trapped by a piece of debris.

Within western Europe, a marked southward spread has occurred from Scandinavia in the breeding range since about 1850, colonising Scotland in 1871, England in 1941, and also a strong increase in the population in the Alps. They are very scarce in Ireland, with regular breeding confined to a few pairs in County Wicklow.

The goosander is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds applies.

<doc id="256825" wikidata="Q1604638" url="?curid=256825" title="Order of precedence in China">
<text>The order of precedence in China is the ranking of political leaders in China for the purposes of event protocol and to arrange the ordering of names in official news bulletins, both written and televised. It is also sometimes used to assess perceived level of political power. Although there is no formally published ranking, there is usually an established convention and protocol, and the relative positions of Chinese political figures can usually be deduced from the order in meetings and especially by the time and order in which figures are covered by the official media. Since 1982, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party has been the highest-ranking official in the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC).

Depending on the person and the time period, the hierarchy will vary accordingly. Since the 1980s, Chinese political positions have become increasingly institutionalized. However, part of the power Chinese leaders carry still derives from who they are, rather than what position they hold.

Individuals can hold multiple top leadership titles but also be unable to claim to be the de facto head as was the case with Chairman of the Chinese Communist Party Hua Guofeng, when &quot;paramount leader&quot; Deng Xiaoping was present. The traditional ranking system was based upon the hierarchical line of the Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. The names on this list includes all those officially considered party and state leaders.

== Order of precedence ==

=== Applications of protocol ===
The Order of Precedence has gradually become normalized as the institutions of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the People&#x27;s Republic became more established and stable. Internal publications and official media adhere to strict ranking protocol when reporting news items or public announcements that involve multiple leaders. Similarly, the order is strictly adhered to when seating leaders at official meetings and functions.

Often, state media news programs, such as &quot;Xinwen Lianbo&quot;, overlook the actual importance of the story attached to each leader. Rather the news order is determined by political ranking alone. For instance, if a higher-ranked leader is chairing a routine meeting, while a lower-ranked leader is visiting an earthquake disaster zone, the routine meeting will take precedence over the disaster in the order that they are reported.

Protocol ordering of leaders is perhaps most visible at large gatherings of party and state leaders, such as Party Congresses, National People&#x27;s Congresses, the funeral or memorial service of former leaders, or major anniversary celebrations.

The current order of precedence applies to party, state, and military leaders. It generally follows an order set out by the institutions to which these leaders belong; further ranking of individual leaders are applied within each of the institutions. Where an individual belongs to numerous party and state institutions, they are usually only mentioned on first instance for their highest-ranking post. Since China is a single-party communist state, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party is generally considered to hold the highest position in the political system.

=== Order of institutions ===
The organs of the party, state, and military, have a generally applied rank order, as follows:
# Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party
## Politburo
### Standing Committee of the Politburo
## Central Secretariat
# Highest state power and legislative organ: National People&#x27;s Congress (NPC)
## Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress (NPCSC)
# Presidency (as a state organ)
# Highest executive organ: State Council
# Top-level united front organisation:
#:: National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC)
# Highest military organ: Central Military Commission (CMC), &quot;one institution bearing two names&quot;:
## The CMC of the Chinese Communist Party
## The CMC of the People&#x27;s Republic of China
# Highest supervisory organs (two institutions sharing one office):
## Central Commission for Discipline Inspection (CCDI)
## National Supervisory Commission of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (NSC)
# Highest judicial organs:
## Supreme People&#x27;s Court (SPC)
## Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate (SPP)

NB:
* The ranking of a Vice President of the PRC is normally based on whether he is a current or former Politburo Standing Committee member or other member of the Politburo. Press coverage of the March 2018 National People&#x27;s Congress ranked the new Vice President Wang Qishan immediately after the Standing Committee, from which he recently retired.

=== National Leaders ===
National leaders are ranked based on the offices they hold, their seniority, or sometimes simply their perceived personal prestige. During the Mao years, ranking of leaders was fairly arbitrary. For instance, during the Cultural Revolution, Mao himself dictated the exact protocol sequence depending on who was held in favour at the time.

Since 1982, rankings gradually stabilized and more consistent patterns could be observed. For instance, the General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party always ranked first in the protocol sequence. This is despite the fact that some General Secretaries were not the pre-eminent political leaders. For example, General Secretaries Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang (both ranked first) were, in practice, subordinate to &quot;paramount leader&quot; Deng Xiaoping, who was ranked behind them in protocol. Deng at the time served as Chairman of the Central Military Commission and was ranked second overall in the leadership hierarchy.

The President is a largely ceremonial post, but it is typically ranked immediately after the General Secretary and before other offices of the state. When the President and General Secretary are two different people (prior to 1993, and in brief interregnums in 2003 and 2013), the President is ranked second to the General Secretary. Between 1982 and 1987, the President ranked after the Premier.

After the President, the Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, the Premier, and the Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference follow; this ordering seems to supersede the Standing Committee order when officeholders are not themselves part of the Standing Committee, although typically since 1993 the heads of the &quot;four national bodies&quot; are concurrently members of the Standing Committee. Between 1997 and 2002, NPC Chair Li Peng was ranked second. During the same period, the Premier, Zhu Rongji, as head of government, was ranked third. The Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) was ranked fourth. This ordering remained consistent between 2002 and 2012, when NPC Chair Wu Bangguo ranked above Premier Wen Jiabao. However, in 2013, this ordering changed. The Premier, Li Keqiang, was ranked 2nd, immediately after the General Secretary, and in front of the NPC Chairman Zhang Dejiang.

The Politburo Standing Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, colloquially called the &quot;Zhengzhiju Changweihui&quot; in Chinese, is the apex of political power in China. Its members (&quot;Zhengzhiju Changwei&quot;) are strictly ranked. The heads of the four national bodies typically occupy the top four ranking spots of the Standing Committee. The other members of the Standing Committee are ranked immediately after them. The rankings of the remaining Standing Committee members are determined by a combination of the offices they hold and their seniority. For example, Li Changchun served as a Standing Committee member with no strictly defined office between 2002 and 2012; between 2002 and 2007, he was ranked eighth in protocol sequence, but in 2007, having now served one term on the body, his rank rose to fifth, immediately after CPPCC chair Jia Qinglin and in front of putative successor and executive secretary of the Secretariat Xi Jinping.

The current ranking of the Politburo Standing Committee is as follows:

=== Vice president ===
Between 2018 and 2023, Vice President Wang Qishan, himself a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, has been placed in front of the other members of the Politburo and in front of former leaders, and immediately after the sitting Politburo Standing Committee members. After Wang Qishan retired in 2023, his successor Han Zheng, is also a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, which placed Han in the same rank as Wang.

=== Other members of the CCP Politburo ===
From its early history, the Politburo was theoretically a &quot;leadership collective&quot;, with equal status accorded to each of its members. In practice, the Politburo Standing Committee members have elevated status within the body and are considered its most important and powerful members. When a new Politburo member list is first announced, or when the Politburo membership is being reported independently of other bodies, it is ordered by &quot;the number of strokes in the surname character&quot;, a traditional method of &#x27;alphabetization&#x27; of Chinese names; in these cases, all Politburo members, including PSC members, are named in this sequence. Unlike the PSC, Politburo members are not ranked based on presumed level of power. When it comes to seating protocol and official announcements about the Politburo in conjunction with other party and state bodies, the Politburo Standing Committee members are announced first, before the rest of the Politburo members.

&quot;The members of the Politburo Standing Committee are also Politburo members; since they are already named above, they are omitted from this list&quot;
* Ma Xingrui, party secretary of Xinjiang
* Wang Yi, director of the Office of the Central Foreign Affairs Commission
* Yin Li, party secretary of Beijing
* Shi Taifeng, head of the United Front Work Department
* Liu Guozhong, vice premier of the State Council
* Li Ganjie, head of the Organization Department
* Li Shulei, head of the Publicity Department
* Li Hongzhong, first-ranked vice chairman of the National People&#x27;s Congress Standing Committee
* He Weidong, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission
* He Lifeng, vice premier of the State Council
* Zhang Youxia, vice chairman of the Central Military Commission
* Zhang Guoqing, vice premier of the State Council
* Chen Wenqing, secretary of the Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission
* Chen Jining, party secretary of Shanghai
* Chen Min&#x27;er, party secretary of Tianjin
* Yuan Jiajun, party secretary of Chongqing
* Huang Kunming, party secretary of Guangdong

=== Living former members of the Politburo Standing Committee ===
Immediately following the 16th Party Congress, Jiang Zemin was ranked 2nd overall on the leadership protocol hierarchy, immediately after Hu Jintao. At the conclusion of the 18th Party Congress, when Hu Jintao retired as General Secretary, Jiang was ranked 2nd overall, after Xi Jinping, and Hu Jintao was ranked 3rd, after Jiang. Since 2013, judging mostly based on the official obituary notices of various deceased party officials, Hu seems to have progressively moved &quot;lower&quot; on the protocol strata, first below all current members of the Politburo Standing Committee, and as of 2014, behind all members of the sitting Politburo.

At major functions, Jiang and Hu sat immediately next to Xi Jinping, visually giving them prominence over the other Politburo Standing Committee members on television footage. However, in the official bulletins of the functions, the names of Jiang and Hu were announced after all sitting members of the Politburo. This convention was used at the National Day banquet held on September 30, 2014, the 2015 China Victory Day Parade atop Tiananmen Gate, the opening session of the 19th Party Congress in October 2017, the military parade at 70th anniversary of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in October 2019, 100th Anniversary of the Chinese Communist Party in July 2021, the opening session of the 20th Party Congress in October 2022, and Jiang Zemin&#x27;s funeral in December 2022.

Former Politburo Standing Committee members who were not &quot;in good standing&quot; in official party evaluations are not included in this list; this includes those ousted from positions of power but not formally expelled from the party. For instance, Zhao Ziyang and Hua Guofeng were typically omitted from this list when they were alive. Zhou Yongkang, who was convicted on corruption charges in 2015, was also removed from this list. Hu Qili is omitted from this list.

== Former national leaders ==
Each year, state media releases a list of &quot;old comrades&quot; that the current cohort of leaders would pay their respects to during the days leading up to Chinese New Year. These leaders are strictly ranked based on the hierarchy of their positions during their last term in office. In general, these rankings follow the rules as set out below:
* Those who held paramount leadership
* Those who held top leadership posts over one of the four major state or party organs - that is, the head of the Central Committee, National People&#x27;s Congress, State Council, and CPPCC National Committee.
* Other former members of the Politburo Standing Committee
* Those who held Politburo membership
* Those who held Secretariat membership
* Those who served as Vice-Chairs of the National People&#x27;s Congress
* Those who served as Vice-Premiers or State Councilors (and not otherwise members of the Politburo)
* Those who served as President of the Supreme People&#x27;s Court or Supreme People&#x27;s Procuratorate
* Those who served as vice-chairpersons of the CPPCC National Committee

In general, if leaders are of equal rank on all accounts, those who belong to an earlier cohort are ranked prior to those of later cohorts; leaders are ranked by the last substantive position they held. For example, Li Tieying is ranked among the vice-chairmen of the National People&#x27;s Congress, and not among the Politburo members, even though he would have qualified for higher ranking among Politburo members - he retired while holding the post NPC vice-chair. Similarly, Hu Qili was a former member of the Politburo Standing Committee, but he was demoted following the Tiananmen Square protests of 1989 and the last position he held prior to retirement was one of the Vice-Chairs of the CPPCC, hence he is ranked among CPPCC Vice-Chairs in protocol sequence.

== Rankings below the National Leadership ==
Within the People&#x27;s Republic of China, there is a statutory &quot;National Civil Service Rankings System&quot; to determine ranking of officials below the minister-level, stretching from the very important positions (Provincial Party Secretaries, for instance) to the lowest positions (for example, someone who is responsible for a township office). Their relative ranking determines their annual salary, living stipends, entitlement to official residences and vehicles, pensions, benefits, and so forth. Provincial leaders do not enjoy an elevated protocol rank in their own province of jurisdiction. Rather they must still be placed behind all national leaders listed above.

For the purposes of protocol rankings, the heads of national ministries technically hold the same rank as provincial governors. Therefore, they do not qualify as &quot;national leaders&quot;. Departmental heads of the CCP, and ministers of the State Council are both called &quot;bùzhǎng&quot; (部长; literally &quot;Head of Department&quot;). However, many Communist Party Department heads, such as heads of the Organization and Propaganda departments, almost always hold seats on the Politburo, and thus are ranked as &quot;national leaders&quot;. Ministers of central government departments rarely hold Politburo seats. When all else is equal, the party department heads rank above state department heads; for example, the head of the International Liaison Department of the Chinese Communist Party will always rank ahead of the Minister of Foreign Affairs if they appear in the same function. In a similar vein, the provincial Party Secretary will always rank above the provincial Governor.

The hierarchy of party vs. state positions is strictly adhered to for official protocol, demonstrating the &#x27;vanguard&#x27; status of the Communist Party in Chinese politics. Generally, party positions are treated with more prestige than state positions of an equal level, but technically the official civil service privileges are the same for party and state officials of the same administrative level.

=== Local Party Committee rankings ===
A Party Committee is the &quot;de facto&quot; highest ruling council of any given jurisdiction in the PRC, except for the Special Administrative Regions of Hong Kong and Macau.

In provincial, municipal, and other local-level protocol rankings, the four main institutions generally follow the ranking of:
# Party Secretary
# Chief of Government (Governor in Provinces or Mayor in Directly Governed Cities, usually a Deputy Secretary)
# Chairman of the People&#x27;s Congress
# Chairman of the regional People&#x27;s Political Consultative Conference

Provincial party standing committees are powerful bodies whose membership is vetted directly by the Organization Department of the Chinese Communist Party based on the &quot;nomenklatura&quot; system. The members of these bodies are generally ranked by date of accession to sub-provincial rank, although in practice there appears to be some variation to this rule.

<text>André-Louis Debierne (; 14 July 1874 – 31 August 1949) was a French chemist. He is often considered the discoverer of the element actinium, though H. W. Kirby disputed this in 1971 and gave credit instead to German chemist Friedrich Oskar Giesel.

==Biography==
Debierne studied at the elite École supérieure de physique et de chimie industrielles de la ville de Paris (ESPCI ParisTech). 

He was a student of Charles Friedel, was a close friend of Pierre and Marie Curie and was associated with their work. In 1899, he discovered the radioactive element actinium, as a result of continuing the work with pitchblende that the Curies had initiated.

After the death of Pierre Curie in 1906, Debierne helped Marie Curie carry on and worked with her in teaching and research.

In 1911, he and Marie Curie prepared radium in metallic form in visible amounts. They did not keep it metallic, however. Having demonstrated the metal&#x27;s existence as a matter of scientific curiosity, they reconverted it into compounds with which they might continue their researches.

<doc id="256830" wikidata="Q16384841" url="?curid=256830" title="Tom Thumb">
<text>Tom Thumb is a character of English folklore. &quot;The History of Tom Thumb&quot; was published in 1621 and was the first known fairy tale printed in English. The earliest allusions to Tom occur in various 16th-century works such as Reginald Scot&#x27;s &quot;Discovery of Witchcraft&quot; (1584), where Tom is cited as one of the supernatural folk employed by servant maids to frighten children in a magical world with magic and mana. Tattershall in Lincolnshire, England, reputedly has the home and grave of Tom Thumb.

Aside from his own tales, Tom figures in Henry Fielding&#x27;s 1730 play &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;, a companion piece to his &quot;The Author&#x27;s Farce&quot;. It was expanded into a single 1731 piece titled &quot;The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the History of Tom Thumb the Great&quot;.

In the mid-18th century, books began to be published specifically for children (some with their authorship attributed to &quot;Tommy Thumb&quot;), and by the mid-19th century, Tom was a fixture of the nursery library. The tale took on moral overtones and some writers, such as Charlotte Mary Yonge, cleansed questionable passages. Dinah Mulock, however, refrained from scrubbing the tale of its vulgarities. Tom Thumb&#x27;s story has been adapted into several films.

==History==
Tom Thumb may have been a real person born around 1519, as there is a grave purporting to be his. It is set into the floor adjacent to the font of the main chapel in Holy Trinity Church at Tattershall, Lincolnshire, UK. The inscription reads: &quot;T. THUMB, Aged 101 Died 1620&quot;. The grave measures just 16&quot; (40 cm) in length. However, without any proof this is likely to be a later forgery or joke, for in his 1846 text &quot;Popular Rhymes and Nursery Tales&quot; (p.83) James Orchard Halliwell wrote that: &quot;According to popular tradition, Tom Thumb died at Lincoln, and a little blue flagstone in the pavement of the cathedral used to be pointed out as his monument.&quot; This source therefore suggests that the &quot;grave&quot; at Holy Trinity Church was probably engraved post -1846. 

The earliest surviving text is a 40-page booklet printed in London for Thomas Langley in 1621 entitled &quot;The History of Tom Thumbe, the Little, for his small stature surnamed, King Arthur&#x27;s Dwarfe: whose Life and adventures containe many strange and wonderfull accidents, published for the delight of merry Time-spenders&quot;. The author is presumed to be Londoner Richard Johnson (1579–1659?) because his initials appear on the last page. The only known copy is in the Morgan Library &amp; Museum, New York.

Tom was already a traditional folk character when the booklet was printed, and it is likely that printed materials circulated prior to Johnson&#x27;s. It is not known how much Johnson contributed to Tom&#x27;s character or his adventures. William Fulke referred to Tom in 1579 in &quot;Heskins Parleament Repealed&quot;, and Thomas Nashe referred to him in 1592 in his prose satire on the vices of the age &quot;Pierce Penniless, His Supplication to the Divell&quot;. Reginald Scot listed Tom in his &quot;Discoverie of Witchcraft&quot; (1584) as one of the creatures used by servant maids to frighten children, along with witches, dwarfs, elves, fairies, giants, and other supernatural folk.
Tom was mentioned by James Field in &quot;Coryat&#x27;s Crudities&quot; (1611): &quot;Tom Thumbe is dumbe, until the pudding creepe, in which he was intomb&#x27;d, then out doth peepe.&quot; The incident of the pudding was the most popular in connection with the character. It is alluded to in Ben Jonson&#x27;s masque of the Fortunate Isles: &quot;Thomas Thumb in a pudding fat, with Doctor Rat.&quot;

Richard Johnson&#x27;s &quot;History&quot; may have been in circulation as early as this date because the title page woodblock in the 1621 edition shows great wear. Johnson himself makes it clear in the preface that Tom was long known by &quot;old and young... Bachelors and Maids... and Shepheard and the young Plow boy&quot;.

Tom&#x27;s tale was reprinted countless times in Britain, and was being sold in America as early as 1686. A metrical version was published in 1630 entitled &quot;Tom Thumbe, His Life and Death: Wherein is declared many Maruailous Acts of Manhood, full of wonder, and strange merriments: Which little Knight liued in King Arthurs time, and famous in the Court of Great Brittaine&quot;. The book was reprinted many times, and two more parts were added to the first around 1700. The three parts were reprinted many times.
In 1711, William Wagstaffe published &quot;A Comment upon The History of Tom Thumbe&quot;. In 1730, English dramatist Henry Fielding used Tom Thumb as the central figure of a play by that name, which he rewrote in 1731 as the farce &quot;The Tragedy of Tragedies, or the History of Tom Thumb the Great&quot;. The play is filled with 18th-century political and literary satire and is intended as a parody of heroic tragedies. The title of &quot;The Great&quot; may be intended as a reference to politician Sir Robert Walpole who was often called &quot;The Great.&quot;

Henry Fielding&#x27;s tragedy &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; was the basis for an opera constructed by Kane O&#x27;Hara. Fielding&#x27;s Tom is cast as a mighty warrior and a conqueror of giants, despite his stature, as well as the object of desire for many of the ladies at court. The plot is largely concerned with the various love triangles amongst the characters, who include Princess Huncamunca, giantess Glumdalca, and Queen Dollalolla (Arthur&#x27;s wife in this version). Matters are complicated when Arthur awards Tom the hand of Huncamunca in marriage which results in Dollalolla and the jealous Grizzle seeking revenge. Eventually, Tom dies when swallowed by a cow, but his ghost returns. At the conclusion, Tom&#x27;s ghost is killed by Grizzle and most of the cast kill each other in duels or take their own lives in grief.

Fielding&#x27;s play was later adapted into a spoof on opera conventions called &quot;The Opera of Operas; or Tom Thumb the Great&quot; by playwrights Eliza Haywood and William Hatchett. This version includes a happy ending in which Tom is spat back out by the cow and the others are resurrected by Merlin&#x27;s magic. This is considered to be a satirical comment on the unlikely and tacked-on nature of many happy endings in literature and drama.
In the mid-18th century, books began appearing specifically for children, and Tom was cited as the author of titles such as &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Song Book&quot; (1744) and &quot;Tommy Thumb&#x27;s Little Story Book&quot; (c. 1760). In 1791, Joseph Ritson remarked that Tom&#x27;s popularity was known far and wide: &quot;Every city, town, village, shop, stall, man, woman, and child, in the kingdom, can bear witness to it.&quot;

Tom&#x27;s story was originally intended for adults, but it was relegated to the nursery by the mid-19th century. Vulgar episodes were sanitized, and moralizing colored the tale. In Charlotte Mary Yonge&#x27;s 1856 adaptation, Tom resists his natural urges to play impish pranks, renounces his ties to Fairyland, and pronounces himself a Christian. As Mordred&#x27;s rebellion wears on in the last days of Arthur&#x27;s reign, Tom refuses to return to Fairyland, preferring to die as an honorable Christian.

In 1863, Dinah Maria Craik Mulock refused to cleanse the tale&#x27;s questionable passages and let the story speak for itself. She adds material, and Tom has adventures that again involve being swallowed by a miller and a salmon, being imprisoned in a mousetrap, angering King Thunston and his queen, and finally dying from the poisonous breath of a spider. Tom&#x27;s tale has since been adapted to all sorts of children&#x27;s books with new material added and existing material reworked, but his mischievous nature and his bravery remain undiminished.

==Plot==

Richard Johnson&#x27;s &quot;The History of Tom Thumbe&quot; of 1621 tells that in the days of King Arthur, old Thomas of the Mountain, a plowman and a member of the King&#x27;s Council, wants nothing more than a son, even if he is no bigger than his thumb. He sends his wife to consult with Merlin. In three months&#x27; time, she gives birth to the diminutive Tom Thumb. The &quot;Queene of Fayres&quot; and her attendants act as midwives. She provides Tom with an oak leaf hat, a shirt of cobweb, a doublet of thistledown, stockings of apple rind, and shoes of mouse&#x27;s skin.

Tom cheats at games with other boys and because of his many tricks, the boys will not associate with him. Tom retaliates by using magic to hang his mother&#x27;s pots and glasses from a sunbeam. When his fellows try the same, their pots and glasses fall and are broken. Thereafter, Tom stays home under his mother&#x27;s supervision. At Christmas, she makes puddings, but Tom falls into the batter and is boiled into one of them. When a tinker comes begging, Tom&#x27;s mother inadvertently gives him the pudding containing her son.

His mother thereafter keeps a closer watch upon him. One day, he accompanies her to the field to milk the cows. He sits under a thistle, but a red cow swallows him. The cow is given a laxative and Tom passes from her in a &quot;cow pat&quot;. He is taken home and cleaned. Another day, he accompanies his father for the seed sowing and rides in the horse&#x27;s ear. Tom is set down in the field to play the scarecrow, but a raven carries him away. His parents search for him, but are unable to find him.
The raven drops Tom at the castle of a giant. The cruel giant swallows the tiny boy like a pill. Tom thrashes about so much in the giant&#x27;s stomach that he is vomited into the sea. There, he is eaten once more by a fish which is caught for King Arthur&#x27;s supper. The cook is astonished to see the little man emerge from the fish. Tom then becomes King Arthur&#x27;s Dwarf.

Tom becomes a favorite at King Arthur&#x27;s royal court, especially among the ladies. There is revelry; Tom joins the jousting and dances in the palm of a Maid of Honour. He goes home briefly to see his parents, taking some money from the treasury with the king&#x27;s permission, then returns to court. The Queene of Fayres finds him asleep on a rose and leaves him several gifts: an enchanted hat of knowledge, a ring of invisibility, a shape-changing girdle, and shoes to take him anywhere in a moment.

Tom falls seriously ill when a lady blows her nose, but is cured by the physician to King Twaddell of the Pygmies. He takes a ride in his walnut shell coach and meets Garagantua. Each boasts of his many powers. When Garagantua threatens to harm Tom, he is cast under an enchantment and Tom hurries home to safety. King Arthur listens with amazement to Tom&#x27;s many adventures.

Richard Johnson&#x27;s 1621 narrative ends here, but he promised his readers a sequel that has never been found, if published at all. In 1630, a metrical version in three parts was published that continues Tom&#x27;s adventures.

===Later narratives===
Other versions paint a different picture to Tom&#x27;s end. Dinah Mulock continued the tale and noted that Tom exhausted himself with jousting but recovered in Fairyland. When he returned to Arthur&#x27;s court, he accidentally landed in a bowl of the king&#x27;s frumenty. Tom enrages the cook and is threatened with beheading. He seeks refuge in the mouth of a passing slack-jawed miller. Sensing tiny voices and movements within him, the man believes he is possessed. He yawns and Tom emerges, but the Miller is so angry he tosses Tom into a river where he is swallowed by a salmon. The fish is caught, taken to the King&#x27;s kitchen, and Tom is found and kept in a mousetrap until King Arthur forgives him.
The court goes hunting and Tom joins them upon his steed, a mouse. A cat catches the mouse and Tom is injured. He is carried to Fairyland where he recovers and dwells for several years. When he returns to court, King Thunston now reigns. Charmed by the little man, the king gives Tom a tiny coach pulled by six mice. This makes the queen jealous as she received no such gifts and she frames Tom with being insolent to her. Tom attempts to escape on a passing butterfly, but is caught and imprisoned in a mousetrap. He is freed by a curious cat and once more wins back the favor of King Thunston. Sadly, he does not live to enjoy it as he is killed by a spider&#x27;s bite. Tom is laid to rest beneath rosebush and a marble monument is raised to his memory with the epitaph:

:Here lies Tom Thumb, King Arthur’s knight,
:Who died by a spider’s cruel bite.
:He was well known in Arthur’s court,
:Where he afforded gallant sport;
:He rode at tilt and tournament,
:And on a mouse a-hunting went;
:Alive he fill’d the court with mirth
:His death to sorrow soon gave birth.
:Wipe, wipe your eyes, and shake your head
:And cry, ‘Alas! Tom Thumb is dead.

<doc id="256832" wikidata="Q5535086" url="?curid=256832" title="Geographical pricing">
<text>Geographical pricing, in marketing, is the practice of modifying a basic list price based on the geographical location of the buyer. It is intended to reflect the costs of shipping to different locations. There are several ways to apply the cost of shipping to the prices.

== FOB origin == 

With FOB (Free on Board) origin (or FOB plant) pricing, the shipping cost from the factory or warehouse is paid by the purchaser. Ownership of the goods is transferred to the buyer as soon as it is placed aboard a common carrier. Typically the choice of carrier is made by the buyer. FOB pricing is utilized by larger businesses capable of arranging their own logistics and marketing intermediaries.

With a variation of the FOB pricing called &quot;FOB origin-freight allowed&quot; or &quot;freight absorbed&quot;, the terms allow buyers to subtract all or part of the cost of transportation from their bills. This amounts to a price discount, and is used as a market expansion tactic by the companies with high fixed costs.

== Uniform delivered pricing == 
Uniform delivered pricing is the opposite of the FOB origin pricing, as the same price is quoted to all customers. The transportation costs are averaged across all buyers, and the nearby customers are in effect subsidizing the faraway ones (paying more for the delivery than it costs the seller, the difference is called the phantom freight). This approach resembles the fees for the first-class mail service, thus uniform pricing has another name, postage stamp pricing.

== Zone pricing ==

Zone pricing (also zonal pricing) is a variant of the uniform pricing: the prices are the same within a &quot;zone&quot; (a geographical slice of the market), prices increase with the costs of shipping and reflect the average delivery cost inside the zone. This is the approach taken, for example, by the parcel delivery services. The zone pricing reduces the phantom freight, yet keeps the pricing structure relatively simple, thus making it easier for the seller to compete in a faraway market.

The definition of zones is sometimes done by drawing concentric circles on a map with the plant or warehouse at the center and each circle defining the boundary of a price zone. Instead of using circles, irregularly shaped price boundaries can be drawn that reflect geography, population density, transportation infrastructure, and shipping cost. (The term &quot;zone pricing&quot; can also refer to the practice of setting prices that reflect local competitive conditions, i.e., the market forces of supply and demand, rather than actual cost of transportation.)

=== Gasoline ===
Gasoline marketers find it profitable to map out zones by determining what price the local market can bear and charging the gas station owners different wholesale prices depending on the zone.

Zone pricing, as practiced in the gasoline industry in the United States, is the pricing of gasoline based on a complex and secret weighting of factors, such as the number of competing stations, number of vehicles, average traffic flow, population density, and geographic characteristics.

Many businesspeople and economists state that gasoline zone pricing merely reflects the costs of doing business in a complex and volatile marketplace. Critics contend that industry monopoly and the ability to control not only industry-owned &quot;corporate&quot; stations, but locally owned or franchise stations, make zone pricing into an excuse to raise gasoline prices virtually at will. Oil industry representatives contend that while they set wholesale and &quot;dealer tank wagon&quot; prices, individual dealers are free to see whatever prices they wish and that this practice in itself causes widespread price variations outside industry control.

== Basing-point pricing ==
With basing-point pricing, certain locations are designated as basing points. The quoted price includes the freight fees from the basing point closest to the customer (not necessarily being the place the product is actually shipped from). The well-known example was the &quot;Pittsburgh-plus&quot; scheme, where all steel deliveries in the US were priced as if the shipment originated in Pittsburgh, even as the steel manufacturing moved away from Pittsburgh. The basing-point pricing is unpopular with the buyers.

<doc id="256840" wikidata="Q93036" url="?curid=256840" title="A. K. Dewdney">
<text>Alexander Keewatin Dewdney (August 5, 1941 – March 9, 2024) was a Canadian mathematician, computer scientist, author, filmmaker, and conspiracy theorist. Dewdney was the son of Canadian artist and author Selwyn Dewdney and art therapist Irene Dewdney, and brother of poet Christopher Dewdney.

==Personal life==
Dewdney was born in London, Ontario on August 5, 1941, and died there on March 9, 2024, at the age of 82.

==Art and fiction==
In his student days, Dewdney made a number of influential experimental films, including &quot;Malanga&quot;, on the poet Gerald Malanga, &quot;Four Girls&quot;, &quot;Scissors&quot;, and his most ambitious film, the pre-structural &quot;Maltese Cross Movement&quot;. Margaret Atwood wrote that a poetry scrapbook by Dewdney, based on the &quot;Maltese Cross Movement&quot; film, &quot;raises scrapbooking to an art&quot;.

The Academy Film Archive has preserved two of Dewdney&#x27;s films: &quot;The Maltese Cross Movement&quot; in 2009 and &quot;Wildwood Flower&quot; in 2011.

Dewdney wrote two novels, &quot;The Planiverse&quot; (about an imaginary two-dimensional world) and &quot;Hungry Hollow: The Story of a Natural Place&quot;. Dewdney lived in London, Ontario where he held the position of Professor Emeritus at the University of Western Ontario.

==Computing, mathematics, and science==
Dewdney wrote a number of books on mathematics, computing, and bad science. He also founded and edited a magazine on recreational programming called &quot;Algorithm&quot; between 1989 and 1993.

Dewdney followed Martin Gardner and Douglas Hofstadter in authoring &quot;Scientific American&quot; magazine&#x27;s recreational mathematics column, renamed to &quot;Computer Recreations&quot;, then &quot;Mathematical Recreations&quot;, from 1984 to 1991. He published more than 10 books on scientific possibilities and puzzles. Dewdney was a co-inventor of programming game &quot;Core War&quot;.

Beginning in the nineties, Dewdney worked on biology, both as a field ecologist and as a mathematical biologist, contributing a solution to the problem of determining the underlying dynamics of species abundance in natural communities.

==Conspiracy theories==
Dewdney was a member of the 9/11 truth movement, and theorized that the planes used in the September 11 attacks had been emptied of passengers and were flown by remote control.
He based these claims in part on a series of experiments (one with funding from Japan&#x27;s TV Asahi) that, he claimed, showed that cell phones do not work on airplanes, from which he concluded that the phone calls received from hijacked passengers during the attacks must have been faked.

<doc id="256842" wikidata="Q460334" url="?curid=256842" title="List of states in the Holy Roman Empire">
<text>This list of states in the [[Holy Roman Empire]] includes any territory ruled by an authority that had been granted imperial immediacy, as well as many other feudal entities such as lordships, sous-fiefs, and allodial fiefs.

The Holy Roman Empire was a complex political entity that existed in central Europe for most of the medieval and early modern periods and was generally ruled by a German-speaking Emperor. The states that composed the Empire, while enjoying a form of territorial authority called &quot;Landeshoheit&quot; that granted them many attributes of sovereignty, were never fully sovereign states in the sense that term is understood presently.

In the 18th century, the Holy Roman Empire consisted of approximately 1,800 such territories, the majority being tiny estates owned by the families of Imperial Knights. This page does not directly contain the list but discusses the format of the various lists and offers some background to understand the complex organisation of the Holy Roman Empire. The lists themselves can be accessed via the alphabetical navigation box below; each letter will lead the reader to a page on which states of the Empire that began with that letter are listed.

==Table of states==

While any such list could never be definitive, the list attempts to be as comprehensive as possible. It is sorted alphabetically and split into separate articles linked below. There is also a separate list of Free Imperial Cities and a list of participants in the Imperial Diet as of 1792.

=== Key ===
*The &quot;Circle&quot; column shows the Imperial Circle (&quot;Reichskreis&quot;) that the state belonged to.
*The &quot;Bench&quot; column shows where the state was represented in the Imperial Diet (&quot;Reichstag&quot;).

Note that in the &quot;Circle&quot; column, &quot;n/a&quot; denotes a state that had ceased to exist before the &quot;Reichsreform&quot;.
Other abbreviations used in the list are:
*Abp. (Archbishopric)
*Bp. (Bishopric)
*Co. (Countship) (sometimes also called county)
*D. (Duchy)
*Ldg. (Landgraviate)
*Mrg. (Margraviate)
*Pr. (Principality)
*RA (Reichsabtei) (Imperial abbacy, a monastery enjoying Imperial immediacy)

==Definition of terms==

*Hochstift: the territory ruled by a bishop as a prince.
*Imperial Abbey (&quot;Reichsabtei&quot;): an abbey with imperial immediacy. Its head was a &quot;Reichsabt&quot;, literally &#x27;Imperial Abbot&#x27; or &#x27;Abbot of the Empire&#x27;. A monastery with similar status was a &quot;Reichskloster&quot;.
*Imperial Circle (&quot;Reichskreis&quot;, plural &quot;Reichskreise&quot;): a regional grouping of states of the Holy Roman Empire, primarily for the purpose of organising a common defence and of collecting imperial taxes, but also as a means of organisation within the Imperial Diet.
*Imperial Diet (&quot;Reichstag&quot;): the parliament of the Holy Roman Empire. The same name was used in the North German Confederation and in Germany until 1945.
*Imperial Estate (&quot;Reichsstand&quot;, plural &quot;Reichsstände&quot;): an entity in the Holy Roman Empire with a vote in the Imperial Diet. Several states had no seats in the Empire, while some officials (such as the Hereditary Usher) were non-voting members; neither qualified as Imperial States.
*Imperial Free City (&quot;freie Reichsstadt&quot;): a city formally responsible to the emperor only – as opposed to the majority of cities in the Empire, which belonged to the territory of one of the many princes (&quot;Fürsten&quot;) of the Empire, such as dukes or prince-bishops. Free cities also had independent representation in the Imperial Diet of the Holy Roman Empire.
*Imperial immediacy (&quot;Reichsfreiheit&quot; or &quot;Reichsunmittelbarkeit&quot;; adjectives &quot;reichsfrei, reichsunmittelbar&quot;) was a privileged feudal and political status, a form of statehood within the Holy Roman Empire. The ruler of an immediate city, abbey or territory had no overlord other than the Holy Roman Emperor and the Imperial Diet. Immediate states had the right to collect taxes and tolls themselves, and held juridical rights (including the &quot;Blutgericht&quot;, &#x27;high&#x27; justice including capital punishment) themselves. &quot;De facto&quot;, immediacy corresponded to a semi-independence with a far-reaching autonomy.
*Imperial Reform: In 1495, an attempt was made at a Diet in the city of Worms to give the disintegrating Holy Roman Empire a new structure, commonly referred to as Imperial Reform (in German: &quot;Reichsreform&quot;).
*Imperial State (&quot;Reichsstand&quot;, plural &quot;Reichsstände&quot;): an entity in the Holy Roman Empire with a vote in the Imperial Diet.
*&quot;Kleinstaaterei&quot; is a German word mostly used to describe the territorial fragmentation in Germany and neighboring regions during the Holy Roman Empire (especially after the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War). It refers to the large number of nearly sovereign small and medium-sized secular and ecclesiastical principalities and free imperial cities, some of which were little larger than a single town or the surrounding grounds of the monastery of an Imperial abbey.
*League of cities is Military alliance and mutual assistance strengthened the position of imperial cities, especially during the interregnum period of the 13th to 14th century.
*Mediatization is the loss of imperial immediacy through annexation by a larger state. A mediatized lord lost most of his power over his former territory, but retained his title and most of his personal privileges.
*Prince of the Empire: any ruling Prince whose territory is a member of the Holy Roman Empire (not only German-speaking countries, but also many bordering and extensive neighbouring regions) and entitled to a voting seat (or in a collective voting unit, such as a Grafenbank) in the Imperial Diet.
*Prince-abbot (&quot;Fürstabt&quot;) or prince-abbess (&quot;Äbtissin&quot;): an abbot or abbess with the rank of prince. Prince-abbots (but not prince-abbesses) had a seat and vote on the Ecclesiastical Bench of the College of Ruling Princes of the Imperial Diet, where they sat alongside the prince-bishops.
*Prince-bishop (&quot;Fürstbischof&quot;): a bishop with the rank, &quot;ex officio&quot;, of prince (&quot;Fürst&quot;). As a prince, he was the temporal ruler of a Hochstift; as a bishop, he exercised the spiritual duties of an ordinary bishop over his diocese, which was always larger than his Hochstift. Prince-bishops had seat and voice on the Ecclesiastical Bench of the College of Ruling Princes of the Imperial Diet. Nearly all the bishops of the Holy Roman Empire outside the Habsburg lands were prince-bishops.
*Prince-elector or electoral prince (&quot;Kurfürst&quot;, pl. &quot;Kurfürsten&quot;): a member of the electoral college of the Holy Roman Empire, having the function of electing the Holy Roman Emperors.
*Secularization: the transfer of property from ecclesiastical to civil possession or use.

==Notes column==

The &quot;Notes&quot; column shows, in capsule form,
* the territorial development of the different states or polities (acquisition or loss of possessions, union of rulers or dynasties, etc.);
* the royal or noble dynasties, including their various branches, which ruled over territories or polities;
* the transmission of succession rights (marriage, female succession, conquest, cession, pledge, etc.);
* the attributes of &quot;statehood&quot; (right to mint coins, holding markets and fairs, entering into treaties and pacts, appointment of civil officials, etc.); and
* the size of territory and population of the various polities whenever these are available.

===Estate of the Empire (&quot;Reichsstand&quot;)===

The following excerpt from François Velde&#x27;s &quot;Unequal and Morganatic Marriages in German Law&quot; provides an excellent overview on what an Estate (or State) of the Empire is. For his purpose, the author deals only with the hereditary territorial rulers but it should be remembered that the Estates also included a substantial number of non-hereditary territorial rulers such as the ecclesiastical states (prince-bishoprics and imperial abbeys) and free imperial cities.


==Grouped lists==

<text>Enoch Poor (June 21, 1736 (Old Style) – September 8, 1780) was a brigadier general in the Continental Army during the American Revolutionary War. He was a ship builder and merchant from Exeter, New Hampshire.

==Biography==

Poor was born and raised in Andover, Province of Massachusetts Bay. His father Thomas Poor had been part of the 1745 expedition that captured Louisburg, Nova Scotia, during King George&#x27;s War. In 1755, Poor enlisted as a private in one of the Massachusetts units raised to accompany Jeffery Amherst&#x27;s expedition to retake Louisburg during the French and Indian War. His unit enforced the expulsion of the Acadians. After the war, he came home to Andover, but only briefly. He eloped with Martha Osgood, and they settled in Exeter where he became a successful ship builder.

Poor supported the separatists as early as the Stamp Act protests in 1765. He served on various committees for Exeter throughout the period of rising rebellion. In 1775, he was twice elected to the provincial Assembly. The Battle of Lexington caused the assembly to call for three regiments of militia, and Poor became the colonel of the 2nd New Hampshire Regiment. The other regiments under colonels John Stark and James Reed were sent to Boston, but the 2nd was stationed at Portsmouth and Exeter. They were sent to Boston after the Battle of Bunker Hill, arriving on June 25. In the summer of 1775, the unit was absorbed into the Continental Army; they were ordered into the Northern Department and went with General Richard Montgomery&#x27;s invasion of Canada.

After the disaster in Canada, Poor led the survivors of his regiment in early 1776 back to Fort Ticonderoga. The unit was renamed as the 8th Continental regiment and joined Washington&#x27;s main army in December 1776 at winter quarters near Morristown, New Jersey.

The Continental Congress named Poor a brigadier general on February 21, 1777. That spring, his brigade was sent back to Ticonderoga. He withdrew with the rest of Arthur St. Clair&#x27;s force of July 5. Moving south, they joined General Horatio Gates before the Battle of Saratoga, and his brigade was expanded by two regiments of Connecticut militia (Cook&#x27;s and Latimer&#x27;s).

In the Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm, Poor&#x27;s brigade was the first to come to the aid of Daniel Morgan&#x27;s attack. Poor held the American left flank, extending into the woods and even wrapping around the British position. They performed well, keeping General Simon Fraser&#x27;s regulars engaged while Benedict Arnold led attacks on the central column.

In the Battle of Bemis Heights, Poor&#x27;s brigade was in General Benjamin Lincoln&#x27;s division on the western end of the American line. They were closest to the center of the advancing British, so they came under fire from the grenadier battalion of the British center. The fire was ineffective, so Major John Dyke Acland led the grenadiers in a bayonet charge. Poor held fire until they came very close, then opened up with the massed fire of his 1,400 men. These were the first American shots in the battle. The charge was completely broken, and Acland himself fell wounded. With this collapse of Burgoyne&#x27;s center, the Americans captured the wounded Acland and Major Williams along with the column&#x27;s artillery. Poor then turned to his left and gave support to Ebenezer Learned and Morgan&#x27;s men.

Poor&#x27;s brigade again spent the winter with the main army, this time at Valley Forge. He led the last maneuvers in the Battle of Monmouth on June 28, 1778. He accompanied the Sullivan Expedition in 1779, leading a brigade in the victory at Battle of Newtown.

Afterward Poor was assigned to Lafayette&#x27;s division and mainly saw garrison duty in New Jersey. Some sources say that Poor was shot in a duel near Hackensack, New Jersey, on September 6, 1780, and died two days later from the wound, (according to the journal of soldier Elijah Fisher, Poor was in a duel with &quot;a Major&quot; and died two days later.) although the Army surgeon reported that he died from typhus. He was buried in the First Reformed Dutch Church Cemetery in Hackensack. George Washington and Lafayette both attended his funeral, and Washington wrote to inform Congress of Poor&#x27;s death. He noted that &quot;he was an officer of distinguished merit, one who as a citizen and soldier had every claim to the esteem and regard of his country.&quot;

<doc id="256849" wikidata="Q406742" url="?curid=256849" title="Gene Tunney">
<text>James Joseph Tunney (May 25, 1897 – November 7, 1978) was an American professional boxer who competed from 1915 to 1928. He held the world heavyweight title from 1926 to 1928, and the American light heavyweight title twice between 1922 and 1923. A highly technical boxer, Tunney had a five-fight light heavyweight rivalry with Harry Greb in which he won three, lost once, and drew once, though many ringside reporters believed Greb should have won the decision in their second meeting. Tunney also knocked out Georges Carpentier and defeated Jack Dempsey twice; first in 1926 and again in 1927. Tunney&#x27;s successful title defense against Dempsey remains one of the most famous bouts in boxing history and is known as The Long Count Fight. He retired undefeated as a heavyweight after his victory over Tom Heeney in 1928, after which Tunney was named Fighter of the Year by &quot;The Ring&quot; magazine.

==Early life==
James Joseph Tunney was born on May 25, 1897, in New York City to Irish immigrant parents from Kiltimagh, County Mayo. His mother, Mary Lydon from Culleen House, Gorthgarve, Kiltimagh immigrated to the United States after the Great Famine and settled in New York City, where she met John Tunney, from Cill Aodain, Kiltimagh. They married after a short courtship. The Tunneys had seven children. At an early age, Gene Tunney was inspired by President Theodore Roosevelt to become physically fit.

==Career==

Tunney fought some 68 official professional fights, losing only one, to Harry Greb, while fighting as a light heavyweight. Tunney fought many other fights whose scoring was unofficial, judged by newspaper reporters. He also lost none of these &quot;newspaper decisions&quot;. He reported that he lost a second fight during World War I, a 10-round decision, to Tommy Loughran, as a Marine before he began his professional boxing career. Tunney was regarded as an extremely skillful boxer who excelled in defense. In addition to beating Dempsey, the most famous fighter of his era, Tunney defeated Tommy Gibbons, Georges Carpentier and many other fine boxers.

Already the U.S. Expeditionary Forces champion, Tunney spent the winter of 1921 as a lumberjack in northern Ontario for the J. R. Booth Company of Ottawa, without revealing he was a champion boxer. He explained this as &quot;wanting the solitude and the strenuous labors of the woods to help condition himself for the career that appeared before him.&quot;

Tunney also had a brief acting career, starring in the movie &quot;The Fighting Marine&quot; in 1926. Unfortunately, no prints of this film are known to exist.

He was elected as Ring Magazine&#x27;s first-ever Fighter of the Year in 1928 and later elected to the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1980, the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1990 and the United States Marine Corps Sports Hall of Fame in 2001.

===Fighting style===
Tunney was a thinking fighter who preferred to make a boxing match into a game of chess, which was not popular during the times when such sluggers as Jack Dempsey, Harry Greb and Mickey Walker were commanding center stage. Tunney&#x27;s style was influenced by other noted boxing thinkers such as James J. Corbett and Benny Leonard. Nevertheless, it is incorrect to think of Tunney as a stick-and-move fighter in the Ali style. While Tunney&#x27;s heavyweight fights against Gibbons, Carpentier, and Dempsey featured his fleet-footed movement and rapid-fire jabbing, his earlier bouts, especially the five against Harry Greb, demonstrated his vicious body punching and willingness to fight toe-to-toe. It was Benny Leonard who advised Tunney that the only way to beat Harry &quot;The Human Windmill&quot; Greb was to aim his punches at Greb&#x27;s body rather than his head.

Always moving and boxing behind an excellent left jab, Tunney would study his opponents from the first bell. He generally preferred to stay outside and nullify any attacks, while using quick counters to keep the opponent off balance. In his fights against Jack Dempsey, today&#x27;s viewer can see Tunney&#x27;s style: hands held low for greater power, fast footwork that adjusts to every move his opponent makes and quick and accurate one-two style counter-punches with the left and right.

Tunney was never knocked out, while only ever being knocked down once, that in his second fight with Dempsey in the infamous Long Count. This makes him one of only five Heavyweight champions, alongside Rocky Marciano, Riddick Bowe, Sultan Ibragimov and Nicolai Valuev to retire without ever suffering a stoppage defeat. Tunney, along with Marciano, Lewis and Vitali Klitschko is one of four heavyweight champions to have retired as champion and to have ended their career with a win in a world title fight. Having avenged his only loss to Harry Greb, Tunney joins Ingemar Johansson, Rocky Marciano, Lennox Lewis and Riddick Bowe as the only five heavyweight champions to have retired while holding a victory over every opponent he faced as a professional (barring no-contests and draws).

===Military service===

Tunney enlisted the Marine Corps during World War I and served as private with 11th Marine Regiment in France and later in Germany during the occupation of the Rhineland in 1919. He saw no combat and spent most of the war in the Marine boxing team, becoming U.S. Expeditionary Forces champion. Tunney was demobilized following the war, but remained in the Marine Corps Reserve, ultimately reaching the rank of major in the Connecticut Naval Militia.

Following the United States entry into World War II, at the request of Navy Undersecretary James Forrestal, Tunney accepted a commission in the United States Naval Reserve as a lieutenant commander to set up a physical fitness program for student pilots. He headed the Navy&#x27;s physical fitness programme for the duration of the war and also made an inspection trip to Hawaii and the surrounding area.

Tunney was consecutively promoted to the ranks of commander and captain and retired shortly following the War. For his wartime service, he was decorated with the Navy Commendation Medal and was awarded the American Defense Service Medal, American Campaign Medal, Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal, World War II Victory Medal. He also held the World War I Victory Medal with France Clasp, Army of Occupation of Germany Medal, and Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal for his World War I enlisted service.

====Tunney Cup====

In 1932, Tunney published a book called &quot;A Man Must Fight&quot;, in which he gave comments on his career and boxing techniques.
In 1928, the U.S. Marine Corps presented – as a sign of friendship – a challenge cup to the Corps of Royal Marines, in the hope it might be competed for by Royal Marines association football teams. The Royal Marines named the trophy the &quot;Tunney Cup,&quot; in honor of then-USMC Captain Tunney, who, with Sergeant Major Charles R. Francis, presented the trophy on behalf of the U.S. Marine Corps.

==Personal life==
In 1928, Tunney married a wealthy socialite Mary &quot;Polly&quot; Lauder (April 24, 1907 – April 19, 2008). After Tunney&#x27;s retirement, the couple lived in Stamford, Connecticut and raised four children. They had three sons and one daughter: 
* John Varick Tunney (1934–2018), who was a U.S. Representative and U.S. Senator from California from 1965 until 1977; 
* Jonathan &quot;Jay&quot; Rowland Tunney of Stamford, Connecticut;
* Gene Lauder Tunney (1931–2009), who became a lawyer and served as district attorney for Sonoma County, California, for 20 years; and
* Joan Tunney Wilkinson (1939–2008) of San Francisco, who was committed to McLean Hospital on June 6, 1970, after she murdered her husband, Lynn Carter Wilkinson Jr.

Previous to his marrying Polly Lauder, Tunney was sued in 1927 for breach of promise by Katherine King Fogarty.

==Death and legacy==
Tunney died on November 7, 1978, at the Greenwich Hospital in Connecticut at the age of eighty-one, after suffering from a circulation ailment. He was interred at Long Ridge Union Cemetery in Stamford, Connecticut.

===In popular culture===
Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis had a comedy routine in which Lewis (in boxing shorts and gear) states he will be fighting Gene Tierney (the actress). Martin corrects Lewis and suggests that he must mean &quot;Gene Tunney&quot;. Lewis then quips &quot;You fight who you wanna fight, I&#x27;m fight&#x27;n who I wanna fight, I&#x27;m fight&#x27;n Gene Tierney.&quot;

In the song &quot;She Twists the Knife Again&quot; from Richard Thompson&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Across a Crowded Room&quot;, describing the mismatched intensity in a strife-ladened relationship, Thompson writes: &quot;I&#x27;m in a fist fight/She thinks she&#x27;s Gene Tunney!&quot;

He is also mentioned in Act 1 of Arthur Miller&#x27;s &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;: Willy tells his sons he has a punching bag with Tunney&#x27;s signature on it.

Mentioned in &quot;A Whistle in the Dark&quot; (Act 1, p. 31) by Tom Murphy: &quot;in the words of the great Gene Tunney, a man must fight back. His father was a Mayoman too&quot;.

Mentioned in the short story &quot;Fallon&quot; by J. D. Luther, when imprisoned character Tyson Wayne Vance recalls his abusive father, &quot;Was more than one night momma&#x27;d look like she went fifteen rounds with Gene Tunney...&quot;.

In the 1932 boxing film &quot;Winner Take All&quot;, James Cagney&#x27;s character Jimmy Kane—a has-been former champion trying to get educated—laments that William Shakespeare was &quot;the one who ruined Gene Tunney.&quot;

The novelette &quot;A KO for Christmas&quot; by Shawn Pollock features a character, Stitch Stanford, who hopes to fight Gene Tunney for the heavyweight title.

<doc id="256854" wikidata="Q393477" url="?curid=256854" title="Trench fever">
<text>Trench fever (also known as &quot;five-day fever&quot;, &quot;quintan fever&quot; (), and &quot;urban trench fever&quot;) is a moderately serious infectious disease caused by the bacterium &quot;Bartonella quintana&quot; and transmitted by body lice. From 1915 to 1918 between one-fifth and one-third of all British troops reported ill had trench fever while about one-fifth of ill German and Austrian troops had the disease. The disease persists among the homeless. Outbreaks have been documented, for example, in Seattle and Baltimore in the United States among injecting drug users and in Marseille, France, and Burundi.

Trench fever is also called Wolhynia fever, shin bone fever, Meuse fever, His disease, and His–Werner disease or Werner-His disease (after Wilhelm His Jr. and Heinrich Werner).

==Signs and symptoms==
The disease is classically a five-day fever of the relapsing type, rarely exhibiting a continuous course. The incubation period is relatively long, at about two weeks. The onset of symptoms is usually sudden, with high fever, severe headache, pain on moving the eyeballs, soreness of the muscles of the legs and back, and frequent hyperaesthesia of the shins. The initial fever is usually followed in a few days by a single, short rise but there may be many relapses between periods without fever. The most constant symptom is pain in the legs. Trench fever episodes may involve loss of appetite, shin pain or tenderness, and spleen enlargement. Generally, one to five periodic episodes of fever occur, separated by four-to-six-day-long asymptomatic periods. Recovery takes a month or more. Lethal cases are rare, but in a few cases &quot;the persistent fever might lead to heart failure&quot;. Aftereffects may include neurasthenia, cardiac disturbances, and myalgia.

==Cause, transmission, pathophysiology==
The disease is caused by the bacterium &quot;Bartonella quintana&quot; (older names: &quot;Rochalimea quintana&quot;, &quot;Rickettsia quintana&quot;), found in the stomach walls of the body louse. &quot;Bartonella quintana&quot; is closely related to &quot;Bartonella henselae&quot;, the agent of cat scratch fever and bacillary angiomatosis.

&quot;Bartonella quintana&quot; is transmitted by contamination of a skin abrasion or louse-bite wound with the faeces of an infected body louse (&quot;Pediculus humanus corporis&quot;). There have also been reports of an infected louse bite passing on the infection.
&quot;B. quintana&quot; infection has also been noted in transplant recipients from infected donors.

==Diagnosis==
Serological testing is typically used to obtain a definitive diagnosis. Most serological tests would succeed only after a certain period of time past the symptom onset, usually a week. 

The differential diagnosis includes typhus, ehrlichiosis, leptospirosis, Lyme disease, and virus-caused exanthema (measles or rubella).

==Treatment==
The treatment of trench fever can vary from case to case, as the human body has the ability to rid itself of the disease without medical intervention. Some patients will require treatment, and others will not. For those who do require treatment, the best treatment comes by way of doxycycline in combination with gentamicin. Chloramphenicol is an alternative medication recommended under circumstances that render the use of tetracycline derivates undesirable, such as severe liver disease, kidney dysfunction, in children under nine years and in pregnant women. The medication is administered for seven to ten days.

Treatment usually consists of a 4- to 6-week course of doxycycline as first-line, or erythromycin, or azithromycin.

==Epidemiology==
Trench fever is a vector-borne disease in which humans are primarily the main hosts. The vector through which the disease is typically transmitted is referred to as the human body louse &quot;Pediculus humanus humanus&quot;. The British Expeditionary Force Pyrexia of Unknown Origin Enquiry Sub-Committee concluded that the specific means by which the vector infected the host was louse waste entering the body through abraded skin. Although the disease is typically found in humans, the gram-negative bacterium which induces the disease has been seen in mammals such as dogs, cats, and macaques in small numbers.

Since the vector of the disease is a human body louse, the main risk factors for infection are mostly in relation to contracting body louse. Specifically, some risk factors include body louse infestation, overcrowded and unhygienic conditions, body hygiene, war, famine, malnutrition, alcoholism, homelessness, and intravenous drug abuse.

The identified risk factors directly correlate with the subpopulations of identified infected persons throughout the duration of the known disease. Historically, trench fever was found in young male soldiers of World War I, whereas in the 21st century the disease mostly has a prevalence in middle-aged homeless men. 
In a 2021 outbreak investigation in Denver, Colorado, 15% of the 241 tested homeless persons were positive. A 2012 study in Marseille, France had found the bacterium in 5.4% of the 930 homeless individuals they tested.

==History==
Trench fever affected armies in Flanders, France, Poland, Galicia, Italy, Macedonia, Mesopotamia, Russia and Egypt in World War I. Three noted cases during WWI were the authors J. R. R. Tolkien, A. A. Milne, and C. S. Lewis.
===Discovery and taxonomy===
Trench fever was first described and reported by British major John Graham in June 1915. He reported symptoms such as dizziness, headaches, and pain in the shins and back. The disease was most common in the military and consequently took much longer to identify than usual. These cases were originally confused for dengue, sandfly, or paratyphoid fever. Because insects were the suspected vector of transmission, Alexander Peacock published a study of the body louse in 1916. Due in part to his findings, the louse was determined to be the primary cause of transmission by many, but this was still contested by multiple voices in the field such as John Muir who believed the disease was of a viral nature. In 1917, the Trench Fever Investigation Commission (TFIC) had its first meeting. The TFIC performed experiments with infected blood and louse and learned much about the disease and louse behavior. Also in 1917, the American Red Cross started the Medical Research Committee (MRC). The MRC performed human experiments on trench fever, and their research was published in March 1918. The MRC and TFIC findings were very similar essentially confirming the louse as the vector of transmission, the TFIC correctly implicating louse fecal contamination as the mode of transmission rather than directly through louse bite. 

The TFIC speculated that the disease was &quot;likely&quot; related to a rickettsial infection based on studies of infected lice, and the bacterium had been named by Schmincke one year prior in 1917. 

It was not until the 1960s that J. Vinson demonstrated that &quot;Rickettsia quintana&quot; could be cultured extracellularly on blood agar and fulfilled Koch&#x27;s postulates. This led to the reclassification of &quot;Rickettsia quintana&quot; as &quot;Rochalimaea quintana&quot; and subsequently &quot;Bartonella quintana&quot;.

During World War II, the British Government commissioned sheep dip manufacturer, Cooper, McDougall &amp; Robertson of Berkhamsted, Herts to develop a product which troops could use to ward off lice. After much trial and error, &#x27;AL63&#x27;, was developed and successfully used in a powder form. The initials stood for &#x27;Anti-Louse&#x27; and it was the 63rd preparation which was the most efficacious.

<text>Thomas Heeney (18 May 1898 – 15 June 1984) was a professional heavyweight boxer from New Zealand, best known for unsuccessfully challenging champion Gene Tunney for the heavyweight championship of the world in New York City on 26 July 1928.

==Biography==

Heeney was born in Gisborne, New Zealand, and worked as a plumber until he left New Zealand. He was a strong swimmer and was awarded a bronze medal by the Royal Humane Society of New Zealand in 1918 for helping rescue two women from the sea off Waikanae Beach, Gisborne. He also retrieved a third woman who did not survive.

He learnt to box from his father and his older brother Jack Heeney, who was the New Zealand amateur welterweight champion in 1914 and middleweight champion from 1919 to 1924. He became a professional boxer when he fought Bill Bartlett in Gisborne in 1920. In October 1920, Heeney became the New Zealand heavyweight champion when he beat Brian McCleary of Dunedin on a technical knockout. Heeney was also a rugby union player and played for the Hawke&#x27;s Bay — Poverty Bay team against the Springboks in 1921. He boxed in Australia and won the Australian heavyweight champion title in 1922, and fought in England and South Africa in 1924.

Heeney went to the United States in 1926. He beat Jim Maloney, Johnny Risko and Jim Delaney and eventually ranked fourth among the world&#x27;s heavyweight boxers. After fighting Jack Sharkey, later a heavyweight world champion, in 1928 for the right to fight Tunney, on 26 July 1928, Heeney fought Gene Tunney at Yankee Stadium, New York City, for the world heavyweight championship title. Heeney entered the boxing ring wearing a Māori cloak that was given to him by Heni Materoa, the widow of Sir James Carroll. The referee, Ed Forbes, stopped the scheduled 15 round fight in the 11th round, and Tunney won. It was said of Heeney:
:&quot;His gritty performance in this fight would have been considered by many observers to have justified his sobriquet of The Hard Rock from Down Under given by renowned writer and journalist, Damon Runyon.&quot;

A week after his defeat, Tom married Marion Dunn, an American. Heeney became an American citizen and boxed until 1934, accomplishing a fighting record of 70 professional bouts, 38 wins, 22 losses, 8 draws, and 2 no-contest.

After retiring from boxing, he owned a bar in Miami, Florida. He served with the United States Navy Civil Engineer Corps in World War II, and afterward coached boxing and refereed armed forces bouts in the South Pacific. He often fished with his friend, the famous writer Ernest Hemingway. Heeney&#x27;s wife, Marion, died in 1980. They had no children.

Heeney was inducted into the New Zealand Sports Hall of Fame in 1996.

<doc id="256859" wikidata="Q282138" url="?curid=256859" title="Tommy Loughran">
<text>Thomas Patrick Loughran (November 29, 1902 – July 7, 1982) was an American professional boxer and the former World Light Heavyweight Champion. Statistical boxing website BoxRec lists Loughran as the #7 ranked light heavyweight of all time, while &quot;The Ring Magazine&quot; founder Nat Fleischer placed him at #4. The International Boxing Research Organization rates Loughran as the 6th best light heavyweight ever. Loughran was named the &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;&#x27;s Fighter of the Year twice, first in 1929 and again 1931. He was inducted into the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame in 1956 and the International Boxing Hall of Fame in 1991.

==Boxing career==

Loughran was one of seven children of an Irish immigrant motorman. His effective use of coordinated foot work, sound defense and swift, accurate counter punching is now regarded as a precursor to the techniques practiced in modern boxing.

Loughran fought many middleweight, light heavyweight, and heavyweight champions in his career, including Gene Tunney, Jack Sharkey, and Georges Carpentier. Loughran even achieved a newspaper decision over fistic phenom Harry Greb, whom he first met at age 19. As a light heavyweight, he defeated two future world heavyweight champions: Max Baer and James J. Braddock. Loughran finally fought Primo Carnera for the heavyweight title but lost a decision.

In an interview late in life, Loughran said his loss to Carnera was a pre-arranged &quot;fait accompli&quot;: &quot;I had to knock him out to win, I had to agree to that&quot;. Footage of the fight is limited and scarce, but Loughran contended he had Carnera in trouble in Rounds 4 and 10, &quot;but then, when I couldn&#x27;t finish him, I knew the thing was over&quot;. The decision a foregone conclusion, Tommy Loughran told Peter Heller in April, 1972, &quot;I beat (Carnera), no question about it&quot;.

==Later life==

On August 22, 1957, he refereed Floyd Patterson&#x27;s defense of his heavyweight title vs. 1956 Olympic gold medalist Pete Rademacher, at Sick&#x27;s Stadium, Seattle. The fight was notable in that Rademacher was the first and only fighter to challenge for the heavyweight crown in his professional debut. There were several knockdowns in the fight; Tommy counted out the challenger at 2:57 of the 6th round.

In the 1960s Loughran retired from having been a long-time, successful broker on Wall Street, where he had dealt in commodities (sugar). He became a keynote speaker, appearing at dinners and banquets, his message an attempt to promote and strengthen the image of boxers and boxing at what for the sport was a troubled time. In addition, Tommy lent color commentary to at least one championship bout, Carlos Ortiz vs. Johnny Bizarro in Pittsburgh, June 20, 1966.

In 2006, the Pennsylvania Historical &amp; Museum Commission raised a historical marker in front of St. Monica&#x27;s Roman Catholic Church, in his old neighborhood, and reads in part: He boxed during the &quot;Golden Age of Boxing&quot; in many weight classes, beating 10 champs in his 18-year career. The &quot;Philly Phantom&quot; had a scientific style, built on precision and maneuverability rather than brute force. Considered a gentleman both in and out of the ring. Loughran was devoted to his neighborhood and church here.

<doc id="256862" wikidata="Q763508" url="?curid=256862" title="The Ocean Race">
<text>The Ocean Race is a yacht race around the world, held every three or four years since 1973. Originally named the Whitbread Round the World Race after its initiating sponsor, British brewing company Whitbread, in 2001 it became the Volvo Ocean Race after Swedish automobile manufacturer Volvo took up the sponsorship, and in 2019 it was renamed The Ocean Race.

Each of the entries has a sailing crew who race day and night for more than 20 days at a time on some of the legs. Since the 2008–2009 race there has also been a dedicated media crew member called the On Board Reporter (OBR), who does not contribute to the sailing of the boat, but is responsible for sending images and video to race headquarters via satellite from the middle of the ocean. In the 2017–2018 race, the number of crew ranged between 7 and 10 (plus the OBR) depending on the gender ratio, with the rules providing an incentive to having women sailors on board.

To minimize weight, crews overwhelmingly rely on freeze-dried fare for sustenance. Crews are also subjected to temperature variations from −5 to +40 degrees Celsius and will often only take one change of clothes.

==History==
In 1972 England&#x27;s Whitbread company and the British Royal Naval Sailing Association agreed to sponsor a globe-circling regatta, which would be called the &#x27;Whitbread Round the World Yacht Race&#x27;.

17 yachts and 167 crew started the first race of , which began from Portsmouth, United Kingdom on 8 September 1973. Approximately 3000 spectator boats set out to witness the historic start. The first race was won by Mexican amateur Ramon Carlin in a Swan 65 yacht, &quot;Sayula II&quot;. Sayula II was followed by Adventure, Grand Louis and Kriter.

The original course was designed to follow the route of the square riggers, which had carried cargo around the world during the 19th Century.

From 2001 the ownership of the race was taken over by Volvo and Volvo Cars and the race was renamed the ‘Volvo Ocean Race’. Stopover ports were added in Germany, France, and Sweden being Volvo&#x27;s three biggest car markets in Europe.

Winning the race does not attract a cash prize, as the feat of competing is presented as sufficient reward.

Many of the crew in the Volvo Ocean Race race crew other professional teams in other high-profile events, such as the Olympic Games, Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, the America&#x27;s Cup, or the Fastnet Race.

The worst weather conditions are usually encountered in the Southern Ocean where waves sometimes top and winds can reach .

The 2017–18 race covered 45,000 nautical miles, which is the longest route in its history.

==The yachts==
Early races had a very wide range of boat types, but concerns after the 1989–1990 race led to the development of the Whitbread 60 single design. This was a reaction to increasing costs of the biggest, &quot;maxi&quot;, boats, and their advantage over the rest of the field – Steinlager 2 won every leg in the maxi division and was the winner overall, with many of the smaller boats finishing legs more than ten days after the winner.

The Whitbread 60 design was used for all smaller boats in the 1993–1994 race, and for all in the 1997–1998 race. The race continued to be restricted to a single class for the next seven races – but moved to the Volvo Open 70, then the Volvo Ocean 65.

Two classes of boats were used for the 2023 edition of the race: the Volvo Ocean 65 and the IMOCA 60.

==The route==
Though the route changes to accommodate various ports of call, the race typically departs Europe in October, and in recent editions has had either 9 or 10 legs, with in-port races at many of the stopover cities. The 2008–09 race started in Alicante, Spain, on October 11, 2008. The route for the 2008–2009 race was altered from previous years to include stopovers in India and Asia for the first time. The 2008–09 route covered nearly , took over nine months to complete, and reached a cumulative TV audience of 2 billion people worldwide.

During the nine months of the 2011–12 Volvo Ocean Race, which started in Alicante, Spain in October 2011 and concluded in Galway, Ireland, in July 2012, the teams were scheduled to sail over of the world&#x27;s most treacherous seas via Cape Town, Abu Dhabi, Sanya, Auckland, around Cape Horn to Itajaí, Miami, Lisbon, and Lorient.

As in the previous editions the 2014–15 Volvo Ocean Race started in Alicante, Spain on October 11. Destination was Gothenburg, Sweden, scheduled for June 2015, with stopovers in the ports of Cape Town, Abu Dhabi, Sanya, Auckland, Itajaí, Newport, Lisbon, Lorient, and with a Pitstop at The Hague through the last leg.

==List of races==

<text>The [[Remington Rand]] 409, a punched card calculator which was programmed with a plugboard, was designed in 1949. It was sold in two models: the UNIVAC 60 (1952) and the UNIVAC 120 (1953). The model number referred to the number of decimal digits it could read from each punched card.

The machine was designed in &quot;The Barn&quot;, at 33 Highland Ave. in Rowayton, Connecticut, a building that currently houses the Rowayton Public Library and Community Center.

These machines were discontinued when the UNIVAC 1004 was introduced in 1962. About 1000 total had been produced by 1961.

==Architecture==
Numbers were fixed-point and of variable length (one to ten digits). Arithmetic was done in floating point, but all results were converted to fixed point when stored in memory.

Digits are represented in bi-quinary coded decimal. Each digit of memory storage contained five tubes. Four of these represented the digits 1, 3, 5, and 7, while the fifth tube represented 9 if activated alone but added 1 to the value if activated together with another tube.

<text>Chiquitania (&quot;Chiquitos&quot; or &quot;Gran Chiquitania&quot;) is a region of tropical savannas in the Santa Cruz Department in eastern Bolivia.

==Geography==
&quot;Chiquitos&quot; is the colonial name for what is now essentially five of the six provinces that make up the Chiquitania, a region in Bolivia&#x27;s Santa Cruz department. &quot;Chiquitos&quot; refers to a region, not a tribe.

Today, the Chiquitania lies within five provinces of Santa Cruz Department: Ángel Sandoval, Germán Busch, José Miguel de Velasco, Ñuflo de Chávez and Chiquitos province.

==Peoples==
One of the many tribes inhabiting Chiquitos were the Chiquitano, who still speak the Chiquitano language today.

==Languages==
Languages historically spoken in the Chiquitania included:

*Chiquitano
*Gorgotoqui (extinct)
*Otuke (extinct)
*Ayoreo
*Guarani

Today, Camba Spanish is the main vernacular lingua franca.

==Missions==

A notable feature are the 18th-century Jesuit reductions and Franciscan settlements scattered throughout the region. Six churches still remain in the zone and were selected in 1990 as UNESCO World Heritage Sites under the name &quot;Jesuit Missions of the Chiquitos&quot;.

==Ecosystem==

The Chiquitano dry forest is the ecosystem which connects South America&#x27;s two largest biomes, the Amazon and the Gran Chaco, a dense dry forest of thorn-covered trees and scrub that extends south into Paraguay and Brazil.

<doc id="256880" wikidata="Q712859" url="?curid=256880" title="Harry Greb">
<text>Harry Greb (June 6, 1894 – October 22, 1926) was a professional boxer. Nicknamed &quot;The Pittsburgh Windmill&quot;, &quot;The Smoke City Wildcat&quot;, and &quot;The Pittsburgh Bearcat&quot;, Greb ranked the fifth best pound-for-pound boxers of all time by Sports Illustrated.

He was the American light heavyweight champion from 1922 to 1923 and the world middleweight champion from 1923 to 1926. He fought 298 times in his 13-year career, which began at around 140 pounds. Despite starting as a welterweight, he was frequently squaring off against and beating light heavyweights and even heavyweights.

== Fighting style ==

Greb had a highly aggressive, fast and swarming style of fighting. He also used dirty fighting tactics, including spinning his opponent and using the heel and laces of his gloves. Greb suffered several injuries in his career, including blindness in one eye. Greb suffered only 2 TKO losses in his career. The first was in his seventh fight when he was knocked out by Joe Chip, who heavily outweighed him; the second happened two years later when Greb broke the radius of his left arm against Kid Graves. Greb finished the round but was unable to continue the fight.

==Professional career==
Harry Greb was born as Edward Henry Greb to a German immigrant father and mother of German descent, Pius and Annie Greb, who raised him in a working-class household. Greb began his professional boxing career in 1913, fighting mostly around his hometown of Pittsburgh. By 1915, he was fighting world-class opposition, notably Hall of Famer Tommy Gibbons and reigning middleweight champion George Chip, whom he faced twice during 1915–1916 in non-title fights. Greb would lose both fights by &quot;newspaper&quot; decision, which he would later avenge.

Greb would fight 37 times in 1917 (a record), winning 34 of those fights either officially or unofficially. Among his defeated opponents that year were the reigning light heavyweight champion Battling Levinsky (in a non-title fight), former light heavyweight champion Jack Dillon, middleweight George Chip and heavyweight Willie Meehan, who had beaten future heavyweight champion Jack Dempsey earlier in the year.

Despite all these results, Greb was still denied a chance to fight for a title. A February 1918 newspaper draw against Mike O&#x27;Dowd, who would go on to win the middleweight title during the year, and a newspaper loss to Billy Miske did not help in his effort. Greb would win his next 52 fights in a row. During that stretch, he beat future light heavyweight champion Mike McTigue, heavyweight contenders Billy Miske, Mike Gibbons, Bill Brennan, Jeff Smith, and Leo Houck 3 times each, and Battling Levinsky no less than four times during that stretch (6 times altogether) in newspaper decisions. Levinsky was the reigning light heavyweight champion at the time.

===Vision problems===
In 1921, during a fight with light heavyweight Kid Norfolk, he was thumbed in the right eye, which is believed to have resulted in a retinal tear. The injury would eventually lead to permanent blindness. Greb won via a ten-round newspaper decision and was eligible to fight for the middleweight title. It is commonly believed that Greb completely lost sight in the eye after his fifth bout with Bob Roper, after which it took almost two months to recover. He was seen in a hospital with patches over both eyes. He kept the injury a secret from all but his wife and closest friends, fooling physicians during pre-fight physicals by memorizing the order of the letters on the eye chart (Greb would later lose some vision in his left eye and his gradual loss of sight led him to always go to bed with the light on).

===Greb vs. Tunney===
On May 23, 1922, Harry Greb was matched with Gene Tunney, the undefeated American light heavyweight champion. In the first round, Greb immediately fractured Tunney&#x27;s nose in two places and then proceeded to open a deep gash over his left eye. According to eye-witness reports, Greb was subsequently forced to intermittently commission the referee to wipe off his bloodstained gloves with a towel. Throughout the bout, Greb would repeatedly petition the referee to stop the fight while a determined Tunney concurrently implored him to allow the contest to continue. Round after round, the beating continued, with Tunney refusing to submit and smiling during the bloodshed to keep the referee from halting the match. At the end of fifteen rounds Greb was crowned champion unanimously. This was the first and only professional loss in Tunney&#x27;s career, with the bout being hailed as the Fight of the Year for 1922 by the &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;.

After defending his title against Tommy Loughran, Greb granted Tunney a rematch. In a hotly disputed battle at Madison Square Garden in February 1923, Tunney regained his title by a highly controversial split decision. Multiple eyewitness reports state that Greb controlled the fight and battered Tunney, cutting and rocking him from punches on more than one occasion. But Tunney could fight back, unlike in the first encounter, and at some points, was competitive with Greb. The crowd booed heavily when Tunney was announced as the winner.

Greb and Tunney would meet three more times, with Tunney successfully defending his regained title in another fifteen-round about and then fighting to a no-decision newspaper draw, wherein most newspapers reported Greb the winner. Referee Matt Hinkel stated he would have ruled a draw, so the record books have it that way. The fifth battle was reminiscent of the first fight in their series, except this time, it was Tunney bludgeoning Greb for the duration of the bout. According to Tunney, near the end of the match, while the two fighters were locked in a clinch, Greb straightforwardly asked Tunney not to knock him out. Tunney reputedly consented to this request and later acknowledged the incident as the highest tribute he received in his career, stating, &quot;Here was one of the greatest fighters of all time laying down his shield, admitting defeat and knowing I would not expose him.&quot; Tunney would go on to beat Jack Dempsey for the heavyweight title. Greb remained the only man ever to have beaten Tunney, and Tunney would be among the pall-bearers at Greb&#x27;s funeral.

===Middleweight champion===
One month after losing his light heavyweight title to Tunney, Greb set his sights on middleweight champion Johnny Wilson; however, when Wilson&#x27;s manager Marty Killelea refused to offer him the bout, Greb paid a few speakeasy servers in Pittsburgh and New York to serve him water in coloured tumblers and then feigned intoxication in a highly theatrical spectacle. When Killelea witnessed one of these performances, he assumed Greb was ripe for the taking and arranged for the about to take place. On August 31, 1923, Greb faced Wilson for the world middleweight title, winning a 15-round decision. When referee Jack O&#x27;Sullivan stepped in to separate the fighters during a rough clinch, he asked Greb what he thought he was doing. Greb responded, &quot;Gouging Johnny in the eye, can&#x27;t you see?&quot; Greb would grant Wilson a rematch on January 18, 1924, in Madison Square Garden, winning another 15-round decision.

===Greb vs. Walker===
Greb&#x27;s most notable defense of the title was against the reigning world welterweight champion, Mickey Walker, in July 1925 at the Polo Grounds in New York. Most pundits and even Walker believed Greb would have trouble making the 160lb weight limit. Still, when it was reported that Greb weighed in at 157 1/2 lbs, he was inserted as the 9–5 odds favorite. During the first few rounds of the battle, Walker came out attacking Greb to the body as the defending champion tried to stave off cramps in both his legs. The middle rounds saw Greb starting to relax and control the pace of the bout while Walker could still land some eye-catching combinations. Greb took control during the championship round, and Greb was awarded a unanimous decision by the judges and retained the championship. Walker, who would win the middleweight title the following year, relayed years later a tale that he stumbled upon Greb at a nightclub after their fight, and, according to the legend, the two fought an impromptu rematch there. According to some reports, Greb easily won the spontaneous rematch, while the general consensus is that Walker landed a sucker punch on Greb that knocked him out cold. According to Walker himself, the two were sitting down discussing their fight over a drink when Walker commented that he felt that had it not been for Greb thumbing him in the eye, he would have won the fight. The heavily intoxicated Greb took great offense to this and jumped to his feet to fight. The two fought and ended up outside where several friends of each separated the men.

===Later career===
At 32, a waning Greb was years past his best when he was matched with tricky southpaw Tiger Flowers (who was 31 at the time) in Madison Square Garden in February 1926. Flowers, a defensive specialist, countered Greb&#x27;s attacks well and won a disputed decision after fifteen rounds to annex Greb&#x27;s middleweight title. Flowers beat Greb again in their rematch six months later, on an even more controversial decision, the fans storming the ring to protest the outcome. Greb later stated, &quot;Well, that was one fight I won if I ever won any,&quot; the fight would be the last of his career.

==Personal life==
Harry Greb married Mildred Catherine Reilly on January 19, 1919, in Epiphany Church. They had one child.

==Retirement and death==
Greb retired following the second Flowers loss and relayed to a friend that he planned on opening a gym in downtown Pittsburgh. In September 1926, his right eye was removed and replaced with a glass prosthesis. Having declined a job as Jack Dempsey&#x27;s sparring partner in preparation for Dempsey-Tunney I (Greb declaring: &quot;I&#x27;d feel like a burglar taking Jack&#x27;s money. Nobody can get him in good enough condition to whip Gene&quot;), Greb checked into an Atlantic City clinic for surgery to repair damage to his nose and respiratory tract caused by his ring career and several car crashes. However, complications occurred, and he died of heart failure on October 22, 1926, at 2:30 pm. Greb was buried at Calvary Cemetery in his hometown of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.

==Legacy==
Greb was willing to box African-American fighters, including Jack Blackburn, Kid Norfolk and Tiger Flowers, in an era when many white boxers refused to do so.

Greb faced 16 Hall of Famers, more than any other boxer. Greb fought them 48 times during his career, going 32–11–5 against men who would later be inducted into the Hall of Fame. These Hall of Famers include Jack Blackburn, who was admitted as a trainer, not a fighter. In 1919 alone, he fought 45 fights and went 45–0, a rare achievement that is unlikely to be recreated by contemporary boxers due to changes in the sport.

===Accolades===

Greb was enshrined in the Ring Magazine Hall of Fame in 1955, the Pennsylvania Sports Hall of Fame in 1970, the World Boxing Hall of Fame in 1980, and the International Boxing Hall of Fame as a first-class inductee in 1990.

Greb is ranked by BoxRec as the 5th greatest fighter. Greb was also named the 2nd greatest fighter of the past 80 years by the &quot;Ring Magazine&quot;, the 5th greatest fighter of all time by historian Bert Sugar, the 4th greatest fighter of all time by historian and boxing commentator Max Kellerman and ranked as the #1 middleweight, the #13 light heavyweight, and the #2 pound-for-pound fighter of all time by the International Boxing Research Organization (IBRO) in 2006. In another poll by IBRO in 2019, Greb was ranked once again as the #1 middleweight, the #9 light heavyweight, and the #3 pound-for-pound fighter of all tim.

Bruce Kenneth Farr (born 1949 in Auckland) is a New Zealand designer of racing and cruising yachts. Farrdesigned boats have won, challenged for, or placed highly in the Whitbread Round the World Race, America&#x27;s Cup, and Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, among others.

Farr&#x27;s services to yacht design were recognised in the 1990 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours, when he was appointed an Officer of the Order of the British Empire. He currently lives near Annapolis, Maryland, USA.

==Early boats==
Farr began building boats at the age of 13 near Warkworth north of Auckland. His first boats were plywood hard chine Moth class designs. He later designed and built variants of Cherubs and especially Flying 18s. His early designs were built in plywood with a focus on light weight and good planing shapes. By his late teens he was designing small lightweight keel boats that were successful on the race course.

He first achieved acclaim as a sailboat designer in the highly competitive 18ft Skiff class, popular in Australia and New Zealand. Farr designs won the 18 ft Skiff Giltinan World title several times in the early 70s. 

== Ocean racing ==
Boats designed by Farr Yacht Design competed in every Whitbread Round the World Race after 1981, and won the 1986, 1990, 1994 and 1998 races. 
The first Bruce Farr yacht in the Whitbread Race was the Farr-designed &quot;Ceramco New Zealand&quot;, which competed in the 1980 Whitbread Race and won the Sydney to Hobart the same year. Farr&#x27;s design proved exceedingly fast, and &quot;Ceramco New Zealand&quot; would have won the Round the World Race, save for an unfortunate dismasting on the first leg, a trans-Atlantic crossing. The deltas for the rest of the legs would have put &quot;Ceramco New Zealand&quot; 30 hours ahead of her next competitor. This yacht was helmed and captained by New Zealand&#x27;s most famous yachtsman Sir Peter Blake.

Farr designed the 58-foot yacht which came to be known as &quot;Maiden&quot;, with the first all-female crew in the 1989–90 Whitbread Round the World Race, skippered by Tracy Edwards MBE. The yacht had previously been skippered by South African Bertie Reed in the 1986-87 BOC single-handed challenge. &quot;Maiden&quot; is still active in 2018.

In 2001 the event was renamed the Volvo Ocean Race. The Farr Yacht Design-designed &quot;Illbruck Challenge&quot; was victorious in 2002. Farr&#x27;s Volvo Ocean Race boats fared less well in 2006 as all four of his designs experienced problems after various failures in their Farr-designed keel canting mechanisms, including an abandonment of the yacht &quot;Movistar&quot; which was unable to prevent the flow of water through the keel box and, to this day, lies on the ocean floor, unrecovered.

Farr&#x27;s Volvo Ocean 65 was the first ever One-Design selected for the Volvo Ocean Race, for the 2014-15 race, and again in the 2017-18 edition.

Farr is the most successful designer of winners of the Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race, having designed 15 overall winners between 1945 and 2003.

Cookson Boatworks developed a new 50&#x27; design, using the Farr office to collaborate, called the Cookson 50.
Irish-owned yacht &quot;Chieftain&quot;, conceived, developed and constructed in 2005 at Cookson&#x27;s in New Zealand, was the overall winner of the 2007 Rolex Fastnet race. Shortly after it was launched, &quot;Chieftain&quot; finished 5th at Australia&#x27;s Hamilton Island Race Week, then won class in the 2005 Rolex Sydney to Hobart Yacht Race.

&quot;Chieftain&quot; competed in all of the 2006 season Royal Ocean Racing Club races and won class in the Round Ireland, won overall in Round Britain and Ireland Races, was awarded Boat of the Year in Ireland in 2006, and finished as the overall winner of the Rolex Fastnet Race.

==America&#x27;s Cup ==
Farr is also a designer of America&#x27;s Cup competitors, including New Zealand&#x27;s entries in 1986 (co-designed with Ron Holland and Laurie Davidson) and 2000, and Larry Ellison&#x27;s United States&#x27;s BMW Oracle Racing Challenger in 2003 (accepted as Challenger of Record for the 2007 Cup). Farr&#x27;s design &quot;Young America&quot; (USA-36) proved faster than the other American sailed yachts, but was unsuccessful in defending the Cup in the 1995 Finals, losing 0–5 to a Davidson designed &quot;Black Magic&quot; of New Zealand, led by the late Sir Peter Blake.

Among the most impressive of Farr&#x27;s design boats was the 90-foot-long KZ-1, the Michael Fay-sponsored boat brought forth to challenge San Diego Yacht Club immediately following their gaining the cup in 1987. The challenge was unusual in that it did not allow the host yacht club the conventional three to four years to prepare for the event, nor did the challenging boat adhere to the 12-metre class design that the America&#x27;s Cup had been contested in for thirty-five years, nor did it allow time for other international challengers and defenders to participate. The unconventional challenge was answered with an unconventional defence, and the entire episode serves as an excellent case study on how the process of yacht racing can be mired in the legal system when America&#x27;s Cup participants radically depart from the spirit of the rules. Farr sailed on the boat during the 1988 America&#x27;s Cup.

== Cruising yachts ==
Farr&#x27;s cruising yachts have been sold and sailed the world around. His production designs (mass-produced as opposed to custom) have been produced by a variety of yacht manufacturers including Cookson Boats, Carroll Marine, Beneteau, Concordia, Baltic, and Nauta.

Some of the larger cruising luxury yachts Farr has designed include &quot;Bavaria&quot;, &quot;Mirabella&quot;, &quot;Philanderer&quot;, &quot;Sojana&quot;, and the two Southern Wind-built 100 footers: &quot;Farewell&quot; and &quot;Farandwide&quot;.

<text>Globalstar, Inc. is an American telecommunications company that operates a satellite constellation in low Earth orbit (LEO) for satellite phone, low-speed data transmission and earth observation. The Globalstar second-generation constellation consists of 25 satellites.

==History==
The Globalstar project was launched in 1991 as a joint venture of Loral Corporation and Qualcomm. On March 24, 1994, the two sponsors announced the formation of Globalstar LP, a limited partnership established in the U.S., with financial participation from eight other companies, including Alcatel, AirTouch, Deutsche Aerospace, Hyundai, and Vodafone. At that time, the company predicted the system would launch in 1998, based on an investment of $1.8 billion.

Globalstar said in March 1994 that it expected to charge $0.65 per minute for cellular service, compared to $3 per minute from Iridium. By then it had a worldwide license from the World Administrative Radio Conference. Globalstar received its US spectrum allocation from the FCC in January 1995, and continued to negotiate with other nations for rights to use the same radio frequencies in their countries.

The first satellites were launched in February 1998, but system deployment was delayed due to a launch failure in September 1998 that resulted in the loss of 12 satellites in a launch by the Russian Space Agency.

The first call on the original Globalstar system was placed on November 1, 1998, from Qualcomm chairman Irwin Jacobs in San Diego to Loral Space &amp; Communications CEO and chairman Bernard Schwartz in New York City.

In October 1999, the system began &quot;friendly user&quot; trials with 44 of 48 planned satellites. In December 1999, the system began limited commercial service for 200 users with the full 48 satellites (no spares in orbit). In February 2000, it began full commercial service with its 48 satellites and 4 spares in North America, Europe, and Brazil. Another eight satellites were maintained as ground spares. Initial prices were $1.79/minute for satellite phone calls.

Following the September 11 attacks in 2001, Irwin Jacobs had his private jet re-classified as an experimental aircraft for the purpose of developing an aviation application of Globalstar. The experimental system not only provided voice and data services to the cockpit and passenger cabin, but also tied in with the aircraft&#x27;s data bus and provided GPS location service. Ground monitoring of aircraft location, heading, speed, and mechanical parameters such as oil pressure and engine RPM were demonstrated. Video surveillance of the cockpit and cabin were also demonstrated. To work around Globalstar&#x27;s low data rate, the experimental system used multiple user terminals (UTs) in parallel. Each UT could be configured for voice, or as a member of a bonded link group for internet access.

On February 15, 2002, the predecessor company Globalstar (old Globalstar) and three of its subsidiaries filed voluntary petitions under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

In 2004, restructuring of the old Globalstar was completed. The first stage of the restructuring was completed on December 5, 2003, when Thermo Capital Partners LLC was deemed to obtain operational control of the business, as well as certain ownership rights and risks. Thermo Capital Partners became the principal owner.

Globalstar LLC was formed as a Delaware limited liability company in November 2003 and was converted into Globalstar, Inc., on March 17, 2006.

In 2007, Globalstar launched eight additional first-generation spare satellites into space to help compensate for the premature failure of their in-orbit satellites. Between 2010 and 2013, Globalstar launched 24 second-generation satellites in an effort to restore their system to full service.

Between 2010 and 2011, Globalstar moved its headquarters from Silicon Valley to Covington, Louisiana in part to take advantage of the state&#x27;s tax breaks and low cost of living.

In April 2018, Globalstar announced it would merge with FiberLight in a deal valued at $1.65 billion. That deal was called off in August 2018 following a lawsuit from Globalstar&#x27;s largest investor, Mudrick Capital Management.

In March 2020, Globalstar announced that the Third Generation Partnership Project (&quot;3GPP&quot;) had approved the 5G variant of Globalstar&#x27;s Band 53, to become known as n53.

On March 6, 2021, Globalstar announced to customers that the Sat-Fi2 (Satellite Wifi Hotspot) and Sat-Fi2 RAS (Remote Antenna Station) services would be discontinued as of March 12, 2021.

On September 7, 2022, Apple announced a cooperation with Globalstar Inc that &quot;would allow iPhone 14 users to send emergency messages&quot; via satellite, starting in the U.S. and Canada. Apple would go on to release the feature on future iPhone models.

On October 29th 2024, Globalstar disclosed in an SEC filing that Apple had agreed to purchase a 20% stake in the company.

==Products and services==
Globalstar is a provider of satellite and terrestrial connectivity services. Globalstar offers these services to commercial and recreational users in more than 120 countries around the world.

Globalstar&#x27;s terrestrial spectrum, Band 53 and its 5G variant n53 offers carriers, cable companies and system integrators a versatile, fully licensed channel for private networks, while Globalstar&#x27;s XCOMP technology offers capacity gains in dense wireless deployments.

The company&#x27;s products include simplex and duplex satellite devices, data modems, and satellite airtime packages.

Many land-based and maritime industries make use of the various Globalstar products and services from remote areas beyond the reach of cellular and landline telephone services. However, many areas of the Earth&#x27;s surface are left without service coverage, since a satellite requires being in range of an Earth station gateway.

Global customer segments include oil and gas, government, mining, forestry, commercial fishing, utilities, military, transportation, heavy construction, emergency preparedness, and business continuity as well as individual recreational users.

Globalstar data communication services are used for a variety of asset and personal tracking, data monitoring, and SCADA applications.

===Satellite messengers===
In late 2007, Globalstar subsidiary SPOT LLC launched a handheld satellite messaging and tracking personal safety device known as the SPOT Satellite Messenger. SPOT X, a two-way satellite messenger with GPS location tracking, navigational capabilities, social media linking and direct communication options to emergency services, was launched in 2018.

== System architecture ==

=== Gateways ===
Globalstar satellites are simple &quot;bent pipe&quot; analog repeaters, unlike Iridium.

A network of ground gateway stations provides connectivity from the 40 satellites to the public switched telephone network and Internet. A satellite must have a Gateway station in view to provide service to any users. Twenty four Globalstar Gateways are located around the world, including seven in North America. Globalstar Gateways are the largest cellular base station in the world with a design capacity for over 10,000 concurrent phone calls over a coverage area that is roughly 50% of the size of the US. Globalstar supports CDMA technology such as the rake receiver and soft handoffs, so a handset may be talking via two spot beams to two Gateways for path diversity.

Globalstar users are assigned telephone numbers on the North American Numbering Plan in North America or the appropriate telephone numbering plan for the country that the overseas gateway is located in, except for Brazil, where the official Globalstar country code (+8818) is used. The use of gateway ground stations provides customers with localized regional phone numbers for their satellite handsets. But service cannot be provided in remote areas (such as areas of the South Pacific and the polar regions) if there are no gateway stations to cover the area. As of May 2012, voice and full-duplex data services are currently non-functional over much of Africa, the South Asian subcontinent, and most mid-ocean regions due to the lack of nearby gateway earth stations.

The Globalstar system uses the Qualcomm CDMA air interface; however, the Ericsson and Telit phones accept standard GSM SIM cards, while the Qualcomm GSP-1600/1700 phones do not have a SIM card interface, but use CDMA/IS-41 based authentication. Therefore, the Globalstar gateways need to support both the CDMA/IS-41 and the GSM standards.

Globalstar has roaming agreements with local cellular operators in some regions, enabling the use of a single phone number in satellite and cellular mode on multi-mode Globalstar handsets. These cellular roaming agreements are not in place in North America. Because of improvements in cellular phones and networks and the limitations inherent to satellite phones, the newest Globalstar handset (released in 2006) does not include cellular connectivity as Globalstar does not expect subscribers to carry it as their only mobile phone.

=== First Generation Satellites ===
Globalstar orbits have an inclination of 52 degrees. Therefore, Globalstar does not cover polar areas, due to the lower orbital inclination.

Globalstar orbits have an orbital height of approximately 1400 km and latency is still relatively low (approximately 60ms).

A Globalstar satellite has two body-mounted, Earth-facing arrays. First-generation Globalstars weigh approximately 550 kg. However, the second-generation Globalstar design will gain significant mass.

In 2005, some of the satellites began to reach the limit of their operational lifetime of 7.5 years. In December 2005, Globalstar began to move some of its satellites into a graveyard orbit above LEO.

==== First-generation satellite problems ====
According to documents filed with the SEC on January 30, 2007, Globalstar&#x27;s previously identified problems with its S-band amplifiers used on its satellites for two-way communications are occurring at a higher rate than expected, possibly eventually leading to reduced levels of two-way voice and duplex data service in 2008. The company&#x27;s simplex data services used to support the asset tracking products as well as the SPOT Satellite Messenger are not affected by the S-band satellite issue mentioned above. Globalstar also launched eight ground spare satellites in 2007 to help reduce the impact of the issue.

In the filing, Globalstar made the following statements:

Industry analysts speculate the problem is caused by radiation exposure the satellites receive when they pass through the South Atlantic Anomaly in their 876-mile (1414 km) altitude orbits.

The S-band antenna amplifier degradation does not affect adversely the Company&#x27;s one-way &quot;Simplex&quot; data transmission services, which utilize only the L-band uplink from a subscriber&#x27;s &quot;Simplex&quot; terminal to the satellites.

The Company is working on plans, including new products and services and pricing programs, and exploring the feasibility of accelerating procurement and launch of its second-generation satellite constellation, to attempt to reduce the effects of this problem upon its customers and operations. The Company will be able to forecast the duration of service coverage at any particular location in its service area and intends to make this information available without charge to its service providers, including its wholly owned operating subsidiaries, so that they may work with their subscribers to reduce the impact of the degradation in service quality in their respective service areas. The Company is also reviewing its business plan in light of these developments.

The Company&#x27;s liquidity remains strong. At December 31, 2006, in addition to its credit agreement, the Company had unrestricted cash on hand and undrawn amounts under the Thermo Funding Company irrevocable standby stock purchase agreement of approximately $195 million.

==== Globalstar&#x27;s interim solution to premature first-generation satellite problems ====
In 2007, Globalstar launched eight spare satellites for its existing constellation with a view to reducing the gaps in its two-way voice and data services pending commercial availability of its second-generation satellite constellation. Globalstar continued to operate its failing satellite constellation to provide and support services on an intermittently-available until the second-generation Globalstar satellites became available for service.

Until the new second-generation Globalstar satellite constellation became operational, Globalstar offered its &quot;Optimum Satellite Availability Tool&quot; website, which subscribers could use to predict when one or more unaffected satellites would be overhead at a specific geographic location.

=== Second-generation satellites ===
In December 2006, Globalstar announced that Alcatel Alenia Space, now Thales Alenia Space in its Cannes headquarters, has been awarded a €661 million contract for the second-generation constellation. The satellites were designed with a life expectancy of 15 years, significantly longer than the design life of Globalstar&#x27;s first-generation constellation. The second- generation constellation will consist of 24 satellites.

In addition, Globalstar announced on April 3, 2007, that it has signed a €9 million agreement with Thales Alenia Space to upgrade the Globalstar satellite constellation, including necessary hardware and software upgrades to Globalstar&#x27;s satellite control network facilities.

In August 2008, Thales Alenia Space began production assembly, integration, and testing of the second-generation flight model satellites, in its Rome factory, for launch as early as Q3 2009.

In July 2009, Globalstar, Inc. announced that it has received complete financing for its second-generation satellite constellation and signed an amendment to the initial contract, specifying in particular, the adjusted conditions for production and the new satellite delivery timetable.

The first six second-generation satellites were launched on October 19, 2010, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. The launch used a Soyuz-2 launch vehicle with a Fregat upper stage. These second-generation satellites are expected to provide Globalstar customers with satellite voice and data services until at least 2025. Six more second-generation satellites were launched in July 2011 followed by another six satellites in December 2011.

The launch of the second-generation constellation was completed on February 6, 2013, with the launch of the final six satellites using a Soyuz 2-1a launch vehicle. The 24 second-generation spacecraft weighed approximately each at launch, and are 3-axis stabilized.

In February 2022, it was announced that Globalstar purchased 17 new satellites to continue its constellation built by MDA and Rocket Lab for $327 million. The satellites are expected to be launched by 2025.

On June 19, 2022, a backup satellite for Globalstar was launched on a Falcon 9 rocket. This was the first Globalstar satellite to launch in over 9 years. Prior to the launch, Globalstar did not announce the mission, besides a vague quarterly report stating the satellite would launch.

== Business operations ==

=== Corporate structure and financing ===
Predecessor Company – Globalstar LP. In February 1995, Globalstar Telecommunications Ltd. raised $200 million from its initial public offering in the NASDAQ market. The IPO price of $20 per share was equivalent to $5 per share after two stock splits. The stock price peaked at (post-split) $50 per share in January 2000, but institutional investors began predicting bankruptcy as early as June 2000. The stock price eventually fell below $1 per share, and the stock was delisted by NASDAQ in June 2001.

After the IPO, the publicly traded Globalstar Telecommunications (NASDAQ symbol GSTRF) owned part of system operator Globalstar LP. From that point on, the primary financing for Globalstar LP was vendor financing from its suppliers (including Loral and Qualcomm), supplemented by junk bonds.

After a total debt and equity investment of $4.3 billion, on February 15, 2002, Globalstar Telecommunications filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, listing assets of $570 million and liabilities of $3.3 billion. The assets were later bought for $43 million by Thermo Capital Partners LLC.

Globalstar LLC and Globalstar, Inc. When the new Globalstar emerged from bankruptcy in April 2004, it was owned by Thermo Capital Partners (81.25%) and the original creditors of Globalstar L.P. (18.75%). Globalstar LLC was incorporated in April 2006 to become Globalstar, Inc.

Globalstar, Inc. completed an IPO in November 2006. The stock currently trades on the NYSE American under the symbol GSAT.

=== SPOT LLC ===
In August 2007, Globalstar announced the introduction of the SPOT Satellite Messenger product, to be marketed through its latest subsidiary SPOT, Inc., later named SPOT LLC. The SPOT Messenger is manufactured by Globalstar partner Axonn LLC and combines the company&#x27;s simplex data technology with a Nemerix GPS chipset. SPOT is intended to leverage Globalstar&#x27;s still adequate L-Band uplink, which is used by simplex modems. The product was launched in early November 2007. Subsequent launches included the SPOT Trace, SPOT X with Bluetooth and Gen4.

=== Collaboration with Apple, Inc. ===
Globalstar provides the infrastructure for the &quot;Emergency SOS via satellite functionality&quot; announced in 2022 for all versions of the iPhone 14 series and newer. Globalstar reserves 85% of its network capacity for the service, and previous to the announcement of the service, Globalstar invested in expanding its infrastructure, including &quot;material upgrades to Globalstar’s ground network to enhance redundancy and coverage&quot; and &quot;construction of 10 new gateways around the world&quot;. In February 2023, Globalstar announced it would be repaying a $150 million debt under a 2019 agreement to EchoStar, which could have prevented the Apple partnership.

=== Employees ===
The first five employees of Globalstar were transferred from the founding companies in 1991. Although few figures were publicly disclosed, the company apparently reached a peak of about 350 employees until layoffs in March 2001. However, this figure was misleading, as most of the development, operations, and sales employees were employed by the company&#x27;s strategic partners.

The company then appointed satellite telecommunications veteran Olof Lundberg to lead a turnaround at the company to serve as chairman and CEO. After beginning his career with Swedish Telecom, Lundberg had been founding Director General (later CEO) of Inmarsat from 1979 to 1995. He served as founding CEO and later CEO and Chairman of ICO Global Communications from 1995 to 1999.

Lundberg resigned from the company (then in bankruptcy) on June 30, 2003.

Paul E. Jacobs was named CEO of Globalstar on Aug. 29, 2023, replacing David Kagan.

<text>Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus (64 BC – AD 8 or c. 12) was a Roman general, author, and patron of literature and art.

==Family==
Corvinus was the son of a consul in 61 BC, Marcus Valerius Messalla Niger, and his wife, Palla. Some dispute his parentage and claim another descendant of Marcus Valerius Corvus to be his father. Valeria, one of his sisters, married Quintus Pedius, a maternal cousin to the Roman emperor Augustus. His great-grandnephew from this marriage was the deaf painter Quintus Pedius. Another sister, also named Valeria married Servius Sulpicius Rufus (a moneyer).

Corvinus married twice. His first wife was Calpurnia, possibly the daughter of the Roman politician Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus. Corvinus had two children with Calpurnia: a daughter, Valeria Messalina, who married the Roman senator Titus Statilius Taurus, consul in AD 11; and a son called Marcus Valerius Messalla Messallinus, consul in 3 BC. His second son was Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus, consul in AD 20, who is believed to have been born to a second unknown wife on the basis of the 22-year gap between the consulship of the elder son and the consulship of the second son. The writings of the poet Ovid (&quot;Ex Ponto&quot; XVI.1-52) reveal that the second wife of Corvinus was a woman called Aurelia Cotta. Another fact supporting the theory that Aurelia Cotta was the mother of Marcus Aurelius Cotta Maximus Messalinus is that he was later adopted into the Aurelii Cottae.

==Life==
Corvinus was educated partly at Athens, together with Horace and the younger Cicero. In early life he became attached to republican principles, which he never abandoned, although in later life he avoided offending Caesar Augustus by not mentioning them too openly.

In 43 BC he was proscribed, but managed to escape to the camp of Brutus and Cassius. After the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC, he went over to Antony, but subsequently transferred his support to Octavian. In 31 BC, Corvinus was appointed consul in place of Antony and took part in the Battle of Actium. He subsequently held commands in the East and suppressed the revolt in Gallia Aquitania; for this latter feat he celebrated a triumph in 27 BC.

Corvinus restored the road between Tusculum and Alba, and many handsome buildings were due to his initiative. He moved that the title of should be bestowed upon Augustus. Yet he also resigned from the post of Prefect of the city in 25 BC after six days of holding this office because it conflicted with his ideas of constitutionalism. It may have been on this occasion that he uttered the phrase &quot;I am ashamed of my power&quot;.

==Patronage and writings==
His influence on literature, which he encouraged after the manner of Gaius Maecenas, was considerable, and the group of literary personalities whom he gathered around him—including Tibullus, Lygdamus (probably a pseudonym) and the poetess Sulpicia—has been called &quot;the Messalla circle&quot;. With Horace and Tibullus he was on intimate terms, and Ovid expresses his gratitude to him as the first to notice and encourage his work. Two panegyrics by unknown authors (one, the , printed among the poems of Tibullus as iii.7; the other included as no. 9 in the &quot;Catalepton&quot;, a collection of small poems attributed to Virgil) indicate the esteem in which he was held.

Corvinus was himself the author of various works, all of which are lost. They included memoirs of the civil wars after the death of Caesar, used by Suetonius and Plutarch; bucolic poems in Greek; translations of Greek speeches; occasional satirical and erotic verses; and essays on the minutiae of grammar. As an orator, he followed Cicero instead of the Atticizing school, but his style was affected and artificial. Later critics considered him superior to Cicero, and Tiberius adopted him as a model. Late in life he wrote a work on the great Roman families, wrongly identified with an extant poem &quot;De progenie Augusti Caesaris&quot; which bears the name of Corvinus, but in fact is a 12th-century production.

==Places associated with Corvinus==
Corvinus had a house on the Palatine Hill in Rome that used to belong to Mark Antony before Augustus presented it to Corvinus and Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa. An inscription (&quot;CIL&quot; 6.29789 = &quot;ILS&quot; 5990) records Corvinus as the owner of the famed Gardens of Lucullus &quot;(Horti Luculliani)&quot; located on the Pincian Hill where the Villa Borghese gardens are today.

The &quot;Casale Rotondo&quot;, a cylindrical tomb near the sixth milestone on the Appian Way, is often identified as being the tomb of Corvinus, but this is debatable. Corvinus is also recorded in an inscription as being one of the three friends of Gaius Cestius responsible for erecting statues that once stood at the site of the famous Pyramid of Cestius which is located close to the Porta San Paolo in Rome.

In 2012, a luxurious villa of Corvinus was found on the via dei Laghi near Ciampino. The finds included seven colossal statues of Niobids that had toppled into the &quot;piscina apparently due to an earthquake.&quot;

In 2014 another luxurious villa of Corvinus on the island of Elba was identified as his. It was burnt down in the 1st c. AD. Since its original excavation in the 1960s it was believed to belong to his family since he was a patron of Ovid who wrote of his visit to Corvinus&#x27;s son on Elba before his exile on the Black Sea. Recent excavations below the collapsed building revealed five dolia for wine which were stamped with the Latin inscription &quot;Hermia Va(leri) (M)arci s(ervus)fecit&quot; (made by Hermias, slave of Marcus Valerius).

==Legendary ancestor of Hungarian royalty==

The Wallachian-Hungarian family of Corvin, which came to prominence with Janos Hunyadi and his son, Matthias Corvinus Hunyadi, King of Hungary and Bohemia, claimed to be descended from Corvinus. This was based on the assertion that he became a big landowner on the Pannonian-Dacian frontiers, the future Hungary and part of Romania, that his descendants continued to live there for the following 1400 years, and that the Hunyadis were his ultimate descendants – for which there is scant if any historical evidence. The connection seems to have been made by Matthias&#x27; biographer, the Italian Antonio Bonfini, who was well-versed with the classical Latin authors.

Bonfini also provided the Hunyadis with the epithet &quot;Corvinus&quot;. This was supposedly due to a case in which the tribune, Marcus Valerius Corvus in 349 BC, while on the battlefield, accepted a challenge to single combat issued to the Romans by a barbarian warrior of great size and strength. Suddenly, a raven flew from a trunk, perched upon his helmet, and began to attack his foe&#x27;s eyes with its beak so fiercely that the barbarian was blinded and the Roman beat him easily. In memory of this event, Valerius&#x27; agnomen &quot;Corvinus&quot; (from &quot;Corvus&quot;, &quot;Raven&quot;) was interpreted as derived from this event. The Hunyadis called themselves &quot;Corvinus&quot; and had their coins minted displaying a &quot;raven with a ring&quot;. This was later taken up in the coat of arms of Polish aristocratic families connected with the Hunyadis, and also led to Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus&#x27; triumph over the Aquitanians (27 BC) being commemorated in the pediment of the Krasiński Palace in Warsaw.

<text>Qualcomm Incorporated () is an American multinational corporation headquartered in San Diego, California, and incorporated in Delaware. It creates semiconductors, software and services related to wireless technology. It owns patents critical to the 5G, 4G, CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA mobile communications standards.

Qualcomm was established in 1985 by Irwin Jacobs and six other co-founders. Its early research into CDMA wireless cell phone technology was funded by selling a two-way mobile digital satellite communications system known as Omnitracs. After a heated debate in the wireless industry, CDMA was adopted as a 2G standard in North America, with Qualcomm&#x27;s patents incorporated. Afterwards, there was a series of legal disputes about pricing for licensing patents required by the standard.

Over the years, Qualcomm has expanded into selling semiconductor products in a predominantly fabless manufacturing model. It also developed semiconductor components or software for vehicles, watches, laptops, wi-fi, smartphones, and other devices.

==History==
===Early history===
Qualcomm was created in July 1985 by seven former Linkabit employees led by Irwin Jacobs. Other co-founders included Andrew Viterbi, Franklin Antonio, Adelia Coffman, Andrew Cohen, Klein Gilhousen, and Harvey White. The company was named Qualcomm for &quot;Quality Communications&quot;. It started as a contract research and development center largely for government and defense projects.

Qualcomm merged with Omninet in 1988 and raised $3.5 million in funding to produce the Omnitracs satellite communications system for trucking companies. Qualcomm grew from eight employees in 1986 to 620 employees in 1991, due to demand for Omnitracs. By 1989, Qualcomm had $32 million in revenue, 50 percent of which was from an Omnitracs contract with Schneider National. Omnitracs profits helped fund Qualcomm&#x27;s research and development into code-division multiple access (CDMA) technologies for cell phone networks.

===1990–2015===
Qualcomm was operating at a loss in the 1990s due to its investment in CDMA research. To obtain funding, the company filed an initial public offering in September 1991, raising . An additional was raised in 1995 through the sale of 11.5 million more shares. The second funding round was done to raise money for the mass manufacturing of CDMA-based phones, base-stations, and equipment, after most US-based cellular networks announced they would adopt the CDMA standard. The company had in annual revenue in 1995 and by 1996.

In 1998, Qualcomm was restructured, leading to a 700-employee layoff. Its base station and cell-phone manufacturing businesses were spun-off in order to focus on its higher-margin patents and chipset businesses. Since the base station division was losing a year (having never sold another base station after making its 10th sale), profits skyrocketed in the following year, and Qualcomm was the fastest growing stock on the market with a 2,621 percent growth over one year. By 2000, Qualcomm had grown to 6,300 employees, in revenues, and in profit. 39 percent of its sales were from CDMA technology, followed by licensing (22%), wireless (22%), and other products (17%). Around this time, Qualcomm established offices in Europe, Asia Pacific, and in the Americas. By 2001, 65 percent of Qualcomm&#x27;s revenues originated from outside the United States with 35 percent coming from South Korea.

In 2005, Paul E. Jacobs, son of Qualcomm founder Irwin Jacobs, was appointed as Qualcomm&#x27;s new CEO. Whereas Irwin Jacobs focused on CDMA patents, Paul Jacobs refocused much of Qualcomm&#x27;s new research and development on projects related to the Internet of things. In the same year they acquired Flarion Technologies, a developer of wireless broadband Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplex Access (OFDMA) technology.

Qualcomm announced Steven Mollenkopf would succeed Paul Jacobs as CEO in December 2013. Mollenkopf said he would expand Qualcomm&#x27;s focus to wireless technology for cars, wearable devices, and other new markets.

===2015–present: NXP, Broadcom and Nuvia===
Qualcomm announced its intent to acquire NXP Semiconductors for $47 billion in October 2016. The deal was approved by U.S. antitrust regulators in April 2017 with some standard-essential patents excluded to get the deal approved.

As the NXP acquisition was ongoing, Broadcom made a $103 billion offer to acquire Qualcomm, and Qualcomm rejected the offer. Broadcom attempted a hostile takeover, and raised its offer, eventually to $121 billion. The potential Broadcom acquisition was investigated by the U.S. Committee on Foreign Investment and blocked by an executive order from U.S. President Donald Trump, citing national security concerns.

Qualcomm&#x27;s NXP acquisition then became a part of the 2018 China–United States trade war. U.S. president Donald Trump blocked China-based ZTE Corporation from buying American-made components, such as those from Qualcomm. The ZTE restriction was lifted after the two countries reached an agreement, but then Trump raised tariffs against Chinese goods. Qualcomm extended a tender offer to NXP at least 29 times pending Chinese approval, before abandoning the deal in July 2018.

On January 6, 2021, Qualcomm appointed its president and chip division head Cristiano Amon as its new chief executive.

On January 13, 2021, Qualcomm announced it would acquire Nuvia, a server CPU startup founded in early 2019 by ex-Apple and ex-Google architects, for approximately $1.4 billion. The acquisition was completed in March 2021, and it was announced that its first products would be laptop CPUs, shipping in the second half of 2022.

In March 2022, Qualcomm acquired the advanced driver-assistance systems and autonomous driving software brand Arriver from the investment company SSW Partners.

In June 2022, Qualcomm acquired Israeli startup Cellwize through its investment arm Qualcomm Ventures.

In August 2022, &quot;Bloomberg News&quot; reported that Qualcomm was planning to return to server CPU market based on Nuvia&#x27;s product. Later that month, Arm Ltd. announced that it sued Qualcomm and Nuvia for breaching license agreements and trademark violations. Arm cited that the chip designs using Arm licenses developed by Nuvia could not be transferred to its parent Qualcomm without permission. Qualcomm indicated that its licenses with Arm cover custom-designed processors.

In January 2023, the company announced a new partnership with Salesforce to develop a connected vehicle platform for automakers using the Snapdragon digital chassis.

In May 2023, Qualcomm announced their intent to purchase Israeli fabless chipmaking company Autotalks for a reported $350–400 million. The purchase is subject to review by the Competition and Markets Authority. In March 2024, it was announced by the Federal Trade Commission that Qualcomm&#x27;s proposed acquisition of Autotalks has been terminated.

In September 2023, the company announced that it had signed a contract rumored to be worth $75 million per year for its Snapdragon brand to be the primary shirt sponsor for English football club Manchester United starting with the 2024–25 season, replacing German company TeamViewer.

In October 2023, Qualcomm introduced the Snapdragon X series, a computing platform for Windows PCs which includes a custom ARM-based Oryon CPU (from Nuvia acquisition), a GPU, and a dedicated neural processing unit.

In October 2024, Qualcomm announced that the Qualcomm-Microsoft exclusive protocol will be expired in December 25 2024, allows Windows on ARM devices can adapt ARM CPUs other than Qualcomm Snapdragon.

In October 2024, Arm Ltd. said it would cancel Qualcomm&#x27;s chip design license in an escalation of the dispute over the acquisition of Nuvia. In December 2024, a U.S. federal jury ruled partially in Qualcomm&#x27;s favor, finding that its designs were properly licensed under an agreement with Arm. However, the jury was deadlocked on one of three issues raised, resulting in a mistrial on that specific point. In February 2025, Arm withdrew its efforts to terminate Qualcomm&#x27;s chip-licensing agreement.

==Wireless CDMA==
===2G===
====Early history====
In mid-1985, Qualcomm was hired by Hughes Aircraft to provide research and testing for a satellite network proposal to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The following year, Qualcomm filed its first CDMA patent (No. 4,901,307). This patent established Qualcomm&#x27;s overall approach to CDMA and later became one of the most frequently cited technical documents in history. The project with the FCC was scrapped in 1988, when the FCC told all twelve vendors that submitted proposals to form a joint venture to create a single proposal.

Qualcomm further developed the CDMA techniques for commercial use and submitted them to the Cellular Telephone Industries Association (CTIA) in 1989 as an alternative to the time-division multiple access (TDMA) standard for second-generation cell-phone networks. A few months later, CTIA officially rejected Qualcomm&#x27;s CDMA standard in favor of the more established TDMA standard developed by Ericsson.

At the time, CDMA wasn&#x27;t considered viable in high-volume commercial applications due to the near-far field effect, whereby phones closer to a cell tower with a stronger signal drown out callers that are further away and have a weaker signal. Qualcomm filed three additional patents in 1989. They were for: a power management system that adjusts the signal strength of each call to adjust for the near-far field effect; a &quot;soft handoff&quot; methodology for transferring callers from one cell-tower to the next; and a variable rate encoder, which reduces bandwidth usage when a caller isn&#x27;t speaking.

====Holy wars of wireless====
After the FCC said carriers were allowed to implement standards not approved by the CTIA, Qualcomm began pitching its CDMA technology directly to carriers. This started what is often referred to as &quot;the Holy Wars of Wireless&quot;, an often heated debate about whether TDMA or CDMA was better suited for 2G networks. Qualcomm-supported CDMA standards eventually unseated TDMA as the more popular 2G standard in North America, due to its network capacity.

Qualcomm conducted CDMA test demonstrations in 1989 in San Diego and in 1990 in New York City. In 1990, Nynex Mobile Communications and Ameritech Mobile Communications were the first carriers to implement CDMA networks instead of TDMA. Motorola, a prior TDMA advocate, conducted CDMA test implementations in Hong Kong and Los Angeles. This was followed by a $2 million trial network in San Diego for Airtouch Communications. In November 1991, 14 carriers and manufacturers conducted large-scale CDMA field tests.

Results from the test implementations convinced CTIA to re-open discussions regarding CDMA and the 2G standard. CTIA changed its position and supported CDMA in 1993, adopting Qualcomm&#x27;s CDMA as the IS-95A standard, also known as cdmaOne. This prompted widespread criticism in forums, trade press, and conventions from businesses that had already invested heavily in the TDMA standard and from TDMA&#x27;s developer, Ericsson.

The first commercial-scale CDMA cellular network was created in Hong Kong in 1995. On July 21, 1995, Primeco, which represented a joint venture of Bell Atlantic, Nynex, US West and AirTouch Communications, announced it was going to implement CDMA-based services on networks in 15 states. By this time, 11 out of 14 of the world&#x27;s largest networks supported CDMA. By 1997 CDMA had 57 percent of the US market, whereas 14 percent of the market was on TDMA.

====International====
In 1991, Qualcomm and the Electronics and Telecommunications Research Institute (ETRI) agreed to jointly develop CDMA technologies for the Korean telecommunications infrastructure. A CDMA standard was adopted as the national wireless standard in Korea in May 1993 with commercial CDMA networks being launched in 1996. CDMA networks were also launched in Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, India, and Venezuela. Qualcomm entered the Russian and Latin American markets in 2005. By 2007, Qualcomm&#x27;s technology was in cell phone networks in more than 105 countries. Qualcomm also formed licensing agreements with Nokia in Europe, Nortel in Canada, and with Matsushita and Mitsubishi in Japan.

Qualcomm entered the Chinese market through a partnership with China Unicom in 2000, which launched the first CDMA-based network in China in 2003. China became a major market for Qualcomm&#x27;s semiconductor products, representing more than fifty percent of its revenues, but also the source of many legal disputes regarding Qualcomm&#x27;s intellectual property. By 2007, $500 million of Qualcomm&#x27;s annual revenues were coming from Korean manufacturers.

====Manufacturing====
Initially, Qualcomm&#x27;s manufacturing operations were limited to a small ASIC design and manufacturing team to support the Omnitracs system. Qualcomm was forced to expand into manufacturing in the 1990s in order to produce the hardware carriers needed to implement CDMA networks that used Qualcomm&#x27;s intellectual property. Qualcomm&#x27;s first large manufacturing project was in May 1993, in a deal to provide 36,000 CDMA phones to US West.

For a time, Qualcomm experienced delays and other manufacturing problems, because it was inexperienced with mass manufacturing. In 1994, Qualcomm partnered with Northern Telecom and formed a joint partnership with Sony, in order to leverage their manufacturing expertise. Nokia, Samsung and Motorola introduced their own CDMA phones in 1997. Qualcomm&#x27;s manufacturing business was losing money due to large capital equipment costs and declining prices caused by competition. Also, in March 1997, after Qualcomm introduced its Q phone, Motorola initiated a lawsuit (settled out of court in 2000) for allegedly copying the design of its Startac phone.

In December 1999, Qualcomm sold its manufacturing interests to Kyocera Corporation, a Japanese CDMA manufacturer and Qualcomm licensee. Qualcomm&#x27;s infrastructure division was sold to competitor Ericsson in 1999 as part of an out-of-court agreement for a CDMA patent dispute that started in 1996. The sale of the infrastructure division marked the beginning of an increase in Qualcomm&#x27;s stock price and stronger financial performance, but many of the 1,200 employees involved were discontented working for a competitor and losing their stock options. This led to a protracted legal dispute regarding employee stock options, resulting in $74 million in settlements by 2005.

===3G===
3G standards were expected to force prior TDMA carriers onto CDMA, in order to meet 3G bandwidth goals. The two largest GSM manufacturers, Nokia and Ericsson, advocated for a greater role for GSM, in order to negotiate lower royalty prices from Qualcomm. In 1998, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) voted in support of the WCDMA standard, which relied less on Qualcomm&#x27;s CDMA patents. Qualcomm responded by refusing to license its intellectual property for the standard.

The Telecommunications Industry Association (TIA) and the Third Generation Partnership Program 2, advocated for a competing CDMA-2000 standard developed primarily by Qualcomm. American and European politicians advocated for the CDMA-2000 and WCDMA standards respectively. The ITU said it would exclude Qualcomm&#x27;s CDMA technology from the 3G standards entirely if a patent dispute over the technology with Ericsson was not resolved. The two reached an agreement out-of-court in 1999, one month before a deadline set by the ITU. Both companies agreed to cross-license their technology to each other and to work together on 3G standards.

A compromise was eventually reached whereby the ITU would initially endorse three standards: CDMA2000 1X, WCDMA and TD-SCDMA. Qualcomm agreed to license its CDMA patents for variants such as WCDMA. There were 240 million CDMA 3G subscribers by 2004 and 143 carriers in 67 countries by 2005. Qualcomm claimed to own 38 percent of WCDMA&#x27;s essential patents, whereas European GSM interests sponsored a research paper alleging Qualcomm only owned 19 percent.

Qualcomm consolidated its interests in telecommunications carriers, such as Cricket Communications and Pegaso into a holding company, Leap Wireless, in 1998. Leap was spun-off later that year and sold to AT&amp;T in 2014.

===4G===
Qualcomm initially advocated for the CDMA-based Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB) standard for fourth generation wireless networks. UMB wasn&#x27;t backwards compatible with prior CDMA networks and didn&#x27;t operate as well in narrow bandwidths as the LTE (long-term evolution) standard. No cellular networks adopted UMB. Qualcomm halted development of UMB in 2005 and decided to support the LTE standard, even though it didn&#x27;t rely as heavily on Qualcomm patents. Then, Qualcomm purchased LTE-related patents through acquisitions. By 2012, Qualcomm held 81 seminal patents used in 4G LTE standards, or 12.46 percent.

Qualcomm also became more focused on using its intellectual property to manufacture semiconductors in a fabless manufacturing model. A VLSI Technology Organization division was founded in 2004, followed by a DFX group in 2006, which did more of the manufacturing design in-house. Qualcomm announced it was developing the Scorpion central processing unit (CPU) for mobile devices in November 2005. This was followed by the first shipments of the Snapdragon system-on-chip product, which includes a CPU, GPS, graphics processing unit, camera support and other software and semiconductors, in November 2007. The Gobi family of modems for portable devices was released in 2008. Gobi modems were embedded in many laptop brands and Snapdragon system on chips were embedded into most Android devices.

Qualcomm won a government auction in India in 2010 for $1 billion in spectrum and licenses from which to offer broadband services. It formed four joint ventures with Indian holding companies for this purpose. A 49 percent stake in the holding companies was acquired by Bharti in May 2012 and the remaining was acquired in October 2012 by AT&amp;T.

===5G===
According to &quot;Fortune Magazine&quot;, Qualcomm has been developing technologies for future 5G standards in three areas: radios that would use bandwidth from any network it has access to, creating larger ranges of spectrum by combining smaller pieces, and a set of services for Internet of things applications. Qualcomm&#x27;s first 5G modem chip was announced in October 2016 and a prototype was demonstrated in October 2017. Qualcomm&#x27;s first 5G antennas were announced in July 2018. As of 2018, Qualcomm had partnerships with 19 mobile device manufacturers and 18 carriers to commercialize 5G technology. By late 2019, several phones were being sold with Qualcomm&#x27;s 5G technology incorporated.

==Software and other technology==
===Early software===
Qualcomm acquired an email application called Eudora in 1991. By 1996, Eudora was installed on 63 percent of PCs. Microsoft Outlook eclipsed Eudora, since it was provided for free by default on Windows-based machines. By 2003 Qualcomm&#x27;s Eudora was the most popular alternative to Microsoft Outlook, but still had only a five percent share of the market. Software development for Eudora was retired in 2006.

In 2001, Qualcomm introduced Brew, a smartphone app development service with APIs to access contacts, billing, app-stores, or multimedia on the phone. South Korean carrier KTFreeTel was the first to adopt the Brew system in November 2001, followed by Verizon in March 2002 for its &quot;Get it Now&quot; program. There were 2.5 million Brew users by the end of 2002 and 73 million in 2003.

===Other technology===
In 2004, Qualcomm created a MediaFLO subsidiary to bring its FLO (forward link only) specification to market. Qualcomm built an $800 million MediaFLO network of cell towers to supplement carrier networks with one that is designed for multimedia. In comparison to cellular towers that provide two-way communications with each cell phone individually, MediaFLO towers would broadcast multimedia content to mobile phones in a one-way broadcast. Qualcomm also sold FLO-based semiconductors and licenses.

Qualcomm created the FLO Forum standards group with 15 industry participants in July 2005. Verizon was the first carrier to partner with MediaFlo in December 2005 for its Verizon Wireless&#x27; V Cast TV, which was followed by the AT&amp;T Mobile TV service a couple months later. The MediaFlo service was launched on Super Bowl Sunday in 2007. Despite the interest the service got among carriers, it was unpopular among consumers. The service required users to pay for a subscription and have phones that were equipped with special semiconductors. The service was discontinued in 2011 and its spectrum was sold to AT&amp;T for $1.93 billion. Qualcomm rebooted the effort in 2013 with LTE Broadcast, which uses pre-existing cell towers to broadcast select content locally on a dedicated spectrum, such as during major sporting events.

Based on technology acquired from Iridigm in 2004 for $170 million, Qualcomm began commercializing Mirasol displays in 2007, which was expanded into eight products in 2008. Mirasol uses natural light shining on a screen to provide lighting for the display, rather a backlight, in order to reduce power consumption. The amount of space between the surface of the display and a mirror within a 10 micron-wide &quot;interferometric modulator&quot; determines the color of the reflected light. Mirasol was eventually closed down after an attempt to revive it in 2013 in Toq watches.
In June 2011, Qualcomm introduced AllJoyn, a wireless standard for communicating between devices like cell phones, televisions, air-conditioners, and refrigerators. The Alljoyn technology was donated to the Linux Foundation in December 2013. Qualcomm and the Linux Foundation then formed the Allseen Alliance to administer the standard and Qualcomm developed products that used the AllJoyn standard In December 2011, Qualcomm formed a healthcare subsidiary called Qualcomm Life. Simultaneously, the subsidiary released a cloud-based service for managing clinical data called 2net and the Qualcomm Life Fund, which invests in wireless healthcare technology companies. The subsidiary doubled its employee-count by acquiring HealthyCircles Inc., a healthcare IT company, the following May. Qualcomm life was later sold to a private equity firm, Francisco Partners, in 2019.

===Developments since 2016===
In 2016, Qualcomm developed its first beta processor chip for servers and PCs called &quot;Server Development Platform&quot; and sent samples for testing. In January 2017, a second generation data center and PC server chip called Centriq 2400 was released. &quot;PC Magazine&quot; said the release was &quot;historic&quot; for Qualcomm, because it was a new market segment for the company. Qualcomm also created a Qualcomm Datacenter Technologies subsidiary to focus on the PCs and servers market. In 2017, Qualcomm introduced embedded technology for 3D cameras intended for augmented reality apps, and also developed and demonstrated laptop processors.

In 2000, Qualcomm formed a joint venture with Ford called Wingcast, which created telematics equipment for cars, but was unsuccessful and closed down two years later. Qualcomm acquired the wireless electric car charging company, HaloIPT, in November 2011 and later sold the company to WiTricity in February 2019. Qualcomm also started introducing Snapdragon system-on-chips and Gobi modems and other software or semiconductor products for self-driving cars and modern in-car computers.

In 2020, Qualcomm hired Baidu veteran, Nan Zhou, to head Qualcomm&#x27;s push into AI.

==Patents and patent disputes==
In 2023, the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO)’s Annual PCT Review ranked Qualcomm&#x27;s number of patent applications published under the PCT System as 3rd in the world, with 3,410 patent applications being published during 2023. In 2017, Qualcomm owned more than 130,000 current or pending patents, an increase from the early 2000s when Qualcomm had more than 1,000 patents. As the sole early investor in CDMA research and development, Qualcomm&#x27;s patent portfolio contains much of the intellectual property that is essential to CDMA technologies.

Since many of Qualcomm&#x27;s patents are part of an industry standard, the company has agreed to license those patents under &quot;fair, reasonable, and non-discriminatory&quot; terms. Qualcomm&#x27;s royalties come out to about 5% or $30 per mobile device. According to Fortune Magazine, this is about 5–10 times more than what is typically charged by other patent-holders. Qualcomm says its patents are more expensive because they are more important and its pricing is within the range of common licensing practices. However, competitors, clients, and regulators often allege Qualcomm charges unreasonable rates or engages in unfair competition for mandatory patents.

===Broadcom===
In 2005, Broadcom and Qualcomm were unable to reach an agreement on cross-licensing their intellectual property, and Broadcom sued Qualcomm alleging it was breaching ten Broadcom patents. Broadcom asked the International Trade Commission to prohibit importing the affected technology. A separate lawsuit alleged Qualcomm was threatening to withhold UMTS patent licenses against manufacturers that bought their semiconductors from competitors, in violation of the standards agreement.

Qualcomm alleged Broadcom was using litigation as a negotiation tactic and that it would respond with its own lawsuits. Qualcomm sued Broadcom, alleging it was using seven Qualcomm patents without permission. By late 2006, more than 20 lawsuits had been filed between the two parties and both sides claimed to be winning.

In September 2006, a New Jersey court judge ruled that Qualcomm&#x27;s patent monopoly was an inherent aspect of creating industry standards and that Qualcomm&#x27;s pricing practices were lawful. In May 2007, a jury ordered Qualcomm to pay Broadcom $19.6 million for infringing on three Broadcom patents. In June 2007, the ITC ruled that Qualcomm had infringed on at least one Broadcom patent and banned corresponding imports. Qualcomm and Broadcom reached a settlement in April 2009, resulting in a cross-licensing agreement, a dismissal of all litigation and Qualcomm paying $891 million over four years.

During the litigation, Qualcomm claimed it had never participated in the JVT standards-setting process. However, an engineer&#x27;s testimony led to discovery of 21 JVT-related emails Qualcomm lawyers had withheld from the court, and 200,000 pages of JVT-related documents. Qualcomm&#x27;s lawyers said the evidence was accidentally overlooked, whereas the judge said it was gross misconduct. Qualcomm was fined $8.5 million for legal misconduct. On appeal, the court held that Qualcomm could only enforce the related patents against non-JVT members, based on the agreements signed to participate in JVT.

===Nokia and Project Stockholm===
Six large telecommunications companies led by Nokia filed a complaint against Qualcomm with the European Commission&#x27;s antitrust division in October 2005. They alleged Qualcomm was abusing its market position to charge unreasonable rates for its patents. Qualcomm alleged the six companies were colluding together under the code name Project Stockholm in a legal strategy to negotiate lower rates. These events led to a protracted legal dispute.

Qualcomm filed a series of patent-infringement lawsuits against Nokia in Europe, Asia, the US, and with the ITC. The parties initiated more than one dozen lawsuits against one another. Several companies filed antitrust complaints against Qualcomm with the Korean Fair Trade Commission, who initiated an investigation into Qualcomm&#x27;s practices in December 2006. The dispute between Qualcomm and Nokia escalated, when their licensing agreement ended in April 2007.
In February 2008, the two parties agreed to halt any new litigation until an initial ruling is made on the first lawsuit in Delaware. Nokia won three consecutive court rulings with the German Federal Patent Court, the High Court in the United Kingdom, and the International Trade Commission respectively. Each found that Nokia was not infringing on Qualcomm&#x27;s patents. In July 2008, Nokia and Qualcomm reached an out-of-court settlement that ended the dispute and created a 15-year cross-licensing agreement.

===Recent disputes===
ParkerVision filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm in July 2011 alleging that it infringed on seven ParkerVision patents related to converting electromagnetic radio signals to lower frequencies. A jury verdict against Qualcomm was overturned by a judge.
In November 2013, the China National Development and Reform Commission initiated an anti-trust investigation into Qualcomm&#x27;s licensing division. The Securities and Exchange Commission also started an investigation into whether Qualcomm breached antibribery laws through its activities in China. The Chinese regulator raided Qualcomm&#x27;s Chinese offices in August 2013. The dispute was settled in 2015 for $975 million. 
In late 2016 The Korea Fair Trade Commission alleged Qualcomm abused a &quot;dominant market position&quot; to charge cell phone manufacturers excessive royalties for patents and limit sales to companies selling competing semiconductor products. The regulator gave Qualcomm a fine of $854 million, which the company said it will appeal. Eventually, Qualcomm lost the case in Supreme Court of the Republic of Korea in 2023, causing to enact the fine in force.
In April 2017, Qualcomm paid an settlement to BlackBerry as a refund for prepaid licensing fees.

In October 2017, Taiwan&#x27;s Fair Trade Commission fined Qualcomm another . In late 2018 Qualcomm paid a settlement to Taiwan for in fines and a promise to spend in the local Taiwan economy.

===Apple===
In January 2017, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) initiated an investigation into allegations that Qualcomm charged excessive royalties for patents that are &quot;essential to industry standards&quot;. That same year, Apple initiated a lawsuit against Qualcomm in the U.S. alleging Qualcomm overcharged for semiconductors and failed to pay in rebates. Apple also filed lawsuits in China and the United Kingdom.
Apple alleged Qualcomm was engaging in unfair competition by selling industry-standard patents at a discount rate in exchange for an exclusivity agreement for its semiconductor products. An FTC report reached similar conclusions. Qualcomm filed counter-claims alleging Apple made false and misleading statements to induce regulators to sue Qualcomm. Qualcomm also sued Apple&#x27;s suppliers for allegedly not paying Qualcomm&#x27;s patent royalties, after Apple stopped reimbursing them for patent fees. Qualcomm petitioned the International Trade Commission to prohibit imports of iPhones, on the premise that they contain stolen Qualcomm patents after Apple&#x27;s suppliers stopped paying.
In August 2017, the International Trade Commission responded to Qualcomm&#x27;s complaints by starting an investigation of Apple&#x27;s use of Qualcomm patents without royalties. Qualcomm also filed suit against Apple in China for alleged patent infringement in October 2017. The following month, Apple counter-sued, alleging Qualcomm was using patented Apple technology in its Android components.
In December 2018, Chinese and German courts held that Apple infringed on Qualcomm patents and banned sales of certain iPhones. Some patents were held to be invalid, while others were infringed by Apple.
In April 2019, Apple and Qualcomm reached an agreement to cease all litigation and sign a six-year licensing agreement. The settlement included a one-time payment from Apple of about . Terms of the six-year licensing agreement were not disclosed, but the licensing fees were expected to increase revenues by per-share.
In January 2018, the European Competition Commission fined Qualcomm for an arrangement to use Qualcomm chips exclusively in Apple&#x27;s mobile products. Qualcomm appealed the decision, and in June 2022, Qualcomm announced the company had won its appeal of the European Union antitrust fine. The appeal had highlighted that Apple as a company had no technical alternative other than to use Qualcomm&#x27;s LTE chipsets.

===Federal Trade Commission===
Stemming from the investigation that led to the Apple lawsuit actions, the FTC filed suit against Qualcomm in 2017 alleging it engaged in antitrust behavior due to its monopoly on wireless broadband technology. The complaints filed by the FTC included that Qualcomm charged &quot;disproportionately high&quot; patent royalty rates to phone manufacturers and refused to sell them broadband chips if they did not license the patents, a policy referred to as &quot;no license, no chips&quot;, that Qualcomm refused to license the patent to other chip manufacturers as to maintain their monopoly, and that Qualcomm purposely offered Apple a lower license cost to use their chips exclusively, locking other competitors as well as wireless service providers out of Apple&#x27;s lucrative market. The trial starting in January 2019, heard by Judge Lucy Koh of the federal Northern District Court that also oversaw the Apple case. Judge Koh ruled in May 2019 against Qualcomm, asserting that Qualcomm&#x27;s practices did violate antitrust. As part of the ruling, Qualcomm was forced to stop its &quot;no license, no chips&quot; bundling with phone manufacturers, and was required to license its patents to other chip manufacturers. As Qualcomm had expressed its intent to appeal, a panel of judges on the 9th circuit of appeals stayed the orders pending the litigation action.

Qualcomm appealed to the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the decision in August 2020. The Ninth Circuit determined that Judge Koh&#x27;s decision strayed beyond the scope of antitrust law and that whether Qualcomm&#x27;s patent licensing may be considered reasonable and non-discriminatory licensing does not fall within the scope of antitrust law, but rather is a matter of contract and patent law. The court concluded that the FTC failed to meet its burden of proof and that Qualcomm&#x27;s business practices were better characterized as &quot;hypercompetitive&quot; rather than &quot;anticompetitive&quot;.

==Operations and market-share==
Qualcomm develops software, semiconductor designs, patented intellectual property, development tools and services, but does not manufacture physical products like phones or infrastructure equipment. The company&#x27;s revenues are derived from licensing fees for use of its intellectual property, sales of semiconductor products that are based on its designs, and from other wireless hardware, software or services.
Qualcomm divides its business into three categories:
* QCT (Qualcomm CDMA Technologies): CDMA wireless products; 80% of revenue
* QTL (Qualcomm Technology Licensing): Licensing; 19% of revenue
* QSI (Qualcomm strategic initiatives): Investing in other tech companies; less than 1% of revenue
Qualcomm is a predominantly fabless provider of semiconductor products for wireless communications and data transfer in portable devices. According to the analyst firm Strategy Analytics, Qualcomm has a 39 percent market-share for smartphone application processors and a 50 percent market-share of baseband processors. Its share of the market for application processors on tablets is 18 percent. According to analyst firm ABI Research, Qualcomm has a 65 percent market-share in LTE baseband. Qualcomm also provides licenses to use its patents, many of which are critical to the CDMA2000, TD-SCDMA and WCDMA wireless standards. The company is estimated to earn $20 for every smartphone sold.
Qualcomm is the largest public company in San Diego. It has a philanthropic arm called The Qualcomm Foundation. A January 2013 lawsuit resulted in Qualcomm voluntarily adopting a policy of disclosing its political contributions. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Qualcomm&#x27;s new disclosure policy was praised by transparency advocates.

<doc id="256916" wikidata="Q1208217" url="?curid=256916" title="Oz (programming language)">
<text>Oz is a multiparadigm programming language, developed in the Programming Systems Lab at Université catholique de Louvain, for programming-language education. It has a canonical textbook: Concepts, Techniques, and Models of Computer Programming.

Oz was first designed by Gert Smolka and his students in 1991. In 1996, development of Oz continued in cooperation with the research group of Seif Haridi and Peter Van Roy at the Swedish Institute of Computer Science. Since 1999, Oz has been continually developed by an international group, the Mozart Consortium, which originally consisted of Saarland University, the Swedish Institute of Computer Science, and the Université catholique de Louvain. In 2005, the responsibility for managing Mozart development was transferred to a core group, the Mozart Board, with the express purpose of opening Mozart development to a larger community.

The Mozart Programming System is the primary implementation of Oz. It is released with an open source license by the Mozart Consortium. Mozart has been ported to Unix, FreeBSD, Linux, Windows, and macOS.

==Language features==
Oz contains most of the concepts of the major programming paradigms, including logic, functional (both lazy evaluation and eager evaluation), imperative, object-oriented, constraint, distributed, and concurrent programming. Oz has both a simple formal semantics (see chapter 13 of the book mentioned below) and Oz is a concurrency-oriented language, as the term was introduced by Joe Armstrong, the main designer of the Erlang language. A concurrency-oriented language makes concurrency easy to use and efficient. Oz supports a canonical graphical user interface (GUI) language QTk.

In addition to multi-paradigm programming, the major strengths of Oz are in constraint programming and distributed programming. Due to its factored design, Oz is able to successfully implement a network-transparent distributed programming model. This model makes it easy to program open, fault-tolerant applications within the language. For constraint programming, Oz introduces the idea of &quot;computation spaces&quot;, which allow user-defined search and distribution strategies orthogonal to the constraint domain.

==Language overview==

===Data structures===
Oz is based on a core language with very few datatypes that can be extended into more practical ones through syntactic sugar.

Basic data structures:
* Numbers: floating point or integer (real integer)
* Records: for grouping data : codice_1. Here the terms x,y, radius etc. are called features and the data associated with the features (in this case 0,1,3 etc.) are the values.
* Tuples: Records with integer features in ascending order: codice_2. 
* Lists: a simple linear structure

&#x27;|&#x27;(2 &#x27;|&#x27;(4 &#x27;|&#x27;(6 &#x27;|&#x27;(8 nil)))) % as a record.
2|(4|(6|(8|nil))) % with some syntactic sugar
2|4|6|8|nil % more syntactic sugar
[2 4 6 8] % even more syntactic sugar

Those data structures are values (constant), first class and dynamically type checked. Variable names in Oz start with an uppercase letter to distinguish them from literals which always begin with a lowercase letter.

===Functions===
Functions are first class values, allowing higher order functional programming:

fun {Fact N}
 if N =&lt; 0 then 1 else N*{Fact N-1} end
end

fun {Comb N K}
 {Fact N} div ({Fact K} * {Fact N-K}) % integers can&#x27;t overflow in Oz (unless no memory is left)
end

fun {SumList List}
 case List of nil then 0
 [] H|T then H+{SumList T} % pattern matching on lists
 end
end

Functions may be used with both free and bound variables. Free variable values are found using static lexical scoping.

====Higher-order programming====
Functions are like other Oz objects. A function can be passed as an attribute to other functions or can be returned in a function. 

fun {Square N} % A general function
 N*N
end

fun {Map F Xs} % F is a function here - higher order programming
 case Xs
 of nil then nil
 [] X|Xr then {F X}|{Map F Xr}
 end
end

%usage
{Browse {Map Square [1 2 3]}} %browses [1 4 9] 
====Anonymous functions====
Like many other functional languages, Oz supports use of anonymous functions (i.e. functions which do not have a name) with higher order programming. The symbol $ is used to denote these.

In the following, the square function is defined anonymously and passed, causing codice_3 to be browsed.

{Browse {Map fun {$ N} N*N end [1 2 3]}} 
Since anonymous functions don&#x27;t have names, it is not possible to define recursive anonymous functions.

====Procedures====
Functions in Oz are supposed to return a value at the last statement encountered in the body of the function during its execution. In the example below, the function Ret returns 5 if X &gt; 0 and -5 otherwise.

declare
fun {Ret X}
 if X &gt; 0 then 5 else ~5 end
end

But Oz also provides a facility in case a function must not return values. Such functions are called procedures. Procedures are defined using the construct &quot;proc&quot; as follows

declare
proc {Ret X}
 if X &gt; 0 then {Browse 5} else {Browse ~5} end
end

The above example doesn&#x27;t return any value, it just prints 5 or -5 in the Oz browser depending on the sign of X.

===Dataflow variables and declarative concurrency ===
When the program encounters an unbound variable it waits for a value. For example, below, the thread will wait until both X and Y are bound to a value before showing the value of Z.

thread 
 Z = X+Y
 {Browse Z}
end
thread X = 40 end
thread Y = 2 end
The value of a dataflow variable cannot be changed once it is bound:

X = 1
X = 2 % error
Dataflow variables make it easy to create concurrent stream agents:
fun {Ints N Max}
 if N == Max then nil
 else 
 {Delay 1000}
 N|{Ints N+1 Max}
 end
end

fun {Sum S Stream}
 case Stream
 of nil then S
 [] H|T then S|{Sum H+S T}
 end
end

local X Y in
 thread X = {Ints 0 1000} end
 thread Y = {Sum 0 X} end
 {Browse Y}
end
Because of the way dataflow variables work, it is possible to put threads anywhere in a program and guaranteed that it will have the same result. This makes concurrent programming very easy. Threads are very cheap: it is possible to have 100,000 threads running at once.

===Example: Trial division sieve===
This example computes a stream of prime numbers using the trial division algorithm by recursively creating concurrent stream agents that filter out non-prime numbers:

fun {Sieve Xs}
 case Xs of nil then nil
 [] X|Xr then Ys in
 thread Ys = {Filter Xr fun {$ Y} Y mod X \= 0 end} end
 X|{Sieve Ys}
 end
end
=== Laziness ===
Oz uses eager evaluation by default, but lazy evaluation is possible. Below, the fact is only computed when value of X is needed to compute the value of Y.

fun lazy {Fact N}
 if N =&lt; 0 then 1 else N*{Fact N-1} end
end
local X Y in
 X = {Fact 100} 
 Y = X + 1
end
Lazy evaluation gives the possibility of storing truly infinite data structures in Oz. The power of lazy evaluation can be seen from the following code sample:

declare
fun lazy {Merge Xs Ys}
 case Xs#Ys
 of (X|Xr)#(Y|Yr) then
 if X &lt; Y then X|{Merge Xr Ys}
 elseif X&gt;Y then Y|{Merge Xs Yr}
 else X|{Merge Xr Yr}
 end
 end
end

fun lazy {Times N Xs}
 case Xs
 of nil then nil
 [] X|Xr then N*X|{Times N Xr}
 end
end

declare H
H = 1 | {Merge {Times 2 H} {Merge {Times 3 H} {Times 5 H}}}
{Browse {List.take H 6}}

The code above elegantly computes all the Regular Numbers in an infinite list. The actual numbers are computed only when they are needed.

=== Message passing concurrency ===
The declarative concurrent model can be extended with message passing via simple semantics:

declare
local Stream Port in
 Port = {NewPort Stream}
 {Send Port 1} % Stream is now 1|_ (&#x27;_&#x27; indicates an unbound and unnamed variable)
 {Send Port 2} % Stream is now 1|2|_ 
 {Send Port n} % Stream is now 1|2| .. |n|_
end 
With a port and a thread, asynchronous agents can be defined:

fun {NewAgent Init Fun}
 Msg Out in
 thread {FoldL Msg Fun Init Out} end
 {NewPort Msg}
end
=== State and objects ===

It is again possible to extend the declarative model to support state and object-oriented programming with very simple semantics. To create a new mutable data structure called Cells:

local A X in
 A = {NewCell 0}
 A := 1 % changes the value of A to 1
 X = @A % @ is used to access the value of A
end
With these simple semantic changes, the whole object-oriented paradigm can be supported. With a little syntactic sugar, OOP becomes well integrated in Oz.

class Counter
 attr val
 meth init(Value)
 val:=Value
 end
 meth browse
 {Browse @val}
 end
 meth inc(Value)
 val :=@val+Value
 end
end

local C in
 C = {New Counter init(0)}
 {C inc(6)}
 {C browse}
end
==Execution speed==
The execution speed of a program produced by the Mozart compiler (version 1.4.0 implementing Oz 3) is very slow. On a 2012 set of benchmarks it averaged about 50 times slower than that of the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) for the C language.

<text>Manius Valerius Maximus Messalla was consul in 263 BC with Manius Otacilius Crassus as his consular collegae. Messalla served as censor in 252 BC.

==Biography==
Manius Valerius Maximus was the son of Marcus Valerius Maximus Corvinus, consul in 289 BC, and grandson of Marcus Valerius Corvus. With his colleague, Manius Otacilius Crassus, he gained a brilliant victory over the Carthaginians and Syracusans: more than sixty of the Sicilian towns acknowledged the supremacy of Rome, and the consuls concluded a peace treaty with Hieron of Syracuse, which lasted the remainder of his [Hieron] long life. This acknowledgment proved equally advantageous to both Syracuse and Rome. He was awarded the triumph &quot;De Paeneis et Rege Siculorum Hierone&quot;.

His relief of Messana obtained him the cognomen Messalla, which remained in the family for nearly 800 years. To commemorate his Sicilian victory, he arranged for it to be pictorially represented (painted) on the wall of the &quot;Curia Hostilia&quot;, the first example of an historical fresco at Rome(it still hung there two centuries later). He is also said to have brought the first sundial from Catana to Rome, where it was set up on a column in the forum.

Messalla was censor in 252 BC, when he degraded 400 equites to aerarians for neglect of duty in.

<doc id="256924" wikidata="Q594109" url="?curid=256924" title="Shelton, Connecticut">
<text>Shelton is a city in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The population was 40,869 at the 2020 United States Census. The city is part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region.

==History==

===Origins===
Shelton was settled by the English as part of the town of Stratford in 1639. On May 15, 1656, the Court of the Colony of Connecticut in Hartford affirmed that the town of Stratford included all of the territory inland from Long Island Sound, between the Housatonic River and the Fairfield town line. In 1662, Stratford selectmen Lt. Joseph Judson, Captain Joseph Hawley and John Minor had secured all the written deeds of transfer from the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation for this vast territory that comprises the present-day towns of Trumbull, Shelton and Monroe. Shelton was split off from Stratford in 1789, as &quot;Huntington&quot; (named for Samuel Huntington).
The current name originated in a manufacturing village started in the 1860s named for the Shelton Company founded by Edward N. Shelton—also founder of Ousatonic Water Power Company.
The rapidly growing borough of Shelton incorporated as a city in 1915 and was consolidated with the town of Huntington in 1919, establishing the present city of Shelton.

===Decline of Shelton&#x27;s industry===
Shelton was the site of one of the largest arson fires in the United States history. It happened in 1975 when the Sponge Rubber Products plant (formerly owned by B.F. Goodrich) was set on fire. Charles Moeller, president of parent company Grand Sheet Metal Products, was acquitted of criminal charges, but in a suit under civil law (where preponderance of evidence suffices to establish a factual claim), a jury found in 1988 the insurer was entitled to disallow claims on the fire losses, based on the finding that the company&#x27;s top officials arranged the fire to claim insurance money. Eight others were convicted or pleaded guilty.

The explosion that destroyed the Sponge Rubber Plant on Canal Street in 1975 marked the start of the decline of Shelton&#x27;s industries. During the remainder of the 1970s and 1980s several firms that operated factories along the banks of the Housatonic River either went out of business or relocated to areas where labor and operating costs were cheaper. In 1995, Sikorsky Aircraft closed a plant off Bridgeport Avenue that manufactured electrical components for helicopters.

===Rise of Shelton&#x27;s office space===
With the completion of Route 8, new office spaces and businesses were attracted to the town, due to its Fairfield County location coupled with low costs of doing business as opposed to places such as Stamford or Greenwich. Major firms such as Tetley Tea, TIE Communication, I.T.T., Black and Decker, Sikorsky Aircraft, Gama Aviation, Chesebrough-Pond&#x27;s, Tetra-Pak, General Electric, and Bunker Ramo. Over of corporate office space spread across 12 buildings was constructed by the R.D. Scinto corporation alone.

===Downtown revitalization===
Efforts are underway to restore nineteenth-century industrial buildings in the downtown area; those that were beyond repair were demolished in the late 1990s and early 2000s and replaced with the Veteran&#x27;s Memorial and a farmer&#x27;s market. The Riverwalk Park next to the Veterans Memorial was created on the site of the former Sponge Rubber Plant. Other buildings along Howe Avenue, one of the city&#x27;s main thoroughfares, have been restored, while developers have renovated two 19th-century factory buildings on Bridge Street, converting them into luxury condominiums. Several downtown streets have been reconstructed as part of a streetscape improvement project: sidewalks were reconstructed with brick and cobblestone, trees were planted, and some power lines were rerouted underground to improve the appearance of Shelton&#x27;s central business district. In March 2008, Connecticut Governor M. Jodi Rell announced that after negotiations with State Senator Dan Debicella and State Representative Jason Perillo, state bond funds in the amount of $2 million would be directed toward additional infrastructure improvements.

===Other events===

In November 2007, a tree growing on Soundview Avenue in Shelton was selected and felled to be the Rockefeller Center Christmas tree.

On May 30, 2008, producers and staff for the upcoming movie &quot;All Good Things&quot; shot one scene on Canal St. in downtown Shelton. The scene was underneath the train trestle and involved one of the characters dragging a body and dumping it into the Housatonic River.

On July 31, 2009, a line of heavy thunderstorms with weak rotation spawned an EF1 tornado, which touched down with wind speeds between 95 and 105 miles per hour. According to WTNH, the most concentrated damage was along the Oronoque Trail, where many trees were blown down. There were no injuries or fatalities.

In November 2013, a tree located on Kazo Drive was picked to be the second Rockefeller Center Christmas tree from Shelton.
==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and , or 4.26%, is water.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 38,101 people, 14,190 households, and 10,543 families residing in the city. The population density was . There were 14,707 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the city was 94.44% White, 1.12% Black or African American, 0.15% Native American, 2.08% Asian, 0.89% from other races, and 1.31% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 3.48% of the population.

There were 14,190 households, out of which 32.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.9% were married couples living together, 8.5% had a female householder with no husband present, and 25.7% were non-families. 21.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 9.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.65 and the average family size was 3.11.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 23.5% under the age of 18, 5.8% from 18 to 24, 30.0% from 25 to 44, 25.7% from 45 to 64, and 14.9% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 93.8 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 90.3 males.

The median income for a household in the city was $67,292, and the median income for a family was $75,523 (these figures had risen to $80,694 and $94,485 respectively as of a 2007 estimate). Males had a median income of $50,210 versus $36,815 for females. The per capita income for the city was $29,893. About 2.5% of families and 3.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 3.2% of those under age 18 and 5.5% of those age 65 or over.

==Government and politics==

Republican Mark Lauretti has served as mayor since taking office in 1991.

The Republican Party has controlled the city government since the 1980s. Before the 2007 Elections, the Board of Aldermen consisted of five Republican members, two Citizens&#x27; United members, and one Democratic member. Mayor Lauretti was re-elected for a fourteenth term on November 7, 2017. The current Board of Aldermen consists entirely of eight Republicans.

Political representation at the state level has been Republican since the 1960s. Republican State Senator Kevin Kelly of Stratford replaced Senator Dan Debicella in 2010 after Debicella sought election to the U.S. Congress. There are two State Assembly districts that cover Shelton. In 2007, Republican State Representative Jason Perillo of the 113th District took office. He won in a special election following the death of Richard O. Belden, who had represented the town for 32 years. Republican State Representative Ben McGorty of the 122nd District took office after winning a special election in 2014 following the death of previous State Representative Larry Miller.

At the federal level, Shelton is represented by Democratic U.S. Senators Richard Blumenthal and Chris Murphy in the United States Senate, along with the rest of the state. Representation of Shelton in the U.S. House of Representatives is split between the 3rd and 4th congressional districts, which are represented by Democratic U.S. Representatives Rosa DeLauro and Jim Himes, respectively. The boundary between the two congressional districts lies roughly along Route 8; Himes represents the portion of the city to the north and west of Route 8 while DeLauro represents sections of Shelton to the south and east.

Shelton is a Republican stronghold in presidential elections, as the city has voted for the GOP presidential nominee in every election since 1964 when Lyndon B. Johnson carried the municipality in his landslide election.

===Sheriff===
Shelton is one of the few municipalities in Connecticut with its own sheriff&#x27;s department, the Shelton Sheriff&#x27;s Department. The sheriff&#x27;s department, which is distinct from the police department, is responsible for serving legal process within the city of Shelton. The Fairfield County Sheriff&#x27;s Department had a similar role before it and all other county sheriffs in Connecticut were abolished in 2000. The Shelton Sheriff&#x27;s Department is not a law enforcement agency. Members are political appointees and receive no salary and derive income from fees charged to serve legal papers. the head of the department is Sheriff Carl Sylvester.

==Landscape, geology, and natural environment==
The City of Shelton&#x27;s goal is to preserve at least 15% of the land as permanently protected, locally controlled open space in the following three forms: City of Shelton Public Open Space properties, Privately owned farmland protected by the purchase of development rights, and properties held by the non-profit Shelton Land Conservation Trust. As of 2009, these forms of open space amount to 13% of the City and more than . The City of Shelton owns close to of Public Open Space, Protected Farmland is , and the Shelton Land Trust organization has preserved .

There are over of hiking trails in Shelton, including a portion of the Paugussett &quot;Blue Blazed&quot; trail, part of an network of hiking trails throughout the state. There is opportunity for fishing, boating, geocaching and letterboxing, hiking, walking and biking. Dogs are welcomed when on leash. There is no hunting on city-owned open space, by ordinance.

==Education==
Shelton Public Schools include Shelton High School for grades 9 through 12, Shelton Intermediate School for grades 7 and 8. Perry Hill School for grades 5 and 6, and five primary schools for pre-kindergarten through fourth grade, including Elizabeth Shelton Elementary, Mohegan Elementary School, Long Hill Elementary School, Booth Hill Elementary School, and Sunnyside Elementary School.

==Fire department==
The City of Shelton is protected by the 246-member all-volunteer Shelton Fire Department, which consists of four fire companies (Echo Hose Hook &amp; Ladder Co. 1, Huntington Co. 3, Pine Rock Co. 4, White Hills Co. 5) operating out of four fire stations located throughout the city. There is also a board of fire commissioners with a representative from each company.

==Recreation==
There are two private golf courses in town Highland Golf Club of Shelton is located in the downtown Shelton area where it was founded in 1900. It is a 9-hole course (with 10 greens to allow alternating #2 and #11 where the tee shot goes over Perry Hill Road) in which an unknown original designer created difficult greens. The clubhouse&#x27;s 1920s era structure still remains as the core to the current structure. Brownson Country Club is an 18-hole venue located in the Huntington section of Shelton. There is an annual competition between the clubs for the &quot;Mayor&#x27;s Trophy&quot;, alternating the venue each year. The 2009 Champion and holder of the Trophy is Highland.

<text>Stamford () is a city in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States, outside of New York City. It is the sixth-most populous city in New England. Stamford is also the largest city in the Western Connecticut Planning Region, and Connecticut&#x27;s second-most populous city, behind Bridgeport. With a population of 135,470, Stamford passed Hartford and New Haven in population as of the 2020 census. It is in the Bridgeport–Stamford–Danbury metropolitan statistical area, which is part of the New York City metropolitan area (specifically, the New York–Newark, NY–NJ–CT–PA Combined Statistical Area).

As of 2023, Stamford is home to eight ’&#x27;Fortune’&#x27; 500 companies and numerous divisions of large corporations. This gives it the largest financial district in the New York metropolitan region outside New York City and one of the nation&#x27;s largest concentrations of corporations. Dominant sectors of Stamford&#x27;s economy include financial management and real estate, tourism, information technology, healthcare, telecommunications, transportation, and retail. Its metropolitan division is home to colleges and universities including UConn Stamford and Norwalk Community College.

==History==
Stamford was known as Rippowam by the Siwanoy Native American inhabitants of the region, and the very first European settlers in the area also called it that. The present name is after the town of Stamford, Lincolnshire, England. The deed to Stamford was signed on July 1, 1640, between Captain Turner of the New Haven Colony and Chief Ponus. By the 18th century, one of the town&#x27;s primary industries was merchandising by water, which was possible due to Stamford&#x27;s proximity to New York.

In 1692, Stamford was home to a less famous witch trial than the well-known Salem witch trials, which also occurred in 1692. The accusations were less fanatical and on a smaller scale, but they also grew to prominence through gossip and hysterics.

New Canaan officially separated from Stamford when it incorporated as a town in 1801, followed by Darien in 1820.

Starting in the late 19th century, New York residents built summer homes on the shoreline, and some moved to Stamford permanently and started commuting to Manhattan by train. Stamford incorporated as a city in 1893.

In 1950, the U.S. Census Bureau reported the city&#x27;s population as 94.6% white and 5.2% black.

In the 1960s and 1970s, Stamford&#x27;s commercial real estate boomed as corporations relocated from New York City to peripheral areas. A massive urban redevelopment campaign during that time resulted in a downtown with many tall office buildings. The F.D. Rich Company was the city-designated urban renewal developer of the downtown area in an ongoing, contentious project beginning in the 1960s and continuing through the 1970s. The company put up what was the city&#x27;s tallest structure, One Landmark Square, at 21 floors high, and the GTE building (now One Stamford Forum), along with the Marriott Hotel, the Stamford Town Center and many other downtown office buildings. One Landmark Square has since been dwarfed by the new 34-story Park Tower Stamford condominium tower, and again by the Atlantic Station development, another Rich Company project in partnership with Cappelli Enterprises. Over the years, other developers have joined in building up the downtown, a process that continued through the 1980s and 1990s and into the new century.

Since 2008, an mixed-use redevelopment project for Stamford&#x27;s Harbor Point neighborhood has added additional growth south of downtown. The redevelopment plan included of new residential, retail, office and hotel space, and a marina. In July 2012, roughly 900 of the projected 4,000 Harbor Point residential units had been constructed. New restaurants and recreational activities have come up in the Harbor Point area, which is considered New Stamford. From 2008 to 2017, the city issued permits for 4,341 housing units.

During the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S., many New Yorkers relocated to Stamford and its metropolitan area.

==Geography==

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the city has an area of , of which is land and is water. Stamford is the state&#x27;s largest city by area. The population density was in 2010. The city is halfway between Manhattan and New Haven at approximately from each; it is from the state capital of Hartford.

Stamford is near the southwestern point of Connecticut, on Long Island Sound; it is part of the Gold Coast. Stamford comprises approximately 45 distinct neighborhoods and villages, and two historic districts, including Cove, East Side, Downtown, North Stamford, Glenbrook, West Side, Turn of River, Waterside, Springdale, Belltown, Ridgeway, Newfield, South End, Westover, Shippan, Roxbury, and Palmers Hill.

North of the Merritt Parkway is considered the North Stamford section of the city, encompassing its largest land mass though it is the least densely populated. North Stamford functionally and legally acts as one municipality with the city of Stamford. Stamford borders Pound Ridge, New York to the north, the Long Island Sound to the south, Greenwich to the west, Darien to the east, and New Canaan to the northeast.

The city has islands in Long Island Sound: Cove Island, Grass Island, Greenway Island, Jack Island, and Cuties Island (also known as Vincent Island). Cove Island is a prominent beach and recreation area. It lies approximately from Norwalk.

===Climate===

Under the Köppen climate classification, Stamford has a temperate climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;), with long, hot summers, and cool to cold winters, with precipitation spread fairly evenly throughout the year. Like the rest of coastal Connecticut, it lies in the broad transition zone between the colder continental climates of the northern U.S. and southern Canada to the north, and the warmer temperate and subtropical climates of the middle and south Atlantic states to the south.

The warm/hot season in Stamford is from mid-April through early November. Late day thundershowers are common in the hottest months (June through September), despite the mostly sunny skies. The cool/cold season is from late November though mid-March. Winter weather is far more variable than summer weather along the Connecticut coast, ranging from sunny days with higher temperatures to cold and blustery conditions with occasional snow. As on much of the Connecticut coast and nearby Long Island, some of the winter precipitation is rain or a mix and rain and wet snow. Stamford averages about of snow annually, compared to inland areas like Hartford and Albany that average .

Although infrequent, tropical cyclones (hurricanes/tropical storms) have struck Connecticut and the Stamford metropolitan area. Hurricane landfalls have occurred along the Connecticut coast in 1903, 1938, 1944, 1954 (Carol), 1960 (Donna), Hurricane Gloria in 1985, and Hurricane Sandy in 2012.

Stamford lies in USDA garden zone 7a. It averages about 90 days annually with freeze. Coastal Connecticut is the broad transition zone where so-called &quot;subtropical indicator&quot; plants and other broadleaf evergreens can be cultivated. As such, Southern Magnolias, Needle Palms, Windmill palm, Loblolly Pines, and Crape Myrtles are grown in private and public gardens. As in much of coastal Connecticut, Long Island, and coastal New Jersey, the growing season is rather long in Stamford, averaging 210 days from April8 to November5 according to the National Weather Service in Bridgeport.

==Transportation==
===Mass transit===

Stamford is on the New Haven Line of the Metro-North Railroad, the commuter rail system for northern metropolitan New York City. Stamford is the second-busiest station on the Metro-North system, after Grand Central Terminal, and serves as a major transfer point for local trains. Stamford Station is also the terminus of a Metro-North branch that ends in New Canaan, away, known as the New Canaan Branch, and a part-time terminal of Shore Line East and Danbury Branch trains. Two smaller train stations in Stamford are Glenbrook and Springdale, both a part of the New Canaan branch.

Commuter trains come into Stamford from all points between New London to the east and New York (Grand Central Terminal) to the south. The average nonstop commute is 47 minutes. Trains operate from the Stamford station between 4:43 a.m. (first departure to Grand Central) until 12:55 a.m. (last departure to Grand Central).

Stamford also serves as a prominent station along Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor. The Acela, a high speed train service between Boston and Washington D.C., makes several daily stops in Stamford. Amtrak&#x27;s higher-speed Northeast Regional (between Boston or Springfield, Massachusetts and Washington, D.C.) and Vermonter (between Saint Albans, Vermont and Washington, D.C.) also make plentiful daily stops in Stamford. Amtrak has facilities in upper level of the Stamford station.

===Airports===
Stamford is within reasonable distance of 11 airports: four general aviation, two regional, five international.


===Buses===
City bus transportation is provided by CT Transit, which is run and financed by the Connecticut Department of Transportation. The main terminal is adjacent to the train station on State Street, under the I-95 highway. Bus service runs along major arterial roads through the towns of Darien, Norwalk, Greenwich and Port Chester, New York. A non-stop direct route is also offered to White Plains, New York. Commuters can connect in Norwalk to points as far east as Milford and as far north as Danbury. Additional connections can be made in Port Chester and White Plains to all points covered by the Bee-Line bus system in Westchester County.

Greyhound used to provide inter-city bus service from the lower level of the Stamford train station. Bus service was provided to New Haven (Union Station), Boston (South Station), and New York (Port Authority). However, the Greyhound office has been closed for several years, and Stamford is no longer listed on Greyhound&#x27;s website 

===Highways===
Two limited-access highways run through the city. Interstate 95 serves as the main route through downtown Stamford with four exits (6–9). The Merritt Parkway runs through the northern part of the city. This road is designated for passenger vehicles only. Any congestion on the Merritt Parkway is mostly likely to occur on the southbound lane in the morning and the northbound in the evening (route to and from New York). At night, due to the absence of lighting, visibility on the Merritt Parkway is relatively poor. Stamford exits on the Merritt Parkway are 33–35, and exit 36 is just over the border in New Canaan.

Stamford is also served by four other state highways. Route1, also known as Main Street in Stamford, is also used as a major artery during the morning and evening commute. Most traffic via Route1 is short distance or fairly local, yet vehicles have utilized Route1 during times of heavy congestion on I-95 as a re-route. Route 137 (Washington Boulevard and High Ridge Road) is the main north–south road of the city and runs from the Stamford Transportation Center and serves the Turn of River, North Stamford, and High Ridge sections of the city. Route 104 (Long Ridge Road) branches off from Route 137 to serve the Long Ridge section. Route 106 (Courtland Avenue) serves the Glenbrook neighborhood and continues towards the town of Darien.

<text>Trumbull is a town located in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Greater Bridgeport Planning Region, and borders on the cities of Bridgeport and Shelton, as well as the towns of Stratford, Fairfield, Easton and Monroe. The population was 36,827 during the 2020 census. The Trumbull area was the home of the Golden Hill Paugussett Indian Nation for thousands of years before the English settlement was made in 1639. 

After independence, the successful American Yankees named the town in after one of their own, Jonathan Trumbull (1710–1785), a merchant, Patriot (American soldier) and statesman. Aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky lived in Trumbull during his active years, when he designed, built, and flew fixed-wing aircraft and put the helicopter into mass production for the first time.

==History==

The area comprising the town of Trumbull was occupied by the Paugusset Indian nation for thousands of years before English colonists arrived here during the Great Migration from England and established the town of Stratford, Connecticut, in 1639.

In 1725, Stratford residents living in the northern part of the town petitioned the Colony of Connecticut to establish their own separate village. They wished to call their new village Nickol&#x27;s Farms, after the family who lived in its center. However, the Colony named it &quot;Unity&quot; instead. The village of Unity merged with the village to its west called Long Hill (organized in 1740), to form the town of &quot;North Stratford&quot; in 1744.

In the late 1780s, North Stratford began to petition the Connecticut General Assembly seeking independence from Stratford. The Assembly finally granted full town rights in October 1797 and named the new town after Jonathan Trumbull (1710–1785), a merchant, patriot, and slave owner when it was incorporated in 1797. Aviation pioneer Igor Sikorsky lived in Trumbull during his active years when he designed, built, and flew fixed-wing aircraft and put the helicopter into mass production for the first time.

<text>Westport is a town in Fairfield County, Connecticut, United States. Located in the Gold Coast along the Long Island Sound, it is northeast of New York City and is part of the Western Connecticut Planning Region. Westport&#x27;s public school system is ranked as the top public school district in Connecticut and 17th best school district in the United States.

==History==

The earliest known inhabitants of the Westport area as identified through archaeological finds date back 7,500 years. Records from the first white settlers report the Pequot Indians living in the area which they called &quot;Machamux&quot; translated by the colonialists as &quot;beautiful land&quot;. Settlement by colonialists dates back to the five &quot;Bankside Farmers&quot;; whose families grew and prospered into a community that continued expanding. The settlers arrived in 1693, having followed cattle to the isolated area. The community had its own ecclesiastical society, supported by independent civil and religious elements, enabling it to be independent from the Town of Fairfield. As the settlement expanded its name changed: it was briefly known as &quot;Bankside&quot; in 1693, officially named Green&#x27;s Farm in 1732 in honor of Bankside Farmer John Green and in 1835 incorporated as the Town of Westport.


During the Revolutionary War, on April 25, 1777, a British force of 1,850 under the command of the Royal Governor of the Province of New York, Major General William Tryon, landed on Compo Beach to destroy the Continental Army&#x27;s military supplies in Danbury. Minutemen from Westport and the surrounding areas crouched hiding while Tryon&#x27;s troops passed and then launched an offensive from their rear. A statue on Compo Beach commemorates this plan of attack with a crouching Minuteman facing away from the beach, looking onto what would have been the rear of the troops. An additional statue of two cannons facing the water, a testament to the resistance the minutemen displayed, was erected on the beach in 1901. A sign on Post Road East also commemorates this event.

The Town of Westport was officially incorporated on May 28, 1835, with lands from Fairfield, Weston and Norwalk. Daniel Nash led 130 people of Westport in the petitioning of the Town of Fairfield for Westport&#x27;s incorporation. The driving force behind the petition was to assist their seaport&#x27;s economic viability that was being undermined by neighboring towns&#x27; seaports. For several decades after that, Westport was a prosperous agricultural community, distinguishing itself as the leading onion-growing center in the U.S. In addition, Westport became a shipping center in part to transport onions to market. Blight caused the collapse of Westport&#x27;s onion industry, leading to mills and factories replacing agriculture as the town&#x27;s economic engine.

Starting around 1910 the town experienced a cultural expansion. During this period artists, musicians, and authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald moved to Westport to be free from the commuting demands experienced by business people. The roots of Westport&#x27;s reputation as an arts center can be traced back to this period during which it was known as a &quot;creative heaven.&quot;

In the 20th century, a combination of industrialization and popularity among New Yorkers attracted to fashionable Westport—which had attracted many artists and writers—resulted in farmers selling off their land. Westport changed from a community of farmers to a suburban development.

From the 1950s through the 1970s, New Yorkers relocating from the city to the suburbs discovered Westport&#x27;s culture of artists, musicians and authors. The population grew rapidly, assisted by the ease of commuting to New York City and back again to rolling hills and the &quot;natural beauty of the town.&quot; By this time Westport had &quot;chic New York-type fashion shopping&quot; and a school system with a good reputation, both factors contributing to the growth.

By the 21st century, Westport had developed into a center for finance and insurance, as well as professional, scientific and technical services.

==Geography==
According to a publication by the 2010 Census, Westport has a total area of of which (59.67%) is land with the remaining area of (40.20%) water.

===Topography===
Both the train station and a total of 26 percent of town residents live within the 100-year floodplain. The floodplain was breached in 1992 and 1996 resulting in damage to private property, the 1992 flooding of the train station parking lot and the implementation of flood mitigation measures that include town regulations that affect renovations and additions to building within the floodplain zone.

<text>New Britain is a city in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. It is located approximately southwest of Hartford. The city is part of the Capitol Planning Region. According to 2020 Census, the population of the city is 74,135.

Among the southernmost of the communities encompassed within the Hartford-Springfield Knowledge Corridor metropolitan region, New Britain is home to Central Connecticut State University and Charter Oak State College. The city was noted for its industry during the 19th and early 20th centuries, and notable sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places include Walnut Hill Park, developed by the landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted and Downtown New Britain.

The city&#x27;s official nickname is the &quot;Hardware City&quot; because of its history as a manufacturing center and as the headquarters of Stanley Black &amp; Decker. Because of its large Polish population, the city is often playfully referred to as &quot;New Britski.&quot;

==History==
New Britain was settled in 1687 and incorporated as a new parish as the New Britain Society in 1754. Chartered in 1850 as a township and in 1871 as a city, New Britain had separated from the nearby towns of Farmington and Berlin, Connecticut. A consolidation charter was adopted in 1905.

During the early part of the 20th century, New Britain was known as the &quot;Hardware Capital of the World&quot;, as well as &quot;Hardware City&quot;. Major manufacturers, such as The Stanley Works, the P&amp;F Corbin Company (later Corbin Locks), Landers, Frary &amp; Clark (LF&amp;C) and North &amp; Judd, were headquartered in the city.
In 1843 Frederick Trent Stanley established Stanley&#x27;s Bolt Manufactory in New Britain to make door bolts and other wrought-iron hardware. In 1857 his cousin Henry Stanley founded The Stanley Rule and Level Company in the city. Planes invented by Leonard Bailey and manufactured by the Stanley Rule and Level Company, known as &quot;Stanley/Bailey&quot; planes, were prized by woodworkers of the late 19th and early 20th centuries and remain popular among wood craftsmen today. The two companies merged in 1920, and the Stanley Rule and Level Company became the Hand Tools Division of Stanley Works.

The wire coat hanger was invented in 1869 by O. A. North of New Britain.
In 1895, the basketball technique of dribbling was developed at the New Britain YMCA. 
In 1938, New Britain High School competed in the high school football national championship game in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. 
1954 saw the development of racquetball, also at the YMCA.

The heads of the fire and police departments and seven other municipal employees were arrested as part of a corruption scandal in the 1970s.

==City motto==

New Britain&#x27;s motto, &quot;&quot;—translated from Latin—means &quot;Industry fills the hive and enjoys the honey.&quot; This phrase was coined by Elihu Burritt, a 19th-century New Britain resident, diplomat, philanthropist and social activist.

In 2007 it was reported that the Latin word for &quot;honey&quot; in the motto had been a typo for decades; it should be &#x27;, but it had long been misspelled as &quot;mele&quot;. Former mayor William McNamara, who unsuccessfully tried to fix it during his term, suggested &quot;to either fix the spelling immediately&quot; or &quot;switch to the English version of the motto.&quot; As controversy arose from the matter, the word was superseded with the correct spelling, &#x27;.

==Geography and topography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 13.4 square miles (34.7 km), of which 13.3 square miles (34.6 km) is land and 0.1 square mile (0.2 km) (0.52%) is water.

New Britain&#x27;s terrain is mostly made up of gentle, rolling hills and young Connecticut forest. The many parks are populated with trees, and in small, undeveloped areas, there are also brushy woods. New Britain&#x27;s streets also have many trees lining the sides of the roads. Many front yards in the northern half of the city have at least one tree. One or two streams flow through New Britain, undisturbed by the development.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2020, there were 74,135 people. The racial makeup of the city was 38.1% Non-Hispanic White, 42.7% Hispanic or Latino (of any race), 14.2% African American, 0.4% Native American, 2.7% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander and 11.7% from two or more races.

There were 28,261 households, out of which 33.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 29.4% were married couples living together, 25.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 40.7% were non-families. 33.0% of all households were made up of individuals, and 13.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.50 and the average family size was 3.23.

In the city, the population was spread out, with 23.6% under the age of 18, 10.6% from 18 to 24, 29.8% from 25 to 44, 21.8% from 45 to 64, and 14.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 34 years. For every 100 females, there were 88 males. 

In 2021, the median income for a household in the city was $51,586, and for a family, was $67,482. The per capita income for the city was $26,152. 19.9% of the population below the poverty line (Poverty Rate is 15.4% for White Non-Hispanic residents, 25.7% for Hispanic or Latino residents).

=== Polish community ===
New Britain has the largest Polish population of any city in Connecticut, and by 1930 a quarter of the city was ethnically Polish. Also referred to as &quot;Little Poland&quot;, the city&#x27;s Broad Street neighborhood has been home to a considerable number of Polish businesses and families since 1890. On September 23, 2008, through the urging of the Polonia Business Association, the New Britain City Council unanimously passed a resolution officially designating New Britain&#x27;s Broad Street area as &quot;Little Poland.&quot; In recent years, the Polish community has been credited with revitalizing the area both culturally and economically. Media is served by three Polish language newspapers and a television station, and many businesses and civil agencies are bilingual. The post office branch in Little Poland is the only one in the nation with the word &quot;post&quot; written in Polish to welcome visitors. Each year, a Little Poland festival is held on a Sunday in the spring.

Notable visitors to the Polish district have included Presidents Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan on July 8, 1987. In 1969, as then-Cardinal Karol Wojtyła, the future Pope John Paul II gave a mass at Sacred Heart Church. A statue was erected in his honor in 2007. Dubbed the city&#x27;s &quot;Polish heart&quot; by &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, Little Poland caught the attention of Polish Ambassador to the US Ryszard Schnepf, who toured the area with US Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal, US Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty, as well as several members of the Polish Sejm.
An honorary Polish consulate was established in March 2017. The first of its kind in Connecticut, it was established by Polish diplomat to the United States Piotr Wilczek.

In September 2019, Polish President Andrzej Duda became the first head of state to visit New Britain when he addressed thousands in Walnut Hill Park prior to traveling to New York City for the United Nations General Assembly. Duda was joined by a variety of Connecticut politicians, including Governor Ned Lamont, U.S. Representative Jahana Hayes and Senators Chris Murphy and Richard Blumenthal.

==Accent==
Natives of New Britain have a fairly unmarked Connecticut accent, though there is some local perception of a distinct accent, popularly attributed to the Polish-American community, such as the use of a glottal stop in place of before syllabic : in other words, in words like &quot;cattle&quot; and &quot;bottle&quot;. The short &quot;a&quot; vowel as in may be raised to for some speakers in Connecticut, including New Britain, though this feature appears to be declining among younger residents.

==Economy==

New Britain is home to the global headquarters of the Fortune 500 manufacturing conglomerate Stanley Black &amp; Decker. Other notable companies headquartered in New Britain include Gaffney, Bennett and Associates, Tomasso Group, Creed Monarch, Guida&#x27;s Dairy, and Polamer Precision.

<text>Newington is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. Located south of downtown Hartford, Newington is an older, mainly residential suburb located in Greater Hartford. As of 2023, the population is 30,527. The Connecticut Department of Transportation has its headquarters in Newington.

Newington is home to Mill Pond Falls, near the center of town. It is celebrated each fall during the Waterfall Festival.

The American Radio Relay League is headquartered in Newington, with a call sign of W1AW.

==History==
Newington has a history of nearly 375 years. While not established officially as a separate town until 1871, settlers from nearby Wethersfield took up residence on the western frontier of their riverside town in 1636. &quot;West Society,&quot; as some called it, was an area rich in timber that was used for pipe staves, barrel-sized containers used for colonial trade. Grand pastures also made the land ideal for herding and grazing cattle. Its inhabitants received land grants from Wethersfield leaders. Known as &quot;West Farms,&quot; the area west of the central portion of Wethersfield became settled by those who were almost exclusively the descendants of the earliest Wethersfield settlers. In 1721, the &quot;western&quot; farmers requested that the General Assembly of the Connecticut Colony give their land the name &quot;Newington&quot; to denote &quot;the new town in the meadow.&quot; The Assembly granted the request, even though it took another 150 years before Newington officially became an incorporated town. The town&#x27;s name predates its official existence.

Newington&#x27;s motto inscribed on its town seal is &quot;growth and progress,&quot; which it began putting into effect at the end of the eighteenth century. In 1798, the precursor to the Berlin Turnpike was authorized and it changed the complexion of the land by dividing the vast farmlands from the commercial center. Originally called the Hartford and New Haven Turnpike, the route attracted a number of businesses from north to south between Hartford and New Haven.

The town came into its own at the start of the nineteenth century. Its location in the center of Connecticut attracted an increasing number of residents and commercial enterprises. Veteran of the War of 1812 Levi Lusk established one of the first businesses on the Turnpike, a tavern that stood as a precursor to the many motels, bars, stores, and restaurants that would come later. Railroads passed through Newington as early as the 1830s, which accelerated residential and commercial expansion. More homes were built and businesses established as the nineteenth century unfolded.

Newington grew in population and area by the second half of the nineteenth century. Wethersfield had done likewise, and two population centers were produced as a result. One centered on Wethersfield&#x27;s inner village still closely tied to the Connecticut River; the other in Newington had developed its own identity distinct from its mother town.

An 1869 map of Newington shows that the town was divided into four districts—the North, the Middle, the South, and the South-east—that ran from east to west. From north to south, four main roads traversed the four districts starting from the West Hartford line extending all the way to the Berlin line to the south. Later the roads would be called the Berlin Turnpike, Main Street, Willard Avenue, and Church Street. The town extended four miles in a north-south direction and three miles in an east-west direction.

===Incorporation and the Modern Era===
In 1871, Newington had a population of 871 people with 132 dwellings, and roughly 130 farms, a substantial increase from the start of the nineteenth century. When Wethersfield town leaders refused to fund highway improvements for better access to the railroads, the town formally declared its independence on July 10.

Newington&#x27;s incorporation coincided with the emergence of the modern era. John Fish&#x27;s Store, in the center of town off Willard Street (later Willard Avenue), got the town&#x27;s first telephone in 1883. The trolley began service in Newington in 1894 and connected Hartford and New Britain. The ride from Newington to the city took 20 minutes and cost five cents. Not only did residents marvel at the invention, but took note of its revolutionizing force; it was now possible to live in Newington and to work in surrounding cities. Farms still comprised the bulk of Newington land, but the road to the world of suburbia was being paved.

The trolley spurred more population growth. Newington had only 1,000 people living in it at the start of the twentieth century, but the number reached 4,000 by 1930. At first, Anglos moved to the town from Hartford and New Britain as foreign-born Poles, Italians, and Irish settled in those cities.

Automobiles, the most visible sign of technological progress, encouraged more immigration and did away with many farms. In the 1930s, Newington&#x27;s political leaders facilitated this change by paving dirt roads, despite the Great Depression which ground much business activity to a halt. Cars as well as the bus system replaced the trolley service in 1937.

Modernization, to Newington, meant more than just trolleys, automobiles, and buses. Using government as an instrument of social improvement, in the spirit of the Progressives, reflected advancement in the early decades of the twentieth century. In 1898 Newington&#x27;s Virginia Thrall Smith had appealed to the town&#x27;s political leaders to build an asylum in Newington for the purpose of caring for neglected children. Overwhelmingly the town approved the request after Smith purchased land at the foot of Cedar Mountain in the town&#x27;s eastern portion. Initially, it had been called the Home for Incurables, but in 1968 would be renamed The Newington Children&#x27;s Hospital. Three other hospitals were built in town in the early twentieth century contemporaneous with the rise of Progressivism, including the 1911 establishment of Connecticut&#x27;s first tuberculosis sanitarium on Cedar Mountain.

By the 1940s, Newington experienced the same level of expansion and population growth that other towns around the state had. The Hartford/New Haven Turnpike was renamed the Berlin Turnpike in 1942, and the road was widened from to the same year, a clear indication that this part of Newington had become vital to the town&#x27;s commercial life. Mill Pond, in the western part of town, remained an attraction for residents; its 16-foot natural waterfall remains the smallest in the United States, and is depicted on the town seal. But the lifeblood of the community by mid century had shifted away from the area and toward the Turnpike, now known as &quot;gasoline alley&quot; because of the vast number of gas stations there.

Newington&#x27;s population grew from 5,449 in 1940 to 9,110 in 1950. Along with North Haven, this increase constituted the fastest in the state. By the last decades of the twentieth century, the town&#x27;s manufacturing base had begun to face dramatic challenges. Newington became the victim of the dwindling defense industry, while at the same time its own businesses such as the Torrington Company, a manufacturer of automobile parts, solvents, and surgical staplers and Loctite, a specialty adhesives maker, left town in the mid-1990s. The building of Interstate 91 and Interstate 84 earlier in the century had affected Newington businesses adversely by making other cities and towns more attractive to industry and but for the success of shopping centers, condominium development, and the continued commercial activity of the Berlin Turnpike, Newington might have seen a sharper economic decline as the twentieth century came to an end.

Newington&#x27;s population had increased to 29,701 in 2009 and was projected to surpass 30,000 by 2013. The town remained mostly residential with the exception of the Berlin Turnpike, which witnessed a renewed proliferation of commercial enterprises. Reflecting the conspicuous nature of technological advancement, the Turnpike, by the start of the new century, saw the replacement of small businesses with new and larger chain stores.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of . None of the area is covered with water, except for two small ponds, found in the town&#x27;s largest parks, and various small streams. The town of Newington is bordered by the capital city of Hartford to the north, as well as the suburbs of (clockwise from Hartford) Wethersfield, Rocky Hill, Berlin, New Britain, Farmington, and West Hartford. The town consists mostly of residential areas, although it is also home to the Berlin Turnpike, a large, commercial highway.

==Arts and culture==
===Mill Pond Falls===
The town seal depicts Mill Pond Falls, named for a sawmill that was built there in 1860. The high falls, located in central Newington at Mill Pond Park, is the smallest natural waterfall in the country. A walking path that encircles Mill Pond includes a footbridge which crosses over the waterfall. There is also an observation area with benches at the base of the falls. The park is popular with local residents as a place to walk dogs, ice skate, jog, and picnic; it also hosts the occasional wedding party and festivals. It is open year-round.

Starting in 2000, the Newington Waterfall Committee has celebrated the famed waterfall through the Waterfall Festival, held every September in the center of town. The festival features over 72 vendors and local music groups, as well as the &quot;Artist&#x27;s Chalk Walk&quot; in which artists of all ages compete to create the best chalk drawing while passersby attend the festival. On April 17, 2010, the Newington Waterfall Committee agreed to plant a Crimson Maple dubbed the &quot;Thankful Tree&quot; at the falls, giving Newington residents the chance to write on tags what they are thankful for.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
==== Railroad ====
Although Amtrak does not currently serve Newington directly, the town center is located approximately south of Hartford&#x27;s Union Station. Additionally, Newington is a planned stop along the Hartford Line, a proposed commuter rail service from New Haven to Springfield that will use existing tracks, with a possible shuttle bus connection in Windsor Locks for Bradley International Airport. As of December 2015, funding has been secured to finance the construction of the new line, with service scheduled to begin in early 2018. The State of Connecticut has secured funding for restoration of the Newington Junction Railroad Depot, a passenger rail station located off Willard Avenue (CT-173) in the Newington Junction neighborhood. Although the first train station was built on the site in 1850, rail service was discontinued in 1959.

====Bus rapid transit====
In March 2015, CTfastrak, Connecticut&#x27;s first bus rapid transit corridor opened, providing a separated right-of-way between Hartford and New Britain with a stop at Newington Junction. The station consists of two side platforms serving the busway, with two center passing lanes to allow express buses to pass buses stopped at the station. It opened with the line on March 28, 2015.

====Buses====
Newington is served by a few bus routes operated by Connecticut Transit, including the 69, 41, 47 and 45. Additionally, the 907 Newington Express provides express service to downtown Hartford.

===Emergency services===
Newington is served by the Connecticut State Police, the local municipal police, and the United States Department of Veterans&#x27; Affairs Police Department. The municipal police department consists of 52 full-time sworn officers, who also act as the town&#x27;s first responders for medical emergencies. All officers have gone through first responder training once more to implement the use of new automatic external defibrillators that will be carried in their vehicles.

The town has an incorporated volunteer ambulance service, that provides basic life support and transport services Monday through Friday from 6:00 pm – 6:00 am and weekends 24 hours. Advanced life support and transport during all other times is provided by American Medical Response. With this system the taxpayers get charged one bill sent by the volunteer ambulance with the Advance Life Support charge included. This system is used by several surrounding towns in the Greater Hartford Area.

The town is served by a fire department that is 100% volunteer and was founded in 1917. Besides the school system, it is the only part of town government that is not under the control of the Town Council or Town Manager. The volunteer fire department is run by an elected board of three fire commissioners, which appoints the fire marshal, the chief, and all officers. A study was undertaken during the administration of former town manager Paul Fetherston that recommended eliminating the board of fire commissioners and placing the department under the control of the town manager. During the 2008 round of Charter Revision, both the immediate past mayor (Mortenson) and current town manager (Salomone) brought up the topic of the fire services organizational structure.

<text>West Hartford is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States, west of downtown Hartford. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 64,083 at the 2020 census.

The town&#x27;s popular downtown area is colloquially known as &quot;West Hartford Center,&quot; or simply &quot;The Center,&quot; and is centered on Farmington Avenue and South/North Main Street. West Hartford Center has been the community&#x27;s main commercial hub since the late 17th century.

Incorporated as a town in 1854, West Hartford was previously a parish of Hartford, founded in 1672. Among the southernmost of the communities in the Hartford-Springfield Knowledge Corridor metropolitan region, West Hartford is home to University of Hartford and the University of Saint Joseph.

West Hartford is home to regular events which draw large crowds from neighboring towns, including the Elizabeth Park Concert Series, and the annual Celebrate West Hartford event, which includes fairground rides, food vendors, musical performances, and stalls by local businesses.

==History==
According to archaeological evidence, the Wampanoag people used West Hartford as one of their winter camps. Fishing and hunting along the Connecticut River, the area of West Hartford offered the Wampanoag people a refuge from the cold winter wind and the river&#x27;s severe spring flooding. In 1636 Reverend Thomas Hooker led a group of followers from what is now Cambridge, Massachusetts to the &quot;Great River&quot; and established Hartford, Connecticut and the Connecticut Colony. As the colony grew, additional land was needed. In 1672 the Proprietors of Hartford ordered that a Division be created to the West. A total of &quot;72 Long Lots&quot; were laid out between today&#x27;s Quaker Lane in the East and Mountain Road in the West. The northern boundary was Bloomfield, and the Southern, present day New Britain Avenue. (The western boundary was extended in 1830 to include part of Farmington). In the 1670s, the area was referred to as the &quot;West Division&quot; of Hartford. This remained the official name until 1806 when Connecticut General Assembly started referring to it as &quot;the Society of West Hartford.&quot;

It is believed that the first homesteader to West Hartford was Stephen Hosmer whose father was in Hooker&#x27;s first group of Hartford settlers and who later owned just north of the present day Center. In 1679, Stephen Hosmer&#x27;s father sent him to establish a sawmill on the property. Young Hosmer would eventually go back to live in Hartford, but in his 1693 estate inventory, in West Hartford along with a house and a sawmill are listed. For nearly a century the property would be handed down throughout the family. Evidence still remains of the Town&#x27;s first industry, as Stephen Hosmer&#x27;s mill pond and dam can still be found today on the westernmost side of North Main Street.

By the time of the American Revolution, the once rugged wilderness had been largely clear and a new agricultural-based community had developed with a population of just over 1,000 residents and 3,000 sheep. At its core was the parish meeting house. The First Congregational Meeting House was built around 1712. Now in its 5th building, the church stands proudly at what is now the southeast corner of Main Street and Farmington Avenue. As the focus of early religious, political, and social life, the meeting house helped to provide this area with a name, a title that it still holds today—&quot;The Center.&quot;

Evidence in the Hartford Courant and in the 1790s census show that some of the more prosperous households relied on laborers and slaves for fieldwork and domestic help. The Sarah Whitman Hooker House was one such residence and still stands on New Britain Avenue. Evidence shows that the Hookers owned several slaves. One such slave, Bristow, bought his freedom from Thomas Hart Hooker in April 1775 as Hooker set off to fight in the Revolutionary War. Bristow continued to live with the family after Thomas Hart Hooker was killed in the war. Bristow became an agricultural expert and left his property to the Hookers&#x27; two children when he died. He is the only known African American to be buried in West Hartford&#x27;s Old Center Burial Yard. West Hartford&#x27;s Bristow Middle School is named in his honor.

===Coming of industry===

One of the first major industries to arise centered on the pottery and brick works. Extending from Hartford to Berlin is a sizable deposit of fine clay. In 1770, Ebenezer Faxon came from Massachusetts and settled in what would become the Elmwood section of West Hartford. There he established a pottery on South Road (what is today New Britain Avenue) which took advantage of the local geological landscape. It was Seth Goodwin, however, who helped to establish a pottery dynasty. Goodwin started his pottery works around 1798. For over a hundred years, the Goodwin name would be associated with West Hartford pottery. Producing utilitarian items such as jugs for the gin manufactured in local distilleries, to terra cotta designs and fine china, the Goodwin Company employed up to 75 people in its heyday. The Goodwin Brothers Pottery Company (as it came to be known) burned for the third time in 1908 and never recovered.

In 1879 Edwin Arnold established the Trout Brook Ice &amp; Feed Company. Ice from Trout Brook, a stream that runs through the middle of West Hartford, was harvested in the winter, sawn into blocks, and placed into a series of ice houses through an escalator system. Insulated in sawdust, the blocks of ice were used as refrigeration locally and shipped as far away as New York City. By the late 19th century, the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad ran through part of Elmwood in the southeast corner of town. A variety of companies cropped up in this area including Whitlock Coil Pipe Company in 1891, and later Royal Typewriter, Wiremold, Abbot Ball, Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing and Uncle Bill&#x27;s Silver Grippers (producer of tweezers). The largest of West Hartford manufacturers was Pratt &amp; Whitney (now Pratt &amp; Whitney Measurement Systems, which later lent its name to Pratt &amp; Whitney, the aerospace corporation headquartered in East Hartford). In 1940 it built a plant on and at the height of World War II it employed over 7,000 people. It would stand until 1991, when Pratt &amp; Whitney Measurement Systems was acquired and operations were relocated to Plainville.

===A new town===

In 1792 a committee of residents was appointed to ask permission from Hartford to secede, and were denied. Five years later they petitioned again and again were denied. In the spring of 1854, the Connecticut General Assembly was meeting in New Haven (co-capitol with Hartford at the time). Most likely taking advantage of the distance from Hartford, a petition dated March 21 was delivered to the General Assembly by delegates from West Hartford. Signed by 153 residents, the petition claimed that residences were &quot;subjected to many inconveniences on account of their present connection with the town and city of Hartford and that their convenience and prosperity would be essentially promoted by being set off as a separate town.&quot; On April 26, about 100 residents from West Hartford presented their own case against secession. After review and an opportunity for Hartford to make an argument for keeping West Hartford, the General Assembly voted on May 3 for West Hartford&#x27;s independence.

The 1854 vote was not however the end of the debate. In 1895 wealthy residents from the &quot;East Side&quot; of West Hartford petitioned Hartford for annexation. Their call was rebuffed by other West Hartford residents. Then in 1923 and 1924 Hartford wanted to annex West Hartford back so that it could achieve a &quot;Greater Hartford Plan.&quot; Town residents rallied in opposition and the plan was defeated by a vote of 2,100 to 6137.

===Emergence as a streetcar suburb===

It is transportation that has had the biggest impact on West Hartford and its evolution from sleepy crossroads to modern suburb. In the late 18th and early 19th century three turnpikes ran through West Hartford. Around these roads, taverns, blacksmith and wheelwright shops, general stores and many other places of businesses sprang up. Early maps provide a sense of how important these byways were in the development of commerce and industry. Then came the trolleys—starting in 1845, Fred Brace began running a horse-drawn omnibus from his home on the corner of Farmington Avenue and Dale Street into downtown Hartford. Even more significant were the horse-drawn trolley lines and later electric trolleys that in 1889 began to weave their way from the inner city of Hartford to the countryside of West Hartford. Trolley lines opened up a land that had been inaccessible to many, and made it possible for professionals and their families to settle along Prospect Avenue, then north of Farmington Avenue.

By the 1880s, Hartford began to experience an economic boom. As such Hartford&#x27;s business leaders began building their mansions along Prospect Avenue. Prospect Hill, situated on a ridge boasting impressive views of the burgeoning city, became the area&#x27;s most prestigious address. Homes are characteristic of the architectural styles popular in that period are represented, particularly Late 19th and 20th Century Revivals. Many homes in the area on the National Register of Historic Places, including the Connecticut Governor&#x27;s Residence, built in 1908. Prospect Avenue is adjacent to Elizabeth Park, designed by acclaimed landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted in 1896 and named for the wife of Charles M. Pond, who bequeathed the land to the City of Hartford. In 1900, the Hartford Golf Club opened its links on the other side of Asylum Avenue just west of Prospect Avenue, adding to the area&#x27;s ideal suburban sensibility.

In 1895, Wood, Harmon and Company created one of the town&#x27;s first subdivisions on property known as Stanley Farm, a tract sloping upward from the trolley line that then ran along Farmington Avenue, across from Reservoir No. 1. Called Buena Vista, it was promoted it &quot;Hartford&#x27;s New and Handsome Suburb.&quot; Their literature highlighted &quot;splendid suburban electric car service&quot; and proximity to Reservoir No. 1.

Other developments followed including &quot;Elmhurst&quot; in Elmwood (1901), and Sunset Farm (1917). One of the most exclusive of these early developments was West Hill. Located on the former estate of Cornelius Vanderbilt, son of the famous financier and transportation magnet, it was the brainchild of Horace R. Grant. Designed by some of Hartford&#x27;s best architects in the 1920s, West Hill is significant historically because it is an excellent example of a planned real estate development of the early 1920s that proceeded under specific design restrictions to achieve outstanding success as a well-crafted and prestigious neighborhood. The architecture is characteristic of the Colonial Revival and Tudor Revival styles popular in the period. It was declared a National Historic District in 1996.

===The automobile===

By the 1920s and 1930s the impact of the automobile was felt in West Hartford as the town became more accessible to Hartford&#x27;s middle and working class citizens. Between 1910 and 1930 the population of West Hartford grew from 4,808 to 24,941 residents. Then with the end of the Great Depression, World War II, and the exodus from urban centers, West Hartford witnessed a tremendous influx of people as its population swelled from 33,776 in 1940 to 62,382 people by 1960. This era ushered in major housing developments and retail spaces throughout the community.

In the 1950s, the primary avenues—Albany, Asylum and Farmington—became important arteries for commuters, and the access made West Hartford attractive to middle-class families. During the decade, the town built one new elementary school each year to accommodate the growing population. In the 1960s, construction began on Interstate 84, completed in 1969. The interstate had many ramifications on the community, the most visible was that it bisected the town, isolating the more industrial and ethnically diverse neighborhood of Elmwood with a physical barrier from the rest of West Hartford. Furthermore, The interstate allowed for increased accessibility as the population increased with the Baby Boom and development, and recalibrated the traditional retail sites.

Subsequent residential development continued on through the late 1970s, particularly in the town&#x27;s northern, western and far southwestern fringes, as evidenced by the many large colonial, ranch, and split level-style homes in these areas. In 1971, the Bishops Corner development was inaugurated. Housing tenants such as Lord &amp; Taylor, F.W. Woolworth, and Doubleday Book Shop drew shoppers from across the region; the Center with its largely independently owned stores, were negatively impacted by the new retail traffic patterns.

Towards the town&#x27;s southwest fringe lies Westfarms Mall. Opened in 1974 with original anchors JC Penney, G. Fox &amp; Co., and Sage-Allen, the mall further recalibrated retail in West Hartford. It became well known for its lavish ceilings and waterfall-style fountain. Sitting astride I-84, conveniently connected to the town&#x27;s main internal arteries, and comprising more than of stores and restaurants, it is the third largest indoor mall in Connecticut.

===Zoning and segregation===
In 1924, West Hartford became the first municipality in Connecticut to enact zoning, setting a precedent for other municipalities. The zoning legislation economically segregated residential areas by keeping expensive single-family homes away from multi-family housing, and preventing multi-family housing in single-family neighborhoods. West Hartford justified the zoning as intended to raise property values and keep undesirable groups out of the locality. The impetus for the zoning change was the failure of West Hartford leaders to prevent a Jewish grocery from setting up a grocery store in a West Hartford residential area a few years prior.

Alongside zoning, neighborhoods in West Hartford used racial covenants that prevented non-whites from owning or occupying buildings (until they were ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in 1948). In the 1960s and 1970s, real estate agents engaged in racial steering to keep black people out of West Hartford. These policies have contributed to making West Hartford overwhelmingly white.

In recent years, attempts at building multi-family housing in West Hartford have been met with protests from residents.

===Heist===
In 1983, a robbery was committed by a militant Puerto Rican group called &quot;Los Macheteros&quot; where they robbed a Wells Fargo depot situated in West Hartford, netting $7 million. At the time, it was the largest heist in US history.

=== Blue Back Square ===

Opening in 2007, Blue Back Square is a pioneer mixed-use development in the Center that blends retail and residential living space on a large scale. The five-building complex contains of ground floor retail space and 120 luxury space. Medical office space encompasses , and other professional offices total another square feet. A six-screen movie theatre as well as two 500-space parking garages were also built. Named after Noah Webster&#x27;s popular spelling book, Blue-Back Speller, the development has significantly altered the Center and furthered West Hartford&#x27;s status as a regional dining and shopping destination.

==Geography==

The west side of West Hartford is flanked by the Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to nearly the Vermont border. Notable features of the Metacomet Ridge in West Hartford include Talcott Mountain and a number of highland water reservoirs belonging to the Metropolitan District, which maintains watershed and recreation resources on the property. The Metacomet Trail traverses the ridge. The town&#x27;s web site indicates that the highest point in town is above sea level on Talcott (Avon) Mountain. The altitude at Town Hall is .

==Government==

West Hartford has had council–manager government since 1919. It was the first town in the state and one of the first in the country to adopt this form of government, where the council acts as the elected policy board and the town manager serves as the chief executive officer responsible for carrying policies out. In 1921, voters switched to elections by the single transferable vote, using it for two elections, before the General Assembly overturned it in 1923. Town Council members are elected at large for two years and represent all of West Hartford, and the town clerk is elected for four years. Appointed by the Town Council in 2022, Rick Ledwith is the Town Manager.

Connecticut municipalities—as with neighboring Massachusetts and Rhode Island—provide nearly all local services (i.e. fire and rescue, education, snow removal, etc.), as county government has been abolished since 1960.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

====Railroad====

West Hartford is a planned stop along the Hartford Line, a commuter rail service from to that uses the current Amtrak-owned New Haven–Springfield Line, with a possible shuttle bus connection in to Bradley International Airport. Service launched on June 16, 2018. The State of Connecticut has secured funding for the construction of a new train station at Flatbush Avenue at the corner of New Park Avenue. In 2019 Governor Lamont&#x27;s CT2030 transportation investment plan, which included tolling cars and trucks in 14 locations, was soundly rejected by Republicans and Democrats, leaving less funding for rail projects. Currently there is not enough funding to build a rail station in West Hartford.

====Bus====

West Hartford is served by several bus routes of Connecticut Transit. Major roads served are Albany Avenue (Route 58), New Britain Avenue (Routes 37, 39, and 128), Park Street (Routes 31 and 33), South/North Main Street (Route 153) Farmington Avenue (Routes 60, 62, 64, and 66), Asylum Avenue (Route 72), Hillside Avenue (Route 63), and Boulevard/South Quaker Lane (Route 69).

====Bus rapid transit====

==Education==
===Public schools===

The town is home to two public high schools, Conard (home of the Conard Red Wolves) and Hall (home of the Hall Titans), as well as 11 elementary schools and three middle schools in the West Hartford Public Schools system. The elementary schools are Aiken, Braeburn, Bugbee, Charter Oak, Duffy, Morley, Norfeldt, Smith, Webster Hill, Whiting Lane and Wolcott. The middle schools are King Philip, Sedgwick, and the newest, Bristow Middle School, on the former site of Kingswood-Oxford Middle School. The elementary schools are evenly distributed to either King Philip or Sedgwick, and those who enroll at Bristow are chosen by lottery. After middle school, students continue on to high school with their same student body. Sedgwick&#x27;s graduates go to Conard High School, and King Philip&#x27;s go to Hall. Bristow students return to the school district they were in during elementary school. The two high schools hold many events and recognize the tension between the two high schools.

==== Rivalry ====
As of 2020, both of West Hartford&#x27;s public high schools, Hall and Conard were ranked in the top 15 in the state and top 5% nationally according to &quot;U.S. News&quot;. The schools have been neck and neck in competing in educational aspects, but especially in sports. Hall versus Conard sports rivalry has gone on since the beginning of 1957, when their first football game against each other was held. The competition and school spirit is just as alive today, if not, more extreme than it was over 60 years ago. On February 23, 2015, the rivalry went too far when a fight occurred between both teams at the varsity basketball game held at Hall High School. The score of the game was 43–42 and teammates began fighting after a minor issue happened with the buzzer beater. As the entire Hall team stormed the court to celebrate, students began throwing punches at each other and eventually the entire team and coaches were stuck in the middle of a brawl. The fight was recorded entirely for the town to see online and identify which students were at fault, which led to 10 students being arrested. The Hall-Conard fan section was packed per usual and bleachers were filled to capacity as seen in multiple video recordings.
