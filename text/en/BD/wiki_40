<text>The Royal Conservatoire (, KC) is a conservatoire in The Hague, providing higher education in music and dance. The conservatoire was founded by King William I in 1826, making it the oldest conservatoire in the Netherlands. Since September 2021, the KC is housed in the &quot;Amare&quot; building in the centre of the Hague, together with the Residentie Orkest and the Nederlands Dans Theater (NDT).

== Education ==
The Bachelor Music course offers a range of study options. The starting point is an individual curriculum in the fields of Classical Music, Early Music, Singing/Vocal, Jazz, Composition, Sonology, Art of Sound and Music Education. The Master Music course at the Royal Conservatoire covers a spectrum from performing musicians (Classical, Early and Jazz), creative and researching musicians (Composition, Sonology, ArtScience). Unique about this Conservatoire is its dance department in which a Bachelor of Dance can be obtained. The three Master programmes at the Royal Conservatoire are Master of Music, Master of Sonology and Master of Opera. The Master in Opera is offered by the Dutch National Opera Academy, in association with the Conservatory of Amsterdam. In 1990 the &quot;Royal Conservatoire The Hague&quot; merged with the &quot;Royal Academy of Art The Hague&quot;, into the &#x27;School of Visual Arts, Music and Dance&#x27;. In 2010 the Dutch government elevated the joint institution to &quot;University of the Arts The Hague&quot;. The two do also still go by their original names as well, to underline their individual identities.

==Research==
Alongside education and production, research is one of the pillars of the Royal Conservatoire. The focus of research within the educational programmes is directed towards the artistic-musical and intellectual development of the students. In the Bachelor this involves the learning of basic research skills which a musician will require in their later music practice. These have relevance to the articulated ability to reflect on the musician’s own speciality. Research in the Master course is more specifically directed towards the conducting of a research project where the student specialises in their own field. Types of research in the Master can range widely, for instance the making of instruments, experimentation, historical interpretation (e.g. in function of performance practice), creative (artistic) research, cultural/critical reflection and/or research in the field of didactics or pedagogy. The topics are usually directly related to the main subject, and are of importance both for artistic and intellectual development of the student as for the development of the field of study.
After the Master course students can apply for participation in the doctoral programme for musicians and composers which is facilitated by the Academy of Creative and Performing Art at Leiden University. A research training programme is offered by DocARTES, the collaboration of the Royal Conservatoire, the Conservatory of Amsterdam, the universities of Leiden, Leuven and Antwerp, and the Orpheus Institute in Ghent. The final PhD defense takes place at Leiden University through the Academy of Creative and Performing Arts. Just like with the Master course, the student’s own artistic practice is the central element in the PhD course.

<text>Sonology is a neologism used to describe the study of sound in a variety of disciplines.

In medicine, the term is used in the field of [imaging] to describe the practice of medical ultrasonography. According to some scholars, sonology may represent a more advanced application of clinical sonography, chiefly due to the requirement for the use of critical application of both cognitive and radiographic skills in making the diagnostic determination at the time of bedside application of focused ultrasound.

The term is also used to describe interdisciplinary research in the field of electronic music and computer music, drawing upon disciplines such as acoustics, electronics, informatics, composition and psychoacoustics. This sense of the term is widely associated with the Institute of Sonology, which was established by composer Gottfried Michael Koenig at the University of Utrecht in 1967 and later moved to the Royal Conservatory of The Hague in 1986. The term has also been adopted to describe the study of electronic music at other institutions, including the Center for Computational Sonology (now &quot;Sound and Music Computing&quot;) at the University of Padua, Kunitachi College of Music in Tokyo, at the Catalonia College of Music in Barcelona and the Federal University of Minas Gerais in Brazil.

<text>A constitutional amendment (or constitutional alteration) is a modification of the constitution of a polity, organization or other type of entity. Amendments are often interwoven into the relevant sections of an existing constitution, directly altering the text. Conversely, they can be appended to the constitution as supplemental additions (s), thus changing the frame of government without altering the existing text of the document.

Most constitutions require that amendments cannot be enacted unless they have passed a special procedure that is more stringent than that required of ordinary legislation. Examples of such special procedures include supermajorities in the legislature, or direct approval by the in a referendum, or even a combination of two or more different special procedures. A referendum to amend the constitution may also be triggered in some jurisdictions by popular initiative.

Australia and Ireland provide examples of constitutions requiring that all amendments are first passed by the legislature before being submitted to the people; in the case of Ireland, a simple majority of those voting at the electorate is all that is required, whereas a more complex set of criteria must be met in Australia (a majority of voters in a majority of states is also necessary). Switzerland has procedure similar to that of Australia.

The special procedures for the amendment of some constitutions have proven to be so exacting, that of proposed amendments either few (eight Amendments out of 44 proposed in Australia), or none (as in Japan) have been passed over a period of several decades. In contrast, the former constitution of the U.S. state of Alabama was amended 977 times between its adoption in 1901 and its replacement by the current constitution in 2022.
==Form of changes to the text==
There are a number of formal differences, from one jurisdiction to another, in the manner in which constitutional amendments are both originally drafted and written down once they become law. In some jurisdictions, such as Ireland, Estonia, and Australia, constitutional amendments originate as bills and become laws in the form of acts of parliament. This may be the case notwithstanding the fact that a special procedure is required to bring an amendment into force. Thus, for example, in Ireland and Australia although amendments are drafted in the form of Acts of Parliament they cannot become law until they have been approved in a referendum. By contrast, in the United States a proposed amendment originates as a special joint resolution of Congress that does not require the President to sign and that the President can not veto.

The manner in which constitutional amendments are finally recorded takes two main forms. In most jurisdictions, amendments to a constitution take the form of revisions to the previous text. Thus, once an amendment has become law, portions of the original text may be deleted or new articles may be inserted among existing ones. The second, less common method, is for amendments to be appended to the end of the main text in the form of special &quot;articles of amendment&quot;, leaving the body of the original text intact. Although the wording of the original text is not altered, the doctrine of implied repeal applies. In other words, in the event of conflict, an article of amendment will usually take precedence over the provisions of the original text, or of an earlier amendment. Nonetheless, there may still be ambiguity whether an amendment is intended to supersede or to supplement an existing article in the text.

An article of amendment may, however, explicitly express itself as having the effect of repealing a specific existing article. The use of appended articles of amendment is most famous as a feature of the United States Constitution, but it is also the method of amendment in a number of other jurisdictions, such as Venezuela.

Under the 1919 German Weimar Constitution, the prevailing legal theory was that any law reaching the necessary supermajorities in both chambers of parliament was free to deviate from the terms of the constitution, without itself becoming part of the constitution. This very wide conception of &quot;amendment&quot; eased the rise of Adolf Hitler to power; it was consequently explicitly ruled out in the postwar 1949 constitution, which allows amendments only by explicitly changing the constitution&#x27;s text.

== Summary of methods ==
==Africa==

===Ethiopia===
The Constitution of Ethiopia can only be modified by a two-thirds majority of the country&#x27;s regions, and a two-thirds majority of a joint session of the Federal Parliamentary Assembly in accordance with Article 105. The constitution&#x27;s Chapter Three (describing both Human and democratic rights) and the constitution&#x27;s Articles 104 and 105 are almost unamendable since they require the total consensus of the federal regional states and two-thirds of each house of Parliament. In Ethiopia&#x27;s federal experience, each regional state is equal and has the right to veto amendments to the aforementioned articles.

===South Africa===
The Constitution of South Africa can be amended by an Act of Parliament, but special procedures and requirements apply to the passage of constitutional amendments. A bill amending the Constitution must be introduced in the National Assembly, and cannot contain any provisions other than constitutional amendments and directly related matters.

At least 30 days before a constitutional amendment bill is introduced in the National Assembly, the person or committee introducing the amendment must publish it for public comment, submit it to the provincial legislatures, and, if it does not have to be passed by the National Council of Provinces (NCOP), submit it to the NCOP for debate. When the bill is introduced, the comments received must be tabled in the National Assembly, and in the NCOP when appropriate.

All amendments must be passed by an absolute two-thirds supermajority in the National Assembly (the lower house); as the Assembly has 400 members this requires 267 members to vote for the amendment. Most amendments do not have to be considered by the NCOP (the upper house). Amendments of the Bill of Rights, and amendments affecting the role of the NCOP, the &quot;boundaries, powers, functions or institutions&quot; of the provinces or provisions &quot;dealing specifically with provincial matters&quot; must also be passed by the NCOP with a supermajority of at least six of the nine provinces. If an amendment affects a specific province, it must also be approved by the legislature of the province concerned. Section 1, which defines South Africa as &quot;one, sovereign, democratic state&quot; and lists its founding values, is a specially entrenched clause and can only be amended by an absolute three-quarters supermajority in the National Assembly and six of the provinces in the NCOP.

Once an Act is passed by the National Assembly, and by the NCOP if necessary, it must be signed and assented to by the President. As with any other Act of Parliament, by default an amendment comes into effect when it is published in the &quot;Government Gazette&quot;, but the text of the amendment may specify some other date of commencement, or allow the President to specify one by notice in the &quot;Gazette&quot;.

==Americas==

===Brazil===
The Constitution of Brazil states various terms on how it can be amended. Article 60 lies within &quot;Section VIII: The Legislative Process, Subsection 2: Amendments to the Constitution&quot;. The following is detailed therein: 

Article 60 is the only article prescribed under Subsection 2 of Section 8 in the Brazilian constitution.

===United States===

==== Federal constitution ====
Article Five of the United States Constitution describes the process whereby the federal Constitution may be altered. Twenty-seven amendments have been added (appended as ) to the Constitution.

Amendment proposals may be adopted and sent to the states for ratification by either:
* A two-thirds (supermajority) vote of members present—if a quorum exists—in both the Senate and the House of Representatives of the United States Congress; or
* A majority vote of state delegations at a national convention called by Congress at the request of the legislatures of at least two-thirds (at present 34) of the states. (This method has never been used.)

All 33 amendment proposals that have been sent to the states for ratification since the establishment of the Constitution have come into being via the Congress. State legislatures have however, at various times, used their power to apply for a national convention in order to pressure Congress into proposing a desired amendment. For example, the movement to amend the Constitution to provide for the direct election of senators began to see such proposals regularly pass the House of Representatives only to die in the Senate from the early 1890s onward. As time went by, more and more state legislatures adopted resolutions demanding that a convention be called, thus pressuring the Senate to finally relent and approve what later became the Seventeenth Amendment for fear that such a convention—if permitted to assemble—might stray to include issues above and beyond just the direct election of senators.

To become an operative part of the Constitution, an amendment, whether proposed by Congress or a national constitutional convention, must be ratified by either:
* The legislatures of three-fourths (at present 38) of the states; or
* State ratifying conventions in three-fourths (at present 38) of the states.

Congress has specified the state legislature ratification method for all but one amendment. The ratifying convention method was used for the Twenty-first Amendment, which became part of the Constitution in 1933.

Since the turn of the 20th century, amendment proposals sent to the states for ratification have generally contained a seven-year ratification deadline, either in the body of the amendment or in the resolving clause of the joint resolution proposing it. The Constitution does not expressly provide for a deadline on the state legislatures&#x27; or state ratifying conventions&#x27; consideration of proposed amendments. In &quot;Dillon v. Gloss&quot; (1921), the Supreme Court affirmed that Congress—if it so desires—could provide a deadline for ratification. An amendment with an attached deadline that is not ratified by the required number of states within the set time period is considered &quot;inoperative&quot; and rendered moot.

A proposed amendment becomes an official Article of the Constitution immediately once it is ratified by three-fourths of the States. The Article usually goes into force at this time too, though it may self-impose a delay before that happens, as was the case of the Eighteenth Amendment. Every ratified Amendment has been certified or proclaimed by an official of the federal government, starting with the Secretary of State, then the Administrator of General Services, and now the Archivist of the United States, with the Archivist currently being responsible for certification under . The certification document usually contains a list of the States that ratified the Amendment. This certification is just used by the federal government to keep an official record and archive of the Amendment for its own purposes, and does not actually have any legal effect on the Amendment.

====State constitutions====
State constitutions in the U.S. are amended on a regular basis. In 19 states, the state constitutions have been amended at least 100 times.

Amendments are often necessary because of the length of state constitutions, which are, on average, three times longer than the federal constitution, and because state constitutions typically contain extensive detail. In addition, state constitutions are often easier to amend than the federal constitution.

Individual states differ in the difficulty of constitutional amendments. Some states allow for initiating the amendment process through the action of the state legislature or by popular initiative.

===== California =====

There are three methods for proposing an amendment to the California State Constitution: by the legislature, by constitutional convention, or by voter initiative. A proposed amendment must be approved by a majority of voters.

With the legislative method, a proposed amendment must be approved by an absolute supermajority of two-thirds of the membership of each house.

With the convention method, the legislature may, by a two-thirds absolute supermajority, submit to the voters at a general election the question whether to call a convention to revise the Constitution. If the majority of the voters vote yes on that question, within six months the Legislature shall provide for the convention. Delegates to a constitutional convention shall be voters elected from districts as nearly equal in population as may be practicable. The constitution does not provide any rules for the operation of the constitutional convention.

With the initiative method, an amendment is proposed by a petition signed by voters equal in number to 8% of the votes for all candidates for governor at the last gubernatorial election. The proposed amendment is then submitted to the voters at a general or special election.

===== New York =====
There are two methods of proposing amendments to the New York Constitution. All proposed amendments must be approved by a majority of voters in a referendum.

With the legislative method, an amendment proposal must be published for three months, then approved by an absolute majority of the members of each of the two houses, and approved again in a succeeding term of the houses, with an election intervening. Finally, the amendment proposal must be submitted to the people, and for ratification must be approved by a simple majority.

With the convention method, a constitutional convention must be convened by a majority vote of voters in a general election (referendum) on the question.

===== Tennessee =====
There are two methods for proposing amendments to the Tennessee State Constitution: through the legislature and by constitutional convention. Proposed amendments must be approved by a majority of voters in a referendum.

With the legislative method, the Tennessee General Assembly passes a resolution calling for an amendment and stating its wording. This must pass in three separate readings on three separate days, with an absolute majority on all readings. It does not require the governor&#x27;s approval. It must then be published at least six months before the next legislative election in newspapers of wide and general circulation. (This is done by precedent but is not required by law.) After the election, the proposed amendment must go through the same procedure (absolute majority on three separate readings). Then it is put on the ballot as a referendum in the next gubernatorial election. To be ratified it must again achieve an absolute majority of those voting in the gubernatorial election.

With the convention method, the legislature can put on any ballot the question of whether to call a constitutional convention. It must be stated whether the convention is limited or unlimited—that is, whether it can only amend the current constitution or totally abolish it and write a new one. If limited, the call must state which provisions of the current constitution are to be subject to amendment, and the subsequent convention, if approved, is limited to considering only amendments to the provisions specified in the call. The proposed amendments must then be submitted to the electorate and approved by a majority of those voting in the election. A constitutional convention cannot be held more frequently than once every six years.

===== Texas =====
The only method for proposing an amendment to the Texas State Constitution is through the legislature, either in regular or special session. The governor may call a special session, and specify the agenda for the session. To become part of the constitution, proposed amendments must be approved by a majority of voters in a referendum. Texas has had six different constitutions and the current constitution, adopted in 1876, has been amended 474 times.

A proposed amendment must be approved by an absolute supermajority of two-thirds of the elected membership of each house of the legislature. It is submitted to the voters in an election specified by the legislature. The wording of an explanatory statement that will appear on the ballot must be approved by the Texas Attorney General and printed in newspapers. The full text of the amendment must be posted by all county clerks for 30 days before the election.

===== Washington =====
The only method for proposing an amendment to the Washington State Constitution is through the legislature and can originate in either branch. The proposal must be approved by a two-thirds majority of the legislature. The proposed amendment is placed on the ballot at the next general election and must be approved by a majority of the voters.

==Asia and Oceania==

===Australia===

The procedure for amending the Constitution of Australia is detailed in section 128 of the Constitution. Firstly, a bill amending the Constitution must be passed by both houses of the Parliament of Australia by an absolute majority (at least 76 of the 151 members of the House of Representatives and at least 39 of the 76 members of the Senate). If one house passes the bill while the other refuses, it may attempt to pass the bill again. If the second house again refuses to pass it, the Governor-General (presumably on the advice of the Prime Minister) may still submit the proposed change for referendum.

Following this, Australians then vote on the proposal. For a referendum to succeed both of the following must be achieved

# A majority of states (New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania) must agree to the proposal.
# A majority of the combined votes of all of Australia must agree to the proposal.

The double majority is a major factor in why since 1906 out of 44 referendums only 8 have been successful.

=== China ===
In the Communist-ruled People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Constitution of the People&#x27;s Republic of China states how to be amended under Article 64 of &quot;Chapter III: The Structure of the State&quot;. It says the following: 
=== India ===
The Indian constitution can be amended in 3 ways:

# By Simple Majority of the Parliament
#* This method is used to amend those parts of the constitution outside the purview of Article 368 of the constitution.
#* It is used in amending the following provisions:
#** Formation of new states, alteration of boundaries of states, changing names of states and alteration of areas of states
#** Creation/Abolition of Legislative Councils in states
#** Changing salaries and allowances of judges of Supreme Court and High Court
#** Laws regarding citizenship
# Through procedure mentioned in Article 368 of the Constitution
#* This again is done in 2 ways -
#** By Special Majority of the Parliament
#*** Special majority implies :
#**** A majority of the &#x27;total membership&#x27; of the Parliament (i.e., each houses separately) and
#**** A majority of 2/3rd of members present and voting
#** By Special Majority of the Parliament and consent of states
#*** This requires
#**** Special majority in each house of the Parliament and
#**** Consent of half of the state legislatures
#*** This method is used for amending those provisions affecting states&#x27; interests. e.g.: Representation of states in Parliament, distribution of legislative powers between the union and states etc.

Since its commencement in 1950, Indian constitution has been amended 106 times, as of August 2021. Supreme Court in Kesavananda Bharati Case held that parliament&#x27;s power to amend is not unlimited, and it can not amend the basic structure of the constitution. The &#x27;basic structure&#x27; includes the supremacy of the Constitution, the rule of law, Independence of the judiciary, doctrine of separation of powers, federalism, secularism, sovereign democratic republic, the parliamentary system of government, the principle of free and fair elections, welfare state, etc.

===Indonesia===
The Constitution of Indonesia states that it can be amended corresponding to Article 37 of &quot;Chapter XVI: Constitutional Amendments&quot; within the document. Proposal to amend the constitution must submitted by one-thirds members of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly. Two-thirds of the members of the People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly must be present: any proposed amendment requires a simple majority of the entire People&#x27;s Consultative Assembly membership. The form of the unitary state cannot be changed.

===Japan===
The Constitution of Japan states that it can be amended corresponding to Article 96 of &quot;Chapter IX: Amendments&quot; within the document. It says the following: 

Japan has used this Constitution since Saturday, 3 May 1947. It was adopted and implemented as the most quintessential doctrine of Japanese governance following the Second World War and the Sino-Japanese war. As a result, in order to ensure that Japan would not be a source of future aggression, a special portion was written into the document in the form of &quot;Article 9: Renunciation of War&quot;. It describes as follows:

Even though these two paragraphs are not expressly protected by an eternity clause, many Japanese people argue that it needs to be interpreted as being irrevocable due to the significant and precise nature of the article.

===Philippines===
Under the common interpretation of the Constitution, amendments can be proposed by one of three methods: a People&#x27;s Initiative, a Constituent Assembly or a Constitutional Convention.

===Taiwan===
Article 174 of the Constitution of the Republic of China is codified with the law:
This was changed beginning in the 1990s and Article 12 of the constitutional amendments must be approved by Taiwan&#x27;s parliament and referendums voted by the citizens residing in the ROC free area.

===Turkey===
The Constitution of Turkey details, through Provisional Article 175 under &quot;I. Amending the Constitution, participation in elections and referenda&quot; of &quot;Part Seven: Final Provisions&quot; 



The Turkish constitution was adopted and implemented in 1982. , it had been amended 21 times. Every amendment which has been approved into the document was passed by the people through a constitutional referendum that occurred in 2017. This means that all twenty-one amendments were added at the same time. Due to the contents that it would exponentially extend presidential tenure as well as controversies about electoral misconduct, the referendum was intensely controversial. Global attention was drawn to it both before and after the results were finalized for the same reasons.

==Europe==

=== European Union ===
The Treaties of the European Union are a set of international treaties between member states that describe the constitutional basis of the European Union. Prior to the Treaty of Lisbon&#x27;s entry into force in 2009, there was only one procedure for the revision of the treaties on which the EU is based: the convening of an intergovernmental conference. Since 2009, Article 48 of the Treaty on European Union has laid down two procedures for the revision of the treaties.
* &quot;Ordinary revision:&quot; this relates to key changes in relation to the competences of the EU and requires the convening of an intergovernmental conference to adopt proposals for amendments by consensus. All EU countries have to ratify the treaty amendments for them to enter into force.
* &quot;Simplified revision:&quot; where the proposed amendments relate to the EU&#x27;s policies and its internal actions, the European Council unanimously adopts a decision on the amendments having consulted the commission, the Parliament and the European Central Bank (if the amendment concerns monetary matters). The new treaty provisions only enter into force following their ratification by all EU countries according to their own constitutional procedures.

===Albania===
The Constitution of Albania states its terms for being amending under Article 177 within &quot;Part 17: Amending The Constitution&quot;. 

 


Article 177 is the only article under this part of the Albanian constitution.

===Austria===
The Constitution of Austria is unusually liberal in terms of constitutional amendments. Any piece of parliamentary legislation can be designated as &quot;constitutional law&quot;, i.e., as a part of the constitution if the required supermajority and other formalities for an amendment are met. An amendment may take the form of a change of the &quot;Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz&quot;, the centerpiece of the constitution, a change to another constitutional act, a new constitutional act, or of a section of constitutional law in a non-constitutional act. Furthermore, international treaties can be enacted as constitutional law, as happened in the case of the European Convention of Human Rights. Over the decades, frequent amendments and, in some cases, the intention to immunize pieces of legislation from judicial review, have led to much &quot;constitutional garbage&quot; consisting of hundreds of constitutional provisions spread all over the legal system. This has led to calls for reform.

A majority of two-thirds in the National Council is all that is required for an amendment to take effect. Only in the case of a fundamental change (&quot;Gesamtänderung&quot;) of the constitution a confirmation by referendum is required. Since 1945, this has only happened once when Austria&#x27;s accession to the European Union was approved by popular vote.

If a constitutional amendment limits the powers of the states, a two-thirds majority in the Federal Council of Austria is required as well. Depending on the matter on hand, two-thirds of the Federal Councilors present (attendance of one-half of all Councilors is required), or two-thirds of all Federal Councilors must approve. If the amendment would change articles 34 or 35, the majority of councilors of at least four of the nine states is an additional requirement.

===Belgium===
The Constitution of Belgium can be amended by the federal legislative power, which consists of the King (in practice, the Federal Government) and the Federal Parliament. In order to amend the Constitution, the federal legislative power must declare the reasons to revise the Constitution in accordance with Article 195. This is done by means of two so-called Declarations of Revision of the Constitution, one adopted by the Chamber of Representatives and the Senate, and one signed by the King and the Federal Government.

Following this declaration, the Federal Parliament is automatically dissolved and a new federal election must take place. This makes it impossible to amend the Constitution unless an election has intervened. Following the election, the new Federal Parliament can amend those articles that have been declared revisable. Neither Chamber can consider amendments to the Constitution unless at least two-thirds of its members are present and the Constitution can only be amended if at least two-thirds of the votes cast are in favour of the amendment.

=== Bosnia and Herzegovina ===

In the Article X, defining the amendment procedure, the Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina states that it can be amended by a decision of the Parliamentary Assembly, including a two-thirds majority of those present and voting in the House of Representatives. The Constitution does not say who has the right, and under what rules, to present the amendments to the Parliamentary Assembly. Also, in the paragraph 2 of the Article X, the Constitution states that the rights and freedoms, as seen in the Article II, cannot be derogated, as well as the paragraph 2 itself.

The Constitution of Bosnia and Herzegovina was amended once, in 2009, to include the outcome of the Brcko District final award. Several constitutional reforms were attempted between 2006 and 2014, to ensure its compliance with the case law of the European Convention on Human Rights in the Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina and following cases (&quot;Zornic&quot;, &quot;Pilav&quot;) regarding ethnic- and residence-based discrimination in passive electoral rights for the Presidency and House of Peoples.

===Bulgaria===
Under the current Constitution of Bulgaria (1991), there are two procedures for amendment, depending on the part of the constitution to be amended:
* Normal amendment procedure (Articles 153–156): the Parliament can amend the Constitution for minor issues with a three-quarters majority, or two-thirds majority upon reintroduction in parliament after two months. This shall be done in three successive readings.
* Special amendment procedure (Articles 157–163): this procedure is the only way to revise the international borders of Bulgaria; change the form of government in the country; change the form in which the Constitution and international treaties are applied in Bulgaria (Article 5) or suspend citizens&#x27; rights. When such amendment is needed, the Constitution envisages an election for Great National Assembly, which consists of 400 deputies, with 200 elected by proportional vote and 200 elected by the first-past-the-post method. Then the amendments to the Constitution are passed by two-thirds majority in three successive readings.

===Czech Republic===
Passage of a constitutional act in the Czech Republic can only be accomplished through the agreement of three-fifths of all Deputies and Senators present at the time the proposed act is laid before each house of Parliament. It is the only type of legislation that does not require the signature of the President to become law. Furthermore, it is the only type of legislation the President cannot veto.

===Denmark===
The Constitution of Denmark provides an example of multiple special procedures that must be followed. After an amendment has been approved by parliament, a general election must be held; the new parliament must then approve the amendment again before it is finally submitted to a referendum. There is also a requirement that at least forty percent of eligible voters must vote at the referendum in order for an amendment to be validly passed.

===Estonia===
The Constitution of Estonia can only be modified by three-fifths majority in two successive complements of Parliament, and a referendum for certain chapters.

===Finland===
Amendments or revisions to the Constitution of Finland (including replacement) can be proposed by the Government or by any member of Parliament. These must first be approved by a majority of Parliament, and then after a parliamentary election by a two-thirds supermajority.

A proposal can be declared by a five-sixths supermajority of Parliament as “urgent,” after this it can be approved by two-thirds immediately – without an election. This second procedure is also used for emergency laws that temporarily deviate the Constitution.

===France===
Amendments to the Constitution of France must first be passed by both houses with identical terms, and then need approval either by a simple majority in a referendum or by a three-fifths majority of the two houses of the French parliament jointly convened in Congress.

===Germany===
The Federal Republic of Germany uses a basic law as its constitution. The Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany states its terms for amending under Article 79 of the document. 


The third paragraph was made by its framers to protect the country against a future totalitarian regime such as that of Nazi Germany. This is an example of the eternity clause in constitutional designing.

===Greece===
The Constitution of Greece is amendable through the terms which mentioned under Article 110 beneath &quot;Section II: Revision of the Constitution&quot; of &quot;Part Four: Special, Final, and Transitional Provisions&quot;.

===Ireland===
The Constitution of Ireland can only be modified by referendum, following proposal approved by the lower and upper houses of the Oireachtas, amongst citizens entitled to vote for the President. The amendment succeeds by simple majority, and no quorum is required.

===Italy===
Article 138 of the Constitution provides for the special procedure through which the Parliament can adopt constitutional laws (including laws to amend the Constitution of Italy). Constitutional laws start by following the ordinary legislative procedure, which requires both houses of parliament to approve the law in the same text, with a simple majority (i.e. the majority of votes cast). However, after having been approved for the first time, they need to be voted for by both houses a second time, which can happen no sooner than three months after the first. In this second reading, no new amendments to the bill may be proposed: the bill must be either approved or rejected in its entirety.

The constitutional law needs to be approved by at least a majority of MPs in each house (absolute majority) in its second reading. Depending on the results of this second vote, the constitutional law may then follow two different paths.
* If the bill is approved by a qualified majority of two-thirds of members in each house, it can be immediately promulgated by the President of the Republic and become law.
* If the bill is approved by a majority of members in each house, but not enough to reach the qualified majority of two-thirds, it does not immediately become law. Instead, it must be first be published in the Official Gazette (the official journal where all Italian laws are published). Within three months after its publication, a constitutional referendum may be requested by either 500,000 voters, five regional councils, or one-fifth of the members of a house of parliament. If no constitutional referendum has been requested after the three months have elapsed, the bill can be promulgated and becomes law. If a constitutional referendum is requested, in order to become law the bill must be approved by a majority of votes cast by the whole electorate. No quorum is required, meaning that the referendum turnout has no effect on its validity (unlike in other forms of referendums in Italy).
The form of republic may not be revised (art. 139 of the Constitution).

Only four constitutional referendums have ever been held in Italy: in 2001 and 2020 (in which the constitutional laws were approved), and in 2006 and 2016 (in which they were rejected).

===The Netherlands===
To change the Constitution of the Netherlands the legislature must pass a law by simple majority proposing to change the constitution (&quot;voorstelwet&quot;, lit. proposed law). The lower house must then be dissolved and after elections the proposal is considered again. To actually change the constitution the change must be passed by 2/3 majority in both houses of parliament.

===Poland===
The Constitution of Poland says the following under Article 235 of &quot;Chapter XII: Amending the Constitution&quot; within it:



===Portugal===
The Constitution is amendable through the terms prescribed under &quot;Title II: Revision of the Constitution&quot; of &quot;Part IX: Guaranteeing and Revision of the Constitution&quot; between Articles 284 and 289.

===Romania===
The Constitution of Romania mentions and outlines the terms by which it can be amended in &quot;Article 150: Amendment Initiative&quot;, &quot;Article 151: Amendment Procedure&quot;, and &quot;Article 152: Limits to Constitutional Amendments&quot;. All three articles are written under &quot;Title VII: Amendment of the Constitution&quot; of the document.

===Russia===
The Constitution of Russia was created by the Russian Federation in 1993. It can be amended in correspondence with Articles 134 through 137 of &quot;Chapter 9: Constitutional Amendments and Revision of the Constitution&quot; under the document. In 2008, certain amendments were proposed which extended the terms of the President of the Russian Federation and State Duma members from four to six years and four to five years in duration respectively. These constitutional amendments are the first truly substantial amendments to the country&#x27;s constitution added into the Russian constitution fifteen years prior to its adoption and implementation fifteen years earlier.

===Serbia===
The Constitution of Serbia states its terms for being amended between Articles 203 to 205 under &quot;Part 9: Amending The Constitution&quot; within the document. Even though the Serbian constitution can be amended, this has never happened even once ever since the document was adopted and implemented in 2006 when Montenegro declared its independence from Serbia after an independence referendum was won. This brought the state of Serbia-Montenegro to an end.

===Spain===
The Constitution of Spain can be amended through the procedures detailed between Articles 166 to 169 under &quot;Part X: Constitutional Amendment&quot; of the document. Additional details are provided between Sections 71 to 76 within the document as well.

===Sweden===
The Swedish Constitution consists of four fundamental laws: the Instrument of Government, the Act of Succession, the Freedom of the Press Act, and the Fundamental Law on Freedom of Expression.

The Instrument of Government, under &quot;Chapter 8. Acts of law and other provisions&quot;, articles 14 to 17, states that in order to amend the fundamental laws, the Riksdag must take two identical decisions, and that these decisions must be separated by a general election. At least nine months shall elapse between the first submission of the amendment proposal and the date of the election, unless an exception is granted by the Committee on the Constitution with a majority of five sixths of its members.

One third of members of the Riksdag can also call for a binding referendum on a draft constitutional measure which already passed the first vote.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, devoid of a written constitution and exercising pure parliamentary sovereignty, the final authority on all quasi-constitutional matters is ultimately the parliament itself (the legislature), by a simple majority. This means that when the legislature wishes to make changes to constitutional matters (i.e. relating to the machinery of government), there can be no entrenchment clause or special procedure which can stand in its way. Although consideration must be given to the Human Rights Act which supersedes all legislation, the act can itself be repealed or amended by a simple majority of Parliament. Despite clauses such as those in the Scotland Act 2016, which proclaims that Scotland&#x27;s devolved government cannot be abolished except by a referendum, legal commentators have noted that the Parliament of the United Kingdom may set aside such a requirement by a simple majority. Such purported entrenchment clauses are thus little more than expressions of hope and sentiment on the part of a parliament.

A similar situation could be found in the Fixed-term Parliaments Act 2011 (FTPA), which, prior to its repeal by the Dissolution and Calling of Parliament Act 2022, purported to restrict the ability of a Prime Minister on a whim to dissolve Parliament and hold a general election, as was formerly the case before the enactment of FTPA and is the case again since its repeal. In 2019, this requirement was annulled by simple majority through the passing of the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019, allowing a snap election to be held. This power of Parliament may be seen by some as a weakness of entrenchment clauses in the British system, but others contend it represents an unbridled democratic power of the electorate to effect rapid and dramatic change. Thus in the British system no parliament can bind its successor, it cannot pass an effective entrenchment clause seeking to tie the hand of future governments.

==Inadmissible amendments==
Some constitutions use entrenched clauses to restrict the kind of amendment to which they may be subject. This is usually to protect characteristics of the state considered sacrosanct, such as the democratic form of government or the protection of human rights. Amendments are often totally forbidden during a state of emergency or martial law.

* Under Article 79 (3) of the German Basic Law, modification of the federal nature of the country, or abolition or alteration of Article 1 (human dignity, human rights, immediate applicability of fundamental rights as law) or Article 20 (democracy, republicanism, rule of law, social nature of the state) is forbidden. This is in order to prevent a recurrence of events such as the Nazi Gleichschaltung, when Hitler used formally legal constitutional law to &quot;de facto&quot; abolish the constitution.
* Article 139 of the Constitution of Italy states that &quot;the republican form cannot be subject to constitutional revision&quot;.
* Article 4 of the Constitution of Turkey states that the &quot;provision of Article 1 of the Constitution establishing the form of the state as a Republic, the provisions in Article 2 on the characteristics of the Republic, and the provision of Article 3 shall not be amended, nor shall their amendment be proposed&quot;.
* Article Five of the United States Constitution, ratified in 1788, prohibited any amendments before 1808 which would affect the foreign slave trade, the tax on the slave trade, or the direct taxation provisions of the constitution. The foreign slave trade was outlawed by an act of Congress rather than by a constitutional amendment shortly after this clause expired in 1808. Also, any amendment affecting the equal representation of states in the Senate must be approved by every State. If the Corwin Amendment had passed, any future amendment to the Constitution &quot;interfering with the domestic institutions of the state&quot; (e.g., slavery) would have been banned.
* Chapter 6, Article 120, section c of the Constitution of Bahrain prohibits &quot;an amendment to Article 2 [State Religion, Shari&#x27;a, Official Language] of this Constitution, and it is not permissible under any circumstances to propose the amendment of the constitutional monarchy and the principle of inherited rule in Bahrain, as well as the bicameral system and the principles of freedom and equality established in this Constitution&quot;.
* Article 121 of the Constitution of Norway provides that amendments must not &quot;contradict the principles embodied in this Constitution, but solely relate to modifications of particular provisions which do not alter the spirit of the Constitution&quot;.
* Section 284 of Article 18 of the Alabama State Constitution states that legislative representation is based on population: any amendments are precluded from changing that.
* Part 4, Section, Article 288 of the Constitution of Portugal contains a list of 15 items that amendments &quot;must respect&quot;.
* The Supreme Court of India in the &quot;Kesavananda Bharati&quot; case held that no constitutional amendment can destroy the basic structure of the Constitution of India.
* Article 60 of the current 1988 Constitution of Brazil forbids amendments that intend to abolish individual rights or to alter the fundamental framework of the State: the Separation of Powers and the Federal Republic.
* Article 152 of the Constitution of Romania on the &quot;limits of revision&quot; prohibits amendments regarding the independence and territorial integrity of Romania, the independence of justice, the republican form of government, political pluralism, and the official language. It also forbids amendments which restrict civil rights and liberties.
* Under Article 175 of the Constitution of Morocco as promulgated after a referendum in 2011, no revision may apply to the provisions concerning the Muslim religion, the monarchical form of the State, the democratic choice of the Nation or the established fundamental rights and liberties written in the present Constitution. In particular no change may be brought to the articles naming Islam the state religion or to those detailing the functions of the King as Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin (Commander of the Faithful).
* Chapter XVI, Article 37(5) of the Indonesian Constitution states that the form of the unitary state cannot be changed.

<text>The Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party (FLP) was a left-wing American political party in Minnesota between 1918 and 1944. The FLP largely dominated Minnesota politics during the Great Depression. It was one of the most successful statewide third party movements in United States history and the longest-lasting affiliate of the national Farmer–Labor movement. At its height in the 1920s and 1930s, FLP members included three Minnesota governors, four United States senators, eight United States representatives and a majority in the Minnesota legislature.

In 1944, Hubert H. Humphrey and Elmer Benson worked to merge the party with the state&#x27;s Democratic Party, forming the contemporary Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party.

== History ==
 The Minnesota Farmer–Labor Party emerged from the Non-Partisan League (NPL), which had expanded from North Dakota into Minnesota in 1918, and the Union Labor Party (ULP) of Duluth, Minnesota, which was founded in February 1918. In 1919, the NPL reorganized as the Working People&#x27;s Non-Partisan League (WPNPL). In February 1920, the ULP joined the WPNPL.

The FLP ran on a platform of farmer and labor union protection, government ownership of certain industries, and social security laws.

In 1936, the FLP was informally allied with the New Deal coalition and supported the reelection of President Franklin Roosevelt. Roosevelt was building a national coalition and wanted a solid base in Minnesota, where the Democrats were a weak third party. Roosevelt had a deal with Governor Olson whereby the FLP would get federal patronage, and in turn the FLP would work to block a third-party ticket against Roosevelt in 1936.

One of the primary obstacles of the party, besides constant vilification on the pages of local and state newspapers, was the difficulty of uniting the party&#x27;s divergent base and maintaining political union between rural farmers and urban laborers who often had little in common other than the populist perception that they were an oppressed class of hardworking producers exploited by a small elite. A powerful pro-Communist element wanted fusion during World War II to ensure solidarity between the USSR and the USA, as partners against the Nazis.

According to political scientist George Mayer:
The farmer approached problems as a proprietor or petty capitalist. Relief to him meant a mitigation of conditions that interfered with successful farming. It involved such things as tax reduction, easier access to credit, and a floor under farm prices. His individualist psychology did not create scruples against government aid, but he welcomed it only as long as it improved agricultural conditions. When official paternalism took the form of public works or the dole, he openly opposed it because assistance on such terms forced him to abandon his chosen profession, to submerge his individuality in the labor crew, and to suffer the humiliation of the bread line. Besides, a public works program required increased revenue, and since the state relied heavily on the property tax, the cost of the program seemed likely to fall primarily on him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

At the opposite end of the seesaw sat the city worker, who sought relief from the hunger, exposure, and disease that followed the wake of unemployment. Dependent on an impersonal industrial machine, he had sloughed off the frontier tradition of individualism for the more serviceable doctrine of cooperation through trade unionism. Unlike the depressed farmer, the unemployed worker often had no property or economic stake to protect. He was largely immune to taxation and had nothing to lose by backing proposals to dilute property rights or redistribute the wealth. Driven by the primitive instinct to survive, the worker demanded financial relief measures from the state. 

The New Deal farm programs made the American Farm Bureau Federation the main organization for farmers. It was hostile to the FLP, leaving the FLP without power regarding farm economics.

The Minnesota Democratic Party, led by Hubert Humphrey, was able to absorb the Farmer–Labor Party on April 15, 1944, creating the Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party. Humphrey and his team expelled the Communist element from the new organization.

<doc id="261596" wikidata="Q506229" url="?curid=261596" title="Prana">
<text>In yoga, Ayurveda, and Indian martial arts, prana (, ; the Sanskrit word for breath, &quot;life force&quot;, or &quot;vital principle&quot;) permeates reality on all levels including inanimate objects. In Hindu literature, prāṇa is sometimes described as originating from the Sun and connecting the elements.

Five types of prāṇa, collectively known as the five &quot;vāyus&quot; (&quot;winds&quot;), are described in Hindu texts. Ayurveda, tantra and Tibetan medicine all describe &quot;prāṇa vāyu&quot; as the basic vāyu from which the other vāyus arise.

Prana is divided into ten main functions: The five Pranas – Prana, Apana, Udana, Vyana and Samana – and the five Upa-Pranas – Naga, Kurma, Devadatta, Krikala and Dhananjaya.

Pranayama, one of the eight limbs of yoga, is intended to expand conscious awareness of prana.

==Etymology==

V.S. Apte provides fourteen different meanings for the Sanskrit word &quot;&quot; () including breath or respiration; the breath of life, vital air, principle of life (usually plural in this sense, there being five such vital airs generally assumed, but three, six, seven, nine, and even ten are also spoken of); energy or vigour; the spirit or soul.

Of these meanings, the concept of &quot;vital air&quot; is used by Bhattacharyya to describe the concept as used in Sanskrit texts dealing with pranayama, the manipulation of the breath. Thomas McEvilley translates &quot;prāṇa&quot; as &quot;spirit-energy&quot;. The breath is understood to be its most subtle material form, but is also believed to be present in the blood, and most concentrated in semen and vaginal fluid.

Scholars are divided on the original meanings of &quot;prana&quot; and &quot;apana&quot;. Some, like Böhtlingk, argue that originally &quot;prana&quot; meant inbreathing, while &quot;apana&quot; meant outbreathing. Others, like Deussen, claim the opposite, stating that &quot;prana&quot; meant outbreathing and &quot;apana&quot; meant inbreathing. However, they agree that in later times, these two terms came to refer to air located in different parts of the body, with &quot;prana&quot; associated with the upper parts and &quot;apana&quot; with the lower parts.

==Early references==
The ancient concept of prāṇa is described in many Hindu texts, including Upanishads and Vedas. Prāṇa is typically divided into constituent parts, particularly when concerned with the human body. While not all early sources agree on the names or number of these divisions, the most common list from the &quot;Mahabharata&quot;, the Upanishads, Ayurvedic and Yogic sources includes five classifications, often subdivided. This list includes &quot;prāṇa&quot; (inward moving energy), &quot;apāna&quot; (outward moving energy), &quot;vyāna&quot; (circulation of energy), &quot;udāna&quot; (energy of the head and throat), and &quot;samāna&quot; (digestion and assimilation).

Early mention of specific prāṇas often emphasized prāṇa, apāna and vyāna as &quot;the three breaths&quot;. This can be seen in the proto-yogic traditions of the Vratyas among others. Texts like the &quot;Vaikānasasmārta&quot; utilized the five prāṇas as an internalization of the five sacrificial fires of a panchāgni homa ceremony.

=== Vedas and Upanishads ===
One of the earliest references to prāṇa is found in the &quot;Chandogya Upanishad&quot;, but many other Upanishads also use the concept, including the &quot;Katha&quot;, &quot;Mundaka&quot;, and &quot;Prashna Upanishads&quot;. The concept is elaborated upon in great detail in the literature of haṭha yoga, tantra, and Ayurveda.

The &quot;Atharvaveda&quot; describes prāṇa: &#x27;When they had been watered by Prana, the plants spake in concert: &#x27;thou hast, forsooth, prolonged our life, thou hast made us all fragrant.&#x27; (11.4–6) &#x27;The holy (âtharvana) plants, the magic (ângirasa) plants, the divine plants, and those produced by men, spring forth, when thou, O Prâna, quickenest them (11.4–16). &#x27;When Prâna has watered the great earth with rain, then the plants spring forth, and also every sort of herb.&#x27; (11.4–17) &#x27;O Prâna, be not turned away from me, thou shall not be other than myself! As the embryo of the waters (fire), thee, O Prâna, do bind to me, that I may live.&#x27; (11.4)

The Upanishads, particularly the Yoga Upanishads, discuss various breaths with specific names and functions. &quot;Prana&quot; is consistently regarded as the primary breath, akin to breath in English, while &quot;apana&quot; is associated with carrying off excrement. The &quot;Prashna Upanishad&quot; first described &quot;prana&quot; governing upper body functions and &quot;apana&quot; controlling lower functions, based on the concept of distinct airs or gases governing bodily functions. &quot;Aitareya Upanishad&quot; also support this division of breaths, associating &quot;prana&quot; with the nasal region and &quot;apana&quot; with the abdominal region.

=== Bhagavad Gita ===
The &quot;Bhagavad Gita&quot; verse 4.27 describes the yoga of self-control as the sacrifice of the actions of the senses and of prāṇa in the fire kindled by knowledge. More generally, the conquest of the senses, the mind, and prāṇa is seen as an essential step on the yogin&#x27;s path to samadhi, or indeed as the goal of yoga. Thus, for example, the &quot;Malinivijayottaratantra&quot; 12.5–7 directs the seeker &quot;who has conquered posture, the mind, prāṇa, the senses, sleep, anger, fear, and anxiety&quot; to practise yoga in a beautiful, undisturbed cave.

One way of categorizing prāṇa is by means of vāyus. &quot;Vāyu&quot; means &quot;wind&quot; or &quot;air&quot; in Sanskrit, and the term is used in a variety of contexts in Hindu philosophy. Prāṇa is considered the basic vāyu from which the other vāyus arise, as well as one of the five major vāyus. Prāṇa is thus the generic name for all the breaths, including the five major vāyus of prāṇa, apāna, uḍāna, samāna, and vyāna. The &quot;Nisvasattvasamhita Nayasutra&quot; describes five minor winds, naming three of these as nāga, dhanamjaya, and kurma; the other two are named in the &quot;Skandapurana&quot; (181.46) and &quot;Sivapurana Vayaviyasamhita&quot; (37.36) as devadatta and krtaka.

==Nadis==

Indian philosophy describes prana flowing in nadis (channels), though the details vary. The &quot;Brhadaranyaka Upanishad&quot; (2.I.19) mentions 72,000 nadis in the human body, running out from the heart, whereas the &quot;Katha Upanishad&quot; (6.16) says that 101 channels radiate from the heart. The &quot;Vinashikhatantra&quot; (140–146) explains the most common model, namely that the three most important nadis are the Ida on the left, the Pingala on the right, and the Sushumna in the centre connecting the base chakra to the crown chakra, enabling prana to flow throughout the subtle body.

When the mind is agitated due to our interactions with the world at large, the physical body also follows in its wake. These agitations cause violent fluctuations in the flow of prana in the nadis.

== Pranayama ==
Prāṇāyāma is a common term for various techniques for accumulating, expanding and working with prana. Pranayama is one of the eight limbs of yoga and is a practice of specific and often intricate breath control techniques. The dynamics and laws of Prana were understood through systematic practice of Pranayama to gain mastery over Prana.

Many pranayama techniques are designed to cleanse the nadis, allowing for greater movement of prana. Other techniques may be utilized to arrest the breath for samadhi or to bring awareness to specific areas in the practitioner&#x27;s subtle or physical body. In Tibetan Buddhism, it is utilized to generate inner heat in the practice of tummo.

In Ayurveda and therapeutic yoga, pranayama is utilized for many tasks, including to affect mood and aid in digestion. A. G. Mohan stated that the physical goals of pranayama may be to recover from illness or the maintenance of health, while its mental goals are: &quot;to remove mental disturbances and make the mind focused for meditation&quot;.

According to Theos Bernard, the ultimate aim of pranayama is the suspension of breathing, &quot;causing the mind to swoon&quot;. Swami Yogananda writes, &quot;The real meaning of Pranayama, according to Patanjali, the founder of Yoga philosophy, is the gradual cessation of breathing, the discontinuance of inhalation and exhalation&quot;.

== Similar concepts ==
Similar concepts exist in various cultures, including the Latin &quot;anima&quot; (&quot;breath&quot;, &quot;vital force&quot;, &quot;animating principle&quot;), Islamic and Sufic ruh, the Greek pneuma, the Chinese qi, the Polynesian mana, the Amerindian orenda, the German od, and the Hebrew ruah. Prāṇa is also described as subtle energy or life force.

<text>Route 122 is a short, state highway in Warren County, New Jersey. The route runs from Warren County Route 678 and Pursel Street in Phillipsburg to an intersection with U.S. Route 22 (US 22) in Pohatcong Township. The route is a former alignment of US 22, designated in 1926, however, until 1993, the route was designated U.S. Route 22 Alternate. After 1993, the route was decommissioned and replaced by County Route 678 (CR 648) and Route 122.

==Route description==

Route 122 begins at an intersection with Pursel Street as a county-maintained continuation of Warren County Route 678 in Phillipsburg. The highway progresses eastward as South Main Street, heading through residential homes along the Delaware River. At an intersection with Kent Street, it makes a gradual bend to the east, passing under Norfolk Southern&#x27;s Lehigh Line, and then intersecting with Warren County Route 642 (Carpentersville Road).
Continuing eastward along South Main Street, it enters Pohatcong Township where state maintenance begins. At first, the road passes residential homes; continuing eastward, the highway enters a large residential district, with homes surrounding the highway for several blocks. At the intersection with County Route 519 (Saint James Avenue), the two routes head along a wrong-way concurrency, running along New Brunswick Avenue, passing the residential district and several schools. At that point, the residential district becomes more commercial, with County Route 519 heading to the south along Third Avenue. The route continues eastward along New Brunswick Avenue, returning to the residential portions of Pohatcong Township. The route continues eastward, interchanging partially with U.S. Route 22, where the highway terminates. I-78 is located south of where the route ends. New Brunswick Avenue continues ahead without a designation. New Brunswick Avenue continues named Dumont Avenue, it continues until it reaches County Road 519.
==History==
Route 122 originated as an alignment of U.S. Route 22, and a remnant of Route 28, which was designated in 1926 as part of the highway system as the Phillipsburg–Easton Bridge. The route continued as U.S. Route 22 until the completion of the bypass in 1938 around Phillipsburg, which US 22 was transferred to the bypass. The former alignment became U.S. Route 22 Alternate, lasting through the 1953 state highway renumbering. The route continued to run from the Phillipsburg–Easton Bridge to US 22, until 1993, when US 22 Alternate was decommissioned and replaced by Route 122 and County Route 678. The route was first named Chester Avenue, it was then named Route 29. In 1915, the New Jersey established its first highway department, thus, giving funding to localities to improve their roads. Later, it was renamed Route 22.

<doc id="261600" wikidata="Q825761" url="?curid=261600" title="New Jersey Route 124">
<text>Route 124 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey in the United States that is long. It is the eastern section of what used to be Route 24 before that road was realigned to its current freeway alignment. The western end is at an intersection with U.S. Route 202 (US 202) and County Route 510 (CR 510) in Morristown, Morris County; the eastern end continues as CR 603 on Springfield Avenue at the border between Maplewood and Irvington in Essex County. The route runs through suburban areas of Morris County, passing through Madison and Chatham. It interchanges with Route 24 on the border of Millburn, Essex County and Summit, Union County and serves as a frontage road for that route. Upon splitting from Route 24, Route 124 continues east through Springfield Township, Union Township, and Maplewood to its eastern terminus.

The alignment of today&#x27;s Route 124 was first designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 5 in 1916, a route that was to run from Delaware, Warren County to Newark. In 1927, this portion of the route became a part of Route 24, a route that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. A freeway, which is the current alignment of Route 24, was proposed for this portion of the route in the 1950s that was approved in 1960. Route 24 was moved to the new freeway between the John F. Kennedy Parkway on the Millburn/Summit border and Interstate 78 (I-78) in 1972, with Route 124 being designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point. In 1992, the Route 24 freeway was completed between I-287 in Hanover Township and the John F. Kennedy Parkway. As a result, Route 124 was extended west along the former Route 24 to U.S. Route 202 in Morristown.

==Route description==

===Morris County===
Route 124 begins at the intersection of US 202 and CR 510 at the Park Place square in the downtown of Morristown, Morris County. From here, it heads to the southeast as South Street, a two-lane undivided road that passes businesses. At the intersection with CR 663, the road widens to four lanes. A short distance later, CR 601 continues southeast on South Street and Route 124 bears left to head east on Madison Avenue, coming to an interchange with Interstate 287. Past this interchange, the road passes Morristown Memorial Hospital and continues through mainly commercial areas with some homes. At the intersection with Normandy Parkway, the route turns to the southeast and enters Morris Township, where it narrows to two lanes again, with NJ Transit’s Morristown Line running a short distance to the northeast of the route near the Morris County Golf Club. Route 124 continues into more residential areas and crosses into Madison.

Here, the route passes near some business parks before intersecting CR 636, where it is briefly a four-lane road. Past this intersection, the road passes between residential neighborhoods to the northeast and Drew University to the southwest. Route 124 crosses over the Morristown Line near James Park and becomes Main Street, heading southeast through the commercial downtown of Madison. Here, the road intersects CR 647 and CR 608. Past the Rosedale Avenue intersection, the route heads into a mix of residential and business areas. Route 124 enters Chatham at the intersection with Brooklake Road/Division Avenue. In the center of the town, the route intersects CR 638 and CR 607 before continuing east.

===Essex and Union counties===
Route 124 crosses the Passaic River and runs along the border of Millburn, Essex County, to the north and Summit, Union County, coming to a large interchange with the Route 24 freeway and CR 649 (John F. Kennedy Parkway). Here, the route becomes a frontage road for the Route 24 freeway that has two lanes in each direction. The road passes to the south of The Mall at Short Hills before running through the Canoe Brook Country Club. It heads southeast into wooded residential neighborhoods and intersects Union CR 657, where the Route 124 frontage road has ramps to Route 24. A short distance later, the route passes an overpass to nowhere that crosses over Route 24 at Brantwood Drive which was closed and walled off. The Route 124 frontage road has since eliminated the intersection at Brantwood Drive. In 2013, City of Summit vacated the 50-foot public right of way of the old road section from Route 124 into the current Brantwood Drive. In a short distance, Route 124 intersects CR 608, at which point the route has an eastbound ramp to eastbound Route 24 and a westbound ramp from westbound Route 24. Past this intersection, the Route 124 frontage road along Route 24 ends and the route becomes a two-lane undivided road called South Service Road that closely parallels the north side of Route 24, passing under the Morristown Line. The route heads past businesses and forms the border of Millburn to the north and Springfield Township, Union County to the south, coming to an intersection with CR 512 near an interchange with Route 24. There is a direct ramp from westbound Route 124 to Route 24 a short distance to the northwest of this intersection.
From here, the route passes more commercial establishments as a four-lane road, heading farther from Route 24, before crossing CR 527. At this intersection, Route 124 entirely enters Springfield Township and becomes Morris Avenue, passing a mix of residences and businesses. The route passes under I-78 without an interchange and becomes a two-lane road that passes through the downtown of Springfield, eventually widening to four lanes again. In this area, it intersects CR 635. Route 124 comes to a circular junction with Route 82 and CR 577. Here, Route 82 continues southeast on Morris Avenue, CR 509 Spur heads south, and CR 577 heads north. Route 124, meanwhile, briefly splits into a one-way pair here. The eastbound direction heads south on Meisel Avenue before turning north along Maple Avenue while the westbound direction follows Springfield Avenue. The two directions of Route 124 rejoin and follow four-lane divided Springfield Avenue northeast to a crossing of the Rahway River and a partial interchange with I-78. Here, there are ramps from the local lanes of eastbound I-78 to both directions of Route 124, to the local lanes of westbound I-78 and Route 24 from both directions of Route 124, and to the express lanes of westbound Interstate 78 from westbound Route 124.
Past this interchange, the route enters Union Township and continues east through developed areas, intersecting CR 638 before narrowing into a two-lane undivided road and intersecting CR 630. It continues through more urban commercial areas before intersecting CR 630 again. At this point, Route 124 crosses into Maplewood, Essex County and becomes a three-lane road with a center left-turn lane that is locally maintained. This road heads east through the downtown of Maplewood, coming to an intersection with CR 601. A short distance later, the Route 124 designation ends at the border of Maplewood and Irvington. From this point, Springfield Avenue continues east as CR 603, which heads toward Newark and ends at CR 510, which follows Springfield Avenue for a short distance before becoming Market Street.

==History==
What is modern-day Route 124 was created as part of two turnpikes; the Morris Turnpike, running from Elizabeth to Newton, and the Springfield and Newark Turnpike, from Springfield to Newark. The road was later incorporated into the William Penn Highway, which ran from Jersey City to Pittsburgh, before being designated as a part of pre-1927 Route 5, a route that was legislated in 1916 to run from Delaware in Warren County east to Newark. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this portion of pre-1927 Route 5 became a part of Route 24, a road that was to run from Phillipsburg to Newark. In the 1950s, plans were made to bypass this portion of Route 24 with a freeway running from Interstate 287 in Hanover Township to Interstate 78 in Springfield Township; this was approved of in 1960. This freeway was completed between Interstate 78 and the John F. Kennedy Parkway in 1972. The Route 24 designation was moved to the new freeway and Route 124 was designated along the former alignment of Route 24 east of this point, which included frontage roads built where the new freeway ran along the old alignment of the road. Following the completion of the Route 24 freeway to Interstate 287 in 1992, Route 124 was extended west along the former alignment of Route 24 between the John F. Kennedy Parkway and U.S. Route 202 in Morristown. In 2002, maintenance of the portion of Route 124 in Maplewood was transferred to the municipality from the New Jersey Department of Transportation.

<doc id="261602" wikidata="Q826090" url="?curid=261602" title="New Jersey Route 139">
<text>Route 139 is a state highway in Jersey City, New Jersey in the United States that heads east from the Pulaski Skyway over Tonnele Circle to the state line with New Jersey and New York in the Holland Tunnel, which is under the Hudson River, to New York City. The western portion of the route is a two-level highway that is charted by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) as two separate roadways: The lower roadway (Route 139) between U.S. Route 1/9 (US 1/9) over Tonnele Circle and Interstate 78 (I-78) at Jersey Avenue, and the upper roadway (Route 139U or Hoboken Avenue) running from County Route 501 (John F. Kennedy Boulevard) and ending where it joins the lower highway as part of the 12th Street Viaduct, which ends at Jersey Avenue. The lower roadway is listed on the federal and NJ state registers of historic places since 2005. The eastern of the route includes the Holland Tunnel approach that runs concurrent with Interstate 78 on the one-way pair of 12th Street eastbound and 14th Street westbound. Including the concurrency, the total length of Route 139 is .

What is now Route 139 was originally the northernmost part of the Route 1 Extension. Route 25 replaced Route 1 in the 1927 renumbering. In 1953 renumbering, Route 25 was changed back to U.S. Route 1, which had been previously rerouted to cross the Hudson River when the George Washington Bridge opened in 1931. Route 25 from the Pulaski Skyway over Tonnele Circle to the Holland Tunnel became U.S. Route 1/9 Business. By the 1990s, U.S. Route 1/9 Business was replaced by Route 139.

NJDOT began a rehabilitation program for the lower and upper levels of the highway in 2005. The renovation work for the 12th Street and 14th Street viaducts was completed in 2010. Renovation of the upper roadway, including the Hoboken Avenue Viaduct, and Conrail Viaduct on the lower roadway was expected to be completed by 2016.

==Route description==

Route 139 is essentially three distinct, but connected highways: the upper level, the lower level, and the Holland Tunnel approach (the Interstate 78 concurrency). NJDOT officially charts the lower and upper levels as independent highways, with the lower level considered Route 139 with a notation that the highway then coincides with I-78, and the upper level considered Route 139U, while not signed as such.

===Lower level===
The lower level of Route 139 is a four-lane freeway with its western end at U.S. Route 1/9 a continuation of the Pulaski Skyway over Tonnele Circle. A direct ramp, known as the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, passes over the circle, to connect westbound traffic with southbound U.S. Route 1/9 Truck, which quickly connects to Route 7 that leads to Interstate 280. Northbound U.S. Route 1/9 Truck connects through the circle to eastbound traffic. The skyway soon ends with eastbound and westbound ramps at a cut in Bergen Hill and the four-lane highway passes under John F. Kennedy Boulevard. The road turns to the southeast as Conrail&#x27;s National Docks Branch and Long Dock Tunnel crosses over the Bergen Arches, an abandoned Erie Railroad right-of-way. The highway then enters an enclosed open cut, running under the upper level of Route 139 as it passes through the Hudson Palisades; this section is known as the Depressed Highway. The covered roadway is naturally ventilated, with wide openings on the south side of the eastbound lanes (facing the parallel Bergen Arches right-of-way to the south), and ventilation bays over the westbound lanes. The road re-emerges under Palisade Avenue and splits into two viaducts, one eastbound and one westbound, which merge with Interstate 78 just west of Jersey Avenue at the Holland Tunnel approach.

===Upper level===
 The upper level of Route 139 (also known as State Highway and Hoboken Avenue Viaduct) begins at an intersection with County Route 501 (Kennedy Boulevard), which connects to Bayonne and Union City. The road heads to the southeast through urban residential and commercial areas as a four-lane undivided road, coming to an intersection with Collard Street. Just past this, the route becomes a four-lane divided road, which is separated by ventilation bays from the lower roadway, with the eastbound lanes running above the lower level of Route 139. It continues between the Heights district to the north and the Journal Square district to the south. It crosses several streets, including County Route 646 (St. Pauls Avenue), County Route 617 (Summit Avenue), County Route 663 (Central Avenue), and County Route 644 (Oakland Street). The road meets Concord Street, where there is an eastbound left lane exit and a westbound intersection. After the intersection with Palisade Avenue, the upper level of Route 139 splits and merges with the lower level with a westbound ramp, which has a westbound entrance from the local Hoboken Avenue, and an eastbound ramp.

===Viaducts===
The four-lane 12th Street and 14th Street viaducts, completed in 1927 and 1951 respectively, carry Upper Route 139 between Jersey Avenue at Boyle Plaza and the cut into Bergen Hill under Palisade Avenue. Ramps from the western end of 12th Street Viaduct connect to the upper level roadway at the top of Bergen Hill at the Palisade Avenue intersection. Westbound ramp on north side is separated from the main highway by a reinforced concrete retaining wall; the eastbound ramp on south side is supported by reinforced concrete deck arch spans. The western end of 12th Street Viaduct transitions from two-way to one-way, four-lane eastbound traffic just east of the connection with the westbound 14th Street Viaduct. NJDOT undertook a $92 million project to renew the viaducts. The reason for this project was that the viaducts were structurally deficient. The steel beams on the viaducts had deteriorated and the concrete was just extra weight. The project included replacement of the concrete deck, retrofitting for earthquakes, repair of the substructure and superstructure, and construction of a shoulder on westbound 14th Street Viaduct. The rehabilitated viaducts were to also feature ornamental designs to recall the historical significance of the two viaducts. This project was completed in 2010.

===I-78 concurrency===

The elevated westbound Interstate 78 diverges from 14th Street Viaduct of Route 139 one block west of Jersey Avenue. A viaduct for eastbound Interstate 78 runs along south side of eastern section of the 12th Street Viaduct. The highway merges with Route 139 at eastern terminus of 12th Street Viaduct. From here, Route 139 continues east concurrent with that route and passes through business areas as a one-way pair that follows six-lane 12th Street eastbound and six-lane 14th Street westbound. This segment of the route is under the jurisdiction of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and this area is also known as Boyle Plaza. The first intersection is with Jersey Avenue, which heads to Downtown Jersey City and Hoboken. It intersects with the one-way northbound County Route 633 (Erie Street) next before crossing one-way southbound County Route 635 (Grove Street). After Grove Street, the road crosses County Route 637 (Luis Muñoz Marín Boulevard) near the Newport Centre Mall just to the south. Past this intersection, the eastbound traffic comes to the former toll plaza for the Holland Tunnel. From here, the concurrency enters the Holland Tunnel under the Hudson River, which carries two lanes in each direction. Route 139 ends at the New Jersey and New York state line within the tunnel and Interstate 78 continues into New York City.

At no point in the I-78 concurrency approaching the Holland Tunnel is the road signed as Route 139. The first time the route is signed westbound is at the split with I-78, and the last time it’s signed eastbound is before it merges with I-78. Even in New York, approaching the tunnel, I-78 is signed with the entrance but Route 139 is not.

==History==
=== Early years and route numbering ===

What is now the lower level of Route 139 was originally designated as the northernmost part of Route 1 Extension, which was authorized by the New Jersey Legislature in 1922, a route that was to extend the existing Route 1 from Elizabeth to the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, this road was also designated as part of U.S. Route 1. In the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering, this highway became part of Route 25, a route that was to run from the Ben Franklin Bridge in Camden to the Holland Tunnel.
In the 1953 state highway renumbering, Route 25 designation was changed to U.S. Route 1/9 Business from the Pulaski Skyway over Tonnele Circle to the Holland Tunnel. By the 1990s, U.S. Route 1/9 Business was renumbered to NJ Route 139. Along with the Pulaski Skyway, most of the Route 139 lower level became a contributing property to the Route 1 Extension historic district listed with the state and federal registers of historic places in 2005.

The Newark Bay Extension of the New Jersey Turnpike for Interstate 78 was opened in 1956 to provide access from the New Jersey Turnpike to the Holland Tunnel. Route 139 and I-78 were designated as concurrent where the roads joined at the Holland Tunnel approach near Jersey Avenue all the way to the New York state line in the Holland Tunnel.

=== Holland Tunnel and Pulaski Skyway connections ===
As part of the Holland Tunnel project, the New Jersey Interstate Bridge and Tunnel Commission and the New York State Bridge and Tunnel Commission widened the four blocks of 12th and 14th Streets in Jersey City from Jersey Avenue to Provost Street. 12th Street was widened west of Grove Street to , with the remaining block, at the toll plaza, being wide. 14th Street, and the two blocks of Jersey Avenue carrying westbound traffic to the 12th Street Viaduct, were widened to .

The two-way, 12th Street Viaduct from Jersey Avenue to the top of Bergen Hill was opened July 4, 1927. The four-lane, westbound, , 14th Street Viaduct, which was connected to the 12th Street Viaduct, was opened on February 13, 1951. The Port of New York Authority, which superseded the two state tunnel commissions and took over authority for the Holland Tunnel in 1930, built the 14th Street Viaduct in order to avoid the turns to and from Jersey Avenue, but turned over authority over the viaduct to the New Jersey State Highway Commission. The western end of 12th Street Viaduct was transitioned from two-way traffic to one-way, four-lane, eastbound traffic just east of the connection with the westbound 14th Street Viaduct. It was widened on the southern side between span nos. 1-24 on the eastern end to accommodate the merge in 1956 with the eastbound New Jersey Turnpike extension, I-78.
In 1928, the completed lower level portion of the highway, along with Route 1 Extension on the eastern side of the Passaic River, was opened as the first part of the eventual high-speed connection between the Holland Tunnel and Newark. The upper level of Route 139 (Hoboken Avenue Viaduct), which provided a multi-lane thoroughfare from Palisades Avenue to John F. Kennedy Boulevard, was also opened.

The high-speed freeway connection was completed with the opening of the Pulaski Skyway in 1932. The Pulaski Skyway ramp at its eastern terminus was eventually replaced with two long outside ramps that were dedicated for eastbound and westbound traffic from the cut in Bergen Hill just west of John F. Kennedy Boulevard. On September 14, 1938, a direct ramp, known as the Tonnele Circle Viaduct, opened over Tonnele Circle to connect westbound traffic with southbound U.S. Route 1/9 Truck, which quickly connects to Route 7 that leads to Interstate 280.

=== Later years ===

The Bergen Arches Expressway was proposed in 1989 by Governor Thomas Kean to connect the Jersey City waterfront with a new railroad line, which would provide access to the Meadowlands Sports Complex. This four-lane road was to follow an abandoned railroad line known as the Bergen Arches. This proposed highway was strongly supported by Jersey City Mayor Bret Schundler, who felt that the road could bring further development, as well as provide traffic relief to the four-lane Route 139. In 1998, this project was allocated $26 million in the federal Transportation Equity Act for the 21st Century. Both Jersey City mayor candidates in 2001 supported a transit line instead of a highway along the Bergen Arches. Plans for a highway along the Bergen Arches were dropped in 2002 as leaders of Jersey City, including Mayor Glenn Dale Cunningham, favored mass transit.

In a controversial move in 2011, Governor Chris Christie directed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to divert money originally earmarked for the Access to the Region&#x27;s Core rail project to highway projects. The agency agreed to pay $1.8 billion to partially fund rehabilitation to the Pulaski Skyway and Route 139, and other projects that it considers part of the larger distribution network in the Port of New York and New Jersey.

The Route 139 project rehabilitated the eastbound side of Hoboken Avenue Viaduct and resurfaced the westbound roadway. There were operational improvements at several intersections on the upper roadway, replacing all overpasses. It also replaced the deck and rehabilitated the superstructure of the Conrail Viaduct. The total project cost was estimated at $180–200 million and was expected to be completed by 2016, then later pushed back to 2019. The Pulaski Skyway reopened in mid-2018, and the lower level of Route 139 was temporarily restored to four lanes in December 2018, but was partially closed again in early 2019. Improvements added to Route 139&#x27;s lower level in 2019 included new lighting and new pavement markings.

The section of 12th Street east of Marin Boulevard, which carries the eastbound I-78 and Route 139 toward the Holland Tunnel in Jersey City, was narrowed from six to four lanes after open road tolling was implemented at the Holland Tunnel. Subsequently, in 2025, the United States Department of Transportation awarded a $25 million grant to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to narrow the stretch of 12th Street between Jersey Avenue and Marin Boulevard.

<text>Route 140 is a state highway in Carneys Point Township, Salem County, New Jersey, United States. It is a short east–west connector in Deepwater between U.S. Route 130 (US 130; Shell Road) and both the New Jersey Turnpike and U.S. Route 40 (Wiley Road) in Carneys Point near the Delaware Memorial Bridge. It is completely concurrent with County Route 540 (CR 540). Because of its close proximity to these major arteries (as well as Interstate 295 or I-295), there are numerous truck stops, motels, and diners along this highway, despite its short length. Also, the main entrance to the DuPont Chamber Works facility is located at the end on US Route 130.

==Route description==

Route 140 begins at U.S. Route 130 in the community of Deepwater, New Jersey. The route heads eastward as Hawks Bridge Road, passing through forestry east of the DuPont riverside factory. The large portion of forestry breaks up into a large clearing. In this large clearing, Route 140 passes between two truck stops. The route continues, intersecting with the on-ramps to Interstate 295. Route 140 then crosses over the interstate and settles back on land. From there, Route 140 crosses to the north of another truck stop and intersects with County Route 551 (South Pennsville-Auburn Road). Intersecting with local off-ramps, the route crosses by some businesses before interchanging with the New Jersey Turnpike and U.S. Route 40. The route continues a short distance after the interchange, terminating at Wiley Road, where it continues as County Route 540.

==History==
Route 140 was first legislated by the New Jersey State Legislature in 1973 as a state highway from U.S. Route 130 to U.S. Route 40. The eastern two-thirds was state-maintained because of the Interstate 295 and the New Jersey Turnpike interchanges. The route remained unnumbered however. In 1977, the western third (U.S. Route 130 to Interstate 295) was taken over by the state and the route was designated Route 140 and has remained the same since the legislation.

<doc id="261613" wikidata="Q189588" url="?curid=261613" title="Stomach cancer">
<text>Stomach cancer, also known as gastric cancer, is a malignant tumor of the stomach. It is a cancer that develops in the lining of the stomach. Most cases of stomach cancers are gastric carcinomas, which can be divided into a number of subtypes, including gastric adenocarcinomas. Lymphomas and mesenchymal tumors may also develop in the stomach. Early symptoms may include heartburn, upper abdominal pain, nausea, and loss of appetite. Later signs and symptoms may include weight loss, yellowing of the skin and whites of the eyes, vomiting, difficulty swallowing, and blood in the stool, among others. The cancer may spread from the stomach to other parts of the body, particularly the liver, lungs, bones, lining of the abdomen, and lymph nodes.
The bacterium &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; accounts for more than 60% of cases of stomach cancer. Certain strains of &quot;H. pylori&quot; have greater risks than others. Smoking, dietary factors such as pickled vegetables and obesity are other risk factors. About 10% of cases run in families, and between 1% and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer. Most of the time, stomach cancer develops in stages over years. Diagnosis is usually by biopsy done during endoscopy. This is followed by medical imaging to determine if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. Japan and South Korea, two countries that have high rates of the disease, screen for stomach cancer.
A Mediterranean diet lowers the risk of stomach cancer, as does not smoking. Tentative evidence indicates that treating &quot;H. pylori&quot; decreases the future risk. If stomach cancer is treated early, it can be cured. Treatments may include some combination of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and targeted therapy. For certain subtypes of gastric cancer, cancer immunotherapy is an option as well. If treated late, palliative care may be advised. Some types of lymphoma can be cured by eliminating &quot;H. pylori&quot;. Outcomes are often poor, with a less than 10% five-year survival rate in the Western world for advanced cases. This is largely because most people with the condition present with advanced disease. In the United States, five-year survival is 31.5%, while in South Korea it is over 65% and Japan over 70%, partly due to screening efforts.
Globally, stomach cancer is the fifth-leading type of cancer and the third-leading cause of death from cancer, making up 7% of cases and 9% of deaths. In 2018, it newly occurred in 1.03 million people and caused 783,000 deaths. Before the 1930s, it was a leading cause of cancer deaths in the Western world; rates have sharply declined among younger generations in the West, although they remain high for people living in East Asia. The decline in the West is believed to be due to the decline of salted and pickled food consumption, as a result of the development of refrigeration as a method of preserving food. Stomach cancer occurs most commonly in East Asia, followed by Eastern Europe. It occurs twice as often in males as in females.

==Signs and symptoms==
Stomach cancer is often either asymptomatic (producing no noticeable symptoms) or it may cause only nonspecific symptoms (which may also be present in other related or unrelated disorders) in its early stages. By the time symptoms are recognized, the cancer has often reached an advanced stage (see below) and may have metastasized (spread to other, perhaps distant, parts of the body), which is one of the main reasons for its relatively poor prognosis. Stomach cancer can cause the following signs and symptoms: Unexplained nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea and constipation. Patients also can experience unexplained weight loss.

Early cancers may be associated with indigestion or a burning sensation (heartburn). However, fewer than one in every 50 people referred for endoscopy due to indigestion has cancer. Abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite can occur.

Gastric cancers that have enlarged and invaded normal tissue can cause weakness, fatigue, bloating of the stomach after meals, abdominal pain in the upper abdomen, nausea and occasional vomiting. Further enlargement may cause weight loss or bleeding with vomiting blood or having blood in the stool, the latter apparent as black discolouration (melena) and sometimes leading to anemia. Dysphagia suggests a tumour in the cardia or extension of the gastric tumour into the esophagus.

These can be symptoms of other problems such as a stomach virus, gastric ulcer, or tropical sprue.

==Risk factors==
Gastric cancer can occur as a result of many factors. It occurs twice as commonly in males as females. Estrogen may protect women against the development of this form of cancer.

===Infections===
&quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; infection is an essential risk factor in 65–80% of gastric cancers, but only 2% of people with &quot;H. pylori&quot; infections develop stomach cancer. The mechanism by which &quot;H. pylori&quot; induces stomach cancer potentially involves chronic inflammation, the action of &quot;H. pylori&quot; virulence factors such as CagA, or an interaction between &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection and germline pathogenic variants in homologous-recombination genes. It was estimated that Epstein–Barr virus is responsible for 84,000 cases per year. AIDS is also associated with elevated risk.

===Smoking===
Smoking increases the risk of developing gastric cancer significantly, from 40% increased risk for current smokers to 82% increase for heavy smokers. Gastric cancers due to smoking mostly occur in the upper part of the stomach near the esophagus.

===Alcohol===
Some studies show increased risk with alcohol consumption as well.

===Diet===
Dietary factors are not proven causes, and the association between stomach cancer and various foods and beverages is weak. Some foods including fried foods, smoked foods, salt and salt-rich foods, meat, processed meat, red meat, pickled vegetables, and brackens are associated with a higher risk of stomach cancer.

Fresh fruit and vegetable intake, citrus fruit intake, and antioxidant intake are associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer. A Mediterranean diet is associated with lower rates of stomach cancer, as is regular aspirin use.

Obesity is a physical risk factor that has been found to increase the risk of gastric adenocarcinoma by contributing to the development of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The exact mechanism by which obesity causes GERD is not completely known. Studies hypothesize that increased dietary fat leading to increased pressure on the stomach and the lower esophageal sphincter, due to excess adipose tissue, could play a role, yet no statistically significant data have been collected. However, the risk of gastric cardia adenocarcinoma, with GERD present, has been found to increase more than two times for an obese person. There is a correlation between iodine deficiency and gastric cancer.
===Genetics===
About 10% of cases run in families, and between 1 and 3% of cases are due to genetic syndromes inherited such as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer.

A genetic risk factor for gastric cancer is a genetic defect of the &quot;CDH1&quot; gene known as hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (HDGC). The &quot;CDH1&quot; gene, which codes for E-cadherin, lies on the 16th chromosome. When the gene experiences a particular mutation, gastric cancer develops through a mechanism that is not fully understood. This mutation is considered autosomal dominant, meaning that half of a carrier&#x27;s children will likely experience the same mutation. Diagnosis of hereditary diffuse gastric cancer usually takes place when at least two cases involving a family member, such as a parent or grandparent, are diagnosed, with at least one diagnosed before the age of 50. The diagnosis can also be made if at least three cases occur in the family, in which case age is not considered.

The International Cancer Genome Consortium is leading efforts to identify genomic changes involved in stomach cancer. A very small percentage of diffuse-type gastric cancers (see Histopathology below) arise from an inherited abnormal &quot;CDH1&quot; gene. Genetic testing and treatment options are available for families at risk.

==Diagnosis==
To find the cause of symptoms, the doctor asks about the patient&#x27;s medical history, does a physical examination, and may order laboratory studies.
The patient may also have one or all of these exams:
* Gastroscopic exam is the diagnostic method of choice. This involves insertion of a fibre optic camera into the stomach to visualise it.
* Upper GI series (may be called barium roentgenogram)
* Computed tomography or CT scanning of the abdomen may reveal gastric cancer. It is more useful to determine invasion into adjacent tissues or the presence of spread to local lymph nodes. Wall thickening of more than 1 cm that is focal, eccentric, and enhancing favours malignancy.

In 2013, Chinese and Israeli scientists reported a successful pilot study of a breathalyzer-style breath test intended to diagnose stomach cancer by analyzing exhaled chemicals without the need for an intrusive endoscopy. A larger-scale clinical trial of this technology was completed in 2014.

Abnormal tissue seen in a gastroscope examination is biopsied by the surgeon or gastroenterologist. This tissue is then sent to a pathologist for histological examination under a microscope to check for the presence of cancerous cells. A biopsy, with subsequent histological analysis, is the only sure way to confirm the presence of cancer cells.

Various gastroscopic modalities have been developed to increase yield of detected mucosa with a dye that accentuates the cell structure and can identify areas of dysplasia. Endocytoscopy involves ultra-high magnification to visualise cellular structure to better determine areas of dysplasia. Other gastroscopic modalities such as optical coherence tomography are being tested investigationally for similar applications.

A number of cutaneous conditions are associated with gastric cancer. A condition of darkened hyperplasia of the skin, frequently of the axilla and groin, known as acanthosis nigricans, is associated with intra-abdominal cancers such as gastric cancer. Other cutaneous manifestations of gastric cancer include &quot;tripe palms&quot; (a similar darkening hyperplasia of the skin of the palms) and the Leser-Trelat sign, which is the rapid development of skin lesions known as seborrheic keratoses.

Various blood tests may be done, including a complete blood count to check for anaemia, and a fecal occult blood test to check for blood in the stool.

===Histopathology===

* &quot;Gastric adenocarcinoma&quot; is a malignant epithelial tumour, originating from glandular epithelium of the gastric mucosa. Stomach cancers are about 90% adenocarcinomas. Histologically, there are two major types of gastric adenocarcinoma (Lauren classification): intestinal type or diffuse type. Adenocarcinomas tend to aggressively invade the gastric wall, infiltrating the muscularis mucosae, the submucosa and then the muscularis propria. Intestinal type adenocarcinoma tumour cells describe irregular tubular structures, harbouring pluristratification, multiple lumens, reduced stroma (&quot;back to back&quot; aspect). Often, it associates intestinal metaplasia in neighbouring mucosa. Depending on glandular architecture, cellular pleomorphism and mucosecretion, adenocarcinoma may present 3 degrees of differentiation: well, moderate and poorly differentiated. Diffuse type adenocarcinoma (mucinous, colloid, linitis plastica or leather-bottle stomach) tumour cells are discohesive and secrete mucus, which is delivered in the interstitium, producing large pools of mucus/colloid (optically &quot;empty&quot; spaces). It is poorly differentiated. In signet ring cell carcinomas, the mucus remains inside the tumour cell and pushes the nucleus to the periphery, giving rise to signet-ring cells.
* Around 5% of gastric cancers are lymphomas. These may include extranodal marginal zone B-cell lymphomas (MALT type) and to a lesser extent diffuse large B-cell lymphomas. MALT type make up about half of stomach lymphomas.
* Carcinoid and stromal tumors may occur.

===Staging===

If cancer cells are found in the tissue sample, the next step is to stage, or find out the extent of the disease. Various tests determine whether the cancer has spread, and if so, what parts of the body are affected. Because stomach cancer can spread to the liver, pancreas, and other organs near the stomach, as well as to the lungs, the doctor may order a CT scan, a PET scan, an endoscopic ultrasound exam, or other tests to check these areas. Blood tests for tumor markers, such as carcinoembryonic antigen and carbohydrate antigen may be ordered, as their levels correlate to extent of metastasis, especially to the liver, and the cure rate.

Staging may not be complete until after surgery. The surgeon removes nearby lymph nodes and possibly samples of tissue from other areas in the abdomen for examination by a pathologist.

The clinical stages of stomach cancer are:
* Stage 0 – Limited to the inner lining of the stomach, it is treatable by endoscopic mucosal resection when found very early (in routine screenings), or otherwise by gastrectomy and lymphadenectomy without need for chemotherapy or radiation.
* Stage I – Penetration to the second or third layers of the stomach (stage 1A) or to the second layer and nearby lymph nodes (stage 1B): Stage 1A is treated by surgery, including removal of the omentum. Stage 1B may be treated with chemotherapy (5-fluorouracil) and radiation therapy.
* Stage II – Penetration to the second layer and more distant lymph nodes, or the third layer and only nearby lymph nodes, or all four layers but not the lymph nodes, it is treated as for stage I, sometimes with additional neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
* Stage III – Penetration to the third layer and more distant lymph nodes, or penetration to the fourth layer and either nearby tissues or nearby or more distant lymph nodes, it is treated as for stage II; a cure is still possible in some cases.
* Stage IV – Cancer has spread to nearby tissues and more distant lymph nodes, or has metastasized to other organs. A cure is very rarely possible at this stage. Some other techniques to prolong life or improve symptoms are used, including laser treatment, surgery, and/or stents to keep the digestive tract open, and chemotherapy by drugs such as 5-fluorouracil, cisplatin, epirubicin, etoposide, docetaxel, oxaliplatin, capecitabine, or irinotecan.

The TNM staging system is also used.

In a study of open-access endoscopy in Scotland, patients were diagnosed 7% in stage I, 17% in stage II, and 28% in stage III. A Minnesota population was diagnosed 10% in stage I, 13% in stage II, and 18% in stage III. However, in a high-risk population in the Valdivia Province of southern Chile, only 5% of patients were diagnosed in the first two stages and 10% in stage III.

==Prevention==
Getting rid of &quot;H. pylori&quot; in those who are infected decreases the risk of stomach cancer. A 2014 meta-analysis of observational studies found that a diet high in fruits, mushrooms, garlic, soybeans, and green onions was associated with a lower risk of stomach cancer in the Korean population. Low doses of vitamins, especially from a healthy diet, decrease the risk of stomach cancer. A previous review of antioxidant supplementation did not find supporting evidence and possibly worse outcomes. Modern technology is used to promote early diagnosis, e.g. based on serum markers.

==Management==
Cancer of the stomach is difficult to cure unless it is found at an early stage (before it has begun to spread). Unfortunately, because early stomach cancer causes few symptoms, the disease is usually advanced when the diagnosis is made.

Treatment for stomach cancer may include surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy. New treatment approaches such as immunotherapy or gene therapy and improved ways of using current methods are being studied in clinical trials.

===Surgery===

Surgery remains the only curative therapy for stomach cancer. A 2016 Cochrane review found low-quality evidence of no difference in short-term mortality between laparoscopic and open gastrectomy (removal of stomach), and that benefits or harms of laparoscopic gastrectomy cannot be ruled out. Post-operatively, up to 70% of people undergoing total gastrectomy develop complications such as dumping syndrome and reflux esophagitis. Construction of a &quot;pouch&quot;, which serves as a &quot;stomach substitute&quot;, reduced the incidence of dumping syndrome and reflux esophagitis by 73% and 63% respectively, and led to improvements in quality-of-life, nutritional outcomes, and body mass index. Proximal gastrectomy (PG) can be considered a viable alternative for upper third early gastric cancer (EGC) Of the different surgical techniques, endoscopic mucosal resection (EMR) is a treatment for early gastric cancer (tumor only involves the mucosa) that was pioneered in Japan and is available in the United States at some centers. In EMR, the tumor, together with the inner lining of stomach (mucosa), is removed from the wall of the stomach using an electrical wire loop through the endoscope. The advantage is that it is a much smaller operation than removing the stomach. Endoscopic submucosal dissection is a similar technique pioneered in Japan, used to resect a large area of mucosa in one piece. If the pathologic examination of the resected specimen shows incomplete resection or deep invasion by tumor, the patient would need a formal stomach resection. 

Those with metastatic disease at the time of presentation may receive palliative surgery, and while it remains controversial, due to the possibility of complications from the surgery itself and because it may delay chemotherapy, the data so far are mostly positive, with improved survival rates being seen in those treated with this approach.

===Chemotherapy===

The use of chemotherapy to treat stomach cancer has no firmly established standard of care. Unfortunately, stomach cancer has not been particularly sensitive to these drugs, and chemotherapy, if used, has usually served to palliatively reduce the size of the tumor, relieve symptoms of the disease, and increase survival time. Some drugs used in stomach cancer treatment have included: fluorouracil or its analog capecitabine, BCNU (carmustine), methyl-CCNU (semustine) and doxorubicin (Adriamycin), as well as mitomycin C, and more recently cisplatin and taxotere, often using drugs in various combinations. The relative benefits of these different drugs, alone and in combination, are unclear. Clinical researchers are exploring the benefits of giving chemotherapy before surgery to shrink the tumor, or as adjuvant therapy after surgery to destroy remaining cancer cells.

===Targeted therapy===
Treatment with the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) inhibitor trastuzumab has been demonstrated to increase overall survival in inoperable locally advanced or metastatic gastric carcinoma over-expressing the &quot;HER2/neu&quot; gene. In particular, &quot;HER2&quot; is overexpressed in 13–22% of patients with gastric cancer. Of note, &quot;HER2&quot; overexpression in gastric neoplasia is heterogeneous and comprises a minority of tumor cells (less than 10% of gastric cancers overexpress &quot;HER2&quot; in more than 5% of tumor cells). Hence, this heterogeneous expression should be taken into account for &quot;HER2&quot; testing, particularly in small samples such as biopsies, requiring the evaluation of more than one bioptic sample.

A recent clinical study reported promising results for a combination therapy using nivolumab and catequentinib (anlotinib) in the treatment of advanced gastric adenocarcinoma (GAC) and esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), that improve the immune response against cancer while simultaneously slowing tumor progression. The research, conducted by Zhongshan Hospital, Fudan University, and BGI Genomics, was published in &quot;Nature Communications&quot; in October 2024. The study evaluated the efficacy of combining Nivolumab, an immunotherapy that enhances the immune system&#x27;s ability to attack cancer cells, with anlotinib hydrochloride, a drug that inhibits tumor angiogenesis by blocking signals essential for the growth of new blood vessels.

===Radiation===

Radiation therapy (also called radiotherapy) may be used to treat stomach cancer, often as an adjuvant to chemotherapy and/or surgery.

===Lymphoma===
MALT lymphomas are often completely resolved after the underlying &quot;H. pylori&quot; infection is treated. This results in remission in about 80% of cases.

==Prognosis==
The prognosis of stomach cancer is generally poor, because the tumor has often metastasized by the time of discovery, and most people with the condition are elderly (median age is between 70 and 75 years) at presentation. The average life expectancy after being diagnosed is around 24 months, and the five-year survival rate for stomach cancer is less than 10%.

Almost 300 genes are related to outcomes in stomach cancer, with both unfavorable genes where high expression is related to poor survival and favorable genes where high expression is associated with longer survival times. Examples of poor prognosis genes include ITGAV, DUSP1 and P2RX7.

==Epidemiology==

In 2018, stomach cancer was the fifth most frequently diagnosed cancer worldwide, representing 5.7% of all cancer cases, and the third leading cause of death from cancers, being responsible for 8.2% of all cancer deaths. Among men, 683 754 cases were diagnosed, accounting for 7.2% of all cancer cases, and among women, stomach cancer was diagnosed in 349 947 cases, accounting for 4.1% of all cancer cases.

In 2012, stomach cancer was the fifth most-common cancer with 952,000 cases diagnosed. It is more common both in men and in developing countries. In 2012, it represented 8.5% of cancer cases in men, making it the fourth most-common cancer in men. Also in 2012, the number of deaths was 700,000, having decreased slightly from 774,000 in 1990, making it the third-leading cause of cancer-related death (after lung cancer and liver cancer).

Less than 5% of stomach cancers occur in people under 40 years of age, with 81.1% of that 5% in the age-group of 30 to 39 and 18.9% in the age-group of 20 to 29.

In 2014, stomach cancer resulted in 0.61% of deaths (13,303 cases) in the United States. In China, stomach cancer accounted for 3.56% of all deaths (324,439 cases). The highest rate of stomach cancer was in Mongolia, at 28 cases per 100,000 people.

In the United Kingdom, stomach cancer is the 15th most-common cancer (around 7,100 people were diagnosed with stomach cancer in 2011), and it is the 10th most-common cause of cancer-related deaths (around 4,800 people died in 2012).

Incidence and mortality rates of gastric cancer vary greatly in Africa. The GLOBOCAN system is currently the most widely used method to compare these rates between countries, but African incidence and mortality rates are seen to differ among countries, possibly due to the lack of universal access to a registry system for all countries. Variation as drastic as estimated rates from 0.3/100000 in Botswana to 20.3/100000 in Mali have been observed. In Uganda, the incidence of gastric cancer has increased from the 1960s measurement of 0.8/100000 to 5.6/100000. Gastric cancer, though present, is relatively low when compared to countries with high incidence like Japan and China. One suspected cause of the variation within Africa and between other countries is due to different strains of the &quot;H. pylori&quot; bacteria. The trend commonly seen is that &quot;H. pylori &quot;infection increases the risk for gastric cancer, but this is not the case in Africa, giving this phenomenon the name the &quot;African enigma&quot;. Although this bacterial species is found in Africa, evidence has supported that different strains with mutations in the bacterial genotype may contribute to the difference in cancer development between African countries and others outside the continent. Increasing access to health care and treatment measures have been commonly associated with the rising incidence, though, particularly in Uganda.

==Other animals==

The stomach is a muscular organ of the gastrointestinal tract that holds food and begins the digestive process by secreting gastric juice. The most common cancers of the stomach are adenocarcinomas, but other histological types have been reported. Signs vary, but may include vomiting (especially if blood is present), weight loss, anemia, and lack of appetite. Bowel movements may be dark and tarry in nature. To determine whether cancer is present in the stomach, special X-rays and/or abdominal ultrasounds may be performed. Gastroscopy, a test using an endoscope to examine the stomach, is a useful diagnostic tool that can also take samples of the suspected mass for histopathological analysis to confirm or rule out cancer. The most definitive method of cancer diagnosis is through open surgical biopsy. Most stomach tumors are malignant with evidence of spread to lymph nodes or liver, making treatment difficult. Except for lymphoma, surgery is the most frequent treatment option for stomach cancers but it is associated with significant risks.

A carcinogenic interaction was demonstrated between bile acids and &quot;Helicobacter pylori&quot; in a mouse model of gastric cancer.

<text>The Nervii or Nervians were one of the most powerful Belgic tribes of northern Gaul at the time of its conquest by Rome. Their territory corresponds to the central part of modern Belgium, including Brussels, and stretched southwards to Cambrai in French Hainaut. During their first century BC Roman military campaign, Julius Caesar&#x27;s contacts among the Remi stated that the Nervii were the most warlike of the Belgae. In times of war, they were known to trek long distances to take part in battles. Being one of the northerly Belgic tribes, with the Menapii to the west, and the Eburones to their east, they were considered by Caesar to be relatively uncorrupted by civilization. According to Tacitus they claimed Germanic descent. According to Strabo they were of Germanic origin.

== Name ==
They are mentioned as &quot;Nervii&quot; by Caesar (mid-1st c. BC) and Orosius (early fifth c. AD), &quot;Neroúioi&quot; (Νερούιοι) by Strabo (early first c. AD), &quot;Nerui&quot; by Pliny (1st c. AD) and the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; (5th c. AD), &quot;Nervios&quot; by Tacitus (early second c. AD), and as &quot;Neroúsioi&quot; (Νερούσιοι) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD).

The ethnonym &quot;Nervii&quot; probably stems from the Western Indo-European root *&quot;ner&quot;-, meaning &#x27;man&#x27; (cf. Middle Welsh &quot;ner&quot; &#x27;lord, chief&#x27;). It appears to be cognate with the Latin cognomen &quot;Nerva&quot;.

==Territory==

According to Xavier Deru, the core region of the Nervii was equivalent to the medieval &quot;pagus&quot; of Hainaut, the region of the Haine river, the upper Sambre, and greater and lesser Helpe rivers. To the north of the Haine, it also included what would become the medieval &quot;pagus&quot; of Brabant, making its northwestern border on the Scheldt (French &quot;Escaut&quot;, Dutch &quot;Schelde&quot;) river. A large population occupied the southern territories, near the river Sambre with the biggest being at Avesnelles, near Avesnes-sur-Helpe.

An oppidum found near Asse may have belonged to them but it was isolated and near to the territory of the Menapii. In the south the Nervians stretched no further than the forests of Arrouaise and Thiérache South of them were the Viromandui, south of Cambrai, and the Remi. Deru proposes that the region or &quot;pagus&quot; of Cambrai in the southwest was relatively undeveloped until Roman times.
To the east, based upon medieval boundaries it is likely that the Nervii&#x27;s territories stretched to the Dyle and the Eau d&#x27;Heure. Some of this territory especially in the north may have been added to the district during Roman times according to Deru. The &quot;civitas&quot; of the Nervii did not include Louvain or Namur.

Caesar also mentions smaller tribes who were expected to contribute troops to Nervian forces; Levaci, Pleumoxii, Geidumni, Ceutrones, and Grudii. None of these can be convincingly located.

In the Middle Ages, Hainaut was sometimes still referred to as the county of the Nervians (&quot;comitatus nerviensis&quot;) in medieval Latin, and when this came to be politically united with mainly Dutch speaking Brabant again, the counties were still distinguished in the official Latin titles (&quot;comitatus Nerviensis Bracbatensis&quot;).

Today, Hainaut is divided between France and Belgium. To its north, parts of the modern Belgian provinces of Antwerp, East Flanders, Flemish Brabant and French-speaking Walloon Brabant include the rest of the old Nervian territory.

==Language==
Although it is often assumed that the Nervii spoke a Celtic language, the evidence regarding their linguistic affiliation is inconclusive. The same applies to other Belgian tribes, like the Menapii and Morini, to the west of the Nervii on the English Channel, and the &quot;Germani cisrhenani&quot; to the east of the Nervii, stretching to the Rhine.

Caesar writes that the Belgae generally had received immigration from Germanic people from east of the Rhine. The Romanized Greek Strabo wrote that the Nervii were of Germanic origin. Tacitus, in his book &quot;Germania&quot;, says that in his time the Nervii and Treveri both claimed Germanic ancestry, similar to that of their mutual neighbours the Tungri, in order to distinguish them from the weaknesses of the Gauls.

The Romans were not precise in their ethnography of northern barbarians: by &quot;Germanic&quot; Caesar may simply have meant &quot;originating east of the Rhine&quot; with no distinction of language intended. During Caesar&#x27;s lifetime, Germanic languages east of the Rhine may have been no closer than the river Elbe. It has instead been argued based on place name studies that the older language of the area, though apparently Indo-European, was also not Celtic (see Nordwestblock) and that Celtic, though influential amongst the elite, might never have been the main language of the part of the Belgic area north of the Ardennes. On the other hand, these same studies of placenames such as those of Maurits Gysseling, have also shown evidence of Germanic languages entering the Belgic area north of the Ardennes, before the Roman conquest, while strong evidence for old Celtic place names is found in the Ardennes and to the south of them. Luc van Durme summarizes competing evidence of Celtic and Germanic influence at the time of Caesar by saying that &quot;one has to accept the rather remarkable conclusion that Caesar must have witnessed a situation opposing Celtic and Germanic in Belgium, in a territory slightly more to the south than the early medieval Romance–Germanic language border&quot;, but van Durme also accepts that &quot;second century BC Germanisation did not block the celtisation coming from the south . . . but that both phenomena were simultaneous and interfering instead&quot;.

The &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; reports that the Nervii were a Gaulish tribe.

==Culture==
Julius Caesar considered the Nervii to be the most warlike of the Belgic tribes, and that the Belgic tribes were the bravest in Gaul. He says that their culture was a Spartan one: they would not partake of alcoholic beverages or any other such luxury, feeling that the mind must remain clear to be brave. He also says they disliked foreign trade and neither had a merchant class nor would permit merchants within their territory.

Archaeologists have sought to define the territories of the northern Belgic tribes by looking at the coins they used. The Nervii are associated with a stater type that uses a Greek epsilon.

Remarkably, given the archaeological evidence of a Celtic La Tène culture having been present in the pre-Roman past, Caesar reports that the Nervii had no cavalry. In fact they established hedges throughout their lands in order to make them difficult for cavalry.

The Frasnes hoard, accidentally unearthed by foresters in 1864 near Frasnes-lez-Buissenal in Hainaut, along with coins associated with the Morini and the Nervii, also contained characteristically Gallic gold torques, one of which was in Alastair Bradley Martin&#x27;s Guennol collection.

==Gallic Wars==
The Nervii were part of the Belgic alliance that resisted Julius Caesar in 57 BC. After the alliance broke up and some tribes surrendered, the Nervii, under the command of Boduognatus and aided by the Atrebates and Viromandui, came very close to defeating Caesar (the Atuatuci had also agreed to join them but did not arrive in time). In 57 BC at the battle of the Sabis (now identified as the river Selle, near modern Saulzoir; previously identified as the Sambre), they concealed themselves in the forests and attacked the approaching Roman column at the river. Their attack was so quick and unexpected that some of the Romans didn&#x27;t have time to take the covers off their shields or even put on their helmets. The element of surprise briefly left the Romans exposed. However Caesar grabbed a shield, made his way to the front line, and quickly organised his forces; at the same time, the commander of the tenth legion, Titus Labienus, attacked the Nervian camp. The two legions who had been guarding the baggage train at the rear arrived and helped to turn the tide of the battle. Caesar says the Nervii were almost annihilated in the battle and is effusive in his tribute to their bravery, calling them &quot;heroes&quot;.

When Ambiorix and the Eburones rebelled in 53 BC, the remaining Nervii joined the uprising and besieged Quintus Tullius Cicero – brother of the orator – and his legion in their winter camp until they were relieved by Caesar in person. They were able to rapidly build a rampart around the Roman fortification, using only swords to dig, &quot;in less than three hours they completed a fortification of ten miles in circumference; and during the rest of the days they began to prepare and construct towers of the height of the ramparts, and grappling irons, and mantelets&quot;. Caesar reported that this technique was learned from the Romans, and under the advisor of captured Roman soldiers. 
On the seventh day of the attack, a very high wind having sprung up, they began to discharge by their slings hot balls made of burned or hardened clay, and heated javelins, upon the huts, which, after the Gallic custom, were thatched with straw. These quickly took fire, and by the violence of the wind, scattered their flames in every part of the camp.
The situation was recovered when a Nervian in the Roman camp was able to send a slave with a message, who managed to remain inconspicuous and get it to Caesar. Caesar was able to amass forces and defeat some of the Nervians.

The Nervii and their allies, the Aduatuci, Eburones, Treveri and Menapii continued to prepare for war with the Romans, and sought assistance from the Germanic peoples east of the Rhine. The Roman struck a significant blow when they killed the Treveran king Indutiomarus. Soon after:
Accordingly, while the winter was not yet ended, having concentrated the four nearest legions, he marched unexpectedly into the territories of the Nervii, and before they could either assemble or retreat, after capturing a large number of cattle and of men, and wasting their lands and giving up that booty to the soldiers, compelled them to enter into a surrender and give him hostages.

In the final phase of Caesar&#x27;s war in Gaul, the Nervii were called upon to contribute to the large allied force of Vercingetorix which amassed at Alesia, but these were defeated in the Battle of Alesia.

==Roman period==

During the Roman era, the original chief city of the Nervian civitas was at Bagacum, (Gaulish: &quot;Bāgācon&quot;, from &quot;bagos&quot; &#x27;beech&#x27;). The city was founded to the south of the traditional Nervian territory and is now known as Bavay, a town in France near the Belgian border. The forum has been excavated. The town was founded in c.30 BC and rapidly became a centre of Roman civilization. Towns belonging to the Nervian territory were &quot;Fanum Martis&quot; (Famars), and Geminiacum (Liberchies).

The Nervians were well known for the export of grain; an interesting tombstone of a &quot;frumentarius&quot; was excavated as far away as Nijmegen. They also produced ceramics (&quot;terra nigra&quot;).

Inscriptions found on artifacts recovered at Rough Castle Fort along the Antonine Wall across the Central Belt of Scotland indicate that in the second century the fort was the base for 500 men of the Sixth Cohort of Nervii, an infantry unit. According to Tacitus, the Nervians also served in cohorts based along the Rhine border. Altars found at the Roman fort of Whitley Castle in Northumberland, also known as Epiacum, bear inscriptions showing that the Second Nervians were garrisoned at the fort. Two sandstones uncovered at Bainbridge, record the Roman construction of a fort at Brough Hill in the third century. An inscription on a tablet indicated that the fort was built by the Sixth Cohort, under the charge of Gaius Valerius Pudens, a senator of consular rank.

At some point probably after the disastrous attacks by the Franks in 260-275 AD, a new chief city was designated at Camaracum (Cambrai), further south than Bavay, and Bavay itself, and the main road it was on, became part of a new secondary fortified border zone. The northern part of Nervian territory, was eventually settled by Germanic groups, while the southern part, the southern part of medieval Brabant, and medieval Hainaut, remained more Romanized. By 432 it seems the Franks had penetrated into the country of the Romanized Nervians and had been taken over by the Franks. Their king Childeric I was buried in Tournai. The medieval Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cambrai continued to cover the same approximate area as the Roman &quot;civitas&quot; until 1559.

One likely difference between the Roman and medieval boundaries is that the north-eastern part of the archdiocese, the deanery of Antwerp east of the river Rupel may have been a medieval attachment.

==In popular culture==
The Nervii and their western neighbours the Menapii are the main subjects of the comic book &quot;Asterix in Belgium&quot;. In it, a competition between the Belgians and the Gauls from Armorica takes place to decide who was the bravest, under the unlikely adjudication of Julius Caesar.

The Nervii are featured in the video game &quot;Total War: Rome II&quot;.

<text>Route 143 is a state highway in Camden County, New Jersey, United States. It is a short route in Winslow Township, running along Spring Garden Road between Cedarbrook Road and White Horse Pike (US 30). The route&#x27;s southern terminus is at an intersection with County Route 561 (CR 561) and CR 726 in Winslow Township. The route heads along the old alignment of New Jersey Route 43, intersecting with US 30 and ending a short distance afterward, where it continues as CR 716.

The use of this route number reflects the former designation of the White Horse Pike as Route 43. Route 43 itself, dates back to the original state highway system in New Jersey, which it was designated as State Highway Route 3. The route was renumbered 43 in the 1927 state highway renumbering, using most of US 30 for its alignment. The route remained intact until 1953, when another renumbering occurred, decommissioning Route 43 entirely. The highway was revived in a short portion in 1955, receiving a designation in 1989.

==Route description==

Route 143 begins at CR 561 and CR 726 in Winslow Township. Known as Spring Garden Road, it proceeds north-northeast through wooded residential areas. The route crosses Conrail Shared Assets Operations&#x27; Beesleys Point Secondary railroad line before intersecting Woodland Drive. From this point, the road passes to the east of the Ancora Psychiatric Hospital and intersects Center Drive before coming to Lake Drive. Following this intersection, it passes between several small sized lakes within heavily forested areas before heading through some farm fields. Here, the road intersects CR 721 (East Central Avenue). A short distance later, Route 143 crosses US 30 and continues for a little bit to the end of state maintenance. At this point, the road becomes CR 716 and continues north.

==History==

The earliest possible evidence of state maintenance of Spring Garden Road came in 1955, when a portion of highway called Route 43 was contracted to be rebuilt north of a crossing with the Pennsylvania Railroad as Section 11E of the highway. However, no maps from then up to its designation as Route 143 in 1989 showed the highway being under state maintenance; in 1965, the road was shown to be designated as an extension of CR 726. Two explanations have been proposed for this discrepancy: either the highway referred to was US 30, which had been designated NJ 43 until 1953, or the highway was reverted to local maintenance soon after its reconstruction. The route received its designation of Route 143 on June 14, 1989 when the State Legislature approved the new designation.

<doc id="261616" wikidata="Q220379" url="?curid=261616" title="Adriatic Veneti">
<text>The Veneti (sometimes also referred to as Venetici, Ancient Veneti or Paleoveneti to distinguish them from the modern-day inhabitants of the Veneto region, called &quot;Veneti&quot; in Italian) were an Indo-European people who inhabited northeastern Italy, in an area corresponding to the modern-day region of Veneto, from the middle of the 2nd millennium BC and developing their own original civilization along the 1st millennium BC.

The Veneti were initially attested in the area between Lake Garda and the Euganean Hills; later they expanded until they reached borders similar to those of the current Veneto region. According to the archaeological finds (which also agree with the written sources), the western borders of their territory ran along Lake Garda, the southern ones followed a line that starts from the Tartaro river, follows the Po and reaches Adria, along the extinct branch of the Po of Adria, while the eastern ones reached up to the Tagliamento river.

==Ethnonym==
According to Julius Pokorný, the ethnonym &quot;Venetī&quot; (singular &quot;*Venetos&quot;) is derived from Proto Indo-European root &quot;*wen-&quot; &#x27;to strive, to wish for, to love&#x27;. As shown by the comparative material, Germanic languages had two terms of different origin: Old High German &quot;Winida&quot; &#x27;Wende&#x27; points to Pre-Germanic &quot;*Wenétos&quot;, while Lat.-Germ. &quot;Venedi&quot; (as attested in Tacitus) and Old English &quot;Winedas&quot; &#x27;Wends&#x27; call for Pre-Germanic &quot;*Wenetós&quot;. The latter, according to Tacitus, who would have been familiar with Adriatic Veneti, connects the Vistula Veneti with the Slavs. Etymologically related words include Latin &quot;venus, -eris&quot; &#x27;love, passion, grace&#x27;; Sanskrit &quot;vanas-&quot; &#x27;lust, zest&#x27;, &quot;vani-&quot; &#x27;wish, desire&#x27;; Old Irish &quot;fine&quot; (&lt; Proto-Celtic &quot;*venjā&quot;) &#x27;kinship, kinfolk, alliance, tribe, family&#x27;; Old Norse &quot;vinr&quot;, Old Saxon, Old High German &quot;wini&quot;, Old Frisian, Old English &quot;wine&quot; &#x27;friend&#x27;.

==Language==

The ancient Veneti spoke Venetic, an extinct Indo-European language which is evidenced in approximately 300 short inscriptions dating from the 6th to 1st centuries BC. Venetic appears to share several similarities with Latin and the other Italic languages, but also has some affinities with other Indo-European languages, especially Germanic and Celtic.

Venetic should not be confused with Venetian, a Romance language presently spoken in the Veneto region.

==Geography==
The extent of the territory occupied by the ancient Veneti before their incorporation by the Romans is uncertain. It included cities of the modern Veneto such as Este, Padua, Vicenza, Asolo, Oderzo, Montebelluna, Vittorio Veneto, Cadore, as well as other areas around the Po Delta. Venetic territory was incorporated into Cisalpine Gaul, and under Augustus was organized as the tenth region (&quot;Regio X&quot; Venetia et Histria) of Roman Italy. &quot;Regio X&quot; stretched geographically from the Arsia River in the east in what is now Croatia to the Abdua in the current Italian region of Lombardy and from the Alps to the Adriatic Sea.

==History==
===Classical sources===
Herodotus (c. 484–425 BC) at one point mentions the Veneti of the Adriatic (&quot;Histories&quot; V.9) and at another refers in passing to the &quot;Eneti in Illyria&quot; (&quot;Histories&quot; I.196) whose supposed marriage customs, he claims, mirrored those of the Babylonians. This led early scholars to seek to link the Veneti with the Illyrians. Their Illyrian origin is further strengthened by their close relationship with the inhabitants of the coastal regions of the Adriatic. Karl Pauli, a late 19th-century expert on the Venetic language, declared that the language was more closely related to that of the Illyrians than to any other language, even though knowledge of Venetic is limited to personal names, nouns, and verbs used in dedicatory formulae. There are even fewer remains of an Illyrian language which have been connected to the region and may indicate an Illyrian. However, this identification of the Adriatic Veneti as Illyrians has been discredited by many linguists. Hans Krahe and later Anton Mayer showed that Herodotus was not referring to the Adriatic Veneti, but to an Illyrian tribe that lived in the borderlands of northern historical Macedonia. Later linguistic and paleontological studies further solidified their findings.

Roman historian Titus Livius (59 BC–AD 17), himself a native of the Venetic town of Patavium, wrote that after the fall of Troy, the Trojan prince Antenor became the leader of the Paphlagonians after they all had been expelled from their homeland. Together, they migrated to the northern end of the Adriatic coast where they established a settlement, and conquered and merged with indigenous people known as the Euganei. The story connects the Veneti with the Paphlagonian Eneti, mentioned by Homer (750 BC).

Virgil (70-19 BC), in his epic the &quot;Aeneid&quot;, relates the same tradition. A commentary on Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Aeneid&quot; by the grammarian Maurus Servius Honoratus (fl. c. AD 400) is said to imply a link between the Veneti and the Vindelici who are related to Liburnians from the Istrian Coast. However, the reference to the Veneti in Virgil seems to place them in the &quot;innermost realm of the Liburnians&quot; which must have been the goal at which Antenor is said to have arrived. This however implies only that the ancient Liburnians may have once encompassed a wide swath of the Eastern Alps, from Vindelicia, through Noricum, to the Dalmatian coast before the coming of the Veneti.
Pliny the Elder (AD 23–79) mentions that Cornelius Nepos (100–24 BC) implied that the Paphlagonian Eneti (&quot;Heneti&quot;) were ancestors of the Veneti of Italy. He lists the towns of Ateste, Acelum, Patavium, Opitergium, Belunum, and Vicetia as belonging to the Veneti.

The Greek historian Strabo (64 BC–AD 24), on the other hand, conjectured that the Adriatic Veneti descended from Celts who in turn were related to the later Celtic tribe of the same name who lived on the coast of Brittany and fought against Julius Caesar. He further suggested that the identification of the Adriatic Veneti with the Paphlagonian Enetoi led by Antenor—which he attributes to Sophocles (496–406 BC)—was a mistake due to the similarity of the names. Strabo also gives information on the then-current domains of the Veneti.

===Pre-Roman period===
The territory of the Veneti came to the notice of the Greeks in the 4th c. BC. Strabo records that Dionysius I of Syracuse (c. 432–367 BC), desiring the famed horses of the Veneti, founded trading colonies along the Adriatic coast. The Sicilian tyrant favored the town of Adria as a trading partner, helping it build canals which linked it to the sea and broke the trading monopoly of Spina.

In 303/302 BC the Lacedaemonian prince Cleonymus of Sparta led a fleet of mercenaries up the Brenta River intending on sacking Patavium. However, the Veneti fought back and the Spartan ships were captured and destroyed.

The Veneti were in recurring conflict with the Celtic peoples who then occupied most of Northwestern Italy, although they maintained peaceful relations with the Cenomani Celts who had settled in and eventually absorbed the areas of Brescia and Verona.

===Roman period===
The Veneti seem to have begun contact with Rome in the third century BC. They established &quot;amicitia&quot; with Rome against the Gauls  BC. During the Second Punic War, the Veneti were again allied with the Romans against the Celts, Iberians, and the Carthaginian expedition (218–203 BC) led by Hannibal. Livy records that they sent soldiers to fight along with the Romans at the battle of Cannae.

With the foundation of the Latin colony of Aquileia by Rome in 181 BC and laying of the Via Postumia in 148 BC followed by the Via Annia in 131 BC, Roman influence among the Veneti increased. The Veneti seem to have voluntarily and gradually adopted the Latin language, Roman architecture, Roman city planning, and Roman religion. Votive offerings sometimes appear in the Venetic language written with the Roman alphabet or in Venetic with a Latin translation.
Roman consuls were asked to adjudicate border disputes between Este and Padua in 141 and again in 135 BC and also a border dispute between Este and Vicenza. In 175 BC, Padua requested the aid of Rome in putting down a local civil war. The Veneti were given Latin rights after the Social War in the Lex Pompeia de Transpadanis and Roman citizenship in 49 BC in the Lex Roscia. Roman colonies established at Este, Concordia, and Trieste between 49 BC and 14 AD and at Oderzo and Zuglio during the reign of Claudius further contributed to the absorption of the Veneti into Roman culture.

== Beliefs ==
The equivalent of Apollo was Belenus in Veneto and Noricum. He had an oracle in the city of Aquileia and was worshipped as the divine protector of the town. Belenus was also connected with springs, which may suggest chthonic and medicinal powers. Belenus was most likely of Celtic origin, and the dominant god of the Norici.

==Archaeology==

===Periodization===
===Findings===
Information about Venetic society can be deduced from artifacts, tombs, and religious votive objects. There were village heads. Wealthy landowners were buried with amber jewelry. The Veneti traded actively on the Amber Road.

There were horsemen and fishermen, and members involved in animal husbandry. In the 7th century BC merchants at Este used bronze coins, while by the 3rd century BC silver money was in use, especially at Padua. Farmers cultivated grain and grapes. Artisans produced ceramic and bronze objects, and wove wool cloth. Artifacts show that among the sports enjoyed were boxing and boat races.

==Studies==
Many archaeological excavations are still under way in the Veneto today at sites such as Este, Padua, Oderzo, Adria, Vicenza, Verona and Altinum. Studies have explored the vast influence of the Greeks in the Adriatic and their interaction with the Veneti, particularly focusing on the Euboeans, Phocaeans and Corinthians. Furthermore, studies have also been done on Etruscan activity in the region and their strong links to the Veneti.

Modern surveys on the Veneti and other Ancient Italic peoples, including the Venetic inscriptions from Este, were published by A. L. Prosdocimi, A. M. C. Bianchi and L. Capuis.

===Related tribes===
Other tribes originally thought to have been Illyrians and shown to be actually related to the Veneti are: Histri, Carni, Catari, Catali, Liburni, Lopsi, Secusses, Venetulani.

Housing and population more than doubled in the 20 years following World War II, a period of major conversion of land from agriculture and woodland to housing across the region following the incendiary bombing of Portsmouth and the Blitz.

The old centre of the town was a small Celtic settlement before Roman times and the town&#x27;s commerce, retired and commuter population swelled after World War II so as to be usually considered economically part of the Portsmouth conurbation.

==History==
Archeological digs in the 19th and 20th centuries uncovered evidence of Roman buildings – near St Faith&#x27;s Church and in Langstone Avenue, along with neolithic and mesolithic remains.

Havant was known around 935 CE as &#x27;Hamafunta&#x27; (the spring of Hama), referring to the spring to the south-west of St Faith&#x27;s Churchyard and a settlement was made at the crossing point of tracks from the Downs to the coast and another east–west along the coast.

In 1086 (at the time of the Domesday Book), Havant was a village with a population of around 100. In 1200, the monks of Winchester Cathedral were granted the right to hold a market at Haveunte. Around 1450, an annual fair was held on the feast of Saint Faith.

For much of its history water played a vital part in local commerce, with many water mills, and parchment manufacture and brewing.

Much of Havant was destroyed by fire in 1760, leaving only the church and the adjacent late 16th or early 17th century cottages. The cottages are now known collectively as &quot;The Old House at Home&quot;, and are used as a pub. It is claimed that the two main beams in the lounge bar were recovered from the Spanish Armada, and that the &quot;Bear Post&quot; within once had the last dancing bear in England tethered to it. The fire allowed widening of roads and easier passage of stagecoaches through the town: the Bear Hotel and Dolphin Hotel were notable coaching inns. In the early hours of 25 October 1784 Havant suffered a minor earthquake, and a similar event occurred on 30 November 1811.

Hall Place, on South Street is a grade II-listed house, larger than others in the four main streets. It was rebuilt in 1796 by John Butler, replacing a seventeenth-century house reputed to have been built with stone from the slighted Warblington Castle. The classically Georgian house, of buff colour bricks from Dorset, passed in the 1820s into the ownership of Mr Charles Beare Longcroft, solicitor of established civic fame, whose wife&#x27;s grandfather, John Cressweller (or Crassweller), had purchased the house from John Butler in 1803 and whose family parted with it in the middle of the 20th century.

Early English in style, the oldest undisturbed parts of the church of St Faith, such as the chancel, date from the early 13th century. Some of the foundations are believed to date from Roman times. The vestry is 14th century and there is a monumental brass to William Aylward, 1413.

By 1768 Havant had its first postmaster trading from various offices until the present post office in East Street opened in 1936 (one of a handful in the UK with the cypher of King Edward VIII above the entrance). In 1976 a Royal Mail Christmas postage stamp depicted an angel design from a medieval embroidery in the Victoria and Albert Museum owned by the Victorian-established Catholic Mission in the Brockhampton neighbourhood.

In 1847 Havant was connected with a station on the railway to Portsmouth and Brighton via Chichester and this was followed by the Portsmouth Direct Line to London in 1859. The branch line to Hayling Island ran from 1867 until the mid-1960s rationalisation.

The first hospital in the town opened in 1894 in Potash Terrace as a fever hospital, closing in 1939. A war memorial hospital opened in 1929 in Crossway; in 1935 a fine frieze of Wedgwood tiles depicting nursery rhymes was added to the children&#x27;s ward.

The resident population rose in &#x27;Havant and Waterloo Urban District&#x27; from 26,367 in 1939 to 74,552 for this direct predecessor to the borough in 1961. The rate of population increase has decreased since 1961 but population approximately doubled in the 50 years to 2011, with less cultivated land and fewer housing schemes and little non-hillside or direct coastal land available for development.

==Geography==
The old centre of the town is on a classic crossroad configuration, with the four streets being named North Street, East Street, South Street and West Street, and St Faith&#x27;s Church at the crossing. One axis is a known Roman road and a few artefacts along the route point to the other also being so.

The major A27 road with various crossings sections off the coastal village suburbs of Langstone and the south of Bedhampton. Its north is Leigh Park, a three-ward suburb originally of council housing laid out before 1960 through the co-operation of the local and Portsmouth authorities (the other designated area being Paulsgrove occupying west Cosham), beyond which is Staunton Country Park in the South Downs National Park. To the east is Emsworth, another town which is contiguous with Havant. To the west is Portsdown Hill and part of Bedhampton. The A3(M) passes to the west.

There are several natural springs in the area, including one a short distance south-west of the church on West Street at the end of Homewell. This used to be the home of the premier parchment making facility in Southern England (closing in 1936) which later became a glove making factory and leather processing plant. The Treaty of Versailles was written on Havant parchment.

==Demography==
==Economy==

The town&#x27;s commerce, retired and commuter population swelled after World War II so as to be usually considered economically part of the Portsmouth conurbation, its part closest to the Brighton-Worthing-Littlehampton conurbation, as at the 2011 census, in population, within the 20 largest conurbations in the UK.

The main shopping centre is called Meridian Shopping (formerly known as the Meridian Centre), as well as a pedestrianised section of West Street. The old town hall now houses The Spring Arts &amp; Heritage Centre (formerly known as Havant Arts Centre). Havant is home to the local community radio station, Angel Radio which specialises in music of the pre-1960s era.

==Transport==

The multi-bay Havant town bus station is located adjacent the Meridian Shopping Centre and 0.3 km south—west of the railway station. The primary operator is Stagecoach South with services to Portsmouth, Hayling Island, Leigh Park, Waterlooville, Petersfield, Emsworth, and Chichester. The council-run 27 route is also provided by Stagecoach South covering Emsworth, Leigh Park, and Rowlands Castle.

The railway station is on north street with the current buildings dating from 1938. It is served by direct and frequent trains to London Waterloo and Portsmouth Harbour. 

==Education==
Although there had been private schools before, it was not until the 1870 Education Act that Havant gained its first state schools – one in Brockhampton Lane, followed by one in West Street and then in Fairfield Road. The town gained another school in the form of Bosmere Junior School in 1985.

In 2017 Havant College and South Downs College merged to form Havant and South Downs College.

==Sport==

The town&#x27;s senior non-league football side is Havant &amp; Waterlooville F.C., On 16 January 2008 they reached the fourth round of the FA Cup for the first time in their history, beating Swansea City 4–2 in a third-round replay, setting up a 4th round match against Liverpool at Anfield, which they went on to lose 5–2 despite having led twice in the first half. 

The town is represented by Havant RFC (founded 1951) for rugby and Havant HC (founded 1905) are three times winners of the English Hockey League. The latter contributed several players to the British Olympic gold medal-winning side of 1988. Havant Hockey Club also contributed two players to the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne. The astroturf was provided by the National Lottery Fund. The town has a successful amateur cricket club (founded 1876), which has attracted a number of first-class cricketers. Havant Cricket Club have won the Southern Premier Cricket League in 2000, 2002, 2007, 2008 and 2009. In 2005 Havant Cricket Club reached the semi-finals of the Cockspur Cup.

Havant is also home to a rifle and pistol club which was the training venue for a member named Malcolm Cooper who won Olympic Gold at the 1984 Los Angeles Games and the 1988 Seoul Games.

The Avenue (Tennis) Club, Havant has ten lawn tennis championship (LTC)-standard grass courts.

==Places of worship==

The town&#x27;s Church of England church is St. Faith&#x27;s, parts of which date back to the 12th century. The Roman Catholic church is St.Joseph&#x27;s dating from 1875. There is also a United Reformed Church on north street built in 1891.

<doc id="261621" wikidata="Q1256476" url="?curid=261621" title="Rotating magnetic field">
<text>A rotating magnetic field (RMF) is the resultant magnetic field produced by a system of coils symmetrically placed and supplied with polyphase currents. A rotating magnetic field can be produced by a poly-phase (two or more phases) current or by a single phase current provided that, in the latter case, two field windings are supplied and are so designed that the two resulting magnetic fields generated thereby are out of phase.

Rotating magnetic fields are often utilized for electromechanical applications, such as induction motors, electric generators and induction regulators.

==History==

In 1824, the French physicist François Arago formulated the existence of rotating magnetic fields using a rotating copper disk and a needle, termed “Arago&#x27;s rotations.” English experimenters Charles Babbage and John Herschel found they could induce rotation in Arago&#x27;s copper disk by spinning a horseshoe magnet under it, with English scientist Michael Faraday later attributing the effect to electromagnetic induction. In 1879, English physicist Walter Baily replaced the horseshoe magnets with four electromagnets and, by manually turning switches on and off, demonstrated a primitive induction motor.

The idea of a rotating magnetic field in an AC motor was explored by the Italian physicist and electrical engineer Galileo Ferraris and the Serbian-American inventor and electrical engineer Nikola Tesla. Ferraris, who did research about the theory and design of alternating-current machinery, built a working model for a classroom demonstration in 1885, but did not describe it publicly until 1888. Tesla attempted several (unsuccessful) designs and working models through the early 1880s before building a working prototype in 1887 According to Ferraris principle of rotating magnetic field, Friedrich August Haselwander developed the first AC 3 phase generator in 1887. In 1888, Ferraris published his research in a paper to the &quot;Royal Academy of Sciences&quot; in Turin and Tesla obtained a United States patent () for his design. Based on the Haselwander generator, Mikhail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky developed a three-phase generator and motor for the world&#x27;s first three-phase power plant built in 1891 in Frankfurt, Germany.

==Description==
The rotating magnetic field is the key principle in the operation of induction machines. The induction motor consists of a stator and rotor. In the stator a group of fixed windings are so arranged that a two phase current, for example, produces a magnetic field which rotates at an angular velocity determined by the frequency of the alternating current. The rotor or armature consists of coils wound in slots, which are short circuited and in which the changing flux generated by the field poles induce a current. The flux generated by the armature current reacts upon the field poles and the armature is set in rotation in a definite direction.

A symmetric rotating magnetic field can be produced with as few as two polar wound coils driven at 90-degree phasing. However, three sets of coils are nearly always used, because it is compatible with a symmetric three-phase AC sine current system. The three coils are driven with each set 120 degrees in phase from the others. For the purpose of this example, the magnetic field is taken to be the linear function of the coil&#x27;s current.

The result of adding three 120-degree phased sine waves on the axis of the motor is a single rotating vector that always remains constant in magnitude. The rotor has a constant magnetic field. The north pole of the rotor will move toward the south pole of the magnetic field of the stator, and vice versa. This magnetomechanical attraction creates a force that will drive the rotor to follow the rotating magnetic field in a synchronous manner.
A permanent magnet in such a field will rotate so as to maintain its alignment with the external field. This effect was utilized in early alternating-current electric motors. A rotating magnetic field can be constructed using two orthogonal coils with a 90-degree phase difference in their alternating currents. However, in practice, such a system would be supplied through a three-wire arrangement with unequal currents. This inequality would cause serious problems in the standardization of the conductor size. In order to overcome this, three-phase systems are used in which the three currents are equal in magnitude and have a 120-degree phase difference. Three similar coils having mutual geometrical angles of 120 degrees will create the rotating magnetic field in this case. The ability of the three-phase system to create the rotating field utilized in electric motors is one of the main reasons why three-phase systems dominate the world&#x27;s electric power-supply systems.

Rotating magnetic fields are also used in induction motors. Because magnets degrade with time, induction motors use short-circuited rotors (instead of a magnet), which follow the rotating magnetic field of a multicoiled stator. In these motors, the short-circuited turns of the rotor develop eddy currents in the rotating field of the stator, which in turn move the rotor by Lorentz force. These types of motors are not usually synchronous, but instead necessarily involve a degree of &#x27;slip&#x27; in order that the current may be produced due to the relative movement of the field and the rotor.

<doc id="261622" wikidata="Q1790134" url="?curid=261622" title="Krukenberg tumor">
<text>A Krukenberg tumor refers to a malignancy in the ovary that metastasized from a primary site, classically the gastrointestinal tract, although it can arise in other tissues such as the breast. Gastric adenocarcinoma, especially at the pylorus, is the most common source. Krukenberg tumors are often (over 80%) found in both ovaries, consistent with its metastatic nature.

==Signs and symptoms==
Krukenberg tumors often come to the attention when they cause abdominal or pelvic pain, bloating, ascites, or pain during sexual intercourse. Krukenberg tumors can occasionally provoke a reaction of the ovarian stroma which leads to hormone production, that results in vaginal bleeding, a change in menstrual habits, or hirsutism, or occasionally virilization as a main symptom. In rare cases the disease can manifest with hydronephrosis and hydroureter.

All these symptoms are non-specific and can also arise with a range of problems other than cancer, and a diagnosis can only be made following confirmatory investigations such as computed tomography (CT) scans, laparotomy and/or a biopsy of the ovary.

==Cause and incidence==
Krukenberg tumors can be seen in all age groups, with an average age of 45 years. In most countries, cancer that has metastasized to the ovary accounts for only about 1 to 2% of ovarian cancer; in the remainder, the ovary itself is the primary cancer site. However, in Japan they represent a much higher percentage of malignancies in the ovary (almost 20%) due to the increased prevalence of gastric cancer.

Krukenberg tumors account for about 15% of metastatic cancers that initially appear to have arisen in the ovary, and as such is less common than metastasis arising from ovarian epithelial and germ-cell tumors.

In people who have had nongynecologic malignancy, approximately 20% of adnexal masses are malignant, and 60% of these are Krukenberg tumors.

==Pathogenesis==
There has been debate over the exact mechanism of metastasis of the tumor cells from the stomach, appendix or colon to the ovaries. Classically it was thought that direct seeding across the abdominal cavity accounted for the spread of this tumor, but spread by way of the lymphatic is considered more likely. Retrograde lymphatics are thought to be more important in the pathogenesis of Krukenberg tumour, since the ovaries in Krukenberg tumour do not show capsular invasion or a breech of the epithelium lining the surface. The average age of diagnosis of Krukenberg tumors may partly relate to the relatively increased vascularity of the ovaries.

Microscopically, Krukenberg tumors are often characterized by mucin-secreting signet-ring cells in the tissue of the ovary; when the primary tumor is discovered, the same signet-ring cells are typically found. However, other microscopic features can predominate. Krukenberg tumors are most commonly metastases from gastric cancer, particularly adenocarcinoma, or breast cancer particularly invasive lobular breast carcinoma, but they can arise in the appendix, colon, small intestine, rectum, gallbladder, and urinary bladder or gallbladder, biliary tract, pancreas, ampulla of Vater or uterine cervix.

Immunohistochemistry may help in diagnosing Krukenberg tumors from primary ovarian neoplasms but needs to be applied with discretion. For example, tumors that are immunoreactive to CEA or cytokeratin 20 (CK20) and negative for cytokeratin 7 (CK7) may be more likely to be of colorectal origin.

==Treatment and prognosis==
Since Krukenberg tumors are secondary (metastatic), management might logically be driven by identifying and treating the primary cancer. The optimal treatment of Krukenberg tumors is unclear. The role of surgical resection has not been adequately addressed but if metastasis is limited to the ovaries, surgery may improve survival. The role of chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy is uncertain but may sometimes be beneficial.

==History==
Krukenberg tumors are named after Friedrich Ernst Krukenberg (1871–1946), who reported what he thought was a new type of primary ovarian malignancy in 1896; six years later these were shown to be of metastatic gastrointestinal tract origin. However, Paget had described the process in 1854.

<text>Robert Burns Woodward (April 10, 1917 – July 8, 1979) was an American organic chemist. He is considered by many to be the preeminent synthetic organic chemist of the twentieth century, having made many key contributions to the subject, especially in the synthesis of complex natural products and the determination of their molecular structure. He worked closely with Roald Hoffmann on theoretical studies of chemical reactions. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1965.

==Early life and education==
Woodward was born in Boston, Massachusetts, on April 10, 1917. He was the son of Margaret Burns (an immigrant from Scotland who claimed to be a descendant of the poet, Robert Burns) and her husband, Arthur Chester Woodward, himself the son of Roxbury apothecary, Harlow Elliot Woodward. 

His father was one of the many victims of the 1918 influenza pandemic.

From a very early age, Woodward was attracted to and engaged in private study of chemistry while he attended a public primary school, and then Quincy High School, in Quincy, Massachusetts. By the time he entered high school, he had already managed to perform most of the experiments in Ludwig Gattermann&#x27;s then widely used textbook of experimental organic chemistry. In 1928, Woodward contacted the Consul-General of the German consulate in Boston (Baron von Tippelskirch ), and through him, managed to obtain copies of a few original papers published in German journals. Later, in his Cope lecture, he recalled how he had been fascinated when, among these papers, he chanced upon Diels and Alder&#x27;s original communication about the Diels–Alder reaction. Throughout his career, Woodward was to repeatedly and powerfully use and investigate this reaction, both in theoretical and experimental ways. In 1933, he entered the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), but neglected his formal studies badly enough to be excluded at the end of the 1934 fall term. MIT readmitted him in the 1935 fall term, and by 1936 he had received the Bachelor of Science degree. Only one year later, MIT awarded him the doctorate, when his classmates were still graduating with their bachelor&#x27;s degrees. Woodward&#x27;s doctoral work involved investigations related to the synthesis of the female sex hormone estrone. MIT required that graduate students have research advisors. Woodward&#x27;s advisors were James Flack Norris and Avery Adrian Morton, although it is not clear whether he actually took any of their advice. After a short postdoctoral stint at the University of Illinois, he took a Junior Fellowship at Harvard University from 1937 to 1938, and remained at Harvard in various capacities for the rest of his life. In the 1960s, Woodward was named Donner Professor of Science, a title that freed him from teaching formal courses so that he could devote his entire time to research.

==Research and career==

===Early work===
The first major contribution of Woodward&#x27;s career in the early 1940s was a series of papers describing the application of ultraviolet spectroscopy in the elucidation of the structure of natural products. Woodward collected together a large amount of empirical data, and then devised a series of rules later called the Woodward&#x27;s rules, which could be applied to finding out the structures of new natural substances, as well as non-natural synthesized molecules. The expedient use of newly developed instrumental techniques was a characteristic Woodward exemplified throughout his career, and it marked a radical change from the extremely tedious and long chemical methods of structural elucidation that had been used until then.

In 1944, with his post doctoral researcher, William von Eggers Doering, Woodward reported the synthesis of the alkaloid quinine, used to treat malaria. Although the synthesis was publicized as a breakthrough in procuring the hard to get medicinal compound from Japanese occupied southeast Asia, in reality it was too long and tedious to adopt on a practical scale. Nevertheless, it was a landmark for chemical synthesis. Woodward&#x27;s particular insight in this synthesis was to realize that the German chemist Paul Rabe had converted a precursor of quinine called quinotoxine to quinine in 1905. Hence, a synthesis of quinotoxine (which Woodward actually synthesized) would establish a route to synthesizing quinine. When Woodward accomplished this feat, organic synthesis was still largely a matter of trial and error, and nobody thought that such complex structures could actually be constructed. Woodward showed that organic synthesis could be made into a rational science, and that synthesis could be aided by well-established principles of reactivity and structure. This synthesis was the first one in a series of exceedingly complicated and elegant syntheses that he would undertake.

===Later work and its impact===

Culminating in the 1930s, the British chemists Christopher Ingold and Robert Robinson among others had investigated the mechanisms of organic reactions, and had come up with empirical rules which could predict reactivity of organic molecules. Woodward was perhaps the first synthetic organic chemist who used these ideas as a predictive framework in synthesis. Woodward&#x27;s style was the inspiration for the work of hundreds of successive synthetic chemists who synthesized medicinally important and structurally complex natural products.

===Organic syntheses and Nobel Prize===

During the late 1940s, Woodward synthesized many complex natural products including quinine, cholesterol, cortisone, strychnine, lysergic acid, reserpine, chlorophyll, cephalosporin, and colchicine. With these, Woodward opened up a new era of synthesis, sometimes called the &#x27;Woodwardian era&#x27; in which he showed that natural products could be synthesized by careful applications of the principles of physical organic chemistry, and by meticulous planning.

Many of Woodward&#x27;s syntheses were described as spectacular by his colleagues and before he did them, it was thought by some that it would be impossible to create these substances in the lab. Woodward&#x27;s syntheses were also described as having an element of art in them, and since then, synthetic chemists have always looked for elegance as well as utility in synthesis. His work also involved the exhaustive use of the then newly developed techniques of infrared spectroscopy and later, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Another important feature of Woodward&#x27;s syntheses was their attention to stereochemistry or the particular configuration of molecules in three-dimensional space. Most natural products of medicinal importance are effective, for example as drugs, only when they possess a specific stereochemistry. This creates the demand for &#x27;stereoselective synthesis&#x27;, producing a compound with a defined stereochemistry. While today a typical synthetic route routinely involves such a procedure, Woodward was a pioneer in showing how, with exhaustive and rational planning, one could conduct reactions that were stereoselective. Many of his syntheses involved forcing a molecule into a certain configuration by installing rigid structural elements in it, another tactic that has become standard today. In this regard, especially his syntheses of reserpine and strychnine were landmarks.

During World War II, Woodward was an advisor to the War Production Board on the penicillin project. Although often given credit for proposing the beta-lactam structure of penicillin, it was actually first proposed by chemists at Merck and Edward Abraham at Oxford and then investigated by other groups, as well (e.g., Shell). Woodward at first endorsed an incorrect tricyclic (thiazolidine fused, amino bridged oxazinone) structure put forth by the penicillin group at Peoria. Subsequently, he put his imprimatur on the beta-lactam structure, all of this in opposition to the thiazolidine–oxazolone structure proposed by Robert Robinson, the then leading organic chemist of his generation. Ultimately, the beta-lactam structure was shown to be correct by Dorothy Hodgkin using X-ray crystallography in 1945.

Woodward also applied the technique of infrared spectroscopy and chemical degradation to determine the structures of complicated molecules. Notable among these structure determinations were santonic acid, strychnine, magnamycin and terramycin. In each one of these cases, Woodward again showed how rational facts and chemical principles, combined with chemical intuition, could be used to achieve the task.

In the early 1950s, Woodward, along with the British chemist Geoffrey Wilkinson, then at Harvard, postulated a novel structure for ferrocene, a compound consisting of a combination of an organic molecule with iron. This marked the beginning of the field of transition metal organometallic chemistry which grew into an industrially very significant field. Wilkinson won the Nobel Prize for this work in 1973, along with Ernst Otto Fischer. Some historians think that Woodward should have shared this prize along with Wilkinson. Remarkably, Woodward himself thought so, and voiced his thoughts in a letter sent to the Nobel Committee.

Woodward won the Nobel Prize in 1965 for his synthesis of complex organic molecules. He had been nominated a total of 111 times from 1946 to 1965. In his Nobel lecture, he described the total synthesis of the antibiotic cephalosporin, and claimed that he had pushed the synthesis schedule so that it would be completed around the time of the Nobel ceremony.

===B12 synthesis and Woodward–Hoffmann rules===
In the early 1960s, Woodward began work on what was the most complex natural product synthesized to date—vitamin B12. In a remarkable collaboration with his colleague Albert Eschenmoser in Zurich, a team of almost one hundred students and postdoctoral workers worked for many years on the synthesis of this molecule. The work was finally published in 1973, and it marked a landmark in the history of organic chemistry. The synthesis included almost a hundred steps, and involved the characteristic rigorous planning and analyses that had always characterised Woodward&#x27;s work. This work, more than any other, convinced organic chemists that the synthesis of any complex substance was possible, given enough time and planning (see also palytoxin, synthesized by the research group of Yoshito Kishi, one of Woodward&#x27;s postdoctoral students). As of 2019, no other total synthesis of Vitamin B12 has been published.

That same year, based on observations that Woodward had made during the B12 synthesis, he and Roald Hoffmann devised rules (now called the Woodward–Hoffmann rules) for elucidating the stereochemistry of the products of organic reactions. Woodward formulated his ideas (which were based on the symmetry properties of molecular orbitals) based on his experiences as a synthetic organic chemist; he asked Hoffman to perform theoretical calculations to verify these ideas, which were done using Hoffmann&#x27;s Extended Hückel method. The predictions of these rules, called the &quot;Woodward–Hoffmann rules&quot; were verified by many experiments. Hoffmann shared the 1981 Nobel Prize for this work along with Kenichi Fukui, a Japanese chemist who had done similar work using a different approach; Woodward had died in 1979 and Nobel Prizes are not awarded posthumously.

===Woodward Institute===
While at Harvard, Woodward took on the directorship of the
Woodward Research Institute, based at Basel, Switzerland, in 1963. He also became a trustee of his alma mater, MIT, from 1966 to 1971, and of the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel.

===Death===

Woodward died in Cambridge, Massachusetts, from a heart attack in his sleep. At the time, he was working on the synthesis of an antibiotic, erythromycin. A student of his said about him:

:&quot;I owe a lot to R. B. Woodward. He showed me that one could attack difficult problems without a clear idea of their outcome, but with confidence that intelligence and effort would solve them. He showed me the beauty of modern organic chemistry, and the relevance to the field of detailed careful reasoning. He showed me that one does not need to specialize. Woodward made great contributions to the strategy of synthesis, to the deduction of difficult structures, to the invention of new chemistry, and to theoretical aspects as well. He taught his students by example the satisfaction that comes from total immersion in our science. I treasure the memory of my association with this remarkable chemist.&quot;

===Publications===
During his lifetime Woodward authored or coauthored almost 200 publications, of which 85 are full papers, the remainder comprising preliminary communications, the text of lectures, and reviews. The pace of his scientific activity soon outstripped his capacity to publish all experimental details, and much of the work in which he participated was not published until a few years after his death. Woodward trained more than two hundred Ph.D. students and postdoctoral workers, many of whom later went on to distinguished careers.

Some of his best-known students include Robert M. Williams (Colorado State), Harry Wasserman (Yale), Yoshito Kishi (Harvard), Stuart Schreiber (Harvard), William R. Roush (Scripps-Florida), Steven A. Benner (UF), James D. Wuest (Montreal), Christopher S. Foote (UCLA), Kendall Houk (UCLA), porphyrin chemist Kevin M. Smith (LSU), Thomas R. Hoye (University of Minnesota), Ronald Breslow (Columbia University) and David Dolphin (UBC).

Woodward had an encyclopedic knowledge of chemistry, and an extraordinary memory for detail. Probably the quality that most set him apart from his peers was his remarkable ability to tie together disparate threads of knowledge from the chemical literature and bring them to bear on a chemical problem.

==Honors and awards==
For his work, Woodward received many awards, honors and honorary doctorates, including election to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1948, the National Academy of Sciences in 1953, the American Philosophical Society in 1962, and membership in academies around the world. He was also a consultant to many companies such as Polaroid, Pfizer, and Merck. Other awards include:

==Personal life==

===Family===
In 1938, he married Irja Pullman; they had two daughters: Siiri Anna (b. 1939) and Jean Kirsten (b. 1944). In 1946, he married Eudoxia Muller, an artist and technician whom he met at the Polaroid Corp. This marriage, which lasted until 1972, produced a daughter, and a son: Crystal Elisabeth (b. 1947), and Eric Richard Arthur (b. 1953).

===Idiosyncrasies===
His lectures frequently lasted for three or four hours. His longest known lecture defined the unit of time known as the &quot;Woodward&quot;, after which his other lectures were deemed to be so many &quot;milli-Woodwards&quot; long. In many of these, he eschewed the use of slides and drew structures by using multicolored chalk. Typically, to begin a lecture, Woodward would arrive and lay out two large white handkerchiefs on the countertop. Upon one would be four or five colors of chalk (new pieces), neatly sorted by color, in a long row. Upon the other handkerchief would be placed an equally impressive row of cigarettes. The previous cigarette would be used to light the next one. His Thursday seminars at Harvard often lasted well into the night. He had a fixation with blue, and many of his suits, his car, and even his parking space were coloured in blue. 

In one of his laboratories, his students hung a large black and white photograph of the master from the ceiling, complete with a large blue &quot;tie&quot; appended. There it hung for some years (early 1970s), until scorched in a minor laboratory fire. He detested exercise, could get along with only a few hours of sleep every night, was a heavy smoker, and enjoyed Scotch whisky and martinis.

<text>Multi-Man Publishing, LLC (&quot;MMP&quot;), founded in 1994, is a Maryland based game company that publishes many wargame titles, including &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; and Operational Combat Series.

==History==

Multi-Man Publishing (MMP) was founded in 1994 by four Avalon Hill playtesters and a graphics art designer. Their first publication was &quot;Backblast&quot;, a fanzine for Avalon Hill&#x27;s wargame &quot;Advanced Squad Leader&quot; (ASL). Around the same time, Avalon Hill had made the decision that ASL did not have a future, and so MMP sought to keep it alive among fans by publishing occasional scenarios and a fanzine. MMP also entered into discussions with AH about purchasing the rights to ASL. In late 1995, professional baseball player Curt Schilling, who was a devoted player of ASL, separately also tried to buy the rights to ASL. Avalon Hill did not agree to either offer, they held out for more money, but introduced Schilling to MMP, who subsequently joined the company as a one-third partner, the other two-thirds owned equally by Perry Cocke and Brian Youse. 

After Avalon Hill was sold to Hasbro in 1999, MMP negotiated to license ASL from Hasbro. MMP would also develop, print and sell some of the other former Avalon Hill titles. 

In 2002 MMP acquired The Gamers line of wargames, vastly increasing its list of titles including the popular Civil War Brigade Series and Operational Combat Series. 

MMP also continued publication of The Gamers&#x27; &quot;Operations Magazine&quot; as a &quot;house organ&quot; similar to Avalon Hill&#x27;s &quot;The General&quot;, which had ceased publication with the demise of Avalon Hill. In summer 2011, MMP started a new magazine called &quot;Special Ops&quot; which replaced &quot;Operations&quot; as the MMP house organ.

The company is privately owned and thus does not publicly report financial information. Co-owner Brian Youse has stated that the company supports itself solely through the sale of its games, and has done so since 1999.

<doc id="261628" wikidata="Q71118" url="?curid=261628" title="Cuckoo-roller">
<text>The cuckoo-roller or courol (Leptosomus discolor) is the only bird in the family Leptosomidae , which was previously often placed in the order Coraciiformes but is now placed in its own order Leptosomiformes. The cuckoo-roller is at the root of a group that contains the Trogoniformes, Bucerotiformes, Piciformes, and Coraciiformes. Despite its name, the Cuckoo-roller does not share close evolutionary origins with cuckoos or rollers.

It is a medium-large bird, inhabiting forests and woodlands in Madagascar and the Comoro Islands. Three subspecies are described: the nominate &quot;L. d. discolor&quot; is found in Madagascar and Mayotte Island, &quot;L. d. intermedius&quot; on Anjouan, and &quot;L. d. gracilis&quot; of Grand Comoro. Based on its smaller size, differences in the plumage, and minor difference in the voice, the last of these is sometimes considered a separate species, the Comoro cuckoo-roller (&quot;L. gracilis&quot;).

==Description==
The cuckoo-roller has a total length of ; the nominate subspecies is the largest, and &quot;L. d. gracilis&quot; the smallest. Unlike the true rollers and ground rollers, where the sexes have identical appearance, the cuckoo-roller is sexually dichromatic. Males have a mostly velvety grey chest and head, changing gradually to white on the remaining underparts (the demarcation between grey and white is stronger in &quot;L. d. gracilis&quot;). The back, tail, and wing-coverts are dark iridescent green with a purplish tinge (especially on the wing-coverts), and the crown and eye-stripe are black. Females are mostly brown, with strongly dark-spotted pale underparts (less spotting in &quot;L. d. gracilis&quot;). Juveniles are generally reported as resembling a dull female, but at least juveniles of &quot;L. d. gracilis&quot; are sexually dimorphic, and this also possibly applies to the other subspecies. The bill is stout and the eyes are set far back in the face. The legs and feet are small, and the feet have an unusual structure which has confused many ornithologists, but is now thought to be zygodactylous (two toes forwards, two toes backwards).

==Distribution and habitat==
The cuckoo-roller occupies a wide variety of habitats, including altered areas. They inhabit forest, including rainforest, litoral forest, deciduous forest, spiny bush-forest, and tree plantations. In the Comoros, the species is found on all the major islands, particularly in forested zones. It can be found from near sea level up to 2000 m.

==Behaviour and ecology==
The diet of the cuckoo-roller is not well known, but a 1931 expedition found that chameleons and insects, particularly locusts and caterpillars, are important food items. Stomachs have often been found to be lined with caterpillar hairs, and other prey taken include grasshoppers, cicadas, stick insects, and geckos. The principal foraging technique is to perch motionless, watching for prey, then to make a quick sally towards the prey when observed. They also hunt from the air. Prey is caught in the large bill and killed by beating it against a branch.

Very few studies have investigated the breeding habits of the cuckoo-roller. It has been described in the past as a polygamous breeder, but no evidence for this is available. The nest is located in tall trees, off the ground, in natural cavities. No lining is placed inside the cavity; the white eggs are laid directly on the bottom. The usual clutch size is around four eggs. Incubation is performed by the female only, while the male feeds her. The incubation period is about 20 days, after which fluffy chicks are born. Chicks remain in the nest for 30 days before fledging.

==Status and conservation==
The species is not generally hunted and has proven resistant to habitat change that has threatened other native birds. It is assessed as Least Concern by the IUCN. The distribution of the cuckoo-roller is vast, and populations in Madagascar persist in small forest fragments. Areas with abundant populations include broad expanses of forest associated with reserves such as Zahamena, Andringitra, Andohahela, and Marojejy.

==Relations with humans==
The cuckoo-roller is very tame, and it is generally not disturbed by the inhabitants of Madagascar, many of whom have legends and myths about the species. It is often considered a good omen, as the harbinger of clear weather and (because it is often seen in pairs) as associated with couples and love.

<text>The Zeta (, ) is a river in Montenegro. 

Its source is under the mountain of Vojnik. The river flows eastwards for until it empties into the river Morača just north of Podgorica. Its drainage basin area is .

==Geography==
One theory is that the name &quot;Zeta&quot; derives from an early Greek &quot;Zenta&quot;, later romanized in &quot;Senta&quot;.

The Zeta River is the most significant tributary of the Morača river. The Perućica hydroelectric power plant near Nikšić (307 MW, 970 GWh) uses the waters of the Zeta River to generate power. After that, the river meanders through the Bjelopavlići Valley and Danilovgrad Municipality, until it empties into the Morača a few miles north of Capital City of Podgorica.

Historical monumental Carev Most (the Tsar&#x27;s Bridge) exists over Zeta to the south of Nikšić town, and the ancient castle of Pandurica is situated nearby.

<doc id="261630" wikidata="Q346762" url="?curid=261630" title="Freddie Hubbard">
<text>Frederick Dewayne Hubbard (April 7, 1938 – December 29, 2008) was an American jazz trumpeter. He played bebop, hard bop, and post-bop styles from the early 1960s onwards. His unmistakable and influential tone contributed to new perspectives for modern jazz and bebop.

==Career beginnings==
Hubbard started playing the mellophone and trumpet in his school band at Arsenal Technical High School in Indianapolis, Indiana. Trumpeter Lee Katzman, former sideman with Stan Kenton, recommended that he begin taking trumpet lessons at the Arthur Jordan Conservatory of Music (now the Jordan College of the Arts at Butler University) with Max Woodbury, principal trumpeter of the Indianapolis Symphony Orchestra. In his teens, Hubbard worked locally with brothers Wes and Monk Montgomery, and worked with bassist Larry Ridley and saxophonist James Spaulding.

In 1958, at the age of 20, he moved to New York and began playing with some of the best jazz players of the era, including Philly Joe Jones, Sonny Rollins, Slide Hampton, Eric Dolphy, J. J. Johnson, and Quincy Jones. On June 19, 1960, Hubbard made his first record as a leader, &quot;Open Sesame&quot;, at the beginning of his contract with Blue Note Records, with saxophonist Tina Brooks, pianist McCoy Tyner, bassist Sam Jones, and drummer Clifford Jarvis. Six days later he returned the favor to Brooks and recorded with him on &quot;True Blue&quot;.

==1960s==
In December 1960, Hubbard was invited to play on Ornette Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Free Jazz&quot;, after Coleman heard him performing with Don Cherry. In May 1961, Hubbard played on &quot;Olé Coltrane&quot;, John Coltrane&#x27;s final session for Atlantic Records. Coltrane also hired Hubbard, Eric Dolphy and Art Davis, who all appeared on &quot;Olé&quot;, to record &quot;Africa/Brass&quot;, Coltrane&#x27;s first album with Impulse!, which was begun just after &quot;Olé&quot;.

In August 1961, Hubbard recorded &quot;Ready for Freddie&quot; (Blue Note), which was also his first collaboration with saxophonist Wayne Shorter. Hubbard became Shorter&#x27;s bandmate when he replaced Lee Morgan in Art Blakey&#x27;s Jazz Messengers later in 1961. He played on more than 10 live and studio recordings with Blakey during one of the most acclaimed eras of the Jazz Messengers, including &quot;Caravan&quot;, &quot;Ugetsu&quot;, &quot;Mosaic&quot;, and &quot;Free for All&quot;. In all, during the 1960s, he recorded eight studio albums as a bandleader for Blue Note, and more than two dozen as a sideman.

Hubbard remained with Blakey until 1966, leaving to form the first of several small groups of his own, which featured, among others, his Blue note associate James Spaulding, pianist Kenny Barron and drummer Louis Hayes. This group recorded for Atlantic. It was during this time that he began to develop his own sound, distancing himself from the early influences of Clifford Brown and Morgan, and won the &quot;DownBeat&quot; jazz magazine &quot;New Star&quot; award on trumpet.

Throughout the &#x27;60s, Hubbard played as a sideman on some of the most important albums from that era, including Oliver Nelson&#x27;s &quot;The Blues and the Abstract Truth&quot;, Eric Dolphy&#x27;s &quot;Out to Lunch!&quot;, Herbie Hancock&#x27;s &quot;Maiden Voyage&quot;, and Wayne Shorter&#x27;s &quot;Speak No Evil&quot;. Hubbard was described as &quot;the most brilliant trumpeter of a generation of musicians who stand with one foot in &#x27;tonal&#x27; jazz and the other in the atonal camp&quot;. Though he never fully embraced the free jazz of the 1960s, he appeared on two of its landmark albums: Coleman&#x27;s &quot;Free Jazz&quot; and Coltrane&#x27;s &quot;Ascension&quot;, as well as on Sonny Rollins&#x27; &quot;new thing&quot; track, &quot;East Broadway Run Down&quot; (on the 1966 album of the same name), with Elvin Jones and Jimmy Garrison.

==1970s==

Hubbard achieved his greatest popular success in the 1970s with a series of albums for Creed Taylor and his record label CTI Records, overshadowing Stanley Turrentine, Hubert Laws, and George Benson. Although his early 1970s jazz albums &quot;Red Clay&quot;, &quot;First Light&quot;, &quot;Straight Life&quot;, and &quot;Sky Dive&quot; were particularly well received and considered among his best work, the albums he recorded later in the decade were attacked by critics for their commercialism. &quot;First Light&quot; won a 1972 Grammy Award and included pianists Herbie Hancock and Richard Wyands, guitarists Eric Gale and George Benson, bassist Ron Carter, drummer Jack DeJohnette, and percussionist Airto Moreira. In 1994, Hubbard, collaborating with Chicago jazz vocalist/co-writer Catherine Whitney, had lyrics set to the music of &quot;First Light&quot;.

In 1977, Hubbard joined the all-star V.S.O.P. band, which also featured Herbie Hancock, Tony Williams, Ron Carter and Wayne Shorter. All of the band&#x27;s members except Hubbard were members of the mid-1960s Miles Davis Quintet. Several live recordings of this group were released as &quot;V.S.O.P&quot;, &quot;V.S.O.P. The Quintet&quot;, &quot;V.S.O.P. Tempest in the Colosseum&quot; (all 1977) and &quot;V.S.O.P. Live Under the Sky&quot; (1979).

Hubbard&#x27;s trumpet playing was featured on the track &quot;Zanzibar&quot; from the 1978 Billy Joel album &quot;52nd Street&quot; (the 1979 Grammy Award Winner for Best Album). The track ends with a fade during Hubbard&#x27;s performance. An unfaded version was released on the 2004 Billy Joel boxed set &quot;My Lives&quot;.

==Later life==

In the 1980s Hubbard was again leading his own jazz group – this time with Billy Childs and Larry Klein, among others, as members – attracting favorable reviews, playing at concerts and festivals in the US and Europe, often in the company of Joe Henderson, playing a repertory of hard bop and modal jazz pieces. Hubbard played at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1980 and in 1989 (with Bobby Hutcherson). He and Woody Shaw recorded two albums as co-leaders for Blue Note and played live concerts together from 1985 to 1987. In 1987, he was a co-leader with Benny Golson on the &quot;Stardust&quot; album.

In 1988, he again teamed up with Blakey at an engagement in the Netherlands, from which came &quot;Feel the Wind&quot;. In 1988, Hubbard played with Elton John, contributing trumpet and flugelhorn and trumpet solos on the track &quot;Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters (Part Two)&quot; for John&#x27;s &quot;Reg Strikes Back&quot; album. In 1990, he appeared in Japan headlining an American-Japanese concert package which also featured Elvin Jones, Sonny Fortune, pianists George Duke and Benny Green, bass players Ron Carter, and Rufus Reid, with jazz vocalist Salena Jones. He also performed at the Warsaw Jazz Festival, at which &quot;Live at the Warsaw Jazz Festival&quot; (Jazzmen 1992) was recorded.

Following a long setback of health problems and a serious lip injury in 1992 when he subsequently developed an infection, Hubbard was again playing and recording occasionally, even if not at the level he set for himself during his earlier career. His best records ranked with the finest in his field.

==Legacy and honors==
In 2006, the National Endowment for the Arts accorded Hubbard its highest honor in jazz, the NEA Jazz Masters Award.

On December 29, 2008, Hubbard died in Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles, California from complications caused by a heart attack he suffered on November 26. Hubbard&#x27;s body was cremated, with his ashes given to his family.

Hubbard had close ties to the Jazz Foundation of America in his later years. The Jazz Foundation of America&#x27;s Musicians&#x27; Emergency Fund took care of him during times of illness. He is quoted as saying, &quot;When I had congestive heart failure and couldn&#x27;t work, the Jazz Foundation paid my mortgage for several months and saved my home! Thank God for those people.&quot; After his death, Hubbard&#x27;s estate requested that tax-deductible donations be made in his name to the Jazz Foundation.

<doc id="261633" wikidata="Q156017" url="?curid=261633" title="Operation Condor">
<text>Operation Condor (; ) was a campaign of political repression by the right-wing dictatorships of the Southern Cone of South America, involving intelligence operations, coups, and assassinations of left-wing sympathizers in South America which formally existed from 1975 to 1983. They were backed by the United States, which collaborated and financed the covert operations, and France (which denies involvement). Venezuela and Colombia are also alleged to have collaborated. Condor was formally created in November 1975, when Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s spy chief, Manuel Contreras, invited 50 intelligence officers from Chile, Uruguay, Argentina, Paraguay, Bolivia, and Brazil to the Army War Academy in Santiago, Chile. The operation ended with the fall of the Argentine junta in 1983.

Due to its clandestine nature, the precise number of deaths directly attributable to Operation Condor is highly disputed. Some estimates are that at least 60,000 deaths can be attributed to Condor, with up to 30,000 of these in Argentina. This collaboration had a devastating impact on countries like Argentina, where Condor exacerbated existing political violence and contributed to the &quot;Dirty War&quot; that left an estimated 30,000 people dead or disappeared. Others estimate the toll at 50,000 killed, 30,000 disappeared, and 400,000 imprisoned. A Paraguayan investigative commission, relying on the Archives of Terror, among other sources, allowed for the identification of 20,090 victims, including 59 who were extrajudicially executed and 336 who were forcibly disappeared. According to a database by Francesca Lessa of the University of Oxford, at least 805 cases of transnational human rights violations resulting from Operation Condor have been identified, including 382 cases of illegal detentions and torture and 367 murders and disappearances. American political scientist J. Patrice McSherry estimated between 400 and 500 killed in cross border operations. He further stated that of those who &quot;had gone into exile&quot; and were &quot;kidnapped, tortured and killed in allied countries or illegally transferred to their home countries to be executed ... hundreds, or thousands, of such persons – the number still has not been finally determined – were abducted, tortured, and murdered in Condor operations&quot;.

Victims included dissidents and leftists, union and peasant leaders, priests, monks and nuns, students and teachers, intellectuals, and suspected guerrillas such as prominent union leader Marcelo Santuray in Argentina or journalist Carlos Prats in Chile. Condor operatives participated in tactics such as death flights. Although it was described by the CIA as &quot;a cooperative effort by the intelligence/security services of several South American countries to combat terrorism and subversion&quot;, combatting &quot;guerrillas&quot; was used as a pretext for its existence, as guerrillas were not substantial enough in numbers to control territory, gain material support by any foreign power, or otherwise threaten national security. Condor&#x27;s initial members were the governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay; Brazil signed the agreement later on. Ecuador and Peru later joined the operation in a more peripheral role. However, a letter which was written by renowned DINA assassin Michael Townley in 1976 noted the existence of a network of individual Southern Cone secret polices known as &quot;Red Condor&quot;. With tensions between Chile and Argentina rising and Argentina severely weakened as a result of the loss in Falklands War to the British military, the Argentine junta fell in 1983, which in turn led to more South American dictatorships falling. The fall of the Argentine junta has been regarded as marking the end of Operation Condor. J. Patrice McSherry has argued that aspects of Operation Condor fit the definition of state terrorism.

==Antecedents==

Operation Condor, which took place in the context of the Cold War, had the tacit approval and material support of the United States. In 1968, U.S. General Robert W. Porter Jr. stated that: 

According to American historian J. Patrice McSherry, based on formerly secret CIA documents from 1976, in the 1960s and early 1970s plans were developed among international security officials at the U.S. Army School of the Americas and the Conference of American Armies to deal with perceived threats in South America from political dissidents. A declassified CIA document dated 23 June 1976 explains that &quot;in early 1974, security officials from Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay, and Bolivia met in Buenos Aires to prepare coordinated actions against subversive targets&quot;. According to the CIA, Operation Condor was a cooperative mission enabled by Chile, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay, Brazil and Bolivia. The cooperation between the countries for intelligence and security services had existed from as early as February 1974 to late May 1976 when it was formalized.

Members of Condor coordinated their activities with one another, established a special network for communication, and constructed various types of training. Some of which included psychological warfare.

The program was developed following a series of military &quot;coups d&#x27;états&quot; in South America:
* General Alfredo Stroessner took control of Paraguay in 1954.
* The Brazilian military overthrew president João Goulart in 1964.
* General Hugo Banzer took power in Bolivia in 1971 through a series of coups.
* A civic-military dictatorship seized power in Uruguay on 27 June 1973.
* Chilean armed forces commanded by General Augusto Pinochet bombed the presidential palace in Chile on 11 September 1973, overthrowing democratically elected president Salvador Allende.
* General Francisco Morales Bermúdez took control of Peru after a successful coup in 1975.
* The Ecuadorian military overthrew dictator Guillermo Rodríguez in 1976.
* A military junta headed by General Jorge Rafael Videla seized power in Argentina on 24 March 1976.

American journalist A. J. Langguth states in a 1978 book that the organization of the first meetings between Argentine and Uruguayan security officials, concerning the watching (and subsequent disappearance or assassination) of political refugees in these countries, can be attributed to coordination by the CIA, and that the CIA also acted as an intermediary in meetings between Argentine, Brazilian, and Uruguayan death squads.

The National Security Archive reported, &quot;Founded by the Pinochet regime in November 1975, Operation Condor was the codename for a formal Southern Cone collaboration that included transnational secret intelligence activities, kidnapping, torture, disappearance and assassination, according to the National Security Archive&#x27;s documentary evidence from U.S., Paraguayan, Argentine, and Chilean files&quot;. Under this codename mission, several people were killed. As the report stated, &quot;Prominent victims of Condor include two former Uruguayan legislators and a former Bolivian president, Juan José Torres, murdered in Buenos Aires, a former Chilean Minister of the Interior, Bernardo Leighton, as well as former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier and his 26-year old American colleague, Ronni Moffitt, assassinated by a car bomb in downtown Washington D.C&quot;.

== History ==

Cooperation among various security services had existed prior to the creation of Operation Condor, with the aim of &quot;eliminating Marxist subversion&quot;. During the Conference of American Armies held in Caracas on 3 September 1973, Brazilian General Breno Borges Fortes, head of the Brazilian army, proposed to &quot;extend the exchange of information&quot; between various services in order to &quot;struggle against subversion&quot;.

In March 1974, representatives of the police forces of Chile, Uruguay and Bolivia met with Alberto Villar, deputy chief of the Argentine Federal Police and co-founder of the Triple A death squad, to implement cooperation guidelines. Their goal was to destroy the &quot;subversive&quot; threat represented by the presence of thousands of political exiles in Argentina. In August 1974, the corpses of Bolivian refugees were found in garbage dumps in Buenos Aires. In 2007, McSherry also confirmed the abduction and torture during this period of Chilean and Uruguayan refugees who were living in Buenos Aires, based on newly declassified CIA documents dated June 1976.

On 25 November 1975, General Augusto Pinochet&#x27;s 60th birthday, leaders of the military intelligence services of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay met with Manuel Contreras, chief of DINA (the Chilean secret police), in Santiago de Chile, officially creating the Plan Condor. According to French journalist Marie-Monique Robin, author of (2004, &quot;Death Squads, The French School&quot;), General Rivero, intelligence officer of the Argentine Armed Forces and former student of the French, developed the concept of Operation Condor.

Based on the governments&#x27; perception of threats, officially the targets were armed groups (such as the MIR, the Montoneros or the ERP, the Tupamaros, etc.), but the governments broadened their attacks against all kinds of political opponents, including their families and others, as reported by the Valech Commission. The Argentine &quot;Dirty War&quot;, for example, which resulted in approximately 30,000 victims according to most estimates, kidnapped, tortured and killed many trade-unionists, relatives of activists, social activists such as founders of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo, nuns, university professors, etc.

From 1976 onwards, the Chilean DINA and its Argentine counterpart, SIDE, were the operation&#x27;s front-line troops. The infamous &quot;death flights&quot;, theorized in Argentina by Luis María Mendía – and previously used during the Algerian War (1954–1962) by French forces – were widely used. Government forces took victims by plane or helicopter out to sea, dropping them to their deaths in planned disappearances. It was said that from this military bombardment that OPR-33 infrastructure located in Argentina was destroyed. In May 1976, members of Plan Condor met in Santiago, Chile, at which the participating countries discussed &quot;long-range cooperation... [that] went well beyond information exchange&quot; and were given code names. In July, the CIA gathered intelligence that members of Plan Condor had the intention of striking &quot;against leaders of indigenous terrorist groups residing abroad&quot;.

In June 1976, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger received a Briefing Memorandum from the State Department&#x27;s Bureau of Intelligence and Research. The briefing concluded that evidence supported Argentina&#x27;s state security forces taking part in extrajudicial killings. However, there was not sufficient evidence to show that other South American governments (Brazil, Bolivia, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay) were running a targeted assassination program. &quot;There is no evidence to support a contention that Southern Cone governments are cooperating in some sort of international &quot;Murder Inc.&quot; aimed at leftist political exiles resident in one of their countries&quot;. However, in Argentina, &quot;assassinations are the work of right-wingers, some of whom are security personnel. Argentine President Videla probably does not condone or encourage what is happening, but neither does he appear capable of stopping it&quot;.

This conclusion was somewhat contradicted in a report written from Assistant Secretary of State for Latin America Harry W. Shlaudeman to Henry Kissinger on 3 August 1976, it was reported that the military regimes in South America were coming together to join forces for security reasons. They were concerned about the spread of Marxism and the implications that this could have on their grasp on power. This new force operated in other member&#x27;s countries in secrecy. Their goal: to seek and kill terrorists of the &quot;Revolutionary Coordinating Committee&quot; in their own countries and in Europe. Shlaudeman expressed concern that the &quot;siege mentality&quot; that permeated the members of Operation Condor could lead to a larger chasm between the military and civilian institutions in the region. He was also fearful that this could lead to increasing isolation of these countries from developed Western nations. He believed that there was justification to some of their fears, noting that Uruguayan Foreign Minister Blanco&#x27;s use of the term &quot;Third World War&quot; seemed intended to justify harsh and sweeping &quot;wartime&quot; measures, and emphasizing the international and institutional aspect, thereby justifying the exercise of powers outside national borders. Yet he felt that by reacting too strongly these countries could engender a strong terrorist counter reaction similar to the PLO in Israel. In a report later that month dated August 30, sent to Kissinger, Shlaudeman expresses repeated concern that assassinations&#x27; could seriously damage these countries international reputation, which were U.S. allies. In this memo to Kissinger, Shlaudeman says: &quot;What we are trying to head off is a series of international murders that could do serious damage to the international status and reputation of the countries involved&quot;. One month later in September, there is evidence that there was disagreement between Kissinger and the State Department over telling these nations to discontinue assassinations&#x27;.

U.S. documents dated 17 April 1977, listed both Chile and Argentina as active in utilizing communications media for the purpose of broadcasting propaganda. The objective of the propaganda had two purposes. The first purpose was to defuse/counter criticism of the governments involved by foreign media and the second was to cultivate national pride in the local populace. One propaganda piece created by Chile entitled, &quot;Chile after Allende&quot;, was distributed amongst the governments acting under Condor. However, the document notes only that Uruguay and Argentina were the only two countries to acknowledge the agreement. Paraguay&#x27;s government was listed only as utilizing the local press, &quot;Patria&quot;, as its main propaganda producer. A meeting that was to have taken place in March 1977, discussing &quot;Psychological warfare techniques against terrorists and leftist extremists&quot;, was canceled due to the restructuring of the intelligence services of both Argentina and Paraguay.

In late 1977, due to unusual storms, numerous corpses washed up on beaches south of Buenos Aires, producing evidence of some of the government&#x27;s victims. There were also hundreds of cases of babies and children being taken from mothers in prison who had been kidnapped and later disappeared; the children were handed over in illegal adoptions to families and associates of the regime. The CIA also reported that Operation Condor countries took very well to the idea of working together, and developed their own communications network and combined training initiatives in areas such as psychological warfare.

A 2016 declassified CIA report dated 9 May 1977, titled &quot;Counterterrorism in the Southern Cone&quot;, underscored one &quot;aspect of the program involving Chile, Uruguay, and Argentina envisages illegal operations outside Latin America against exiled terrorists, particularly in Europe&quot;. &quot;The military-controlled governments of the Southern Cone&quot;, the document read, &quot;all consider themselves targets of international Marxism&quot;. The document highlighted Condor&#x27;s fundamental characteristic, constituting as part of a long tried &quot;regional approach&quot; to pacifying &quot;subversion&quot;, came to fruition in early 1974 when &quot;security officials from all of the member countries, except Brazil, agreed to establish liaison channels and to facilitate the movement of security officers on government business from one country to the other&quot;. One of Condor&#x27;s &quot;initial aims&quot; was the &quot;exchange of information on the Revolutionary Coordinating Junta (RCJ), an organization...of terrorist groups from Bolivia, Uruguay, Chile, Argentina, and Paraguay&quot; whose &quot;representatives&quot; in Europe were &quot;believed to have been involved in the assassinations in Paris of the Bolivian ambassador to France last May and an Uruguayan military attache in 1974&quot;. The CIA report noted that the fundamental mission of Condor was the liquidation of &quot;top-level terrorist leaders&quot; as well as non-terrorist targets including &quot;Uruguayan opposition politician Wilson Ferreira, if he should travel to Europe, and some leaders of Amnesty International&quot;. Condor was also seen by the CIA to be &quot;engaged in non-violent activities, including psychological warfare and a propaganda campaign&quot; that utilized the reach of the media to &quot;publicize crimes and atrocities committed by terrorists&quot;. Additionally, in an appeal to &quot;national pride and the national conscience&quot;, Condor called for the citizenry comprising its member nations to &quot;report anything out of the ordinary in their neighborhoods&quot;. However, Chile and Argentina relations eventually came to a head in 1978 when both nations fell out over their maritime frontiers in the Beagle Channel Operation.

=== Revelations about Condor ===

The dictatorships and their intelligence services were responsible for tens of thousands of killed and missing people in the period between 1975 and 1985. Analyzing the political repression in the region during that decade, Brazilian journalist Nilson Mariano estimates the number of killed and missing people as 2,000 in Paraguay; 3,196 in Chile; 297 in Uruguay; 366 in Brazil; and 30,000 in Argentina. Estimates of numbers of killed and disappeared by member countries during the period of operation are 7,000-30,000 in Argentina, 3,000-10,000 in Chile, 116–546 in Bolivia, 434–1,000 in Brazil, 200–400 in Paraguay and 123–215 in Uruguay. While many sources combine these numbers into a single death toll attributable to Operation Condor, killings directly linked to Condor&#x27;s cross-border military and intelligence cooperation between South American dictatorships are only a small subset of the total. McSherry, for example, estimated in 2002 that at least 402 individuals were killed or &quot;disappeared&quot; in Condor operations: &quot;Some 132 Uruguayans (127 in Argentina, 3 in Chile, and 2 in Paraguay), 72 Bolivians (36 in Chile, 36 in Argentina), 119 Chileans, 51 Paraguayans (in Argentina), 16 Brazilians (9 in Argentina and 7 in Chile), and at least 12 Argentines in Brazil&quot;. McSherry added that &quot;some 200 persons passed through Automotores Orletti, the key Condor detention center in Argentina&quot;, and cautioned that &quot;these figures are likely underestimates&quot;. In 2009, McSherry offered a range of &quot;hundreds, or thousands ... murdered in Condor operations&quot;, acknowledging that &quot;the number still has not been finally determined&quot;.

On 22 December 1992, torture victim Martín Almada and José Agustín Fernández, a Paraguayan judge, visited a police station in the Lambaré suburb of Asunción to look for files on a former political prisoner. They found what became known as the &quot;Archives of Terror&quot; (Portuguese: &quot;Arquivos do Terror&quot;), documenting the fates of thousands of Latin American political prisoners, who were secretly kidnapped, tortured and killed by the security services of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay and Uruguay. The archives held a total of 60,000 documents, weighing 4 tons and comprising 593,000 microfilmed pages. Southern Cone Operation Condor resulted in up to 50,000 killed; 30,000 &quot;disappeared&quot;; and 400,000 arrested and imprisoned. Some of these countries have relied on evidence in the archives to prosecute former military officers. A higher number of 90,000 killed has been put forth by La Federación Latinoamericana de Asociaciones de Familiares de Detenidos-Desaparecidos (FEDEFAM).

According to these archives, other countries, such as Peru, cooperated by providing intelligence information in response to requests from the security services of the Southern Cone nations. While Peru had no representatives at the secret November 1975 meeting in Santiago de Chile, there is evidence of its involvement. For instance, as late as June 1980, Peru was known to have collaborated with Argentine agents of 601 Intelligence Battalion in the kidnapping, torture and &quot;disappearance&quot; of a group of Montoneros living in exile in Lima. Brazil signed the agreement later (June 1976), but refused to engage in actions outside Latin America.

Mexico, along with Costa Rica, Canada, France, the United Kingdom, Spain, and Sweden, received many people fleeing as refugees from the terror regimes. The third phase of Operation Condor included plans to assassinate and take other measures against opponents of the military dictatorships in other countries, such as France, Portugal, the United States, Italy and Mexico. These plans were carried out in cases such as the assassination of Orlando Letelier and Ronni Karpen Moffitt in the United States. An undetermined number of foreigners were also arrested and tortured, including citizens of Spain, the UK, France and the United States. Condor officially ended when Argentina ousted the military dictatorship in 1983 (following its defeat in the Falklands War) and restored democracy. Disunity was also shown when Chile provided some military support to the U.K. during the Falklands War as well.

== Notable cases and prosecutions ==

=== Argentina ===

The civic-military dictatorship of Argentina existed from 1976 to 1983 by the military juntas under Operation Condor. Within this period, the Intelligence Service of the United States reported &quot;Chile as being the Center of its operation&quot;. Whereas the operation members included Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, Bolivia, and Brazil. Countries who were most enthused about the course of the Operation were Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile. On September 20, 1976, the Director of the Argentina Army Intelligence Service met &quot;his Chilean counterpart in Santiago to deliberate on their next actions about the fundamental aims of the ‘condor.’”   Following the meeting, and between the period of September 24 to 27 that same year, a joint coalition from the members of the Argentina States Secretaries for Information (SIDE), and the  Uruguayan Military Intelligence Service worked to carry out an operation against the OPR-33, the Uruguay Terrorist organization in Buenos Aires. During this operation, the SIDE reported the destruction and elimination of the &quot;entire OPR-33 infrastructure in Argentina&quot;.

As part of the effort to carry out effective mechanisms to locate, identify, haunt, and assassinate their victims, the member countries proposed the establishment of some secret team of special agents. The member countries never mind endorsing forgery and criminality as they agreed to provide &quot;false documentation&quot; as cover for their special agent, who themselves were either &quot;individuals from one member nation or of patrons from various member nations&quot;. Apparently, such a &quot;Special team&quot; operated in Argentina, whose members were drawn from the Argentina Army Intelligence Service and the State Secretariat for Information.

The Argentine SIDE cooperated with the Chilean DINA in numerous cases of &quot;desaparecidos&quot;. They assassinated Chilean General Carlos Prats, former Uruguayan MPs Zelmar Michelini and Héctor Gutiérrez Ruiz, as well as the ex-president of Bolivia, Juan José Torres, in Buenos Aires. The SIDE also assisted Bolivian general Luis García Meza Tejada&#x27;s &quot;Cocaine Coup&quot; in Bolivia, with the help of the Italian Gladio operative Stefano Delle Chiaie and Nazi war criminal Klaus Barbie (see also Operation Charly). Recently, since the opening of confidential archives, it has been discovered that there were operative units composed of Italians, used at ESMA for the repression of groups of Italian Montoneros. This unit called &quot;Shadow Group&quot; was led by Gaetano Saya at the time Officer of the Italian stay behind next – Operation Gladio. In April 1977, the &quot;Madres de la Plaza de Mayo&quot;, a group of mothers whose children had disappeared, started demonstrating each Thursday in front of the &quot;Casa Rosada&quot; on the plaza. They were seeking to learn the location and fates of their children. The disappearance in December 1977 of two French nuns and several founders of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo gained international attention. Authorities later identified their remains among the bodies washed up on beaches in December 1977 south of Buenos Aires, victims of death flights. Other members of the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo continued the struggle for justice in the ensuing decades.

In 1980, Regional Security Officer James Blystone had met with an Argentine Intelligence Source. In the declassified memo, Blystone had asked about the disappearance for two Montoneros that had plans to travel from Mexico to Brazil to meet with other Montoneros. The Argentine Intelligence Source had explained that they had been taken and interrogated, and later contacted their Mexican and Brazilian counterparts for approval to conduct an operation to capture the other Montoneros that were expecting their arrival. Once they were under custody, they had utilized fake documents to check into their hotel to impersonate their presence and not alert any other Montoneros of their capture. They were imprisoned at Campo de Mayo. It was also confirmed in this memo that if a Montonero was captured and investigated to later find that they weren&#x27;t a &quot;full fledged member or combantant&quot; they would be allowed limited freedom and able to contact their families periodically, so long as they leave the country and agree to not contact their family for months after their initial release.

After democracy was restored in Argentina in 1983, the government set up the National Commission for Forced Disappearances (CONADEP), led by writer Ernesto Sabato. It collected testimony from hundreds of witnesses about victims of the regime and known abuses, documenting hundreds of secret prisons and detention centers, and identifying leaders of the torture and death squads. Two years later, the &quot;Juicio a las Juntas&quot; (Trial of the Juntas) largely succeeded in proving the crimes of the top officers of the various &quot;juntas&quot; that had formed the self-styled National Reorganization Process. Most of the top officers put on trial were convicted and sentenced to life imprisonment, including Jorge Rafael Videla, Emilio Eduardo Massera, Roberto Eduardo Viola, Armando Lambruschini, Raúl Agosti, Rubén Graffigna, Leopoldo Galtieri, Jorge Anaya and Basilio Lami Dozo.

Under pressure from the military following these trials, Raúl Alfonsín&#x27;s government passed two amnesty laws protecting military officers involved in human rights abuses: the 1986 &quot;Ley de Punto Final&quot; (&quot;law of closure&quot;) and the 1987 &quot;Ley de Obediencia Debida&quot; (&quot;law of due obedience)&quot;, ending prosecution of crimes committed during the Dirty War. In 1989–1990, President Carlos Menem pardoned the leaders of the &quot;junta&quot; who were serving sentences in what he said was an attempt at healing and reconciliation.

In the late 1990s, due to attacks on American nationals in Argentina and revelations about CIA funding of the Argentine military, and after an explicit 1990 Congressional prohibition, U.S. President Bill Clinton ordered the declassification of thousands of State Department documents related to U.S.-Argentine activities going back to 1954. These documents revealed U.S. complicity in the Dirty War and Operation Condor.

Following continuous protests by the Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo and other human rights groups, in 2003 the Argentine Congress, counting on President Nestor Kirchner and the ruling majority on both chambers full support, repealed the amnesty laws. The Argentine Supreme Court under separate review declared them unconstitutional in June 2005. The court&#x27;s ruling enabled the government to renew the prosecution of crimes committed during the Dirty War.
DINA civil agent Enrique Arancibia Clavel, who was prosecuted in Argentina for crimes against humanity in 2004, was sentenced to life imprisonment for his part in the murder of General Prats. It has been claimed that suspected Italian terrorist Stefano Delle Chiaie was involved in the murder as well. He and fellow extremist Vincenzo Vinciguerra testified in Rome in December 1995 before federal judge María Servini de Cubría that DINA agents Clavel and Michael Townley were directly involved in this assassination. In 2003, Judge Servini de Cubría requested that Mariana Callejas (Michael Townley&#x27;s wife) and Cristoph Willikie, a retired colonel from the Chilean army, be extradited, as they were accused of also being involved in the murder. Chilean appeals court judge Nibaldo Segura refused extradition in July 2005 on the grounds that they had already been prosecuted in Chile.

On 5 March 2013, twenty-five former high-ranking military officers from Argentina and Uruguay went on trial in Buenos Aires, charged with conspiracy to &quot;kidnap, disappear, torture and kill&quot; 171 political opponents during the 1970s and 1980s. Among the defendants are former Argentine &quot;presidents&quot; Jorge Videla and Reynaldo Bignone, from the period of &quot;El Proceso.&quot; Prosecutors are basing their case in part on U.S. documents declassified in the 1990s and later, and obtained by the non-governmental organization, the National Security Archive, based at George Washington University in Washington, DC.

On 27 May 2016, fifteen ex-military officials were found guilty. Reynaldo Bignone received a sentence of 20 years in jail. Fourteen of the remaining 16 defendants got eight to 25 years. Two were found not guilty. Luz Palmás Zaldúa, a lawyer representing victims&#x27; families, contends that &quot;this ruling is important because it is the first time the existence of Operation Condor has been proved in court. It is also the first time that former members of Condor have been sentenced for forming part of this criminal organization&quot;.

=== Bolivia ===
In 2009, Bolivian president Evo Morales discovered the &quot;horror chambers&quot; underneath Bolivia&#x27;s Department of the Interior. Contractors excavated the basement and uncovered blocked hallways to discover cells &quot;where around 2,000 political prisoners were held and tortured during the 1971-1978 military rule under General Hugo Banzer&quot;. Deputy Interior Minister Marcos Farfan described his own time in the prison, where he was placed in a flooded cell, electrified from the ground, needled under his fingernails, and shocked via his genitals and teeth to extract information about Che Guevara. Nazi leader Klaus Barbie was Banzer&#x27;s advisor in the methods of torture. Evidence in 1999 linked these torture chambers to Operation Condor.

Barbie&#x27;s long-term presence in Bolivia, and his role as advisor to Hugo Banzer, can be traced back to Barbie&#x27;s relationship with US intelligence at the end of World War II. Historians writing for the Nazi War Criminal Records Interagency Working Group (IWG) established that the U.S. Army Intelligence Counterintelligence Corps had recruited Barbie for intelligence work in West Germany in April 1947, before facilitating his escape to South America &quot;via a &#x27;ratline&#x27; operating through Italy&quot;. Barbie&#x27;s cooperation with American intelligence was confirmed in a U.S. High Commission for Germany (HICOG) letter to New York Senator Jacob Javits. The letter established that &quot;Barbie was arrested by the United States Occupation Forces in Germany and his wartime activities were investigated. He was released when the results of this investigation proved inconclusive...From 1948 to 1951 Barbie was, as were many other Germans, an informant for the United States Occupation forces&quot;. Once in Bolivia, Barbie adopted the pseudonym &quot;Klaus Altman&quot;, and lived in La Paz under the cover of working for the Gehlen Organization-affiliated MEREX A.G. company, which facilitated arms deals with anti-communist Third World governments. Barbie&#x27;s identity was revealed in the early 1970s, but he was not extradited to France to stand trial for war crimes until 1983. During his trial, his relationship with US intelligence became more public. Allan Ryan, Director of the Office of Special Investigations, concluded in a 1983 memorandum that &quot;officers of the United States government were directly responsible for protecting a person wanted by the government of France on criminal charges and in arranging his escape from the law&quot;.

=== Brazil ===
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso ordered the release of some military files concerning Operation Condor in 2000.
There are documents that prove that, on that year attorney general Giancarlo Capaldo, an Italian magistrate, investigated the &quot;disappearances&quot; of Italian nationals in Latin America, likely due to actions of Argentine, Paraguayan, Chilean and Brazilian military personnel who tortured and murdered Italian citizens during the military dictatorships in Latin America. In the case of Brazilians accused of murder, kidnapping and torture, there was a list with the names of eleven Brazilians in addition to many high-ranking military personnel from other countries involved in the operation.

In the words of the Magistrate, on 26 October, 2000, &quot;[...] I can neither confirm nor deny because until December Argentine, Brazilian, Paraguayan and Chilean militaries [military personnel] will be subject to criminal trial...&quot;

According to an official statement by the Italian government, it was unclear whether the government would prosecute the accused military officers or not, , nobody in Brazil had been convicted of human rights violations for actions committed under the 21 years of military dictatorship because of the Amnesty Law has secured both governmental officials and leftist guerrillas over their crimes.

==== Kidnapping of Uruguayans ====
The Condor Operation expanded its clandestine repression from Uruguay to Brazil in November 1978, in an event later known as &quot;&quot;o Sequestro dos Uruguaios&quot;,&quot; or &quot;the Kidnapping of the Uruguayans&quot;. With the consent of the Brazilian military regime, senior officers of the Uruguayan army secretly crossed the border and entered Porto Alegre, capital of the State of Rio Grande do Sul. There they kidnapped Universindo Rodriguez and Lilián Celiberti, an activist Uruguayan couple of the political opposition, along with her two children, Camilo and Francesca, five and three years old.

The illegal operation failed because two Brazilian journalists, reporter Luiz Cláudio Cunha and photographer João Baptista Scalco from &quot;Veja&quot; magazine, had been warned by an anonymous phone call that the Uruguayan couple had been &quot;disappeared&quot;. To check on the information, the two journalists went to the given address: an apartment in Porto Alegre. When they arrived, the journalists were at first taken to be other political opposition members by the armed men who had arrested Celiberti, and they were arrested in turn. Universindo Rodriguez and the children had already been clandestinely taken to Uruguay.

When their identities were made clear, the journalists had exposed the secret operation by their presence. It was suspended. The exposure of the operation is believed to have prevented the murder of the couple and their two young children, as the news of the political kidnapping of Uruguayan nationals in Brazil made headlines in the Brazilian press. It became an international scandal. The military governments of both Brazil and Uruguay were embarrassed. A few days later, officials arranged for the Celibertis&#x27; children to be taken to their maternal grandparents in Montevideo. After Rodriguez and Celiberti were imprisoned and tortured in Brazil, they were taken to military prisons in Uruguay, and detained for the next five years. When democracy was restored in Uruguay in 1984, the couple were released. They confirmed all the published details of their kidnapping.

In 1980, Brazilian courts convicted two inspectors of DOPS (Department of Political and Social Order, an official police branch in charge of the political repression during the military regime) for having arrested the journalists in Lilian&#x27;s apartment in Porto Alegre. They were João Augusto da Rosa and Orandir Portassi Lucas. The reporters and the Uruguayans had identified them as taking part in the kidnapping. This event confirmed the direct involvement of the Brazilian government in the Condor Operation. In 1991, Governor Pedro Simon arranged for the state of Rio Grande do Sul to officially recognize the kidnapping of the Uruguayans and gave them financial compensation. The democratic government of President Luis Alberto Lacalle in Uruguay was inspired to do the same a year later.

Police officer Pedro Seelig, the head of the DOPS at the time of the kidnapping, was identified by the Uruguayan couple as the man in charge of the operation in Porto Alegre. While Seelig stood trial in Brazil, Universindo and Lílian remained in prison in Uruguay and were prevented from testifying. The Brazilian policeman was acquitted for lack of evidence. Lilian and Universindo&#x27;s later testimony revealed that four officers of the secret Uruguayan Counter-information Division—two majors and two captains—took part in the operation with the consent of Brazilian authorities. Captain Glauco Yanonne, was personally responsible for torturing Universindo Rodriquez in the DOPS headquarters in Porto Alegre. Although Universindo and Lilian identified the Uruguayan military men who had arrested and tortured them, not one was prosecuted in Montevideo. The Law of Immunity, passed in 1986, provided amnesty to Uruguayan citizens who had committed acts of political repression and human rights abuses under the dictatorship.

The 1979 Esso Prize, regarded as the most important prize of the Brazilian press, was awarded to Cunha and Scalco for their investigative journalism of the case. Hugo Cores, a former Uruguayan political prisoner, was the one who had called Cunha in warning. In 1993, he told the Brazilian press: &quot;All the Uruguayans kidnapped abroad, around 180 people, are missing to this day. The only ones who managed to survive are Lilian, her children, and Universindo&quot;.

==== Alleged assassination of João Goulart ====
After being overthrown, João Goulart was the first Brazilian president to die in exile. He died of an alleged heart attack in his sleep in Mercedes, Argentina, on 6 December 1976. Because an autopsy was never performed, the true cause of his death remains unknown.

On 26 April 2000, former governor of Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul Leonel Brizola, Goulart&#x27;s brother-in-law, alleged that former presidents Goulart and Juscelino Kubitschek (who died in a car accident) were assassinated as part of Operation Condor. He asked for investigations to be opened into their deaths.

On 27 January 2008, the newspaper &quot;Folha de S.Paulo&quot; printed a story with a statement from Mario Neira Barreiro, a former intelligence service member under Uruguay&#x27;s dictatorship. Barreiro said that Goulart was poisoned, confirming Brizola&#x27;s allegations. Barreiro also said that the order to assassinate Goulart came from Sérgio Paranhos Fleury, head of the Departamento de Ordem Política e Social (Department of Political and Social Order) and the licence to kill came from president Ernesto Geisel. In July 2008, a special commission of the Legislative Assembly of Rio Grande do Sul, Goulart&#x27;s home state, concluded that &quot;the evidence that Jango [Goulart] was willfully assassinated, with knowledge of the Geisel government, is strong&quot;.

In March 2009, the magazine &quot;CartaCapital&quot; published previously unreleased documents of the National Information Service created by an undercover agent who was present at Goulart&#x27;s properties in Uruguay. This revelation reinforces the theory that the former president was poisoned. The Goulart family has not yet identified who could be the &quot;B Agent&quot;, as he is referred to in the documents. The agent acted as a close friend to Goulart, and described in detail an argument during the former president&#x27;s 56th birthday party with his son because of a fight between two employees. As a result of the story, the Human Rights Commission of the Chamber of Deputies decided to investigate Goulart&#x27;s death.

Later, &quot;CartaCapital&quot; published an interview with Goulart&#x27;s widow, Maria Teresa Fontela Goulart, revealing documents from the Uruguayan government detailing her complaints that her family had been monitored. The Uruguayan government was monitoring Goulart&#x27;s travel, his business, and his political activities. These files were from 1965, a year after the coup in Brazil, and suggest that he could have been deliberately attacked. The Movement for Justice and Human Rights and the President João Goulart Institute have requested a document referring to the Uruguayan Interior Ministry saying that &quot;serious and responsible Brazilian sources&quot; talked about an &quot;alleged plot against the former Brazilian president&quot;.

Tests carried out by forensic experts in Brazil on Goulart&#x27;s exhumed remains revealed no evidence of poison. The autopsy concluded that his death was likely due to natural causes. Despite the findings from the forensic analysis, Brazil&#x27;s National Truth Commission is persisting with its investigation into the circumstances surrounding Goulart&#x27;s demise. Allegations suggested that Goulart&#x27;s medication for a heart condition had been swapped with poison by Uruguayan secret agents acting on behalf of the Brazilian dictatorship. Goulart&#x27;s body was exhumed for examination to address suspicions of foul play, within the larger framework of Operation Condor which targeted opposition activists.

=== Chile ===

When Augusto Pinochet was arrested in London in 1998 in response to Spanish magistrate Baltasar Garzón&#x27;s request for his extradition to Spain, additional information concerning Condor was revealed. One of the lawyers seeking his extradition said there had been an attempt to assassinate Carlos Altamirano, leader of the Chilean Socialist Party. He said that Pinochet met Italian neo-fascist terrorist Stefano Delle Chiaie during Francisco Franco&#x27;s funeral in Madrid in 1975 and arranged to have Altamirano murdered. The plan failed. Chilean judge Juan Guzmán Tapia eventually established a precedent concerning the crime of &quot;permanent kidnapping&quot;: since the bodies of victims kidnapped and presumably murdered could not be found, he deemed that the kidnapping was thought to continue, rather than to have occurred so long ago that the perpetrators were protected by an amnesty decreed in 1978 or by the Chilean statute of limitations. In November 2015, the Chilean government acknowledged that Pablo Neruda might have been murdered by members of Pinochet&#x27;s regime.

==== General Carlos Prats ====
General Carlos Prats and his wife, Sofía Cuthbert were killed by a car bomb on 30 September 1974, in Buenos Aires, where they lived in exile. The Chilean DINA has been held responsible. In Chile, Judge Alejandro Solís terminated the prosecution of Pinochet in January 2005 after the Chilean Supreme court rejected his demand to revoke Pinochet&#x27;s immunity from prosecution (as chief of state). The leaders of DINA, including chief Manuel Contreras, ex-chief of operations and retired general Raúl Itturiaga Neuman, his brother Roger Itturiaga, and ex-brigadiers Pedro Espinoza Bravo and José Zara, were charged in Chile with this assassination. DINA agent Enrique Arancibia Clavel has been convicted in Argentina for the murder.

==== Bernardo Leighton ====
Bernardo Leighton and his wife were severely injured by a failed assassination attempt on 6 Oct. 1975, after settling in exile in Italy. The pistol attack left Bernardo Leighton seriously injured and his wife, Anita Fresno, permanently disabled. According to declassified documents in the National Security Archive and Italian attorney general Giovanni Salvi, who led the prosecution of former DINA head Manuel Contreras, Stefano Delle Chiaie met with Michael Townley and Virgilio Paz Romero in Madrid in 1975 to plan the murder of Bernardo Leighton with the help of Francisco Franco&#x27;s secret police. In 1999, the secretary of the National Security Council (NSC), Glyn T. Davies, declared that the declassified documents established the responsibility of Pinochet government in carrying out the assassination of Bernardo Leighton, as well as Orlando Letelier and General Carlos Prats. a failed assassination attempt on 6 October 1975.

==== Orlando Letelier ====

In December 2004, Francisco Letelier, the son of Orlando Letelier, wrote in an OpEd column in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; that his father&#x27;s assassination was part of Operation Condor, which he described as &quot;an intelligence-sharing network used by six South American dictators of that era to eliminate dissidents&quot;.

Michael Townley has accused Pinochet of being responsible for Letelier&#x27;s death. Townley confessed that he had hired five anti-Castro Cuban exiles to booby-trap Letelier&#x27;s car. According to Jean-Guy Allard, after consultations with the terrorist organization CORU&#x27;s leadership, including Luis Posada Carriles and Orlando Bosch, those elected to carry out the murder were Cuban-Americans José Dionisio Suárez, Virgilio Paz Romero, Alvin Ross Díaz, and brothers Guillermo and Ignacio Novo Sampoll. According to the &quot;Miami Herald&quot;, Luis Posada Carriles was at this meeting, which decided on Letelier&#x27;s death and also the Cubana Flight 455 bombing.

==== Caso Quemados ====
In July 1986, photographer Rodrigo Rojas de Negri was burned alive and Carmen Gloria Quintana suffered serious burns during a street protests against Pinochet. The two&#x27;s case became known as &quot;Caso Quemados&quot; (&quot;The Burned Case&quot;) and the case received attention in the United States because Rojas had fled to the US after the 1973 coup. A document by the U.S. State Department highlights that the Chilean army deliberately set both Rojas and Quintana on fire. Pinochet, on the other hand, accused both Rojas and Quintana of being terrorists who were set ablaze by their own Molotov cocktails. According to National Security Archive analyst Peter Kornbluh, Pinochet&#x27;s reaction to the attack and death of Rojas &quot;contributed to Reagan&#x27;s decision to withdraw support for the regime and press for a return to civilian rule&quot;.

==== Operación Silencio ====
Operación Silencio (&quot;Operation Silence&quot;) was a Chilean operation to impede investigations by Chilean judges by removing witnesses from the country. It started about a year before the &quot;terror archives&quot; were found in Paraguay.

In April 1991, Arturo Sanhueza Ross, linked to the murder of MIR leader Jecar Neghme in 1989, left the country. According to the &quot;Rettig Report,&quot; Jecar Neghme&#x27;s death had been carried out by Chilean intelligence agents. In September 1991, Carlos Herrera Jiménez, who killed trade-unionist Tucapel Jiménez, left by plane. In October 1991, Eugenio Berríos, a chemist who had worked with DINA agent Michael Townley, was escorted from Chile to Uruguay by Operation Condor agents in order to avoid testifying in the Letelier case. He used Argentine, Uruguayan, Paraguayan and Brazilian passports, raising concerns that Operation Condor was not dead. Berríos was found dead in El Pinar, near Montevideo (Uruguay), in 1995. His body had been so mutilated as to make identification by appearance impossible.

In January 2005, Michael Townley, who now lives in the U.S. under the witness protection program, acknowledged links between Chile, DINA, and the detention and torture center Colonia Dignidad. The center was established in 1961 by Paul Schäfer, who was arrested in March 2005 in Buenos Aires and convicted on charges of child rape. Townley informed Interpol about Colonia Dignidad and the Army&#x27;s Bacteriological Warfare Laboratory. This last laboratory would have replaced the old DINA laboratory on Via Naranja de lo Curro street, where Townley worked with the chemical assassin Eugenio Berríos. The toxin that allegedly killed Christian-Democrat Eduardo Frei Montalva may have been made in this new lab in Colonia Dignidad, according to the judge investigating the case. In 2013, a Brazilian-Uruguayan-Argentine collaborative documentary, &quot;Dossiê Jango&quot;, implicated the same lab in the alleged poisoning of João Goulart, Brazil&#x27;s deposed president.

==== U.S. Congressman Edward Koch ====
In February 2004, reporter John Dinges published &quot;The Condor Years: How Pinochet and His Allies Brought Terrorism to Three Continents&quot;. He revealed that Uruguayan military officials threatened to assassinate U.S. Congressman Edward Koch (later Mayor of New York City) in mid-1976. In late July 1976, the CIA station chief in Montevideo had received information about it. Based on learning that the men were drinking at the time, he recommended that the CIA take no action. The Uruguayan officers included Colonel José Fons, who was at the November 1975 secret meeting in Santiago, Chile; and Major José Nino Gavazzo, who headed a team of intelligence officers working in Argentina in 1976 and was responsible for the death of more than 100 Uruguayans.

Interviewed in the early 21st century by Dinges, Koch said that George H. W. Bush, then CIA director, informed him in October 1976 that &quot;his sponsorship of legislation to cut off U.S. military assistance to Uruguay on human rights grounds had provoked secret police officials to &#x27;put a contract out for you&#x27;&quot;. In mid-October 1976, Koch wrote to the Justice Department asking for FBI protection, but none was provided. (This was more than two months after the meeting and after Orlando Letelier&#x27;s murder in Washington.) In late 1976, Colonel Fons and Major Gavazzo were assigned to prominent diplomatic posts in Washington, D.C. The State Department forced the Uruguayan government to withdraw their appointments, with the public explanation that &quot;Fons and Gavazzo could be the objects of unpleasant publicity&quot;. Koch learned about the connections between the threats and the post appointments only in 2001.

=== Paraguay ===
The United States backed Alfredo Stroessner&#x27;s anti-communist military dictatorship and played a &quot;critical supporting role&quot; in the domestic affairs of Stroessner&#x27;s Paraguay. For instance, when Stroessner established a special branch of the secret police, subordinate to the Ministry of Internal Affairs - the National Directorate of Technical Affairs (Dirección Nacional de Asuntos Técnicos, DNAT), U.S. Army officer Lieutenant Colonel Robert Thierry was sent to help set up the organization and find recruits, ultimately settling on Antonio Campos Alum as head of this organization (nicknamed &quot;La Technica&quot;) which would carry out disappearances and torture in Paraguay. Another branch, the Department of Investigations of the Metropolitan Police (Departamento de Investigaciones de la Policía de la Capital, DIPC), headed by Pastor Coronel, interrogated their captives in tubs of human vomit and excrement and shocked them in the rectum with electric cattle prods. They dismembered the Communist Party Secretary, Miguel Ángel Soler, alive with a chainsaw while Stroessner listened on the phone. Stroessner demanded the tapes of detainees screaming in pain to be played to their family members.

In a report to Kissinger, Harry Shlaudeman described Paraguay&#x27;s militaristic state as a &quot;nineteenth-century military regime that looks good on the cartoon page&quot;. Shlaudeman&#x27;s judgments adopted a tone of paternalism, but was correct in noting that Paraguay&#x27;s &quot;backwardness&quot; was leading it toward the fate of its neighbors. Although the United States viewed conflict from a global and ideological perspective, many decolonized nations defined national security threats in terms of neighboring nations and longstanding ethnic or regional feuds. Shlaudeman notes the incredible resilience that Paraguay showed against the superior military might of its neighbors during the Chaco War. From the perspective of the government in Paraguay, the victory against its neighbors over the course of several decades justified the lack of development in the nation. The report further states that the political traditions in Paraguay were anything but democratic. This reality, combined with a fear of leftist dissent in neighboring nations, led the government to focus on the containment of political opposition instead of on the development of its economic and political institutions. An ideological fear of its neighbors compelled them to protect its sovereignty. Therefore, the fight against radical, leftist movements within and without the country motivated many policymakers to act in the interest of security. In 2020, French writer Pablo Daniel Magee published the book &quot;Opération Condor&quot; prefaced by Costa Gavras. The book follows the life of Paraguayan victim of the Condor Operation Martín Almada.

=== Peru ===

The Peruvian legislator Javier Diez Canseco declared that he and twelve colleagues (Justiniano Apaza Ordóñez, Hugo Blanco, Genaro Ledesma Izquieta, Valentín Pacho, Ricardo Letts, César Lévano, Ricardo Napurí, José Luis Alvarado Bravo, Alfonso Baella Tuesta, Guillermo Faura Gaig, José Arce Larco, and Humberto Damonte), all prominent opponents of the dictatorship of Francisco Morales Bermúdez, were kidnapped in Peru, expatriated in 1978 and handed over to the Argentine armed forces in the city of Jujuy. Canseco added that there is declassified documentation of the CIA and cable information which account for the links of the Morales Bermúdez government with Operation Condor.

=== Uruguay ===

As per usual with Southern Cone 1970s dictatorships, Juan María Bordaberry proclaimed himself a dictator and banned the rest of political parties. The &quot;de facto&quot; government spanned from 1973 to 1985, in which period a considerable number of people were murdered, tortured, illegally detained and imprisoned, kidnapped and forced into disappearance, in the purported defence against subversion. Prior to the 1973 coup d&#x27;état, the CIA had acted as a consultant to the law enforcement agencies in the country. Dan Mitrione, the best known example of such cooperation, had trained civilian police in counterinsurgency at the School of the Americas in Panama, known as the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation after 2000.

=== Other cases ===
Edgardo Enríquez, Chilean leader of the MIR, &quot;disappeared&quot; in Argentina, as did the MIR leader Jorge Fuentes. Alexei Jaccard and Ricardo Ramírez were &quot;disappeared&quot;, and a support network to the Communist party was dismantled in Argentina in 1977. Cases of repression in the country against German, Spanish, Peruvian, and Jewish people were also reported. The assassinations of former Bolivian president Juan José Torres and former Uruguayan deputies Héctor Gutiérrez and Zelmar Michelini in Buenos Aires in 1976 were also part of Condor. The DINA contacted Croatian terrorists (i.e., Ustashe émigrés and descendants), Italian neo-fascists, and the Shah&#x27;s SAVAK to locate and assassinate dissidents in exile.

According to reports in 2006, resulting from trials of top officials in Argentina, Operation Condor was at its peak in 1976 when Chilean exiles in Argentina were threatened; many went underground or into exile again in other countries. Chilean General Carlos Prats had been assassinated by DINA in Buenos Aires in 1974, with the help of former CIA agent Michael Townley. Cuban diplomats were assassinated in Buenos Aires in the &quot;Automotores Orletti&quot; torture center, one of the 300 clandestine prisons of the dictatorship. These centers were managed by the &quot;Grupo de Tareas 18&quot;, headed by former police officer and intelligence agent Aníbal Gordon, earlier convicted of armed robbery, who reported directly to General Commandant of the SIDE, Otto Paladino.

&quot;Automotores Orletti&quot; was the main base of foreign intelligence services involved in Operation Condor. José Luis Bertazzo, a survivor of kidnapping and torture who was detained there for two months, identified Chilean, Uruguayan, Paraguayan and Bolivian nationals held as prisoners and who were interrogated by agents from their own countries. The 19-year-old daughter-in-law of poet Juan Gelman was tortured here along with her husband, before being transported to a Montevideo prison. There she delivered a baby which was immediately stolen by Uruguayan military officers and placed for illegal adoption with friends of the regime. Decades later, President Jorge Batlle ordered an investigation and finally, Macarena Gelman was found and recovered her identity.

According to Dinges&#x27; book &quot;Los años del Cóndor&quot; (The Years of the Condor), Chilean MIR prisoners in the Orletti center told José Luis Bertazzo that they had seen two Cuban diplomats, 22-year-old Jesús Cejas Arias and 26-year-old Crescencio Galañega, tortured by Gordon&#x27;s group. They were interrogated by a man who had travelled from Miami to interrogate them. The Cuban nationals had been responsible for protection of Cuban ambassador to Argentina, Emilio Aragonés. They were kidnapped on 9 August 1976, at the corner of calle Arribeños and Virrey del Pino, by 40 armed SIDE agents, who blocked the street with their Ford Falcons. (These were the car models used by the security forces during the dictatorship.)

According to Dinges, the FBI and the CIA were informed of their arrest. He quotes a cable sent from Buenos Aires by FBI agent Robert Scherrer on 22 September 1976, in which he mentioned that Michael Townley, later convicted for the assassination of former Chilean minister Orlando Letelier in Washington, D.C., had taken part in the interrogations of the two Cubans. On 22 December 1999, the former head of the DINA confirmed to Argentine federal judge María Servini de Cubría in Santiago de Chile that Michael Townley and Cuban Guillermo Novo Sampoll were present in the Orletti center. They had travelled from Chile to Argentina on 11 August 1976 and &quot;cooperated in the torture and assassination of the two Cuban diplomats&quot;. Luis Posada Carriles, an anti-Castro Cuban terrorist, boasted in his autobiography, &quot;Los Caminos Del Guerrero&quot; (The Roads of the Warrior), of the murder of the two young men.

== U.S. involvement ==


The United States documentation shows that the United States provided key organizational, financial and technical assistance to the operation into the 1980s.

In a United States Department of State briefing for Henry Kissinger, then the Secretary of State, dated 3 August 1976 written by Harry Shlaudeman and entitled the &quot;Third World War and South America&quot;, the long-term dangers of a right-wing bloc and their initial policy recommendations were considered. The briefing was a summary of Southern Cone security forces. It stated that the operation was an effort of six countries in the southern cone of Latin America (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Paraguay, and Uruguay) to win the &quot;Third-World-War&quot; by wiping out &quot;subversion&quot; through transnational secret intelligence activities, kidnapping, torture, disappearance and assassination. The report opens by considering the cohesiveness felt by the six nations of the Southern Cone. It was the assumption of the Shlaudeman&#x27;s briefing that the countries in the Southern Cone perceived themselves as &quot;the last bastion of Christian civilization&quot; and thus they consider the efforts against communism as justified as the &quot;Israeli actions against Palestinian terrorists&quot;. Shlaudeman warns Kissinger that in the long term the &quot;Third World War&quot; would put those six countries in an ambiguous position because they are trapped on either side by &quot;international Marxism and its terrorist exponents&quot;, and on the other by &quot;the hostility of uncomprehending industrial democracies misled by the Marxist propaganda&quot;. The report recommended that U.S. policy towards Operation Condor should emphasize the differences between the five countries at every opportunity, to depoliticize human rights, to oppose rhetorical exaggerations of the &quot;Third-World-War&quot; type, and bring the potential bloc-members back-into our cognitive universe through systematic exchanges. According to the final statement, these suggestions were part of an attempt to convince the nations involved that the Third World War is not desirable.

Based on 1976 CIA documents stated that from 1960 to the early 1970s, the plans were developed among international security officials at the US Army School of the Americas and the Conference of American Armies to deal with political dissidents in South America. A declassified CIA document dated 23 June 1976, explains that &quot;in early 1974, security officials from Argentina, Chile, Uruguay, Paraguay and Bolivia met in Buenos Aires to prepare coordinated actions against subversive targets&quot;. US officials were aware of what was going on. 

Additionally, as of a September 1976, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that US intelligence services were quite aware of the infrastructure and goals of Operation Condor. They realized that &quot;Operation Condor&quot; was the code name given for intelligence collection on &quot;leftists&quot;, Communists, Peronists or Marxists in the Southern Cone Area. The intelligence services were aware that it was security cooperation among several South American countries&#x27; intelligence services (such as Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay, and Bolivia) with Chile as the epicenter of the operation. The DIA noted that Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile were already fervently conducting operations, mainly in Argentina, against leftist targets. Members of SIDE were also operating with Uruguayan military Intelligence officers in an operation carried out against the Uruguayan terrorist organization, the OPR-33. The report also noted that a large volume of U.S. currency was seized during the combined operation.

The third point of the report demonstrates the United States&#x27; understanding of Operation Condor&#x27;s more nefarious operations. The report notes, &quot;the formation of special teams from member countries who are to carry out operations to include assassinations against terrorist or supporters of terrorist organizations&quot;. This report goes more in detail about how operation of the special teams would be carried out. As an example of a special team, the special team organized in Argentina was made up of members of the Argentina Army Intelligence Service and the State Secretariat for Information. The report also highlighted the fact that these special teams were intelligence service agents rather than military personnel, however these teams did operate in structures reminiscent of U.S. special forces teams. Mentioning specifically a medic (doctor) and demolition expert. The State Department briefing for Kissinger mentioned awareness of Operation Condor&#x27;s plans to conduct possible operations in France and Portugal – a matter that would be prove to be extremely controversial later in Condor&#x27;s history.

The US government sponsored and collaborated with DINA (Directorate of National Intelligence), as well as other intelligence organizations forming the nucleus of Condor. CIA documents show that the agency had close contact with members of the Chilean secret police, DINA, and its chief Manuel Contreras. Contreras was retained as a paid CIA contact until 1977, even as his involvement in the Letelier-Moffit assassination was being revealed.

The Paraguayan Archives include official requests to track suspects to and from the U.S. Embassy, the CIA, and FBI. The CIA provided lists of suspects and other intelligence information to the military states. In 1975 the FBI searched in the US for individuals wanted by DINA.

In a February 1976 telecom from the embassy in Buenos Aires to the State Department, intelligence noted the United States possessed awareness of the coming Argentine coup. The ambassador wrote that the Chief of the North American desk of the Foreign Ministry revealed that he had been asked by the &quot;Military Planning Group&quot; to prepare a report and recommendations for how the &quot;future military government can avoid or minimize the sort of problems the Chilean and Uruguayan governments are having with the US over human rights issue&quot;. The Chief also specifically stated that &quot;they&quot; (whether he is referring to the CIA or the future military government in Argentina, or both) will face resistance if they were to begin assassinating and executing individuals. This being true, the ambassador explains the military coup will &quot;intend to carry forward an all-out war on the terrorists and that some executions would therefore probably be necessary&quot;. This signals that the US also was aware of the planning of human rights violations before they occurred and did not step in to prevent them, despite being entangled in the region&#x27;s politics already. The last comment confirms this: &quot;It is encouraging to note that the Argentine military are aware of the problem and are already focusing on ways to avoid letting human rights issues become an irritant in US-Argentine Relations&quot;.

Regarding the ongoing human rights abuses by the Argentine junta, Professor Ruth Blakeley writes that Kissinger &quot;explicitly expressed his support for the repression of political opponents&quot;. On 5 October 1976 Henry Kissinger met with Argentina&#x27;s foreign finister and said:

Ultimately, the démarche was never delivered. Kornbluh and Dinges suggest that the decision not to send Kissinger&#x27;s order was due to Assistant Secretary Harry Shlaudeman&#x27;s sending a cable to his deputy in D.C which states &quot;you can simply instruct the Ambassadors to take no further action, noting that there have been no reports in some weeks indicating an intention to activate the Condor scheme&quot;. McSherry adds, &quot;According to [U.S. Ambassador to Paraguay Robert] White, instructions from a secretary of state cannot be ignored unless there is a countermanding order received via a secret (CIA) backchannel&quot;.

A 1978 cable from the US ambassador to Paraguay, Robert White, to the Secretary of State Cyrus Vance revealed that the South American intelligence chiefs involved in Condor &quot;[kept] in touch with one another through a U.S. communications installation in the Panama Canal Zone which cover[ed] all of Latin America&quot;.

General Alejandro Fretes Davalos, the chief of staff of Paraguay&#x27;s armed forces, informed Ambassador White that this US communications installation in the Panama Canal Zone was &quot;employed to coordinate intelligence information among the southern cone countries&quot;. McSherry describes these cables as &quot;another piece of increasingly weighty evidence suggesting that U.S. military and intelligence officials supported and collaborated with Condor as a secret partner or sponsor&quot;. An Argentine military source also told a U.S. Embassy contact that the CIA was privy to Condor and had played a key role in setting up computerized links among the intelligence and operations units of the six Condor states.

Patricia M. Derian, the Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights and Humanitarian Affairs from 1977 to 1981, said of Kissinger&#x27;s role in giving the green light to the junta&#x27;s repression: &quot;It sickened me that with an imperial wave of his hand, an American could sentence people to death&quot;. During the Carter administration, Kissinger congratulated the Argentine military for &quot;wiping out terrorism&quot;, and visited the country as a guest of Jorge Videla during the 1978 World Cup. US diplomats feared that this would hinder the Carter Administration&#x27;s efforts to end the killings by the Argentine junta.

=== Declassification and reflection ===

In June 1999, by order of President Bill Clinton, the State Department released thousands of declassified documents revealing for the first time that the CIA and the State and Defense Departments were intimately aware of Condor. One DOD intelligence report dated 1 October 1976, noted that Latin American military officers bragged about it to their U.S. counterparts. The same report described Condor&#x27;s &quot;joint counterinsurgency operations&quot; that aimed to &quot;eliminate Marxist terrorist activities&quot;; Argentina, it noted, created a special Condor team &quot;structured much like a U.S. Special Forces Team&quot;. A summary of material declassified in 2004 stated that:

Kornbluh and Dinges conclude that &quot;The paper trail is clear: the State Department and the CIA had enough intelligence to take concrete steps to thwart the Condor assassination planning. Those steps were initiated but never implemented&quot;. Shlaudeman&#x27;s deputy Hewson Ryan later acknowledged in an oral history interview that the State Department was &quot;remiss&quot; in its handling of the case. &quot;We knew fairly early on that the governments of the Southern Cone countries were planning, or at least talking about, some assassinations abroad in the summer of 1976. ... Whether if we had gone in, we might have prevented this, I don&#x27;t know&quot;, he stated in reference to the Letelier-Moffitt bombing. &quot;But we didn&#x27;t&quot;.

Other declassified documents further demonstrate the level of knowledge the CIA and State Department had about Condor. In a comprehensive intelligence report from 1 October 1976, the Department of Defense Intelligence stated which Southern Cone countries were participating in the operation, noting that Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile were the most &quot;enthusiastic&quot; about providing intelligence. The document also detailed a joint operation between Uruguayan intelligence agents and Argentine State Secretariat members that targeted a section of the Uruguayan group, OPR-33, in Argentina. The prospect of the operation Condor having the possibility to result in assassinations is noted as well, showing that the U.S. aware of this outcome.

A CIA document described Condor as &quot;a counter-terrorism organization&quot; and noted that the Condor countries had a specialized telecommunications system called &quot;CONDORTEL&quot;. A 1978 cable from the US ambassador to Paraguay, Robert White, to the Secretary of State Cyrus Vance, was published on 6 March 2001 by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The document was released in November 2000 by the Clinton administration under the Chile Declassification Project. White reported a conversation with General Alejandro Fretes Davalos, chief of staff of Paraguay&#x27;s armed forces, who informed him that the South American intelligence chiefs involved in Condor &quot;[kept] in touch with one another through a U.S. communications installation in the Panama Canal Zone which cover[ed] all of Latin America&quot;.

Davalos reportedly said that the installation was &quot;employed to co-ordinate intelligence information among the southern cone countries&quot;. The US feared that the connection to Condor might be publicly revealed at a time when the assassination in the U.S. of Chilean former minister Orlando Letelier and his American assistant Ronni Moffitt was being investigated. White cabled Vance that &quot;it would seem advisable to review this arrangement to insure that its continuation is in US interest&quot;. McSherry describes such cables as &quot;another piece of increasingly weighty evidence suggesting that U.S. military and intelligence officials supported and collaborated with Condor as a secret partner or sponsor&quot;. In addition, an Argentine military source told a U.S. Embassy contact that the CIA was privy to Condor and had played a key role in setting up computerized links among the intelligence and operations units of the six Condor states.

=== Role of Henry Kissinger ===

Henry Kissinger, Secretary of State in the Nixon and Ford administrations, was well aware of the Condor plan and was closely involved diplomatically with the Southern Cone governments. He was Jorge Videla&#x27;s personal guest to the 1978 World Cup in Argentina, after his tenure as Secretary of State concluded. According to the French newspaper , the first cooperation agreements were signed between the CIA and anti-Castro groups, and the right-wing death squad Triple A, set up in Argentina by Juan and Isabel Perón&#x27;s &quot;personal secretary&quot; José López Rega, and Rodolfo Almirón (arrested in Spain in 2006).

Henry Kissinger, the Secretary of State at the time, was deeply involved in Operation Condor plans. He was well aware of the movement to illegally remove or assassinate leftist and assumed communists, to push forward a dictatorship. CIA documents declassified in 2023 reveal Kissinger&#x27;s involvement with Chilean dictator Augusto Pinochet. On 8 June 1976, Kissinger met privately with Pinochet. Their conversation was documented. Prior to this meeting, Kissinger had been briefed about the ongoing crisis of human rights violations under Pinochet&#x27;s rule in Chile, as well as the observations of Chile as a tyrannical state. Kissinger claimed to be &#x27;sympathetic&#x27; to what they were doing in Chile. He argued that the Chilean government was fighting the Communists and the propaganda of the communist media. While recognizing the human rights issues that needed to be addressed to avoid legislative restrictions, Kissinger assured Pinochet that they were on the same team, &quot;you are a victim of all left-wing groups around the world and that your greatest sin was that you overthrew a government which was going communist&quot;. Kissinger recognized that the US could not openly assist a human rights violation, but would not undermine Pinochet.

In New York on 7 October 1976, Henry Kissinger met with the Argentine foreign minister, Cesar Guzetti. They discussed the current regime and the eradication of the left. Kissinger was not against the oppressive regime. The declassified document shows the willingness of Kissinger to assist Guzetti and the Argentine dictatorship removing leftists. When referring to the humanitarian crisis, Kissinger acknowledges the &#x27;civil war&#x27; and the humanitarian issues within Argentina, while expressing to Guzetti that the government needs to move fast in the removal of supposed communists, &quot;the quicker you succeed the better&quot;.

On 31 May 2001, French judge Roger Le Loire requested that a summons be served on Kissinger while he was staying at the Hôtel Ritz in Paris. Le Loire wanted to question the statesman as a witness regarding alleged U.S. involvement in Operation Condor and for possible US knowledge concerning the &quot;disappearances&quot; of five French nationals in Chile during military rule. Kissinger left Paris that evening, and Loire&#x27;s inquiries were directed to the U.S. State Department.

In July 2001, the Chilean high court granted investigating judge Juan Guzmán the right to question Kissinger about the 1973 killing of American journalist Charles Horman. His execution by the Chilean military after the coup was dramatized in the 1982 Costa-Gavras film &quot;Missing&quot;. The judge&#x27;s questions were relayed to Kissinger via diplomatic routes but were not answered.

In August 2001, Argentine Judge Rodolfo Canicoba sent a letter rogatory to the US State Department, in accordance with the Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT), requesting a deposition by Kissinger to aid the judge&#x27;s investigation of Operation Condor. In 2002, the editors of &quot;The New York Times&quot; defended Henry Kissinger, arguing that he should be given a pass for his role in Condor and other dirty works because &quot;the world was polarised, and fighting communism involved hard choices and messy compromises&quot;.

On 16 February 2007, a request for the extradition of Kissinger was filed at the Supreme Court of Uruguay on behalf of Bernardo Arnone, a political activist who was kidnapped, tortured and disappeared by the dictatorial regime in 1976.

It was discovered in 2010 that Kissinger canceled a warning against the international assassination of political opponents that was to be issued to some of the countries participating in Operation Condor.

== &quot;French connection&quot; ==
French journalist Marie-Monique Robin found in the archives of the Quai d&#x27;Orsay, the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the original document proving that a 1959 agreement between Paris and Buenos Aires set up a &quot;permanent French military mission&quot; of officers to Argentina who had fought in the Algerian War. It was located in the offices of the chief of staff of the Argentine Army. It continued until François Mitterrand was elected President of France in 1981.

In 1957, Argentine officers, among them Alcides Lopez Aufranc, went to Paris to attend two-year courses at the École de Guerre military school, two years before the Cuban Revolution, and before the rise of anti-government guerrilla movements in Argentina. &quot;In practice&quot;, said Robin to &quot;Página/12&quot;, &quot;the arrival of the French in Argentina led to a massive extension of intelligence services and of the use of torture as the primary weapon of anti-subversive war in the concept of modern warfare&quot;. The &quot;annihilation decrees&quot; signed by Isabel Perón were inspired by earlier French documents.

During the Battle of Algiers, police forces were put under the authority of the French Army, and in particular of the paratroopers. They systematically used torture during interrogations and also began to &quot;disappear&quot; suspects, as part of a program of intimidation. Reynaldo Bignone, named President of the Argentine junta in July 1982, said, &quot;The March 1976 order of battle is a copy of the Algerian battle&quot;.

On 10 September 2003, French Green Party deputies Noël Mamère, Martine Billard and Yves Cochet petitioned for a Parliamentary Commission to be established to examine the &quot;role of France in the support of military regimes in Latin America from 1973 to 1984&quot; before the Foreign Affairs Commission of the National Assembly, presided by Édouard Balladur. The only newspaper to report this was . Deputy Roland Blum, in charge of the commission, refused to allow Marie-Monique Robin to testify. The government&#x27;s report in December 2003 was described by Robin as being in the utmost bad faith. It claimed that no agreement had ever been signed on this issue between France and Argentina.

When French Minister of Foreign Affairs Dominique de Villepin traveled to Chile in February 2004, he claimed that there had been no cooperation between France and the military regimes.

Reporter Marie-Monique Robin said to newspaper: &quot;The French have systematized a military technique in the urban environment which would be copied and passed to Latin American dictatorships&quot;. The methods employed during the 1957 Battle of Algiers were systematized and exported to the War School in Buenos Aires. Roger Trinquier&#x27;s famous book on counter-insurgency had a very strong influence in South America. Robin said that she was shocked to learn that the French intelligence agency Direction de surveillance du territoire (DST) communicated to the DINA the names of refugees who returned to Chile (Operation Retorno), all of whom were killed. &quot;Of course, this puts the French government in the dock, and Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, then President of the Republic. I was very shocked by the duplicity of the French diplomatic position which, at the same time received political refugees with open arms, and collaborated with the dictatorships&quot;.

Marie-Monique Robin also showed ties between the French far right and Argentina since the 1930s, in particular through the Roman Catholic fundamentalist organization &quot;Cité catholique&quot; created by Jean Ousset, a former secretary of Charles Maurras (founder of the royalist &quot;Action Française&quot; movement). &quot;La Cité&quot; published a review, &quot;Le Verbe&quot;, which influenced military officers during the Algerian War, notably by justifying their use of torture. At the end of the 1950s, the &quot;Cité catholique&quot; established groups in Argentina and set up cells in the Army. It was greatly expanded during the government of General Juan Carlos Onganía, in particular in 1969.

The key figure of the &quot;Cité catholique&quot; was priest Georges Grasset, who became Videla&#x27;s personal confessor. He had been the spiritual guide of the Organisation armée secrète (OAS), a pro-French Algeria terrorist movement founded in Francoist Spain. Robin says that this Catholic fundamentalist current in the Argentine Army contributed to the importance and duration of Franco-Argentine cooperation. In Buenos Aires, Georges Grasset maintained links with Archbishop Marcel Lefebvre, founder of the Society of St. Pius X in 1970. He was excommunicated in 1988. The Society of Pius-X has four monasteries in Argentina, the largest in La Reja. A French priest there said to Marie-Monique Robin: &quot;to save the soul of a Communist priest, one must kill him&quot;. Luis Roldan, former Under Secretary of Religion under Carlos Menem (President of Argentina from 1989 to 1999), was presented to her by Dominique Lagneau, the priest in charge of the monastery, and described as &quot;Mr. Cité catholique in Argentina&quot;. Bruno Genta and Juan Carlos Goyeneche represent this ideology.

Argentine Admiral Luis María Mendía, who had theorized the practice of &quot;death flights&quot;, testified in January 2007 before Argentine judges that a French intelligence &quot;agent&quot;, Bertrand de Perseval, had participated in the abduction of two French nuns, Léonie Duquet and Alice Domon, who were later murdered. Perseval, who lives today in Thailand, denied any links with the abduction. He has admitted being a former member of the OAS, and having escaped for Argentina after the March 1962 Évian Accords that ended the Algerian War (1954–62). Referring to Marie Monique Robin&#x27;s film documentary titled &quot;The Death Squads – the French School&quot; (&quot;Les escadrons de la mort – l&#x27;école française&quot;), Luis María Mendía asked of the Argentine Court that former French president Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing, former French premier Pierre Messmer, former French ambassador to Buenos Aires François de la Gorce, and all officials in place in the French embassy in Buenos Aires between 1976 and 1983 be called before the court.

Besides this &quot;French connection&quot;, he has also accused former head of state Isabel Perón and former ministers Carlos Ruckauf and Antonio Cafiero, who had signed the &quot;anti-subversion decrees&quot; before Videla&#x27;s 1976 coup d&#x27;état. According to ESMA survivor Graciela Daleo, this tactic tries to claim that the crimes were legitimised by Isabel Perón&#x27;s &quot;anti-subversion decrees&quot;. She notes that torture is forbidden by the Argentine Constitution. Alfredo Astiz, a marine known as the &quot;Blond Angel of Death&quot; because of his torture, also referred to the &quot;French connection&quot; at his trial.

== Europe ==
As showed in a declassified CIA document, in 1977 intelligence agencies from Britain, France and West Germany looked into using the tactics employed in Operation Condor against leftwing &quot;subversives&quot; in their own countries. The agencies sent representatives to the Condor organization secretariat in Buenos Aires in September 1977 in order to discuss how to establish an &quot;anti-subversion organization similar to Condor&quot;, where the agencies would pool their resources into a single organization. The intention was for the agencies to act in a coordinated fashion against subversives within member countries in Europe.

== Legal actions ==

=== Italy ===
In December 2000, the Italian Justice began the trial of eleven Brazilians, all military and police. They were accused of the disappearance of three Argentines of Italian descent. The Brazilians were active in Operation Condor. Due to the secrecy of justice, the results of the trials and the punishments of the criminals, if any, were not reported. In December 2007 they were enacted by Italian authorities, preventive arrests of several people involved, including the deceased João Figueiredo (former president) and Octávio Aguiar de Medeiros (former head of the SNI).

In July 2019, in a landmark ruling, the Italian courts sentenced former Peruvian dictator Morales Bermudez to life imprisonment, together with former Prime Minister Pedro Richter Prada and General Germán Ruíz Figueroa, for the disappearance of Italian citizens.

=== Argentina ===
In Argentina, the CONADEP human rights commission of 1983, led by writer Ernesto Sabato and René Favaloro among other respected personalities, investigated human rights abuses during the dictatorship. The 1985 Trial of the Juntas convicted top officers who ran the military governments for acts of state terrorism. The amnesty laws (Ley de Obediencia Debida and Ley de Punto Final) of 1985–1986 stopped the trials until 2003, when the Congress repealed them, and in 2005 the Argentine Supreme Court ruled they were unconstitutional.

Chilean Enrique Arancibia Clavel was convicted and sentenced in Argentina for the assassination of Carlos Prats and of his wife; in a 2011 court verdict, life terms were handed down to Alfredo Astiz, Jorge Acosta, Antonio Pernias, and Ricardo Cavallo. In 2016 Reynaldo Bignone, Santiago Riveros, Manuel Cordero and 14 others were convicted.

Most of the Junta&#x27;s members are in prison for genocide and crimes against humanity.

Former military officers from Argentina and Uruguay went on trial in 2013 in Buenos Aires for their human rights abuses in Operation Condor. The cross-border conspiracy of dictatorships in the 1970s and 1980s to &quot;eradicate &#x27;subversion,&#x27; a word which increasingly translated into non-violent dissent from the left and center left&quot;. These prosecutions were enabled by massive releases of formerly classified documents to the national Security Archive which were then used as evidence against the accused. &quot;The documents are very useful in establishing a comprehensive analytical framework of what Operation Condor was&quot;, said Pablo Enrique Ouvina, the lead prosecutor in the case. Of the 171 Condor victims cited in the indictments, approximately forty-two survived and one hundred twenty others were killed and/or disappeared. &quot;Condor was a latter day rendition, torture and assassination program&quot;, noted Carlos Osorio, who directs the Archive&#x27;s Southern Cone Documentation project. &quot;Holding these officials accountable for the multinational crimes of Condor&quot;, he said, &quot;cannot help but set a precedent for more recent abuses of a similar nature&quot;.

A Prominent victim of Operation Condor included former Bolivian president, Juan Torres, who was murdered in Buenos Aires.

=== Chile ===
Chilean judge Juan Guzmán, who had arraigned Pinochet at his return to Chile after his arrest in London, started prosecution of some 30 torturers, including former head of the DINA Manuel Contreras, for the disappearance of 20 Chilean victims of the Condor plan.

On 3 August 2007, General Raúl Iturriaga, former head of DINA, was captured in the Chilean city of Viña del Mar on the Pacific coast. He had previously been a fugitive from a five-year jail term, after being sentenced for the kidnapping of Luis Dagoberto San Martin, a 21-year-old opponent of Pinochet. Martín had been captured in 1974 and taken to a DINA detention center, from which he &quot;disappeared&quot;. Iturriaga was also wanted in Argentina for the assassination of General Prats.

According to French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Humanité:&quot;

in most of those countries legal action against the authors of crimes of &quot;lese-humanity&quot; from the 1970s to 1990 owes more to flaws in the amnesty laws than to a real will of the governments in power, which, on the contrary, wave the flag of &quot;national reconciliation&quot;. It is sad to say that two of the pillars of the Condor Operation, Alfredo Stroessner and Augusto Pinochet, never paid for their crimes and died without ever answering charges about the &quot;disappeared&quot; – who continue to haunt the memory of people who had been crushed by fascist brutality.Prominent victims of Operation Condor in Chile included former Chilean ambassador Orlando Letelier and his 26-year old American Colleague Ronni Moffitt who were assassinated by a car bomb in downtown Washington D.C.

=== Uruguay ===
Former Uruguayan president Juan María Bordaberry, his minister of Foreign Affairs and six military officers, responsible for the disappearance in Argentina in 1976 of opponents to the Uruguayan regime, were arrested in 2006 and placed under house arrest in 2007. In 2010, Bordaberry was convicted of violating the constitution, nine counts of &quot;forced disappearance&quot; and two counts of political homicide and sentenced to 30 years.

Prominent Uruguayan victims of Operation Condor included two former legislators.

== Legacy ==
The political scientist J. Patrice McSherry has argued that parts of Operation Condor fit the definition of state terrorism.

<doc id="261635" wikidata="Q618786" url="?curid=261635" title="Inline speed skating">
<text>Inline speed skating is the roller sport of racing on inline skates. The sport may also be called &quot;inline racing&quot; or &quot;speed skating&quot; by participants. Although it primarily evolved from racing on traditional roller skates, the sport is similar enough to ice speed skating that many competitors are known to switch between inline and ice speed skating according to the season.

==Skate==

An inline speed skate is a specialized shoe version of the inline skate. The boot or shoe is close-fitting, without much padding and usually made of leather, carbon fiber, and/or fiberglass composites. For best performance, the boot must conform closely to the shape of the foot, so most inline speed skating boots are custom-fitted or else heat-moldable.

Speed skating boots are low-cut and offer little ankle support, allowing the skater extra ankle movement. Skin blisters due to friction can be a problem, and common solutions include neoprene or silicone &quot;ankle bootee&quot; such as &quot;Ezeefit&quot; or &quot;Bunga Pads&quot;; double thin synthetic socks; smaller boots; improving technique; re-moulding the boots; sports tape; and use of &quot;advanced healing&quot; plasters to help recovery.

The frame (sometimes called the chassis or plate) that holds the wheels may be made of aircraft-quality aluminum, magnesium, or possibly carbon fiber. Frames flex during skating, and the amount of flex can be a personal factor in which frame choice to use. Very &quot;stiff&quot; frames may be favored by heavy skaters. A frame that is too stiff for a particular skater may feel unstable on corners, while a frame that is not stiff enough will be slower. Frame stiffness also works along with boot and wheel stiffness, so there are many possible variations. Nevertheless, a light frame is desirable. Ideal frame length is affected by foot size and wheel size. A slightly shorter frame may be preferred for the tight curves of smaller tracks; a longer frame may be preferred for longer distance events.

The frame position can usually be adjusted with respect to the skate to adjust for a skater&#x27;s individual foot, ankle and leg characteristics. Frame positioning is very critical as even a minor change from the skater&#x27;s actual frame position can lead to severe foot pain. Also, many times it leads to &#x27;locking&#x27; of the skater&#x27;s ankle and/or calf muscle, thereby restricting its movements. It may take a skater several days to weeks to test and adjust the frame position of his new skates. The common inline mounting is 195mm, which is different from the ice mounting of 165mm. The frame usually mounts three, four, or five polyurethane wheels. The three wheel frames are used by skaters with small feet, otherwise four-wheel frames are commonly used, with 90 mm to 110 mm diameter wheels. Five-wheel frames with smaller wheel have lost favor. Each wheel contains two ball bearings with an aluminum spacer, held in place with an axle screwed into the frame.

Larger wheels require better skating technique, so skaters generally progress upwards in wheel size as they gain experience. &quot;Hi-Lo&quot; arrangements are also available, which usually have three larger wheels and one smaller wheel under the ball of the foot, allowing a lower and shorter overall frame design.

In 2014 Powerslide (a German inline skate company) introduced a 125mm wheel for use on a three-wheeled frame varying in sizes from 11.8&quot; to 13.0&quot;. Much controversy surrounded this development since FIRS did not allow 125mm wheels at the 2014 and 2015 world championships. On January 18 of 2016 FIRS released a press release that stated: &quot;Dear Friends, Considering the evolution and growth that our sport has attained in the last years, the FIRS and the Speed Technical Committee have decided to allow, starting from February 1, 2016, the use of the wheels up to a maximum size of 125mm but only for the Marathons (JUNIOR and SENIOR) and the MASTER Category (MEN and LADIES). We will be grateful for the spread of this information and we take this opportunity to send you. Kind regards, Jorge Roldan, FIRS Speed Technical Committee, Chairman &amp; Robert Marotta FIRS Secretary General.&quot;

Harder wheels minimize elastic hysteresis energy absorption, due to skater&#x27;s weight deforming the solid polyurethane &quot;tyre&quot;. So, speed skaters tend to select the hardest possible wheels, with the highest polyurethane durometer for their skating condition, limited by either wheel slip or surface roughness. Durometer selection is also affected by skater weight, and temperature. Wheels for indoor use are hardest with a durometer of 88–97. They tend to last well, but can be easily damaged if used outdoors. Wheels for outdoor use are softer with a durometer of 82–87, and tend to wear more quickly. Harder outdoor wheels can also be used effectively indoors. Skaters sometimes combine different hardness wheels on the same skate in an attempt to achieve the best combination.

Skaters also consider wheel &quot;rebound&quot;. This refers to the relative height to which a dropped wheel rebounds. It is a reasonable comparative indicator of the relative energy absorbed by elastic hysteresis of a wheel during skating.

Bearing sizes have been standardized around the popular 608 series. A smaller and lighter 688 series has had limited acceptance. Bearing manufacturing precision generally run from ABEC-1 to ABEC-11, and some skate bearings are additionally designed to be &quot;loose&quot; to minimize ball rolling friction.

Various grades of steel offer better hardness, rust resistance etc. Bearings with ceramic balls (and races) have been available since the late 1990s. They are lighter and longer lasting, however significantly more expensive. Black silicon nitride ceramic is superior to white zirconium dioxide ceramic, since it is considerably harder and tougher. At the modest rotational speeds encountered in skates, manufacturer data suggests negligible difference in friction performance between the various bearing materials. At these speeds, ball bearing friction tends to be dominated by seals and lubricants.

Bearing shields reduce the entry of dirt into the bearing. Metal and rubber non-contact shields are commonly used, of which rubber shields are slightly more effective. Neither shield type is totally effective, often resulting in the need for bearing maintenance. The ball retainer is usually made of either metal, plastic, or glass. Plastic types are preferred since they are quieter.

Bearing lubrication is usually either light oil or grease. Synthetic types last longer before breaking down. Grease assists in holding dirt away, and stays in the bearing longer, reducing maintenance and increasing bearing life. The lifetime of bearings used for outdoor speed skating is often quite limited due to damage caused by dirt ingress. These bearings are usually cleaned by soaking them in petrol overnight and then cleaning the dirt.

In search of the maximum speed the principal goal is to minimize wind resistance, hence the use of skinsuits, special helmets and techniques. The second issue is elastic hysteresis energy absorption in the wheel. The distant third is bearing internal friction, a set of bearings in good condition, properly inserted and lubricated is normally enough.

==Technique and control==

Mechanically, strokes in speed skating are deeper and faster (to a sharper angle, closer to the point of losing traction) than recreational skating but not as deep or as fast as in ice speed skating. This is because of the greater frictional forces in the direction of travel and lesser ability to apply friction without slipping of wheels on a hard surface compared to a blade on ice.

Speedskaters move each foot across the center line of travel, leading to the double push, a method named by United States skater Chad Hedrick. The technique allows two pushes in each stroke of the skate. However, it can be tiring for inexperienced skaters who have improper technique, and they will often save it until needed, such as the latter stages or final sprint of a distance race. With proper execution, the double push is an energy saver. The double push is mostly used in outdoor racing and the straightaways of indoor skating.

During sprints, skaters need to initially push their body with force to get a jump start. For this they tend to take quick and sharp strides. Once they have achieved a good pace, they move to taking comparatively longer strides. Speedskaters usually bend from their knees to maintain a low posture. This has two advantages. First of all, it increases the reach of the skater&#x27;s legs, which results into even more powerful strides. Secondly, a low posture reduces the total surface area of the skater&#x27;s body that comes in contact with the resistive air, thus providing an aerodynamic advantage.

Turning is significantly more difficult with inline speed skates than recreational skates because of more and larger wheels, creating a longer wheelbase. The wheel profile, that is, the cross-section, is parabolic, with a sharper shape than recreational or aggressive wheels, allowing the skater to essentially skate on a smaller, and hence more agile, wheel when leaned over in a turn.

Brakes are not used on speed skates, so various other techniques to slow down are used, such as slaloming (skating s-curves) or v-plowing (or &quot;snow-plowing&quot;), where the heels are pushed outward and the toes inward. The v-plow is often the stop used in situations where there is little lateral and forward room to stop. One technique is the T-stop, essentially dragging one foot perpendicular to and behind the other, however this wears the wheels of that skate quickly. Another stop involves picking up one foot and setting it down quickly and repeatedly somewhat perpendicular to the forward motion while keeping weight on the other foot. Hockey stops are possible on speed skates, but require a very deep lean in order to cause the wheels to lose traction and slide, also the fact that wheels are sliding means that the wheels are also wearing down very quickly. Grass runouts are always a last option, given an adjacent grassy area.

When switching over to ice, speed skaters are generally faster. While there are some small differences in technique, speed skaters already have the muscle they need to skate on ice.

An inline speedskater takes much time to stop and often has few options in an emergency. It typically takes several hundred feet on a level surface to come to a stop at a full, controlled deceleration. Thus, a skater should be familiar with and proficient in stopping techniques before attempting difficult situations such as heavily travelled roads or hills.

== Training ==
Inline speed skating requires professional athletes to go through intense physical training. A strict diet and a rigorous training schedule has to be followed. The training schedule is mainly designed to build and maintain strong thighs and calves. But skating, just like swimming, requires the use of the whole body. Therefore, it is critical that the whole schedule is well balanced to attain and maintain a sturdy upper-body too. Also, a flexible upper body is preferred, which could help in maintaining the balance of the body in a better way. A heavy, protein-rich diet is required to be followed.

Usually, skaters have two sets of skates/wheels, one for training and the other for races and competitions. Wheels and bearings used for practice generally require much more efforts to gain some momentum and speed, as compared to the ones used in competitions. Ultra distance training requires years of training, time, and dedication to reach world class levels.

== Tactics ==
In outdoor inline racing events, team tactics may apply. If so, tactics are similar to those of marathon ice speed skating and of road bicycle racing, in which members of the team perform specified roles.

Skaters tend to form packs or &quot;pacelines&quot;, or &quot;pelotons&quot;, in which skaters line up behind a lead skater and match their stride, thereby saving energy by skating in their draft. Sportsmanship requires that skaters in the paceline share the duty as paceline leader. Those who never &quot;take a pull&quot; at the front are likely to find other skaters tactically working together to defeat them.

During the course of a race, skaters may make &quot;attacks&quot;, speeding up the pace in an effort to weed out the weaker and slower competition. These attacks may include &quot;breakaways&quot; and &quot;fliers&quot;, in which skaters try to create new smaller and faster packs or else to escape entirely from the other skaters. Depending on the length of the race and the skills and the cooperative effort of the chasers, these breakaways may or may not prove successful. If a skater escapes a pack in order to join a successful breakaway group, it is known as &quot;bridging up&quot;.

When skaters who are member of teams participate in a race together, they often have pre-determined roles. One or two would be designated attackers whose role it is to tire out the competition. Another skater may be the designated winner for the team, and he may avoid chasing any breakaways until late in a race, possibly until the final sprint if the lead pack has never broken up.

==Quad speed skating==
Quad roller-skating racing is the precursor to the popularity and acclaim received by competitive racing on in-line skates. Up until 1991, all World Championships were held on quad skates. Most events at the 1992 World Championships were specific to quads, however, some events were classed as &quot;open&quot; giving the athlete the option of choosing either quads or in-lines. The same criteria were applied for the 1993 World Championships. In 1994 all events were declared as &quot;open&quot;. Despite this, it had soon become evident that in-lines were predominantly quicker than quads on all surfaces and all tracks and to this end athletes opted for in-lines over quads, as is still the case today. 

==Race venues and formats==
Inline speed skating races are held in a variety of formats and on a variety of surfaces.

Indoor races are most common in the United States, which has a long tradition of racing on skates at rinks. The competitions are generally held at roller skating rinks with plastic-coated wood floors and, less commonly, a plastic coated cement floor. The track is about 100 m in circumference. At USA Roller Sports (USARS) events, tracks are marked by four pylons set in a parabolic oval, while at NIRA (National Inline Racing Association) events, tracks are marked by multiple pylons that create an oval shaped track. Events, or &quot;meets&quot;, are typically structured so that members of numerous age groups race in three or four distances. For the more populous divisions, there may be a series of heats in order to qualify for the final race. To some extent, indoor inline races are similar to short track speed skating.

Outdoor races may be held on regular pavement on city streets or park roads, or they may be held at specialized venues similar to velodromes, sometimes called patinodromes. A patinodrome is generally about 200 m in circumference and may be surfaced with asphalt, concrete or similar material. The curves may be banked. Such specialized skating tracks are relatively common in Europe but rare in the United States. The international governing body for World Roller Sports, World Skate, and its technical committee, Committee International de Course (CIC), are making strides to commonise tracks used specifically for World Championships that have the same size, shape and surface. Plans for such tracks are available from FIRS upon request.

Race formats include:

;Time trials: Held &quot;against the clock&quot;, each skater races individually or in pairs over a distance of 100 m to 300 m, attempting to establish the best time. Time trials are occasionally held over longer distances, up to 100k which is 62 miles for fastest time. Another format measures how many miles one can achieve alone in 24 hours or 48 hours. All time trials are very physically demanding and not as popular as group racing. The time trial is the hardest of races, called &quot;The Truth&quot; because it&#x27;s the true test of the individual with no help from drafting, teammates, or other competitors to achieve the fastest times. Bicycling has time trials in the Olympics and the Tour de France, for example. Sometimes time trial races can use individual pursuit format.
;Sprint races: Four to eight competitors races on short distance (100m to 1000m) in a knock-out tournament.
;Elimination races: In these moderate-distance races, also known as &quot;last man out&quot;, the hindmost skater is eliminated from the competition each time the pack of skaters complete a lap or when they complete certain specified lap numbers. At one or two laps to before the finish, the group has usually been pared down to four or five skaters. At this point, the first across the finish line is the winner.

;Points races: In these moderate-distance races, the first, second and third skaters to cross the start/finish line at certain specified laps are awarded points. Laps late in the race are worth more points, with the final lap worth the most points of all. It is possible to win a points race without actually being the first to cross the finish line at the end.

;Points-elimination races: A combination of elimination races and points races.

;Relays: Relay events include teams of two to four skaters each. Indoor meets may include &quot;mixed&quot; relay events in which teams have either one female and one male OR two females and two males, but outdoor relays (usually held on tracks) are usually if not always single-sex events. In a mix relay, it is traditional that a female goes to the starting line as the first skater to race.

;Criterium races: Instead of racing a specified distance or number laps, the skaters skate for a certain amount of time, then plus a (small) number of laps. The time is typically between 15 and 45 minutes, after which a bell is rung and the skaters informed the race is over when they skate one or two more laps around the course. The portion of the race skated after the bell is rung is known as the &quot;bell lap&quot; (or laps).

;Distance races: Although events such as points-elimination races and criteriums may cover a distance of 10 to 25 km, a distance race usually refers to a race over a set distance of about 5 km or longer and without specialized points or elimination rules. The event may be truly point-to-point or may be held on a repeating course with a circumference of at least 1 km. Distance races are often marketed to the general populace and not just to members of inline racing clubs.

;Marathons: Lately there is a new movement of skaters bringing big masses to events, these events are the skate marathons, . The most popular marathons in the USA are: The North Shore Marathon and Saint Paul Inline Marathon, however they are now taking place all over the world including the Goodwood Roller Marathon in the UK. These races gain more popularity everyday as skaters form friendships and bonds at these events.

;Ultra Marathons: Ultra Marathons draw relatively large numbers. Given the time needed to complete such events, one could say that they are the equivalent to a running marathon. These events were very popular in the late 1990s but declined after the year 2001; there is a new movement of people keeping this events alive and bringing them back to the forefront of the speed skating world.

:There are two very old and popular ultra marathons in the USA:
:#The New York City Skate Marathon and New York 100K The New York City Skate Marathon &amp; NY 100K has been held since the early 1990s, with Brooklyn&#x27;s Prospect Park hosting the event since the late 1990s. Various distances are competed at the event, but the event always includes a race of approximately 42 kilometers and another of 100 kilometers.
:#Athens to Atlanta Road Skate (The A2A) This is the longest running point to point event in the USA, with a maximum distance of covering the distance from Athens, Georgia to Atlanta, Georgia.

:In the early days of inline racing, sponsors of distance races were often also running event organizers, and the races they organized were commonly the same distances as those of running races, about 5–10 km. By the mid-1990s such events were proving to not be very popular and in the United States, where sales of inline skates were also beginning to slip, there was a decline in participation at races. However, at about that time in Europe, where inline skate sales were beginning to rise, race sponsors began to regularly organize longer events, particularly inline marathons. Such events proved to be enormously popular among fitness skaters, with some events such as the Berlin Inline Marathon (with more than 11.000 at its peak) and the Engadin Inline Marathon in St. Moritz, Switzerland, regularly attracting over 5000 skaters each year.

:In about 2000 American event sponsors followed suit, and inline half-marathons and marathons were scheduled more and more frequently around the country. As in Europe the events proved a big draw with fitness skaters looking for events which would give their training a focus. However, by 2005 this surge was tempered as some major events were either postponed for a year or cancelled permanently. In the United States the most popular inline marathon has continued to be the NorthShore Inline Marathon in Duluth, Minnesota.

:In 1999, a team of six British men led by Paul Robinson skated from Land&#x27;s End to John O&#x27;Groats, a distance of . This is the only known long-distance skating event held in the world to date.

;Dryland triathlons: Occasionally organized by triathlon sponsors, these events substitute inline skating for the swimming component of the race. These events were infrequent even during the mid-1990s boom in inline skating participation. Today they are rare to non-existent.

;Downhill races: An event most popular in the Alpine countries of Europe, these races are timed events down a steep course. The use of concrete bobsleigh courses in summertime is not uncommon. Racers usually skate alone and the event commonly uses the best time of two heats to establish the winner. Downhill inline racers usually wear skates much more like &quot;regular&quot; inline skates than inline speed skates, along with extensive body covering and protective gear, and strong helmets. They may reach speeds of up to 130 km/h. The International Inline Downhill Association (IIDA) is the largest organization for inline downhill racing, holding races on several continents.

==World Championships==
==Olympic status==
Attempts by the world governing body for roller sports, the International Roller Sports Federation (FIRS), to gain Olympic status for any of its disciplines were distinctly insufficient in the closing decades of the 20th century. Most notably, it failed to capitalize when rink hockey (a form of roller hockey) appeared as a demonstration sport at the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona.

Efforts by FIRS to obtain Olympic status became more coherent in about 2000, with inline speed skating promoted as the roller sport best suited for the Olympics. However, the federation faces competition from approximately 20 other sports also seeking entry into the Olympics, while at the same time the president of the International Olympic Committee has expressed a desire to reduce the size of the summer Olympic Games. Roller sports was a candidate sport for the 2016 Summer Olympics, following the drop of baseball and softball, but the Olympic Committee eventually chose rugby sevens and golf instead.

Notably, roller speed or in-line speed skating has been an included sport at the World Games since their inception in 1981.

<doc id="261636" wikidata="Q977872" url="?curid=261636" title="DICT">
<text>DICT is a dictionary network protocol created by the DICT Development Group in 1997, described by RFC 2229. Its goal is to surpass the Webster protocol to allow clients to access a variety of dictionaries via a uniform interface.

In section 3.2 of the DICT protocol RFC, queries and definitions are sent in clear-text, meaning that there is no encryption. Nevertheless, according to section 3.1 of the RFC, various forms of authentication (sans encryption) are supported, including Kerberos version 4.

The protocol consists of a few commands a server must recognize so a client can access the available data and lookup word definitions. DICT servers and clients use TCP port 2628 by default. Queries are captured in the following URL scheme:dict://&lt;user&gt;;&lt;auth&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/&lt;c&gt;:&lt;word&gt;:&lt;database&gt;:&lt;strategy&gt;:&lt;n&gt;

==Resources for free dictionaries from DICT protocol servers==
A repository of source files for the DICT Development group&#x27;s dict protocol server (with a few sample dictionaries) is available online.

* dictd (the standard server made by the DICT Development Group)
* DictD++ – modern powerful server written in C++ with heavy usage of STL and boost (abandoned)
* GNU Dico
* JDictd – a Java-based DICT server implementation (abandoned)

== DICT clients ==
A dictd server can be used from Telnet. For example, to connect to the DICT server on localhost, on a Unix system one can normally type:

 telnet localhost dict

and then enter the command &quot;help&quot; to see the available commands. The standard dictd package also provides a &quot;dict&quot; command for command-line use.

More sophisticated DICT clients include:
* cURL
* dictc (DICT Client) client for Windows written in Delphi.
* dict.org&#x27;s own client (part of the dictd package)
* dictem, for the Emacs text editor
* Dictionary, an application included with Mac OS X. Online dictionaries can be accessed by setting it as the helper for &#x27;dict://&#x27; URI schemes.
* Fantasdic
* GNOME Dictionary, comes with GNOME
* GNU dico&#x27;s own client (part of the dico package)
* Kdict, comes with KDE
* KTranslator, KDE dictionary
* MaemoDict, for the Nokia 770
* MATE Dictionary (with accompanying applet)
* Mozdev.org&#x27;s &#x27;dict&#x27;, a Firefox/Mozilla extension
* OKDict, an OpenOffice.org extension
* OmniDictionary, for Mac OS X
* StarDict
* ZopeDictDB for Zope from Pentila
* GoldenDict
* xfce4-dict, from the Xfce project

There are also programs that read the DICT file format directly. For example, S60Dict, is a dictionary program for Symbian Series 60 that uses DICT dictionaries. Additionally, some DICT clients, such as Fantasdic, are also capable of reading the DICT format directly.

==Dict file format==

The standard dictd server made by the DICT Development Group uses a special &quot;dict&quot; file format. It comprises two files, a &quot;.index&quot; file and a &quot;.dict&quot; file (or &quot;.dict.dz&quot; if compressed). These files are usually generated by a program called &quot;dictfmt&quot;. For example, the Unix command:

dictfmt --utf8 --allchars -s &quot;My Dictionary&quot; -j mydict &lt; mydict.txt

will compile a Unicode-compatible DICT file called &quot;mydict&quot;, with heading &quot;My Dictionary&quot;, from &quot;mydict.txt&quot; which is in Jargon File format i.e.:

 :word1:definition 1
 :word2:definition 2
 etc.

Once the dictionary file has been produced, it can be easily installed on a server with commands similar to this:

 mv mydict.dict mydict.index /usr/share/dictd/
 /usr/sbin/dictdconfig—write
 /etc/init.d/dictd restart

=== Format converters ===
* Linguae Software is able to convert from/to wb, dict (stardict and dictd) csv, xdxf, txt, ini and ling (native) file formats, Linux, Windows and Mac OS X.
* XDXF XML Dictionary Exchange Format converts between various dictionary formats using pluggable codec architecture.

=== dictzip ===
In order to efficiently store dictionary data, &quot;dictzip&quot;, an extension to the gzip compression format (also the name of the utility), can be used to compress a .dict file.
Dictzip compresses file in chunks and stores the chunk index in the gzip file header, thus allowing random access to the data.

<text>Mary Rose-Anne Bolduc, born Travers, (June 4, 1894 – February 20, 1941) was a musician and singer of French Canadian music. She was known as Madame Bolduc or La Bolduc. During the peak of her popularity in the 1930s, she was known as the &quot;Queen of Canadian Folk Singers&quot;. Bolduc is often considered to be Quebec&#x27;s first singer-songwriter. Her style combined the traditional folk music of Ireland and Quebec, usually in upbeat, comedic songs.

== Biography ==

=== Childhood ===
Mary Rose-Anne Travers &quot;La Bolduc&quot; was born in Newport, Quebec, in the Gaspé region. Her father, Lawrence Travers, was an Anglophone of Irish heritage, and her mother, Adéline Cyr, was of mixed French Canadian and Mi&#x27;kmaq heritage. Her family included five full siblings, and an additional six half-siblings from her father&#x27;s first marriage. Bolduc and her eleven siblings spoke English at home, but also spoke French fluently. The family was extremely poor, but Bolduc attended school for a time, becoming literate in French.

Her only music teacher was her father, who taught her how to play the instruments that were traditional in Quebec culture of the era: the fiddle, accordion, harmonica, spoons and jaw harp. She learned traditional music from the two heritages, both Irish melodies and French-Canadian folk tunes. The family did not own a record player, piano or sheet music, so Bolduc learned jigs and folk songs from memory or by ear. She was giving casual public performances by the spring of 1908, when she played the accordion at the logging camp where she worked as a cook and her father as a lumberjack.

=== Early working life ===
In 1908, at the age of thirteen, Bolduc was sent to live with her half-sister Mary-Ann in Montreal, Quebec. Mary-Ann worked as a maid and had secured Bolduc a job as a maid in the house of Dr Lesage. She was paid $15 per month, in addition to room and board. A few years later she took a job at a textile mill, which paid $15 weekly for 60 hours of work per week.

On August 17, 1914, she married Édouard Bolduc, a plumber. The couple&#x27;s first child was stillborn. Denise Bolduc was born in July 1916, Jeannette Bolduc in July 1917 and Roger Bolduc in August 1918. Roger died at the age of ten months and Jeanette at two years. The couple experienced more bad fortune with pregnancies and children; of the twelve or thirteen pregnancies, only four children reached adulthood. The family was quite poor, and in 1921 when Édouard had difficulty finding work they decided to move to Springfield, Massachusetts. Édouard Bolduc&#x27;s sister was living there at the time. They returned to Montreal a year later, as Édouard had been unable to secure work in Springfield. During this time Mary Bolduc entertained both friends and family with her musical talents. Among her friends were amateur musicians who sometimes performed with the &quot;Veillées du bon vieux temps&quot; at the Monument-National under Conrad Gauthier.

=== Musical career ===
When Conrad Gauthier&#x27;s troupe was missing a folk violinist for a performance, one of Bolduc&#x27;s friends arranged for her to fill in for the absent performer. Gauthier was suitably impressed by her performance and asked her to return for subsequent productions. The family was always in need of money and the small income she earned this way was useful. Bolduc became a regular player with Gauthier&#x27;s troupe by 1928, playing the violin or the jaw harp. Her work with them expanded to include other instrumental work and even some comic acting.

Bolduc was recommended by folk singer Ovila Légaré to musical producer Roméo Beaudry of the Compo Company. Beaudry signed musicians for French language recordings on the Starr Records label. Beaudry signed her to a recording contract to make four 78 rpm records, paying her $25 per side. She made her first recording in April 1929, the French folk song &quot;Y&#x27;a longtemps que je couche par terre&quot; on side A, and an instrumental reel on side B. The record was a commercial flop. Her next two recordings also had meagre sales.

Bolduc&#x27;s second recording was released for Christmas of 1929. The first side had an original song of Bolduc&#x27;s, &quot;La Cuisinière&quot;. Side B was an adaptation of an English folk song titled &quot;Johnny Monfarleau&quot;. The record sold more than twelve thousand copies, which was unprecedented in Quebec. Bolduc earned a total of $450 from the sales and became a in Quebec. With this success, Beaudry had Bolduc releasing a double-sided record every month. Bolduc recorded an additional four songs in January 1930. Nine more songs were recorded in April that year. By the end of 1930, she had recorded more than 30 songs. During this time, she collaborated on no less than fifty-six recordings of other artists. Most of these recordings did not credit her. Bolduc sang accompaniments or played instruments for recordings by Juliette Béliveau, Eugène Daignault, Ovila Légaré, Alfred Montmarquette, Adélard St. Jean, and possibly others.

Bolduc&#x27;s first headlining performance came in November 1930, in Lachute at a costume ball. The audience was extremely receptive to her music and she was inspired to start a show that focused on her own songs. In March 1931 she took an offer from a burlesque company at the Théâtre Arlequin de Québec to perform as their main act. From this, she embarked on a three-month tour of Quebec with Juliette d&#x27;Argère. Starting in Hull in May 1931, they travelled western Quebec and Montreal, finishing in Sept-Îles in July. In 1931, her rising popularity increased the cost of her sheet music from four for one dollar to three for one dollar.

Bolduc formed her own touring troupe in 1932, named &quot;La Troupe du bon vieux temps&quot;. She hired Jean Grimaldi to direct the tours. The performances contained elements of both vaudeville and traditional folk music. Their first tours were around the Montreal area, and from August through December 1932 they gave fifty shows. The tours were a great success in Quebec with Bolduc earning $2000 from her first tour, compared to $500 – $1000 annually she got from royalties. The troupe went on a tour of New England from April through June 1934, and a second tour of New England that autumn. They toured across Quebec, and in 1935 toured the French speaking areas of northern Ontario. They went on additional tours of New England in 1937 and 1939.

As the 1930s progressed, Bolduc&#x27;s record sales began to slump, but her income from touring remained good. Bolduc stuck to her folk music style as the record buying public turned increasingly to jazz and popular music. She produced eighteen records in 1930 and 10 in 1931, but with her declining sales she recorded nothing from July 1932 until she released a single album in March 1935, and then four more in 1936. In 1936, the family was able to afford a nanny to attend to the children while Bolduc toured.

Beginning in 1935, her daughter Denise appeared with her as a pianist. Other children occasionally appeared as backup singers, and her daughter Lucienne recorded &quot;L&#x27;Enfant volé&quot;.

Bolduc was seriously injured in June 1937 in Rivière-du-Loup when her tour company&#x27;s car was in a head-on collision. She suffered a broken leg, a broken nose and a concussion. She was sent to a hospital in Rimouski for treatment, where doctors discovered a cancerous tumour. She began radiation treatment at the Radium Institute in Montreal, and engaged in practically no musical endeavours at this point, making no stage appearances for a full year. Her insurance company refused to pay for her damages, notably the concussion that caused memory loss and loss of concentration, which prevented her from writing songs. The suit ended badly as Bolduc did not use banks and had no record of her income to prove loss of income. Of her total damages and lost income, Bolduc recovered only $1500.

Bolduc began limited touring again in the summer of 1938, only in the Montreal area. She made a radio broadcast in January 1939, and made two recordings in February 1939. One of those songs, &quot;Les Souffrances de mon accident&quot; (French &quot;The sufferings of my accident&quot;) was on her accident. She died of cancer on February 20, 1941, in Montreal and was buried in the Cimetière Notre-Dame-des-Neiges.

== Musical style ==
Bolduc never had any formal music lessons, and developed her own style under the influence of her father&#x27;s teaching and the musical traditions of Irish folk music and Québécois folk tunes. Her songs tended to be happy and comical with lively rhythms. Her self-written songs often used existing melodies from folk tunes or dances, combined with lyrics she wrote herself. For instance, she wrote the song &quot;Les Cinq Jumelles&quot; about the Dionne Quintuplets, which was set to the tune of &quot;Little Brown Jug&quot;. In other cases, she adapted popular contemporary American songs.

Bolduc often used the technique of the &quot;enumerative song&quot;, which lists something such as foods or tasks. This technique was traditional in French-Canadian folk songs, derived from similar French traditions. Bolduc also employed the traditional French folk song style of the &quot;dialogue song&quot;, usually a duet with a man, where the song is a conversation or debate between the man and the woman. One such song was &quot;Mademoiselle, dites-moi donc&quot;, which she recorded with Ovila Légaré and featured the two of them bantering and flirting comedically. She often wrote in the style derived from traditional English broadside ballads, which tell current news to the tunes of traditional songs. One such song by Bolduc is &quot;La chanson du bavard&quot;, which notably employs an introduction inviting the listener to hear a tale, as is common in broadside ballads. Other topical ballads by Bolduc include &quot;Les Américains&quot; about Americans coming to Montreal during Prohibition to obtain liquor and the unrecorded &quot;Si je pouvais tenir Hitler,&quot; which she wrote a few days after the outbreak of World War II.

Her music relied heavily upon the harmonica and the fiddle, the traditional instruments of reels in Quebec. Her singing also adopted a nasal style, and her pitch was relaxed, both of which are found traditionally. Her singing often featured turlutage, which derives from Irish and Scottish musical traditions. Most often she employed this technique in reels, such as her song &quot;Reel turluté&quot;.

Her touring troupe &quot;La Troupe du bon vieux temps&quot; gave fairly consistent performances. Mary Bolduc opened the show with her newest songs. The troupe then performed comedy sketches, ensemble songs, folk songs and vaudeville routines. Most performances included a segment where amateurs performed, sometimes for cash prizes. Bolduc closed with some of her newest or most topical songs.

Bolduc&#x27;s lyrics are predominantly French, but frequently include a few words or lines in English. This was reflective of her country upbringing in Gaspésie, where the two languages mingle. The recordings were marketed to working class francophone audiences, in small towns and rural areas where people had traditional values.

== Professional image ==
Singing and stage careers were not well regarded in Quebec society of the 1920s and 1930s, especially for women. To avoid gossip and to keep a good reputation, Bolduc was always credited under her married name &quot;Madame Édouard Bolduc&quot;, both at live performances and on recordings. She attempted to include her family in her activities as much as possible. Her husband Édouard accompanied her troupe on their 1932 and 1934 tours. Her eldest daughter Denise joined the troupe in 1935 as a pianist.

== Legacy ==
Some debate exists among historians as to whether Mary Bolduc or Félix Leclerc should be identified as Quebec&#x27;s first singer-songwriter. Either way, both had significant influence on the development of Quebec&#x27;s folk music culture from the 1930s onwards. Bolduc was the most widely known folk music singer of Quebec in the 1930s. Her humorous images of daily life, her realism in depicting the society of the time, and her satirical characters all appear in the work of subsequent singer-songwriters. Although it was received poorly by critics of the day, Bolduc&#x27;s use of colloquialisms and working-class vocabulary influenced future musicians like Gilles Vigneault and Clémence DesRochers. Other Québécois musicians with notable influences from Bolduc include Oscar Thiffault, whose style was descended from Bolduc, André Gagnon, whose composition &quot;Les Turluteries&quot; is based on Bolduc&#x27;s use of turlutage, and Robert Charlebois, who also sang in the dual French Canadian and English derived style and used the everyday slang of Quebec.

On August 12, 1994, a stamp was released that honoured her with her portrait on a Canadian postage stamp. The stamp was designed by Pierre Fontaine based on images from Bernard Leduc. Seven and a half million copies were printed. The same year, a park was created in her hometown of Newport named &quot;Mary Travers Park&quot;.

In 2002, Mary Bolduc was made a MasterWorks honoree by the Audio-Visual Preservation Trust of Canada.

&quot;La Bolduc&quot;, a biographical film about Bolduc by director François Bouvier, was released in Quebec in April 2018. The film stars Debbie Lynch-White as Bolduc.

<doc id="261642" wikidata="Q664150" url="?curid=261642" title="Skin effect">
<text>In electromagnetism, skin effect is the tendency of an alternating electric current (AC) to become distributed within a conductor such that the current density is largest near the surface of the conductor and decreases exponentially with greater depths in the conductor. It is caused by opposing eddy currents induced by the changing magnetic field resulting from the alternating current. The electric current flows mainly at the &quot;skin&quot; of the conductor, between the outer surface and a level called the skin depth.

Skin depth depends on the frequency of the alternating current; as frequency increases, current flow becomes more concentrated near the surface, resulting in less skin depth. Skin effect reduces the effective cross-section of the conductor and thus increases its effective resistance. At 60 Hz in copper, skin depth is about 8.5 mm. At high frequencies, skin depth becomes much smaller.

Increased AC resistance caused by skin effect can be mitigated by using a specialized multistrand wire called litz wire. Because the interior of a large conductor carries little of the current, tubular conductors can be used to save weight and cost.

Skin effect has practical consequences in the analysis and design of radio-frequency and microwave circuits, transmission lines (or waveguides), and antennas. It is also important at mains frequencies (50–60 Hz) in AC electric power transmission and distribution systems. It is one of the reasons for preferring high-voltage direct current for long-distance power transmission.

The effect was first described in a paper by Horace Lamb in 1883 for the case of spherical conductors, and was generalized to conductors of any shape by Oliver Heaviside in 1885.

== Cause ==
Conductors, typically in the form of wires, may be used to transfer electrical energy or signals using an alternating current flowing through that conductor. The charge carriers constituting that current, usually electrons, are driven by an electric field due to the source of electrical energy. A current in a conductor produces a magnetic field in and around the conductor. When the intensity of current in a conductor changes, the magnetic field also changes. The change in the magnetic field, in turn, creates an electric field that opposes the change in current intensity. This opposing electric field is called counter-electromotive force (back EMF). The back EMF is strongest / most concentrated at the center of the conductor, allowing current only near the outside skin of the conductor, as shown in the diagram on the right.

Regardless of the driving force, the current density is found to be greatest at the conductor&#x27;s surface, with a reduced magnitude deeper in the conductor. That decline in current density is known as the &quot;skin effect&quot; and the &quot;skin depth&quot; is a measure of the depth at which the current density falls to 1/e of its value near the surface.
Over 98% of the current will flow within a layer 4 times the skin depth from the surface. This behavior is distinct from that of direct current which usually will be distributed evenly over the cross-section of the wire.

An alternating current may also be &quot;induced&quot; in a conductor due to an alternating magnetic field according to the law of induction. An electromagnetic wave impinging on a conductor will therefore generally produce such a current; this explains the attenuation of electromagnetic waves in metals. Although the term &quot;skin effect&quot; is most often associated with applications involving transmission of electric currents, skin depth also describes the exponential decay of the electric and magnetic fields, as well as the density of induced currents, inside a bulk material when a plane wave impinges on it at normal incidence.

== Formula ==
The AC current density in a conductor decreases exponentially from its value at the surface 
according to the depth from the surface, as follows:
formula_1
where formula_2 is called the &quot;skin depth&quot; which is defined as the depth below the surface of the conductor at which the current density has fallen to 1/e (about 0.37) of S. The imaginary part of the exponent indicates that the phase of the current density is delayed 1 radian for each skin depth of penetration. One full wavelength in the conductor requires 2 skin depths, at which point the current density is attenuated to e−2 (1.87×, or −54.6 dB) of its surface value. The wavelength in the conductor is much shorter than the wavelength in vacuum, or equivalently, the phase velocity in a conductor is very much slower than the speed of light in vacuum. For example, a 1 MHz radio wave has a wavelength in vacuum of about 300 m, whereas in copper, the wavelength is reduced to only about 0.5 mm with a phase velocity of only about 500 m/s. As a consequence of Snell&#x27;s law and this very tiny phase velocity in a conductor, any wave entering a conductor, even at grazing incidence, refracts essentially in the direction perpendicular to the conductor&#x27;s surface.

The general formula for skin depth when there is no dielectric or magnetic loss is:
formula_3

where
At frequencies much below formula_4 the quantity inside the large parentheses is close to unity and the formula is more usually given as:
formula_5

This formula is valid at frequencies away from strong atomic or molecular resonances (where formula_6 would have a large imaginary part) and at frequencies that are much below both the material&#x27;s plasma frequency (dependent on the density of free electrons in the material) and the reciprocal of the mean time between collisions involving the conduction electrons. In good conductors such as metals all of those conditions are ensured at least up to microwave frequencies, justifying this formula&#x27;s validity. For example, in the case of copper, this would be true for frequencies much below .

However, in very poor conductors, at sufficiently high frequencies, the quantity inside the large parentheses increases. At frequencies much higher than formula_4, skin depth approaches the asymptotic value:
formula_8

This departure from the usual formula only applies for materials of rather low conductivity and at frequencies where the vacuum wavelength is not much larger than the skin depth itself. For instance, bulk silicon (undoped) is a poor conductor and has a skin depth of about 40 meters at 100 kHz ( = 3 km). However, as the frequency is increased well into the megahertz range, its skin depth never falls below the asymptotic value of 11 meters. The conclusion is that in poor solid conductors, such as undoped silicon, skin effect does not need to be taken into account in most practical situations.

==Round wire==

When skin depth is not small with respect to the radius of the wire, current density may be described in terms of Bessel functions. The current density inside round wire away from the influences of other fields, as function of distance from the axis is given by:

formula_9

where

Since formula_10 is complex, the Bessel functions are also complex. The amplitude and phase of the current density varies with depth.

===Derivation===
Combining the electromagnetic wave equation and Ohm&#x27;s law produces
formula_11
The solution to this equation is, for finite current in the center of the conductor,
formula_12
where formula_13 is a Bessel function of the first kind of order formula_14 and formula_15 is a constant phasor. To satisfy the boundary condition for the current density at the surface of the conductor, formula_16 formula_15 must be formula_18 Thus,
formula_19

===Impedance===

==== Resistance ====
The most important effect of skin effect on the impedance of a single wire is the increase of the wire&#x27;s resistance, and consequent losses. The effective resistance due to a current confined near the surface of a large conductor (much thicker than ) can be solved as if the current flowed uniformly through a layer of thickness based on the DC resistivity of that material. The effective cross-sectional area is approximately equal to times the conductor&#x27;s circumference.
Thus a long cylindrical conductor such as a wire, having a diameter large compared to , has a resistance &quot;approximately&quot; that of a hollow tube with wall thickness carrying direct current. The AC resistance of a wire of length and resistivity formula_20 is:
formula_21

The final approximation above assumes formula_22.

A convenient formula (attributed to F.E. Terman) for the diameter of a wire of circular cross-section whose resistance will increase by 10% at frequency is:
formula_23

This formula for the increase in AC resistance is accurate only for an isolated wire. For nearby wires, e.g. in a cable or a coil, the AC resistance is also affected by proximity effect, which can cause an additional increase in the AC resistance.
The &quot;internal&quot; impedance per unit length of a segment of round wire is given by:
formula_24

This impedance is a complex quantity corresponding to a resistance (real) in series with the reactance (imaginary) due to the wire&#x27;s internal self-inductance, per unit length.

==== Inductance ====

A portion of a wire&#x27;s inductance can be attributed to the magnetic field &quot;inside&quot; the wire itself which is termed the &quot;internal inductance&quot;; this accounts for the inductive reactance (imaginary part of the impedance) given by the above formula. In most cases this is a small portion of a wire&#x27;s inductance which includes the effect of induction from magnetic fields &quot;outside&quot; of the wire produced by the current in the wire. Unlike that &quot;external&quot; inductance, the internal inductance is reduced by skin effect, that is, at frequencies where skin depth is no longer large compared to the conductor&#x27;s size. This small component of inductance approaches a value of formula_25 (50 nH/m for non-magnetic wire) at low frequencies, regardless of the wire&#x27;s radius. Its reduction with increasing frequency, as the ratio of skin depth to the wire&#x27;s radius falls below about 1, is plotted in the accompanying graph, and accounts for the reduction in the telephone cable inductance with increasing frequency in the table below.

Refer to the diagram below showing the inner and outer conductors of a coaxial cable. Since skin effect causes a current at high frequencies to flow mainly at the surface of a conductor, it can be seen that this will reduce the magnetic field &quot;inside&quot; the wire, that is, beneath the depth at which the bulk of the current flows. It can be shown that this will have a minor effect on the self-inductance of the wire itself; see Skilling or Hayt for a mathematical treatment of this phenomenon.

The inductance considered in this context refers to a bare conductor, not the inductance of a coil used as a circuit element. The inductance of a coil is dominated by the mutual inductance between the turns of the coil which increases its inductance according to the square of the number of turns. However, when only a single wire is involved, then in addition to the &quot;external inductance&quot; involving magnetic fields outside the wire (due to the total current in the wire) as seen in the white region of the figure below, there is also a much smaller component of &quot;internal inductance&quot; due to the portion of the magnetic field inside the wire itself, the green region in figure B. That small component of the inductance is reduced when the current is concentrated toward the skin of the conductor, that is, when skin depth is not much larger than the wire&#x27;s radius, as will become the case at higher frequencies.

For a single wire, this reduction becomes of diminishing significance as the wire becomes longer in comparison to its diameter, and is usually neglected. However, the presence of a second conductor in the case of a transmission line reduces the extent of the external magnetic field (and of the total self-inductance) regardless of the wire&#x27;s length, so that the inductance decrease due to skin effect can still be important. For instance, in the case of a telephone twisted pair, below, the inductance of the conductors substantially decreases at higher frequencies where skin effect becomes important. On the other hand, when the external component of the inductance is magnified due to the geometry of a coil (due to the mutual inductance between the turns), the significance of the internal inductance component is even further dwarfed and is ignored.

===== Coaxial cable =====
Let the dimensions , , and be the inner conductor radius, the shield (outer conductor) inside radius and the shield outer radius respectively, as seen in the crossection of figure  below.

For a given current, the total energy stored in the magnetic fields must be the same as the calculated electrical energy attributed to that current flowing through the inductance of the coax; that energy is proportional to the cable&#x27;s measured inductance.

The magnetic field inside a coaxial cable can be divided into three regions, each of which will therefore contribute to the electrical inductance seen by a length of cable.

*The inductance formula_26 is associated with the magnetic field in the region with radius formula_27, the region inside the center conductor.
*The inductance formula_28 is associated with the magnetic field in the region formula_29, the region between the two conductors (containing a dielectric, possibly air).
*The inductance formula_30 is associated with the magnetic field in the region formula_31, the region inside the shield conductor.

The net electrical inductance is due to all three contributions:
formula_32

formula_28 is not changed by the skin effect and is given by the frequently cited formula for inductance &quot;L&quot; per length &quot;D&quot; of a coaxial cable:
formula_34

At low frequencies, all three inductances are fully present so that formula_35.

At high frequencies, only the dielectric region has magnetic flux, so that formula_36.

Most discussions of coaxial transmission lines assume they will be used for radio frequencies, so equations are supplied corresponding only to the latter case.

As skin effect increases, the currents are concentrated near the outside the inner conductor (&quot;r&quot; = &quot;a&quot;) and the inside of the shield (&quot;r&quot; = &quot;b&quot;). Since there is essentially no current deeper in the inner conductor, there is no magnetic field beneath the surface of the inner conductor. Since the current in the inner conductor is balanced by the opposite current flowing on the inside of the outer conductor, there is no remaining magnetic field in the outer conductor itself where formula_31. Only formula_38 contributes to the electrical inductance at these higher frequencies.

Although the geometry is different, a twisted pair used in telephone lines is similarly affected: at higher frequencies, the inductance decreases by more than 20% as can be seen in the following table.

===== Telephone cable =====

More extensive tables and tables for other gauges, temperatures and types are available in Reeve.

Chen gives an equation of this form for telephone twisted pair:
formula_39

== Material effect on skin depth ==

In a good conductor, skin depth is proportional to square root of the resistivity. This means that better conductors have a reduced skin depth. The overall resistance of the better conductor remains lower even with the reduced skin depth. However the better conductor will show a higher ratio between its AC and DC resistance, when compared with a conductor of higher resistivity. For example, at 60 Hz, a 2000 MCM (1000 square millimeter) copper conductor has 23% more resistance than it does at DC. The same size conductor in aluminum has only 10% more resistance with 60 Hz AC than it does with DC.

Skin depth also varies as the inverse square root of the permeability of the conductor. In the case of iron, its conductivity is about 1/7 that of copper. However being ferromagnetic its permeability is about 10,000 times greater. This reduces the skin depth for iron to about 1/38 that of copper, about 220 micrometers at 60 Hz. Iron wire is impractical for AC power lines (except to add mechanical strength by serving as a core to a non-ferromagnetic conductor like aluminum). Skin effect also reduces the effective thickness of laminations in power transformers, increasing their losses.

Iron rods work well for direct-current (DC) welding but it is difficult to use them at frequencies much higher than 60 Hz. At a few kilohertz, an iron welding rod would glow red hot as current flows through the greatly increased AC resistance resulting from skin effect, with relatively little power remaining for the arc itself. Only non-magnetic rods are used for high-frequency welding.

At 1 megahertz skin effect depth in wet soil is about 5.0 m; in seawater it is about 0.25 m.

== Mitigation ==

A type of cable called litz wire (from the German &quot;Litzendraht&quot;, braided wire) is used to mitigate skin effect for frequencies of a few kilohertz to about one megahertz. It consists of a number of insulated wire strands woven together in a carefully designed pattern, so that the overall magnetic field acts equally on all the wires and causes the total current to be distributed equally among them. With skin effect having little effect on each of the thin strands, the bundle does not suffer the same increase in AC resistance that a solid conductor of the same cross-sectional area would due to skin effect.

Litz wire is often used in the windings of high-frequency transformers to increase their efficiency by mitigating both skin effect and proximity effect.
Large power transformers are wound with stranded conductors of similar construction to litz wire, but employing a larger cross-section corresponding to the larger skin depth at mains frequencies.
Conductive threads composed of carbon nanotubes have been demonstrated as conductors for antennas from medium wave to microwave frequencies. Unlike standard antenna conductors, the nanotubes are much smaller than the skin depth, allowing full use of the thread&#x27;s cross-section resulting in an extremely light antenna.

High-voltage, high-current overhead power lines often use aluminum cable with a steel reinforcing core; the higher resistance of the steel core is of no consequence since it is located far below the skin depth where essentially no AC current flows.

In applications where high currents (up to thousands of amperes) flow, solid conductors are usually replaced by tubes, eliminating the inner portion of the conductor where little current flows. This hardly affects the AC resistance, but considerably reduces the weight of the conductor. The high strength but low weight of tubes substantially increases span capability. Tubular conductors are typical in electric power switchyards where the distance between supporting insulators may be several meters. Long spans generally exhibit physical sag but this does not affect electrical performance. To avoid losses, the conductivity of the tube material must be high.

In high current situations where conductors (round or flat busbar) may be between 5 and 50 mm thick skin effect also occurs at sharp bends where the metal is compressed inside the bend and stretched outside the bend. The shorter path at the inner surface results in a lower resistance, which causes most of the current to be concentrated close to the inner bend surface. This causes an increase in temperature at that region compared with the straight (unbent) area of the same conductor. A similar skin effect occurs at the corners of rectangular conductors (viewed in cross-section), where the magnetic field is more concentrated at the corners than in the sides. This results in superior performance (i.e. higher current with lower temperature rise) from wide thin conductors (for example, &quot;ribbon&quot; conductors) in which the effects from corners are effectively eliminated.

It follows that a transformer with a round core will be more efficient than an equivalent-rated transformer having a square or rectangular core of the same material.

Solid or tubular conductors may be silver-plated to take advantage of silver&#x27;s higher conductivity. This technique is particularly used at VHF to microwave frequencies where the small skin depth requires only a very thin layer of silver, making the improvement in conductivity very cost effective. Silver plating is similarly used on the surface of waveguides used for transmission of microwaves. This reduces attenuation of the propagating wave due to resistive losses affecting the accompanying eddy currents; skin effect confines such eddy currents to a very thin surface layer of the waveguide structure. Skin effect itself is not actually combatted in these cases, but the distribution of currents near the conductor&#x27;s surface makes the use of precious metals (having a lower resistivity) practical. Although it has a lower conductivity than copper and silver, gold plating is also used, because unlike copper and silver, it does not corrode. A thin oxidized layer of copper or silver would have a low conductivity, and so would cause large power losses as the majority of the current would still flow through this layer.

Recently, a method of layering non-magnetic and ferromagnetic materials with nanometer scale thicknesses has been shown to mitigate the increased resistance from skin effect for very high-frequency applications. A working theory is that the behavior of ferromagnetic materials in high frequencies results in fields and/or currents that oppose those generated by relatively nonmagnetic materials, but more work is needed to verify the exact mechanisms. As experiments have shown, this has potential to greatly improve the efficiency of conductors operating in tens of GHz or higher. This has strong ramifications for 5G communications.

== Examples ==

We can derive a practical formula for skin depth as follows:
formula_40

where

Gold is a good conductor with a resistivity of and is essentially nonmagnetic: formula_41 1, so its skin depth at a frequency of 50 Hz is given by
formula_42

Lead, in contrast, is a relatively poor conductor (among metals) with a resistivity of , about 9 times that of gold. Its skin depth at 50 Hz is likewise found to be about 33 mm, or
formula_43 times that of gold.

Highly magnetic materials have a reduced skin depth owing to their large permeability formula_44 as was pointed out above for the case of iron, despite its poorer conductivity. A practical consequence is seen by users of induction cookers, where some types of stainless steel cookware are unusable because they are not ferromagnetic.

At very high frequencies skin depth for good conductors becomes tiny. For instance, skin depths of some common metals at a frequency of 10 GHz (microwave region) are less than a micrometer:

Thus at microwave frequencies, most of the current flows in an extremely thin region near the surface. Ohmic losses of waveguides at microwave frequencies are therefore only dependent on the surface coating of the material. A layer of silver 3 μm thick evaporated on a piece of glass is thus an excellent conductor at such frequencies.

In copper, skin depth can be seen to fall according to the square root of frequency:

In &quot;Engineering Electromagnetics&quot;, Hayt points out that in a power station a busbar for alternating current at 60 Hz with a radius larger than one-third of an inch (8 mm) is a waste of copper, and in practice bus bars for heavy AC current are rarely more than half an inch (12 mm) thick except for mechanical reasons.

== Electromagnetic waves ==

In electromagnetic waves, the skin depth is the depth at which the amplitude of the electric and magnetic fields have reduced by formula_45. The intensity of the wave is proportional to the square of the amplitude, and thus the depth at which the intensity has diminished by formula_45 is formula_47 In waveguides, losses due to induced currents occur mostly within one skin depth of the surface. Thus, plating the surface of a waveguide with a material which has a low skin depth reduces losses.

== Anomalous skin effect ==
For high frequencies and low temperatures, the usual formulas for skin depth break down. This effect was first noticed by Heinz London in 1940, who correctly suggested that it is due to the mean free path length of the electrons reaching the range of the classical skin depth. Mattis–Bardeen theory was developed for this specific case for metals and superconductors.

<text>A breast pump is a mechanical device that lactating women use to extract milk from their breasts. They may be manual devices powered by hand or foot movements or automatic devices powered by electricity.

Breast pumps come in several varieties to suit different needs of mothers. Manual pumps, operated by hand, are portable and quiet, making them suitable for occasional use. Electric pumps, powered by batteries or mains electricity, offer increased efficiency and are often preferred for regular expression. Hospital-grade breast pumps are the most powerful, designed for frequent, heavy-duty use, particularly beneficial for mothers of premature infants or those with lactation challenges. Many modern breast pumps incorporate adjustable suction levels and cycling speeds to mimic a baby&#x27;s natural feeding patterns, aiming to optimize comfort and milk production for the user.

Breast pumps have been used since antiquity, with evidence suggesting their use in civilizations such as ancient Egypt and Rome. Early methods involved a variety of devices and techniques to express milk.

==History==

On June 20, 1854, the United States Patent Office issued Patent No. 11,135 to O.H. Needham for a breast pump. &quot;Scientific American&quot; (1863) credits L.O. Colbin as the inventor and patent applicant of a breast pump. In 1921–23, engineer and chess master Edward Lasker produced a mechanical breast pump that imitated an infant&#x27;s sucking action and was regarded by physicians as a marked improvement on existing hand-operated breast pumps, which failed to remove all the milk from the breast. The U.S. Patent Office issued for Lasker&#x27;s breast pump. In 1956 Einar Egnell published his groundbreaking work, &quot;Viewpoints on what happens mechanically in the female breast during various methods of milk collection&quot;. This article provided insight into the technical aspects of milk extraction from the breast. Many Egnell SMB breast pumps designed through this research are still in operation over 50 years after publication.

Archaeologists working at a glass factory site in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, excavated a 19th-century breast pipe that matches breast pumping instruments in period advertisements.

==Reasons for use==
Breast pumps are used for many reasons. Many parents use them to continue breastfeeding after they return to work. They express their milk at work, which is later bottle-fed to their child by a caregiver. This use of breast milk is widespread in the United States, where paid family leave is one of the shortest in the developed world. American historian Jill Lepore argues that the need for so-called &quot;lactation rooms&quot; and breast pumps is driven by the corporate desire for parents to return to work immediately rather than mothers&#x27; wishes or babies&#x27; needs.

A breast pump may be also used to address a range of challenges parents may encounter breast feeding, including difficulties latching, separation from an infant in intensive care, to feed an infant who cannot extract sufficient milk itself from the breast, to avoid passing medication through breast milk to the baby, or to relieve engorgement, a painful condition whereby the breasts are overfull. Pumping may also be desirable to continue lactation and its associated hormones to aid in recovery from pregnancy even if the pumped milk is not used.

In a 2012 policy statement, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended feeding preterm infants human milk, finding &quot;significant short- and long-term beneficial effects,&quot; including lower rates of necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). When infants are unable to suckle, mothers can pump if they wish their babies to be fed (via naso-gastric tube) with the mothers&#x27; own milk.

Expressing milk for donation is another use for breast pumps. Donor milk may be available from milk banks for babies who are not able to receive their mothers&#x27; milk.

&quot;Pump and dump&quot; refers to the practice of disposing of breast milk rather than pumping it to be used. This may be done because the mother produces too much milk, or because the mother will be away from the baby too long without a way to store the milk, or because of concern over alcohol or some other substance that the baby should not have.

==Efficiency and method==
Research done at Stanford University in 2009 showed the correlation of various factors with the volume of milk production in mothers of preterm babies (born before the 31st week of gestation). The research found that hand expression in addition to a breast pump (a technique called &quot;hands-on pumping&quot;, or HOP), along with other factors correlated to higher milk production. The study found that mothers who used massage techniques and hand expression more than 5 times a day in the first 3 days after birth increased their milk production 8 weeks later, milk production increased 48%. The authors produced a video showing the technique and states that this technique is good for both mothers of premature infants as well as mothers that return to work or pump for other purposes.

A second article on the same study found that the combination of HOP techniques increased the fat content of the milk expressed.
==Types of modern Breast pump==

=== Manual ===
Manual breast pumps are operated by squeezing or pulling a handle in a repetitive fashion, allowing the user to directly control the pressure and frequency of milk expression. Though manual pumps are small and inexpensive, they can require significant effort and can be tiring because the user provides all the power. These pumps may not provide sufficient stimulation and emptying of the breast. &quot;Bicycle-horn&quot; style manual pumps can damage breast tissue and harbor bacteria in the rubber suction bulb, which is difficult to clean.

Foot-powered breast pumps use the same collection tubing and breast horns as electric breast pumps, but are powered by a foot pedal. This eliminates the work of pumping by hand or the need for finding an electrical outlet with privacy.

=== Electric ===
There are two types of electric breast pumps, hospital-grade and personal-use. Hospital-grade pumps are larger and intended for multiple users. Personal-use pumps are generally intended for one user. Electric breast pumps are powered by a motor which supplies suction through plastic tubing to a horn that fits over the nipple. The portions of the pump that come into direct contact with the expressed milk must be sterilized to prevent contamination. This style provides more suction, making pumping significantly faster, and allows users to pump both their breasts at the same time. Electric breast pumps are larger than manual ones, but portable models are available (e.g. in a backpack or shoulder bag). Some models include battery packs or built-in batteries to enable portable operation of the pump. Some electric pumps allow multi-user operation but recommend an accessory kit for each user to maintain cleanliness.

Rental pumps may be recommended when medical conditions temporarily preclude breastfeeding.

Some breast pumps are designed to be part of a &quot;feeding system&quot; so that the milk storage portion of the pump is the baby bottle used to feed the infant. This allows the milk to be collected in the same bottle that will feed the baby eliminating the need to transfer breastmilk. Freezable breastmilk storage bags are available that connect directly to some breast pumps and can then be used with disposable bottle feeding systems.

==== Pressure range and safety ====
Egnell in 1956 established a 220 mmHg safe maximum for automatic cycling pumps; however, there have been reports of sensitive breasts and nipples at much lower pressures. Hartman et al., in a 2008 study, showed that the maximum comfortable vacuum enhances milk flow and milk yield.

==Open collection systems vs. closed collection systems==
Pump designs are referred to as either open or closed based on whether there is a barrier between where the tubing connects to the pump and where milk flows into the pump. The plastic tubing and horn of an electric breast pump are commonly referred to as the collection system and typically supply the pump&#x27;s suction.

A closed collection system has a barrier or diaphragm that separates the pump tubing from the horn. In this design, the suction of the pump motor lifts the diaphragm to create a vacuum within the collection system to extract milk.

In contrast, an open system does not have a barrier between the tubing and the horn. Bacteria and viral filters may be present to prevent contamination or overflow into pump motor. The pump motor&#x27;s suction is directly passed to the breast versus indirectly as with closed-diaphragm systems.

Open-collection systems can cause milk to overflow into the collection system tubing, and milk particles being drawn into the pump motor. If milk leaks into the pump&#x27;s tubing, the tubes should be washed, sterilized and air-dried prior to using the pump again. Failure to thoroughly clean collection tubing may lead to mould growth within the tubing. Some models of pumps have bacteria and overflow filters which prevent milk from entering the tubing.

A subtype of the open-collection system is the single-user suction source. These pumps have added hygienic benefit in that all the parts that generate the suction and come in contact with breast milk stay with the mother. The parts that generate the suction are external to the pump and can be removed, preventing cross-contamination. These pumps are considered &quot;hospital grade&quot; and virtually eliminate the chance of cross-contamination of the pump from user to user. However, it is important to clean the diaphragm as condensation or milk reaching this part can cause bacterial contamination.

A disadvantage of the diaphragm is that it may limit the amount of air/suction available to extract milk from the breast. It may also not be able to compensate for larger shield sizes.

There are no studies comparing the open- versus closed-system design. Most information in marketing materials by breast-pump manufacturers is offered without studies to back them up.

==Milk collection and storage==

Most breast pumps direct the pumped milk into a container that can be used for storage and feeding. Some manufacturers offer adapters to fit a variety of types and sizes of bottles, enabling more flexibility to mix and match products of different brands.

The expressed breast milk (EBM) may be stored and later fed to a baby by bottle. It can either be frozen directly in the bottle, or stored in disposable breast milk bags which are more compact when frozen, thus saving space in a freezer. Expressed milk may be kept at room temperature for up to six hours (at 66-72 degrees Fahrenheit, around 20 degrees Celsius), in an insulated cooler with ice packs for up to one day, refrigerated at the back of the refrigerator for up to 5 days (optimal: use or freeze the milk within 3 days), or frozen for 12 months in a deep freeze separate from a refrigerator maintained at a temperature of 0 degrees Fahrenheit or −18 degrees Celsius (optimal: use this milk within 6 months). If using frozen milk, the oldest milk should be thawed and used first. Thawing can be done by placing the frozen milk in the refrigerator the night before intended use, or by placing the milk in a bowl of warm water. Breast milk should never be microwaved as this can produce dangerous hot areas and may also destroy the milk&#x27;s antibodies. Many experts recommend discarding thawed milk that is not used within 24 hours. Breast milk changes to meet a baby&#x27;s needs so that breast milk expressed when a baby is a newborn will not as completely meet the same baby&#x27;s needs when he or she is a few months older. Also, storage guidelines might differ for preterm, sick or hospitalized infants.

Expressed milk may be donated to milk banks, which provide human breast milk to premature infants and other children whose mothers cannot provide for them.

<text>The IBM System/36 (often abbreviated as S/36) was a midrange computer marketed by IBM from 1983 to 2000 - a multi-user, multi-tasking successor to the System/34.

Like the System/34 and the older System/32, the System/36 was primarily programmed in the RPG II language. One of the machine&#x27;s optional features was an off-line storage mechanism (on the 5360 model) that utilized &quot;magazines&quot; – boxes of 8-inch floppies that the machine could load and eject in a nonsequential fashion. The System/36 also had many mainframe features such as programmable job queues and scheduling priority levels.

While these systems were similar to other manufacturer&#x27;s minicomputers, IBM themselves described the System/32, System/34 and System/36 as &quot;small systems&quot; and later as midrange computers along with the System/38 and succeeding IBM AS/400 range.

The AS/400 series and IBM Power Systems running IBM i can run System/36 code in the System/36 Environment, although the code needs to be recompiled on IBM i first.

==Overview of the IBM System/36==
The IBM System/36 was a popular small business computer system, first announced on 16 May 1983 and shipped later that year. It had a 17-year product lifespan. The first model of the System/36 was the 5360.

In the 1970s, the U.S. Department of Justice brought an antitrust lawsuit against IBM, claiming it was using unlawful practices to knock out competitors. At this time, IBM had been about to consolidate its entire line (System/370, 4300, System/32, System/34, System/38) into one &quot;family&quot; of computers with the same ISAM database technology, programming languages, and hardware architecture. After the lawsuit was filed, IBM decided it would have two families: the System/38 line, intended for large companies and representing IBM&#x27;s future direction, and the System/36 line, intended for small companies who had used the company&#x27;s legacy System/32/34 computers. In the late 1980s the lawsuit was dropped, and IBM decided to recombine the two product lines, creating the AS/400 - which replaced both the System/36 and System/38.

The System/36 used virtually the same RPG II, Screen Design Aid, OCL, and other technologies that the System/34 used, though it was object-code incompatible. The S/36 was a small business computer; it had an 8-inch diskette drive, between one and four hard drives in sizes of 30 to 716 MB, and memory from 128K up to 7MB. Tape drives were available as backup devices; the 6157 QIC (quarter-inch cartridge) and the reel-to-reel 8809 both had capacities of roughly 60MB. The Advanced/36 9402 tape drive had a capacity of 2.5GB. The IBM 5250 series of terminals were the primary interface to the System/36.

==System architecture==

===Processors===
S/36s have two 16-bit processors, the CSP or Control Storage Processor, and the MSP or Main Storage Processor. The MSP is the workhorse; it performs the instructions in the computer programs. The CSP is the governor; it performs system functions in the background. Special utility programs are able to make direct calls to the CSP to perform certain functions; these are usually system programs like $CNFIG which is used to configure the computer system. As with the earlier System/32 and System/34 hardware, the execution of so-called &quot;scientific instructions&quot; (i.e. floating-point operations) is implemented in software on the CSP.

The primary purpose of the CSP is to keep the MSP busy; as such, it runs at slightly more than four times the speed of the MSP. The first System/36 models (the 5360-A) have a 4 MHz CSP and a 1 MHz MSP. The CSP loads code and data into main storage &quot;behind&quot; the MSP&#x27;s program counter. As the MSP is working on one process, the CSP is filling storage for the &quot;next&quot; process.

The 5360 processors came in four models, labeled 5360-A through 5360-D. The later &quot;D&quot; model is about 60 percent faster than the &quot;A&quot; model.

===Front panel===

The 5360, 5362, and 5363 processors had a front panel display with four hexadecimal LEDs. If the operator &quot;dialed up&quot; the combination F-F-0-0 before performing an Initial Program Load (IPL, or system boot), many diagnostics were skipped, causing the duration of the IPL to be about a minute instead of about 10 minutes. Of course part of the IPL was typically keysorting the indexed files and if the machine had been shut down without a &quot;keysort&quot; (performed part of the P S (or STOP SYSTEM) then depending on the number of indexed files (and their sizes) it could take upwards of an hour to come back up.

===Memory and disk===

The smallest S/36 had 128K of RAM and a 30 MB hard drive.

The largest configured S/36 could support 7MB of RAM and 1478MB of disk space. This cost over US$200,000 back in the early 1980s. S/36 hard drives contained a feature called &quot;the extra cylinder,&quot; so that bad spots on the drive were detected and dynamically mapped out to good spots on the extra cylinder. It is therefore possible for the S/36 to use more space than it can technically address. Disk address sizes limit the size of the active S/36 partition to about 2GB; however, the Advanced/36 Large Package had a 4GB hard drive which could contain up to three (emulated) S/36s, and Advanced/36 computers had more memory than SSP could address (32MB to 96MB) which was used to increase disk caching.

Disk space on the System/36 was organized by &quot;blocks&quot;, with one block consisting of 2560 bytes. A high-end 5360 system would ship with about 550,000 blocks of disk space available. System objects could be allocated in blocks or records, but internally it was always blocks.

The System/36 supported memory paging, referred to as &quot;swapping&quot;.

===Software===

The System Support Program (SSP) was the only operating system of the S/36. It contained support for multiprogramming, multiple processors, 80 devices, job queues, printer queues, security, indexed file support, and fully installed, it was about 10MB. On the Advanced/36, the number of workstations/printers was increased to 160. In the Guest/36 environment of certain OS/400 releases, up to 216 devices were supported.

The S/36 could compile and run programs up to 64 kB in size, although most were not this large. This became a bottleneck issue only for the largest screen programs. With the Advanced/36, there were features added to the SSP operating system including the ability to call other programs from within. So a program that was say 60 kB could call another program that was 30kB or 40KB. This call/parm had been available with third-party packages on the System/36 but not widely used until the feature was put in 7.1 and 7.5 of SSP on the Advanced/36.

==Hardware models==
===Main line===
====System/36 Model 5360====

The System/36 5360 was the first model of System/36. It weighed 700 lb (318 kg), cost $140,000 and is believed to have had processor speeds of about 2 MHz and 8 MHz for its two processors. The system ran on 208 or 240 volts AC.

The five red lights on the System/36 were as follows:
(1) Power check.
(2) Processor check.
(3) Program check.
(4) Console check.
(5) Temperature check.

If any light other than #4 ever came on, the system needed to be rebooted. Console can be restored if it has been powered off, but the other conditions are unrecoverable.

There were various models of the 5360, including a C and D model that dealt with speed and the ability to support an additional frame to house two additional drives.

====System/36 Model 5362====
IBM introduced the 5362 or &quot;Compact 36&quot; in 1984 as a system targeted at the lower end of their market. It had a deskside tower form factor. It was designed to operate in a normal office environment, requiring little special consideration. It differed from the 5360 in by having a more limited card cage, capable of fewer peripherals. It used 14&quot; fixed disks (30 or 60 MB) and could support up to two; main storage ranged from 128 KB to 512 KB. One 8&quot; floppy diskette drive was built in. The 5362 also allowed the use of a channel attached external desktop 9332-200, 400, &amp; 600 DASD, effectively allowing a maximum of 720MB.

The 5362 weighed 150 pounds (68 kg) and cost $20,000.

====System/36 Model 5364====
The model 5364 was called the &quot;System/36 PC&quot; or &quot;Desktop 36&quot; (and also, informally, the &quot;Baby/36&quot; by some – but this name was later attached to a software program produced by California Software Products, Inc.). The 5364 was a June 1985 attempt by IBM to implement a System/36 on PC-sized hardware. Inside, there were IBM chips, but the cabinet size was reminiscent of an IBM PC/AT of the period. The machine had a 1.2 MB 5.25-inch diskette drive, which was incompatible with PCs and with other S/36s. The control panel/system console (connected via an expansion card) was an IBM PC with at least 256 KB RAM.

====System/36 Model 5363====
The model 5363 was positioned as a replacement for the 5364, and was announced in October 1987. It used a deskside tower style enclosure like that of the 5362, but was only 2/3 the size. It featured updated hardware using newer, smaller hard drive platters, a 5&quot; diskette drive, and a revised distribution of the SSP.

===AS/400-based backports===
The &quot;System/36 Environment&quot; of IBM i (previously OS/400) is a feature which provides a number of SSP utilities, as well as RPG II and OCL support. It does not implement binary compatibility with the System/36 - instead it allows programmers to port System/36 applications to IBM i by recompiling the code on top of the System/36 Environment, generating programs which use the native IBM i APIs.

From V3R6 to V4R4, OS/400 was capable of running up to three instances of SSP inside virtual machines known as &quot;Advanced 36 Machines&quot;. This relied on emulation of emulation of the MSP implemented by the OS/400 SLIC, and thus provided binary compatibility with SSP programs.

====AS/Entry (9401)====

The AS/Entry was just a stripped-down AS/400, first model was based on a AS/400 9401-P03. The operating system was SSP Release 6. This machine was offered c.1991 to target customers who had a S/36 and wanted to one day migrate to an AS/400, but did not want a large investment in an AS/400. In this regard, the AS/Entry was a failure because IBM decided the machine&#x27;s architecture was not economically feasible and the older model 5363 that the 9401 was based on was a much more reliable system.

The entry line was later upgraded to AS/400 9401-150 hardware.
==== Advanced/36 (9402, 9406) ====

In 1994, IBM released the AS/400 Advanced/36 with two models (9402-236 and 9402-436). Priced as low as $7995, it was a machine that allowed System/36 users to get faster and more modern hardware while &quot;staying 36&quot;. Based on standard AS/400 hardware, the Advanced/36 could run SSP, the operating system of the System/36, alone, or within AS/400&#x27;s OS/400 as a virtual machine so that it could be upgraded to a full-blown AS/400 for just extra licensing costs. The A/36 was packaged in a black enclosure which was slightly larger than a common PC cabinet.

The Advanced/36 bought the world of System/36 and SSP about five more years in the marketplace, but by the end of the 20th century, the marketplace for the System/36 was almost unrecognizable. The IBM printers and displays that had completely dominated the marketplace in the 80s were replaced by a PC or a third-party monitor with an attached PC-type printer. Twinaxial cable had disappeared in favor of cheap adapters and standard telephone wire. The System/36 was eventually replaced by AS/400s at the high end and PCs at the low end. 

The Advanced line was later upgraded to AS/400 9406-170 hardware. By 2000, the Advanced/36 was withdrawn from marketing.

<doc id="261659" wikidata="Q130853" url="?curid=261659" title="Plácido Domingo">
<text>José Plácido Domingo Embil (born 21 January 1941) is a Spanish opera singer, conductor, and arts administrator. He has recorded over a hundred complete operas and is well known for his versatility, regularly performing in Italian, French, German, Spanish, English and Russian in the most prestigious opera houses in the world. Although primarily a &quot;lirico-spinto&quot; tenor for most of his career, especially popular for his Cavaradossi, Hoffmann, Don José and Canio, he quickly moved into more dramatic roles, becoming the most acclaimed Otello of his generation. In the early 2010s, he transitioned from the tenor repertory into exclusively baritone parts, including &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;. As of 2020, he has performed 151 different roles.

Domingo has also achieved significant success as a crossover artist, especially in the genres of Latin and popular music. In addition to winning fourteen Grammy and Latin Grammy Awards, several of his records have gone silver, gold, platinum and multi-platinum. His first pop album, &quot;Perhaps Love&quot; (1981), spread his fame beyond the opera world. The title song, performed as a duet with country and folk singer John Denver, has sold almost four million copies and helped lead to numerous television appearances for the tenor. He also starred in many cinematically released and televised opera movies, particularly under the direction of Franco Zeffirelli. In 1990, he began singing with fellow tenors Luciano Pavarotti and José Carreras as part of The Three Tenors. The first Three Tenors recording became the best-selling classical album of all time.

Growing up working in his parents&#x27; zarzuela company in Mexico, Domingo has since regularly promoted this form of Spanish opera. He also increasingly conducts operas and concerts and was the general director of the Los Angeles Opera in California from 2017 to 2019. He was initially the artistic director and later general director of the Washington National Opera from 1996 to 2011. He has been involved in numerous humanitarian works, as well as efforts to help young opera singers, including starting and running the international singing competition, Operalia. In the years 2019–2021 he has performed continuously on stages in Berlin, Budapest, Cologne, Graz, Madrid, Mérida, Milan, Monte Carlo, Moscow, Munich, Palermo, Rome, Salzburg, Sofia, Verona, Versailles, Vienna and Zurich.

==Early life==
Plácido Domingo was born on 21 January 1941 in the Retiro district of Madrid, Spain. His mother recalled that she and her husband knew he would be a musician from the age of five, due to his ability to hum complex music from a zarzuela after seeing a performance of it. In 1949, just days before his eighth birthday, he moved to Mexico with his family. His parents, both singers, had decided to start a zarzuela company there after a successful tour of Latin America. Soon after arriving in Mexico, Domingo won a singing contest for boys, and his parents occasionally recruited him and his sister for children&#x27;s roles in their zarzuela productions. Domingo studied piano from a young age, at first privately and later at the National Conservatory of Music in Mexico City, which he entered when he was fourteen. At the conservatory, he also attended conducting classes taught by Igor Markevitch and studied voice under Carlo Morelli, the brother of Renato Zanelli. The two brothers were famous practitioners of both baritone and tenor roles. Domingo&#x27;s conservatory classes constituted the entirety of his formal vocal instruction; he never studied privately with a singing teacher.

In 1957, at age sixteen, Domingo made his first professional appearance, accompanying his mother on the piano at a concert at Mérida, Yucatán. The same year he made his major zarzuela debut in Manuel Fernández Caballero&#x27;s , singing a baritone role. At that time, he was working with his parents&#x27; zarzuela company, eventually taking several baritone roles and acting as an accompanist for other singers. The following year, the tenor in another company&#x27;s touring production of &quot;Luisa Fernanda&quot; fell ill. In his first performance as a tenor, Domingo replaced the ailing singer, although he feared the part&#x27;s tessitura was too high for him. Later that same year, he sang the tenor role of Rafael in the Spanish opera &quot;El gato montés&quot;, illustrating his willingness to assay the tenor range, even as he still considered himself a baritone. On 12 May 1959 at the Teatro Degollado in Guadalajara, he appeared in the baritone role (sometimes sung by basses) of Pascual in Emilio Arrieta&#x27;s . Like &quot;El gato montés&quot;, &quot;Marina&quot; is an opera composed in the zarzuela musical style rather than a zarzuela proper, although both are usually performed by zarzuela companies. In addition to his work with zarzuelas, among his earliest performances was a minor role in the first Latin American production of the musical &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, in which he was also the assistant conductor and assistant coach. While he was a member, the company gave 185 performances of the musical in various cities in Mexico.
In 1959, Domingo auditioned for the Mexico National Opera at the Palacio de Béllas Artes as a baritone, but was then asked to sight-read the tenor aria &quot;Amor ti vieta&quot; from &quot;Fedora&quot;. He was accepted at the National Opera as a tenor comprimario and as a tutor for other singers. In what he considered his operatic debut, Domingo sang the minor role of Borsa in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; on 23 September at the Palacio de Bellas Artes in a production with veteran American baritone Cornell MacNeil and bass-baritone Norman Treigle. He later appeared as the Padre Confessor in &quot;Dialogues of the Carmelites&quot;, Altoum and Pang in &quot;Turandot&quot;, Normanno and Arturo in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; among other small parts. While at the National Opera, he also appeared in a production of Lehár&#x27;s operetta, &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, in which he alternated as Camille and Danilo (both originally created as tenor roles, although the latter is often sung by baritones). Domingo made his debut in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; at Béllas Artes at age 21 in the summer of 1962 not in the title rôle for which he has now been internationally famous for decades as one of its greatest interpreters, but in the small comprimario part of Cassio.
To supplement his income, the young Domingo played the piano for a ballet company, as well as for a program on Mexico&#x27;s newly founded cultural television station. The program consisted of excerpts from zarzuelas, operettas, operas, and musical comedies. He acted in a few small parts while at the theater in plays by Federico García Lorca, Luigi Pirandello, and Anton Chekhov. He also provided song arrangements and backup vocals for &quot;Los Camisas Negras&quot; in the late 1950s, a rock-and-roll band led by César Costa. In his autobiography, Domingo reflected on the benefits of his busy and varied career as a teenager: &quot;Today, when people ask me how I manage to hold up under my extremely heavy work load, I answer that I became accustomed to intense activity very early in my life and that I love it now as I loved it then.&quot;

==Career==
===1960s–1980s===

====Establishing a career in opera====

In 1961, Domingo made his operatic debut in a leading role as Alfredo in &quot;La traviata&quot; at the Teatro de la Ciudad in Monterrey. Later the same year, he made his debut in the United States with the Dallas Civic Opera, where he sang the role of Arturo in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot; opposite Joan Sutherland in the title role and Ettore Bastianini as Enrico. In 1962, he returned to Texas to sing the role of Edgardo in the same opera with Lily Pons at the Fort Worth Opera. It would be the soprano&#x27;s final operatic performance. That November Domingo sang the second tenor role of Cassio to Mario del Monaco&#x27;s celebrated Otello in Hartford, Connecticut. At the end of 1962, he signed a six-month contract with the Israel National Opera in Tel Aviv, but later extended the contract and stayed for two and a half years, singing 280 performances of 12 different roles.

In June 1965, after finishing his contract in Tel Aviv, Domingo auditioned at the New York City Opera. He was hired to make his New York debut as Don José in Bizet&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; with the company, but his debut came earlier than expected on 17 June 1965 when he filled in for an ailing tenor at the last minute in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;. In February 1966, he sang the title role in the U.S. premiere of Ginastera&#x27;s &quot;Don Rodrigo&quot; at the New York City Opera, to much acclaim. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review noted: &quot;Mr. Domingo was as impressive as ever—a big, burly, large-voiced singer who looks exactly as one would visualize a hero from Gothic Spain.&quot; The performance also marked the opening of the City Opera&#x27;s new home at Lincoln Center.

His official debut at the Metropolitan Opera in New York occurred on 28 September 1968, when he substituted with little notice for Franco Corelli in Cilea&#x27;s &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot; with Renata Tebaldi. Two years before this &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;, he had already performed with the Metropolitan Opera at Lewisohn Stadium in Mascagni&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; and Leoncavallo&#x27;s &quot;Pagliacci&quot;. Since then, he has opened the season at the Metropolitan Opera 21 times, more than any other singer, surpassing the previous record of Enrico Caruso by four. He has appeared with the company every season since 1968–1969. He made his debut at the Vienna State Opera in 1967; at the Lyric Opera of Chicago in 1968; at both La Scala and San Francisco Opera in 1969; at Arena di Verona on 16 July 1969 as Calaf (his first) in &quot;Turandot&quot; with Birgit Nilsson; at the Philadelphia Lyric Opera Company in 1970; and at Covent Garden in 1971. In 1975, Domingo debuted at the prestigious Salzburg Festival, singing the title role in &quot;Don Carlo&quot; in an all-star cast with Nicolai Ghiaurov, Piero Cappuccilli, Mirella Freni and Christa Ludwig with Herbert von Karajan conducting. Thereafter Domingo frequently returned to Salzburg for a number of operas, as well as for several concert performances. He has now sung at practically every important opera house and festival worldwide.
Domingo first sang Mario Cavaradossi in Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; in a 1961 performance in Mexico City. He sang Cavaradossi at the Met on 15 February 1969 with Nilsson (broadcast). 1971 he made his Covent Garden debut in the role. He continued to sing the part for many years, especially at the Met and in Vienna, eventually performing it more than any other of his roles. In September 1975, Domingo debuted in the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot; at the Hamburg State Opera. It soon became his signature role and one of operas he performed most frequently (over 200 times). He recorded the part three times in the studio and appeared in four officially released filmed versions of the opera. Oscar-winning Shakespearean actor, Laurence Olivier, declared after seeing the tenor in the role: &quot;Domingo plays Othello as well as I do &quot;and&quot; he has that voice.&quot;

Domingo has also conducted operas and occasionally symphony orchestras as well. On 7 October 1973 he conducted his first opera performance, &quot;La traviata&quot; starring Patricia Brooks at the New York City Opera. The same year he released his debut album as a conductor, &quot;Domingo Conducts Milnes/Milnes Conducts Domingo&quot;, with baritone Sherrill Milnes. Domingo increasingly began to appear as a conductor at major opera houses around the world. In late 1983, he led a performance of Johan Strauss&#x27;s &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot; at Covent Garden, which was televised. Three years later, he made a studio recording of the operetta, in which he both conducted and sang the role of Alfred.

====Growing celebrity====

The 1980s were a time of growing success and fame for Domingo. In 1981 he gained considerable recognition outside of the opera world when he recorded the song &quot;Perhaps Love&quot; as a duet with the American country/folk music singer John Denver. He followed this success with many more albums of popular and Latin music. Domingo expressed the hope that his popular albums would expand his fan base in a way that would eventually lead more people to discover opera. These forays outside of the opera world led to numerous television appearances for the tenor, who was no longer known only by classical music lovers. In 1987, he and Denver joined Julie Andrews for an Emmy Award-winning holiday television special, &quot;The Sound of Christmas&quot;, filmed in Salzburg, Austria. He was interviewed on many talk shows and news programs, including &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; with Johnny Carson and &quot;60 Minutes&quot;. Increasingly substantial numbers of his operatic performances were also shown on television during the 1980s.

After gaining experience acting for the cameras in numerous televised operas, Domingo performed in his first cinematically released opera movie, &quot;La Traviata&quot;, in 1982. He had worked with the film&#x27;s director, former Academy Award nominee Franco Zeffirelli, previously in staged opera productions. Even as filming continued in Rome, he commuted back and forth to perform live in Vienna, Buenos Aires, Barcelona, and Madrid. In 1984, Domingo filmed the role of Don José in Francesco Rosi&#x27;s movie version of &quot;Carmen&quot; in his native Spain. Zeffirelli reunited with the tenor two years later for another version of an opera, &quot;Otello&quot;, that ran in movie theaters worldwide. Domingo considered &quot;Carmen&quot; the best of the three, although he disagreed with the director&#x27;s &quot;low conception&quot; of his character. He found &quot;La traviata&quot; to be &quot;impressive&quot;, but expressed displeasure over cuts to the music in Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Otello&quot;.

Even while diversifying his career, he continued to appear with great frequency in largely well-received operatic performances. By 1982 &quot;Newsweek&quot; declared Domingo &quot;King Of The Opera&quot; on its cover. The magazine&#x27;s featured article, which recounted and analyzed his career, praised the singer for his &quot;heroic voice, superb musicianship, fine acting skills and dashing Latin good looks&quot;. That same year, Domingo appeared at the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s opening night performance of Bellini&#x27;s &quot;Norma&quot;. It was the first time onstage that the tenor sang the part of Pollione, one of his rare excursions into the bel canto repertory. He was also set to open the Met&#x27;s 1983-1984 centennial season debuting as Enée in a well publicized new production of Berlioz&#x27; &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, but a couple months in advance expressed uncertainty whether he could successful sing the role&#x27;s high tessitura without harming his voice. He asked to be released from his contract, but eventually decided to sing four of the six performances in the run with his friend James Levine conducting, including one performance that was telecast. He never sang the part again.

During rehearsals for &quot;Les Troyens&quot;, Domingo rescued the opening night of the San Francisco Opera&#x27;s season. The tenor scheduled to sing Otello, Carlo Cossutta, cancelled on the day of the performance. The company asked Domingo to replace him at 4 p.m. He quickly flew from New York to San Francisco, rushed to the opera house, and appeared in the role at 10:30 in the evening. A writer for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, among other journalists, reported extensively on the event. He observed the crowds gathering around the stage door for the tenor&#x27;s arrival and remarked on how most of the waiting audience members &quot;were breathless over the chance to see Placido Domingo, a star who draws the kind of rapt devotion that Mick Jagger inspires among rock fans.&quot;

For the opening night of the following Met season, Domingo returned to the role of Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Lohengrin&quot;, which he had last sung in early 1968. He had originally dropped the role from his repertoire after he felt his voice had been temporarily damaged by learning the challenging opera. &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that the now more mature artist &quot;lacked the chrome-plated, penetrating quality that one associates with German tenors&quot;, but praised him for bringing &quot;an unusual legato grace to a role that is seldom sung so beautifully&quot;. He also performed the role at the Vienna State Opera in 1985 and 1990. A performance during his last run of the opera was televised on 28 January 1990 and later released on VHS and DVD. He had just recovered from the flu at the time.

On 19 September 1985 the biggest earthquake in Mexico&#x27;s history devastated part of the Mexican capital. Domingo&#x27;s aunt, uncle, nephew and his nephew&#x27;s young son were killed in the collapse of the Nuevo León apartment block in the Tlatelolco housing complex. Cancelling several performances, Domingo himself labored to rescue survivors. During the next year, he performed benefit concerts for the victims and released an album of one of the events. Also in 1986 he appeared in a special gala concert for Queen Elizabeth II and in the world premiere of &quot;Goya&quot;, an opera that Gian Carlo Menotti composed specifically for him. Domingo had encouraged Menotti to make the opera about the Spanish painter Francisco Goya, whose life fascinated the singer.

===Since 1990===

====Changing repertoire====
Since the 1990s Domingo has continued adding new roles to his growing repertoire, while dropping earlier parts. The 1990s were the start of rapid change in the types of roles the tenor performed. During this decade he sang his last Cavaradossi, Don Carlo, Don José, Gustavo/Riccardo, Hoffmann, and Alvaro, among others, and he began instead to expand the breadth of his roles more substantially beyond the standard Italian and French repertory (Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Requiem&quot; in 1979). In particular, he increased his involvement in Wagnerian operas. Although he had already sung Lohengrin and recorded a few operas by the composer, he did not perform any of Wagner&#x27;s works frequently onstage until he debuted as Parsifal in 1991 and Siegmund in 1992. He continued to sing these roles for almost two decades, including at the Bayreuth Festival.
For the first time in over three decades, Domingo debuted in a Mozart opera, &quot;Idomeneo&quot;, in 1994 at the Met. During the nineties, he also appeared in the early Verdi opera, &quot;Stiffelio&quot;, the Brazilian &quot;Il Guarany&quot;, and the French grand operas, &quot;Hérodiade&quot; and &quot;Le prophète&quot;, all of which are rarely performed. Toward the end of the decade, he added his first Russian-language opera, Tchaikovsky&#x27;s &quot;The Queen of Spades&quot; (although he had performed &quot;Eugene Onegin&quot; in translation while in Israel early in his career).

In the 2000s, he sang his last performances of some of the most successful operas from early in his career: &quot;Andrea Chénier&quot;, &quot;Samson et Dalila&quot;, &quot;Otello&quot;, &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;, &quot;Fedora&quot;, &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and &quot;Adriana Lecouvreur&quot;. In the twenty-first century, however, he has focused mostly on new roles. Early in the 2000s he sang the role of Arrigo in two concert performances of Verdi&#x27;s rare &quot;La battaglia di Legnano&quot; and debuted in Wolf-Ferrari&#x27;s &quot;Sly&quot;, an opera that his Three Tenors colleague José Carreras had recently revived from obscurity. Domingo himself worked to popularize Franco Alfano&#x27;s infrequently performed &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; a few years later. Shifting musical styles again, he appeared in the eighteenth-century operas &quot;Iphigénie en Tauride&quot; and &quot;Tamerlano&quot; late in the decade.

Additionally, Domingo created several new roles in modern operas, such as the title role in Tan Dun&#x27;s 2006 opera &quot;The First Emperor&quot; at the Metropolitan Opera, which was broadcast worldwide into movie theaters as part of the Met Live in HD series. In September 2010, he created the role of the poet Pablo Neruda in the world première of Daniel Catán&#x27;s opera &quot;Il Postino&quot; at the Los Angeles Opera. During the 2011–2012 season, Domingo sang Neptune in the Metropolitan Opera&#x27;s world premiere performance of Jeremy Sams&#x27; &quot;The Enchanted Island&quot;. A pastiche of Baroque opera with story and characters drawn from Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest&quot; and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, a performance of the production was telecast on PBS&#x27; &quot;Great Performances at the Met&quot;.

====High-profile appearances====
Giving him greater international recognition outside of the world of opera, Domingo participated in The Three Tenors concert on the eve of the 1990 FIFA World Cup final in Rome with José Carreras and Luciano Pavarotti. The event was originally conceived to raise money for the José Carreras International Leukemia Foundation and was later repeated a number of times, including at the three subsequent World Cup finals (1994 in Los Angeles, 1998 in Paris, and 2002 in Yokohama). The recording of their first appearance together, &quot;Carreras Domingo Pavarotti in Concert&quot;, went multi-platinum with sales in excess of three million in the United States alone, eventually outselling every previous classical album worldwide. Domingo and his colleagues won the Grammy Award for Best Classical Vocal Solo for the album. Four years after their first successful concert, around 1.3 billion viewers worldwide watched their televised second World Cup performance at Dodger Stadium. The recording of that event, &quot;The Three Tenors in Concert 1994&quot;, went platinum and multi-platinum in many countries, even reaching the number one spot on the UK Albums Chart. Without Pavarotti and Carreras, Domingo made an appearance at the 2006 FIFA World Cup Final in Berlin, along with rising stars Anna Netrebko and Rolando Villazón. Before the 2014 FIFA World Cup final, he performed in Rio de Janeiro with pianist Lang Lang and soprano Ana María Martínez, a winner of his Operalia competition and a frequent singing partner of his. In addition to these large-scale concerts, Domingo recorded the official song for the 1982 FIFA World Cup in Spain, &quot;El Mundial&quot;.

A lifelong football fan, Domingo has been a vocal supporter of Real Madrid C.F., his home-town team. In 2002, he performed the club&#x27;s new commemorative anthem, &quot;Himno del Centenario del Real Madrid&quot;. It was written by José María Cano, with whom he had previously collaborated on the opera, &quot;Luna&quot;. Domingo presented the song live at the Bernabeu Stadium during celebrations of the football club&#x27;s 100 year anniversary. On 13 May 2012, Domingo performed during Real Madrid&#x27;s season-ending celebrations, when the team won their 32nd Spanish league title. In 2016 he sang the new version of Real Madrid&#x27;s &quot;Hala Madrid y nada más&quot; with &quot;...Y Nada Mas.&quot; 
On 24 August 2008, Domingo performed a duet with Song Zuying, singing &quot;Ài de Huǒyàn (The Flame of Love)&quot; at the 2008 Summer Olympics closing ceremony in Beijing. The Beijing Olympics was the second Olympics at which he performed; he also sang the Olympic Hymn at the closing ceremonies of the Barcelona Olympics in 1992.

In 2002, he made a guest appearance on the song &quot;Novus&quot;, the closing track on Santana&#x27;s album &quot;Shaman&quot;. Domingo sang before Benedict XVI, during the pope&#x27;s visit to Nationals Park and the Italian embassy in Washington, D.C., on 16 and 17 April 2008. On 15 March 2009, the Metropolitan Opera paid tribute to Domingo&#x27;s 40th and the company&#x27;s 125th anniversaries with a gala performance and onstage dinner. On 29 August 2009, he sang &quot;Panis angelicus&quot; at the funeral mass of Senator Ted Kennedy in the Basilica of Our Lady of Perpetual Help in Boston, Massachusetts. In March 2011, Domingo cancelled an engagement in Buenos Aires at the Teatro Colón in support of the theatre&#x27;s musicians, who were on strike.

====As an opera company director====
Domingo began an affiliation with the Washington National Opera in 1986, when he appeared in its world premiere production of Menotti&#x27;s &quot;Goya&quot;. This was followed by performances in a production of &quot;Tosca&quot; in the 1988/89 season. Beginning in the 1996/97 season, he took on the role of Artistic Director, bringing new life to the company&#x27;s productions through his many connections to singers throughout the world and his own annual appearances in one role each season. One example of his ability to bring new singers to the stage were those by the then up-and-coming Anna Netrebko as Gilda in &quot;Rigoletto&quot; during the 1999/2000 season. In 2003 Domingo became General Director and his contract was extended through the 2010–2011 season.

Parallel to Domingo&#x27;s management of the Washington company, he had been Artistic Director of the Los Angeles Opera since 2000. He assumed the position of General Director of the company in 2003. On 20 September 2010, he announced that he would renew his contract as General Director through 2013. A week later he announced that he would not renew his contract as General Director of the Washington National Opera beyond its June 2011 expiration date. Reaction to this included &quot;The Washington Post&quot;″s comments on his accomplishments: 
:Domingo&#x27;s goal was to make the WNO an internationally regarded company. At the beginning of his tenure, he lifted the opera to a new level, bringing in more international stars and big-name productions – including José Carreras in Wolf-Ferrari&#x27;s &quot;Sly&quot;, Mirella Freni singing opposite Domingo in &quot;Fedora&quot;, and Renée Fleming in &quot;Lucrezia Borgia&quot;. And his commitment to American opera meant that the WNO presented the second or third productions of a number of important works: Maw&#x27;s &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, Bolcom&#x27;s &quot;A View From the Bridge&quot;, Previn&#x27;s &quot;A Streetcar Named Desire&quot;.
Domingo attempted to quash criticism in East Coast newspapers that he was taking on too much when the singer gave an interview in the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; in which he restated his long-time motto, &quot;When I rest, I rust&quot;.

In October 2019, Domingo resigned as general director of the Los Angeles Opera amid accusations of sexual harassment.

====Taking on baritone roles====

Domingo announced in 2007 that two years later he would take on one of Verdi&#x27;s most demanding baritone roles, singing the title role in &quot;Simon Boccanegra&quot;. His debut performance in the part occurred at the Berlin State Opera on 24 October, followed by 29 other performances during the 2009–2010 season at major opera houses around the world, including the Met and the Royal Opera House in London.

After the success of Boccanegra, Domingo has performed other baritone roles including the character of Rigoletto in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Rigoletto&quot; in August 2010 at Reignwood Theatre in Beijing. In March 2012, for the first time he sang the baritone role of the Cenobite monk Athanaël in Massenet&#x27;s &quot;Thaïs&quot;, his 139th role. Again, in 2011 he undertook the role of Rigoletto in a live television broadcast in Europe which was shot in real locations in Mantua.

He appeared as Doge Francesco Foscari in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;I due Foscari&quot; in a production directed by Thaddeus Strassberger for the Los Angeles Opera in September 2012, in Valencia in early 2013, and at Covent Garden in late 2014. In March 2013, at the Metropolitan Opera, he appeared for the first time as Giorgio Germont in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La Traviata&quot;. The following year, he sang Giacomo in Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco&quot; in Salzburg. Later in 2014, he debuted as the Conte di Luna in &quot;Il trovatore&quot; in Berlin. The following season, he sang di Luna again at the Salzburg Festival with Anna Netrebko as Leonora, Marie-Nicole Lemieux as Azucena and Francesco Meli as Manrico. He first sang the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Nabucco&quot; at Covent Garden in March–April 2013 and has since reprised it in Saint Petersburg, Beijing, Verona, and Vienna. In 2015, he made his debut in the title role of Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot; in Berlin, as well as Don Carlo in &quot;Ernani&quot; in New York and the title role of &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot; in Los Angeles.

On 13 June 2018, Plácido Domingo performed at the 2018 FIFA World Cup opening gala concert in Moscow held at the Red Square in Moscow, with Anna Netrebko, Juan Diego Florez and Aida Garifullina and the Mariinsky Theatre Orchestra conducted by Valery Gergiev.

==Family and personal life==
Domingo was born to Plácido Francisco Domingo Ferrer (8 March 1907 – 22 November 1987) and Josefa &quot;Pepita&quot; Embil Echániz (28 February 1918 – 28 August 1994), two Spanish zarzuela stars who nurtured his early musical abilities. Domingo&#x27;s father was half Aragonese and half Catalan, while his mother was a Basque from Gipuzkoa. His father began as a violinist performing for opera and zarzuela orchestras. He soon also took on baritone roles in zarzuelas. Even though he damaged his voice by performing while suffering from a cold, he continued singing into the 1970s. Domingo&#x27;s mother was an established soprano who made her stage debut at the Gran Teatre del Liceu in Barcelona. She met her husband at age 21 while performing in Federico Moreno Torroba&#x27;s &quot;Sor Navarra&quot;. Domingo later recalled that experts encouraged his father to sing Wagnerian heldentenor roles, while the Liceu offered his mother a contract to sing opera. In 1946 Moreno Torroba and Domingo&#x27;s parents formed a zarzuela company and toured in Latin America. His parents later stayed permanently in Mexico and established their own zarzuela troupe, the Domingo-Embil Company. In addition to their son, they also had a daughter, Maria José &quot;Mari Pepa&quot; Domingo de Fernandez (1942–2015).
On 29 August 1957 at age 16, Domingo married a fellow piano student, Ana María Guerra Cué (1938–2006). Their son, José Plácido Domingo Guerra (called &quot;Pepe&quot; as a boy and later &quot;Joe&quot;), now a photographer, was born on 16 June 1958. However, the marriage did not last long, with the couple separating shortly thereafter. On 1 August 1962, Domingo married Marta Ornelas (born 1935), a lyric soprano from Veracruz, Mexico, whom he met during his conservatory days. In the same year, Marta had been voted &quot;Mexican Singer of the Year&quot;. After their wedding, the couple performed together frequently at the Israel National Opera. However, after she became pregnant with her first child, she gave up her promising career to devote time to her family. They have two sons, Plácido Francisco (known as Plácido Domingo Jr.), born 21 October 1965, and Alvaro Maurizio, born 11 October 1968.

After a period of time living in Israel, Domingo and his growing family moved to Teaneck, New Jersey, in the 1960s. He later acquired residences in Manhattan and Barcelona. Keeping his apartment in New York, he currently also has a house in his native Madrid. During breaks in his work schedule, he usually spends time with family at his vacation home in Acapulco, Mexico.

In March 2010 he underwent surgery for colon cancer. In July 2013, he was admitted to a hospital in Madrid after suffering a pulmonary embolism. He was released on 14 July, and was &quot;expected to make a full recovery&quot;. In October 2015, he was admitted to a hospital for a cholecystectomy and missed the first five performances of &quot;Tosca&quot; he was supposed to conduct at the Metropolitan Opera.

==Sexual harassment allegations==
In August 2019, Domingo was accused of sexual harassment by multiple female colleagues, some dating back as far as 30 years. However, no official charges were ever filed, nor were there any court proceedings or convictions. Nonetheless, Domingo subsequently resigned from his position as general manager of the Los Angeles Opera, saying he did so with a &quot;heavy heart&quot;, but in light of the recent allegations against him, he said the move was in the best interest for the opera company.

In late February 2020, Domingo apologized to any colleagues who felt uncomfortable or in any way hurt by his comments or actions. He reiterated that it was never his intention to hurt or offend anyone, saying, &quot;I have never behaved aggressively toward anyone, and I have never done anything to hinder or harm anyone&#x27;s career in any way. On the contrary, I have spent much of my half-century in the opera world supporting the industry and furthering the careers of countless singers.&quot;

The investigation launched by the Los Angeles Opera into the incidents at the house &quot;deemed the allegations to be credible, in part because of the similarities in their accounts&quot;. The investigation &quot;often found him to be sincere in his denials but found some of them to be less credible or lacking in awareness&quot;. However, Gibson Dunn &quot;found no evidence that Mr. Domingo ever engaged in a quid pro quo or retaliated against any woman by not casting or otherwise hiring her at LA Opera, especially since casting and other hiring decisions are complex, performance-specific and determined by multiple people.&quot; The investigation criticized inadequate communication and lack of awareness about sexual harassment at the opera.

In his first interview since recovering from COVID-19, Domingo told the Italian newspaper &quot;La Repubblica&quot; that the charges were false. &quot;When I knew that I had COVID, I promised myself that if I came out alive, I would fight to clear my name&quot;, Domingo said. &quot;I never abused anyone. I will repeat that as long as I live.&quot;

==Recordings==
===Complete operas and recital discs===
Domingo has made over 200 recordings, most of which are full-length operas; he has recorded nearly all of opera&#x27;s leading tenor roles, several of them more than once. As a teenager, he first appeared in very small parts on the Spanish-language original cast versions of the musicals &quot;My Fair Lady&quot; (1959) and &quot;Redhead&quot; (1960). In 1968, he released his first solo album, &quot;Recital of Italian Operatic Arias&quot; (also known as &quot;Bel Canto Domingo&quot;). The album, conducted by Nello Santi, received the Grand Prix du Disque. In 1969, Domingo&#x27;s first recital album for RCA Red Seal was issued, and he recorded his first complete opera in the studio, &quot;Il trovatore&quot;, with Leontyne Price and Sherrill Milnes also for RCA, which would be his primary record label throughout the entire 1970s; RCA recorded Domingo, Milnes and Price together several more times, both in complete operas and recital discs. Domingo followed &quot;Il trovatore&quot; with a steady stream of complete recorded operas from the 1970s through the early years of the next century. Starting with &quot;Il tabarro&quot; in 1970, &quot;Les Troyens&quot; 1983 and ending with &quot;Edgar&quot; in 2006, Domingo has recorded all of Puccini&#x27;s operatic roles for tenor. Among his albums is a box set of every major tenor aria Verdi composed, including several obscure and rarely performed versions in languages different from the original operas, and written only for specific performances. He has also recorded the vocal parts in many symphonic works and has conducted on some of his albums.

In August 2005, EMI Classics released a highly anticipated and publicized studio recording of Richard Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Tristan und Isolde&quot;, in which Domingo and Operalia winner Nina Stemme sang the title roles. A review, headlined &quot;Vocal perfections&quot;, in the 8 August 2005 issue of &quot;The Economist&quot; called the recording &quot;monumental&quot; and praised it for having &quot;a musical lyricism and a sexual passion that make the cost and the effort entirely worthwhile&quot;. The review also characterized Domingo&#x27;s July 2005 performance of Siegmund in Wagner&#x27;s &quot;Die Walküre&quot; at Covent Garden as &quot;unforgettable&quot; and &quot;luminous&quot;. More recently Domingo has appeared with Angela Gheorghiu on a recording of &quot;Fedora&quot;, an opera in which he often appeared onstage, and as the baritone in a live version of &quot;Giovanna d&#x27;Arco&quot; with Anna Netrebko. In September 2011, aged 70, he signed an exclusive record contract with Sony Classics.

===Crossover albums===
In addition to his classical recordings, Domingo has released numerous crossover albums. His output of non-operatic recordings accelerated after his pop album, &quot;Perhaps Love&quot; (1981), went gold and eventually platinum. His other recordings of popular music include &quot;My Life for a Song&quot; (1983), &quot;Save Your Nights for Me&quot; (1985), and the British gold record, &quot;Be My Love&quot; (1990). His English-language version of &quot;Bésame Mucho&quot; from &quot;My Life for a Song&quot; received a Grammy nomination for Best Latin Pop Performance in 1984. The following year he won a Grammy in the same category for his collection of Ernesto Lecuona songs, &quot;Always in My Heart&quot; (&quot;Siempre en mi corazón&quot;). (He won a second Grammy the same year for &quot;Carmen&quot; under the baton of Lorin Maazel.) In 2012, he recorded &quot;Songs&quot; with Josh Groban, Susan Boyle, and jazz singer Harry Connick, Jr., among others. In 2015, he released a holiday album, &quot;My Christmas&quot; including duets with Idina Menzel, Jackie Evancho, Plácido Domingo Jr., The Piano Guys and others.

Since the early 1980s, Domingo has released several Latin albums, including two featuring the music of Mexican songwriter, Agustín Lara. He devoted two more of his albums, &quot;Adoro&quot; (1982) and &quot;100 años de Mariachi&quot; (1999), solely to Mexican music. &quot;100 años de Mariachi&quot;, a rancheras collection, went platinum in the United States and gold in Mexico. He later recalled that, as a fan of mariachi music since boyhood, the Grammy he won for &quot;100 años de Mariachi&quot; was the award that meant the most to him of all he has received.

==Appearances on film and television==
Domingo has starred in several opera films. His three theatrical released opera movies from the 1980s received significant awards and recognitions, including Golden Globe and BAFTA nominations for Best Foreign Language Film. Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;La Traviata&quot; and &quot;Otello&quot; both received Academy Award nominations, and the soundtracks of &quot;La Traviata&quot; and Rosi&#x27;s &quot;Carmen&quot; won Grammy Awards for the Best Opera Recording of the year. Domingo has also made various opera films for television, including Jean-Pierre Ponnelle&#x27;s &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot; with Mirella Freni, Gianfranco de Bosio&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; with Raina Kabaivanska, Giuseppe Patroni Griffi&#x27;s &quot;Tosca&quot; with Catherine Malfitano (Emmy Award), Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;Cavalleria rusticana&quot; and &quot;Pagliacci&quot;, and more recently, Marco Bellocchio&#x27;s &quot;&quot;.

Over the course of decades, he has sung in numerous &quot;Live from the Metropolitan Opera&quot; telecasts and Met radio broadcasts. He has also appeared often in televised performances from other opera houses. In 1978, he starred in the La Scala production of Puccini&#x27;s &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot; that marked the house debut of Hungarian soprano Sylvia Sass. In addition, many of his concerts and zarzuela evenings have been televised. Beyond his filmed opera and concert performances, he has frequently made guest appearances on television. Domingo appeared on &quot;The Cosby Show&quot; Season 5 as Alberto Santiago, a colleague of Dr. Cliff Huxtable. In 1989, the international television series &quot;Return Journey&quot; featured Domingo returning to his home city of Madrid reflecting on life there whilst recording an album of Zarzuela arias for EMI. On the 1993 Academy Awards telecast, he performed the song, &quot;Beautiful Maria of My Soul,&quot; from the movie &quot;The Mambo Kings&quot;, which had received a nomination for Best Original Song. The tenor was the first Spaniard to perform at an Academy Awards ceremony. He had previously presented the Oscar for Best Foreign Language Film with Faye Dunaway at the 57th Academy Awards in 1985.

Domingo was the executive producer of the critically acclaimed 1998 Mexican film &quot;The Other Conquest&quot;, produced by his son Alvaro and directed by Salvador Carrasco, in which Domingo also sang the original aria &quot;Mater Aeterna&quot;, composed by Samuel Zyman with lyrics by Carrasco. He was also heard performing the song &quot;In Pace&quot;, during the closing credits of Kenneth Branagh&#x27;s &quot;Hamlet&quot; (1996). In 2008, Domingo provided the voice of the long-haired Chihuahua named Montezuma in Disney&#x27;s &quot;Beverly Hills Chihuahua&quot;. He also appeared as Manolo&#x27;s great-grandfather in the animated film &quot;The Book of Life&quot; in 2014.

===&quot;Christmas in Vienna&quot;===
In December 1992, Domingo collaborated with fellow operatic tenor and friend José Carreras and pop music legend Diana Ross in a televised Christmas-themed concert. Vienna was chosen to host the event due to its reputation as a capital of music and the particular charm of Austria during Christmas time. The Wiener Symphoniker under the direction of maestro Vjekoslav Šutej provided the orchestral music, and the Gumpoldskirchen Children&#x27;s Choir provided choral vocals. On 23 December 1992, the first in what would turn out to be a series of &quot;Christmas in Vienna&quot; concerts was seen worldwide by several hundred million people. Plácido Domingo returned to Vienna for many more &quot;Christmas in Vienna&quot; concerts, performing with stars and friends of both pop and classical music, including Dionne Warwick, Charles Aznavour, Sissel Kyrkjebø, Michael Bolton, Sarah Brightman, Charlotte Church, Natalie Cole, Riccardo Cocciante, Patricia Kaas, Luciano Pavarotti, Tony Bennett and others.

==Cultural references==

By the 1980s and 1990s, popular cultural forms, especially television programs, began to reference Domingo, often as a prototypical opera singer or as part of the influential Three Tenors. In 1987 &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, a U.S. children&#x27;s television show that has been on the air since 1969, introduced a puppet character named after Domingo. In the series, Placido Flamingo was a pink singing bird who appeared regularly on &quot;Live from the Nest&quot; (a play on &quot;Live from the Met&quot;) telecasts from the Nestropolitan Opera. In the 1989 special &quot;Sesame Street... 20 Years &amp; Still Counting&quot;, Domingo appeared with his namesake puppet, singing &quot;Look through the Window&quot; together. The show never revived the character after the puppeteer, Richard Hunt, who provided the voice for Placido Flamingo, died in early 1992. Similarly, in the 2009 Australian-Canadian cartoon comedy &quot;Pearlie&quot;, the father of a family of opera singing fleas is named Placido. Although not opera related, one of the Three Emperors (a take-off on the Three Tenors) in the original Japanese version of the anime series, &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh! 5D&#x27;s&quot; (2008-2011), is also named after the singer.

In 2007, Domingo had a cameo role on &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, the longest running American scripted prime time television series and winner of over thirty Emmy Awards. He provided the voice for an animated version of himself in the episode &quot;The Homer of Seville&quot;, which revolves around Homer Simpson becoming an opera singer. After an opera performance, Homer chats with Domingo, who tells him to call him &quot;P. Dingo&quot; (a play on &quot;P. Diddy&quot;) and asks him for singing advice. Although not providing voice-overs, he was also an animated character in a 1995 episode (&quot;Three Tenors and You&#x27;re Out&quot;) of the Warner Brothers children&#x27;s cartoon, &quot;Animaniacs&quot;, and a 1999 episode (&quot;Censoring Problems: The Three Stooges vs. The Three Tenors&quot;) of MTV&#x27;s violent comedy, &quot;Celebrity Deathmatch&quot;.

Domingo, along with Luciano Pavarotti and José Carreras, loosely inspired the 2001 biting English-language film, &quot;Off Key&quot;, by Spanish director Manuel Gómez Pereira. The movie&#x27;s leading character, Ricardo Palacios (played by Joe Mantegna), is a Spanish tenor with vague ties to Mexico, who plays the piano, conducts, seeks celebrity outside of the opera world, and is proud of his Otello. Like Domingo, he discovers new operatic talents, sings duets with pop singers, and performs mariachi music and tangos. The farcical plot, however, has nothing in common with actual occurrences in the lives of Domingo or his colleagues. The movie was the most expensive production in Spain&#x27;s cinematic history to that point.

American author Elizabeth George references Domingo in one of her series of mystery novels about the fictional Inspector Lynley, &quot;This Body of Death&quot; (2010). In the book, Meredith&#x27;s young daughter is an enthusiastic fan of Plácido Domingo and has the detective read to her from an unauthorized biography of the singer. The real-life Domingo was also mentioned as part of a running gag on the 1996 &quot;Seinfeld&quot; episode, &quot;The Doll&quot;. &quot;Seinfeld&quot; was the second highest rated series on U.S. television at the time. He was also referenced several times throughout the sitcom series &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot; as Raymond&#x27;s mother, Marie&#x27;s, favorite opera singer. In addition, the tenor has appeared on the cover of several opera-related books, as a key representative of the musical genre. Such mainstream allusions to Domingo illustrate his atypically widespread fame and cultural influence as an opera singer. His integration both as an actual performer and as an &quot;image&quot; into popular as well as high culture was so significant by 2011, Spanish author Rubén Amón wrote a book, &quot;Plácido Domingo: Un coloso en el teatro del mundo&quot;, specifically analyzing the singer as a cultural and sociological phenomenon.

==Repertoire==
Domingo has sung 151 roles in Italian, French, German, English, Spanish and Russian. His main repertoire however is Italian (&quot;Otello&quot;; Cavaradossi in &quot;Tosca&quot;; &quot;Don Carlo&quot;; Des Grieux in &quot;Manon Lescaut&quot;; Dick Johnson in &quot;La fanciulla del West&quot;; Radames in &quot;Aida&quot;); French (Don José in &quot;Carmen&quot;; Samson in &quot;Samson and Delilah&quot;; Énée in &quot;Les Troyens;&quot; Hoffmann in &quot;Les Contes d&#x27;Hoffmann&quot;); and German (&quot;Lohengrin&quot;, &quot;Parsifal&quot;, and Siegmund in &quot;Die Walküre&quot;). He has appeared in more operas by Giuseppe Verdi than any other composer. Domingo has created original roles in eight world premieres of operas, Vásquez&#x27;s &quot;El último sueño&quot;, Moreno Torroba&#x27;s &quot;El poeta&quot;, Menotti&#x27;s &quot;Goya&quot;, García Abril&#x27;s &quot;Divinas palabras&quot;, Cano&#x27;s &quot;Luna&quot;, Drattell&#x27;s &quot;Nicholas and Alexandra&quot;, Tan Dun&#x27;s &quot;The First Emperor&quot;, and Catán&#x27;s &quot;Il Postino&quot;, as well as one &quot;pasticcio&quot;, &quot;The Enchanted Island&quot;. He also performed in the U.S. premieres of &quot;Don Rodrigo&quot; and &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;. He continues to add more roles to his repertoire, most recently performing as Schicchi in Puccini&#x27;s one-act opera &quot;Gianni Schicchi&quot; in September 2015.

After taking on baritone roles, he sang Conte Di Luna in &quot;Il Trovatore&quot;, an opera in which he previously performed as Manrico, a tenor role. His last major role in a full-length opera was in the title role of &quot;Nabucco&quot; in the production by Thaddeus Strassberger in December 2019 in Valencia. During the curtain call many supporters of the singer showed support by dropping flyers in support of the singer.

==Awards and honors==
Plácido Domingo has received many awards and honors for his achievement in the field of music and in recognition of his many benefit concerts and contributions to various charities. In 1978, when Domingo was only 37, the city of Madrid dedicated a commemorative plaque at his birthplace at 34 Calle Ibiza near the Buen Retiro Park.

The singer won his first Grammy Award in 1971 and has gone on to win eight more, as well as five Latin Grammy awards including an award for Latin Recording Academy Person of the Year.

A Kammersänger of the Vienna State Opera and the recipient of numerous honorary doctorates, he has received other major awards that include being made an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2002.

In 2006, he received the Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music.

He has also received the Austrian Cross of Honour for Science and Art, 1st class (1992); Grand Decoration of Honour in Silver for Services to the Republic of Austria (2007); Commander of the French Légion d&#x27;honneur; Mexican Order of the Aztec Eagle; Spanish Prince of Asturias Award for Arts (1991); the United States Presidential Medal of Freedom; and in 2011, a Medal of Honour from Sultan Qaboos bin Said of Oman. The first Birgit Nilsson Prize was awarded to him in 2009.

In 2012, Domingo was voted into Gramophone&#x27;s first Hall of Fame.

In April 2014, Domingo was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Music degree by Berklee College of Music at its campus in Valencia, Spain. During his acceptance speech, Domingo said, &quot;it is a great pleasure to have a connection between Boston and Valencia since both have been so important in my career.&quot; Domingo sang Handel&#x27;s Messiah with the Boston Symphony Orchestra at the beginning of his career, and performed his first &quot;Bohéme&quot; at the Palau de les Arts.

In June 2018, Iberia Airlines honored Domingo by placing his name on their first Airbus A350 delivered to the Airline.

==Humanitarian works and initiatives==
Domingo has been heavily involved in humanitarian efforts and volunteerism. He has given many benefit concerts for disaster relief, charities, and musical organizations, as well as served in various voluntary positions in the artistic and sports worlds. In 1986, Domingo performed at several benefit concerts to raise funds for the victims of the 1985 Mexico City earthquake. He also released an album of one of the events for charity. On 21 August 2007, in recognition of his support of the earthquake victims, as well as his artistic works, a statue in his honor was unveiled. It was made in Mexico City from keys donated by the people. The statue, the work of Alejandra Zúñiga, is two meters tall, weighs about 300 kg (660 lbs) and is part of the &quot;Grandes valores&quot; (Great values) program.

Since the earthquake, Domingo has continued to do charitable work in Mexico and other countries. After Hurricane Pauline ravaged the Pacific coast of Southern Mexico in 1997, he gave two charity concerts in Acapulco to raise money to build 150 new houses for those made homeless by the storm. In December 2003, he performed in Cancún to benefit the Ciudad de la Alegria Foundation, which provides assistance and lodging to people in need, including low-income individuals, orphans, expectant mothers, immigrants, rehabilitated legal offenders, and the terminally ill. Outside of Mexico, Domingo and Katherine Jenkins performed in a charity concert in Athens on 27 June 2007 to raise funds to aid victims of the conflict in Darfur. The concert was organized by Médecins Sans Frontières (Doctors Without Borders).

On 4 March 2006, Domingo sang at the New Orleans Opera Association&#x27;s Gala Benefit Concert, &quot;A Night For New Orleans&quot;, to help rebuild the city after it was partially destroyed by Hurricane Katrina. Before the gala, he made the encouraging statement: &quot;MUSIC IS THE VOICE OF HOPE!&quot;. Operalia winner Elizabeth Futral and several other popular opera singers appeared with the tenor. The Gala collected $700,000 for the city recovery fund. On 23 March 2008, the New Orleans City Council named the city theatre&#x27;s stage in the Mahalia Jackson Theatre in Louis Armstrong Park the &quot;Plácido Domingo stage&quot;, in honour of his contribution at the Gala Benefits Concert. Early the following year, Domingo performed with the New Orleans Opera in a gala reopening the theatre. At the time he told the press, &quot;The restoration of New Orleans&#x27; Mahalia Jackson Theater is a symbol of new life for the city following the devastation of 2005, but in these difficult economic times, it is also a symbol of hope and faith in the future on the part of a forward-looking artistic organization.&quot;

In June 2010 Domingo became President of Europa Nostra, the Voice of Cultural Heritage in Europe, which helps to promote European high culture. The following year, FIFA president Sepp Blatter invited Domingo to join a council intended to clean up the football governing body, which had been accused of taking bribes from countries that wanted to stage the World Cup. Domingo has also supported environmental efforts. In 2007, he joined several other preeminent figures in entertainment, government, the environment and more, as one of the users of the BMW Hydrogen 7, designed to build support for hydrogen as a viable alternative to fossil fuels. Domingo also supports the Hear the World initiative as an ambassador to raise awareness for the topic of hearing and hearing loss.

===Operalia and young artists programs===
Domingo has especially tried to aid the development of young opera singers&#x27; careers. In 1993 he founded Operalia, The World Opera Competition, an international opera competition for talented young singers. The winners get the opportunity to be employed in opera ensembles around the world.

Several leading opera singers of recent years have won prizes in the competition, including Joseph Calleja, Joyce DiDonato, Erwin Schrott, Giuseppe Filianoti, Angel Blue, Aida Garifullina, Sonya Yoncheva, Ana María Martínez, Nina Stemme and José Cura. In particular, Domingo has performed frequently with Mexican tenor Rolando Villazón, who won three prizes at the 1999 Operalia competition.

Beyond Operalia, Domingo has been instrumental in giving many young artists encouragement and special attention, as in 2001, when he invited the so-called &quot;Singing Policeman&quot;, New York tenor Daniel Rodríguez, to attend the Vilar-Domingo Young Artists program to develop his operatic skills.

In addition to the Vilar-Domingo Young Artists Program in Washington, D.C., Domingo has also started programs to train young opera singers at the Los Angeles Opera and the Palau de les Arts Reina Sofia in Valencia, Spain.

In September 2016, he performed at a Los Angeles benefit for the Esperanza Azteca Los Angeles Youth Orchestra supporting young musicians from the Los Angeles area.

<doc id="261660" wikidata="Q739771" url="?curid=261660" title="Hoth">
<text>Hoth is an ice planet in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; fictional universe. It first appeared in the 1980 film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot; and has also been a setting in &quot;Star Wars&quot; books and video games.

==Description==
Hoth is the sixth planet of a remote system of the same name. It is a small, terrestrial planet with three orbiting moons and blanketed entirely by snow and ice. The freezing climate, although habitable, is mostly too cold for intelligent life to develop. Hoth is home to only a few species, including the towering, predatory wampa, which is the most intelligent creature on the planet, and the gray snow-lizards known as tauntauns. Both appear in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;.

==Appearances==

===Film===
In the 1980 film &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, Hoth is the home of the Rebel Alliance&#x27;s secret Echo Base, which is partially installed in natural caves formed by giant ice bubbles. The Rebels patrol the planet by riding indigenous tauntauns. At the start of the film, Luke Skywalker and his tauntaun are attacked by a wampa. Skywalker eventually escapes and is rescued by Han Solo. When one of the Galactic Empire&#x27;s probe droids uncovers the base, the Rebels are forced to evacuate. The Empire arrives and deploys ground forces to destroy the base, but the Rebels battle the AT-ATs with ground artillery and snowspeeders to stall them and effectively evacuate. This conflict is commonly referred to as the &quot;Battle of Hoth&quot;.

The original draft of &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;, written by Leigh Brackett, depicted an opening scene with Luke Skywalker on the ridge of an ice planet, though the name &quot;Hoth&quot; was given to the cloud planet at the time (later called Bespin). The draft also depicted Hoth&#x27;s wampas attacking the Rebel base.

The Hardangerjøkulen glacier near Finse, Norway, served as the filming location for Hoth in &quot;The Empire Strikes Back&quot;. Scenes were filmed in subzero temperatures. For the ground battle scene, miniatures were used on a set that used microscopic glass bubbles and baking soda to mimic the snowy territory.

===&quot;Legends&quot;===

Hoth has also appeared in &quot;Star Wars&quot; comics, books, and video games. In the 1983 Marvel &quot;Star Wars&quot; comic &quot;Hoth Stuff!&quot;, it is revealed that Wedge Antilles went missing during the Battle of Hoth. In the novel &quot;Darksaber&quot; (1995), Luke Skywalker and his lover Callista Ming travel to Hoth, where they encounter the same wampa that attacked Luke in &quot;Empire&quot;, but he swiftly kills it. In &quot;Shadows of the Empire&quot;, Hoth is one of several settings for Dash Rendar&#x27;s adventures, including the Battle of Hoth.

===Video games===
The planet appears in the &quot;Star Wars: Battlefront&quot; series (2004–) as multiplayer maps, and in the Lego-themed games &quot;Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy&quot; (2006) and &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga&quot; (2007) during the first two-story levels of &quot;Episode V&quot;. It also appears as an explorable hub world in the 2022 game &quot;Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga&quot;.

==Scientific accuracy==

The planetary attributes of the fictional planet Hoth have been scrutinized for scientific accuracy. Space.com said Hoth most resembled the extrasolar planet OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb, &quot;With a surface temperature of , it is nearly as frigid as Pluto.&quot; Bruce Betts of The Planetary Society said the asteroid belt near Hoth meant that the planet would have difficulty staying in place. With Hoth being bombarded frequently by asteroids, Betts said it would be unlikely for natural lifeforms (like the wampa and the tauntaun shown in the film) to evolve on the planet.

Jeanne Cavelos theorized in &quot;The Science of Star Wars&quot; that the frequency of meteoroids bombarding Hoth indicated that the planet was relatively young since in older solar systems, the debris is more cleared out. Since Hoth has complex lifeforms, Cavolos said the planet&#x27;s age may be older, in the range of several billion years. The author said Hoth could be similar to Earth in age but lack neighboring planets like Jupiter and Saturn to shelter it from meteoroid impacts. She also said with the asteroid belt depicted in the film as close to Hoth that the belt was a likely source for meteoroids. (The asteroid belt itself is unrealistically depicted as being closely clustered, which would normally mean that the asteroids would be reduced to sand-sized rubble over a long enough timespan.)

CJ Miozzi, writing for &quot;The Escapist&quot;, said that Hoth was realistic as a single-biome planet (among numerous such planets in &quot;Star Wars&quot;), citing Jupiter&#x27;s moon Europa as a similar example. Miozzi said the planet was depicted in the &quot;Star Wars&quot; books as being geologically active and having additional smaller lifeforms, including lichen. The author said lichen on Earth was an important part of the food chain during winter months but that it could grow back outside these months. With Hoth perpetually iced over, Miozzi said lichen likely would not be sufficient to support a multi-tiered food chain that includes an apex predator, the wampa.

==Theme park attraction==
Hoth appears in the theme park attraction Star Tours - The Adventures Continue in Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios in Walt Disney World Resort in Orlando, Florida and Disneyland Park in Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California.

<text>Thapsus, also known as Tampsus and as Thapsus Minor to distinguish it from Thapsus in Sicily, was a Carthaginian and Roman port near present-day Bekalta, Tunisia.

==Geography==
Thapsus was established on Ras ed-Dimas, an easily defended promontory on Tunisia&#x27;s Mediterranean coast. It was near a salt lake. It was about from the island of Lampedusa and approximately southeast of Carthage.

== History ==
Thapsus was founded by the Phoenicians. It served as a waypoint on the trade routes between the Strait of Gibraltar and Phoenicia and as a market for the inland products of the area.
Diodorus Siculus write that Agathocles of Syracuse conquered the city.

During his civil war, Julius Caesar defeated Metellus Scipio and the Numidian king JubaI at the costly 46BC Battle of Thapsus. Caesar exacted a payment of sesterces from the vanquished. The victory marked the end of opposition against him in Africa. Thapsus subsequently became a Roman colony in the province of Byzacena. The town&#x27;s enormous mole may have been begun by the local emperors , II, and III, but their reigns were too brief to have finished the work. The construction may have been abandoned partway through; Thapsus was never known as a world-class port and, after the collapse of Thysdrus in the 3rd century, all the area&#x27;s maritime trade is known to have occurred through the harbors at Sullecthum, Thaenae, Leptis, and Gummi.

== Remains ==
Thapsus&#x27;s surviving ruins include an amphitheatre and various mosaics. Thapsus was the site of one of the Roman Empire&#x27;s greatest harbor moles, a huge concrete and stone breakwater extending almost a kilometer from shore; only the first hundred or so meters, however, remain above water.

== Religion ==
In antiquity, Thapsus was a Christian bishopric. It was probably a suffragan but no metropolitan is known. The only known bishop was Vigilius, the author of several controversial works against the Arians and the Eutychians. He was one of the Catholic bishops whom king Hunneric of the Vandals summoned to his court in Carthage in 484 and then exiled.

The Catholic Church reëstablished it in 1914 as a titular see. It is a Latin title of the lowest rank, with one archiepiscopal exception.

<text>Skywalker Ranch is a movie ranch and the workplace of film director, writer and producer George Lucas located in a secluded area near Nicasio, California, in Marin County. The ranch is located on Lucas Valley Road, named after an early-20th-century landowner in the area of no relation to George Lucas. The ranch is now open to the public.

== Overview ==
The principal operation of the facility is as a motion picture sound mixing and recording facility. Other Lucasfilm properties provide animation and visual effects; Skywalker handles sound, music, and allied services.

In September 1978, George Lucas purchased the first parcel of land, and named it Bulltail Ranch, which in subsequent years became Skywalker Ranch. Lucasfilm acquired 3,000 acres (1,200 ha) of adjoining land for a total of over 4,700 acres (1,900 ha). Only 15 acres (6.1 ha) have been developed. Residents of the area have fought his plan to build a larger studio on the property, citing light and noise pollution.
The Ranch contains a barn with animals, vineyards, a garden with fruits and vegetables used in the on-site restaurant, an outdoor swimming pool and fitness center with racquetball courts, the man-made &quot;Ewok Lake&quot;, a hilltop observatory, a 300-seat theater called &quot;The Stag&quot; as well as theater screening rooms, and parking that is mostly concealed underground to preserve the natural landscape. Skywalker Sound was moved onto the ranch in 1987, now occupying the Technical Building. The Main House has a company research library under a stained-glass dome. Skywalker Ranch has its own fire station; it is part of the Marin County mutual aid system and is often called on to assist firefighters in nearby Marinwood.

Skywalker Ranch is intended to be more of a &quot;filmmaker&#x27;s retreat&quot; than a headquarters for Lucas&#x27;s business operations. The headquarters of Lucasfilm, Industrial Light &amp; Magic, and LucasArts (now Lucasfilm Games) are located in Lucas&#x27;s Letterman Digital Arts Center in the Presidio of San Francisco. The George Lucas Educational Foundation is based at the Ranch. Skywalker Sound remains based at the Ranch, for which Lucasfilm pays a rental fee to George Lucas, who remains the property&#x27;s owner. Although Lucas maintains his offices there, he does not reside at the Ranch. Lucasfilm Games was located at the ranch during the early company years.

===Big Rock Ranch===

Big Rock Ranch is a later Lucasfilm development in Marin county at 3800 Lucas Valley Road adjacent to Skywalker Ranch. The county&#x27;s planning commission approved this facility in September 1996 and construction was completed in August 2002. However, in November 2004, Lucas announced that the 250 employees of the ranch were to be moved to the Letterman Digital Arts Center.

The ranch comprises 1,061 acres (429 ha), of which 43 acres (17 ha) are developed with 317,000 sq ft (29,500 m2) of office space. Before the move to the Presidio in 2005, Big Rock Ranch housed the marketing, licensing, distribution and online divisions of Lucasfilm. it was the headquarters of the animation division.
In 2018, Big Rock Ranch was renovated into an opulent, 56-room resort called &quot;Summit at Skywalker Ranch&quot;. The facility hosts exclusive corporate retreat events.

===Others===
Starting in 1988, Lucasfilm sought approval to develop another nearby property called Grady Ranch at 2400 Lucas Valley Road. The most recent proposals called for a digital film production center for the property. However, in the wake of delays caused by local resistance and environmental concerns, Lucas abandoned these plans in April 2012 and has instead decided to sell the land.

Lucas also owns McGuire Ranch (3801 Lucas Valley Road) and Loma Alta Ranch (4001 Lucas Valley Road) in Marin County.

<doc id="261665" wikidata="Q57150" url="?curid=261665" title="Hermann Hoth">
<text>Hermann Hoth (12 April 1885 – 25 January 1971) was a German army commander, war criminal, and author. He served as a high-ranking panzer commander in the Wehrmacht during World War II, playing a prominent role in the Battle of France and on the Eastern Front. Contemporaries and later historians consider Hoth one of the most talented armoured warfare commanders of the war. He was a strong believer in Nazism, and units under his command committed several war crimes including the murder of prisoners of war and civilians.

Born in Prussia, Hoth embarked on a career as a military officer early in his youth. After graduating from the Royal Prussian Military Academy, he slowly rose in the ranks of the Imperial German Army. Hoth mainly served in various staff positions in World War I, and after the conflict&#x27;s conclusion continued to do so in the armed forces of the newly formed Weimar Republic. Following Hitler&#x27;s seizure of control in Germany, Hoth began to rapidly rise in the ranks and became known as a proponent of motorization in the Wehrmacht.

When World War II broke out, Hoth successfully led the XV Army Corps during the German invasions of Poland and France. He commanded the 3rd Panzer Group during Operation Barbarossa in 1941, a position in which he assisted in the destruction of several Soviet armies. From October 1941, Hoth headed the 17th Army, a period during which he advocated for a war of annihilation against the Soviet Union, the merciless destruction of partisans, and the murder of Jews. In the Wehrmacht&#x27;s 1942 summer offensive, Hoth led the 4th Panzer Army and took part in the Battle of Stalingrad. When the German 6th Army was encircled at Stalingrad in November 1942, Hoth&#x27;s army group made an unsuccessful relief attempt. Afterwards, Hoth was involved in the Third Battle of Kharkov as well as the Battle of Kursk, while increasingly suffering from near-burnout. He led the German defense in eastern Ukraine during the Battle of the Dnieper, but was sacked by Adolf Hitler due to the surprise Soviet reconquest of Kiev in November 1943. For the rest of the war, he was mostly relegated to powerless positions.

After the war, Hoth was convicted of war crimes and crimes against humanity in the High Command Trial, mainly regarding his implementation of the criminal Commissar Order and the mistreatment of POWs as well as civilians. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison, but released on parole in 1954. Hoth subsequently became an author, writing about armoured warfare, the development of West Germany&#x27;s military, and in support of the myth of the clean Wehrmacht.

==Early life==
===Early career===
Born on 14 April 1885 in Neuruppin, Hoth grew up in Demmin which like Neuruppin was located in Prussia. His parents were Hermann Hoth, a Prussian staff officer surgeon, and Margarethe Hoth (née Hübener). He attended the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Demmin from 1894 to 1896, followed by the Cadet Corps at Potsdam, and the (Royal Prussian Military Academy) from 1900 to 1904. During his preparation and training to become an officer, Hoth developed what he later recognised was a strong authority bias, something that he did never entirely discard even after the conclusion of his education. The educators at the Cadet Corps also instilled monarchism and the rejection of social democracy in Hoth. He was commissioned as a in the Prussian Army in 1903, but his rise in the ranks was slow. He attended the Prussian Staff College from 1910 to 1913, where he learned Russian, and was appointed in 1912 and in 1914. At this point, he was working at the German General Staff. His first son, Hans Joachim, was born in 1913.

Hoth spent almost all of World War I as a staff officer on higher headquarters and only four weeks on the front line. As a result of his skill in Russian, he was assigned to the 8th Army on the Eastern Front in August 1914. In this role, he witnessed the 1914 Russian invasion of East Prussia. This campaign left a deep impact on Hoth, as he saw the Russians waging war with what he regarded as &quot;bestial cruelty&quot;. He served under Paul von Hindenburg during this period, including during the Battle of Tannenberg, and came to greatly admire his superior. In June 1916, he was moved to the Western Front. During the war, Hoth held positions at the German General Staff, various armies, and units, including the (air arm of the Imperial German Army). He was awarded both classes of the Iron Cross during the war.

When Germany surrendered in 1918 amid growing internal turmoil, Hoth felt more loyalty to Hindenburg than the newly formed democratic government in Berlin. In the German Revolution of 1918–1919, Hoth served as a officer and helped to put down left-wing uprisings at Halle. This period hardened his hatred for any form of Communism. Hoth also believed that the failure of the right-wing Kapp Putsch proved that the military had to prevent its misuse in politics. He also married Lola Schubering in 1918. Hoth&#x27;s second son, Hermann, was born in 1923.

He remained in the (the armed forces of the Weimar Republic) in the interwar period, serving at the organization department of the General Staff. He was promoted to &quot;Major&quot; in 1924. Three years later, Hoth was sent to the Soviet Union as part of secret military cooperation missions. In 1929, he was promoted to .

===Initial service under the Nazi regime===
In the 1920s, Hoth had little interest in the Nazi Party, and even regarded its activities as disruptive for the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. His views changed with the 1930 German federal election when the Nazi Party became the second-strongest political force. Hoth started to view Hitler&#x27;s nationalist ambitions with approval, and admired the Nazis&#x27; attention to workers which he viewed as unusual for a right-wing party. He was among the officers who were most favorably disposed toward Hitler&#x27;s seizure of control, regarding it as a chance to improve the military. Like several other Reichswehr officers such as Heinz Guderian and Georg-Hans Reinhardt, Hoth hoped that a Nazi-led government would allow him to push through his ideas in regards to greater motorization and armoured warfare. In the aftermath of the takeover, however, Hoth (by then promoted to &quot;Oberst&quot;) clashed with Nazi Party officials when he criticised the murder of Communists and Social Democrats in Braunschweig, resulting in his transfer to Lübeck.

According to his own account, Hoth studied the ideology of the Nazi Party in some depth over the next years; historian Johannes Hürter regarded this as quite unusual for higher-ranking German officers, most of whom believed that they could remain apolitical. Hoth generally approved of the aims and achievements of the Nazi Party, although he expressed some disquiet about the elimination of German Jews. In the end, however, he believed the fate of Jews to be less important than the elimination of Communism in Germany and the restoration of what he saw as Germany&#x27;s status as an equal in world affairs. In October 1932, he was appointed head of the 17th Infantry Regiment, and transferred to command the 6th Infantry Regiment in August 1933. He was promoted to &quot;Generalmajor&quot; in 1934. Following the reorganization of the German military into the Wehrmacht in 1935, Hoth was appointed to command the 18th Infantry Division. He was regarded as one of the most modern Wehrmacht officers at the time, advocating motorization and other modernization. He was promoted to &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; in 1936, followed by &quot;General der Infanterie&quot; two years later. In 1938, he led the 18th Infantry Division during the occupation of Sudetenland.

== World War II==
===Invasions of Poland and France===
Hoth was given command of the XV Motorised Corps in 1938, leading it in the invasion of Poland the following year. At the time, this corps included two &quot;light&quot; divisions which were mixed formations of tanks, infantry, and artillery. Convinced of Hitler&#x27;s capability as leader, Hoth believed the new war served a higher purpose and would decide the fate of the German people. Under Hoth&#x27;s command, the XV Motorised Corps initially encountered only light resistance and quickly advanced. By 4 September 1939, Hoth&#x27;s corps had routed three Polish divisions belonging to Operational Group Kielce and broke through towards the important industrial center of Kielce. Afterwards, Hoth&#x27;s XV Motorised Corps &quot;relentlessly hound[ed] Szylling&#x27;s Army Kraków to extinction&quot;. Historian Robert Forczyk described Hoth as a &quot;hard-charging&quot; commander during the invasion of Poland, and he received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross for his military achievements during this campaign. Hoth believed that the XV Motorised Corps, including its &quot;light&quot; divisions, had &quot;exceeded high expectations&quot; during the invasion of Poland. Despite this, his corps&#x27; light divisions were transformed into panzer divisions for the following Western campaign, possibly due to suffering &quot;unnecessarily high losses&quot;.

Hoth continued to lead the XV Army Corps during the invasion of France from May 1940. The initial German advance of &quot;Generaloberst&quot; Günther von Kluge&#x27;s 4th Army through the Ardennes was spearheaded by &quot;General der Panzertruppe&quot; Guderian&#x27;s XIX Motorised Corps on the left and Hoth&#x27;s corps on the right. Hoth&#x27;s corps consisted of the 5th and 7th Panzer Divisions, the latter commanded by &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Erwin Rommel. After moving through the Ardennes, Hoth was tasked with capturing crossings of the Meuse near Dinant. His forces quickly secured two bridgeheads across the river on 12/13 May, exploiting the disorganization and overextension of the local French Army units. Initially confined to the bridgeheads due to the resistance organized by the 102nd Fortress Division, the XV Motorised Corps broke through and was pushing into the French 9th Army&#x27;s left flank by 14/15 May. French counter-attacks near Maubeuge on 18 May temporarily threatened Hoth&#x27;s advance, but ultimately failed to stop the XV Motorised Corps, allowing it to capture Cambrai. Amid continuing Allied counter-attacks Hoth subsequently moved toward Arras which the Germans captured on 21 May. In the Battle of Dunkirk, Hoth&#x27;s corps broke through the British Expeditionary Force&#x27;s defensive line at La Bassée Canal on 27 May, thus assisting in encircling the French 1st Army under René Prioux at Lille.

On 6–7 June, Hoth&#x27;s divisions achieved a major breakthrough at Airaines and then Forges-les-Eaux, effectively splitting the French 10th Army into two parts. After capturing Airaines, soldiers of the XV Corps murdered French prisoners of war, mainly black colonial soldiers such as Charles N&#x27;Tchoréré. The German units, including XV Motorised Corps, exploited the breakthrough to occupy Rouen and encircle a large Allied force at Saint-Valery-en-Caux, capturing about 10,000 British soldiers. Afterwards, Hoth&#x27;s corps broke through Allied defensive lines at the Seine. He then split his forces in order to capture important locations in Brittany and Normandy, before advancing south to La Rochelle. His successes in France made Hoth one of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s most popular generals. He was promoted to &quot;Generaloberst&quot; in July 1940, as part of an &quot;orgy of promotions&quot; by Hitler.

===Operation Barbarossa===
==== Leading the 3rd Panzer Group ====

Hoth commanded the 3rd Panzer Group during Operation Barbarossa in 1941. This unit included the XXXIX Panzer Corps, LVII Panzer Corps, V Army Corps, and VI Army Corps which consisted of four Panzer divisions (7th, 12th, 19th, and 20th), three motorized divisions (14th, 20th, 18th), and four infantry divisions (5th, 6th, 26th, 35th). The 3rd Panzer Group fielded 626 tanks at the offensive&#x27;s start. In his diaries, Hoth expressed no doubts about or opposition to the invasion, mirroring the opinion of most high-ranking German commanders. From a moral and ideological standpoint, Hoth believed that Russia had been overtaken by &quot;Jewish Bolshevism&quot;, causing the country to turn away from its European heritage, transforming it into an expansionist, Asiatic, and despotic state as well as setting it on an unavoidable collision course with Germany. Hürter argued that Hoth&#x27;s beliefs showcased remarkable similarities with Hitler&#x27;s. Even after the war, Hoth continued to maintain that the invasion had been just based on these arguments. Despite his belief in the necessity of the invasion, Hoth had misgivings about its strategic planning and execution. He tried to convince his superior, &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Fedor von Bock, commander of Army Group Center, that the 3rd Panzer Group had to operate with greater flexibility and prepare to strike deeper into the Soviet Union than intended by the high command (OKH). Bock rebuffed these requests. Regardless of his misgivings, Hoth generally adhered to the decided-upon plans and Bock&#x27;s commands during the invasion. Researcher Robert Kirchubel described him as a &quot;team player&quot; and reliable in crisis situations during Operation Barbarossa.

In course of the early stages of Operation Barbarossa, Hoth&#x27;s 3rd Panzer Group broke through the Soviet border defenses with relative ease. Bock consequently released Hoth from the 9th Army, allowing him to operate more freely. Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Group and Hoth&#x27;s 3rd Panzer Group proceeded to encircle Minsk as part of Army Group Center&#x27;s operations, trapping 300,000 Red Army soldiers and capturing or destroying 2,500 tanks. At this point, Hoth again argued that the 3rd Panzer Group should move deeper into the Soviet territory and encircle more enemy troops before closing the pocket. This time he was supported by Bock, but they were overruled by the OKH. Alongside Guderian&#x27;s 2nd Panzer Group, Hoth then pushed further to attack Smolensk, believing that they had to continue their advance to not allow the Red Army to reorganize. Before reaching the city, the panzer groups of Guderian and Hoth had almost outrun their supply lines, but were able to keep moving thanks to captured Soviet fuel depots. Hoth split his force into two, and secured vital crossings of the Daugava river on 3–4 July. His panzer group then kept advancing between the Daugava and Dnieper, capturing Vitebsk. The breakthrough of Hoth&#x27;s 3rd Panzer Group at the Daugava-Dnieper line allowed for the encirclement of three Soviet armies.

As the Wehrmacht advanced, questions arose about the treatment of suspected Red Army soldiers or deserters in civilian clothing. Hoth ordered the 3rd Panzer Group&#x27;s officers to subject such individuals to a limited examination; if the officers concluded that the prisoners were Red Army soldiers, they were to be shot. Like all German armies on the Eastern Front, Hoth&#x27;s Panzer Group also implemented the Commissar Order. Following the war, Hoth was the only German general who admitted that he had agreed with the order, believing that the Soviet political commissars could not be regarded as regular soldiers. According to reports from subordinate units, the order was carried out on a widespread basis.

In mid-July 1941, the 3rd Panzer Group was subordinated to Army Group North to shore up the flanks and attempted to seize Velikie Luki. This was part of a larger operation aimed at seizing Leningrad. Hoth&#x27;s forces were driven back on 20 July when Red Army forces broke through the German lines, prompting criticism from Bock for unnecessarily striking out too far to the north east. In early August, Hitler ordered a southward diversion of the German advance at Bryansk to the objection of many leading German officers, including Hoth, who advocated for a continued direct drive to Moscow. In mid to late August, Hoth&#x27;s forces faced another setback owing to heavy losses and dispersal of efforts: facing the heavily reinforced Soviet 19th Army, he committed the 7th Panzer Division without infantry support, which resulted in what the historian David Stahel describes as a &quot;debacle&quot;. The division&#x27;s attack ran into fortified Soviet lines and was repulsed with the loss of 30 tanks. By September, the constant fighting had heavily depleted Hoth&#x27;s force, as the 3rd Panzer Group had only about 250 tanks remaining. Hoth&#x27;s panzer group subsequently assisted in Operation Typhoon, the offensive to capture Moscow. Stationed on the left flank, his force and the 9th Army were supposed to attack from Dukhovshchina toward Vyazma. As the plans for Operation Typhoon were discussed by the OKH and frontline commanders, Hoth argued for a delay of one day regarding the offensive, but was overruled.

At the start of Operation Typhoon, the 3rd Panzer Group made good progress, though was slowed down by Soviet air attacks and the worn-down state of some of its units. Hoth&#x27;s force and the 9th Army successfully captured two bridges across the Dnieper east of Kholm-Zhirkovsky and were just from Vyazma, close to achieving another encirclement, when they were stopped by counter-attacks ordered by General Ivan Konev on 3 October. The resulting fighting and the exhaustion of its fuel supplies pinned down the 3rd Panzer Group until 6 October, when Hoth was able to restart the advance and sealed the Vyazma-Bryansk pockets. He was then redirected north to capture Rzhev and Kalinin, even though this effectively removed the 3rd Panzer Group from the Battle of Moscow. Hitler and the OKH believed that the &quot;fatal blow&quot; to the Red Army had been already delivered at Vyazma-Bryansk, and hoped for more great encirclements.

==== Appointment as 17th Army commander ====
On 9 October, Hoth was appointed commander of the 17th Army in Ukraine. This army&#x27;s previous commander, Carl-Heinrich von Stülpnagel, had been criticized for his &quot;timid leadership&quot;, and the OKH deemed Hoth to be the right individual to get the 17th Army to advance more aggressively. This decision was motivated by the assessment of Army Group North commander Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb who had lauded Hoth as &quot;intelligent, deliberate, good mind for operational questions, leads very well&quot;, and &quot;suitable as an army commander&quot;. Even though the appointment as 17th Army head was a promotion, Hoth unsuccessfully asked to remain with the 3rd Panzer Group; Fedor von Bock also expressed his opposition, not wanting to lose an &quot;outstanding armoured commander&quot;. Upon moving to the 17th Army, Hoth ordered an advance against Lozova, taking it after two days of fighting. He then split the army to attack both Izium as well as Stalino. However, the German operations in the region slowed down due to bad weather and the widespread destruction of infrastructure, causing Hitler to order a focus on Kharkov. The 17th Army was supposed to help in this operation as well, forcing it to attack in three directions. Spread across a wide area, Hoth&#x27;s force also encountered heavy resistance as the Red Army mobilized about 150,000 workers to assist the defense of the Donbas. Though the 17th Army ultimately captured most of the middle Don, its advance was slow and costly. Eventually, Hoth argued for a pause of offensive operations due to logistical issues and the exhaustion of his troops.

Hoth was an active supporter of the war of annihilation (&quot;&quot;) against the Soviet Union, calling on his men to understand the need for &quot;harsh punishment of Jewry&quot;. Under Hoth&#x27;s command, units of the 17th Army took part in the hunt for and murder of Jews in its territory of control. He had a good working relationship with the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot; death squads, and provided them with even more support than Stülpnagel as they carried out mass murders in the 17th Army&#x27;s rear areas. In response to the issuance of the Severity Order by Walter von Reichenau, Hoth issued an order of the day in November 1941. The document began with a relatively lengthy discussion of history, decrying Jewish influence on Europe, before extolling recent German victories as part of a mission to &quot;save European culture from Asiatic barbarism&quot; and promising the impending collapse and complete &quot;annihilation&quot; of the Soviet Union, an &quot;enslaved and joyless country&quot;. Finally, he gave the following directive to troops under his command:

Hürter argued that this order reflected that Hoth was fully aware of the ongoing Holocaust, and evidently urged his troops to kill Jews not just due to their alleged support for anti-German elements, but also to prevent them from taking revenge in the future. According to researcher Linden Lyons, the order reflected Hoth&#x27;s &quot;obsequiousness&quot; to Hitler, a tendency to blame the German &quot;national trauma&quot; of World War I on Jewish Bolshevism, and an attempt to &quot;outdo&quot; the extremity of Reichenau&#x27;s order. Researcher and Manstein biographer Marcel Stein argued that the order as a whole &quot;can cast doubt upon Hoth&#x27;s sanity&quot; and was &quot;full of repetitive venom and hatred&quot;.

Based on his order&#x27;s reasoning and claiming that the Red Army was also operating with extreme brutality, Hoth additionally ordered the 17th Army&#x27;s soldiers to kill all suspected partisans. He advised subordinate officers to cultivate the growing hatred for Soviet troops among the common German soldiers. Hoth also ordered the shooting of any civilians encountered in the woods, as these could potentially support or be partisans. He also agreed with and ordered the mass requisitioning of food, despite causing starvation in occupied cities. In his diaries, Hoth expressed his belief that leniency was the main reason for resistance in the rear areas; accordingly the German security forces should exterminate any opposition without mercy. In December 1941, the &quot;Einsatzgruppen&quot;, namely &quot;Sonderkommando 4b&quot; and &quot;Einsatzkommando 6&quot;, initiated a series of massacres in the 17th Army&#x27;s rear areas in the Donbas, killing thousands of civilians. At the same time, Hoth moderated some of the most extreme orders from the OKH; for instance, he ordered his troops to not treat Ukraine as a colony, and to show local civilians some respect. Hoth believed that the Ukrainians would become part of the new order in Europe.

===Operations in 1942===
==== Soviet winter offensive and Case Blue ====
In early January 1942, Hoth became the acting commander of the entire Army Group South, just before the start of the Soviet winter offensives. In the Barvenkovo–Lozovaya offensive, the Red Army successfully drove the 17th Army back and created a bulge in the German frontline around Izium. Hoth&#x27;s requests to orderly retreat during this campaign were denied by Bock who had assumed control of Army Group South. As the Soviet military had greatly enlarged the Izium bridgehead by 25 January, Hoth told Bock that the 17th Army should focus on defending Dnipropetrovsk and that only two options remained to the German defenders: a &quot;desperate&quot; counter-attack to stop the Red Army from reaching Dnipropetrovsk or the &quot;quick&quot; shifting of troops from other areas to shore up the defenses along the bulge. Bock interpreted these proposals as Hoth threatening to move his entire army westward, and ordered him to remain where he was until reserves arrived. Concluding that Hoth and his staff were &quot;overtired&quot;, Bock also decided to temporarily transfer the 17th Army&#x27;s leadership to Paul Ludwig Ewald von Kleist. &quot;Less a prima donna than many German army commanders,&quot; Hoth did not oppose this change. Despite having been temporarily replaced, he avoided being sacked, and helped to stabilize the southern frontline after the Germans lost Rostov-on-Don. In the Second Battle of Kharkov during May 1942, Hoth initially led the 17th Army, but took over from General Richard Ruoff as commander of 4th Panzer Army on 15 May 1942.

As part of Case Blue, the German summer offensive in the southern Soviet Union, Hoth demonstrated &quot;great operational command skill&quot;. Under his leadership, the 4th Panzer Army initially broke through the Soviet defensive lines of the Bryansk Front at the start of Case Blue on 28 June 1942, making quick progress despite Soviet counter-attacks. The army reached the Don River and assaulted Voronezh by 5 July; Hoth&#x27;s force quickly secured most of the city. Significant pockets of resistance remained in the city, but Hitler ordered Hoth to keep advancing. The Soviet military responded by launching a counter-offensive led by Alexander Lizyukov to retake Voronezh. The OKH initially did not recognize that the 4th Panzer Army faced an entire Soviet tank army and several tank corps, and dismissed the counter-offensive as &quot;insignificant&quot;. The 4th Panzer Army was thus not properly reinforced, but Hoth was still able to organize an effective defense. By 15 July, the Soviet counter-offensive had been repulsed, and the 4th Panzer Army was advancing again.

Hoth and his force were subsequently redirected by Hitler to support Army Group A in the Donbas, disregarding the original plans of Case Blue in which the 4th Panzer Army would have continued to support the direct advance toward Stalingrad. Though the 4th Panzer Army and other German forces participating in this &quot;gambit&quot; were short on fuel at this time, the redirected attack initially met considerable success. Hoth&#x27;s force and the 1st Panzer Army encircled five Soviet armies west of Millerovo, but the pocket could not be contained and much of the Soviet force was able to retreat. Regardless of the result, this diversion of forces to assist Army Group A had greatly slowed down the direct German advance toward Stalingrad. Frustrated at this development, Hitler transferred the majority of Hoth&#x27;s force to help the 6th Army&#x27;s attempt to capture Stalingrad, leaving 4th Panzer Army with just two corps and some support forces. On 31 July, most of the remaining 4th Panzer Army was also reassigned to the 6th Army, though Hoth was ordered to leave one panzer corps behind in the south. This reorganization was received poorly by the 4th Panzer Army, as its members had expected to be used in the pursuit of Soviet forces over open terrain into the Caucasus instead of having to take part in urban warfare. On his part, Hoth reacted to the change of plans by working out an operation of the 4th Panzer Army to encircle Stalingrad.

Hoth&#x27;s tanks attempted to flank Stalingrad from the south-west through the Kalmyk Steppe, forcing the Soviet Stalingrad Front commander Andrey Yeryomenko to concentrate most of his forces to slow down the 4th Panzer Army. With his force being reduced to two corps and facing growing Soviet resistance, the advance of Hoth&#x27;s troops slowed down. The encirclement attempt had failed by 11 August, as Hoth had too few forces to overcome the increasingly effective Soviet defenses. Thus, the panzer army was redirected to take part in the direct attack on Stalingrad. From 17 August to 2 September, it advanced northward, helping to take off pressure from the 6th Army and breaking through several Soviet armies despite being weakened in manpower and tank numbers. By the time it fully linked up with the 6th Army and had reached Stalingrad&#x27;s outskirts, the 4th Panzer Army was a &quot;panzer army in name&quot; with just one weakened tank corps.

By mid-September, the 4th Panzer Army attacked Stalingrad&#x27;s concrete grain elevator; despite greatly outnumbering the defenders, the Germans only captured the location after an extended battle on 21 September. At this point, the Red Army was massing forces for large-scale counter-offensives. Most German generals believed the Soviet military to be close to exhaustion and only capable of one offensive, expected to target Army Group Centre. Hoth was one of the few German commanders who realized that a possible Soviet attack from south of Stalingrad could pose a grave threat to the 6th Army. His warnings regarding the 6th Army&#x27;s southern flank were largely ignored. In October, Hitler ordered Hoth to transfer his last full tank division to the 6th Army.

==== Operations Uranus, Winter Storm, and Little Saturn ====
By 12 November, Hoth had noticed that the Red Army was massing forces opposite 4th Panzer Army and concluded that the Soviet military was evidently not just improving its defenses. On 19 November 1942, the Soviet Operation Uranus began with a major attack on Romanian Third Army in the north. The Third Army was soon overrun, and the Germans responded by shifting forces from the south to reinforce their collapsing left flank. This left their southern flank even more exposed. The Red Army subsequently attacked south of Stalingrad, breaking through Axis lines as Hoth attempted to muster a defense. Even his own headquarters came under threat, and 4th Panzer Army was forced to withdraw. As the Soviet troops advanced and threatened to encircle the 6th Army, Hitler ordered it to &quot;stand firm&quot; with Hoth being assigned to assist Paulus in keeping the railway lines open. By late November, however, the 6th Army was trapped in Stalingrad, as was half of Hoth&#x27;s 4th Panzer Army.

Outside the pocket, the remainder of the 4th Panzer Army and the Romanian VI and VII Corps were designated &quot;Army Group Hoth&quot; and attempted to slow the Red Army&#x27;s advance north of Kotelnikovo. Hoth subsequently worked out a plan for the 4th Panzer Army to relieve the 6th Army, called Operation Winter Storm, and outlined it on 3 December. However, he did not receive the 17th Panzer Division to complete his strike force on time; his understrength force began its relief attempt under the overall command of &quot;Generalfeldmarschall&quot; Erich von Manstein&#x27;s Army Group Don on 12 December. Hoth&#x27;s army was stalled at Verkhnekumsky until 15 December, allowing the Soviet 2nd Guards Army to reinforce its positions at the Myshkova River and prepare for Operation Little Saturn. On 16 December, three Soviet armies began Operation Little Saturn, threatening Army Group Don&#x27;s flank and stopping the 4th Panzer Army. By 25 December, Operation Winter Storm had failed, and Manstein ordered Hoth to abandon his breakthrough attempts. He was instead directed to help shore up the German defenses as the Soviet Operation Little Saturn threatened Army Group Don&#x27;s rear. However, the 4th Panzer Army was no longer in the position to cover a large section of the frontline. Overall, Hoth&#x27;s forces suffered heavy losses during these operations and were forced to retreat into the eastern Ukraine.

===Third Battle of Kharkov===

On 18 February, Hoth passed the command of his troops, by then part of the Mius-Front, to Karl-Adolf Hollidt. He then met with Manstein at Dnipropetrovsk where he was informed that the 4th Panzer Army was being refounded, consisting of two tank corps, two tank divisions, two infantry divisions, and Waffen-SS units, including the II SS Panzer Corps, &quot;Das Reich&quot; and &quot;Totenkopf&quot;. Under his command, this force was ordered to halt the Soviet 1st Guards and 6th Army east of Dnipropetrovsk and push them back across the river Samara. This operation was part of the Third Battle of Kharkov, a counteroffensive against the Soviet forces advancing in the Donbass region.

The newly refounded 4th Panzer Army launched its attack on 21 February. The German forces cut off the Soviet mobile spearheads and continued the drive north, with Hoth&#x27;s force starting its attack on Kharkov on 28 February. By early March, however, an early thaw threatened the German advance; Hoth and Manstein decided that the 4th Panzer Army should press on regardless. Kharkov was retaken by the Germans on 15 March and Belgorod on 18 March. Exhaustion of both the Wehrmacht and the Red Army coupled with the loss of mobility due to the onset of the spring rasputitsa resulted in the cessation of operations for both sides by mid-March. The counteroffensive left a salient extending into the German area of control, centered around the city of Kursk, and leading up to Operation Citadel.

===Battles of Kursk, the Dnieper, and last commands===

In July 1943, Hoth commanded the 4th Panzer Army in the Battle of Kursk as part of Army Group South. Operation Citadel called for a double envelopment, directed at Kursk, to surround the Soviet defenders and seal off the salient. The Army Group South committed Hoth&#x27;s 4th Panzer Army, alongside Army Detachment &quot;Kempf&quot;. At this point, Hoth was considered one of the Wehrmacht&#x27;s most experienced senior-level tank commanders, but his leadership was less effective compared to earlier periods of the war. Forczyk argued that Hoth showed signs of &quot;approaching burnout&quot;. As the offensive at Kursk was repeatedly delayed, Hoth became increasingly pessimistic about Operation Citadel&#x27;s chances of success due to the increasing Soviet defenses. Despite this, both Hoth as well as Werner Kempf, commander of the eponymous army detachment, decided not to prepare for obstacle breaching at Kursk, assuming that the German engineers would remove Soviet minefields without much difficulty. They also did not realize the depth and strength of Nikolai Vatutin&#x27;s defense lines. As a result of German mistakes in planning, coordination between Hoth and Kempf would be poor during the offensive, with each fighting a separate battle.

When Operation Citadel started, Hoth&#x27;s divisions, reinforced by the II SS Panzer Corps under Paul Hausser, penetrated several Soviet defensive lines, before being brought to a halt in the Battle of Prokhorovka. This was partially the result of Hoth hesitating to keep advancing as his flanks were threatened by Soviet counter-attacks, while Kempf&#x27;s force had been unable to keep up. On the other side, Forczyk argued that Hoth &quot;rightly&quot; chose to ignore orders by Manstein to reinforce failing attacks by Hermann Breith. Overall, the Battle of Kursk was a major Soviet victory.

In the aftermath of Kursk, the Red Army mounted a series of successful offensives that crossed the Dnieper. Hoth was unable to destroy the Soviet bridgeheads across the river. In September 1943, Hoth&#x27;s army was operationally penetrated by Red Army units and was unable to maintain a continuous front line even in retreat. The army crossed the Dnieper south and north of Kiev with heavy losses. Despite this, he received the Knight&#x27;s Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Swords for this strategic withdrawal and his defense at the Dnieper. In November, the Red Army broke through Hoth&#x27;s defenses in a surprise offensive which retook Kiev and ultimately pushed the Germans out of eastern Ukraine. The rapid loss of Kiev &quot;humiliated&quot; Hoth who was blamed by Hitler for this defeat. Historian Earl F. Ziemke also contended that by this point Hitler &quot;wanted generals who would hold without giving an inch&quot;, whereas Hoth was an expert in mobile defense. In November 1943, Hoth was put on leave, officially &quot;to unwind&quot;, and relieved of command on 10 December 1943. Forczyk argued that the German failures in the battle of the Dnieper had resulted from both Hitler&#x27;s interferences in tactical matters as well as the inability of the Wehrmacht commanders, including Hoth, to anticipate Soviet actions. According to him, they had not recognized the rapid improvement of the Red Army.

After being removed from his position, Hoth was denounced by Hitler as &quot;a bird of ill-omen&quot; and &quot;an instigator of defeatism of the worst sort&quot;. Hoth spent the following time in the &quot;Führerreserve&quot;. Though he was named commander of the Ore Mountains in April 1944, this position was &quot;completely meaningless&quot;. Hoth was only properly recalled in April 1945. He was appointed commander of the Saale, and ordered to defend the Halle-Leipzig area until the 12th Army was combat-ready again. He organized a defensive line at Mulde and Elbe and offered some resistance to the advancing United States Armed Forces before his forces broke. Afterwards, he served as commander of the Ore Mountains again before surrendering to U.S. American troops on 7 May 1945.

== Trial ==

Following the end of the war, Hoth was tried at the Subsequent Nuremberg Trials, in the High Command Trial.

=== Indictment ===
Hoth was charged on four counts:
# Crimes against peace by waging aggressive war against other nations and violating international treaties.
# War crimes by being responsible for murder, ill-treatment and other crimes against prisoners of war and enemy belligerents.
# Crimes against humanity by participating or ordering the murder, torture, deportation, hostage-taking, etc. of civilians in military-occupied countries.
# Participating and organizing the formulations and execution of a common plan and conspiracy to commit aforementioned crimes.

=== Hoth&#x27;s evidence ===
During his testimony he sought to explain his November 1941 order as being only aimed at the elimination of the &quot;Bolshevik-Jewish resistance&quot;. He denied any knowledge of the Holocaust, and claimed that his instructions only meant that his troops should be vigilant and were intended to improve morale: &quot;The German soldier in his good nature ... easily forgot that he was still in enemy territory&quot; and that the &quot;power of Bolshevism [had to be] broken&quot;. He insisted that no physical harm came to civilians as the result of this measure, which his troops executed with &quot;clean hands&quot;. Hoth maintained that if any Jews had been killed it was due to their connection to crimes against the German forces. &quot;It was a matter of common knowledge in Russia that it was the Jew in particular who participated in a very large extent in sabotage, espionage, etc.,&quot; Hoth claimed. However, he also maintained that the Russians were instinctually adjusted to a severe form of leadership, regarding leniency as weakness. Hoth believed this argument to sufficiently justify the brutality of the German occupation.

In regards to the criminal Commissar Order, Hoth claimed that he had been &quot;compelled&quot; to transmit it to the troops under his command, as otherwise he would have been replaced by a more compliant officer. He also denied having demanded that the Commissar Order be carried out, maintaining that he had opposed it. He expressed the view that his subordinates would have known of his disapproval of the order even though he had never actually voiced any opposition to it. Despite this, he made contradictory remarks as well. For once, he argued that Hitler would not have ordered his commanders to do anything criminal, claiming that the &quot;Führer&quot; had only wanted to &quot;protect&quot; soldiers from the commissars who had been &quot;bloodthirty beast[s]&quot;. Hoth also maintained that any orders by Hitler superseded Section 48 of the German Military Penal Code which affirmed that soldiers were under no obligation to adhere to clearly criminal orders. In response to evidence of his troops killing hostages, Hoth denied this as well. He instead posited that only partisans were executed, while blaming the brutality of partisan warfare on Soviet leader Joseph Stalin. Furthermore, he stated that Soviet prisoners of war had always been treated well, arguing that the usage of the nickname &quot;Ivan&quot; for the POWs showcased the &quot;family-like relationship that our soldiers had to the Russian prisoners of war&quot;. In an attempt to sway the tribunal, Hoth&#x27;s attorney submitted 92 affidavits testifying to his good character.

The International Military Tribunal found Hoth&#x27;s arguments unconvincing. According to Stein, &quot;apart of Wöhler, no other general was subject to more mockery&quot; during the High Command Trial. Relating to Hoth&#x27;s alleged lack of knowledge of the massacre of Jews, the tribunal pointed out the Artemovsk massacre. On 14 December 1941, the &quot;Sicherheitsdienst&quot; (SD) had murdered 1,224 Jews and 93 other prisoners at Artemovsk in an area of Hoth&#x27;s command; he admitted that he had been informed of the mass killing. The tribunal concluded that he was thus fully aware of the SD&#x27;s murder of Jews, but the 17th Army under Hoth still continued to hand over prisoners to the SD and continued to cooperate with the agency.

Furthermore, there was clear evidence that Hoth had transmitted the Commissar Order with his full knowledge and approval, and several reports confirmed that he had been aware of the execution of hundreds of captured commissars. There was also a large amount of evidence showcasing Hoth&#x27;s knowledge and approval of the mass execution of not just partisans, but also &quot;partisan suspects or sympathizers&quot;. Relating to the mistreatment of POWs under Hoth&#x27;s commamd, the tribunal referenced a report by the 17th Army&#x27;s &quot;Oberquartiermeister&quot; (chief quartermaster) to Hoth on 25 November 1941, outlining cases of murder, deliberate starvation, usage as human shields, and a general neglect of the POWs&#x27; welfare. The tribunal admitted that &quot;not all of these conditions&quot; could be attributed to Hoth, but that the commander had made no efforts to counteract and in some cases approved the mistreatment. Hoth had also ordered POWs to be used for forced labour and as ammunition loaders.

=== Judgement and sentence ===
Hoth was acquitted under counts one and four. He was convicted under count two relating to the Commissar Order and the unlawful treatment of POWs. He was also convicted under count three for war crimes and crimes against humanity consisting of crimes against civilians in regards to the murder of civilians suspected to be associated with partisans and Jews. The International Military Tribunal gave the following verdict against Hoth:

On 27 October 1948, he was sentenced to 15 years in prison. Hoth served his time in the prison of Landsberg am Lech. He complied with his prison duties, though continued to maintain his innocence. In January 1951, Hoth&#x27;s sentence was reviewed with no changes. He was released on parole in April 1954; his sentence was reduced to time served in 1957.

== Later life and legacy ==
After his release, he settled down in Goslar where he spent the rest of his life. He took up walking the Harz mountains as a hobby, and began writing on topics related to World War II. In 1956, Hoth wrote a book titled &quot;Panzer-Operationen&quot;. The book was translated into Russian under the title &quot;Tankovye operacii&quot; in 1961, and as &quot;Panzer Operations: Germany&#x27;s Panzer Group 3 During the Invasion of Russia, 1941&quot; into English in 2015. Chris Buckham, reviewer of the English translation, described it as &quot;very readable and thought-provoking&quot;. Hoth also penned several articles for the journal &quot;Wehrkunde&quot;. In one of these articles, Hoth made an &quot;almost hysterical&quot; appeal for the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot;, West Germany&#x27;s new armed forces, to mobilize strong tank divisions. He maintained contacts with Wehrmacht officers who had been recruited into the Bundeswehr such as Friedrich Foertsch.

In the 1960s, he began to speak out against German historians who began to study the war and highlight the crimes committed by Nazi Germany. Hoth claimed that German veterans were the ones who should have the &quot;greater right&quot; to shape the perception on the war. In his view, accounts of the conflict should not focus on defeats and instead maintain a &quot;heroic image&quot; of the Wehrmacht in order to protect the ability of the &quot;Bundeswehr&quot; to motivate potential officers to enlist. He spent his last years trying to &quot;preserve&quot; the German military&#x27;s public perception, giving interviews to journalists and historians. In addition, Hoth, Fritz Bayerlein, and several ex-SS officers worked closely with Paul Carell, assisting him to write a book titled &quot;Unternehmen Barbarossa&quot; (published 1963). Carell had worked as a German propagandist during World War II, and &quot;Unternehmen Barbarossa&quot; supported the myth of the clean Wehrmacht as well as the portrayal of Waffen-SS members as regular soldiers, ignoring the Holocaust and other German war crimes. In the writing process for &quot;Unternehmen Barbarossa&quot;, Hoth influenced Carell to portray Manstein&#x27;s performance in the campaigns of Stalingrad in a positive light. Reviewer Raymond L. Garthoff argued that the English translation of &quot;Unternehmen Barbarossa&quot;, called &quot;Hitler Moves East: 1941-1943&quot;, was a &quot;first-class military historical narrative&quot;, though exhibited a pro-Wehrmacht bias and tended to &quot;skip over more reprehensible German accomplishments&quot;. Michael Parrish was more critical, characterizing the book as an attempt &quot;to glorify the German Army, and heap blame on that most convenient of all scapegoats, Adolf Hitler&quot;, while also suffering from factual errors and deliberate omissions. Historians Ronald Smelser and Edward J. Davies concurred, stating that &quot;Hitler Moves East: 1941-1943&quot; is often misleading, portraying the &quot;Wehrmacht as heroes&quot; fighting &quot;the Asiatic hordes of Communism&quot;, while solely blaming Hitler for atrocities and the ultimate German defeat.

From 1965, Hoth developed close contacts with Ulrich de Maizière, Inspector General of the Bundeswehr. The two men had already known each other since World War II, as they had first met while serving in the Wehrmacht. Their first post-war meeting was organized by their common acquaintance, Friedrich Foertsch, and de Maizière discovered that they shared the belief that tank units should form the core of the West German military. The two began to regularly discuss topics, and the Inspector General publicly voiced his high opinion of Hoth.

Hoth died in Goslar on 25 January 1971. He was survived by his wife Lola.

Historians David M. Glantz and Jonathan M. House described Hoth as &quot;one of Germany&#x27;s most experienced armored tacticians&quot;. Ziemke argued that Hoth displayed &quot;mastery of the mobile defense&quot; in his campaigns. According to Buckham, Hoth &quot;is considered by many to have been one of the greatest armoured commanders serving in the German Army during the Second World War&quot;. Researcher Linden Lyons, translator of &quot;Panzer Operations&quot;, argued that Hoth &quot;was undoubtedly one of the most brilliant tank commanders of the Second World War, yet this is overshadowed by his strong enthusiasm for the expansionist and racist ideology of Nazism&quot;. Stein described Hoth as &quot;an outstanding &quot;Panzer&quot; commander. But in the larger historic context of the war, he was a nobody&quot;. In course of the war, Hoth had written down extensive notes, comparable in length to &quot;The Halder Diaries&quot;. Even though these notes were long ignored in historiography, Hürter argued that Hoth&#x27;s writings were of high value as they complement the information contained in Halder&#x27;s diaries. For instance, Hoth documented Hitler&#x27;s speech to his high-ranking officers before Operation Barbarossa in much more detail than any other source, outlining German strategic and ideological aims.

<text>The March Hare (called Haigha in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot;) is a character most famous for appearing in the tea party scene in Lewis Carroll&#x27;s 1865 book &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;.

The main character, Alice, hypothesizes,

: &quot;The March Hare will be much the most interesting, and perhaps as this is May it won&#x27;t be raving mad – at least not so mad as it was in March.&quot;

&quot;Mad as a March hare&quot; is a common British English phrase, both now and in Carroll&#x27;s time, and appears in John Heywood&#x27;s collection of proverbs published in 1546. It is reported in &quot;The Annotated Alice&quot; by Martin Gardner that this proverb is based on popular belief about hares&#x27; behaviour at the beginning of the long breeding season, which lasts from February to September in Britain. Early in the season, unreceptive females often use their forelegs to repel overenthusiastic males. It used to be incorrectly believed that these bouts were between males fighting for breeding supremacy.

Like the character&#x27;s friend, the Hatter, the March Hare feels compelled to always behave as though it is tea-time because the Hatter supposedly &quot;murdered the time&quot; whilst singing for the Queen of Hearts. Sir John Tenniel&#x27;s illustration also shows him with straw on his head, a common way to depict madness in Victorian times. The March Hare later appears at the trial for the Knave of Hearts, and for a final time as &quot;Haigha&quot; (which is pronounced to rhyme with &quot;mayor&quot;, according to Carroll, and a homophone of &quot;hare&quot; in a non-rhotic accent), the personal messenger to the White King in &quot;Through the Looking-Glass&quot; (Alice either does not recognize him as the March Hare of her earlier dream, or chooses not to comment about this).

== Major depictions ==

=== Disney animated film ===
Disney&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, an animated film, depicted the March Hare at the tea party as being deliriously confused. He repeatedly offers Alice a cup of tea, but distractedly yanks the cup out of her reach or takes it from her hands just as she is about to drink. He was voiced by Jerry Colonna, after whom his appearance and personality were modelled. He was animated by Ward Kimball.

This version of the character was also a semi-regular on &quot;Bonkers&quot; and one of the guests in &quot;House of Mouse&quot;, often seen seated with the Mad Hatter. During these appearances, the March Hare was voiced by Jesse Corti and Maurice LaMarche.

In the &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; video game series, March Hare makes a cameo appearance in a painting in the Tea Party Garden in the 2002 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot; and its 2009 sequel &quot;Kingdom Hearts 358/2 Days&quot;. He later made a physical appearance in the 2013 game &quot;Kingdom Hearts χ&quot;.
=== Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; ===

The March Hare appears in the 2010 Disney film &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, voiced by Paul Whitehouse. His full name is Thackery Earwicket; this, however, is not mentioned in the film. In the movie, the March Hare behaves as if constantly nerve-wracked and completely delirious. He is a cook in the film, and the way he eccentrically throws dishes and pots suggests he is an amalgam of both the March Hare and the cook from Lewis Carroll&#x27;s original book. The March Hare has a strong Scottish accent in this movie, while his friend the Mad Hatter (played by Johnny Depp) switches into a Scottish accent as well whenever his emotions are strained. He is first seen in the &quot;Tea Party&quot; scene, which takes place at his &quot;Hare House&quot; windmill. Thackery hosts a tea party, which he shares with Tarrant Hightopp the Mad Hatter, Mallymkun the Dormouse, and Chess the Cheshire Cat. He appears a second time in the White Queen&#x27;s kitchen, frantically cooking and throwing dishes. His third appearance is at the Frabjous Day scene, in which he stands with the other characters wielding a ladle as his weapon, nervous and somewhat ready to go to battle. Burton stated that because Whitehouse is a great comedic actor, a lot of his lines came from improvisation.

The March Hare appears in the &quot;Mad T Party&quot; in Disney&#x27;s California Adventure park. He is based on the 2010 film&#x27;s interpretation, and plays bass guitar. He is often found hopping around with Mallymkun the Dormouse on stage.
== In popular culture ==
* The March Hare was played by Charlie Ruggles in &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;.
* In SyFy&#x27;s TV miniseries &quot;Alice&quot;, the March Hare is represented by the character Mad March, the Queen&#x27;s favorite assassin. The Queen frequently had him killed, resulting in his head getting lost; the Carpenter replaces it with a robot rabbit head. Despite this, Mad March is still his old self, crass and (as liked by the Queen) a homicidal maniac.
* The March Hare is featured as the primary antagonist in the &quot;Once Upon a Time&quot; story &quot;Tea Party in March&quot; in the graphic novel &quot;Once Upon a Time: Out of the Past&quot;.
* In the song entitled &quot;We Have Heaven&quot; by the British rock group Yes, a lyric mantra is sung from beginning to end saying &quot;Tell the Moon Dog, tell the March Hare...&quot;.
* In the game &quot;American McGee&#x27;s Alice&quot;, the March Hare is portrayed as a victim of the Mad Hatter&#x27;s insane experimentation. Both the Hare and the Dormouse have become clockwork cyborgs. He also appears in the sequel, &quot;&quot; where he and the Dormouse betray the Hatter to aid in the Dollmaker&#x27;s plans by constructing the Infernal Train.
* In the video game adaptation of Tim Burton&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Thackery Earwicket is a playable character. He uses his telekinesis to defeat the Bandersnatch.
* In the manga &quot;Alice in the Country of Hearts&quot; the March Hare is called Elliot March and is Blood Dupre&#x27;s (the Hatter&#x27;s) right-hand man. He isn&#x27;t specifically crazy or mad, but has a quite violent attitude, almost killing Alice with his long-barrelled gun before being stopped by Blood.
* In the manga &quot;Pandora Hearts&quot;, the March Hare is a &quot;Chain&quot; whose &quot;Contractor&quot; is Reim Lunettes. It has the ability to fake death, which helps Reim to escape his attackers and proved to be so realistic that even his comrades have believed him really dead.
* In the Annette Ducharme song &quot;Moral&quot;, she references the March Hare singing: &quot;But you&#x27;re frantic like the March Hare running round&quot;.

<doc id="261671" wikidata="Q1053476" url="?curid=261671" title="1989 Loma Prieta earthquake">
<text>On October 17, 1989, at local time, the Loma Prieta earthquake occurred at the Central Coast of California. The shock was centered in The Forest of Nisene Marks State Park in Santa Cruz County, approximately northeast of Santa Cruz on a section of the San Andreas Fault System and was named for the nearby Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains. With an magnitude of 6.9 and a maximum Modified Mercalli intensity of IX (&quot;Violent&quot;), the shock was responsible for 63 deaths and 3,757 injuries. The Loma Prieta segment of the San Andreas Fault System had been relatively inactive since the 1906 San Francisco earthquake (to the degree that it was designated a seismic gap) until two moderate foreshocks occurred in June 1988 and again in August 1989.

Damage was heavy in Santa Cruz County and less so to the south in Monterey County, but effects extended well to the north into the San Francisco Bay Area, both on the San Francisco Peninsula and across the bay in Oakland. No surface faulting occurred, though many other ground failures and landslides were present, especially in the Summit area of the Santa Cruz Mountains. Liquefaction was also a significant issue, especially in the heavily damaged Marina District of San Francisco, but its effects were also seen in the East Bay, and near the shore of Monterey Bay, where a non-destructive tsunami was also observed.

Because it happened during a national live broadcast of the 1989 World Series, the annual championship series of Major League Baseball, taking place between Bay Area teams San Francisco Giants and the Oakland Athletics, it is sometimes referred to as the &quot;World Series earthquake&quot;, with the championship games of the year being referred to as the &quot;Earthquake Series&quot;. Rush-hour traffic on the Bay Area freeways was much lighter than normal because the game, being played at Candlestick Park in San Francisco, was about to begin, and this may have prevented a larger loss of life, as several of the Bay Area&#x27;s major transportation structures suffered catastrophic failures. The collapse of a section of the double-deck Nimitz Freeway in Oakland was the site of the largest number of casualties for the event, but the collapse of human-made structures and other related accidents contributed to casualties occurring in San Francisco, Los Gatos, and Santa Cruz.

==Background==
The history of earthquake investigations in California has been largely focused on the San Andreas Fault system because of its strong influence in the state as the boundary between the Pacific plate and the North American plate; it is the most studied fault on Earth. Andrew Lawson, a geologist from the University of California, Berkeley, had named the fault after the San Andreas Lake (prior to the occurrence of the 1906 San Francisco earthquake) and later led an investigation into that event. The San Andreas Fault ruptured for a length of during the 1906 shock, both to the north of San Francisco and to the south in the Santa Cruz Mountains region. Several long term forecasts for a large shock along the San Andreas Fault in that area had been made public prior to 1989 (the event and its aftershocks occurred within a recognized seismic gap) but the earthquake that transpired was not what had been anticipated. The 1989 Loma Prieta event originated on an undiscovered oblique-slip reverse fault that is located adjacent to the San Andreas Fault.

===Forecasts===

Since many forecasts had been presented for the region near Loma Prieta, seismologists were not taken by surprise by the October 1989 event. Between 1910 and 1989 there were 20 widely varying forecasts that were announced, with some that were highly specific, covering multiple aspects of an event, while others were less complete and vague. With a M6.5 event on the San Juan Bautista segment, or an M7 event on the San Francisco Peninsula segment, United States Geological Survey (USGS) seismologist Allan Lindh&#x27;s 1983 forecasted rupture length of (starting near Pajaro Gap, and continuing to the northwest) for the San Juan Bautista segment nearly matched the actual rupture length of the 1989 event. An updated forecast was presented in 1988, at which time Lindh took the opportunity to assign a new name to the San Juan Bautista segment – the Loma Prieta segment.

In early 1988, the Working Group for California Earthquake Probabilities (WGCEP) made several statements regarding their forecasts for the northern San Andreas Fault segment, the San Francisco Peninsula segment, and a portion of that segment which was referred to as the southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. The thirty year probability for one or more M7 earthquakes in the study area was given as 50%, but because of a lack of information and low confidence, a 30% probability was assigned to the Southern Santa Cruz Mountains segment. Two moderate shocks, referred to as the Lake Elsman earthquakes by the USGS, occurred in the Santa Cruz Mountains region in June 1988 and again in August 1989. Following each event, the State office of Emergency Services issued (for the first time in Bay Area history) short term advisories for a possible large earthquake, which meant there was &quot;a slightly increased likelihood of an M6.5 event on the Santa Cruz Mountains segment of the San Andreas fault&quot;. The advisories following the two Lake Elsman events were issued in part because of the statements made by WGCEP and because they were two of the three largest shocks to occur along the 1906 earthquake&#x27;s rupture zone since 1914.

===Foreshocks===


The 5.3 June 1988 and the 5.4 August 1989 events also occurred on previously unknown oblique reverse faults and were within of the M6.9 Loma Prieta mainshock epicenter, near the intersection of the San Andreas and Sargent faults. Total displacement for these shocks was relatively small (approximately of strike-slip and substantially less reverse-slip) and although they occurred on separate faults and well before the mainshock, a group of seismologists considered these to be foreshocks because of when and where they occurred relative to the main event. Each event&#x27;s aftershock sequence and effect on stress drop was closely examined, and their study indicated that the shocks affected the mainshock&#x27;s rupture process. Following the August 8, 1989, shock, in anticipation of an upcoming large earthquake, staff at the University of California, Santa Cruz deployed four accelerometers in the area, which were positioned at the UCSC campus, two residences in Santa Cruz, and a home in Los Gatos. Unlike other nearby (high gain) seismographs that were overwhelmed (driven off scale) by the large magnitude mainshock, the four accelerometers captured a useful record of the main event and more than half an hour of the early aftershock activity.

The June 27, 1988, shock occurred with a maximum intensity of VI (&quot;Strong&quot;). Its effects included broken windows in Los Gatos, and other light damage in Holy City, where increased flow was observed at a water well. Farther away from the Santa Cruz Mountains, pieces of concrete fell from a parking structure at the Sunnyvale Town Center, a two-level shopping mall in Santa Clara County. More moderate damage resulted from the August 8, 1989, shock (intensity VII, &quot;Very strong&quot;) when chimneys were toppled in Cupertino, Los Gatos, and Redwood Estates. Other damage included cracked walls and foundations and broken underground pipes. At the office of the Los Gatos City Manager, a window that was cracked had also been broken in the earlier shock. Also in Los Gatos, one man died when he fell or jumped through a window and impacted the ground five stories below.

==Earthquake==
The Loma Prieta earthquake was named for Loma Prieta Peak in the Santa Cruz Mountains, which lies just to the east of the mainshock epicenter. The duration of the heaviest shaking in the Santa Cruz Mountains was about 15 seconds, but strong ground motion recordings revealed that the duration of shaking was not uniform throughout the affected area (because of different types and thicknesses of soil). At sites with rocky terrain, the duration was shorter and the shaking was much less intense, and at locations with unconsolidated soil (like the Marina District in San Francisco or the Cypress Street Viaduct in Oakland) the intensity of the shaking was more severe and lasted longer. The strong motion records also allowed for the causative fault to be determined – the rupture was related to the San Andreas Fault System.

While a Mercalli Intensity of VIII (&quot;Severe&quot;) covered a large swath of territory relatively close to the epicenter (including the cities of Los Gatos, Santa Cruz, and Watsonville) farther to the north, portions of San Francisco were assessed at intensity IX (&quot;Violent&quot;). At more than distant, the San Francisco Bay Area recorded peak horizontal accelerations that were as high as 0.26 &quot;g&quot;, and close to the epicenter they peaked at more than 0.6 &quot;g&quot;. In a general way, the location of aftershocks of the event delineated the extent of the faulting, which (according to seismologist Bruce Bolt) extended about in length. Because the rupture took place bilaterally, the duration of strong shaking was about half of what it would have been had it ruptured in one direction only. The duration of a typical M6.9 shock with a comparable rupture length would have been about twice as long.

===Characteristics===
Gregory Beroza, a seismologist with Stanford University, made several distinctions regarding the 1906 and 1989 events. Near Loma Prieta, the 1906 rupture was more shallow, had more strike-slip, and occurred on a fault that was near vertical. The 1989 event&#x27;s oblique-slip rupture was at 10 km and below on a fault plane that dipped 70° to the southwest. Because much of the slip in 1989 occurred at depth and the rupture propagated up dip, Beroza proposed that the overlying San Andreas Fault actually inhibited further rupture and also maintains that the occurrence of an event at the location that was forecast by the WGCEP in 1988 was coincidental.

The contrasting characteristics of the 1906 and 1989 events were examined by seismologists Hiroo Kanamori and Kenji Satake. The significant amount of vertical displacement in 1989 was a key aspect to consider because a long-term sequence of 1989-type events (with an 80–100-year recurrence interval) normally result in regions with high topographic relief, which is not seen in the Santa Cruz Mountains. Three scenarios were presented that might explain this disparity. The first is that the geometry of the San Andreas Fault goes through a transition every several thousand years. Secondly, slip type could vary from event to event. And lastly, the 1989 event did not occur on the San Andreas Fault.

===Ground effects===
While the effects of a four-year drought limited the potential of landslides, the steep terrain near the epicenter was prone to movement, and up to 4,000 landslides may have occurred during the event. The majority of landslides occurred to the southwest of the epicenter, especially along road cuts in the Santa Cruz Mountains and in the Summit Road area, but also along the bluffs of the Pacific Coast, and as far north as the Marin Peninsula. Highway 17 was blocked for several weeks by a large slide and one person was killed by a rockfall along the coast. Other areas with certain soil conditions were susceptible to site amplification due to the effects of liquefaction, especially near the shore of San Francisco Bay (where its effects were severe in the Marina District) and to the west of the epicenter near rivers and other bodies of water. Minor lateral spreading was also seen along the shores of San Francisco Bay and to the south near Monterey Bay. Other ground effects included downslope movement, slumps, and ground cracks.

===Injuries and fatalities===

Fifty-seven of the deaths were directly caused by the earthquake; six further fatalities were ruled to have been caused indirectly. In addition, there were 3,757 injuries as a result of the earthquake, 400 of which were serious. The highest number of deaths, 42, occurred in Oakland because of the collapse of the Cypress Street Viaduct on the Nimitz Freeway (Interstate 880), where the upper level of a double-deck portion of the freeway collapsed, crushing the cars on the lower level, and causing crashes on the upper level. One section of the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge also collapsed, leading to a single fatality, Anamafi Moala, a 23-year-old woman. Three people were killed in the collapse of buildings along the Pacific Garden Mall in Santa Cruz, and five people were killed in the collapse of a brick wall on Bluxome Street in San Francisco.

When the earthquake hit, the third game of the 1989 World Series baseball championship was about to begin. Because of the unusual circumstance that both of the World Series teams (the San Francisco Giants and Oakland Athletics) were based in the affected area, many people had left work early or were staying late to participate in after work group viewings and parties. As a consequence the normally crowded freeways contained unusually light traffic. If traffic had been normal for a Tuesday rush hour, injuries and deaths would certainly have been higher. The initial media reports failed to take into account the game&#x27;s effect on traffic and initially estimated the death toll at 300, a number that was corrected to 63 in the days after the earthquake.

===Magnetic disturbances===
After the earthquake occurred, a group led by Antony C. Fraser-Smith of Stanford University reported that the event was preceded by disturbances in background magnetic field noise as measured by a sensor placed in Corralitos, about from the epicenter. From October 5, they reported that a substantial increase in noise was measured in the frequency range 0.01–10 Hz. The measurement instrument was a single-axis search-coil magnetometer that was being used for low frequency research. Precursor increases of noise apparently started a few days before the earthquake, with noise in the range 0.01–0.5 Hz rising to exceptionally high levels about three hours before the earthquake. The Fraser-Smith et al. report remains one of the most frequently cited claims of a specific earthquake precursor; more recent studies have cast doubt on the connection, attributing the Corralitos signals to either unrelated magnetic disturbance or, even more simply, to sensor-system malfunction.

==Damage==
The earthquake caused severe damage in some very specific locations in the Bay Area, most notably on unstable soil in San Francisco and Oakland. Oakland City Hall was evacuated after the earthquake until a US$80 million (equivalent to US$ million today) seismic retrofit and hazard abatement work was completed in 1995. Many other communities sustained severe damage throughout the region located in Alameda, San Mateo, Santa Clara, San Benito, Santa Cruz and Monterey counties. Major property damage in San Francisco&#x27;s Marina District from the epicenter resulted from liquefaction of soil used to create waterfront land. Other effects included sand volcanoes, landslides and ground ruptures. Some 12,000 homes and 2,600 businesses were damaged. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) turned people who were homeless prior to the earthquake away from homeless shelters and provided shelter for those with homes prior to the earthquake.

In Santa Cruz, close to the epicenter, 40 buildings collapsed, killing six people. At the Santa Cruz Beach Boardwalk, the Plunge Building was significantly damaged. Liquefaction also caused damage in the Watsonville area. For example, sand volcanoes formed in a field near Pajaro as well as in a strawberry field. The Ford&#x27;s department store in Watsonville experienced significant damage, including a crack down the front of the building. Many homes were dislodged if they were not bolted to their foundations. There were structural failures of twin bridges across Struve Slough near Watsonville. In Moss Landing, the liquefaction destroyed the causeway that carried the Moss Beach access road across a tidewater basin, damaged the approach and abutment of the bridge linking Moss Landing spit to the mainland and cracked the paved road on Paul&#x27;s Island. In the Old Town historical district of the city of Salinas, unreinforced masonry buildings were partially destroyed.

Following the quake, an estimated 1.4 million people experienced power losses that were mainly due to damaged electrical substations. Many San Francisco radio and television stations were temporarily knocked off the air. KGO-TV, the local ABC station in San Francisco, was off the air for about 15 minutes, while KRON-TV (at the time the region&#x27;s NBC affiliate) was off the air for about half an hour, and KGO-AM (ABC News Radio) was off the air for about 40 minutes. About an hour and 40 minutes after the quake, Fox affiliate KTVU resumed broadcasting, with their news anchors, Dennis Richmond and Elaine Corral reporting from the station&#x27;s parking lot. KCBS-AM (CBS News Radio) switched immediately to backup power and managed to stay on air despite a subsequent generator failure. KCBS later won a Peabody Award for their news coverage, as did KGO-TV.

KNBR-AM (the designated station for the Bay Area&#x27;s Emergency Broadcast System at the time) failed to communicate a catastrophe with the activation and instructions of the Emergency Broadcast System to the public after the quake because the engineering department at KNBR experienced major technical malfunctions and difficulties. The malfunctions during the aftermath of the earthquake caused confusion as to whether an earthquake would cause the Emergency Broadcast System to activate. KNBR began using an emergency generator, hooking up the signal from a command center right after their nearby studio was severely shaken during the quake, when most of the KNBR staff were at Candlestick for the World Series. The Mayor of San Francisco, Art Agnos, later came on the air and provided an update on the earthquake.

(All four network-affiliated TV stations (KRON, KGO, KTVU and CBS affiliate KPIX) would recover enough to broadcast continuous breaking news coverage of the aftermath of the quake for the next several hours, some of it picked up and broadcast nationally over their respective networks, as well as on CNN, in a manner anticipating later major catastrophes such as the 1994 Los Angeles earthquake and the 9/11 terror attacks).

Power was restored to most of San Francisco by midnight, and all but 12,000 customers had their power restored within two days.

The quake caused an estimated $6 billion (equivalent to $ billion today) in property damage, becoming one of the most expensive natural disasters in U.S. history at the time. Private donations poured into aid relief efforts and on October 26, President George H. W. Bush signed a $1.1 billion ($ billion today) earthquake relief package for California.

===Marina District===
Four people died in San Francisco&#x27;s Marina District, four buildings were destroyed by fire, and seven buildings collapsed. Another 63 damaged structures were judged too dangerous to live in. Among the four deaths, one family lost their infant son who choked on dust while trapped for an hour inside their collapsed apartment.

The Marina district was built on a landfill made of a mixture of sand, dirt, rubble, waste, and other materials containing a high percentage of groundwater. Some of the fill was rubble dumped into San Francisco Bay after the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but most was sand and debris laid down in preparation for the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition, a celebration of San Francisco&#x27;s ability to rebound after its catastrophe in 1906. After the Exposition, apartment buildings were erected on the landfill. In the 1989 earthquake, the water-saturated unconsolidated mud, sand, and rubble suffered liquefaction, and the earthquake&#x27;s vertical shock waves rippled the ground more severely.

At the intersection of Beach and Divisadero Streets in San Francisco, a natural gas main rupture caused a major structure fire. The San Francisco Fire Department selected civilians to help run fire hoses from a distance because the nearby hydrant system failed. Since the bay was only two blocks from the burning buildings, water from the bay was pumped by the fireboat &quot;Phoenix&quot;, to engines on the shore, and from there sprayed on the fire. The apartment structures that collapsed were older buildings that included ground-floor garages, which engineers refer to as a soft story building.

===Santa Cruz and Monterey counties===
In Santa Cruz, the Pacific Garden Mall was severely damaged, with falling debris killing three people, half of the six earthquake deaths in Santa Cruz and Monterey Counties. Some 31 buildings were damaged enough to warrant demolition, seven of which had been listed in the Santa Cruz Historic Building Survey. The four oldest were built in 1894, the five oldest withstood the 1906 San Francisco earthquake.

Immediately, a number of civilians began to free victims from the rubble of Ford&#x27;s Department Store and the Santa Cruz Coffee Roasting Company – both buildings had collapsed inward on customers and employees alike. Two police officers crawled through voids in the debris, found one victim alive and another dead inside the coffee house. Santa Cruz beach lifeguards assisted in moving the victims. Police dogs were brought in to help locate other victims. A woman was found dead inside Ford&#x27;s. The civilians who were helpful initially, were soon viewed by police and fire officials as a hindrance to operations, with frantic coworkers and friends of a coffee house employee thought to be trapped under the rubble continuing their efforts in the dark. Police arrested those who refused to stop searching. This became a political issue in the following days. The body of a young woman coffee worker was found under a collapsed wall late the next day.

During the first few days following the quake, electric power to most Santa Cruz County subscribers was out, and some areas had no water. Limited phone service remained online, providing a crucial link to rescue workers. Widespread search operations were organized to find possible victims inside the remains of fallen structures. As many as six teams of dogs and their handlers were at work identifying the large number of damaged buildings that held no victims.

The quake claimed one life in Watsonville: a driver who collided with panicked horses after they escaped their collapsed corral. In other Santa Cruz and Monterey county locations such as Boulder Creek and Moss Landing, a number of structures were damaged, with some knocked off of their foundations. Many residents slept outside their homes out of concern for further damage from aftershocks, of which there were 51 with magnitudes greater than 3.0 in the following 24 hours, and 16 more the second day. The earthquake damaged several historic buildings in the Old Town district of Salinas, and some were later demolished.

Damage to the Salinas River rail bridge and subsequent repairs led to reduced traffic on the Monterey Branch Line, which contributed to the discontinuance of freight rail services in western Monterey County.

===San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge===
The San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge suffered severe damage, as a section of the upper deck on the eastern cantilever side fell onto the deck below. The quake caused the Oakland side of the bridge to shift to the east, and caused the bolts of one section to shear off, sending the section of roadbed crashing down like a trapdoor. Traffic on both decks came to a halt, blocked by the section of the roadbed. Police began unsnarling the traffic jam, telling drivers to turn their cars around and drive back the way they had come. Eastbound drivers stuck on the lower deck between the collapse and Yerba Buena Island were routed up to the upper deck and westward back to San Francisco. A miscommunication made by emergency workers at Yerba Buena Island routed some drivers the wrong way; they were directed to the upper deck where they drove eastward toward the collapse site. One of these drivers did not see the open gap in time; the 1980 Mercury Zephyr plunged over the edge and smashed onto the collapsed roadbed. The driver, Anamafi Moala, died, and the passenger, her brother, was seriously injured. Caltrans removed and replaced the collapsed section, and re-opened the bridge on November 18.

To assist with transportation during Bay Bridge repairs, Bay Area Rapid Transit ran 24-hour service in the Transbay Tube between the date of the earthquake and December 3 that same year.

===Oakland and Interstate 880/Cypress Viaduct===
The worst disaster of the earthquake was the collapse of the double-deck Cypress Street Viaduct of Interstate 880 in West Oakland. The failure of a section of the viaduct, also known as the &quot;Cypress Structure&quot; and the &quot;Cypress Freeway&quot;, killed 42 and injured many more.

Built in the late 1950s and opened to traffic in 1957 (as SR 17), the Cypress Street Viaduct, a stretch of Interstate 880, was a double-deck freeway section made of nonductile reinforced concrete that was constructed above and astride Cypress Street in Oakland. Roughly half of the land the Cypress Viaduct was built on was filled marshland and the other half somewhat more stable alluvium. Because of new highway structure design guidelines – the requirement of ductile construction elements – instituted following the 1971 San Fernando earthquake, a limited degree of earthquake reinforcement was retrofitted to the Cypress Viaduct in 1977. The added elements were longitudinal restraints at transverse expansion joints in the box girder spans, but no studies were made of possible failure modes specific to the Cypress Viaduct. Caltrans has since received widespread backlash for not thoroughly studying the structure. When the earthquake hit, the shaking was amplified on the former marshland, and soil liquefaction occurred.

When the earthquake struck, the freeway buckled and twisted before the support columns failed and the upper deck fell on the lower deck. Forty-two people were crushed to death in their cars. Cars on the upper deck were tossed around violently, some of them flipped sideways, and some were left dangling at the edge of the freeway. Nearby residents and factory workers came to the rescue, climbing onto the wreckage with ladders and forklifts and pulling trapped people out of their cars from under a four-foot gap in some sections. 60 members of Oakland&#x27;s Public Works Agency left the nearby city yard and joined rescue efforts. Employees from Pacific Pipe drove heavy lift equipment to the scene and started using it to raise sections of fallen freeway enough to allow further rescue. Local workers continued their volunteer operation nonstop until October 21, 1989, when they were forced to pause as U.S. President George H. W. Bush and California Governor George Deukmejian viewed the damage. That same day, survivor Buck Helm was freed from the wreckage, having spent 90 hours trapped in his car. Dubbed &quot;Lucky Buck&quot; by the local radio, Helm lived for another 29 days on life support, but then died of respiratory failure at the age of 58.

Although the freeway reopened in stages between 1997 and 1999, it was not fully rebuilt until 2001 so that it would comply with safety and reinforcement standards. In the meantime, traffic was detoured through nearby Interstate 980, causing increased congestion. Instead of rebuilding Interstate 880 over the same ground, Caltrans rerouted the freeway farther west around the outskirts of West Oakland to provide better access to the Port of Oakland and the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, and to meet community desires to keep the freeway from cutting through residential areas (at the time the original viaduct was constructed, West Oakland was predominantly occupied by African- and Hispanic-Americans). Street-level Mandela Parkway now occupies the previous roadbed of the Cypress structure.

===Effects on transportation===

Immediately after the earthquake, Bay Area airports were closed so officials could conduct a visual inspection and damage assessment procedures. San Jose International Airport, Oakland International Airport and San Francisco International Airport all opened the next morning. Large cracks in Oakland&#x27;s runway and taxiway reduced the usable length to two-thirds normal, and damage to the dike required quick remediation to avoid flooding the runway with water from the bay. Oakland Airport repair costs were assessed at $30 million (equivalent to $ million today).

San Francisco Municipal Railway (Muni) lost all power to electric transit systems when the quake hit, but otherwise suffered little damage and no injuries to operators or riders. Cable cars and electric trains and buses were stalled in place – half of Muni&#x27;s transport capability was lost for 12 hours. Muni relied on diesel buses to continue abbreviated service until electric power was restored later that night, and electric units could be inspected and readied for service on the morning of October 18. After 78 hours, 96 percent of Muni services were back in operation, including the cable cars. Amtrak intercity rail service into Oakland from the &quot;California Zephyr&quot; continued, but the &quot;Coast Starlight&quot; was temporarily suspended north of Salinas because of damage to the Southern Pacific&#x27;s Coast Line.

The earthquake changed the Bay Area&#x27;s automobile transportation landscape. Not only did the quake force seismic retrofitting of all Bay Area bridges, it caused enough damage that some parts of the region&#x27;s freeway system had to be demolished. Damage to the region&#x27;s transportation system was estimated at $1.8 billion (equivalent to $ billion today).
* San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge, Interstate 80: The Bay Bridge was repaired and reopened to traffic in a month. However, the earthquake made it clear that the Bay Bridge, like many of California&#x27;s toll bridges, required major repair or replacement for long-term viability and safety. Construction on a replacement for the eastern span began on January 29, 2002. The project was completed on September 2, 2013.
* Cypress Street Viaduct/Nimitz Freeway, Interstate 880: The double-decked Cypress Street Viaduct, Interstate 880 was demolished soon after the earthquake and was not replaced until July 1997 (To the Bay Bridge only, the ramps to and from Interstate 80 east were not completed until 2001 despite opening in 1999). The replacement freeway section is a single-deck rather than double-deck structure and was re-routed around the outskirts of West Oakland, rather than bisecting it as the Cypress Street Viaduct had done. The former route of the Cypress Street Viaduct was reopened as the ground-level Mandela Parkway.
* Embarcadero Freeway, State Route 480: Earthquake damage forced the closure and demolition of San Francisco&#x27;s incomplete and controversial Embarcadero Freeway (State Route 480). This removal opened up San Francisco&#x27;s Embarcadero area to new development. The elevated structure, which ran along San Francisco&#x27;s waterfront, was demolished in 1991 and later replaced with a ground-level boulevard.
* Interstate 280: Seismic damage also forced the long-term closure of Interstate 280 in San Francisco (north of US 101), another concrete freeway which had never been completed to its originally planned route. The uncompleted northernmost stub of I-280 was demolished during August–October 1995 while one connecting ramp between northbound I-280 and southbound US 101 was opened in December 1995. The full I-280 project was completed in late 1997. In addition, another segment of Interstate 280 in Los Altos near State Route 85 also suffered seismic damage and was subsequently repaired.
* Central Freeway, U.S. Highway 101: San Francisco&#x27;s Central Freeway (part of US 101 and a key link to the Bay Bridge flyover) was another concrete double-deck structure that faced demolition because of safety concerns. Originally terminating at Franklin Street and Golden Gate Avenue near San Francisco&#x27;s Civic Center, the section past Fell Street was demolished first, then later the section between Mission and Fell Streets. The section from Mission Street to Market Street was rebuilt (completed September 2005) as a single-deck elevated freeway, touching down at Market Street and feeding into Octavia Boulevard, a ground-level urban parkway carrying traffic to and from the major San Francisco traffic arterials that the old elevated freeway used to connect to directly, including Fell and Oak Streets (which serve the city&#x27;s western neighborhoods) and Franklin and Gough Streets (which serve northern neighborhoods and the Golden Gate Bridge).
* State Route 17: Over half of the highway was closed for about one to two months because of landslides that occurred between Granite Creek Road in Scotts Valley and State Route 9 in Los Gatos (only Buses and carpoolers with three or more people could cross it). After reopening, retaining walls and barbed fences were added in damaged areas to prevent any further landslides/rockslides. The route crosses the San Andreas Fault in the Santa Cruz Mountains, near the earthquake&#x27;s epicenter.
* Cabrillo Highway, State Route 1: In Watsonville, the Struve Slough Bridge collapsed, with concrete/steel support columns penetrating up through the bridge deck. The highway was closed for several months until it could be demolished and rebuilt (commuters took SR 152 and SR 129 as bypass routes). Another section of Highway 1 through Monterey suffered damage and had to be rebuilt as well. Additionally, the bridge carrying Highway 1 over the Salinas River near Highway 156 and Fort Ord was damaged and subsequently rebuilt.
* Bay Area Rapid Transit: The BART rail system, which hauled commuters between the East Bay and San Francisco via the Transbay Tube, was virtually undamaged and only closed for post-earthquake inspection. With the Bay Bridge closed because of its damage, the Transbay Tube became the quickest way into San Francisco via Oakland for a month, and ridership increased in the three work weeks following the earthquake, going from 218,000 riders per average weekday to more than 330,000 post-quake, a 50% increase. BART instituted round-the-clock train service until December 3 when they returned to their normal schedule. In 2006, BART began the $1.3 billion Earthquake Safety Program to retrofit tunnels, aerial structures, and stations. Completion is planned by 2023.
* Amtrak: Historic 16th Street Station in downtown Oakland suffered significant damage and was rendered structurally unsound. Amtrak would shift its Oakland operations to a new station in Emeryville.
* Transbay Ferries: Ferry service between San Francisco and Oakland, which had ended decades before, was revived during the month-long closure of the Bay Bridge as an alternative to the overcrowded BART. A ferry terminal was put together in Alameda, and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers dredged a suitable ferry dock at the Berkeley Marina. Additionally, the demolition of the quake-damaged Embarcadero Freeway led to the Ferry Building Terminal renovation, increasing the efficiency of ferry service to the peninsula. The passenger-only service proved popular and continues to expand its service. The need for a robust ferry system in the event that the region&#x27;s roads and tunnels become impassable in an emergency led to the creation of the San Francisco Bay Ferry system.

==1989 World Series and television coverage==
The 1989 World Series featured the Oakland Athletics and the San Francisco Giants in the first cross-town World Series since 1956. Game 3 of the series was scheduled to begin at San Francisco&#x27;s Candlestick Park on October 17 at 5:35 PDT, and American television network ABC began its pre-game show at 5:00 PDT. When the earthquake struck at approximately 5:04 PDT, sportscaster Tim McCarver was narrating taped highlights of Game 2, which had been played two days prior across the Bay Bridge in Oakland. Television viewers saw the video signal begin to break up, heard McCarver repeat a sentence as the shaking distracted him, and heard McCarver&#x27;s colleague Al Michaels exclaim, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what, we&#x27;re having an earth – .&quot; At that moment, the signal from Candlestick Park was lost.

The network put up a green ABC Sports &quot;World Series&quot; technical difficulties telop graphic while it scrambled to repair the video feed (the broadcast cameras and mics were powered by the local power supply), but audio from the stadium was restored after thirteen seconds via a telephone link:

Al Michaels: Well, heh, I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re on the air... We are in commercial, I guess.

Jim Palmer: Yes, yes, we hear you.

Tim McCarver: I guess...

Michaels: I don&#x27;t hear a thing.

McCarver: I guess Dave Parker...

Michaels: Well, heh, I don&#x27;t know if we&#x27;re on the air or not, and I&#x27;m not sure I care at this particular moment but we are. Well, folks, that&#x27;s the greatest open in the history of television! Bar none!

McCarver: Opened with a bang!

Michaels: Yes, it certainly did! Heh! We&#x27;re still here! Heh! We are still, as we can tell, on the air, and I guess you are hearing us, even though we have no picture and no return audio, and we will be back, we hope, from San Francisco, in just a moment.
The combined screams of excitement and panic from fans who had no idea of the devastation elsewhere could be heard in the background. ABC then switched to episodes of &quot;Roseanne&quot; and &quot;The Wonder Years&quot;, which were on standby for a rain delay situation, while attempting to restore electricity to its remote equipment. The first television news report of the earthquake, filed by reporter Mark Coogan, came over KABC-TV in Los Angeles at 5:11 pm PDT. KGO-TV, the local owned-and-operated ABC station in San Francisco, lost power for almost 15 minutes upon the start of the earthquake, before beginning its coverage with anchor Cheryl Jennings.

With anchorman Ted Koppel in position in Washington, D.C., ABC News began continuous coverage of the quake at 5:32 pm PDT, with Al Michaels, in the process, becoming a de facto on-site reporter for ABC. CBS News also began coverage around that same time with coverage from its San Francisco affiliate KPIX-TV. About an hour later, NBC News also began continuous coverage with Tom Brokaw anchoring and featuring local coverage from its then-San Francisco affiliate, KRON-TV. A Goodyear Blimp had already been overhead to cover the baseball game, and ABC used it to capture images of damage to the Bay Bridge and other locations. Local Fox affiliate KTVU was knocked off the air for over 90 minutes before returning to the air with a raw feed fed from one of the station&#x27;s remote trucks. KTVU anchors Dennis Richmond and Elaine Corral began their coverage from the station&#x27;s parking lot, as power had not yet been restored to that section of Oakland.

Inside Candlestick Park, fewer than half of the more than 62,000 fans had reached their seats by the time of the quake, and the load on the structure of the stadium was lower than maximum. There had also been a seismic-strengthening project previously completed on the upper deck concrete windscreen that may have prevented large numbers of injuries in the event of serious damage or even a catastrophic collapse. Fans reported that the stadium moved in an articulated manner as the earthquake wave passed through it, that the light standards swayed by many feet, and that the concrete upper deck windscreen moved in a wave-like manner over a distance of several feet. When electrical power to the stadium was lost, someone drove a police car onto the field, where an officer used the car&#x27;s public address system to advise that the game had been postponed. After the shaking subsided, many of the players on both teams immediately searched for, and gathered, family and friends from the stands before evacuating the facility.

The October 18, 1989, edition of NBC&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; that covered the earthquake ran until noon Eastern Time. Bryant Gumbel, Jane Pauley and Deborah Norville anchored from Chicago (where they had planned to originally do a special celebratory edition), with reports done by Bob Jamieson and Don Oliver in San Francisco, and George Lewis in Oakland. Jim Miklaszewski and Bob Hager covered disaster response from Washington. NBC Sports commentators Bob Costas and Jimmy Cefalo discussed the effect the temblor would have on the 1989 World Series.

The World Series was delayed while the Bay Area started the recovery process. While the teams&#x27; stadiums had suffered only minor damage, it took several days for power and transmission links at Candlestick Park to be repaired. After ten days (the longest delay in World Series history), Game 3 was held in San Francisco on October 27 and Game 4 the following afternoon as the Athletics swept the Giants, four games to none.

It is likely that the World Series game saved many lives, as Bay Area residents who would have normally been on the freeways were at home ready to watch the game when the earthquake hit. It is a rough estimate that thousands of people may have otherwise been on the Cypress Structure during the 5:00 pm rush-hour, as the structure was said to have carried 195,000 vehicles a day.

<text>The pan-African flag (also known as the Afro-American flag, Black Liberation flag, UNIA flag, and various other names) is an ethnic flag representing pan-Africanism, the African diaspora, and/or black nationalism. A tri-color flag, it consists of three equal horizontal bands of (from top down) red, black, and green. 

The flag was created as a response to racism against African Americans in 1920 with the help of Marcus Garvey. The Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL) formally adopted it on August 13, 1920, in Article 39 of the Declaration of the Rights of the Negro Peoples of the World, during its month-long convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Variations of the flag can and have been used in various countries and territories in the Americas to represent Garveyist ideologies.

==History==

The flag was created in 1920 by members of UNIA in response to the &quot;coon song&quot; that became a hit around 1900, titled, &quot;Every Race Has a Flag but the Coon&quot;. This song has been cited as one of the three songs that &quot;firmly established the term &quot;coon&quot; in the American vocabulary&quot;. In a 1927 report of a 1921 speech appearing in the &quot;Negro World&quot; weekly newspaper, Marcus Garvey was quoted as saying:

The &quot;Universal Negro Catechism&quot;, published by the UNIA in 1921, refers to the colors of the flag meaning:

According to the UNIA more recently, the three colors on the Black Nationalist flag represent:
* red: the blood that unites all people of Black African ancestry, and shed for liberation;
* black: black people whose existence as a nation, though not a nation-state, is affirmed by the existence of the flag; and
* green: the abundant natural wealth of Africa.
The flag later became a Black Nationalist symbol for the worldwide liberation of Black people. As an emblem of Black pride, the flag became popular during the Black Liberation movement of the 1960s. In 1971, the school board of Newark, New Jersey, passed a resolution permitting the flag to be raised in public school classrooms. Four of the board&#x27;s nine members were not present at the time, and the resolution was introduced by the board&#x27;s teen member, a mayoral appointee. Fierce controversy ensued, including a court order that the board show cause why they should not be forced to rescind the resolution, and at least two state legislative proposals to ban ethnic flags and national flags (other than the U.S. flag) in public classrooms.

===Juneteenth===
June 19, 1865, is the date in which enslaved people in Galveston, Texas, finally received the news of their freedom. This is commemorated every June 19 with Juneteenth, which is considered the longest-running African American holiday. Many in the African American community have adopted the Pan-African flag to represent Juneteenth. The Juneteenth holiday became an official federal holiday June 17, 2021, and does have its own flag, however, created in 1997the Juneteenth flag.

=== 2010s usage===
In the United States, following the refusal of a grand jury to indict a police officer in the August 9, 2014, shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri, a Howard University student replaced the U.S. flag on that school&#x27;s Washington, D.C., campus flagpole with a &quot;black solidarity&quot; flag (this tricolor) flying at half-mast.

=== 2020s usage===
In February 2023, the Pan-African flag was flown over the Denver Federal Center to commemorate Black History Month, which was the first time that flag was flown over any federal building. In Martinique, a new flag was raised which symbolises the same ties to Africa.

==Derivative flags==
===Flags of nation states===

A number of flags of nation states in African and the Caribbean have been inspired by the UNIA flag. The Biafran flag is another variant of the UNIA flag with a sunburst in the center. Designed by the Biafran government and first raised in 1967, the colors are directly based on Garvey&#x27;s design.

The flag of Malawi issued in 1964 is very similar, reflects the Black Nationalist flag&#x27;s order of stripes. It is not directly based on Garvey&#x27;s flag, although the colors have the same symbolism: Red for blood symbolizing the struggle of the people, green for vegetation, and black for the race of the people.

The Kenyan flag (Swahili: Bendera ya Kenya) is a tricolor of black, red, and green with two white fimbriations imposed, with a Masai shield and two crossed spears. It was officially adopted on 12 December 1963 after Kenya&#x27;s independence, inspired by the pan-African tricolour.

The flag of Saint Kitts and Nevis has similar colors, arranged diagonally and separated by yellow lines. It similar to the Malawian flag in that the colors are not directly taken from the Pan-African flag but the symbolism is the same.

===Derivative flags in the United States===

====The Kwanzaa Bendera====
In the 1960s The Us Organization redesigned the UNIA flag also changing order and significance of the colours to: black, red and green. Defining &quot;black&quot; for the people, &quot;red&quot; for struggle, and &quot;green&quot; for the future built &quot;out of struggle&quot;.

United States Postal Service issued a stamp in 1997 to commemorate the African-American festival of Kwanzaa with a painting by artist Synthia Saint James of a dark-skinned family wearing garments traditional in parts of Africa and fashionable for special occasions among African-Americans. The family members are holding food, gifts, and a flag. The flag in the stamp may have been meant to represent the Pan-African flag but instead used the similar flag (a black, red, and green horizontal tricolour) of the Black nationalist organisation Us Organization, which shares its founder, professor and activist Maulana Karenga, with Kwanzaa.

The &quot;bendera&quot; (flag in the Kiswahili language) was documented as an supplemental symbol of Kwanzaa, in Karenga&#x27;s 1998 book &quot;The African American Holiday of Kwanzaa&quot;, and included in ceremonial use during the festival.

====Artworks====

In 1990, artist David Hammons created a work called &quot;African-American Flag&quot;, which is held by the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Based on the standard U.S. flag, its stripes are black and red, the canton field is green, and the stars on the canton field are black.
==Alternative names==

The flag goes by several other names with varying degrees of popularity:

*the Afro-American flag
*the Bendera Ya Taifa (Kiswahili for &quot;flag of the Nation&quot;), in reference to its usage during Kwanzaa
*the Black Liberation flag
*the International African flag
*the Marcus Garvey flag
*the UNIA flag, after its originators
*the Universal African flag
*the Red Black Green (RBG) flag
*the Black Nationalist flag

==Proposed holiday==
In 1999, an article appeared in the July 25 edition of &quot;The Black World Today&quot; suggesting that, as an act of global solidarity, every August 17 should be celebrated worldwide as Universal African Flag Day by flying the red, black, and green banner. August 17 is the birthday of Marcus Garvey.
