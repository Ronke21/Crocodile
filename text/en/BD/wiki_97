<text>The Chautauqua Institution ( ) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit education center and summer resort for adults and youth located on in Chautauqua, New York, northwest of Jamestown in the western southern tier of New York state. Established in 1874, the institution was the home of, and provided the impetus for, the Chautauqua movement that became popular in the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The Chautauqua Institution Historic District is listed on the National Register of Historic Places and was further designated a National Historic Landmark.

==History==
Chautauqua was founded in 1874 by inventor Lewis Miller and Methodist Bishop John Heyl Vincent as a teaching camp for Sunday-school teachers. The teachers would arrive by steamboat on Chautauqua Lake, disembark at Palestine Park and begin a course of Bible study that used the Park to teach the geography of the Holy Land.

The institution has operated each summer since then, gradually expanding its season length and program offerings in the arts, education, religion, and music. It offers educational activities to the public during the season, with public events including popular entertainment, theater, symphony, ballet, opera, and visual arts exhibitions. The institution also offers a variety of recreational activities, plus a community education program called Special Studies along with residential programs of intensive study provided for students aiming for professional careers who audition for admittance into Chautauqua&#x27;s Schools of Performing and Visual Arts.

The physical setting of the institution defined its development as an assembly. The grounds are on the west shoreline of upper Chautauqua Lake. The early tent-camp assembly gave way to cottages and rooming houses, and then hotels, inns and eventually condominiums.

Founder Lewis Miller&#x27;s daughter, Mina Miller Edison (wife of inventor Thomas Edison) offered literary classes in Fort Myers, Florida, through the Valinda Society. After completing courses, students were given Chautauqua diplomas.

In 1973, the National Park Service added the Institution to the National Register of Historic Places. In 1989, the Department of the Interior designated it a National Historic Landmark District consisting of most of the Institution property between NY 394, formerly NY 17J, the lake and (roughly) Lowell and North Avenues.

==Institution programs==
Every summer during its nine-week season, Chautauqua Institution provides an array of programs including fine and performing arts, lectures, worship services, and religious programs, as well as recreational activities. Nearly 100,000 visitors come to Chautauqua to participate in these programs and events annually. Summer admission to Chautauqua is by &quot;gate ticket,&quot; which allows entrance into the grounds, use of Smith Memorial Library, use of public beaches and parks, and attendance at lectures and concerts. There is an additional charge for some courses, for films shown at the Chautauqua Cinema, for opera and theater tickets, and use of the tennis courts and golf courses. Cottages and rooms are available for long or short term rental.

===Weekly programs===

Programs offered during the week at Chautauqua include devotional services and a lecture on a social, political, or academic issue in the morning, a religious or political topic in the afternoon, and a night of entertainment as the evening program. This evening Amphitheater event may be a symphony concert by the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra, a dance program by the Chautauqua Ballet Company, or a show by an individual guest artist. During most weeks, there is at least one opportunity to catch an opera and a play put on by Chautauqua&#x27;s resident summer companies. Operas are performed in English at Norton Hall, a 1930s-era, art-deco structure. There are also regularly scheduled organ recitals on the Massey Memorial Organ, student recitals, masterclasses, forums, and seminars for the sophisticated.

A broad range of special courses in music, art, dance, drama, and general topics are available. The Chautauqua Schools of Music offers extremely competitive programs with scholarships. George Gershwin visited Chautauqua as a summer refuge to compose parts of his &quot;Concerto in F&quot; in a small, wooden piano studio.

Sundays at Chautauqua feature worship services, both denominational and ecumenical. There is an afternoon Amphitheater program, such as a military band or student dance program. On Sundays, entrance to the Institution grounds is free.

===Special events===

There is an annual program held on the first Tuesday of each August called &quot;Old First Night.&quot; The event is the &quot;birthday party&quot; for the institution, marking the anniversary of the opening of the first season in 1874. Several of the Chautauqua facilities will host fundraisers, including the Old First Night Run, a fun run around the grounds, hosted by the Chautauqua Sports Club, a lip-sync contest called Air Band hosted by the Chautauqua Boys&#x27; and Girls&#x27; Club, and a bake sale hosted by the Chautauqua Children&#x27;s Club. All money raised goes to the Chautauqua Fund.

Another Chautauqua favorite is the Fourth of July show at the Amphitheater specializing in patriotic-themed music followed by area fireworks viewed from the Chautauqua Lake. Occasional town barbecues at the town square (called Bestor Plaza) and weekly sailboat races are part of the overall unique Chautauqua experience.

===Children&#x27;s programs===
The Children&#x27;s School, established in 1921, is a developmental preschool for youth ages 3–5 and was a pioneering program in the field of nursery-school education. The program consists of social, recreational, and educational activities that often incorporate other Chautauqua programs in the areas of music, drama, art, and recreation.

The Chautauqua Boys and Girls Club is one of the oldest day camps in the United States, founded in 1893. While parents are engaging in various activities around the grounds, their children meet in a special area by the lake and participate in sports, art, and recreational games, such as volleyball, sailing, swimming, field games, and pottery.

===Institution facilities===
The institution&#x27;s grounds, located between New York State Route 394 and Chautauqua Lake, include public buildings, administrative offices, a library, movie theater, bookstore, hotel, condominiums, inns, rooming houses, and many private cottages available for rent during the season. There are about 400 year-round residents, but the population can increase up to 7,500 guests per day during the summer season. The Institution is mostly a pedestrian community with bikes and scooters widely used along with a 12-mph speed limit for cars when authorized to be on the grounds. There are several parking lots located on the periphery that visitors utilize and then walk or bike into the institution:
* The 4,000-seat Amphitheater was demolished in September 2016 to make way for a new theater-style structure, paying homage to the old structure. The new 4,500-seat Amphitheater, completed during the 2016–17 off-season, in time for the institution&#x27;s 2017 season, features modern amenities and facilities and improved accessibility. This project caused some controversy due to historic nature of the old facility.
* The Athenaeum Hotel located on the grounds is the only hotel owned and operated by the institution. The 156-room hotel, said to be the largest wooden building in the eastern United States, was built in the Second Empire style in 1881. It has a two-story porch supported by narrow columns, with a central, mansard-covered tower. Although the number of hotel rooms has steadily declined on the grounds in the past thirty years, there has been a corresponding growth in condominiums.
* Palestine Park is a walk-around, landscaped, geographically scaled map of Palestine showing the general contour of the area, including mountains, valleys, bodies of water and the cities in their correct geographical locations, that existed in the first century CE. Throughout the week, there are multiple tours to discuss the historical and religious significance of this world-famous area.

* The Elizabeth S. Lenna Hall is 8,000 square foot recital and rehearsal hall, dedicated in 1993. This facility was the first significant program facility to be built at the Chautauqua Institution in 65 years. The building serves as the rehearsal facility for the Chautauqua Symphony Orchestra and Music School Festival Orchestra and as a recital hall for chamber music, voice and piano.
* The Lewis Miller Cottage, the residence of Chautauqua co-founder Lewis Miller, was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1965. Erected at Chautauqua in 1875, the cottage was considered one of the earliest prefabricated structures in the United States. Mina Miller Edison, Miller&#x27;s daughter, spent summers there with her husband, inventor Thomas Alva Edison.

===The Chautauqua Prize ===

The Chautauqua Prize is an annual American literary award established by the Chautauqua Institution in 2012. The winner receives and all travel and expenses for a one-week summer residency at Chautauqua. It is a &quot;national prize that celebrates a book of fiction or literary/narrative nonfiction that provides a richly rewarding reading experience and honors the author for a significant contribution to the literary arts.&quot;

=== Chautauqua Declaration ===
The Chautauqua Declaration is an annual declaration made at the Chautauqua Institution supporting international efforts to bring human rights violators to justice. The first declaration occurred following a meeting of current and former international chief prosecutors of international criminal tribunals and special courts in 2007. The declaration marked the 100th anniversary of the Hague Convention of 1907 and included prosecutors from the Nuremberg trials through to the International Criminal Court. In August 2017, the Tenth Chautauqua Declaration was made, signed by prosecutors from the International Criminal Court, International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, Special Tribunal for Lebanon, Special Court for Sierra Leone and the Khmer Rouge Tribunal.

==The Chautauqua movement==

In the late 19th century, following the model of the Chautauqua Institution, the Chautauqua movement spread throughout the United States and was highly popular until the start of World War II. By the mid-1920s, when circuit Chautauquas were at their peak, they appeared in over 10,000 communities to audiences of more than 45 million. The movement combined several concepts prevalent in the post-civil war US, including:

* The Lyceum movement which attempted to raise the level of public education with lectures, readings, and entertainment with goals of lifelong learning and self-improvement.
* Camp meetings and revivals which used outdoor gatherings
* Sunday School for the purpose of religious education.

The ideals of the Chautauqua Institution spread throughout the United States through many Independent Chautauqua assemblies. Popping up were a series of traveling Chautauqua meetings, which incorporated many of the program&#x27;s components, including lectures, music, nondenominational religious studies, and a focus on current issues. Several Independent Chautauquas have survived into the 21st century.

==Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle==
The Chautauqua Literary and Scientific Circle (CLSC), founded in 1878 by Vincent, is one of America&#x27;s oldest continuously operating book clubs. It was founded to promote self-learning and study, particularly among those unable to attend institutions of higher learning. Six to nine books are added to the reading list each year, with authors generally coming to Chautauqua to discuss their writing and to talk with readers.

==Famous visitors==
The Chautauqua Institution has been visited by political figures, celebrities, artists, musicians, scientists, and writers.

Since its founding in 1874, the Institution has been visited by four sitting United States presidents including Ulysses S. Grant (1875), Theodore Roosevelt (1905), Franklin Delano Roosevelt (1936), and Bill Clinton (1996). It was at the Chautauqua Institution Amphitheater that Franklin Delano Roosevelt addressed a crowd of more than 12,000 with his historic “I hate war” speech in 1936. Future President James A. Garfield visited in 1880 and future President William McKinley visited Chautauqua Institution when he was the governor of Ohio in 1895.

United States Supreme Court Justice Robert H. Jackson was a lifelong attendee and lecturer at Chautauqua. John Q. Barrett wrote, &quot;For almost fifty years, Chautauqua was a major part of Jackson’s expanding horizons, intellectual development, study and leisure—it was one of the places he loved best, and it deserves much credit for making him what he became (as he does for advancing it).&quot; Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Anthony Kennedy, and Sandra Day O&#x27;Connor lectured at Chautauqua during their tenure on the bench. Future Supreme Court Justice Stanley Forman Reed spoke at Chautauqua in July 1937 while serving as the United States Solicitor General. Future Justice Thurgood Marshall lectured at Chautauqua in August 1957 while serving as a director and chief counsel of the NAACP.

The Institution has been visited by other historically notable figures including William James, Booker T. Washington, Susan B. Anthony, Amelia Earhart, and Eric Foner. Celebrities from the performing arts who performed at Chautauqua include John Philip Sousa, Duke Ellington, Ella Fitzgerald, Lucille Ball, and Johnny Mathis; and contemporary artists such as Rhiannon Giddens, Leann Rimes, Jimmie Johnson, Toby Keith, Harry Connick Jr., Ben Folds, and Clay Aiken.

In August 2022 author Salman Rushdie was stabbed multiple times at Chautauqua when he was about to give a public lecture.

== Security at the Chautauqua Institution ==

Questions were raised about Chautauqua Institution after the stabbing of Salman Rushdie, although a state trooper and a sheriff&#x27;s officer were present at the event. Michael Hill, president of the Chautauqua Institution, stated that the Institution had ensured that law enforcement officers were present for the event. He described the assault on Rushdie as &quot;unlike anything in [the institution&#x27;s] nearly 150-year history&quot;. However, one eyewitness claimed that there was no security onstage. One attendee noted that while food and drinks was prevented from being brought into the event, there was no screening for weapons.

It was alleged that the leadership of the Chautauqua Institution disregarded recommendations for security precautions because they felt it would alienate the audience from the speakers. Following the attack, the Chautauqua Institution announced it would require guests to furnish photo IDs to get a Sunday gate pass, which previously could be secured anonymously on Sundays, when there is no fee for entry. Carried bags larger than a wristlet will also be banned in the amphitheater.

<doc id="271050" wikidata="Q5059890" url="?curid=271050" title="Center for Talented Youth">
<text>The Johns Hopkins Center for Talented Youth (CTY) is a gifted education program for school-age children founded in 1979 by psychologist Julian Stanley at Johns Hopkins University. It was established as a research study into how academically advanced children learn and became the first program to identify academically talented students through above-grade-level testing and provide them with challenging learning opportunities.

CTY offers summer, online, and family programs to students from around the world and has nearly 30,000 program enrollments annually. CTY is accredited for students in grades K to 12 by the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools.

CTY published the &quot;Imagine&quot; magazine that provided educational opportunities and resources and student-written content for middle and high school students. The magazine was discontinued in June 2018.

== History ==

=== Background ===

Dr. Julian Stanley, a psychology professor at Johns Hopkins University, launched the initial talent search in 1972, aiming to discover and support intellectually gifted students. Initially named SMPY (The Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth), the program primarily focused on nurturing mathematical aptitude. In 1980, the CTY Summer Programs officially commenced, offering educational opportunities during the summer at St. Mary&#x27;s College of Maryland.

=== Beginnings ===

The Center for Talented Youth (CTY) traces its origins back to the Office of Talent Identification and Development (OTID), which marked the early stages of the organization. OTID emerged through the merger of Dr. Julian Stanley&#x27;s Study for Mathematically Precocious Youth (SMPY) and the Program for Verbally Gifted Youth (PVGY). Subsequently, the program was renamed the Center for the Advancement of Academically Advanced Youth (CTY). Initially, Dr. William C. George served as the first Director of the integrated program, a position later assumed by Dr. William G. Durden in 1982. In the beginning, the residential program was established in St. Mary&#x27;s, with 109 students participating in its inaugural year. However, in 1980, CTY expanded its reach by initiating a Talent Search across the United States to identify gifted students. While the program at St. Mary&#x27;s concluded by the end of the 1981 summer, CTY&#x27;s growth was propelled by two locations: Carlisle and Lancaster, which played a significant role in shaping the organization&#x27;s present-day stature.

=== Growth of organization ===

In the summer of 1982, Carlisle and Lancaster took over the operations previously held at St. Mary&#x27;s and have continued to run their programs ever since. The partnership between Franklin &amp; Marshall and Dickinson College played a crucial role in popularizing CTY. In 1986, Saratoga Springs became another location, further expanding the summer camp. CTY introduced a commuter program for young students in 1985, followed by the addition of a residential Young Students program in 1992, which included sites like Sandy Spring. Los Angeles also joined the CTY network in 1992, contributing to the organization&#x27;s growing number of sites and enrolled students. In the same year, the Centre for Talented Youth in Ireland was established in Dublin. By 1992, CTY had approximately 6,000 students enrolled in summer programs across twelve sites in the United States and abroad. With CTY&#x27;s expanding presence, the organization recognized the need to create a comprehensive name for their institution, giving rise to IAAY, the Institute for the Academic Advancement of Youth.

=== IAAY and the start of CAA ===

On July 1, 1995, the organization adopted the name IAAY (Institute for the Academic Advancement of Youth). The former Executive Director, Dr. William G. Durden, expressed that this change would enable the organization to better address the challenges of talent advancement in the 21st century and work more effectively with individual students. Under Dr. Durden&#x27;s leadership, IAAY introduced the Center for Academic Advancement (now known as the Center for Academic Explorations) to increase flexibility and accommodate students who narrowly missed the test score requirements of CTY. This expansion allowed more students to participate in CTY programs while still benefiting from engaging and accelerated learning. The CAA program was launched in Bethlehem and Frederick in the summer of 1996 and expanded to include additional sites in Santa Cruz and the Marine Site at the University of Notre Dame - Maryland. By 1998, the total number of CAA sites reached 16. As the organization approached the turn of the century, they recognized that the name &quot;Center for Talented Youth&quot; better reflected their mission, leading to the official change back to CTY on January 1, 2000.

=== Trials and tribulations in the early 21st century ===

After reverting to the name Center for Talented Youth (CTY), the organization embarked on a period of expansion by adding more sites and programs. In 2000, Alexandria for Young Students was introduced, followed by Bristol in 2001 as part of the Center for Academic Advancement. In 2002, the Civic Leadership Institute was established at the Peabody Institute in Baltimore, Maryland. CTY y expanded to Tempe, Arizona, and Kaneohe, Hawaii, aiming to broaden its reach. However, these projects had a short lifespan, as the Arizona site closed in 2005 and the Hawaii site closed in 2009, despite its popularity in the later years. The organization also ventured into the international arena, launching two international branches in 2007: Nanjing, China, held at the Hopkins-Nanjing Center, and Puebla, Mexico, at the Universidad de las Americas. The programs, particularly the one in Nanjing, were well-received, leading CTY to establish an additional site in Madrid, Spain. The Center faced challenges during the 2008 Recession, resulting in the closure of several sites between 2008 and 2010, including Loudonville, Puebla, Mexico, Madrid, Spain, San Francisco, Kaneohe, Monterrey, Mexico, and Nanjing, China, marking a difficult period for CTY. However, the organization persevered in its mission to provide accelerated learning opportunities worldwide. In 2010, Dr. Lea Ybarra stepped down as site director, and on August 1, 2011, Dr. Elaine Tuttle Hansen assumed the position. Although CTY discontinued its international sites, it began the process anew with the establishment of the Hong Kong site.

=== 2011–2021 ===

As of 2016, over 1.5 million students had participated in CTY&#x27;s Talent Search. In 2016, over 28,000 students participated in CTY programs. Summer Programs were over 9,000 and CTY Online had over 13,000 enrollments. In 2016, CTY had summer programs running at 21 different sites, along with two international sites in Hong Kong and Anatolia, Greece. In 2018, CTY had instituted a new program to be at Yale University entitled the Institute for Advanced Cultural and Critical Studies.

=== 2022 Collapse ===

In 2022, about one-third of CTY&#x27;s summer sessions were canceled at the last minute—when some students were reportedly already en route to the CTY sites—due to a lack of staffing and staff background checks not clearing in time. Subsequently, Johns Hopkins provost Sunil Kumar removed executive director Virginia Roach and replaced her with Stephen Gange, a professor and executive vice provost for academic affairs. Kumar also promised an investigation into the incident, described by the Washington Post as a &quot;partial collapse.&quot; An open letter from CTY staff to the community described several organizational reasons for the lack of staffing, including the program&#x27;s failure to obtain state-mandated security clearances for staff, inadequate COVID testing and monitoring policies, and a stated plan to dismiss without pay any staff who contracted COVID. Affected students found an outlet for their outrage on Facebook, where they called CTY the &quot;Fyre Festival of Nerd Camps&quot;.

Amy Shelton, PhD, became executive director of CTY in October 2022. For summer 2024, CTY is offering 11 program sites, all in the United States.

== Admission requirements ==
CTY first requires students to sign up for an account and membership, which costs $50 for U.S. students and $60 for international students. They must then submit scores from a qualifying test to determine if they are at &quot;Advanced CTY-Level&quot; (defined as showing ability four grade levels above current enrolled grade) or &quot;CTY-Level&quot; (defined as showing ability two grade levels above current enrolled grade). These scores would then &quot;qualify&quot; her/him for CTY courses at the level achieved. Eligible test scores include the SCAT, PSAT, SAT, ACT, and STB (Spatial Test Battery). Students receive their course eligibility results online.

=== Awards Ceremony of 2023 ===
In February 2023, CTY hosted an awards ceremony for current and incoming CTY students for their &quot;exceptional performance on the SAT, ACT, SCAT, or similar assessment taken as part of an international talent search.&quot; About 15,300 students from 76 countries participated in CTY&#x27;s talent search in the 2021-22 school year, and 27 percent of them qualified for the awards ceremony. Based on their performance on these tests, they either received High or Grand Honors certificates and medals, along with receptions from notable CTY alumni.

== Tuition and Financial Aid ==
In 2024, On-Campus Summer Programs ranged in tuition from $3,099 to $6,819 (USD). In the 2023-24 School Year, online and synchronous, or &quot;LIVE&quot; courses, cost $1,125, asynchronous courses cost $955-$1,455, session-based courses cost $695-$2,130, and clubs cost $185-$380.

Full-time JHU staff can apply for 50% tuition remission.

Families are allowed to apply for financial aid if their child is a United States citizen, an eligible permanent U.S. resident with a green card, or permanently resides in the United States. Families must also not owe any tuition or fees from a previous year&#x27;s CTY program.

<doc id="271051" wikidata="Q1293298" url="?curid=271051" title="Demophilus of Constantinople">
<text>Demophilus of Constantinople (; died 386) was a bishop of Berea and an Archbishop of Constantinople from Early 370 until he was expelled on 27 November 380.

== Biography ==
Born of good family in Thessalonica, he was elected by the Arians to the bishopric of Constantinople. The opinion of the populace, however, was much divided. The orthodox party chose Evagrius for their bishop, and he was ordained by Eustathius of Antioch, the deposed bishop of Antioch. This was the signal for a furious outburst from the Arians. Both Eustathius and Evagrius were banished by the Roman emperor Valens, and their followers bitterly persecuted.

Soon after his accession, Demophilus went to Cyzicus with Dorotheus, or Theodorus, of Heraclea to procure the election of an Arian bishop, which was left vacant since the banishment of Eunomius of Cyzicus. Nevertheless, the people of Cyzicus refused to acknowledge them until they had anathematized Aëtius of Antioch, Eunomius of Cyzicus, and their followers. They were then permitted to ordain a bishop chosen by the people. The bishop who was ordained straightway and clearly taught the consubstantial faith.

In 380 Roman emperor Theodosius I made the patriarchate of Demophilus memorable. Theodosius I offered to confirm him in his see if he would accept the Nicene Creed. Demophilus refused and was immediately ordered to give up his church. He then called his followers together and retired, with Lucius of Alexandria and others, to a church outside of the city walls. The churches of Constantinople, which had for forty years been in Arian hands, were now restored to the orthodox; and similarly in other cities. It was in fact a re-establishment of Catholicism.

Philostorgius adds that Demophilus went to his own city, Berea; however this must have been some time afterwards, or he must have returned from exile, for he represented the Arian party at the synod in Constantinople in 383. The same writer says that Demophilus was wont to throw everything into confusion, especially the doctrines of the Catholic Church, and quotes from a sermon at Constantinople, in which he spoke of the human nature of the Saviour as lost in the divine, as a glass of milk when poured into the sea.

<doc id="271052" wikidata="Q39093" url="?curid=271052" title="Rottweiler">
<text>The Rottweiler (, , ) is a breed of domestic dog, regarded as medium-to-large or large. The dogs were known in German as , meaning Rottweil butchers&#x27; dogs, because their main use was to herd livestock and pull carts laden with butchered meat to market. This continued until the mid-19th century when railways replaced droving. Although still used to herd stock in many parts of the world, Rottweilers are now also used as search and rescue dogs, guard dogs, and police dogs.

==History==

According to the FCI Standard, the Rottweiler is considered to be one of the oldest surviving dog breeds. Its origin goes back to Roman times. These dogs were kept as herder or driving dogs. They marched over the Alps with the Roman legions, protecting the humans and driving their cattle. In the region of Rottweil, these dogs met and mixed with the native dogs in a natural crossing. The main task of the Rottweiler now became the driving and guarding of the herds of cattle and the defence of their masters and their property. This breed acquired its name from the old free city of Rottweil and was known as the &quot;Rottweil butcher&#x27;s dog&quot;. The butchers bred this type of dog purely for performance and usefulness. In due course, a first rate watch and driving dog evolved which could also be used as a draught dog.

The buildup to World War I saw a great demand for police dogs, which led to a revival of interest in the Rottweiler. During the First and Second World Wars, Rottweilers saw service in various roles, including as messenger, ambulance, draught, and guard dogs.

The Deutscher Rottweiler-Klub (DRK, &quot;German Rottweiler Club&quot;), the first Rottweiler club in Germany, was founded on 13 January 1914, and followed by the creation of the Süddeutscher Rottweiler-Klub (SDRK, &quot;South German Rottweiler Club&quot;) on 27 April 1915 and eventually became the IRK (International Rottweiler Club). The DRK counted around 500 Rottweilers, and the SDRK 3,000 Rottweilers. The goals of the two clubs were different. The DRK aimed to produce working dogs and did not emphasise the morphology of the Rottweiler.

The various German Rottweiler Clubs amalgamated to form the Allgemeiner Deutscher Rottweiler Klub (ADRK, &quot;General German Rottweiler Club&quot;) in 1921. This was officially recorded in the register of clubs and associations at the district court of Stuttgart on 27 January 1924. The ADRK is recognised worldwide as the home club of the Rottweiler.

In 1931, the Rottweiler was officially recognised by the American Kennel Club. In 1936, Rottweilers were exhibited in Britain at Crufts. In 1966, a separate register was opened for the breed. In fact, in the mid-1990s, the popularity of the Rottweiler reached an all-time high, as it was the most registered dog by the American Kennel Club. In 2017, the American Kennel Club ranked the Rottweiler as the eighth-most popular purebred dog in the United States.

==Description==
The &quot;Fédération Cynologique Internationale&quot; gives the following description of the Rottweiler standard: &quot;Rottweiler breeders aim at a dog of abundant strength, black coated with clearly defined rich tan markings, whose powerful appearance does not lack nobility and which is exceptionally well suited to being a companion, service, rescue and working dog.&quot;

===Head===
The skull is of medium length, relatively broad between the ears. The forehead line is moderately arched as seen from the side, with the occipital bone well developed without being conspicuous. The stop is relatively strong. Frontal groove not too deep.

The Rottweiler nose is well developed, more broad than round, with relatively large nostrils and always black. The muzzle should appear neither elongated nor shortened in relation to the cranial region. The ratio between the length of the muzzle and the length of the skull is about 1 to 1.5. The nasal bridge is straight, broad at the base and moderately tapered.
The lips are black and close fitting with the corner of the mouth not visible. The gums should be black, or as dark as possible. Both the upper and lower jaws are strong and broad. According to the FCI Standard Rottweilers should have strong and complete dentition (42 teeth) with scissor bite, the upper incisors closely overlapping the lower incisors. The zygomatic arches should be pronounced (but not exaggerated).

Upper and lower jaw strong and broad. Strong, complete dentition (42 teeth) with scissor bite, the upper incisors overlapping the lower incisors.
The eyes should be of medium size, almond-shaped and dark brown in colour. The eyelids are close fitting and should not droop. The ears are medium-sized, pendant, triangular, wide apart, and set high on the head. With the ears laid forward close to the head, the skull appears to be broadened. The skin on the head is tight fitting overall. When the dog is alert, the forehead may be slightly wrinkled.

Faults: Hound-type head. Narrow, light too short, long, coarse or excessively molossoid head; excessively broad skull, (lack of stop, too little stop or too strong stop). Very deep frontal groove. Foreface long, pointed or too short muzzle (any muzzle shorter than 40 percent of the length of the head is too short). split nose; Roman nose (convex nasal bridge) or dish-faced (concave nasal bridge); aquiline nose, pale or spotted nose (butterfly nose). Pincer bite. Molars of the underjaw not standing in one line.

Severe Faults: Too molossoid type and heavy general appearance.

===Neck===
The neck is strong, of fair length, well-muscled, slightly arched, clean, free from throatiness, without excessive dewlap.

===Body===
The back is straight, strong and firm. The loins are short, strong and deep. The croup is broad, of medium length, and slightly rounded, neither flat nor falling away. The chest is roomy, broad and deep (approximately 50% of the shoulder height) with a well-developed forechest and well sprung ribs. The flanks are not tucked up.

===Tail===
The FCI 2018 Standard states:
Historically the tail was traditionally docked at the first or second joint. However, docking is now banned in most countries and this is reflected in the FCI Country of Origin Breed Standard.

Although once &quot;preferred&quot; in early Standards, in 2018 the FCI Standard was amended to classify the Natural Bob Tail (aka &quot;Stumpy&quot;) as a &quot;Disqualifying Fault&quot; along with &quot;kink tail, ring-tail, with strong lateral deviation.&quot;

===Limbs===
When seen from the front, the front legs are straight and not placed close to each other. The forearm, seen from the side, stands straight and vertical. The slope of the shoulder blade is about 45 degrees. The shoulders are well laid back. The upper arm is close fitting to the body. The forearm is strongly developed and muscular. Pasterns are slightly springy, strong but not steep. The front feet are round, tight and well arched, the pads hard, nails are short, black and strong.

When seen from behind, the rear legs are straight and not too close together. When standing free, obtuse angles are formed between the dog&#x27;s upper thigh and the hip bone, the upper thigh and the lower thigh, and the lower thigh and metatarsal. The upper thigh is moderately long, broad and strongly muscled. The lower thigh is long, strongly and broadly muscled, sinewy. The hocks are sturdy, well-angulated, not steep. The hind feet are slightly longer than the front feet. Toes are strong, arched, as tight as the front feet.

===Gait===
According to the FCI Standard:

According to the American Kennel Council the traditional gait of a Rottweiler is a trot. Therefore, the Rottweiler is a trotter. Trotting in this breed is by no means a fault and is required. This movement comes naturally to the Rottweiler and should appear as such; any deviation may lead to a disqualification in the show ring. While walking, the Rottweiler&#x27;s legs, both front and hind, should move in a straight forward and backward manner. As with the straight movement of the legs, the path the Rottweiler moves in should also be straight. The Rottweiler&#x27;s gait is all about balance and effectiveness as the breed is still used as a herder today.

===Coat===
The coat consists of an outer coat and an undercoat. The outer coat is of medium length, coarse, dense and flat. The undercoat should be present on the neck and thighs. The undercoat must not show through the outer coat. Rottweilers living in hot climates may have acclimatised and may be missing the undercoat. Rottweiler coats tend to be low maintenance, although they experience heavy shedding before their seasons (females) or seasonally (males). According to American Kennel Club breed standards, a Rottweiler&#x27;s coat is short and straight. A coat that is long or wavy is considered a flaw to the AKC.

===Colour and markings===
The colour and markings of a Rottweiler are very distinctive. According to the FCI Standard a Rottweiler is always &quot;black with clearly defined markings of a rich tan on the cheeks, muzzle, throat, chest and legs, as well as over both eyes and under the base of the tail&quot;

The American Kennel Club calls for mahogany or rust-colored markings that do not take up more than ten percent of the dog&#x27;s body color. All Rottweilers standard to AKC specifications have one mahogany dot above each eye on the inner brow ridge, on the cheeks, one strip on each side of the snout; cheek markings do not cross over the bridge of the nose, the top of the nose should remain black. The markings on the face should move down onto the dog&#x27;s throat. On the chest, a Rottweiler will have two downward-facing triangular marks. On each front leg, the marks will stretch from the forearm to the toes. On the hind legs, the markings will begin on the inside and move outward onto the stifle, then out onto the hock stretching to the toes as well. AKC standards recognize that the black base color is not completely voided on the rear pasterns. There is a patch of rust or mahogany underneath the tail that resembles a triangle as well. A thin strip of black should be present on each of the Rottweiler&#x27;s toes.

===Size===
Technically a &quot;medium / large&quot; breed, according to the FCI standard the Rottweiler stands 61–69 cm (24–27 in) at the withers for males, 56–63 cm (22–25 in) for females, and the weight must be between 50 and 60 kg (110 and 132 lbs) for males and 35 and 48 kg (77 and 105 lbs) for females. Weight must be relative to height.

==Temperament==
One study published in 2008 found that male Rottweilers have higher confidence, sharpness, and defense and play drives than females.

A 2008 study surveying breed club members found that while Rottweilers were average in aggressiveness (bites or bite attempts) towards owners and other dogs, it indicated they tend to be more aggressive than average toward strangers. This aggression appears correlated with watchdog and territorial instincts.

In the &quot;Rottweiler Handbook&quot;, Joan H. Walker states that &quot;The Rottweiler is very territorial&quot;, meaning that the owner will have to regularly work with the dog to control its territorial aggressiveness.

==Working style==

According to the American Kennel Club, Rottweilers have a natural gathering style with a strong desire to control. They generally show a loose eye and have a great amount of force while working well off the stock. They make much use of their ability to intimidate.

The Rottweiler often carries the head on an even plane with the back, or carries the head up but with the neck and shoulders lowered. Some females lower the entire front end slightly when using their eyes. Males also do this when working far off the stock in an open field. This is rarely seen in males when working in confined spaces such as stock yards.

The Rottweiler has a reasonably good natural balance, force-barks when necessary, and when working cattle uses a very intimidating charge. There is a natural change in forcefulness when herding sheep. When working cattle, it may use its body and shoulders and for this reason should be used on horned stock with caution.

The Rottweiler, when working cattle, searches out the dominant animal and challenges it. Upon proving its control over that animal it settles back and tends to its work.

Some growers have found that Rottweilers are especially suited to move stubborn stock that simply ignore Border Collies, Kelpies, and others. Rottweilers use their bodies to physically force the stubborn animal to do its bidding if necessary.

When working with sheep, the Rottweiler shows a gathering/fetching style and reams directions easily. It drives sheep with ease.

If worked on the same stock for any length of time, the Rottweiler tends to develop a bond with the stock and will become quite affectionate with them as long as they do as it directs.

The Rottweiler is also exceptionally suited for and is commonly used in many dog sports including Agility and Schutzhund.

==Health==

A 2022 study in England of patient records found the average life expectancy of the Rottweiler to be 8 years, lower than the average of 12 years. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 10.6 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds. A 2024 Italian study found a life expectancy of 9 years for the breed compared to 10 years overall. A survey of breed club members found the most common cause of death in the Rottweiler to be cancer, with more than 45% of deaths in the breed being attributed to cancers.

The Rottweiler is prone to several skin conditions these include: acral lick dermatitis, calcinosis cutis, lupoid onychodystrophy, malignant histiocytic sarcoma, systemic histiocytosis, vasculopathy, and vitiligo. Follicular lipidosis is a skin condition found in red point dogs such as the Rottweiler.

An American study reviewing over a million cases presented to 27 veterinary teaching hospitals in North America found the Rottweiler to be prediposed to canine hip dysplasia, with 10.53% of dogs having the condition compared to 3.52% overall. This same study found the Rottweiler to also have the second highest prevalence of cranial cruciate ligament deficiency (CCLD) with 8.29% of dogs having the condition compared to an overall rate of 2.55%. For dogs diagnosed with both conditions the Rottweiler once again had the second highest prevalence with 1.34% having both hip dysplasia and CCLD compared to 0.3% overall. Another American study of over a million and a quarter of a million hip and elbow evaluation records in dogs over the age of 2 years found a prevalence of 20.1% for hip dysplasia and 38.1% for elbow dysplasia, the second highest in the study.

One study found the Rottweiler to be prediposed to gastric dilatation volvulus. However another study did not find a predisposition.

==Media portrayal==
The Rottweiler is often portrayed in media as being dangerous or aggressive.

Some films and television shows, such as &quot;Lethal Weapon 3&quot;, the 1998 film &quot;Half Baked&quot;, and the hit HBO show &quot;Entourage&quot;, have portrayed Rottweilers in a positive light. They are also featured in the children&#x27;s book series &quot;Good Dog, Carl&quot; by Alexandra Day.

In an event widely reported by the media, a two-year-old UK Rottweiler named Jake owned by Liz Maxted-Bluck was recognised for his bravery by the RSPCA. The dog was out walking with his owner when they heard screams. Jake chased off a man as he molested a woman on Hearsall Common, Coventry, in July 2009. He located the attacker and his victim in thick scrub, chased off the attacker, led his owner to the scene, then stood guard over the victim until the police arrived. The attacker was convicted of serious sexual assault and jailed for four years. Jake was nominated by police for the bravery award and medallion after the incident. Det. Con Clive Leftwich, from the Coventry police station, said: &quot;From our point of view Jake the Rottweiler stopped a serious sexual assault from becoming even worse.&quot;

<text>A hermit, also known as an eremite (adjectival form: hermitic or eremitic) or solitary, is a person who lives in seclusion. Eremitism plays a role in a variety of religions.

==Description==
In Christianity, the term was originally applied to a Christian who lives the eremitic life out of a religious conviction, namely the Desert Theology of the Old Testament (i.e., the 40 years wandering in the desert that was meant to bring about a change of heart).

In the Christian tradition the eremitic life is an early form of monastic living that preceded the monastic life in the cenobium. In chapter 1, the Rule of St Benedict lists hermits among four kinds of monks. In the Roman Catholic Church, in addition to hermits who are members of religious institutes, the Canon law (canon 603) recognizes also diocesan hermits under the direction of their bishop as members of the consecrated life. The same is true in many parts of the Anglican Communion, including the Episcopal Church in the United States, although in the canon law of the Episcopal Church they are referred to as &quot;solitaries&quot; rather than &quot;hermits&quot;.

Often, both in religious and secular literature, the term &quot;hermit&quot; is used loosely for any Christian living a prayer-focused life, and sometimes interchangeably with anchorite/anchoress, recluse, and &quot;solitary&quot;. Other religions, including Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam (Sufism), and Taoism, afford examples of hermits in the form of adherents living an ascetic way of life.

In modern colloquial usage, &quot;hermit&quot; denotes anyone living apart from the rest of society, or having entirely or in part withdrawn from society, for any reason.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;hermit&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;ĕrēmīta&quot;, the latinisation of the Greek ἐρημίτης (&quot;erēmitēs&quot;), &quot;of the desert&quot;, which in turn comes from ἔρημος (&quot;erēmos&quot;), signifying &quot;desert&quot;, &quot;uninhabited&quot;, hence &quot;desert-dweller&quot;; adjective: &quot;eremitic&quot;.

==History==

===Tradition===
In the common Christian tradition the first known Christian hermit in Egypt was Paul of Thebes (fl. 3rd century), hence also called &quot;St. Paul the first hermit&quot;. Antony of Egypt (fl. 4th century), often referred to as &quot;Antony the Great&quot;, is perhaps the most renowned of all the early Christian hermits owing to the biography by Athanasius of Alexandria. An antecedent for Egyptian eremiticism may have been the Syrian solitary or &quot;son of the covenant&quot; (Aramaic &quot;bar qəyāmā&quot;) who undertook special disciplines as a Christian.

Christian hermits in the past have often lived in isolated cells or hermitages, whether a natural cave or a constructed dwelling, situated in the desert or the forest. People sometimes sought them out for spiritual advice and counsel. Some eventually acquired so many disciples that they no longer enjoyed physical solitude. Some early Christian Desert Fathers wove baskets to exchange for bread.

In medieval times, hermits were also found within or near cities where they might earn a living as gate keepers or ferrymen. In the 10th century, a rule for hermits living in a monastic community was written by Grimlaicus. In the 11th century, the life of the hermit gained recognition as a legitimate independent pathway to salvation. Many hermits in that century and the next came to be regarded as saints. From the Middle Ages and down to modern times, eremitic monasticism has also been practiced within the context of religious institutes in the Christian West.

In the Catholic Church, the Carthusians and Camaldolese arrange their monasteries as clusters of hermitages where the monks live most of their day and most of their lives in solitary prayer and work, gathering only briefly for communal prayer and only occasionally for community meals and recreation. The Cistercian, Trappist, and Carmelite orders, which are essentially communal in nature, allow members who feel a calling to the eremitic life, after years living in the cenobium or community of the monastery, to move to a cell suitable as a hermitage on monastery grounds. There have also been many hermits who chose that vocation as an alternative to other forms of monastic life.

===Anchorites===

The term &quot;anchorite&quot; (from the Greek &quot;anachōreō&quot;, signifying &quot;to withdraw&quot;, &quot;to depart into the country outside the circumvallate city&quot;) is often used as a synonym for hermit, not only in the earliest written sources but throughout the centuries. Yet the anchoritic life, while similar to the eremitic life, can also be distinct from it. Anchorites lived the religious life in the solitude of an &quot;anchorhold&quot; (or &quot;anchorage&quot;), usually a small hut or &quot;cell&quot;, typically built against a church. The door of an anchorage tended to be bricked up in a special ceremony conducted by the local bishop after the anchorite had moved in. Medieval churches survive that have a tiny window (&quot;squint&quot;) built into the shared wall near the sanctuary to allow the anchorite to participate in the liturgy by listening to the service and to receive Holy Communion. Another window looked out into the street or cemetery, enabling charitable neighbors to deliver food and other necessities. Clients seeking the anchorite&#x27;s advice might also use this window to consult them.

==Contemporary Christian life==

===Catholicism=== 
Catholics who wish to live in eremitic monasticism may live that vocation as a hermit:
* in an eremitic order, for example Carthusian or Camaldolese (in the latter one affiliate oblates may also live as hermits)
* as a diocesan hermit under the canonical direction of their bishop (canon 603, see below)

There are also lay people who informally follow an eremitic lifestyle and live mostly as solitaries. Not all the Catholic lay members that feel that it is their vocation to dedicate themselves to God in a prayerful solitary life perceive it as a vocation to some form of consecrated life. An example of this is life as a Poustinik, an Eastern Catholic expression of eremitic living that is finding adherents also in the West.

====Eremitic members of religious institutes====

In the Catholic Church, the institutes of consecrated life have their own regulations concerning those of their members who feel called by God to move from the life in community to the eremitic life, and have the permission of their religious superior to do so. The Code of Canon Law contains no special provisions for them. They technically remain a member of their institute of consecrated life and thus under obedience to their religious superior.

The Carthusian and Camaldolese orders of monks and nuns preserve their original way of life as essentially eremitic within a cenobitical context, that is, the monasteries of these orders are in fact clusters of individual hermitages where monks and nuns spend their days alone with relatively short periods of prayer in common.

Other orders that are essentially cenobitical, notably the Trappists, maintain a tradition under which individual monks or nuns who have reached a certain level of maturity within the community may pursue a hermit lifestyle on monastery grounds under the supervision of the abbot or abbess. Thomas Merton was among the Trappists who undertook this way of life.

====Diocesan hermits====

The earliest form of Christian eremitic or anchoritic living preceded that of being a member of a religious institute, since monastic communities and religious institutes are later developments of the monastic life. Bearing in mind that the meaning of the eremitic vocation is the Desert Theology of the Old Testament, it may be said that the desert of the urban hermit is that of their heart, purged through kenosis to be the dwelling place of God alone.

So as to provide for men and women who feel a vocation to the eremitic or anchoritic life without being or becoming a member of an institute of consecrated life, but desire its recognition by the Roman Catholic Church as a form of consecrated life nonetheless, the 1983 Code of Canon Law legislates in the Section on Consecrated Life (canon 603) as follows:

Canon 603 §2 lays down the requirements for diocesan hermits. 

The Catechism of the Catholic Church of 11 October 1992 (§§918–921), comments on the eremitic life as follows:

Catholic Church norms for the consecrated eremitic and anchoritic life do not include corporal works of mercy. Nevertheless, every hermit, like every Christian, is bound by the law of charity and therefore ought to respond generously, as his or her own circumstances permit, when faced with a specific need for corporal works of mercy. Hermits are also bound by the law of work. If they are not financially independent, they may engage in cottage industries or be employed part-time in jobs that respect the call for them to live in solitude and silence with extremely limited or no contact with other persons. Such outside jobs may not keep them from observing their obligations of the eremitic vocation of stricter separation from the world and the silence of solitude in accordance with canon 603, under which they have made their vow. Although canon 603 makes no provision for associations of hermits, these do exist (for example the Hermits of Bethlehem in Chester, NJ, and the Hermits of Saint Bruno in the United States; see also lavra, skete).

===Anglicanism===
Many of the recognised religious communities and orders in the Anglican Communion make provision for certain members to live as hermits, more commonly referred to as solitaries. One Church of England community, the Society of St. John the Evangelist, now has only solitaries in its British congregation. Anglicanism also makes provision for men and women who seek to live a single consecrated life, after taking vows before their local bishop; many who do so live as solitaries. The &quot;Handbook of Religious Life&quot;, published by the Advisory Council of Relations between Bishops and Religious Communities, contains an appendix governing the selection, consecration, and management of solitaries living outside recognised religious communities.

In the Canon Law of the Episcopal Church (United States), those who make application to their diocesan bishop and who persevere in whatever preparatory program the bishop requires, take vows that include lifelong celibacy. They are referred to as solitaries rather than hermits. Each selects a bishop other than their diocesan as an additional spiritual resource and, if necessary, an intermediary. At the start of the twenty-first century, the Church of England reported a notable increase in the number of applications from people seeking to live the single consecrated life as Anglican hermits or solitaries. A religious community known as the Solitaries of DeKoven, who make Anglican prayer beads and Pater Noster cords to support themselves, are an example of an Anglican hermitage.

===Eastern Orthodoxy===
In the Orthodox Church and Eastern Rite Catholic Churches, hermits live a life of prayer as well as service to their community in the traditional Eastern Christian manner of the poustinik. The poustinik is a hermit available to all in need and at all times. In the Eastern Christian churches, one traditional variation of the Christian eremitic life is the semi-eremitic life in a lavra or skete, exemplified historically in Scetes, a place in the Egyptian desert, and continued in various sketes today, including several regions on Mount Athos.

==Notable Christian hermits==

===Early and Medieval Church===
* Paul of Thebes, 4th century, Egypt, regarded by St. Jerome as the first hermit

==Other religions==
From a religious point of view, the solitary life is a form of asceticism, wherein the hermit renounces worldly concerns and pleasures. This can be done for many reasons, including: to come closer to the deity or deities they worship or revere, to devote one&#x27;s energies to self-liberation from saṃsāra, etc. This practice appears also in ancient Śramaṇa traditions, Buddhism, Jainism, Hinduism, Kejawèn, and Sufism. Taoism also has a long history of ascetic and eremitic figures. In the ascetic eremitic life, the hermit seeks solitude for meditation, contemplation, prayer, self-awareness, and personal development on physical and mental levels, without the distractions of contact with human society, sex, or the need to maintain socially acceptable standards of cleanliness, dress, or communication. The ascetic discipline can also include a simplified diet and/or manual labor as a means of support.

===Judaism===
* The Baal Shem Tov, founder of Hasidism, lived for many years as a hermit in the Carpathian Mountains.
* Rabbi Nachman of Bratzlav, the Baal Shem Tov&#x27;s great-grandson, also spent much time in seclusion and instructed his disciples to set aside at least one hour a day for secluded contemplation and prayer. Some followers of Rabbi Nachman devoted themselves to seclusion, such as Rabbi Shmuel of Dashev and two generations later, Rabbi Abraham Chazan.
* Rabbi Yosef Yozel Horowitz, known as the &quot;Alter (Elder) of Novardok&quot;, succeeded his master Rabbi Yisrael Salanter in disseminating the pietistic teachings of the Lithuanian Mussar Movement. He too spent much time in seclusion, including one year during which he confined himself to a sealed room, attended by a few devoted followers.

===Buddhism===

* U Khandi, religious figure in Burma who lived as a hermit and meditated at the Mandalay Thakho hill and Shwe-myin-tin hill.
* Ajahn Mun Bhuridatta Thera, who is credited for establishing the Thai Forest Tradition, spent his monastic life wandering through Thailand, Burma, and Laos, dwelling for the most part in the forest, engaged in the practice of meditation.
* Luang Pu Waen Suciṇṇo, highly respected monk of Thai Forest Tradition, who lived alone, practiced alone in forests, and preferred seclusion.

===Other notable hermits===
* Wang Fu a Han dynasty recluse left society because of the eunuchs around the Three Kingdoms period in history. He was a Confucian who wrote &quot;Qianfu Lun&quot;.
* Lü Shang or the T&#x27;ai Kung lived in seclusion after King Zhou ignored him. He was a general who butchered cows in the street and fished with unique hooks or none at all. King Wen of Zhou found him, and in some traditions wrote the six secret teachings. 
* Yi Yin severed King Jie of the Xia dynasty. He was ignored by society, planted fields, and loved to watch them grow. King Tang came and helped found the Shang dynasty. Some say that he was a cook, which was how he won King Tang over, but Mencius rejected this.
* Lin Bu (林逋), a Song dynasty poet who spent much of his later life in solitude, while admiring plum blossoms, on a cottage by West Lake in Hangzhou.
* Ramana Maharshi, the renowned Hindu philosopher and saint who meditated for several years at and around the hillside temple of Thiruvannamalai in Southern India.

==In literature==
* In medieval romances, the knight-errant frequently encounters hermits on his quest. Such a figure, generally a wise old man, would advise him. Knights searching for the Holy Grail, in particular, learn from a hermit the errors they must repent for, and the significance of their encounters, dreams, and visions. Evil wizards would sometimes pose as hermits, to explain their presence in the wilds, and to lure heroes into a false sense of security. In Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot;, both occurred: the knight on a quest met a good hermit, and the sorcerer Archimago took on such a pose. These hermits are sometimes also vegetarians for ascetic reasons, as suggested in a passage from Sir Thomas Malory&#x27;s &quot;Le Morte d&#x27;Arthur&quot;: &quot;Then departed Gawain and Ector as heavy (sad) as they might for their misadventure (mishap), and so rode till that they came to the rough mountain, and there they tied their horses and went on foot to the hermitage. And when they were (had) come up, they saw a poor house, and beside the chapel a little courtelage (courtyard), where Nacien the hermit gathered worts (vegetables), as he had tasted none other meat (food) of a great while.&quot; The practice of vegetarianism may have also existed amongst actual medieval hermits outside of literature.
* Hermits appear in a few of the stories of Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;The Decameron&quot;. One of the most famous stories, the tenth story of the third day, involves the seduction of a young girl by a hermit in the desert near Gafsa; it was judged to be so obscene that it was not translated into English until the 20th century.
* The Three Hermits is a famous short story by Russian author Leo Tolstoy written in 1885 and first published in 1886, with its shock ending, featured the 3 hermits as the titular characters. The main character of Tolstoy&#x27;s short story &quot;Father Sergius&quot; is a Russian nobleman who turns to a solitary religious life and becomes a hermit after he learns that his fiancée was a discarded mistress of the czar.
* Friedrich Nietzsche, in his influential work, &quot;Thus Spoke Zarathustra&quot;, created the character of the hermit Zarathustra (named after the Zoroastrian prophet Zarathushtra), who emerges from seclusion to extol his philosophy to the rest of humanity.

<text>Carnitine is a quaternary ammonium compound involved in metabolism in most mammals, plants, and some bacteria. In support of energy metabolism, carnitine transports long-chain fatty acids from the cytosol into mitochondria to be oxidized for free energy production, and also participates in removing products of metabolism from cells. Given its key metabolic roles, carnitine is concentrated in tissues like skeletal and cardiac muscle that metabolize fatty acids as an energy source. Generally individuals, including strict vegetarians, synthesize enough L-carnitine in vivo.

Carnitine exists as one of two stereoisomers: the two enantiomers -carnitine (&quot;S&quot;-(+)-) and -carnitine (&quot;R&quot;-(−)-). Both are biologically active, but only -carnitine naturally occurs in animals, and -carnitine is toxic as it inhibits the activity of the -form. At room temperature, pure carnitine is a whiteish powder, and a water-soluble zwitterion with relatively low toxicity. Derived from amino acids, carnitine was first extracted from meat extracts in 1905, leading to its name from Latin, &quot;caro/carnis&quot; or flesh.

Some individuals with genetic or medical disorders (such as preterm infants) cannot make enough carnitine, requiring dietary supplementation. Despite common carnitine supplement consumption among athletes for improved exercise performance or recovery, there is insufficient high-quality clinical evidence to indicate it provides any benefit.

== Biological role ==
The primary biological functions of carnitine in humans include the following:
* fatty acid transport across the mitochondrial membrane by forming long-chain acylcarnitine esters which are shuttled into the mitochondria, where they undergo β-oxidation to produce ATP, the cell&#x27;s main energy currency;
* acetyl-CoA and coenzyme A stabilization by transferring acetyl groups for maintaining metabolic flexibility and energy production, particularly during fasting or exercise;
* detoxification of acyl groups by forming acylcarnitine, which is then excreted to prevent the accumulation of potentially toxic fatty acyl intermediates;
* regulation of cellular metabolism by participating in the conversion and utilization of different fuel sources, enabling cells to switch between carbohydrate and fatty acid metabolism as needed;
* antioxidant action to protect cells from oxidative stress (caused by free radical toxicity) and damage.

== Biochemistry ==
=== Chemical properties ===
Carnitine is a zwitterion, meaning it has both positive and negative charges in its structure. In an aqueous solution, L-carnitine is freely soluble and its ionizable groups, COO− and N+(CH3)3, are over 90% dissociated at physiological pH (~7.4) for humans.

=== Biosynthesis and metabolism ===
==== Physiological effects in humans ====
As an example of normal biosynthesis of carnitine in humans, a person would produce 11–34 mg of carnitine per day. Adults eating mixed diets of red meat and other animal products ingest some 60–180 mg of carnitine per day, while vegans consume about 10–12 mg per day. Most (54–86%) carnitine obtained from the diet is absorbed in the small intestine before entering the blood. The total body content of carnitine is about in a person weighing , with nearly all of it contained within skeletal muscle cells. Carnitine metabolizes at rates of about 400 μmol (65 mg) per day, an amount less than 1% of total body stores.

==== Biosynthesis in eukaryotes ====
Many eukaryotes have the ability to synthesize carnitine, including humans. Humans synthesize carnitine from the substrate TML (6-&quot;N&quot;-trimethyllysine), which is in turn derived from the methylation of the amino acid lysine. TML is then hydroxylated into hydroxytrimethyllysine (HTML) by trimethyllysine dioxygenase (TMLD), requiring the presence of ascorbic acid and iron. HTML is then cleaved by HTML aldolase (HTMLA, a pyridoxal phosphate requiring enzyme), yielding 4-trimethylaminobutyraldehyde (TMABA) and glycine. TMABA is then dehydrogenated into gamma-butyrobetaine in an NAD+-dependent reaction, catalyzed by TMABA dehydrogenase. Gamma-butyrobetaine is then hydroxylated by gamma butyrobetaine hydroxylase (a zinc binding enzyme) into -carnitine, requiring iron in the form of Fe2+.

==== Fatty acid transport ====
Carnitine is involved in transporting fatty acids across the mitochondrial membrane, by forming a long chain acetylcarnitine ester and being transported by carnitine palmitoyltransferase I and carnitine palmitoyltransferase II.

==== Acetyl-CoA stabilization ====
Carnitine plays a role in stabilizing acetyl-CoA and coenzyme A levels through the ability to receive or give an acetyl group.

==== Tissue distribution of carnitine-biosynthetic enzymes in humans ====
The tissue distribution of carnitine-biosynthetic enzymes in humans indicates TMLD to be active in the liver, heart, muscle, brain and highest in the kidneys. HTMLA activity is found primarily in the liver. The rate of TMABA oxidation is greatest in the liver, with considerable activity also in the kidneys.

=== Carnitine shuttle system ===
The free-floating fatty acids, released from adipose tissues to the blood, bind to carrier protein molecule known as serum albumin that carry the fatty acids to the cytoplasm of target cells such as the heart, skeletal muscle, and other tissue cells, where they are used for fuel. Before the target cells can use the fatty acids for ATP production and β oxidation, the fatty acids with chain lengths of 14 or more carbons must be activated and subsequently transported into mitochondrial matrix of the cells in three enzymatic reactions of the carnitine shuttle.

The first reaction of the carnitine shuttle is a two-step process catalyzed by a family of isozymes of acyl-CoA synthetase that are found in the outer mitochondrial membrane, where they promote the activation of fatty acids by forming a thioester bond between the fatty acid carboxyl group and the thiol group of coenzyme A to yield a fatty acyl–CoA.

In the first step of the reaction, acyl-CoA synthetase catalyzes the transfer of adenosine monophosphate group (AMP) from an ATP molecule onto the fatty acid generating a fatty acyl–adenylate intermediate and a pyrophosphate group (PPi). The pyrophosphate, formed from the hydrolysis of the two high-energy bonds in ATP, is immediately hydrolyzed to two molecules of Pi by inorganic pyrophosphatase. This reaction is highly exergonic which drives the activation reaction forward and makes it more favorable. In the second step, the thiol group of a cytosolic coenzyme A attacks the acyl-adenylate, displacing AMP to form thioester fatty acyl-CoA.

In the second reaction, acyl-CoA is transiently attached to the hydroxyl group of carnitine to form fatty acylcarnitine. This transesterification is catalyzed by an enzyme found in the outer membrane of the mitochondria known as carnitine acyltransferase 1 (also called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1, CPT1).

The fatty acylcarnitine ester formed then diffuses across the intermembrane space and enters the matrix by facilitated diffusion through carnitine-acylcarnitine translocase (CACT) located on the inner mitochondrial membrane. This antiporter returns one molecule of carnitine from the matrix to the intermembrane space for every one molecule of fatty acyl–carnitine that moves into the matrix.

In the third and final reaction of the carnitine shuttle, the fatty acyl group is transferred from fatty acyl-carnitine to coenzyme A, regenerating fatty acyl–CoA and a free carnitine molecule. This reaction takes place in the mitochondrial matrix and is catalyzed by carnitine acyltransferase 2 (also called carnitine palmitoyltransferase 2, CPT2), which is located on the inner face of the inner mitochondrial membrane. The carnitine molecule formed is then shuttled back into the intermembrane space by the same cotransporter (CACT) while the fatty acyl-CoA enters β-oxidation.

=== Regulation of fatty acid β oxidation ===
==== Balance ====
The carnitine-mediated entry process is a rate-limiting factor for fatty acid oxidation and is an important point of regulation.

==== Inhibition ====
The liver starts actively making triglycerides from excess glucose when it is supplied with glucose that cannot be oxidized or stored as glycogen. This increases the concentration of malonyl-CoA, the first intermediate in fatty acid synthesis, leading to the inhibition of carnitine acyltransferase 1, thereby preventing fatty acid entry into the mitochondrial matrix for β oxidation. This inhibition prevents fatty acid breakdown while synthesis occurs.

==== Activation ====
Carnitine shuttle activation occurs due to a need for fatty acid oxidation which is required for energy production. During vigorous muscle contraction or during fasting, ATP concentration decreases and AMP concentration increases leading to the activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). AMPK phosphorylates acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which normally catalyzes malonyl-CoA synthesis. This phosphorylation inhibits acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which in turn lowers the concentration of malonyl-CoA. Lower levels of malonyl-CoA disinhibit carnitine acyltransferase 1, allowing fatty acid import to the mitochondria, ultimately replenishing the supply of ATP.

=== Transcription factors ===
Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPAR&quot;α&quot;) is a nuclear receptor that functions as a transcription factor. It acts in muscle, adipose tissue, and liver to turn on a set of genes essential for fatty acid oxidation, including the fatty acid transporters carnitine acyltransferases 1 and 2, the fatty acyl–CoA dehydrogenases for short, medium, long, and very long acyl chains, and related enzymes.

PPAR&quot;α&quot; functions as a transcription factor in two cases; as mentioned before when there is an increased demand for energy from fat catabolism, such as during a fast between meals or long-term starvation. Besides that, the transition from fetal to neonatal metabolism in the heart. In the fetus, fuel sources in the heart muscle are glucose and lactate, but in the neonatal heart, fatty acids are the main fuel that require the PPAR&quot;α&quot; to be activated so it is able in turn to activate the genes essential for fatty acid metabolism in this stage.

=== Metabolic defects of fatty acid oxidation ===
More than 20 human genetic defects in fatty acid transport or oxidation have been identified. In case of fatty acid oxidation defects, acyl-carnitines accumulate in mitochondria and are transferred into the cytosol, and then into the blood. Plasma levels of acylcarnitine in newborn infants can be detected in a small blood sample by tandem mass spectrometry.

When &quot;β&quot; oxidation is defective because of either mutation or deficiency in carnitine, the ω (omega) oxidation of fatty acids becomes more important in mammals. The ω oxidation of fatty acids is another pathway for F-A degradation in some species of vertebrates and mammals that occurs in the endoplasmic reticulum of the liver and kidney, it is the oxidation of the ω carbon—the carbon farthest from the carboxyl group (in contrast to formula_1 oxidation which occurs at the carboxyl end of fatty acid, in the mitochondria).

==Deficiency==

Carnitine deficiency is rare in healthy people without metabolic disorders, indicating that most people have normal, adequate levels of carnitine normally produced through fatty acid metabolism. One study found that vegans showed no signs of carnitine deficiency. Infants, especially premature infants, have low stores of carnitine, necessitating use of carnitine-fortified infant formulas as a replacement for breast milk, if necessary.

Two types of carnitine deficiency states exist. Primary carnitine deficiency is a genetic disorder of the cellular carnitine-transporter system that typically appears by the age of five with symptoms of cardiomyopathy, skeletal-muscle weakness, and hypoglycemia. Secondary carnitine deficiencies may happen as the result of certain disorders, such as chronic kidney failure, or under conditions that reduce carnitine absorption or increase its excretion, such as the use of antibiotics, malnutrition, and poor absorption following digestion.

==Supplementation==
===Pharmacokinetics===
The plasma half-life of L-carnitine taken as a supplementation is approximately 17.4 hours.

===Evidence===
Despite widespread interest among athletes to use carnitine for improvement of exercise performance, inhibit muscle cramps, or enhance recovery from physical training, the quality of research for these possible benefits has been low, prohibiting any conclusion of effect. Despite some studies suggest that carnitine may improve high-intensity physical performance, and facilitate recovery after such performance, the results of these studies are inconclusive, since various studies used various regimens of carnitine supplementation and intensity of exercise. At supplement amounts of per day over a month, there was no consistent evidence that carnitine affected exercise or physical performance on moderate-intensity exercises, whereas on high-intensity exercises results were mixed. Carnitine supplements does not seem to improve oxygen consumption or metabolic functions when exercising, nor do they increase the amount of carnitine in muscle. The underlying mechanisms on how carnitine can improve physical performance, if at all, are not clearly understood. There is no evidence that L-carnitine influences fat metabolism or aids in weight loss.

=== Male fertility ===
The carnitine content of seminal fluid is directly related to sperm count and motility, suggesting that the compound might be of value in treating male infertility.

=== Diseases ===
Carnitine has been studied in various cardiometabolic conditions, indicating it is under preliminary research for its potential as an adjunct in heart disease and diabetes, among numerous other disorders. Carnitine has no effect on preventing all-cause mortality associated with cardiovascular diseases, and has no significant effect on blood lipids.

Although there is some evidence from meta-analyses that L-carnitine supplementation improved cardiac function in people with heart failure, there is insufficient research to determine its overall efficacy in lowering the risk or treating cardiovascular diseases.

There is only preliminary clinical research to indicate the use of L-carnitine supplementation for improving symptoms of type 2 diabetes, such as improving glucose tolerance or lowering fasting levels of blood glucose.

The kidneys contribute to overall homeostasis in the body, including carnitine levels. In the case of renal impairment, urinary elimination of carnitine increasing, endogenous synthesis decreasing, and poor nutrition as a result of disease-induced anorexia can result in carnitine deficiency. Carnitine has no effect on most parameters in end-stage kidney disease, although it may lower C-reactive protein, a biomarker for systemic inflammation. Carnitine blood levels and muscle stores can become low, which may contribute to anemia, muscle weakness, fatigue, altered levels of blood fats, and heart disorders. Some studies have shown that supplementation of high doses of -carnitine (often injected) may aid in anemia management.

== Sources ==
The form present in the body is -carnitine, which is also the form present in food. Food sources rich in -carnitine are animal products, particularly beef and pork. Red meats tend to have higher levels of -carnitine. Adults eating diverse diets that contain animal products attain about 23–135 mg of carnitine per day. Vegans get noticeably less (about 10–12 mg) since their diets lack these carnitine-rich animal-derived foods. Approximately 54% to 86% of dietary carnitine is absorbed in the small intestine, then enters the blood. Even carnitine-poor diets have little effect on total carnitine content, as the kidneys conserve carnitine.
In general, omnivorous humans each day consume between 2 and 12 μmol/kg of body weight, accounting for 75% of carnitine in the body. Humans endogenously produce 1.2 μmol/kg of body weight of carnitine on a daily basis, accounting for 25% of the carnitine in the body. Strict vegetarians obtain little carnitine from dietary sources (0.1 μmol/kg of body weight daily), as it is mainly found in animal-derived foods.

L-Carnitine, acetyl--carnitine, and propionyl--carnitine are available in dietary supplement pills or powders, with a daily amount of 0.5 to 1 g considered to be safe. It is also a drug approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat primary and certain secondary carnitine-deficiency syndromes secondary to inherited diseases.

== Drug interactions and adverse effects ==
Carnitine interacts with pivalate-conjugated antibiotics such as pivampicillin. Chronic administration of these antibiotics increases the excretion of pivaloyl-carnitine, which can lead to carnitine depletion. Treatment with the anticonvulsants valproic acid, phenobarbital, phenytoin, or carbamazepine significantly reduces blood levels of carnitine.

When taken in the amount of roughly per day, carnitine may cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and body odor smelling like fish. Other possible adverse effects include skin rash, muscle weakness, or seizures in people with epilepsy.

== History ==
Levocarnitine was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a new molecular entity under the brand name Carnitor on December 27, 1985.

<doc id="271059" wikidata="Q6125669" url="?curid=271059" title="Killing of Vincent Chin">
<text>Vincent Jen Chin (; May 18, 1955 – June 23, 1982) was an American draftsman of Chinese descent who was killed in a racially motivated assault by two white men, Chrysler plant supervisor Ronald Ebens and his stepson, laid-off autoworker Michael Nitz. Ebens and Nitz assailed Chin following a brawl that took place at a strip club in Highland Park, Michigan, where Chin had been celebrating his bachelor party with friends in advance of his upcoming wedding. Against the backdrop of high anti-Japanese sentiment in the United States at the time – known as &quot;Japan bashing&quot; – they had assumed that Chin was Japanese, and a witness described them using anti-Asian racial slurs as they attacked him, ultimately beating Chin to death.

Although accounts vary, the men were expelled from the club following a physical altercation. Ebens and Nitz eventually found Chin in front of a Highland Park McDonald&#x27;s. There, Nitz held Chin down while Ebens repeatedly bashed him with a baseball bat until Chin&#x27;s head cracked open. Chin was taken to Henry Ford Hospital in Detroit, where he died of his injuries four days later. In their first trial, Ebens and Nitz accepted a plea bargain to reduce the charges from second-degree murder to manslaughter.

Wayne County Circuit Court Judge Charles Kaufman sentenced Ebens and Nitz to three years&#x27; probation and a $3,000 fine, but no jail time. Explaining his rationale, Kaufman said that Ebens and Nitz &quot;weren&#x27;t the kind of men you send to jail ... You don&#x27;t make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal.&quot; Described by the president of the Detroit Chinese Welfare Council as a &quot;$3,000 license to kill&quot;, the lenient sentence led to an uproar from Asian Americans and spurred the community into activism. The advocacy group American Citizens for Justice (ACJ) was formed to protest the sentencing. The case has since been viewed as a critical turning point for Asian American civil rights engagement and a rallying cry for stronger federal hate crime legislation.

==Background==
Vincent Chin was born on May 18, 1955, in Guangdong province, Mainland China. He was the only child of Bing Hing &quot;David&quot; Chin (a.k.a. C.W. Hing) and Lily Chin (&quot;née&quot; Yee). Chin&#x27;s father earned the right to bring a Chinese bride into the United States through his service in World War II. After Lily suffered a miscarriage in 1949 and was unable to have children, the couple adopted Vincent from a Chinese orphanage in 1961.

Throughout most of the 1960s, Chin grew up in Highland Park. In 1971, after the elderly Hing was mugged, the family moved to Oak Park, Michigan. Vincent Chin graduated from Oak Park High School in 1973, going on to study at Control Data Institute and Lawrence Tech. At the time of his death, Chin was employed as an industrial draftsman at Efficient Engineering, an automotive supplier, and waiting tables at the Golden Star restaurant in Ferndale, Michigan on weekends. He was engaged to be married on June 28, 1982.

During an economic recession in the early 1980s, the decline of the auto industry provoked resentment toward imported Japanese cars in Detroit, which was the center of the automotive industry in the United States. &quot;Japan bashing&quot; became popular with politicians, such as U.S. representative from Michigan John Dingell, who blamed &quot;little yellow men&quot; for domestic automakers&#x27; misfortune. Nationwide, Anti-Asian racism often accompanied campaigns urging consumers to &quot;Buy American&quot;.

==Killing==

On June 19, 1982, Chin was having a bachelor party at the Fancy Pants Club in Highland Park to celebrate his upcoming wedding with three of his friends: Jimmy Choi, Gary Koivu, and Robert Siroskey. Seated across the stage from them were two white men, Chrysler plant supervisor Ronald Ebens and his stepson, laid-off autoworker Michael Nitz. According to an interview by American documentary filmmaker Michael Moore for the &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot;, after Chin gave a white stripper a generous gratuity, Ebens shouted, &quot;Hey, you little motherfuckers!&quot; and told an African-American dancer, &quot;Don&#x27;t pay any attention to those little fuckers, they wouldn&#x27;t know a good dancer if they&#x27;d seen one.&quot; Racine Colwell, a dancer at the bar, later testified that Ebens said, &quot;It&#x27;s because of you little motherfuckers that we&#x27;re out of work.&quot; This statement later provided the evidence for civil rights litigation against Ebens. He later claimed the argument was not about Chin&#x27;s race but the Black dancer&#x27;s gratuity. Another witness said he heard the anti-Chinese racial slur &quot;Chink&quot; being used towards Chin, while another man said Ebens told him &quot;I&#x27;ll give you $20 if you help us catch the Chinaman.&quot;

Ebens claimed that Chin walked over to him and Nitz and threw a punch at his jaw. The fight escalated as Nitz shoved Chin in defense of his stepfather, and Chin countered. One of the dancers reported that Ebens and Chin picked up chairs and started swinging them at each other. Nitz suffered a cut on his head from a chair that Ebens had intended to use to strike Chin. Chin and his friends left the room, while a bouncer led Ebens and Nitz to the restroom to clean up the wound. According to Ebens and Nitz, one of Chin&#x27;s friends, Robert Siroskey, came back inside to use the restroom and apologized to the group, stating that Chin had a few drinks due to his bachelor&#x27;s party. Ebens and Nitz had also been drinking that night, although not at the club, which did not serve alcohol. 

When Ebens and Nitz left the club, they encountered Chin and his friends who were waiting outside for Siroskey. Chin called Ebens a &quot;chicken shit&quot;, at which point Nitz retrieved a baseball bat from his car and Chin and his friends ran down the street. Ebens and Nitz searched the neighborhood for 20 to 30 minutes and paid another man 20 dollars to help look for Chin, before finding him at a nearby McDonald&#x27;s restaurant. Chin attempted to escape, but was held by Nitz while Ebens repeatedly bludgeoned Chin with a baseball bat until Chin&#x27;s head cracked open. Ebens was arrested and taken into custody at the scene of the crime by two off-duty police officers who had witnessed the beating. One of the officers said that Ebens wielded the bat like he was swinging &quot;for a home run&quot;. Michael Gardenhire, one of the police officers, called for an ambulance. Chin was rushed to Henry Ford Hospital and was comatose on arrival. He never regained consciousness and died four days later on June 23, 1982; Chin was only 27 years old.

==Legal proceedings==

===State criminal charges===
Ebens and Nitz were charged with second-degree murder, but accepted a plea bargain to reduce the charges to manslaughter. They were sentenced by Wayne County Circuit Judge Charles Kaufman to three years&#x27; probation and were each ordered to pay a $3,000 fine plus $780 in court costs, but received no jail time. 

Kaufman explained his light sentences based on Ebens&#x27; and Nitz&#x27;s lack of previous criminal records, their stability in the community, and his opinion that the two would not go on to harm anyone else. He said in justifying his decision that Ebens and Nitz &quot;weren&#x27;t the kind of men you send to jail&quot; and &quot;[y]ou don&#x27;t make the punishment fit the crime; you make the punishment fit the criminal&quot;. Kaufman argued that the assault was &quot;the continuation of a fight that Mr. Chin apparently started&quot;, and that had the incident been a case of self-defense, Ebens and Nitz &quot;would not be guilty of anything.&quot; Kaufman had been a Japanese-held prisoner of war during World War II, but denied that any anti-Asian sentiment had influenced his ruling.

The &quot;Detroit Free Press&quot; argued in an editorial that &quot;the overall handling of the Chin case seems disturbingly casual&quot;, remarking on the limited evidence presented at sentencing, the reduced charges due to plea bargaining, the lack of a prosecutor at the hearing to argue for a harsher sentence, and Kaufman&#x27;s disregarding of the pre-sentence report&#x27;s recommendation of imprisonment. The editorial concluded that the &quot;result was a process that made Vincent Chin&#x27;s life seem cheap and the criminal justice system either callous or perverse&quot;.

The lenient sentencing of Ebens and Nitz enraged the Asian-American communities in the Detroit area and across the United States, who saw it as a sign of public indifference toward racism directed at Asian-Americans.
The president of the Detroit Chinese Welfare Council said the verdict amounted to a &quot;$3,000 license to kill&quot; Chinese Americans.
Others across the country were spurred into activism; the advocacy group American Citizens for Justice (ACJ) was formed to protest the sentencing and began working toward a judicial appeal.
The ACJ quickly gained the support of diverse ethnic and religious groups, advocacy organizations, and politicians such as the Detroit City Council president and Congressman John Conyers.

===Federal civil rights charges===
Government officials, politicians, and several prominent legal organizations dismissed the theory that civil rights law should be applied to the death of Chin. The Detroit chapters of the American Civil Liberties Union and the National Lawyers Guild did not consider Chin&#x27;s killing a violation of his civil rights. At first, the ACJ was the only group that supported applying existing civil rights laws to Asian Americans. Eventually, the national body of the National Lawyers Guild endorsed its efforts.

Journalist Helen Zia and lawyer Liza Chan led the fight for federal charges, which resulted in the two killers being accused of two counts of violating Chin&#x27;s civil rights under title 18 of the United States Code. 

The 1984 federal civil rights case against the men found Ebens guilty of the second count and sentenced him to 25 years in prison; Nitz was acquitted of both counts. Ebens&#x27; conviction was overturned in 1986—a federal appeals court found that an attorney for the ACJ had improperly coached witnesses. Chin&#x27;s friend Jimmy Choi had at first supported Ebens&#x27; version of no racial animosity or epithets and that Chin threw a chair that injured Nitz, but he changed his statement after meeting the ACJ attorney. 

After the verdict, the ACJ once again mobilized to press the Department of Justice for a retrial, which took place in Cincinnati. U.S. District Judge Anna Diggs Taylor explained that Ebens could not be given a &quot;fair and impartial trial&quot; in Metro Detroit due to the &quot;saturation of publicity&quot; surrounding the case. This trial, before a mostly white and male jury, resulted in Ebens being acquitted on all charges.

===Civil suits===
A civil suit for the unlawful death of Chin was settled out-of-court in March 1987. Michael Nitz was ordered to pay $50,000. Ronald Ebens was ordered to pay $1.5 million, at $200/month for the first two years and 25% of his income or $200/month thereafter, whichever was greater. This represented the projected loss of income from Chin&#x27;s engineering position, as well as Lily Chin&#x27;s loss of Vincent&#x27;s services as a laborer and driver. Ebens left the state and stopped making payments in 1989.

In November 1989, Ebens reappeared in court for a creditor&#x27;s hearing, where he detailed his finances and reportedly pledged to make good on his debt to the Chin estate. However, in 1997, the Chin estate was forced to renew the civil suit, as it was allowed to do every ten years. With accrued interest and other charges, the adjusted total became $4,683,653.89. Ebens sought in 2015 to have the resulting lien against his house vacated.

==Aftermath and legacy==

Chin was interred in Detroit&#x27;s Forest Lawn Cemetery.
In September 1987, Chin&#x27;s mother, Lily, moved from Oak Park back to her hometown of Guangzhou, China, reportedly to avoid being reminded of her son&#x27;s death. She returned to the United States for medical treatment in late 2001 and died on June 9, 2002. Prior to her death, Lily Chin established a scholarship in Vincent&#x27;s memory, to be administered by the ACJ.
In 2010, the city of Ferndale, Michigan, erected a milestone marker at the intersection of Woodward Avenue and 9 Mile Road in memorial of the killing of Chin.

Chin&#x27;s case has been cited by some Asian Americans in support of the idea that they are considered &quot;perpetual foreigners&quot; in contrast to &quot;real&quot; Americans who are considered full citizens. Lily Chin stated: &quot;My son is beaten like an animal and, and the killer is not in jail. If this happened in China, [Ebens and Nitz] would be put in [an] electric chair. This is freedom and democracy? Why isn&#x27;t everybody equal?&quot; and &quot;What kind of law is this? What kind of justice? This happened because my son is Chinese. If two Chinese killed a white person, they must go to jail, maybe for their whole lives [...] Something is wrong with this country.&quot;

The attack was considered a hate crime by many but it predated the passage of hate crime laws in the United States.
Sociologist Meghan A. Burke writes that Chin&#x27;s killing prompted the creation of activist coalitions and a shared sense of pan-Asian identity for the first time in U.S. history.
The case has since been viewed as a turning point for Asian American civil rights engagement and a rallying cry for stronger federal hate crime legislation.

<doc id="271064" wikidata="Q13759" url="?curid=271064" title="Cagayan">
<text>Cagayan ( ), officially the Province of Cagayan (; ; ; Isnag: &quot;Provinsia nga Cagayan&quot;; Ivatan: &quot;Provinsiya nu Cagayan&quot;; ; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Cagayan Valley region, covering the northeastern tip of Luzon. Its capital is Tuguegarao, the largest city of that province as well as the regional center of Cagayan Valley. It is about northwest of Manila, and includes the Babuyan Islands to the north. The province borders Ilocos Norte and Apayao to the west, and Kalinga and Isabela to the south.

Cagayan was one of the early provinces that existed during the Spanish colonial period. Called &quot;La Provincia de Cagayan&quot;, its borders essentially covered the entire Cagayan Valley, which included the present provinces of Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, Batanes and portions of Kalinga, Apayao, and Aurora. The former capital was Nueva Segovia, which also served as the seat of the Diocese of Nueva Segovia. Today, only remain of the former vastness of the province. The entire region, however, is still referred to as Cagayan Valley.

==Etymology==
A folk legend holds that the name was originally derived from the &quot;tagay&quot;, a plant that grows abundantly in the northern part of the province. The term &quot;Catagayan&quot;, &quot;the place where the &quot;tagay&quot; grows&quot; was shortened to &quot;Cagayan&quot;. Linguists, however, hold that &quot;cagayan&quot; comes from an ancient, lost word that means &quot;river&quot;. Variations of this word—&quot;karayan&quot;, &quot;kayan&quot;, &quot;kahayan, kayayan&quot;, &quot;kagayan&quot; and &quot;kalayan&quot;—all mean &quot;river&quot;, referring to Cagayan River. It is said to have also shared etymology with Cagayan de Oro in Mindanao with the similar reference, also called Cagayan River.

==History==

===Early history===
Cagayan has a prehistoric civilization with rich and diverse culture. According to archaeologists, the earliest man in the Philippines probably lived in Cagayan thousands of years ago.

In the classical era, Gattaran and Lal-lo was the home of hunter-gatherers who specialized in hunting mollusks. These hunter-gatherers have stockpiled their leftover mollusk shells in numerous sites in Gattaran and Lal-lo, until eventually, the shells formed into the largest stock of shell-midden sites in the entire Philippines.

The &quot;Atta&quot; or Negritos were the first people in valley. They were later moved to the uplands or variably assimilated by the Austronesians, from whom the Ibanags, Itawes, Yogads, Gaddangs, Irayas and Malawegs descended - who actually came from one ethnicity. These are the people found by the Spaniards in the different villages along the rivers all over Cagayan. The Spaniards rightly judged that these various villagers came from a single racial stock and decided to make the Ibanag language the &quot;lingua franca&quot;, both civilly and ecclesiastically for the entire people of Cagayan which they called collectively as the &quot;Cagayanes&quot; which later was transliterated to become &quot;Cagayanos&quot;.

Cagayan was a major site for the Maritime Jade Road, one of the most extensive sea-based trade networks of a single geological material in the prehistoric world, operating for 3,000 years from 2000 BCE to 1000 CE.

Even before the Spaniards came to Cagayan, the Cagayanos have already made contact with various civilizations like the Chinese, Japanese and even Indians, as evidenced by various artifacts and even the presence of minor to moderate foreign linguistic elements in the languages of the natives.

Various other peoples, mainly the Ilocanos, Pangasinenses, Kapampangans and Tagalogs, as well as Visayans, Moros, Ivatans, and even foreigners like the Chinese, Indians, Arabs, Spaniards and others were further infused to the native Cagayanes to become the modern &quot;Cagayano&quot; that we know today.

The north coast was also the site of a Wokou state when the Japanese pirate-lord Tay Fusa set up his stronghold there before its destruction during the 1582 Cagayan battles.

===Spanish colonial era===
In 1581, Captain Juan Pablo Carreon arrived in Cagayan with a hundred fully equipped soldiers and their families by order of Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñaloza, the fourth Spanish Governor-General of the Philippines. The expeditionary force was sent to explore the Cagayan Valley, to convert the natives to Catholicism, and to establish ecclesiastical missions and towns throughout the valley.

On June 29, 1583, Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; Juan de Salcedo traced the northern coastline of Luzon and set foot on the Massi (Pamplona), Tular, and Aparri areas.

====La Provincia de Cagayan====
In 1583, through a Spanish Royal Decree, the entire northeastern portion of Luzon (specifically, all territories east of the Cordillera mountains and those north of the Caraballo mountains) including the islands in the Balintang Channel were organized into one large political unit called the &quot;La Provincia de Cagayán&quot;. The &quot;provincia&quot;&#x27;s territorial delineation encompassed the present provinces of Batanes, Isabela, Quirino, Nueva Vizcaya, including portions of Kalinga, Apayao, Mountain Province, Ifugao, and Aurora. Its capital was &quot;Nueva Segovia&quot; (the present municipality of Lal-lo). It was sometimes called &quot;Cagayán de Luzón&quot; to distinguish from other places bearing the name Cagayan.

The Spanish friars soon established mission posts in Camalaniugan and Lal-lo (&quot;Nueva Segovia&quot;), which became the seat of the Diocese established by Pope Clement VIII on August 14, 1595.

A founding population of 200 Spanish citizens from Europe accompanied by 100 soldiers set up settlements across Cagayan Valley. These people were in turn supplemented by 155 Latin American soldiers recruited from Mexico By the end of the 1700s, Zambales had 9,888 native families.

The see was moved in 1758 to Vigan because of its relative distance. The Spanish influence can still be seen in the massive churches and other buildings.

In 1839, Nueva Vizcaya was established as a politico-military province and was separated from Cagayan. Later, Isabela was founded as a separate province on May 1, 1856, its areas carved from southern Cagayan and eastern Nueva Vizcaya territories.

During the late 18th century, the New Spain government encouraged the expansion of trade and development of commodity crops. Among these was tobacco, and lands in Cagayan became the center of a vertically integrated monopoly: tobacco was grown there and shipped to Manila, where it was processed and made into cigarettes and cigars. The development of the related bureaucracy and accounting systems was done under the leadership of José de Gálvez, who as visitor-general to Mexico from 1765 to 1772 developed the monopoly there and increased revenues to the Crown. He worked in the Philippines as Minister of the Indies from 1776 to 1787, constructing a similar monopoly there under Governor-General Basco y Vargas (1778–1787). The Spanish development of this industry affected all their economic gains in the Philippines.

The establishment of the civil government of Cagayan through the 1583 Spanish Royal Decree is commemorated in the annual Aggao Nac Cagayan celebrations of the Provincial Government of Cagayan and its people.

===American era===
When the Treaty of Paris was signed in 1898, ending the Spanish–American War, the United States took over the Philippines. It influenced the culture, most notably in agriculture and education, as well as in public works and communications. A naval base also increased interaction between local Filipinos and American sailors and administrators. At the close of the 18th century, there were 29 municipalities in the province of Cagayan. After the Philippines came under American sovereignty in 1902, more municipalities were founded. Since then, due to centralization and shifting of populations, the number of municipalities is back to 29. A new wave of immigration began in the late 19th and 20th centuries with the arrival of another group of the Ilocano settlers who came in large numbers. They now constitute the largest group in the province, and it was only in this large-scale Ilocano immigration &amp; settlement that made Ilocano language replaced Ibanag as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the province.

===Japanese occupation===

During the Second World War, with air raids by Japanese fighters and bombers, the province of Cagayan suffered much destruction by bombing and later invasion. Japanese Imperial forces entered Cagayan in 1942. While under the Japanese Occupation, several pre-war infantry divisions and regular units of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were re-established during the period on January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946. They established general headquarters, camps and garrisoned troops in the province of Cagayan, and began operations against the Japanese Occupation forces in the Cagayan Valley. This included sending troops to the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela, and helping the local soldiers of the 11th and 14th Infantry Regiment of the USAFIP-NL, the local guerrilla fighters and the U.S. liberation forces. They fought against the Japanese Imperial forces from 1942 to 1945.

The Battle off Cape Engaño on October 26, 1944, was held off Cape Engaño. At that time American carrier forces attacked the Japanese Northern Force. This became the concluding action of the Battle of Leyte Gulf. The Japanese lost 4 carriers, 3 light cruisers and 9 destroyers.

In 1945, the combined United States and Philippine troops, together with the recognized guerrillas, took Cagayan. Part of the action were the Filipino soldiers of the 11th and 14th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFIP-NL liberated the province of Cagayan during the Second World War.

===Postwar Era===
After World War II Baldomero Perez of Tuguegarao was temporarily appointed as Governor of Cagayan by the Philippine Civil Affairs Unit, serving until he was replaced by Peregrino R. Quinto in 1946.

===During the Marcos dictatorship===

Beginning in the 1970s, Cagayan became known as a bailiwick of Juan Ponce Enrile of Gonzaga, who as Secretary and later Minister of National Defense became one of the most powerful figures during the Martial Law period under President Ferdinand Marcos. His influence enabled the construction of Port Irene, a modernized international harbor facility in Santa Ana that was named after Marcos&#x27; daughter Irene, which later formed the basis for the creation of the Cagayan Special Economic Zone and Freeport, whose enabling law was authored by Enrile as a Senator in 1995 and now includes Santa Ana and parts of Aparri. 

Loan-funded government spending to promote Ferdinand Marcos’ 1969 reelection campaign caused the Philippine economy took a sudden downwards turn in the last months of the 1960s. Known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, this led to social unrest throughout the country beginning with the First Quarter Storm protests of 1970, and incidents of violence like the Plaza Miranda bombing. Marcos responded by vilifying his critics as &quot;communists&quot; and suspending the privilege of the writ of habeas corpus through Proclamation No. 889 in August 1971, but this had the effect of pushing moderate student protesters towards the radical left, and causing many of them to go home to their home provinces like Cagayan. Marcos&#x27; actions thus lead the Marxist–Leninist–Maoist Communist Party of the Philippines to gain a significant presence in many Cagayan municipalities, although not as much in Tuguegarao itself.

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. In Tuguegarao, Camp Marcelo Adduru became the province&#x27;s main detention center for &quot;political detainees&quot;, who were often never formally charged with a crime, and thus technically not counted by Marcos as &quot;prisoners.&quot; Others disappeared without the trace for daring to speak against Marcos, such as Romeo Crismo, a teacher at Cagayan Teacher’s College and St. Louis College in Tuguegarao, who criticized the 1973 Philippine constitutional plebiscite as a sham election. He disappeared without a trace in August 1980 after unknown men tried to capture him in front of his students the day before. He was later honored by having his name inscribed on the wall of remembrance of the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, in recognition of his martyrdom while resisting authoritarianism.

During that time, logging concessions were awarded in the province by the Marcoses to Enrile and other cronies, leading to the severe degradation of forest cover in the province that contributed to widespread flooding and other environmental issues that persist today.

===During the People Power revolution=== 

Cagayan saw incidents of political violence during the 1986 Philippine presidential election, including the fatal shooting by militiamen of opposition leader Euginio Coloma in the municipality of Buguey.
A number of Cagayanon politicians played parts in the People Power Revolution two weeks after the election, and in the following one year in which the Philippines was under an interim provisional revolutionary government between 1986 and 1987. This included Enrile, whose failed attempt to lead a coup against Marcos was one of the precipitating events behind the revolution, and former Cagayan Governor Teresa J. Dupaya, who supported the opposition during the election and was re-appointed to her old post as Governor when the provisional government was established.

===Contemporary===

====Hotel Delfino siege ====

Cagayan was also the site of the Hotel Delfino Siege in Tuguegarao, which took place on March 4, 1990, when efforts to arrest suspended governor Rodolfo Aguinaldo for supporting rebellions against the government of President Corazon Aquino led to him storming the provincial capitol and taking hostages including his would-be arresting officer, Brigadier General Oscar Florendo of the Armed Forces of the Philippines Civil Relations Service. The stand-off deteriorated into a series of gun-battles throughout the town, with Florendo being killed presumably in a crossfire inside the hotel and Aguinaldo managing to escape and go into hiding before later surrendering and being cleared of legal charges by winning reelection in 1992. He was later elected congressman in 1998 but was assassinated by the New People&#x27;s Army in 2001.

====2020 Ulysses Flood ====

Cagayan has been heavily impacted by changing weather pattern changes resulting from climate change, with the 2020 Ulysses flood being counted as one of the most severe examples.

In November 2020, Typhoon Vamco (locally known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ulysses) crossed the country, dams from all around Luzon neared their spilling points, forcing them to release large amounts of water into their impounds including Magat Dam. The dam opened all of its 7 gates at , releasing over 5,037 cubic metres (1,331,000 US gal) of water into the Cagayan River flooding numerous riverside towns. Waters under the Buntun Bridge went up as high as , flooding the nearby barangays up to the roofs of houses. 

Because there was very little media coverage of the flooding in the area in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown in Luzon and the Shutdown of ABS-CBN broadcasting earlier that year, residents resorted to social media to request the national government for rescue. As a result of the catastrophe, the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) indicated that it would review its protocols regarding the release of water in Magat Dam and improve its watershed.

==Geography==


Situated within the Cagayan Valley region, the province is bounded by the Philippine Sea on the east; on the south by Isabela province; on the west by the Cordillera Mountains; and on the north by the Balintang Channel and the Babuyan Group of Islands. About from the northeastern tip of the province is the island of Palaui; a few kilometers to the west is Fuga Island. The Babuyan Group of Islands, which includes Calayan, Dalupiri, Camiguin, and Babuyan Claro, is about north of Luzon mainland.

The eastern coast forms the northern portion of the Sierra Madre mountain range, while the western limits are generally hilly to low in elevation. The central area, dominated by a large valley, forms the lower basin of the country&#x27;s longest river, the Cagayan. The mouth is located at the northern town of Aparri.

The province of Cagayan comprises an aggregate land area of which constitutes approximately three percent of the total land area of the country, making it the second largest province in the region.

===Administrative divisions===
Cagayan comprises 28 municipalities and one city divided into four congressional districts. It has 820 barangays. Tuguegarao City (as of December 18, 1999) is the provincial capital, regional seat, and center of business, trade, and education and the only city in the province.



===Barangays===
The 28 municipalities and 1 city of the province comprise a total of 820 barangays, with &quot;Ugac Sur&quot; in Tuguegarao City as the most populous in 2010, and &quot;Centro 15 (Poblacion)&quot; in Aparri as the least. If cities are excluded, &quot;Maura&quot; in Aparri has the highest population.
===Climate===
Cagayan has a tropical savannah climate (Aw) with hot days and warm nights that last year round.

==Demographics==
The population of Cagayan in the 2020 census was 1,268,603 people, with a density of .

The majority of people living in Cagayan are of Ilocano descent, mostly from migrants coming from the Ilocos Region. Originally, the more numerous groups were the Ibanags, who were first sighted by the Spanish explorers and converted to Christianity by missionaries, the reason why the Ibanag language had spread throughout the valley region prior to the arrival of the migrating Ilocanos. Cagayan is predominantly Roman Catholic with 85% of the population affiliated and the Aglipayan Church has a very strong minority in the province. The Iglesia Ni Cristo has three ecclesiastical districts in the province with 4-5% of the population.

Aside from Ilocanos and Ibanags, Malawegs, Itawits, Gaddangs, Isnags, groups of nomadic Aetas, as well as families of Ibatans who have assimilated into the Ibanag-Ilocano culture make Cagayan their home; Ibatans are native to Babuyan Island. More recently, a new group from the south, the Muslim Filipinos, have migrated to this province and have made a community for themselves. In addition to this, Tagalog-speaking peoples from Central Luzon and Southern Luzon have also settled in the area, as well as a few Pangasinans and Kapampangans from the central plains, and Cebuanos and Hiligaynons from Visayas and Mindanao. 

===Languages===
Major languages spoken are Ilocano followed by Ibanag, Yogad and Gaddang. Ilocanos and Ibanags speak Ilocano with an Ibanag accent, as descendants of Ilocanos from first generation in Cagayan who lived within Ibanag population learned Ibanag; same situation with Ilocano tinged by Gaddang, Paranan, Yogad, and Itawis accents when descendants of Ilocanos from first generation in Cagayan who lived within Gaddang, Paranan, Yogad, and Itawis populations learned their languages. People especially in the capital and commercial centers speak and understand English and Tagalog/Filipino. Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and Ibanags speak Tagalog with an Ibanag accent, as descendants of Tagalogs from first generation in Cagayan who lived within Ibanag population learned Ibanag. Other languages native in the province are Isnag, Itawis, &amp; Ivatan, the latter is native in Babuyan Island. Languages not native in the province are also spoken there such as Maranao, Maguindanaon, Tausug, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Cebuano and Hiligaynon to varying degrees by their respective ethnic communities within the province.

There are two endangered indigenous languages in Cagayan. These are the &quot;Dupaninan Agta&quot; language (with fewer than 1400 remaining speakers) and the &quot;Central Cagayan Agta&quot; language (with fewer than 799 remaining speakers); both of these are listed as &quot;Vulnerable&quot; according to the UNESCO &quot;Atlas of the World&#x27;s Endangered Languages&quot;. All remaining speakers of the languages are among the community&#x27;s elders. Without a municipality-wide teaching mechanism of the two endangered languages for the youth where the languages are present, the languages may be extinct within 3-5 decades, making them languages in grave peril unless a teaching-mechanism is established by either the government or an educational institution in the municipalities of Gattaran and Baggao.
==Economy==

Agricultural products are rice, corn, peanut, beans, and fruits. Livestock products include cattle, hogs, carabaos, and poultry. Fishing various species of fish from the coastal towns is also undertaken. Woodcraft furniture made of hardwood, rattan, bamboo, and other indigenous materials are also available in the province.

The Northern Cagayan International Airport, in Lal-lo, was built to support the Cagayan Special Economic Zone in northern Cagayan, which also serves seaborne traffic through Port Irene. The airport project involved the construction of a 2,200-meter runway, with a width of 45 meters, following the standards of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Completed in October 2014, the international airport can accommodate large aircraft such as the Airbus A319-100 and Boeing regional jets of comparable size.

===Tourism===
Since Cagayan faces the Philippine Sea, an extensive shoreline sprawls along the northern coastal towns of Sanchez Mira, Pamplona, Santa Praxedes, Claveria, Buguey, Aparri, Ballesteros, Abulug, and the islands of Palaui, Fuga, and island municipality of Calayan. Sanchez Mira, Claveria, and Santa Praxedes have facilities for excursion stays while Fuga Island is being developed as a world-class recreation and tourism center. Activities include whale watching at the Calayan Islands, and scuba diving, snorkeling and fishing in Palaui Island of Santa Ana. The airstrip at Claveria could be used as a jump-off point to Fuga Island.

The Sambali Festival is celebrated throughout the province in commemoration of its founding. Hotels include the Governors Garden Hotel, Hotel Candice, Hotel Roma and Hotel Kimikarlai all in Tuguegarao City.

The Basilica Minore of Our Lady of Piat in the Municipaliylty of Piat, is a major pilgrimage site in the province and houses the centuries-old image of Our Lady of Piat, known as the &quot;Mother of Cagayan.&quot; Referred to as the &quot;Pilgrimage Center of the North,&quot; it attracts thousands of devotees annually, particularly during its feast day in July.

Claveria is host to several scenic attractions which include: the &quot;Lakay-Lakay Lagoon&quot;, the rocky formation along the &quot;Camalaggaon Caves&quot;, the &quot;Roadside Park&quot; overlooking the Claveria Bay, &quot;Macatel Falls&quot; with its clear waters that run in abundance throughout the year, the &quot;Pata Lighthouse&quot;, and the Claveria Beach Resort along the white sand coasts.

<text>Clear Lake is a populated place located in Collin County, Texas, United States. According to the Handbook of Texas, the community had a population of 50 in 1990. It is located within the Dallas-Fort Worth Metroplex.

==History==
A distillery was constructed and run by the US government in 1884 on the shores of adjacent Clear Lake. A few people were drawn to the area by the government project, and by 1890 the town of Clear Lake had been founded. Robert L. Palmer served as the postmaster when the office was established there in 1898, and it closed sometime around 1930. The town was Dallas&#x27;s main source of bois d&#x27;arc timber for a number of years during the city&#x27;s early years, when Dallas tried paving its streets with the wood. Clear Lake&#x27;s population shrank significantly after Dallas shelved the project. Despite being in the center of the Blackland Prairie, seasonal flooding in the area around Clear Lake devastated crops. By 1914, Clear Lake had a population of 100, up from an estimated 75 in 1910. Despite the 1954 creation of Lavon Lake, the estimated population of the village went down to fifty from the 1930s to 1990.

==Geography==
Clear Lake is located near the south shore of Lavon Lake, southeast of McKinney in southeastern Collin County. It was also on the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad.

==Education==
Today the community is served by the Princeton Independent School District. It is zoned for Harper Elementary School, Clark Middle School, and Princeton High School.

<text>The Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD), or simply Metro Vancouver, is a Canadian political subdivision and corporate entity representing the metropolitan area of Greater Vancouver, designated by provincial legislation as one of the 28 regional districts in British Columbia. The organization was known as the Regional District of Fraser–Burrard for nearly one year upon incorporating in 1967, and as the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) from 1968 to 2017.

Metro Vancouver borders Whatcom County, Washington, to the south, the Fraser Valley Regional District to the east, the Squamish-Lillooet Regional District to the north, and the Nanaimo Regional District and Cowichan Valley Regional District across the Strait of Georgia to the west.

The MVRD is under the direction of 23 local authorities and delivers regional services, sets policy and acts as a political forum. The regional district&#x27;s most populous city is Vancouver, and Metro Vancouver&#x27;s administrative offices are located in the city of Burnaby. The MVRD&#x27;s boundaries match those of the Vancouver census metropolitan area (CMA) as identified by Statistics Canada.

== History ==
The Greater Vancouver Water District and the Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District were established in 1924 and 1956 respectively. The Government of British Columbia incorporated a regional district for this western portion of the Lower Mainland named the Regional District of Fraser-Burrard on 29 June 1967. Just under a year later, the regional district was renamed as the Greater Vancouver Regional District (GVRD) on 13 June 1968.

In 2007, the GVRD applied to change its official legal name a second time to simply &quot;Metro Vancouver&quot;, which was deemed more recognizable at the time. British Columbia&#x27;s Minister of Community Services denied the application due to the absence of the term &quot;regional district&quot; within the proposed new name, though it was suggested that the GVRD could brand itself under the unofficial name of Metro Vancouver. After nine years, with growing public recognition of Metro Vancouver, the overall success of the brand, and confusion between the brand and the official legal name of the regional district, the GVRD moved in 2016 to change its name to the Metro Vancouver Regional District. The regional district was therefore formally renamed a second time by the Government of British Columbia on 30 January 2017 to the Metro Vancouver Regional District.

== Geography ==
The Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD) is located east of the Strait of Georgia and north of the State of Washington and is bisected by the Fraser River. The boundaries of the MVRD match those of the Vancouver CMA.

== Membership ==

This regional district comprises 23 local authorities as members: 21 municipalities, one electoral area and one treaty First Nation.

Electoral Area A comprises all unincorporated land within the regional district boundaries, which totals about 818 square kilometres. Most of the area is in the northernmost part of the district, including residential areas and isolated dwellings on Howe Sound between Lions Bay and Horseshoe Bay, on Indian Arm to the north of Deep Cove and Belcarra/Anmore and on the west side of Pitt Lake to the north of Port Coquitlam. Other areas included are Barnston Island on the Fraser River, Passage Island between Bowen Island and West Vancouver, and finally the urban communities of the University of British Columbia campus and the University Endowment Lands, in which 98% of the population of Electoral Area A lives.

There are also seventeen First Nations reserves within the geographical area of Metro Vancouver, with a combined population of 7,550 as of 2006. While reserves are not subject to Metro Vancouver by-laws, people living on reserve are still eligible to vote in local and Electoral Area A elections and therefore help select the Metro Vancouver board of directors.

The cities of Abbotsford and Chilliwack and the district of Mission, located to the east, although often linked to Vancouver in promotions and tourism, are part of a separate regional district, the Fraser Valley Regional District.

== Demographics ==

As a census division in the 2021 Canadian census conducted by Statistics Canada, the Metro Vancouver Regional District had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021. The Metro Vancouver Regional District is the densest and most populous regional district in British Columbia, and the second-densest and second-most populous census division in Canada behind Toronto.


== Governance ==
Metro Vancouver technically comprises four separate corporate entities: the Metro Vancouver Regional District (MVRD), the Greater Vancouver Sewerage and Drainage District (GVS&amp;DD), the Greater Vancouver Water District (GVWD) and the Metro Vancouver Housing Corporation (MVHC). Each of these is governed by a board of directors. The board of the MVRD has 40 directors coming from the 23 local authorities who are MVRD members. The number of directors coming from each local authority is determined by population, and the number of votes allocated to each director further helps proportionally represent the population distribution of the region. Each board director is also an elected official of one of the local authorities, with the exception of the elected representative for Electoral Area A (which has no council).

As of 2017, the organization had about 1,500 employees. The current organizational structure shows ten departments reporting to the Chief Administrative Officer: Human Resources &amp; Corporate Services; External Relations; Financial Services; Legal Services &amp; Aboriginal Relations; Board &amp; Information Services; Liquid Waste Services; Parks &amp; Housing Services; Planning &amp; Environment; Solid Waste Services; and Water Services.

== Administrative role ==
The principal function of Metro Vancouver is to administer resources and services which are common across the metropolitan area. The Metro Vancouver Board has defined its strategic priorities for 2015 through 2018 in its Board Strategic Plan.

The organization categorizes its work into action areas as described in the following subsections. However, 84% of the organization&#x27;s budget is spent in three of those areas – the three utilities (water, liquid waste, solid waste). Metro Vancouver&#x27;s commitments and its members&#x27; commitments to each action area are outlined in eight board-approved management plans as referenced below.

=== Water ===

Metro Vancouver&#x27;s tap water is provided by four legal entities that operate under the name Metro Vancouver: the GVWD, the GVS&amp;DD, the MVRD and MVHC. They collectively serve 2.8 million residents in the region and provide of water during peak summer days. The GVWD provides tap water to a land area covering more than 2,600 km² with all of the water coming from three sources: the Capilano reservoir, the Seymour reservoir and the Coquitlam reservoir. Metro Vancouver controls the Cleveland Dam on the Capilano reservoir, which supplies 40 percent of the district&#x27;s water. The system includes 26 storage tanks, 19 pump stations, and of water mains.

=== Liquid waste ===
Metro Vancouver operates and maintains the liquid waste facility, which includes managing &quot;the network of trunk sewers, pumping stations and wastewater treatment plants that connect with municipal sewer systems&quot;. Throughout operations, the organization is committed to protecting public health and the environment, and recovering as much resources (energy, nutrients, etc.) as possible out of the waste stream.

The liquid waste utility is committed to the goals and strategies in the Integrated Liquid Waste and Resource Management plan, as approved by the board. The three goals are to:
* Protect public health and the environment
* Use liquid waste as a resource
* Effective, affordable and collaborative management

=== Solid waste ===
Metro Vancouver&#x27;s solid waste utility is committed to the goals and strategies in the Integrated Solid Waste and Resource Management plan, as approved by the board. The four goals are to:
* Minimize waste generation
* Maximize reuse, recycling and material recovery
* Recover energy from the waste stream after material recycling
* Dispose of all waste in landfill after material recycling and energy recovery

One initiative of the organization was the Ashcroft Manor Ranch Mega-Landfill Proposal in Ashcroft, British Columbia, in the Thompson Country of the British Columbia Interior, as there is no more room in the Lower Mainland for Metro Vancouver&#x27;s garbage. A similar project nearby adjacent to the town of Cache Creek, British Columbia has almost reached capacity. Environmental concerns about the area&#x27;s sensitive shrub–steppe climate and ecology are strong, while Highland Valley Copper, near Logan Lake, has offered the use of its mine-pit instead. Other MVRD landfill locations serving the regional district in the past have been in the Fraser Mills area, between the Trans-Canada Highway and the Fraser, and at Port Mann, beneath the south foot of the Port Mann Bridge.

=== Housing ===
Metro Vancouver owns and manages housing complexes throughout the region via the Metro Vancouver Housing Corporation (MVHC); it also forms policy on homelessness and affordable housing for the region. The MVHC&#x27;s board-approved goals, as outlined in the Affordable Housing Strategy, are to:
* Expand the supply and diversity of housing to meet a variety of needs
* Expand the rental supply and balance preservation of existing stock with redevelopment while supporting existing tenants
* Meet housing demand estimates for very low and low income earners
* Increase the rental housing supply along the frequent transit network
* End homelessness in the region

The MVHC&#x27;s sole shareholder is the Metro Vancouver Regional District. The number of directors of the housing corporation is 13.

=== Regional planning ===
Metro Vancouver works in collaboration with its members to achieve a shared vision of livability across the generations, as laid out in the Regional Growth Strategy (RGS), which was approved by the board in 2011, replacing the Livable Region Strategic Plan (LRSP). The RGS requires each member local authority to provide a Regional Context Statement to &quot;demonstrate to the Metro Vancouver Board how its Official Community Plan Supports the RGS.&quot; The five goals of the RGS are to:
* Create a compact urban area
* Support a sustainable economy
* Protect the environment and respond to climate change impacts
* Develop complete communities
* Support sustainable transportation choices

Regional planning also includes planning and policy-making in agriculture and the food industry. The organization is committed to the goals and strategies in the Regional Food System Strategy, as approved by the board. The goals are to:
* Increase capacity to produce food close to home
* Improve the financial viability of the food sector
* Have people make healthy and sustainable food choices
* Provide everyone with access to healthy, culturally diverse and affordable food
* Maintain a food system consistent with ecological health

In 2018, the organization&#x27;s board also adopted the Ecological Health Framework, which encapsulates Metro Vancouver’s collective efforts around ecological health and provides guiding principles, goals, and strategies to help achieve the vision of a &quot;beautiful, healthy, and resilient environment for current and future generations.&quot; The goals are:
* Goal 1: Build ecological resilience and minimize impacts
* Goal 2: Protect natural areas and conserve ecosystem services
* Goal 3: Nurture nature within communities

=== Air quality ===
The organization runs programs and set policy to protect public health and the environment with respect to air quality, improve visual air quality and minimize the region&#x27;s contribution to climate change. The organization is committed to the goals and strategies in the Integrated Air Quality and Greenhouse Gas Management Plan, as approved by the board. The three goals are to:
* Protect public health and the environment
* Improve visual air quality
* Minimize the region&#x27;s contribution to global climate change

=== Regional parks ===
The parks department of Metro Vancouver oversees the development and maintenance of 23 regional parks, as well as various nature reserves and greenways. The organization is committed to the goals and strategies in the Regional Parks Plan, as approved by the board. The four goals are to:
* Promote ecological health
* Promote outdoor recreation for human health and wellness
* Support community stewardship, education and stewardships
* Promote philanthropy and economic opportunities

Regional parks are distinct from municipal parks in that they are typically more &quot;wild&quot; and represent unique geographical zones within the region, such as bogs and mature rainforests.

=== Regional economic prosperity ===
Regional economic prosperity is a service of Metro Vancouver organized to advance a shared prosperity in the region. The service is structured around three functions: fostering collaboration, conducting regional data collection and research, and attracting investment.

=== Regional federation ===
Metro Vancouver undertakes support functions that underpin the rest of its service areas. In these areas, the organization commits to &quot;contribute to the effective and efficient performance of our regional roles through leadership and collaboration with our members and other stakeholders.&quot; There are eight strategic directions guiding work in this area:
* Livable and sustainable region: Use livability and sustainability objectives to guide Metro Vancouver services and operations.
* Effective federation: Strengthen the alignment of member and regional objectives.
* Public education: Increase Metro Vancouver&#x27;s profile by leveraging events and news related to regional services.
* Engagement: Enhance relationships between Metro Vancouver and other orders of government, First Nations and stakeholders.
* Regional transportation: Advocate the merits of integrating regional land use and transportation planning.
* Regional prosperity: Clarify and strengthen Metro Vancouver&#x27;s role in pursuing a collaborative approach to regional prosperity.
* Emergency preparedness: Collaborate with stakeholders to prepare for major emergencies.
* Fiscal responsibility: Use value for service to guide Metro Vancouver operations and service provision.

The organization&#x27;s board has also adopted the Corporate Climate Action Plan, the purpose of which is to, &quot;set out strategies and actions to achieve Metro Vancouver&#x27;s commitment to corporate carbon neutrality and to adapt [its] corporate infrastructure and activities to the anticipated consequences of climate change.&quot; The strategies of the plan are to:
* Reduce energy consumption
* Switch to renewable energy
* Maximize energy recovery
* Sequester and remove carbon
* Adapt existing infrastructure and operations
* Plan and build resilient new infrastructure and facilities

<doc id="271068" wikidata="Q210122" url="?curid=271068" title="Atom Heart Mother">
<text>Atom Heart Mother is the fifth studio album by the English rock band Pink Floyd. It was released by Harvest on 2 October 1970 in the United Kingdom, and on 10 October 1970 in the United States. It was recorded at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London, and was the band&#x27;s first album to reach number 1 in the UK, while it reached number 55 in the US, eventually going gold there.

The cover was designed by Hipgnosis, and was the band&#x27;s first not to feature their name, or have photographs of them on any part of it. This was a trend that would continue on subsequent covers throughout the 1970s. The cover shows a Holstein cow on a meadow landscape.

Although it was commercially successful on release, the bandparticularly Roger Waters and David Gilmourhave expressed negative opinions of the album. A remastered CD was released in 1994 in the UK and the US, and again in 2011. Ron Geesin, who had influenced and collaborated with Waters, co-composed the title track.

==Recording==
Pink Floyd started work on the album after completing their contributions to the soundtrack for the film &quot;Zabriskie Point&quot; in Rome, which had ended somewhat acrimoniously. They headed back to London in early 1970 for rehearsals. A number of out-takes from the Rome sessions were used to assemble new material during these rehearsals, though some of it, such as &quot;The Violent Sequence&quot;, later to become &quot;Us and Them&quot;, would not be used for some time.

===Side one===
The title track of &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; resulted from a number of instrumental figures the band had composed during these rehearsals, including the chord progression of the main theme, which guitarist David Gilmour had called &quot;Theme from an Imaginary Western&quot;, and the earliest documented live performance was on 17 January 1970 at Hull University. The band felt that the live performances developed the piece into a manageable shape. Recording of the track commenced at EMI Studios (now Abbey Road Studios) in London, and was somewhat cumbersome, as it was the first recording to use a new eight-track one-inch tape and EMI TG12345 transistorised mixing console (8-track, 24-microphone inputs) in the studio. As a result, EMI insisted the band were not allowed to do any splicing of the tape to edit pieces together. Consequently, band members Roger Waters and Nick Mason had little choice but to play the bass and drums, respectively, for the entire 23-minute piece in one sitting. The other instruments the band played were overdubbed later. Mason recalled the final backing track&#x27;s lack of precise timekeeping would cause problems later on. Geesin denied Mason&#x27;s account and said the tapes given to him for arranging the score were a collage of short sections.

By March, they had finished recording the track, but felt that it was rather unfocused and needed something else. The band had been introduced to Ron Geesin via the Rolling Stones tour manager, Sam Cutler, and were impressed with his composition and tape-editing capabilities, particularly Waters and Mason. Geesin was handed the completed backing tracks the band had recorded, and asked to compose an orchestral arrangement over the top of it while the band went on tour to the US. Geesin described the composing and arranging as &quot;a hell of a lot of work. Nobody knew what was wanted, they couldn&#x27;t read music …&quot; According to him, Gilmour came up with some of the melodic lines, while the pair of them along with keyboardist Richard Wright worked on the middle section with the choir. During the recording of his work in June with the EMI Pops Orchestra, the session musicians present were unimpressed with his tendency to favour avant-garde music over established classical works, and, combined with the relative difficulty of some of the parts, harassed him during recording. John Alldis, whose choir was also to perform on the track, had experience in dealing with orchestral musicians, and managed to conduct the recorded performance in place of Geesin.

The track was originally called &quot;The Amazing Pudding&quot;, although Geesin&#x27;s original score referred to it as &quot;Untitled Epic&quot;. A refined and improved version (with Geesin&#x27;s written parts) was played at Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music on 27 June. Its name was changed after the band were due to play an &quot;in concert&quot; broadcast for BBC Radio 1 on 16 July 1970, and had needed a title for John Peel to announce it. Geesin pointed to a copy of the &quot;Evening Standard&quot;, and suggested to Waters that he would find a title in there. The headline of one article, on page 9, was: &quot;&quot;, a story about a woman being fitted with a Plutonium-238-powered pacemaker.

The piece as presented on the completed album is a progression from Pink Floyd&#x27;s earlier instrumental pieces such as &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; and even earlier, &quot;Interstellar Overdrive&quot;. The &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; suite takes up all of side one, and is split into six parts, individually named. Geesin chose the opening section name, &quot;Father&#x27;s Shout&quot; after Earl &quot;Fatha&quot; Hines, while other names such as &quot;Breast Milky&quot; and &quot;Funky Dung&quot; were inspired by the album cover artwork. The orchestral arrangements feature a full brass section, a cello and the 16-piece John Alldis choir, which take most of the lead melody lines, while Pink Floyd mainly provide the backing tracks; a reverse of the 1960s pop music practice of using orchestration as the background, and putting the rock band in front.

===Side two===
The album&#x27;s concept is similar to their previous &quot;Ummagumma&quot; album, in that it features the full band in the first half, and focuses on individual members in the second half. Side two opens with three five-minute songs: one by each of the band&#x27;s three resident songwriters; then closes with a sound effects-dominated musical suite primarily conceived by Mason and credited to the whole group. Waters contributes a folk ballad called &quot;If&quot;, playing acoustic guitar. Pink Floyd rarely played the song live, but Waters often performed it at solo shows in support of his &quot;Radio K.A.O.S.&quot; album, more than a decade later. This is followed by Wright&#x27;s &quot;Summer &#x27;68&quot;, which also features prominent use of brass in places. It was issued as a Japanese single in 1971, and was the only track on the album never to be played live in concert. The song was reportedly about Wright and a groupie on tour, and had the working title of &quot;One Night Stand&quot;.

According to Mason, Gilmour, having had little songwriting experience at that point, was ordered to remain in EMI until he had composed a song suitable for inclusion on the album. He came up with a folk-influenced tune, &quot;Fat Old Sun&quot;, which he still cites as a personal favourite. The song was a regular part of the band&#x27;s live repertoire in 1970–71, and became a staple of Gilmour&#x27;s solo set in 2006.

The final track, &quot;Alan&#x27;s Psychedelic Breakfast&quot;, is divided into three segments, each with its own descriptive title, joined by dialogue and sound effects of then-roadie Alan Styles preparing, discussing, and eating breakfast. The idea for the piece came about by Waters experimenting with the rhythm of a dripping tap, which combined sound effects and dialogue recorded by Mason in his kitchen with musical pieces recorded at EMI. A slightly re-worked version was performed on stage on 22 December 1970 at Sheffield City Hall, Sheffield, England with the band members pausing between pieces to eat and drink their breakfast. The original LP ends with the sound of the tap which continues into the inner groove, and thus plays on indefinitely.

Original Floyd frontman Syd Barrett recorded his album &quot;Barrett&quot; around the same time as &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, with assistance from Gilmour and Wright. He occasionally visited his old band&#x27;s sessions to see what they were doing.

==Artwork==

The original album cover, designed by art collective Hipgnosis, shows a Holstein-Friesian cow standing in a pasture with no text nor any other clue as to what might be on the record. Some later editions have the title and artist name added to the cover. This concept was the group&#x27;s reaction to the psychedelic space rock imagery associated with Pink Floyd at the time of the album&#x27;s release; the band wanted to explore all sorts of music without being limited to a particular image or style of performance. They thus requested that their new album had &quot;something plain&quot; on the cover, which ended up being the image of a cow. Storm Thorgerson, inspired by Andy Warhol&#x27;s famous &quot;cow wallpaper&quot;, has said that he simply drove out into a rural area near Potters Bar and photographed the first cow he saw. The cow&#x27;s owner identified her name as &quot;Lulubelle III&quot;. More cows appear on the back cover, again with no text or titles, and on the inside gatefold. Also, a pink balloon shaped like a cow udder accompanied the album as part of Capitol&#x27;s marketing strategy campaign to &quot;break&quot; the band in the US. Looking back on the artwork, Thorgerson remembered: &quot;I think the cow represents, in terms of the Pink Floyd, part of their humour, which I think is often underestimated or just unwritten about.&quot;

In the mid-1980s, a bootleg containing rare singles and B-sides entitled &quot;The Dark Side of the Moo&quot; appeared, with a similar cover. Like &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, the cover had no writing on it, although in this case it was to protect the bootlegger&#x27;s anonymity rather than any artistic statement. The album cover for the KLF&#x27;s concept album &quot;Chill Out&quot; was also inspired by &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; was released on 2 October 1970 in the UK and 10 October in the US. It reached number 1 and number 55, respectively in those countries&#x27; charts. It was released in the quadraphonic format in the UK, Germany and Australia. A remastered CD was released in 1994 in the UK and the US. Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab released a 24KT gold CD in the US in 1994, while an LP version was released in the US in the same year. A remastered edition was released in 2011. It was reissued again in 2016 on the band&#x27;s Pink Floyd Records label.

Critical reaction to the suite has always been mixed, and all band members have expressed negativity toward it. Gilmour has said the album was &quot;a load of rubbish. We were at a real down point ... I think we were scraping the barrel a bit at that period&quot; and &quot;a good idea but it was dreadful... &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; sounds like we didn&#x27;t have any idea between us, but we became much more prolific after it.&quot; Similarly, in a 1984 interview on BBC Radio 1, Waters said &quot;If somebody said to me nowrighthere&#x27;s a million pounds, go out and play &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;, I&#x27;d say you must be fucking joking.&quot;

In a 1970 review, Alec Dubro of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; appraised &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; negatively, stating &quot;if Pink Floyd is looking for some new dimensions, they haven&#x27;t found them here.&quot; In &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide: Rock Albums of the Seventies&quot; (1981), Robert Christgau said the suite was easier to digest than the second side of songs: &quot;Yeah, they do leave the singing to an anonymous semi-classical chorus, and yeah, they probably did get the horns for the fanfares at the same hiring hall. But at least the suite provides a few of the hypnotic melodies that made &quot;Ummagumma&quot; such an admirable record to fall asleep to.&quot; The album is ranked number 990 in &quot;All-Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;.

== Live performances ==

The band were initially enthusiastic about performing the suite. An early performance was taped for the San Francisco television station KQED, featuring just the band, on 28 April 1970. Two major performances were at the Bath Festival of Blues and Progressive Music on 27 June and the &quot;Blackhills Garden Party&quot; in Hyde Park, London on 18 July. On both occasions the band were accompanied by the John Alldis Choir and the Philip Jones Brass Ensemble. Later, the band took a full brass section and choir on tour just for the purpose of performing this piece. However, this caused the tour to lose money, and the band found problems with the hired musicians, which changed from gig to gig as they simply took who was available, which, combined with lack of rehearsal and problems miking up the whole ensemble, made a full live performance more problematic. Reflecting on this, Gilmour said &quot;some of the brass players have been really hopeless&quot;. According to Mason, the band arrived at one gig in Aachen, Germany, only to discover they had left the sheet music behind, forcing tour manager Tony Howard to go back to London and get it.

A later arrangement without brass or choir, and pared down from 25 minutes to fifteen by omitting the &quot;collage&quot; sections and closing reprise of the main theme, remained in their live repertoire into 1972. The first live performance of &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; suite in Brighton was abandoned partway through; after a break, the band played &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; instead. Pink Floyd&#x27;s last live performance of the suite took place on 22 May 1972 at the Olympisch Stadion, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

== Legacy ==

Stanley Kubrick wanted to use the album&#x27;s title track in &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot;. The group refused permission, primarily because Kubrick was unsure of exactly which pieces of music he wanted and what he wished to do with them. In retrospect, Waters said &quot;maybe it&#x27;s just as well it wasn&#x27;t used after all&quot;. Nevertheless, the album is visible behind the counter in the record store scene of the film.

On 14 and 15 June 2008, Geesin performed &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot; with Italian tribute band Mun Floyd over two nights as part of the Chelsea Festival. Geesin introduced it with a history and slide show. The performances featured the chamber choir Canticum, brass and cellist Caroline Dale, who has worked with Gilmour. The second night saw Gilmour join Geesin on stage for the performance, which was extended to 30 minutes.

In 2013, Geesin produced a book, &quot;The Flaming Cow&quot;, which documented his experience with working with Pink Floyd, including the making of this album from his point of view.

<doc id="271069" wikidata="Q1133622" url="?curid=271069" title="Glassworks (composition)">
<text>Glassworks is a chamber music work of six movements by Philip Glass. Following his larger-scale concert and stage works, it was Glass&#x27;s successful attempt to create a more pop-oriented &quot;Walkman-suitable&quot; work, with considerably shorter and more accessible pieces written for the recording studio.

The LP and cassette were released in 1982, each with its own separate mix: the record album intended for home listening and the tape for personal cassette players. The headphone-specific mix, previously only available on cassette, was reissued digitally 2016.
==Movements==
===&quot;Opening&quot;===
&quot;Opening&quot; uses triplet eighth notes, over duple eighth notes, over whole notes in . Formally it consists of three groups of four measure phrases of three to four chords repeated four times each, ABC:||ABC, which then merges with the next movement, &quot;Floe&quot; with the entrance of the horns.

===&quot;Floe&quot;===
There are two formulaically identical sections to the movement. Although rhythmically driven, the melodic implications of &quot;Floe&quot; occur somewhat coincidentally by orchestration. There is no modulation, but the harmonic progression simply repeats over and over again. The layering of contrasting timbres is characteristic of the piece as a whole. Floe borrows a theme from Jean Sibelius&#x27;s fifth symphony.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Rubric&quot; and &quot;Façades&quot; both appeared in the 2008 documentary about Philippe Petit, &quot;Man on Wire&quot;. &quot;Floe&quot; was featured on the soundtrack of the 1989 Italian horror film &quot;The Church&quot;.

==Release and reception==

The album was commercially successful, introduced Glass&#x27;s music to a large audience, and gave Glass widespread name recognition.

<doc id="271070" wikidata="Q444096" url="?curid=271070" title="Patty Smyth">
<text>Patricia Smyth (born June 26, 1957) is an American singer and songwriter. She first came into national attention with the rock band Scandal and went on to record and perform as a solo artist. Her distinctive voice and new wave image gained broad exposure through video recordings aired on cable music video channels such as MTV. Her debut solo album &quot;Never Enough&quot; was well received, and generated a pair of Top 100 hits. In the early 1990s she reached the top 10 with the hit single &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain&#x27;t Enough,&quot; a duet with Don Henley of Eagles. She performed and co-wrote with James Ingram the song &quot;Look What Love Has Done&quot; for the 1994 motion picture &quot;Junior&quot;. The work earned her a Grammy Award nomination for Best Song Written for Visual Media, as well as an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song.

==Early life, family and education==

Patty Smyth was born in New York City, New York. She was raised in Gerritsen Beach, Brooklyn, New York City, New York. 

==Career==
===With Scandal===
Smyth joined Scandal as lead vocalist in 1981. The band released a self-titled debut EP the next year. Featuring the song &quot;Goodbye to You,&quot; it went on to become Columbia Records&#x27; biggest selling EP. In 1984, they put out their follow-up, &quot;Warrior&quot;. Buoyed by MTV airplay, the album peaked at No. 17 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and the first song off the release, also titled &quot;The Warrior,&quot; was a Top 10 hit. However, despite their success, internal strife within the band led to their break-up soon afterward.

===Solo career===
Following the end of Scandal, Smyth was invited by her friend Eddie Van Halen to join the band Van Halen to replace David Lee Roth as lead singer. However, she declined the offer, because she was eight months pregnant and &quot;It was just not the right time for me,&quot; she stated. &quot;I was a New Yorker, I didn&#x27;t want to live in LA ... and those guys were drunk and fighting all the time&quot;. She guest-appeared on the Hooters 1985 album &quot;Nervous Night&quot; on the song &quot;Where Do the Children Go&quot; as an accompanying vocalist.

Smyth released her first solo album, &quot;Never Enough,&quot; in 1987. It contained her version of the Tom Waits song &quot;Downtown Train&quot; (which Rod Stewart would make a hit three years later) and the title track &quot;Never Enough,&quot; which was co-written with members of the Hooters and based on a song of the same title that Hooters members Eric Bazilian and Rob Hyman had written for their earlier band, Baby Grand. In 1988, she contributed the Diane Warren penned &quot;I Run Right Back&quot; to the &quot;Caddyshack II&quot; soundtrack. She put out another solo effort in 1992, the eponymous album &quot;Patty Smyth&quot;. Off of that effort, she secured a hit record via &quot;Sometimes Love Just Ain&#x27;t Enough,&quot; a duet with Don Henley of the Eagles. This peaked at No. 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and was certified gold for sales of 500,000. The album, also certified gold, featured an additional US Top 40 hit with &quot;No Mistakes&quot; and also spawned the minor hit &quot;I Should Be Laughing.&quot; Smyth had previously recorded with Henley as a backing singer on several songs on his albums &quot;Building the Perfect Beast&quot; and &quot;The End of the Innocence.&quot;

Smyth subsequently co-wrote the 1994 song &quot;Look What Love Has Done,&quot; nominated for a Grammy and an Academy Award after its inclusion in the soundtrack to the feature film &quot;Junior.&quot; Further soundtrack commissions resulted in her writing and composing the theme tune, &quot;Wish I Were You,&quot; to the 1998 feature film &quot;Armageddon&quot;. (Her husband, former tennis professional John McEnroe, claimed in his autobiography that she was inspired to write the song by his own attempt at a musical career; she was struck by his excitement at playing music, when her own feelings about the music industry were much more ambivalent.) In 1999, Smyth sang lead vocals on a cover of &quot;Ode To Billie Joe&quot; (the 1967 Bobbie Gentry hit) on the album &quot;Smokin&#x27; Section&quot; by Tom Scott &amp; The L.A. Express.

In 2015, to promote the release of her Christmas album &quot;Come On December&quot;, she crowdfunded a campaign to support the &quot;Headstrong Project&quot;; all the money raised on the pre-orders of her album were designated to the non-profit. The album featured the single &quot;Broken,&quot; and the music video for the single was released just before Veterans Day, and was filmed on the grounds of a Veterans of Foreign Wars chapter. The album was released on November 20, 2015.

===Reunion with Scandal===
In 2004, VH1 recruited Smyth and the surviving members of Scandal for a &quot;Bands Reunited&quot; episode, resulting in a small reunion tour of concerts on the East Coast of the United States in 2005. The next year, Columbia/Legacy released a new Scandal compilation CD as part of the &quot;We Are the &#x27;80s&quot; series. The compilation contained three unreleased tracks from the 1982 recording sessions (&quot;Grow So Wise&quot;, &quot;If You Love Me&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;m Here Tonight&quot;) as well as &quot;All My Life,&quot; previously available on the flip side of &quot;Goodbye to You&quot;. In July 2008, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported the upcoming release of new music by the band (featuring original members Keith Mack and Benjy King). They debuted their first single as a band (&quot;Hard for You to Love Me,&quot; also referred to as &quot;Make It Hard&quot;) in over 24 years on January 17, 2009 in Ridgefield, Connecticut.

==Personal life==

Smyth was married to musician Richard Hell in 1985–86; they had a daughter. 

She met professional tennis player John McEnroe in 1993. Their daughter was born in 1995, and the couple married in 1997. They have since had another daughter. Smyth and McEnroe live in a duplex on the Upper West Side of Manhattan.

<doc id="271077" wikidata="Q1352440" url="?curid=271077" title="Willem Slijkhuis">
<text>Willem Frederik &quot;Wim&quot; Slijkhuis (13 January 1923 – 28 June 2003) was a Dutch athlete. During his career that lasted from 1939 to 1954 he was a world&#x27;s top middle distance runner, excelling in distances from 1500 to 5000 metres.

Slijkhuis began his international sports career shortly after World War II, having competed nationally since 1939. In 1946, he won a silver medal in the 5000 m at the European Championships in Oslo.

Two years later he took part in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London, and was a favourite to win a medal. In the 5000 m he finished third, behind Belgian Gaston Reiff and the legendary Emil Zátopek; nevertheless Slijkhuis was not satisfied. In the 1500 m, his second event, he could have done better, but started his final sprint to the finish line too late to catch the two leading Swedes, who finished narrowly ahead of him. In spite of this, realising 3:50.4 he equalled his own Dutch record, set two years earlier. Slijkhuis&#x27; achievements were overshadowed, however, by the performances of compatriot Fanny Blankers-Koen, who won four gold medals at the same Olympics.

In 1950, Slijkhuis did win a major title: the 1500 m at the European championships held in Brussels, with a time of 3:47.2. His personal best at this distance had already been improved to 3:43.8, realised one year earlier in Antwerp and only 0.8 s away from the existing world record at the time.

During his career Willem Slijkhuis didn&#x27;t just run almost everywhere in Europe, but also in New Zealand, South Africa and the United States. He was the first Dutchman who competed in the US Indoor circuit and the first non-American, who ever succeeded in obtaining the US title over one mile.

Owing to his stubborn behaviour Slijkhuis sometimes clashed with officials of the Dutch Athletics Federation, who he accused of outrageous interference. On the track however he impressed experts and public with his smooth, steady running style. Especially the English were delighted about his beautiful running style, which they lyrically described as &quot;The Poetry of motion&quot;.

His second Olympic participation in the 1952 Summer Olympics ended without any successes. Slijkhuis, who won eleven national titles – including eight in the men&#x27;s 5000 metres – on track, seven in Cross country running and set thirty Dutch records, ended his career in 1954 due to injuries. He died on 28 June 2003 in Badhoevedorp.

<doc id="271087" wikidata="Q767753" url="?curid=271087" title="Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport">
<text>Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is a major airport in the U.S. state of Alaska, located southwest of downtown Anchorage. The airport is named for Ted Stevens, who served as a senator of Alaska from 1968 to 2009. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a medium-hub primary commercial service facility.

==History==
Built in 1951, the airport was served in the 1950s by Alaska Airlines, Northwest Orient, Pacific Northern Airlines and Reeve Aleutian Airways, using aircraft ranging from Douglas DC-3s to Boeing 377s, and was also a refuelling stop for Canadian Pacific Air Lines service to the Far East (one such aircraft being involved in a 1951 disappearance). From 1955 to 2011, the eastern end of the airport&#x27;s southernmost runway connected to the Kulis Air National Guard Base.

By the mid-1980s the airport&#x27;s nickname was &quot;Crossroads of the World&quot;. Anchorage was a common stopover for passengers flying between Europe and East Asia, because airspace in China, the Soviet Union and Eastern Bloc countries was off-limits and because the first generation of jets and widebody airliners did not have the range to fly non-stop across the Pacific Ocean. Carriers using Anchorage for this purpose included:

* Air France, British Airways, Iberia, KLM, Lufthansa, Sabena, Swissair and Spantax all used Anchorage as a stopover point between Europe and the Far East of Asia into the 1980s to 1991. 
* Japan Airlines served Seattle through Anchorage in the early 1960s, and offered service through Anchorage to London, Paris, Amsterdam, Copenhagen, Düsseldorf, Hamburg, New York City &amp; São Paulo from the 1960s until October 1991. Last JAL flight was JL438 on October 31, 1991, Paris–Charles de Gaulle - Anchorage - Tokyo–Narita.
* Korean Air used Anchorage as a stopover point for flights between Seoul and both Europe and the continental US in the 1980s. On September 1, 1983, one of these flights, Flight 007 was shot down by a Soviet pilot who had mistaken it for a spy plane, after unintentionally violating Soviet airspace.
* Northwest Orient, the first airline to operate scheduled trans-Pacific service after World War II, used Elmendorf Field and later Anchorage International as a stopover for service between US points (Seattle, Chicago and Minneapolis at various times) and Tokyo as late as the mid-1970s.
* Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) began a transpolar flight from Copenhagen to Tokyo via Anchorage on February 24, 1957. A timetable from 11/25/88 - 3/25/89 shows SAS Flight 989 operated to Anchorage from Copenhagen on Wednesday, Friday &amp; Sunday. Dep: 3:40PM, Arr: 2:40PM. It left at 3:20PM and arrived at 4:55pm+1 in Tokyo.

In the mid-1980s airport officials knew that the then-new Boeing 747-400, with a longer range than then-existing aircraft, would decrease stopovers. They did not expect that Mikhail Gorbachev&#x27;s glasnost, towards the end of the Cold War, would open Soviet airspace to flights, causing the decrease to occur sooner than planned. By 1988, 16 airline flights that had previously stopped in Anchorage—each bringing almost $80,000 in revenue to the state—instead flew nonstop over Siberia.

Most scheduled passenger service from Anchorage to Europe and Asia ceased in the early 1990s. Korean Air continued to serve Anchorage 3 times a week on a yearly scheduled basis until March 2005 and reduced to 3 times a week for the summer season only in 2006. China Airlines, the last Asian carrier to serve Anchorage on a regular basis, used Anchorage as an intermediate stop on its Taipei-New York route until 2011, when it rerouted these flights to stop in Osaka. While a few charter passenger aircraft still stop at Anchorage on flights between Asia and the eastern United States, scheduled cargo carriers – which benefit from more volume and thus shorter route segments – continue to use Anchorage frequently. Condor still uses the Frankfurt-Anchorage route on a Boeing 767.

In the 1990s, Alaska Airlines and Aeroflot operated services from Anchorage to several destinations in the Russian Far East, including Khabarovsk, Magadan, Petropavlovsk, Vladivostok and Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. Alaska Airlines pulled out of these markets in 1998 due to insufficient demand, while the Aeroflot services were primarily intended as technical stops en route to Seattle and San Francisco and were cancelled once newer aircraft and nonstop flights became available. Reeve Aleutian Airways, Dalavia and MAVIAL Magadan Airlines also offered service between Anchorage and the Russian Far East at various times, catering to Kamchatka oil exploration and other niche markets.

The airport was renamed in 2000 by the Alaska Legislature to honor then long-standing U.S. Senator Ted Stevens. Stevens survived a crash at the airport in 1978 that also killed his wife Ann.

In October 2018, Alaska Governor Bill Walker and Heilongjiang Province Governor Wang Wentao announced plans to connect Anchorage and Harbin Taiping International Airport with year-round, nonstop flights as early as the summer of 2019.

On November 30, 2018, the airport suffered minor damage and was temporarily closed following a magnitude 7.0 earthquake in the area. In June 2019, American Airlines switched the Boeing 737-800 on their seasonal route to Phoenix with the Airbus A321neo making them the first airline to use the A321neo at Anchorage. In January 2023, Delta replaced their Boeing 737-900 and 757-200 in favor of the A321neo for their route to Minneapolis-St. Paul.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport was briefly the busiest in the United States due to sustained volume of cargo flights through Alaska while passenger travel sharply decreased at other American airports.

Due to the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent sanctions on airlines, commercial flights between Japan and Western Europe once again overfly Alaska in the eastbound direction. However, due to the advanced range of the airliners used for these flights, such as the Airbus A350, Boeing 777 and Boeing 787 Dreamliner, the stopover in Anchorage is no longer needed and flights are operated nonstop. Some re-routed cargo flights do however stop in Anchorage, such as Nippon Cargo Airlines Flight 51, which operates Amsterdam - Milan - Anchorage - Tokyo four times weekly.

==Passenger traffic==
Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport&#x27;s passenger traffic hovered around the five million mark between 1998 and 2008, apart from in 2002 when the airport suffered a 13% drop in traffic. Fairbanks and Juneau are the next busiest airports though neither managed more than half a million passengers in 2007. Anchorage traffic peaks in June, July and August when passenger numbers are twice as high as between October and April. Most major U.S. passenger carriers serve ANC, with the majority of passenger flight operations by Alaska Airlines to and from Seattle (an average of 20 flights per day) and Fairbanks (5-7 flights per day).

Anchorage is also envisioned as a future connecting point for air traffic to the Russian Far East. During the summer season of 2008, there was one weekly flight to Russia by Vladivostok Air. Yakutia Airlines resumed summer seasonal service to Russia in 2012. Many of Alaska&#x27;s North Slope workers live either in Anchorage or elsewhere in the Lower 48 states and fly through the airport to their jobs in Prudhoe Bay.

As per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 2,599,313 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 2,282,666 enplanements in 2009, and 2,342,310 in 2010.

The nearest other international airports from Anchorage are Fairbanks International Airport and
Juneau International Airport. Fairbanks International Airport is also the second busiest airport in Alaska.

==International cargo hub==
Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport is a major cargo hub. In 2023, it ranked as the second busiest cargo airport in the US and the world&#x27;s fourth-busiest cargo airport. Cargo airlines travelling between Asia and the contiguous US prefer to refuel in Anchorage to carry less fuel and more cargo.

FedEx Express and UPS Airlines operate major hubs at Anchorage International for cargo heading to and from the Far East. NWA Cargo used to operate a major hub at the airport until December 28, 2009, when it closed all operations for Northwest Cargo at all airports. FedEx Express is the airport&#x27;s largest cargo facility and can handle as many as 13,400 packages per hour, employing more than 1,200 people and providing a full customs clearance system. United Parcel Service&#x27;s hub handles about 5,000 parcels per hour. Both companies forecast a large growth in traffic over the next several years as trade with China and other Far East countries increases and plan to expand their Anchorage facilities comparatively. The United States Postal Service also operates a large sectional center facility (SCF) for the 995xx ZIP Codes. It processes mail and parcels headed to and from all Alaska cities.

The United States Department of Transportation allows Anchorage and other Alaskan airports to be used as a transfer point for cargo between different aircraft of the same foreign air carrier without applying for special permission, a privilege not available at airports in the contiguous US. In 2020, the airport applied for similar authority for passenger traffic, which would potentially allow foreign airlines to use Anchorage as a connecting hub for international passengers. A similar exemption was previously granted to airports in Puerto Rico.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Ted Stevens Anchorage International Airport covers an area of 4,608 acres (1,865 ha) at an elevation of 151 feet (46 m) above mean sea level. It has three runways: 7L/25R is 10,600 by 150 feet (3,231 x 46 m) with an asphalt surface; 7R/25L is 12,400 by 200 feet (3,780 x 61 m) with an asphalt/concrete surface; 15/33 is 10,865 by 200 feet (3,312 x 61 m) with an asphalt surface. The airport also has one asphalt helipad that is 100 by 100 feet (30 x 30 m).

For the 12 months ending April 30, 2019, the airport had 261,961 aircraft operations, an average of 718 per day: 38% scheduled commercial, 32% general aviation, 29% air taxi, and &lt;1% military. At that time there were 109 aircraft based at this airport: 61% multi-engine, 14% helicopter, 15% jet, and 10% single-engine. The FAA projects operations to increase to 334,279 by 2030, or 918.882 operations per day.

The airport also has a seaplane base adjacent to it, so that seaplanes and floatplanes can take off and land. The Lake Hood Seaplane Base, adjacent to Anchorage Airport, is the busiest seaplane base in the world.

==Terminals==
The Anchorage International Airport has two terminals: the South Terminal with 24 gates, and the North Terminal with 8 gates, for a total of 32 gates.

The South Terminal (domestic) serves Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, American Airlines, Condor (Departures), Delta Air Lines, Discover Airlines (Departures), Sun Country Airlines, and United Airlines. All regional intrastate carriers also use the South Terminal.


The South terminal contains three concourses: Concourse A, Concourse B, and Concourse C. The area of what is today Concourse C stood the original airport terminal constructed in the 1950s. A hexagonal satellite terminal was constructed across the main structure shortly afterwards. In 1969, the terminal underwent a major expansion, forming what is today Concourse B - notable new features included a curved arrival/departure structure with an elevated departure ramp for vehicles. The sweeping structure was designed to connect with the existing hexagonal satellite, now the end of Concourse B. In 1985, Concourse A was added. In 2009, this portion of the South terminal received seismic and aesthetic upgrades.

Concourse C was completely rebuilt in 2004, designed by McCool Carlson Green Architects, while Concourses A and B were built in 1985 and 1969 respectively and renovated in 2009. Architects HNTB and RIM Architects performed the architectural work for A/B Concourse. The south terminal also contains two L gates, numbered L1 and L2. These gates are outside security on the lower level and adjacent to Concourse A.

The North Terminal (international) serves Condor (Arrivals), Discover Airlines (Arrivals), Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Yakutia Airlines, all international seasonal charter flights, and military flights. In addition to these airlines, a few cargo airlines use the north side of the terminal for parking while their aircraft have small problems that need maintenance for a day or so. This terminal was built in 1982.

===Inter-terminal===
A shuttle bus runs approximately every 15 minutes between the North and South terminals and the employee and long-term parking lots. A land-side inter-terminal walkway was completed in 2009. Air-side connections between the sterile areas of each terminal are not available.

===To/from airport===
Route 40 of the Anchorage People Mover bus system serves the airport&#x27;s North and South terminals every 15 minutes from 6:00am to 7:30pm on weekdays and every 30 minutes until 2:00am, as well as service every 30 minutes all day on Saturday and Sunday, connecting it with the downtown Transit Center.

Taxi queues are available in front of each terminal. Courtesy vans and other ground transportation options pick up from designated areas in front of each terminal.

Major national rental car chains are represented in an on-site consolidated rental car facility attached to the South terminal.

There is a rail station for the Alaska Railroad. It is only available during the summer season for cruise ship service. The depot opened in 2003 after funding was secured by United States Senator Ted Stevens, but commuter service never materialized.

==Renovations==
Renovations began on the A and B concourses in fall 2006. These renovations are designed to bring the older portions into compliance with current seismic, heating, ventilation, electrical and safety codes, and also include new baggage handling systems and renovations to the interior of the concourses. Since the completion of the construction, all domestic flights are operated out of the South Terminal.

==Commissioned art pieces==
*&quot;Euphony&quot;, 2004: glass artist – Warren Carther

The piece consists of nine towers of glass, collectively adding up to 42 meters (130  ft) of span and reaching 8 meters (26 ft) at its highest point. The series of panels are inspired by Alaska&#x27;s immensely rugged landscape of glaciers and mountains. The ambiguous images embedded within the sculpture address Alaska&#x27;s continual balancing of the forces of technology with the vast powers of the natural world.

On November 30, 2018, at 8:29 a.m. AKST (17:29 UTC) was damaged in the 7.1 magnitude earthquake and repaired a few months later.
It was damaged again in 2020 by a disgruntled passenger which still has yet to be repaired as of 2022.

==Programs==
The airport features an innovative customer service program, which partners with most on-site (and some nearby) vendors and concessionaires and aims to promote a positive image of the airport and the State of Alaska in the minds of travellers. This volunteer, self-funded committee mystery shops at partnering companies provides awards of cash, free covered parking, and donated prizes to winning employees.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On May 1, 1969, a Mobil Oil Canadair CL-44 on final approach to runway 6L at ANC, the undercarriage beam bogie snapped upon landing. The right wing and no. 3 and 4 engines struck the runway. The aircraft swerved onto the grass, breaking off the right wing. A fire erupted but all four occupants managed to escape. The probable cause was the co-pilot, who was conducting the landing, didn&#x27;t level off correctly and supervision by the captain was inadequate. The aircraft was destroyed and written off.
* On October 1, 1970, Douglas R4D-6 N47 of the Federal Aviation Administration crashed shortly after take-off and was destroyed in the subsequent fire. The aircraft was operating a local training flight. Both crew members were killed.
* On November 27, 1970, Douglas DC-8-63 of Capitol Airlines crashed on takeoff from Anchorage, killing 47 of 229 passengers and crew on board, operating as Capitol Flight 3/26.
* On January 13, 1977, JAL Cargo Flight 8054, a McDonnell-Douglas DC-8-62F, crashed shortly after takeoff with a cargo of live beef cattle for delivery to Tokyo, Japan. The three crew members and the two cargo handlers aboard the aircraft died in the crash, and the aircraft was destroyed. The National Transportation Safety Board determined that the probable cause of the accident was a stall that resulted from the pilot&#x27;s control inputs aggravated by airframe icing while the pilot was under the influence of alcohol.
* On December 4, 1978, a Learjet 25C en route from Juneau crashed upon landing. On board were Ann Stevens, wife of U.S. Senator Ted Stevens; lobbyist and former Alaska Commissioner of Commerce and Economic Development (and future U.S. Ambassador to Brazil) Langhorne A. Motley, prominent Anchorage lawyer Joseph Rudd, and three others. The party was travelling from the second-term inauguration of Alaska governor Jay Hammond to an Anchorage fundraiser organized by Motley. Motley and Ted Stevens were the only survivors.
* On June 8, 1983, Reeve Aleutian Airways Flight 8&#x27;s propeller separated from the Lockheed L-188 Electra and tore a hole in the fuselage over the Pacific Ocean, causing explosive decompression and loss of control. The pilots managed to land the aircraft safely at Anchorage, and all 15 passengers and crew survived. Since the propeller fell into the sea the cause of the separation is undetermined.
* On December 23, 1983, the 1983 Anchorage runway collision occurred when Korean Air Lines Flight 084, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10 freighter bound for Los Angeles, attempted to take off on the wrong runway in dense fog and collided with SouthCentral Air Flight 59, a Piper PA-31 waiting to take off in the opposite direction. Both aircraft were destroyed, the three flight crew of the DC-10 were seriously injured, and three of the nine occupants of the PA-31 sustained minor injuries, but no fatalities resulted.
*On December 15, 1989, KLM Flight 867 entered a volcanic ash cloud after takeoff, created by an eruption from nearby Mount Redoubt. The flight suffered a complete loss of engine power and returned to make an emergency landing at Anchorage. 
* On March 31, 1993, a Boeing 747-121, Japan Air Lines Flight 46E, operated by Evergreen International Airlines, departing Anchorage for Chicago, suffered a complete loss of the number 2 engine pylon at 2,000 ft after encountering severe-to-extreme turbulence after takeoff. The aircraft then experienced an uncommanded left bank of approximately 50 degrees. The flight crew successfully landed the aircraft back at Anchorage, to discover the number 2 engine and all of the leading edge of the wing between the number 1 and 2 engines had been torn away. The investigation found that the engine pylon had been weakened by metal fatigue cracking, which made the engine more susceptible to separation in severe turbulence.
* On October 9, 2002, a Boeing 747-451, Northwest Airlines Flight 85 en route from Detroit to Tokyo, suffered a lower rudder hardover. While flying over the Bering Sea, the aircraft abruptly went into a 35- through 40-degree left bank after the lower rudder had swung left 17° and hydraulic failure caused it to be stuck in place. Captain Frank Geib and First Officer Mike Fagan were at the controls at the time, having just taken over from Senior Captain John Hanson and First Officer David Smith. Geib declared an emergency and turned the aircraft back towards Anchorage. Hanson had returned to the cockpit and soon took over the controls. He and Fagan then flew the aircraft for over an hour before successfully landing in Anchorage. To steer the aircraft, they had to use asymmetric engine thrust or varying input into the engines as they were unable to use the ailerons at the time. No passengers or crew were injured, but the incident resulted in an airworthiness directive to prevent the possibility of a future accident.
* On November 30, 2018, the airport was hit by a magnitude 7.1 earthquake which shook the terminal and damaged buildings and the tower. FedEx 49 was on final approach to runway 7R when the quake hit. Tower ordered them to go around and FedEx 49 declared a missed approach. 117 people were injured in the terminal when the ceiling came down.

==Media appearances==
The airport was the focus of a Smithsonian Channel miniseries &quot;Ice Airport Alaska&quot; that ran in late 2020. It has also been shown in the Discovery Channel series &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;.

<text>Angrboða (Old Norse: ; also Angrboda) is a&quot; jötunn&quot; in Norse mythology. She is the mate of Loki and the mother of monsters. She is only mentioned once in the Poetic Edda (&quot;Völuspá hin skamma)&quot; as the mother of Fenrir by Loki. The Prose Edda (&quot;Gylfaginning&quot;) describes her as &quot;a giantess in Jötunheimar&quot; and as the mother of three monsters: the wolf Fenrir, the Midgard serpent Jörmungandr, and the ruler of the dead Hel.

==Name==
The Old Norse name &quot;Angrboða&quot; has been translated as &#x27;the one who brings grief&#x27;, &#x27;she-who-offers-sorrow&#x27;, or &#x27;harm-bidder&#x27;. The first element is related to the English word &quot;anger&quot;, but means &quot;sorrow&quot; or &quot;regret&quot; in Old Norse, the later meaning is retained in Scandinavian languages. In Norwegian and Danish the word is rendered as &quot;anger&quot; while Icelandic and Faroese has &quot;angur&quot; and Swedish &quot;ånger&quot;. The second element &quot;boða&quot; is cognate with the English word &quot;bode&quot; as in &quot;this does not bode well&quot;.

According to some scholars, the name &quot;Angrboða&quot; is probably a late invention dating from no earlier than the 12th century, although the tradition of the three monsters born of Loki and a &quot;jötunn&quot; may be of greater age.

==Attestations==

=== Angrboða ===
In &quot;Völuspá hin skamma&quot; (Short Völuspá; a poem of &quot;Hyndluljóð&quot;), Angrboða is mentioned as the mate of Loki and mother of the wolf (Fenrir).

&quot;Gylfaginning&quot; (Beguiling of Gylfi) mentions the three monstrous children of Angrboða: the wolf Fenrir, the Midgard serpent Jörmungand, and the ruler of the dead Hel.

===Giantess in Ironwood===

&quot;Völuspá&quot; (Prophecy of the Völva) also mentions a &quot;jötunn&quot; living in Járnvid (Ironwood, the forest where female &quot;jötnar &quot;live), most likely identified with Angrboða.
This stanza is paraphrased by Snorri Sturluson in &quot;Gylfaginning&quot;:
In the stanza 42 of &quot;Völuspá&quot;, Eggþér is portrayed as the herder of the &quot;jötunn&quot; who lives in Járnviðr (Ironwood). Peter H. Salus and Paul B. Taylor argue that he may have been Angrboða&#x27;s wolf-herder.

==In popular culture==

In &quot;God of War Ragnarök&quot; (2022), Angrboða (in-game spelt as Angrboda) appears as a recurring character in the story.

Saturn&#x27;s moon Angrboda is named after her.

<text>Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport is a civil–military airport south of downtown Milwaukee, Wisconsin, United States. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2025–2029, in which it is categorized as a medium-hub primary commercial service facility. Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport covers and has five asphalt and concrete runways.

The airport is named in honor of United States Army General Billy Mitchell, who was raised in Milwaukee and is often regarded as the father of the United States Air Force. Along with being the primary airport for Milwaukee, Mitchell International is also used by travelers throughout Southern and Eastern Wisconsin and Northern Illinois. Since March 1941, the airport&#x27;s weather station has been used as the official point for Milwaukee weather observations and records by the National Weather Service, whose area office is located in Sullivan.

==History==
The original airfield was established in 1920 as Hamilton Airport by local business owner and aviator, Thomas F. Hamilton. Milwaukee County purchased the land on October 19, 1926, and renamed the airport Milwaukee County Airport. The first airport terminal there, the Hirschbuehl Farmhouse, opened in July 1927. That month, Northwest Airlines, Inc., began air service from Milwaukee to Chicago and Minneapolis/St. Paul. In August 1927, world-renowned aviator Charles Lindbergh visited the Milwaukee airport. Kohler Aviation Corporation began providing passenger service across Lake Michigan on August 31, 1929.

During the late depression years (1938–July 1940), a new two-story passenger terminal building was constructed by the Works Progress Administration. On March 17, 1941, the airport was renamed General Mitchell Field after Milwaukee native and air power advocate Brigadier General William &quot;Billy&quot; Mitchell. On January 4, 1945, Mitchell Field was leased to the War Department for use as a World War II prisoner-of-war camp. Over 3,000 prisoners and 250 enlisted men stayed at the work camp. Escaped German prisoners were often surprised to find a large German American population just beyond the fence.

The present terminal opened on July 20, 1955, and was designed by Leigh Fisher and Associates. It was renovated and expanded in 1985, designed by Miller, Meier, Kenyon, Cooper Architects and Planners Inc. The &quot;hammerhead&quot; section of the D concourse was added in 1990.

On June 19, 1986, the Milwaukee County Board of Supervisors renamed the airport General Mitchell International Airport. The airport was formerly a hub for AirTran Airways, Frontier Airlines, Midwest Airlines and North Central Airlines. The airport is owned and operated by Milwaukee County, but some Milwaukee business leaders and politicians have advocated privatization or leasing it to a third party for financial reasons.

In February 2019, the airport was renamed from &quot;General Mitchell International Airport&quot; to &quot;Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport,&quot; a rebranding meant to highlight the airport&#x27;s location; the old name is still used by the FAA and US government.

In March 2023, the airport was recognized by the Airports Council International as one of the best airports in the world, marking the second consecutive year the airport received this recognition. It was one of only 10 airports of any size in the U.S. to earn a 2022 ASQ &quot;Best Airport&quot; award.

===Expansion===
Mitchell International expanded the runway safety area at the end of the runways after an accident on January 21, 2007, when Northwest Airlines Flight 1726 skidded off the runway following an aborted takeoff. According to the FAA, most airports are encouraged to have a runway safety area no shorter than , though many airports do not. Construction of the runway safety areas began at the end of summer 2009 and was completed in fall 2012.

There was also a &quot;Master Plan&quot; idea to increase the terminal area by stretching the existing terminal (in some cases, to almost double the size) or begin construction of a separate terminal. Nearly all cases would involve major reconstruction on the airport itself, and would have a huge impact on the airport&#x27;s traffic. These plans were, however, drafted before Mitchell saw a significant reduction in carriers and flights. More recently, in 2012, there were discussions of closing one concourse as a cost-cutting move.

The approved 2018 Milwaukee County Budget contained initial funding for replacement of the now-closed Concourse E with a new International Terminal. It would replace the current International Arrivals Terminal (IAT) which has limited capacity and is not connected to the main terminal building. The new terminal was planned to open in 2020 after the demolition of Concourse E was completed. During October 2018, airport and Milwaukee County officials set a timeline for design, construction and completion of the new International terminal. Pre-design work and bidding concluded in November 2018, with construction set to begin in early 2021 and likely concluding in mid-2022. In May 2020, Milwaukee County announced with the COVID-19 pandemic severely reducing the airport&#x27;s operations and &quot;de facto&quot; ending international service temporarily, that the start of the project had been postponed. , no firm start date for the work has been determined, though airport officials are hopeful that work will begin in 2024. As of July 2024, the airport was seeking bids to demolish the existing concourse and build the new international concourse.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
Milwaukee Mitchell International Airport has one terminal with two concourses and 38 gates. All international arrivals lacking border pre-clearance must pass through the International Arrivals Building. Concourse C houses Southwest Airlines and United Airlines; and Concourse D houses the remaining airlines at the airport. There is also a Delta Sky Club in Concourse D.

The terminal houses the Mitchell Gallery of Flight (a non-profit museum) and a USO room on the concession level, along with the usual retail outlets, including a small food court and a branch of Renaissance Books which is believed to be the world&#x27;s first used book store in an airport. There are play areas for children throughout the facility. An observation lot along the northern edge of the airport is open to the public and tower communications are rebroadcast using a low-power FM transmitter for visitors to tune in on their car radios. There is also a new lot on 6th Street, with a Wisconsin historical marker giving the airport&#x27;s history. Previously located inside the security perimeter of a domestic concourse was a large clay &quot;peace mural&quot; from Leningrad, now Saint Petersburg in Russia. Created by Soviet citizens, it was exchanged for an equivalent clay mural made by Americans. The Milwaukee mural was covered up during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequently moved to the customs screening area of the International Arrivals Building in 2024.

In April 2017, all airlines housed in Concourse E began moving to Concourse C. This would allow the airport to remodel the concourse and move International Arrivals processing into the terminal. Following redevelopment of Concourse E, the current International Arrivals Building just north of the main terminals will close. Airport officials are hoping to begin work in 2024, with the redeveloped concourse designed to have between 2-5 gates per the airport&#x27;s Implementation Plan.

===U.S. Air Force===
The airport also hosts the General Mitchell Air National Guard Base on the eastern area of the airport property, home to the 128th Air Refueling Wing (128 ARW), an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit of the Wisconsin Air National Guard flying the Boeing KC-135R Stratotanker. The wing performs both Federal and State missions and consists of approximately 1000 Air National Guard personnel, both full-time Active Guard and Reserve (AGR) and Air Reserve Technicians (ART), as well as traditional part-time guardsmen, available for worldwide deployment. The wing also maintains a KC-135 flight simulator, providing training proficiency for its own crews, as well as other KC-135 flight crews in other air refueling wings and air mobility wings in the Regular U.S. Air Force, the Air Force Reserve Command and the Air National Guard.

Prior to 2007, a second military installation on the southwestern portion of the airport property was known as &quot;General Mitchell Air Reserve Station&quot; and was home to the 440th Airlift Wing (440 AW), an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit of the Air Force Reserve Command (AFRC) flying the C-130H Hercules. While based at General Mitchell ARS, the 440 AW numbered in excess of 1500 full-time AGR, ART and part-time traditional reservists. Pursuant to 2005 Base Realignment and Closure Commission (BRAC) action, the 440 AW relocated to Pope AFB, North Carolina, in 2007 and the former AFRC facilities were turned over to the Air National Guard, resulting in the installation&#x27;s renaming.

*From 1944 through 2024, 291,421,492 passengers (enplaned+depaned) have passed through Milwaukee Mitchell Int&#x27;l Airport, an annual average of 3,597,796 passengers per year.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On December 17, 1954, a Miller Brewing Company plane, a converted twin-engine Lockheed Ventura bound for Winnipeg on a Friday evening, had trouble with both engines and crashed shortly after takeoff from Mitchell Field. All four on board were killed, which included company president Fred Miller and his oldest son, 20-year-old Fred Jr., and the two company pilots, brothers Joseph and Paul Laird.
* On August 4, 1968, a Convair CV-580, flying as North Central Airlines Flight 261, collided in mid-air with a rented Cessna 150F southwest of the airport. The Cessna was destroyed, but its cabin remained embedded in the Convair&#x27;s forward baggage compartment; the Cessna&#x27;s three occupants were killed. The Convair made a safe emergency landing at Milwaukee. The Cessna was on a VFR flight from Lombard, Illinois to Sheboygan County Memorial Airport in Sheboygan Falls. It was determined that the inability of the Convair 580 flight crew to detect the Cessna 150 visually in sufficient time to take evasive action, despite having been provided with three radar traffic advisories, caused the crash. Visual detection capabilities were reduced by the heavy accumulation of insect smears on the windows of the Convair. Visibility was further reduced by haze, smoke and sunglare, and by the inconspicuous color and lack of relative motion of the Cessna.
* On January 29, 1969, a Boeing KC-97, operated by the Wisconsin Air National Guard, crashed just short of the runway on final approach. The weather was foggy with a visibility of a half mile. Four of the 11 people on board were killed and the plane was damaged beyond repair.
* On January 22, 1971, Northwest Airlines Flight 433 was hijacked after taking off from Milwaukee to Detroit, Michigan. The hijacker demanded to be taken to Algeria, but landed in Cuba.
* On July 27, 1974, a USMC Hawker Siddeley AV-8A Harrier crashed during a hover maneuver at as part of an air show demonstration flight. The impact of the crash initiated the firing of the pilot&#x27;s ejection seat and the pilot survived.
* On September 6, 1985, Midwest Express Flight 105, Midwest&#x27;s first and only fatal accident, crashed upon takeoff from Milwaukee. One of the airline&#x27;s Douglas DC-9s crashed while taking off, bound for Atlanta&#x27;s Hartsfield International Airport. According to NTSB reports, the crash was caused by improper pilot reaction when the plane&#x27;s right engine failed due to stress corrosion cracking. The improper flight control inputs caused an uncommanded roll and accelerated stall. The 31 people on board died.
* On December 10, 1993, a Wisconsin Air National Guard KC-135 blew up on the ground. Six maintenance personnel died.
* In early August 1997, an SR-71 declared an in-air emergency prior to a fly-by at the Oshkosh Airshow and diverted to General Mitchell International Airport. No one was hurt in the incident.
* On January 21, 2007, a Northwest Airlines DC-9, Northwest Airlines Flight 1726 skidded off the end of a snowy runway at Milwaukee International Airport. The accident was due to an explosion in one of the engines, forcing the pilot to abort takeoff. The aircraft was headed for Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and was to continue on to Buffalo Niagara International Airport. Amongst the 104 people aboard, only one back injury was reported.
* On January 23, 2007, two Freight Runners Express cargo planes collided and burned on a taxiway. Both pilots were able to escape without injury. The planes were a Cessna 402 and a Beech 99. An NTSB investigation determined both pilots and air traffic control were at fault for the accident.
* On June 4, 2007, a Cessna Citation II crashed after reporting a runaway trim tab. The pilot issued a distress signal within five minutes after taking off. The plane then crashed into Lake Michigan two miles (3 km) off shore. The plane was carrying an organ transplant team from the University of Michigan back to Willow Run Airport. There was a crew of two and four passengers aboard. All six died.

<doc id="271106" wikidata="Q13826" url="?curid=271106" title="Isabela (province)">
<text>Isabela, officially the Province of Isabela (; ; ), is the second largest province in the Philippines by land area located in the Cagayan Valley. Its capital and the largest local government unit is the city of Ilagan. It is bordered by the provinces of Cagayan to the north, Kalinga to the northwest, Mountain Province to the central-west, Ifugao and Nueva Vizcaya to the southwest, Quirino, Aurora and the independent city of Santiago to the south, and the Philippine Sea to the east.

This primarily agricultural province is the rice and corn granary of Luzon due to its plain and rolling terrain. In 2012, the province was declared as the country&#x27;s top producer of corn with 1,209,524 metric tons. Isabela was also declared the second-largest rice producer in the Philippines and the Queen Province of the North.

The province has four trade centers in the cities of Ilagan, Cauayan, Santiago and the municipality of Roxas. Santiago is considered to have the fastest-growing local economy in the entire Philippines.

==Etymology==
The province was named during the time that the Philippines was under Spanish control, and named after Isabella II, who was queen regnant of Spain from September 29, 1833, until September 30, 1868, when she was deposed in the Glorious Revolution, and her formal abdication two years later.

There have been proposals to change the name to something more indigenous, but these were rejected by the people of Isabela. 

==History==
The province of Isabela used to be a vast rainforest where numerous indigenous ethnolinguistic groups lived. Many of the same ethnic groups still live in the province. Shell midden sites and other archaeological sites throughout the province constitute the material culture of those groups during the classical era. 

=== Spanish colonial period ===

During the Spanish era, prior to 1856, the Cagayan Valley was divided into only two provinces: Cagayan and Nueva Vizcaya. The Province of Cagayan at that time consisted of all towns from Tumauini to Aparri in the north. All other towns from Ilagan southward to Aritao composed the Province of the old Nueva Vizcaya. In order to facilitate the work of the Catholic missionaries in the evangelization of the Cagayan Valley, a royal decree was issued on May 1, 1856, creating the Province of Isabela consisting of the towns of Gamu, Old Angadanan (now Alicia), Bindang (now Roxas) and Camarag (now Echague), Carig (now Santiago City) and Palanan, all detached from the Province of Nueva Vizcaya; while Cabagan and Tumauini were taken from the Province of Cagayan. The exception is Palanan, which was established in 1625 by Spanish forces who arrived by ship from the Pacific coastal town of Baler in Tayabas province (now part of Aurora). Thus, Palanan was originally a part of Pampanga, then to Laguna, Tayabas (now Quezon Province; Tayabas became independent from Laguna), and Nueva Ecija, before being transferred to Nueva Vizcaya and finally Isabela. Also, unlike the rest of Cagayan Valley, it was served by Franciscan missionaries from Baler rather than the Dominicans. The population of the town was natively Paranan, then subsequently augmented by local Negritos, migrants from Baler who are Tagalogs and outlaws from Cagayan Valley, with the lingua franca of the settlement being Tagalog as opposed to Ilocano or Ibanag.

The province was placed under the jurisdiction of a governor (Lieutenant Colonel of Cavalry Francisco Contreras y Urtasun) with Ilagan as the capital, where it remains up to present. It was initially called &quot;Isabela de Luzón&quot; and also &quot;Isabela del Norte&quot; to differentiate from other places in the Philippines bearing the name of Isabela. The new province was named after Queen Isabella II of Spain. During that time, the Spanish controlled only the areas along the Cagayan River, leaving the Mallig Plants, the Magat River and the Sierra Madre Mountains to Gaddang tribes. 

The &quot;Atta&quot; or Negritos were the first people in valley. They were later moved to the uplands or variably assimilated by the Austronesians, from whom the Ibanags, Itawes, Yogads, Gaddangs, Irayas, Malawegs, and Paranans descended - who actually came from one ethnicity. These are the people found by the Spaniards in the different villages along the rivers all over Cagayan Valley, including present Isabela. The Spaniards rightly judged that these various villagers came from a single racial stock and decided to make the Ibanag language the &quot;lingua franca&quot;, both civilly and ecclesiastically for the entire people of Cagayan which they called collectively as the &quot;Cagayanes&quot; which later was transliterated to become &quot;Cagayanos&quot;. 

Various other peoples, mainly the Ilocanos, Pangasinenses, Kapampangans and Tagalogs, as well as Visayans, Moros, Ivatans, and even foreigners like the Chinese, Indians, Arabs, Spaniards and others were further infused to the native Cagayanes to become the modern &quot;Cagayano&quot;, and &quot;Isabeleño&quot; in the exact province, that we know today.

=== American colonial era ===
Although the province did not play a major role in the revolt against Spain, it is in Palanan that the final pages of the Philippine Revolution were written when United States troops, led by General Frederick Funston, finally captured General Emilio Aguinaldo on March 23, 1901. To commemorate this historical event, in 1962 the town officials constructed a monument by the Palanan City Hall, right on the spot where General Aguinaldo was captured, to memorialize the historic event. The monument was inaugurated on June 12, 1962, Philippine Independence Day, and still stands. 

Isabela was re-organized as a province under the American military government through &quot;Act No. 210&quot;, passed August 24, 1901.

The Americans built schools and other buildings and instituted changes in the overall political system. However, the province&#x27;s economy remained predominantly agricultural, with rice replacing corn and tobacco as the principal crop. 

=== Japanese occupation ===
World War II stagnated the province&#x27;s economic growth but it recovered dramatically after the war. In 1942, Imperial Japanese forces occupied Isabela. In 1945, the liberation of Isabela commenced with the arrival of the Philippine Commonwealth troops under the 11th Infantry Regiment, Philippine Army, USAFIP-NL and the recognized guerrillas attacked by the Japanese Imperial forces in World War II. 

A new wave of immigration began in the late 19th and 20th centuries with the arrival of the Ilokano who came in large numbers. They now constitute the largest group in the province, and it was only in this large-scale Ilocano immigration &amp; settlement that made Ilocano language replaced Ibanag as the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the province. Other ethnic groups followed that made Isabela the &quot;Melting Pot of the Northern Philippines&quot;.

=== Postwar era ===

In the years after the Second World War, Isabela was ruled by the Dy family for 35 years (1969-2004). The dynasty was started by the patriarch of the family, Faustino N. Dy Sr., who served as the mayor of Cauayan from 1965 to 1969 and sat as provincial governor for 22 years (1969–1992), surviving the initial attempts of President Ferdinand Marcos to remove him for being a member of the political opposition during the imposition of Martial Law in 1972 and winning reelection in 1988 after his removal by President Corazon Aquino after he had sided with Marcos in 1986. 

=== During the Marcos dictatorship ===

By the first term of the presidency of Ferdinand Marcos, Isabela had become known among students activists for its remoteness and the poverty of its agricultural workers, making it a favorite destination for &quot;dissatisfied, alienated young activists.&quot; So when the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP) was established in 1968 after splitting from the largely-defeated old Communist Party (Partido Komunista ng Pilipinas-1930), Isabela became one of the first strongholds of its armed wing, the New People&#x27;s Army. The actual size of the NPA at the time was very small, reportedly with only 60 guerrillas and 35 WWII-era guns as of 1969. But Marcos hyped up its formation, supposedly because this would help build up political and monetary support from the US. The Armed Forces had a number of initial successes against the NPA in Isabela at this time, including the discovery of the Taringsing Documents in Cordon outlining plans for a communist takeover; and the failed landing of arms bound for the NPA in Palanan during the MV Karagatan incident in 1972. These incidents were cited as some of the justifications for the declaration of Martial Law by Marcos later that year.

With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under Martial Law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years. This period in Philippine history is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship. Two of the major detention centers for political detainees located in Isabela were Camp Melchor F. dela Cruz in Barangay Upi in Gamu, in which officers of the Armed Forces Northern Luzon Command were also stationed; and the Headquarters of the Isabela Province Philippine Constabulary in Barangay Baligatan, Ilagan. renamed Camp Lt. Rosauro Toda Jr. in 2020.

The province of Isabela became a particular center of both conflict and protest when Marcos cronies Danding Cojuangco and Antonio Carag managed to block a Spanish-era grant which was supposed to see the return of Hacienda San Antonio and Hacienda Santa Isabel in Ilagan to local farmers. Cojuangco and Carag purchased the two haciendas themselves, displacing tens of thousands of farmers who were supposed to get those lands back a hundred years after the Spanish acquired them.

In its desire to serve its parishioners, the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ilagan hosted a Social Action Center which would help the farmers. In the Social Action Center&#x27;s newsletter, the &quot;Courier,&quot; researcher Sabino Padilla Jr. documented and exposed the ways by which Cojuangco, Carag, the provincial government, and the military harassed the farmers who were supposed to get the land. This all led to a protest march in joined by 12,000 protesters from all over Isabela, and eventually, for 4,000 farmers to finally get the titles to their land. But it also earned the ire of the administration.

In 1982, Padilla and 12 others were arrested by the regime and jailed under poor conditions at the Bayombong, Nueva Vizcaya Stockade of the Philippine Constabulary until almost the end of the Marcos regime. In 1983, soldiers went as far as to raid the residence of the Bishop of Ilagan, Miguel Purugganan, in search of alleged rebels and firearms. They found none but continued to keep Bishop Puruggananan and the church workers under him under military surveillance.

In 1985, three councilors from Barangay Ibujan in the municipality of San Mariano, including Ibanag community leader Luis Gabriel who had rejected overtures for the establishment of a local CHDF base in the town, were forcibly taken by heavily armed men who claimed that they needed the three as guides. However, the three were never seen again, and they eventually became counted among the many desaparecidos during the Marcos dictatorship.

It was also during the dictatorship that Marcos began awarding logging concessions to his cronies in the areas of the Sierra Madre region, which heralded the beginning of widescale deforestation and other environmental problems that affect the province since then, despite Marcos creating the Palanan Wilderness Area in 1978 which was later expanded by President Fidel V. Ramos to become the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park in 1997. 

In 1975, construction began on the Magat Dam on the boundary of Ramon, Isabela with neighboring Ifugao Province, becoming a catchbasin for 8 rivers upstream in Ifugao and serving multiple functions, including: irrigating of agricultural lands; flood control; and power generation. The construction was protested by the Ifugao people due to the flooding of their ancestral lands, but the dam was eventually completed in 1982, partially funded through a loan from the World Bank.

After the People Power Revolution in 1986, many of the activists who had joined the underground movement decided to &quot;surface,&quot; as the new administration of Corazon Aquino released political prisoners and initiated peace talks. However, anticommunist sentiment in her new cabinet made the peace process difficult, and negotiations eventually collapsed, and the insurgency in Isabela persisted.

=== Contemporary ===

Following the 1986 People Power Revolution, known as the current Fifth Philippine Republic, under the 1987 Philippine Constitution, various changes have been attempted since then in the province.

Dy Sr. was succeeded by his son, Benjamin G. Dy, in the gubernatorial seat from 1992 to 2001. Another Dy took over the gubernatorial seat in 2001 when Faustino Dy Jr. won the 2001 elections after having served as the district representative of the 2nd Legislative District of the province from 1992 to 2001. It was only in the 2004 elections that the family&#x27;s control of the gubernatorial seat ended when Grace Padaca, a former journalist, won over Faustino Dy Jr. She was the first woman to serve as the governor of the province. After serving for six years (2004-2010), Padaca was defeated in the 2010 National Elections by Faustino &quot;Bojie&quot; G. Dy III who served as governor of the province for three consecutive terms (2010-2019). He was then succeeded by Rodolfo &quot;Rodito&quot; Albano III, a member of the Albano dynasty that dominates Isabela&#x27;s 1st congressional district.

In July 1994, the municipality of Santiago was converted into an independent-component city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act 7720&quot;. In February 1998, the &quot;Republic Act 8528&quot; was enacted which amended certain sections of the &quot;Republic Act 7720&quot; causing Santiago to be a component city in the province of Isabela. However, in September 1999 through court ruling which granted the petition to declare &quot;Republic Act 8528&quot; unconstitutional, hence, the status of Santiago was reverted back to independent-component city, due to lack of plebiscite. Santiago is geographically located in Isabela but not under the administration of the province. Its electorates are prohibited to participate in the provincial-level elections except in the 4th legislative district of Isabela where the city belongs for congress representation.

In June 1995, &quot;Republic Act 7891&quot; was passed, legislating that Isabela be divided into two new provinces: Isabela del Norte and Isabela del Sur. A referendum was held on the same year with a slight majority voting against partitioning the province.

In 1999, the municipality of Ilagan, also serving as the capital town of the province, sought to become a city by virtue of &quot;Republic Act 8474&quot;. The plebiscite held on March 14, 1999, turned down its first bid for cityhood. The majority of the people voted &quot;no&quot; in that event. In its second attempt to achieve cityhood, the campaign did not go through due to lack of concurrency in the senate in 2006. Finally, Ilagan became a city, after its third move gained 96% of the votes in a plebiscite conducted on August 11, 2012. The night after the plebiscite, Ilagan was declared as a component city in the province by virtue of &quot;Republic Act 10169&quot;.

In 2001, the municipality of Cauayan became a component city in the province of Isabela through the ratification of &quot;Republic Act 9017&quot;.

In 2019, the province was reorganized into six districts, thereby increasing the number of legislative districts from four to six. Cities and municipalities were retained and others were reapportioned to the current district assignments.

====2020 Ulysses Flood ====

Cagayan has been heavily impacted by changing weather pattern changes resulting from climate change, with the 2020 Ulysses flood being counted as one of the most severe examples.

In November 2020, Typhoon Vamco (locally known in the Philippines as Typhoon Ulysses) crossed the country, dams from all around Luzon neared their spilling points, forcing them to release large amounts of water into their impounds including Magat Dam. The dam opened all of its 7 gates at , releasing over 5,037 cubic metres (1,331,000 US gal) of water into the Cagayan River flooding numerous riverside towns.

Because there was very little media coverage of the flooding in the area in the wake of the COVID-19 lockdown in Luzon and the Shutdown of ABS-CBN broadcasting earlier that year, residents resorted to social media to request the national government for rescue. As a result of the catastrophe, the National Irrigation Administration (NIA) indicated that it would review its protocols regarding the release of water in Magat Dam and improve its watershed.

==Geography==
Isabela comprises an aggregate land area of , representing almost 40 percent of the regional territory. It is the largest province in the island of Luzon and the second largest province in the Philippines by land area. Occupying the central section of the Cagayan Valley region in Luzon, Isabela is bordered by Cagayan to the north, Kalinga to the northwest, Mountain Province to the central-west, Ifugao and Nueva Vizcaya to the southwest, Quirino to the south, and Aurora to the south. To the east lies the Philippine Sea, making Isabela one of the typhoon-prone provinces in the country.

The province is divided into three physiographic areas. The eastern area, straddled by the Sierra Madre mountain range, is rugged and thickly forested. A substantial portion is uncharted. These unexplored hinterlands are home to a rich variety of flora and fauna, and some are under government reservations. It is home to one of the world&#x27;s largest remaining low-altitude rainforests, with numerous unknown endemic species of flora and fauna and biological diversity in the protected area known as the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park. Isabela has of Cagayan Valley’s of forest cover.
The highest point of the province is located near the border with Cagayan. Mount Dos Cuernos peak has an elevation of located in San Pablo near the border with Maconacon. Other notable peaks in the Northern Sierra Madre Natural Park is Mount Cresta in Divilacan with an elevation of .

The western area is a fertile valley hemmed by the Central Cordillera. It is crisscrossed by the mighty Cagayan River, Siffu River, and Magat River.

===Mallig Plains region===

Mallig Plains is a region in the western section of the province. Its name was derived from the rolling terrains or kilometers of plain lands in western part of Isabela. The municipality of Roxas serves as the business center of the region. The Plains encompassing the municipalities of Quezon, Mallig, Quirino, Burgos, Aurora, San Manuel and Roxas.

===Administrative divisions===
Isabela is politically subdivided into thirty-four (34) municipalities, two component cities and one independent component city. The province is represented in the Philippine House of Representatives with six legislative districts.

The province has ten first class municipalities, two second class cities and one first class independent component city. Ilagan City, which became a city thirteen years after its failed cityhood proposal in 1998, it is now Luzon’s largest and the country’s fourth largest city by land area after Davao City, Puerto Princesa and Zamboanga City.



===Barangays===
The 34 municipalities and 3 cities of the province comprise 1,055 barangays, with &quot;Rizal&quot; in Santiago City as the most populous in 2010, and &quot;Catalina&quot; in Cauayan as the least. If cities are excluded, &quot;Bugallon Proper (Poblacion)&quot; in Ramon has the highest population, and &quot;Uauang-Tuliao&quot; in Santo Tomas has the lowest.

==Government==
===Governors===

After Isabela was re-organized as a province under the American regime in 1901, its first provincial governor was Rafael Maramag, a former Municipal President and also the first Municipal President of the capital town Ilagan. He was succeeded by his brother, Gabriel. Since 1969, the position has been occupied mostly by members of the Dy family, a political dynasty based in Cauayan that has expanded to neighboring municipalities. The current governor is Rodolfo &quot;Rodito&quot; Albano III, a member of the Albano dynasty that dominates Isabela&#x27;s 1st congressional district and is an ally of the Dys.

===Legislative districts===
On September 27, 2018, &quot;Republic Act No. 11080&quot;, an act reapportioning the province of Isabela into six legislative districts from four, was signed into law and the reapportioned districts elected its representatives starting in the 2019 midterm elections. Accordingly, the six districts are as follows:

*First District: Cabagan, Delfin Albano, Divilacan, Ilagan City, Maconacon, San Pablo, Santa Maria, Santo Tomas, and Tumauini.
*Second District: Benito Soliven, Gamu, Naguilian, Palanan, Reina Mercedes, and San Mariano.
*Third District: Alicia, Angadanan, Cabatuan, Ramon, and San Mateo.
*Fourth District: Cordon, Dinapigue, Jones, Santiago City, and San Agustin.
*Fifth District: Aurora, Burgos, Luna, Mallig, Quezon, Quirino, Roxas, and San Manuel.
*Sixth District: Cauayan City, Echague, San Guillermo, and San Isidro.

Ilocanos are the most prominent group in the province. Of the total household population, 68.71 percent classified themselves as Ilocanos, followed by the Ibanags (14.05 percent), and Tagalogs (10.02 percent). The majority ethnic group were the Ibanags, who were first seen by the Spanish explorers and converted to Christianity by missionaries, the reason why the Ibanag language had spread throughout the valley region prior to the arrival of the migrating Ilocanos. The remaining 7.22 percent are either Gaddang, Paranan, Yogad, or from other ethnic groups who have assimilated into the Ibanag-Ilocano culture. More recently, a new group from the south, the Muslim Filipinos, have migrated to this province and have made a community for themselves. In addition to this, Tagalog-speaking peoples from Central Luzon (mostly from Nueva Ecija and Aurora) and Southern Luzon have also settled in the area, as well as a few Pangasinans and Kapampangans from the Central Luzon and Cebuanos and Hiligaynons from Visayas and Mindanao; the majority of the population of Palanan are Tagalogs, with ancestors being settlers from Baler, Aurora during Spanish territorial rule.

===Languages===
Major languages spoken are Ilocano followed by Ibanag, Yogad, and Gaddang. Ilocanos and Ibanags speak Ilocano with an Ibanag accent, as descendants of Ilocanos from first generation in Isabela who lived within Ibanag population learned Ibanag; same situation with Ilocano tinged by Gaddang, Paranan, Yogad, and Itawis accents when descendants of Ilocanos from first generation in Isabela who lived within Gaddang, Paranan, Yogad, and Itawis populations learned their languages. People especially in the capital and commercial centers speak and understand English and Tagalog. Tagalogs, Ilocanos, and Ibanags speak Tagalog with an Ibanag accent, as descendants of Tagalogs from first generation in Isabela who lived within Ibanag population learned Ibanag. Languages not native in Isabela are also spoken there such as Maranao, Maguindanaon, Tausug, Pangasinan, Kapampangan, Cebuano and Hiligaynon to varying degrees by their respective ethnic communities within the province.

There are also a small number of Muslims.
==Economy==

In terms of income classification, Isabela is rated as first-class province and considered among the richest and most progressive province in the Philippines and the most progressive in Region 02 courtesy of the three key cities strategically located in the province.

===Trade and industry===

Strategically located at the center of Cagayan Valley region, Isabela is acknowledged to have demonstrated strengths in business and industry. Thus, it has come to be known as the &quot;Regional Trade and Industrial Center&quot; of north-eastern Luzon.

The province of Isabela is the richest in Cagayan Valley. It is also the 9th Richest Province in the Philippines last 2021.

The cities of Cauayan, Ilagan, Santiago and the town of Roxas are the principal commercial centers of the province. Metro Manila-based malls and fast food chains have recently opened in these key trading hubs. To date, 192 banking branches operate in the province, with most of the universal and commercial banks providing automated teller machines for the convenience of their clients.

Since the start of the 21st century, a growing number of foreign and local investors have selected Isabela as site of their business ventures. Heading the list are Isabela&#x27;s top investors, namely: Mindanao Grains Processing Company, Inc., SN Aboitiz Power- Magat Inc., Universal Leaf Philippines, Coca-Cola Beverages Philippines, Inc., San Miguel Corporation, RC Cola and Pepsi Cola.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture is the biggest industry in Isabela. As the country&#x27;s top corn producing province, it contributes 13.02% of the annual national yellow corn production. Asia&#x27;s largest post-harvest corn processing facility, the Mindanao Grains, is located in the town of Reina Mercedes.

As second highest rice-growing province nationwide, Isabela produces 15% of the aggregate national rice production on an annual basis. Being a surplus producer of the Filipinos’ staple crop, the province&#x27;s rice sufficiency rate is at 224%, which means that Isabelinos produce more than they consume and are in fact responsible for supplying the rice requirements of Metro Manila and many other provinces. The unprecedented increase in palay production of Isabela made the province the &quot;Hybrid Rice Champion&quot; of the Philippines.

High-value agricultural crops grown in Isabela include monggo, tobacco, coffee, banana, and mango. Its livestock and poultry industries are also on the rise, especially dairy processing, hog production, cattle breeding, and commercial poultry raising.

Farming is highly mechanized as most of the agricultural lands are irrigated. With the presence of the Isabela State University, joint ventures and other foreign assisted projects and the Magat Dam contribute to the high productivity in agriculture. It is also the hub of trade and commerce and other economic activities due to its central location in the region. The wood industry used to be a top earner for the province but due to the logging ban imposed in the Cagayan Valley Region, activities in this industry considerably declined. However, furniture making using narra wood and other indigenous forest materials continue to exist.

Isabela is one of the most progressive provinces of the Philippines having been adjudged as the most outstanding province on food security in the &quot;Gawad Sapat Ani Awards 2000&quot;. For corn production, Isabela ranks first among the top ten corn producing provinces for cy 2004, contributing 15.70% to national production. In 2013, the Department of Agriculture declared Isabela as the &quot;Best Corn-Quality Awardee&quot;. Ilagan City was proclaimed as the &quot;Corn Capital of the Philippines&quot; for being the top corn producer among the 34 municipalities and 2 cities of the province as well as in the whole country.

===Forestland===
Forestland covers 54.37% or of Isabela&#x27;s total land area of which 62% is protected forest and 38% is production forest. The best quality of timber resources in the Philippines are found in Isabela&#x27;s forests. Isabela&#x27;s vast forest resources are now being ecologically managed to effect sustainable forest-based resource not only for the wood working industry but to secure a balanced ecosystem. The woodwork industry continues to operate under a regulated system, particularly the making of furniture using indigenous materials.

===Fisheries===
Isabela has a fertile fishing ground on the Pacific Coast. The Magat Dam reservoir is utilized for fish cage operations for tilapia production for domestic markets. Another thriving industry in the province is aquaculture, sustained by inland fishing through 1,108 hectares of developed freshwater fishponds and 450 hectares of fish cage culture at Magat Dam Reservoir. There are 238 marine fish species that were identified by the Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources in Isabela&#x27;s coastal seaboard municipalities of Maconacon, Divilacan, Palanan, and Dinapigue.

===Mineral and energy===
Large deposits of copper, gold, zinc and chromite, manganese and nickel have been found in Isabela. It also has extensive deposits of non-metallic minerals such as limestone, clay, marbles, guano, sand and gravel, and boulders. Indigenous energy sources such as natural gas and hydroelectric capabilities have been found to be abundant in the valley. Many of its mineral reserves have yet to be fully tapped.

===Power===


Solar and biomass power plants in the city of Cauayan and in the town of Alicia have started operating in 2015 to supplement the region&#x27;s high energy demand. The online solar power plant in Cauayan is capable of supplying at least 20 megawatts while the biomass power plant in Alicia can produce another 20 megawatts. Both systems provide clean and renewable energy. The P2 billion power facility established by the &quot;Isabela Biomass Energy Corporation&quot; (IBEC) was built to augment power supply in the Cagayan Valley region. The use of biomass as fuel makes the power plant carbon neutral and sustainable. This biomass power facility is the first in the region and is designed to provide economical source of energy as well as job opportunities to residents of the host town/city.

On 27 May 2015, the service contract of the largest solar PV power plant in the country has been approved by the Department of Energy (DOE). The P7-billion worth 100 MW Solar PV project in the city of Ilagan is designed to reduce the current shortage of electricity that causes regular blackouts that results to industry closures as well as inconvenience to the consumers. The solar power facility will be constructed at a 100-hectare land at Barangay Cabannungan, several kilometers away from the city proper.

In December 2022, the Department of Energy (DOE) has given the go signal to a Filipino-French joint venture to develop one of the biggest renewable energy projects in the Philippines - an P18-billion solar farm in Ilagan City. The project will be undertaken by San Ignacio Energy Resources Development Corporation, which is part of the Nextnorth Energy Group developing over 450 megawatts of solar and hydro projects in Northern Luzon, and French firm Total Eren S.A. The project will involve the development of a 440 MWp/336 MWac solar PV project to be built on around 400 hectares of available land located along the Northern Luzon high voltage transmission network of the National Grid Corporation of the Philippines (NGCP). The project is scheduled to start construction in 2024 and start feeding electricity into the grid in 2025.

== Transportation ==
Isabela is accessible by all means of transportation. Almost 180-kilometers of the Pan-Philippine Highway pass through the different towns and cities of the province. Several bus companies offer daily trips to different routes like Manila, Dagupan, Baguio, Ilocos, and vice versa. Public utility vans and small-time bus operators ply daily trips from Tuguegarao in Cagayan to Santiago City vice versa, while jeepneys and tricycles are commonly used as the basic mode of transportation within the province&#x27;s jurisdiction.

===Ilagan–Divilacan Road===

The construction of an 82-kilometer route across the Sierra Madre National Park is intended to improve access to the province&#x27;s three coastal communities. The project&#x27;s authorized budget contract, worth P1.5 billion, will traverse across the foothills of the Northern Sierra Madre mountain ranges, which cover 359,486 hectares. The idea is to rehabilitate an ancient logging route that was utilized until the 1990s by a defunct logging firm. It will begin in Barangay Sindon Bayabo in Ilagan City and end at Barangay Dicatian in Divilacan&#x27;s seaside town. The project is scheduled to conclude in 2021.

The secluded coastal settlements of Divilacan, Palanan, and Maconacon are frequently accessible only by boat or plane, making them difficult to reach at times of emergencies and calamities. There are no highways connecting Ilagan&#x27;s capital city to the coastal districts, denying locals access to basic commodities and social services such as health care. Once completed, the route is projected to bolster coastal economies, citing Divilacan&#x27;s 119-hectare beach and freshwater areas that have attracted tourists. Resolution No. 11 of the Protected Area Management Board (PAMB) reclassifies areas of the Sierra Madre as a special-use zone. Additionally, the Agta and Dumagat communities in the vicinity have signed a memorandum of understanding with the provincial administration expressing their support for the road project. At least 1,800 Agta and Dumagat have made their homes in park areas. However, the road&#x27;s impact on the protected forest has upset neighbors, who believe the project will harm the region&#x27;s woods and ecosystems. The project has been delayed in recent years due to worries about the road&#x27;s possible environmental impact. The Cagayan Valley Regional Development Council required that the road&#x27;s proponents conduct a comprehensive analysis of the road&#x27;s impact on the area&#x27;s biodiversity.

===Airports and sea ports===
There are three airports in the province. The Cauayan Airport is the primary airport in the province serving a trip to Manila, Palanan, and Maconacon. The other two are the Palanan Airport in Palanan and Maconacon Airport in Maconacon. The country&#x27;s leading passenger airline Cebu Pacific services the Cauayan-Manila-Cauayan Route. Light planes operated by Cyclone Airways and WCC Aviation&#x27;s Sky Pasada Have flights from Cauayan Domestic Airport to the community airports in Palanan and Maconacon. The province has two minor seaports, the Divilacan Port and Palanan Port in the coastal towns of Divilacan and Palanan. The trade going to the ports comes primarily from major seaports in Cagayan such as Port of Aparri in Aparri, Cagayan, and Port of San Vicente and Port Irene, both in Santa Ana, Cagayan. The other two airstrips are found in Divilacan, and in Magat River Management Project Site.

==Education==
Isabela is one of the primary centers of education in the Cagayan Valley Region. There are several public and private educational institutions, the most notable being the Isabela State University, a government-owned and controlled public university.

The number of inhabitants is 791.&quot; The church and convent as seen today in the town of Alicia, was built by Fr. Tomas Calderon, OP and inaugurated in 1849, with Fr. Francisco Gainza, OP, then vicar of Carig (now Santiago City). The church was dedicated to the Nuestra Señora de Atocha, more popularly known today as Our Lady of Atocha. The church is known for its antique Castilian architectural design and can be found along the Maharlika Highway and is accessible by land transport. 
* Our Lady of the Pillar Parish Church in Cauayan was constructed by Fray Juan Prieto with the first class materials with galvanized roofing and a ceiling of bricks, dedicated to Nuestra Señora del Pilar. It had a tower which was later destroyed by a violent earthquake. Now, only the façade of the Cauayan Church remains in its original form. The original belfry is in ruins while a new nave and belfry was constructed and like the St. Mathias Church in the town of Tumauini, the facade has much interesting bas relief and portions of the bricks have numbers and symbols etched on it.
* Saint Ferdinand Parish Proto-Cathedral (Ilagan City) — This church can&#x27;t be seen on the highways or the main national road as it was located in the center of the city of Ilagan. The church features very high ceilings and walls made of bricks. It was around 1696 and 1700 that Fr. Miguel Matos, OP, built the church of stone and bricks. A typhoon in 1866 destroyed the roof of the church. Desiring to make the church bigger, Fr. Pablo Almazan, OP, demolished the solid walls of the church, which, unfortunately, was never built. The walls of the church today are of modern make. It is known to house one of the oldest bells in the region. The church is dedicated to the patron saint of the Diocese of Ilagan, San Fernando. At present, it is designated as a &quot;proto-cathedral&quot; by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Ilagan. On 29 October 2023, a mass was held for the celebration of the first Holy Rosary Festival wherein the pilgrim image of the &quot;St. Ferdinand Parish - Our Lady of the Most Holy Rosary&quot; was episcopally crowned by Most Rev. David William V. Antonio, D.D., STHD., bishop of the Diocese of Ilagan. On April 22, 2024, a fire started from the roof of the 300-year old church which destroyed most of its interior.
* National Shrine of Our Lady of the Visitation of Guibang is located in town of Gamu, frequented by travelers passing by the Maharlika Highway. It comes alive every year on the month July when religious pilgrims visit to offer prayers during its feast day. The image of the &quot;Our Lady of the Visitation&quot; was canonically crowned by the Most Rev. Carmine Pocco, Papal Nuncio to the Philippines on May 26, 1973, at the former St. Ferdinand Cathedral (now St. Ferdinand Parish Proto-Cathedral) in Ilagan City. The Catholic Bishops Conference of the Philippines at its 52nd Annual Bishop&#x27;s Meeting held in Tagaytay on January 24–26, 1986 have approved the petition of Miguel Purugganan, former Bishop of the Diocese of Ilagan for the Church of &quot;Our Lady of the Visitation of Guibang&quot; to be called a National Shrine.

<text>Montecristo, also Monte Cristo (, ) and formerly Oglasa (), is an island in the Tyrrhenian Sea and part of the Tuscan Archipelago. Administratively it belongs to the municipality of Portoferraio in the province of Livorno, Italy. The island has an area of , is approximately wide at its widest point, and is long; the coasts are steep, and extend for . The island is a state nature reserve and forms part of the Tuscan Archipelago National Park.

Much of the island&#x27;s fame is derived from the fact that it provides the title of 1844 novel &quot;The Count of Monte Cristo&quot;, by Alexandre Dumas, and is one of the novel&#x27;s settings.

==History==
The history of the island begins with the Iron Age. The Etruscans exploited the forests of oak needed to fuel the bloomeries of the mainland where the iron ore of Elba&#x27;s mines was melted. The Greeks gave Montecristo its oldest known name, &quot;Oglasa&quot; or &quot;Ocrasia&quot;, after the yellowish colour of the rocks. The Romans, however, knew it under the name &quot;Mons Jovis&quot; (&quot;Mount Jupiter&quot;), and erected an altar to Iuppiter Optimus Maximus on the highest mountain, of which some traces remain. During the imperial age, the Romans opened some quarries to extract granite, perhaps used in the construction of villas on the islands of Giglio, Elba, and Giannutri.

Around the middle of the fifth century AD, the caves of the island became home to several hermits escaping from the Vandals of Genseric, the most important of whom was St. Mamilian. They christened the island &quot;Mons Christi&quot; (&quot;Mountain of Christ&quot;), from which the modern name is derived.

At the beginning of the seventh century, Pope Gregory the Great submitted them to the monastic rule of the Benedictines. In this period, the Monastery of St. Mamilian was founded; as a result of donations to the Church, its wealth became legendary, and a chapel was built in the St. Mamiliano Cave where the saint had lived in the fifth century. In 1216, the monks joined the order of the Camaldolese. Thanks to the donations of several noble families, the monastery became powerful and rich, and this gave rise to the legend of treasure hidden on the island.

The island was once a possession of the Republic of Pisa, but was later acquired by the Principality of Piombino. In 1553, Ottoman pirate Dragut, heading for Elba, stormed the monastery, enslaved the monks, and decreed its end. After that, the island was uninhabited. In the second half of the sixteenth century, together with most of the Tuscan Archipelago, it became part of the Stato dei Presidi, a client Spanish state.

The island was annexed to the French Empire under Napoleon; after his fall, it became the possession of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. The first attempts to colonise Monte Cristo, at the time owned by Charles Cambiagi, were made in 1840 by two German hermits, Augustin Eulhardt and Joseph Keim, who eventually abandoned the attempt. In 1843, other people arrived with the intention of cultivating the island: young Tyrolean Adolph Franz Obermüller, and after a few months, Frenchman Charles Legrand and his girlfriend. Also during 1843, there were other attempts of colonisation by French agriculturalist George Guiboud, which ended with yet another failure. In 1846, some Genoese made a similar effort, while in 1849 Frenchman Jacques Abrial was able to farm the island for three years. In 1852, a rich Englishman named George Watson-Taylor bought Montecristo and transformed Cala Maestra into a garden, planting eucalyptus and many exotic plants, among them the Asiatic &quot;Ailanthus altissima&quot;, an invasive species which now infests the island. The few modern buildings of Montecristo, such as the Royal Villa, date from this period. The island was then purchased by the Italian government on 3 June 1869 for the sum of £100,000. Montecristo had previously been plundered in 1860 by Italian exiles living in London, who had come to Italy to join up with the &quot;Camicie rosse&quot;, but were shipwrecked on the island. Faced with the huge sum of money claimed by the owner to repair the damage, the government thought it better to buy the island, which was still uninhabited.
After other attempts at colonisation in 1878, the Italian government founded a penal colony there, a branch of that in Pianosa.

In 1889, Montecristo was given to Marquess Carlo Ginori, who restored the Villa and transformed the island into a hunting ground.

In 1896, Montecristo was the honeymoon destination of Victor Emmanuel III of Savoy (at that time crown prince) and Elena of Montenegro, and after 1899 it became a royal hunting ground for Victor Emmanuel&#x27;s exclusive use.

During the Second World War the island, important because of its position between Italy and occupied Corsica, was garrisoned by the Italian army.

In the late 1940s, the Italian Navy Intelligence Agency temporarily took over the island for use as a training base for covert agents. Among Italian officers assigned as instructors were Count Marco deCarrobio and Luigi Ferri. The would-be agents belonged to a right wing Albanian expatriate organization known as the Bloku Kombetar Independent led by activist Alush Leshanaku, according to Shyqri Bicaku, an Elbasan native, who underwent training; Bicaku was also taught to use a field radio and became so proficient he was hired on to instruct secret agents from Romania to use the radio for their October, 1951 covert parachute drop into Romania&#x27;s mountains; the Romanians were captured, tried and executed.

Montecristo was used as a Navy training base only from September to November 1948, when the trainees were transferred to Italy&#x27;s west coast. Four of the trained agents were parachuted into Albania in February, 1949, but soon quit their mission and escaped to Greece due to a failed field radio.

After several episodes of vandalism and speculation attempts, the nature reserve was established in 1971.

In December 2011 it was reported that black rats, present on the island at least since Roman times, have greatly increased in numbers and pose a serious threat to the birds of Montecristo. Due to the inaccessibility of the terrain, the island was bombed from the air with poison pellets, as had recently been attempted on Giannutri and Sardinia, despite concerns raised by environmental groups that indigenous species of wildlife and the surrounding waters might also be adversely affected. The Ailanthus trees were also to be eradicated.

==Geography and climate==

Montecristo is located in the Tyrrhenian Sea east of Corsica, south of Elba, west of the island of Giglio and the Monte Argentario peninsula, southeast of the island of Pianosa and east of the Scoglio d&#x27;Africa rock, also known as Formica di Montecristo.

The island, formed by the heaving of a submarine pluton, has a slightly elliptical shape, and is wholly mountainous, with several rock ledges rising steeply from the sea. It consists almost entirely of granodiorite with large crystals of orthoclase. The mountain chain that crosses the island has three main peaks: Monte della Fortezza (645 m), Cima del Colle Fondo (621 m) and Cima dei Lecci (563 m). Montecristo&#x27;s only natural harbour is &quot;Cala Maestra&quot;, on the northwest side. The island has plentiful water resources.

The island of Montecristo, like all the islands of the archipelago, has a mild climate, with a constant sea breeze, much sunshine, and very little rainfall (average annual values much lower than ); the climate is characterised by mild and moderately rainy winters and summers that are hot and dry, but sometimes very muggy.

==Wildlife==

The conditions that restricted the establishment of human settlements on Montecristo have favoured the preservation of its flora and fauna. Animals and plants once found throughout the Mediterranean still live on the island. Of particular interest are the giant heather formations covering the valley floors and several thousand-year-old oaks that manage to survive at the highest altitudes. Also interesting are the Montecristo viper (&quot;Vipera aspis hugyi&quot;, a subspecies also present in southern Italy, and today considered introduced by humans) and &quot;Discoglossus sardus&quot;, an amphibian found only in a couple of islands in Tuscany and Sardinia. An endemic subspecies of lizard, &quot;Podarcis muralis calabresiae&quot;, thrives on the island. Montecristo is also a resting place for thousands of migratory birds and is home to large colonies of seabirds (particularly relevant the yelkouan shearwater, critically endangered on the island). The island also hosts the only Italian population of wild goats. The sea environment is quite rich: there are seagrass meadows, sea anemones, sea fans, corals and moonfishes. Until the 1970s the Mediterranean monk seal was also to be found, a critically endangered species that has become extremely rare in Italian waters. Endemic species include the plant &quot;Limonium Montis-christi&quot;, the invertebrate &quot;Oxychilus oglasicola&quot; (snail of Monte Cristo), also present on the islet of Scola, near Pianosa, and the reptile &quot;Podarcis muralis calabresiae&quot;.

===Island of Montecristo nature reserve===
Nowadays the island has only two permanent human inhabitants, both nature reserve keepers. In addition, agents of the State Forestry Corps from Follonica live there in alternating shifts of two weeks at a time. The state nature reserve &quot;Isola di Monte Cristo&quot; is a biogenetic reserve of 1,039 hectares established in 1971 by ministerial decree to protect the unique nature of the island. Today it belongs to the Tuscan Archipelago National Park. It was also awarded the European Diploma of Protected Areas in 1988, and recognized as a site of pan-European interest.
Visitors face a number of restrictions. It is not possible to stay overnight, and swimming, and surfing are prohibited within 1 kilometer of the coast. It is possible to cruise within three miles () of the coast, but fishing is not allowed. Access by sea is possible only at Cala Maestra (where the seabed is sandy) and with an approach course perpendicular to the coast; it is possible to dock at the pier or tie up against a buoy, but dropping anchor is not allowed; there is also a small heliport for emergencies. To visit the island, one must apply for access at the Forestry Corps in Follonica.

Visitors with basic authorization must stay at Cala Maestra, and can visit only the Royal Villa, the botanical garden, and the museum. The waiting list for access is long, since the limit for visitors has been set at only 1,000 per year. The average waiting time for approval to visit is three years, and priority is given to scientific expeditions, associations, and schools. Tours take place only on three existing trails, all of which are very challenging.

<text>Nueva Vizcaya, officially the Province of Nueva Vizcaya (; ; Pangasinan: &quot;Luyag/Probinsia na Nueva Vizcaya&quot;; ), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Cagayan Valley region in Luzon. Its capital and largest town is Bayombong. It is bordered by Benguet to the west, Ifugao to the north, Isabela to the northeast, Quirino to the east, Aurora to the southeast, Nueva Ecija to the south, and Pangasinan to the southwest. Quirino province was created from Nueva Vizcaya in 1966.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Nueva Vizcaya&quot; is derived from the name of the province of Biscay (called &quot;Vizcaya&quot; in Spanish, &quot;Bizkaia&quot; in Basque) during the Spanish colonial period. This can be seen in the right part of the seal, a representation of the heraldic of Vizcaya in Spain.

== History ==
=== Spanish colonial era ===
The areas of present-day Nueva Vizcaya used to be part of the vast Provincia de Cagayan. Organized religion in Nueva Vizcaya dates back to the year 1607, when the Dominican Order arrived in the province. It was not until 1609, however, that the first settlement of a religious order was established in the southern half of the province. In 1702, a convent was erected in Burubur at the foot of the Caraballo Mountains in Santa Clara, which is now a barangay in the town of Aritao. It was on this site that the first mass in Nueva Vizcaya was celebrated and the first baptism of a Christian convert was held.

Spanish conquest of Nueva Vizcaya was slow and arduous. Expeditions had to be sent again and again because the natives refused to accept Spanish sovereignty. In some of these expeditions, services of some Filipino chieftains were utilized. The most famous of these expeditions was that commanded by Mariano Oscariz, in 1847–1848, which carried him clear through the province across to Palanan on the eastern coast of Luzon.

In 1818, Nueva Ecija annexed the towns of Palanan from Isabela, as well as Cagayan, Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Baler, Casiguran, Infanta (formerly called Binangonan de Lampon) and Polillo Islands from Tayabas, and part of Rizal.

In 1839, upon the advice of the &quot;alcalde mayor&quot; of Cagayan, Luis Lardizabal, then-Governor General of the Philippines created the politico-military province of Nueva Vizcaya. The order was approved by a Royal Decree on April 10, 1841. The name Nueva Vizcaya was named after Biscay, Spain, the hometown of Lardizabal. The original province covered the areas of present-day Nueva Vizcaya, Quirino, Ifugao, Apayao, Kalinga, and Benguet, Batanes, a large portion of Isabela, as well as north Aurora. After Nueva Vizcaya was created, it included the present area occupied by the province plus present-day Mountain Province, much of Isabela, Quirino, &amp; north Aurora.

Civil government was established in the province by the Philippine Commission in 1902 during the American Colonial Period of the Philippines.

The territories of Nueva Vizcaya were greatly reduced when Nueva Vizcaya ceded a big portion of its north-eastern territory, including Camarag, its first capital, now Echague, to form the province of Isabela in May 1856.

=== American colonial era ===
In 1908, the northwestern territory of Nueva Vizcaya was annexed to the newly organized sub-province of Ifugao. The survey executed by the Bureau of Lands in 1914 further caused the diminution of its area and reduced again upon the enactment of the Administrative Code of 1917. North areas of present-day Aurora (composed of present towns of Dilasag &amp; part of Casiguran) were annexed to Tayabas (now Quezon) in 1905. In 1918, the area of modern Aurora north of Baler (composed of Dinalungan, Dipaculao, &amp; Maria Aurora, besides Casiguran &amp; Dilasag) was transferred to the authority of Nueva Vizcaya, but returned to Quezon Province in 1946.

The province of Nueva Vizcaya was also included in the 12th district of the Philippine Senate during the American period. The district included Mountain Province (present-day Apayao, Kalinga, Mountain Province, and Benguet), Cotabato (undivided), Agusan (undivided), Davao (undivided), Zamboanga (undivided), and Sulu (undivided). The province was included in the district because of its ethnic compatibility with Mountain Province and other indigenous domains in the Cordilleras and Mindanao.
=== Japanese occupation ===

During the Pacific War of the Second World War, the Japanese captured Nueva Vizcaya and established a &quot;comfort station&quot; in the province, where Filipino &quot;comfort women&quot; were enslaved, routinely gang-raped, and murdered under Japanese control. The Dalton Pass was the scene of a major battle between the Empire of Japan, the Commonwealth of the Philippines and American forces, with the Allies winning on May 31, 1945.

=== Philippine Independence ===
In 1971, with the passage of &quot;Republic Act No. 6394&quot;, Quirino, which was then a sub-province of Nueva Vizcaya, was separated from its mother province and made into a regular province.

== Geography ==
Surrounded by North Luzon&#x27;s three large mountain ranges, Nueva Vizcaya is generally mountainous, varying from steep mountains to rolling hills, with some valleys and plains. It is bordered on the west by the Cordillera mountains, on the east by the Sierra Madre mountains, and on the south by the Caraballo Mountains. The province (and the entire Cagayan Valley) are separated from the Central Luzon plains by the Caraballo Mountains.

The province has a total land area of . The southernmost province in the Cagayan Valley region, Nueva Vizcaya lies approximately north of Metro Manila and can be reached by land via the Cagayan Valley Road (Maharlika Highway).

=== Administrative divisions ===
Nueva Vizcaya comprises 15 municipalities, with Bayombong as the provincial capital and major educational center, Bambang (the agricultural hub) and Solano (the financial district) as the major commercial centers, and Kayapa as the summer capital and &quot;vegetable bowl&quot; of the province. All municipalities are encompassed by a lone legislative district, but are separated into two districts for purposes of representation in its provincial board. The 1st District comprises the municipalities of Ambaguio, Bagabag, Bayombong, Diadi, Quezon, Solano and Villaverde, while the 2nd District is composed of the municipalities of Alfonso Castañeda, Aritao, Bambang, Dupax del Norte, Dupax del Sur, Kayapa, Kasibu and Santa Fe.

Geographically, the western half of Nueva Vizcaya is part of the main Cordilleras, while its eastern half is part of the Caraballos, the meeting point of the Cordilleras and the Sierra Madre. There have been grassroot moves to reunify Nueva Vizcaya with the Cordillera Region due to cultural and geographical harmony, however, none have been introduced in Congress.


=== Barangays ===

The 15 municipalities of the province comprise a total of 275 barangays, with &quot;Roxas&quot; in Solano, Nueva Vizcaya as the most populous in 2010, and &quot;Santa Rosa&quot; in Santa Fe, Nueva Vizcaya as the least.

== Demographics ==


The population of Nueva Vizcaya in the 2020 census was 497,432 people, with a density of .

Nueva Vizcaya is home to about 18 indigenous peoples, which includes the major tribes of the Ifugao , Gaddang , Isinai , Dumagat , Kalanguya , and the Bugkalot . Indigenous peoples&#x27; groups have filed for ancestral domain titles covering parts of the province.

The Ilokano population in the province are not indigenous as they were part of the labor force initially needed by the Spanish administration to work on the tobacco plantations beginning in the 1700s, and later immigrants with skills construct churches and other structures needed for development. Indigenous tribes were not cooperative with the Spaniards. After several insurrections by the locals, Spanish officials chose to import trained labor from established settlements in the coastal regions of Pangasinan and Ilocos. So, it was deliberated in the Spanish Congress the need for in migration of labor. After it was voted by a majority and approved by the king, Ilocanos started to migrate and were given homestead. Thus, the start of the migration of Ilocanos in the province.

Every last week of May, these ethnolinguistic groups gather to celebrate the &quot;Ammungan&quot; festival (formerly &quot;Panagyaman&quot; festival), a week-long affair culminating on May 24, the province&#x27;s foundation day.

Since Nueva Vizcaya&#x27;s birth as a province, traces of the culture and customs of its early settlers—the Igorots Ilongots (Bugkalot), Ifugaos, Isinais, Kalanguya], Gaddangs, and the Pangasinans—can still be seen. The influx of civilization and the infusion of modern technology to the life stream of the province induced immigration from adjacent provinces. The province was pushed to be included in the Cordillera Autonomous Region because the province is technically within the Cordillera, however, it did not came to be due to the failure to enact an autonomous Cordillera by the national government. Today, questions linger on the exclusion of Nueva Vizcaya despite the province being culturally and geographically linked to the Cordilleras. The province also has the largest Igorot population outside the Cordillera region. Tagalogs live along the border of Nueva Ecija and in the capital, Bayombong.

=== Languages ===
Nueva Vizcaya province possesses one of the most diverse array of indigenous languages in Luzon, a testimony to its cultural and geographic linkages with the Cordillera mountain range. The indigenous languages of the province listed by the Komisyon ng Wikang Filipino are the &quot;Bugkalut language&quot;, &quot;Ibaloy language&quot;, &quot;Ifugaw language&quot;, &quot;Iguwak language&quot;, &quot;Irungdungan language&quot;, &quot;Isinay language&quot;, &quot;Kalanguya language&quot;, and &quot;Kankanaey language&quot;. During the later part of the Spanish regime, people from Ilocos region migrated to the province through the recommendation of Spanish officials in the province. It was deliberated in the Spanish court in Spain and with a majority vote and approval of the king of Spain, Ilocanos were allowed to migrate to the province. Thus, the importation of the Ilocano language and culture started, becoming the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the province. Ilocano accents were affected by the native languages of the peoples whom Ilocanos intermingled with. Remarkably, the economy of the province started to grow because of the industry of the Ilocanos as well as through their innate talent in entrepreneurship and in other industries including agriculture. As Nueva Vizcaya was part of Provincia de Cagayan which is the predecessor of Cagayan Valley, a few residents speak Ibanag, which was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Provincia de Cagayan before it was replaced by Ilocano.

=== Religion ===
Roman Catholics are about 63% of the population of the province. Other faiths are divided among Aglipayan Church, Iglesia ni Cristo which form about 5–6% of the province population, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, Baptist, Methodist, Pentecostals, Seventh-day Adventist and other Evangelical Christians which forms about 17%–20% of the province&#x27;s population as well as Muslims and indigenous Cordilleran religions.
== Economy ==

Agriculture is the main industry in the province, together with rice, corn, fruits and vegetables as major crops. Nueva Vizcaya is a major producer of citrus crops in the country, principally pomelo, ponkan and oranges. The Nueva Vizcaya Agricultural Terminal in Bambang supplies the demand of neighboring provinces and Metro Manila. There is a mining industry in the province such as the Didipio mine in the municipality of Kasibu, which added to the provincial income. However, mining activities have also been alleged to have dried up water sources, polluted the environment, and endangered livelihoods of farmers and fisherfolk.

According to the Mines and Geosciences Bureau, deposits of metallic minerals discovered in the province are copper, gold, molybdenum and pyrite. Non-metallic deposits include red clay, white clay and limestone, with sand and gravel being the most abundant deposits in the province.

On January 11, 2008, the Cagayan Bureau of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources (BFAR) stated that tilapia (species of cichlid fishes from the tilapiine cichlid tribe) production grew and Cagayan Valley is now the Philippines&#x27; tilapia capital (Saint Peter&#x27;s fish). Production supply grew 37.25% since 2003, with 14,000 metric tons (MT) in 2007. The recent aquaculture congress found that the growth of tilapia production was due to government interventions: provision of fast-growing species, accreditation of private hatcheries to ensure supply of quality fingerlings, establishment of demonstration farms, providing free fingerlings to newly constructed fishponds, and the dissemination of tilapia to Nueva Vizcaya (in Diadi town).
== Government ==

Nueva Vizcaya has one congressional district, although there has been a longtime proposal to divide the province into two congressional districts.

== Culture ==
Every May, the province holds the Ammungan Festival, a five-day festival in celebration for its founding anniversary. The word &quot;Ammungan&quot; is a Gaddang word meaning &quot;gathering&quot; symbolizing the unity of the different ethnolinguistic groups in the province. The festival showcase different shows including cultural showcase, beauty pagent, agri-trade fair, tourism expo, dance competitions and a concerts.

<text>Evagrius of Constantinople (; died 380) was the archbishop of Constantinople for a brief period in 370.

In 370, the Arians elected Demophilus of Constantinople to fill the bishopric vacancy after the death of Eudoxius of Antioch. The Nicene Christians and the deposed bishop of Antioch Eustathius of Antioch chose Evagrius for that see; but a few months later he was banished by the Roman emperor Valens, and remained in exile until his death.

Some sources claim that he was elected a second time in 379 or 380, after the expulsion of Demophilus by emperor Theodosius I.

<text>Quirino, officially the Province of Quirino (; ), is a landlocked province in the Philippines located in the Cagayan Valley region in Luzon. Its capital is Cabarroguis while Diffun is the most populous in the province. It is named after Elpidio Quirino, the sixth President of the Philippines.

The province borders Aurora to the southeast, Nueva Vizcaya to the west, and Isabela to the north. Quirino used to be part of the province of Nueva Vizcaya, until it became a sub-province in 1966, then it was separated in 1972.

==History==
===Early history===
Long before its formal creation as an independent province, Quirino was the forest region of the province of Nueva Vizcaya, inhabited by tribal groups known as the Negritos. They roamed the hinterlands and built their huts at the heart of the jungle. Aside from the Negritos, the area was also inhabited by Ilongot people, who were feared for their headhunting raids against enemy tribes and Spanish-controlled settlements. Throughout the period of Spanish colonization, the province was one of the few remaining unconquered areas in the Philippines due to its remoteness, having only seen a Spanish military expedition in 1848 and the brief presence of Spanish missionaries in 1891. 

=== Colonial era ===
During the American period, the territory of Quirino was administered by the province of Isabela before Congressman Leon Cabarroguis of Nueva Vizcaya pushed for its return to Nueva Vizcaya by authoring Republic Act No. 236, which was signed into law in 1948.

===Establishment as a separate province===
On June 18, 1966, Republic Act No. 4734 was enacted, constituting the municipalities of Diffun, Saguday, Aglipay, and Maddela, all from Nueva Vizcaya province, into a new sub-province to be known as &quot;Quirino&quot;, named after the late Philippine President Elpidio Quirino. The reasons for naming it for Elpidio Quirino are the Ilocano settlers in the area and he created the neighboring province Aurora sub-province of Quezon in 1951 through Republic Act No. 648 under his presidency. 

On June 21, 1969, Republic Act No. 5554 was enacted, amending RA 4734, and creating the municipality of Cabarroguis (now the provincial capital town), which was taken from portions of Diffun, Saguday, and Aglipay.

Republic Act No. 6394, authored by then-Congressman Leonardo B. Perez (Nueva Vizcaya–Lone), was passed on September 10, 1971, further amending RA 5554 and separating the sub-province of Quirino from its mother province, Nueva Vizcaya, constituting it into a regular province.

The province of Quirino was formally established on February 10, 1972, upon the assumption to office of the first elected provincial and municipal officials headed by Dionisio Sarandi as Provincial Governor.

On February 25, 1983, Batas Pambansa Blg. 345 was enacted, creating within Quirino the municipality of Nagtipunan, a division of the municipality of Maddela.

===Marcos dictatorship era===
The beginning months of the 1970s marked a period of turmoil and change in the Philippines, as well as in the localities which would later become the Province of Quirino.

In February 1972, the efforts of Quirino&#x27;s legislators finally managed to see its establishment as a separate province.

During his bid to be the first Philippine president to be re-elected for a second term, Ferdinand Marcos launched an unprecedented number of public works projects that caused the Philippine economy to take a sudden downwards turn known as the 1969 Philippine balance of payments crisis, which led to a period of economic difficulty and social unrest. With only a year left in his last constitutionally allowed term as president, Ferdinand Marcos placed the Philippines under martial law in September 1972 and thus retained the position for fourteen more years as a dictator.

In Quirino, one of the most significant events of this period were the logging concessions in the areas of the Sierra Madre region awarded to various Marcos cronies, which marked the beginning of widespread deforestation and other environmental problems in the province.

When the 1986 snap election came along, Quirino was noted as a site of political violence with the murder of UNIDO opposition party organizers Francisco Laurella and Fernando Pastor Sr., and Pastor&#x27;s son Fernando Pastor Jr., later attributed to Marcos party-mate and Quirino province assemblyman Orlando Dulay, who was convicted of the three murders in 1990.

==Geography==

The province is generally mountainous, with about 80 percent of the total land area covered by mountains and highlands. A large portion of the province lies within the Quirino Protected Landscape.

As Quirino was part of Provincia de Cagayan which is the predecessor of Cagayan Valley, a few residents speak Ibanag, which was the &quot;lingua franca&quot; of Provincia de Cagayan before it was replaced by Ilocano.

<text>Maximus I of Constantinople, also known as &quot;Maximus the Cynic&quot; (), was the intrusive archbishop of Constantinople in 380, where he became a rival of Gregory of Nazianzus.

== Biography ==
Born in Alexandria into a poor family, Maximus was the son of Christian parents, who had suffered on account of their religion; but whether from Pagan or Arian violence is not clear. Maximus united the faith of an orthodox believer with the garb and deportment of a Cynic philosopher. He was initially held in great respect by the leading theologians of the orthodox party. Athanasius of Alexandria, in a letter written about 371, pays him several compliments on a work written in defence of the orthodox faith.

In 374, during the reign of the Roman emperor Valens, in the persecution carried on by Lucius of Alexandria, Arian patriarch of Alexandria, Maximus was flogged, and banished to the Oasis, on account of his zeal for orthodoxy and the aid he offered to those who suffered in the same cause. He obtained his release in about four years, probably on the death of Valens; and sometime after his release he presented to the Roman emperor Gratian at Milan, his work, Περὶ τῆς πίστεως, &quot;De Fide&quot;, written against the Arians.

He wrote also against other heretics, but whether in the same work or in another is not clear; and disputed against the pagans. Apparently on his return from Milan he visited Constantinople, where Gregory of Nazianzus had just been appointed to the patriarchate (379). Gregory received him with the highest honour; and delivered a panegyrical oration (&quot;Oration 25&quot;), in the man&#x27;s own presence in full church, before the celebration of the Eucharist. He received him at his table and treated him with the greatest confidence and regard. He was, however, grievously disappointed in him. Whether the events which followed were the results solely of the ambition of Maximus, or whether Maximus was himself the tool of others, is not clear. Taking advantage of the sickness of Gregory, and supported by some Egyptian ecclesiastics, sent by Peter II of Alexandria, Patriarch of Alexandria, under whose directions they professed to act, Maximus was ordained, during the night, Patriarch of Constantinople, in the place of Gregory, whose election had not been perfectly canonical. The conspirators chose a night in when Gregory was confined by illness, burst into the cathedral, and commenced the consecration. They had set Maximus on the archiepiscopal throne and had just begun shearing away his long curls when the day dawned. The news quickly spread and everybody rushed to the church. The magistrates appeared with their officers; Maximus and his consecrators were driven from the cathedral, and in the tenement of a flute player the tonsure was completed.

This audacious proceeding excited the greatest indignation among the people, with whom Gregory was popular. Maximus withdrew to Thessalonica to lay his cause before the Roman emperor Theodosius I. He met with a cold reception from the emperor, who committed the matter to Ascholius, the much respected bishop of Thessalonica, charging him to refer it to Pope Damasus I. Two letters from Damasus I asked for special care that a Catholic bishop maybe ordained. Maximus returned to Alexandria and demanded that Peter II should assist him in re-establishing himself at Constantinople. Peter II appealed to the prefect, by whom Maximus I was driven out of Egypt.

As the death of Peter II and the accession of Timothy I of Alexandria are dated to 14 February 380, these events must have occurred in 379. The resignation of Gregory, who was succeeded in the patriarchate of Constantinople by Archi Nectarius of Constantinople, did not benefit Maximus I. When the First Council of Constantinople met in 381, Maximus I&#x27;s claim to the see of Constantinople was unanimously rejected, the last of its original four canons decreeing &quot;that he neither was nor is a bishop, nor are they who have been ordained by him in any rank of the clergy&quot;.

Maximus I appealed from the Eastern to the Western church. In the autumn of 381, a synod held either at Aquileia or at Milan under Ambrose&#x27;s presidency considered Maximus I&#x27;s claims. Having only his own representations to guide them, and there being no question that Gregory&#x27;s translation was uncanonical, while the election of Nectarius was open to grave censure as that of an unbaptized layman, Maximus I also exhibiting letters from Peter II the late venerable patriarch, to confirm his asserted communion with the church of Alexandria, the Italian bishops pronounced in favour of Maximus I and refused to recognize either Gregory or Nectarius. A letter of Ambrose and his brother prelates to Theodosius remonstrates against the acts of Nectarius as no rightful bishop, since the chair of Constantinople belonged to Maximus I, whose restoration they demanded, as well as that a general council of Easterns and Westerns, to settle the disputed episcopate and that of Antioch, should be held at Rome. In 382 a provincial synod held at Rome, having received more accurate information, finally rejected Maximus I&#x27;s claims.

The invectives of Gregory of Nazianzus against Maximus I were written after their struggle for the patriarchate, and contrast starkly with the praises of his twenty-fifth Oration. The work of Maximus I, &quot;De Fide&quot;, which is well spoken of by Jerome, is lost.

<text>Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy (5 July 1805 – 30 April 1865) was an English officer of the Royal Navy, politician and scientist who served as the second governor of New Zealand between 1843 and 1845. He achieved lasting fame as the captain of during Charles Darwin&#x27;s famous voyage, FitzRoy&#x27;s second expedition to Tierra del Fuego and the Southern Cone.

FitzRoy was a pioneering meteorologist who made accurate daily weather predictions, which he called by a new name of his own invention: &quot;forecasts&quot;. In 1854 he established what would later be called the Met Office, and created systems to get weather information to sailors and fishermen for their safety. He was an able surveyor and hydrographer. As Governor of New Zealand, serving from 1843 to 1845, he tried to protect the Māori from illegal land sales claimed by British settlers.

==Early life and career==
Robert FitzRoy was born at Ampton Hall, Ampton, Suffolk, England, into the upper echelons of the British aristocracy and a tradition of public service. Through his father, General Lord Charles FitzRoy, Robert was a fourth great-grandson of Charles II of England; his paternal grandfather was Augustus Henry FitzRoy, 3rd Duke of Grafton. His mother, Lady Frances Stewart, was the daughter of the first Marquess of Londonderry and the half-sister of Viscount Castlereagh, who became Foreign Secretary. From the age of four, Robert FitzRoy lived with his family at Wakefield Lodge, their Palladian mansion in Northamptonshire.

Robert&#x27;s half-brother Sir Charles FitzRoy later served as Governor of New South Wales, Governor of Prince Edward Island and Governor of Antigua.

In February 1818 at the age of 12, FitzRoy entered the Royal Naval College, Portsmouth, and in the following year he entered the Royal Navy. At the age of 14, he embarked as a voluntary student aboard the frigate , which sailed to South America in the middle of 1820, and returned in January 1822. He was promoted to midshipman while on the vessel, then served as such on HMS &quot;Hind&quot;.

He completed his course with distinction and was promoted lieutenant on 7 September 1824, having passed the examination with &#x27;full numbers&#x27; (100%), the first to achieve this result. After serving on , in 1828 he was appointed flag lieutenant to Rear-Admiral Sir Robert Waller Otway, commander-in-chief of the South American station, aboard .

At that time &quot;Beagle&quot;, under Captain Pringle Stokes, was carrying out a hydrographic survey of Tierra del Fuego, under the overall command of Captain Phillip Parker King in HMS &quot;Adventure&quot;. Pringle Stokes became severely depressed and fatally shot himself. Under Lieutenant Skyring, the ship sailed to Rio de Janeiro, where Otway appointed FitzRoy as (temporary) captain of the &quot;Beagle&quot; on 15 December 1828. By the ship&#x27;s return to England on 14 October 1830, FitzRoy had established his reputation as a surveyor and commander.

During the survey, some of his men were camping onshore when a group of Fuegian natives made off with their boat. His ship gave chase and, after a scuffle, the culprits&#x27; families were brought on board as hostages. Eventually FitzRoy held two boys, a girl and two men (one man escaped). As it was not possible to put them ashore conveniently, he decided to &quot;civilise the savages&quot;, teaching them &quot;English ... the plainer truths of Christianity ... and the use of common tools&quot; before returning them as missionaries.

The sailors gave them names: the girl was called Fuegia Basket (so named because the replacement for the stolen boat was an improvised coracle that resembled a basket), the younger boy Jemmy Button (FitzRoy allegedly &#x27;purchased&#x27; him with a large pearl button), the man York Minster (after the large rock so-named near which he was captured). The second, elder, boy he named Boat Memory. FitzRoy brought the four back with the ship to England. Boat Memory died following a smallpox vaccination. The others were cared for and taught by the trainee missionary Richard Matthews; they were considered civilised enough to be presented at Court to King William IV and Queen Adelaide in the summer of 1831.

==HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;″s second voyage==
In early May 1831 FitzRoy stood as Tory candidate for Ipswich in the general election, but was defeated. His hopes of obtaining a new posting and organising a missionary project to Tierra del Fuego appeared to be failing. He was arranging for the charter of a ship at his own expense to return the Fuegians with Matthews when his friend Francis Beaufort, Hydrographer to the British Admiralty, and his &quot;kind uncle&quot;, the Duke of Grafton, interceded on his behalf at the Admiralty. On 25 June 1831 FitzRoy was re-appointed commander of the &quot;Beagle&quot;. He spared no expense in fitting out the ship.

He was conscious of the stressful loneliness of command. He knew of the suicides both of Captain Stokes and of his uncle Viscount Castlereagh, who had cut his own throat in 1822 while in government office. FitzRoy talked to Beaufort in August 1831, asking him to find a suitable gentleman companion for the voyage. Such a companion should share his scientific tastes, make good use of the expedition&#x27;s opportunities for researching natural history, dine with him as an equal, and provide a semblance of normal human friendship. While those Beaufort first approached (including Professor J. S. Henslow of the University of Cambridge) turned the opportunity down, FitzRoy eventually approved Charles Darwin for the position. Before they left England, FitzRoy gave Darwin a copy of the first volume of Charles Lyell&#x27;s &quot;Principles of Geology&quot;, a book the captain had read that explained terrestrial features as the outcome of a gradual process taking place over extremely long periods. FitzRoy took a request from Lyell to record observations on geological features, such as erratic boulders.

FitzRoy and Darwin got on well together, but there were inevitable strains during the five-year survey voyage. The captain had a violent temper, his outbursts had gained him the nickname &quot;Hot Coffee&quot;, which resulted in quarrels sometimes &quot;bordering on insanity&quot;, as Darwin later recalled. On a memorable occasion in March 1832 at Bahia, Brazil, Darwin was horrified at tales of the treatment of slaves. FitzRoy, while not endorsing brutality, recounted how an &quot;estancia&quot; owner once asked his slaves if they wished to be free and was told they did not. Darwin asked FitzRoy if he thought slaves could answer such a question honestly when it was posed by their master, at which the captain lost his temper and, before storming out, told Darwin that if he doubted his word they could no longer live together; effectively he banished Darwin from his table. Before nightfall FitzRoy&#x27;s temper cooled and he sent an apology, with the request that Darwin &quot;continue to live with him.&quot; They avoided the subject of slavery from that time on. None of their quarrels were over religious or doctrinal issues; such disagreements came after the voyage.

At the island of &quot;Buttons Land&quot; in Tierra del Fuego they set up a mission post, but when they returned nine days later, the possessions had been looted. Matthews gave up, rejoining the ship. He left the three &quot;westernised&quot; Fuegians to continue the missionary work.

While in the Falkland Islands, FitzRoy bought a schooner out of his own funds to assist with the surveying tasks he had been asked to complete. He had it refitted and renamed &quot;Adventure&quot;, hoping that the cost would be reimbursed by the Admiralty. They returned to the mission post but found only Jemmy Button. He had returned to native ways and refused the offer to go with them back to England.

At Valparaiso in 1834, while Darwin was away from the ship exploring the Andes, the Admiralty reprimanded FitzRoy for buying the &quot;Adventure&quot;. He took the criticism badly, selling the schooner and announcing they would go back to recheck his survey, then resigning his command with doubts about his sanity. The ship&#x27;s officers persuaded him to withdraw his resignation and continue as planned once Darwin returned to the ship. FitzRoy continued his voyage, sailing on to the Galapagos, Tahiti, New Zealand, Australia and South Africa. He detoured to Bahia in Brazil on the return voyage so that he could carry out an additional check, to ensure the accuracy of his longitude measurements before returning to England.

==Return from the voyage==
Soon after the &quot;Beagle&quot; return on 2 October 1836, FitzRoy married Mary Henrietta O&#x27;Brien, a young woman to whom he had long been engaged. Darwin was amazed, as not once during the entire five years of the trip had FitzRoy spoken about being engaged.

FitzRoy was awarded the Royal Premium by the Royal Geographical Society in 1837. Extracts from his diary read to the society on 8 May 1837 included the observation:
:Is it not extraordinary, that sea-worn, &quot;rolled&quot;, shingle-stones, and alluvial accumulations, compose the greater portion of these plains? How vast, and of what immense &quot;duration&quot;, must have been the actions of these waters which smoothed the shingle-stones now buried in the deserts of Patagonia!&quot;

FitzRoy wrote his account of the voyage, including editing the notes of the previous captain of the &quot;Beagle.&quot; It was published in May 1839 as the &quot;Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle,&quot; in four volumes, including Darwin&#x27;s &quot;Journal and Remarks, 1832–1836&quot; as the third volume. FitzRoy&#x27;s account includes a section of &quot;Remarks with reference to the Deluge&quot; in which he admits that, having read works &quot;by geologists who contradict, by implication, if not in plain terms, the authenticity of the Scriptures&quot; and &quot;while led away by sceptical ideas,&quot; he had remarked to a friend that the vast plain of sedimentary material they were crossing &quot;could never have been effected by a forty days&#x27; flood.&quot; He wrote that in his &quot;turn of mind and ignorance of scripture,&quot; he was willing to disbelieve the Biblical account. Concerned that such ideas might &quot;reach the eyes of young sailors,&quot; he explains in detail his renewed commitment to a literal reading of the Bible, with arguments that rock layers high in the mountains containing sea shells are proof of Noah&#x27;s Flood and that the six days of creation could not have extended over aeons because the grass, herbs and trees would have died out during the long nights.

R. D. Keynes, in his introduction to the 2001 edition of Darwin&#x27;s diary, suggests that FitzRoy had undergone a religious conversion. He was dissociating himself from the new ideas of Charles Lyell, which he had accepted during the voyage, and from Darwin&#x27;s account which embraced these ideas. Under the influence of his very religious wife, he asserted a new commitment to the doctrine of the established Church of England.

In 1841 FitzRoy was elected as a Tory as one of the two members of Parliament for Durham. He was appointed Acting Conservator of the River Mersey in 1842.

==Governor of New Zealand==

The first governor of New Zealand, Captain William Hobson, R.N., died in late 1842. The Church Missionary Society, which had a strong New Zealand presence, suggested FitzRoy as his successor and he was appointed by the government. He took up his new task in December 1843. On the journey to New Zealand, he met William John Warburton Hamilton and made him his private secretary.

His instructions were to maintain order and protect the Māori, while satisfying the land hunger of the settlers pouring into the country. He was given very few military resources. Government revenue, mainly from customs duties, was woefully inadequate for his responsibilities.

One of his first tasks was to enquire into the circumstances surrounding the Wairau Affray, in which there had been violent conflict between settlers and the Maori. He found the actions of the colonists to have been illegal and declined to take any action against Te Rauparaha. He did not have the troops to meet him on anything like equal terms. But the New Zealand Company and the settlers felt betrayed and angry. He appointed a Government Superintendent for the area, to establish a ruling presence. Fitzroy also insisted that the New Zealand Company pay the Māori a realistic price for the land they claimed to have purchased. These moves made him very unpopular.

Land sales were a continuing vexatious issue. The settlers were eager to buy land and some Māori were willing to sell, but under the provisions of the Treaty of Waitangi, land sales required the Government as an intermediary, and were thus extremely slow. FitzRoy changed the rules to allow settlers to purchase Māori land directly, subject to a duty of ten shillings per acre. But land sales proved slower than expected.

To meet the financial shortfall, FitzRoy raised the customs duties, then replaced them with property and income taxes. All these expedients failed. Before long the Colony was faced with bankruptcy, and FitzRoy was forced to begin issuing promissory notes, paper money without backing.

Meanwhile, the Māori in the far North, around the Bay of Islands, who had been the first to sign the Treaty of Waitangi, were feeling increasingly sidelined and resentful of the changes that had taken place in New Zealand. To signal their resentment, Hōne Heke cut down the flagpole at Kororāreka. Rather than address the problems, FitzRoy had the flagpole re-erected. Hone Heke cut it down again, four times altogether; by the fourth occasion the First New Zealand War, sometimes called the Flagstaff War or the Northern War, was well under way.

FitzRoy quickly realized that he did not have the resources to bring about a quick end to the war. Meanwhile, the spokesmen for the New Zealand Company were active back in the United Kingdom, lobbying against FitzRoy&#x27;s governorship, which they presented to the House of Commons in a very poor light. As a result, he was shortly afterwards recalled and replaced by George Grey, then governor of South Australia. Grey was given the backing and financial support that FitzRoy had needed but was denied.

==Later life and impact on meteorology==

FitzRoy returned to Britain in September 1848 and was made superintendent of the Royal Naval Dockyards at Woolwich. In March 1849 he was given his final sea command, the screw frigate .

In 1850, FitzRoy retired from active service, partly due to ill health. The following year, in 1851, he was elected to the Royal Society with the support of 13 fellows, including Charles Darwin.

In 1854, on the recommendation of the President of the Royal Society, FitzRoy was appointed as chief of a new department to deal with the collection of weather data at sea. His title was &quot;Meteorological Statist to the Board of Trade&quot;, and he had a staff of three. This was the forerunner of the modern Meteorological Office. He arranged for captains of ships to provide information, with tested instruments being loaned for this purpose, and for computation of the data collected.

FitzRoy soon began to work on strategies to make weather information more widely available for the safety of shipping and fishermen. He directed the design and distribution of a type of barometer which, on his recommendation, was fixed at every port to be available to crews for consultation before setting out to sea. Stone housings for such barometers are still visible at many fishing harbours. The invention of several different types of barometers was attributed to him. These became popular and continued in production into the 20th century, characteristically engraved with &quot;Admiral FitzRoy&#x27;s special remarks&quot; on interpretation, such as: &quot;When rising: In winter the rise of the barometer presages frost.&quot;

A storm in 1859 that caused the loss of the &quot;Royal Charter&quot; inspired FitzRoy to develop charts to allow predictions to be made in which he coined the term &quot;weather forecast&quot;. Fifteen land stations were established to use the new telegraph to transmit to him daily reports of weather at set times. The first daily weather forecasts were published in &quot;The Times&quot; in 1861. The 1859 storm resulted in the Crown distributing storm glasses, then known as &quot;FitzRoy&#x27;s storm barometers&quot;, to many small fishing communities around the British Isles.

In 1860, FitzRoy introduced a system of hoisting storm warning cones at the principal ports when a gale was expected. He ordered fleets to stay in port under these conditions. The &quot;Weather Book,&quot; which he published in 1863, was far in advance of the scientific opinion of the time. Queen Victoria once sent messengers to FitzRoy&#x27;s home requesting a weather forecast for a crossing she was about to make to the Isle of Wight.

Many fishing fleet owners objected to the posting of gale warnings, which required that fleets not leave the ports. Under this pressure, FitzRoy&#x27;s system was abandoned for a short time after his death. The fishing fleet owners reckoned without the pressure of the fishermen, for whom FitzRoy had been a hero responsible for saving many lives. The system was eventually reinstated in simplified form in 1874.

When &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; was published FitzRoy was dismayed and apparently felt guilty for his part in the theory&#x27;s development. He was in Oxford on 30 June 1860 to present a paper on storms and attended the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science at which Samuel Wilberforce attacked Darwin&#x27;s theory. During the debate FitzRoy, seen as &quot;a grey haired Roman nosed elderly gentleman&quot;, stood in the centre of the audience and &quot;lifting an immense Bible first with both and afterwards with one hand over his head, solemnly implored the audience to believe God rather than man&quot;. As he admitted that &quot;The Origin of Species&quot; had given him &quot;acutest pain&quot;, the crowd shouted him down.

FitzRoy debunked Lieutenant Stephen Martin Saxby&#x27;s lunar weather forecasting method as pseudoscience. Saxby tried to counter FitzRoy&#x27;s arguments in the second edition of his book &quot;Saxby Weather System&quot; (1864).

===Death and legacy===

FitzRoy had been promoted to rear-admiral on the reserved list in 1857 and was advanced to vice-admiral in 1863. In the coming years, internal and external troubles at the Meteorological Office, financial concerns as well as failing health, and his struggle with depression took their toll. On 30 April 1865, Vice-Admiral FitzRoy died by suicide by cutting his throat with a razor. This took place at Lyndhurst, Westow Hill, Norwood. He died after exhausting his entire fortune (some £6,000, ) on public expenditure.

When this came to light, in order to prevent Fitzroy&#x27;s widow and daughter living in destitution, his friend and colleague Bartholomew Sulivan began an Admiral FitzRoy Testimonial Fund, which succeeded in getting the government to pay £3,000 of this sum (Charles Darwin contributed £100). Queen Victoria gave the special favour of allowing his widow and daughter the use of grace and favour apartments at Hampton Court Palace.

FitzRoy is buried in the front churchyard of All Saints&#x27; Church in Upper Norwood, south London where his footstone reads
&lt;poem&gt;
&quot;The wind goeth toward the south,
and turneth about unto the north;
it whirleth about continually,
and the wind returneth again
according to his circuits&quot;
 Ecclesiastes 1.6.&lt;/poem&gt;

His memorial was restored by the Meteorological Office in 1981 with the same inscription.

FitzRoy&#x27;s publications arising from the &quot;Beagle&quot; expeditions were influential on Chilean exploration and settlement of Patagonia. His recommendation on establishing a British base on the Straits of Magellan to aid the travel between the British Isles and Australia contributed to the Chilean decision to occupy the straits in the 1840s. FitzRoy&#x27;s book &quot;Sailing Directions for South America&quot; led Chilean Navy hydrographer Francisco Hudson to investigate in the 1850s the possible existence of a sailing route through internal waters from the Chiloé Archipelago to the Straits of Magellan. Enrique Simpson found instead FitzRoy&#x27;s mapping of little use, noting in 1870 that &quot;Fitzroy&#x27;s chart, that is quite exact until that point [Melinka 43° 53&#x27; S], is worthless further ahead...&quot;. Thus south of Melinka, Simpson relied more in the late 18th-century sketches of José de Moraleda y Montero. Simpson&#x27;s contemporary Francisco Vidal Gormaz was critical of the overall work of FitzRoy and Darwin, stating that they had failed to acknowledge the importance of the Patagonian islands.

==Personal life==
Robert FitzRoy married twice. He married Mary Henrietta O&#x27;Brien, daughter of Major General Edward James O&#x27;Brien and Rachel Charlotte Frobisher, in 1836. They had four children: Emily-Unah, Fanny, Katherine and Robert O&#x27;Brien. After the death of his first wife, he married Maria Isabella Smyth, daughter of John Henry Smyth of Heath Hall, Heath, West Yorkshire (son of the politician John Smyth), in London in 1854. Smyth had married his first cousin, Lady Elizabeth Anne FitzRoy—both being grandchildren of the 3rd Duke of Grafton, as was Robert FitzRoy. Lady Elizabeth was daughter of the 4th Duke of Grafton and was a first cousin of Robert FitzRoy. Maria Isabella was therefore Robert&#x27;s first cousin once removed. They had one daughter, Laura Maria Elizabeth (1858–1943).

==Memorials==
A neighbourhood in the city of Punta Arenas Chile, was named in his honour in 1964.

A memorial to FitzRoy is erected atop a metamorphic outcrop beside the Bahia Wulaia dome middens on Isla Navarino, in the Chilean part of Tierra del Fuego archipelago, South America. It was presented in his bicentenary (2005) and commemorates his 23 January 1833 landing on Wulaia Cove. Another memorial, presented also in FitzRoy&#x27;s bicentenary, commemorates his Cape Horn landing on 19 April 1830.


Mount Fitz Roy at the Argentina–Chile border was named after him by the Argentine scientist and explorer Francisco Moreno. It is high. The aboriginals had not named it, and used the word &quot;chaltén&quot; (meaning smoking mountain) for this and other peaks.

Fitzroy River, in northern Western Australia, was named after him by Lieutenant John Lort Stokes who, at the time, commanded HMS &quot;Beagle&quot; (previously commanded by FitzRoy).

The South American conifer &quot;Fitzroya cupressoides&quot; is named after him, as well as the &quot;Delphinus fitzroyi&quot;, a species of dolphin discovered by Darwin during his voyage aboard the &quot;Beagle&quot;.

Fitzroy, Falkland Islands and Port Fitzroy, New Zealand are also named after him.

The World War II Captain class frigate was named after him, as was the weather ship &quot;Admiral Fitzroy&quot; (formerly ).

In 2010 New Zealand&#x27;s National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA) named its new IBM supercomputer &quot;FitzRoy&quot; in honour of him.

On 4 February 2002, when the shipping forecast sea area Finisterre was renamed to avoid confusion with the (smaller) French and Spanish forecast area of the same name, the new name chosen by the UK&#x27;s Meteorological Office was &quot;FitzRoy&quot;, in honour of their founder.

FitzRoy has been commemorated by the Fitzroy Building at the University of Plymouth, used by the School of Earth, Ocean and Environmental Science.

There is blue plaque on FitzRoy&#x27;s house at 38 Onslow Square, London.

Vice-Admiral Robert FitzRoy was commemorated on two stamps issued by the Royal Mail for the Falkland Islands and St Helena.

Fitzroy River and Fitzroy Crossing in Western Australia are named after FitzRoy. Fitzroy Island in Queensland, Australia, is named after FitzRoy&#x27;s paternal grandfather, Augustus Henry Fitzroy.

==In fiction==
The BBC made a BAFTA award-winning television series in 1978 titled &quot;The Voyage of Charles Darwin&quot; where Captain Robert Fitzroy was played by actor Andrew Burt with Malcolm Stoddard as Darwin with a storyline that followed the historic interaction between Darwin and FitzRoy before and after their time together on HMS &quot;Beagle&quot;.
In 1997, the play &quot;FitzRoy&quot; by Juliet Aykroyd was first performed at the University of Reading. It has since been performed under the title &quot;The Ostrich and the Dolphin&quot; – alluding to Darwin&#x27;s rhea and the dusky dolphin, named &quot;Delphinus fitzroyi&quot; by Darwin – before being published as &quot;Darwin &amp; FitzRoy&quot; in October 2013.

A novel by Argentinian writer, Sylvia Iparraguirre, entitled &quot;Tierra del Fuego&quot;, was published in 2000. It retells the story of Fitzroy&#x27;s experiment with &quot;civilizing&quot; the Yamaná from the perspective of a fictional narrator, British-Argentinian Jack Guevarra. The novel received the Sor Juana de la Cruz prize and was translated into English by Hardie St. Martin.

A novel entitled &quot;This Thing of Darkness&quot; by Harry Thompson was published in 2005 (it was published in the U.S. in 2006 under the title &quot;To the Edge of the World&quot;). The novel&#x27;s plot followed the lives of FitzRoy, Darwin and others connected with the &quot;Beagle&quot; expeditions, following them between the years of 1828 and 1865. It was a nominee on the long list for the 2005 Man Booker Prize (although Thompson died in November 2005).

The novel &quot;Darwin&#x27;s Dreams&quot; by Sean Hoade was published in 2008 and republished in a new edition in 2016. The novel begins with the first meeting of Darwin and FitzRoy and ends with Darwin receiving notice of FitzRoy&#x27;s suicide. The plot is interlaced with fictional &quot;dreams&quot; that imagine how the world would be if the ideas of evolutionary thinkers over the millennia had been literally true. The dreams also show how Darwin&#x27;s subconscious dealt with major themes in his life such as the death of his beloved daughter Annie and his lifelong friendship and rivalry with FitzRoy.

The play &quot;Darwins Kapten&quot; was published by Henning Mankell in 2009, and had its world premiere in 2010 at the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm. It is about Darwin and his journey on the &quot;Beagle&quot;: many years after the five-year long voyage, Darwin receives a message that his captain on the ship, FitzRoy, has died by suicide. The play portrays the reception of Darwin&#x27;s discoveries, as well as the consequences of taking a stand against existing ideas in a world that is built on belief in God as the only creator of life.

<doc id="271126" wikidata="Q1209571" url="?curid=271126" title="President of the Philippines">
<text>The president of the Philippines (, sometimes referred to as ) is the head of state, head of government and chief executive of the Philippines. The president leads the executive branch of the Philippine government and is the commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of the Philippines.

The president is directly elected by the citizens of the Philippines and is one of only two nationally elected executive officials, the other being the vice president of the Philippines. However, four vice presidents have assumed the presidency without having been elected to the office, by virtue of a president&#x27;s intra-term death or resignation.

Filipinos generally refer to their president as &quot;pangulo&quot; or &quot;presidente&quot; in their local language. The president is limited to a single six-year term. No one who has served more than four years of a presidential term is allowed to run or serve again.

The current president of the Philippines is Bongbong Marcos, who was sworn in on June 30, 2022, at the National Museum of Fine Arts (formerly the Legislative Building).

== Title ==
The official title of the Philippine head of state and government is &quot;President of the Philippines.&quot; The title in Filipino is &quot;Pangulo&quot; (cognate of Malay &quot;penghulu&quot; &quot;leader&quot;, &quot;chieftain&quot;). In the other major languages of the Philippines such as the Bisayan languages, &quot;presidente&quot; is more common when Filipinos are not actually code-switching with the English word. The honorific for the president is &quot;Your Excellency&quot; or &quot;His/Her Excellency.&quot; During his tenure, President Rodrigo Duterte broke precedent by not using the honorific, opting to drop the title in all official communications, events or materials.

===Historical titles===
The term &quot;President of the Republic of the Philippines&quot; used under Japanese occupation of the Philippines distinguished the government of then-president José P. Laurel from the Commonwealth government-in-exile under President Manuel L. Quezon. The restoration of the Commonwealth in 1945 and the subsequent independence of the Philippines restored the title of &quot;President of the Philippines&quot; enacted in the 1935 constitution. The 1973 constitution, though generally referring to the president as &quot;President of the Philippines&quot;, Article XVII, Section 12 once used the term, &quot;President of the Republic.&quot; In the text of Proclamation No. 1081 that placed the country under martial law in September 1972, President Ferdinand Marcos consistently referred to himself as &quot;President of the Philippines.&quot;

== History ==
===Early republics===

====Bonifacio&#x27;s Tagalog Republic====
Depending on the definition chosen for these terms, a number of persons could alternatively be considered the inaugural holder of the office. Andrés Bonifacio could be considered the president of the tagalog provinces, while he was the third Supreme President (Spanish: &quot;Presidente Supremo&quot;; Filipino: &quot;Kataas-taasang Pangulo&quot;) of the &quot;Katipunan&quot;, a secret revolutionary society that started an open revolt against the Spanish colonial government in August 1896, he transformed the society into a revolutionary government with himself as &quot;President of the Sovereign Nation/People&quot; (Filipino: &quot;Pangulo ng Haring Bayan&quot;). While the term &quot;Katipunan&quot; (and the title &quot;Supreme President&quot;) remained, Bonifacio&#x27;s government was also known as the Tagalog Republic (Spanish: &quot;República Tagala&quot;; Filipino: &quot;Republika ng Katagalugan&quot;), and the term &quot;haring bayan&quot; or &quot;haringbayan&quot; as an adaptation and synonym of &quot;republic&quot;, from its Latin roots as &quot;res publica&quot;. Since &quot;Presidente Supremo&quot; was shortened to &quot;Supremo&quot; in contemporary historical accounts of other people, he thus became known by that title alone in traditional Philippine historiography, which by itself was thus understood to mean &quot;Supreme Leader&quot; in contrast to the later &quot;Presidents&quot;. However, as noted by Filipino historian Xiao Chua, Bonifacio did not refer himself as &quot;Supremo&quot; but rather as &quot;Kataas-taasang Pangulo&quot; (Supreme President), &quot;Pangulo ng Kataas-taasang Kapulungan&quot; (President of the Supreme Assembly), or &quot;Pangulo ng Haring Bayan&quot; (President of the Sovereign Nation/People), as evidenced by his own writings.

Although the word &quot;Tagalog&quot; refers to the Tagalog people, a specific ethno-linguistic group mostly in southern Luzon, Bonifacio used the term &quot;Tagalog&quot; in &quot;Tagalog Republic&quot; to denote all non-Spanish peoples of the Philippines in place of &quot;Filipinos&quot;, which had colonial origins, referring to his concept of the Philippine nation and people as the &quot;Sovereign Tagalog Nation/People&quot; or more precisely &quot;Sovereign Nation of the Tagalog People&quot; (Filipino: &quot;Haring Bayang Katagalugan&quot;), in effect a synonym of &quot;Tagalog Republic&quot; or more precisely &quot;Republic of the Tagalog Nation/People&quot;.

According to Filipino historian Ambeth Ocampo, including Bonifacio as a past president would imply that Macario Sakay and Miguel Malvar should also be included, as Sakay continued Bonifacio&#x27;s concept of a national Tagalog Republic, and Malvar continued the Philippine Republic which was the culmination of several governments headed by Emilio Aguinaldo that superseded Bonifacio&#x27;s, Malvar taking over after Aguinaldo&#x27;s capture. Nevertheless, there are still calls, including from a descendant of Bonifacio, to let Bonifacio be recognized by the current government as the first Philippine president. In 1993, historians Milagros Guerrero, Emmanuel Encarnacion and Ramon Villegas petitioned before the National Historical Institute (now the National Historical Commission of the Philippines) to recognize Bonifacio as the first Philippine president but the institute turned down the petition and reasoned that Bonifacio was not even the Katipunan&#x27;s first &quot;Supremo&quot;, but rather Deodato Arellano.

In 2013, the Manila City Council passed a resolution persuading the national government to declare Bonifacio as the first president of the Tagalog Republic, attributing to all natives of the archipelago of the Philippines. A separate resolution was also signed in 2013 by the Philippine Historian Association urging then Philippine President Benigno Aquino III to recognize Bonifacio as the first Philippine president. In the same year, representatives of the Philippine House of Representatives passed a house resolution that sought to acknowledge Bonifacio as the first president. A similar house resolution was also filed in 2016.

According to Marlon Cadiz of the NHCP, the agency is waiting for a thorough and clear study containing new evidence as well as explanations of experts regarding Bonifacio&#x27;s status as the first president.

==== Aguinaldo&#x27;s governments and the First Republic ====
In March 1897, during the Philippine Revolution against Spain, Emilio Aguinaldo was elected president of a new revolutionary government at the Tejeros Convention in Tejeros, Cavite. The new government was meant to replace the &quot;Katipunan&quot;. It variously called itself the &quot;Philippine Republic&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Republica Filipina&quot;), &quot;Republic of the Philippines&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Republica de Filipinas&quot;) and &quot;Government of All Tagalogs&quot; or &quot;Government of the Whole Tagalog Nation/People&quot; (Filipino: &quot;Pamahalaan ng Sangkatagalugan&quot;).

Months later, Aguinaldo was again elected president at Biak-na-Bato, Bulacan in November, leading a reorganized &quot;Republic of the Philippines&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Republica de Filipinas&quot;), commonly known today as the Republic of Biak-na-Bato. Aguinaldo therefore signed the Pact of Biak-na-Bato and went into exile in Hong Kong at the end of 1897.

In April 1898, the Spanish–American War broke out, and afterwards, the Asiatic Squadron of the United States Navy sailed for the Philippines. At the Battle of Manila Bay on May 1, 1898, the American Navy decisively defeated the Spanish Navy. Aguinaldo subsequently returned to the Philippines aboard a U.S. Navy vessel and renewed the revolution. He formed a dictatorial government on May 24, 1898, and issued the Philippine Declaration of Independence on June 12, 1898. During this brief period he took the title &quot;Dictator&quot; and the Declaration of Independence refers to him as such.

On June 23, 1898, Aguinaldo transformed his dictatorial government into a revolutionary government and became known as &quot;President&quot; again. On January 23, 1899, Aguinaldo was then elected president of the &quot;Philippine Republic&quot; (Spanish: &quot;Republica Filipina&quot;), a new government constituted by a revolutionary congress under a likewise revolutionary constitution. Consequently, this government is today officially considered to be the proper &quot;first republic&quot; and is also called the Malolos Republic, after its capital Malolos in Bulacan; its congress (formally &quot;National Assembly&quot;) and constitution are commonly known as the Malolos Congress and Malolos Constitution as well.

Like all of its predecessors and would-be successors until the 1935 Commonwealth of the Philippines, the First Philippine Republic was short-lived and never internationally recognized, and never controlled or was universally recognized by the entire area covered by the current republic, though it (and they) claimed to represent and govern the entire Philippine archipelago and all its people. The Philippines was transferred from Spanish to American control by the Treaty of Paris of 1898, signed in December of that year. The Philippine–American War broke out between the United States and Aguinaldo&#x27;s government. His government effectively ceased to exist on April 1, 1901, after he pledged allegiance to the United States following his capture by U.S. forces in March.

The current government of the Republic of the Philippines considers Emilio Aguinaldo to be the first president of the Philippines-based specifically on his presidency of the Malolos Republic, not any of his various prior governments.

==== Other claimants ====
Miguel Malvar continued Aguinaldo&#x27;s leadership of the Philippine Republic after the latter&#x27;s capture until his own capture in 1902, while Macario Sakay revived the Tagalog Republic in 1902 as a continuing state of Bonifacio&#x27;s Katipunan. They are both considered by some scholars as &quot;unofficial presidents&quot;, and along with Bonifacio, are not recognized as presidents by the government.

=== American occupation ===
Between 1898 and 1935, executive power in the Philippines was exercised by a succession of four American military governors-general and eleven civil governors-general.
=== Philippine Commonwealth ===
In October 1935, Manuel L. Quezon was elected the first president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, which had been established, still under United States sovereignty, under a constitution ratified on May 14 of that year. During its first five years, the president could serve for a six-year term that cannot be renewed. It was later amended in 1940 to limit a president to serving no more than two four-year terms. When the administration of President Quezon exiled to the United States after the Philippines fell to the Empire of Japan in World War II, Quezon appointed Chief Justice José Abad Santos as his delegate, which in effect the acting president of the commonwealth according to Justice George A. Malcolm. Abad Santos was subsequently executed by the Imperial Japanese Army on May 2, 1942.

=== The Second Republic under the Japanese ===
On October 14, 1943, José P. Laurel became president under a constitution imposed by the Japanese occupation. Laurel, an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines, had been instructed to remain in Manila by President Quezon, who withdrew to Corregidor and then to the United States to establish a government in exile in the United States. On August 17, 1945, two days after the Japanese surrendered to the Allies, Laurel officially dissolved the republic.

=== After World War II ===
The 1935 Constitution was restored after the Japanese surrender ended World War II, with Vice President Sergio Osmeña becoming president due to Quezon&#x27;s death on August 1, 1944. It remained in effect after the United States recognized the sovereignty of the Republic of the Philippines as a separate self-governing nation on July 4, 1946. On the same day, Manuel A. Roxas, the last president of the Commonwealth of the Philippines, became the first president of the independent Republic of the Philippines, also known as the Third Republic of the Philippines.

=== 1973 and 1987 Constitutions ===
A new Constitution ratified on January 17, 1973, under the rule of Ferdinand Marcos introduced a parliamentary-style government. Marcos instituted himself as prime minister while serving as president in 1978. Marcos later appointed César Virata as prime minister in 1981, although, he was only a figurehead as the government control was still with Marcos.

The 1973 Constitution was in effect until the People Power Revolution of 1986 toppled Marcos&#x27;s 21-year authoritarian regime and replaced him with Corazon C. Aquino. On March 25, 1986, Aquino issued Proclamation No. 3, s. 1986 or the &quot;freedom constitution&quot; that initially replaced the 1973 Constitution. This provisional constitution was done as Aquino was installed as president through revolutionary means. Proclamation No. 3 abrogated many of the provisions of the then 1973 Constitution, including the provisions associated with the Marcos regime, which gave the president legislative powers, as well as the unicameral legislature called the Batasang Pambansa (literally &quot;National Legislature&quot; in Filipino). The proclamation retained only parts of the 1973 Constitution that were essential for a return to democratic rule, such as the bill of rights. This constitution was superseded on February 2, 1987, by the present constitution.

=== Other issues ===

Both Bonifacio and Aguinaldo might be considered to have been an inaugural president of an insurgent government. Quezon was the inaugural president of a predecessor state to the current one, while Roxas was the first president of an independent Philippines.

The government considers Aguinaldo to have been the first president of the Philippines, followed by Quezon and his successors. Despite the differences in constitutions and government, the line of presidents is considered to be continuous. For instance, Rodrigo Duterte, is considered to be the 16th president.

While the government may consider Aguinaldo as the first president, the First Republic fell under the United States&#x27; jurisdiction due to the 1898 Treaty of Paris which ended the Spanish–American War; the United States thus does not consider his tenure to have been legitimate. Manuel L. Quezon is considered to be the first president by the United States when they gave the Philippines independence through the Tydings–McDuffie Act. He is also the first to win a popular election and a nationwide election.

During the Second World War, the Philippines had two presidents heading two governments. One was Quezon and the Commonwealth government-in-exile in Washington, D.C., and the other was Manila-based Laurel heading the Japanese-sponsored Second Republic. Notably, Laurel was himself instructed to remain in Manila by President Quezon. Laurel and Aguinaldo were not formally recognized as Philippine presidents until Diosdado Macapagal&#x27;s administration. Their inclusion in the official list coincided with the transfer of the official date of Independence Day from July 4 (the anniversary of the Philippines&#x27; independence from the United States) to June 12 (the anniversary of the 1898 Declaration of Independence).

==Powers and roles==

===Executive power===
The president of the Philippines, being the chief executive, serves as both the head of state and head of government of the Philippines. The constitution vests the executive power with the president who consequently heads the government&#x27;s executive branch, including the Cabinet and all executive departments. There are also government agencies that report to no specific department but are instead under the Office of the President. The president also exercises general supervision over local government units.

The president has the power to give executive issuances, which are means to streamline the policy and programs of an administration. There are six issuances that the President may issue, as defined in the Administrative Code of 1987: executive orders, administrative orders, proclamations, memorandum orders, memorandum circulars, and general or special orders.

The president has power to grant reprieves, commutations and pardons, and remit fines and forfeitures after conviction by final judgment, except in cases of impeachment. The president can grant amnesty with the concurrence of the majority of all the members of the Congress. The president has authority to contract or guarantee foreign loans on behalf of the country but only with the prior concurrence of the Monetary Board and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law.

The president has the authority to exercise the power of eminent domain. The president also has the power to direct escheat or reversion proceedings and the power to reserve lands of the public and private domain of the government. However, there are two constitutional provisions that limit the exercise of such power: Article 3, Section 9 of the Constitution provides that no person shall be deprived of his/her life, liberty, or property without due process of law and that private property shall not be taken for public use without just compensation.

With the consent of the Commission on Appointments, the president also appoints the heads of the executive departments, board of members and its leaders from any national government-related institutions, ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls, high-ranking officers of the armed forces, and other officials. The members of the Supreme Court and lower courts are also appointed by the president, but only from the list of nominees prepared by the Judicial and Bar Council. Such appointments do not need the approval of the Commission on Appointments.

=== Legislative power ===
As per Article 6, Section 1 of the Constitution, the power of lawmaking is vested in the bicameral Congress, which consists of the Senate and the House of Representatives. However, the president has some legislative power. The president has the power to veto any bill passed by Congress. Article 6, Section 27 requires that every legislation passed by Congress shall be presented to the president, after which the president can either sign the bill into law within thirty days, veto the bill, or take no action within the timeframe, in which the bill will pass as if it had been signed. While Congress can override a presidential veto, it requires a two-thirds vote of both houses. The president can also veto any particular item or items in an appropriation, revenue, or tariff bill, but the veto shall not affect the item or items to which he does not object. By exerting their influence on Congress, the president can shape legislation and be involved in the legislative process. The State of the Nation Address also gives the president an opportunity to outline their priority legislative agenda.

== Election process ==

=== Eligibility ===
Article 7, Section 2 of the Constitution sets the following qualifications for holding the presidency:

* be a natural-born citizen of the Philippines
* be a registered voter
* be able to read and write
* at least forty years of age on the day of the election
* a resident of the Philippines for at least ten years immediately preceding such election.

Natural-born Filipinos are citizens of the Philippines from birth without having to perform any act to acquire or perfect their Philippine citizenship. Those whose fathers or mothers are citizens of the Philippines at the time of their birth and those born before January 17, 1973, of Filipino mothers, who elect Philippine citizenship upon reaching the age of majority are considered natural-born Filipinos.

The Constitution also provides term limits where the president is ineligible for reelection and a person who has succeeded as president and has served as such for more than four years will be ineligible to be elected for a second term. However, with the case of Joseph Estrada who was elected president in 1998, deposed in 2001, and again ran for the presidency in 2010, the Constitution&#x27;s wording where &quot;[the] President shall not be eligible for any re-election&quot; remains unclear as his case was never brought to the Supreme Court. It remains unclear whether the term limit of no re-election applies only to the incumbent president or for any person who has been elected as president.

=== Election ===

The president is elected by direct vote every six years, usually on the second Monday of May. The latest election was held in 2022.

The returns of every election for president and vice president, duly certified by the board of canvassers of each province or city, shall be transmitted to Congress, directed to the president of the Senate. Upon receipt of the certificates of canvass, the president of the Senate shall open all the certificates in the presence of a joint public session of Congress not later than 30 days after election day. Congress then canvasses the votes upon determining that the polls are authentic and were done in the manner provided by law.

The person with the highest number of votes is declared the winner, but in case two or more have the highest number of votes, the president is elected by a majority of all members of Congress, with the Senate and the House of Representatives voting separately.

===Inauguration===

The president of the Philippines usually takes the oath of office at noon of June 30 following the presidential election. Traditionally, the vice president takes the oath first, a little before noon for two reasons. First, according to protocol, no one follows the president (who is last due to his supremacy), and second, to establish a constitutionally valid successor before the president-elect accedes. During Quezon&#x27;s inauguration, however, the vice president and legislature were sworn in after the president, to symbolize a new start.

Custom has enshrined three places as the traditional venue for the inauguration ceremony: Barasoain Church in Malolos City, Bulacan; in front of the old Legislative Building (now part of the National Museum) in Manila; or at Quirino Grandstand, where most have been held. Some presidential have broken precedent, either due to extraordinary circumstances or In 2004, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo delivered her pre-inaugural address at Quirino Grandstand, took the oath of office in Cebu City before Chief Justice Hilario Davide Jr., and the next day held the first cabinet meeting in Butuan. She broke with precedent, reasoning that she wanted to celebrate her inauguration in each of the three main island groups of the Philippines: Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao. Her first inauguration also broke precedent as she was sworn in at the EDSA Shrine on January 20, 2001, during the EDSA Revolution of 2001 that removed Joseph Estrada from office.

The dress code at the modern inaugural ceremony is traditional, formal Filipino clothing, which is otherwise loosely termed &quot;Filipiniana&quot;. Ladies must wear &quot;baro&#x27;t saya&quot; (the formal wear of other indigenous groups is permissible), while men don the &quot;barong tagalog&quot;. Non-Filipinos at the ceremony may wear their respective versions of formal dress, but foreign diplomats have often been seen donning &quot;Filipiniana&quot; as a mark of cultural respect.

The Constitution provides the following oath or affirmation for the president and vice president-elect which must be taken before they enter into office:

The Filipino text of the oath used for the inaugurations of Fidel V. Ramos, Joseph Estrada, Benigno Aquino III, and Bongbong Marcos reads:

As soon as the president takes the oath of office, a 21-gun salute is fired to salute the new head of state, and the presidential anthem &quot;We Say Mabuhay&quot; is played. The president delivers his inaugural address, and then proceeds to Malacañang Palace to climb the Grand Staircase, a ritual which symbolizes the formal possession of the palace. The president then inducts the newly formed cabinet into office in one of the state rooms.

== Incumbency ==

=== State of the Nation Address === 


The State of the Nation Address (SONA) is an annual event, in which the president reports on the status of the nation, normally to the resumption of a joint session of the House of Representatives and the Senate. This is a duty of the president as stated in Article VII, Section 23 of the 1987 Constitution.

=== Tenure and term limits ===
The 1935 Constitution originally set the president&#x27;s term at six years, without re-election. In 1940, however, the 1935 Constitution was amended and the term of the president (and vice president) was shortened to four years, with a two-term limit. Under the provisions of the amended 1935 document, only presidents Manuel L. Quezon (1941) and Ferdinand E. Marcos (1969) were re-elected. Presidents Sergio Osmeña (1946), Elpidio Quirino (1953), Carlos P. Garcia (1961) and Diosdado Macapagal (1965) all failed in seeking a new term. Marcos was the only president to serve three terms (1965–1969, 1969–1981, 1981–1986).

On August 24, 1970, Congress enacted RA No. 6132, otherwise known as the Constitutional Convention Act, for the purpose of convening a Constitutional Convention. The 320 delegates met from June 1971 until November 30, 1972, when they approved the draft of the new Charter. While in the process of drafting a new Constitution, President Ferdinand Marcos declared Martial Law on September 21, 1972. The draft Constitution was submitted to the Citizen&#x27;s Assemblies from January 10 to 17, 1973 for ratification. On January 17, 1973, President Marcos issued Proclamation No. 1102, announcing the ratification of the Constitution of the Republic of the Philippines. In 1981, President Marcos secured a third term, defeating Alejo Santos in an election.

The 1987 Constitution restored the 1935 Constitution&#x27;s original ban on presidential reelection. Under Article 7, Section 4 of the current constitution, the term of the president shall begin at noon on the thirtieth day of June next following the day of the election and shall end at noon of the same date, six years thereafter. The incumbent president is not eligible for re-election, even if non-consecutive. Moreover, no president who serves more than four years of a presidential term is allowed to run or serve again.

=== Vacancies and succession ===
==== At the start of the term ====
Under Article 7, Section 7 of the Constitution, In case the president-elect fails to qualify, the vice president-elect shall act as president until the president-elect shall have qualified. If at the beginning of the term of the president, the president-elect shall have died or shall have become permanently disabled, the vice president-elect shall become president. Where no president and vice president shall have been chosen or shall have qualified, or where both shall have died or become permanently disabled, the president of the Senate or, in case of his inability, the speaker of the House of Representatives, shall act as president until a president or a vice president shall have been chosen and qualified.

==== During the term ====
The line of presidential succession as specified by Article 7, Section 8 of the Constitution are the vice president, Senate president and the speaker of the House of Representatives. Contrary to popular belief, the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of the Philippines is not in the line of succession. If the offices of both the president and vice president are vacant at the same time, Congress shall within a specific period enact a law calling for a special election. However, if the presidential election is 18 months away, no special election shall be called. An acting president may temporarily assume the duties of president.

The current presidential line of succession is:
=== Impeachment ===
Impeachment in the Philippines follows procedures similar to the United States. The House of Representatives, one of the houses of the bicameral Congress, has the exclusive power to initiate all cases of impeachment against the president, vice president, members of the Supreme Court, members of the constitutional commissions and the ombudsman. When a third of its membership has endorsed the impeachment articles, it is then transmitted to the Senate of the Philippines which tries and decide, as impeachment tribunal, the impeachment case. A main difference from U.S. proceedings however is that only a third of House members are required to approve the motion to impeach the president (as opposed to the majority required in the United States). In the Senate, selected members of the House of Representatives act as the prosecutors and the senators act as judges with the Senate president and chief justice of the Supreme Court jointly presiding over the proceedings. Like the United States, to convict the official in question requires that a minimum of two-thirds (i.e., 16 of 24 members) of the senate vote in favor of conviction. If an impeachment attempt is unsuccessful or the official is acquitted, no new cases can be filed against that impeachable official for at least one full year.

The Constitution enumerates the culpable violation of the Constitution, treason, bribery, graft and corruption, other high crimes, and betrayal of public trust as grounds for the impeachment of the president. The same also applies for the vice president, the members of the Supreme Court, the members of the constitutional commissions, and the ombudsman.

=== Official residence ===
Malacañang Palace is the official residence of the president of the Philippines, a privilege entitled to him/her under Article VII, Section 6 of the Constitution. The palace is located along the north bank of the Pasig River, along J.P. Laurel Street in the district of San Miguel, Manila. The Filipino name is derived from the Tagalog phrase &quot;may lakán diyán&quot; (&quot;there is a nobleman there&quot;), and this was eventually shortened to &quot;Malakanyáng&quot;. The complex includes several mansions and office buildings built and designed in the bahay na bato and neoclassical architectural styles.

Before Malacañang Palace was designated as the official residence of the president, various establishments served as residence of the chief executive in the Philippines. The Spanish governor-general, the highest-ranking official in the Philippines during the Spanish Era, resided in the Palacio del Gobernador inside the walled city of Intramuros. However, after an earthquake in 1863, the Palacio del Gobernador was destroyed, and the residence and office of the governor-general was transferred to Malacañang Palace. During the Philippine Revolution, President Aguinaldo resided in his own home in Kawit, Cavite. After his defeat in the Philippine–American War, Aguinaldo transferred the capital of the Philippines several times as he struggled against invading American Forces. When the Americans occupied the Philippines, they also used the palace as an official residence for their governors-general. During the Japanese occupation of the Philippines, the presidential seat and government offices were transferred to the more inland Baguio, where the Mansion House was used as the official residence. Meanwhile, President Manuel L. Quezon of the Philippine Commonwealth government-in-exile resided in the Omni Shoreham Hotel in Washington D.C. After the restoration of independence in 1946, plans were made for the construction of the new presidential residence to replace Malacañang in a new capital city. However, the plans did not push through and the president&#x27;s official residence is still Malacañang Palace in Manila.

A secondary residence within the wider palace grounds is &quot;Bahay Pangulo&quot; (), formerly known as &quot;Bahay Pangarap&quot; () and &quot;Bahay ng Pagbabago&quot; (), a smaller structure located on the south bank of the Pasig River across the main palace in Malacañang Park, which is itself part of the Presidential Security Group Complex. President Benigno Aquino III was the first to use &quot;Bahay Pangarap&quot; as his official residence. It was originally built in the 1930s under President Quezon as a rest house and venue for informal activities and social functions of the First Family. The house was designed by architect Juan Arellano in the 1930s, and underwent several renovations in the early 1960s, 2008, and 2010.

The president also has several other official residences nationwide for official use. The Mansion in Baguio is the official summer palace of the president. The palace was originally built in 1908 to serve as the summer residence for American Governors-General, and later became the holiday home and working office for presidents when the government would temporarily visit Baguio. Malacañang of the South in Davao City is the president&#x27;s residence in Mindanao. It was built in 2005 on state property and serves as an official residence and base of operations for presidents when visiting Davao and the surrounding provinces. Malacañang sa Sugbo in Cebu City was the former official residence in the Visayas. Originally the local office of the Bureau of Customs (BOC), it was converted to a palace in 2004. It was later returned to the BOC. Malacañang of the North was also an official residence of the president in the Ilocos Region. The residence is currently a presidential museum.

===Travel===
==== Air transportation ====
The 250th (Presidential) Airlift Wing of the Philippine Air Force has the mandate of providing safe and efficient air transport for the president of the Philippines and the First Family. On occasion, the wing has also been tasked to provide transportation for other members of government, visiting heads of state, and other state guests.

The majority of the fleet is fairly dated with a few exceptions it includes: 1 Fokker F28, which is primarily used for the president&#x27;s domestic trips and it is also called &quot;Kalayaan One&quot; when the president is on board, 4 Bell 412 helicopters, 3 Sikorsky S-76 helicopters, 1 Sikorsky S-70-5 Black Hawk, a number of Bell UH-1N Twin Hueys, as well as Fokker F-27 &quot;Friendship&quot;s. In September 2020, a new Gulfstream G280 was delivered which will be used for VIP transport as well as for C2 (Command and Control) missions. For trips outside of the Philippines, the Air Force employs a Bombardier Global Express, Gulftsream G650ER or charters appropriate aircraft from the country&#x27;s flag carrier, Philippine Airlines. Any PAL aircraft with the flight number &quot;PR/PAL 001&quot; and callsign &quot;PHILIPPINE 001&quot; is a flight operated by Philippine Airlines to transport the president of the Philippines. The president sometimes charter private jets for domestic trips within the Philippines due to some airports in the Philippines having small runways.

==== Water transportation ====
&quot;BRP Ang Pangulo&quot; (&quot;BRP&quot; stands for &quot;Barkó ng Repúblika ng Pilipinas&quot;, &quot;Ship of the Republic of the Philippines&quot;; &quot;Ang Pangulo&quot; is Filipino for &quot;the president&quot;) was commissioned by the Philippine Navy on March 7, 1959. It was built in and by Japan during the administration of President García as part of Japanese reparations to the Philippines for World War II. It is primarily used in entertaining guests of the incumbent president.

==== Land transportation ====
The president of the Philippines uses two black and heavily armored Mercedes-Benz W221 S600 Guard, whereas one is a decoy vehicle. In convoys, the president is escorted by the Presidential Security Group using primarily Toyota Fortuner SUVs with the combination of the following vehicles: Toyota FJ Cruiser, Toyota Fortuner, Toyota Land Cruiser, Toyota Hiace Toyota Camry, Philippine National Police 400cc motorcycles, Philippine National Police Mitsubishi Montero, Toyota Innova (Police car variant), other government-owned vehicles, and ambulances at the tail of the convoy; the number depends on the destination. The presidential cars are designated and registered a plate number of &quot;1&quot; or the word &quot;PANGULO&quot; (president). The limousine bears the flag of the Philippines and, occasionally, the presidential standard.

The Office of the President has also owned various cars over the decades, including a 1937 Chrysler Airflow that served as the country&#x27;s very first presidential limousine for Manuel L. Quezon. For regional trips, the president boards a Toyota Coaster or Mitsubishi Fuso Rosa or other vehicles owned by government-owned and controlled corporations or government agencies. In this case, the PSG escorts the president using local police cars with an ambulance at the tail of the convoy. Former president Benigno Aquino III, preferred to use his personal vehicle, a Toyota Land Cruiser 200 or his relative&#x27;s Lexus LX 570 over the black presidential limousines after their electronic mechanisms were damaged by floodwater. Malacañang had announced its interest to acquire a new presidential limousine. His successor, Rodrigo Duterte, utilized a white, bullet-proof armored Toyota Landcruiser as his official presidential vehicle.

===Security===

The Presidential Security Group (abbreviated PSG), is the lead agency tasked with providing security for the president, vice president, and their immediate families. They also provide protective service for visiting heads of state and diplomats.

Unlike similar groups around the world who protect other political figures, the PSG is not required to handle presidential candidates. However, former presidents and their immediate families are entitled to a small security detail from the PSG. Currently, the PSG uses Toyota Fortuner SUVs as its primary security vehicles.

== List of presidents ==

== Post-presidency ==


After leaving office, a number of presidents held various public positions and made an effort to remain in the limelight. Among other honors, except Ferdinand Marcos Sr, former presidents and their immediate families are entitled to seven soldiers as their security detail.
* José P. Laurel, who was the only president of the Second Philippine Republic, was elected to the Senate in 1951 and would serve in the upper house until 1957, making him the country&#x27;s first head of state to seek lower office following his presidency. During his tenure, the Nacionalista Party urged him to run for president in 1953. He declined, working instead for the successful election of Ramon Magsaysay, who subsequently appointed Laurel to head a diplomatic mission that was tasked with negotiating trade and other issues with United States officials, resulting in the Laurel-Langley Agreement. Laurel was also the chairperson of the Economic Mission to the United States (1954) and the founder of Lyceum of the Philippines University.
* Sergio Osmeña became a member of the Council of State under Roxas, Quirino, Magsaysay, and García. He was also a member of the National Security Council in the García administration.
* Elpidio Quirino became a councilor of state under President Magsaysay.
* Carlos P. Garcia was a delegate, later elected, president of the Constitutional Convention on June 1, 1971.
* Diosdado Macapagal was also a delegate and then succeeded Carlos P. García as president of the 1971 Constitutional Convention. He also lectured in universities and was later a Councilor of State under presidents Aquino and Ramos.
* Corazon Aquino was a member of the National Security Council under Ramos, Estrada and Arroyo. She was also a member of the Council of State under President Arroyo.
* Fidel Ramos founded the Ramos Peace and Development Foundation. He was a senior advisor and member of the National Security Council under President Estrada. Ramos was a member of the Council of State and an Ambassador-at-Large under President Arroyo. He was later appointed as special envoy to China under President Duterte to open bilateral negotiations with China over the disputes in the South China Sea but later resigned on November 1 following President Duterte&#x27;s state visit to Beijing on October 16, 2016.
* Joseph Estrada returned to film in November 2009, starring in &quot;Ang Tanging Pamilya: A Marry Go Round&quot; as part of a promotional attempt to run for a second term as president in 2010 amid controversy on the legality of his intent (he was allowed to run anyway by the COMELEC since the Supreme Court never weighed in on the matter) with many questioning why such a constitutional violation was ever allowed. His release from prison in 2007 by his successor, Gloria Macapagal Arroyo, restored his political privileges and allowed him to run again. Estrada eventually became a member of the National Security Council under Arroyo, Aquino III, Duterte and Marcos Jr. Following his loss to Aquino III in 2010, he ran against Alfredo Lim for the office of Mayor of Manila in 2013, and won. Estrada was mayor from 2013 to 2019, thus making him the third head of state to run for lower office following his presidency.
* Gloria Macapagal Arroyo ran for and won a seat in the House of Representatives of the Philippines as the Representative for the 2nd District of Pampanga in the 2010 elections and in the 2022 elections, making her the second head of state after Laurel to seek lower office following her presidency. Arroyo would later serve in major positions in the House of Representatives such as Deputy Speaker within two consecutive terms (from 2016 to 2017, and another currently in 2022) and was later elected as House Speaker on July 23, 2018, making her the first woman to hold that position.
* Benigno Aquino III became a councilor of state under President Duterte.
* Rodrigo Duterte was a member of the National Security Council under Marcos Jr.

<text>Henry Wace (10 December 1836 – 9 January 1924) was an English Anglican priest and ecclesiastical historian who served as Principal of King&#x27;s College, London, from 1883 to 1897 and as Dean of Canterbury from 1903 to 1924. He is described in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; as &quot;an effective administrator, a Protestant churchman of deep scholarship, and a stout champion of the Reformation settlement&quot;.

== Early life and education ==
Wace was born in London on 10 December 1836, the eldest son of the Rev. Richard Henry Wace and his wife Eulalia Grey. He was educated at Marlborough College, Rugby School and King&#x27;s College, London. He matriculated at Brasenose College, Oxford in 1856, graduating BA (in &quot;literae humaniores&quot; and mathematics) in 1860, and M.A. in 1863. He became an Honorary Fellow in 1911.

== Career ==
He took Holy Orders and served curacies at St Luke&#x27;s, Berwick Street (1861–63), St James&#x27;s, Piccadilly (1863–69), and Grosvenor Chapel (1870–72). He moved to Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, where he served first as Chaplain (1872–80) and later as Preacher (1880–96). He was additionally Chaplain of the Inns of Court Rifle Volunteers (1880–1908) and the Warburton Lecturer for 1896.

In 1875, he became Professor of Ecclesiastical History at King&#x27;s College, London, of which he served as Principal (1883–97). He was Rector of St Michael&#x27;s, Cornhill 1896–1903 and Dean of Canterbury from 1903 until his death in 1924. He is buried in the courtyard of the great cloister of the cathedral.

== Writings ==
Wace wrote, contributed to, and edited, many publications in Christian and ecclesiastical history. His best-known work is the &quot;Dictionary of Christian Biography and Literature to the End of the Sixth Century A.D., with an Account of the Principal Sects and Heresies&quot;, written in collaboration with William Smith. He worked with Philip Schaff on the second series of the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers.

From 1902 to 1905 Wace was editor of &quot;The Churchman&quot;, an evangelical Anglican academic journal.

== Other accomplishments ==
He delivered the Boyle Lectures in 1874 and 1875 and the Bampton Lectures at the University of Oxford in 1879. He was Select Preacher at Oxford in 1880–81 and 1907 and at Cambridge in 1876, 1891, 1903, and 1910.

He was appointed Prebendary of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral in 1881 and received the honorary freedom of the City of Canterbury in 1921. In 1922, he played an important role in the foundation of the Bible Churchmen&#x27;s Missionary Society and was its Vice-President from 1923 until his death on 9 January 1924, following a road traffic accident.

<text>Tāmati Wāka Nene (1780s – 4 August 1871) was a Māori rangatira (chief) of the Ngāpuhi iwi (tribe) who fought as an ally of the British in the Flagstaff War of 1845–1846.

==Early life==
Tāmati Wāka Nene was born to chiefly rank in the Ngāpuhi &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe) of the Bay of Islands and Hokianga regions of the North Island of New Zealand. His father was Tapua, a &quot;rangatira&quot; (chief) of the &quot;hapu&quot; (subtribe) Ngāti Hao in the Hokianga. The date of his birth was around the 1780s and his elder brother was Eruera Maihi Patuone. He was related to the warrior Hongi Hika and could trace his ancestry back to Rāhiri, the founder of the Ngāpuhi.

Nene rose to be one of the war leaders of the Ngāpuhi. It is likely that one of his earliest battles was in about 1800, against the Ngare Raumati. Nene took an active part in the Musket Wars of 1818 to 1820, leading his warriors on a rampage the whole length of the North Island, killing and plundering as he went until he reached Cook Strait. It is said that he advised the warrior Te Rauparaha to acquire muskets to enhance his influence in the region.

In 1828 Nene successfully averted a war between the Māori of the Bay of Islands and the Hokianga. Then his older brother moved south to what is now the Auckland region, Hauraki, and soon after the paramount chief of the area died of wounds received in battle. Wāka Nene now became the highest ranking chief among his own people and one of the three primary chiefs of the area. At baptism, he added &quot;Tāmati Wāka&quot; (Thomas Walker) to his name.

==Support for the Treaty of Waitangi==

Early on Nene had recognised the value of trade with Pākehā and used his position as chief to protect and encourage both the traders and the Methodist missionaries. He was baptised in 1839 taking the name Thomas Walker or Tāmati Wāka. He also worked with the British Resident, James Busby to regularise the relationships between the two races. In 1835 he signed the Declaration of the Independence of New Zealand which proclaimed the sovereignty of the United Tribes.

At the negotiations leading up to the signing of the Treaty of Waitangi Ngapuhi chief Te Wharerahi disagreed with his brothers Rewa and Moka Te Kainga-mataa and spoke for peace and the acceptance of the European, and was duly supported by Nene and Patuone. Nene&#x27;s influence was significant in persuading many of the tribes to sign the Treaty.

The next few years saw a considerable loss of revenue and influence for the northern tribes. The capital of the new country was soon moved down to Auckland. Customs duties were also imposed. Then the Government began to manage the land, specifically they temporarily banned any further felling of kauri trees (&quot;Agathis australis&quot;), after an over-supply of milled kauri occurred in the Australian market.

==Commitment to Governor FitzRoy==

On 8 July 1844 the flagstaff on Maiki Hill at the north end of Kororāreka was cut down for the first time, by the Pakaraka chief Te Haratua. Heke had set out to cut down the flagstaff but was persuaded by Archdeacon William Williams not to do so.

On 24 August 1844 Governor FitzRoy arrived in the bay from Auckland upon the frigate . Governor FitzRoy summoned the Ngāpuhi chiefs to a conference at the Te Waimate mission at Waimate on 2 September and apparently defused the situation. Tāmati Wāka Nene requested the Governor to remove the troops and redress the grievances in respect of the Customs duties that were put in place in 1841, that Heke and Pōmare II viewed as damaging the maritime trade from which they benefited. Tāmati Wāka Nene and the other Ngāpuhi chiefs undertook to keep Heke in check and to protect the Europeans in Bay of Islands. Hōne Heke did not attend but sent a conciliatory letter and offered to replace the flagstaff.

On 10 January 1845 the flagstaff was cut down a second time, this time by Heke. He again cut down the flagstaff on 19 January. When Hōne Heke cut down the flag pole for the fourth time on 11 March 1845 and attacked Kororāreka, Nene was offended, feeling that his mana had been trampled on. Nene was already at war with Heke when the British troops began to arrive on the scene.

==Flagstaff War==
After the Battle of Kororāreka, Hōne Heke and Te Ruki Kawiti and their warriors travelled inland to Lake Ōmāpere near to Kaikohe some , or two days travel, from the Bay of Islands. Nene built a pā close to Lake Ōmāpere. Heke&#x27;s pā named Puketutu, was away, while it is sometimes named as &quot;Te Mawhe&quot; however the hill of that name is some distance to the north-east.

In April 1845, during the time that the colonial forces were gathering in the Bay of Islands, the warriors of Heke and Nene fought many skirmishes on the small hill named Taumata-Karamu that was between the two pās and on open country between Ōkaihau and Te Ahuahu. Heke&#x27;s force numbered about three hundred men; Kawiti joined Heke towards the end of April with another hundred and fifty warriors. Opposing Heke and Kawiti were about four hundred warriors that supported Tāmati Wāka Nene including his brother Eruera Maihi Patuone and the chiefs, Makoare Te Taonui and his brother Aperahama Taonui, Mohi Tawhai, Arama Karaka Pi and Nōpera Panakareao. F. E. Maning, Jacky Marmon and John Webster, of Opononi, Hokianga were three Pākehā Māori (a European turned native) who volunteered to fight with Nene and fought alongside the warriors from Hokianga. Webster used a rifle (a novel weapon at that time) and had made two hundred cartridges.

The colonial forces under the command of Lieutenant Colonel William Hulme, arrived at Heke&#x27;s Pā at Puketutu on 7 May 1845. Lieutenant Colonel Hulme and his second in command Major Cyprian Bridge made an inspection of Heke&#x27;s Pā and found it to be quite formidable. Lacking any better plan they decided on a frontal assault the following day. The attack was a failure and the forces retreated to the Bay of Islands. Lieutenant Colonel Hulme returned to Auckland and was replaced by Lieutenant Colonel Henry Despard, a soldier who did very little to inspire any confidence in Wāka Nene.

==Nene&#x27;s defeat of Heke on 12 June 1845 at Pukenui==
After the successful defence of Puketutu Pā on the shores of Lake Ōmāpere, Hōne Heke returned to his pā at Te Ahuahu. Te Ahuahu was a short distance from both Heke&#x27;s Pā at Puketutu and the site of the later Battle of Ōhaeawai. Some days later he went on to Kaikohe to gather food supplies. During his absence one of Tāmati Wāka Nene&#x27;s allies, the Hokianga chief, Makoare Te Taonui (the father of Aperahama Taonui), attacked and captured Te Ahuahu. This was a tremendous blow to Heke&#x27;s mana or prestige, obviously it had to be recaptured as soon as possible.

The ensuing battle was a traditional formal Māori conflict, taking place in the open with the preliminary challenges and responses. By Māori standards, the battle was considerably large. Heke mustered somewhere between 400 and 500 warriors while Tāmati Wāka Nene had about 300 men. Hōne Heke lost at least 30 warriors. Hugh Carleton (1874) provides a brief description of the battle:
Rev. Richard Davis also recorded that a
Wāka Nene remained in control of Heke&#x27;s pā. Heke was severely wounded and did not rejoin the conflict until some months later, at the closing phase of the Battle of Ruapekapeka. In a letter to Lieutenant Colonel Despard the battle was described by Wāka Nene as a &quot;most complete victory over Heke&quot;.

==Battle of Ōhaeawai==

Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors supported troops led by Lieutenant Colonel Despard in an attack on Pene Taui&#x27;s pā at Ōhaeawai. Kawiti and Pene Taui had strengthened the defences of the pā.

Nene and Despard fought side by side as allies although Despard had an almost complete incomprehension about Nene&#x27;s experience in attacking fortified pās. At Ōhaeawai, Nene offered to make a feint attack on the rear of the pā, to divert attention from the soldiers&#x27; assault, but this suggestion, like all others offered by Nene, met with a refusal. Nene described the British commander, Lieutenant Colonel Despard, as &#x27;a very stupid man&#x27;. Despard on the other hand said &quot;if I want help from savages I will ask for it&quot;. History tends to support Nene&#x27;s opinion as he had achieved a decisive win against Hōne Heke on 12 June 1845, with no help from the British.

At the Battle of Ōhaeawai after two days of bombardment without effecting a breach, Despard ordered a frontal assault. He was, with difficulty, persuaded to postpone this pending the arrival of a 32-pound naval gun which came the next day, 1 July. However an unexpected sortie from the pā resulted in the temporary occupation of the knoll on which Tāmati Wāka Nene had his camp and the capture of Nene&#x27;s colours – the Union Jack. The Union Jack was carried into the pā. There it was hoisted, upside down, and at half-mast high, below the Māori flag, which was a Kākahu (Māori cloak).

This insulting display of the Union Jack was the cause of the disaster which ensued. Infuriated by the insult to the Union Jack Colonel Despard ordered an assault upon the pā the same day. The attack was directed to the section of the pā where the angle of the palisade allowed a double flank from which the defenders of the pā could fire at the attackers; the attack was a reckless endeavour. The British persisted in their attempts to storm the unbreached palisades and five to seven minutes later 33 were dead and 66 injured, approximately one-third of the soldiers and Royal Marines.

==Battle of Ruapekapeka==

Tāmati Wāka Nene and his warriors supported troops led by Lieutenant Colonel Despard in an attack on the pā at Ruapekapeka. Kawiti&#x27;s tactics was to attempt to repeat the success of the Battle of Ōhaeawai and draw the colonial forces into an attack on heavily fortified pā. The colonial forces started a cannon bombardment of Ruapekapeka Pā on 27 December 1845. The siege continued for some two weeks with enough patrols and probes from the pā to keep everyone alert. Then, early in the morning of Sunday, 11 January 1846, Tāmati Wāka Nene&#x27;s men discovered that the pā appeared to have been abandoned; although Te Ruki Kawiti and a few of his warriors remained behind, and appeared to have been caught unaware by the British assault. The assaulting force drove Kawiti and his warriors out of the pā. Fighting took place behind the pā and most casualties occurred in this phase of the battle.

After the Battle of Ruapekapeka, Heke and Kawiti were ready for peace. They approached Wāka Nene to act as the intermediary to negotiate with Governor Grey. Nene insisted that no action should be taken against Heke and Kawiti for leading the war.

==Later life==
The Government lost a great deal of mana and influence in the North as a result of the war, much of which flowed to Nene. He and Heke were recognised as the two most influential men in the North. He was given a pension of one hundred pounds a year and had a cottage built for him in Kororareka (Russell). He continued to advise and assist the Government on matters such as the release of Pomare II in 1846 and Te Rauparaha in 1848.

When George Grey was knighted he chose Nene as one of his esquires. Then when he returned for his second term of governorship in 1860 he brought Nene a silver cup from Queen Victoria. Nene accompanied Grey to Taranaki to negotiate a truce with Wiremu Tamihana (the King maker) to end the First Taranaki War in 1861. En route to New Plymouth the ship struck a huge storm but survived which was taken as a favourable omen.

== Death ==

Tāmati Wāka Nene died on 4 August 1871, and is buried in Russell. The Governor at the time, Sir George Bowen, said that Nene did more than any other Māori to promote colonisation and to establish the Queen&#x27;s authority.

<doc id="271143" wikidata="Q580253" url="?curid=271143" title="Fresnel integral">
<text>The Fresnel integrals and are two transcendental functions named after Augustin-Jean Fresnel that are used in optics and are closely related to the error function (). They arise in the description of near-field Fresnel diffraction phenomena and are defined through the following integral representations:

formula_1

The parametric curve is the Euler spiral or clothoid, a curve whose curvature varies linearly with arclength.

The term Fresnel integral may also refer to the complex definite integral

formula_2

where is real and positive; this can be evaluated by closing a contour in the complex plane and applying Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem.

== Definition ==

The Fresnel integrals admit the following power series expansions that converge for all :
formula_3

Some widely used tables use instead of for the argument of the integrals defining and . This changes their limits at infinity from to and the arc length for the first spiral turn from to 2 (at ). These alternative functions are usually known as normalized Fresnel integrals.

== Euler spiral ==

The Euler spiral, also known as a Cornu spiral or clothoid, is the curve generated by a parametric plot of against . The Euler spiral was first studied in the mid 18th century by Leonhard Euler in the context of Euler–Bernoulli beam theory. A century later, Marie Alfred Cornu constructed the same spiral as a nomogram for diffraction computations.

From the definitions of Fresnel integrals, the infinitesimals and are thus:
formula_4

Thus the length of the spiral measured from the origin can be expressed as
formula_5

That is, the parameter is the curve length measured from the origin , and the Euler spiral has infinite length. The vector also expresses the unit tangent vector along the spiral, giving . Since is the curve length, the curvature can be expressed as
formula_6

Thus the rate of change of curvature with respect to the curve length is
formula_7

An Euler spiral has the property that its curvature at any point is proportional to the distance along the spiral, measured from the origin. This property makes it useful as a transition curve in highway and railway engineering: if a vehicle follows the spiral at unit speed, the parameter in the above derivatives also represents the time. Consequently, a vehicle following the spiral at constant speed will have a constant rate of angular acceleration.

Sections from Euler spirals are commonly incorporated into the shape of rollercoaster loops to make what are known as clothoid loops.

== Properties ==
 and are odd functions of ,

formula_8

which can be readily seen from the fact that their power series expansions have only odd-degree terms, or alternatively because they are antiderivatives of even functions that also are zero at the origin.

Asymptotics of the Fresnel integrals as are given by the formulas:

formula_9
Using the power series expansions above, the Fresnel integrals can be extended to the domain of complex numbers, where they become entire functions of the complex variable .

The Fresnel integrals can be expressed using the error function as follows: 

formula_10

or

formula_11

===Limits as approaches infinity===
The integrals defining and cannot be evaluated in the closed form in terms of elementary functions, except in special cases. The limits of these functions as goes to infinity are known:
formula_12

This can be derived with any one of several methods. One of them uses a contour integral of the function formula_13 around the boundary of the sector-shaped region in the complex plane formed by the positive -axis, the bisector of the first quadrant with , and a circular arc of radius centered at the origin.

As goes to infinity, the integral along the circular arc tends to 
formula_14
where polar coordinates were used and Jordan&#x27;s inequality was utilised for the second inequality. The integral along the real axis tends to the half Gaussian integral
formula_15

Note too that because the integrand is an entire function on the complex plane, its integral along the whole contour is zero. Overall, we must have
formula_16
where denotes the bisector of the first quadrant, as in the diagram. To evaluate the left hand side, parametrize the bisector as
formula_17
where ranges from 0 to . Note that the square of this expression is just . Therefore, substitution gives the left hand side as
formula_18

Using Euler&#x27;s formula to take real and imaginary parts of gives this as
formula_19
where we have written to emphasize that the original Gaussian integral&#x27;s value is completely real with zero imaginary part. Letting
formula_20
and then equating real and imaginary parts produces the following system of two equations in the two unknowns and :
formula_21

Solving this for and gives the desired result.
== Generalization ==
The integral
formula_22
is a confluent hypergeometric function and also an incomplete gamma function
formula_23
which reduces to Fresnel integrals if real or imaginary parts are taken:
formula_24
The leading term in the asymptotic expansion is
formula_25
and therefore
formula_26

For , the imaginary part of this equation in particular is
formula_27
with the left-hand side converging for and the right-hand side being its analytical extension to the whole plane less where lie the poles of .

The Kummer transformation of the confluent hypergeometric function is
formula_28
with
formula_29

== Numerical approximation ==

For computation to arbitrary precision, the power series is suitable for small argument. For large argument, asymptotic expansions converge faster. Continued fraction methods may also be used.

For computation to particular target precision, other approximations have been developed. Cody developed a set of efficient approximations based on rational functions that give relative errors down to . A FORTRAN implementation of the Cody approximation that includes the values of the coefficients needed for implementation in other languages was published by van Snyder. Boersma developed an approximation with error less than .

== Applications ==
The Fresnel integrals were originally used in the calculation of the electromagnetic field intensity in an environment where light bends around opaque objects. More recently, they have been used in the design of highways and railways, specifically their curvature transition zones, see track transition curve. Other applications are rollercoasters or calculating the transitions on a velodrome track to allow rapid entry to the bends and gradual exit.

<doc id="271149" wikidata="Q187324" url="?curid=271149" title="Zelda Fitzgerald">
<text>Zelda Fitzgerald (; July 24, 1900 – March 10, 1948) was an American novelist, painter, and socialite. Born in Montgomery, Alabama, to a wealthy Southern family, she became locally famous for her beauty and high spirits. In 1920, she married writer F. Scott Fitzgerald after the popular success of his debut novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;. The novel catapulted the young couple into the public eye, and she became known in the national press as the first American flapper. Because of their wild antics and incessant partying, she and her husband became regarded in the newspapers as the &quot;enfants terribles&quot; of the Jazz Age. Alleged infidelity and bitter recriminations soon undermined their marriage. After Zelda traveled abroad to Europe, her mental health deteriorated, and she had suicidal and homicidal tendencies, which required psychiatric care. Her doctors diagnosed her with schizophrenia, although later posthumous diagnoses posit bipolar disorder.

While institutionalized at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, Maryland, she authored the 1932 novel &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot;, a semi-autobiographical account of her early life in the American South during the Jim Crow era and her marriage to F. Scott Fitzgerald. Upon its publication by Scribner&#x27;s, the novel garnered mostly negative reviews and experienced poor sales. The critical and commercial failure of &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; disappointed Zelda and led her to pursue her other interests as a playwright and a painter. In the fall of 1932, she completed a stage play titled &quot;Scandalabra&quot;, but Broadway producers unanimously declined to produce it. Disheartened, Zelda next attempted to paint watercolors, but, when her husband arranged their exhibition in 1934, the critical response proved equally disappointing.

While the two lived apart, Scott died of occlusive coronary arteriosclerosis in December 1940. After her husband&#x27;s death, she attempted to write a second novel&quot;, Caesar&#x27;s Things&quot;, but her recurrent voluntary institutionalization for mental illness interrupted her writing, and she failed to complete the work. By this time, she had endured over ten years of electroshock therapy and insulin shock treatments, and she suffered from severe memory loss. In March 1948, while sedated and locked in a room on the fifth floor of Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, she died in a fire. Her body was identified by her dental records and one of her slippers. A follow-up investigation raised the possibility that the fire had been a work of arson by a disgruntled or mentally disturbed hospital employee.

A 1970 biography by Nancy Milford was a finalist for the National Book Award. After the success of Milford&#x27;s biography, scholars viewed Zelda&#x27;s artistic output in a new light. Her novel &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; became the focus of literary studies exploring different facets of the work: how her novel contrasted with Scott&#x27;s depiction of their marriage in &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot; and how 1920s consumer culture placed mental stress on modern women. Concurrently, renewed interest began in Zelda&#x27;s artwork, and her paintings were posthumously exhibited in the United States and Europe. In 1992, she was inducted into the Alabama Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

== Early life and family background ==

Zelda Sayre was born in Montgomery, Alabama, on July 24, 1900, the youngest of six children. Her parents were Episcopalians. Her mother, Minerva Buckner &quot;Minnie&quot; Machen, named her daughter after the Roma heroine in a novel, presumably Jane Howard&#x27;s &quot;Zelda: A Tale of the Massachusetts Colony&quot; (1866) or Robert Edward Francillon&#x27;s &quot;Zelda&#x27;s Fortune&quot; (1874). Zelda was a spoiled child; her mother doted upon her daughter&#x27;s every whim, but her father, Alabama politician Anthony Dickinson Sayre, was a strict and remote man whom Zelda described as a &quot;living fortress.&quot; Sayre was a state legislator in the post-Reconstruction era who authored the landmark 1893 Sayre Act, which disenfranchised black Alabamians for seventy years and ushered in the racially segregated Jim Crow period in the state. Based on later writings, there is scholarly speculation regarding whether Anthony Sayre sexually abused Zelda as a child, but there is no evidence confirming that Zelda was a victim of incest.

At the time of Zelda&#x27;s birth, her family was a prominent and influential Southern clan who had been slave-holders before the Civil War. According to biographer Nancy Milford, &quot;if there was a Confederate establishment in the Deep South, Zelda Sayre came from the heart of it&quot;. Zelda&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Willis Benson Machen, a Confederate Senator and later an U.S. Senator from Kentucky. Her father&#x27;s uncle was John Tyler Morgan, a Confederate general and the second Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Alabama. An outspoken advocate of lynching who served six terms in the United States Senate, Morgan played a key role in laying the foundation for the Jim Crow era in the American South. In addition to wielding considerable influence in national politics, Zelda&#x27;s family built the home later used by Jefferson Davis for the First White House of the Confederacy. According to biographer Sally Cline, &quot;in Zelda&#x27;s girlhood, ghosts of the late Confederacy drifted through the sleepy oak-lined streets,&quot; and Zelda claimed that she drew her strength from Montgomery&#x27;s Confederate past.

During her idle youth in Montgomery, Zelda&#x27;s affluent Southern family employed half a dozen domestic servants, many of whom were African-American. Consequently, Zelda was unaccustomed to domestic labor or responsibilities of any kind. As the privileged child of wealthy parents, she danced, took ballet lessons, and enjoyed the outdoors. In her youth, the family spent summers in Saluda, North Carolina, a village that would appear in her artwork decades later. In 1914, Zelda began attending Sidney Lanier High School. She was bright, but uninterested in her lessons. During high school, she continued her interest in ballet. She also drank gin, smoked cigarettes, and spent much of her time flirting with boys. A newspaper article about one of her dance performances quoted her as saying that she cared only about &quot;boys and swimming&quot;.

She developed an appetite for attention, actively seeking to flout convention, whether by dancing or by wearing a tight, flesh-colored bathing suit to fuel rumors that she swam nude. Her father&#x27;s reputation was something of a safety net, preventing her social ruin. Southern women of the time were expected to be delicate and docile, and Zelda&#x27;s antics shocked the local community. Along with her childhood friend and future Hollywood star Tallulah Bankhead, she became a mainstay of Montgomery gossip. Her ethos was encapsulated beneath her graduation photo at Sidney Lanier High School in Montgomery: &quot;Why should all life be work, when we all can borrow? Let&#x27;s think only of today, and not worry about tomorrow.&quot; In her final year of high school, she was voted &quot;prettiest&quot; and &quot;most attractive&quot; in her graduating class.

== Courtship by F. Scott Fitzgerald ==

In July 1918, Zelda Sayre first met aspiring novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald at the Montgomery Country Club. At the time, Fitzgerald had been freshly rejected by his first love, Chicago socialite and heiress Ginevra King, due to his lack of financial prospects. Heartbroken by this rejection, Scott had dropped out of Princeton University and volunteered for the United States Army amid World War I. While awaiting deployment to the Western front, he was stationed at Camp Sheridan, outside Montgomery. 

While writing to Ginevra King and begging her to resume their relationship, a lonely Fitzgerald began courting Montgomery women, including Zelda, who reminded him of Ginevra. Scott called Zelda daily, and he visited Montgomery on his free days. He often spoke of his ambition to become a famous novelist, and he sent her a chapter of a book he was writing. At the time, Zelda dismissed Fitzgerald&#x27;s remarks as mere boastfulness, and she concluded that he would never become a famous writer. Infatuated with Zelda, Scott redrafted the character of Rosalind Connage in his unpublished manuscript &quot;The Romantic Egotist&quot; to resemble her, and he told Zelda that &quot;the heroine does resemble you in more ways than four.&quot;

In addition to inspiring the character of Rosalind Connage, Scott used a quote from Zelda&#x27;s letters for a soliloquy by the narrator at the conclusion of &quot;The Romantic Egotist&quot;, later retitled and published as &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;. Zelda wrote Scott a letter eulogizing the Confederate dead who perished during the American Civil War. &quot;I&#x27;ve spent today in the graveyard... Isn&#x27;t it funny how, out of a row of Confederate soldiers, two or three will make you think of dead lovers and dead loves—when they&#x27;re exactly like the others, even to the yellowish moss,&quot; she wrote to Scott. In the final pages of his novel, Fitzgerald altered Zelda&#x27;s sentiments to refer to Union soldiers instead of Confederates.

During the early months of their courtship, Zelda and Scott strolled through the Confederate Cemetery at Oakwood Cemetery. While walking past the headstones, Scott ostensibly failed to show sufficient reverence, and Zelda informed Scott that he would never understand how she felt about the Confederate dead. Scott drew upon Zelda&#x27;s intense feelings about the Confederacy and the Old South in his 1920 short story &quot;The Ice Palace&quot; about a Southern girl who becomes lost in an ice maze while visiting a northern town.

While dating Zelda and other women in Montgomery, Scott received a letter from Ginevra King informing him of her impending arranged marriage to polo player William &quot;Bill&quot; Mitchell. Three days after Ginevra King married Bill Mitchell on September 4, 1918, Scott professed his affections for Zelda. In his ledger, Scott wrote that he had fallen in love on September 7, 1918. His love for Zelda increased as time passed, and he wrote to his friend Isabelle Amorous: &quot;I love her and that&#x27;s the beginning and end of everything. You&#x27;re still a Catholic, but Zelda&#x27;s the only God I have left now.&quot; Ultimately, Zelda fell in love as well. Her biographer Nancy Milford wrote, &quot;Scott had appealed to something in Zelda which no one before him had perceived: a romantic sense of self-importance which was kindred to his own.&quot;

Their courtship was interrupted in October when he was summoned north. He expected to be sent to France, but he was instead assigned to Camp Mills, Long Island. While he was there, the Allied Powers signed an armistice with Imperial Germany. He then returned to the base near Montgomery. Together again, Zelda and Scott now engaged in what he later described as sexual recklessness, and by December 1918, they had consummated their relationship. Although this was the first time they were sexually intimate, both Zelda and Scott had other sexual partners prior to their first meeting and courtship. Initially, Fitzgerald did not intend to marry Zelda, but the couple gradually viewed themselves as informally engaged, although Zelda declined to marry him until he proved financially successful.

On February 14, 1919, he was discharged from the military and went north to establish himself in New York City. During this time, Zelda mistakenly feared she was pregnant. Scott mailed her pills to induce an abortion, but Zelda refused to take them and replied in a letter: &quot;I simply can&#x27;t and won&#x27;t take those awful pills... I&#x27;d rather have a whole family than sacrifice my self-respect... I&#x27;d feel like a damn whore if I took even one.&quot; They wrote frequently, and by March 1920, Scott had sent Zelda his mother&#x27;s ring, and the two had become engaged. However, when Scott&#x27;s attempts to become a published author faltered during the next four months, Zelda became convinced that he could not support her accustomed lifestyle, and she broke off the engagement during the Red Summer of 1919. Having been rejected by both Zelda and Ginevra during the past year due to his lack of financial prospects, Scott suffered from intense despair, and he carried a revolver daily while contemplating suicide. 

Soon after, in July 1919, Scott returned to St. Paul. Having returned to his hometown as a failure, Scott became a social recluse and lived on the top floor of his parents&#x27; home at 599 Summit Avenue, on Cathedral Hill. He decided to make one last attempt to become a novelist and to stake everything on the success of a book. Abstaining from alcohol and parties, he worked day and night to revise &quot;The Romantic Egotist&quot; as &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;—an autobiographical account of his Princeton years and his romances with Ginevra, Zelda, and others. At the time, Scott&#x27;s feelings for Zelda were at an all-time low, and he remarked to a friend, &quot;I wouldn&#x27;t care if she died, but I couldn&#x27;t stand to have anybody else marry her.&quot;

== Marriage and celebrity ==
By September 1919, Scott completed his first novel, &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;, and editor Maxwell Perkins of Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons accepted the manuscript for publication. Scott requested an accelerated release to renew Zelda&#x27;s faith in him: &quot;I have so many things dependent on its success—including of course a girl.&quot; After Scott informed Zelda of his novel&#x27;s upcoming publication, a shocked Zelda replied apologetically: &quot;I hate to say this, but I don&#x27;t think I had much confidence in you at first... It&#x27;s so nice to know you really &quot;can&quot; do things—anything—and I love to feel that maybe I can help just a little.&quot; 

Zelda agreed to marry Scott once Scribner&#x27;s published the novel; in turn, Fitzgerald promised to bring her to New York with &quot;all the iridescence of the beginning of the world.&quot; Scribner&#x27;s published &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; on March 26, 1920, and Zelda arrived in New York on March 30. A few days later, on April 3, 1920, they married in a small ceremony at St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral. 

At the time of their wedding, Fitzgerald later claimed neither he nor Zelda still loved each other, and the early years of their marriage in New York City proved to be a disappointment. According to biographer Andrew Turnbull, &quot;victory was sweet, though not as sweet as it would have been six months earlier before Zelda had rejected him. Fitzgerald couldn&#x27;t recapture the thrill of their first love&quot;. As the affections between Zelda and Scott cooled, Scott continued to obsess over the loss of his first love, Ginevra King, and, for the remainder of their marriage, he could not think of Ginevra &quot;without tears coming to his eyes.&quot;

Despite the cooling of their affections, Scott and Zelda quickly became celebrities of New York, as much for their wild behavior as for the success of &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;. They were ordered to leave both the Biltmore Hotel and the Commodore Hotel for disturbing other guests. Their daily lives consisted of outrageous pranks and drunken escapades. While fully dressed, they jumped into the water fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in New York. They frequently hired taxicabs and rode on the hood. One evening, while inebriated, they decided to visit the county morgue, where they inspected unidentified corpses; and, on another evening, Zelda insisted on sleeping in a dog kennel. Alcohol increasingly fueled their nightly escapades. Publicly, this meant little more than napping when they arrived at parties; but privately, it increasingly led to bitter arguments. To their mutual delight, New York newspapers depicted Zelda and Scott as cautionary examples of youth and excess—the &quot;enfants terribles&quot; of the hedonistic Jazz Age.

After a month of hotel evictions, the Fitzgeralds moved to a cottage in Westport, Connecticut, where Scott worked on drafts of his second novel. Because of her privileged upbringing with many African-American servants, Zelda could not perform household responsibilities at Westport. During the early months of their marriage, Scott&#x27;s unwashed clothes began disappearing. One day, he opened a closet and discovered his dirty clothes piled to the ceiling. Uncertain of what to do with unwashed clothes, Zelda had never sent them out for cleaning: she had simply tossed everything into the closet. 

Soon after, Scott employed two maids and a laundress. Zelda&#x27;s complete dependence upon servants became the comedic focus of magazine articles. When Harper &amp; Brothers asked Zelda to contribute her favorite recipes in an article, she wrote: &quot;See if there is any bacon, and if there is, ask the cook which pan to fry it in. Then ask if there are any eggs, and if so try and persuade the cook to poach two of them. It is better not to attempt toast, as it burns very easily. Also, in the case of bacon, do not turn the fire too high, or you will have to get out of the house for a week. Serve preferably on china plates, though gold or wood will do if handy.&quot;

While Scott attempted to write his next novel at their home in Westport, Zelda announced that she was homesick for the Deep South. In particular, she missed eating Southern cuisine such as peaches and biscuits for breakfast. She suggested that they travel to Montgomery, Alabama. On July 15, 1920, the couple traveled in a touring car—which Scott derogatorily nicknamed &quot;the rolling junk&quot;—to her parents&#x27; home in Montgomery. After visiting Zelda&#x27;s family for several weeks, they abandoned the unreliable vehicle and returned via train to Westport, Connecticut. Zelda&#x27;s parents visited their Westport cottage soon after, but her father Judge Anthony Sayre took a dim view of the couples&#x27; constant partying and scandalous lifestyle. Following this visit, the Fitzgeralds relocated to an apartment at 38 West 59th Street in New York City.

== Pregnancy and Scottie ==

In February 1921, while Scott labored on drafts of his inchoate second novel, &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;, Zelda discovered she was pregnant. She requested that the child be born on Southern soil in Alabama, but Fitzgerald adamantly refused. Zelda wrote despondently to a friend: &quot;Scott&#x27;s changed... He used... to say he loved the South, but now he wants to get as far away from it as he can.&quot; To Zelda&#x27;s chagrin, her husband insisted upon having the baby at his northern home in Saint Paul, Minnesota. On October 26, 1921, she gave birth to Frances &quot;Scottie&quot; Fitzgerald. As she emerged from anesthesia, Scott recorded Zelda saying, &quot;Oh, God, goofo I&#x27;m drunk. Mark Twain. Isn&#x27;t she smart—she has the hiccups. I hope it&#x27;s beautiful and a fool—a beautiful little fool.&quot; Many of her words found their way into Scott&#x27;s novels: in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, the character Daisy Buchanan expresses a similar hope for her daughter.

While writing &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;, Scott drew upon &quot;bits and pieces&quot; of Zelda&#x27;s diary and letters. He modeled the character Anthony Patch on himself and the character Gloria Patch on—in his words—the chill-mindedness and selfishness of Zelda. Prior to publication, Zelda proofread the drafts, and she urged her husband to cut the cerebral ending, which focused on the main characters&#x27; lost idealism. Upon its publication, Burton Rascoe, the newly appointed literary editor of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, approached Zelda for an opportunity to entice readers with a satirical review of Scott&#x27;s latest work as a publicity stunt. 

Although Zelda had carefully proofread drafts of the novel, she pretended in her review to read the novel for the very first time, and she wrote partly in jest that &quot;on one page I recognized a portion of an old diary of mine... and, also, scraps of letters which, though considerably edited, sound to me vaguely familiar. In fact, Mr. Fitzgerald—I believe that is how he spells his name—seems to believe that plagiarism begins at home.&quot; In the same review, Zelda joked that she hoped her husband&#x27;s novel would become a commercial success as &quot;there is the cutest cloth of gold dress for only $300 in a store on Forty-second Street&quot;.

The satirical review led to Zelda receiving offers from other magazines to write stories and articles. According to their daughter, Scott &quot;spent many hours editing the short stories she sold to &quot;College Humor&quot; and to &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;&quot;. In June 1922, &quot;Metropolitan Magazine&quot; published an essay by Zelda Fitzgerald titled &quot;Eulogy on the Flapper&quot;. At the time flappers were typically young, modern women who bobbed their hair and wore short skirts. They also drank alcohol and had premarital sex. Though ostensibly a piece about the decline of the flapper lifestyle after its heyday in the early 1920s, Zelda&#x27;s biographer Nancy Milford wrote that Zelda&#x27;s essay served as &quot;a defense of her own code of existence.&quot; In the article, Zelda described the ephemeral phenomenon of the flapper:

After the publication of &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot; in March 1922, the Fitzgeralds traveled to either New York or St. Paul in order for Zelda to procure an abortion. Ultimately, Zelda would have three abortions during their marriage, and her sister Rosalind later questioned whether Zelda&#x27;s later mental deterioration was due to health side-effects of these unsafe procedures. Zelda&#x27;s thoughts on terminating her second pregnancy are unknown, but in the first draft of &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;, Scott wrote a scene in which Gloria Gilbert believes she is pregnant and Anthony Patch suggests she &quot;talk to some woman and find out what&#x27;s best to be done. Most of them fix it some way.&quot; Anthony&#x27;s suggestion was removed from the final version, and this significant alteration shifted the focus from a moral dilemma about the act of abortion to Gloria&#x27;s superficial concern that a baby would ruin her figure.

Following the financial failure of Scott&#x27;s play &quot;The Vegetable&quot;, the Fitzgeralds found themselves mired in debt. Although Scott wrote short stories furiously to pay the bills, he became burned out and depressed. During this period, while Scott wrote short stories at home, the New York Police Department detained Zelda near the Queensboro Bridge on the suspicion of her being the &quot;Bobbed Haired Bandit,&quot; an infamous spree-robber later identified as Celia Cooney. Following this incident, the couple departed in April 1924 for Paris, France, in the hope of living a more frugal existence abroad in Europe.

== Expatriation to Europe ==

After arriving in Paris, the couple soon relocated to Antibes on the French Riviera. While Scott labored on drafts of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, Zelda became infatuated with a French naval aviator, Edouard Jozan. The exact details of the supposed romance are unverifiable and contradictory, and Jozan himself claimed that the Fitzgeralds invented the entire incident. According to conflicting accounts, Zelda spent afternoons swimming at the beach and evenings dancing at the casinos with Jozan. After several weeks, she asked Scott for a divorce. Scott purportedly challenged Jozan to duel and locked Zelda in their villa until he could kill him. Before any fatal confrontation could occur, Jozan—who had no intention of marrying Zelda—fled the Riviera, and the Fitzgeralds never saw him again. Soon after, Zelda possibly overdosed on sleeping pills.

On his part, Jozan dismissed the entire story as pure fabrication and claimed that no romance with Zelda had ever occurred: &quot;They both had a need of drama, they made it up and perhaps they were the victims of their own unsettled and a little unhealthy imagination.&quot; In later retellings, both Zelda and Scott embellished the story, and Zelda later falsely told Ernest Hemingway and his wife Hadley Richardson that the affair ended when Jozan committed suicide. In fact, Jozan had been transferred by the French military to Indochina.

Regardless of whether any extramarital affair with Jozan occurred, the episode led to a breach of trust in their marriage, and Fitzgerald wrote in his notebook, &quot;I knew something had happened that could never be repaired.&quot; The incident likely influenced Fitzgerald&#x27;s writing of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, and he drew upon many elements of his tempestuous relationship with Zelda, including the loss of certainty in her love. In August, he wrote to his friend Ludlow Fowler: &quot;I feel old too, this summer ... the whole burden of this novel—the loss of those illusions that give such color to the world that you don&#x27;t care whether things are true or false as long as they partake of the magical glory.&quot;

Scott finalized &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; in October 1924. The couple attempted to celebrate with travel to Rome and Capri, but both were unhappy and unhealthy. When he received the galleys for his novel, Scott fretted over the best title: &quot;Trimalchio in West Egg&quot;, just &quot;Trimalchio&quot; or &quot;Gatsby,&quot; &quot;Gold-hatted Gatsby,&quot; or &quot;The High-bouncing Lover&quot;. Disliking Fitzgerald&#x27;s chosen title of &quot;Trimalchio in West Egg&quot;, editor Max Perkins persuaded him that the reference was too obscure and that people would be unable to pronounce it. After both Zelda and Perkins expressed their preference for &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, Fitzgerald agreed. It was also on this trip, while ill with colitis, that Zelda began painting artworks.

== Meeting Ernest Hemingway ==
Returning to Paris in April 1925, Zelda met Ernest Hemingway, whose career her husband did much to promote. Through Hemingway, the Fitzgeralds were introduced to Gertrude Stein, Alice B. Toklas, Robert McAlmon, and others. Scott and Hemingway became close friends, but Zelda and Hemingway instantly disliked each other from their first meeting, although Hemingway admitted to having an &quot;erotic dream&quot; about Zelda the night they met. She openly referred to him with homophobic slurs and denounced him as a &quot;fairy with hair on his chest&quot;. She considered Hemingway&#x27;s domineering macho persona to be merely a posture to conceal his homosexuality; in turn, Hemingway told Scott that Zelda was &quot;insane&quot;. In his memoir &quot;A Moveable Feast&quot;, Hemingway claims he realized that Zelda had a mental illness when she insisted that jazz singer Al Jolson was greater than Jesus Christ. Hemingway alleged that Zelda sought to destroy her husband, and she purportedly taunted Fitzgerald over his penis size. After examining it in a public restroom, Hemingway confirmed Fitzgerald&#x27;s penis to be of average size. 

Hemingway claimed that Zelda urged her husband to write lucrative short stories as opposed to novels in order to support her accustomed lifestyle. To supplement their income, Fitzgerald often wrote stories for magazines such as &quot;The Saturday Evening Post&quot;, &quot;Collier&#x27;s Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Esquire&quot;. &quot;I always felt a story in &quot;The Post&quot; was tops,&quot; Zelda later recalled, &quot;but Scott couldn&#x27;t stand to write them. He was completely cerebral, you know. All mind.&quot; Scott would write his stories in an &quot;authentic&quot; manner and then rewrite them to add plot twists, which increased their salability as magazine stories. This &quot;whoring&quot; for Zelda—as Hemingway dubbed these sales—emerged as a sore point in their friendship. After reading &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;, Hemingway vowed to put any differences with Fitzgerald aside and to aid him in any way he could, although he feared Zelda would derail Fitzgerald&#x27;s career. In a letter to Fitzgerald, Hemingway warned him that Zelda would derail his career:

A more serious rift in the Fitzgerald&#x27;s marriage occurred when Zelda suspected that Scott was closeted homosexual, and she alleged that Fitzgerald and Hemingway engaged in homosexual relations. In the ensuing months, she frequently belittled Scott with homophobic slurs during their public excursions. Biographer Matthew J. Bruccoli posits that Zelda&#x27;s inordinate preoccupation with other persons&#x27; sexual behavior likely indicated the onset of her paranoid schizophrenia. However, Fitzgerald&#x27;s sexuality was a popular subject of debate among his friends and acquaintances. As a youth, Fitzgerald had a close relationship with Father Sigourney Fay, a possibly gay Catholic priest, and Fitzgerald later used his last name for the idealized romantic character of Daisy Fay Buchanan. After college, Fitzgerald cross-dressed during outings in Minnesota and flirted with men at social events. While staying in Paris, rumors dogged Fitzgerald among the American expat community that he was gay. 

Irritated by Zelda&#x27;s recurrent homophobic attacks on his sexual identity, Scott decided to have sex with a Parisian prostitute. Zelda found condoms that he had purchased before any sexual encounter occurred, and a bitter quarrel ensued, resulting in ingravescent jealousy. Soon after, a jealous Zelda threw herself down a flight of marble stairs at a party because Fitzgerald, engrossed in talking to American dancer Isadora Duncan, ignored her. In December 1926, after two unpleasant years in Europe that considerably strained their marriage, the Fitzgeralds returned to America, but their marital difficulties continued to fester.

In January 1927, the Fitzgeralds relocated to Los Angeles, where Scott wrote &quot;Lipstick&quot; for United Artists and met Hollywood starlet Lois Moran. Jealous of Moran, Zelda set fire to her clothing in a bathtub as a self-destructive act. She disparaged Moran as &quot;a breakfast food that many men identified with whatever they missed from life.&quot; Fitzgerald&#x27;s relations with Moran exacerbated the Fitzgeralds&#x27; marital difficulties and, after merely two months in Hollywood, the unhappy couple relocated to Ellerslie in Wilmington, Delaware, in March 1927. Literary critic Edmund Wilson, recalling a party at the Fitzgerald home in Edgemoor, Delaware, in February 1928, described Zelda as follows:

== Obsession and illness ==
By 1927, at the Ellersie estate in Wilmington, Delaware, Scott had become severely alcoholic, and Zelda&#x27;s behavior became increasingly erratic. Much of the conflict between them stemmed from the boredom and isolation Zelda experienced when Scott was writing. She would often interrupt him when he was working, and the two grew increasingly miserable. Stung by Fitzgerald&#x27;s criticism that all great women use their talents constructively, Zelda had a deep desire to develop a talent that was entirely her own.

At the age of 28, she became obsessed with Russian ballet, and she decided to embark upon a career as a prima ballerina. Her friend Gerald Murphy counseled against her ambition and remarked that &quot;there are limits to what a woman of Zelda&#x27;s age can do and it was obvious that she had taken up the dance too late.&quot; Despite her being far too old to achieve such an ambition, Scott Fitzgerald paid for Zelda to begin practicing under the tutelage of Catherine Littlefield, director of the Philadelphia Opera Ballet. After the Fitzgeralds returned to Europe in summer 1928, Scott paid for Zelda to study under Russian ballerina Lubov Egorova in Paris. 

In September 1929, the San Carlo Opera Ballet Company in Naples invited her to join their ballet school. In preparation, Zelda undertook a grueling daily practice of up to eight hours a day, and she &quot;punished her body in strenuous efforts to improve.&quot; According to Zelda&#x27;s daughter, although Scott &quot;greatly appreciated and encouraged his wife&#x27;s unusual talents and ebullient imagination,&quot; he became alarmed when her &quot;dancing became a twenty-four-hour preoccupation which was destroying her physical and mental health.&quot; Soon after, Zelda collapsed from physical and mental exhaustion. One evening, Scott returned home to find an exhausted Zelda seated on the floor and entranced with a pile of sand. When he asked her what she was doing, she could not speak. He summoned a French physician, who examined Zelda and informed him that &quot;your wife is mad.&quot;

Soon after her physical and mental collapse, Zelda&#x27;s mental health further deteriorated. In October 1929, during an automobile trip to Paris along the mountainous roads of the Grande Corniche, Zelda seized the car&#x27;s steering wheel and tried to kill herself, her husband, and her nine-year-old daughter, Scottie, by driving over a cliff. After this homicidal incident, Zelda sought psychiatric treatment. On April 23, 1930, the Malmaison Clinic near Paris admitted her for observation. On May 22, 1930, she moved to Valmont sanatorium in Montreux, Switzerland. The clinic primarily treated gastrointestinal ailments, and, due to her profound psychological problems, she was moved again to a psychiatric facility in Prangins on the shores of Lake Geneva on June 5, 1930. At Prangins in June, Dr. Oscar Forel issued a tentative diagnosis of schizophrenia, but he feared her psychological condition might be far worse. Zelda&#x27;s biographer, Nancy Milford, quotes Dr. Forel&#x27;s full diagnosis: 

After five months of observation, Doctor Eugen Bleuler—one of Europe&#x27;s leading psychiatrists—confirmed Dr. Forel&#x27;s diagnosis of Zelda as a schizophrenic on November 22, 1930. (Following Zelda&#x27;s death, later psychiatrists speculated that Zelda instead had bipolar disorder.) She was released from Prangins in September 1931. In an attempt to keep his wife out of an asylum, Scott hired nurses and attendants to care for Zelda at all times. Although there were periods where her behavior was merely eccentric, she could frequently become a danger to herself and others. In one instance, she attempted to throw herself in front of a moving train and, in another instance, she attacked a visiting guest at their home without provocation. Despite her precarious mental health, the couple traveled to Montgomery, Alabama, where her father, Judge Anthony Sayre, lay dying. After her father&#x27;s death, her mental health again deteriorated and she had another breakdown.

== &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; ==

In February 1932, after an episode of hysteria, Zelda insisted that she be readmitted to a mental hospital. On February 12, 1932, over her husband&#x27;s objections, Fitzgerald was admitted by The Henry Phipps Psychiatric Clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, where her treatment was overseen by Dr. Adolf Meyer, an expert on schizophrenia. As part of her recovery routine, she spent at least two hours a day writing a manuscript. At the Phipps Clinic, Zelda developed a bond with Dr. Mildred Squires, a female resident. When Dr. Squires asked Scott to speculate why Zelda&#x27;s mental health had deteriorated, Fitzgerald replied: 

Toward the end of February 1932, Zelda shared fragments of her manuscript with Dr. Squires, who wrote to Scott that the unfinished novel was vivid and had charm. Zelda wrote to Scott from the hospital, &quot;I am proud of my novel, but I can hardly restrain myself enough to get it written. You will like it—It is distinctly École Fitzgerald, though more ecstatic than yours—perhaps too much so.&quot; Zelda finished the novel on March 9. She sent the unaltered manuscript to Scott&#x27;s editor, Maxwell Perkins, at Scribner&#x27;s. 

Surprised to receive an unannounced novel in the mail from Zelda, Perkins carefully perused the manuscript. He concluded the work had &quot;a slightly deranged quality which gave him the impression that the author had difficulty in separating fiction from reality.&quot; He felt the manuscript contained several good sections, but its overall tone seemed hopelessly &quot;dated&quot; and tonally resembled Fitzgerald&#x27;s 1922 work &quot;The Beautiful and Damned&quot;. Perkins hoped that her husband might be able to improve its overall quality with his criticism.

Upon learning that Zelda had submitted her manuscript to Perkins, Scott became angry that she had not shown her manuscript to him beforehand. After reading the manuscript, he objected to her novel&#x27;s plagiarism of his protagonist in &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot;. He was further upset to learn that Zelda&#x27;s novel used the very same plot elements as his upcoming novel, &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;. After receiving letters from Scott delineating these objections, Zelda wrote to Scott apologetically that she was &quot;afraid we might have touched the same material.&quot; 

Despite Scott&#x27;s initial annoyance, a debt-ridden Fitzgerald realized that Zelda&#x27;s book might earn a tidy profit. Consequently, his requested revisions were &quot;relatively few&quot;, and &quot;the disagreement was quickly resolved, with Scott recommending the novel to Perkins.&quot; Several weeks later, Scott wrote to Perkins: &quot;Here is Zelda&#x27;s novel. It is a good novel now, perhaps a very good novel—I am too close to tell. It has the faults and virtues of a first novel... It should interest the many thousands in dancing. It is &quot;about something&quot; and absolutely new, and should sell.&quot; Although unimpressed, Perkins agreed to publish the work as a way for Fitzgerald to repay his financial debt to Scribner&#x27;s. Perkins arranged for half of Zelda&#x27;s royalties to be applied against Scott&#x27;s debt to Scribner&#x27;s until at least $5,000 had been repaid. 

In March 1932, the Phipps Clinic discharged Zelda, and she joined her husband Scott and her daughter at the La Paix estate in Baltimore, Maryland. Although discharged, she remained mentally unwell. One month later, Fitzgerald took her to lunch with critic H. L. Mencken, the literary editor of &quot;The American Mercury&quot;. In his diary, Mencken noted Zelda &quot;went insane in Paris a year or so ago, and is still plainly more or less off her base.&quot; Throughout the luncheon, she manifested signs of mental distress. A year later, when Mencken met Zelda for the last time, he described her mental illness as immediately evident to any onlooker and her mind as &quot;only half sane.&quot; He regretted that F. Scott Fitzgerald could not write novels, as he had to write magazine stories to pay for Zelda&#x27;s psychiatric treatment.

On October 7, 1932, Scribner&#x27;s published &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; with a printing of 3,010 copies—not unusually low for a first novel in the middle of the Great Depression—on cheap paper, with a cover of green linen. According to Zelda, the book derived its title from a Victor record catalog, and the title evoked the romantic glitter of the lifestyle which F. Scott Fitzgerald and herself experienced during the riotous Jazz Age. The parallels to the Fitzgeralds were obvious: The protagonist of the novel is Alabama Beggs—like Zelda, the daughter of a Southern judge—who marries David Knight, an aspiring painter who abruptly becomes famous for his work. They live the fast life in Connecticut before departing to live in France. Dissatisfied with her marriage, Alabama throws herself into ballet. Though told she has no chance, she perseveres and after three years becomes the lead dancer in an opera company. Alabama becomes ill from exhaustion, however, and the novel ends when they return to her family in the South, as her father is dying.

Echoing Zelda&#x27;s frustrations, the novel portrays Alabama&#x27;s struggle to establish herself independently of her husband and to earn respect for her own accomplishments. In contrast to Scott&#x27;s unadorned prose, Zelda&#x27;s writing style in &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; is replete with verbal flourishes and complex metaphors. The novel is also deeply sensual; as literary scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin observed in 1979, &quot;the sensuality arises from Alabama&#x27;s awareness of the life surge within her, the consciousness of the body, the natural imagery through which not only emotions but simple facts are expressed, the overwhelming presence of the senses, in particular touch and smell, in every description.&quot; 

The reviews of &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; by literary critics were overwhelmingly negative. The critics savaged Zelda&#x27;s florid prose as overwritten, attacked her fictional characters as uninteresting, and mocked her tragic scenes as grotesquely &quot;harlequinade&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; published a particularly harsh review and lambasted her editor Max Perkins: &quot;It is not only that her publishers have not seen fit to curb an almost ludicrous lushness of writing but they have not given the book the elementary services of a literate proofreader.&quot; The overwhelmingly negative reviews bewildered and distressed Zelda.

== Painting and later years ==

From the mid-1930s onward, Zelda would be hospitalized sporadically for the rest of her life at sanatoriums in Baltimore, New York, and in Asheville, North Carolina. When Scott visited Zelda in the sanatoriums, she increasingly exhibited signs of mental instability. During one visit, Scott and friends took Zelda on an outing to a nearby home in Tryon, North Carolina. During the lunch, she became withdrawn and ceased communication. On the return drive to the sanatorium, she wrenched open the car door and threw herself out of the moving vehicle in an attempt to kill herself. In another incident, Zelda&#x27;s unexpected loss of a tennis match at the Asheville sanatorium resulted in her physically attacking her tennis partner and beating them over the head with her tennis racket.

Despite the deterioration of her mental health, she continued pursuing her artistic ambitions. After the critical and commercial failure of &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot;, she attempted to write a farcical stage play titled &quot;Scandalabra&quot; in Fall 1932. However, after submitting the manuscript to agent Harold Ober, Broadway producers rejected her play. Following this rejection, Scott arranged for her play &quot;Scandalabra&quot; to be staged by a Little Theater group in Baltimore, Maryland, and he sat through long hours of rehearsals of the play. A year later, during a group therapy session with her husband and a psychiatrist, Fitzgerald remarked that she was &quot;a third-rate writer and a third-rate ballet dancer.&quot; Following this remark, Zelda attempted to paint watercolors while in and out of sanatoriums.

In March 1934, Scott Fitzgerald arranged the first exhibition of Zelda&#x27;s artwork—13 paintings and 15 drawings—in New York City. As with the tepid reception of her book, New York critics were ill-disposed towards her paintings. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; described them merely as &quot;paintings by the almost mythical Zelda Fitzgerald; with whatever emotional overtones or associations may remain from the so-called Jazz Age.&quot; No actual description of the paintings was provided in the review. 

Following the critical failure of her artwork exhibition, Scott awoke one morning to discover Zelda had gone missing. After the arrival of a doctor and several attendants, a manhunt ensued in New York City. Ultimately, they found Zelda in Central Park digging a grave. Soon after, she became even more violent and reclusive. In 1936, Scott placed her in the Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina, writing to friends:

Zelda remained in the hospital while Scott returned to Hollywood for a $1,000-a-week job with MGM in June 1937. Estranged from Zelda, he attempted to reunite with his first love, Ginevra King, when she visited California in October 1938, but his uncontrolled alcoholism sabotaged their brief reunion. When a disappointed King returned to Chicago, Fitzgerald settled into a clandestine relationship with Hollywood gossip columnist Sheilah Graham. Throughout their relationship, Graham claimed that Fitzgerald felt constant guilt over Zelda&#x27;s mental illness and confinement. He repeatedly attempted sobriety, suffered from depression, had violent outbursts, and attempted suicide.

For the next several years, a depressed Scott continued screenwriting on the West Coast and visiting a hospitalized Zelda on the East Coast. In April 1939, a coterie from Zelda&#x27;s mental hospital had planned to go to Cuba, but Zelda had missed the trip. The Fitzgeralds decided to go on their own. The trip proved to be a disaster. During this trip, spectators at a cockfight beat Scott when he tried to intervene against animal cruelty. He returned to the United States so exhausted and intoxicated that he required hospitalization. The Fitzgeralds never saw each other again.

Scott returned to Hollywood in order to pay the ever-increasing bills for Zelda&#x27;s continued hospitalization. She made some progress in Asheville, and in March 1940, four years after admittance, she was discharged to her mother&#x27;s care. She was nearly forty now, her friends were long gone, and the Fitzgeralds no longer had much money. They wrote to each other frequently, and they made plans to meet again in December 1940. In a letter Zelda wrote to Fitzgerald shortly before he died of a heart attack, she said: &quot;I am sorry that there should be nothing to greet you but an empty shell . . . I love you anyway . . . even if there isn&#x27;t any me or any love or even any life . . . I love you.&quot; Their planned rendezvous did not occur due to Scott&#x27;s death of occlusive coronary arteriosclerosis at 44 years of age in December 1940. Due to her fragile mental health, Zelda could not attend his funeral in Rockville, Maryland.

After Scott&#x27;s death, Zelda read his unfinished manuscript titled &quot;The Love of the Last Tycoon.&quot; She wrote to his friend Edmund Wilson who agreed to edit the book and to eulogize his legacy. Zelda believed Scott&#x27;s work contained &quot;an American temperament grounded in belief in oneself and &#x27;will-to-survive&#x27; that Scott&#x27;s contemporaries had relinquished. Scott, she insisted, had not. His work possessed a vitality and stamina because of his indefatigable faith in himself.&quot; After reading &quot;The Last Tycoon&quot;, Zelda began work on a new novel, &quot;Caesar&#x27;s Things&quot;. As she had missed Scott&#x27;s funeral because of her mental health, she likewise missed Scottie&#x27;s wedding. By August 1943, she returned to the Highland Hospital. She worked on her novel while checking in and out of the hospital. She did not get better, and she did not finish the novel.

== Hospital fire and death ==

Towards the end of her life, Zelda resided in and out of sanatoriums. Zelda checked back into the hospital in September 1946, and then she returned to live with her mother Minnie in their Alabama home. By this point in her life, she had undergone over ten years of electroshock therapy and insulin shock treatments. Consequently, she now &quot;suffered from severe loss of memory and an apathetic personality due to constant shock therapies.&quot; 

Possibly due to these treatments or her deteriorated mental health, she espoused fascism as a political ideology. According to biographer Nancy Milford, Zelda became &quot;taken with the idea of fascism as a way of holding everything together, of ordering the masses.&quot; When acquaintance Henry Dan Piper visited Zelda in March 1947, she declared that fascism served &quot;to keep things from falling apart and to keep the finer things from being lost or extinguished.&quot; 

In November 1947, Zelda returned for the last time to Highland Hospital in Asheville, North Carolina. Because of insulin treatments her weight increased to 130 pounds. Acquaintance Edna Garlington Spratt recalled Zelda&#x27;s grim appearance in the final months before her death: &quot;She was anything but pretty when I saw her. She acted normal, but she looked so dreadful. Her hair was stringy and she had lost all pride in herself.&quot; Early in March 1948, her doctors told her she was better and she could leave, but she allegedly stayed for further treatment. 

On the night of March 10, 1948, a fire broke out in the hospital kitchen. Zelda had been sedated and locked in a room on the fifth floor, possibly awaiting shock therapy. The fire moved through the dumbwaiter shaft, spreading onto every floor. The fire escapes were wooden, and they caught fire as well. Nine women, including Zelda, died. She was identified by her dental records and, according to other reports, one of her slippers. A follow-up investigation raised the unconfirmed possibility that the fire had been a work of arson by Willie Mae, a disgruntled or mentally disturbed hospital employee who had initiated the fire in the kitchen.

Zelda and Scott were buried in Rockville, Maryland, originally in Rockville Cemetery, away from his family plot. Only one photograph of the original gravesite is known to exist, taken in 1970 by Fitzgerald scholar Richard Anderson and published in 2016. At her daughter Scottie&#x27;s request, Zelda and Scott were interred with the other Fitzgeralds at Saint Mary&#x27;s Catholic Cemetery. Inscribed on their tombstone is the final sentence of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;: &quot;So we beat on, boats against the current, borne back ceaselessly into the past.&quot;

== Critical reappraisal ==
At the time of his third and fatal heart attack in December 1940, her husband Scott Fitzgerald died believing himself to be a failure as a writer. Two years later, after the United States&#x27; entrance into World War II, an association of publishing executives created the Council on Books in Wartime which distributed 155,000 copies of &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; to U.S. soldiers overseas, and the book proved popular among beleaguered troops. By 1944, a full-scale Fitzgerald revival had occurred. Despite the renewed interest in Scott&#x27;s oeuvre, Zelda&#x27;s death in March 1948 was little noted in the press. 

In 1950, acquaintance and screenwriter Budd Schulberg wrote &quot;The Disenchanted&quot;, with characters based recognizably on the Fitzgeralds who end up as forgotten former celebrities, he awash with alcohol and she befuddled by mental illness. It was followed in 1951 by Cornell University professor Arthur Mizener&#x27;s &quot;The Far Side of Paradise,&quot; a biography of F. Scott Fitzgerald that rekindled interest in the couple among scholars. Mizener&#x27;s biography was serialized in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly,&quot; and a story about the book appeared in &quot;Life&quot; magazine. Scott was depicted as a fascinating failure; Zelda&#x27;s mental health was largely blamed for his lost potential.

In 1970, however, the history of Zelda and Scott&#x27;s marriage saw its most profound revision in a book by Nancy Milford, a graduate student at Columbia University. &quot;Zelda: A Biography&quot;, the first book-length treatment of Zelda&#x27;s life, became a finalist for the National Book Award and figured for weeks on &quot;The New York Times&quot; best-seller list. The book recast Zelda as an artist in her own right whose talents were belittled by a controlling husband. Zelda posthumously became an icon of the feminist movement in the 1970s—a woman whose unappreciated potential had been suppressed by patriarchal society. 

After the success of Milford&#x27;s 1970 biography, scholars began to view Zelda&#x27;s work in a new light. Prior to Milford&#x27;s biography, scholar Matthew J. Bruccoli had written in 1968 that Zelda&#x27;s novel &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; was &quot;worth reading partly because anything that illuminates the career of F. Scott Fitzgerald is worth reading—and because it is the only published novel of a brave and talented woman who is remembered for her defeats.&quot; However, in the wake of Milford&#x27;s biography, a new perspective emerged, and scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin wrote in 1979: &quot;&quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; is a moving and fascinating novel which should be read on its own terms equally as much as &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;. It needs no other justification than its comparative excellence.&quot; After Milford&#x27;s 1970 biography, &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; became the focus of many literary studies that explored different aspects of her work: how the novel contrasted with Scott&#x27;s depiction of their marriage in &quot;Tender Is the Night&quot;, and how the consumer culture that emerged in the 1920s placed stress on modern women.

In 1991, Zelda&#x27;s collected writings including &quot;Save Me the Waltz&quot; were edited by Matthew J. Bruccoli and published. Reviewing the collection, &quot;The New York Times&quot; literary critic Michiko Kakutani wrote &quot;that the novel was written in two months is amazing. That for all its flaws it still manages to charm, amuse and move the reader is even more remarkable. Zelda Fitzgerald succeeded, in this novel, in conveying her own heroic desperation to succeed at something of her own, and she also managed to distinguish herself as a writer with, as Edmund Wilson once said of her husband, a &#x27;gift for turning language into something iridescent and surprising.&#x27;&quot;

In addition to a critical reappraisal of her novel, Zelda&#x27;s artwork also has been reappraised as interesting in its own right. After spending much of the 1950s and 1960s in family attics—Zelda&#x27;s mother even had much of the art burned because she disliked it—her work drew the renewed interest of scholars. Posthumous exhibitions of her watercolors have toured the United States and Europe. A review of the exhibition by curator Everl Adair noted the influence of Vincent van Gogh and Georgia O&#x27;Keeffe on her paintings and concluded that her surviving corpus of art &quot;represents the work of a talented, visionary woman who rose above tremendous odds to create a fascinating body of work—one that inspires us to celebrate the life that might have been.&quot;

Scholars continue to debate the role that Zelda and Scott may have had in inspiring and stifling each other&#x27;s creativity. Biographer Sally Cline wrote that the two camps can be &quot;as diametrically opposed as the Plath and Hughes literary camps&quot;—a reference to the heated controversy about the relationship of husband–wife poets Ted Hughes and Sylvia Plath. In particular, partisan scholars of Zelda frequently depict Scott Fitzgerald as a domineering husband who drove his wife insane. 

In response to this narrative, Zelda&#x27;s daughter Scottie Fitzgerald wrote an essay dispelling such &quot;inaccurate&quot; interpretations. She particularly objected to revisionist depictions of her mother as &quot;the classic &#x27;put down&#x27; wife, whose efforts to express her artistic nature were thwarted by a typically male chauvinist husband&quot;. In contrast, Scottie insisted &quot;that my father greatly appreciated and encouraged his wife&#x27;s unusual talents and ebullient imagination. Not only did he arrange for the first showing of her paintings in New York in 1934 he sat through long hours of rehearsals of her one play, &quot;Scandalabra&quot;, staged by a Little Theater group in Baltimore; he spent many hours editing the short stories she sold to &quot;College Humor&quot; and to &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Magazine&quot;.&quot; Towards the end of her life, Scottie wrote a final coda about her parents to a biographer: &quot;I have never been able to buy the notion that it was my father&#x27;s drinking which led her to the sanitarium. Nor do I think she led him to the drinking.&quot;

== Legacy and influence ==
Zelda was the inspiration for &quot;Witchy Woman&quot;, the song of seductive enchantresses written by Don Henley and Bernie Leadon for the Eagles, after Henley read Zelda&#x27;s biography; of the muse, the partial genius behind her husband F. Scott Fitzgerald, the wild, bewitching, mesmerizing, quintessential &quot;flapper&quot; of the Jazz Age.

Zelda&#x27;s name served as inspiration for Princess Zelda, the eponymous character of &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series of video games.

In 2003, a wild turkey which roamed Battery Park in New York City was named Zelda due to a famous episode when, during one of her nervous breakdowns, she went missing and was found in Battery Park, apparently having walked several miles downtown. 

In 1989, the F. Scott and Zelda Fitzgerald museum opened in Montgomery, Alabama. The museum is in a house they briefly rented in 1931 and 1932. It is one of the few places where some of Zelda&#x27;s paintings are kept on display.

In 1992, Zelda and her daughter Scottie were posthumously inducted into the Alabama Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2023, Hatteras Sky and Lark Hotels planned three boutique hotels in Asheville, North Carolina, two of which will have Zelda Fitzgerald themes. Zelda Dearest, with 20 rooms, will have the &quot;beauty and optimism&quot; of Zelda&#x27;s early life. Zelda Salon, named for Gertrude Stein&#x27;s home in France, will have 35 rooms, with the design based on where the Fitzgeralds stayed in the 1920s.

<text>Richard J. Skrenta Jr. (born June 6, 1967) is an American computer programmer and Silicon Valley entrepreneur who created the web search engine blekko.

==Early life and education==
Skrenta Jr. was born in Pittsburgh on June 6, 1967. In 1982, at age 15, as a high school student at Mt. Lebanon High School, Skrenta wrote the Elk Cloner virus that infected Apple II computers. It is widely believed to have been one of the first large-scale self-spreading personal computer viruses ever created.

In 1989, Skrenta graduated with a B.A. in computer science from Northwestern University.

==Career==
Between 1989 and 1991, Skrenta worked at Commodore Business Machines with Amiga Unix.

In 1989, Skrenta started working on a multiplayer simulation game. In 1994, it was launched under the name &quot;Olympia&quot; as a pay-for-play PBEM game by Shadow Island Games.

Between 1991 and 1995, Skrenta worked at Unix System Labs, and from 1996 to 1998 with IP-level encryption at Sun Microsystems. He later left Sun and became one of the founders of DMOZ. He stayed on board after the Netscape acquisition, and continued to work on the directory as well as Netscape Search, AOL Music, and AOL Shopping.

After his stint at AOL, Skrenta went on to cofound Topix LLC, a Web 2.0 company in the news aggregation and forums market.

In 2005, Skrenta and his fellow cofounders sold a 75% share of Topix to a newspaper consortium made up of Tribune, Gannett, and Knight Ridder.

In the late 2000s, Skrenta headed the startup company Blekko Inc, which was an Internet search engine. Blekko received early investment support from Marc Andreessen and began public beta testing on November 1, 2010.

In 2015, IBM acquired both the Blekko company and search engine for their Watson computer system.

Skrenta was involved in the development of &quot;VMS Monster&quot;, an old MUD for VMS. VMS Monster was part of the inspiration for TinyMUD. He is also known for his role in developing TASS, an ancestor of tin, the popular threaded Usenet newsreader for Unix systems.

<text>Marstrand () is a seaside locality situated in Kungälv Municipality, Västra Götaland County, Sweden. It had 1,320 inhabitants in 2010. The town got its name from its location on the island of Marstrand. Despite its small population, for historical reasons Marstrand is often referred to as a &quot;city&quot;.

The city had free port status, which was declared by King Gustav III, from 1775 to 1794. Religious liberty established by the same sovereign allowed an early Swedish congregation of Jews to be established there in 1775 and one of Scandinavia&#x27;s first synagogues was set up in Fort Fredriksborg in 1780, making the village a notable site to the history of the Jews in Sweden.

Following the abolishment of the free port status and the decline of herring fishing, Marstrand established itself as a seaside resort in the 19th century.

Important annual sporting events held in Marstrand include the Stena Match Cup Sweden and Marstrand Regatta. 
Marstrand is known as a playground for celebrities and wealthy Swedish residents alike, who come in the summer for the sea, shopping and the nightlife.

==History==

Marstrand has held city privileges since 1200. The most striking feature of Marstrand is the 17th-century fortress Carlsten, named for King Charles X of Sweden. 

During the last quarter of the 18th century Marstrand had free port status granted by King Gustav III. 

In the 1790s, the Jewish inhabitants of Marstrand numbered around 60 individuals at its peak Jewish population time. In 1805, all the Jews, except for one family, had left Marstrand for Gothenburg. Notable families of the Marstrand Jewish community were the Henriques, Delbanco, Warburg, von Reis and Magnus families. 

Administratively Marstrand with immediately surrounding islands was a municipality of its own until the local government reform of 1971 when it was merged into Kungälv Municipality.

In 1969, around 200 stateless Polish Jews arrived there.

== Sports ==
=== Sailing ===
Being an island makes Marstrand popular for sailing and boat races.

Marstrand is the host venue for &quot;Match Cup Sweden&quot;, part of the World Match Racing Tour. The event draws international sailing teams to Marstrand. DS-37 boats are raced two at a time. Points accrued count towards the World Match Racing Tour and a place in the final event, with the overall winner taking the title ISAF World Match Racing Tour Champion. Match racing is well suited to Marstand. Highlights of the events are broadcast on Eurosport television and via the official World Match Racing Tour website.

<doc id="271153" wikidata="Q5478929" url="?curid=271153" title="Frances Scott Fitzgerald">
<text>Frances Scott &quot;Scottie&quot; Fitzgerald (October 26, 1921 – June 18, 1986) was an American writer and journalist and the only child of novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald and Zelda Sayre Fitzgerald. She matriculated from Vassar College and worked for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, and other publications. She became a prominent member of the Democratic Party.

In her later years, Fitzgerald became a critic of biographers&#x27; depictions of her parents and their marriage. She particularly objected to biographies that depicted her father as a domineering husband who drove his wife insane. Towards the end of her life, Scottie wrote a final coda about her parents to a biographer: &quot;I have never been able to buy the notion that it was my father&#x27;s drinking which led her to the sanitarium. Nor do I think she led him to the drinking.&quot;

Fitzgerald died from throat cancer at her Montgomery home in 1986, aged 64. She was posthumously inducted into the Alabama Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame in 1992.

== Early life and family ==
Scottie Fitzgerald was born on October 26, 1921, in Saint Paul, Minnesota. As her mother Zelda Fitzgerald emerged from the anesthesia, her husband Scott recorded Zelda saying, &quot;Oh, God, goofo I&#x27;m drunk. Mark Twain. Isn&#x27;t she smart—she has the hiccups. I hope it&#x27;s beautiful and a fool—a beautiful little fool.&quot; F. Scott Fitzgerald later used some of Zelda&#x27;s rambling almost verbatim for Daisy Buchanan&#x27;s dialogue in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot;.

Scottie spent her childhood moving from place to place with her parents including time in Paris and Antibes in France, and five years&#x27; residence in a beach house her father rented on the edge of Chesapeake Bay not far from Baltimore, Maryland. She attended Calvert School and briefly attended the Bryn Mawr School while her mother Zelda received treatment at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Regarding her parents&#x27; behavior during her childhood, Scottie remarked: 

In September 1936, fifteen-year-old Fitzgerald began attending the Ethel Walker School, a fashionable boarding school in Simsbury, Connecticut. The tuition was $2,200 a year, but her father arranged for a reduction. From this time on, Fitzgerald&#x27;s agent Harold Ober and his wife Anne Ober became her surrogate parents. The Obers visited her at school, and she stayed with them in Scarsdale during holidays. On September 4, 1938, Anne Ober wrote to Scottie&#x27;s father F. Scott Fitzgerald about her deep maternal relationship with his daughter: 

Soon after, Scottie was expelled for sneaking away from campus in order to hitchhike to Yale to meet a romantic interest. In September 1938, she entered Vassar College. Hoping that she would not repeat his academic failures, her father wrote letters to her urging her to study hard. These letters of advice were later collected as &quot;Letters to His Daughter&quot;.

Seventeen months before her graduation, her father F. Scott Fitzgerald died of a heart attack due to occlusive coronary arteriosclerosis at 44 years old. On learning of her father&#x27;s death, Scottie telephoned his mistress Sheilah Graham from Vassar and asked that she not attend the funeral for the sake of social propriety. On her part, Scottie insisted that she always viewed Sheilah Graham with affection: 

== Marriage and career ==
After her matriculation from Vassar in June 1942, Scottie worked as a publicist for Radio City Music Hall and as a researcher for &quot;Time&quot; magazine. During World War II, she contributed to the &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; section of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, wrote nightclub reviews, and also published her first piece of fiction there, titled &quot;The Stocking Present&quot;. She also wrote for a number of other magazines.

In February, 1943, amid World War II, Scottie married Lieutenant Samuel Jackson &quot;Jack&quot; Lanahan in New York. Lanahan was a Princeton University alumnus from Baltimore, Maryland, whom she had begun dating prior to her father&#x27;s death while she was at Vassar. It was a hasty wartime wedding with Scottie wearing a long white gown that Mrs. Harold Ober—who had been a sort of foster mother to Scottie during her mother Zelda&#x27;s recurrent institutionalization—bought for her the day before the ceremony. Her mother, Zelda, did not attend the wedding. Shortly after their marriage, Lanahan left Scottie for overseas duty.

After the war, her husband Jack Lanahan became a prominent Washington lawyer, and the couple were popular hosts in Washington society in the 1950s and 1960s. During this period, she wrote and directed musical comedies about the Washington social scene that were performed annually to benefit the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Washington. Her show &quot;Onward and Upward with the Arts&quot; was considered for a Broadway run by producer David Merrick.

During their marriage, Scottie and Jack had four children: Thomas Addison &quot;Tim&quot; Lanahan (who died by suicide at the age of 27 in 1973); Eleanor Anne Lanahan; Samuel Jackson Lanahan, Jr, and Cecilia Scott Lanahan.

== Later life and political activities ==
In 1953, she joined the staff of &quot;The Democratic Digest&quot;, published by the Democratic National Committee. She became a writer for Democratic Governor Adlai E. Stevenson when he ran against President Dwight Eisenhower in 1956. That year she became a political columnist for &quot;The Northern Virginia Sun&quot;. In 1967, she divorced her husband and married Clinton Grover Smith.

In her later years, Fitzgerald criticized biographers&#x27; depictions of her parents&#x27; marriage. In the wake of Nancy Milford&#x27;s biography of her mother, partisan scholars of Zelda frequently depicted Scott Fitzgerald as a domineering husband who drove his wife insane. In response to this historical revisionism, Zelda&#x27;s daughter Scottie Fitzgerald wrote an essay dispelling such inaccurate interpretations. She particularly objected to revisionist depictions of her mother as &quot;the classic &#x27;put down&#x27; wife, whose efforts to express her artistic nature were thwarted by a typically male chauvinist husband&quot;. In contrast, Scottie insisted: 

Towards the end of her life, Scottie wrote a final coda about her parents to a biographer: &quot;I have never been able to buy the notion that it was my father&#x27;s drinking which led her to the sanitarium. Nor do I think she led him to the drinking.&quot;

During this period of her life, Scottie also collaborated with her news reporting colleague Winzola McLendon to research and write the 1970 book, &quot;Don&#x27;t Quote Me: Washington Newswomen &amp; the Power Society&quot;.

In 1973, when Fitzgerald was legally separated from husband Grove Smith, she moved from Washington, D.C. to her mother&#x27;s home town of Montgomery, Alabama. After her relocation to Montgomery, she researched the family&#x27;s roots and was dismayed to discover her grandfather Anthony D. Sayre, an Alabama state legislator, had introduced a racist bill in 1893 that &quot;deprived the black people of Alabama, and thousands of poor whites, of the right to vote.&quot; The purpose of the 1893 Sayre Election Law was to &quot;maintain white supremacy, and to have a ticket selected where only white men will vote.&quot; Upon learning of this fact, Scottie felt both embarrassment and guilt and for the remainder of her life devoted herself to voter outreach programs in Alabama.

== Final years and death ==
Several months after Fitzgerald&#x27;s relocation, she attended a party in Montgomery when she was informed via long-distance telephone call of her son&#x27;s suicide. She made polite excuses about leaving the party without giving the other guests any indication as to what had happened.

Despite ill-health, Fitzgerald remained active in the state Democratic Party in Alabama, and she worked with Walter Mondale during his campaign trips to Montgomery over the years. During the twelve years that she lived in Montgomery before developing throat cancer, she traveled frequently to visit her three surviving children and grandchildren, none of whom lived near Alabama.

Fitzgerald died from throat cancer at her Montgomery home on June 18, 1986, aged 64. Shortly before she died, she told her three surviving children that she wished she had quit smoking cigarettes years earlier. She is buried next to her parents in Rockville, Maryland.

<text>William Maxwell Evarts &quot;Max&quot; Perkins (September 20, 1884 – June 17, 1947) was an American book editor, best remembered for discovering authors Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, and Thomas Wolfe.

==Early life and education==
Perkins was born on September 20, 1884, in New York City, to Elizabeth (Evarts) Perkins, a daughter of William M. Evarts, and Edward Clifford Perkins, a lawyer. He grew up in Plainfield, New Jersey, attended St. Paul&#x27;s School in Concord, New Hampshire and then graduated from Harvard College in 1907. Although an economics major in college, Perkins also studied under Charles Townsend Copeland, a literature professor who helped prepare Perkins for his career.

==Career==
After working as a reporter for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Perkins joined the publishing house of Charles Scribner&#x27;s Sons in 1910 as an advertising manager, before becoming an editor. At that time, Scribner&#x27;s was known for publishing older authors such as John Galsworthy, Henry James, and Edith Wharton. However, Perkins wished to publish younger writers. Unlike most editors, he actively sought out promising new authors; he made his first big find in 1919 when he signed F. Scott Fitzgerald. Initially, no one at Scribner&#x27;s except Perkins had liked &quot;The Romantic Egotist&quot;, the working title of Fitzgerald&#x27;s first novel, and it was rejected. Even so, Perkins worked with Fitzgerald to revise the manuscript until it was accepted by the publishing house.

Its publication as &quot;This Side of Paradise&quot; (1920) marked the arrival of a new literary generation that would always be associated with Perkins. Fitzgerald&#x27;s profligacy and alcoholism strained his relationship with Perkins. Nonetheless, Perkins remained Fitzgerald&#x27;s friend to the end of Fitzgerald&#x27;s short life, in addition to his editorial relationship with the author, particularly evidenced in &quot;The Great Gatsby&quot; (1925), which benefited substantially from Perkins&#x27; criticism.

It was through Fitzgerald that Perkins met Ernest Hemingway, publishing his first major novel, &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot;, in 1926. Perkins fought for it over objections to Hemingway&#x27;s profanity raised by traditionalists in the firm. The commercial success of Hemingway&#x27;s next novel, &quot;A Farewell to Arms&quot; (1929), which topped the best-seller list, silenced colleagues&#x27; questions about Perkins&#x27; editorial judgment.

The greatest professional challenge Perkins faced was posed by Thomas Wolfe&#x27;s lack of artistic self-discipline. Wolfe wrote voluminously and was greatly attached to each sentence he wrote. After a tremendous struggle, Perkins induced Wolfe to cut 90,000 words from his first novel, &quot;Look Homeward, Angel&quot; (1929). His next, &quot;Of Time and the River&quot; (1935), was the result of a two-year battle during which Wolfe kept writing more and more pages in the face of an ultimately victorious effort by Perkins to hold the line on size. At first grateful to Perkins for discovering and mentoring him, Wolfe later came to resent the popular perception that he owed his success to his editor. Wolfe left Scribner&#x27;s after numerous fights with Perkins. Despite this, Perkins served as Wolfe&#x27;s literary executor after his early death in 1938 and was considered by Wolfe to be his closest friend.

Although his reputation as an editor is most closely linked to these three, Perkins worked with many other writers. He was the first to publish J. P. Marquand and Erskine Caldwell. His advice was responsible for the success of Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, whose &quot;The Yearling&quot; (1938) grew out of suggestions made by Perkins. It became a best-seller and won the Pulitzer Prize. Alan Paton&#x27;s &quot;Cry, the Beloved Country&quot; (1946) was another Perkins find. His penultimate discovery was James Jones, who approached Perkins in 1945. Perkins persuaded Jones to abandon the autobiographical novel he was working on and launched him on what would become &quot;From Here to Eternity&quot; (1951). By this time, Perkins&#x27; health was failing and he did not live to see its success, nor that of Hemingway&#x27;s &quot;The Old Man and the Sea&quot; (1952), which was dedicated to his memory. Perkins&#x27; final discovery was Marguerite Young, who started her mammoth &quot;Miss MacIntosh, My Darling&quot; in 1947 with his encouragement, signing a contract in 1947 based on her 40-page manuscript. The novel was finally published in 1965.

Perkins was noted for his courtesy and thoughtfulness. He also recognized skilled writing wherever he found it and encouraged writers as few editors did. That Ring Lardner has a reputation today, for example, is because Perkins saw him as more than a syndicated humorist. Perkins believed in Lardner more than the writer did, and despite the failure of several earlier collections he coaxed Lardner into letting him assemble another under the title &quot;How To Write Short Stories&quot; (1924). The book sold well and, thanks to excellent reviews, established Lardner as a literary figure.

Apart from his roles as coach, friend, and promoter, Perkins was unusual among editors for the close and detailed attention he gave to books, and for what the novelist Vance Bourjaily, another of his discoveries, called his &quot;infallible sense of structure.&quot; Although he never pretended to be an artist himself, Perkins could often see where an author ought to go more clearly than the writer did. By combining these different editorial activities into his work, Perkins might be considered to be the first authors&#x27; editor.

Scholar Matthew Bruccoli described Perkins as the most widely known literary editor of American literature.

==Personal life==
In 1910, Perkins married Louise Saunders, also of Plainfield; together they had five daughters. Perkins died on June 17, 1947, in Stamford, Connecticut, from pneumonia. 

His home in Windsor, Vermont, had been purchased from John Skinner in the 1820s for $5,000 by William M. Evarts, and had been passed down to Evarts&#x27; daughter and Max&#x27;s mother, Elizabeth Hoar Evarts Perkins. She left the home to family members, including her son Maxwell. The home stayed in the family until 2005, and has been restored and reopened as the Snapdragon Inn. The inn houses the Maxwell Perkins Library, which displays and collects items associated with Maxwell Perkins and his extended family. His house in New Canaan, Connecticut, the Maxwell E. Perkins House, is on the National Register of Historic Places. 

His granddaughter Ruth King Porter is a Vermont writer, and one of his grandsons is the &quot;Riptide&quot; TV series actor Perry King. His granddaughter Jenny King Phillips, a documentary filmmaker and therapist, helped spearhead the restoration of Ernest Hemingway’s home in Cuba. Another grandson, Maxwell E.P. King, is a former editor of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;, president of The Heinz Endowments, chief executive officer of the Fred Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children&#x27;s Media at St. Vincent&#x27;s College, president and CEO of The Pittsburgh Foundation, and the author of &quot;The Good Neighbor: The Life and Work of Fred Rogers,&quot; an authorized biography of the beloved children&#x27;s television host.

==In popular culture==
In the 1983 film &quot;Cross Creek&quot;, exploring his professional relationship with Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings, Perkins is portrayed by actor Malcolm McDowell.

In the 2016 biographical drama film &quot;Genius&quot;, based on A. Scott Berg&#x27;s biography of the man, &quot;Max Perkins: Editor of Genius&quot;, Perkins is portrayed by British actor Colin Firth.

<text>Harold Ober (1881–1959) was an American literary agent. 

In 1907 — two years after graduating from Harvard with a degree in literature — Harold Ober became a literary agent at the Paul R. Reynolds Literary Agency. By 1908 he was representing such authors as Jack London and H. G. Wells. In 1929, he opened his own agency, Harold Ober Associates, — representing authors such as F. Scott Fitzgerald, Agatha Christie, William Faulkner, Philip Wylie, Pearl Buck and Walter D. Edmonds and J. D. Salinger. Although abandoning his contract with the publishers Little, Brown, Inc., Salinger employed and entrusted Ober&#x27;s agency until his death in 2010. Harold Ober died in 1959.
