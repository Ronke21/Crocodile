<text>Thursday is an American post-hardcore band formed in New Brunswick, New Jersey, in 1997. The band consists of Geoff Rickly (lead vocals), Tom Keeley (lead guitar, backing vocals), Steve Pedulla (rhythm guitar, backing vocals), Tim Payne (bass), and Tucker Rule (drums).

The band&#x27;s debut album &quot;Waiting&quot; (1999) featured original guitarist Bill Henderson, who left in 2000 and was replaced by Pedulla. Thursday gained popularity with their second album &quot;Full Collapse&quot; (2001), and the band&#x27;s major-label debut &quot;War All the Time&quot; (2003) debuted at number 7 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The band released &quot;A City by the Light Divided&quot; (2006), &quot;Common Existence&quot; (2009) and &quot;No Devolución&quot; (2011) before announcing an indefinite hiatus following Australian tour dates in 2012, which Rickly later confirmed was a full disbandment. 

Thursday reunited in 2016, touring for the next few years and breaking up again in 2019. In 2020, Thursday announced another reunion at Chicago&#x27;s Riot Fest in 2021. In 2024, the band released &quot;Application for Release From the Dream&quot;, their first new song in 13 years. 

The band is considered influential in the post-hardcore music scene in the 2000s, and is credited as one of the key bands to popularize the darker emo sound and screaming vocals which came to prominence at the time.

==History==
===Formation and &quot;Waiting&quot; (1997–2000)===

Thursday was formed in 1997 by vocalist Geoff Rickly, guitarist Tom Keeley, guitarist Bill Henderson, bassist Tim Payne, and drummer Tucker Rule. The band began playing basement shows in New Brunswick where they were students at Rutgers University and the surrounding New Jersey and New York areas, playing their first official show on December 31, 1998 in Rickly&#x27;s basement alongside Midtown, Saves the Day and Poison the Well.

The band recorded demos to hand out at shows, and in the summer of 1999, teamed up with MP3.com for their first official release, the &quot;1999 Summer Tour EP&quot;, which featured demos of songs that would soon be found on their debut album, &quot;Waiting&quot;. The album was released on December 6, 1999, on northern New Jersey–based Eyeball Records without any singles or support from television or radio.

===&quot;Full Collapse&quot; (2001–2002)===
In 2001, Thursday signed to independent label Victory Records. After signing, they were warned by their friends that they had &quot;gotten ourselves into a situation that we would regret&quot;. The group was unsure what they meant, but thought things would turn out fine due to their contract with the label. They initially thought that part of the contract meant they could sign with a different label they wanted to. However, they realized the deal had stated they could only leave Victory if it was to join a major label, which they thought was &quot;a far-fetched idea to say the least.&quot; Later in the year, they released their second album &quot;Full Collapse&quot; through the label, eventually reaching number 178 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Before appearing on Warped Tour, the group visited Victory&#x27;s offices and learned about Thursday-branded whoopee cushions that the label was planning to sell at the tour. Vocalist Geoff Rickly discussed this matter with Victory founder Tony Brummel, and according to the band, responded that Victory &quot;was a big company and that they didn&#x27;t have time to run everything by the band.&quot;

On several occasions, the group attempted to have better communication with the label in regards to promotion. On one occasion, Brummel informed them they were not living up to his expectations. Sometime afterward, the group was touring with Saves the Day. Brummel became more positive in his interactions, frequently calling the band &quot;just to say hello, or to ask how record sales at shows were going.&quot; The group were disappointed that his positivity &quot;wasn&#x27;t there from the beginning. ... Instead of Tony&#x27;s relationship with us being based on a love for music, it was based entirely on numbers.&quot; The band&#x27;s new-found popularity and disgust with the label led to internal problems, which almost led the band to disband. The situation caused the creation of the &quot;Five Stories Falling EP&quot;, a release the band used to fulfill contractual obligations with Victory Records. At live shows, the band routinely told fans not to purchase the EP, but instead to download &quot;Jet Black New Year&quot;, the only new studio recording found on the EP, with the rest consisting of live performances of four &quot;Full Collapse&quot; songs. While all the interactions with the label were occurring, the group were being contacted by major labels. The group, who &quot;didn&#x27;t understand [anything] about major labels&quot;, pondered about other independent labels they would join. However, due to their contract they wouldn&#x27;t be allowed to move to another independent label. Throughout 2001, people from major label Island Records had been to the band&#x27;s shows since they became a full-time touring act. Soon after, the label expressed interest in signing the band.

===&quot;War All the Time&quot; (2003–2005)===
In late May 2002, the group announced they had signed to Island Records, following a bidding war between other major labels. Up to this point, &quot;Full Collapse&quot; had sold 111,000 copies. On September 9, the group&#x27;s signing to Island Records was made official following negotiations of an exit agreement with Victory Records. The agreement required parent company Island/Def Jam to buy out Victory&#x27;s contract claim for the group&#x27;s next two albums. Rickly said as a result of the deal, Victory Records received $1,200,000, which meant the band would be &quot;[paying off] that bill for as long as we were on the new label.&quot; In addition, their next two albums were required to feature the Victory logo.

With expectation building for their follow-up album, Rickly wanted their next album to be &quot;really aggressive and progressive ... and have all these boundary pushing ideas&quot;. In September and October, the group went on the Plea for Peace Tour, and were planning to work on their next album following its conclusion. They said they had accumulated a lot of ideas but were unable to work on them due to touring. In mid-November, the group began writing new material.

After an entire writing and recording process that took only six months, the band issued their third album and major label debut, &quot;War All the Time&quot;, on September 16, 2003, to critical acclaim and strong commercial performance. &quot;War All the Time&quot; was the first release to feature Andrew Everding on keyboards, though he would not become an official member of the band until December 2004, when he was officially welcomed into the band at a Christmas holiday show held at the Starland Ballroom in Sayreville, New Jersey. The album&#x27;s title, coupled with it being released approximately two years after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, led many critics to believe it was a political album; however, Rickly has denied this on many accounts, instead claiming that he is speaking about love being a war. The album spawned two singles: &quot;Signals Over the Air&quot; and &quot;War All the Time&quot;, though the latter received considerably less attention due to MTV banning the video for controversial material involving a fake news feed that appeared to be real and teenagers being weapon targets.

Thursday toured extensively to support &quot;War All the Time&quot;, featuring dates with acts such as AFI, Thrice, and Coheed and Cambria. On these tours, Thursday performed many in-store acoustic sessions at various Tower Records stores and other record stores. The band also recorded a live acoustic session for Y100 Sonic Sessions, a radio program on the now defunct Philadelphia-based radio station, Y100. The live acoustic version of single &quot;Signals Over the Air&quot; was used on Y100 Sonic Sessions Volume 8. The band released two EPs: the first was &quot;Live from the SoHo &amp; Santa Monica Stores Split EP&quot; and sold exclusively on iTunes, and the second was a promotion found in Revolver, called the &quot;Live in Detroit EP&quot;.

The band went on an indefinite hiatus in 2004, citing label pressure, extensive touring, and health problems as the reasons. However, Thursday returned for a charitable performance to save New York City&#x27;s CBGB, on August 25, 2005, which was streamed live through the CBGB&#x27;s website.

===&quot;A City by the Light Divided&quot; and Envy split release (2006–2008)===
In fall 2005, five Thursday demo songs were stolen from the iPod of the tour manager for My American Heart, a band Rickly had recently collaborated with for their song &quot;We Are the Fabrication&quot;. The band issued a statement on their official website stating that they were disappointed the unfinished products leaked, but that they were glad that people take that much interest in their music. The band confirmed the title of one demo, &quot;At This Velocity&quot; and promised it would make their upcoming album. Three other songs (&quot;The Other Side of the Crash/Over and Out (Of Control)&quot;, &quot;Telegraph Avenue Kiss&quot;, and &quot;Autumn Leaves Revisited&quot;) would also make the album, while the remaining demo would later become the song &quot;Last Call&quot; on their fifth studio album, &quot;Common Existence&quot;. Thursday had originally toyed with the idea of a double album to follow up &quot;War All the Time&quot; but the idea was scrapped, reporting on their website that they believed &quot;not even The Beatles could properly fill two discs with enough worthy material&quot;.

Thursday released their fourth album and second major label release, &quot;A City by the Light Divided&quot;, on May 2, 2006, on Island Records in the US and Hassle Records in the United Kingdom. The album was produced by Dave Fridmann, becoming Thursday&#x27;s first full-length album not produced by Sal Villanueva. The title was created by Geoff Rickly by combining two lines from the poem &quot;Sunstone&quot; by Octavio Paz. The album was available for preview on the band&#x27;s MySpace page on April 18, 2006, two weeks before it was officially released. &quot;A City by the Light Divided&quot; was generally received well by critics, spawning two singles: &quot;Counting 5-4-3-2-1&quot; and &quot;At This Velocity&quot;, though the latter received considerably less attention. The band left Island Records in early 2007.

At their 2007 New Year&#x27;s Eve show at the Starland Ballroom, the band announced that they will be writing and recording new material in 2008. During a private show they performed on May 3, 2007, in New York City, long-time friend and artist manager, David &quot;Rev&quot; Ciancio proposed to his fiancée on stage. Thursday also held a performance on May 5 at The Bamboozle under the fake name Bearfort. Thursday cancelled all tour plans until their fall tour with Circle Takes the Square and Portugal. The Man in support of &quot;Kill the House Lights&quot;, a DVD/CD compilation album and live album. featuring demos, unreleased songs, footage of live performances, and a documentary about the band. The album was released on October 30, 2007, by their former label Victory Records.

Thursday announced on April 2, 2008, via a MySpace bulletin and their official website, a new split album with Japanese post-hardcore band Envy. The band debuted a song from the album live during their show in Poughkeepsie on April 24, 2008, and the album, &quot;Thursday / Envy&quot;, was released on Temporary Residence Limited on November 4, 2008.

===&quot;Common Existence&quot; (2009–2010)===
The band announced on September 30, 2008, that they had signed with Epitaph Records, regarding their new label the band stated: &quot;It&#x27;s a great feeling to have a label encourage you to be more socially conscious and politically active.&quot; Thursday released their fifth full-length album,&quot;Common Existence&quot;, on February 17, 2009, on Epitaph Records. In a March 2009 interview, Rickly explained the album&#x27;s title refers to humanity&#x27;s shared experience, and that many of the songs were influenced by the words of his favorite poets and authors: &quot;Almost every song on the record is connected to a different writer. The first song, &quot;Resuscitation of a Dead Man&quot; is influenced by Denis Johnson&#x27;s &quot;Resuscitation of a Hanged Man&quot;. Another song is based on a book [ Martin Amis&#x27;] Time&#x27;s Arrow. The whole record also has a lot of themes from Roberto Bolano, a poet who wrote &quot;The Savage Detectives&quot; and a few other things. The song &quot;Circuits of Fever&quot; is very influenced by [writer] David Foster Wallace.&quot; Cormac McCarthy has also influenced Rickly.

Thursday headlined the 2009 Taste of Chaos Tour with support from Bring Me the Horizon, Four Year Strong, Pierce The Veil, Cancer Bats and a local act. The band was not well received on this tour, as the majority of the audience members showed up at tour dates mainly for opening act Bring Me the Horizon, with guitarist Tom Keeley approximating about 90% of the audience would leave before their set, and described the tour as an &quot;awful experience.&quot; Rickly said the tour was &quot;stupid&quot; and found it difficult to share a stage with Bring Me the Horizon, who would call the crowd &quot;faggots&quot; during their sets.

===&quot;No Devolución&quot; and disbandment (2011–2015)===
Thursday began recording their next album in July 2010, at Tarbox Road Studios in Fredonia, New York with Dave Fridmann, who had also produced the group&#x27;s two previous albums. Their sixth album and second release for Epitaph Records, &quot;No Devolución&quot;, was released on April 12, 2011. Vocalist Geoff Rickly commented on the style of the new album, stating, &quot;In style, this record feels like a radical departure from our earlier records but in substance it feels like a return. The songs are more vulnerable than they&#x27;ve been in a long time. [...] It&#x27;s very atmospheric and mood oriented so far.&quot; Rickly also stated that the primary lyrical theme is devotion. Thursday debuted &quot;Turnpike Divides&quot; at their annual holiday show on December 30, 2010, at the Starland Ballroom.

On November 22, 2011, Thursday posted a statement on their official website and their Twitter account reading &quot;Thanks &amp; Love&quot;, expressing their intention to stop producing music together. However, the statement about the status of band was ambiguous, not stating explicitly in the article whether they were breaking up or on an indefinite hiatus. The following is excerpted from the article:

The band&#x27;s final show took place on March 5, 2012, at the Soundwave festival in Perth, Australia. 

In January 2013, Geoff Rickly stated during an interview that Thursday had in fact disbanded, and that the term &quot;hiatus&quot; was misleading as it had only been used in case the band did ever decided to play a show again. He did, however, indicate that there was a possibility for the band to play shows in the future, but no new material would ever be produced.

Since their disbandment, Rickly formed the band No Devotion in 2014 with former members of the band Lostprophets, and continued with his side-project United Nations. Tucker Rule became the touring drummer for the British boy band The Wanted, the pop-punk band Yellowcard and worked as a hired musician as well as studio drummer.

===Reunion and second breakup (2016–2019)===
In January 2016, former members of Thursday posted a picture of themselves hanging out to Rickly&#x27;s Twitter account. This sparked rumors that the band would soon be reuniting, however Rickly quickly dispelled them by saying that their communication was minimal in the five years since disbanding and they were &quot;just finally mending some fences and healing some old wounds.&quot; Thursday&#x27;s former booking agent began encouraging them to reunite the band with the freedom to do whatever they wanted and without the pressure of having to write a new album.

Two months later, Thursday announced a reunion at Atlanta&#x27;s Wrecking Ball festival in August 2016. Rickly said: &quot;Five years ago, we found it necessary to end Thursday for reasons beyond our control. Earlier this year, we were able to reconcile all of our differences and spend time together. This is a vital component to what we loved about being in Thursday and we&#x27;re happy to say that we&#x27;ll be playing this show as the same line-up that began touring together on &quot;Full Collapse&quot; and jointly worked on every record since.&quot; Thursday had no intentions to reunite before this and only agreed to perform only two days before publicly announcing their reunion, making the decision because of the festival&#x27;s strong lineup and the involvement of a charity.

In May, Thursday announced an appearance at both Chicago and Denver&#x27;s Riot Fest dates in September. On June 15, Thursday announced a &quot;homecoming&quot; at Starland Ballroom on December 30. On January 31, 2017, Thursday announced a 24-date tour for March and April 2017, the band&#x27;s first full tour since 2012. In June, Thursday headlined the Northside Festival in Brooklyn, New York. 

The band announced in October 2018 that their reunion would end in 2019, stating, &quot;When we stopped playing last time, it wasn&#x27;t on the best of terms. This time, we get to put down touring on the very highest of notes: in each other&#x27;s lives and able to pick up and play together behind closed doors whenever we want. If we are ever able to do Thursday again, it will be a new, separate chapter. Thank you all for your time, attention and friendship.&quot; The band&#x27;s planned final show took place on March 17, 2019, at Saint Vitus in Brooklyn, New York.

However, Thursday did not play any international shows during this reunion, and due to mounting pressure from their international fanbase, the band announced in May 2019 a German show at Cologne&#x27;s Family First Festival. &quot;It seemed impossible that we would all be available at the same time to play shows again, especially in any sustained way. But when our old friends in boysetsfire asked us to play this festival with them, we saw that we had a rare opportunity to accomplish two things at once: visit a country that&#x27;s always been kind to Thursday and play, once more, with a band that we&#x27;ve admired since before we were a band,&quot; the band said.

Further shows followed in Eindhoven, Netherlands, and two UK shows at London&#x27;s Electric Ballroom, with &quot;Full Collapse&quot; played on the first night and &quot;War All the Time&quot; played on the second, which took place in December 2019. The band also opened for the reunited My Chemical Romance at Los Angeles&#x27; The Shrine on December 20. 

===Second return (since 2020)===

In June 2020, Thursday announced that their first show in nearly two years would take place at Riot Fest in September 2021. The band reunited without Everding, reverting to the &quot;Full Collapse&quot; and &quot;War All the Time&quot;-era line-up. Between August 2020 and April 2021, the band shared three virtual performances entitled &quot;Signals&quot;. The first performance (V1) featured guest guitarist Frank Iero, and largely consisted of stripped-back versions of the band&#x27;s songs. The second (V2) was a commemorative holiday show, with guests including Iero, Jim Ward, Walter Schriefels and Bartees Strange. The third and final performance (V3) saw the band performing &quot;Full Collapse&quot; and &quot;No Devolución&quot; in their entirety.

In June 2021, the band shared a cover of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Dancing in the Dark&quot; as part of an ongoing series of covers headed by the creative collective Two Minutes To Late Night. They also played a series of live shows that same month throughout the east coast and midwest of the US, with Taking Back Sunday and Piebald.

In October 2021, the band were featured in Dan Ozzi&#x27;s book &quot;Sellout: The Major Label Feeding Frenzy That Swept Punk, Emo, And Hardcore 1994–2007&quot;. A chapter on &quot;War All the Time&quot; was included in the book, as well as a photo of the band performing live serving as the book&#x27;s cover. In July 2022, the band headlined Philadelphia&#x27;s This is Hardcore Fest, playing &quot;Full Collapse&quot; in its entirety.

In September 2022, the band joined My Chemical Romance as a guest on their North American tour for seven shows. On their last night opening, Thursday performed &quot;Jet Black New Year&quot; with Gerard Way, who features on the original song. Rickly then performed &quot;This Is the Best Day Ever&quot; with My Chemical Romance, a song he featured on. 

On April 12, 2024, the band released their first new song in 13 years, &quot;Application for Release From the Dream&quot;, and revealed plans to record and release more music in the future.

On December 6, 2024, the band released another new song, &quot;White Bikes&quot;. Geoff Rickly said, &quot;The lyrics deal with the loss of a dear friend, who was one of the first people I ever played music with. Before he disappeared on his bicycle, he asked me to meet him but I never made it to the meeting spot. Now whenever I see a white bike on the side of the road I think of him.&quot; It was recorded in Hansa studios in Berlin, and includes Norman Brannon of Texas Is The Reason on guitar. The music video for White Bikes was created by Duran Levinson and Nick Scholey. 

==Logo==

Thursday used a dove logo which is featured on much of the band&#x27;s artwork and merchandise. The dove is believed to have been conceived by guitarist Tom Keeley on a tour bus sometime before &quot;Full Collapse&quot; was recorded. Lyrics from the song &quot;Cross Out the Eyes&quot; on the album reference a dove twice, but it is unknown if these lyrics were inspired by the dove art or vice versa. The logo debuted on the cover art for &quot;War All the Time&quot; in 2003, appearing on the artwork for all of Thursday&#x27;s album and single artwork until 2011, where it was notably absent on the cover art for their sixth and final album &quot;No Devolución&quot;.

The band also used a second logo, a red bullseye with a small chevron below it. This logo first appeared on the cover art for &quot;A City by the Light Divided&quot; in 2006, and featured on merchandise related to the album. It can also be seen faded in the background of the cover for &quot;Kill the House Lights&quot;.

Additionally, Shepard Fairey (creator of Obey) created artwork for the band with a new dove logo, which has been used on other works by Fairey.

== Musical style and influences ==
Thursday&#x27;s musical style has been described as post-hardcore, emo, and screamo. The band has rejected those labels in the past; guitarist Pedulla has stated that they have &quot;always described ourselves as melodic hardcore.&quot; Early on, Thursday was influenced by such bands as The Smiths, The Cure, Joy Division, Fugazi, Drive Like Jehu, Lungfish, Circus Lupus, Rites of Spring, and Embrace. Over time, the band has absorbed elements of bands as varied as Sigur Rós, My Bloody Valentine, Mogwai, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Sunny Day Real Estate, the Appleseed Cast, At the Drive-In, Quicksand, and Jawbox.

<text>Axinomancy is an obscure method of divination using an axe, hatchet, or (rarely) a saw. Most methods involve throwing an axe into the ground, or swinging it into a tree, and interpreting the direction of the handle or the quivering of the blade. A form of this is axiomancy; this is when the quivering of the blade of an axe that has been thrust into a wooden table is interpreted by the diviner.

Another interesting method is heating an axe-head in a fire until it glows, and then interpreting the colors and shapes. A variant, attributed to the ancient Greeks, who held it in good repute, is to balance a spherical piece of agate on the edge of the axe (held sharp edge up). The direction in which the agate rolls can be interpreted as needed.

Some sources claim that Psalm 74 refers to the use of axinomancy to predict the fall of Jerusalem, although in the text the reference to &quot;upright axes&quot; is not specifically for divination.

<text>The Schumann resonances (SR) are a set of spectral peaks in the extremely low frequency portion of the Earth&#x27;s electromagnetic field spectrum. Schumann resonances are global electromagnetic resonances, generated and excited by lightning discharges in the cavity formed by the Earth&#x27;s surface and the ionosphere.

== Description ==
The global electromagnetic resonance phenomenon is named after physicist Winfried Otto Schumann who predicted it mathematically in 1952.
Schumann resonances are the principal background in the part of the electromagnetic spectrum from 3 Hz through 60 Hz and appear as distinct peaks at extremely low frequencies around 7.83 Hz (fundamental), 14.3, 20.8, 27.3, and 33.8 Hz.

Schumann resonances occur because the space between the surface of the Earth and the conductive ionosphere acts as a closed, although variable-sized, waveguide. The limited dimensions of the Earth cause this waveguide to act as a resonant cavity for electromagnetic waves in the extremely low frequency band. The cavity is naturally excited by electric currents in lightning.

In the normal mode descriptions of Schumann resonances, the fundamental mode is a standing wave in the Earth–ionosphere cavity with a wavelength equal to the circumference of the Earth. The lowest-frequency mode has the highest intensity, and the frequency of all modes can vary slightly owing to solar-induced perturbations to the ionosphere (which compress the upper wall of the closed cavity) amongst other factors. The higher resonance modes are spaced at approximately 6.5 Hz intervals (as may be seen by feeding numbers into the formula), a characteristic attributed to the atmosphere&#x27;s spherical geometry. The peaks exhibit a spectral width of approximately 20% due to the damping of the respective modes in the dissipative cavity.

Observations of Schumann resonances have been used to track global lightning activity. Owing to the connection between lightning activity and the Earth&#x27;s climate it has been suggested that they may be used to monitor global temperature variations and variations of water vapor in the upper troposphere. Schumann resonances have been used to study the lower ionosphere on Earth and it has been suggested as one way to explore the lower ionosphere on celestial bodies. Some have proposed that lightning on other planets might be detectable and studied by means of Schumann resonance signatures of those planets.

Effects on Schumann resonances have been reported following geomagnetic and ionospheric disturbances. More recently, discrete Schumann resonance excitation has been linked to transient luminous events — sprites, ELVES, jets, and other upper-atmospheric lightning. A new field of interest using Schumann resonances is related to short-term earthquake prediction. 

Interest in Schumann resonances renewed in 1993 when E.R. Williams showed a correlation between the resonance frequency and tropical air temperatures, suggesting the resonance could be used to monitor global warming. In geophysical survey, Schumann resonances are used to locate offshore hydrocarbon deposits.

== History ==

In 1893, George Francis FitzGerald noted that the upper layers of the atmosphere must be fairly good conductors. Assuming that the height of these layers is about 100 km above ground, he estimated that oscillations (in this case the lowest mode of the Schumann resonances) would have a period of 0.1 second. Because of this contribution, it has been suggested to rename these resonances &quot;Schumann–FitzGerald resonances&quot;. However, FitzGerald&#x27;s findings were not widely known, as they were only presented at a meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, followed by a brief mention in a column in &quot;Nature&quot;.

The first suggestion that an ionosphere existed, capable of trapping electromagnetic waves, is attributed to Heaviside and Kennelly (1902). It took another twenty years before Edward Appleton and Barnett in 1925 were able to prove experimentally the existence of the ionosphere.

Although some of the most important mathematical tools for dealing with spherical waveguides were developed by G. N. Watson in 1918, it was Winfried Otto Schumann who first studied the theoretical aspects of the global resonances of the earth–ionosphere waveguide system, known today as the Schumann resonances. In 1952–1954 Schumann, together with H. L. König, attempted to measure the resonant frequencies. However, it was not until measurements made by Balser and Wagner in 1960–1963 that adequate analysis techniques were available to extract the resonance information from the background noise. Since then there has been an increasing interest in Schumann resonances in a wide variety of fields.

== Basic theory ==
Lightning discharges are considered to be the primary natural source of Schumann resonance excitation; lightning channels behave like huge antennas that radiate electromagnetic energy at frequencies below about 100 kHz. These signals are very weak at large distances from the lightning source, but the Earth–ionosphere waveguide behaves like a resonator at extremely low resonance frequencies.

In an ideal cavity, the resonant frequency of the formula_1-th mode formula_2 is determined by the Earth radius formula_3 and the speed of light formula_4.

:formula_5

The real Earth–ionosphere waveguide is not a perfect electromagnetic resonant cavity. Losses due to finite ionosphere electrical conductivity lower the propagation speed of electromagnetic signals in the cavity, resulting in a resonance frequency that is lower than would be expected in an ideal case, and the observed peaks are wide. In addition, there are a number of horizontal asymmetries—day-night difference in the height of the ionosphere, latitudinal changes in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field, sudden ionospheric disturbances, polar cap absorption, variation in the Earth radius of ± 11 km from equator to geographic poles, etc. that produce other effects in the Schumann resonance power spectra.

== Measurements ==

Today Schumann resonances are recorded at many separate research stations around the world. The sensors used to measure Schumann resonances typically consist of two horizontal magnetic inductive coils for measuring the north-south and east-west components of the magnetic field, and a vertical electric dipole antenna for measuring the vertical component of the electric field. A typical passband of the instruments is 3–100 Hz. The Schumann resonance electric field amplitude (~300 microvolts per meter) is much smaller than the static fair-weather electric field (~150 V/m) in the atmosphere.

Similarly, the amplitude of the Schumann resonance magnetic field (~1 picotesla) is many orders of magnitude smaller than the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field (~30–50 microteslas). Specialized receivers and antennas are needed to detect and record Schumann resonances. The electric component is commonly measured with a ball antenna, suggested by Ogawa et al., in 1966, connected to a high-impedance amplifier. The magnetic induction coils typically consist of tens- to hundreds-of-thousands of turns of wire wound around a core of very high magnetic permeability.

=== Dependence on global lightning activity ===

From the very beginning of Schumann resonance studies, it was known that they could be used to monitor global lightning activity. At any given time there are about 2000 thunderstorms around the globe. Producing approximately 50 lightning events per second, these thunderstorms are directly linked to the background Schumann resonance signal.

Determining the spatial lightning distribution from Schumann resonance records is a complex problem. To estimate the lightning intensity from Schumann resonance records it is necessary to account for both the distance to lightning sources and the wave propagation between the source and the observer. A common approach is to make a preliminary assumption on the spatial lightning distribution, based on the known properties of lightning climatology. An alternative approach is placing the receiver at the North or South Pole, which remain approximately equidistant from the main thunderstorm centers during the day. 

One method not requiring preliminary assumptions on the lightning distribution is based on the decomposition of the average background Schumann resonance spectra, utilizing ratios between the average electric and magnetic spectra and between their linear combination. This technique assumes the cavity is spherically symmetric and therefore does not include known cavity asymmetries that are believed to affect the resonance and propagation properties of electromagnetic waves in the system.

==== Diurnal variations ====

The best documented and the most debated features of the Schumann resonance phenomenon are the diurnal variations of the background Schumann resonance power spectrum.

A characteristic Schumann resonance diurnal record reflects the properties of both global lightning activity and the state of the Earth–ionosphere cavity between the source region and the observer. The vertical electric field is independent of the direction of the source relative to the observer, and is therefore a measure of global lightning. 

The diurnal behavior of the vertical electric field shows three distinct maxima, associated with the three &quot;hot spots&quot; of planetary lightning activity: one at 9 UT (Universal Time) linked to the daily peak of thunderstorm activity from Southeast Asia; one at 14 UT linked to the peak of African lightning activity; and one at 20 UT linked to the peak of South American lightning activity. The time and amplitude of the peaks vary throughout the year, linked to seasonal changes in lightning activity.

===== &quot;Chimney&quot; ranking =====

In general, the African peak is the strongest, reflecting the major contribution of the African &quot;chimney&quot; to global lightning activity. The ranking of the two other peaks—Asian and American—is the subject of a vigorous dispute among Schumann resonance scientists. Schumann resonance observations made from Europe show a greater contribution from Asia than from South America, while observations made from North America indicate the dominant contribution comes from South America.

Williams and Sátori suggest that in order to obtain &quot;correct&quot; Asia-America chimney ranking, it is necessary to remove the influence of the day/night variations in the ionospheric conductivity (day-night asymmetry influence) from the Schumann resonance records. The &quot;corrected&quot; records presented in the work by Sátori, et al. show that even after the removal of the day-night asymmetry influence from Schumann resonance records, the Asian contribution remains greater than American.

Similar results were obtained by Pechony et al. who calculated Schumann resonance fields from satellite lightning data. It was assumed that the distribution of lightning in the satellite maps was a good proxy for Schumann excitations sources, even though satellite observations predominantly measure in-cloud lightning rather than the cloud-to-ground lightning that are the primary exciters of the resonances. Both simulations—those neglecting the day-night asymmetry, and those taking this asymmetry into account—showed the same Asia-America chimney ranking. On the other hand, some optical satellite and climatological lightning data suggest the South American thunderstorm center is stronger than the Asian center.

The reason for the disparity among rankings of Asian and American chimneys in Schumann resonance records remains unclear, and is the subject of further research.

===== Influence of the day-night asymmetry =====

In the early literature the observed diurnal variations of Schumann resonance power were explained by the variations in the source-receiver (lightning-observer) geometry. It was concluded that no particular systematic variations of the ionosphere (which serves as the upper waveguide boundary) are needed to explain these variations. Subsequent theoretical studies supported the early estimations of the small influence of the ionosphere day-night asymmetry (difference between day-side and night-side ionosphere conductivity) on the observed variations in Schumann resonance field intensities.

The interest in the influence of the day-night asymmetry in the ionosphere conductivity on Schumann resonances gained new strength in the 1990s, after publication of a work by Sentman and Fraser. developed a technique to separate the global and the local contributions to the observed field power variations using records obtained simultaneously at two stations that were widely separated in longitude. They interpreted the diurnal variations observed at each station in terms of a combination of a diurnally varying global excitation modulated by the local ionosphere height.

Their work, which combined both observations and energy conservation arguments, convinced many scientists of the importance of the ionospheric day-night asymmetry and inspired numerous experimental studies. Recently it was shown that results obtained by Sentman and Fraser can be approximately simulated with a uniform model (without taking into account ionosphere day-night variation) and therefore cannot be uniquely interpreted solely in terms of ionosphere height variation.

Schumann resonance amplitude records show significant diurnal and seasonal variations which generally coincide in time with the times of the day-night transition (the terminator). This time-matching seems to support the suggestion of a significant influence of the day-night ionosphere asymmetry on Schumann resonance amplitudes. There are records showing almost clock-like accuracy of the diurnal amplitude changes. 

On the other hand, there are numerous days when Schumann resonance amplitudes do not increase at sunrise or do not decrease at sunset. There are studies showing that the general behavior of Schumann resonance amplitude records can be recreated from diurnal and seasonal thunderstorm migration, without invoking ionospheric variations. Two recent independent theoretical studies have shown that the variations in Schumann resonance power related to the day-night transition are much smaller than those associated with the peaks of the global lightning activity, and therefore the global lightning activity plays a more important role in the variation of the Schumann resonance power.

It is generally acknowledged that source-observer effects are the dominant source of the observed diurnal variations, but there remains considerable controversy about the degree to which day-night signatures are present in the data. Part of this controversy stems from the fact that the Schumann resonance parameters extractable from observations provide only a limited amount of information about the coupled lightning source-ionospheric system geometry. The problem of inverting observations to simultaneously infer both the lightning source function and ionospheric structure is therefore extremely underdetermined, leading to the possibility of non-unique interpretations.

==== &quot;Inverse problem&quot; ====

One of the interesting problems in Schumann resonances studies is determining the lightning source characteristics (the &quot;inverse problem&quot;). Temporally resolving each individual flash is impossible because the mean rate of excitation by lightning, ~50 lightning events per second globally, mixes up the individual contributions together. However, occasionally extremely large lightning flashes occur which produce distinctive signatures that stand out from the background signals. Called &quot;Q-bursts&quot;, they are produced by intense lightning strikes that transfer large amounts of charge from clouds to the ground and often carry high peak current. 

Q-bursts can exceed the amplitude of the background signal level by a factor of 10 or more and appear with intervals of ~10 s, which allows them to be considered as isolated events and determine the source lightning location. The source location is determined with either multi-station or single-station techniques and requires assuming a model for the Earth–ionosphere cavity. The multi-station techniques are more accurate, but require more complicated and expensive facilities.

=== Transient luminous events research ===

It is now believed that many of the Schumann resonances transients (Q bursts) are related to the transient luminous events (TLEs). In 1995, Boccippio et al. showed that sprites, the most common TLE, are produced by positive cloud-to-ground lightning occurring in the stratiform region of a thunderstorm system, and are accompanied by Q-burst in the Schumann resonances band. Recent observations reveal that occurrences of sprites and Q bursts are highly correlated and Schumann resonances data can possibly be used to estimate the global occurrence rate of sprites.

==== Global temperature ====

Williams [1992] suggested that global temperature may be monitored with the Schumann resonances. The link between Schumann resonance and temperature is lightning flash rate, which increases nonlinearly with temperature. The nonlinearity of the lightning-to-temperature relation provides a natural amplifier of the temperature changes and makes Schumann resonance a sensitive &quot;thermometer&quot;. Moreover, the ice particles that are believed to participate in the electrification processes which result in a lightning discharge have an important role in the radiative feedback effects that influence the atmosphere temperature. Schumann resonances may therefore help us to understand these feedback effects. A paper was published in 2006 linking Schumann resonance to global surface temperature, which was followed up with a 2009 study.

==== Upper tropospheric water vapor ====

Tropospheric water vapor is a key element of the Earth&#x27;s climate, which has direct effects as a greenhouse gas, as well as indirect effects through interaction with clouds, aerosols and tropospheric chemistry. Upper tropospheric water vapor (UTWV) has a much greater impact on the greenhouse effect than water vapor in the lower atmosphere, but whether this impact is a positive or a negative feedback is still uncertain. 

The main challenge in addressing this question is the difficulty in monitoring UTWV globally over long timescales. Continental deep-convective thunderstorms produce most of the lightning discharges on Earth. In addition, they transport large amount of water vapor into the upper troposphere, dominating the variations of global UTWV. Price [2000] suggested that changes in the UTWV can be derived from records of Schumann resonances.

== On other planets and moons ==

The existence of Schumann-like resonances is conditioned primarily by two factors:
# A closed, planetary-sized and ellipsoidial cavity, consisting of conducting lower and upper boundaries separated by an insulating medium. For the earth the conducting lower boundary is its surface, and the upper boundary is the ionosphere. Other planets may have similar electrical conductivity geometry, so it is speculated that they should possess similar resonant behavior.
# A source of electrical excitation of electromagnetic waves in the extremely low frequency range.
Within the Solar System there are five candidates for Schumann resonance detection besides the Earth: Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Saturn&#x27;s biggest moon Titan.
Modeling Schumann resonances on the planets and moons of the Solar System is complicated by the lack of knowledge of the waveguide parameters. No &quot;in situ&quot; capability exists today to validate the results.

=== Venus ===

The strongest evidence for lightning on Venus comes from the electromagnetic waves first detected by Venera 11 and 12 landers. Theoretical calculations of the Schumann resonances at Venus were reported by Nickolaenko and Rabinowicz [1982] and Pechony and Price [2004]. Both studies yielded very close results, indicating that Schumann resonances should be easily detectable on that planet given a lightning source of excitation and a suitably located sensor.

=== Mars ===
In the case of Mars there have been terrestrial observations of radio emission spectra that have been associated with Schumann resonances. The reported radio emissions are not of the primary electromagnetic Schumann modes, but rather of secondary modulations of the nonthermal microwave emissions from the planet at approximately the expected Schumann frequencies, and have not been independently confirmed to be associated with lightning activity on Mars. There is the possibility that future lander missions could carry in situ instrumentation to perform the necessary measurements. Theoretical studies are primarily directed to parameterizing the problem for future planetary explorers.

Detection of lightning activity on Mars has been reported by Ruf et al. [2009]. The evidence is indirect and in the form of modulations of the nonthermal microwave spectrum at approximately the expected Schumann resonance frequencies. It has not been independently confirmed that these are associated with electrical discharges on Mars. In the event confirmation is made by direct, in situ observations, it would verify the suggestion of the possibility of charge separation and lightning strokes in the Martian dust storms made by Eden and Vonnegut [1973] and Renno et al. [2003]. 

Martian global resonances were modeled by Sukhorukov [1991], Pechony and Price [2004], and Molina-Cuberos et al. [2006]. The results of the three studies are somewhat different, but it seems that at least the first two Schumann resonance modes should be detectable. Evidence of the first three Schumann resonance modes is present in the spectra of radio emission from the lightning detected in Martian dust storms.

=== Titan ===

It was long ago suggested that lightning discharges may occur on Titan, but recent data from Cassini–Huygens seems to indicate that there is no lightning activity on this largest satellite of Saturn. Due to the recent interest in Titan, associated with the Cassini–Huygens mission, its ionosphere is perhaps the most thoroughly modeled today. Schumann resonances on Titan have received more attention than on any other celestial body, in works by Besser et al. [2002], Morente et al. [2003], Molina-Cuberos et al. [2004], Nickolaenko et al. [2003], and Pechony and Price [2004]. It appears that only the first Schumann resonance mode might be detectable on Titan.

Since the landing of the Huygens probe on Titan&#x27;s surface in January 2005, there have been many reports on observations and theory of an atypical Schumann resonance on Titan. After several tens of fly-bys by Cassini, neither lightning nor thunderstorms were detected in Titan&#x27;s atmosphere. Scientists therefore proposed another source of electrical excitation: induction of ionospheric currents by Saturn&#x27;s co-rotating magnetosphere. All data and theoretical models comply with a Schumann resonance, the second eigenmode of which was observed by the Huygens probe. The most important result of this is the proof of existence of a buried liquid water-ammonia ocean under a few tens of km of the icy subsurface crust.
=== Jupiter and Saturn ===

Lightning activity has been optically detected on Jupiter. Existence of lightning activity on that planet was predicted by Bar-Nun [1975] and it is now supported by data from Galileo, Voyagers 1 and 2, Pioneers 10 and 11, and Cassini. Saturn is also confirmed to have lightning activity. Though three visiting spacecraft (Pioneer 11 in 1979, Voyager 1 in 1980, and Voyager 2 in 1981) failed to provide any convincing evidence from optical observations, in July 2012 the Cassini spacecraft detected visible lightning flashes, and electromagnetic sensors aboard the spacecraft detected signatures that are characteristic of lightning.

Little is known about the electrical parameters of the interior of Jupiter or Saturn. Even the question of what should serve as the lower waveguide boundary is a non-trivial one in case of the gaseous planets. There seem to be no works dedicated to Schumann resonances on Saturn. To date there has been only one attempt to model Schumann resonances on Jupiter. 

Here, the electrical conductivity profile within the gaseous atmosphere of Jupiter was calculated using methods similar to those used to model stellar interiors, and it was pointed out that the same methods could be easily extended to the other gas giants Saturn, Uranus and Neptune. Given the intense lightning activity at Jupiter, the Schumann resonances should be easily detectable with a sensor suitably positioned within the planetary-ionospheric cavity.

<doc id="266149" wikidata="Q3695035" url="?curid=266149" title="Coscinomancy">
<text>Coscinomancy is a form of divination utilising a sieve and shears, used in ancient Greece, medieval and early modern Europe and 17th century New England, to determine the guilty party in a criminal offense, find answers to questions, etc.

The term comes into English via both New Latin and Medieval Latin &quot;coscinomantia&quot;, and is ultimately derived from the Ancient Greek &quot;koskinomantis&quot; () a diviner using a sieve, from &quot;koskinon&quot; () a sieve. The word is mentioned by a number of Ancient Greek writers, including Philippides, Julius Pollux, Lucianus and, most famously, Theocritus.

One method of practising coscinomancy is described by Cornelius Agrippa, best known for his Three Books of Occult Philosophy, 1533. Following the disputed Fourth Book in the same series, a work entitled the &quot;Heptameron, or Magical Elements&quot; appeared in the first volume of Agrippa&#x27;s &quot;Opera omnia, or Collected Works&quot; (circa 1600). The first of two appendices to the Heptameron (chapter xxi) briefly covers many forms of ceremonial magic, including coscinomancy. Agrippa believed that the movement of the sieve was performed by a demon, and that the conjuration actually compelled the demon to perform the task. He further notes that the words of this conjuration were understood neither by the speaker nor anyone else (). The notion of a powerfully efficacious language of the spirit world is quite common in magic belief. The so-called Enochian language of the 16th century magician Edward Kelley, later revived by Aleister Crowley, is such a language. Kelley believed the Enochian words so powerful that he would communicate them to his cohort, Dr. John Dee, backwards, lest he unleash powers beyond control. This concept can also be seen in &quot;The Arabian Nights&quot; in which a sorceress takes some lake water in her hand and over it speaks &quot;words not to be understood&quot;.

There has been some speculation about the manner in which the sieve was to be held by the shears, with some writers suggesting that a piece of thread was used. In the 1567 edition of Agrippa&#x27;s works there is a picture showing exactly this. It is clear that the sieve was suspended from the shears in such a way that the cutting edges of the blades made tangents to the outer rim of the sieve. Thus suspended the sieve is capable of some sideways movement, or even of dropping. The sieve was held by the two middle fingers only making it almost impossible to keep the sieve still for any length of time and thus ensuring a prognostication. The complicating factor is that in the Latin text accompanying the picture the sieve is said to &quot;turn around&quot; (&quot;circum agatur&quot;), which clearly it cannot do unless held at two diametrically opposite points on the outer rim.

Other references to coscinomancy can be found in François Rabelais&#x27; &quot;Pantagruel&quot; (1532: III. xxv.); Johann Weyer&#x27;s &quot;De Praestigiis Daemonum et Incantationibus ac Venificiis&quot; (1583: xii.); and Barten Holyday&#x27;s &quot;Technogamia, or the Marriage of the Arts&quot; (1618: II. iii. ll. 89-146 (G2v)).

<doc id="266150" wikidata="Q130356471" url="?curid=266150" title="Ausia fenestrata">
<text>Ausia fenestrata is a curious Ediacaran period (635 – 539 million years ago) fossil represented by only one specimen 5 cm long from the Nama Group, a Vendian to Cambrian group of stratigraphic sequences deposited in the Nama foreland basin in central and southern Namibia. It has similarity to &quot;Burykhia&quot; from Ediacaran (Vendian) siliciclastic sediments exposed on the Syuzma River of Arkhangelsk Oblast, northwest Russia.
This fossil is of the form of an elongate bag-like sandstone cast (Nama-type preservation) tapering to a cone on one end. The surface of the fossil is covered with oval depressions (&quot;windows&quot;) regularly spaced over the surface in the manner of concentric/parallel rows. The taxonomic identity of &quot;Ausia&quot; is unresolved.

==Interpretations==
* G. Hahn and H. D. Pflug suggested that &quot;Ausia&quot; is a pennatulacean coral from the family Veretillidae, but there are no signs of secondary polyps on the fossil, which are nonetheless represented in Hahn and Pflug&#x27;s reconstruction. No veretillids are represented in the fossil record as far as is known.
* Some researchers have assumed that these depressions are pores and interpreted &quot;Ausia&quot; as an ancestor of archeocyathans and other sponge-like organisms or true sponge. But Adolf Seilacher has argued that the &quot;windows&quot; are merely dimples.
* &quot;Ausia&quot; may represent ascidians (sea squirts), an invertebrate group related to the chordates. Results of a new study of a &quot;Burykhia&quot; from Russia have shown a possible affinity of these organisms to the ascidians, which are urochordates. The Russian species is more than 90 mm across, and the rows of oval depressions are separated by structures which were probably grooves in the internal wall surface of the living organism. The study&#x27;s authors interpret these fossils as the internal sand casts of a vast bag-like cavity, possibly a pharynx or branchial basket. The animals represented by these two genera were thought to live in the shallow waters of an epicontinental sea, slightly more than 555-548 million years ago, and the authors feel this is probably the oldest evidence of the chordate lineage of metazoans.
* Jerzy Dzik has suggested that &quot;Ausia&quot; bears some similarity to the halkieriids, and resembles the body plan that might be expected of halkieriid ancestors under the coeloscleritophoran hypothesis.

<text>is the main residence of the Emperor of Japan. It is a large park-like area located in the Chiyoda district of the Chiyoda ward of Tokyo and contains several buildings including the where the Emperor has his living quarters, the where various ceremonies and receptions take place, some residences of the Imperial Family, an archive, museums and administrative offices.

The palace grounds and gardens are built on the site of the old Edo Castle.

== History ==
===Edo castle===

After the capitulation of the shogunate and the Meiji Restoration, the inhabitants, including the Shōgun Tokugawa Yoshinobu, were required to vacate the premises of the Edo Castle. Leaving the Kyoto Imperial Palace on 26 November 1868, the Emperor arrived at the Edo Castle, made it to his new residence and renamed it to . At this time, Tōkyō had also been called Tōkei. He left for Kyōto again, and after coming back on 9 May 1869, it was renamed to .

Previous fires had destroyed the Honmaru area containing the old &quot;donjon&quot; (which itself burned in the 1657 Meireki fire). On the night of 5 May 1873, a fire consumed the Nishinomaru Palace (formerly the shōgun&#x27;s residence), and the new imperial was constructed on the site in 1888. The castle has many gardens.


A non-profit was founded in 2004 with the aim of a historically correct reconstruction of at least the main donjon. In March 2013, Naotaka Kotake, head of the group, said that &quot;the capital city needs a symbolic building&quot;, and that the group planned to collect donations and signatures on a petition in support of rebuilding the tower. A reconstruction blueprint had been made based on old documents. The Imperial Household Agency at the time had not indicated whether it would support the project.

===The old palace===

In the Meiji period, most structures from the Edo Castle disappeared. Some were cleared to make way for other buildings, while others were destroyed by earthquakes and fire. For example, the wooden over the moat were replaced with stone and iron bridges. The buildings of the Imperial Palace constructed in the Meiji era were constructed of wood. Their design employed traditional Japanese architecture in their exterior appearance while the interiors were an eclectic mixture of fashionable Japanese and European elements. The ceilings of the grand chambers were coffered with Japanese elements; however, Western chairs, tables and heavy curtains furnished the spaces. The floors of the public rooms had parquets or carpets, while the residential spaces used traditional &quot;tatami&quot; mats.

The main audience hall was the central part of the palace. It was the largest building in the compound. Guests were received there for public events. The floor space was more than 223 tsubo or approximately . In the interior, the coffered ceiling was traditional Japanese-style, while the floor was parquetry. The roof was styled similarly to the Kyoto Imperial Palace, but was covered with (fireproof) copper plates rather than Japanese cypress shingles.

In the late Taishō and early Shōwa period, more concrete buildings were added, such as the headquarters of the Imperial Household Ministry and the Privy Council. These structures exhibited only token Japanese elements.

From 1888 to 1948, the compound was called . On the night of 25 May 1945, most structures of the Imperial Palace were destroyed in the Allied firebombing raid on Tokyo. According to the US bomber pilot Richard Lineberger, the Emperor&#x27;s Palace was the target of their special mission on July 29, 1945, and was hit with 2000-pound bombs. In August 1945, in the closing days of the Pacific War, Emperor Hirohito met with his Privy Council and made decisions culminating in the surrender of Japan at an underground air-raid shelter on the palace grounds referred to as .

Due to the large-scale destruction of the Meiji-era palace, a new and residences were constructed on the western portion of the site in 1964–1968, designed by architect Junzō Yoshimura. The area was renamed in 1948, while the eastern part was renamed and became a public park in 1968.

Interior images of the Meiji-era palace
=== Present palace ===
The present Imperial Palace encompasses the retrenchments of the former Edo Castle. The modern designed for various imperial court functions and receptions is located in the old &quot;Nishinomaru&quot; section of the palace grounds. The &quot;kyūden&quot; was completed in 1968 and put into use in April 1969. It was built with the traditional Japanese architectural beauty of a large roof and columns and beams, and most of its building materials are of domestic origin. It has a total area of 24,175 square meters and consists of seven wings. On a much more modest scale, the , the official residence of the Emperor and empress, is located in the Fukiage Garden. Designed by Japanese architect Shōzō Uchii the modern residence was completed in 1993. The residence is currently in use by Emperor Naruhito.

Except for the Imperial Household Agency and the East Gardens, the main grounds of the palace are generally closed to the public, except for reserved guided tours from Tuesdays to Saturdays (which access only the Kyūden Totei Plaza in front of the Chowaden). Each New Year (January 2) and Emperor&#x27;s Birthday (February 23), the public is permitted to enter through the Nakamon (inner gate) where they gather in the Kyūden Totei Plaza. The Imperial Family appears on the balcony before the crowd and the Emperor normally gives a short speech greeting and thanking the visitors and wishing them good health and blessings. Parts of the Fukiage garden are sometimes open to the general public.

The old &quot;Honmaru&quot;, &quot;Ninomaru&quot;, and &quot;Sannomaru&quot; compounds now comprise the East Gardens, an area with public access containing administrative and other public buildings.

The Kitanomaru Park is located to the north and is the former northern enceinte of Edo Castle. It is a public park and is the site of the Nippon Budokan. To the south is Kokyo Gaien National Garden.

Though much of the site is off limits to the public, there have been multiple instances of tourists attempting to trespass on the palace grounds by swimming in the moat. In 2008, a British tourist stripped naked, repeatedly dove into and swam across the moat in an attempt to avoid being arrested, and used stones and a plastic pole as weapons when faced by staff and local police officers. A similar incident took place in 2013, in which two drunken tourists decided to try to sneak into the palace building after removing their clothing and entering the water near Sakurada Gate.

== Grounds ==
=== Kyūden ===

The and the headquarters of the Imperial Household Agency are located in the former Nishinomaru enceinte (&quot;West Citadel&quot;) of the Edo Castle.

The main buildings of the palace grounds, including the main palace, home of the liaison conference of the Imperial General Headquarters, were severely damaged by the fire of May 1945. Today&#x27;s palace consists of multiple modern structures that are interconnected. The palace complex was finished in 1968 and was constructed of steel-framed reinforced concrete structures produced domestically, with two stories above ground and one story below. The buildings of the Imperial Palace were constructed by the Takenaka Corporation in a modernist style with clear Japanese architectural references such as the large, gabled hipped roof, columns and beams.

The complex consists of six wings, including:
* &quot;Seiden&quot; State Function Hall
* &quot;Hōmeiden&quot; State Banquet Hall
* Chōwaden Reception Hall
* &quot;Rensui&quot; Dining Room
* &quot;Chigusa Chidori&quot; Drawing Room and
* The Emperor&#x27;s work office

Halls include the &quot;Minami-Damari&quot;, &quot;Nami-no-Ma&quot;, multiple corridors, &quot;Kita-Damari&quot;, &quot;Shakkyō-no-Ma&quot;, &quot;Shunju-no-Ma&quot;, &quot;Seiden-Sugitoe (Kaede)&quot;, &quot;Seiden-Sugitoe (Sakura)&quot;, &quot;Take-no-Ma&quot;, &quot;Ume-no-Ma&quot; and &quot;Matsu-no-Ma&quot;. Famous &quot;Nihonga&quot; artists such as Maeda Seison were commissioned to paint the artworks.

The Kyūden is used for both receiving state guests and holding official state ceremonies and functions. The Matsu-no-Ma (&quot;Pine Chamber&quot;) is the throne room. The Emperor gives audiences to the Prime Minister in this room, as well as appointing or dismissing ambassadors and Ministers of State. It is also the room where the Prime Minister and Chief Justice is appointed to office.

=== Fukiage Garden ===
The Fukiage Garden has carried the name since the Edo period and is used as the residential area for the Imperial Family.

The , achieved in 1993, was used as the primary residence of Akihito from December 8, 1993, to March 2020. After a period of refurbishment, Naruhito, Masako and Aiko moved in in September 2021.

The in the northern section was originally the residence of Emperor Showa and Empress Kōjun and was called the &quot;Fukiage Palace&quot;. After the Emperor&#x27;s death in 1989, the palace was renamed the &quot;Fukiage Ōmiya Palace&quot; and was the residence of the Empress Dowager until her death in 2000. It is currently not in use.

The palace precincts include the . Parts of the Imperial Regalia of Japan are kept here and the sanctuary plays a religious role in imperial enthronements and weddings.

== East Gardens ==

The East Gardens is where most of the administrative buildings for the palace are located and encompasses the former Honmaru and Ninomaru areas of Edo Castle, a total of . Located on the grounds of the East Gardens is the Imperial &quot;Tokagakudo&quot; Music Hall, the Music Department of the Board of Ceremonies of the Imperial Household, the Archives and Mausolea Department Imperial Household Agency, structures for the guards such as the &quot;Saineikan&quot; dojo, and the Museum of the Imperial Collections.

Several structures that were added since the Meiji period were removed over time to allow construction of the East Garden. In 1932, the &quot;kuretake-ryō&quot; was built as a dormitory for imperial princesses, however this building was removed prior to the construction of the present gardens. Other buildings such as stables and housing were removed to create the East Garden in its present configuration.

Construction work began in 1961 with a new pond in the Ninomaru, as well as the repair and restoration of various keeps and structures from the Edo period. On 30 May 1963, the area was declared by the Japanese government a &quot;Special Historic Relic&quot; under the Cultural Properties Protection Law.

=== Tōkagakudō (Music Hall) ===

The is located to the east of the former main donjon of Edo Castle in the Honmaru. Designed by Kenji Imai, this music hall was built in commemoration of the 60th birthday of Empress Kōjun on 6 March 1963. The ferro-concrete building covers a total area of . The hall is octagon-shaped and each of its eight outer walls is decorated with differently designed mosaic tiles. Construction began in August 1964 and was completed in February 1966.

=== Ninomaru Garden ===
Symbolic trees representing each prefecture in Japan are planted in the northwestern corner of Ninomaru enceinte. Such trees have been donated from each prefecture and there are total of 260, covering 30 varieties.

The small Ninomaru Garden at the foot of the castle hill was originally planted in 1636 by Kobori Enshu, a famed landscape artist and garden designer, but it was destroyed by fire in 1867. The current layout was created in 1968, based on a plan drawn up during the reign of ninth shogun, Tokugawa Ieshige.

=== Suwa no Chaya ===
The is a teahouse that was located in the Fukiage Garden during the Edo period. It moved to the Akasaka Palace after the Meiji restoration, but was reconstructed in its original location in 1912.

It was moved to its present location during the construction of the East Garden.

== Kitanomaru ==
The Kitanomaru Park is located to the north and is the former northern enceinte of Edo Castle. It is a public park and is the site of Nippon Budokan Hall.

This garden contains a bronze monument to .

== Kōkyo-gaien ==

The Kokyo Gaien National Garden consists of outer gardens that ring the Imperial Palace. It contain bronze monuments to and to .

<doc id="266157" wikidata="Q323903" url="?curid=266157" title="Holon (philosophy)">
<text>A holon is something that is simultaneously a whole in and of itself, as well as a part of a larger whole. In this way, a holon can be considered a subsystem within a larger hierarchical system. 

The holon represents a way to overcome the dichotomy between parts and wholes, as well as a way to account for both the self-assertive and the integrative tendencies of organisms. Holons are sometimes discussed in the context of self-organizing holarchic open (SOHO) systems.

The word &quot;holon&quot; () is a combination of the Greek &quot;holos&quot; () meaning &#x27;whole&#x27;, with the suffix &quot;-on&quot; which denotes a particle or part (as in prot&quot;on&quot; and neutr&quot;on&quot;). Holons are self-reliant units that possess a degree of independence and can handle contingencies without asking higher authorities for instructions (i.e., they have a degree of autonomy). These holons are also simultaneously subject to control from one or more of these higher authorities. The first property ensures that holons are stable forms that are able to withstand disturbances, while the latter property signifies that they are intermediate forms, providing a context for the proper functionality for the larger whole.

==History==

The term &quot;holon&quot; was coined by Arthur Koestler in &quot;The Ghost in the Machine&quot; (1967), though Koestler first articulated the concept in &quot;The Act of Creation&quot; (1964), in which he refers to the relationship between the searches for subjective and objective knowledge:

Einstein&#x27;s space is no closer to reality than Van Gogh&#x27;s sky. The glory of science is not in a truth more absolute than the truth of Bach or Tolstoy, but in the act of creation itself. The scientist&#x27;s discoveries impose his own order on chaos, as the composer or painter imposes his; an order that always refers to limited aspects of reality, and is based on the observer&#x27;s frame of reference, which differs from period to period as a Rembrant nude differs from a nude by Manet.Koestler would finally propose the term &quot;holon&quot; in &quot;The Ghost in the Machine&quot; (1967), using it to describe natural organisms as composed of semi-autonomous sub-wholes (or, parts) that are linked in a form of hierarchy, a &quot;holarchy&quot;, to form a whole. The title of the book itself points to the notion that the entire &#x27;machine&#x27; of life and of the universe itself is ever-evolving toward more and more complex states, as if a ghost were operating the machine.

* The first observation was influenced by a story told to him by Herbert A. Simon—the &#x27;parable of the two watchmakers&#x27;—in which Simon concludes that complex systems evolve from simple systems much more rapidly when there are stable intermediate forms present in the evolutionary process compared to when they are not present.
* The second observation was made by Koestler himself in his analysis of hierarchies and stable intermediate forms in non-living matter (atomic and molecular structure), living organisms, and social organizations.

<doc id="266179" wikidata="Q276726" url="?curid=266179" title="Beer in China">
<text>Beer in China was the dominant alcoholic beverage through the Han dynasty, after which it was eclipsed by rice wine. Modern brewing appeared in the late 1800s, brought to China by Europeans who brewed pale lagers, such as Tsingtao. Both beer production and consumption of local and imported brands grew increasingly popular in the 20th century. In the 21st century, China became the world&#x27;s largest consumer of beer, commercial scale brewing expanded, and craft beer began to spread beyond expatriate communities and make inroads amongst the Chinese population.

==History==
Production and consumption of beer in China has occurred for around nine thousand years, with recent archaeological findings showing that Chinese villagers were brewing beer-type alcoholic drinks as far back as 7000 BC on small and individual scales. Made with rice, honey, grape, and hawthorn fruits, this early beer seems to have been produced similarly to that of ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. Ancient Chinese beer was important in ancestral worship, funeral and other rituals of Xia, Shang and Zhou dynasties, and the beer was called as Lao Li (醪醴 in oracle bone script). However, after the Han dynasty, Chinese beer faded from prominence in favor of huangjiu, which remained the case for the next two millennia. 

===Pale lager===
Modern beer brewing was not introduced into China until the end of 19th century, when Polish people established a brewery in Harbin, with another three following (also in Harbin), set up by Germans, Czechoslovaks and Poles respectively. Japanese also established in 1934 in Mukden Manchurian Beer, which later became Shenyang Snow Beer and then acquired in 1994 by China Resources Enterprises.

===Craft beer===
The emergence of craft beer in China started in the large metro areas including Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou. Once primarily of interest to expat drinkers, local consumer interest in premium brands and local and imported craft beers is currently on the rise. However, Chinese government regulations have been cited as an obstacle facing new breweries or those wishing to expand bottling distribution.

==Ingredients==
Chinese beers often contain rice, sorghum and sometimes rye in addition to barley. Some beer is produced that uses bitter melon instead of hops as the bittering agent.

Chinese media reported in 2001 that as many as 95% of all Chinese beers contained formaldehyde, to prevent sedimentation in bottles and cans while in storage. This practice has now been made illegal.

==Economy==
Despite the fact that estimates say between one-third to half of East Asian people, including Chinese people, have Asian flush syndrome, which influences the ability to process alcohol, China is deemed the world&#x27;s largest beer market in terms of global consumption, followed by the United States and Brazil.

Snow Beer, produced by CR Snow is the best-selling beer in China, holding 21.7% market share, having recently overtaken Tsingtao Beer, produced by Tsingtao Brewery, which is the brand most widely exported to other countries. Tsingtao Beer is brewed in the city of Qingdao (formerly spelled &quot;Tsingtao&quot; in EFEO Chinese transcription) which was a German base in the time of unequal treaties and late-colonial western influence in China. The Germans needed beer for their sailors, soldiers and traders, and production continued after they lost the city to the Japanese in World War I.

Apart from Tsingtao, other major Chinese brewing groups include China Pabst Blue Ribbon, Yanjing, Sie-Tang Lio and Zhujiang Beer. Many major international brewers now have interests in, or joint ventures with, Chinese breweries, and popular international brands such as Carlsberg are now produced in China. This gives them access to the Chinese market while providing capital and expertise to help upgrade local brewing standards, albeit at the cost of variety.

Beer is brewed in Hong Kong, which has a large brewery owned by San Miguel Corporation of the Philippines, as well as a microbrewery producing several beers for the local market.

Brewpubs are gaining popularity in China, primarily in major cities which have a resident western community, though there are a few exceptions in more remote locations like Bad Monkey Brewery in Dali Old Town, Yunnan. Shanghai Brewery, Boxing Cat Brewery, The BREW and Dr. Beer are some of the more prominent craft breweries in Shanghai. In Beijing, several craft breweries such as Great Leap Brewing, Jing-A Brewing, Panda Brew Pub, and Slow Boat Brewery have become staples in the local nightlife scene. Another popular brewpub is Kaiwei Beer House, a chain based in Wuhan. Craft beer festivals have been popularized since the early 2010s in Beijing and Shanghai. Two popular beer festivals in Shanghai, Shanghai International Beer Festival and Shanghai Beer Week, were both started in 2012.

In 2015 market share of imported beer reached 1.14% and volume increased by 58.9% to 538.5 million litres.

==Non-alcoholic beer==
There is a growing consumer inclination towards less strong beer in China as health conscious individuals are seeking wholesome and lower caloric options in their choice of beer, and consumers who want low alcohol and healthier drinks are noted to be mainly young women. According to a study by market intelligence agency Mintel, China has the highest amount of product launches of low or zero alcohol beer (below 3.5 percent ABV) in the Asia Pacific region in 2016, and over one in four (29 percent) beers launched in China in that year, were of low or non alcoholic beers. Qingdao Beers launched the first non-alcoholic beer in China in 2012 with its product, &#x27;Qingdao 0.00&#x27;, that is brewed from Czech hops and Australian barley.

Jonny Forsyth, a global drinks analyst of Mintel firm, stated &quot;..(the) research indicates that Chinese consumers, in general, prefer less strong beer in terms of ABV, compared to the global market&quot;. Consumers in china tend to gravitate towards tried and trusted brands for their purchases in low or non alcoholic beers, with big companies like Heineken and Qingdao enjoying massive support from consumers based on sales and annual profits.

<doc id="266185" wikidata="Q275982" url="?curid=266185" title="Florence Foster Jenkins">
<text>Florence Foster Jenkins (born Narcissa Florence Foster; July 19, 1868 – November 26, 1944) was an American socialite and amateur  lyric soprano who became known, and mocked, for her flamboyant performance costumes and notably poor singing ability. Stephen Pile ranked her &quot;the world&#x27;s worst opera singer... No one, before or since, has succeeded in liberating themselves quite so completely from the shackles of musical notation.&quot;

Despite – or perhaps because of – her technical incompetence, she became a prominent musical camp cult-figure in New York City during the 1920s, 1930s, and 1940s. Cole Porter, Gian Carlo Menotti, Lily Pons, Sir Thomas Beecham, and other celebrities were counted among her fans. Enrico Caruso reportedly &quot;regarded her with affection and respect&quot;.

The poet William Meredith wrote that a Jenkins recital &quot;was never exactly an aesthetic experience, or only to the degree that an early Christian among the lions provided aesthetic experience; it was chiefly immolatory, and Madame Jenkins was always eaten, in the end.&quot;

==Personal life and early career==
Narcissa Florence Foster was born July 19, 1868, in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Charles Dorrance Foster (1836–1909), an attorney and scion of a wealthy land-owning Pennsylvania family, and Mary Jane Hoagland Foster (1851–1930). Her only sibling, a younger sister named Lillian, died of diphtheria in 1883 at age eight.

Foster said her interest in public performance began when she was seven years old. A pianist, she performed at society functions as &quot;Little Miss Foster&quot;, and gave a recital at the White House during the administration of Rutherford B. Hayes. She attended the Moravian Seminary for Young Ladies in Bethlehem, PA from September 1881 to March 1882, where she was among 20 students in the &quot;Fourth Room&quot;. In December, Foster performed “Two Merry Alpine Maids”, a &quot;gay duet, with yodel and la la passages&quot;, as part of the annual Christmas service. In a little under a year at the Bethlehem Female Seminary, she paid over $100 for music instruction and sheet music (equivalent to almost $3,000 in 2023 dollars). Foster’s interest in music was further evidenced by her purchase of hymnals.

After graduating from high school, her hopes of studying music in Europe were dashed when her father refused permission and funding. On July 11, 1883, ten days after the funeral of her sister and eight days before her 15th birthday, Foster married Dr. Francis Thornton Jenkins (1852–1917), a physician 16 years her senior, in Philadelphia. (In the 1880s, the age of consent for marriage in Pennsylvania was ten.) The following year, after learning that she had contracted syphilis from her husband, she ended their relationship and reportedly never spoke of him again. Years later, she claimed to have been granted a divorce decree on March 24, 1902, although no documentation of any such ruling has been found. She retained the Jenkins surname for the remainder of her life.

After an arm injury ended her aspirations as a pianist, Jenkins gave piano lessons at her apartment in Philadelphia, &quot;The Newport&quot;, built in 1897. Around 1900 she moved with her mother to New York City. 

In 1909, in her early forties, Jenkins met a 33-year-old British actor named St. Clair Bayfield (1875–1967); they began a vaguely defined cohabitation relationship that continued the rest of her life. Upon her father&#x27;s death later that year, Jenkins became the beneficiary of a sizable trust, and resolved to resume her musical career as a singer with Bayfield as her manager. She began taking voice lessons and immersed herself in wealthy New York City society, joining dozens of social clubs. As the &quot;chairman of music&quot; for many of these organizations, she began producing lavish &quot;tableaux vivants&quot;, popular diversions in upper-crust social circles of that era. In each of these productions, Jenkins would cast herself as the main character in the final tableau, wearing an elaborate costume of her own design. In a widely republished photograph, Jenkins poses in a costume, complete with angelic wings, from her tableau inspired by Howard Chandler Christy&#x27;s painting &quot;Stephen Foster and the Angel of Inspiration&quot;.

Jenkins began giving private vocal recitals in 1912 when she was 44 years old. In 1917, she became founder and President Soprano Hostess of her own social organization, the Verdi Club. Its membership quickly swelled to over 400; honorary members included Enrico Caruso and Geraldine Farrar. When Jenkins&#x27;s mother died in 1930, additional financial resources became available for the expansion and promotion of her singing career.

==Vocal career==
According to published reviews and other contemporary accounts, Jenkins&#x27;s proficiency at the piano did not translate well to her singing. She is described as having great difficulty with such basic vocal skills as pitch, rhythm, and sustaining notes and phrases. In recordings, her accompanist Cosmé McMoon can be heard making adjustments to compensate for her constant tempo variations and rhythmic mistakes, but there was little he could do to conceal her inaccurate intonation. She was consistently flat, sometimes considerably so. Her diction was similarly substandard, particularly with foreign-language lyrics.

The difficult operatic arias that Jenkins chose to perform—all well beyond her technical ability and vocal range—served only to emphasize these deficiencies. &quot;There&#x27;s no way to even pedagogically discuss it,&quot; said vocal instructor Bill Schuman. &quot;It&#x27;s amazing that she&#x27;s even attempting to sing that music.&quot; The opera impresario , who dubbed her &quot;the anti-Callas&quot;, said, &quot;Jenkins was exquisitely bad, so bad that it added up to quite a good evening of theater ... She would stray from the original music, and do insightful and instinctual things with her voice, but in a terribly distorted way. There was no end to the horribleness ... They say Cole Porter had to bang his cane into his foot in order not to laugh out loud when she sang. She was that bad.&quot; Nevertheless, Porter rarely missed a recital.

The question of whether &quot;Lady Florence&quot;—as she liked to be called, and often signed her autographs—was in on the joke, or honestly believed she had vocal talent, remains a matter of debate. On the one hand, she compared herself favorably with renowned sopranos Frieda Hempel and Luisa Tetrazzini, and seemed oblivious to the abundant audience laughter during her performances. Her loyal friends endeavored to disguise the laughter with cheers and applause; they often described her technique to curious inquirers in &quot;intentionally ambiguous&quot; terms. For example, &quot;her singing at its finest suggests the untrammeled swoop of some great bird&quot;. Favorable articles and bland reviews, published in specialty music publications such as &quot;The Musical Courier&quot;, were most likely written by her friends or herself. &quot;I would say that she maybe didn&#x27;t know [how badly she sang],&quot; said mezzo-soprano Marilyn Horne. &quot;We can&#x27;t hear ourselves as others hear us.&quot; Nerve damage due to syphilis and its treatment (see below) may have physically compromised her hearing as well.

On the other hand, Jenkins refused to open her performances to the general public, and was clearly aware of her detractors. &quot;People may say I can&#x27;t sing,&quot; she once remarked to a friend, &quot;but no one can ever say I didn&#x27;t sing.&quot; She dismissed her original accompanist, Edwin McArthur, after catching him giving her audience &quot;a knowing smile&quot; during a performance. She went to great lengths to control access to her private recitals, which took place at her apartment, in small clubs, and each October at the Verdi Club&#x27;s annual &quot;Ball of the Silver Skylarks&quot; in the Ritz-Carlton Hotel&#x27;s Grand Ballroom. Attendance, by personal invitation only, was restricted to her loyal clubwomen and a select few others. Jenkins handled distribution of the coveted tickets herself, carefully excluding strangers, particularly music critics. &quot;There&#x27;s no way she could &quot;not&quot; have known,&quot; said Schuman. &quot;No one is that unaware ... she loved the audience reaction and she loved singing. But she knew.&quot;

Despite her careful efforts to insulate her singing from public exposure, a majority of critics favored the view that Jenkins&#x27;s self-delusion was genuine. &quot;At that time Frank Sinatra had started to sing, and the teenagers used to faint during his notes and scream,&quot; McMoon told an interviewer. &quot;So she thought she was producing the same kind of an effect.&quot; &quot;Florence didn&#x27;t think she was pulling anyone&#x27;s leg,&quot; said opera historian Albert Innaurato. &quot;She was compos mentis, not a lunatic. She was a very proper, complex individual.&quot; As an anonymous obituary writer later put it, &quot;Her ears, schooled in constant introversion, heard only the radiant tones which never issued forth to quell the mirth of her audiences.&quot;

Her recitals featured arias from the standard operatic repertoire by Mozart, Verdi, and Johann Strauss; lieder by Brahms; Valverde&#x27;s Spanish waltz &quot;Clavelitos&quot; (&quot;Little Carnations&quot;); and songs composed by herself and McMoon. As in her tableaux, she complemented her performances with elaborate costumes of her own design, often involving wings, tinsel, and flowers. She would perform &quot;Clavelitos&quot; dressed as Carmen, complete with castanets and a wicker basket of flowers, clicking the castanets and tossing the flowers one by one. When she ran out of flowers, she flung the basket too—and then the castanets. Her fans, aware that &quot;Clavelitos&quot; was her favorite song, would usually demand an encore, prompting her to send McMoon into the audience to retrieve flowers, basket, and castanets so that she could sing the number again.
Once when a taxi in which she was riding collided with another car, Jenkins let out a high-pitched scream. Upon arriving home, she went immediately to her piano and confirmed (at least to herself) that the note she had screamed was the fabled F above high C, a pitch she had never before been able to reach. Overjoyed, she refused to press charges against either involved party, and even sent the taxi driver a box of expensive cigars. McMoon said neither he &quot;nor anyone else&quot; ever heard her actually sing a high F, however.

At the age of 76, Jenkins finally yielded to public demand and booked Carnegie Hall for a general-admission performance that took place on October 25, 1944. Tickets for the event sold out weeks in advance; the demand was such that an estimated 2,000 people were turned away at the door of the 2,800-seat venue. Numerous celebrities attended, including Porter, Marge Champion, Gian Carlo Menotti, Kitty Carlisle, and Lily Pons with her husband, Andre Kostelanetz, who composed a song for the recital. McMoon later recalled a moment: &quot;[When she sang] &#x27;If my silhouette does not convince you yet / My figure surely will&#x27; [from Adele&#x27;s aria in &quot;Die Fledermaus&quot;], she put her hands righteously to her hips and went into a circular dance that was the most ludicrous thing I have ever seen. And created a pandemonium in the place. One famous actress had to be carried out of her box because she became so hysterical.&quot;

Since ticket distribution was out of Jenkins&#x27;s control for the first time, mockers, scoffers, and critics could no longer be kept at bay. The following morning&#x27;s newspapers were filled with scathing, sarcastic reviews that devastated Jenkins, according to Bayfield. &quot;[Mrs. Jenkins] has a great voice,&quot; wrote the &quot;New York Sun&quot; critic. &quot;In fact, she can sing everything except notes ... Much of her singing was hopelessly lacking in a semblance of pitch, but the further a note was from its proper elevation the more the audience laughed and applauded.&quot; The &quot;New York Post&quot; was even less charitable: &quot;Lady Florence ... indulged last night in one of the weirdest mass jokes New York has ever seen.&quot;

Five days after the concert, Jenkins suffered a heart attack while shopping at G. Schirmer&#x27;s music store, and died a month later on November 26, 1944, at her Manhattan residence, the Hotel Seymour. She was buried next to her father in the Foster mausoleum, Hollenback Cemetery, Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania.

===Possible influence of health problems===
Some of Jenkins&#x27;s performance difficulties have been attributed to untreated syphilis, which causes progressive deterioration of the central nervous system in its tertiary stage. Nerve damage and other morbidities caused by the disease may have been compounded by toxic side effects—such as hearing loss—from mercury and arsenic, the prevailing (and largely ineffective) remedies of the pre-antibiotic era. By the time penicillin became generally available in the 1940s, Jenkins&#x27;s disease had progressed to the tertiary stage, which is unresponsive to antibiotics.

==Recordings==

===Audio===
The only professional audio recordings of Jenkins consist of nine selections on five 78-rpm records (Melotone Recording Studio, New York City, 1941–1944), produced by Jenkins, at her expense, and sold to her friends at $2.50 a copy. The selections include four coloratura arias from operas by Mozart, Delibes, Johann Strauss II, and Félicien David, and five art songs, two written for Jenkins by her accompanist, Cosmé McMoon. Seven of the selections were released on RCA Victor LRT-7000, a 10-inch LP in 1954, and reissued on RCA Victor LM-2597, a 12-inch LP in 1962, &quot;The Glory () of the Human Voice&quot; (includes the non-Jenkins recording of &quot;A Faust Travesty&quot; by Jenny Williams and Thomas Burns).

===Film===
Jenkins commissioned filming of her performances at the Verdi Club&#x27;s signature annual event, the &quot;Ball of the Silver Skylarks&quot;, held each October at the Ritz Carlton Hotel. All were thought lost until copies of the 1934 through 1939 and 1941 films were discovered in 2009. Jenkins historian Donald Collup presented excerpts from the films in a 2016 YouTube video and announced plans to produce a documentary, which had not been released.

<doc id="266197" wikidata="Q862148" url="?curid=266197" title="Minnesota Star Tribune">
<text>The Minnesota Star Tribune, formerly the Minneapolis Star Tribune, is an American daily newspaper based in Minneapolis, Minnesota. As of 2023, it is Minnesota&#x27;s largest newspaper and the seventh-largest in the United States by circulation, and is distributed throughout the Minneapolis–Saint Paul metropolitan area, the state, and the Upper Midwest.

It originated as the &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; in 1867 and the competing &quot;Minneapolis Daily Star&quot; in 1920. During the 1930s and 1940s, the two papers consolidated, with the &quot;Tribune&quot; published in the morning and the &quot;Star&quot; in the evening. They merged in 1982, creating the &quot;Minneapolis Star and Tribune&quot;, renamed the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; in 1987. After a tumultuous period in which the newspaper was sold and resold and filed for bankruptcy protection in 2009, it was purchased by local billionaire and former Minnesota State Senator Glen Taylor in 2014. In 2024, the paper was renamed &quot;The Minnesota Star Tribune&quot;.

The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; typically contains national, international, and local news, sports, business, and lifestyle stories. Journalists from the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; and its predecessor newspapers have won seven Pulitzer Prizes.

==History==
===&quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot;===
The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; roots date to the creation of the &quot;Minneapolis Daily Tribune&quot; by Colonel William S. King, William D. Washburn, and Dorilus Morrison. The two men previously operated different Minneapolis newspapers, the State Atlas and the Minneapolis Daily Chronicle. The newspaper was designed to unify the local Republican Party under one newspaper. The &quot;Tribune&quot; first issue was published on May 25, 1867. The newspaper went through several different editors and publishers during its first two decades, including John T. Gilman, George K. Shaw, Albert Shaw, and Alden J. Blethen. In 1878, the &quot;Minneapolis Evening Journal&quot; began publication, giving the &quot;Tribune&quot; its first competition. On November 30, 1889, downtown Minneapolis&#x27;s &quot;Tribune&quot; headquarters caught fire. Seven people were killed and 30 injured, and the building and presses were a total loss.

In 1891, the &quot;Tribune&quot; was purchased by Gilbert A. Pierce and William J. Murphy for $450,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Pierce quickly sold his share to Thomas Lowry, and Lowry sold it to Murphy, making Murphy the newspaper&#x27;s sole owner. His business and legal background helped him structure the &quot;Tribune&quot; debt and modernize its printing equipment. The newspaper experimented with partial-color printing and the use of halftone for photographs and portraits. In 1893, Murphy sent the &quot;Tribune&quot; first correspondent to Washington, D.C. As Minneapolis grew, the newspaper&#x27;s circulation expanded; the &quot;Tribune&quot; and the &quot;Evening Journal&quot; were closely competitive, with the smaller &quot;Minneapolis Times&quot; in third place. In 1905, Murphy bought out the &quot;Times&quot; and merged it with the &quot;Tribune&quot;.

He died in 1918, endowing a school of journalism at the University of Minnesota. After a brief transitional period, Murphy&#x27;s younger brother Frederick E. Murphy became the &quot;Tribune&quot; publisher in 1921.

===&quot;Minneapolis Daily Star&quot;===
The other half of the newspaper&#x27;s history begins with the &quot;Minnesota Daily Star&quot;, which was founded on August 19, 1920, by elements of the agrarian Nonpartisan League and backed by Thomas Van Lear and Herbert Gaston. The &quot;Daily Star&quot; had difficulty attracting advertisers with its overtly political agenda and went bankrupt in 1924. After its purchase by A. B. Frizzell and former &quot;New York Times&quot; executive John Thompson, the newspaper became the politically independent &quot;Minneapolis Daily Star&quot;.

===Cowles era===
In 1935, the Cowles family of Des Moines, Iowa purchased the &quot;Star&quot;. The family patriarch, Gardner Cowles Sr., had purchased &quot;The Des Moines Register&quot; and the &quot;Des Moines Tribune&quot; during the first decade of the century and managed them successfully. Gardner&#x27;s son, John Cowles Sr., moved to Minneapolis to manage the &quot;Star&quot;. Under him, it had the city&#x27;s highest circulation, pressuring Minneapolis&#x27;s other newspapers. In 1939, the Cowles family purchased the &quot;Minneapolis Evening Journal&quot;, merging the two newspapers into the &quot;Star-Journal&quot;. &quot;Tribune&quot; publisher Fred Murphy died in 1940; the next year, the Cowles family bought the &quot;Tribune&quot; and merged it with their company, giving it ownership of the city&#x27;s major newspapers. The &quot;Tribune&quot; became the city&#x27;s morning newspaper, the &quot;Star-Journal&quot; (renamed the &quot;Star&quot; in 1947) was the evening newspaper, and they published a joint Sunday edition. A separate evening newspaper (the &quot;Times&quot;) was spun off and published separately until 1948.

In 1944, John Cowles Sr. hired Wisconsin native and former &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot; editor William P. Steven as managing editor of the two newspapers; Steven became vice president and executive editor in 1954. During his tenure in Minneapolis, he was president of the Associated Press Managing Editors Association in 1949 and first chairman of the organization&#x27;s Continuing Study Committee. By August 1960, John Cowles Jr. was vice president and associate editor of the two papers, and it was soon apparent that he disapproved of Steven&#x27;s hard-nosed approach to journalism. When Steven chafed under the younger Cowles&#x27;s management, he was fired.

After Steven&#x27;s ouster, Cowles Jr. was editor of the two newspapers; he became president in 1968 and editorial chairman the following year. He had a progressive political viewpoint, publishing editorials supporting the civil rights movement and liberal causes.

In 1982, the afternoon &quot;Star&quot; was discontinued due to dwindling circulation, a trend common for afternoon newspapers. The two papers merged into a single morning paper, the &quot;Minneapolis Star and Tribune&quot;. Cowles Jr. fired publisher Donald R. Dwight. His handling of Dwight&#x27;s termination led to his removal as editor in 1983, although his family retained a controlling financial interest in the newspaper.

In 1983, the &quot;Star and Tribune&quot; challenged a Minnesota tax on paper and ink before the Supreme Court of the United States. In &quot;Minneapolis Star Tribune Co. v. Commissioner&quot;, the court found that the tax (which targeted specific newspapers) violated the First Amendment. In 1987, the newspaper&#x27;s name was simplified to &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, and the slogan &quot;Newspaper of the Twin Cities&quot; was added.

===1998 to present===
In 1998, the McClatchy Company purchased Cowles Media Company for $1.4 billion, ending the newspaper&#x27;s 61-year history in the family in one of the largest sales in American newspaper history. Although McClatchy sold many of Cowles&#x27;s smaller assets, it kept the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; for several years. On December 26, 2006, McClatchy sold the paper to private equity firm Avista Capital Partners for $530 million, less than half of what it had paid for Cowles eight years earlier.

In March 2007, Par Ridder was appointed &quot;Star Tribune&quot; publisher after his predecessor, J. Keith Moyer, left the newspaper after the sale. Ridder is a member of the Ridder family, which had owned Knight Ridder (publishers of several newspapers, including at that time the rival &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot;). Ridder&#x27;s arrival resulted in litigation when it was discovered that he had stolen a hard drive containing information about employees and advertisers, which the &quot;Pioneer Press&quot; called &quot;trade secrets&quot;. Ridder also took two high-ranking staff members to the Minneapolis paper, which raised eyebrows since such employees usually have non-compete clauses in their contracts. On September 18, 2007, Ridder was removed from his post by a Ramsey County judge, and he resigned on December 7.

On January 15, 2009, the paper, then the country&#x27;s 15th-largest daily, filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. On September 17, the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York approved a bankruptcy plan for the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, which emerged from bankruptcy protection on September 28. The paper&#x27;s senior secured lenders received about 95% of the post-bankruptcy company.

Since 2010, the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; has given out awards to the &quot;Top 150 Workplaces in Minnesota&quot;.

Since the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; bankruptcy, its former ownership group, led by New York City–based Avista Capital Partners, has no stake in the company.

Wayzata Investment Partners became majority owner of the Star Tribune Company in August 2012, with a 58% stake. In 2014, the company was acquired by Glen Taylor, owner of the NBA&#x27;s Minnesota Timberwolves and the WNBA&#x27;s Minnesota Lynx. A former Republican state senator, Taylor said the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; would be less liberal under his ownership. He also said the paper had already begun a shift and would focus on accurately reporting both sides of all issues. In May 2015, the company acquired alternative weekly &quot;City Pages&quot; from Voice Media Group. &quot;City Pages&quot; continued publishing until it became another victim of advertising revenue loss and the COVID-19 pandemic. It shuttered in October 2020, and the website was moved to the Hennepin County Library&#x27;s archives.

==Editions==
After the 1987 formation of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot;, the newspaper was published in three editions: one for Minneapolis and the western suburbs, one for St. Paul and the eastern suburbs, and a state edition for Minnesota and the Midwest. The St. Paul edition was discontinued in 1999 in favor of a metro edition for the Minneapolis–St. Paul area and a state edition for areas beyond the metropolitan area.

Although the newspaper competes with the St. Paul–based &quot;Pioneer Press&quot; in the Minneapolis–St. Paul area, the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; is more popular in the western metropolitan area, and the &quot;Pioneer Press&quot; is more popular in the eastern metro area. The newspapers share some printing and delivery operations.

The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; went online in 1995, introducing the StarTribune.com website the following year. In 2011, the website erected a paywall.

==Departments==
The &quot;Star Tribune&quot; has five main sections: main news, local news, sports, business, and variety (lifestyle and entertainment). Special weekly sections include Taste (restaurants and cooking), travel, Outdoors Weekend, and Science + Health. The Sunday edition has a more prominent editorial and opinion section, Opinion Exchange.

==Awards==
Journalists with the pre-merger &quot;Minneapolis Star&quot; and &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot; won three Pulitzer Prizes:
* 1948: Nat S. Finney (&quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot;), National Reporting
* 1959: William Seaman (&quot;Minneapolis Star&quot;), Photography
* 1968: Nathan K. (Nick) Kotz (&quot;Des Moines Register&quot; and &quot;Minneapolis Tribune&quot;), National Reporting

&quot;Star Tribune&quot; journalists have won three Pulitzers:
* 1990: Lou Kilzer and Chris Ison, Investigative Reporting
* 2013: Steve Sack, Editorial Cartooning
* 2013: Brad Schrade, Jeremy Olson and Glenn Howatt, Local Reporting

In 2021, the staff of the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; won the Pulitzer prize for breaking news coverage for the &quot;urgent, authoritative and nuanced&quot; coverage of the murder of George Floyd.

==Staff and management==
Columnists affiliated with the &quot;Star Tribune&quot; include:

In April 2023, Steve Grove became the new publisher after Michael Klingensmith stepped down. Grove was the head of the Minnesota Department of Employment and Economic Development under Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. He formerly worked as a reporter and a Google executive, leading the Google News Lab. Klingensmith had served as publisher since 2010.

==Headquarters and printing plant==
After the Cowles family consolidated the city&#x27;s newspapers, their offices were gradually moved to the former the &quot;Daily Star&quot; headquarters in downtown Minneapolis. The building was renovated from 1939 to 1940 and expanded in a larger renovation from 1946 to 1949. After 1949, the building housed the offices and presses of the &quot;Star&quot; and the &quot;Tribune.&quot; During the 1980s, an annex, the Freeman Building, was built across the street from the headquarters and connected with a skyway. In 1987, the Star Tribune opened a new, $110 million printing plant, called the Heritage Center, in a historic warehouse district on the northern edge of downtown Minneapolis. Its five offset presses took over printing all &quot;Star Tribune&quot; editions. News and business offices remained in the downtown headquarters, whose old presses were removed.

In 2014, the company announced that it would relocate from the 95-year-old headquarters building to the newly christened Star Tribune Building at the Capella Tower complex, making way for development around nearby U.S. Bank Stadium. Demolition of the buildings began in 2014; the last employees relocated in mid-2015, and the demolition was completed later that year. Also in 2014, the Star Tribune&#x27;s Heritage printing plant began printing the &quot;St. Paul Pioneer Press&quot; under a contract with its cross-town rival. The following year, &quot;USA Today&quot; contracted with the Star Tribune to print regional copies of its daily edition at the Heritage plant. Printing plants owned by those newspaper companies in St. Paul and Maple Grove, Minn., shut down.

<doc id="266204" wikidata="Q765270" url="?curid=266204" title="Generic trademark">
<text>A generic trademark, also known as a genericized trademark or proprietary eponym, is a trademark or brand name that, because of its popularity or significance, has become the generic term for, or synonymous with, a general class of products or services, usually against the intentions of the trademark&#x27;s owner.

A trademark is prone to genericization, or &quot;genericide&quot;, when a brand name acquires substantial market dominance or mind share, becoming so widely used for similar products or services that it is no longer associated with the trademark owner, e.g., linoleum, bubble wrap, thermos, and aspirin. A trademark thus popularized is at risk of being challenged or revoked, unless the trademark owner works sufficiently to correct and prevent such broad use.

Trademark owners can inadvertently contribute to genericization by failing to provide an alternative generic name for their product or service or using the trademark in similar fashion to generic terms. In one example, the Otis Elevator Company&#x27;s trademark of the word &quot;escalator&quot; was cancelled following a petition from Toledo-based Haughton Elevator Company. In rejecting an appeal from Otis, an examiner from the United States Patent and Trademark Office cited the company&#x27;s own use of the term &quot;escalator&quot; alongside the generic term &quot;elevator&quot; in multiple advertisements without any trademark significance. Therefore, trademark owners go to extensive lengths to avoid genericization and trademark erosion.

== In subpopulations ==
Genericization may be specific to certain professions and other subpopulations. For example, Luer-Lok (Luer lock), Phoroptor (phoropter), and Port-a-Cath (portacath) have genericized mind share among physicians due to a lack of alternative names in common use: as a result, consumers may not realize that the term is a brand name rather than a medical eponym or generic term.

== In pharmaceuticals ==

Pharmaceutical trade names are somewhat protected from genericization due to the modern practice of assigning nonproprietary names based on a drug&#x27;s chemical structure. This circumvents the problem of a trademarked name entering common use by providing a generic name as soon as a novel pharmaceutical enters the market. For example, aripiprazole, the nonproprietary name for Abilify, was well-documented since its invention. Warfarin, originally introduced as a rat poison, was approved for human use under the brand name Coumadin.

Examples of genericization before the modern system of generic drugs include aspirin, introduced to the market in 1897, and heroin, introduced in 1898. Both were originally trademarks of Bayer AG. However, U.S. court rulings in 1918 and 1921 found the terms to be genericized, stating the company&#x27;s failure to reinforce the brand&#x27;s connection with their product as the reason.

A different sense of the word &quot;genericized&quot; in the pharmaceutical industry refers to products whose patent protection has expired. For example, Lipitor was genericized in the U.S. when the first competing generic version was approved by the FDA in November 2011. In this same context, the term &quot;genericization&quot; refers to the process of a brand drug losing market exclusivity to generics.

== Trademark erosion ==
Trademark erosion, or genericization, is a special case of antonomasia related to trademarks. It happens when a trademark becomes so common that it starts being used as a common name &quot;and&quot; the original company has failed to prevent such use. Once it has become an appellative, the word cannot be registered any more; this is why companies try hard not to let their trademark become too common, a phenomenon that could otherwise be considered a successful move since it would mean that the company gained an exceptional recognition. An example of trademark erosion is the verb &quot;to hoover&quot; (used with the meaning of &quot;vacuum cleaning&quot;), which originated from the Hoover company brand name.

Nintendo is an example of a brand that successfully fought trademark erosion, having managed to replace excessive use of its name with the term &quot;game console&quot;, at that time a neologism.

== Legal concepts ==
Whether or not a mark is popularly identified as genericized, the owner of the mark may still be able to enforce the proprietary rights that attach to the use or registration of the mark, as long as the mark continues to exclusively identify the owner as the commercial origin of the applicable products or services. If the mark does not perform this essential function and it is no longer possible to legally enforce rights in relation to the mark, the mark may have become generic. In many legal systems (e.g., in the United States but not in Germany) a generic mark forms part of the public domain and can be commercially exploited by anyone. Nevertheless, there exists the possibility of a trademark becoming a revocable generic term in German (and European) trademark law.

The process by which trademark rights are diminished or lost as a result of common use in the marketplace is known as &quot;genericization&quot;. This process typically occurs over a period of time in which a mark is not used as a trademark (i.e., where it is not used to exclusively identify the products or services of a particular business), where a mark falls into disuse entirely, or where the trademark owner does not enforce its rights through actions for passing off or trademark infringement.

One risk factor that may lead to genericization is the use of a trademark as a verb, plural or possessive, unless the mark itself is possessive or plural (e.g., &quot;Friendly&#x27;s&quot; restaurants).

However, in highly inflected languages, a tradename may have to carry case endings in usage. An example is Finnish, where &quot;&quot;Microsoftin&quot; is the genitive case and &quot;Facebookista&quot;&quot; is the elative case.

=== Avoiding genericization ===
Generic use of a trademark presents an inherent risk to the effective enforcement of trademark rights and may ultimately lead to genericization.

Trademark owners may take various steps to reduce the risk, including educating businesses and consumers on appropriate trademark use, avoiding use of their marks in a generic manner, and systematically and effectively enforcing their trademark rights. If a trademark is associated with a new invention, the trademark owner may also consider developing a generic term for the product to be used in descriptive contexts, to avoid inappropriate use of the &quot;house&quot; mark. Such a term is called a &quot;generic descriptor&quot; and is frequently used immediately after the trademark to provide a description of the product or service. For example, &quot;Kleenex tissues&quot; (&quot;facial tissues&quot; being the generic descriptor) or &quot;Velcro-brand fasteners&quot; for Velcro brand name hook-and-loop fasteners.

Another common practice among trademark owners is to follow their trademark with the word &quot;brand&quot; to help define the word as a trademark. Johnson &amp; Johnson changed the lyrics of their Band-Aid television commercial jingle from, &quot;I am stuck on Band-Aids, &#x27;cause Band-Aid&#x27;s stuck on me&quot; to &quot;I am stuck on Band-Aid &quot;brand&quot;, &#x27;cause Band-Aid&#x27;s stuck on me.&quot; Google has gone to lengths to prevent this process, discouraging publications from using the term &#x27;googling&#x27; in reference to Web searches. In 2006, both the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; and the &quot;Merriam Webster Collegiate Dictionary&quot; struck a balance between acknowledging widespread use of the verb coinage and preserving the particular search engine&#x27;s association with the coinage, defining &quot;google&quot; (all lower case, with -&quot;le&quot; ending) as a verb meaning &quot;use the Google search engine to obtain information on the Internet&quot;. The Swedish Language Council received a complaint from Google for its inclusion of (meaning &#x27;ungoogleable&#x27;) on its list of new Swedish words from 2012. The Language Council chose to remove the word to avoid a legal process, but in return wrote that &quot;[w]e decide together which words should be and how they are defined, used and spelled&quot;.

Where a trademark is used generically, a trademark owner may need to take aggressive measures to retain exclusive rights to the trademark. Xerox Corporation attempted to prevent the genericization of its core trademark through an extensive public relations campaign advising consumers to &quot;photocopy&quot; instead of &quot;xerox&quot; documents.

The Lego Company has worked to prevent the genericization of its plastic building blocks following the expiration of Lego&#x27;s last major patents in 1978. Lego manuals and catalogs throughout the 1980s included a message imploring customers to preserve the brand name by &quot;referring to [their] bricks as &#x27;LEGO Bricks or Toys&#x27;, and not just &#x27;LEGOS&#x27;.&quot; In the early 2000s, the company acquired the Legos.com URL in order to redirect customers to the Lego.com website and deliver a similar message. Despite these efforts, many children and adults in the United States continue to use &quot;Legos&quot; as the plural form of &quot;Lego,&quot; but competing and interchangeable products, such as those manufactured by Mega Brands, are often referred to simply as building blocks or construction blocks. The company has successfully put legal pressure on the Swedish Academy and the Institute for Language and Folklore to remove the noun from their dictionaries.

Adobe Inc. has experienced mixed success with preventing the genericization of their trademarked software, Adobe Photoshop. This is shown via recurring use of &quot;photoshop&quot; as a noun, verb, or general adjective for all photo manipulation throughout the Internet and mass media.

== Protected designation of origin ==
Since 2003, the European Union has actively sought to restrict the use of geographical indications by third parties outside the EU by enforcing laws regarding &quot;protected designation of origin&quot;. Although a geographical indication for specialty food or drink may be generic, it is not a trademark because it does not serve to identify exclusively a specific commercial enterprise and therefore cannot constitute a genericized trademark.

The extension of protection for geographical indications is somewhat controversial. A geographical indication may have been registered as a trademark elsewhere; for example, if &quot;Parma Ham&quot; was part of a trademark registered in Canada by a Canadian manufacturer, then ham manufacturers in Parma, Italy, might be unable to use this name in Canada. Wines (such as Bordeaux, Port and Champagne), cheeses (such as Roquefort, Parmesan, Gouda, and Feta), Pisco liquor, and Scotch whisky are examples of geographical indications. Compare Russian use of &quot;Шампанское&quot; (= Shampanskoye) for champagne-type wine made in Russia.

In the 1990s, the Parma consortium successfully sued the Asda supermarket chain to prevent it using the description &quot;Parma ham&quot; on prosciutto produced in Parma but sliced outside the Parma region. The European Court ruled that pre-packaged ham must be produced, sliced, and packaged in Parma in order to be labeled for sale as &quot;Parma ham&quot;.

== Scale of distinctiveness ==

A trademark is said to fall somewhere along a scale from being &quot;distinctive&quot; to &quot;generic&quot; (used primarily as a common name for the product or service rather than an indication of source). Among distinctive trademarks the scale goes from strong to weak:
; &quot;Fanciful&quot; or &quot;coined&quot;
: original words with no meaning as to the nature of the product
; &quot;Arbitrary&quot; 
: existing words with little if any reference to the nature of the product or service
; &quot;Suggestive&quot;
: having primarily trademark significance but with suggestion as to the nature of the product
; &quot;Descriptive&quot;
: not just suggesting, but actually describing the product or service yet still understood as indicating source
; &quot;Merely descriptive&quot;
: having almost entirely reference to the product or service but capable of becoming &quot;distinctive&quot;.

<text>Targa Tasmania is a tarmac-based rally event held on the island state of Tasmania, Australia, annually since 1992. The event takes its name from the Targa Florio, a former motoring event held on the island of Sicily. The competition concept is drawn directly from the best features of the Mille Miglia, the Coupe des Alpes and the Tour de Corse.

==History==
The inaugural event was held in April and May 1992 with a field of over 200 cars.

After three competitors died in 2021 and another in 2022, Motorsport Australia revoked the event&#x27;s licence.

It is scheduled to resume in November 2025 with an amended course from Hobart to Launceston.

==Rally format==
The rally started as a five-day event, but has been run as a six-day event for anniversaries in 2001, 2006 and 2016.

The layout of the 2016 event was:

* Leg 1 Launceston - George Town - Launceston
* Leg 2 Launceston - St Helens - Launceston
* Leg 3 Launceston - Sheffield - Launceston
* Leg 4 Launceston - Stanley - Strahan
* Leg 5 Strahan - New Norfolk - Hobart
* Leg 6 Hobart - Hobart

In 2008 the course was substantially revised, a number of well liked stages from previous years are now used (Riana), and a number of all new stages were introduced (Mount Claude and Rossarden). Leg 3 was dropped by shortening the Leg 2 East Coast day ending back in Launceston (rather than Hobart). Leg 3 is another loop north out of Launceston (running through Devonport on this day). Leg 4 later ran from Launceston through the lunch stop at Burnie to the evening end at Strahan. It was the longest tarmac rally in Australia with no repeated stages. Although a couple of stages will share the same piece of road in opposite directions on consecutive days.

The Targa is one of several Tarmac Rally events to be held in Australia. It also has had international connections with Targa New Zealand and Targa Newfoundland which have evolved since the inception of Targa Tasmania.

==List of past winners==
In 2016 the premier category changed from Modern to Showroom GT2.

===Showroom GT4 Competition===
===Showroom GT2 Competition===
===Modern Competition===
===Classic Competition===
==Trophies Awarded==
A Targa Trophy is awarded to the driver and co-driver/navigator of each crew that completes all stages within the specified time for their class of vehicle. In subsequent years, the trophy may be upgraded as follows:

* Golden Targa Trophy - 3 consecutive regular trophies
* Platinum Targa Trophy - having achieved &quot;Gold&quot; then gaining another 3 consecutive regular trophies
* Diamond Targa Trophy - having achieved &quot;Platinum&quot; then gaining another 3 consecutive regular trophies
* Gold Diamond Targa Trophy - having achieved &quot;Diamond&quot; then gaining another 3 consecutive regular trophies
* Platinum Diamond Targa Trophy - having achieved &quot;Gold Diamond&quot; then gaining another 3 consecutive regular trophies

Once achieving &quot;Platinum Gold&quot;, the competitor is inducted into the Targa Hall of Fame Legends

In 2019, Geoff Taylor (aged 73+) was the only competitor to have competed in all events. 

In addition, each year the Denny Hulme Memorial Trophy is awarded to the competitor who exhibits tenacity to overcome adversity while completing the event. It was first awarded in 1993.

==Notable competitors==
Notable past and current competitors have included Andrew Miedecke, Barry Sheene, Bob Wollek, Denny Hulme, Dick Johnson, Glenn Ridge, Greg Crick, Gregg Hansford, Jack Brabham, Jim Richards, Jochen Mass, Steven Richards, Michael Doohan, Murray Walker, Neal Bates, Peter Brock, Peter Fitzgerald, Roger Clark, Rusty French, Sandro Munari, Stirling Moss, Alister McRae, Walter Röhrl and Eric Bana. The first person with a spinal cord injury to compete in the rally was Australian wheelchair rugby player Nazim Erdem.

<doc id="266209" wikidata="Q641589" url="?curid=266209" title="Governor-General of India">
<text>The Governor-General of India (1833 to 1950, from 1858 to 1947 the Viceroy and Governor-General of India, commonly shortened to Viceroy of India) was the representative of the monarch of the United Kingdom in their capacity as the emperor or empress of India and after Indian independence in 1947, the representative of the monarch of India. The office was created in 1773, with the title of governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William. The officer had direct control only over his presidency but supervised other East India Company officials in India. Complete authority over all of British territory in the Indian subcontinent was granted in 1833, and the official came to be known as the governor-general of India.

In 1858, because of the Indian Rebellion the previous year, the territories and assets of the East India Company came under the direct control of the British Crown; as a consequence, company rule in India was succeeded by the British Raj. The governor-general (now also the Viceroy) headed the central government of India, which administered the provinces of British India, including Bengal, Bombay, Madras, Punjab, the United Provinces, and others. However, much of India was not ruled directly by the British Government; outside the provinces of British India, there were hundreds of nominally independent princely states or &quot;native states&quot;, whose relationship was not with the British Government or the United Kingdom, but rather one of homage directly with the British monarch as sovereign successor to the Mughal emperors. From 1858, to reflect the governor-general&#x27;s new additional role as the monarch&#x27;s representative in response to the fealty relationships vis the princely states, the additional title of viceroy was granted, such that the new office was entitled &quot;Viceroy and Governor-General of India&quot;. This was usually shortened to &quot;Viceroy of India&quot;.

The title of viceroy was abandoned when British India was partitioned into the two independent dominions of India and Pakistan, but the office of governor-general continued to exist in each country separately until they adopted republican constitutions in 1950 and 1956, respectively.

Until 1858, the governor-general was selected by the Court of Directors of the East India Company, to whom he was responsible. Thereafter, he was appointed by the sovereign on the advice of the British Government; the Secretary of State for India, a member of the British Cabinet, was responsible for instructing him on the exercise of their powers. After 1947, the sovereign continued to appoint the governor-general but thereafter did so on the advice of the government of the newly independent Dominion of India.

The governor-general served at the pleasure of the sovereign, though the practice was to have them serve five-year terms. A governor-general could have their commission rescinded; and if one was removed, or left, a provisional governor-general was sometimes appointed until a new holder of the office could be chosen. The first governor-general in India (of Bengal) was Warren Hastings, the first official governor-general of British India was Lord William Bentinck, and the first governor-general of the Dominion of India was Lord Mountbatten.

==History==

Many parts of the Indian subcontinent were governed by the British East India Company (founded in 1600), which nominally acted as the agent of the Mughal emperor. Early British administrators were presidents or governors of Bengal Presidency. In 1773, motivated by corruption in the company, the British government assumed partial control over the governance of India with the passage of the Regulating Act 1773. A governor-general and Supreme Council of Bengal were appointed to rule over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal. The first governor-general and Council were named in the Act.

The Charter Act 1833 replaced the governor-general and Council of Fort William with the governor-general and Council of India. The power to elect the governor-general was retained by the Court of Directors, but the choice became subject to the sovereign&#x27;s approval via the India Board.

After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British East India Company&#x27;s territories in India were put under the direct control of the sovereign. The Government of India Act 1858 vested the power to appoint the governor-general in the sovereign. The governor-general, in turn, had the power to appoint all lieutenant governors in India, subject to the sovereign&#x27;s approval.

India and Pakistan acquired independence in 1947, but governors-general continued to be appointed over each nation until republican constitutions were written. Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, remained governor-general of India for ten months after independence, but the two nations were otherwise headed by native governors-general. India became a secular republic in 1950; Pakistan became an Islamic one in 1956.

==Functions==

The governor-general originally had power only over the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal. The Regulating Act, however, granted the governor-general additional powers relating to foreign affairs and defence. The other presidencies of the East India Company (Madras, Bombay and Bencoolen) were not allowed to declare war on or make peace with an Indian prince without receiving the prior approval of the governor-general and Council of Fort William.

The powers of the governor-general, in respect of foreign affairs, were increased by the India Act 1784. The act provided that the other governors under the East India Company could not declare war, make peace or conclude a treaty with an Indian prince unless expressly directed to do so by the governor-general or by the company&#x27;s Court of Directors.

While the governor-general thus became the controller of foreign policy in India, he was not the explicit head of British India. That status came only with the Charter Act 1833, which granted him &quot;superintendence, direction and control of the whole civil and military Government&quot; of all of British India. The act also granted legislative powers to the governor-general and council.

In 1835, Lord William Bentinck became the first governor general of India.

After 1858, the governor-general (now usually known as the viceroy) functioned as the chief administrator of India and as the sovereign&#x27;s representative. India was divided into numerous provinces, each under the head of a governor, lieutenant governor or chief commissioner or administrator. Governors were appointed by the British government, to whom they were directly responsible; lieutenant governors, chief commissioners, and administrators, however, were appointed by and were subordinate to the viceroy. The viceroy also oversaw the most powerful princely rulers: the Nizam of Hyderabad, the Maharaja of Mysore, the Maharaja (Scindia) of Gwalior, the Maharaja of Jammu and Kashmir and the Gaekwad (Gaekwar) Maharaja of Baroda. The remaining princely rulers were overseen either by the Rajputana Agency and Central India Agency, which were headed by representatives of the viceroy or by provincial authorities.

The Chamber of Princes was an institution established in 1920 by a royal proclamation of King-Emperor George V to provide a forum in which the princely rulers could voice their needs and aspirations to the government. The chamber usually met only once a year, with the viceroy presiding, but it appointed a standing committee, which met more often.

Upon independence in August 1947, the title of viceroy was abolished. The representative of India&#x27;s sovereign, King George VI, became known once again as the governor-general. In 1948, C. Rajagopalachari became the only Indian governor-general. The governor-general&#x27;s role was almost entirely ceremonial, with power being exercised on a day-to-day basis by the Indian cabinet. After the nation became a republic in 1950, the president of India continued to perform the same functions.

==Council==
The governor-general was always advised by a Council on the exercise of his legislative and executive powers. The governor-general, while exercising many functions, was referred to as the &quot;Governor-General in Council.&quot;

The Regulating Act 1773 provided for the election of four counsellors by the East India Company&#x27;s Court of Directors. The governor-general was to be assisted by an executive council of four members and was given a casting vote but no veto. The decision of the council was binding on the governor-general.

In 1784, the council was reduced to three members; the governor-general continued to have both an ordinary vote and a casting vote. In 1786, the power of the governor-general was increased even further, as Council decisions ceased to be binding.

The Charter Act 1833 made further changes to the structure of the council. The Act was the first law to distinguish between the executive and legislative responsibilities of the governor-general. As provided under the Act, there were to be four members of the Council appointed by the Court of Directors. The first three members were permitted to participate on all occasions, but the fourth member was only allowed to sit and vote when legislation was being debated.

In 1858, the Court of Directors ceased to have the power to appoint members of the council. Instead, the one member who had a vote only on legislative questions came to be appointed by the sovereign, and the other three members by the secretary of state for India.

The Indian Councils Act 1861 made several changes to the council&#x27;s composition. Three members were to be appointed by the Secretary of State for India, and two by the Sovereign. The power to appoint all five members passed to the Crown in 1869. The viceroy was empowered to appoint an additional &#x27;six to twelve&#x27; members (changed to &#x27;ten to sixteen&#x27; in 1892, and to &#x27;sixty&#x27; in 1909). The five individuals appointed by the sovereign or the Indian secretary headed the executive departments, while those appointed by the viceroy debated and voted on legislation.

In 1919, an Indian legislature, consisting of a Council of State and a Legislative Assembly, took over the legislative functions of the Viceroy&#x27;s Council. The viceroy nonetheless retained significant power over legislation. He could authorise the expenditure of money without the Legislature&#x27;s consent for &quot;ecclesiastical, political [and] defence&quot; purposes, and for any purpose during &quot;emergencies.&quot; He was permitted to veto, or even stop debate on, any bill. If he recommended the passage of a bill, but only one chamber cooperated, he could declare the bill passed over the objections of the other chamber. The legislature had no authority over foreign affairs and defence. The president of the Council of State was appointed by the viceroy; the Legislative Assembly elected its president, but the election required the viceroy&#x27;s approval.

==Style and title==
Until 1833, the title of the position was &quot;governor-general of the Presidency of Fort William in Bengal&quot;. The Government of India Act 1833 converted the title into &quot;governor-general of India&quot;, effective from 22 April 1834. The title &quot;viceroy and governor-general&quot; was first used in the queen&#x27;s proclamation appointing Viscount Canning in 1858. It was never conferred by an act of parliament but was used in warrants of precedence and in the statutes of knightly orders. In usage, &quot;viceroy&quot; is employed where the governor-general&#x27;s position as the monarch&#x27;s representative is in view. The viceregal title was not used when the sovereign was present in India. It was meant to indicate new responsibilities, especially ritualistic ones, but it conferred no new statutory authority. The governor-general regularly used the title in communications with the Imperial Legislative Council, but all legislation was made only in the name of the Governor-General-in-Council (or the Government of India).

The governor-general was styled &quot;Excellency&quot; and enjoyed precedence over all other government officials in India. He was referred to as &#x27;His Excellency&#x27; and addressed as &#x27;Your Excellency&#x27;. From 1858 to 1947, the governor-general was known as the viceroy of India (from the French &quot;roi&quot;, meaning &#x27;king&#x27;), and wives of Viceroys were known as Vicereines (from the French &quot;reine&quot;, meaning &#x27;queen&#x27;). The Vicereine was referred to as &#x27;Her Excellency&#x27; and was also addressed as &#x27;Your Excellency&#x27;. Neither title was employed while the Sovereign was in India. However, the only British sovereign to visit India during the period of British rule was George V, who attended the Delhi Durbar in 1911 with his wife, Mary.

When the Order of the Star of India was founded in 1861, the viceroy was made its grand master &quot;ex officio&quot;. The viceroy was also made the &quot;ex officio&quot; grand master of the Order of the Indian Empire upon its foundation in 1877.

Most governors-general and viceroys were peers. Frequently, a viceroy who was already a peer would be granted a peerage of higher rank, as with the granting of a marquessate to Lord Reading and an earldom and later a marquessate to Freeman Freeman-Thomas. Of those viceroys who were not peers, Sir John Shore was a baronet, and Lord William Bentinck was entitled to the courtesy title &#x27;lord&#x27; because he was the son of a duke. Only the first and last governors-generalWarren Hastings and Chakravarti Rajagopalacharias well as some provisional governors-general, had no honorific titles at all.

==Flag and insignia==
From around 1885, the viceroy of India was allowed to fly a Union Jack Flag augmented in the centre with the &#x27;Star of India&#x27; surmounted by a crown. This flag was not the viceroy&#x27;s personal flag; it was also used by governors, lieutenant governors, chief commissioners and other British officers in India. When at sea, only the viceroy flew the flag from the mainmast, while other officials flew it from the foremast.

From 1947 to 1950, the governor-general of India used a dark blue flag bearing the royal crest (a lion standing on the Crown), beneath which was the word &#x27;India&#x27; in gold majuscules. The same design is still used by many other Commonwealth Realm governors-general. This last flag was the personal flag of the governor-general only.

==Residence==
The governor-general of Fort William resided in Belvedere House, Calcutta, until the early nineteenth century, when Government House was constructed. In 1854, the lieutenant governor of Bengal took up residence there. Now, the Belvedere Estate houses the National Library of India.

Lord Wellesley, who is reputed to have said that &#x27;India should be governed from a palace, not from a country house&#x27;, constructed a grand mansion, known as Government House in Calcutta, between 1799 and 1803. The mansion remained in use until the capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi in 1912. Thereafter, the lieutenant governor of Bengal, who had hitherto resided in Belvedere House, was upgraded to a full governor and transferred to Government House. Now, it serves as the residence of the governor of the Indian state of West Bengal, and is referred to by its Bengali name Raj Bhavan.

After the capital moved from Calcutta to Delhi, the viceroy occupied the newly built Viceroy&#x27;s House, designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. Though construction began in 1912, it did not conclude until 1929; the palace was not formally inaugurated until 1931. The final cost exceeded £877,000 (over £35 million in modern terms)—more than twice the figure originally allocated. Today the residence, now known by the Hindi name of &#x27;Rashtrapati Bhavan&#x27;, is used by the president of India.

Throughout the British administration, governors-general retreated to the Viceregal Lodge &quot;(now Rashtrapati Niwas)&quot; at Shimla each summer to escape the heat, and the government of India moved with them. The Viceregal Lodge now houses the Indian Institute of Advanced Study. The Peterhoff building in Shimla was also used by several viceroys, although the original building was destroyed by fire in 1981.

<doc id="266210" wikidata="Q178528" url="?curid=266210" title="Traditional Chinese characters">
<text>Traditional Chinese characters are a standard set of Chinese character forms used to write Chinese languages. In Taiwan, the set of traditional characters is regulated by the Ministry of Education and standardized in the &quot;Standard Form of National Characters&quot;. These forms were predominant in written Chinese until the middle of the 20th century, when various countries that use Chinese characters began standardizing simplified sets of characters, often with characters that existed before as well-known variants of the predominant forms.

Simplified characters as codified by the People&#x27;s Republic of China are predominantly used in mainland China, Malaysia, and Singapore. &quot;Traditional&quot; as such is a retronym applied to non-simplified character sets in the wake of widespread use of simplified characters. Traditional characters are commonly used in Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macau, as well as in most overseas Chinese communities outside of Southeast Asia. As for non-Chinese languages written using Chinese characters, Japanese kanji include many simplified characters known as standardized after World War II, sometimes distinct from their simplified Chinese counterparts. Korean hanja, still used to a certain extent in South Korea, remain virtually identical to traditional characters, with variations between the two forms largely stylistic.

There has historically been a debate on traditional and simplified Chinese characters. Because the simplifications are fairly systematic, it is possible to convert computer-encoded characters between the two sets, with the main issue being ambiguities in simplified representations resulting from the merging of previously distinct character forms. Many Chinese online newspapers allow users to switch between these character sets.

== Terminology ==
Traditional characters are known by different names throughout the Chinese-speaking world. The government of Taiwan officially refers to traditional Chinese characters as . This term is also used outside Taiwan to distinguish standard characters, including both simplified, and traditional, from other variants and idiomatic characters. Users of traditional characters elsewhere, as well as those using simplified characters, call traditional characters , , or to distinguish them from simplified characters.

Some argue that since traditional characters are often the original standard forms, they should not be called &#x27;complex&#x27;. Conversely, there is a common objection to the description of traditional characters as &#x27;standard&#x27;, due to them not being used by a large population of Chinese speakers. Additionally, as the process of Chinese character creation often made many characters more elaborate over time, there is sometimes a hesitation to characterize them as &#x27;traditional&#x27;.

Some people refer to traditional characters as &#x27;proper characters&#x27; ( or ) and to simplified characters as or , as the words for &quot;simplified&quot; and &quot;reduced&quot; are homophonous in Standard Chinese, both pronounced as .

== Use by region ==

The modern shapes of traditional Chinese characters first appeared with the emergence of the clerical script during the Han dynasty , with the sets of forms and norms more or less stable since the Southern and Northern dynasties period .

=== Mainland China ===
Although the majority of Chinese text in mainland China are simplified characters, there is no legislation prohibiting the use of traditional Chinese characters, and often traditional Chinese characters remain in use for stylistic and commercial purposes, such as in shopfront displays and advertising. Traditional Chinese characters remain ubiquitous on buildings that predate the promulgation of the current simplification scheme, such as former government buildings, religious buildings, educational institutions, and historical monuments. Traditional Chinese characters continue to be used for ceremonial, cultural, scholarly/academic research, and artistic/decorative purposes.

In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, traditional Chinese characters are standardised according to the Table of Comparison between Standard, Traditional and Variant Chinese Characters. Dictionaries published in mainland China generally show both simplified and their traditional counterparts. There are differences between the accepted traditional forms in mainland China and elsewhere, for example the accepted traditional form of in mainland China is (also the accepted form in Japan and Korea), while in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan the accepted form is (also the accepted form in Vietnamese chữ Nôm). 

The PRC tends to print material intended for people in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan, and overseas Chinese in traditional characters. For example, versions of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; are printed in traditional characters, and both &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; and &quot;Xinhua&quot; have traditional character versions of their website available, using Big5 encoding. Mainland companies selling products in Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan use traditional characters in order to communicate with consumers; the inverse is equally true as well. In digital media, many cultural phenomena imported from Hong Kong and Taiwan into mainland China, such as music videos, karaoke videos, subtitled movies, and subtitled dramas, use traditional Chinese characters.

=== Hong Kong and Macau ===

In Hong Kong and Macau, traditional characters were retained during the colonial period, while the mainland adopted simplified characters. Simplified characters are contemporaneously used to accommodate immigrants and tourists, often from the mainland. The increasing use of simplified characters has led to concern among residents regarding protecting what they see as their local heritage.

=== Taiwan ===
Taiwan has never adopted simplified characters. The use of simplified characters in government documents and educational settings is discouraged by the government of Taiwan. Nevertheless, with sufficient context simplified characters are likely to be successfully read by those used to traditional characters, especially given some previous exposure. Many simplified characters were previously variants that had long been in some use, with systematic stroke simplifications used in folk handwriting since antiquity.

=== Singapore ===
Traditional characters were recognized as the official script in Singapore until 1969, when the government officially adopted Simplified characters. Traditional characters still are widely used in contexts such as in baby and corporation names, advertisements, decorations, official documents and in newspapers.

=== Philippines ===
The Chinese Filipino community continues to be one of the most conservative in Southeast Asia regarding simplification. Although major public universities teach in simplified characters, many well-established Chinese schools still use traditional characters. Publications such as the &quot;Chinese Commercial News&quot;, &quot;World News&quot;, and &quot;United Daily News&quot; all use traditional characters, as do some Hong Kong–based magazines such as &quot;Yazhou Zhoukan&quot;. The &quot;Philippine Chinese Daily&quot; uses simplified characters. DVDs are usually subtitled using traditional characters, influenced by media from Taiwan as well as by the two countries sharing the same DVD region, 3.

=== North America ===
With most having immigrated to the United States during the second half of the 19th century, Chinese Americans have long used traditional characters. When not providing both, US public notices and signs in Chinese are generally written in traditional characters, more often than in simplified characters.

== Use on computers ==
=== Encoding ===
In the past, traditional Chinese was most often encoded on computers using the Big5 standard, which favored traditional characters. However, the ubiquitous Unicode standard gives equal weight to simplified and traditional Chinese characters, and has become by far the most popular encoding for Chinese-language text.

=== Input methods ===

There are various input method editors (IMEs) available for the input of Chinese characters. Many characters, often dialectical variants, are encoded in Unicode but cannot be inputted using certain IMEs, with one example being the Shanghainese-language character —a composition of with the radical—used instead of the Standard Chinese .

=== Typefaces ===

Typefaces often use the initialism to signify the use of traditional Chinese characters, as well as for simplified Chinese characters. In addition, the Noto family of typefaces, for example, also provides separate fonts for the traditional character set used in Taiwan () and the set used in Hong Kong ().

=== Webpages ===
Most Chinese-language webpages now use Unicode for their text. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) recommends the use of the language tag to specify webpage content written with traditional characters.

== Comparison with other scripts ==
In the Japanese writing system, are traditional forms, which were simplified to create for standardized Japanese use following World War II. Kyūjitai are mostly congruent with the traditional characters in Chinese, save for minor stylistic variation. Characters that are not included in the list are generally recommended to be printed in their traditional forms, with a few exceptions. Additionally, there are , which are kanji wholly created in Japan, rather than originally being borrowed from China.

In the Korean writing system, hanja—replaced almost entirely by hangul in South Korea and totally replaced in North Korea—are mostly identical with their traditional counterparts, save minor stylistic variations. As with Japanese, there are autochthonous hanja, known as .

Traditional Chinese characters are also used by non-Chinese ethnic groups. The Maniq people living in Thailand and Malaysia use Chinese characters to write the Kensiu language.

<doc id="266215" wikidata="Q1783224" url="?curid=266215" title="Peter Brock">
<text>Peter Geoffrey Brock (26 February 1945 – 8 September 2006), known as &quot;Peter Perfect&quot;, &quot;The King of the Mountain&quot;, or simply &quot;Brocky&quot;, was an Australian motor racing driver. Brock was most often associated with Holden for almost 40 years, although he raced vehicles of other manufacturers including BMW, Ford, Volvo, Porsche and Peugeot. He won the Bathurst 1000 endurance race nine times, the Sandown 500 touring car race nine times, the Australian Touring Car Championship three times, the Bathurst 24 Hour once and was inducted into the V8 Supercars Hall of Fame in 2001. Brock&#x27;s business activities included the Holden Dealer Team (HDT) that produced Brock&#x27;s racing machines as well as a number of modified high-performance road versions of his racing cars.

==Early years==
Peter Brock was born at the Epworth Hospital, Richmond, Victoria, the son of Geoff and Ruth Brock (née Laidlay). The family lived in the country town of Hurstbridge (now an outer suburb of Melbourne) and Brock continued to live there throughout his life. He attended Eltham High School in Eltham, Victoria. His first car was an Austin 7 that he bought for £5 (A$10). He claimed that his driving skill improved at this point of his life because the car did not have brakes (or a body, which was removed with his mother&#x27;s axe).

Brock was drafted into the Australian Army in 1965 and spent his two years of National Service stationed at the Blamey Barracks near Wagga Wagga in New South Wales. During his time in the army, Brock was against the federal government&#x27;s plan to send conscripts to Vietnam. Brock was in the Medical Corps where he often served as an ambulance driver. According to his brother Lewis, Brock and his mates used to race the ambulances around the base. Although they did not know each other at the time, also stationed at the Barracks from 1965 to 1967 was a young Dick Johnson who from the 1980s would go on to be one of Brock&#x27;s chief touring car rivals.

It was while on leave from the army in 1966 that Brock first visited Bathurst to watch the 500-mile production car race that was to become the Bathurst 1000. It was after watching the race that he decided that he wanted to become a race driver when he left the army. His brother Phil also became a racing driver, and co-drove with his brother in the Bathurst 1000 on two occasions.

==Racing career==
During his early career Brock raced some &quot;wild and woolly&quot; creations including the famous blue 6-cylinder Holden-powered Austin A30. Brock rose to public attention in touring car racing.

===Bathurst===
 Brock made his debut at Bathurst in the 1969 Hardie-Ferodo 500 in a Holden HT Monaro GTS 350 alongside Des West, with the pair finishing third behind their winning HDT teammates Colin Bond and Tony Roberts. He won the Bathurst 500 for the first time in 1972 (the last year the race was run over 500 miles and the last year in which driving solo was permitted).

Brock would win the event a total of nine times between 1972 and 1987, a feat that has not been equalled. His 1979 win was remarkable in that he and co-driver Jim Richards claimed victory by six laps, a record that, due to changes in race regulations introduced in the mid- to late 1980s, most notably the introduction of the Safety Car in 1987, may never be broken, and broke the circuit lap record for touring cars on the 163rd and final lap of the race (the record would stand until Brock himself broke it in 1982). Brock had tried to set the lap record on the final lap of the 1978 race, but he was inadvertently baulked by the Alfa Romeo of Ray Gulson through The Dipper. In 32 starts at Bathurst he claimed pole position a record six times (1974, 1977, 1978, 1979, 1983 and 1989), with all bar his 1989 pole in a Ford Sierra RS500 being for Holden. Brock also sat on pole for the 1997 V8 Supercars race but the time was set by his co-driver Mark Skaife. His record at this race earned him the popular nickname &quot;King of the Mountain&quot;.

Peter Brock also won the second (and last) Bathurst 24 Hour race in 2003 driving a 7.0L V8-powered Holden Monaro 427C for Garry Rogers Motorsport. Brock won the race, which although not the Bathurst 1000, he regarded as his tenth Bathurst win driving alongside V8 Supercar drivers Greg Murphy, Jason Bright and Todd Kelly. The #05 Monaro won the race by less than half a second from the 2002 race winning GRM Monaro 427C driven by Nathan Pretty, Garth Tander, Steven Richards and Cameron McConville. The two Monaros finished 12 laps in front of the third-placed Porsche 996 GT3 RC of Peter Fitzgerald, Paul Morris, John Teulan and Scott Shearman.

===Sandown===
Along with his record at the Bathurst race, Brock also claimed victory in the traditional lead up race to Bathurst, the Sandown 500, nine times, including a string of seven consecutive wins from 1975 until 1981. He won a total of 37 races during his career in the Australian Touring Car/V8 Supercar championships, a record only eventually equalled by Mark Skaife in 2006 and beaten in 2007.

===Other Australian Racing===
Brock had a brief foray into Open wheel racing when he raced a Ford powered Birrana 273 to 8th place in the 1973 Australian Formula 2 Championship. Although he had some minor, non-championship wins in the car, his best placing in the national championship series was second behind series champion Leo Geoghegan in Round 2 or Oran Park in Sydney. Brock&#x27;s HDT boss Harry Firth later told that he let Brock race the Birrana to get formula racing &quot;out of his system&quot;. Later in early 1984, Brock tested a Ralt RT4 with a view to possibly driving one in the 1984 Australian Drivers&#x27; Championship and the end of year Australian Grand Prix (which at the time were run to Formula Mondial rules), and put in some competitive lap times at Calder Park. However, he later decided that with the road car business, touring car commitments and the planned Sports Car races at Silverstone and Le Mans, he simply could not devote enough time to the project to make it worth doing.

Brock and the Holden Dealer Team worked in partnership, with full factory approval and assistance, to produce a number of high-performance modifications to the Commodores under existing CAMS Group C regulations from 1980 to 1987. Some of these were HDT &quot;homologation specials&quot;, one step away from race cars. It was around this time that Brock began his run of six Bathurst 1000 wins in seven years with a pair of hat trick wins from 1978 to 1980 (with Jim Richards) and 1982 to &#x27;84 (with Larry Perkins and John Harvey), including his record-breaking six-lap victory in the 1979 event.

While Brock was always typecast in a Holden, he did have &#x27;brief flirtations&#x27; with other makes in touring car racing. After his 1987 Holden split, he campaigned a BMW M3 in 1988, becoming the official BMW Australia backed team for the year (his only win in the BMW would be in the 1988 Pepsi 250 at Oran Park), before driving a Ford Sierra RS500 in 1989 and 1990. As the turbo-charged Sierras were the Group A cars to have at the time it was seen as a logical move to return to the front end of the field.

During 1988 Brock also campaigned a V8 Ford XF Falcon in the Calder Park Thunderdome-based AUSCAR series, though unlike touring car rivals such as Jim Richards, Allan Grice and Brad Jones, Brock&#x27;s foray into Superspeedway racing was brief.

With the increasing costs of running two Sierras, and with the teams technical support from the UK-based Andy Rouse also stopping thanks to Rouse moving to drive for Toyota, Brock returned to driving a Holden in 1991, teaming with former HDT co-driver Perkins (who had left the HDT in mid-1985) to run a pair of VN SS Group A Commodores. The association with Perkins Engineering only lasted for one year, though Brock continued to run the ATCC driving in Commodores.

A further flirtation away from Holden was in 1994 when he raced a Volvo 850 in the one-off Eastern Creek 12-Hour. He also competed for the same Volvo Dealer Racing team in the Australian Super Touring Championship in 1996, finishing 6th in the championship with a best finish of second in Round 7 at Lakeside in Brisbane.

===International racing===
Brock&#x27;s first international race came in 1971 when Harry Firth made a late decision to enter the HDT in the Guia touring car Race at the Macau Grand Prix. Driving one of the team&#x27;s old Series Production LC Torana GTR XU-1s, Brock finished second behind 1971 European Touring Car Champion Dieter Glemser, who according to Brock in his regular &quot;Auto Action&quot; column, drove a full works Ford Capri 2600. Ford rival Allan Moffat also raced in his GTHO Falcon, but struggled throughout the meeting with tyre troubles and wasn&#x27;t a factor in the race being some 20 seconds per lap slower than the Torana. Brock claimed that scrutineering was almost non-existent at Macau, while Firth would describe Glemser&#x27;s Capri and the Alfa Romeo GTA of third placed Hong Kong driver Albert Poon as &quot;pretty damned rude&quot; for not being strictly production cars as they were supposed to be.

Unlike several other Australian drivers, including Alan Jones and Larry Perkins, Brock did not seek a full-time racing career outside Australia. He did attempt the 24 Hours of Le Mans three times in privateer vehicles, firstly in 1976 in the Team Brock BMW 3.0CSL which was bought in South Africa in late 1975 and shipped to Melbourne, where it was completely stripped and rebuilt. His co-driver was former Aussie and UK resident Brian Muir with the BMW lasting 17 hours before a head gasket blew. He then returned for the 1981 race teamed with former HDT teammate Colin Bond and Bathurst co-driver Jim Richards in the Porsche Cars Australia #74 Porsche 924 Carrera GTR but while the team practiced, they were only named as a reserve, not participating in the race itself.

While at the 1983 Australian Grand Prix meeting at Calder Park, sports car racer and 1976 Hardie-Ferodo 1000 winner John Fitzpatrick challenged Brock, that having won everything there was to win in Australia he should try his hand overseas with the &#x27;big boys&#x27;, meaning Le Mans. After millionaire businessman and racer Bob Jane got involved with sponsorship through his Bob Jane T-Marts, a deal was completed to race a Porsche 956B rented from John Fitzpatrick Racing in 1984. This car was a well-worn 956, chassis number 956-102 previously seen in J. David and Skoal Bandit colours. With regular HDT co-driver Larry Perkins, Brock finished 21st at the 1000 km of Silverstone after spending time in the pits fixing a broken rear suspension. The pair then drove in the 24 Hours of Le Mans. Perkins qualified the car 15th with a time of 3:35.340 which was 18.29 seconds slower than the pole winning works Lancia LC2 of Bob Wollek (Brock was 2 seconds slower than Perkins, though his times were set on race tyres while Perkins was given a set of qualifiers). After a good start by Perkins in the hot conditions, Team Australia were running as high as 5th at one stage of the race before retiring after Perkins crashed in the Esses on lap 145 while trying to make up for lost time, which included a lost wheel while Brock was in the car, and a broken rear bolt which caused Perkins to almost spin the Porsche at close to while racing flat out through the kink on the famous Mulsanne Straight. The Team Australia assault on the race, and the fortunes of the other Aussies including 1983 winner Vern Schuppan, Formula One World Champion Alan Jones and Allan Grice, was covered extensively in the Peter Mckay/Barry Naismith book &quot;LeMans The Australian Assault&quot;.

While in Europe in 1984, Brock was in the unusual situation (for him) of being the second billing in his driver pairing with Perkins. From 1974 until 1977 Larry Perkins had made 11 starts in F1 and, to the large number of European motoring press covering the two World Endurance Championship races, ex-F1 driver Larry &#x27;Larrikins&#x27; Perkins was the star driver with Brock seen as nothing more than a saloon car driver. According to Perkins, &quot;The Porsche exercise at Le Mans was great although PB (Brock) struggled with the &#x27;Euro media&#x27; because no one knew who he was!&quot;

Brock also drove a Vauxhall Magnum with British driver Gerry Marshall to a surprise second place in the 1977 Spa 24 Hours. He also shocked many when he won the 1979 Repco Round Australia Trial driving for the HDT in a 6cyl Holden VB Commodore along with co-drivers Noel Richards and Matthew Philip. The shock came as many in the motoring press regarded Brock as a circuit racer and seemed forgot about his extensive Rally and Rallycross experience with the Dealer Team in the early 1970s. The press saw his inclusion merely as a publicity stunt by Holden and the race organisers in order to generate interest in the race. The Repco was a long-distance endurance rally that drove clockwise around Australia featuring some dirt road sections completely different to the circuit racing where he made his name. The Round Australia Trial was revived in 1995 (sponsored by Brock&#x27;s long time backer Mobil) with Brock again racing for Holden in a Holden Racing Team prepared VR Commodore. Brock finished 3rd in the trial which was won by teammate (and former Australian Rally Champion) Ed Ordynski.

===Retirement activities===
After 1991 when teamed with Perkins Engineering, Brock continued to race in his own privately supported Advantage Racing Commodores in 1992 and 1993, before joining the factory Holden Racing Team in 1994. Brock retired from full-time driving following the 1997 Australian Touring Car season.

After his nominal &#x27;retirement&#x27; he made two returns to Bathurst. In 2002 he paired with Team Brock lead driver Craig Baird to a 23rd-place finish in the teams Commodore VX, Brock finished 25 laps down due to engine temperature problems. He then returned to the Holden Racing team for the 2004 Bathurst 1000, teaming with Jason Plato in a Commodore VY. The pair failed to finish after Plato was involved in a spectacular accident coming out of Caltex Chase with the Brad Jones Racing Falcon of John Cleland while Cleland was lapping the Commodore (which was limping to the pits with a blown tyre) on lap 29. The clash caused the Falcon to roll and enough damage to the HRT car to be out on the spot with Brock failing to get a drive in his last Bathurst race after Plato had started the car and was due to hand over to Brock a few laps after the crash.

Brock also drove a Holden Monaro 427C for Garry Rogers Motorsport (GRM), winning four from four races in what was thought to be a one-off appearance in the support races for the 2003 Australian Grand Prix in Melbourne. This led to him driving a 2nd Monaro built and run by GRM in the Australian Nations Cup Championship, a GT-type championship for highly modified and exotic road cars in 2003 before setting up his own team for himself and stepson James in 2004 (with Monaros supplied by GRM). He achieved a tenth Bathurst endurance win in 2003 at the Bathurst 24 Hour, when he won, with Greg Murphy, Jason Bright and Todd Kelly in his GRM Monaro, controversially powered by a 7.0L 427 cui V8 engine rather than the 5.7L Gen III as used by the production Monaro CV8 (the controversy came from no other car in Nations Cup being able to run a different size engine from the production model it was based on. Triple Nations Cup champion Jim Richards labelled the Monaro as a &quot;Better V8 Supercar&quot; when it first appeared at the 2002 Bathurst 24 Hour).

In 2002, he returned to top-level touring car racing as a team patron with Rod Nash Racing in V8 Supercar Commodore and drove in that year&#x27;s Bathurst 1000 with the team was renamed &#x27;Team Brock&#x27; as a branding exercise. The &#x27;Team Brock&#x27; branding exercise was revived for 2003 this time with Paul Weel Racing but this time Brock&#x27;s role was as a mentor rather than a driver. Frustrated with the lack of control he held over a team bearing his name, Brock and the team parted company at the end of the season.

He occasionally competed in various enthusiast-level motorsport events such as the Targa Tasmania with the Monaros he drove actually constructed by Holden Special Vehicles. His smooth on-camera persona and familiarity to older Australians continued to sell products, including Mobil (including a 2000 United States television commercial) and Bridgestone tyres, as the controversy of the Energy Polariser had been largely forgotten.

==Other activities==
===Motor safety campaign===
Brock worked with the Victorian authorities promoting the campaign against drink-driving. The most obvious sign of this association was the race car number 05 which related to the 0.05% blood alcohol limit in Victoria, which he utilised constantly from the mid-1970s. Most cars he raced in, regardless of the motor racing division, bore this number, including the car in which he died.

===Car Modifications===
Brock began publicly supporting and, eventually, began to fit to all Holden Dealer Team specials a device called the &quot;Energy Polariser&quot; containing crystals and magnets in an epoxy resin that, it was claimed, improved the performance and handling of vehicles through &quot;aligning the molecules&quot;. The device was based on the principles of orgone energy pseudoscience. The &quot;Polariser&quot; is being sold once more in an official HDT, Brock tribute upgrade pack.

The overwhelming majority of the Australian motoring community regarded the device as pseudoscience, and Brock&#x27;s promotion of it drove away HDT drivers like John Harvey, Allan Moffat and Larry Perkins. Brock also recommended tyre pressures of 22psi (150kPa) for his polariser-equipped vehicles, a level which many regarded as near-dangerously low. Holden, fearing the consequences of being associated with the device and a resulting breakdown in communications over Brock&#x27;s plans for new models, cut ties with Brock and set up an alternative racing/modification operation, Holden Special Vehicles. During this period, Brock also became involved in the importation and even the modification of the Lada Samara, a cheap Soviet-built hatchback a world away from the high-performance V8-powered Commodores he was famous for. The Lada deal came at the right time for the Brock organisation as it saved the struggling outfit from potential bankruptcy.

After his work with Lada, Brock, during the period 1988–1990 sold around 200 personally modified EA-series Ford Falcons, Fairmont Ghias, Fairlanes and Mavericks through Austech Automotive Developments.

=== Media work ===
Due to his extraordinary success on the racing track Brock became the Australian racing driver with the highest-profile as he undertook several media commitments. When not racing he often appeared on New Zealand television screens as a presenter; hosting motoring shows such as TV3&#x27;s &quot;Police Stop&quot; (1996–1998) and TVNZ&#x27;s &quot;Love That Car&quot; (2000). In Australia, Brock hosted a show similar to &quot;Police Stop&quot; known as &quot;Police Camera Action&quot; which was shown on the Seven Network (1996–98).

Brock has been the subject of several DVD documentaries—&quot;The Legend&quot; (1997; updated 2004), &quot;Peter Brock - Nine Times a Champion&quot;, Holden First Around Australia&quot; (Repco Trial VB Commodore)&quot;, 25 Years of HDT Special Vehicles Collectors Edition (2006) and &quot;35 Years on the Mountain&quot; (2005). He was also due to star in a racing film &quot;King of the Mountain&quot; in early 2007.

===The Peter Brock Foundation===
He announced to a packed race track he was forming &#x27;The Peter Brock Foundation&#x27;, a philanthropic organisation funded by corporate sponsors and donations from the public. Aimed at disadvantaged youth and others experiencing difficulties in Australia. As of 2021 the Foundation still continues operating and has financed many activities and people.

===Standing in community===
As the lead driver for the Holden Dealer Team in a succession of both 6 and 8 cylinder Holden Toranas and later, V8 Commodores Brock became a household name that transcended motor racing as he emerged to be one of the best-known modern Australia and New Zealand racing drivers, spoken of with the same reverence as Formula One World Champions Jack Brabham, Alan Jones and Denny Hulme.

In 1986, Brock was crowned &quot;King of Moomba&quot; by the Melbourne-based festival committee.

His public standing was dented by controversy over his promotion of the &quot;Energy Polariser&quot; and domestic violence allegations levelled by an ex-wife, with calls to keep him out of the Australian Motor Sport Hall of Fame.

==Personal life==

===Relationships===
Brock married Heather Russell in 1967. The marriage ended in divorce two years later.

Several years later, Brock met 1973 Miss Australia pageant winner and Channel Seven weather presenter Michelle Downes. They married in April 1974 and divorced after only one year. In 2006, Downes said Brock assaulted her on a number of occasions, and forced her to have an abortion.

Brock next entered into a relationship with Beverly &quot;Bev&quot; McIntosh, the wife of a member of his motor racing team. After two failed marriages Brock was hesitant to marry McIntosh and although the couple never married, Peter always called Bev his &quot;wife&quot;, and she changed her surname to Brock by deed poll. They had two children together, Robert and Alexandra. Her oldest, James, is Bev&#x27;s son from a previous marriage. Bev wrote Peter&#x27;s biography herself in 2004 after finding most potential authors had incorrect preconceived notions about him. She also expressed a desire to show his human side, to encourage others that they, too, can achieve their goals. &quot;Even Allan Moffat said it&#x27;s okay for him—it&#x27;s us mortals that have the problem,&quot; she said. Bev described Brock as an imperfect but never violent man.

Brock split with Bev in May 2005 after 28 years together. Alexandra gave birth to their grandson Oliver on 28 June 2006, two months before Brock&#x27;s death. According to Bev, Brock was not an entirely faithful partner. She has described in a book her eventual tiring in the early 1990s of his relationships with &quot;one too many secretaries&quot;.

After splitting with Bev, Peter began a relationship with Julie Bamford, whom he had met through his former partner Bev some 20 years previously. Subsequently, Bamford&#x27;s estranged husband Ron McCurdy, who had once been a close friend of Brock&#x27;s, assaulted Brock during a chance meeting outside the Peter Brock Foundation&#x27;s office.

===Lifestyle===
Brock, who lived hard in his early years, changed his lifestyle considerably after the failed 1984 Le Mans attempt left him physically and emotionally drained.

After his return from Le Mans, Brock began to consult Melbourne-based chiropractor Eric Dowker. He gave up alcohol and cigarettes and became a vegetarian, 5 years after that he became a vegan. Eventually he returned to being a vegetarian.

== Death ==
On 8 September 2006, while driving in the &quot;Targa West &#x27;06&quot; rally, Brock was from the finish of the second stage of the race at Gidgegannup, about from Perth, Western Australia, when he skidded off a downhill left-hand bend on Clenton Road for over in his 2001 Daytona Sportscar and hit a tree sideways, in the driver&#x27;s door. The 61-year-old Brock died within a couple of minutes of the impact. His co-driver, Mick Hone, was taken to hospital in a serious but stable condition. Video footage of the crash (provided by a fan and the in-car camera) was reviewed by Western Australian police to help determine the cause of the crash. Coroner Alastair Hope decided that his death was caused by high speed and that no coronial inquest would be held. The video was not released to the public.

Brock&#x27;s children accepted the offer of a Victorian state funeral, with former partner Bev telling ABC Radio:
:&quot;[Brock] was loved. He was in the public eye, and everything had to be done with a flourish and with a bang. It&#x27;s probably the way he would want to go out (and how), he would want to be remembered.&quot;

The editor of &quot;Wheels Magazine&quot;, Ged Bulmer, said that Brock would be remembered for his nine victories at Bathurst, for &quot;He had a long and very successful career there, he was the &#x27;King of the Mountain&#x27; as he came to be known.&quot;

Brock was farewelled with a state funeral at Melbourne&#x27;s St. Paul&#x27;s Anglican Cathedral, on 19 September 2006. A permanent memorial was placed at Peter Brock&#x27;s &quot;home&quot; raceway, Sandown Raceway, on 22 September.

===Estate===
Brock left three wills and a complex estate. The court battle between his family members was protracted and took over three years to complete.

==Legacy==

In honour of his achievements and in recognition of his contribution to Australian motorsport, the Bathurst 1000 winner&#x27;s trophy now carries his name. The Peter Brock Trophy was first incorporated for the 2006 Supercheap Auto Bathurst 1000. The race was won by Craig Lowndes and Jamie Whincup driving a Ford BA Falcon. Lowndes had long been regarded as Brock&#x27;s protégé, and was a teammate of Brock in 1996. Lowndes and Whincup would go on to win three Bathurst 1000s in succession, matching the feat that Brock achieved twice.

Next to the site of his most famous motor racing achievements at Mount Panorama, a memorial statue was built adjacent to the National Motor Racing Museum in Bathurst. Unveiled in 2008, the statue features Brock standing on his 1984 Bathurst-winning Holden VK Commodore. Two roads in Sydney have been named Peter Brock Drive: in Oran Park as part of the housing development that replaced Oran Park Raceway, and in Eastern Creek, near Sydney Motorsport Park. In 1997 the Skyline section at the top of the Mount Panorama race track was renamed Brock’s Skyline in his honor.

A two-part television miniseries entitled &quot;Brock&quot; was aired on Network Ten in October 2016, with Matthew Le Nevez playing the title character. However, the miniseries received criticism for trivialising and titillating his life.

== Awards ==
In addition to his racing championships, Brock&#x27;s efforts to society have been recognised in various ways:
* Member of the Order of Australia (9 June 1980) – AM QB80. For service to the sport of motor racing.
* Bent Spoon Award (1986) Awarded by the Australian Skeptics for his promotion of the &quot;Energy Polariser&quot; device.

<doc id="266217" wikidata="Q1127675" url="?curid=266217" title="2007 Cricket World Cup">
<text>The 2007 ICC Cricket World Cup was the ninth Cricket World Cup, a One Day International (ODI) cricket tournament that took place in the West Indies from 13 March to 28 April 2007. There were a total of 51 matches played, three fewer than at the 2003 World Cup (despite a field larger by two teams).

The 16 competing teams were initially divided into four groups, with the two best-performing teams from each group moving on to a Super 8 format. Every team played a total of 6 matches in the Super 8 round; they didn&#x27;t played with teams of their own group. They played a total of 6 teams from another three groups (the top 2 teams of all three groups) From this, Australia, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, and South Africa won through to the semi-finals, with Australia defeating Sri Lanka in the final to win their third consecutive World Cup and their fourth overall. Australia&#x27;s unbeaten record in the tournament increased their total to 29 consecutive World Cup matches without loss, a streak dating back to 23 May 1999, during the group stage of the 1999 World Cup. The tournament also saw upsets and surprise results, with pre-tournament favourites India and Pakistan failing to make it past the group stage, while Bangladesh, the second-lowest ranked ICC Full Member at the time, and World Cup debutant Ireland, which was an ICC Associate Member at the time, made it to the &quot;Super 8&quot;, beating India and Pakistan respectively en route. Ireland became only the second associate nation to make it past the first round of a Cricket World Cup, the first being Kenya in 2003.

Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer died the day after Pakistan was knocked out. The following day, police announced that the death was suspicious and ordered a full investigation. Eight months later, an open verdict was returned.

Following the tournament, the ICC distributed surplus tournament revenues of US$239 million to its members.

==Host selection==
The World Cup was awarded to the West Indies via the International Cricket Council&#x27;s rotational policy. It is the first time the ICC Cricket World Cup has been held in the Caribbean despite the fact that the West Indies cricket team had been the second most successful team in past World Cups.

The United States contingent lobbied strongly for matches to be staged at its newly built cricket ground in Lauderhill, Florida, but the ICC decided to award all matches to Caribbean nations. Bids from Bermuda, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, and a second bid by Jamaica were also rejected.

Eight venues across the West Indies were selected to host the World Cup tournament. All host countries hosted six matches with the exceptions of St. Lucia, Jamaica, and Barbados (which hosted the final), each of which hosted seven matches.

The Jamaican government spent US$81 million for &quot;on-the-pitch&quot; expenses. This included refurbishing Sabina Park and constructing the new multi-purpose facility in Trelawny through a loan from China. Another US$20 million was budgeted for &#x27;off-the-pitch&#x27; expenses, putting the tally at more than US$100 million or JM$7 billion.

This put the reconstruction cost of Sabina Park at US$46 million whilst the Trelawny Stadium was estimated to cost US$35 million. The total amount of money spent on stadiums was at least US$301 million.

Brian Lara Stadium in Trinidad lost its status as a pre-tournament warm-up match venue on 21 September 2006.

==Venues==
===Warm-up venues===
==Qualification==
The field of 16 teams, the largest ever for the Cricket World Cup, consisted of all 16 teams which currently held ODI status. This included the ten full members of the ICC, all of which have Test and permanent ODI status. The other six (associate) ODI nations were Kenya (which had ODI status until 2009) and five additional teams (previously three) that qualified via the 2005 ICC Trophy (gaining ODI status until 2009 in the process). These nations included Scotland who won the ICC Trophy, Canada, the Netherlands, and – making their World Cup debuts – Ireland and Bermuda.

==Squads==
The 16 teams had to name their final squads by 13 February 2007. Changes were allowed after this deadline at the discretion of the ICC&#x27;s Technical Committee in necessary cases, such as due to player injury.

==Leadup==
All major Test-playing nations had schedules allowing them to play a large number of ODI matches against other major ODI teams just prior to the World Cup. Australia, New Zealand, and England took part in the Commonwealth Bank Series where England defeated Australia in the finals. Australia then went to New Zealand for the Chappell–Hadlee Trophy, losing 3–0. South Africa played five ODIs against India (South Africa won 4–0) and five against Pakistan (South Africa won 3–1), while India also played four ODIs against the West Indies (India won 3–1) and four ODIs against Sri Lanka (India won 2–1). Bangladesh played four ODIs against Zimbabwe (Bangladesh won 3–1) and won a tri-series against Canada and Bermuda. The associate ODI teams took part in the World Cricket League, which Kenya won, and were also involved in other series prior to the World Cup.

The rankings of the teams at the beginning of the Cricket World Cup were:

&quot;Note: Teams 12–16 did not have official ODI rankings leading up to the World Cup; they are ranked based on their win percentage against full members and then wins against associate members prior to the tournament.&quot;

===Warm-up matches===
Prior to the main tournament, all 16 nations played a series of warm-up matches to prepare, experiment with different tactics, and to help them get acclimated to conditions in the West Indies. The matches were played from Monday 5 March until Friday 9 March.

Australia, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan were the only teams to win both of their warm-up games, whilst Bermuda, Canada, the Netherlands and Scotland did not win either of their fixtures.
















====Aggregate warm-up results====
====Match status====
None of the warm-up games were officially recognised as ODIs or List A matches by the International Cricket Council due to various changes in the rules of the game. Whilst normally only 11 players are allowed to bat and field (excluding situations involving a substitute fielder), 13 players were used in each team&#x27;s squad for the matches – 11 of which were allowed to field at one time and 11 of which were allowed to bat (meaning players could be swapped in and out when fielding or bowling, but two players did not bat in a match). In official ICC matches match referees are required to help officiate a game, but due to the changes in the rules none were appointed for any of the warm-up games. Additionally, Man of the Match awards were not given out and no reserve days were set for these matches.

===Opening ceremony===
The opening ceremony was held on Sunday, 11 March 2007 at Trelawny Stadium in Jamaica. It featured over 2,000 dancers and performers representing all strands of West Indian music, from calypso and ragga to reggae and soca. Among the performers were Sean Paul, Byron Lee, Kevin Lyttle, Beres Hammond, Lucky Dube, Buju Banton, Half Pint, Arrow, Machel Montano, Alison Hinds, Tony Rebel, Third World, Gregory Isaacs, David Rudder, Shaggy, the I Threes, and Jimmy Cliff.

The ceremony, attended by several heads of state including the Governor-General of Jamaica, started with an address by Sir Garfield Sobers and included messages from the prime ministers of Jamaica and Grenada.

==Rules and regulations==

===Matches===
The matches were One Day Internationals and operated under normal ODI rules. All matches were to be 50 overs a side unless stated otherwise by the umpires or match referee. A bowler was able to bowl a maximum of 10 overs per match.

In the event of bad weather, each side must have batted a minimum of 20 overs for a result to be declared (if the match was not otherwise won, for example if the team batting second were dismissed before the completion of 20 overs). In the event of bad weather, the Duckworth-Lewis method was to be applied to determine the result or target. If no result was declared on the scheduled day, the teams would return the following day to complete the game, with the same situation as when the game was abandoned.

There was a new rule regarding referral of catches to the TV replay official (third umpire): if the standing umpires were unable to determine whether a catch had been taken cleanly, and/or whether a claimed catch was a &quot;bump ball&quot;, they had discretion to refer the decision to the third umpire. Also, &quot;whilst reviewing such a catch via TV replay&quot; if it was clear to the third umpire that the batsman did not hit the ball, he was to indicate that the batsman was not out.

===Tournament points===
In the Group and Super 8 stages, points were awarded as follows:
The top two teams from each group advanced to the Super 8 stage and any points they earned against the other qualifier from their own group was carried through. Points earned against the non-qualifying teams in the same pool were not carried over. In the Super 8s, each team played the six remaining qualifiers from the other groups and the top four teams went through to the semi-finals. Positions were decided by most points. Where two or more teams were tied on points, the following methods in turn were used to decide which team went through:

# Most wins in their group or in Super 8, whichever is applicable
# Higher net run rate
# Higher number of wickets taken per ball
# Winners of head-to-head matches
# The drawing of lots

==Umpires==
The umpiring panel for the 2007 Cricket World Cup comprised nine umpires from the Elite Panel of ICC Umpires (the only member not included was Darrell Hair), and nine umpires from the international panel. The refereeing panel consisted of seven members from the Elite Panel of ICC Referees, with Clive Lloyd not being included due to his role as the West Indies&#x27;s team manager. Aleem Dar went on to stand as an umpire in his first World Cup final, alongside Steve Bucknor who appeared in his fifth final in a row, extending his record of four from the 2003 World Cup.

==Groups==

===Seeds===
The tournament began with a league stage consisting of four groups of four. Each team played each of the other teams in its group once. Australia, India, England, and the West Indies were placed in separate pools for logistical reasons, as they were expected to have the most supporters in attendance, and transport and accommodation capacity in the West Indies was limited.

The groups are listed below, with seedings (rankings from April 2005) shown in brackets. Each group played all of its matches at a single ground.
===Format===
The tournament was preceded by a number of warm-up matches to allow the players to acclimatise to the conditions in the West Indies. The group stage matches started on 13 March and finished on 25 March. There were a total of 24 matches played in the group stage.

The top two teams in each group proceeded to the &quot;Super 8&quot; stage which also used a league system. Each team carried forward its result against the other team qualifying from its preliminary stage group, and played the other six qualifying teams once each. The top four teams in the league qualified for the semi-finals. This system was modified since the previous World Cup, which had a &quot;Super 6&quot; stage rather than a Super 8. The Super 8 stage matches were played from Tuesday 27 March until Saturday 21 April. A total of 24 matches were played in the Super 8 stage.

The top four teams in the &quot;Super 8&quot; advanced to the semi-finals. This was the knockout stage, with the No. 1 team playing the No. 4 team, and the No. 2 team playing the No. 3 team in the tournament. The winners of the two semi-finals played each other in the Final.

All tournament matches had one reserve day (the day after the scheduled day of the match) to allow for matches to be completed in the event of bad weather.

==Group stage==
===Group A===



===Group B===



===Group C===



===Group D===



==Super 8 stage==

The top two teams in each first-round group moved on to a &quot;Super 8&quot; stage which was scored as a complete round-robin. However, each of the eight teams played only six new matches, rather than seven – each group&#x27;s two representatives carried forward their result against each other rather than play again. Thus the table below, showing seven matches for each team, covers all matches between the Super 8 qualifiers, including those from the Group Stage.

Teams depicted in green backgrounds qualified for the semi-finals.

===Semi-finals===


===Final===


This was the first World Cup final to be a repeat: the sides previously met in the 1996 World Cup final, which Sri Lanka won. Australia had won every World Cup match against Sri Lanka apart from that loss. The match was Sri Lanka&#x27;s second World Cup final appearance, and Australia&#x27;s fourth in a row and sixth overall.
Australian captain Ricky Ponting won the toss and elected to bat. However, the start of play was delayed due to rain, and the match was reduced to 38 overs per side. Wicketkeeper Adam Gilchrist played an innings of 149 – the highest for any batsman in a World Cup final – to give Australia an imposing total going in at the break.

While Sri Lankan batsmen Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya were adding 116 for the second wicket, the contest was alive, but after the pair got out, Sri Lanka&#x27;s chances slowly diminished. Further rain forced the reduction of Sri Lanka&#x27;s innings to just 36 overs, with the target revised to 269. At the end of the 33rd over, with Sri Lanka still trailing the adjusted Duckworth-Lewis target by 37 runs, the umpires suspended the game due to bad light. While Australia&#x27;s players began to celebrate their victory (since the minimum 20 overs had been reached), the umpires incorrectly announced that because the match was suspended due to light and not rain, the final three overs would have to be bowled the following day. With Sri Lanka needing 61 runs from 18 deliveries, Sri Lankan captain Mahela Jayawardene agreed there was no need to return the following day, and instructed his team to resume batting; Ponting agreed to play only spin bowlers. The last three overs were played in almost complete darkness, during which Sri Lanka added just nine runs to give Australia a 53-run victory by the D-L method. The umpires later apologised for their error, saying that the match should have ended then with Australia winning by 37 runs.
Australia won the tournament undefeated, extending their streak of World Cup matches without a loss to 29. Australian bowler Glenn McGrath was named &#x27;Player of the Series&#x27; and retired from all forms of international cricket.

==Controversies==
===Death of Bob Woolmer===
Pakistan coach Bob Woolmer was found dead on 18 March 2007, one day after his team&#x27;s defeat to Ireland put them out of the running for the World Cup. Jamaican police performed an autopsy which was deemed inconclusive. The following day police announced that the death was suspicious and ordered a full investigation. Further investigation revealed the cause of death was &quot;manual strangulation&quot;, and that the investigation would be handled as a murder. After a lengthy investigation the Jamaican police rescinded the comments that he was murdered, and confirmed that he died from natural causes. In November 2007, an open verdict was returned.

===Criticism===
The 2007 World Cup organisers were criticised early on for being over-commercialised and, in particular, the generally smaller crowds have been blamed on the ICC&#x27;s security restrictions on things such as outside food, signs, replica kits, and musical instruments, despite Caribbean cricketing customs, as well as the authorities being accused of &quot;running [cricket and cricketing traditions] out of town, then sanitising it out of existence&quot;. Sir Viv Richards echoed the concerns. The ICC were also condemned for high prices of tickets and concessions, which were considered unaffordable for the local population in many of the locations. ICC CEO, Malcolm Speed, said that the ICC recognised the problem but said it was the local organisers&#x27; fault. However, the later matches had more crowds as the tournament progressed with the local organisers easing restrictions. Although it did not meet the target of US$42 million, the US$32 million revenue from ticket sales was the highest of any Cricket World Cup and double that of the previous World Cup.

The World Cup was also criticised by the BCCI for its format because India failed to move on from the group stage after losing two of their three matches. The BCCI later claimed it would see to it that the ICC alter its format for the 2011 Cricket World Cup. The elimination of both India and Pakistan also caused a large exodus of subcontinental fans from the Caribbean, and removed the prospect of an India vs Pakistan Super Eights match, generally considered as the most revenue generating and electric match in the tournament.

The tournament was also criticised as being too long. At 6 weeks, it was the same length as the 2003 World Cup, but longer than the 5-week 1999 World Cup and the 4-week 1996 World Cup. The famous West Indian fast bowler Michael Holding also criticised the qualification process for the 2007 World Cup. Holding expressed doubts over the benefit to less-established teams of turning up and being heavily defeated. However, former Scotland captain George Salmond claims that the opportunity to play one-day cricket against the bigger teams is invaluable for smaller teams such as his own, and questioned the validity of Holding&#x27;s statements. The majority of the experts and players participating in the tournament backed up the smaller teams taking part in the World Cup. This was further backed up with Ireland and Bangladesh making the Super 8s and being competitive and sportsmanlike throughout the tournament.

During the Pakistan and Canada warm-up match at Sir Frank Worrell Memorial Ground, the sight screen was knocked down and the game was delayed by over 70 minutes and reduced to 48 overs. Additionally, a tear gas canister exploded at the Trinidad hotel where the Pakistan, South Africa, Canada and Ireland teams were staying. The hotel had to be evacuated but no injuries were reported.

A number of concerns were expressed regarding the conditions of the pitches for the warm-up matches. During the Pakistan and South Africa warm-up game, the teams were unhappy with the condition of the pitch, claiming irregular bounce off the wicket was &quot;treacherous&quot;. In addition, a number of teams expressed concern over the slow wickets used during the warm-up matches, although &quot;Cricinfo&quot; writer Sambit Bal welcomed the pitches slowing down as a method of making the battle between the batsmen and the bowlers more equal.

Further criticism was generated by the confusion at the end of the final match: the umpires announced that play was suspended due to bad light, which caused the Australian team to erupt in celebration as the scoreboard and official announcements declared Australia the winners. However, the umpires incorrectly insisted that the game was only suspended and not completed, and that 3 overs remained to be played, so in farcical light conditions, Sri Lanka batted out the remaining 3 overs following a gentleman&#x27;s agreement between the two captains. The umpires and the ICC apologised for the unnecessary situation and cited it as an unnecessary fundamental error due to the pressure of the situation. In June, the ICC announced that the officials involved – onfield umpires Steve Bucknor and Aleem Dar, reserve umpires Rudi Koertzen and Billy Bowden, and match referee Jeff Crowe – would all be suspended from the 2007 Twenty20 World Championship.

===Preparation problems===
A number of preparation problems surfaced before the start of the World Cup. Some of the venues were not complete by the opening ceremony on 11 March 2007. At Sabina Park, seats had to be removed at the newly constructed north-stand due to safety concerns. At Trelawny Stadium in Jamaica, ground staff were unable to gain admission to the ground during the warm-up matches due to accreditation problems. Additionally, South Africa and Australia both expressed concerns over practice facilities.

Ultimately none of the stadia used in the warm-up games were used in any other part of the tournament except for the Greenfield Stadium in Trelawny, Jamaica, which hosted the opening ceremony but no matches.

==Media coverage==
The World Cup had grown as a media event with each tournament. The sponsorship and television rights that were awarded primarily to cover the 2003 and 2007 World Cups raised over US$550 million. The 2007 World Cup was televised in over 200 countries to a viewing audience estimated at more than two billion viewers and was expected to generate more than 100,000 unique visitors to the West Indies travelling solely for the tournament.

The 2007 Cricket World Cup featured an orange, anthropomorphic raccoon-like creature named &quot;Mello&quot; as its mascot. It was announced during matches that Mello had no race, species, age or gender – it was an attitude, the attitude of the young people of the West Indies. The official song for the World Cup was &quot;The Game of Love and Unity&quot; by Jamaican-born Shaggy, Barbadian entertainer Rupee, and Trinidadian Fay-Ann Lyons.

The 2007 tournament recorded the highest ticket sales for a Cricket World Cup, selling more than 672,000. Attendance leading into the semi-finals for the 2007 World Cup was 403,000, an average of 8,500 supporters per match.

<text>Jacques Marquette, S.J. (; June 1, 1637 – May 18, 1675), sometimes known as Père Marquette or James Marquette, was a French Jesuit missionary who founded Michigan&#x27;s first European settlement, Sault Sainte Marie, and later founded Saint Ignace. In 1673, Marquette, with Louis Jolliet, an explorer born near Quebec City, was the first European to explore and map the northern portion of the Mississippi River Valley.

==Early life==
Jacques Marquette was born in Laon, France, on June 1, 1637. He was the third of six children for Rose de la Salle and Nicolas Marquette. The de la Salles were a wealthy merchant family. The Marquette family had been well-respected for many years, as numerous members had served in the military and taken civil posts. 

Jacques Marquette was sent to study at the Jesuit College in Reims at age 9. He remained there until he joined the Society of Jesus at age 17. Marquette taught for a year at Auxerre, then studied philosophy at Ponta Mousson until 1659. He taught at Ponta Mousson, Reims, Charleville, and Langres until 1665. 

Throughout this time, Marquette sent multiple requests to be sent on missionary work. The superior of the Jesuit mission in New France, Father Jerome Lalemant, needed missionaries to work with the Five Nations. Marquette was ordained on the Feast of Saint Thomas of Aquinas in Toul on March 7, 1666. Months later, on September 20, he arrived in Quebec.

== Missionary work ==
Marquette was first sent to the mission of Saint Michel at Sillery. Because this mission served peaceful and friendly indigenous people from different tribes, it was considered an ideal place for training new missionaries. Marquette studied the languages and customs of the Algonquin, Abenaki, and Iroquois people that he often tended to at Sillery. 

From there, he was assigned to Trois-Rivières on the Saint Lawrence River, where he assisted Gabriel Druillettes. This mission was located in a river town that had permanent shops and taverns. A large number of French soldiers were stationed in the town, as there were frequent attacks from the Five Nations. During his two years at this mission, Marquette devoted himself to the study of the local languages and became fluent in six different dialects.

In 1668, Marquette was moved by his superiors to missions farther up the Saint Lawrence River, then into the western Great Lakes region. That year, he helped Druillettes, Brother Louis Broeme, and Father Claude-Jean Allouez found the mission at Sault Ste. Marie in present-day Michigan. The missionaries planted crops, then built a chapel and barns. They established friendly relationships with the Ottawa and Chippewa that were inhabiting that area, and were allowed to baptize most of the infants and people who were dying. Marquette noted that the Chippewa were great businessmen and exceptionally skilled at catching whitefish from the rapids in the St. Marys River.

People from many tribes would travel to purchase the whitefish. Marquette and the other missionaries would explain their faith to the visiting Sioux, Cree, Miami, Potawatomi, Illinois, and Menominee. They hoped that these visitors would be interested in getting their own Jesuit missionary, or &quot;Black Robe,&quot; as they were called by the indigenous people. In 1669, Marquette was assigned to replace Allouez at the La Pointe du Saint Esprit mission. Father Claude Dablon arrived to continue and expand the missionary work at Sault Ste. Marie.

Marquette began the 500-mile journey to his new assignment in August, travelling by canoe along the south shore of Lake Superior. The party soon encountered wintry conditions on the lake and were often unable to light a fire when they went ashore at night. The party reached their destination on September 13, and were greeted by the Petun Huron. Excited to have a Black Robe again, they quickly assembled a banquet.

In addition to the Petun Huron, Marquette was tasked with missionary work for three bands of Ottawa: the Keinouche, Sinagaux, and Kiskakon. Marquette visited and attended to all four settlements. Since he felt the Kiskakon were the most ready to accept Christianity, he spent more time working with them and even lived with the families in their village.

During his time at La Pointe, Marquette encountered members of the Illinois tribes, who told him about the important trading route of the Mississippi River. They invited him to come to their village and teach their people, whose settlements were mostly farther south. Marquette was eager to explore this river and asked for permission to take a leave from missionary work, but he first had to attend to an urgent matter.

The Hurons and Ottawa at La Pointe had begun fighting with the neighboring Lakota people. Because he feared an attack by the Lakota, Marquette felt it was necessary to find a new place for the mission. Dablon agreed that a new mission was necessary and offered to find a location. Some of the men wanted to stay and fight. Marquette attempted to discourage the imminent war, but most of the men maintained their position. He promised those who wanted to avoid the war that he would take them to a new mission and told them to prepare to move east. 

In the spring of 1671, Marquette and his party began their journey to the new St. Ignace Mission. The canoes were loaded with men, women, children, animals, and personal belongings. They travelled through Lake Superior and down to the Straits of Mackinac The mission that Dablon had established for them was located on Mackinac Island. The group would be welcomed by a small group of Ottawa who already inhabited the island. Shortly after the new residents arrived on the island, they became worried about the possibility of winter starvation. They had noticed that game was scarce and no corn had grown. A group of elders approached Marquette with these concerns, and Marquette agreed. In the fall, the mission was moved to the mainland at St. Ignace, Michigan.

==Explorations==

Marquette&#x27;s request to take a leave from missionary work to explore the great river was granted in 1673. Marquette joined the expedition of Louis Jolliet, a French-Canadian explorer. They departed from Saint Ignace on May 17, with two canoes and five voyageurs of French-Indian ancestry. Four of these are known to be: Jacques Largillier, Jean Plattier, Pierre Moreau, and Jean Tiberge. They travelled through Lake Huron and Lake Michigan and into Green Bay. 

This is where the party made their first encounter with indigenous people. They met the Menominee, who were known as the &quot;wild rice&quot; people. Marquette told them of his mission to spread religion to the people along the river. The Menominee tried to discourage Marquette and the others, warning them about the perils of the river and the people inhabiting the land along it. 

The group of explorers next went up the Fox River, nearly to its headwaters. They came upon a village inhabited by Miami, Mascouten, and Kickapoo. They allowed Marquette to teach them about Christianity, and listened attentively. He was especially impressed by the Miami. Marquette noted that they were pleasant in appearance and temperament, despite their reputation as warriors. When Marquette&#x27;s party left the village, they were accompanied by two Miami that would assist them in finding their way to the Wisconsin River. From the Fox River, the Miami directed, and likely assisted, the men in portaging their canoes for almost two miles through marsh and oak plains to the Wisconsin River, Many years later, the town of Portage, Wisconsin was built and named for the ancient path between the two rivers. They ventured forth from the portage and entered the Mississippi near present-day Prairie du Chien, Wisconsin on June 17. 

Eight days later, the travelers found footprints near the Des Moines River and went to investigate. They were enthusiastically greeted by the Peoria who lived nearby in three small villages. Marquette and the others were welcomed by the elders, who offered accommodations and had a banquet prepared. The men were offered many gifts by the Peoria. Since Marquette and the men were traveling, they had to decline the most of what was offered. Marquette did accept a calumet that was gifted to him by the chief. The chief explained that it was a symbol of peace and advised Marquette to display it as an indication of his amicable intentions. As the men left the village, the Peoria chief cautioned them against going too much farther south. 

As the party continued south, Marquette hoped to find the Chanouananons. They were known to be friendly to French, and Marquette felt they may be interested in Christianity. They did not find the Chanouananons, but Marquette did notice iron in the Wabash area. Once the summer heat and mosquitoes began to cause great discomfort, the men stopped going ashore at night. They slept in the canoes, using the sails as protection from mosquitoes. This attracted the attention of some Native Americans, who pointed guns at the travelers. Marquette held the calumet over his head. He attempted to communicate by speaking Huron, but was unsuccessful. He felt they may have misunderstood the intentions of the men with guns, and that they may have been inviting them to their village. Marquette was correct. He and the other men followed them to their village, where they were fed beef and white plums. 

At the mouth of the Saint Francis River, the men spotted a village. They heard war cries and saw men jumping into the river, trying to get to them. Marquette held the calumet over his head. The elders standing on shore saw this, and called off the attack. The men were invited to the village of the Michigamea. One of the Michigamea was able to speak to Marquette in the Miami Illinois language, but most of the communication was done through gestures. The men were fed fish and corn stew, then given a place to sleep for the night. 

In the morning, Michigamea warriors in dugout canoes escorted them to the Akansea Quapaw. They were greeted by a group of men in canoes who held up their own calumet. Marquette and the others were invited to the village. Many residents came out to see the Frenchmen. A chief led them to a room where elders and other chiefs had gathered. Marquette used an interpreter to ask about what was south of them. He was told that it was extremely dangerous. The people were hostile, well-armed, and would attack anyone who could interfere with their trading arrangements. 
The Jolliet-Marquette expedition had traveled to within of the Gulf of Mexico. Marquette and the other men began to consider whether the danger was worth the risk. By this point, they had encountered several natives carrying European trinkets, and they feared an encounter with explorers or colonists from Spain. The explorers had mapped the areas where they had been, including their flora, wildlife, and resources. After staying with the Akansea for two nights, the party decided to end the exploration. 

On July 17, they turned back at the mouth of the Arkansas River. They followed the Mississippi back to the mouth of the Illinois River, which they had learned from local natives provided a shorter route back to the Great Lakes. They reached Lake Michigan near the site of modern-day Chicago, by way of the Chicago Portage. The party encountered a village of Kaskaskia, who invited Marquette to return and establish a mission. When the explorers left the village, some of the Kaskaskia got in their own canoes and traveled with them to Saint Francis Xavier mission in Green Bay, Wisconsin. Jolliet returned to Quebec to relate the news of their discoveries.
Marquette and his party returned to the Illinois territory in late 1674, becoming the first Europeans to winter in what would become the city of Chicago. As welcomed guests of the Illinois Confederation, the explorers were feasted &quot;en route&quot; and fed ceremonial foods such as sagamite. As Marquette had promised, he established The Immaculate Conception mission for the Kaskaskia.

==Death==
In the spring of 1675, Marquette traveled westward and celebrated a public Mass at the Grand Village of the Illinois near Starved Rock. A bout of dysentery he had contracted during the Mississippi expedition sapped his health. On the return trip to Saint Ignace, he died at 37 years of age near the modern-day town of Ludington, Michigan. His companions, Pierre Porteret and Jacques Largillier, buried his body at a spot that Marquette had chosen. They marked his burial site with a large cross. Porteret and Lagrillier continued on to St. Ignace, so they could inform those at the mission. 

Two years later, Kiskakon Ottawa from the Saint Ignace mission found Marquette&#x27;s gravesite. They cleaned his bones in preparation for their journey. Ottawa and Huron, in about thirty canoes, accompanied them back to the mission. Marquette&#x27;s remains were presented to Fathers Nouvel and Piercon. They led funeral services before burying his bones in the chapel at Mission Saint-Ignace on June 9, 1677.

In 2018, residents of St. Ignace, some of them descendants of those led by Marquette to the mission, became aware that an ounce of Marquette&#x27;s bones was located at Marquette University. Talks between the residents and the university began. The Museum of Ojibwe Culture sent a formal request for the return of the bones. This request was accepted by Marquette University. Two Native American men, one an Anishinaabe elder, arrived at the university in March of 2022. They were presented with Marquette&#x27;s bones, which they placed in a birch box for the return to St. Ignace. Following a ceremony, the bones retrieved from the university were reburied with the rest of Marquette&#x27;s bones on June 18, 2022.

A Michigan Historical Marker in Ludington, MI reads:
Adjacent to gravesite of Marquette on State Street in downtown Saint Ignace, a building was constructed that now houses the Museum of Ojibwa Culture.

<text>Gaetano Alibrandi (14 January 1914 – 3 July 2003) of the Roman Catholic Church was a senior papal diplomat and former Personal Secretary to Giovanni Battista Cardinal Montini (later Pope Paul VI). 

==Biography==
Born at Castiglione di Sicilia in the Province of Catania, Sicily, Alibrandi was ordained priest on 1 November 1936 and obtained a Doctorate on Divinity from the Pontifical Lateran University and a Doctorate on Civil and Canon Law. He entered the Diplomatic Corps of the Holy See in 1941, serving for five years in the Vatican Secretariat of State and was then a staff member in the apostolic nunciatures in Italy and Turkey before coming to Ireland as a counsellor at the Apostolic Nunciature for two years from 1954–6. Alibrandi later described his first Irish posting as ‘a spiritual bath.’

==Ordained Archbishop==

In 1961 he received episcopal consecration as titular Archbishop of Binda by Fernando Cardinal Cento upon his appointment as Nuncio of Chile (1961), followed quickly by similar appointments in Lebanon (1963). As Apostolic Nuncio to Chile, he led the Chilean delegation to the Second Vatican Council.

==Nuncio to Ireland==

He was appointed Papal Nuncio to Ireland on 19 April 1969, shortly after the outbreak of the Troubles. 

This was a challenging time for the Church in Ireland then led by Cardinal William Conway as it adjusted to both the internal changes generated by the Second Vatican Council and the wider social changes. Alibrandi was ill-suited to coping with these changes and in particular the violence in Northern Ireland. It is widely assumed that he saw to it that the more overtly nationalist Tomas Ó Fiaich was appointed to Armagh in 1977 after the death of Cardinal Conway. The journalist and author Ed Moloney in his book on the IRA asserts that Alibrandi&#x27;s &quot;sympathy for the IRA was a constant source of friction with the government in London.&quot;

Alibrani played a major role in the 1971 decision by the Vatican to accept the resignation of John Charles McQuaid as archbishop of Dublin (to the shock of McQuaid, who expected that he would be allowed to remain for some time after the normal retirement age of 75). 

In many of the episcopal appointments made while Alibrandi was nuncio, he favoured doctrinally &#x27;sound&#x27;, right-of-centre priests and in the case of the Archdiocese of Dublin picked two priests Kevin McNamara and Desmond Connell who were notably ill-suited. In a profile of the Archbishop at the time of his retirement T.P. O&#x27;Mahony observed in The Tablet &quot;although he rarely gave interviews, and never overtly intervened in policy-making or in public controversies, it is beyond dispute that Archbishop Alibrandi wielded considerable influence behind the scenes.&quot; 

The respected academic and church historian Dermot Keogh assessing this period argues that &quot;there was a general view that the best candidates had not been appointed...that a number were not up to the job, that most of the appointees shared a defensive attitude to matters of church and state. The Church Confronts Modernity: Catholicism Since 1950 in the United States, Ireland, and Quebec

He had “a very testy relationship with three Taoisigh – Jack Lynch, Liam Cosgrave and Garret FitzGerald”.
It was reported in September 2012 during the second Dr Garret FitzGerald Memorial Lecture at University College Cork by Seán Donlon, former secretary general at the Department of Foreign Affairs, that &quot;It came to our [Department of Foreign Affairs] attention that a substantial amount in three bank accounts in Dublin [held by the archbishop] were way in excess of what was needed to run the nunciature. The source [of the money] appeared to be South America.&quot; Donlon went on to say &quot;Because of its size, we thought it appropriate to ask if the funds belonged to the Holy See&quot;. When contacted for an answer, Dr Alibrandi &quot;quickly answered ‘no’ and that they belonged to ‘family’. When it was pointed out to him that the money was then liable under Irish taxation law to DIRT, he said he would retire shortly and the accounts would be closed.&quot;

<text>Cold medicines are a group of medications taken individually or in combination as a treatment for the symptoms of the common cold and similar conditions of the upper respiratory tract. The term encompasses a broad array of drugs, including analgesics, antihistamines and decongestants, among many others. It also includes drugs which are marketed as cough suppressants or antitussives, but their effectiveness in reducing cough symptoms is unclear or minimal.

While they have been used by 10% of American children in any given week, they are not recommended in Canada or the United States in children six years or younger because of lack of evidence showing effect and concerns of harm.

==Types==
There are a number of different cough and cold medications, which may be used for various coughing symptoms. The commercially available products may include various combinations of any one or more of the following types of substances:
* Mucokinetics, or mucolytics, are a class of drugs which aid in the clearance of mucus from the airways, lungs, bronchi, and trachea. Examples are carbocisteine, ambroxol, and bromhexine.
* Expectorants are substances claimed to make coughing easier while enhancing the production of mucus and phlegm. Two examples are acetylcysteine and guaifenesin.
* Antitussives, or cough suppressants, are substances which suppress the coughing itself. Examples are dextromethorphan, benzonatate, codeine, hydrocodone, pholcodine, noscapine, cloperastine, and butamirate.
* Antihistamines, for allergic rhinitis, may produce mild sedation and reduce other associated symptoms, like a runny nose and watery eyes. Examples are diphenhydramine, chlorpheniramine, brompheniramine, loratadine, and cetirizine.
* Decongestants may improve nasal congestion in sinus infections. Examples are ephedrine, phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine, and oxymetazoline.
* Fever or pain medication. Examples are paracetamol (acetaminophen) and NSAIDs such as ibuprofen or naproxen.
* Also employed are various substances supposed to soften the coughing, like honey or supplement syrup.

An example combination is guaifenesin with codeine.

== Effectiveness ==
The efficacy of cough medication is questionable, particularly in children. A 2014 Cochrane review concluded that &quot;There is no good evidence for or against the effectiveness of OTC [over the counter] medicines in acute cough&quot;. Some cough medicines may be no more effective than placebos for acute coughs in adults, including coughs related to upper respiratory tract infections. The American College of Chest Physicians emphasizes that cough medicines are not designed to treat whooping cough, a cough that is caused by bacteria and can last for months. No over-the-counter cough medicines have been found to be effective in cases of pneumonia. They are not recommended in those who have COPD, chronic bronchitis, or the common cold. There is not enough evidence to make recommendations for those who have a cough in cancer.

===Medications===
* Dextromethorphan (DXM) may be modestly effective in decreasing cough in adults with viral upper respiratory infections. However, in children, it has not been found to be effective.
* Codeine was once viewed as the &quot;gold standard&quot; in cough suppressants, but this position is now questioned. Some placebo-controlled trials have found that it is ineffective against some forms of cough, including acute cough in children. It is thus not recommended for children. Additionally, there is no evidence that hydrocodone is useful in children. Similarly, a 2012 Dutch guideline does not recommend its use to treat acute cough.
* A number of other commercially available cough treatments have not been shown to be effective in viral upper respiratory infections. These include for adults: antihistamines, antihistamine-decongestant combinations, benzonatate, anti asthmatic-expectorant-mucolytic combinations, expectorant-bronchodilator combinations, leukotriene inhibitors, ambroxol, and guaifenesin, sometimes with analgesics, antipyretics, anti inflammatories, and anticholinergics; and for children: antihistamines, decongestants for clearing the nose, or combinations of these and leukotriene inhibitors for allergy and asthma. However, antihistamines cannot be used as an empirical therapy in case of chronic, or non-specific cough, especially in very young children. Long term diphenhydramine use is associated with negative outcomes in older people.

===Alternative medicine===
A small study found honey may be a minimally effective cough treatment due to &quot;well-established antioxidant and antimicrobial effects&quot; and a tendency to soothe irritated tissue. A Cochrane review found there was weak evidence to recommend for or against the use of honey in children as a cough remedy. In light of these findings, the Cochrane study found honey was better than no treatment, placebo, or diphenhydramine but not better than dextromethorphan for relieving cough symptoms. Honey&#x27;s use as a cough treatment has been linked on several occasions to infantile botulism and accordingly should not be used in children less than one year old.

Many alternative treatments are used to treat the common cold, though data on effectiveness is generally limited. A 2007 review states that, &quot;alternative therapies (i.e., Echinacea, vitamin C, and zinc) are not recommended for treating common cold symptoms; however...Vitamin C prophylaxis may modestly reduce the duration and severity of the common cold in the general population and may reduce the incidence of the illness in persons exposed to physical and environmental stresses.&quot; A 2014 review also found insufficient evidence for Echinacea, where no clinical relevance was proven to provide benefit for treating the common cold, despite a weak benefit for positive trends. Similarly, a 2014 systematic review showed that garlic may prevent occurrences of the common cold but there was insufficient evidence of garlic in treating the common cold and studies reported adverse effects of a rash and odour. Therefore, more research needs to be done to prove that the benefits outweigh the harms.

Evidence supporting the effectiveness of zinc is mixed with respect to cough. Zinc &quot;administered within 24 hours of onset of symptoms reduces the duration of common cold symptoms in healthy people&quot;. A 2003 review concluded: &quot;Clinical trial data support the value of zinc in reducing the duration and severity of symptoms of the common cold when administered within 24 hours of the onset of common cold symptoms.&quot; Zinc gel in the nose may lead to long-term or permanent loss of smell. The FDA therefore discourages its use.

===Recreational usage===

Cough medicines, especially those containing dextromethorphan and codeine, are often abused as recreational drugs. Abuse may result in hallucinations, loss of consciousness and death. Many cough syrups can contain acetaminophen which will cause liver damage in recreational users. 

==Adverse effects==
A number of accidental overdoses and well-documented adverse effects suggested caution in children. The FDA in 2015 warned that the use of codeine-containing cough medication in children may cause breathing problems. Cold syrup overdose has been linked to visual and auditory hallucinations as well as rapid involuntary jaw, tongue, and eye movements in children.

Decongestants are possibly harmful to people with high blood pressure or a heart disease because these substances can constrict the blood vessels.

== History ==
Heroin was originally marketed as a cough suppressant in 1898. It was, at the time, believed to be a non-addictive alternative to other opiate-containing cough syrups. This was quickly realized not to be true as heroin readily breaks down into morphine in the body. Morphine was already known to be addictive.

==Society and culture==

===Brands===
Some brand names include: Benylin, Sudafed, Robitussin and Vicks among others. Most contain a number of active ingredients. The Thai company Hatakabb produces the Takabb Anti-Cough Pill, which is a Chinese herbal medication.

Sudafed is a brand manufactured by McNeil Laboratories. The original formulation contains the active ingredient pseudoephedrine, but formulations without pseudoephedrine are also being sold under the brand. In 2016, it was one of the biggest selling branded over-the-counter medications sold in Great Britain, with sales of £34.4 million. The effectiveness of phenylephrine by mouth as a nasal decongestant is questionable.

Gee&#x27;s Linctus is a cough medicine which contains opium tincture. New Zealand in 2019 moved it to prescription only.

Coricidin, Coricidin D, or Coricidin HBP, is the brand name of a combination of dextromethorphan and chlorpheniramine maleate (an antihistamine). Varieties may also contain acetaminophen and guaifenesin.

Codral is a brand name manufactured by Johnson &amp; Johnson and sold primarily in Australia and New Zealand. Codral is the highest-selling cold and flu medication in Australia.
===Economics===
In the United States, several billion dollars are spent on over-the-counter products per year.

===Poisoning===
According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, at least eight mass poisonings have occurred as a result of counterfeit cough syrup in which medical-grade glycerin has been replaced with diethylene glycol, an inexpensive, yet toxic, glycerin substitute marketed for industrial use. In May 2007, 365 deaths were reported in Panama, which were associated with cough syrup containing diethylene glycol. In 2022, the deaths of 66 children in The Gambia were linked to four pediatric cough syrup medications that contained diethylene glycol and ethylene glycol.

In 2022, the US Food and Drug Administration issued a warning against cooking foods in cough syrup after a video of someone preparing &quot;NyQuil chicken&quot;, sometimes also called &quot;sleepy chicken&quot;, became popular on social media. Cough syrup is designed to be stored at room temperature and its properties can change when it is heated, making it potentially deadly. Heated cough syrup can also vaporize, leading to inhalation hazards. The warning received attention from many news outlets, but some criticized the FDA&#x27;s handling of the issue for amplifying the attention the topic received online and questioned if making and eating NyQuil chicken actually existed as a widespread trend.

<text>Sentosa Island, known mononymously as Sentosa, is an island located off the southern coast of Singapore&#x27;s main island. The island is separated from the main island of Singapore by a channel of water, the Keppel Harbour, and is adjacent to Pulau Brani, a smaller island wedged between Sentosa and the main island.

Formerly used as a British military base and afterwards as a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp, the island was renamed Sentosa in the 1970s to become a popular tourist destination. It is now home to a popular resort that receives up to 25 million visitors per year. Attractions include a long sheltered beach, Madame Tussauds Singapore, an extensive cable car network, Fort Siloso, two golf courses, 14 hotels as well as the Resorts World Sentosa, which features the Universal Studios Singapore theme park and one of Singapore&#x27;s two casinos, the other being in Marina Bay Sands.

Sentosa is also widely known as being the location of the 2018 North Korea–United States Singapore Summit, where North Korean Chairman Kim Jong-un and U.S. President Donald Trump met at the Capella Singapore located on the island. This was the first-ever meeting between the leaders of North Korea and the United States. As an island geared towards recreation and tourism with its casino and resorts under a tropical climate, as well as residences for the wealthy, Sentosa is more than twice the size of Monaco.

==Etymology==

The name &quot;Sentosa&quot; translates to &quot;peace and tranquility&quot; in Malay, which was in turn derived from the Sanskrit term &quot;Santosha&quot;, meaning &quot;contentment, satisfaction&quot;. Sentosa was formerly known as Pulau Blakang Mati
which in Malay means the &quot;Island of Death Behind&quot;.

The name &quot;Blakang Mati&quot; is old; an island was identified as &quot;Blacan Mati&quot; in Manuel Godinho de Erédia&#x27;s 1604 map of Singapore. Other early references to the island of Belakang Mati include &quot;Burne Beard Island&quot; in Wilde&#x27;s 1780 MS map, &quot;Pulau Niry&quot;, &quot;Nirifa&quot; from 1690 to 1700, and the nineteenth century reference as &quot;Pulau Panjang&quot; (J.H. Moor). However, early maps did not separate Blakang Mati from the adjacent island of Pulau Brani, so it is uncertain to which island the seventeenth century place names referred.

The island has changed name several times. Up to 1830, it was called Pulau Panjang (&quot;long island&quot;). In an 1828 sketch of Singapore Island, the island is referred to as &quot;Po. Panjang&quot;. According to Bennett (1834), the name Blakang Mati was only given to the hill on the island by the Malay villagers on the island. The Malay name for this island is literally translated as &quot;dead back&quot; or &quot;behind the dead&quot;; &quot;belakang&quot; means &quot;at the back&quot; or &quot;behind&quot; or &quot;after&quot;; &quot;mati&quot; means &quot;dead&quot;. It is also called the &quot;dead island&quot; or the &quot;island of the dead&quot; or perhaps &quot;island of after death&quot;.

There are a number of different suggestions on how the island came to acquire such an unpropitious name:
*One account attributed the ominous name to murder and piracy in the island&#x27;s past. 
*A second claimed that the island is the material paradise for the spirits of warriors said to have been buried at Pulau Brani.
*A third account claims that an outbreak of disease on the island in the late 1840s almost wiped out the original Bugis settlers on the island. Dr Robert Little, a British coroner investigating the deaths, stumbled upon what was called Belakang Mati Fever, purportedly a type of fever caused by miasmastic fumes arising from decaying leaves and swampy water on the island. This led to a controversy in medical circles at that time as to the causes of this disease. The disease was later recognised in 1898 as malaria spread by the &quot;Anopheles&quot; mosquito. The government&#x27;s malaria research station was originally located here.
*A fourth interpretation is that &quot;dead back island&quot; was so-called because of the lack of fertile soil on the hills. However, since the island creates an area of dead water behind it with no wind (hence &quot;still behind&quot; - still or stopped being an alternative translation of mati) it may be as simple as this — less romantic perhaps, but believable from a nautical viewpoint.
In 1827, Captain Edward Lake of the Bengal Engineer Group in his report on public works and fortifications had proposed an alternative name for Belakang Mati as the &quot;Island of St George&quot;. However, the island was seen as too unhealthy for habitation and his proposed name was never realised.
In a 1972 contest organised by the Singapore Tourist Promotion Board, the island was renamed &quot;Sentosa&quot;, a Malay word meaning &quot;peace and tranquility&quot;, from Sanskrit, &quot;Santosha&quot;.

==History==
===Early period===

====Pulau Blakang Mati====

&quot;Pulau Blakang Mati&quot; was once home to the native Malays who were relocated to the mainland, together with the Pulau Brani villagers, due to urban redevelopment in the late 1970s. In the nineteenth century, the island was considered important because it protected the passage into Keppel Harbour. Plans to fortify the island as part of the defence plan for Singapore were drawn up as early as 1827, but few fortifications actually materialised until the 1880s, when the rapid growth of the harbour led to concern over the protection of coal stocks against enemy attack. The four forts built on the island were Fort Siloso, Fort Serapong, Fort Connaught and the Mount Imbiah Battery.

==== Fort Siloso and Sarang Rimau ====
The western end of Pulau Blakang Mati, the place where Fort Siloso is now, used to be called &quot;sarang rimau&quot; (the tiger&#x27;s den). &quot;Selusuh&quot; is a kind of herb used as a remedy in childbirth, but there is no explanation of how the fort came to be so called, the &quot;orang laut&quot; of Kampong Kopit only knowing the place by the name of &quot;sarang rimau&quot;. By the 1930s, the island was heavily fortified and a crucial component of Fortress Singapore, and the base of the Royal Artillery.

==== Fort Connaught ====
&quot;Fort Connaught&quot;, on eastern side of Sentosa island, was earlier called &quot;Belakang Mati East Battery&quot; which was constructed in 1878. It had ammunition similar to Fort Siloso, with three Mark I 7 Inch RML Guns of tons and two RML 64-pounder 64 cwt guns. In 1890 it was renamed the Fort Connaught to mark the visit of Duke of Connaught. In 1930s, fort was rebuilt and three Mark X 9·2-Inch Guns on 30° Mark VII Mountings with better range replaced the older firepower. On Mount Serapong, an underground Battery Plotting Room was constructed on the northern side and a Battery Observation Post on top of the hill. In 1942, during WWII, British forces at this fort exhausted their ammunition, and guns were tempered and disabled before the British surrendered to Japanese forces. A significant part of Mount Serapong was removed and it made way for the present day &quot;Tanjong Golf Course&quot;, due to which a major part of the fort was destroyed. Presently few remains of the fort can still be seen in the extreme east corner of the Tanjong Golf Course, namely observation tower in the northeast corner of golf course near Allenbrooke road, then to the south of it are gun number 3, gun number 2 and engine room, and finally gun number 1 - all short distance from each other.

====Fort Serapong====
&quot;Fort Serapong&quot;, Fort Siloso, Fort Connaught and Imbiah Battery were constructed on Sentosa island in 1870 to form the southern defence of Singapore. Presently only 20% of the original fort has been discovered.
 Ruins are reachable via Fort Serapong Road, then walking on a forested ridge which has several &quot;Danger: keep out&quot; type of signs.

===Second World War===
During the Second World War, the island was a British military fortress. The British set up large-calibre gun fortifications at various points along the island that were aligned to the south, facing the sea in expectation of a seaward Japanese assault. The myth that the guns were incapable of pointing north developed after the War but this was wrong, they could swivel to point north but they were only equipped with armour-piercing shells for ships which made the shells ineffective against land based forces. The Japanese invaded and captured Singapore from the north, after having done the same to Malaya (now known as West or Peninsular Malaysia).

Following the surrender of the Allied Forces on 15 February 1942, Fort Siloso became a prisoner of war camp, housing Australian and British prisoners of the Japanese. During the Japanese Occupation, under the Sook Ching Operation, Chinese men who were suspected, often arbitrarily, of being involved in anti-Japanese activities were brutally killed. 300 bodies, riddled with bullet wounds, washed up on the beach of Pulau Belakang Mati, and were buried by the British prisoners.

===1945–72===

After the Japanese surrender in 1945 and the return of Singapore to British rule, the island became the base of the locally enlisted First Singapore Regiment of the Royal Artillery (1st SRRA) in 1947. Other locally enlisted men from Singapore were sent to the island for basic military training before being sent to other units of the British Army in Singapore. Ten years later, the 1st SRRA was disbanded and its guns dismantled. The coast artillery was replaced with Gurkha infantry units, first the 2/7th Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s own Gurkha Rifles and later the 2/10th Princess Mary&#x27;s own Gurkha Rifles. Fort Siloso and Mount Imbiah became a religious retreat and a Protestant church house respectively. Fort Connaught was left in ruins. Fort Serapong became a secure communications and listening station.

In the early 1960s, during the Indonesian Confrontation, the 2/10th occupied the island. Even though Indonesia was in close proximity there were few amateurish attempts of direct action by the Indonesians against Singapore. The Gurkha battalion rotated on a six monthly basis to Borneo where most military action during the Confrontation took place. A significant parade took place on the island during the Confrontation to announce the award of the Victoria Cross to Rambahadur Limbu for an action in Borneo. With the end of the Confrontation in 1966 and the withdrawal of the Gurkha battalion from the island, the British handed over Sentosa to the Singapore Armed Forces of the newly independent Government of Singapore in 1967. In 1967, Pulau Belakang Mati became the base for the Singapore Naval Volunteer Force, which relocated there from its old base at Telok Ayer Basin. The School of Maritime Training was also set up there, as was the first Naval Medical Centre. It became part of the Republic of Singapore Navy. Also in 1967, Pulau Belakang Mati became the military base for the School of Field Engineers, which relocated there from Pasir Leba Camp. The Field Engineer School trained the 1st Batch of Combat Engineer Commanders who in turn trained the 1st batch of Full Time National Servicemen who were enlisted in 1968. The 1st operational Combat Engineer Battalion was also raised here. The Engineer Headquarters (EHQ) was established here 1970 before moving to Gillman Camp in 1971.

By 1967, the Singapore government had reached an agreement with Esso to build an oil refinery on the island with the intent to eventually turn the island into a petrochemical complex. However, the then-chief of the Urban Renewal Unit (the forerunner of the Urban Redevelopment Authority), Alan Choe, wanted to somehow preserve the greenery of the island. With the support of Dr Albert Winsemius, he managed to convince then-Finance Minister Goh Keng Swee and then-Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to turn the island into a tourism destination, and shift the planned Esso refinery to Jurong Island instead.

===1970s===
In the late 1960s, the government began to set out proposals for developing the island, and a contest to find a new name for the island was held in November 1969. The island was renamed &quot;Sentosa&quot; in September 1970, which means &quot;peace and tranquility&quot; in Malay (from Sanskrit, &quot;Santosha&quot;), from a suggestion by the public. In March 1971, the government announced plans to develop the island into a holiday resort for local visitors and tourists, and a S$124-million plan for developing Sentosa was unveiled in March 1972.

The Sentosa Development Corporation was formed and incorporated on 1 September 1972 to oversee the development of the island. Since then, some S$420 million of private capital and another S$500 million of government funds have been invested to develop the island.

In 1974 the Singapore Cable Car system was built, linking Sentosa to Mount Faber. Finally, in 1975, the Republic of Singapore Navy had moved out from the Sentosa to Pulau Brani Island. A series of attractions were subsequently opened for visitors including Fort Siloso, Surrender Chamber wax museum, Musical Fountain, and the Underwater World. The causeway bridge was opened in 1992 connecting Sentosa to the mainland.

The Sentosa Monorail system was opened in 1982 to transport visitors across seven stations located around the western side of the island.

===1989===
The former political prisoner and Nobel prize nominee Chia Thye Poh spent three-and-a-half years in internal exile on Sentosa after he was freed from 23 years in jail in 1989.

===2005===
On 16 March 2005, the monorail service was discontinued to make way for the new Sentosa Express, which commenced operations on 15 January 2007. An environmental assessment conducted by the government of Singapore concluded that the construction of an integrated resort on Sentosa would result in a high likelihood of high scale biodiversity loss, habitat destruction, soil erosion and climate change, as well as several other destructive ecological impacts. Therefore, over two hundred trees and plants from the area that was to be cleared for the construction of the resorts were replanted elsewhere on the island to minimize negative environmental impact.

In 2009, construction of a new footbridge began. The S$70 million Sentosa Boardwalk includes themed gardens, shops and eateries. There are covered walkways and travellators along the boardwalk for rainy days. The Boardwalk, officially opened by Singapore&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean on 29 January 2011, provides visitors with an alternative mode of travel to reach the island. Sentosa Boardwalk, designed by Aedas, was named Best Leisure Architecture in Asia Pacific and 5* Best Leisure Architecture in Singapore, at the 2014 Asia Pacific Property Awards.

===2018===
The island hosted the 2018 North Korea–United States summit between the United States President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un of North Korea on 12 June 2018, at the Capella Singapore. Sentosa island was gazetted as a &#x27;special event area&#x27; by the Singapore Government and the Capella Singapore was chosen as the venue by the White House, a week prior to the summit.

In his 2018 autobiography, Emeritus Senior Minister Goh Chok Tong revealed that, when the tourism sector was suffering, Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew made an attempt to allow a nudist resort to be built on Sentosa in order to attract tourists, but the motion was ultimately vetoed.

===2024 oil spill===
On 14 June 2024 at about 2.20pm, a dredger hit a stationary bunker vessel stationed at Pasir Panjang Terminal, causing an oil spill that spread across several Southern Islands through East Coast Park, including Palawan, Siloso and Tanjong beaches. Sentosa announced that the beaches are still available, but any water-related activities are suspended until 3 August while cleaning is underway.

==Geography==

The island has an area of close to . It lies just half a kilometre (a quarter of a mile) away from the southern coast of the main island of Singapore. It is Singapore&#x27;s fourth-largest island (excluding the main island). 70% of the island was covered by secondary rainforest, the habitat of monitor lizards, monkeys, peacocks, parrots as well as other native fauna and flora, also, when the construction of Resorts World Sentosa commenced; environmental impact was kept at a minimum when over two hundred trees in the designated area were replanted elsewhere on the island.

Further development has significantly impacted the biodiversity of the island, resulting in the loss of much of the native fauna and flora. The island also has a stretch of white sand beach, which has impacted the reef. Significantly large portions of land are currently being added to Sentosa due to land reclamation.

==Facilities==
===Transport===

====Cable Car and Mainland Buses====
Sentosa can be reached from the Singapore mainland via a short causeway or Cable Car, which originates from Mount Faber and passes through HarbourFront en route to its final destination at Imbiah Lookout. In 2015, Sentosa opened an intra-island Cable Car to facilitate travelling within the island. Dubbed the &quot;Sky Network&quot;, the Cable Car has 3 stations, in Siloso, Imbiah, and near the now-closed Merlion, and is not linked to the original Cable Car.

Public bus services are available to connect Sentosa Island to the mainland. Tong Tar Transport service RWS8 operates between VivoCity/ HarbourFront station to Resorts World Sentosa during peak hours only. On 30 July 2017, SBS Transit Bus Service 123 was extended to enhance connectivity to Resorts World Sentosa, Merlion Tower (now closed), and Beach Station Bus Terminal.

Prior to COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore, SMRT had operated Express Bus Services 188R and 963R between Choa Chu Kang and Woodlands towards Resorts World Sentosa respectively on weekends and public holidays. These bus routes were withdrawn on 7 April 2020 due to low demand.

====Sentosa Express====
The island is also accessible by the Sentosa Express monorail, which replaced the old Sentosa Monorail that operated from 1982 to 2005. The Sentosa Express has three stations on Sentosa and one on mainland Singapore. The northern terminus of the line, which opened on 15 January 2007, is located at the VivoCity shopping mall on the mainland and the southernmost terminus, Beach Station, is located on Sentosa Island. In Vivocity, the mainland MRT is in turn served by the HarbourFront of the North East Line and the Circle Line.

====Bus Terminal====
The Beach Station Bus Terminal within Sentosa serves both residents and tourists access to various amenities around Sentosa. There are two bus services serving the terminal, identified as Bus A and Bus B. SBS Transit Bus Service 123 also serves this terminal.

====Car/Foot====
Since 1998, passenger cars have been allowed to enter the island.

Visitors can also access the island via the Sentosa Boardwalk which is parallel to the causeway (which opened on 29 January 2011). The first two days of its opening were marked with free entry into Sentosa for visitors who walk, and subsequently, an SGD 1 admission fee into Sentosa is charged. From 7 June 2014 to 4 January 2015, walk-in entry into Sentosa via the Sentosa Boardwalk is free on weekends and public holidays. Walk-in has been free of charge since the end of SG50 celebrations. The Sentosa Boardwalk hosts frequent bazaars on weekends.

====Tram====
Sentosa Beach Tram is a free-to-ride tram that serves Palawan Beach, Siloso Beach, and Tanjong Beach, using four vehicles including 2 Volvo B12BLEAs, in which the second carriage is an open-top and another one with green and blue liveries. The Volvo B12BLEAs were manufactured by ComfortDelGro Engineering bodywork, which has since been taken out of service. The connection is at Beach Station Bus Terminal, beside Beach Station. 

Separately, a 3-car tram used to serve Underwater World.

An Autonomous Bus Trial was also conducted from mid-2019 to the end of 2019.

===Attractions===

====Operating attractions====

Sentosa offers a variety of attractions, museums, and other facilities. These include Universal Studios and Madame Tussauds chain of attractions, as well as a Marine Life Park, which consists of a water park and an aquarium. Most of the attractions on Sentosa are located in either Resorts World Sentosa, Imbiah Lookout, or the Sentosa Beachfront.

*Magical Shores opened on Siloso Beach in January 2020, 
*The &quot;Royal Albatross&quot; is a unique 47 m class A luxury Tall Ship (pirate ship) that is berthed behind the SEA Aquarium at Resorts World Sentosa.

It is owned and operated by Tall Ship Adventures Pte Ltd and can be chartered by the hour or day for private and corporate events. The company also sells tickets for short cruises via their website. The ship was featured as Bruce Wayne&#x27;s luxury yacht in the Batman movie &quot;The Dark Knight&quot;.
*Butterfly Park and Insect Kingdom is a landscape garden with over 15,000 live butterflies, representing more than fifty species. Housed in a cool outdoor conservatory, these butterflies range from the 25 millimetre (1 in) &quot;Eurema sari&quot; to the 150 mm (6 in) &quot;Papilio iswara&quot;. The Insect Kingdom houses some 3,000 species of rare insects from around the world, including a 160 mm &quot;Dynastes Hercules&quot; beetle.
*Wings of Time a multimedia performance which started its run on 17 June 2014 replacing previous successor show called Songs of the Sea, with pyrotechnics displays, water fountains, water screens, laser projectors, flame bursts. The show currently runs every evening once during weekdays and twice during weekends, eve of public holidays and on public holidays.
*Sentosa 4D Adventureland contains Singapore&#x27;s and Southeast Asia&#x27;s first four-dimensional theatre.

#An immersive 4-D movie - &quot;Journey 2: The Mysterious Island&quot;, based on the film starring Dwayne Johnson
#A virtual 4-D roller coaster - &quot;Extreme Log Ride&quot; 
#An interactive 4-D Shoot-Out game - &quot;Desperados&quot;
#A new 4-D experience ride - &quot;Haunted Mine&quot;
*Fort Siloso is located in the west of the island, with the guns of this preserved fort still standing. Fort Siloso was built by the British in 1880s to guard the narrow western entrance to Keppel Harbour. The fort guarded the western approaches to Singapore during World War II. By 1939 it was armed with two Mark2 guns and two rapid firing 12-pounder guns. Fort Siloso is now the only surviving coastal gun battery from the twelve such batteries that made up Fortress Singapore at the start of the war.The ammunition bunkers, barracks, tunnels, and gun emplacements of the fort are now open to visitors as a military-themed attraction. Also on display is a collection of artillery guns dating from the 17th century to World War II. Life-sized replicas of British soldiers and other people are on display to depict life at the fort. Fort Siloso is home to the country&#x27;s largest collection of World War II memorabilia, including photographs, documents and film clips. The fort also served as the place of internment for the Singaporean political prisoner Chia Thye Poh in the period 1989–1993. This attraction was once served by the Fort Siloso Monorail Station of the discontinued Sentosa Monorail. After the monorail closed in 2005, the station was repurposed to add on to this attraction. An elevated walkway, called the Fort Siloso skywalk, was opened in 2015, giving visitors an aerial view of the fort and its surrounding foliage.
*Hydrodash Sentosa is Singapore&#x27;s first inflatable water park located at Palawan Beach, officially opened in 2020. It is made up of 4 zones, zone 1 being kid&#x27;s friendly – for kids between 5–8 years old, and zone 2-4 for adults.

====Resorts World Sentosa====

This is a family-oriented Integrated Resort with a casino at its core. A resort developer and operator was chosen on 8 December 2006. The winning proposal was the Genting/Star Cruises consortium in their bid for Resorts World Sentosa. It has a Universal Studios Theme Park (known as Universal Studios Singapore) which occupies nearly half of the resort space. Development of the resort was financed privately at a cost of $SGD5.75 billion and it does not receive any government subsidies. The proposal for a casino was met with extensive opposition from many conservative critics. Nevertheless, the government has constantly reassured the public that there would be stringent measures in place to maintain the social fabric of the nation Singapore, and to prevent problems such as gambling addiction. It is also home to several celebrity chef restaurants, including Joël Robuchon, and the Ocean Restaurant by Cat Cora, which faces the open ocean display of the S.E.A. Aquarium.

The Adventure Cove waterpark offers water rides (including the Southeast Asia&#x27;s first hydro wet coaster), and marine experiences like swimming with dolphins, sharks, manta rays, as well as snorkeling in an artificial reef.

It also has a concert venue known as the Hard Rock Colosseum, which has played host to musical acts like Of Monsters and Men, Jimmy Eat World and Bastille.

On 14 February 2010 at exactly 12:18 p.m., which was also the first day of the Chinese New Year, Resorts World Sentosa was opened to the public. In Cantonese, &quot;1218&quot; sounds like &quot;prosperity&quot;, hence the opening time. The resort&#x27;s main attractions include Universal Studios Singapore, Adventure Cove water park, S.E.A. Aquarium, the Maritime Experiential Museum, &quot;The Royal Albatross&quot; and the Trick Eye Museum Singapore.

In 2019, Resorts World Sentosa is listed as a winner in TripZilla Excellence Award

==Sustainability==

Sentosa Development Corporation (SDC) has developed a sustainability plan to safeguard the environment and to conserve Sentosa&#x27;s heritage assets. In fact, many parts of Sentosa still retain her original tranquil and lush environment - driven by the corporation&#x27;s land-use policy of maintaining 60% of the island as green and open spaces (natural area reduced to about 25% by 2014).

Efforts are made to raise awareness among both visitors and staff of the island regarding environmental issues and sustainable tourism. This is done via regular campaigns and educational talks.

Key sustainability-related achievements include:

* Sentosa was shortlisted as a Sustainable Tourism Destination finalist in the World Travel and Tourism Council&#x27;s &quot;Tourism for Tomorrow&quot; Awards in 2013.
* The island is home to some 30 heritage trees (listed in the National Parks Board&#x27;s Heritage Tree Register) and over 20 conserved colonial buildings, some of which date back to the 1800s.
* Singapore&#x27;s only fully restored coastal military fort, Fort Siloso.
* Several Green Mark-certified buildings such as Sentosa Cove Village, Sentosa Family Entertainment Centre, W Hotel, and Resorts World Sentosa. The Green Mark is awarded by Singapore&#x27;s Building and Construction Authority to buildings that fulfill specific environmentally friendly criteria.
* An eco-hotel, Siloso Beach Resort.
* Developing the Sentosa Boardwalk, which is a covered pedestrian walkway with various sustainability features, to connect the island with the Singapore mainland. Guests are encouraged to use the Boardwalk to enter and exit Sentosa as it leaves a minimal carbon footprint.
* Partnering with Nanyang Technological University (NTU) to testbed Singapore&#x27;s first low-flow tidal turbine at the Sentosa Boardwalk.
* Community-giving initiatives such as an annual &quot;Sentosa Gives&quot; initiative in September, which sees more than 1,500 children, teenagers and seniors from the participating voluntary welfare organizations, schools and charities benefiting from the many activities planned for them. The corporation also offers island entry concessions to charity groups throughout the year.

<text>Cape Juby (, trans. &quot;Raʾs Juby&quot;, ) is a cape on the coast of southern Morocco, near the border with Western Sahara, directly east of the Canary Islands.
Its surrounding area, including the cities of Tarfaya and Tan-Tan, is called the Cape Juby Strip (after the homonymous cape), the Tarfaya Strip (after the homonymous city) or the Tekna Zone (after the Tekna, the native Sahrawi tribe). The region is presently the far south of internationally recognized Morocco, and makes up a semi-desert buffer zone between Morocco proper at the Draa River and Western Sahara. The strip was under Spanish rule during much of the 20th century, officially as part of the Spanish protectorate in Morocco, but mainly administered alongside Saguía el-Hamra and Río de Oro as part of Spanish Sahara, with which the Strip had closer cultural and historical links.

== History ==
=== Precolonial era ===
On 28 May 1767, Mohammed ben Abdallah, the Sultan of Morocco, signed a peace and commerce treaty with King Charles III of Spain. In the treaty, Morocco was unable to guarantee the security of Spanish fishermen along the coasts south of the Noun River, as Morocco did not have control over the Tekna tribes of that area (Art. 18).

On 1 March 1799, Sultan Slimane signed an accord with King Charles IV of Spain, in which he recognized that the Saguia el Hamra and Cape Juby regions were not part of his dominions (Art. 22).

In 1879, the British North West Africa Company established a trading post near Cape Juby called &quot;Port Victoria&quot;. On 26 March 1888, Moroccan soldiers attacked the post, killing the director of the post and leaving two workers badly injured. In 1895, the company sold its post to the Sultan of Morocco.

=== Spanish protectorate ===
In 1912, Spain negotiated with France (which controlled the affairs of Morocco at the time) for concessions on the southern coast of Morocco. officially occupied the Cape Juby region for Spain on 29 July 1916. It was administered by Spain as a single entity with Spanish Sahara and the Ifni enclave, as Spanish West Africa.

The Spanish area comprised and had a population of 9,836. Its main town was founded by the Spanish as Villa Bens (now called Tarfaya). Villa Bens was used as a staging post for airmail flights.

=== Retrocession to Morocco ===
When Morocco regained full independence in 1956, it requested the cession of officially Moroccan areas controlled by Spain. After some resistance and some fighting during 1957 (the Ifni War), the Spanish government in 1958 ceded the Cape Juby Strip to Morocco.

== Sahara sea ==
In 1877, the Scottish engineer Donald Mackenzie was the first to propose the creation of a Sahara Sea. Mackenzie&#x27;s idea was to cut a channel from one of the sand-barred lagoons north of Cape Juby south to a large plain which Arab traders had identified to him as El Djouf. Mackenzie believed this vast region was up to below sea level and that flooding it would create an inland sea of suited to commercial navigation and even agriculture. He further believed that geological evidence suggested this basin had once been connected to the Atlantic via a channel near the Saguia el-Hamra. He proposed that this inland sea, if augmented with a canal, could provide access to the Niger River and the markets and rich resources of West Africa.
There are several small depressions in the vicinity of Cape Juby; at below sea level, the Sebkha Tah is the lowest and largest. But it covers less than and is north of the geographical area identified as El Djouf (also known as the Majabat al-Koubra) which has an average elevation of 320 m.
Mackenzie never travelled in this area but had read of other sub-sea level desert basins in present-day Tunisia, Algeria and Egypt similar to those found near Cape Juby. These basins contain seasonally dry salt lakes, known as chotts or sebkhas. Egypt&#x27;s Qattara Depression is perhaps the largest such basin in North Africa.

<text>Sir Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard FBA FRAI (21 September 1902 – 11 September 1973) was an English anthropologist who was instrumental in the development of social anthropology. He was Professor of Social Anthropology at the University of Oxford from 1946 to 1970.

==Education and field work==
Evans-Pritchard was educated at Winchester College and studied history at Exeter College, Oxford, where he was influenced by R. R. Marett, and then as a postgraduate at the London School of Economics (LSE). His doctoral thesis (1928) was titled &quot;The social organization of the Azande of the Bahr-el-Ghazal province of the Anglo-Egyptian Sudan&quot;.

At Oxford, he was part of the Hypocrites&#x27; Club. At LSE, he came under the influence of Bronisław Malinowski and especially Charles Gabriel Seligman, the founding ethnographer of the Sudan. His first fieldwork began in 1926 with the Azande, a people of the upper Nile, and resulted in both a doctorate (in 1927) and his classic &quot;Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande&quot; (1937). Evans-Pritchard continued to lecture at the LSE and conduct research in Azande and Bongo land until 1930, when he began a new research project among the Nuer.

This work coincided with his appointment to the University of Cairo in 1932, where he gave a series of lectures on religion that bore Seligman&#x27;s influence. After his return to Oxford, he continued his research on Nuer. It was during this period that he first met Meyer Fortes and A. R. Radcliffe-Brown. Evans-Pritchard began developing Radcliffe-Brown&#x27;s program of structural-functionalism. As a result, his trilogy of works on the Nuer (&quot;The Nuer&quot; (1940), &quot;Kinship and Marriage Among the Nuer&quot; (1951), and &quot;Nuer Religion&quot; (1956)) and the volume he coedited with Meyer Fortes entitled &quot;African Political Systems&quot; (1940) came to be seen as classics of British social anthropology. Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s &quot;Witchcraft, Oracles and Magic Among the Azande&quot; is the first major anthropological contribution to the sociology of knowledge through its neutral — some would say &quot;relativist&quot; — stance on the &quot;correctness&quot; of Zande beliefs about causation. His work focused in on a known psychological effect known as psychological attribution. Evans-Pritchard recorded the tendencies of Azandes to blame or attribute witchcraft as the cause of various mis-happenings. The most notable of these issues involved the deaths of eight Azande people due to the collapse of a termite infested door frame. Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s empirical work in this vein became well known through philosophy of science and &quot;rationality&quot; debates of the 1960s and 1970s involving Thomas Kuhn and especially Paul Feyerabend.

During the Second World War Evans-Pritchard served in Ethiopia, Libya, Sudan, and Syria. In Sudan he raised irregular troops among the Anuak to harass the Italians and engaged in guerrilla warfare. In 1942, he was posted to the British Military Administration of Cyrenaica in North Africa, and it was on the basis of his experience there that he produced &quot;The Sanusi of Cyrenaica&quot;. In documenting local resistance to Italian conquest, he became one of a few English-language authors to write about the &quot;tariqa&quot;.

After a brief stint in Cambridge, Evans-Pritchard became professor of social anthropology at the University of Oxford and a Fellow of All Souls College. He remained at All Souls College for the rest of his career. Among the doctoral students he advised was the late M. N. Srinivas, the doyen among India&#x27;s sociologists who coined some of the key concepts in Indian sociological discourse, including &quot;Sanskritization&quot;, &quot;dominant caste&quot; and &quot;vote bank.&quot; One of his students was Talal Asad, who now teaches at the City University of New York. Mary Douglas&#x27;s classic &quot;Purity and Danger&quot; on pollutions and uncertainty — what we often denote as &#x27;risk&#x27; — was fundamentally influenced by Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s views on how accusations, blame and responsibility are deployed though culturally specific conceptions of misfortune and harm.

==Later theories==
Evans-Pritchard&#x27;s later work was more theoretical, drawing upon his experiences as an anthropologist to philosophise on the nature of anthropology and how it should best be practised. In 1950, he famously disavowed the commonly held view that anthropology was a natural science, arguing instead that it should be grouped among the humanities, especially history. He argued that the main issue facing anthropologists was one of translation—finding a way to translate one&#x27;s own thoughts into the world of another culture and thus manage to come to understand it, and then to translate this understanding back so as to explain it to people of one&#x27;s own culture.

In 1965, he published the highly influential work &quot;Theories of Primitive Religion&quot;, arguing against the existing theories of what at the time were called &quot;primitive&quot; religious practices. Arguing along the lines of his theoretical work of the 1950s, he claimed that anthropologists rarely succeeded in entering the minds of the people they studied, and so ascribed to them motivations which more closely matched themselves and their own culture, not the one they were studying. He also argued that believers and non-believers approached the study of religion in vastly different ways, with non-believers being quicker to come up with biological, sociological, or psychological theories to explain religion as an illusion, and believers being more likely to come up with theories explaining religion as a method of conceptualising and relating to reality.

==Life and family==
Edward Evan Evans-Pritchard was born in Crowborough, East Sussex, England, the son of an Anglican cleric. He converted to Roman Catholicism in 1944.

Known to his friends and family as &quot;EP&quot;, Evans-Pritchard had five children with his wife Ioma, including journalist Ambrose Evans-Pritchard, another writer and film festival director Deirdre Evans-Pritchard and Shineen Galloway, founder of EPG Computer Services. Some notable grandchildren are Ruth Galloway of the Midieval Babes choral group and Suriya Jayanti, a diplomat and journalist and documentary filmmaker Hannah Jayanti.

Evans-Pritchard died in Oxford on 11 September 1973.

==Honours==
A Rivers Memorial Medal recipient (1937) and of the Huxley Memorial Medal (1963) he was President of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland from 1949 to 1951. He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1958 and the American Philosophical Society in 1968. Evans-Pritchard was knighted in 1971. A number of Festschriften were prepared for him:
*&quot;Essays in Sudan Ethnography: presented to Sir Edward Evans-Pritchard&quot;
*&quot;The Translation of Culture: Essays to E. E. Evans-Pritchard&quot; (London: Tavistock, 1973)

==Legacy: The Evans-Pritchard Lectures==

The Evans-Pritchard Lectureship at All Souls College, Oxford, was established in 1998 in his memory.

The disciplines and areas covered by the annual Lecturers are those that interested Evans-Pritchard: social anthropology, classical studies, modern history, Asian and Middle Eastern studies and in Africa, the Middle East, the Mediterranean.

The rubric for the lectures is that they &quot;should provide an empirical analysis of social relations, and should be based on fieldwork or on indigenous primary materials&quot; (see ref above).

Many of the lecturers have published the contents as academic monographs and are now holders of posts in various universities round the world.

<text>Launceston () is a city in the north of Tasmania, Australia, at the confluence of the North Esk and South Esk rivers where they become the Tamar River (kanamaluka). As of 2021, the Launceston urban area has a population of 90,953. Launceston is the second most populous city in Tasmania after the state capital, Hobart. Launceston is the fifth-largest inland city and the ninth-largest non-capital city in Australia. Launceston is regarded as the most livable regional city, and was one of the most popular regional cities to move to in Australia from 2020 to 2021. Launceston was named Australian Town of the Year in 2022.

Settled by Europeans in March 1806, Launceston is one of Australia&#x27;s oldest cities and it has many historic buildings. Like many places in Australia, it was named after a town in the United Kingdom – in this case, Launceston, Cornwall. Launceston also had the first use of anaesthetic in the Southern Hemisphere, it was the first Australian city to have underground sewers, and it was the first Australian city to be lit by hydroelectricity. The city has a maritime climate with four distinct seasons and is appreciably warmer than the south of the island during summer. Local government is split between the City of Launceston, Meander Valley and West Tamar Councils.

== History ==

The first inhabitants of the area of Launceston were largely nomadic Aboriginal Tasmanians believed to have been part of the Northern Midlands Nations. Three Nations made up the area around so called Launceston, the Stoney Creek Nation, Tyerenotepanner; Panninher and Lettermairrener.

The first white explorers did not arrive until 1798, when George Bass and Matthew Flinders were sent to explore the possibility that there was a strait between Australia and Van Diemen&#x27;s Land (now Tasmania). They originally landed in Port Dalrymple (the mouth of the Tamar River), to the north-west of Launceston.

The first significant colonial settlement in the region dates from 1804, when the commandant of the colonial garrison. Lt. Col. William Paterson, and his men set up a camp on the current site of George Town. A few weeks later, the settlement was moved across the river to York Town, and a year later was moved to its definitive position where Launceston stands.

Initially, the settlement was called Patersonia; however, Paterson later changed the name to Launceston in honour of the New South Wales Governor Captain Philip Gidley King, who was born in Launceston, Cornwall. The name still survives in the tiny hamlet of Patersonia north-east of Launceston. Paterson himself also served as Lieutenant-Governor of northern Van Diemen&#x27;s Land from 1804 to 1808.

The geographical area in which Launceston is now located was previously occupied by the Aboriginal Tasmanian &quot;Letteremairrener&quot; people. The &quot;Letteremairrener&quot; country encompasses most of the Tamar Valley region. In 1804, reports from early European voyagers describe a number of &quot;Letteremairrener&quot; camps, consisting of up to ten bark huts located on either side of the Tamar River. Extensive archeological evidence suggests that occupation and usage of the Tamar basin can be dated from at least 7,000 years ago, although it was likely used as long as 35,000 years ago. The &quot;Letteremairrener&quot;, as seasonal hunter-gatherers, spent the winter months near George Town and the summer months residing on Ben Lomond, before returning to the banks of the Tamar River for the mutton-bird season. Campbell Macknight characterizes early colonial contact with the &quot;Letteremairrener&quot; people as a mixture of fear, curiosity and aggression. After several aggressive encounters prompted by bands of &quot;Letteremairrener&quot; in 1806&quot;,&quot; most likely as revenge for the colonists trespassing and hunting on their land without permission, Colonel William Patterson, in charge of the new settlement in Launceston, led a series of putative skirmishes that were ostensibly continued by colonists until 1831. These conflicts intensified from 1827 until 1831 during the period of the Black War, with genocidal expeditions occurring within the &quot;Letteremairrener&quot; country and neighbouring areas.

By 1827, Launceston&#x27;s population had climbed to 2,000 and the town had become an export centre, mainly for the colony&#x27;s northern pastoral industry. Small hotels and breweries began to emerge in the 1820s before larger, more &quot;substantial&quot; hotels were built in the 1830s.

Ships from Launceston carried parties of sealers to the islands of Bass Strait early in the 19th century. They also took whalers to the coast of Victoria in the 1820s and 1830s where they established temporary bay whaling stations. Some of these temporary communities, such as the ones at Portland Bay and Port Fairy, were the forerunner of permanent settlement of those places. Expeditions from Launceston were involved in the Foundation of Melbourne.

Walter George Arthur, who petitioned Queen Victoria in 1847 while interned with other Aboriginal Tasmanians on Flinders Island, lived for several years in Launceston as one of numerous homeless children, before being taken into custody by George Augustus Robinson who sent him to the Boys&#x27; Orphan School in Hobart in 1832.

Newer popular team sports such as cricket and football failed to be sustained in Launceston before the population grew substantially. The sports were initially middle class recreations, as the working class found it difficult to participate after a six-day working week. Nevertheless, a &quot;demand for facilities&quot; led to the upgrade of the Northern Tasmanian Cricket Association Ground (NTCA Ground) among other sporting facilities in the 1860s. Not long beforehand, Tasmania played Victoria in Australia&#x27;s first first-class cricket match at the NTCA Ground in 1851.

Tin was discovered at Mount Bischoff in 1871 in north-western Tasmania, starting a minerals boom. Gold mining commenced about away in Beaconsfield in 1877. During the following two decades Launceston grew from a small town into an urban centre. In 1889, Launceston was the second town in Tasmania to be declared a city, after state capital Hobart. During the late 1880s, a small periodical called &quot;Launceston Literary&quot; contained stories as well as memoirs of the pioneering days of the region. The publication was distributed from a store in the northern end of the town, and while largely forgotten today, was at the time considered relatively popular, if at times controversial.

==Demographics==
According to the 2021 census the population of Launceston is 76,849. Launceston is the 21st most populous city in Australia. 
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 3.5% of the population.

== City of Gastronomy ==
Launceston&#x27;s designation as a UNESCO City of Gastronomy in 2021 signifies global acknowledgment of this gastronomic paradise.

== Geography ==

Launceston is at in the Tamar Valley, Northern Tasmania. The valley was formed by volcanic and glacial forces over 10 million years ago.
The city is about south of the Bass Strait, with its closest neighbour-city being Devonport, about to the north west.
Launceston combines steep (originally heavily wooded) ridges and low-lying areas (originally wetlands – with parts of the suburbs of Inveresk and Invermay below high-tide level).
As a result, areas of Launceston are subject to landslip problems, while others are liable to poor drainage and periodic flooding. The topography of the area is not conducive to easy dispersion of airborne pollution, due to the phenomenon of thermal inversion.

Since the 1990s, the city&#x27;s air quality has improved. Studies indicate that 73% percent of air pollution in Launceston and surrounding areas during the winter period is caused by wood smoke, while about 8% is from motor vehicle pollution. During the early 1990s about 60% of households used wood heaters, but since the mid-2000s only 25–30% of households use wood heating. According to the 2011 Tasmanian Air Monitoring report, particulate matter met the Air NEPM goals starting in 2006, and did not exceed the PM10 standard in the years 2009–2011.

Launceston is situated at the confluence of the South Esk River and the North Esk River, forming the Tamar River estuary. It is used for commercial and recreational shipping and boating. In earlier years, oceangoing shipping used the river to obtain access to the Port of Launceston wharves located in the city centre and Invermay.
The Port for Launceston is now located at the George Town suburb of Bell Bay, some downstream on the east bank of the Tamar estuary, close to the river mouth. The South Esk River is the longest river in Tasmania. It starts in the North East Mountains near Roses Tier and flows through the Fingal Valley where it passes through the towns of Fingal and Avoca before flowing into the Northern Midlands where it flows through the towns of Evandale, Perth, Longford and Hadspen before finally reaching Launceston via the Cataract Gorge. The river is dammed at Lake Trevallyn on the upper reaches of the Cataract Gorge, with water being diverted into the Trevallyn Power Station with runoff flowing into the remainder of the Cataract Gorge and eventually merging with the Tamar River. The North Esk River starts in the Northallerton Valley in Tasmania&#x27;s north-east mountains and winds its way to Launceston via the Corra Linn Gorge at White Hills. The St Patrick&#x27;s River, the largest tributary of the North Esk, is dammed at Nunamara to provide the majority of Launceston&#x27;s town water since the mid-1800s.

=== Flooding and levee system ===

Since the 1960s, parts of Launceston have been protected by a series of flood levees that reach up to in height as large portions of the suburbs Invermay and Newstead sit within a flood plain. The last major flood occurred in 1929 when Invermay was completely devastated. More than 4,000 people were left homeless after just one night of flooding. Since then, there have only been minor floods. Work was under way in 2011 on a $59 million flood levee upgrade that should protect the city from 1-in-200-year events, that was then expected to take five to six years to construct. The council had acquired land used by eighteen businesses on the south side of Lindsay Street in Invermay, with businesses having until July 2009 to leave. In 2016 the Tamar River flooded resulting in the widespread flooding of low lying suburbs. The St Leonards and West Tamar Highways were temporarily closed as water levels rose, causing significant disruption to the city and loss of livestock.

=== Climate ===
Launceston has an oceanic climate (Köppen: &quot;Cfb&quot;), bordering on a warm-summer Mediterranean climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot;), with mild to warm, somewhat dry summers and cool damp winters with chilly nights. The city is located in the Tamar Valley and is surrounded by many large hills and mountains. With this type of topography, Launceston&#x27;s weather patterns can change considerably in a short period. The warmest months are in January and February with an average air temperature range of . Throughout the year there is an average of 4.3 days a year over . The maximum recorded temperature was on 30 January 2009, with Launceston Airport reaching on that same day, during the 2009 Southeastern Australia heat wave. The city averages 67.3 clear days and 148.8 cloudy days per annum.

Winters are cool with minimum temperatures dropping below an average of 61 days a year. The coldest month is July, with an average temperature range of .
The lowest recorded minimum at Launceston&#x27;s current weather station, Ti Tree Bend was on 21 July 1991. Launceston very rarely receives snowfall, with snow falling in 1951 and 1986, and again on 3 August 2015, when most of the state received snowfall due to a cold front moving up from Antarctica. On the night of 4 August 2020, Launceston received an inch of snow on the ground, with varying levels around the state.

Winter, for Launceston, is also the season with the least amount of wind. Because of this and the topographical effect of the Tamar Valley, Launceston winters are renowned for foggy mornings, with Launceston Airport the most fog-bound commercial airport in Australia. The average annual rainfall, with moderate to low variability, is , falling on an average of 88.4 days a year. The most rain Ti Tree Bend has received in a year was in 1992, though Launceston Airport received in 1956. As in most of Tasmania 2006 was the driest year when just fell.

The Bureau of Meteorology reported that 2007 was the warmest year ever recorded in Launceston since temperatures were first recorded in 1884. Temperatures ranged from a minimum of to a maximum of .
During 2006 and 2007, Launceston had the hottest maxima throughout the state. In 2008, Launceston had the highest average maximum temperature out of all Tasmanian cities with .

=== Architecture ===

Many of the buildings in the city&#x27;s central business district (CBD) were constructed in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, and Launceston is a major location of Federation style housing. Launceston&#x27;s many well preserved Victorian and Georgian buildings (including the Launceston synagogue, a rare example of architecture in Egyptian Revival style) together with its diverse collection of art-deco architecture (such as Holyman House and Lucks Corner in the CBD, the former Star Theatre in Invermay and the former Launceston General Hospital) give the city an unusual period ambience. 20th century examples of architecture that are part of the city include the Government offices of Henty House in Charles Street, the Police Station Building and the ANZ Building on the corner of Brisbane &amp; George Street.

This is at least in part a matter of deliberate policy – concerns that high rise development might compromise the character of the city centre have led to strictly enforced building regulations that restrict the height of new structures in the city, so that most buildings in the CBD have fewer than five storeys.

== Governance ==
Much of Launceston is contained within the City of Launceston local government area, although some outer suburbs are part of adjacent council districts: for instance Riverside, Legana and parts of Trevallyn are part of the West Tamar Council; Prospect Vale and Blackstone Heights are included in the Meander Valley Council.

Launceston City Council meetings are held in the Launceston Town Hall. The Mayor of the City of Launceston uses the honorific the Right Worshipful. In 2002, Janie Dickenson became the youngest female elected mayor in Australia. The current mayor is Matthew Garwood, elected in 2023.
The first previous mayor, Albert Van Zetten, was initially elected in 2007, before being re-elected in 2009, 2011, 2014 and 2018. 
State Upper House seats that incorporate parts of Launceston are the Electoral Divisions of Paterson, Windermere and Rosevears. For federal elections, Launceston falls within the Division of Bass, with the sitting member being Bridget Archer for the Liberal Party of Australia, who won the seat in the 2019 election. The state Lower House seat is also called the Division of Bass, and is one of the five electorates in the Tasmanian House of Assembly. Both federal and state seats share common boundaries.

=== Flag ===

The Launceston flag design is based on the city&#x27;s Coat of Arms granted by the College of Arms, Seoul on 11 June 1957. The Brisbane Street Mall, the War memorial at Royal Park, atop the Council Chambers and on top of the Albert Hall are places in the city where the flag is regularly flown. Flying the flag is restricted to Council Property. The three intersecting lines in the flag represent the city&#x27;s three rivers (North Esk, South Esk and Tamar) and the two rectangles in the lines represent tin ingots. The strip across the top with the jagged edge is green to represent the city&#x27;s parks, gardens and surrounding countryside. Waratah flowers at the top symbolise all flowers and similar beauties of nature. The ingots are included because Launceston used to be a large tin-smelting centre. The little circle at the river junction is Launceston.

== Economy ==

Along with being a major retail centre with an average of 75% of market share in surrounding local councils, Launceston is a major service centre for the north of Tasmania. The city is home to a campus of the University of Tasmania including the Australian Maritime College and also has a minor minerals and manufacturing base.

Launceston is a major hub for the regional agricultural and pastoral activities. Historically, this has been connected with the growing of apples – in recent years the stress has moved to viticulture. Superfine wool remains an important part of the rural economy of north-east Tasmania and wool sales in Launceston attract many international buyers. The various agricultural industries in the district are supported by the Tasmanian Institute of Agricultural Research which operates the Mount Pleasant Research Laboratories in the Launceston suburb of Prospect.

=== Tourism ===

Launceston serves as the commercial hub for the north of Tasmania, and like many parts of the state, is becoming a major tourist centre. Visitors to the city have grown over the past few years: during 2004 Launceston attracted 412,800 visitors, up 51% from 2001. The United Kingdom is the origin of 25% of all international visitors to the city and 17% originate from the United States. The Cataract Gorge is Launceston&#x27;s largest tourist attraction and is in close proximity to the city centre. It is home to the longest single span chairlift in the world, stretching across the gorge. Launceston has many parks throughout the city including City Park, located next to the city centre. City Park is home to Albert Hall. The park also has a large enclosure for Japanese macaque monkeys, a gift from sister city Ikeda, Japan. The Launceston General Post Office is a heritage-listed building that dates back to the 1880s, with a clock tower added in the early twentieth century. The GPO clock chime chimes every quarter-hour, twenty-four hours a day. Tasmania Zoo, which is known for its wildlife conservation work, including a breeding program for Tasmanian devils, is located near the city.

== Culture ==

=== Arts and entertainment ===
Launceston&#x27;s Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery was established in 1891.
Now the largest museum located outside a capital city in Australia, the Queen Victoria Museum and Art Gallery is located at two sites across the city: the original purpose-built building at Royal Park and another at the Inveresk Cultural Precinct, on the grounds of the former railway station and rail yards in buildings largely converted from the former Railway Workshops. The precinct also includes the Launceston Tramway Museum, which houses the No. 29 tram, the &#x27;Mary St&#x27; shelter shed and a host of other memorabilia. The state&#x27;s largest preservation railway, the Don River Railway, also has a carriage rebuilding workshop on the site. Australia&#x27;s oldest bookshop, A.W. Birchall &amp; Sons (Birchalls) dating from November 1844, was closed in 2017

Located in the Southern Launceston suburb of Prospect, the Country Club Casino is a hotel, casino and golf course complex. It was the second casino to be built in Tasmania and one of the first in Australia.
Launceston Aquatic, a $26.3 million regional aquatic centre was completed in July 2009. The site, just outside the central business district spans about .

From 1999 to 2003, Launceston was the site of three of the four Gone South music festivals. From 2006 to 2011, it hosted the MS Fest, a music festival held at the Inveresk Show grounds each summer to raise funds for multiple sclerosis research. This has since been replaced with the Breath of Life Festival from 2012 to 2014, a similar event held at the Inveresk show grounds to raise funds for lung cancer research.

Launceston is also the host of the Junction Arts Festival. The Junction Arts Festival was first held in 2010, and spans five days in the Launceston CBD each year. The Festival program changes each year, and includes various art forms, including music, dance, visual and interactive art, short films and live performances, from local, national and international artists.

=== Sport ===
Sport is a popular recreational and spectator activity in Launceston and like most of the state, cricket and Australian rules football are popular sports. The city has been the birthplace of two prominent Australian cricketers; the former Australian cricket captain Ricky Ponting and the retired cricketer and Australian selector David Boon. The first first-class cricket match played in Australia was at the Northern Tasmania Cricket Association Ground between the Melbourne Cricket Club and the Launceston Cricket Club in 1851.

Australian rules football is very popular in Launceston, and is often played at York Park (University of Tasmania Stadium). Holding 20,000 people—more than any other stadium in Tasmania—York Park was swampland before becoming Launceston&#x27;s showgrounds in 1873. Hawthorn has played between two and five AFL matches each season since 2001, and the St Kilda Football Club played two games a year between 2003 and 2006. In 2007, the Tasmanian Government signed a A$16.4 million, five-year sponsorship deal with the Hawthorn Football Club, under which the club will play four regular season games and one National Australia Bank Cup pre-season match at the venue each year. Throughout its history, York Park has hosted major pop concerts and other entertainments. Since 2001 it has been a venue for international sports events, and in 2005 was redeveloped at a cost of $23.6 million. Association football (commonly known in Launceston as &quot;soccer&quot;) is also played and watched in Launceston [York Park]—the only place in Tasmania to have hosted national league soccer matches. A National Soccer League game was held at Aurora Stadium in 2002 between Perth Glory and Melbourne Knights. A-League&#x27;s Melbourne Victory have held a pre-season cup game at the venue each year since 2006. The record crowd is 8,061.

Launceston is not represented by an NRL Football Club, but is expected to be represented by an AFL Team by 2028, as Tasmania was awarded the 19th AFL Licence on 2 May 2023 when AFL Presidents Unanimously approved the Tasmanian bid

Rugby league football is played in the region at junior level and senior level, the Launceston Warriors play in the Tasmanian Rugby League and were minor premiers in the 2012–2013 season.

Since 2004, the V8 Supercars (Tasmanian Challenge) has been annually held at the recently re-developed Symmons Plains Raceway, which is around 30 km south of Launceston. 
Marcos Ambrose, driver of the number 9 Richard Petty Motorsports car is most likely America&#x27;s most notable Launceston native. A number of other sports have notable presence in Launceston, including basketball (men&#x27;s, women&#x27;s and indoor) and hockey. In 2009 Launceston redeveloped the city&#x27;s swimming facilities which now include a modern indoor multimillion-dollar swimming centre at windmill hill, now named Launceston Aquatic.

The city co-hosted the basketball FIBA Oceania Championship 1975, where the Australian national basketball team won the gold medal.

=== Media ===
Launceston&#x27;s local newspaper &quot;The Examiner&quot; was founded by James Aikenhead in 1842, and has been continually published ever since. The newspaper is currently owned by Nine Entertainment Co (Nine having merged with Fairfax Media in 2018). Another local media site is &quot;The Tasmanian Times.&quot;

Along with the rest of the state, the city has four free-to-air television stations, including two government funded channels from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) and two commercial stations; (Southern Cross Seven (7HD) &amp; WIN (9HD) These services are available in digital format as well as eleven digital-only stations, one carrying Network 10 programming (Tasmanian Digital Television (10 HD), and nationwide digital-only stations ABC TV Plus/ABC Kids, ABC ME and ABC News (on ABC), SBS Viceland, SBS Food and NITV (on SBS), 7two and 7mate (on SC Seven), 9Gem, 9Go! and 9Life (on WIN), and 10 Bold, 10 Peach and 10 Shake (on TDT).

== Infrastructure ==

=== Health ===
Launceston General Hospital is Launceston&#x27;s 300-bed public hospital, located just south of the city centre. Every year, LGH treats over 24,000 inpatients and over 225,000 outpatients. St Lukes Private Hospital and St Vincent&#x27;s Hospital are the major private facilities. Launceston was also the location of the first use of anaesthesia in the Southern Hemisphere.
Launceston is also the hub for the state&#x27;s medical retrieval service. The Royal Flying Doctor Service supplies an aircraft and pilots under contract to the state&#x27;s ambulance service and the aircraft (a Beechcraft Super King Air) is staffed by Ambulance Tasmania&#x27;s Intensive Care Paramedics and doctors from the Launceston General Hospital.

=== Education ===
* University of Tasmania has its second largest campus in Launceston, based in Newnham. It is currently relocating a significant portion of its campus to Inveresk. 
* TasTAFE has two major operations in Launceston based at Alanvale and the Central Business District.

=== Utilities ===
Launceston&#x27;s electricity is primarily generated by renewable hydro electric power plants including the Trevallyn Power Station which is supplied with water from Trevallyn Dam. The major retailer is Aurora Energy.

 Historically, Launceston was powered by gas from the Launceston Gas Company, (later Gas Corporation of Tasmania). In 1988 it was sold to Boral. The first gas plant was built in 1860 as a horizontal retort Gas Works house made from brick and sandstone on the site&#x27;s SW corner. This was followed by keepers cottages, labs, the Headquarters Building and the iconic 1930s vertical retort recognised by the wording &quot;COOK WITH GAS&quot; written in its brickwork. The Duck Reach Power Station replaced gas for street lighting when it was completed in 1895 (the first municipally owned power station in the Southern Hemisphere). Until the 1950s when Trevallyn Power Station was built, Duck Reach supplied Launceston with most of its power needs – it is now an interpretive historic site. The former Gas Works currently houses the Launceston Hogsbreath Cafe.

Launceston&#x27;s water comes from the Launceston Water Catchment. The majority is sourced from St Patricks River, a tributary of the North Esk River which flows through Launceston. The main retailer is Ben Lomond Water. The first reticulated water supply constructed in 1857 still serves the CBD. There were fears that the Tamar Valley Pulp Mill might adversely affect Launceston&#x27;s water supply.

Like many Australian cities, several major companies provide mobile telecommunications services and wireless internet services to Launceston. Launceston&#x27;s communication infrastructure was upgraded in 1997 through the federal &quot;Networking the Nation&quot; program. Beginning in 2010, the National Broadband Network began installation of fire optic cables in Launceston. In 2016, Launceston became the first city in Tasmania to be fully connected to the NBN.

== Transport ==
=== Road ===
The car is by far the most dominant form of transport in Launceston, with the city having 721 km of urban and rural roads, even though much of the CBD has narrow one-way streets.
Since February 1998, Launceston has been serviced by the Tasmanian government-owned and operated public bus service Metro Tasmania. In addition, Redline Coaches offers school services and travels to many destinations across Tasmania.

Because of its central location, Launceston is the hub of five of the state&#x27;s major highways. The Midland Highway is the primary route to Hobart. The Bass Highway is the primary route to Devonport and Burnie. The Tasman Highway is an alternate scenic route to Hobart via Scottsdale, the East Coast, the West Tamar Highway and East Tamar Highway.

=== Tram and rail network ===
Launceston operated a suburban tramway system between 1999 and 2012, which consisted of 29 trams. It was first conceived in 1909, after observations of efficiently working systems in Melbourne and Adelaide. A decade before the tram system was abandoned, Launceston had begun converting to trolleybuses, especially for the hilly routes. The Launceston trolleybus system was one of the most extensive of the various trolleybus systems in Australia. The tramway network was finally removed in 1952 to make way for cars and buses. A tramway museum in Inveresk is all that remains of Launceston&#x27;s trams. Launceston&#x27;s streets, most of which were planned in the early nineteenth century, were probably always too narrow for trams to be fully successful: in many cases little of the roadway remained for other forms of transport. The track gauge was .

A regional passenger rail system operated in Tasmania, of which Launceston was a major hub; however, after many years of gradual retrenchment it was closed in July 1978.

Former passenger railway lines servicing Launceston:
* Launceston and Western Railway (1871–1873)
*Launceston–Deloraine (1875–1978)
*Launceston–Hobart (via Evandale) (1876–1978)
*Launceston–Devonport (1885–1978)
*Launceston–Burnie (1901–1978)

=== Airport ===
The city is served by the small curfew-free Launceston Airport, south-east of the city. The airport serves over one million passengers annually. Jetstar, QantasLink, Sharp Airlines and Virgin Australia operate scheduled services at the airport. As at November 2020, there are direct flights to and from Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane.

There is a freight rail system in operation which links Launceston to Burnie, Hobart and Bell Bay.

=== Port ===

Launceston&#x27;s port is located about 48 kilometers north on the Tamar River at Bell Bay. The Port of Bell Bay handles around 5,300,000 tons of domestic and international cargo each year, and has five piers for cruise and passenger ships. The port is adjacent to an industrial park that houses facilities for Temco, Sims Metal, BP Australia and Onesteel, among other companies. The Port of Bell Bay is part of a network of ports managed by the state-owned company TasPorts.

The river&#x27;s name was first recorded in 1673 by Jacques Marquette as &quot;Meskousing&quot; from his Indian guides - most likely Miami for &quot;river running through a red place.&quot;

Before roads into Wisconsin, the river was canoed, hunted and fished by Indians. Loggers used the upper reaches of the river and its tributaries to drive logs to their sawmills and the lower reaches to float rafts of sawn boards to markets as near as Portage and as far as St. Louis. Today dams along the river generate hydroelectric power and people fish, boat, water-ski and sight-see on the river.

==Geography==

The Wisconsin is the longest river in the state, arising at the Michigan border in the northeast and emptying into the Mississippi River far to the southwest near Prairie du Chien. It originates in the forests of the North Woods Lake District in Lac Vieux Desert on the border with the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. It flows south across the glacial plain of central Wisconsin, passing through Wausau, Stevens Point, and Wisconsin Rapids. In southern Wisconsin, it encounters the terminal moraine formed during the last ice age, where it flows through the Dells of the Wisconsin River. North of Madison at Portage the river turns to the west, flowing through Wisconsin&#x27;s hilly Western Upland and joining the Mississippi approximately 3 miles (4.8 km) south of Prairie du Chien.

Before the Grandfather Falls dam was built in Lincoln County, that series of rapids constituted the largest drop in a short distance on the river. Over the course of a mile and a half, the river dropped 89.5 feet.
Major tributaries of the Wisconsin are the following, working upstream from the Mississippi: the Kickapoo River, the Pine River, the Baraboo River, the Lemonweir River, the Yellow River, the Little Eau Pleine River the Big Eau Pleine River, the Eau Claire River, the Big Rib River, the Tomahawk River, and the Pelican River.

The river borders Adams, Juneau, Columbia, Sauk, Dane, Iowa, Richland, Grant, and Crawford Counties.

==Formation of the river==

The modern Wisconsin River was formed in several stages. Most recent was the northernmost segment of the river, from the source to around modern Merrill. During the last ice age an ice sheet crept down from Canada, and a section called the Wisconsin Valley Lobe bulged down the valley that would become the Wisconsin River to near Merrill. As the climate warmed and that ice sheet receded about 14,000 years ago, meltwater drained down the valley, eventually cutting a course similar to the modern river.

The next segment, from Merrill to around Wisconsin Rapids, was probably formed as earlier glaciers retreated, hundreds of thousands of years ago. Like the northern segment, the bedrock beneath is pre-Cambrian igneous and metamorphic rock - hard-to-erode stuff that produces frequent rapids.

The next segment, from Wisconsin Rapids to the Baraboo Hills, flows through a sand plain. Though the last ice sheet stopped around Merrill, another lobe of the ice sheet to the east reached far to the south, butting up against the east end of the Baraboo Hills. With drainage blocked, water backed up north of the hills, forming Glacial Lake Wisconsin, which reached from modern Baraboo north to Wisconsin Rapids. As the ice sheet receded, meltwater carried sand and silt ground by the glacier into the lake, where the water slowed and its sediment settled to form a fairly flat lake bed. When warming began to melt back the ice against the Baraboo Hills, about 18,000 years ago, the flowing water quickly opened the gap and poured through, carving the Wisconsin Dells and cutting the start of the river&#x27;s channel through the sand plain. Subsequent erosion has further cut that channel through the flat plain.
The lower, westward-flowing portion of the river, between the Baraboo Hills and the Mississippi, is probably the oldest section. Passing through the Driftless Area, it was never covered by a glacier. The western, lower end of the river is narrower than its upstream valley, leading to the suggestion that an ancestor river once flowed east through this segment.

==History==
===Early===
Native Americans had long used the Wisconsin as a highway through the forests, canoeing and fishing it, living along its banks and burying their dead there. At times they fought, but they also met to trade, and several tribes could share the same hunting grounds.

In 1673, French missionary Jacques Marquette, French-Canadian explorer Louis Joliet, five voyageurs, and two Miami guides arrived near the headwaters of the Fox River - modern-day Portage. From there, they portaged their two canoes slightly less than two miles through marsh and oak plains to the Wisconsin River. They then continued downstream 200 miles (320 km) to the Wisconsin&#x27;s mouth, entering the Mississippi on June 17. Other explorers and traders would follow the same route, and for the next 150 years the Wisconsin and Fox rivers, collectively known as the Fox-Wisconsin Waterway, formed a major transportation route between the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River.

===The river&#x27;s name===

When Marquette&#x27;s company entered the Wisconsin River in their two canoes, he wrote:
The river on which we embarked is called &quot;Meskousing&quot;. It is very wide; it has a sandy bottom, which forms various shoals that rend its navigation very difficult.
This is the first recorded mention of the name that evolved into &quot;Wisconsin,&quot; which the state ended up taking. Sieur de La Salle misread Marquette&#x27;s elaborate &#x27;M&#x27; as &quot;Ou&quot; and wrote the name as &quot;Ouisconsin.&quot; In the 1800s Americans anglicized the spelling to &quot;Wisconsin.&quot;

Antiquarians have long sought the meaning of Meskousing/Wisconsin. Indians and early French residents offered meanings ranging from &quot;stream of a thousand isles&quot; to &quot;gathering of waters&quot; to &quot;muskrat house.&quot; In 2003 Michael McCafferty, who specializes in the Miami language, argued that Meskousing is a rendering of &quot;river running through a red place&quot; in the language of the two Miami guides who spoke to Marquette. They were probably referring to the reddish sandstone along the river, like at the Dells.

===Fur trade era===
The fur trade reached up the Wisconsin and its tributaries, with traders like John Baptiste Du Bay and Amable Grignon establishing posts along the river where they traded goods like knives and beads with Indians for furs. Franci LeRoi ran a trading post on the portage from the Wisconsin River to the Fox, at modern Portage.

In 1828 the U.S. Army bought LeRoi&#x27;s building and built Fort Winnebago at his strategic site - the army&#x27;s third fort in what would become Wisconsin. To build the new fort, one of the officers from the fort led a party up the Wisconsin River, then up its tributary the Yellow to cut pine logs. In the spring of 1829 he and his men floated the logs down to Portage to use in building the fort. That officer was Lt. Jefferson Davis - future president of the Confederacy during the Civil War.

Indian territories shifted over time, but just prior to European settlement, the Ojibwe dominated the upper section above modern Wausau, the Menominee the middle section from Wausau to Portage, and the Ho-Chunk the lower section from Portage to Prairie du Chien.

===Fox-Wisconsin Waterway Improvement?===
The economic success of the Erie Canal, completed in 1825, revived old ideas of how the Fox River and Wisconsin River, which Marquette and Joliet and their Indian guides had traversed 150 years before, could provide a shortcut between the Mississippi valley and the Great Lakes. In 1839 some preliminary surveying was done to assess possibilities and cost. In the 1840s and 50s Congress approved land grants to finance the improvement of the rivers. Work proceeded slowly, done by the government and a succession of private canal companies. In 1854, the first steamship, the &quot;Aquila&quot; came up from the Mississippi, crossed the canal at Portage, and descended the locks of the Fox to Green Bay. But the upper Fox was shallow and winding. Even less fixable was the lower Wisconsin, with its shallow, shifting sandbars. A railroad executive observed wryly that &quot;navigation could never be secured upon the Wisconsin river until its bottom had been fully lathed and plastered.&quot; And railroads finally finished the canal scheme, criss-crossing much of the state by the 1860s and providing a means of hauling freight that ran in winter when the rivers were frozen and in summer when they were low.

===Lumbering===
In the mid-1800s the northern half of the Wisconsin watershed held large stands of virgin pine forest. Far to the south on the savannas of southern Wisconsin and the treeless prairies of Iowa, Illinois and Missouri, settlers needed lumber to build their barns and houses. In that era before trucks or even roads, the Wisconsin River offered a way to move lumber from the forests to markets downstream - an efficient way!

In 1827-28 Daniel Whitney started a shingle-making operation near where the Yellow River flowed into the Wisconsin. This was soon shut down by the army because Whitney didn&#x27;t have proper permission to harvest timber from Indian lands. At that point, northern Wisconsin was still owned by several Indian nations. After obtaining better permissions, entrepreneur Whitney moved on to build the first sawmill on the Wisconsin River in 1831 or 1832 downstream from Wisconsin Rapids, and the Helena shot tower on the lower Wisconsin around the same time.
A few years later in 1836 the Menominee ceded some of their land to the US government. Most of this land was in northeast Wisconsin, but the U.S. negotiator pressed them to also cede a six-mile-wide strip along the Wisconsin River from the future site of Nekoosa up to Big Bull Falls (Wausau). He pressed for this land because its pine stood within easy reach of the river, and the river flowed toward parts of Wisconsin (and beyond) that needed lumber. Once the treaty was signed, lumbermen rushed in looking for good mill sites. They found many, because the river had plenty of fall over the hard bedrock in this section. By 1839, all the sites were taken as far north as Big Bull Falls. Of the state&#x27;s river drainages, the Wisconsin was the first &quot;to be exploited on a large scale&quot; - before the Wolf and the Chippewa.

The lumber industry in the Wisconsin River valley was heavily dependent on the river system until the coming of railroads in the 1870s. In winter, logging camps out in the forests felled trees, cut them into logs typically 16 feet long, and sledded them over icy trails to streambanks where they stacked them in &quot;rollways.&quot; In spring, when melting snow raised water levels, lumberjacks rolled the &quot;banked&quot; logs into the river and log driving crews rode them downstream, breaking up log jams and retrieving those that got tangled in sloughs. In 1879 logs jammed the river near Wausau, backing up for four miles. The logging companies built special splash dams to raise water levels when the natural spring floods weren&#x27;t enough. As driven logs reached the sawmills, log booms in the river were used to capture floating logs and sort them to their appropriate owners.

Sawmills were more scattered along the Wisconsin than other rivers because the Wisconsin presented more challenges to driving logs. That is, on other major rivers the sawmills were concentrated at Oshkosh, La Crosse, Chippewa Falls and Eau Claire, and Stillwater; but on the Wisconsin, mills were strung out from Wisconsin Rapids up through Merrill, so that the logs wouldn&#x27;t have to be driven so far. The earliest sawmills were powered by the river via waterwheels and turbines at dams.

After being sawed, most of the lumber was rafted to markets down the river. For example, after a Wausau sawmill sawed a 16-foot log into 16-foot boards, the boards were bound into 16 by 16-foot &quot;cribs&quot; twelve to twenty inches deep - floating packets of boards. Six or seven of these cribs were connected into a long, narrow &quot;rapids piece&quot;, which could flex at the joints as it went over a rapids or dam - a bit like a string of roller-coaster cars 16 feet wide and 100 feet long, with heavy bumper logs across the front and back, and &quot;spring poles&quot; along each side to tip the front crib up a bit. A long steering oar was mounted on the front of the raft and another on the back, each 36 to 50 feet long. Then the top of the raft was loaded with lath and shingles. Sometimes these rafts were built on the ice, starting in January. (Rafts on other rivers like the Chippewa and St. Croix were built lighter and less flexible, since those rivers were less demanding than the rapids and dams of the upper Wisconsin.)

When the ice was out and the river&#x27;s water level was high enough, a fleet of twenty or forty of these 100-foot-long rafts would set out under the direction of a pilot. When they came to a dam or rapids, they would tie the rafts to the bank and the pilot and two to eight men would try taking a rapids-piece raft through. Dams were built then with a slide for rafts - a gap about 50 feet wide leading to a ramp of logs descending to the water below. A spectator described a raft going over a dam:
The moment the bow entered the slide it was literally jerked down, and disappeared beneath the wild waters. [Pilot Jack Hawn&#x27;s] men were lifted off their feet, thrown back upon the raft. Hawn for a moment was overboard, but was caught and pulled aboard - all came out right, the men thoroughly soaked, yet saved the raft. Later in the same day Hawn and Jas. Mowe saved by their daring and skillful handling of a skiff the life of a poor fellow clinging to one of the new piers.
Many rafts were wrecked and men drowned when someone misjudged the current, when a sudden breeze made a raft miss a slide, or by a poorly designed slide. It was reported that forty raftsmen drowned in 1872. The most notorious rapids were Big Bull Falls (future Wausau), Conant&#x27;s Rapids (Stevens Point), and Grand Rapids (future Wisconsin Rapids), but many thought Little Bull Falls (future Mosinee) was the most dangerous, with a 16-foot ledge in the river starting a race down a narrow, quarter-mile gorge.

Lumbermen tried to reduce the hazards on the river, building timber slides over rapids and dams, dynamiting troublesome points of rock, and building wing dams to focus the current. These improvements were initially made by individual companies, along with splash dams and lumber booms, but it became clear that these investments affected everyone and the burden should be shared and coordinated. To address these concerns, the Little Bull Falls Boom Company was formed in 1852. In 1856 a larger Wisconsin River Boom Company was formed.

When the rafts reached Point Basse below Wisconsin Rapids, they entered a tamer sand-bottomed part of the river. The crews joined three rapids-piece rafts side-by-side into larger rafts 48 feet wide and 100 feet long, called &quot;Wisconsin rafts.&quot; From this point, the pilot led a string of rafts slowly down the winding river, trying to avoid shifting sandbars. The Dells still presented hazards, and some rafts were smashed there, but nothing like on the upper Wisconsin. Below the Dells, railroad bridges were a hazard, along with sandbars. When the rafts reached the Mississippi, they were all joined together into a huge &quot;Mississippi raft,&quot; and proceeded downriver. Most of them went to St. Louis, where they were disassembled and sold to lumber yards. The whole trip from central Wisconsin to St. Louis took from three weeks to all summer, depending on how much water was flowing and the skill of the raftsmen.

The lumber output of the Wisconsin River valley grew from 6.25 million board feet in 1840 to 19.5 million board feet in 1847 to about 100 million board feet in 1854 to about 200 million board feet per year around 1872. This was a huge output, but other river valleys in Wisconsin produced huge amounts too. Around 1871 the Wisconsin side of the Menominee River was said to produce about 300 million board feet, the Wolf River valley about 180 million board feet, the Black River valley 300 million board feet, the Chippewa River valley over 400 million feet, and the Wisconsin side of the St. Croix over 100 million board feet. With the railroad boom of the 1870s came an alternate means of transporting lumber which didn&#x27;t depend on spring floods, and went direct to places that the river didn&#x27;t flow. Nevertheless, rafting remained cheaper transport than railroads, and continued for some years. The last lumber rafts went down the Wisconsin River in 1888, from the sawmill at Biron, heading for St. Louis.

===Later industrialization===

Later, in the first half of the 20th century, more dams were constructed to provide for flood control and hydroelectricity. The dams also spurred tourism, creating reservoirs such as Lake Wisconsin that are popular areas for recreational boating and fishing. Today, the Wisconsin River is the hardest working river in the nation. Twenty-five hydroelectric power plants operate on the upper part of the river, above Prairie du Sac. In total, these power plants use 645 feet of the river&#x27;s drop to generate nearly one billion kilowatt-hours of renewable electricity a year — enough energy to power the homes of over 300,000 people - with minimal pollution.

Despite this, a 93-mile (150 km) stretch of the Wisconsin between its mouth and the Prairie du Sac Dam is free of any dams or barriers and is relatively free-flowing. In the late 1980s, this portion of the river was designated as a state riverway, and development alongside the river has been limited to preserve its scenic integrity.

==Navigable river of the United States==
The Wisconsin River is a &quot;navigable river of the United States.&quot; This designation primarily means that the federal government has jurisdiction for dams on the river. Dams that include hydropower facilities are regulated by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Courts have ruled that despite the fact that the river lies entirely in one state, it nevertheless historically carried goods to markets in other states and therefore is subject to the commerce clause of the United States Constitution. Courts have also ruled that raw logs, even if merely carried via log drives to mills within the state, constitute commerce. On the basis of these judgments, the Wisconsin River is considered a navigable waterway throughout its entire length. This designation does not generally have bearing on recreational use of the river. Boat registrations and fishing licenses are obtained through the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, for example.

==Lower Wisconsin River State Riverway==
The Lower Wisconsin River State Riverway is a state-funded project designed to protect the southern portion of the Wisconsin River. It extends from Sauk City to the point where the Wisconsin River empties into the Mississippi, about south of the city of Prairie du Chien. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources manages protected lands of over , including the river itself, islands, and some lands adjacent to the river. In 2020 the riverway was designated as a protected Ramsar site.

There are no dams or man-made obstructions to the natural flow of water between the hydroelectric dam just north of Sauk City and the confluence of the Wisconsin and the Mississippi. This long stretch of free-flowing river provides important natural habitats for a variety of wildlife, including white-tail deer, North American river otters, beavers, turtles, sandhill cranes, eagles, hawks, and a variety of fish species.

Recreational opportunities on the lower Wisconsin River range from fishing and canoeing to tubing and camping. Canoe camping is particularly popular because of the abundance of suitable sandbars along the riverway and because no permits are required. On summer weekends, naturists can be found on Mazo Beach which is north of the village of Mazomanie. According to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, two thirds of river users can be found on the stretch between Prairie du Sac and Spring Green.

<text>IDEO () is a design and consulting firm with offices in the U.S., England, and China. It was founded in Palo Alto, California, in 1991. The company&#x27;s 500 staff uses a design thinking approach to design products, services, environments, brands, and digital experiences.

In 1996, Steelcase took a majority ownership stake in the firm, which continued to operate independently. By the early 2000s, the company had expanded into management consulting and organizational design. In 2016, Japanese holding company Kyu Collective purchased a minority stake in the firm, with Steelcase continuing to hold a small stake.

==History==
IDEO was formed in 1991 by a merger of David Kelley Design (founded by Stanford University professor David Kelley in 1978), London-based Moggridge Associates and San Francisco&#x27;s ID Two (both founded by British-born Bill Moggridge, in 1969 and 1979, respectively), and Matrix Product Design (founded by Mike Nuttall in 1983). David Kelley Design was previously Hovey-Kelley Design, which was a partnership between David Kelley and Dean Hovey.
 Hovey-Kelley Design worked on the design for the computer mice for the Apple Lisa and the original Apple Macintosh.

In 1996, Office-furniture maker Steelcase took a majority ownership stake in IDEO, which continued to operate independently. Steelcase began divesting its shares through a five-year management buy-back program in 2007. By the early 2000s, IDEO had expanded into management consulting and organizational design. In 2016, Japanese holding company Kyu Collective purchased a minority stake in the firm.

While the company started with a focus on designing consumer products (e.g., toothbrush, personal assistant, computers), by 2001, IDEO began to widen its focus on consumer experiences and services.

In 2011, IDEO incubated IDEO.org — a registered 501(c)(3) nonprofit focused on doing work that centers people in poor and vulnerable communities.
In April 2019, the company announced that Sandy Speicher would replace Tim Brown as CEO of the company.
In November 2022, the company announced that Derek Robson would become CEO effective January 5, 2023.

===&quot;The Deep Dive&quot;===
On February 9, 1999, the ABC show &quot;Nightline&quot; featured IDEO in a segment called &quot;The Deep Dive: One Company&#x27;s Secret Weapon for Innovation&quot;. The segment featured Jack Smith of ABC touring the IDEO office and challenging the company to redesign the shopping cart in five days to demonstrate IDEO&#x27;s process for innovation. The result was a shopping cart with a nestable steel frame which holds removable plastic baskets to help deter theft and increase shopper flexibility. A dual child seat with a swing-up tray was also included in the design, as well as a cup holder, a barcode reader to skip the checkout line and steerable back wheels for manoeuvrability. The demonstration of IDEO&#x27;s innovation process has led to the segment becoming part of numerous curricula, including Project Lead the Way and multiple universities.

=== Acquisitions and partnerships ===
On October 17, 2017, IDEO acquired Datascope — a data science firm based in Chicago. Datascope has worked with IDEO as a consultant on many projects over the past four years. Tim Brown, Chair of IDEO, states that the acquisition is largely motivated by advances in data sciences and machine learning. These advances allow for a bigger focus in human-centered applications including facilitation of the design process. Datascope&#x27;s 15-person team will be moved to IDEO&#x27;s Chicago office.

With IDEO&#x27;s acquisition by Kyu, the firm increasingly partners with other member firms of the collective.

== Organizational culture ==
IDEO&#x27;s organizational culture consists of project teams, flat hierarchy, individual autonomy, creativity, and collaboration. The firm currently employs over 500 people across many disciplines, including: Behavioral Science, Branding, Business Design, Communication Design, Design Research, Digital Design, Education, Electrical Engineering, Environments Design, Food Science, Healthcare Services, Industrial Design, Interaction Design, Mechanical Engineering, Organizational Design, and Software Engineering.

== Products and services ==

IDEO has worked on projects in the consumer food and beverage, retail, computer, medical, educational, furniture, office, and automotive industries. Some examples include Apple&#x27;s first mouse, the Palm V PDA, and Steelcase&#x27;s Leap chair. Clients include Air New Zealand, Coca-Cola, ConAgra Foods, Eli Lilly, Ford, Medtronic, Mexichem, Sealy, ShinHo, and Steelcase among many others.

=== OpenIDEO ===

In August 2010, IDEO introduced OpenIDEO - a collaborative platform for the design process. OpenIDEO was designed to be an internal tool for IDEO to collaborate with clients, but it is now a public tool. The purpose of the tool is to virtually drive the creative process to solve social problems, allowing for people of different expertise and backgrounds to collaborate. Examples of projects that have been facilitated by OpenIDEO include various projects of the WWF and TEDPrize winner Jamie Oliver&#x27;s Food Revolution movement. In a collaboration with Sutter Health, London&#x27;s Helix Centre and Shoshana R. Ungerleider, they completed an OpenIDEO Challenge to &quot;reimagine the end of life experience&quot; which later led to the founding of international initiatives, End Well and Re:imagine.

=== Design education ===

IDEO U is an online educational program released in early 2015. Course participants are instructed on the concepts surrounding human-centered design thinking.

In addition to the online program, IDEO and its affiliates have released multiple books on design thinking, including New York Times best-selling &quot;Creative Confidence: Unleashing the Creative Potential Within Us All&quot;. Former CEO Tim Brown is the author of &quot;Change by Design: How Design Thinking Transforms Organizations and Inspires Innovation&quot; (2009) in which he argues that design can transform problems into opportunities – emphasizing design thinking as a human-centered activity, he specifically prizes the feeling of empathy, where designers are capable of understanding the perspectives and problems the end users face.

<text>In demonology, Corson is one of the four principal kings that have power over the seventy-two demons that are supposedly constrained by King Solomon, according to the Lesser Key of Solomon. Corson is not to be conjured except on great occasions.

He is the king of the west according to some translations of The Lesser Key of Solomon, and king of the south according to Pseudomonarchia Daemonum. The other three demon-kings of the cardinal directions are Amaymon, Ziminiar, and Gaap (although some translations of &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot; consider Belial, Beleth, Asmodai, and Gaap to be the kings of different cardinal directions, not specifying the cardinal direction that they rule over).

==Other spelling==
*Gorson

* Amaymon – the cardinal spirit of the east in &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;
* Gaap – the cardinal spirit of the south in &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;
* Ziminiar – the cardinal spirit of the north in &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;

<doc id="266262" wikidata="Q15304810" url="?curid=266262" title="Prime Minister of Romania">
<text>The prime minister of Romania (), officially the prime minister of the Government of Romania (), is the head of the Government of Romania. Initially, the office was styled &quot;President of the Council of Ministers&quot; (), when the term &quot;Government&quot; included more than the Cabinet, and the Cabinet was called the &quot;Council of Ministers&quot; (). The title was officially changed to &quot;Prime Minister&quot; by the 1965 Constitution of Romania during the communist regime.

The current prime minister is Marcel Ciolacu of the Social Democratic Party (PSD), who has been serving since 15 June 2023 onwards as the head of government of the National Coalition for Romania (CNR).

== Nomination ==

One of the roles of the president of the republic is to designate a candidate for the office of prime minister. The president must consult with the party that has the majority in the Parliament or, if no such majority exists, with the parties represented in Parliament.

Once designated, the candidate assembles a proposal for the governing program and the cabinet. The proposal must be approved by the Parliament within ten days through a motion of no confidence. Both the program and the cabinet membership are debated by the Parliament in a joint session of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The proposal is accepted only if a majority of all deputies and senators approve.

Once the vote of confidence is obtained, the candidate becomes the prime minister, and all cabinet members become ministers. The prime minister, the ministers, and other members of the Government take an oath before the president, as stipulated under Article 82 of the Constitution. The Government as a whole and each of its members exercise their mandate from the date of the oath.

== Functions ==

The prime minister directs the actions of the government and co-ordinates the activities of its members. The prime minister submits to the Chamber of Deputies or the Senate reports and statements on Government policy to be debated. As head of the government, the prime minister is charged with directing the internal policy of the country and leads the public administration. In this regard, the government cooperates with other interested social actors.

As with any other office of public authority, the office of prime minister is incompatible with any other office, except that of deputy or senator and is also incompatible with a professional position in a commercial organization. The term of a prime minister ends with the individual&#x27;s resignation, dismissal following a motion of no confidence, loss of electoral rights (following a conviction), incompatibility with the office, death or expiration of the term of the legislature. The prime minister, together with the minister tasked with the particular field of government, can sign resolutions and ordinances to take effect as executive orders the moment they are published in the , the official gazette of the Romanian state. Such ordinances must be sent to the appropriate chamber of Parliament, where they are discussed urgently, and they are then sent to the official gazette. In case the noticed chamber does not discuss or approve said ordinance after 30 days of its arrival, the ordinance is officially adopted and published in the gazette. An emergency ordinance cannot modify a constitutional law or concern the functioning of the fundamental institutions, rights, or liberties.

Unlike in the president-parliamentary semi-presidential systems, such as Russia, the Romanian prime minister is not a subordinate of the president, as he cannot outright dismiss the prime minister. The president can attend the government meetings debating upon matters of national interest concerning foreign policy, country&#x27;s defense, maintenance of public order, and, at the invitation of the prime minister, in other instances as well. The president will always chair the government meetings he attends.

In addition to his constitutional roles, the prime minister is, generally, the leader of the major party in the majority coalition that supports the government, although this is not always the case.

=== Relationship with Parliament ===

The Government and the other bodies of administration must submit all information, reports or documents requested by the Chamber of Deputies, Senate, or parliamentary committees as part of the parliamentary control of government.

The members of government are allowed to attend the works of Parliament, and they must do so at the request of the presidents of the chambers. The prime minister and the members of his Cabinet must answer all questions or interpellations brought forward by deputies or senators under the terms laid down in the statutes of Parliament. After such interpellations, the Chamber or the Senate can adopt a simple motion to express their position towards an issue of internal or external politics.

Parliament can dismiss an outgoing prime minister and his cabinet by adopting a motion of no confidence against the government. For a motion to be initiated, it must be signed by at least a quarter of deputies and senators, and for it to pass, a majority of deputies and senators must vote in favour of it. After a motion of no confidence is adopted, the prime minister and his Cabinet are officially dismissed, and the President must designate an individual to form a new government. Since 1989, five prime ministers have been dismissed following the adoption of a motion of no confidence: Emil Boc (2009), Mihai Răzvan Ungureanu (2012), Sorin Grindeanu (2017), Viorica Dăncilă (2019), and Florin Cîțu (2021).

== History ==
Originally styled President of the Council of Ministers, the office was first created in 1862 during the reign of Prince Alexandru Ioan Cuza. Cuza, unlike other monarchs of his time, was not a hereditary ruler. In 1859, he was elected Prince of Wallachia and Prince of Moldavia in two separate elections, thus de facto uniting the two principalities. By 1862, he had completely fused the two administrations into a single government with its capital at Bucharest, the new country bearing the name Romania, but the union was in danger of being dissolved after the end of his rule. A liberal, in favour of the two great reform projects envisioned by the liberals of the time (the electoral and agrarian reforms), Cuza did not publicly espouse his political preferences or position himself as the leader of a faction, preferring to keep the office of the Prince politically neutral. To give the country a political government, Cuza created the office of prime minister and brought into power the leader of the Conservative faction, Barbu Catargiu.

During the first years after its creation, the office held considerable authority, being able to challenge the will of the Prince and together with a Legislative Assembly composed mainly of conservatives and reactionaries, Catargiu&#x27;s conservative government was able to delay the adoption of several reforms. Frustrated by the government&#x27;s opposition to reforms and unable to work with an Assembly dominated by reactionary forces due to the censitary nature of the electoral system, Cuza launched a coup d&#x27;etat, followed by a constitutional referendum that replaced the Convention of Paris, an act that served as the constitution of the country, with his version named the Statute expanding the Paris Convention (). The new constitution created the Senate for serving Cuza&#x27;s legislative purposes and vested the office of the Prince with full executive authority while the prime minister remained his subordinate. Even though Cuza now had plenary powers, the office of the prime minister remained influential, and Mihail Kogălniceanu, the third prime minister, a liberal and former ally of Cuza, often clashed with him.

After Cuza&#x27;s removal by coup d&#x27;état in 1866 by a coalition formed by both members of the liberal and conservative factions, the political forces of the time settled on two objectives: bringing a foreign prince from a European noble family onto the country&#x27;s throne and drafting a liberal constitution. The 1866 Constitution confirmed that the prime minister served at the pleasure of the Prince, the latter being able to appoint and dismiss the former at any time and for any reason. Nevertheless, the prime minister still held considerable influence.

After World War I led to the creation of Greater Romania, another constitution was drafted in 1923 to reflect the changes the Romanian state had undergone since the Treaty of Versailles and the Treaty of Trianon. The new constitution limited the powers of the King, vesting the executive power entirely in the prime minister and his Cabinet, who now governed in the King&#x27;s name after the latter appointed him. The new constitution also made the first steps towards a parliamentary control of the government, stipulating that either of the chambers may put ministers under accusation to stand trial.

== Residence ==

The current residence of the prime minister is the Victoria Palace.

Initially designed to be the headquarters of the Foreign Ministry, Victoria Palace was the headquarters of the Foreign Ministry and Council of Ministers during the Communist period and became, in 1990, the headquarters of the first government of post-communist Romania.

The palace was declared a historical monument in 2004.

<doc id="266278" wikidata="Q201282" url="?curid=266278" title="Thomas Gore Browne">
<text>Colonel Sir Thomas Robert Gore Browne (3 July 1807 – 17 April 1887) was a British colonial administrator, who was Governor of St Helena, Governor of New Zealand, Governor of Tasmania and Governor of Bermuda.

==Early life==

Browne was born on 3 July 1807 in Aylesbury, in the county of Buckinghamshire, England, a son of Robert Browne and Sarah Dorothea . Of Irish extraction, the family had a military or church tradition; his father was a colonel in the Buckinghamshire Militia while his younger brother, Harold Browne, later became Bishop of Winchester.

==Military career==

In 1824, Browne kept up his family&#x27;s military tradition and joined the British Army as an ensign in the 44th Regiment of Foot. After four years, he transferred into the 28th Regiment of Foot. In 1832, and now a captain, he was appointed aide-de-camp to Baron Nugent, the High Commissioner of the Ionian Islands. He served in this role for three years, which included a spell as colonial secretary.

Now a major, Browne was posted to the 41st Regiment of Foot. In 1842, the regiment was dispatched to Afghanistan and fought in the First Anglo-Afghan War. He led the regiment for a time and commanded the rearguard as the British Army retreated from Khyber Pass into India. After his return from the campaign in Afghanistan, Browne was promoted lieutenant-colonel. He was also appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. In 1849, he exchanged into the 21st Regiment of Foot.

Browne retired from the British Army on half-pay in 1851 and shortly took up an appointment as Governor of the island of Saint Helena. He served in this capacity from July 1851 to December 1854, and during this time worked towards improving the island&#x27;s water supply.

== Marriage ==

In 1851, Browne married Harriet Louisa Campbell. His wife was a considerable support to his political career. She was over 20 years his junior and was well read, socially accomplished with a pleasant personality, and had an excellent understanding of the political environment in which she and her husband circulated. In addition to her influence over Browne, her hospitality and contribution to the social and cultural life during Browne&#x27;s placements assisted him in influencing others to support his political views.

==Governor of New Zealand==

In September 1855, Browne was appointed Governor of New Zealand, replacing Administrator Robert Wynyard. His handling of Māori land issues was a contributing factor in the outbreak of the First Taranaki War in a new phase of the New Zealand Wars: despite divisions among Waitara Māori over the ownership of land, Browne persisted with the purchase of the disputed Pekapeka block, further inflaming tensions between Māori and British settlers.

On 5 March 1860, Browne ordered the military occupation of the land, leading to the outbreak of war twelve days later. The following year, he negotiated a truce to end the fighting in the region. His governorship term ended in May 1861; rather than extend it, the Colonial Office in London replaced him with Sir George Grey.

The South Island town of Gore, New Zealand, was named after him.

==Governor of Tasmania==

In December 1861, Browne was appointed Governor of Tasmania. At the time, Tasmania was struggling economically and people were leaving for better employment prospects on the Australian mainland. To counter this, Browne implemented measures to encourage immigration. He also worked towards improving public education and training in the trades. A popular governor for most of his term, he lost goodwill when he displayed favouritism when filling a public service position. In January 1869, he left Australia for England. While in Melbourne, his point of departure from the country, his youngest child died.

==Later life==

After being appointed Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1869, Browne, with the assistance of Edward Cardwell, the Secretary of State for War, was appointed Administrator of Bermuda. This was to help secure Browne a pension and he served in this capacity from May 1870 to April 1871.

Brown died in London on 17 April 1887. He was survived by his wife, Harriet Louisa Browne . The couple had several children; the eldest son, Harold Browne, also served in the British Army and fought in the Boer War of 1899–1900, and took part in the defence of Ladysmith. His daughter, Ethel, married Hugh Locke King who built the Brooklands motor racing circuit in England, while his youngest son, Wilfrid was the first Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman in South Africa.

<doc id="266286" wikidata="Q1046755" url="?curid=266286" title="Don Mueang International Airport">
<text>Don Mueang International Airport — known as Bangkok International Airport before 2006 — is one of two international airports serving Bangkok, the capital of Thailand, the other being Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK).

The airport is considered one of the world&#x27;s oldest international airports and one of Asia&#x27;s oldest operating airports. It officially opened as a Royal Thai Air Force (RTAF) base on 27 March 1914, although it had been in use earlier. Commercial flights began in 1924, making it one of the world&#x27;s oldest commercial airports. The airport consists of Terminal 1 for international flights and Terminal 2 for domestic flights, which are connected by a unique glass exterior elevated walkway. The airport also featured an exterior walkway connected to the Amari hotel. The first commercial flight was an arrival by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines.

In September 2006, Don Mueang Airport was closed and to be replaced by the new Suvarnabhumi Airport, before reopening on 24 March 2007 after renovations. Since the reopening, Don Mueang has become a regional commuter flight hub and the &quot;de facto&quot; low-cost airline hub. In 2015, it became the world&#x27;s largest low-cost carrier airport. It still maintains its position as the second-busiest airport in the country.

Don Mueang previously carried the IATA airport code BKK, which was reassigned to Suvarnabhumi, and was an important hub of Asia and the hub of Thai Airways International prior to its closure. At its peak, it served the most air traffic for the entire country, with 80 airlines operating 160,000 flights and handling over 38 million passengers and 700,000 tons of cargo in 2004. It was then the 14th-busiest airport in the world and second in Asia by passenger volume. Currently, Don Mueang is the main operating base for Nok Air, Thai AirAsia, Thai AirAsia X and Thai Lion Air.

==History==

&quot;Don Mueang&quot; airfield was the second established in Thailand, after Sra Pathum Airfield, which is now Sra Pathum horse racing course, known as the Royal Bangkok Sports Club. The first flights to Don Mueang were made on 8 March 1914 and involved the transfer of aircraft of the Royal Thai Air Force. Three years earlier, Thailand had sent three army officers to France to train as pilots. On completion of their training in 1911, the pilots were authorized to purchase seven aircraft, three Breguets and four Nieuports, which formed the basis of the Royal Thai Air Force. Sra Pathum airfield was established in February 1911 with an arrival by Orville Wright, seven years after the invention of the first airplane by the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903.

In 1933, the airfield was the scene of heavy fighting between royalists and government forces during the Boworadet Rebellion. The airfield was used by the occupying Japanese during World War II, and was bombed and strafed by Allied aircraft on several occasions.

After the war had finished in September 1945, the airfield was occupied by the RAF during the brief British occupation of Thailand until March 1946 when 211 Squadron, which moved there in October 1945, was disbanded.

In May 2005, Thai Airways International introduced nonstop service between Bangkok and New York City using Airbus A340-500s.

===Closure===
The night of 27–28 September 2006 was the official end of operations at Don Mueang airport. The last commercial flights were:
* International departure: Although scheduled for Kuwait Airways KU414 to Kuwait at 02:50, Qantas flight QF302 to Sydney, originally scheduled for 18:00, was delayed for more than nine hours before finally taking off at 03:12, about ten minutes after the Kuwait flight. Qantas claimed that QF302 was an extra flight.
* International arrival: Kuwait Airways from Jakarta at 01:30
* Domestic departure: Thai Airways TG124 to Chiang Mai at 22:15 (coincidentally, when Thai moved domestic operations back to Don Mueang again on 28 March 2009, their last departure was also a 22:15 flight to Chiang Mai)
* Domestic arrival: Thai Airways TG216 from Phuket at 23:00

Before the opening of Suvarnabhumi, the airport used the IATA airport code BKK and the name was spelled &quot;Don Muang&quot;. After Suvarnabhumi opened for commercial flights, the spelling was changed and as &quot;Don Mueang&quot; it assigned the new IATA airport code DMK, though it still retains the ICAO airport code VTBD. The traditional spelling is still used by many airlines and by most Thais.

===Reopening===
Commercial carriers deserted Don Mueang at the opening of Suvarnabhumi Airport. But the higher operating costs of the new airport and safety concerns over cracked runways at the new airport caused many to seek a return to Don Mueang. Low-cost airlines led demands for a reopening of the airport. Airports of Thailand released a report at the end of 2006 which furthered this effort. The report proposed reopening DMK as a way to avoid or delay second-stage expansion which had been planned for Suvarnabhumi.

On 30 January 2007, the Ministry of Transport recommended temporarily reopening Don Mueang while touch up work proceeded on some taxiways at Suvarnabhumi. The recommendation was subject to approval by the Thai cabinet. On 25 March 2007, the airport officially reopened for some domestic flights.

Because of the 2011 Thailand floods that affected Bangkok and other parts of Thailand, the airport was closed as flood waters flowed onto the runways and affected the lighting. Don Mueang reopened on 6 March 2012.

On 16 March 2012, the Government of Thailand under Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra ordered all low-cost, chartered, and non-connecting flights to relocate to Don Mueang. This ended the single-airport policy. Airports of Thailand was ordered to encourage low-cost carriers to shift to Don Mueang to help ease congestion at Suvarnabhumi Airport. Suvarnabhumi Airport was designed to handle 45 million passengers per year, but it processed 48 million in 2011 and the number was expected to reach 53 million in 2012. Some ten airlines may relocate to Don Mueang. Budget airline Nok Air is already serving flights from and to Don Mueang. Nok Air handles about four million passengers per year. Orient Thai Airlines and Thai AirAsia have also started operations at Don Mueang. Thai AirAsia carried 7.2 million passengers in 2011. The number is projected to grow to eight million in 2012.

===Expansion===
As of 2012, Terminal 1 is capable of handling 18.5 million passengers annually. On 7 September 2013, Airports of Thailand announced its three billion baht renovation to reopen Terminal 2 as early as May 2014. Terminal 1&#x27;s passengers in 2013 will likely reach 16 million against its capacity of 18.5 million. Completion of Terminal 2 in December 2015 increases Don Mueang&#x27;s passenger capacity to 30 million a year.

The third phase of Don Mueang&#x27;s 36.8 billion baht expansion is scheduled to start in the second half of 2023 and will be completed in 2029. It aims to increase the airport&#x27;s passenger capacity to 50 million per year.

==Events==
On 7 September 2022 at 21:40 local time, an Airbus A380 made an emergency landing on runway 21R at Don Mueang.

On 30 August 2024, an Airbus Beluga (A300-600ST) made a technical stop at Don Mueang. It departed to China the following day.

==Terminals==
Don Mueang International Airport has three terminals. Terminal 1 is used for international flights and Terminal 2 for domestic flights. The opening of Terminal 2 has raised the airport&#x27;s capacity to 30 million passengers per year.

Terminal 3, the old domestic terminal, has been abandoned since 2011. The new Terminal 3 will have a capacity of 20 million passengers yearly and is scheduled to be completed by 2029. The 36.8 billion baht project will raise overall airport capacity from 30 to 50 million annually.

Don Mueang is voted 2024 10th overall terminal for low-cost airlines in the world by Skytrax.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Statistics==
In 2019, the airport reached its full capacity of 52 flights per hour or about 700–800 flights per day. By the end of 2019, it is expected to top its maximum passenger handling capacity of 40 million. Airport manager AoT forecasts 41 million passengers in 2020 and 45 million by 2023. The airport was designed to serve a maximum of 30 million passengers annually. Building additional runways is not possible. AoT is encouraging airlines to use wide-body aircraft at Don Mueang to increase passenger loads from 100–200 passengers to about 300 per aircraft.

===Passenger figures===


Total passenger traffic through Don Mueang jumped 40.7 percent to 30.3 million in 2015, with international numbers rising 53.1 percent to 9.17 million and domestic passengers increasing 35.9 percent to 21.1 million. Aircraft movements rose by 29.8 percent to 224,074, including 158,804 domestic (up 26.2 percent) and 65,270 international (up 39.3 percent).

* 23 September 1999 – Qantas Flight 1, a Boeing 747-400 (registered VH-OJH, named &quot;City of Darwin&quot;) in what was then the most serious incident in the airline&#x27;s famously safe jet aircraft history, a Boeing 747-400 overshot the runway causing significant damage but no casualties.
* 3 March 2001 – Thai Airways International Flight 114, a Boeing 737-400 (registered HS-TDC, named &quot;Narathiwat&quot;), bound for Chiang Mai from Bangkok, was destroyed by an explosion and fire that occurred about 35 minutes before Thaksin Shinawatra, later to become Prime Minister of Thailand, and about 150 other passengers were to board. Five members of the cabin crew were on board, and one was killed. Witnesses said they heard an explosion before flames erupted aboard the aircraft. Subsequently, NTSB investigators reported that the central fuel tank had exploded followed by the right tank 18 minutes later. The cause for the explosion was unclear, though some speculate it was an assassination attempt based on chemicals found during the subsequent investigation.

<text>In common law, a petit jury (or trial jury; pronounced or , depending on the jurisdiction) hears the evidence in a trial as presented by both the plaintiff (petitioner) and the defendant (respondent). After hearing the evidence and often jury instructions from the judge, the group retires for deliberation, to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or supermajority. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a hung jury. The size of the jury varies; in criminal cases involving serious felonies there are usually 12 jurors, although Scotland uses 15. A number of countries that are not in the English common law tradition have quasi-juries on which lay judges or jurors and professional judges deliberate together regarding criminal cases. However, the common law trial jury is the most common type of jury system.

In civil cases many trials require fewer than twelve jurors. Juries are almost never used in civil cases outside the United States and Canada. Other states with a common law tradition sometimes use them in defamation cases, in cases involving a governmental eminent domain power, and in cases involving alleged wrongful conviction. Civil law countries generally do not use civil juries. Civil juries are available in the United States and Canada in almost all cases where the only remedy sought is money damages.

<text>Chiang Mai International Airport is an international airport in Suthep subdistrict, Mueang Chiang Mai district, Chiang Mai province in northern Thailand. It is a major gateway that links northern Thailand to the rest of the region and is currently the fourth-busiest airport in the country. It is managed by Airports of Thailand.

==History==


The airport began operations in 1934 as Suthep Airport, after it developed as an airstrip in the early 1920s. Until World War Two, it was used mainly for postal delivery services, with some military use. During the war, it was used by the occupying Japanese forces, and was hence attacked by British and US air forces.

The first scheduled passenger flight to Chiang Mai arrived in 1947, with the foundation of Siamese Airways. At this time and until the late 1950s the runway surface was still grass or dirt, with very few support buildings. 

Upgrades in 2014 included expanding the apron for larger planes, extending operating hours to 24/7 (effective April 2014), and enlarging the international arrival hall and domestic departure hall.

Airports of Thailand expanded the terminal with upgrades in 2014 including expansion of the apron for larger planes, extending operating hours to 24/7 (effective April 2014), and enlarging the international arrival hall and domestic departure hall. As of 2018, 31 airlines operated at CNX, serving 11 million passengers, 78,210 flights and 14,612 tonnes of cargo.

As a result of the temporary closure of Suvarnabhumi Airport in 2008 due to the protests, Chiang Mai was used as an alternative stopover for China Airlines flights between Taipei and Europe and for Swiss International Air Lines&#x27; Singapore-Zurich flights. On 24 January 2011, the airport became a secondary hub for Thai AirAsia. China Airlines subsequently regularised the stopover.

==Facilities==
The airport is at an elevation of above mean sea level. It has one runway designated 18/36 with an asphalt surface measuring . There are two terminals, one for domestic passengers and the other for international flights.

<doc id="266302" wikidata="Q240694" url="?curid=266302" title="Phuket International Airport">
<text>Phuket International Airport is an international airport serving the island of Phuket and its province in southern Thailand. It is located north of downtown Phuket in the Mai Khao subdistrict of Thalang district. The airport plays a major role in Thailand&#x27;s tourism industry, as Phuket is a popular resort destination. It is the third-busiest airport in Thailand in terms of passengers, after Suvarnabhumi Airport and Don Mueang International Airport in the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. The airport set a record of 15.1 million arrivals and departures in 2016, up 17.8 percent from 2015.

==Facilities==
===Terminals===


Phuket International Airport features three distinct terminals to manage its air traffic. Terminal 2 is designated for international flights, while Terminal 3 handles domestic flights. Terminal X, specifically intended for charter flights, was opened in February 2014.

To accommodate increasing passenger traffic, Phuket International Airport underwent a significant expansion and renovation project, which was completed in 2016 at a cost of 5.14 billion baht. This expansion of the new international terminal increased its capacity to handle 12.5 million passengers annually. Overall, the expansion enhanced the airport&#x27;s total capacity from 6.5 million to 20 million passengers per year.

In light of the airport&#x27;s congestion and limited space for further expansion, a proposal for a rail link from Krabi International Airport, an alternate location, was put forward in 2012. This suggestion aimed to alleviate the growing traffic and logistical challenges faced by Phuket Airport.

==Future==
A proposal for a new international airport has been put forward, aimed at serving three provinces: Phang Nga, Phuket, and Krabi. The construction of this airport is planned to be carried out in two phases. The first phase of the project was anticipated to be completed by 2025, but in 2022, the entire proposal was put on hold. The new airport was intended to function as an alternative to the existing Phuket and Krabi airports, offering additional capacity and potentially alleviating air traffic congestion in the region.

==Airlines and destinations==

==Traffic statistics==

<text>Mae Fah Luang - Chiang Rai International Airport is in Ban Du subdistrict, Mueang Chiang Rai district, Chiang Rai province in northern Thailand. The airport is about 8 km from the city center. Since 1998, it has been managed by the Airports of Thailand Public Company Limited (AOT). In 2013, the airport handled over 1,000,000 passengers and 7,000 passenger flights. The airport had international flight facilities and served a few international routes to Macau, Singapore, Kuala Lumpur, Kunming, Haikou, Hangzhou, Changsha, Xishuangbanna, Shenzhen, and Chengdu, all of which were suspended due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since travel restrictions were imposed in China, there have been no international commercial flights connecting Chiang Rai to the global market. Thus, the airport has been seeking other possible routes to connect to such as to South Korea.

In 2014, Airports of Thailand (AOT) announced that they would expand Chiang Rai Airport. The plans include building an additional taxiway and more shops, and possibly extending the runway. This should be completed in 2030.

Chiang Rai International Airport was named &quot;Mae Fah Luang&quot;, after Princess Srinagarindra, mother of the previous monarch, Bhumibol Adulyadej, reigning under the dynastic name of Rama IX.

==Expansion==
Since the relaxation of COVID-19 travel restrictions, the airport is handling approximately 3,900 passengers per day. However, there are still no international flights operating to the airport. Airports of Thailand has approved expansion plans for the airport to attract international carriers and improve the experience for passengers using the airport&#x27;s facilities. This includes improvements to the airport&#x27;s entrance and exit roads, the construction of a Maintenance Repair Operation centre (MRO) for aircraft maintenance, and the construction of a parallel taxiway.

The construction of the aircraft maintenance facility is set to be completed by 31 July 2023. The facility will be able to service and repair large Airbus and Boeing aircraft from China. The airport will also become a cargo transportation hub for the northern region of Thailand.

<text>Tishrei () or Tishri (; &quot;tīšrē&quot; or &quot;tīšrī&quot;; from Akkadian &quot;tašrītu&quot; &quot;beginning&quot;, from &quot;šurrû&quot; &quot;to begin&quot;) is the first month of the civil year (which starts on 1 Tishrei) and the seventh month of the ecclesiastical year (which starts on 1 Nisan) in the Hebrew calendar. The name of the month is Babylonian. It is a month of 30 days. Tishrei usually occurs in September–October on the Gregorian calendar.

In the Hebrew Bible the month is called Ethanim ( – ), or simply the seventh month. In the Babylonian calendar the month is known as Araḫ Tišritum, &quot;Month of Beginning&quot; (of the second half-year).

Edwin R. Thiele has concluded, in &quot;The Mysterious Numbers of the Hebrew Kings&quot;, that the ancient Kingdom of Judah counted years using the civil year starting in Tishrei, while the Kingdom of Israel counted years using the ecclesiastical new year starting in Nisan. Tishrei is the month used for the counting of the epoch year – i.e., the count of the year is incremented on 1 Tishrei.

==Holidays ==

* 1–2 Tishrei – Rosh Hashanah
* 3 Tishrei – Tzom Gedaliah – (&quot;Fast Day&quot;) – &quot;On Tishrei 4 when Tishrei 3 is Shabbat&quot;
* 9 Tishrei – Erev Yom Kippur
* 10 Tishrei – Yom Kippur – (&quot;Fast Day&quot;)
* 15–21 Tishrei – Sukkot/Sukkos
* 21 Tishrei – Hoshanah Rabbah
* 22 Tishrei (and 23 outside of Israel) – Shemini Atzeret/Atzeres &amp; Simchat Torah/Simchas Torah

<doc id="266306" wikidata="Q643051" url="?curid=266306" title="Cheshvan">
<text>Marcheshvan (Hebrew: , , ; from Akkadian , literally, &#x27;eighth month&#x27;), generally shortened to Cheshvan (, ), is the second month of the civil year (which starts on 1 Tishrei), and the eighth month of the ecclesiastical year (which starts on 1 Nisan) on the Hebrew calendar.

In a regular () year, Marcheshvan has 29 days, but because of the Rosh Hashanah postponement rules, in some years, an additional day is added to Marcheshvan to make the year a &quot;full&quot; () year. Marcheshvan occurs in October–November in the Gregorian calendar.

The Hebrew Bible, before the Babylonian Exile, refers to the month as Bul (). In Sidon, the reference to is also made on the Sarcophagus of Eshmunazar II dated to the early 5th century BC.

==Etymology==
Compared to its Akkadian etymon , the name displays the same lenition of ungeminated to found in other month names (Tammuz traditionally contains mem with dagesh). Uniquely to this name the initial has also changed to , giving the overall effect of a metathesis.
In the modern form, with the connection to the roots &quot;w-r-ḥ&quot; (&#x27;moon&#x27;, &#x27;month&#x27;) and &quot;š-m-n&quot; (&#x27;eight&#x27;) no longer apparent, the first two letters (&quot;mar&quot;) have been re-interpreted as the Hebrew word for &#x27;bitter&#x27;, alluding to the fact that the month has no holidays or fasts. In other contexts, the word is attributed to mean &quot;droplet&quot;, associating this month with the rainy season.

==Events ==
* 7 Marcheshvan: The prayer (&#x27;deliver dew and rain&#x27;) is added to the Shemoneh Esrei prayers in Israel. If no rain has fallen by the 17th of the month, special prayers are added for rain.
* Fast of Behav: According to the custom of most Eastern Ashkenazic communities, on the first Sabbath after Rosh Chodesh Cheshvan, a prayer is recited on behalf of all those who are going to fast on Bahab. Bahab, or in Hebrew , stands for 2, 5, 2, i.e., Monday (2nd day of the week), Thursday (5th day), and another Monday. On the Monday, Thursday, and second Monday after the Sabbath, it is customary in many communities (mostly Ashkenazic, although there were some Sephardic communities who adopted this custom as well) to fast and/or to recite penitential prayers called Selichot. According to the Western Ashkenazic rite, as well as some Eastern Ashkenazic communities (especially Hungarian communities), the second Monday of Bahab is the Monday before Rosh Chodesh Kislev, the Thursday is the Thursday preceding that, the first Monday is the Monday preceding that, and the Sabbath in which the prayer is recited is the Sabbath preceding that. Bahab is also observed at the beginning of Iyar; in Iyar it is observed at the beginning of the month in both Eastern and Western Ashkenazic rites.
* Sigd: The Ethiopian Jewish community celebrates Sigd on the 29th day of Marcheshvan, 50 days from Yom Kippur, analogous to counting 50 days from Pesach to Shavuot. Israel officially recognized Sigd as a national holiday in 2008, and it is observed annually on 29 Cheshvan.

<text>An outlaw, in its original and legal meaning, is a person declared as outside the protection of the law. In pre-modern societies, all legal protection was withdrawn from the criminal, so anyone was legally empowered to persecute or kill them. Outlawry was thus one of the harshest penalties in the legal system. In early Germanic law, the death penalty is conspicuously absent, and outlawing is the most extreme punishment, presumably amounting to a death sentence in practice. The concept is known from Roman law, as the status of &quot;homo sacer&quot;, and persisted throughout the Middle Ages.

A secondary meaning of outlaw is a person systematically avoiding capture by evasion and violence. These meanings are related and overlapping but not necessarily identical. A fugitive who is declared outside protection of law in one jurisdiction but who receives asylum and lives openly and obedient to local laws in another jurisdiction is an outlaw in the first meaning but not the second (one example being William John Bankes). A fugitive who remains formally entitled to a form of trial if captured alive but avoids capture because of the high risk of conviction and severe punishment if tried is an outlaw in the second sense but not the first (Sándor Rózsa was tried and sentenced merely to a term of imprisonment when captured).

In the common law of England, a &quot;writ of outlawry&quot; made the pronouncement &quot;Caput lupinum&quot; (&quot;[Let his be] a wolf&#x27;s head&quot;), equating that person with a wolf in the eyes of the law. Not only was the subject deprived of all legal rights, being outside the &quot;law&quot;, but others could kill him on sight as if he were a wolf or other wild animal. Women were declared &quot;waived&quot; rather than outlawed, but it was effectively the same punishment.

==Legal history==

===Ancient Rome===
Among other forms of exile, Roman law included the penalty of &quot;aquae et ignis interdictio&quot; (&quot;interdiction of water and fire&quot;). Such people penalized were required to leave Roman territory and forfeit their property. If they returned, they were effectively outlaws; providing them the use of fire or water was illegal, and they could be killed at will without legal penalty.

The interdiction of water and fire was traditionally imposed by the tribune of the plebs and is attested to have been in use during the First Punic War of the third century BC by Cato the Elder. It was later also applied by many other officials, such as the Senate, magistrates, and Julius Caesar as a general and provincial governor during the Gallic Wars. It fell out of use during the early Empire.

===England===

In English common law, an outlaw was a party who had defied the laws of the realm by such acts as ignoring a summons to court or fleeing instead of appearing to plead when charged with a crime. The earliest reference to outlawry in English legal texts appears in the 8th century.

====Criminal====
The term &quot;outlawry &quot;refers to the formal procedure of declaring someone an outlaw, i.e., putting him outside legal protection. In the common law of England, a judgment of (criminal) outlawry was one of the harshest penalties in the legal system since the outlaw could not use the legal system for protection, e.g., from mob justice. To be declared an outlaw was to suffer a form of civil or social death. The outlaw was debarred from all civilized society. No one was allowed to give him food, shelter, or any other sort of support—to do so was to commit the crime of aiding and abetting, and to be in danger of the ban oneself. A more recent concept of &quot;wanted dead or alive&quot; is similar but implies that a trial is desired (namely if the wanted person is returned alive), whereas outlawry precludes a trial. 

An outlaw might be killed with impunity, and it was not only lawful but meritorious to kill a thief fleeing from justice—to do so was not murder. A man who slew a thief was expected to declare the fact without delay; otherwise, the dead man&#x27;s kindred might clear his name by their oath and require the slayer to pay weregild as for a true man.

By the rules of common law, a criminal outlaw did not need to be guilty of the crime for which he was an outlaw. If a man was accused of treason or felony but failed to appear in court to defend himself, he was deemed convicted. If he was accused of a misdemeanour, then he was guilty of a serious contempt of court which was itself a capital crime.

In the context of criminal law, outlawry faded out, not so much by legal changes as by the greater population density of the country, which made it harder for wanted fugitives to evade capture, and by the adoption of international extradition pacts. It was obsolete when the offence was abolished in 1938. Outlawry was, however, a living practice as of 1855: in 1841, William John Bankes, who had previously been an MP for several different constituencies between 1810 and 1835, was outlawed by due process of law for absenting himself from trial for homosexuality and died in 1855 in Venice as an outlaw.

====Civil====
There was also a doctrine of civil outlawry. Civil outlawry did not carry the sentence of capital punishment. It was, however, imposed on defendants who fled or evaded justice when sued for civil actions like debts or torts. The punishments for civil outlawry were harsh, including confiscation of chattels (movable property) left behind by the outlaw.

In the civil context, outlawry became obsolete in civil procedure by reforms that no longer required summoned defendants to appear and plead. Still, the possibility of being declared an outlaw for derelictions of civil duty continued to exist in English law until the passing of the Civil Procedure Acts Repeal Act 1879 (42 &amp; 43 Vict. c. 59) in 1879 and in Scots law until the late 1940s. Since then, failure to find the defendant and serve process is usually interpreted in favour of the plaintiff, and harsh penalties for mere nonappearance (merely presumed flight to escape justice) no longer apply. 

===In other countries===

Outlawry also existed in other ancient legal codes, such as the ancient Norse and Icelandic legal code.

In early modern times, the term Vogelfrei and its cognates came to be used in Germany, the Low Countries, and Scandinavia, referring to a person stripped of his civil rights being &quot;free&quot; for the taking like a bird. In Germany and Slavic countries during the 15th to 19th centuries, groups of outlaws were composed of former prisoners, soldiers, etc. Hence, they became an important social phenomenon. They lived off of robbery, and local inhabitants from lower classes often supported their activity. The best known are Juraj Jánošík and Jakub Surovec in Slovakia, Oleksa Dovbush in Ukraine, Rózsa Sándor in Hungary, Schinderhannes and Hans Kohlhase in Germany.

The concept of outlawry was reintroduced to British law by several Australian colonial governments in the late 19th century to deal with the menace of bushranging. The Felons Apprehension Act (1865 No 2a) of New South Wales provided that a judge could, upon proof of sufficiently notorious conduct, issue a special bench warrant requiring a person to submit themselves to police custody before a given date, or be declared an outlaw. An outlawed person could be apprehended &quot;alive or dead&quot; by any of the Queen&#x27;s subjects, &quot;whether a constable or not&quot;, and without &quot;being accountable for using of any deadly weapon in aid of such apprehension.&quot; Similar provisions were passed in Victoria and Queensland. Although the provisions of the New South Wales Felons Apprehension Act were not exercised after the end of the bushranging era, they remained on the statute book until 1976.

==As a political weapon==
There have been several instances in military and political conflicts throughout history whereby one side declares the other as being &quot;illegal&quot;, notorious cases being the use of proscription in the civil wars of the Roman Republic. In later times there was the notable case of Napoleon Bonaparte whom the Congress of Vienna, on 13 March 1815, .

In modern times, the government of the First Spanish Republic, unable to reduce the Cantonal rebellion centered in Cartagena, Spain, declared the Cartagena fleet to be &quot;piratic&quot;, which allowed any nation to prey on it. Taking the opposite road, some outlaws became political leaders, such as Ethiopia&#x27;s Kassa Hailu who became Emperor Tewodros II of Ethiopia. The nobleman Prince William of Orange was declared an outlaw, an enemy of the state and Christendom itself for his involvement in the Dutch revolt and ensuing Eighty Years&#x27; War. This led to his death at the hands of Balthasar Gérard, who was promised a general pardon, 25.000 golden crowns and ascension into the nobility, but was caught and hanged, drawn and quartered for the offence of high treason instead by the court at Delft.
==Popular usage==

Though the judgment of outlawry is now obsolete (even though it inspired the &quot;pro forma&quot; Outlawries Bill which is still to this day introduced in the British House of Commons during the State Opening of Parliament), romanticised outlaws became stock characters in several fictional settings. This was particularly so in the United States, where outlaws were popular subjects of 19th-century newspaper coverage and stories and 20th-century fiction and Western movies. Thus, &quot;outlaw&quot; is still commonly used to mean those violating the law or, by extension, those living that lifestyle, whether actual criminals evading the law or those merely opposed to &quot;law and order&quot; notions of conformity and authority (such as the &quot;outlaw country&quot; music movement in the 1970s).

<text>John Joseph William Molesworth Oxley (1784 – 25 May 1828) was an English explorer and surveyor of Australia in the early period of British colonisation. He served as Surveyor General of New South Wales and is perhaps best known for his two expeditions into the interior of New South Wales and his exploration of the Tweed River and the Brisbane River in what is now the state of Queensland.

== Early life ==
John Oxley was born in 1784 at Kirkham Abbey near Westow in Yorkshire, England, and baptised at Bulmer in St Martin&#x27;s Church on 6 July 1784. He was the eldest of eight children of John and Arabella Oxley and was a Protestant.

== Naval career ==
In 1799 (aged 15), he entered the Royal Navy as a midshipman on the . He travelled to Australia in October 1802 as master&#x27;s mate of the naval vessel , which carried out coastal surveying (including the survey of Western Port), and this first stay in the Colonies would last for five years. In 1805, Oxley became acting lieutenant of the &quot;Buffalo&quot; and traveled to Van Diemen&#x27;s Land the following year in charge of the &quot;Estramina&quot;.

He returned to England in 1807 and from there he was appointed first lieutenant of , a British sloop of war that was stationed at NSW. To take up this appointment he sailed out again to NSW on the &quot;Speke&quot; as part of the Transport Board. He arrived in November 1808 with £800 of freight transport. In 1809 &quot;Porpoise&quot; visited Van Diemen&#x27;s Land, carrying as a passenger Governor William Bligh, who had been deposed in the Rum Rebellion. When Bligh was deposed, Oxley denied he supported Macarthur but his letters showed that he was close to him. In 1810, Oxley returned to England. During this period, Oxley sought the positions of Naval Officer and Surveyor-General. He retired from the Navy in 1811 and was briefly in an engagement to Elizabeth Macarthur the following year.

== Surveyor General ==
In 1812, Oxley travelled to Sydney as Surveyor-General of the &quot;Minstrel&quot;. Oxley&#x27;s appointment was at the time of Lachlan Macquarie&#x27;s Governorship. Macquarie encouraged exploration – he had sent George Evans to confirm the exploratory work of Wentworth, Blaxland and Lawson over the Blue Mountains, instigated the building of the road over the Blue Mountains in 1814–1815, and had travelled to Bathurst immediately William Cox had completed it. From there he had sent George Evans on an expedition of exploration up the Lachlan River in May 1815.

Now Macquarie wanted the Lachlan and Macquarie River explored thoroughly. Opening up of the new lands over the mountains had created enthusiasm for further discoveries about them and the Macquarie River. Mysteriously, the Macquarie and the Lachlan flowed westwards to the interior of the country and not easterly towards the coastline. Successively, in 1817 and 1818 Governor Macquarie appointed John Oxley in charge of two expeditions to investigate these rivers.

On the 1817 Lachlan expedition, Oxley was to come across marshy country and conclude this inland area was uninhabitable. If he had pressed on for two more days he would have reached the Murrumbidgee River. Oxley reported that, in his opinion, the Lachlan flowed into an extensive series of swamps, &quot;which were, perhaps, the margin of a great inland sea.&quot;
Similarly, the Macquarie expedition the following year in 1818 came to a halt on that river at the Macquarie Marshes in a good season for the marshes as the Macquarie was in flood replenishing these vital wetlands. Oxley tried hard to proceed through them but couldn&#x27;t do so. He returned to the encampment of the rest of his party now convinced that these westward flowing rivers terminated in an inland sea, and he had been on the swampy edge of it.

Through Oxley, the theory of the Australian inland sea was fed and perpetuated,

===Lachlan River expedition, 1817===

In March 1817 John Oxley was instructed to take charge of an expedition to explore and survey the course of the Lachlan River. He left Sydney on 6 April 1817 with George Evans as second-in-command, and Allan Cunningham as a botanist. The previous year, Evans had accompanied Macquarie over the Blue Mountains to Bathurst on the celebratory completion of Cox&#x27;s road, where Macquarie had directed him on an exploratory journey which resulted in Evans reaching and naming the Lachlan River west of Bathurst in May 1815. The party also included William Parr as a mineralogist and draftsman.

Oxley&#x27;s party reached Bathurst after a week, where they were briefly detained by bad weather. On 25 April 1817, they reached the Lachlan River Depot which had been prepared for them (with provisions and supplies) in advance by a separate party under the direction of William Cox. From here, they commenced following its course, with part of the stores being conveyed in boats. As the exploring party travelled westward the country surrounding the rising river was found to be increasingly inundated. On 12 May, west of the present township of Forbes, they found their progress impeded by an extensive marsh. They travelled down a northern branch of the river to Mount Mulguthery where they were forced to return up the river.

After retracing their route for a short distance they then proceeded in a south-westerly direction through Ungarie and past Weethalle, intending to travel overland to the southern Australian coastline. By the end of May, the party found themselves in a dry scrubby country northeast of Yenda where they ascended several peaks in the Cocoparra National Park. Shortage of water and the death of two horses forced Oxley&#x27;s return, passing near Rankins Springs to the Lachlan River.

On 23 June the Lachlan River near Merrigal Bridge was reached: &quot;we suddenly came upon the banks of the river… which we had quitted nearly five weeks before&quot;. They followed the course of the Lachlan River through Hillston and Booligal for a fortnight. The party encountered much-flooded country and reached a point five kilometres south-west of Booligal which was their last campsite. On 7 July Oxley proceeded another 16 km along the flooded river and recorded that &quot;it was with infinite regret and pain that I was forced to conclude, that the interior of this vast country is a marsh and uninhabitable&quot;. Oxley resolved to turn back and after resting for two days the exploring party began to retrace their steps along the Lachlan River.

They left the Lachlan at Kiacatoo up-stream of the present site of Lake Cargelligo and crossed to the Bogan River and then across to the Wellington Valley on the upper waters of the Macquarie River, which they followed back to Bathurst (arriving on 29 August 1817). The Wellington Valley would later be made the site of a convict settlement mostly for convict &#x27;specials&#x27;.

===Macquarie River expedition, 1818===
Although disappointed by his Lachlan expedition, in not following the river all the way to its end, John Oxley took up Macquarie&#x27;s next directive to explore the Macquarie River. He departed from Bathurst on 28 May 1818 with an exploration party that comprised Deputy Surveyor General George Evans, Oxley&#x27;s friend Dr John Harris, a botanist named Charles Frazer, and twelve convict men. The names of the twelve convict men were later recorded by Governor Macquarie in his diary, upon the party&#x27;s eventual return to Sydney. &quot;The following are their Names: William Warner, Patrick Byrne, James Blake, George Simpson, James Williams, John Williams, Francis Lloyd, Barnard Butler, Thomas Ellis, John Dwyer, Richard Watts, Henry Shippey.&quot; He also noted that the first five men listed had also been with Oxley on the previous year&#x27;s 1817 exploratory journey to the Lachlan.

They also took boats with them and nearly two dozen horses. The party would get upriver to the Macquarie Marshes, turn north-east to the Warrumbungle mountains crossing the Castlereagh River in the process, view the rich Liverpool Plains, come across the Peel River and the Hastings River to reach the NSW coast and the site of present-day Port Macquarie. These European sightings delivered a real boost to the NSW colony.

On 12 June 1818 Oxley was near the site that would become Dubbo. He wrote that he had passed that day &#x27;over a very beautiful country, thinly wooded and apparently safe from the highest floods...&#x27;. they continued to follow the Macquarie River through land that became increasingly flat. On 27 June they spotted a small hill and named it Mt Harris in honour of John Harris accompanying him. On the same day the mountains in the distance to the east (now known by their Aboriginal name, the Warrumbungles) were named Arbuthnot&#x27;s Ranges for the Rt Hon C. Arbuthnot of H.M. Treasury. Mt Harris is 54 km N-NW of present-day Warren.

They continued by boat and horses until they reached the Macquarie Marshes where it spread out through the reeds and Oxley was unable to locate the course of the river any further downstream. He wrote:

&quot;But if an opinion may be permitted to be hazarded from actual appearances, mine is decidedly in favour of our being in the immediate vicinity of an inland sea, or lake, most probably a shoal one, and gradually filling up by numerous depositions from the high lands, left by waters which flow into it.&quot;

From here he retraced steps to Mt Harris, NW of present-day Warren, and camped from early July while he sent George Evans forward with a few men to scout a route to the north-east. On Evans&#x27; return, the expedition crossed the river that Oxley would name the Castlereagh, went towards the Warrumbungle Mountains, which he named at the time &#x27;Arbuthnot&#x27;s Range&#x27; and easterly through the Gooriananwa Gap From here they moved forward to come upon the rich soil of the Liverpool Plains.

On 26 August 1818 they climbed a hill and saw before them rich, fertile land (Peel River), near the present site of Tamworth. Continuing further east they crossed the Great Dividing Range passing by the Apsley Falls on 13 September 1818 which Oxley named the Bathurst Falls. He described it as &quot;one of the most magnificent waterfalls we have seen&quot;.

Upon reaching the Hastings River the exploring party followed it to its mouth, discovering that it flowed into the sea at a spot which Oxley named Port Macquarie.

In his diary of 27 November 1818, Governor Macquarie listed the twelve men who accompanied Oxley and Evans on this expedition (see above). He wrote:
&quot;I inspected and spoke to the 12 Men who Accompanied Mr. Oxley on his last Expedition – and in his own presence returned them my thanks for their steady good and obedient Conduct on the Expedition; and being all Convicts I have promised to give them Conditional Pardons as a reward for their good behaviour.&quot;

=== Shoalhaven and Jervis Bay expedition, 1819 ===
Oxley and Assistant Surveyor-General James Meehan led two separate but concurrent expeditions, in late 1819. Oxley proceeded down the coast by sea to the Shoalhaven. Meehan went overland, starting from the Minnamurra River and meeting Oxley at the Shoalhaven. Oxley&#x27;s report of good soils in the area increased interest in agricultural settlement around Gerringong and the Shoalhaven. Oxley&#x27;s report of the western shore of Jervis Bay, was far less favourable. He stated, &quot;&quot;&quot;We saw no place on which even a Cabbage might be planted with a prospect of success&quot; and that &quot;perhaps a more miserable sterile Country was never traversed by man&quot;&quot;&quot;.

===Oxley&#x27;s 1823 expedition to Brisbane River===
In 1823, Governor Brisbane sent Oxley north by boat in search of a site for an alternative penal settlement for the most difficult convicts. On this journey, he visited the Tweed River and valley and was deeply impressed, recording his impressions as follows:
&quot;A deep rich valley clothed with magnificent trees, the beautiful uniformity of which was only interrupted by the turns and windings of the river, which here and there appeared like small lakes. The background was Mt. Warning. The view was altogether beautiful beyond description. The scenery here exceeded anything I have previously seen in Australia.&quot; As Surveyor General, Oxley made a close examination of the Tweed River and Port Curtis, and sources connected that investigation, principally the manuscript journal kept by Oxley, and the published &quot;Narrative&quot; of John Uniack, who accompanied Oxley.

Oxley sailed northwards in the to Port Curtis, surveying its waterways. Deciding not to continue to Port Bowen, he returned south and entered Moreton Bay, between Skirmish Point (Bribie Island) believed at the time to be a mainland peninsula, and Moreton Island. Here he came across two convict castaways; Cedar Getters, who were swept far out to sea whilst sailing to Five Islands (Illawarra) under the instruction of their employer; William Cox. They had been living with the Aboriginal people of Moreton Bay since being shipwrecked on Moreton Island, slowly making their way north believing they were still south of Sydney. With their assistance, Oxley was shown, and named, the Brisbane River. He recommend this place for the site of the convict settlement, which became Moreton Bay, and later the city of Brisbane. A monument was built at North Quay in 1924 to commemorate the site of his landing in Brisbane. 

In 1824 Oxley, accompanied by Allan Cunningham returned to the Brisbane River and, travelling further up, then located the Bremer River.

== Personal life ==
Oxley was a Protestant and subscribed to both the Anglican Church and Presbyterian Church where he was one of the congregation.

Governor Lachlan Macquarie granted Oxley near Camden in 1810, which he increased to in 1815. Oxley named this property &quot;Kirkham&quot; after his birthplace and raised and bred sheep there. He also kept a substantial town house in Sydney. Oxley was briefly a director of the Bank of New South Wales. He was one of five members of the original 1824 New South Wales Legislative Council, but was not reappointed when the council was reconstituted in 1825.

Oxley had three daughters out of wedlock with two women, before he married a third woman. Two of these daughters were with Charlotte Thorpe and born before his inland expeditions: Jeanette b. 1813 who died in 1875 and is buried in the historic cemetery at South Head, and Frances b. 1815 who married William Waugh and is buried in Tenterfield. He had another daughter, Louisa b. 1821, with Elizabeth Marmon. This child drowned (aged 3) in early December 1824 in a well opposite Oxley&#x27;s house in Macquarie Street, Sydney. The newspaper report was as follows:

In October 1821, Oxley married Emma Norton (1798–1885) at St Philip&#x27;s Anglican Church. Emma was the youngest sister of the solicitor James Norton and had followed him out to New South Wales from Sussex after he had established himself as an attorney in the colony. Oxley and Emma Norton had a daughter and two sons. The elder, John Norton Oxley became a Member of the Legislative Assembly, representing the Western Division of Camden, in the first Parliament after the establishment of responsible government in 1856. He sponsored the &quot;Broad Gauge Act&quot; which encouraged the use of wagons with broad wheels instead of narrow-tired drays in order to cause less wear on public roads; this measure made him unpopular with the farmers and carriers in his electorate and he lost his seat. The younger son, Henry Oxley, also became a Member of the Legislative Assembly, representing the Electoral district of Camden between 1859 and 1860.

Oxley suffered with illness throughout his service, caused by the difficulties of his expeditions. He finally succumbed to his illness and died at age 44 on 25 May 1828 at his &quot;Kirkham&quot; property, Kirkham, New South Wales, outside Camden. The funeral service was held at St James Anglican Church and attended by many prominent dignitaries. He was buried in the Devonshire Street Cemetery in Sydney. An obituary notice was published in the &quot;Government Gazette&quot; of 27 May 27, 1828.

<text>Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport — colloquially Mascot Airport, Kingsford Smith Airport, or Sydney Airport — is an international airport serving Sydney, New South Wales, Australia, south of the Sydney central business district, in the suburb of Mascot. Sydney Airport is the busiest airport in Oceania. It is the primary airport serving Sydney and is a primary hub for Qantas, as well as a secondary hub for Virgin Australia and Jetstar.

Situated next to Botany Bay on 907 hectares (2,241 acres) of land with three runways, Sydney Airport is one of the world&#x27;s longest continuously operated commercial airports and is the busiest airport in Australia, handling 42.6 million passengers and 348,904 aircraft movements in 2016–17. It was the 48th busiest airport in the world in 2022. Currently, 46 domestic and 43 international destinations are served to Sydney directly. In 2018, the airport was rated in the top five worldwide for airports handling 40–50 million passengers annually and was overall voted the 20th best airport in the world at the Skytrax World Airport Awards.

The airport is owned by Sydney Airport Corporation Limited.

==History==
===1911–1930: Early history===

The land used for the airport had been a bullock paddock, with a lot of the area around Mascot being swampy. Flights had been taking off from at least 1911 from these fields, with aviators using other Sydney locations like Anderson Park and Neutral Bay for a few years prior.

Nigel Love, who had been a pilot in the First World War, was interested in establishing the nation&#x27;s first aircraft manufacturing company. This idea would require him to establish a factory and an aerodrome close to the city. A real estate office in Sydney told him of some land owned by the Kensington Race Club that was being kept as a hedge against its losing its government-owned site at Randwick. It had been used by a local abattoir which was closing down, to graze sheep and cattle. This land appealed to Love as the surface was perfectly flat and was covered with a pasture of buffalo grass. The grass had been grazed so evenly by the sheep and cattle that it required little to make it serviceable for aircraft. In addition, the approaches on all four sides had no obstructions, it was bounded by Ascot Racecourse, gardens, a river, and Botany Bay.

Love established the airfield at Mascot as a private concern, leasing from the Kensington Race Club for three years. It initially had a small canvas structure but was later equipped with an imported Richards hangar. The first flight from Mascot was in November 1919 when Love carried freelance movie photographer Billy Marshall up in an Avro. Sydney Airport was declared an aerodrome and officially opened in January 1920. The official opening flight took place on 9 January 1920, also performed by Love.

In 1921, the Commonwealth Government purchased in Mascot for the purpose of creating a public airfield. In 1923, when Love&#x27;s three-year lease expired, the Mascot land was compulsorily acquired by the Commonwealth Government from the racing club. The first regular flights began in 1924.

===1930–1950===

In 1933, the first gravel runways were built. On 14 August 1936, the airport was renamed Sydney (Kingsford Smith) Airport in honour of pioneering Australian aviator Sir Charles Kingsford Smith. In 1940, the Department of Civil Aviation constructed an administrative and terminal building in the eastern part of the aerodrome, with a control tower cab at the top floor. The building is now part of Terminal 3 since 1999, but the control tower cab has already been removed.

By 1949, the airport had three runways – the 11/29, the 16/34, and the 04/22. The Sydenham to Botany railway line crossed runway 04/22 approximately from the northern end and was protected by special safe working facilities.

In the late 1940s (c. 1947–1949), a temporary overseas passenger (i.e. international) terminal was constructed. The original 1940 terminal then became the terminal building for the Trans Australia Airlines (TAA), the government-owned domestic airline, and the building also became known as the TAA terminal building. The temporary overseas passenger terminal was later replaced by a newer one in 1954, located just north of the 1940 terminal building.

===1950–1990: Modernisation and upgrades===
During the year 1950, the airport handled at least 793,956 passengers and was ranked among the busiest airports in the world.

Between 1947 and 1953, the Cooks River was diverted away around the western side of the airport and other small streams were filled. This allowed the construction of two new paved runways to replace the three gravel runways. The first paved runway to be constructed was 07/25, completed in 1953–1954. Subsequently, the next paved runway to be constructed was 16/34 (now 16R/34L) which replaced the parallel gravel runway 16/34. Both runways were constructed south of the gravel runways. At the same time, on 2 November 1953, a new air traffic control tower with an integrated fire station was constructed northeast of where the two runways intersect, replacing the control tower on the 1940 terminal building. The tower was demolished in 2005.

The new runway 16/34 was later extended southwards into Botany Bay over General Holmes Drive in 1968 to accommodate long-haul international jets, and then extended again to its current length in 1972. Since then, the east–west 07/25 runway was long; and the north–south 16/34 runway was one of the longest runways in the southern hemisphere.
Up to the early 1960s, the majority of Sydneysiders referred to the airport as Mascot. Jet aircraft started to arrive in July 1959, with the introduction of Qantas&#x27; Boeing 707-138. By the 1960s, the need for a new international terminal had become apparent. In the late 1940s and early 1950s, a terminal block for both international and domestic flights was proposed to be at the southeast portion of the airport near General Holmes Drive, but the proposal never eventuated. Work commenced on the construction of the new terminal in late 1966. Much of the new terminal was designed by Paynter and Dixon Industries with Costain appointed lead contractor. The new terminal was officially opened on 3 May 1970, by Queen Elizabeth II. The first Boeing 747 &quot;Jumbo Jet&quot; at the airport, Pan Am&#x27;s &quot;Clipper Flying Cloud&quot; (N734PA), arrived on 4 October 1970.Meanwhile, the 1940 TAA domestic terminal was expanded and modernised in 1962, with departures separated from arrivals along with other upgrades. The terminal was replaced by a new TAA terminal in 1974, constructed on the site of the old international terminal building after the new international terminal opened four years prior. The new terminal was located directly north and adjacent to the original TAA terminal. The 1940 terminal was then taken over by East-West Airlines.

Upgrades and expansion of the Ansett terminal (now Terminal 2) also began in 1974.

===1990–2010===
Since the international terminal&#x27;s original completion, it has undergone a few expansions. The international terminal was first expanded in 1992 with the construction of Pier C in the south.

The limitations of having only two runways that crossed each other had become apparent and governments grappled with Sydney&#x27;s airport capacity for decades. Eventually, the controversial decision to build a third runway was made. The third runway was parallel to the existing runway 16/34, entirely on reclaimed land from Botany Bay. A proposed new airport on the outskirts of Sydney was shelved in 2004, before being re-examined in 2009–2012 following reports that Kingsford Smith airport will not be able to cope by 2030. The &quot;third runway&quot;, which the Commonwealth government commenced development of in 1989 and completed in 1994, remained controversial because of increased aircraft movements, especially over inner suburbs. In 1995 the No Aircraft Noise party was formed to contest the 1995 New South Wales state election. The party did not win a seat in parliament but came close in the electorate of Marrickville. It also contested the 1996 Australian federal election.

In 1995, the Australian Parliament passed the &quot;Sydney Airport Curfew Act 1995&quot;, which limits the operating hours of the airport. This was done in an effort to reduce airport noise over residential areas and thereby curb complaints. The curfew prevents aircraft from taking off or landing between the hours of 11 pm and 6 am. A limited number of scheduled and approved take-offs and landings are permitted respectively in the &quot;shoulder periods&quot; of 11 pm to midnight and 5 am to 6 am. The Act does not stop all aircraft movements overnight but limits noise by restricting the types of aircraft that can operate, the runways they can use and the number of flights allowed. During extreme weather, flights are often delayed and it is often the case that people on late flights are unable to travel on a given day. , fines for violating curfew have been levied against four airlines, with a maximum fine of A$550,000 applicable. In addition to the curfew, Sydney Airport also has a cap of 80 aircraft movements per hour which cannot be exceeded, leading to increased delays during peak hours.

In 1998, the Federal Government agreed to separate Sydney Airport from the Federal Airports Corporation and to incorporate it as Sydney Airport Corporation. David Mortimer was appointed as Chair and Tony Stuart as CEO. Its mandate was to successfully redevelop the airport as the gateway for the Sydney 2000 Olympics, support the growth of new airlines such as Virgin and Emirates, and prepare it for a successful $3 billion-plus privatisation. In 2001 Sydney Airport was awarded World&#x27;s Best Airport. In preparation for privatisation the airport argued successfully for a new regulatory regime.

All three terminals were upgraded prior to the 2000 Summer Olympics which was to be held in Sydney.

In 2002, the Commonwealth Government sold Sydney Airport Corporation (SAC), to Southern Cross Airports Corporation Holdings for $5.4 billion. 83 percent of SAC is owned by MAp Airports International Limited, a subsidiary of Macquarie Group, Sydney Airport Intervest GmbH owns 12 percent and Ontario Teachers&#x27; Australia Trust owns 5 percent. SACL holds a 99-year lease on the airport which remains Crown land and as such is categorised as a Leased Federal Airport.

In 2005, a planned expansion of the airport was announced, including the construction of a multi-level car park, and the expansion of both international and domestic terminals. The expansion was planned to stretch over twenty years (2005–25). These expansions—and other plans and policies by Macquarie Bank for airport operations were seen as controversial, as they were performed without the legal oversight of local councils, which usually act as the local planning authority for such developments. , some of the proposed development has been scaled back.

The international terminal underwent a renovation that was completed in mid-2010. The upgrade includes a new baggage system, an extra of space for shops and passenger waiting areas, expansion of the transit zone, and other improvements.

In March 2010, the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission released a report sharply critical of price gouging at Sydney airport, ranking it fifth out of five airports. The report noted Sydney Airport recorded the highest average prices at $13.63 per passenger, compared to the lowest at $7.96 at Melbourne Airport, while the price of short-term parking had almost doubled in the 2008–09 financial year, from $28 to $50 for four hours. This amounts to the highest profit margins on aeronautical services and very high profit margins on car parking fees. The report also accused the airport of abusing its monopoly power.

===Since 2011: Modern history===

In December 2011, Sydney Airport announced a proposal to divide the airport into two airline-alliance-based precincts; integrating international, domestic, and regional services under one roof by 2019. The current domestic Terminal 2 and Terminal 3 would be used by Qantas, Jetstar, and members of the Oneworld airline alliance while today&#x27;s international Terminal 1 would be used by Virgin Australia and its international partners. Other international airlines would continue to operate from T1. In September 2012, Sydney Airport Managing Director and CEO Kerrie Mather announced the airport had abandoned the proposal to create alliance-based terminals in favour of terminals &quot;based around specific airline requirements and (passenger) transfer flows&quot;. She stated the plan was to minimise the number of passengers transferring between terminals.

In June 2013, the airport released a draft version of its 2033 Master Plan, which proposes operating domestic and international flights from the same terminals using &#x27;swing gates&#x27;, along with upgrading Terminal 3 (currently the Qantas domestic terminal) to accommodate the Airbus A380. On 17 February 2014, the Australian Government approved the Master Plan, which outlines the airport&#x27;s plans to cater to the forecast demand of 74 million passengers in 2033. The plan includes Sydney Airport&#x27;s first-ever integrated ground transport plan.

On 27 August 2018, the Sydney Airport Master Plan 2039 was announced. The Sydney Airport Masterplan 2039 is a strategic plan that outlines the long-term vision for the development of Sydney Airport. The airport expects international travellers passing through its terminals to double over the next two decades and underpin an expected 50 per cent increase in passenger numbers by 2039. The plan aims to minimise traffic congestion on ground transportation.

==Operations==

=== Runways ===
Runway 07/25 is used mainly by lighter aircraft but is used by all aircraft including Airbus A380s when conditions require. Runway 16R/34L is presently the longest operational runway in Australia, with a paved length of and between the zebra thresholds. Runway 16L/34R is mainly used by domestic aircraft and large aircraft up to the size of B767/A330/B787/B772/A359, but is used by larger aircraft such as B77L/B773/B77W/B744/A340/A35K/MD11 when no other runway is available.

=== Control towers ===
The present Sydney Airport control tower (No. 5) is the fifth air traffic control tower at the airport. It is also heritage-listed since 2016. The tower occupies a central position in the airport, located northeast to where General Holmes Drive goes under the main Runway 16R/34L. It began construction in 1993 in conjunction with the construction of parallel Runway 16L/34R, and was commissioned on 6 January 1996.

The control tower replaces the fourth control tower (No. 4) built in 1972, located at the mouth of Cooks River and south of General Holmes Drive. , the control tower complex remains standing and is used by Airservices Australia as its Traffic Control Unit to manage planes within a radius from Sydney. However, the Traffic Control Unit was slated to be moved to Melbourne and the control tower complex was slated for demolition.

==Terminals==
Sydney Airport has three passenger terminals. The International Terminal (Terminal 1) is separated from the other two domestic terminals (Terminals 2 &amp; 3) by runway 16R/34L; therefore, connecting passengers need to allow for longer transfer times ranging from 30 minutes to an hour or more.

The existing terminal numbering system (Terminals 1 to 3) was adopted on 24 September 2002.

===Terminal 1===

Terminal 1 is also known as the International Terminal and serves all international flights. It is located in the airport&#x27;s northwestern sector. It was opened on 3 May 1970, replacing the old Overseas Passenger Terminal (which was located where Terminal 3 stands now), and has been greatly expanded since then. The first extension in 1992 opened Pier C to the south with nine new gates, increasing the number of gates from 17 to 26. The original piers that opened in 1970 also became known as Pier B. The second extension was undertaken between 1997 and 2000 before the 2000 Summer Olympics, including ten new aircraft parking positions and new integrated baggage handling system. A third $500 million redevelopment was completed in 2010, by which the shopping complex was expanded, outbound customs operations were centralised and the floor space of the terminal increased to . Further renovations began in 2015 with a reconfiguration and decluttering of outbound and inbound duty-free areas, an extension of the airside dining areas, and the installation of Australian Border Force outbound immigration SmartGates. These works were completed in 2016.

The terminal has 25 gates served by aerobridges, thirteen of which are in Pier B (numbered 8–10, 24–25 and 30–37), and twelve in Pier C (numbered 50–51, 53–61 and 63). Prior to the 2010 upgrade, there also used to be gates 20, 22 and 23 in Pier B. Pier B is used by Qantas, all Oneworld members, and all SkyTeam members (except Delta Air Lines). Pier C is used by Virgin Australia and its partners (including Delta) as well as all Star Alliance members. There are also a number of remote bays which are heavily utilised during peak periods and for parking idle aircraft during the day. , there is currently no Pier A, but Pier A would be the name for a northern expansion if it were to happen in the future.

The terminal building is split into three levels, one each for arrivals, departures, and airline offices. The departure level has 20 rows of check-in desks each with 10 single desks making a total of 200 check-in desks. The terminal hosts eight airline lounges: two for Qantas, and one each for The House, Air New Zealand, Singapore Airlines, Emirates, American Express, and SkyTeam.

===Terminal 2===

Terminal 2, located in the airport&#x27;s northeastern section, is a domestic terminal and the former home of Ansett Australia&#x27;s domestic operations. It features 20 parking bays served by aerobridges and several remote bays for regional aircraft. It serves FlyPelican, Jetstar, Link Airways, Rex Airlines, and Virgin Australia. There are lounges for Rex Airlines and Virgin Australia.

The terminal was first opened in 1939–1940 as the terminal building for Australian National Airways (ANA). It was expanded in July 1952. The ANA terminal was included in the sale of ANA to Ansett in 1957. It was upgraded and modernised in 1974–1975 with a new baggage handling system, moving walkways, air-conditioned departure lounges and aerobridges. It also had a covered bridge from the domestic car park to the terminal.

During the 1990s, the terminal was upgraded and redevelopment two times. The first redevelopment was announced in 1989, and included a new western concourse, new boarding lounges at the existing concourse and new aircraft-parking positions. This was to create additional gates for other airlines, required as part of the new 30-year lease for the terminal that Ansett had signed with the federal government. The second redevelopment completed before the 2000 Summer Olympic Games for .

After Ansett&#x27;s collapse in 2002, Ansett&#x27;s administrators sold the terminal lease to the airport for , and the terminal became open to all airline operators, including Qantas&#x27;s regional carriers (QantasLink) and Virgin Blue (now Virgin Australia). QantasLink moved from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 in 2013.

===Terminal 3===

Terminal 3 is a domestic terminal serving Qantas as well as QantasLink flights, which moved from Terminal 2 to Terminal 3 on 16 August 2013. It was initially home to Trans Australia Airlines (TAA, later named Australian Airlines), with Australian Airlines signing a 30 year lease for the terminal with the federal government in 1989. Since the merger of Australian Airlines and Qantas in 1994, the terminal exclusively serves under the Qantas brand. In 2015, Qantas sold its lease of Terminal 3, which was due to continue until 2019, back to Sydney Airport for $535 million. This means Sydney Airport resumes operational responsibility of the terminal, including the lucrative retail areas. Qantas would retain priority usage for the check-in and baggage facilities and departure gates until mid-2025.

The TAA terminal was built in 1974, occupying the site of the former Overseas Passenger Terminal. The current terminal building is largely the result of extensions designed by Hassell and completed in 1999. This included the construction of a roof span above a new column-free check-in hall and resulted in extending the terminal footprint to . Since the opening of the terminal in 1974, the original airport terminal building built in 1940 was incorporated into the southwest portion of the newer terminal and is currently near gates 17 to 19 of Terminal 3 ().

The terminal is located in the northeastern section adjacent to Terminal 2, with which it shares an underground train station. There are 14 parking bays served by aerobridges, including two served by dual aerobridges. Terminal 3 features a large Qantas Club lounge, along with a dedicated Business Class and Chairman&#x27;s lounge. Terminal 3 also has a &#x27;Heritage Collection&#x27; located adjacent to gate 13, dedicated to Qantas and including many collections from the airline&#x27;s 90-plus years of service. It also has a view of the airport&#x27;s apron and is used commonly by plane-spotters.

===Former Express Terminal===
Sydney Airport previously had a fourth passenger terminal, east of Terminal 2. This was known as &quot;Domestic Express&quot; or simply &quot;Express Terminal&quot;. Construction of the terminal and adjacent aircraft parking aprons was completed in &quot;a record 56 days&quot;, and operations began on 5 June 2000 with an official opening on 18 July that year. It was used by Hazelton Airlines (later Rex Airlines) and low-cost carriers Virgin Blue and the now-defunct Impulse Airlines (until May 2001). Following Ansett&#x27;s collapse and the airport&#x27;s purchase of the Ansett terminal in 2002, the airlines at the Express Terminal began moving to the former Ansett terminal (Terminal 2). Virgin Blue was last to use the Express Terminal and moved to Terminal 2 on 12 December 2002. The former express terminal is now used as an office building.

===Freight terminals===
The airport is a major hub for freight transport to and from Australia, handling approximately 45 percent of the national cargo traffic. Therefore, it is equipped with extensive freight facilities including seven dedicated cargo terminals operated by several handlers.
==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

Qantas also operates dedicated &quot;flightseeing&quot; services over Antarctica from Sydney. These flights, using a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, depart Sydney from Terminal 3, and provide a guided aerial tour of Antarctica before returning to Australia. These flights are about thirteen hours in total.

===Cargo===
==Traffic statistics==
=== Total ===


===Domestic===
Sydney Airport handled over 24.1 million domestic passengers in the year ending 31 December 2023, a significant increase from 2021 levels, largely due to the aviation downturn from COVID-19.
=== International ===

Sydney Airport handled 14.6 million international passengers in the year ending 31 December 2023.
=== Freight ===

In 2019, Sydney Airport handled 521,014 tonnes of international air freight and 23,260 tonnes of international air mail.

==Ground transport==
===Road===
Sydney Airport has road connections in all directions. Southern Cross Drive (M1), a motorway, is the fastest toll-free link to the city centre. The M5 South Western Motorway (including the M5 East Freeway) links the airport with the south-western suburbs of Sydney. A ring road runs around the airport consisting of Airport Drive, Qantas Drive, General Holmes Drive, M5 East Freeway and Marsh Street. General Holmes Drive features a tunnel under the main north–south runway and three taxiways as well as providing access to an aircraft viewing area. Inside the airport a part-ring road – Ross Smith Avenue (named after Ross MacPherson Smith) – connects the Domestic Terminal with the control tower, the general aviation area, car-rental company storage yards, long-term car park, heliport, various retail operations and a hotel. A perimeter road runs inside the secured area for authorised vehicles only.

Since 2024, Sydney Gateway, a major road interchange now connects between the WestConnex M8 Motorway and Sydney Airport&#x27;s terminals. The project provides a motorway-grade road directly from the terminals to Sydney&#x27;s CBD, Parramatta and the south-western suburbs. Construction began in 2021 and was completed in mid 2024.

The airport runs several official car parks—Domestic Short Term, Domestic Remote Long Term, and International Short/Long Term.

The International Terminal is located beside a wide pedestrian and bicycle path. It links Mascot and Sydney City in the north-east with Tempe (via a foot bridge over Alexandra Canal) and Botany Bay to the south-west. All terminals offer bicycle racks and are also easily accessible by foot from nearby areas.

===Public transport===
====Rail====

The airport is accessible via Sydney Trains T8 Airport &amp; South Line, providing regular service to the Sydney CBD and the southwestern suburbs, using the Airport Link underground rail line since 2000. The International Airport station is located below the International terminal, while the Domestic Airport station is located under the car park between the domestic terminals (Terminal 2 and Terminal 3). While the stations are part of the Sydney Trains suburban network, they are privately owned and operated by the Airport Link Company and their use is subject to a surcharge. The trains that service the airport are regular suburban trains. Unlike airport trains at some other airports, these do not have special provisions for customers with luggage, do not operate express to the airport, and may have all seats occupied by commuters before the trains arrive at the airport.

The airport station surcharge may be avoided by passengers alighting at nearby stations and walking to either the International Terminal (from Wolli Creek station, about 1.6 km) or the Domestic Terminal (from Mascot station, about 1.8 km).

====Bus====
Transdev John Holland operates route 350 from the domestic terminal to Bondi Junction railway station while Transit Systems operates route 420 from Mascot railway station to Westfield Burwood via both International and Domestic terminals, as well as Banksia and Rockdale railway stations.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 10 September 1920, Arthur Herbert Tattle of Wellington, New Zealand, was killed on the runway at Mascot when he was struck on the crown of his head by a plane taking off. He had come to see two friends take off on the plane and was standing on the runway in the flight path with a camera looking down at the viewfinder when he failed to notice the speed of the fast approaching plane, its height or the shouted warning from the pilot. He was driven to South Sydney Hospital where he died soon after from &quot;a concussion of the brain&quot;. An inquiry into the incident returned a finding of &quot;accidental death&quot; and was reported to be the first inquest in New South Wales resulting from an aeroplane accident.
* On 19 July 1945 a Consolidated C-87 Liberator Express operated by the Royal Air Force (RAF) bound for Manus Island failed to gain altitude after taking off from Sydney&#x27;s now non-existent runway 22, struck trees and crashed into Muddy Creek, north of Brighton-Le-Sands. The aircraft exploded on impact, killing all 12 passengers and crew on board. All the victims were service personnel, five from the RAF, one from the Royal New Zealand Air Force and six from the Royal Navy.
* On 18 June 1950, a Douglas DC-3 of Ansett Airways taxiing for take-off from runway 22 for a night-time passenger flight to Brisbane, hit and partially derailed a coal train travelling on the railway line that crossed the runway. Only the co-pilot was injured.
* On 30 November 1961, Ansett-ANA Flight 325, a Vickers Viscount, crashed into Botany Bay shortly after take-off. The starboard (right) wing failed after the aircraft flew into a thunderstorm. All 15 people on board were killed.
* On 1 December 1969, a Boeing 707-320B of Pan Am registered N892PA and operating as Flight 812 overran the runway during take-off due to bird strikes. The accident investigation established that the aircraft struck a flock of seagulls, with a minimum of 11 individual bird strikes to the leading edges of the wings and engines 1, 2, and 3 (the two engines on the left wing and the inboard engine on the right wing). In particular, blade 14 of number 2 engine (the inboard engine on the left wing) was damaged by a single bird carcass and lost power before the decision to abandon the take-off (which occurred at or near V1 or takeoff decision speed). The aircraft came to rest beyond the end of runway 16 (now runway 16R). During the crash, number 2 engine hit the ground and was damaged. The nose and left main landing gears failed and the aircraft came to rest supported by engines 1 and 2, the nose, and the remainder of the main landing gear. There were no injuries or fatalities amongst the 125 passengers and 11 crew. The accident investigation concluded that the overrun was not inevitable. The aircraft was destroyed in a 2011 accident.
* On 22 February 1970, a teenage boy from Randwick climbed into the wheel well of a Douglas DC-8 of Japan Air Lines operating as Flight 772. As the plane was taking off bound for Tokyo, he fell to his death with a photographer accidentally capturing the incident.
* On 29 January 1971, a Boeing 727 of Trans Australia Airlines (registered VH-TJA) and taking off as Flight 592, struck the tail of a taxiing Douglas DC-8 of Canadian Pacific Air Lines (registered CF-CPQ) that had just landed as Flight 301. The DC-8 crew misinterpreted instructions on which exit to use after landing and backtracked along the runway instead of turning off it onto a taxiway; and the tower controller cleared the 727 for take-off in the mistaken belief that the runway was clear. The 727 crew saw the DC-8 during the take-off roll then proceeded with the take-off rather than take evasive measures. The 727 was damaged in the inboard right wing and the fuselage and lost pressure in one of its hydraulic systems but managed to return and land safely; a building on the ground was struck by parts of the 727&#x27;s starboard landing gear doors that fell off as it approached to land. The upper eight-and-a-half feet (about 2.6m) of the DC-8&#x27;s tail fin and a corresponding proportion of the rudder were torn off.
* On 4 April 1979, a hijacker attempted to take over a Boeing 747SP of Pan Am registered as N530PA and operating as Flight 816 parked at the airport. He managed to get past the immigration and security screening. He then grabbed a female hostage and made some demands. Police were able to fatally shoot him; he later died of his injuries.
* On 21 February 1980, a Beechcraft Super King Air registered VH-AAV and operating Advance Airlines Flight 4210 took off from Sydney Airport and suffered an engine failure. The pilot flew the aircraft back to the airport and attempted to land but crashed into the sea wall surrounding runway 16/34 (now 16R/34L). All 13 people on board died in the accident.
* On 12 April 1989, a British Airways Concorde operating a charter from Christchurch to Sydney experienced vibrations near the top of climb while flying supersonic. The crew continued to Sydney believing they had experienced an engine surge. On landing, it was discovered that parts of the rudder had disintegrated in flight. The UK Air Accidents Investigation Branch investigated the incident and found it was a result of poor maintenance practices weakening the structure.
* On 24 April 1994, a Douglas DC-3 registered VH-EDC of South Pacific Airmotive had an engine malfunction shortly after take-off on a charter flight to Norfolk Island. The engine was feathered but airspeed decayed and it was found to be impossible to maintain height. A successful ditching was carried out into Botany Bay. All four crew and 21 passengers - pupils and teachers of Scots College and journalists, travelling to participate in Anzac Day commemorations on Norfolk Island - safely evacuated the aircraft. The investigation revealed that the aircraft was overloaded and the propeller was not fully feathered.
* On 19 October 1994, Ansett Australia Flight 881, a Boeing 747-300 registered VH-INH operating from Sydney to Osaka, returned and landed at Sydney without the nose wheel extended. Approximately one hour after departure the crew shut down the number one engine because of an oil leak. They returned the aircraft to Sydney where the approach proceeded normally until the landing gear was extended. The landing gear warning horn began to sound because the nose landing gear had not extended. The flight crew unsuccessfully attempted to establish the reason for the warning. Believing the gear to be down, the crew elected to complete the landing, with the result that the aircraft was landed with the nose gear retracted. There was no fire and the pilot in command decided not to initiate an emergency evacuation. All passengers and crew were evacuated safely.
*On 14 August 2023, a Malaysia Airlines Airbus A330-300 operating Flight MH122 from Sydney to Kuala Lumpur was forced to return to Sydney. An extremist onboard the plane was shouting at crew and passengers and also made threats. After landing the plane parked on one of the runways of Sydney airport, thereby blocking traffic. Police later boarded the plane and arrested the man.
*On 19 October 2024, an Air New Zealand Airbus A320neo operating Flight NZ247 from Wellington to Sydney reported a bomb threat onboard from finding a note onboard. After landing the aircraft was isolated at the end of Runway 16L, and normal traffic moved over to the east-west runway, Runway 07/25. 
*On 8 November 2024, Qantas Airways Flight 520 enroute to Brisbane suffered a compressor stall or uncontained engine failure in the Number 2 Engine, following the rotation of the aircraft leaking fuel plus the heat of the day ignited a grass fire east of the threshold of Runway 16L, Inbound flights were diverted to Newcastle Airport, Brisbane Airport, Canberra Airport and Melbourne-Tullamarine Airport. The flight departed Sydney Airport at about 12:15pm, but returned and landed safely at about 1pm. The captain is said to have told passengers there was a problem with the right engine.

==Second Sydney airport==
The local, state and federal governments have investigated the viability of building a second major airport in Sydney since the 1940s. Significant passenger growth at Sydney Airport indicates the potential need for a second airport – for example, total passenger numbers increased from less than 10 million in 1985–86 to over 25 million in 2000–01 and over 40 million in 2015–16. This growth is expected to continue, with Sydney region passenger demand forecast to reach 87 million passengers by 2035.

On 15 April 2014, the Federal Government announced that Badgerys Creek would be Sydney&#x27;s second international airport, to be known as Western Sydney Airport. Press releases suggest that the airport will not be subject to curfews and will open in phases, initially with a single airport runway and terminal. It would be linked to Sydney Airport by local roads and motorways, and by extensions to the existing suburban rail network. In May 2017 the Federal Government announced it would build (pay for) the second Sydney Airport after the Sydney Airport Group declined the Government&#x27;s offer to build the second airport.

The new airport started construction in 2018 and will be completed in late 2026.

<text>Melbourne Airport , known locally as Tullamarine Airport, is the main international airport serving the city of Melbourne, the capital of the Australian state of Victoria. It has Australia&#x27;s second largest passenger traffic. The airport operates 24 hours a day and has on-site parking, shopping and dining. The airport opened in 1970 and replaced Essendon Airport. Melbourne Airport is the main and sole international airport serving Victoria.

The airport comprises four terminals: one international terminal, two domestic terminals and one budget domestic terminal. It is northwest of the city centre, adjacent to the suburb of Tullamarine. The airport has its own suburb with its own postcode — Melbourne Airport, Victoria, 3045 respectively. The facility presently covers 2,741 hectares (6,773 acres) of airport property, making MEL among the largest airports in Australia in terms of land area.

In 2016–17 around 25 million domestic passengers and 10 million international passengers used the airport. The airport features direct flights to 33 domestic destinations and to destinations in the Pacific, Europe, Asia, North America and South America. Melbourne Airport is the number one arrival/departure point for the airports of four of Australia&#x27;s seven other capital cities. Melbourne serves as a major hub for Qantas and Virgin Australia, while Jetstar utilises the airport as home base. Domestically, Melbourne serves as headquarters for Team Global Express and handles more domestic freight than any other airport in the nation.

==History==

===Establishment===
Before the opening of Melbourne Airport, Melbourne&#x27;s main airport was Essendon Airport, which was officially designated an international airport in 1950. In the mid-1950s, over 10,000 passengers were using Essendon Airport, and its limitations were beginning to become apparent. Essendon&#x27;s facilities were insufficient to meet the increasing demand for air travel; the runways were too short to handle large jets, and the terminals failed to handle the increase in passengers. By the mid-1950s, an international overflow terminal was built in a new northern hangar. The airport could not be expanded, as it had become surrounded by residential districts.

The search for a replacement for Essendon commenced in February 1958, when a panel was appointed to assess Melbourne&#x27;s civil aviation needs. Alternative sites considered were Tullamarine ( from Melbourne), Whittlesea (), Hastings (), Port Melbourne (), Werribee (), Laverton (), Avalon () and Moorabbin (). Considerations such as superior proximity to Melbourne and lower development costs narrowed the choice to either Tullamarine or Laverton, with Laverton eventually eliminated in part due to issues coordinating both military and civil activities that could not guarantee the degree of safety demanded, and that traffic coordination would be easier with the shorter distance between Essendon and Tullamarine.

In 1959, the Commonwealth Government acquired of grassland in then-rural Tullamarine.

In May 1959 it was announced that a new airport would be built at Tullamarine, with Prime Minister Robert Menzies announcing on 27 November 1962 a five-year plan to provide Melbourne with a A$45 million &quot;jetport&quot; by 1967. The first sod at Tullamarine was turned two years later in November 1964. In line with the five-year plan, the runways at Essendon were expanded to handle larger aircraft, with Ansett Australia launching the Boeing 727 there in October 1964, the first jet aircraft used for domestic air travel in Australia.

On 1 July 1970, Prime Minister John Gorton opened Melbourne Airport to international operations ending Essendon&#x27;s near two decade run as Melbourne&#x27;s international airport. Essendon still was home to domestic flights for one year, until they transferred to Melbourne Airport on 26 June 1971, with the first arrival of a Boeing 747 occurring later that year. In the first year of operations, Melbourne handled six international airlines and 155,275 international passengers.

Melbourne Airport was originally called &quot;Melbourne International Airport&quot;. It is at Tullamarine, a name derived from the indigenous name Tullamareena. Locally, the airport is commonly referred to as &quot;Tullamarine&quot; or simply as &quot;Tulla&quot; to distinguish the airport from the other three Melbourne airports: Avalon, Essendon and Moorabbin.

On opening, Melbourne Airport consisted of three connected terminals: International in the centre, with Ansett to the South and Trans Australia Airlines to the North. The design capacity of the airport was eight Boeing 707s at a rate of 500 passengers per hour, with minor expansion works completed in 1973 allowing Boeing 747s to serve the airport. By the late 1980s peak passenger flows at the airport had reached 900 per hour, causing major congestion.

In late 1989, Federal Airports Corporation Inspector A. Rohead was put in charge of a bicentennial project to rename streets in Melbourne Airport to honour the original inhabitants, European pioneers and aviation history. Information on the first two categories was provided by Ian Hunter, Wurundjeri researcher, and Ray Gibb, local historian. The project was completed but was shelved, with the only suggested name, Gowrie Park Drive, being allocated, named after the farm at the heart of the airport. During the 1920s, the farm had been used as a landing site for aircraft, which were parked at night during World War II in case Essendon Aerodrome was bombed.

===Expansion and privatisation===

In 1988, the Australian Government formed the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), placing Melbourne Airport under the operational control of the new corporation along with 21 other airports around the nation.

The FAC undertook a number of upgrades at the airport. The first major upgrades were carried out at the domestic terminals, with an expansion of the Ansett domestic terminal approved in 1989 and completed in 1991, adding a second pier for use by smaller regional airlines. Work on an upgrade of the international terminal commenced in 1991, with the &quot;SkyPlaza&quot; retail complex completed in late 1993 on a site flanking the main international departure gates. The rest of the work was completed in 1995, when the new three-level satellite concourse was opened at the end of the existing concourse. Diamond shaped and measuring on each side, the additional 10 aerobridges provided by the expansion doubled the international passenger handing capacity at Melbourne Airport.

In April 1994, the Australian Government announced that all airports operated by FAC would be privatized in several phases. Melbourne Airport was included in the first phase, being acquired by the newly formed Australia Pacific Airports Corporation for $1.3 billion. The transfer was completed on 30 June 1997 on a 50-year long-term lease, with the option for a further 49 years. Melbourne Airport is categorized as a Leased Commonwealth Airport.

Since privatization, further improvements to infrastructure have begun at the airport, including expansion of runways, car parks and terminals. The multi-storey carpark outside the terminal was completed between 1995 and August 1997 at a cost of $49 million, providing 3,100 parking spaces, the majority undercover. This initially four-level structure replaced the previous open air carpark outside the terminal. Work commenced on the six-story 276-room Hilton Hotel (now Parkroyal) above the carpark in January 1999, which was completed in mid-2000 at a cost of $55 million. Expansion of the Qantas domestic terminal was completed in 1999, featuring a second pier and 9 additional aircraft stands.

In December 2000, a fourth passenger terminal opened: the Domestic Express Terminal, located to the south of the main terminal building at a cost of $9 million. It was the first passenger terminal facility to be built at Melbourne Airport since 1971.

Expansion of carparks has also continued with a $40 million project commenced in 2004, doubling the size of the short term carpark with the addition of 2,500 spaces over six levels, along with 1,200 new spaces added to the 5,000 already available in the long term carpark. Revenue from retail operations at Melbourne Airport broke the $100 million mark for the first time in 2004, this being a 100 per cent increase in revenue since the first year of privatization.

In 2005, the airport undertook construction works to prepare the airport for the arrival of the double-decker Airbus A380. The main work was the widening of the main north–south runway by , which was completed over a 29-day period in May 2005. The improvements also included the construction of dual airbridges (Gates 9 and 11) with the ability to board both decks simultaneously to reduce turnaround times, the extension of the international terminal building by to include new penthouse airline lounges, and the construction of an additional baggage carousel in the arrivals hall. As a result, the airport was the first in Australia to be capable of handling the A380. The A380 made its first test flight into the airport on 14 November 2005. On 15 May 2008, the A380 made its first passenger flight into the airport when a Singapore Airlines Sydney-bound flight was diverted from Sydney Airport because of fog. Beginning services in October 2008, Qantas was the first airline to operate the A380 from the airport, flying nonstop to Los Angeles International Airport twice a week. This was the inaugural route for the Qantas A380.

In March 2006, the airport undertook a expansion of Terminal 2, and the construction of an additional level of airline lounges above the terminal. In 2008 a further expansion of Terminal 2 commenced, costing $330 million with completion in 2011. The works added five aerobridges on a new passenger concourse, and a new outbound passenger security and customs processing zone.

In 2017, Melbourne Airport international passenger movements exceeded 10 million annual travellers. In the Financial Year of 2022/2023, international passenger movements exceeded 8 million travellers, up 330% post-COVID.

==Terminals==

Melbourne Airport&#x27;s terminals have 68 gates: 53 domestic and 15 international. There are five dedicated freighter parking positions on the Southern Freighter Apron. The current terminal numbering system was introduced in July 2005; they were previously known as Qantas Domestic, International, and South (formerly Ansett Domestic).

===Terminal 1===


Terminal 1 hosts domestic and regional services for Qantas Group airlines, Qantas and QantasLink (which is located to the northern end of the building). Check-in, security, a food court and the entrance to the Qantas Lounge Precinct are located on the first floor, while baggage claim is located on the ground floor. The terminal has 16 parking bays served by aerobridges; 12 are served by single aerobridges whilst four are served by double aerobridges. There are another five non-aerobridge gates, which are used by QantasLink.

Opened with Melbourne Airport in 1970 for Trans Australia Airlines, the terminal passed to Qantas in 1992 when it acquired the airline. Work on improving the original terminal commenced in October 1997 and was completed in late 1999 at a cost of $50 million, featuring a second pier, stands for 9 additional aircraft, an extended access roadway and the expansion of the terminal.

Today, a wide range of shops and food outlets are situated at the end of the terminal near the entrance into Terminal 2. Qantas has a Qantas Club, Domestic Business Lounge and a Chairman&#x27;s Lounge in the terminal.

===Terminal 2===
Terminal 2 handles all international, and limited domestic flights out of Melbourne Airport, and opened in 1970. The terminal has 20 gates with aerobridges. Cathay Pacific, Qantas (which includes two lounges in Terminal 2, a First lounge, and a Business lounge/Qantas Club), Singapore Airlines, Air New Zealand and Emirates all operate airline lounges in the terminal.

The international terminal contains works by noted Australian Indigenous artists including Daisy Jugadai Napaltjarri and Gloria Petyarre.

A $330 million expansion programme for Terminal 2 was announced in 2007 and completed in 2012. The objectives of this project included new lounges and retail facilities, a new satellite terminal, increased luggage capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas. A new satellite terminal was also constructed as part of the project, featuring floor-to-ceiling windows which offer views of the North-South runway. The new concourse also includes three double-decker aerobridges, each of which can accommodate an A380 or two smaller aircraft and one single aerobridge. The baggage handling capacity was also increased, and two new baggage carousels were built to cater to increased A380 traffic.

Although described as a satellite terminal, the terminal building is connected by an above-ground corridor to Terminal 2. Departures take place on the lower deck (similar to the A380 boarding lounges currently in use at Gates 9 and 11), with arrivals streamed on to the first floor to connect with the current first floor arrivals deck.

===Terminal 3===
Terminal 3 opened with the airport as the Ansett Australia terminal, but is now owned by Melbourne Airport. Terminal 3 is currently home to Virgin Australia. It has eleven parking bays served by single aerobridges and eight parking bays not equipped with aerobridges.

An expansion of the terminal was approved in 1989 and completed in 1991 when a second pier was added by Ansett to the south for use by smaller regional airline Kendell, which Ansett owned. The terminal was used exclusively by the Ansett Group for all its domestic activities until its collapse in 2001. It was intended to be used by the &quot;new Ansett&quot;, under ownership of Tesna; however, following the Tesna group&#x27;s withdrawal of the purchase of Ansett in 2002, the terminal was sold back to Melbourne Airport by Ansett&#x27;s administrators. As a result, Melbourne Airport undertook a major renovation and facelift of the terminal, following which Virgin Australia (then Virgin Blue) moved in from what was then called Domestic Express (now Terminal 4), and has since begun operating The Lounge in the terminal, using the former Ansett Australia Golden Wing Lounge area. Rex also operates an airline lounge in the terminal.

===Terminal 4===
Terminal 4 is dedicated to budget airlines and is the first facility of its kind at a conventional airport in Australia. It was originally constructed for Virgin Blue (Virgin Australia) and Impulse Airlines. Virgin Blue eventually moved into Terminal 3 following the demise of Ansett. A refit began in June 2007 along the lines of the budget terminal model at Singapore Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International Airport. The refit cost AU$5 million. Lower landing and airport handling fees are charged to airlines due to the basic facilities, lack of jet bridges, and fewer amenities and retail outlets compared to a conventional terminal. However, the terminal is located next to the main terminal building, unlike in Singapore and Kuala Lumpur. The terminal was rebuilt by Tiger Airways Australia, which had used it as its main hub since it operated its first domestic flight on 23 November 2007.

Jetstar confirmed its involvement in discussions with Melbourne Airport regarding the expansion of terminal facilities to accommodate for the growth of domestic low-cost services. The expansion of Terminal 4 includes infrastructure to accommodate Tigerair Australia and Jetstar flights. The development cost hundreds of millions of dollars. In March 2012, airport officials would break ground that October and they expected completion in July 2014, however, they pushed that date to late August 2015. The facility opened on 18 August 2015 with Jetstar first utilising the terminal. The new T4 terminal is and linked &quot;under one roof&quot; with T3. Terminal 4 is currently used by Rex Airlines, Jetstar, and Airnorth. Tigerair Australia and Bonza formerly also used Terminal 4 before going into administration.

The terminal has Rex Airlines and Jetstar check-ins, baggage claim and bag drop on ground floor whilst the food court, shops and lounges are located on the first floor, which lead to the departure/arrival zone.

Some Virgin Australia flights currently use the jet bridge equipped section of Terminal 4 for operations(formerly shared with the now-ceased REX Boeing 737 operations), while Jetstar uses the non-jet bridge equipped section of Terminal 4 for operations. Currently Airnorth does not operate any services to Melbourne, however still retains their check-in/baggage check-in desks.

===Southern freighter apron===
The southern freighter apron has five dedicated freighter parking positions which host 21 dedicated freighter operations a week. In August 1997, the fifth freighter parking position and the apron was extended.

===Other facilities===
Melbourne Airport is served by six hotels. A Parkroyal Hotel is located from Terminal 2 atop the multi-level carpark. Work commenced on the six-story 280-room hotel in January 1999 and was completed in mid-2000. The hotel was originally a Hilton but was relaunched as the Parkroyal on 4 April 2011. A Holiday Inn is located from the terminal precinct. Ibis Budget offers budget rooms located from the terminals. Mantra Tullamarine opened in 2009, from the terminal precinct. A combined 4.5-star Novotel and 4-star Ibis Styles hotel located in The Hive precinct opened on 1 July 2024. The Novotel boasts 248 rooms, while the Ibis Styles offers 216 rooms. Both hotels are located a 5-minute walk from Terminals 3 and 4 and a 10-minute walk from Terminals 1 and 2. During late 2023, the Parkroyal underwent a major refurbishment of all guest rooms.

==Operations==

===Overview===
Melbourne is the second busiest airport in Australia. The airport is curfew-free and operates 24 hours a day, although between 2 am and 4 am, freight aircraft are more prevalent than passenger flights. In 2004, the environmental management systems were accredited ISO 14001, the world&#x27;s best practice standard, making it the first airport in Australia to receive such accreditation.

===Runways===
Melbourne Airport has two intersecting runways: one north–south and one east–west. Runway extensions are planned in the long-term, including an extension of the north-south runway to lengthen it to , and a extension of the east–west runway to a total of .

In 2008, Melbourne Airport announced the installation of a Category III landing system, allowing planes to land in low visibility, such as fog. This system, the first of its kind in Australia, was commissioned in March 2010 at a cost of $10 million.

====Third runway====
Due to increasing air traffic and limited capacity, proposals for third runway at Melbourne Airport have been under consideration since the 1990s, appearing in successive long-term master-plan documents. Two new runways have been proposed: a 3,000 m runway parallel to the current north–south runway and another 3,000 m runway south of the existing east–west runway.

In 2013, a new parallel east-west runway was proposed, with a then estimated cost of $500–750 million. If sent for approval, construction was expected to begin around 2018 and finish by 2023. However, following a consultation period in 2019, Melbourne Airport dropped these plans in favor of constructing a new parallel north-south runway to the west, citing concerns about aircraft noise in suburbs under the flight path including Gladstone Park, Westmeadows, Attwood, and Jacana, as well as wind direction considerations.

In September 2024, the Federal Government officially approved the construction of the third runway. The project will be wholly funded by the airport, costing $3 billion, and involve construction of a second parallel north-south runway. New taxiways will also be built and the existing east-west runway length will be retained. Construction will commence in 2025 with completion expected by 2031. The new runway is intended to increase capacity and support future growth as Melbourne&#x27;s population continues to grow. However, the project has faced opposition from nearby residents, local councils and community groups, including the City of Brimbank, over concerns about noise in affected suburbs of Bulla, Keilor, Kealba, St Albans and Sunshine North as well as environmental impacts.

===Control towers===
The first control tower opened in 1969 with the construction of the airport, is tall. Construction of a taller second control tower began in 2010. It is located just west of the original control tower and is tall. It became operational in 2013 and was officially opened on 14 March 2014. The original tower, while no longer in use, was not demolished. Both control towers are located south of the east-west runway and west of the original north-south runway.

===Melbourne Airspace Control Centre===
In addition to the onsite control tower, the airport is home to Melbourne Centre, an air traffic control facility that is responsible for the separation of aircraft in Australia&#x27;s busiest flight information region (FIR), Melbourne FIR. Melbourne FIR monitors airspace over Victoria, Tasmania, southern New South Wales, most of South Australia, the southern half of Western Australia and airspace over the Indian and Southern Ocean. In total, the centre controls 6% of the world&#x27;s airspace. The airport is also the home of the Canberra, Adelaide and Melbourne approach facilities, which provide control services to aircraft arriving and departing at those airports.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===

Qantas also operates dedicated &quot;flightseeing&quot; services over Antarctica from Melbourne. These flights, using a Boeing 787 Dreamliner, depart Melbourne from Terminal 1, and provide a guided aerial tour of Antarctica before returning to Australia. These flights are about thirteen hours in total.

===Cargo===
==Traffic and statistics==
In 2016–17 Melbourne Airport recorded around 25 million domestic passenger movements and around 10 million international passenger movements. In that year there were 239,466 aircraft movements in total. Melbourne Airport was tipped to record 47 million passengers in the year to June 30, 2020, before the pandemic hit, but instead recorded 27.2 million as state and international borders were closed. Melbourne is the second busiest airport in Australia for passenger movements, behind Sydney and ahead of Brisbane.

==Ground transport==

===Road===

Melbourne Airport is from the city centre and is accessible via the Tullamarine Freeway. One freeway offramp runs directly into the airport grounds, and a second to the south serves freight transport, taxis, buses and airport staff. In June 2015, the Airport Drive extension was completed, creating a second major link to the airport. The link starts at the M80 Ring Road and provides direct access to Melrose Drive 1.5 kilometres from the terminal area. As of late 2018 the Tullamarine Freeway was widened. In mid-2023, a new exit was constructed specifically for Terminal 4, omitting the other exits in favour of an elevated off-ramp.

Melbourne Airport has five car parks, all of which operate 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. The short-term, multi-level long-term, business and express carparks are covered, while the long-term parking is not. The main multi-level carpark in front of the terminal was built in the late 1990s, replacing the pre-existing ground-level car parking, progressively expanded ever since.

Melbourne Airport recorded more than 2.2 million taxi movements in the year to 30 June 2017.

===Public transport===
====Bus and shuttle services====
The SkyBus operates express bus services from the airport to Southern Cross railway station (on the western boundary of the Melbourne central business district) and St Kilda. Shuttle services also operate between the airport and the Mornington Peninsula, making stops in St Kilda, Elsternwick, Brighton and Frankston. SkyBus current transports around 3.4 million passengers between the airport and Melbourne&#x27;s CBD.

Metropolitan and regional public buses also operate to or via the airport. Routes 478, 479 &amp; 482 operate to Airport West, via the route 59 tram terminus. Route 479 also operates to Sunbury railway station, connecting with Sunbury and Bendigo line trains. Route 901 was introduced in September 2010 as a frequent bus service. Route 901 connects to trains at Broadmeadows (Craigieburn, Seymour, Shepparton and Albury lines), Epping (Mernda line), Greensborough (Hurstbridge line) and Blackburn (Belgrave and Lilydale lines). V/Line operates timetabled regional coach services to Barham and Deniliquin which stop at the airport.

There are nine other bus companies serving the airport, with services to Ballarat, Bendigo, Dandenong, Frankston, Mornington Peninsula, Geelong, Melbourne&#x27;s suburbs, Shepparton and the Riverina, which provide alternatives to transfer onto other V/Line services.

====Future rail connection====

As of 2025, Melbourne Airport does not have a passenger rail connection to and from the city. Constructing a rail link has been discussed in Victorian politics before and since Melbourne Airport opened in 1970.

In 2022, the Andrews state government commenced early construction on Melbourne Airport Rail (SRL Airport), which was first expected to be complete by 2029. However in 2023-24, due to a lack of agreement in negotiations between the state government and the airport operator over the design of the Airport station, major construction has been delayed, with completion now expected by 2033. The 27 km link will run via Sunshine station in Melbourne&#x27;s west into the central city via the under-construction Metro Tunnel. The link will connect to western regional rail services at Sunshine and to other services on the Metropolitan rail network at Sunshine, Footscray, and State Library and Town Hall in the CBD. The link will be the first direct rail connection to the Airport.

The business case was released in 2022 and was revealed that the Airport station would be elevated at a height of around 6 storeys, minimising construction costs and time. The airport operator, Australia Pacific Airports Corporation (APAC), has initially objected to the elevated station, arguing for it to be built underground in order to safeguard future terminal expansion and improve connectivity to the proposed Suburban Rail Loop. In July 2024, Melbourne Airport agreed to the state government’s preference for an elevated airport station, allowing detailed planning works to resume.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On 29 May 2003, Qantas Flight 1737 from Melbourne to Launceston Airport was subjected to an attempted hijacking shortly after takeoff. The hijacker, a passenger named David Robinson, intended to fly the aircraft into the Walls of Jerusalem National Park, located in central Tasmania. The flight attendants and passengers successfully subdued and restrained the hijacker, and the aircraft returned to Melbourne.
* On 20 March 2009, Emirates Flight 407, an Airbus A340-500, was taking off from Melbourne Airport on Runway 16 for a flight to Dubai International Airport and failed to become airborne in the normal distance. When the aircraft was nearing the end of the runway, the crew commanded nose-up sharply, causing its tail to scrape along the runway as it became airborne, during which smoke was observed in the cabin. The crew dumped fuel over Port Phillip Bay and successfully returned to Melbourne. The damage caused to the airport was considered substantial, with a damaged strobe light at the end of the runway as well as an antenna on the localiser, which led to the ILS being out of service for some time causing some disruptions to the airport&#x27;s operation.
* On 11 October 2022, a security breach occurred at the airport, with a Qantas spokesperson saying that &quot;A passenger appears to have inadvertently passed from an unscreened area to a screened area of the airport in Melbourne&quot;. Australian Federal Police shut down a section of the airport, and ordered all passengers in the terminal be rescreened, including those already on planes waiting to take off.
*In December 2023, it was confirmed that two planes had near misses at Melbourne Airport back in September the same year. There was construction work on one of the runways, leading to closure of a section of runway. In one case, a Malaysia Airlines plane took off about two hundred metres before construction workers and equipment. In the other case, a Bamboo Airlines plane took off narrowly missing (by 3 metres) construction workers and equipment.

==Awards and accolades==
Melbourne Airport has received numerous awards. The International Air Transport Association ranked Melbourne among the top five airports in the world in 1997 and 1998. In 2003, Melbourne received the IATA&#x27;s Eagle Award for service and two National Tourism Awards for tourism services.

The airport has received recognition in other areas. It has won national and state tourism awards, and Singapore Airlines presented the airport with the Service Partner Award and Premier Business Partner Award in 2002 and 2004, respectively. In 2006, the airport won the Australian Construction Achievement Award for the runway widening project, dubbed &quot;the most outstanding example of construction excellence for 2006&quot;. In 2012, Parkroyal Melbourne Airport was awarded for the best airport hotel in Australia/the Pacific by Skytrax. According to Skytrax World&#x27;s Top 100 Airports List, Melbourne Airport improved from being ranked 43rd in 2012 to 27th in 2018.

<text>The gnatcatchers are a family of small passerine birds called &quot;Polioptilidae&quot;. The 22 species occur in North and South America (except for the far south and the high Andean regions). Most species of this mainly tropical and subtropical group are resident, but the blue-grey gnatcatcher of the United States and southern Canada migrates south in winter. They are close relatives of the wrens.

==Description==
These dainty birds are intermediate between Old World warblers and wrens in their structure and habits, moving restlessly through foliage seeking insects. The gnatcatchers are mainly soft bluish grey in color, and have the typical insectivore&#x27;s long sharp bill. Many species have distinctive black head patterns (especially males) and long, regularly cocked, black-and-white tails. The skulking gnatwrens are browner, more thickset, and with proportionally shorter tails and longer bills.

==Distribution and habitat==
They are distributed from North to South America, with the exception of the far south and high Andean regions. Gnatwrens typically occur in the undergrowth of dense, often humid, forest, while gnatcatchers, depending on the species involved, occur in anything from dry scrubby habitats (e.g. the California gnatcatcher) to the canopy of humid Amazonian forest (e.g. the Guianan gnatcatcher). The North American species nest in bushes or trees, but the breeding behavior of several of the Neotropical species is essentially unknown.

==Taxonomy and systematics==

A species new to science, the critically endangered Iquitos gnatcatcher &quot;Polioptila clementsi&quot;, was first described in 2005. This species is a member of the Guianan gnatcatcher &quot;Polioptila guianensis&quot; complex, which recently has been proposed split into three species (four with the Iquitos gnatcatcher), but not all authorities have accepted this (e.g. SACC). Furthermore, other groups should possibly be split, notably the tropical gnatcatcher &quot;Polioptila plumbea&quot; and masked gnatcatcher &quot;Polioptila dumicola&quot; complexes, but at present scientific papers on these matters are lacking.

The family contains 22 species divided into 3 genera:
*&quot;Ramphocaenus&quot; (2 species) – gnatwrens
*&quot;Microbates&quot; (2 species) – gnatwrens
*&quot;Polioptila&quot; (18 species) – gnatcatchers

== California Gnatcatcher ==
The California gnatcatcher (&quot;Polioptila californica&quot;) is a small, non-migratory songbird that inhabits the coastal regions of southern California. It belongs to the family &quot;Polioptilidae&quot; and is best known for its distinctive behavior and appearance. This species is characterized by a small, slender body, typically around 10 cm in length, with a long tail, dark gray or bluish-gray plumage, and a faint black line running through its eye. The California gnatcatcher is an important species in the coastal sage scrub ecosystem, which it relies on for both food and shelter.

== Natural habitat ==
The natural habitat of the California gnatcatcher is primarily the coastal sage scrub ecosystem. This type of habitat is found in areas with a Mediterranean climate—mild, wet winters and hot, dry summers. The gnatcatcher favors areas with low shrubs and a mix of grasses and wildflowers, where it can easily find insects. It also lives in chaparral and mixed woodlands but is most commonly found below 1,000 meters in elevation. The coastal sage scrub once stretched across much of southern California, from Santa Barbara to San Diego, but has been drastically reduced by urban sprawl and agricultural development.

== Food ==
The California gnatcatcher feeds primarily on insects, such as small flies, beetles, ants, and other invertebrates. It uses its sharp beak to catch these insects in the dense vegetation of its habitat. The gnatcatcher is particularly skilled at foraging in the low shrubbery and in the underbrush, where its small size allows it to maneuver with agility. The species is an insectivore, and its diet is essential for providing the energy it needs for survival and reproduction. It also consumes some seeds and berries, but insects make up the bulk of its diet.

== Population ==
Over the years, the population of the California gnatcatcher has fluctuated dramatically. In the early 1990s, the population was estimated to be only 1,000 to 3,000 pairs due to habitat destruction, primarily from urban expansion. As southern California grew, vast areas of coastal sage scrub were converted into housing developments, agriculture, and infrastructure, which resulted in the loss of the gnatcatcher&#x27;s habitat. The species was listed as threatened under the U.S. Endangered Species Act in 1993, prompting conservation efforts to protect its remaining habitats. Today, the population is estimated to be around 20,000 to 40,000 individuals. thanks to restoration and preservation projects.

== Status ==
The California gnatcatcher is classified as a threatened species, primarily due to habitat loss and fragmentation. Urbanization, agriculture, and climate change have significantly reduced the available coastal sage scrub habitat. Habitat fragmentation isolates populations, making it difficult for gnatcatchers to find mates and reproduce, which also reduces genetic diversity. While some recovery has been made, the species is still vulnerable, and its long-term survival depends on continued conservation efforts. Protected areas and habitat restoration have been critical in stabilizing the population in recent years.

Behaviorally, California gnatcatchers are highly territorial, especially during the breeding season. They use a combination of vocalizations and physical displays to defend their territories from other birds. These birds are also known for their distinctive foraging behavior. They often move quickly through shrubs, flicking their tails and catching insects in mid-air or from leaves. The gnatcatcher is an agile and persistent forager, spending much of its day hunting for food to sustain itself. The species is also known for being relatively solitary outside of the breeding season, with pairs coming together only for nesting.

== Predators ==
As small birds, California gnatcatchers face several natural predators. They are vulnerable to a variety of avian predators, including hawks, kestrels, and ravens, which may prey upon them or their eggs. Additionally, snakes and raccoons are known to threaten their nests. These predators often target the eggs or fledglings, making early life particularly dangerous for the gnatcatcher. In order to avoid predators, gnatcatchers rely on their excellent camouflage and the dense vegetation of the coastal sage scrub to hide from potential threats.

California gnatcatchers are also particularly vulnerable to wildfires, which have become more frequent and intense due to climate change. Wildfires can destroy vast swaths of their habitat, leaving them without food and shelter. These fires can decimate entire populations and disrupt their breeding cycles. To ensure their survival, California gnatcatchers depend on the preservation of their habitat and the continuation of conservation efforts that focus on restoring degraded areas and protecting the species&#x27; remaining habitat from further destruction.

<text>Elul (Hebrew: , , ) is the twelfth month of the civil year and the sixth month of the religious year in the Hebrew calendar. It is a month of 29 days. Elul usually occurs in August–September on the Gregorian calendar.

==Etymology==
The name of the month Elul, like the names of the rest of the Hebrew calendar months, was brought from the Babylonian captivity, and originated from the Akkadian word for &quot;harvest&quot;. A similar month name was also used in Akkadian, in the form &quot;Elūlu&quot;. The month is known as &quot;Araḫ Ulūlu&quot; &quot;harvest month&quot; in the Babylonian calendar. The only difference is that in the Babylonian calendar, Ulūlu can serve as a leap month, while in the Jewish calendar, only Adar can serve as a leap month.

Eylül is also the name for September in Turkish; this is derived from &quot;ʾAylūl&quot;, used in Iraq and the Levant (see Arabic names of Gregorian months), from , also tracing its origin from the Akkadian word &quot;Elūlu&quot;. In Hebrew, a popular backronym for Elul is from a verse in the Song of Songs: &quot;Ani LeDodi VeDodi Li&quot; (Chapter 6, verse 3A).

==Customs==
In Jewish tradition, the month of Elul is a time of repentance in preparation for the High Holy Days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. The word &quot;Elul&quot; is similar to the root of the verb &quot;search&quot; in Aramaic. Jewish sources from the 14th century and on write that the Hebrew word &quot;Elul&quot; can be understood to be an bacronym for the phrase &quot;Ani L&#x27;dodi V&#x27;dodi Li&quot; – &quot;I am my beloved&#x27;s and my beloved is mine&quot;, referring to one&#x27;s relationship with God. Elul is seen as a time to search one&#x27;s heart and draw close to God in preparation for the coming Day of Judgement, Rosh Hashanah, and Day of Atonement, Yom Kippur. Rabbi Shneur Zalman of Liadi compared, by way of analogy, the month of Elul to a king visiting his peasants in the field before returning to his palace.

During the month of Elul, there are a number of special rituals leading up to the High Holy Days. It is customary to blow the shofar every morning (except on Shabbat) from Rosh Hodesh Elul (the first day of the month) until the day before Rosh Hashanah. The blasts are meant to awaken one&#x27;s spirits and inspire believers to begin the soul searching which will prepare them for the High Holy Days. As part of this preparation, Elul is the time to begin the sometimes-difficult process of granting and asking for forgiveness. It is also customary to recite a Psalm (27) every day from Rosh Hodesh Elul through Hoshanah Rabbah on Sukkot (in Tishrei).

Aside from the blowing of the shofar, the other significant ritual practice during Elul is to recite selichot (special penitential prayers) either every morning before sunrise beginning on the Sunday immediately before Rosh Hashanah, or, if starting Sunday would not afford four days of selichot, then the Sunday one week prior (Ashkenazi tradition) or every morning during the entire month of Elul (Sephardi tradition). Ashkenazi Jews begin the recitation of selichot with a special service on Saturday night between solar mid-night (not 12:00) and morning light on the first day of Selichot.

Many Jews also visit the graves of loved ones throughout the month in order to remember and honor those people in our past who inspire us to live more fully in the future.

Another social custom is to begin or end all letters written during the month of Elul with wishes that the recipient have a good year. The standard blessing is &quot;&quot; (&quot;a good writing and sealing [of judgement]&quot;), meaning that the person should be written and sealed in the Book of Life for a good year. Tradition teaches that on Rosh Hashanah, each person is written down for a good or a poor year, based on their actions in the previous one, and their sincere efforts at atoning for mistakes or harm. On Yom Kippur, that fate is &quot;sealed.&quot;
