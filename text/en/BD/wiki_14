<text>Wethersfield ( ) is a town located in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. It is located immediately south of Hartford along the Connecticut River. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. The population was 27,298 at the time of the 2020 census.

Many records from colonial times spell the name &quot;Weathersfield&quot; and &quot;Wythersfield&quot;, while Native Americans called it &quot;Pyquag&quot;. &quot;Watertown&quot; is a variant name.

The neighborhood known as Old Wethersfield is the state&#x27;s largest historic district, spanning and containing 1,100 buildings, dating to the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries. The town is primarily served by Interstate 91.

==History==

Founded in 1634 by a Puritan settlement party of &quot;10 Men&quot;, including John Oldham, Robert Seeley, Thomas Topping, and Nathaniel Foote, Wethersfield is arguably the oldest town in Connecticut, depending on the interpretation of when a remote settlement qualifies as a &quot;town&quot;. Along with Windsor and Hartford, Wethersfield is represented by one of the three grapevines on the Flag of Connecticut, signifying the state&#x27;s three oldest English settlements. The town was named by colonists for Wethersfield, a village in the English county of Essex. The town was previously called &quot;Watertown&quot;, named after Watertown, Massachusetts, until February 21, 1637, when it was incorporated as a town along with Windsor and Hartford. The town established the Old Wethersfield Village Cemetery as its first burying ground on Hungry Hill in 1638.

During the Pequot War, on April 23, 1637, Wangunk Chief Sequin, who had lived with the colonists in Wethersfield but had been forced out after a few years, attacked Wethersfield with Pequot help. They killed six men and three women, a number of cattle and horses, and took two young girls captive. They were daughters of Abraham Swain or William Swaine (sources vary), and were later ransomed by Dutch traders.

Four witch trials and three executions for witchcraft occurred in the town in the 17th century. Mary Johnson was convicted of witchcraft and executed in 1648, Joan and John Carrington in 1651. In 1669, landowner Katherine Harrison was convicted, and although her conviction was reversed, she was banished and her property seized by her neighbors.

From 1716 to 1718, the Collegiate School was briefly located in Wethersfield; it moved to New Haven and developed over the decades as Yale University.
Silas Deane, envoy to France during the American Revolutionary War, lived in the town. His house is now preserved and operated as part of the Webb-Deane-Stevens Museum. In May 1781, at the Webb House on Main Street, General George Washington and French Lt. Gen. Rochambeau planned the Siege of Yorktown, which culminated in the surrender of Britain and independence of the colonies.

The Wethersfield Volunteer Fire Department was chartered by the Connecticut Legislature on May 12, 1803, making it the first formally chartered fire department in the state. It is one of the oldest chartered volunteer fire department in continuous existence in the United States.

Wethersfield was &quot;for a century at least, the centre of the onion trade in New England&quot;, during the late 1700s and early to middle 1800s. &quot;Outsiders dubbed the Connecticut village &#x27;Oniontown,&#x27; with a crosshatch of affection and derision, for this was home of the world-famous Wethersfield red onion.&quot;

In addition, the town was home to William G. Comstock, a well-known 19th-century gardening expert and author of the era&#x27;s most prominent gardening book, &quot;Order of Spring Work&quot;. In 1820, Comstock founded what would become Comstock, Ferre &amp; Company, America&#x27;s oldest continuously operating seed company. It pioneered the commercial sale of sealed packets of seeds, as he had learned from the Amish. Other nationally prominent seed companies in and around the town developed from this agricultural past.

A meteorite fell on Wethersfield on November 8, 1982. It was the second meteorite to fall in the town in the span of 11 years, as the first crashed on April 8, 1971. It crashed through the roof of a house without injuring the occupants, as had been the case with the first meteorite as well. The 1971 meteorite was sold to the Smithsonian, and the 1982 meteorite was taken up as part of a collection at the Yale Peabody Museum.

<text>Windsor Locks is a town in Hartford County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the Capitol Planning Region. As of the 2020 census, its population was 12,613. It is the site of Bradley International Airport, which serves the Greater Hartford-Springfield region and occupies approximately a third of the town. Windsor Locks is also the site of the New England Air Museum.

Located beside the Connecticut River and equidistant from the densely populated cities of Springfield, Massachusetts and Hartford, Connecticut, Windsor Locks is named for a set of canal locks that opened in 1829. Windsor Locks is situated just south of the first large falls in the Connecticut River, the Enfield Falls, which is the head of navigation (the farthest point that seagoing vessels can reach) of the Connecticut River. The Enfield Falls Canal circumvents the Enfield Falls and its nearby shallows.

==History==

Originally part of Windsor, Windsor Locks broke off into its own settlement in 1854 named after the thriving Enfield Locks going around Enfield Falls which opened in 1829. Bradley International Airport opened as a military base in 1940, and opened to civilian use in 1947. In 1967 the town boundary was altered due to the opening of the Bradley Airport Connector. The town boundary between Windsor Locks and Windsor changed several times and currently sits with Windsor Locks being on the westbound side and Windsor on the eastbound side of the median of CT Route 20.

==Economy==

Until 2000, Windsor Locks was home to the oldest corporation listed on the New York Stock Exchange, the Dexter Corporation. Established in 1767 as C.H. Dexter and Sons, the company grew from a family-owned saw and grist mill and evolved into a multi-national producer of long fiber papers and chemical laminates. In its 233 years of operation, the company grew from manufacturing tissues, toilet paper, and tea bags to marketing more specialized products like medical garments and industrial finishes. Faced with a proposed buyout by International Specialty Products Incorporated in 2000, the Dexter Corporation separated its three divisions and sold them off to avoid a hostile takeover.

The Life Sciences division merged with Invitrogen Corporation. The Specialty Polymers division was sold in part to AkzoNobel, and the remaining businesses merged with Loctite Corporation. The third division, Dexter Nonwoven Materials, located on the company&#x27;s original site in Windsor Locks, was sold to the Finnish Ahlstrom Paper Group. The physical plant continues to operate, with offices located nearby at 2 Elm Street. In 2011, the Home and Personal Nonwovens division of Ahlstrom Windsor Locks was sold to Suominen Corporation, also headquartered in Finland.

In 1952 Hamilton Standard opened its aircraft propeller plant in Windsor Locks. In 1999, Hamilton Standard merged with Sundstrand Corporation to become Hamilton Sundstrand, which is headquartered in Windsor Locks.

<text>Torrington is the most populated municipality and largest city in Litchfield County, Connecticut, United States, and the Northwest Hills Planning Region. It is also the core city of Greater Torrington, one of the largest micropolitan areas in the United States. The city population was 35,515 according to the 2020 census. The city is located roughly west of Hartford, southwest of Springfield, Massachusetts, southeast of Albany, New York, northeast of New York City, and west of Boston, Massachusetts.

Torrington is a former mill town, as are most other towns along the Naugatuck River Valley. Downtown Torrington is home to the Nutmeg Conservatory for the Arts, which trains ballet dancers and whose Company performs in the Warner Theatre, a 1,700-seat auditorium built in 1931 as a cinema by the Warner Brothers film studio. Downtown Torrington hosts the largest Lodge of Elks in New England. Downtown Torrington also hosts KidsPlay, a children&#x27;s museum which was founded in 2012 and expanded their location in 2015 after purchasing the adjacent building.

Torrington has two radio stations, WAPJ 89.9 FM, operated by the non-profit Torrington Community Radio Foundation, and WSNG 610 AM, owned by Buckley Broadcasting.

Torrington has two daily newspapers. The &quot;Republican-American&quot;, which circulates a Litchfield County edition and has a bureau on Franklin Street, and &quot;The Register Citizen&quot;, which serves Torrington and Winsted, in addition to most of the Northwest Corner. Charlotte Hungerford Hospital has also developed into an important health care resource for the area. In 2008, Torrington was named by Bizjournals as the number one &quot;Dreamtown&quot; (micropolitan statistical area) out of ten in the United States to live in.

==History==

Torrington was first settled in 1735 by Ebenezer Lyman, Jr., of Durham, Connecticut. The downtown section of Torrington was known as Wolcottville, after the Wolcott family of Connecticut, which produced several governors between 1813 and 1881. Its early settlers resided on the hills west of the Naugatuck River where the first school, church, store, and tavern were constructed. Later, the eastern hill known as Torringford was settled, as it provided the best farmland. Torrington was given permission to organize a government and incorporate as a town in October 1740. The town is named after Torrington in Devon, England.

The fast moving waters of the Naugatuck River were used to power early nineteenth-century industries. Industrial growth skyrocketed when Frederick Wolcott constructed a woolen mill in 1813. The mill attracted a large workforce and created demands for goods, services, and housing.

Israel Coe and Erastus Hodges began the construction of two brass mills on the Naugatuck River in 1834. This event sparked the beginning of the brass industry in Torrington, which later would spread throughout the entire Naugatuck Valley. In 1849, the Naugatuck Valley railroad was completed, connecting Torrington with other population centers, ending its isolation, and stimulating further industrial growth. Soon, Torrington was producing a variety of metal products, including needles, brass, hardware, bicycles, and tacks. Torrington&#x27;s growing industrial plants attracted English, Irish, and German immigrants throughout the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Between 1880 and 1920, Torrington&#x27;s population soared from 3,000 to 22,000 as immigration from southern and eastern Europe increased; most immigrants during this period were Poles, Czechs, Slovaks, and Italians. Torrington was chartered as a city in 1923.

In 1955, a massive flood destroyed much of the downtown area and other property in the region when Hurricanes Connie and Diane caused local rivers to overflow. Torrington is home to several state parks, one of which is the very popular Burr Pond State Park. In 1851, Milo Burr placed a dam across the confluence of several mountain streams impounding water for power. The tannery and three active sawmills erected downstream consumed the finest pines and oaks for miles around to meet the needs of lumber production. The clearings became homesites, and Connecticut&#x27;s industrial leadership was further strengthened. Burr Pond was designated as a state park in 1949. The pond itself has several small inlets and islands. The shore is rocky and there are deep drop-offs in several places, but the pond only has a maximum depth of thirteen feet. Fish species present include largemouth bass, chain pickerel, black crappie, yellow perch, bluegill, pumpkinseed, and brown bullhead.
Gail Borden, discoverer of the process of milk preservation by evaporation and condensation, built the world&#x27;s first condensed milk factory here, in 1856. The new milk product proved to be of great value, particularly to the Union Army during the Civil War. Fire destroyed the mill in 1877. A bronze tablet marks its site, just below the falls.

Torrington is the birthplace of abolitionist John Brown. The birthplace accidentally burned in 1918.
In the year 2000, the Torrington Historical Society acquired the property in merger with the John Brown Association. Plans are now being formulated to improve visitor services and to construct interpretive trails on the property.

There was a 100-acre University of Connecticut regional campus in Torrington. It closed in May 2016 due to low enrollment In 2018, the site was sold to Five Points Arts Gallery for $375,000.

===Downtown redevelopment===

Torrington is planning to revitalize its downtown area in an effort to attract residents and visitors to the city&#x27;s shopping and cultural opportunities. These redevelopment plans are still in discussion and are not yet completed. The City of Torrington will receive $500,000 for improvements and streetscape enhancements to Torrington&#x27;s Main Street and downtown. The grant, which will flow through the state, will be designated for downtown improvements on the east side of Main Street and will include, among other enhancements, new sidewalks. A $750,000 grant for downtown improvements secured earlier in 2012 for the west side of Main Street will make similar improvements.

The following ideas have been discussed:

====Coe Memorial Park restoration====

The historic restoration and renovation to downtown Coe Memorial Park were completed in the beginning of 2004. The Coe Memorial Park Subcommittee and the City of Torrington, worked closely with Ferrero Hixon Associates, to restore the Park to a Victorian walking park, much as it was when it was first gifted to the Town in 1906. These renovations included new sidewalks and paths, and the relocation of memorials and monuments. In 2005, award-winning horticulturist, Gwenythe B. Harvey, owner of the firm The Garden Goddess, LLC, was hired to redefine, design and upgrade existing garden areas. Coe Memorial Park&#x27;s Botanical Gardens has since become a well-known tourist destination.

====Retail expansion====
Torrington hopes to attract a wide variety of merchants into its downtown setting. Empty and abandoned buildings would be converted into a mix of retail, office, and residential space. A potential plan discusses the possibility of a national clothing retailer or bookstore chain constructing a location at the top of Water Street on the site of the Kelley Bus Company. This plan had come under fire by some because it involves the demolition of the former Torrington railroad station, which is considered by many to be historical. Despite this, the 113-year-old former Torrington railroad station was demolished, as a safety hazard, on January 4, 2011. The historical society was able to save a few pieces, including the ticket window and some of the terra-cotta ornaments from the outside of the building.

====Accessibility====
A parking garage is slated to be constructed in the heart of downtown on either Main Street or Water Street. The municipal parking lot next to the Torrington Library would also serve as a downtown parking area. Because the downtown redevelopment project emphasizes pedestrian access, brick sidewalks lined with trees, benches, and bike racks would be constructed along Main Street.

====Roads and traffic====
To relieve congestion, the city plans to convert the Main Street/Water Street/East Main Street downtown intersection into a &quot;+&quot; shape, rather than its current criticized setup. The city expects to convert Main Street into a one-way road with parking lining one side of the street. The neighboring Prospect Street would also be converted into a one-way road with traffic flowing in the opposite direction. Most of the roads are in medium to poor condition and filled with pot holes.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 40.4 square miles (104.6 km). Approximately 39.8 square miles (103.1 km) of this area is land and 1.5 km (0.6 sq mi or 1.41%) is water.

The eastern and western sides of the city, at its borders, are at the tops of peaks, while the downtown and central sections of the city are in the Naugatuck River Valley. This provides some interesting views from the higher locations, with the city lights as a backdrop below. Due to the lack of suitable highways and bypass routes in an east–west direction, crossing the city requires driving down into the valley and back up the other side.

===Principal communities===
*Burrville
*Drakeville
*Newfield
*Torringford (part of which has been named the Torringford Street Historic District)
*Downtown Torrington
*West Torrington
*Wrightville

In 1984–1985, Torrington&#x27;s Police Department was sued by Tracey Thurman, who was nearly killed in 1983 by her estranged husband Charles &quot;Buck&quot; Thurman. In &quot;Thurman v. City of Torrington&quot; (finalized 1985), the federal court levied a $2.3 million judgment against the city for refusing to enforce its previous restraining orders because the perpetrator was married to the victim. Thurman&#x27;s abuse, attempted murder and lawsuit were later depicted in a 1989 made-for-TV movie &quot;A Cry for Help: The Tracey Thurman Story&quot;, starring Nancy McKeon.

In March 2013, Torrington received a degree of national notoriety for a statutory rape case involving three teen-aged boys accused of sexually assaulting two 13-year-old girls. Joan Toribio and Edgar Gonzalez, both 18, were among the accused. Both were popular high school football players, who claimed that the encounters were consensual. The third male, Dylan Rodriguez, was underage himself. Several dozen Torrington High School students rallied around the accused and allegedly aggressively bullied the victims online. One of the victims was called a “hoe” on her Facebook page and blamed for &quot;ruining the lives&quot; of the accused. Despite receiving national criticism, Torrington High School students continued to use social media to support the defendants, posting online photos while diminishing the validity and severity of the victim&#x27;s claims.

==Sports teams/events==

=== Baseball ===

A professional baseball team and two collegiate baseball teams have played their home games at Fuessenich Park.

The Torrington Titans played in the Futures Collegiate Baseball League (FCBL) of New England. They played their inaugural season in the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League (ACBL), a collegiate summer baseball league. After leading the ACBL in attendance in 2010, the team was sold to the Carminucci Sports Group (CSG), which transferred their affiliation to the Futures League. CSG also owns or owned the Brockton Rox of the professional Can-Am League and the Martha&#x27;s Vineyard Sharks of the FCBL.

In 2009, an organization called Our Baseball Haven, introduced a unique concept and proposal through which a collegiate baseball team could once again call Torrington its home. The concept, called &quot;crowdsourcing&quot; was supported by some five hundred individuals and the Peekskill (NY) Robins of the Atlantic Collegiate Baseball League (ACBL) were moved to Torrington and their name changed to the Torrington Titans. The Titans capped their successful 2010 inaugural season by winning the Kaiser Division. The Titans did not return for the 2017 season 

The Torrington Twisters were a member of the New England Collegiate Baseball League (NECBL) from 1997 to 2008. Torrington twice played host to the league All-Star Game (1998, 2008) and generally placed high in their division each season. The organization made an abrupt move to Massachusetts after 2008.

A professional baseball team once located in the city was known as the Torrington Braves, and were a member of the Colonial League. After just one season, 1950, they disbanded.

=== Running ===

The Torrington Road Race is a five-mile (8 km) run, which coincides with Donor&#x27;s Week in August. Starting at Coe Memorial Park, the course extends to the farther reaches of the valley, including Riverside Avenue, Migeon Avenue, Prospect Street and others. The race, which started in 1972, primarily includes runners from around Connecticut and has also attracted some runners each year from Massachusetts, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and others. The record time for the race was 24:22 by Evance Rotich in 2008. Chris Chisholm holds the record for number of times winning the race with six (1984, 2002–2003, 2013–2015), and Anne Curi-Preisig holds the record for most first-place woman finishes with six (1990–1991, 1993–1996).

<text>East Haven is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 27,923. The town is located east of New Haven, and is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region. East Haven is from Hartford, from New York City, from Providence, Rhode Island, and from Boston.

==History==
The Connecticut Colony granted the town petition for Township in May 1707 and colonists changed the name from Iron Works Village to East Haven. Some outstanding land issues with New Haven and a minor feud with Governor Gurdon Saltonstall resulted in the rescinding of the township status; the area was made a parish of New Haven.
Once home to a large Italian population, New Haven and neighboring towns such as East Haven have been destinations for a new wave of immigrants since the late 20th century, the majority of whom in East Haven are Latinos from Ecuador. In the 2010 census, Hispanics and Latinos made up more than 10% of the town&#x27;s population.

On August 9, 2013, a Rockwell International Turbo Commander 690B crashed on approach, hitting two houses in an East Haven residential neighborhood near the airport. The impact and the resulting fires destroyed both houses. The private plane had taken off from Teterboro Airport in New Jersey. The incident resulted in four deaths: the pilot of the plane; his passenger, the pilot&#x27;s 17-year-old son; and two children in one of the houses. They were girls of 13 years and one year of age.

==Geography and climate==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of ， of which is land and (8.57%) is water. East Haven also contains Stony Island, approximately from East Haven Town Beach in Long Island Sound.

The shape of East Haven on a map is taller than it is wide. It is bordered on the south by Long Island Sound, on the west by New Haven, on the north by North Haven, and on the east by Branford, Lake Saltonstall, and North Branford. East Haven shares with New Haven the land belonging to local Tweed New Haven Airport and Alling Memorial Golf Course.

===Geology===

During the Paleozoic Era, 450 to 250 million years ago, several tectonic plates collided to form the supercontinent called Pangaea. East Haven was located in the middle of this collision, and the results can be seen today with the schists, gneisses and granites which are exposed.

When Pangaea was broken up, during the Triassic and Jurassic periods, volcanic activity occurred, depositing basalt or trap rock. Earthquakes can still be felt in the area. In February 2001 the area was rocked by a 1.8 magnitude earthquake originating in Madison, Connecticut.

It is estimated that Connecticut was covered by glaciers at least two times. The last glacier is estimated to have been thick in the New Haven area. 22,000 years ago, the glacier moved south, eroding mountains and pushing through East Haven to deposit large amounts of glacial till to form Long Island. 14,000 years ago the glacier retreated and shaped the coastline, formed Long Island Sound and created Lake Saltonstall. It also deposited glacial till, soil, sand, rocks and boulders that the ice carried south from the north.

The coast is primarily covered by gneiss rock (including granite), schist and quartzite. The remaining sections are part of the Central Valley of Connecticut and are covered with clastic sedimentary rock (redbeds, conglomerate, sandstone, brownstone and shale). This soft surface has been resedimented by a number of floods, making the soil soft and fertile and ideal for farmland.

Brownstone, a sedimentary rock that erodes easily, was easily dug into by glaciers and carved out many lakes and valleys. The area surrounding Farms River and Lake Saltonstall on the East Haven and Branford border is an example of this. The brownstone that did not erode was used for building foundations and rock fences found throughout New England.

Deposits of basalt (lava flow) can be found in the north and northeast sections of East Haven. Several quarries can be found in this area. Traprock (basalt) is turned into crushed stone. It is primarily used in construction and in the bedding of roads. Sand and gravel from glacial till is the second most profitable quarried rock. They are used as fill, in concrete, leach fields or for road sand.

===Animals and plants===
When Pangaea was broken up, East Haven had forests. Dinosaurs, reptiles and mammals roamed the area. Dinosaur trackways like those found in Rocky Hill at Dinosaur State Park were recently found at a construction site near Lake Saltonstall. The tracks were made by &quot;Eubrontes&quot;. Fossils of Triassic period reptiles have been found in the area. Stegomus was covered with armor plates and looked similar to an armadillo.

Today, East Haven is mostly covered with broadleaf, hardwood trees. There are a few conifer (evergreen) forests, mostly around Lake Saltonstall. Salt marshes are located in areas around Long Island Sound.

Dinosaurs were long ago succeeded by deer, coyotes, squirrels, foxes, chipmunks and rabbits. Garter snakes can be found in the area. Pheasants, grouse, ducks and wild turkeys can be found in East Haven, as well as cardinals, blue jays, warblers, crows, sparrows, parrots, woodpeckers and sea gulls. Trout can be found in the fresh water lakes. Bluefish, bass, flounder, blackfish, sand sharks, eels, lobsters, crabs and clams can be found in Long Island Sound.

==Communities==

The residents of the town divide it into three large &quot;sections&quot; rather than smaller neighborhoods. These sections are:

===Foxon===
The area borders Branford and North Branford on the east, New Haven on the west to about Grannis Pond in the south, and surrounds State Route 80. This is the hilliest section of town. It counts among its landmarks the town high school, Foxon Park Beverage (a locally famous soda manufacturer), and Camp Murray, a Girl Scouts day camp. Grannis Pond used to host a YMCA camp until the land was sold and developed.

===Momauguin===
The area is located in the southern section of East Haven, from the Caroline Creek section of East Haven on the west to Branford on the east and starting at Short Beach Road in the north. This section includes the town beach, numerous condominiums, and summer cottages. The area near Tweed New Haven Airport has an industrial park that includes Town Fair Tire Centers Headquarters and Calabro Cheese Corporation.

===&quot;The Center&quot;===
The Center is not the geographical center of town but the hub of the administrative facilities. Landmarks include the Town Hall, Fire Department Headquarters, Hagaman Memorial Library, the &quot;old&quot; East Haven High School, and other administrative buildings. The old high school has been adapted for use by the East Haven Historical Society, and a teen center. The Police Department and Public Works Department reside on the &quot;Center&quot; – Foxon line.

The most recognizable landmark in East Haven is the Old Stone Church. Built in 1774, the steeple of the church stands out against the low horizon.

The Town Green is a park located at the eastern end of the central business district (two blocks east of the town hall) and is mostly covered by trees. Monuments are dedicated to honor war veterans and firefighters. The focal point of the green is the gazebo or bandstand. The Green is the site of the annual East Haven Fall Festival and summer concerts.

Margaret Tucker Park is considered the second East Haven Green, with its location across the street from Town Hall and the Old Stone Church. They have developed additional land to the park, along with a water fountain.

Included in this section is the &quot;West End&quot;, which borders New Haven. Since the late 20th century, conditions have declined in this area of older housing. Efforts are underway to revitalize the area that most residents think have been overlooked with all the focus of the re-development efforts in the center of town.

The Senior Center is located one block from Town Hall. The town has a weekly Farmers&#x27; Market held at the Town Hall on Sundays. This market features fresh produce, flowers, baked goods and crafts. Some weeks feature fundraising for town institutions.

==Climate==

East Haven&#x27;s climate is tempered by its location on Long Island Sound; it has a humid subtropical climate according to the Koppen climate system.

It is not unusual to have a dusting of snow by the coast and an inch of snowfall in the northern areas of East Haven. The town is vulnerable to Nor&#x27;easter weather systems that can drop heavy rain or snow in the region. The Blizzard of 1888 dropped about 40 inches of snow, while the Blizzard of 1978 dropped almost .

Severe weather does occur in East Haven. The area has been hit by several hurricanes, most recently in August 2011 when Hurricane Irene severely damaged numerous shore areas, destroying houses along Cosey Beach. In 1985, the eye of Hurricane Gloria came across state 22 west of East Haven. The area was without electricity, telephone and cable TV service for 7 days.

Tornadoes sometimes occur in Connecticut. Though the town was not directly affected, a tornado touched down in Hamden on July 10, 1989, away. On August 11, 2016, a tornado touched down in North Haven, away.

==Government==
===Town Government===
Beginning in the late 1990s, Republican Joe Maturo, Jr. served as mayor for a decade, being repeatedly re-elected to the two-year terms, serving from 1997 to 2007. In 1998 he appointed Leonard Gallo as Police Chief, who served until January 2012.

Maturo was defeated on November 6, 2007, by Democratic challenger, April Capone Almon, by an apparent 21 votes. The slim margin of victory forced an automatic recount, and two were required. On November 14, 2007, Capone Almon was certified as the winner over Maturo by 25 votes. She was the first female mayor of East Haven and the youngest at age 32. She was re-elected in 2009, serving for two terms. After receiving a preliminary report in 2010 of a Department of Justice investigation of police department mistreatment of Latino residents, she put Police Chief Gallo on administrative leave pending completion of the investigation. That year a separate class action civil rights suit was filed on behalf of Latino residents against the city by Yale Law School’s Worker and Immigrant Rights Advocacy Clinic, naming 20 defendants, most with the police department.

Former mayor Joe Maturo had defeated incumbent mayor Almon on November 8, 2011, by an apparent 31 votes. The slim margin of victory forced an automatic recount. On November 12, 2011, Maturo was certified as the winner over Almon by 34 votes. By winning a sixth term, Maturo became the longest-serving mayor in the town&#x27;s history. He reinstated Gallo. DOJ submitted its final report to the city in December 2011, detailing a pattern of harassment against Latinos. Four officers were arrested on January 24, 2010, under the Department of Justice criminal investigation, charged with harassing Latinos. Police Chief Gallo was allowed to resign in late January 2012. Two of the officers pleaded guilty in 2012, and two were convicted at trial in 2013, being sentenced in 2014 to varying terms in prison. In 2013, Maturo easily defeated Jack Stacey to earn a seventh term.

Joe Maturo retired after his term ended in 2019. 2019 election saw Democratic Candidate Joseph Carfora defeat Republican candidate Steve Tracey and Independent candidate Bonifacio Sioson, 3865 votes to 3169 and 292 respectively. Joseph Carafora was elected to a second term when he defeated Republican challenger Salvatore Maltese 4208 votes to 1866 votes.

Based on the separate 2010 class action civil rights suit, the city reached a settlement in June 2014 to pay $450,000 to the Latino class members and change immigration enforcement to clearly separate it from regular policing. The city &quot;will no longer detain undocumented people for immigration authorities unless they have a judge-signed criminal warrant.&quot; The city admitted no wrongdoing.

The 2006 Mill Rate was 31.20. Total revenue in 2022 was $117,049,457 with total expenditures of $123,548,617.00 for an overbudget total of $26,808,566. Total Indebtedness was $38,493,587. Moody&#x27;s Bond rating (2019) for the town was A3 and Standards and Poor A.

In 1997, an East Haven police officer, Sergeant Robert Flodquist, was accused of using excessive force in a police action which killed Malik Jones, an African-American suspect. Subsequently, state and federal prosecutors failed to find enough evidence for criminal charges against Flodquist. His shooting of Jones was ruled justified; Flodquist testified in the investigation that Jones tried to run him over. Police Chief Leonard Gallo, who had been hired in 1998 from New Haven by Mayor Joseph A. Maturo, Jr., appointed Flodquist as the department&#x27;s public spokesman.

Neither the family nor civil rights activists were satisfied with the failure by the state and federal government to prosecute in the Jones case. Activists have used the case &quot;to argue successfully for new state legislation aimed at limiting racial profiling&quot; by local and state police departments.

The Jones family filed a civil suit in US District Court, saying that Malik Jones civil rights were violated and seeking damages. In July 2003 a federal jury ruled in their favor and awarded them $2.5 million in punitive damages. Because in such a case the city was not liable for punitive damages, another hearing was held to settle whether there should be compensatory damages; the award was reduced in October 2010 to $900,000. The East Haven city attorney said the town intended to appeal this decision.

Separately, in September 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) began investigating the East Haven Police for racial profiling and harassment of Latinos following the &quot;unwarranted arrest&quot; of Father Paul Manship, a Catholic priest who was trying to study complaints by Latino parishioners that they were victims of police discrimination. That year the police arrested Mayor April Capone Almon and her assistant for allegedly interfering with a ticketing action at the beach. The DOJ investigation later reported having found that records related to Capone Almon&#x27;s arrest and that of Manship had been altered numerous times.

With civil and criminal investigations underway, DOJ issued a preliminary report to the city in 2010, saying that the police appeared to have a pattern of discrimination and harassment against Latinos. Mayor April Capone Almon put Police Chief Leonard Gallo (in office since 1998) on administrative leave until the investigation was concluded.

After Joseph A. Maturo, Jr. was elected as mayor in November 2011, he reinstated Gallo. On his first day, the police chief barred police commission members, who were investigating an officer about whom they had received complaints, from police headquarters and the parking lot without his permission. A few days later, the commission established a policy requiring its members be given free access to the police headquarters and any members of the department.

The Department of Justice submitted its &quot;scathing&quot; final report of the civil investigation to the city in December 2011, saying the police department had shown a pattern of discrimination against Latinos, and Gallo had &quot;resisted efforts to root out problems.&quot; Its report concluded that &quot;EHPD has engaged in a pattern or practice of discrimination against Latinos, a violation of the Constitution and federal law.&quot;

On January 24, 2012, Sergeant John Miller and three officers were arrested by the FBI on a ten-count indictment, on charges of conspiracy, false arrest, and excessive force and obstruction of justice in connection with the investigation. A local businessman had complained to the mayor&#x27;s office that the officers stopped his employees to check their documentation as they entered and left his place of business. Numerous other charges were detailed in the indictment. Numerous other complaints had been collected. Press reports indicated a suspicion among the investigators that the chief of the department, Leonard Gallo, was involved in obstructing justice and had tried to hinder the investigation.

Several other East Haven officers attended the arraignment to show support. Mayor Joseph Maturo and the police union also stood by the officers pending results of prosecution. The government asked that Officer Dennis Spaulding be barred from entering the town for fear he would intimidate possible witnesses; officer Zullo was also barred from the town until the cases were resolved. Police Chief Leonard Gallo was allowed to resign in late January 2012.

In September 2012, Miller pleaded guilty to having struck a handcuffed person. In October 2012, Officer Jason Zullo pleaded guilty to obstruction of justice under a deal that will require him to serve one or two years in jail. David Cari continued to fight the charges.

Maturo replaced police chief Gallo with Brent Larrabee, formerly the police chief of Stamford. On October 23, 2012, the Associated Press reported that the city had reached a settlement with the DOJ on its &quot;claims that officers engaged in a pattern of discrimination and abuse toward Latinos.&quot; The settlement will require actions in seven major areas to improve conditions, including policy and training related to search and seizure, management and supervision of officers, civilian control and resolution of complaints, racial sensitivity training, community outreach and development of trust with all residents.

Convicted at trial in October 2013, on January 23, 2014, Officer Dennis Spaulding was sentenced to five years in prison. At his sentencing, he insisted he had done nothing wrong. Cari was also convicted at trial; in January 2014 he was sentenced to two and a half years in prison.

===Schools===

Education in the New Haven Colony was important. The colony had required that each parish provide a common school. Prior to 1700, the parish education was being provided by the Congregational Church. The town voted in 1706 to build the first public school. The school was located around what is now 260 Hemingway Avenue. In 1707 the town established a school board to oversee the education system. By 1728 East Haven had split their system into 4 school districts.

The first town high school was opened on September 28, 1936, in the &quot;Center&quot; of town. Prior to the building of the high school, students had to apply to local town high schools for acceptance into their school system. A new junior high school complex was built in 1957. In 1997, a new high school campus was built in the Foxon section of town.

Today the school system operates 9 schools. In 2014 there were 2,933 students enrolled in the East Haven Public School system, with 232 teachers for a student/teacher ratio of 13:1. The town&#x27;s budget allocated for FY 2014 was $46,410,357.00. The cost per student was approximately $18,495.00 per student.

<text>Meriden ( ) is a city in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, located halfway between the regional cities of New Haven and Hartford. The city is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region. In 2020, the population of the city was 60,850.

==History==


===18th century===

Meriden was originally a part of the neighboring town of Wallingford. It was granted a separate meetinghouse in 1727, became a town in 1806 with over 1,000 residents. Meriden was incorporated as a city in 1867, with just under 9,000 residents. It was once proposed as the Connecticut state capital. It was named for the village of Meriden, West Midlands, England, near Birmingham.

The oldest house in town still standing, built by Solomon Goffe in 1711, became a museum in 1986. The building is the Solomon Goffe House.

The grave of Winston Churchill&#x27;s great-great-great maternal grandfather, Timothy Jerome, can be seen today at what is now called &quot;Burying Ground 1720&quot; (Google Maps: ) at the juncture of Dexter Avenue and Lydale Place. At the time the location was known as &quot;Buckwheat Hill&quot;, and overlooked the salt-making estate for which Jerome had received a royal grant. Timothy Jerome&#x27;s son, Samuel, is the great-great-grandfather of Jennie Jerome, Winston Churchill&#x27;s mother.

===19th century to World War II===

In the second half of the 1800s, Meriden became a manufacturing center of note, with several companies forming, or relocating to the city, involved in the production of mainly silver, lamps and metalware, glassware, guns, and musical instruments. A substantial number of design and technology patents were secured.

====Silver and cutlery====

For silver, the numerous companies included the Meriden Britannia Company (a predecessor of the International Silver Company with corporate HQ in Meriden), Meriden earned the nickname &quot;Silver City&quot;, due to the large number of silver manufacturers, and the International Silver Co. continued production until the early 1980s. Along with the silver companies, other producers of cutlery included the Meriden Cutlery Co. and Miller Bros. Cutlery.

In 1876, the Meriden Britannia Company made significant efforts at the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia, and won the First place medal for plated wares. According to the Sotheby&#x27;s auction house, &quot;The publicity of the award and the impression the firm made on the fair&#x27;s 8 million visitors was continued by the catalogues and other intensive marketing; by the end of the 1870s Meriden Britannia Co. was considered the largest silverware company in the world.&quot; A key design attributed to launching the company and the town&#x27;s international name was the &quot;Buffalo Hunt&quot; with a smaller edition in the White House collection, Washington, DC. For some time the original &quot;Buffalo Hunt&quot; sculpture went missing, and in a shocking report by Bailey Wright in 2018, it was learned that it was recently &#x27;missing&#x27; actually in Meriden.

====Lamps and metalware====

For lamps and metalware, the companies with national and international markets included the Edward Miller &amp; Co / Miller Company (1844–stopped manufacturing lighting ), the Charles Parker Company, Handel Company, and the Bradley &amp; Hubbard Manufacturing Company (1852–1940), which also was widely known for producing metal-based products like decorative tables and andirons.

====Glassware====

For glassware, the companies included the C.F. Monroe Company (1892–1916). and the Meriden Flint Glass Company (1876–1892),

====Kitchen appliances and guns====

Manning, Bowman &amp; Co. (1849–1945) centered its production in Meriden, and into the early 20th century became a nationally known producer of small electrical appliances and chrome ware. Meriden was also the site of the production of Parker Brothers (guns), widely-known and traded by firearms enthusiasts. From 1905 to 1918, the Meriden Firearms Co. manufactured small arms from 1905 to 1918. The stock was owned by Sears, Roebuck &amp; Company.

====Musical instruments including player pianos====

Internationally known companies Wilcox and White and the Aeolian Company were involved in the production of musical instruments north of the downtown area at Tremont and Cambridge Streets. The Aeolian Company grew quickly forming production sites in other places and developed a music hall in New York. (The largest holder today of instruments and music rolls by the two companies is the Pianola Museum in Amsterdam, the Netherlands.)

====Graphic arts innovation====

Meriden also was an important site for graphic arts innovation. In 1888, the Meriden Gravure Company (in Meriden 1888–1989) was founded by Charles Parker and James F. Allen, and continued a previous printing operation by Parker. The company developed an expertise in high quality image reproduction, which initially was driven by the needs of the silver industry.

With the wealth of entrepreneurs during this time, several mansions and houses of note were built, particularly on Broad Street.

Of political and historical note, on March 7, 1860, Abraham Lincoln spoke in Meriden seeking the Republican presidential nomination.


For public places, Hubbard Park in the Hanging Hills was financed by Walter Hubbard (of the Bradley &amp; Hubbard company). The design for the park was originally conceived by Hubbard in consultation with the Olmsted Brothers, sons of Frederick Law Olmsted, America&#x27;s foremost landscape architect. In 1900, Castle Craig on a peak was dedicated in the park. In 1903, the Curtis Memorial Library, across from Meriden&#x27;s city hall, was opened.

====Hollywood connection (1937–1950)====

From 1937 until 1947, the International Silver Company sponsored the Silver Theater, a national radio program broadcast via CBS in Hollywood. The radio program featured many Hollywood actors and actresses of the time like Jimmy Stewart and Rosalind Russell. Over 200 programs were produced. In , several Hollywood stars, including Judy Garland, Ginger Rogers and Barbara Stanwyck, endorsed the company&#x27;s 1847 Rogers Bros. silverware in print advertisements in LIFE magazine.

After World War II, in 1949–1950, The Silver Theatre was brought to television and broadcast on CBS, also with the International Silver Company as the sponsor. Guest stars included Eva Gabor, Kim Hunter, and Burgess Meredith.

====Legacy of Meriden&#x27;s grand manufacturing era====

A few thousand designs from this manufacturing era from Meriden are in museums and historical societies across the United States and into Europe, Australia and New Zealand. Design objects from this era from Meriden have also been included in over 200 national and international exhibitions and expositions since the 1850s. The 1930s tea urn by Eliel Saarinen for the Wilcox Silver Plate Co. / International Silver Company, Meriden, is the one design exhibited most and most published in design books as an international Modern design icon.

Some comparatively recent examples of Meriden designs in exhibitions include &quot;In pursuit of Beauty: Americans and the Aesthetic Movement&quot; at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York (1986–1987), and more recently, &quot;Modernism in American Silver: 20th century design&quot; (2005–2006) in Dallas, Miami Beach, and Washington, DC, which highlighted downtown Meriden and the area&#x27;s role as an important center of Modernist silver production. In &quot;19th century Modern&quot; (2011–2012) in Brooklyn, designs by the International Silver Company and the Napier Company, another Meriden manufacturer, were exhibited. In November 2016 – November 2017, the city&#x27;s iconic Napier penguin cocktail shaker was in an exhibition at the Dallas Museum of Art; the Napier penguin was the lead image of the show.

In summer 2017 alone, historical Meriden area design was exhibited in museum shows in at least Dallas, Newark, at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, the Cooper-Hewitt Smithsonian Museum in New York, the Gemeentemuseum in The Hague, The Netherlands, and the KunstHalle in Berlin, Germany.

With this level of attention, some special design objects from the era have become sought-after collectors items also at auction, sometimes due to their association with the commission or commissioner, or the status of the design, or being in the sought-after Modernism style. For example, a painted glass and metal table lamp by Bradley and Hubbard, () sold for US$14,950, doubling its estimate, at Christie&#x27;s auction house in New York in 1999. Later, a 14-inch, International Silver Company cocktail shaker () sold for US$21,600 tripling its estimate, at Christie&#x27;s in New York in 2005. A Parker gun made for a Russian czar before World War I, but never delivered, was reported to have been sold for US$287,500 in 2007. In 2008, a rare Handel lamp sold for US$85,000. On March 5–6, 2014 at Sotheby&#x27;s in London, &quot;Al Capone&#x27;s cocktail shaker&quot; made by the Meriden International Sterling Company () achieved over 33 times its estimate with a sale price of GBP50,000 (US$83,250 on the day). Lastly, in 2014, at Sotheby&#x27;s New York, a rare Paul Lobel-designed coffee service () produced by the Wilcox Silver Plate Co. / International Silver Company sold for US$377,000.

===WWII–1970s===

In 1939, Edwin Howard Armstrong, a network radio pioneer who invented FM radio, used West Peak in 1939 for the location of one of the first FM radio broadcasts. His original radio mast still stands on the peak. Currently West Peak is home to six FM broadcast stations, including WNPR, WWYZ, WKSS, WDRC-FM, WMRQ-FM and WHCN.

During World War II, factories in Meriden worked three shifts (24 hours/day). On March 8, 1944, the War Manpower Commission gave Meriden the designation as &quot;National Ideal War Community&quot;, and Jimmy Durante and Glenn Miller entertained those at the ceremony.

In addition to manufacturers that continued operations after World War II, starting in the later 1940s, the Miller Company, Burton Tremaine, Sr. and Emily Hall Tremaine firmly put Meriden on the international, 20th century art/design map. In December 1947, Meriden became known once again as a site of design innovation, now with Modern art, via the Miller Company Collection of Abstract Art and the organization of a &quot;Painting toward architecture&quot; exhibition which opened at Hartford&#x27;s Wadsworth Atheneum and later travelled to venues in 27 venues across the United States (1947–52). Substantial national media coverage reported on the exhibition. &quot;Painting toward architecture&quot; is considered one of the important art-design-architecture crossover exhibitions of the 20th century, tabling European influences for usage in the Post-World War II United States. In the 1950s, the Miller Company Collection of Abstract Art was privatized to &quot;Mr &amp; Mrs Burton Tremaine, Meriden, CT&quot; and numerous artworks were lent to hundreds of exhibitions nationally and internationally into the 1970s with this designation.

In 1965, the Miller Company addition on Center Street was completed. The black-and-white Modernist facade was designed by influential American architect Philip Johnson.

On April 27, 1976, Jimmy Carter campaigned at city hall and the Latin American Society for the nomination of the Democratic Party for President of the United States.

=== 1980s–present ===

In 1981, the Ku Klux Klan was present in Meriden, holding various rallies in the first half of the year. At these rallies, Connecticut State Police would protect the KKK from anti-KKK protestors. At a March 21, 1981, rally, where the KKK was showing support for a police officer who killed a Black person, protestors threw rocks at the KKK. Two protesters were injured.

In 1987, the Emily Hall Tremaine Foundation was founded by the noted art collector that partly worked in Meriden, before her death, with three focus areas: learning disabilities, the arts, and the environment. The offices were located in downtown Meriden. In , the foundation offices were relocated to New Haven, near Yale University.

The Franciscan Sisters of the Eucharist have their mother house in Meriden, as do the Franciscan Brothers of the Eucharist. The headquarters of Eastern Mountain Sports is located in Meriden.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of 24.1 square miles (62.5 km), of which 23.8 square miles (61.5 km) is land and 0.4 square miles (1.0 km), or 1.66%, is water.

Meriden is a showcase for a number of prominent peaks of the Metacomet Ridge, a mountainous trap rock ridgeline that stretches from Long Island Sound to nearly the Vermont border. Notable peaks in Meriden include the Hanging Hills (West Peak, East Peak, South Mountain, and Cathole Mountain); Lamentation Mountain, Chauncey Peak, and Besek Mountain. Castle Craig, a city landmark for over a century, was constructed among the Hanging Hills in Hubbard Park.

The Quinnipiac River courses through the southwest quadrant of the city, known to area residents as &quot;South Meriden&quot;, where it meanders through a gorge lined with several exposed sandstone and brownstone cliffs. Harbor Brook (originally named Pilgrim Harbor Brook) cuts through the town from the northeast to the southwest before emptying into Hanover Pond, an impoundment on the Quinnipiac River in South Meriden.

As of the 2010 census, there were 60,868 people in Meriden, with a population density of 2558 persons per square mile. There were 23,922 households (2009–2013). The average household size was 2.49 and the average family size was 3.10. Husband-wife households account for 41% of all households. The population under 5 years (2010) was 6.7%, under 18 years (2010) was 23.9%, and 65 years and over was 12.9%. The female population was 51.6% compared to the male population at 48.4% (2010).

The racial makeup of the city in 2010 was 73.5% White, 9.7% Black or African American, 0.5% Native American, 2.1% Asian, 0.1% Pacific Islander, 10.7% from other races, and 3.5% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 28.9% of the population. In 2009–2013, 9.7% of the population was foreign-born.

===Political affiliation===
== Government ==
Until 1980, the city had a Mayor-Council (&quot;strong mayor&quot;) structure. The last full-time strong mayor was Walter Evilia, a Republican and a former State Representative. Dana Miller was appointed the first city manager. The City Charter was last amended in 1994, giving the then largely ceremonial position of mayor more influence over city governance, including appointments to all boards and commissions and other positions within the appointing power of the City Council, as well as line-item veto over city budgets.

The current mayor, Kevin Scarpati, became the youngest popularly-elected mayor in the city&#x27;s history, winning the 2015 election race by 78 votes against mayor Manny Santos, who had been the first Republican elected as mayor in nearly 30 years (the last being Walter Evilia). In 2018, Manny Santos ran an unsuccessful election for U.S. Congress in the 5th Congressional House District.

The city gained notoriety in government and political circles when in 2014, at the urging of newly elected mayor, Manny Santos, plaintiffs sued to remove appointees of boards and commissions and corporation counsel. Ultimately, the ruling by the state Supreme Court to vacate the appointments followed that of a lower court order. The appointments had been made by former mayor, Michael Rohde. In its ruling, the court noted, per the city charter, that the city council can appoint a corporation counsel, but only on the recommendation of the mayor, who at the time was Manny Santos.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===
====Highway====
The city of Meriden is located on Interstate 91, which provides access to Hartford, Springfield, and New Haven. Interstate 691 provides access to Interstate 84 and connects to points west like Waterbury. The Wilbur Cross Parkway (Connecticut Route 15) travels in a southwestern direction connecting to towns and cities like Wallingford, New Haven, and towards New York City. The parkway becomes the Berlin Turnpike (also Connecticut Route 15) on the northern end of Meriden. U.S. Route 5 passes through the city as North and South Broad Street.

====Railroad====
Meriden Transit Center is located in downtown Meriden on the New Haven–Springfield Line, which runs between cities of New Haven and Springfield via Hartford. It is served by CT Rail Hartford Line commuter rail service, as well as Amtrak &quot;Hartford Line,&quot; &quot;Northeast Regional&quot;, &quot;Valley Flyer&quot;, and &quot;Vermonter&quot; inter-city rail service.

The Meriden, Waterbury and Connecticut River Railroad opened between Cromwell and Waterbury via Meriden in 1888–89. Passenger service west of Meriden to Waterbury ended in 1917, while Connecticut Company streetcars used the line between Meriden and Middletown until 1931. A portion of the line in Meriden remained in use for freight until 1976.

====Bus====
Beginning in 1784, Meriden had a stop on the New Haven-Hartford Stage Coach on Route 5 near the intersection of East Main Street. Years later, the same stop served as the bus stop for Greyhound and Peter Pan buses. Meriden had four daily departures to/from Hartford/Boston, and four daily departures to/from New Haven/New York City daily from the 1970s through 2007, when intercity bus service ceased serving Meriden.

Meriden is linked to the Connecticut Transit System, Connecticut&#x27;s extensive public transit bus network. Three bus lines loop throughout the city of Meriden once per hour. The &quot;B&quot; bus route departs the Meriden railroad station for the southern terminus of Kohls Plaza, connecting for New Haven; the &quot;A&quot; bus route departs the rail station for the northern terminus of Meriden Square with connections to New Britain and Hartford; and the east/west &quot;C&quot; bus travels along East Main and West Main Streets, with a handful of departures to Middletown and Waterbury.

====Airports====
Meriden Markham Municipal Airport is the city-owned airport, located south of the city center on the border of South Meriden and Yalesville, and serves private and charter planes. Bradley International Airport (BDL) in Windsor Locks and Tweed New Haven Airport (HVN) in East Haven are the closest commercial airports to Meriden.

<text>Naugatuck ( ) is a consolidated borough and town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The town, part of the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region, had a population of 31,519 as of the 2020 Census.

The town spans both sides of the Naugatuck River just south of Waterbury and includes the communities of Union City on the east side of the river, Straitsville on the southeast (along Route 63), and Millville on the west (along Rubber Avenue).

== History ==
The town of Naugatuck was occupied by settlers as early as 1702. Samuel Hickox (1669–1713) is credited with being Naugatuck&#x27;s first settler. He established a fulling mill on Fulling Mill Brook in Naugatuck in 1709. The locality was called Judds Meadow until 1752, when it was renamed Salem Bridge.

In 1844, parts of Waterbury, Bethany, and Oxford incorporated to form the town of Naugatuck.

The industrial borough of Naugatuck established in 1893 and became coextensive with the town in 1895.

As the Industrial Revolution commenced, Naugatuck was transformed into a mill town like its neighbors in the Naugatuck River Valley.

Rubber was the chief manufactured product. Charles Goodyear worked at his brother&#x27;s rubber company, the Goodyear Metallic Rubber Shoe Company &amp; Downtown Naugatuck, until the company was consolidated into the United States Rubber Company. The United States Rubber Company (renamed Uniroyal Inc. in 1961) was founded in Naugatuck in 1892 as a consolidation of nine rubber companies, and maintained their corporate headquarters there until the 1980s. Their footwear division manufactured Keds sneakers in Naugatuck from 1917 until the 1980s. U.S. Rubber also produced Naugahyde in a Naugatuck factory, but it is no longer produced there.

The United States Rubber Co. formed the Naugatuck Chemical Company on June 1, 1904, due to an increase in the price of sulfuric acid, which was needed for the process then used for reclaiming old rubber. The company was soon in the forefront of the chemical industry in the United States. Naugatuck Chemical remained a subsidiary of the U.S. Rubber Co. until it gained independence as Uniroyal Chemical Co. They moved their operations to Middlebury, Connecticut in the 1970s.

The Risdon Manufacturing Company was established in Naugatuck around 1910 producing safety pins. Risdon became the manufacturer of packaging for cosmetics and sewing items such as pins, needles, snaps, and other accessories. It is now the Crown Risdon Co., headquartered in Watertown, Connecticut.

In the 1960s, Harold Barber founded H. Barber and Sons in the community. The company builds beach rakes for picking up debris and grooming beaches and claims to be the largest such business in the world.

Naugatuck was the home to Peter Paul Candy Manufacturing Company, the Hershey Foods division that produces Almond Joy and Mounds candy bars, until the Hershey Co. closed it in November 2007.

The normally peaceful Naugatuck River that flows through Naugatuck overflowed its banks on August 19, 1955, fed by over of rain from Hurricane Diane. The river cut a path of destruction that forever changed the face of Naugatuck.

Naugatuck High School has a storied football rivalry with the high school in Ansonia that is one of the longest in America. The two teams meet the morning of Thanksgiving Day, and the first meeting was in 1900. Ansonia is the long-term winner in the series. Naugatuck High School&#x27;s mascot is the greyhound, and its colors are garnet and grey.

<text>Orange is a town in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States. The town is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 14,280 at the 2020 census. The town is governed by a Board of Selectmen.

==History==
The Paugusset and Algonquian people previously inhabited the region that is now Orange. In 1639, Rev. Peter Prudden purchased the land from the Native Americans for six coats, ten blankets, one kettle, twelve hatchets, twelve hoes, two dozen knives and a dozen small mirrors. When originally settled by English colonists, Orange was the northern and eastern district of the now neighboring city of Milford; however, by 1822, the population of the area had grown to the point where residents desired to form their own separate community, thus forming the town of Orange.

The town is named after William III of England, who was Prince of Orange from birth. William is remembered for succeeding James II, deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. James II had been considered a despot in Connecticut; he had famously and unsuccessfully commissioned Edmund Andros to seize Connecticut&#x27;s Charter.

The town continued to grow throughout the 19th century. As early as 1848, a separation of Orange and West Haven was considered. It was not until 1921 that the two were officially separated by act of the Connecticut General Assembly and
the new city of West Haven was formed out of the southeastern portion of Orange. This left Orange a largely rural town, as the bulk of the urbanized population was ceded to West Haven. In the post-war years, however, Orange began suburbanizing at a rapid pace.

Early roads through the area included the Boston Post Road (now U.S. Route 1) and the Derby Turnpike (now Connecticut Route 34). The turnpike was originally an Indian path. A toll road through Orange, from New Haven to Derby, was built starting in 1800. The toll house was located in Orange; tolls ended in 1887. The New Haven and Derby Railroad ran through Orange starting in 1871, with a station in Orange. At its peak, there were eleven trains per day in each direction along with one freight train. The advent of a trolley from New Haven to Derby (starting in 1904 and running until 1937) hastened the end to rail service (in 1925). Later, the construction of the Wilbur Cross Parkway and Interstate 95 brought highways through the area.

Orange station is a planned stop on Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s New Haven Line. Construction has been on hold since late 2017.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 17.4 square miles (45.1 km), of which 17.2 square miles (44.5 km) is land and 0.2 square miles (0.6 km), or 1.38%, is water. It is bordered on the south by Milford, on the east by West Haven, on the north by New Haven, Woodbridge and Derby and on the west by the Housatonic River and Shelton. The town limits include Wooster Island in the Housatonic River. The Wepawaug, Indian and Oyster rivers flow through the town.

==Demographics==

==Economy==
Orange is the home of the North American headquarters of Pez candies. It is also the home of the headquarters of Avangrid and its subsidiaries Southern Connecticut Gas and The United Illuminating Company.

Tangoe, Inc., a provider of telecommunications management software, was formerly headquartered in Orange.
Orange was the home of the US headquarters of Saab-Scania from 1972 until 1992 when the company relocated to Norcross, Georgia. From 1973–2010, Hubbell, a manufacturer of electrical products, was headquartered in Orange. In 2013, the University of New Haven purchased the former Hubbell headquarters buildings to redevelop as a graduate school campus. Yale&#x27;s West Campus is located on the Orange-West Haven town line, on a 136-acre property that was formerly occupied by Bayer. In 2013, the Yale School of Nursing relocated to a building on the Yale West Campus that is mostly on the Orange side of the town border.

About three percent of the 17 square miles in the town is farmed. Field View Farm, one of the oldest businesses in the United States, has been operated by the Hine family since 1639. Orange was also formerly home to the Everett B. Clark Seed Company which eventually
joined forces with other local seed growers to form Asgrow, now a
division of Bayer.

The town has extensive retail development along the Boston Post Road corridor.

During the Cold War, Orange was a location for the permanent deployment of Nike missiles for the defense of Greater New Haven. The former site of the Nike missiles has since (from the late 1950s onward) been the home of the 103rd Air Control and Warning Squadron, later to become the 103rd Tactical Control Squadron and as it remains today the 103rd Air Control Squadron, a part of the Connecticut Air National Guard.

==Arts and culture==
===Events===
Orange exhibits its rural roots at the annual Orange Country Fair. This event originally ran from 1898 to 1912 and was revived in 1975. It has continued since then featuring horse, oxen and tractor pulls as well as exhibits of animals, flowers, fruits, vegetables and baked goods. In early August, the town also promotes the Orange Volunteer Fireman&#x27;s Carnival, which raises funds to support the volunteer fire department. Both events are held at the fairgrounds at High Plains Community Center near the center of town.

Orange was the site of one of the earliest computer camps, held at the local Amity Jr. High School in 1977.

In the early nineteenth century, settlers from Orange founded Orange, Ohio, then part of Connecticut&#x27;s Western Reserve.

On March 15–17, 2009, Orange hosted the 2009 ConnJam, a Boy Scout event in which over 3,000 Boy Scouts from the Connecticut Yankee Council attended events and camped over the weekend.

===On the National Register of Historic Places===

* Col. Asa Platt House – 2 Tyler City Road (added 2002). Federal style. Built in 1810, it is thought to have been built by David Hoadley, who built the Orange Congregational Church. The nomination to the register, by Jan Cunningham, refers to &quot;the elegant refinement of the interior&quot;, repeated elliptical forms in &quot;the sunbursts of the mantelpieces; in the recessed panels below the parlor windows; in the capitals of the arches; and, in a wholly unexpected manner, in the high relief of the egg form that embellishes the simple mantel frieze in a second-floor chamber.&quot;
* Henry F. Miller House – 30 Derby Ave. (added May 25, 2001). This international style house was completed in 1949 and featured at the time in the &quot;New Haven Register&quot; as &quot;The House of Tomorrow&quot;.
* Orange Center Historic District – Roughly Orange Center Road from Orange Cemetery to Nan Drive (added August 10, 1989). The district was originally established by the town January 13, 1978. The Orange Congregational Church, designed by David Hoadley and built in 1810 on the town green, is a centerpiece of the district. This Federal style church features a Palladian window, domed belfry and a painted black oval &quot;window&quot; on the front tower. The district also includes the Stone-Otis House (Federal with Greek revival portico), built circa 1830 (now a museum) and The Academy, a schoolhouse built in 1878 with Stick style elements, including an elaborate gable screen, also now a museum.
* William Andrew House (also known as Bryan-Andrew House) – 131 Old Tavern Road (added 2002). Built about 1750 for the Bryan family, early settlers in North Milford. This area was known as &quot;Bryan&#x27;s Farms&quot;. The house includes a finely detailed front cornice, feather-edged sheathing and hand-split lath laboriously installed without nails. The house later served as housing for dairy farm employees and was ultimately bought by the Town of Orange in 2000 to be restored for use as a museum.

<text>Waterbury is a city in the U.S. state of Connecticut. Waterbury had a population of 114,403 as of the 2020 Census. The city is southwest of Hartford and northeast of New York City. Waterbury is the largest city in the Naugatuck Valley Planning Region and second-largest city in New Haven County.

Throughout the first half of the 20th century, Waterbury had large industrial interests and was the leading center in the United States for the manufacture of brassware (including castings and finishings), as reflected in the nickname the &quot;Brass City&quot; and the city&#x27;s motto &quot;Quid Aere Perennius?&quot; (&quot;What Is More Lasting Than Brass?&quot;). It was also noted for the manufacture of watches and clocks (Timex).

The city is alongside Interstate 84 (Yankee Expressway) and Route 8 and has a Metro-North railroad station with connections to Grand Central Terminal. Waterbury is also home to Post University and the regional campuses of the University of Connecticut, University of Bridgeport, Western Connecticut State University as well as Naugatuck Valley Community College.

==History==
The land was originally inhabited by the Algonquin bands. According to Samuel Orcutt&#x27;s history, some Puritan residents of nearby Farmington &quot;found it expedient to purchase the same lands from different tribes, without attempting to decide between their rival claims.&quot; The original settlement of Waterbury in 1674 was in the area now known as the Town Plot section. In 1675, the turbulence of King Philip&#x27;s War caused the new settlement to be vacated until the resumption of peace in 1677. A new permanent location was found across the river to the east along the Mad River. The original Native American inhabitants called the area &quot;Matetacoke&quot; meaning &quot;the interval lands.&quot; Thus, the settlement&#x27;s name was Anglicised to &quot;Mattatuck&quot; in 1673. When the settlement was admitted as the 28th town in the Connecticut Colony in 1686, the name was changed to Waterbury in reference to the numerous streams that emptied into the Naugatuck River from the hills on either side of the valley. At that time, it included all or parts of what later became the towns of Watertown, Plymouth, Wolcott, Prospect, Naugatuck, Thomaston, and Middlebury.

Growth was slow during Waterbury&#x27;s first hundred years, the lack of arable land due to the constant flooding of the Naugatuck River in particular, discouraged many potential settlers. Furthermore, the residents suffered through a great flood in 1691 and an outbreak of disease in 1712. After a century, Waterbury&#x27;s population numbered just 5,000.

Waterbury emerged as an early American industrial power in the early 19th century when the city began to manufacture brass, harnessing the waters of the Mad River and Naugatuck River to power the early factories. The new brass industry attracted many immigrant laborers from all over the world, leading to an influx of diverse nationalities. Waterbury was incorporated as a city in 1853 and, as the &quot;Brass Capital of the World&quot;, it gained a reputation for the quality and durability of its goods. Brass and copper supplied by Waterbury were used in Nevada&#x27;s Boulder Dam among myriad applications across the United States.

A famous Waterbury product of the late-19th century was Robert H. Ingersoll&#x27;s one-dollar pocket watch, five million of which were sold. After this, the clock industry became as important as Waterbury&#x27;s brass industry. Evidence of these industries can still be seen in Waterbury, as numerous clocktowers and old brass factories have become landmarks of the city.

Waterbury produced silverware starting in 1858 by Rogers &amp; Brother, and in 1886 by Rogers &amp; Hamilton. In 1893, Rogers &amp; Brother exhibited wares at the World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. In 1898, both companies became part of the International Silver Company, headquartered in nearby Meriden. Production continued at the R&amp;B site until 1938. Designs of the two companies are in the collections of the Mattatuck Museum in Waterbury, the Brooklyn Museum in New York, the Yale University Art Gallery in New Haven, and in many historical societies and museums across the United States.

In June 1920, labor unrest occurred, with striking workers fighting with police on the street. Over 30 were arrested, mostly Lithuanians, Russians, Poles, and Italians. The strikers numbered some 15,000, with most being employed at Scovill, Chase Rolling Mill, and Chase Metal Works. One striker was shot to death by police.

At its peak during World War II, 10,000 people worked at the Scovill Manufacturing Co, later sold to Century Brass. The city&#x27;s metal manufacturing mills (Scovill Manufacturing, Anaconda American Brass, and Chase Brass &amp; Copper were the largest) occupied more than 2 million square feet (180,000 m2) and more than 90 buildings.

On May 24, 1962, the north side of the city was devastated by a high-end F3 tornado that caused widespread damage, destroyed numerous neighborhoods, and left one dead and 50 injured. Damage from the storm was estimated to be at least $5 million.

Waterbury has a large Italian-American population with 21.46% of its residents claiming Italian heritage. The Italian influence is especially strong in the Town Plot, Brooklyn, and North End neighborhoods. Additionally, the city is home to thriving Albanian, Cape Verdean, Brazilian, Portuguese, and Lithuanian communities. Waterbury also has a large Irish community, especially in the Washington Hill section which is home to the city&#x27;s annual St. Patrick Day&#x27;s Parade, which, oddly enough, is rarely held on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day itself. At the beginning of the 21st century, Waterbury had a growing Orthodox Jewish population. Waterbury had a significant Jewish population beginning in the late 1800s, initially as a result of German immigration. The first synagogue in Waterbury opened in 1872. In the early 20th century, almost 9,000 Jews immigrated from Eastern Europe, with many fleeing persecution. The Orthodox Jewish community has experienced a renaissance since 2000 due to efforts by educators and developers to create an affordable alternative to the high cost of living in established Orthodox communities in New York and New Jersey. This renaissance began with the founding of the Yeshiva K&#x27;tana of Waterbury in 2000; as of 2014, this full-service elementary and middle school has nearly 400 students. Other educational institutions are the Yeshiva Gedolah of Waterbury, which includes a &quot;mesivta&quot; high school and &quot;beit medrash&quot; (undergraduate) program for approximately 230 students, a Bais Yaakov school for girls, and a &quot;kolel&quot;.

Waterbury was also rated as one of the &quot;Worst Places for Businesses and Careers in America&quot; by &quot;Forbes Magazine&quot; in April 2008.

==Government==

Waterbury has about 52,000 registered voters, of whom about 24,000 are Democrats. There are about 7,800 registered Republicans and the balance are largely unaffiliated, with a smattering belonging to minor parties.

John S. Monagan, who was a prolific author in addition to his political responsibilities, served as Waterbury&#x27;s mayor from 1943 to 1948. He also served as its district&#x27;s congressional representative from 1959 to 1973. George Harlamon, a member of the Waterbury Hall of Fame, was the city&#x27;s 40th mayor. He served from 1969 to 1970 during a period of racial tension. The city is known for its hard-nosed political culture compared locally to Cook County, Illinois, close elections, and a number of scandals.

Waterbury&#x27;s scandalous past dates back to 1940, when Mayor T. Frank Hayes and 22 others were convicted of conspiracy to defraud the City of Waterbury. Hayes received a 10–15 year sentence and served six years. Ironically, the massive corruption scheme was exposed with the help of then comptroller Sherwood Rowland, grandfather of Gov. John G. Rowland, who was convicted on corruption charges in 2004. What appeared to have been a defeat for Hayes was not really a victory for Pape, and the stage was set for further corruption in Waterbury in the second half of the 20th century. Waterbury was in serious financial straits due to years of mismanagement, resulting in the city&#x27;s finances being taken over by the State of Connecticut. The State Oversight Board oversaw city business for several years and have since left following consecutive years of balanced budgets. In 1992 former Mayor Joseph Santopietro was sentenced to nine years in prison following a public corruption conviction. The successors to Philip Giordano, former acting mayor Sam Caligiuri (2001) and former mayor Michael Jarjura (2001–2011) managed the city without major controversy since 2001. Democrat Neil O&#x27;Leary was elected the 46th Mayor of Waterbury on November 9, 2011.

In 1939, Pape backed an attempt to install council-manager government and single-transferable-vote elections. The local Republican Party and Connecticut General Assembly also supported this measure. New York Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia helped campaign for its passage, having backed similar reforms in his own city in 1936.

A number of presidential candidates have campaigned in Waterbury due to its pivotal role in statewide elections. The most famous was the election eve visit on the Green by John F. Kennedy in 1960. Forty thousand people waited until 3am on the Green to greet Kennedy on Sunday, November 6, 1960. Sen. Kennedy spoke to them from the balcony of the Roger Smith Hotel (now called the Elton). Pierre Salinger later said it was the greatest night of the campaign. In September 1984 Ronald Reagan held a huge noontime election rally at the same location. In July 2006 former president Bill Clinton made a campaign appearance at the Palace Theatre for Senator Joe Lieberman during his campaign for re-election to the U.S. Senate. Shortly after the Democratic primary, Tom Swan, campaign manager for Lieberman&#x27;s opponent Ned Lamont, described Waterbury as a place where &quot;the forces of slime meet the forces of evil,&quot; after a large majority of the town&#x27;s voters backed Lieberman. Swan claimed he was referring to former mayor Philip A. Giordano and former governor John G. Rowland.

Governor John G. Rowland served ten months in a federal prison until February 10, 2006. He was released from federal prison with the stipulation that he serve four months house arrest with an electronic ankle bracelet monitor until June 2006.

In January 2008 Waterbury Mayor Michael Jarjura announced that he would hire Rowland as an economic development advisor for the city. Rowland began work in February that year receiving an annual salary of $95,000 as the city&#x27;s economic development coordinator funded in conjunction with the Greater Waterbury Chamber of Commerce.

In 2011, the Board of Aldermen voted to eliminate funding the city&#x27;s portion of his salary and in November 2011 Rowland stated he would give up his position when his contract expired thus ending his quasi-city employment.

Later that year, following his victory over then Mayor Jarjura, new mayor Neil O&#x27;Leary created the position of Economic Development Director as part of his new administration, removing the duties from the Chamber of Commerce and bringing them directly into City Hall, making Economic Development a cornerstone of his administration. Ron Pugliese was hired as the first director to hold the position.

===Transportation===

Commuting in the Greater Waterbury area consists of multiple public transportation options. CT Transit through Northeast Transportation Company, operates a significant number of city buses running from Waterbury&#x27;s city center at Exchange Place to various neighborhoods in the city. In 2014 the Hartford-New Britain Busway was opened, a local bus runs to Waterbury, Cheshire, Southington and New Britain an express bus to run between Waterbury and Hartford.

Metro-North Railroad runs commuter trains multiple times a day between the Waterbury station and Bridgeport, with connections to Grand Central Terminal in New York City. Waterbury&#x27;s Union Station, built in 1909 for the New York, New Haven and Hartford Railroad, is now closed for use as a railway station and part of the building is now the headquarters of the &quot;Republican-American&quot; newspaper. Passengers traveling to and from Waterbury board and alight on a concrete platform adjacent to the old station. There are no ticket agents at Waterbury, which is currently the end of the line for the Waterbury Branch.

The two main highways that run through the heart of the city are I-84 (Yankee Expressway) and Route 8. In the downtown area, I-84 and Route 8 are located on the elevated William W. Deady Bridge, known locally as the &quot;MixMaster&quot; with eastbound traffic on the upper deck and westbound traffic on the lower deck. The interchange is ranked as one of the most heavily congested traffic areas in the New York/Connecticut region. Waterbury–Oxford Airport is the primary airport serving the city. The smaller Waterbury Airport is about from the city&#x27;s central business district. Bradley International Airport (BDL) in Windsor Locks and Tweed New Haven Airport (HVN) in East Haven are the closest commercial airports to Waterbury.

===Police department===
The Waterbury Police Department was founded in 1853. The department has a police academy.

<text>West Haven is a city in New Haven County, Connecticut, United States, located on the coast of Long Island Sound. The city is part of the South Central Connecticut Planning Region. At the 2020 census, the population of the city was 55,584.

==History==
Settled in 1648, West Haven (then known as West Farms) was a part of the original New Haven Colony. In 1719, it became the separate parish of West Haven, but was still officially a part of New Haven until 1822.

During the American Revolution, West Haven was the frequent launch and arrival point for raiding parties on both sides of the war. On July 5, 1779, the British invaded New Haven Harbor and came ashore in West Haven and East Haven. Thomas Painter, a teenaged militiaman watching for the approaching British ships while standing atop Savin Rock, is depicted on the city seal. The main commercial street, Campbell Avenue, is named for British Adjutant William Campbell, at the time an ensign in the Third Guards, who rescued the Reverend Noah Williston, the local Congregational minister and outspoken revolutionary, from being bayoneted by British and Hessian troopers, after he broke his leg trying to escape his captors. Campbell then ordered the soldiers to help the minister back to the parsonage and had the regimental surgeon set his leg. Campbell is also credited with keeping the troops in reasonably good order during their march through the village and reportedly had two soldiers arrested after a local woman accused them of stealing her jewelry. Campbell was killed hours later atop Allingtown Hill on his way to New Haven by a local farmer-turned defender. Campbell is buried in the Allingtown section of town off Prudden Street. Patriot victims of the invasion are buried in the Christ Church and First Society Cemetery. A historical headstone marks Campbell&#x27;s approximate gravesite and is maintained by the West Haven Historical Society.

While West Haven again attempted to incorporate as its own town in 1784, that attempt failed, primarily due to the protests of neighboring Milford, which opposed North Milford becoming part of the new town. West Haven and North Milford tried again in 1786 and 1787 with the same result. The two finally joined to become Orange (incorporated as a town in 1822). In 1921, West Haven split from Orange to become a separate town. It was incorporated as a city in 1961 and is known as &quot;Connecticut&#x27;s Youngest City&quot;, although it is also one of the state&#x27;s oldest settlements.

The Savin Rock section of West Haven was the site of the Savin Rock Amusement Park, which began in the late 19th century as a regionally renowned seaside resort. It evolved into a general amusement park in the 20th century and eventually closed in the 1960s. The park ran along the west side of the New Haven Harbor beachfront.

What followed was a 40 year struggle to stop Savin Rock&#x27;s Redevelopment—approved by voters in 1963 and officially starting in 1966. It involved multiple referendums, petition drives, court cases, and Connecticut Supreme Court decisions affecting the 40 acre area. Opposition began about 1971 soon after old Savin Rock had been torn down and the first project built, but ballooned in 1973 when Save Our Shore (SOS) led a referendum to stop &quot;the Great Wall of China&quot;, an 800 foot 12 story apartment, proposed for a 10 acre parcel, blocking the shore view. A 1974 referendum to stop all development was organized by IMPACT (successor to SOS), but was overturned by the Supreme Court in 1978. This led to a struggle for a Compromise Plan, initiated by Mayor Robert Johnson, and brought to completion by action of the Concerned Citizens for Bradley Point (1979), which petitioned the final holdout to the Plan, to which the Supreme Court had required all developers to agree for any significant change. The Compromise was signed by all in May 1979, but IMPACT continued to oppose it thru 1980. Thereafter, a committee sought public input and federal money, and in July 1984, the 20 acre Bradley Point Veterans Memorial Park opened. In 1987 and 1989, the city bought development rights of all the remaining parcels, part of which became the Old Grove Park and part included a former restaurant that became the Savin Rock Conference Center. In 1991, the Land Trust of West Haven, Inc. was founded, but it was not until 2007 that a Conservation Easement was signed, preserving all but the Conference Center, as open space forever—beautiful parks, with walks and bike path, along Connecticut&#x27;s longest public shoreline. Several restaurants remain as last reminders of the area&#x27;s commercial past.

West Haven has a mayor-council form of government. Nancy R. Rossi, the city&#x27;s twelfth mayor, was elected in 2017. She is West Haven&#x27;s first female mayor. There are two independent fire districts served by the First Fire Taxation (Center) and West Shore. The Allingtown Fire District was relatively recently subsumed by the City who&#x27;s now responsible for all of its pension-related obligations going forward. Residents expect efforts will be made to consolidate the remaining two fire districts based, in large part, on the recommendation of the State&#x27;s Municipal Accountability Review Board (MARB) who is currently providing financial support and guidance to the City. As it currently stands, each of the remaining independent Fire Districts levy its own tax rate.

In 1986, West Haven observed the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution. During the year-long celebrations, the mayor and council passed numerous resolutions to encourage community involvement, including naming the official ship of West Haven—the U.S. Navy destroyer USS &quot;Edson&quot; (DD-946)—and the city&#x27;s official flower, the daylily. Public schools included curriculum on the Constitution from K–12, and school children were released from class to participate in a Constitution Day parade up Campbell Avenue.

In June 2014, the &quot;Where Angels Play&quot; playground opened next to Sea Bluff Beach in West Haven. The playground was built in honor of Charlotte Bacon, a victim of the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting. The playground is pink for Charlotte&#x27;s favorite color and includes some of her drawings.

<text>Norwich ( ) (also called &quot;The Rose of New England&quot;) is a city in New London County, Connecticut, United States. The Yantic, Shetucket, and Quinebaug Rivers flow into the city and form its harbor, from which the Thames River flows south to Long Island Sound. The city is part of the Southeastern Connecticut Planning Region. The population was 40,125 at the 2020 United States Census.

==History==
The town of Norwich was founded in 1659, on the site of what is now the neighborhood of Norwichtown, by settlers from Saybrook Colony led by Major John Mason, James Fitch, and Lieutenant Francis Griswold. They purchased the land &quot;nine miles square&quot; that became Norwich from Mohegan Sachem Uncas. One of the co-founders of Norwich was Thomas Leffingwell, who rescued Uncas when surrounded by his Narragansett tribesmen, and whose son established the Leffingwell Inn. In 1668, a wharf was established at Yantic Cove. Settlement was primarily in the area around the Norwichtown Green. The 69 founding families soon divided up the land in the Norwichtown vicinity for farms and businesses. 

Until 1786, the town of Norwich encompassed what became known as the &quot;Nine Mile Square&quot;. Eight Religious Societies were created over the course of the 18th century and in 1786 these were mostly split into new towns, while the Long Society was merged into Preston, Connecticut.

By 1694, the public landing built at the head of the Thames River allowed ships to unload goods at the harbor; the harbor area is known as the Chelsea neighborhood. The distance from the port to Norwichtown was served by the East and West Roads, which became Broadway and Washington Street. The original center of the town was a neighborhood now called Norwichtown, an inland location chosen to be the center of a primarily agricultural community. By the late 18th century, shipping at the harbor became far more important than farming, especially when industrial mills began manufacturing on the three tributary rivers. By the early 19th century, the center of Norwich had effectively moved to the Chelsea neighborhood. The official buildings of the city, such as the city hall, courts, and post office, and all the large 19th-century urban blocks, were located in the harbor area. The former center is now called Norwichtown to distinguish it from the current city.

Norwich merchants were shipping goods directly from England, but the Stamp Act 1765 forced Norwich to become more self-sufficient. Large mills and factories sprang up at the falls on the rivers which traverse the town, the largest of which was the Ponemah Mill in the Taftville neighborhood. The ship captains of Norwich and New London were skillful at avoiding Imperial taxation during peacetime and were later just as successful eluding warships during the American Revolution. Norwich supported the cause for independence by supplying soldiers, ships, and munitions, and it was also a center of activity for the Sons of Liberty.

The Oxford English Dictionary attests the first recorded use of the word &quot;Hello&quot; to &quot;The Norwich Courier&quot; on October 18, 1826. Regular steamship service between New York and Boston helped Norwich to prosper as a shipping center through the early part of the 19th century. During the Civil War, Norwich once again rallied and saw the growth of its textile, armaments, and specialty item manufacturing. This was also spurred by the building of the Norwich and Worcester Railroad in 1832–1837, bringing goods and people in and out of Norwich.
By the 1870s, the Springfield and New London Railroad was also running trains through Norwich.

In 1892, the city&#x27;s first electric trolleys started service to the area and to some cities, including New London, Willimantic, Putnam, and Westerly, Rhode Island. The town and city of Norwich were consolidated in 1952.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and (3.87%) is water.

==Arts and culture==
The Slater Memorial Museum, located on the campus of the Norwich Free Academy, is named for John Fox Slater (1815−1884), corporator of The Norwich Free Academy for twenty years. The museum has grown to include the &quot;Art of Five Continents&quot;—North and South America, Europe, Asia, and Africa. Of particular interest are the Vanderpoel Collection of Asian Art, the Paul Zimmerman Collection of African and Oceanic Art, and a collection of 19th-century American paintings. Another wing of the museum displays souvenirs from the Slater family&#x27;s circumnavigation of the globe.

==Sports==
The AA Eastern League Connecticut Defenders, previously the Norwich Navigators, were a farm team of the San Francisco Giants and they played at Senator Thomas J. Dodd Memorial Stadium from both&#x27;s inception in 1995 until the team announced its move to Richmond, Virginia for the 2010 season, where they are now known as the Richmond Flying Squirrels. However, starting in 2010, Dodd Stadium became the home to the Connecticut Tigers (formerly the Oneonta Tigers, now named Norwich Sea Unicorns) in the Class-A short-season New York–Penn League. The ESPN mini-series &quot;The Bronx Is Burning&quot; was filmed at Dodd Stadium.

==Parks and recreation==
===Mohegan Park===


This forested area is Norwich&#x27;s largest park. The park&#x27;s property contains numerous hiking and biking trails, picnic tables, grills, pavilions for rent, a beach, basketball courts, a Mohegan monument, fountain and playgrounds. The Rose Garden at the entrance on Judd Road contains over a hundred varieties of roses and is a popular site for weddings. Many of the hiking trails are used by the Norwich Free Academy cross country team for practices, and in 2006 the team volunteered to improve the condition of trails. 5K &quot;fun runs&quot; are held in the park on Thursdays during the summer. As of 2009, the running course has been redesigned to incorporate much of the trails.

The Park Center contains Spaulding Pond, the square, fountain, and Mohegan monument, both playgrounds and a dog pound run by the Norwich Police Department. The Park Center has declined somewhat. The zoo, reptile house, and concession stand have been closed for over a decade. However, much has been done to improve the appearance of the remaining park.

Spaulding Pond, the main body of water in Mohegan Park, is held back by an earthworks dam, across which is a path bordered by pergolas and flowering plants. On March 6, 1963, long-term saturation of the over-100-year-old earthen content, along with unchecked shrub and tree growth, severely weakened the structural content of the dam and caused the waters of Spaulding Pond to burst forth into the city, causing the Great Flood of Norwich, elegantly chronicled in the 2013 book &quot;A Swift and Deadly Maelstrom; The Great Norwich Flood of 1963&quot;. The break and subsequent flood flow pulverized houses with its large ice content, over-ran streets and cars while destroying the eastern half of the Turner-Stanton Mill, situated in the flood&#x27;s direct path on Centennial Square. It was there that the building collapsed, claiming the lives of six of the seven total who would die that night while causing over six million dollars in damage. Mohegan Park also contains another, smaller pond, called The Skating Pond which is southeast of the main pond. This pond, which had always been designed as an overflow spillway for Spaulding Pond and, when frozen in the winter provided a wonderful ice skating area for the local youth, thus its sobriquet, was re-designed as part of Norwich&#x27;s long-term flood plan in 1968 and currently still serves as a surge overflow volume for the upgraded Spaulding Pond Dam, although it is no longer open for public use.

===Ice rink===
The Norwich Municipal Ice Rink has a 200&#x27; × 85&#x27; National Hockey League regulation ice surface, four large locker rooms and other amenities. Established in 1995, the Rose City Warriors are Norwich&#x27;s Senior Women&#x27;s Ice Hockey Team and a number of local high school ice hockey teams call the Rink home as well.

==Government==
The city elects a Mayor, who presides over the City Council, which includes six other members, all elected at large. The Mayor serves a maximum of two four-year terms; the council members serve two-year terms. The council appoints the Town and City Clerk, a City Manager who acts as chief executive officer of the city government, the city Planning Commission, and Zoning Board of Appeals.

==Education==
Elementary and middle school residents are zoned to Norwich Public Schools. The middle schools of Norwich are Teachers&#x27; Memorial Global Studies Middle School and Kelly STEAM Magnet Middle School. Norwich is also home to the Integrated Day Charter School, an alternative to the area of public schools. Despite Norwich Public Schools serving the district, since 2007 NPS has not operated a high school after Norwich High School was closed and repurposed.

The Norwich Free Academy is the primary high school for students living in Norwich and several surrounding towns, including Bozrah, Canterbury, Franklin, Lisbon, Preston, Sprague, and Voluntown. The Norwich Free Academy was incorporated in 1855 by an act of the Connecticut Legislature, and operates as a privately endowed independent school governed by its Board of Trustees and funded by private, municipal, and state sources. In 2006, Sidney Frank donated $12 million to the Norwich Free Academy which resulted in the campus&#x27;s newest building being named after him: the Sidney E. Frank Center for Visual and Performing Arts.

Norwich Technical High School, a Connecticut Technical High School System School, also serves the area. This school is a public option to those within the Norwich area, and many other towns surrounding Norwich. To those within the Norwich area, transportation is provided by Norwich Public Schools via the same buses that serve Norwich Free Academy in the morning, and in the afternoon students are transported to Norwich Free Academy to use their buses to return home.

Three Rivers Community College also serves the region.

==Infrastructure==
===Transportation===

Local public transportation in Norwich is provided by Southeast Area Transit (SEAT). The main bus hub, the Norwich Transportation Center, is located on Holly Hock Island next to the downtown area. This station is also served by the Windham Region Transit District with service to and from Willimantic, CT. Norwich is also served by the Northeastern Connecticut Transit District with service to and from Putnam, CT.

Historically, the city held a railroad stop at its downtown station, which is now in use as an office for The Norwich Bulletin. In the past, the city was served by the Norwich and Worcester Railroad, which today is still operated as a freight railroad, the Providence and Worcester Railroad.

The nearest passenger rail station to Norwich is New London Union Station in New London, CT. The nearest options for air travel are Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, CT, and Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport in Providence, RI. Both of which are located 55–65 minutes away by vehicle. Up until the mid 2000s, there was a closer airport with commercial air service, Groton-New London Airport.

In recent years, there have been discussions and proposals involving restoring passenger rail service to Norwich along the New England Central Railroad, providing service from New London, CT, through Norwich up to Brattleboro, VT. The most recent and ongoing proposal is the Central Corridor Rail Line.

<doc id="256986" wikidata="Q257448" url="?curid=256986" title="Sulpicia">
<text>Sulpicia is believed to be the author, in the first century BCE, of six short poems (some 40 lines in all) written in Latin which were published as part of the corpus of Albius Tibullus&#x27;s poetry (poems 3.13-18). She is one of the few female poets of ancient Rome whose work survives. 

==Life==
Sulpicia has been tentatively identified as the granddaughter of Cicero&#x27;s friend Servius Sulpicius Rufus, whose son of the same name married Valeria, sister of Marcus Valerius Messalla Corvinus, an important patron of literature who also launched the career of Ovid. If this is correct, Sulpicia&#x27;s family were well-off citizens with connections to Emperor Augustus, since her uncle Messalla (consul in 31 BC) served as a commander for Augustus.

==Poetry==
 Sulpicia&#x27;s surviving work consists of six short elegiac poems (3.13–18), which have been preserved as part of a collection of poetry, book 3 of the &quot;Corpus Tibullianum&quot;, initially attributed to Tibullus. The poems are addressed to Cerinthus. 

Cerinthus was most likely a pseudonym, in the style of the day (like Catullus&#x27;s Lesbia and Propertius&#x27;s Cynthia). Cerinthus has sometimes been thought to refer to the Cornutus addressed by Tibullus in two of his &quot;Elegies,&quot; probably an aristocratic Caecilius Cornutus. The similarity in consonants and the resemblance between the Greek &quot;keras&quot; (&quot;horn&quot;) and Latin &quot;cornu&quot; (also &quot;horn&quot;) are among arguments cited in favour of this identification. Recent criticism, however, has tended away from attempting to identify Cerinthus with an historical figure in favour of noting the literary implications of the pseudonym.

Some critics, such as Thomas Hubbard, Thomas Habinek, and Niklas Holzberg have challenged the view that the Sulpicia poems were authored by a woman. In an overview of Sulpician criticism, Alison Keith described the logic of Hubbard&#x27;s article as &quot;tortuous&quot; and also highlights problems in Holzberg and Habinek&#x27;s attempts to efface female authorship. In contrast, Judith P. Hallett argues for increasing the numbers of poems attributed to Sulpicia to include poems 8-12 from the &quot;Corpus Tibullianum,&quot; which had previously been attributed to an &quot;amicus Sulpiciae&quot; (friend of Sulpicia). Laurel Fulkerson, in her 2017 commentary on the , presents arguments on both sides of the debate and concludes that, while the question cannot be answered based on the existing evidence, “much is gained, and little lost, in treating the poetry of Sulpicia as an authentically recovered female voice from antiquity”. Another recent commentator, Robert Maltby, although not ruling out that the poems may have been written by a woman, believes that they date to a much later era and cannot be attributed to the niece of Messalla.

While academics traditionally regarded Sulpicia as an amateur author, this view was challenged by Santirocco in an article published in 1979, and subsequently the literary merit of this collection of poems has been more fully explored.

==The poems==
The six poems of Sulpicia are all very short: 10, 8, 4, 6, 6, and 6 lines respectively. Nonetheless they tell the complete story of a love-affair with all the usual incidents: falling in love, temporary separation, the unfaithfulness of one partner, the illness of the other, and the reassertion of love. As Maltby (2021) points out, there is a neat ring-structure to the series: &quot;The regret at hiding her passion in the concluding poem 18 echoes her willingness finally to reveal her love in the introductory 13&quot;.

The poems appear in the as poems 3.13 to 3.18. They are preceded in the by five poems known as the Garland of Sulpicia, which concern the same relationship between Sulpicia and Cerinthus.

===Poem 1===
Sulpicia expresses her delight that love has come at last () and Venus has granted her prayer. She is happy to be able to make her love public rather than keep quiet about it out of modesty. 

===Poem 2===
Sulpicia complains about a birthday when her uncle Messalla is planning to take her to the country, and she will have to spend the day sadly without Cerinthus. She tells Messalla that she will go but she will leave her mind and heart behind.

===Poem 3===
Sulpicia informs her lover that the unwelcome trip has been cancelled. She hopes that they can all celebrate the birthday together, an unexpected treat.

===Poem 4===
Sulpicia sarcastically thanks her lover for being so confident of her love as to have an affair with a whore or &quot;wool-basket carrying maid&quot; in preference to &quot;Servius&#x27;s daughter Sulpicia&quot; She tells him that her family are anxious for her, and are very pained to see her fall for a person of low birth.

===Poem 5===
Sulpicia asks Cerinthus if he cares for her at all, when she is ill with a fever. She says that if her lover is so indifferent to her health, she would prefer not to recover.

===Poem 6===
Calling him &quot;my light&quot; (), Sulpicia tells her lover that she has never done anything so foolish as she did the previous night when she refused to sleep with him for fear of making her love to him too obvious.

<text>Winslow is a town and census-designated place in Kennebec County, Maine, United States, along the Kennebec River across from Waterville. The population was 7,948 at the 2020 census.

==History==

Winslow was originally an Indian settlement named Taconock. During King William&#x27;s War, Major Benjamin Church led his third expedition east from Boston in 1692. During this expedition he and 450 troops raided the native villages at both Penobscot (Castine, Maine) and present-day Winslow.

Winslow was then settled by colonists from Plymouth Colony. The area was covered by the land patent given by the English Crown to Pilgrim governor William Bradford and his associates. The earliest settlers had such Old Colony and Pilgrim names as Winslow, Bradford, Warren, and Otis. Descendants of those early settlers can still be found in the town.

In 1754, Fort Halifax was built by order of the Massachusetts General Court on the peninsula at the confluence of the Sebasticook and Kennebec rivers. A settlement subsequently sprang up under its protection, and was named in honor of General John Winslow, of Marshfield, Massachusetts, who had overseen the fort&#x27;s construction. General Winslow was a descendant of Edward Winslow, a Pilgrim governor of Plymouth Colony who arrived on the Mayflower and founded the town of Marshfield. General Winslow lived in the mansion built in 1699 by his father, Isaac Winslow. The historic Winslow House still stands today in Marshfield and is on the National Register of Historic Places.

The Sebasticook and Kennebec rivers provided major early routes to transport food, goods, and more settlers. Benedict Arnold followed the Kennebec River north in 1775, stopping at Fort Halifax in Winslow on his ill-fated attempt to invade Canada. The Fort Halifax blockhouse, the nation&#x27;s oldest wooden structure of its type, was rebuilt after the original was swept down the Kennebec River by raging flood waters on April 1, 1987.

Thousands of Irish and French Canadian immigrants used the Old Canada Road (now a scenic byway) section of U.S. Route 201 during the 19th century to find seasonal or project employment, and later made the Kennebec River Valley region their home. Early Winslow settlers used water power for industrial development. Modern Winslow developed around the Hollingsworth &amp; Whitney Company paper mill, located along the Kennebec River. The mill was later purchased by the Scott Paper Company, whose 1995 merger with Kimberly-Clark led to the factory&#x27;s closure in 1997. Winslow&#x27;s industrial decline started in the 1980s, although some small light industry still exists, and new businesses continue to move into the town. Despite this, the service sector remains limited. Today, Winslow is a bedroom community for some middle- and upper-middle-class families who work in nearby Waterville and Augusta.

Scenes from the 2005 miniseries &quot;Empire Falls&quot;, starring Paul Newman, Ed Harris, and Helen Hunt, and based on the 2001 book &quot;Empire Falls&quot; by Richard Russo, were shot in Winslow. The town was home to the state&#x27;s largest July 4 fireworks display until it moved to Clinton, Maine in 2016.

<text>William Young Sellar FRSE LLD (22 February 1825 – 12 October 1890) was a Scottish classical scholar.

==Life==

Sellar was born at Morvich in Sutherland the son of Patrick Sellar of Westfield, Morayshire and his wife Anne Craig of barmuckity, Moray. He was educated at the Edinburgh Academy 1832 to 1839 (dux in his final year) and afterwards studied classics at the University of Glasgow. He entered Balliol College, Oxford, as a Snell Exhibitioner. Graduating with a first-class in classics, he was elected fellow of Oriel, and, after holding assistant professorships at Durham, Glasgow and St Andrews, was appointed professor of Greek at St Andrews (1859). In 1863 he was elected professor of humanity in Edinburgh University, and occupied that chair until his death.

In Edinburgh he lived at 15 Buckingham Terrace in the West End, near Dean Bridge.

Sellar was one of the most brilliant of 19th century classical scholars, and was remarkably successful in his endeavours to reproduce the spirit rather than the letter of Roman literature.

In 1864 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh his proposer being Alexander Campbell Fraser. He was also awarded honorary doctorates (LLD) from both St Andrews University and the University of Dublin.

He died at Kenbank, St John&#x27;s Town of Dalry in Kirkcudbrightshire on 12 October 1890.

==Family==

In 1851 he married Eleanor Dennistoun, daughter of Alexander Dennistoun. They had at least five children. Eleanor described her husband in a chapter of &quot;Recollections and impressions&quot; (1907), and their life in the remainder of the memoir.

==Recognition==

Sellar is commemorated on the south wall of Balliol College Chapel, together with a memorial to his brother Alexander Craig Sellar (MP for Haddington Burghs and Partick).

<text>Orono ( ) is a town in Penobscot County, Maine, United States. Located on the Penobscot and Stillwater rivers, it was first settled by American colonists in 1774. They named it in honor of Chief Joseph Orono, a sachem of the indigenous Penobscot nation who long occupied this territory.

In the nineteenth century, the town became a center of the lumber industry. Sawmills on the rivers were powered by the water, and logs were floated downriver on the Penobscot for shipping and export from coastal ports.

Since 1865 it has been the location of the University of Maine, established as a land-grant institution and the state&#x27;s flagship educational institution. In the fall of 2018, the university enrolled 11,404 students at Orono. Not including university residents, the town&#x27;s population was 11,183 at the 2020 census.

<doc id="257098" wikidata="Q541508" url="?curid=257098" title="Anglo-Normans">
<text>The Anglo-Normans (, ) were the medieval ruling class in the Kingdom of England following the Norman Conquest. They were primarily a combination of Normans, Bretons, Flemings, Frenchmen, Anglo-Saxons and Celtic Britons. 

After the conquest the victorious Normans formed a ruling class in England, distinct from (although intermarrying with) the native Anglo-Saxon and Celtic populations. Over time, their language evolved from the continental Old Norman to the distinct Anglo-Norman language. Anglo-Normans quickly established control over all of England, as well as parts of Wales (the Welsh-Normans). After 1130, parts of southern and eastern Scotland came under Anglo-Norman rule (the Scots-Normans), in return for their support of David I&#x27;s conquest. The Anglo-Norman invasion of Ireland from 1169 saw Anglo-Normans and Cambro-Normans conquer swaths of Ireland, becoming the Irish-Normans.

The composite expression &quot;regno Norman-Anglorum&quot; for the Anglo-Norman kingdom that comprises Normandy and England appears contemporaneously only in the &quot;Hyde Chronicle&quot;.

==Norman conquest==
A small number of Normans had earlier befriended future Anglo-Saxon king of England, Edward the Confessor, during his exile in his mother&#x27;s homeland of Normandy in northern France. When he returned to England, some of them went with him; as such, there were Normans already settled in England before the conquest. Edward&#x27;s successor, Harold Godwinson, was defeated by Duke William the Conqueror of Normandy at the Battle of Hastings, leading to William&#x27;s accession to the English throne.

After the Norman Conquest of 1066, many of the Anglo-Saxon nobles lost lands and titles; the lesser thegns and others found themselves dispossessed of lands and titles. A number of free &quot;geburs&quot; had their rights and court access much decreased, becoming unfree &quot;villeins&quot;, despite the fact that this status did not exist in Normandy itself (compared to other &quot;French&quot; regions). At the same time, many of the new Norman and Northern-France magnates were distributed lands by the King that had been taken from the English nobles. Some of these magnates used their original French-derived names, with the prefix &#x27;de,&#x27; meaning they were lords of the old fiefs in France, and some instead dropped their original names and took their names from new English holdings.

The Norman conquest of England brought Britain and Ireland into the orbit of the European continent, especially what remained of Roman-influenced language and culture. The England emerging from the Conquest owed a debt to the Romance languages and the culture of ancient Rome. It transmitted itself in the emerging feudal world that took its place. That heritage can be discerned in language, incorporating the French language and the Roman past, and in the emerging Romanesque (Norman) architecture.

== Military influence ==
The Norman conquest of England also signalled a revolution in military styles and methods. A lot of the old Anglo-Saxon military elite began to emigrate, especially the generation next younger to that defeated at Hastings, who had no particular future in a country controlled by the conquerors. William (and his son, William Rufus), encouraged them to leave, as a security measure. The first to leave went mostly to Denmark and many of these moved on to join the Varangian Guard in Constantinople. The Anglo-Saxons as a whole, for practical reason, however were not demilitarised. Instead, William arranged for the Saxon infantry to be trained up by Norman cavalry in anti-cavalry tactics. This led quickly to the establishment of an Anglo-Norman army made up of Norman horsemen of noble blood, Saxon infantrymen often of equally noble blood, assimilated English freemen as rank-and-file, and foreign mercenaries and adventurers from other parts of the Continent. The younger Norman aristocracy showed a tendency towards Anglicisation, adopting such Saxon styles as long hair and moustaches, upsetting the older generation. (The Anglo-Saxon &quot;cniht&quot; did not take the sense of the French &quot;chevalier&quot; before the latest period of Middle English. John Wycliffe (1380s) uses the term &quot;knyytis&quot; generically for men-at-arms, and only in the 15th century did the word acquire the overtones of a noble cavalryman corresponding to the meaning of &quot;chevalier&quot;).
The Anglo-Norman conquest in the 12th century brought Norman customs and culture to Ireland.

== Norman-Saxon conflict ==
The degree of subsequent Norman-Saxon conflict (as a matter of conflicting social identities) is a question disputed by historians. The 19th-century view was of intense mutual resentment, reflected in the popular legends of Robin Hood and the novel &quot;Ivanhoe&quot; by Sir Walter Scott. Some residual ill-feeling is suggested by contemporary historian Orderic Vitalis, who in &quot;Ecclesiastical Historii&quot; (1125) wrote in praise of native English resistance to &quot;William the Bastard&quot; (William I of England). In addition, a fine called the &quot;murdrum&quot;, originally introduced to English law by the Danes under Canute, was revived, imposing on villages a high (46 mark/~£31) fine for the secret killing of a Norman (or an unknown person who was, under the murdrum laws, presumed to be Norman unless proven otherwise).

In order to secure Norman loyalty during his conquest, William I rewarded his loyal followers by taking English land and redistributing it to his knights, officials, and the Norman aristocracy. In turn, the English hated him, but the king retaliated ruthlessly with his military force to subdue the rebellions and discontentment. Mike Ashley writes on this subject; &quot;he [William I] may have conquered them [the English], but he never ruled them&quot;. Not all of the Anglo-Saxons immediately accepted him as their legitimate king.

Whatever the level of dispute, over time, the two populations intermarried and merged. This began soon after the conquest. Tenants-in-chief following the conquest who married English women included Geofrey de la Guerche, Walter of Dounai and Robert d&#x27;Oilly. Other Norman aristocrats with English wives following the conquest include William Pece, Richard Juvenis and Odo, a Norman knight. Eventually, even this distinction largely disappeared in the course of the Hundred Years War (1337–1453), and by the 14th century Normans identified themselves as English, having been fully assimilated into the emerging English population.

== Wales ==
The Normans also led excursions into Wales from England and built multiple fortifications as it was one of William&#x27;s ambitions to subdue the Welsh as well as the English, however, he was not entirely successful. Afterward, however, the border area known as the Marches was set up and Norman influence increased steadily. Encouraged by the invasion, monks (usually from France or Normandy) such as the Cistercian Order also set up monasteries throughout Wales. By the 15th century a large number of Welsh gentry, including Owain Glyndŵr, had some Norman ancestry. The majority of knights who invaded Ireland were also from or based in Wales (see below).

== Ireland ==
Anglo-Norman barons also settled in Ireland from the 12th century, initially to support Irish regional kings such as Diarmuid Mac Murchadha whose name has arrived in modern English as Dermot MacMurrough. Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke, known as &quot;Strongbow&quot;, was the leader of the Anglo-Norman Knights whom MacMurrough had requested of Henry II of England to help him to re-establish himself as King of Leinster. Strongbow died a very short time after invading Ireland but the men he brought with him remained to support Henry II of England and his son John as Lord of Ireland. Chief among the early Anglo-Norman settlers was Theobald Walter (surname Butler) appointed hereditary chief Butler of Ireland in 1177 by King Henry II and founder of one of the oldest remaining British dignities. Most of these Normans came from Wales, not England, and thus the epithet &#x27;Cambro-Normans&#x27; is used to describe them by leading late medievalists such as Seán Duffy. They increasingly integrated with the local Celtic nobility through intermarriage and some accepted aspects of Celtic culture, especially outside the Pale around Dublin. They are known as &quot;Old English&quot;, but this term came into use to describe them only in 1580, i.e., over four centuries after the first Normans arrived in Ireland.

The Carol was a popular Norman dance in which the leader sang and was surrounded by a circle of dancers who replied with the same song. This Norman dance was performed in conquered Irish towns.

==Scotland==
David I, who had spent most of his life as an English baron, became king of Scotland in 1124. His reign saw what has been characterised as a &quot;Davidian Revolution&quot;, by which native institutions and personnel were replaced by English and French ones. Members of the Anglo-Norman nobility took up places in the Scottish aristocracy and he introduced a system of feudal land tenure, which produced knight service, castles and an available body of heavily armed cavalry. He created an Anglo-Norman style of court, introduced the office of justiciar to oversee justice, and local offices of sheriffs to administer localities. He established the first royal burghs in Scotland, granting rights to particular settlements, which led to the development of the first true Scottish towns and helped facilitate economic development as did the introduction of the first recorded Scottish coinage. He continued a process begun by his mother and brothers, of helping to establish foundations that brought the reformed monasticism based on that at Cluny. He also played a part in the organisation of diocese on lines closer to those in the rest of Western Europe. These reforms were pursued under his successors and grandchildren Malcolm IV of Scotland and William I, with the crown now passing down the main line of descent through primogeniture, leading to the first of a series of minorities.

<text>Old Orchard Beach is a resort town in York County, Maine, United States. The population was 8,960 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Portland−South Portland−Biddeford, Maine Metropolitan Statistical Area.

Located on the inner side of Saco Bay on the Atlantic Ocean, the town is a popular seaside resort. The downtown contains many tourist-oriented businesses, including clam shacks and T-shirt shops. A wooden pier on the beach contains many other tourist businesses, including a variety of souvenir shops. The town’s seven mile (11 km) long beach extends into the towns of Scarborough and Saco, and is lined with many beach residential properties, condominiums, motels and bed and breakfasts.

==Early history==
People of the Abenaki nation have inhabited the area since before contact. The first European visitor to the area around the mouth of the Saco and Goosefare rivers was British explorer Martin Pring in 1603.

The Old Orchard Beach area began appearing in historical records around 1653. The area was first officially settled in 1657 by Thomas Rogers who had arrived in the Goosefare Brook area in 1636, and who dubbed it &quot;The Garden By The Sea&quot;. The town takes its name from Rogers&#x27; abandoned apple orchard. Rogers&#x27; family left the area and relocated in Kittery, Maine after an Indian attack destroyed the Rogers&#x27; homestead. The namesake orchard survived for approximately 150 years as a beacon of land to sailors in the Atlantic Ocean. The historic Free Will Baptist revival camp at Ocean Park, Maine, just down the beach from central Old Orchard, was built in 1881 by Bates College President Oren B. Cheney. The mission of the Association, as declared to the State of Maine on January 24, 1881, was &quot;to establish a place of summer resort for holding religious, educational and other meetings at Old Orchard, in Saco, Maine, in the County of York.&quot;. The community still thrives today.

==Tourist resort==

In 1829 the first Public House opened. In 1837 tourists were paying a small amount to stay at a local farm while they visited the area. In 1942, trains could be taken from Boston to Portland. Over the years Old Orchard developed into a major resort. At one point, planes were able to take off from the beach, as well as, some automobiles racing on the sand. Most of the large hotels were destroyed in the fire of 1907. The oldest hotel still standing on the beachfront in Old Orchard at this time is The Ocean House Hotel &amp; Motel, circa 1895, located at 71 West Grand Avenue. It retains its original parlors and character. In 1923, when discrimination in lodging was rampant and Black musicians were denied rooms in other local hotels, the Cummings&#x27; Guest House opened at 110 Portland Avenue to offer lodging to Black visitors. It was operated by Rose and Edward Cummings Jr. and prominent guests included Duke Ellington, Cab Calloway, Count Basie, and Lionel Hampton. The guest house operated until 1993.

===Attractions===
The seaside amusement park Palace Playland is located in Old Orchard Beach. The amusement park dates back to 1902 and sits on four acres of beachfront property. Palace Playland is one of the last old-timey oceanside amusement parks in New England.

Old Orchard Beach was home to the first carousel in the United States, and in the past there were two carousels with hand-carved horses and other animals. Noah&#x27;s Ark, a kid-friendly, boat-shaped funhouse with hand-carved figures of Noah and his family, was designed to provide an exciting but not frightening experience for a 5-year-old. The entire structure would rock back and forth while guests meandered through dark passages. Colored lights would flash, loud klaxons would sound, and compressed air would shoot from the floor. On the Jack and Jill slide, two people would be placed on a large hemp mat in a wooden bucket, which would take them to the top of a tall tower and dump them onto a metal slide for a quick ride down.

The current 2019 version of Palace Playland consists of a newly built Ferris wheel, a arcade, and 25 rides for both children and adults. The new Ferris wheel replaces the tall, decades old Sunwheel with one that is environmentally sound and technologically superior. and a brand new roller coaster opening in 2018 known as the “sea viper”

Every Thursday the beach has a firework show at the pier at night. This occurs in the summer from Memorial Day until Labor Day.

===The Pier===

Three versions of the Pier were constructed by people and modified by nature. The first, long, was built of steel in 1898. When the ribbon was cut on July 2, 1898, it was a “global cultural icon,” at 1,825 feet the longest steel pier in the world, created by Berlin Iron Bridge Co. at a cost of $38,000. At its end was the Pier Casino, a ballroom with room for 5,000 dancers. Shortly after its completion a storm reduced its length by . It was rebuilt, but 10 years later, after another storm, the pier was shortened to and the Casino was moved. In the interwar period, the Casino hosted such acts as Guy Lombardo, Louis Armstrong, Benny Goodman, Xavier Cugat and Frank Sinatra. After the war Old Orchard became somewhat downscale, becoming known as a destination for blue-collar partygoers. A fire in 1969 destroyed Noah&#x27;s Ark, the two carousels, the Whale&#x27;s Mouth, the Mine Ride, and the Jack and Jill slide. The Casino was demolished in 1970.
The current incarnation of the pier was built in 1980 after being destroyed by a blizzard in 1978. The current structure stretches into the Atlantic Ocean. The wooden walk way is lined with souvenir shops, carnival-style foods, and a night club at the end of the pier.

==Sports==
Old Orchard Beach was home to several minor league and collegiate level baseball teams. The Maine Guides played at The Ballpark from 1984 to 1988 and were the AAA affiliate of the Philadelphia Phillies. The Guides relocated in 1989 after finishing last in attendance and in wins in the International League during their final season in Old Orchard Beach. The Ballpark opened in 1984 and was renovated in 2009. Approximately $240,000 worth of volunteer labor and goods went into the project. Old Orchard Beach Surge, a baseball team which played in the independent Empire Professional Baseball League. The Surge relocated to Saranac Lake, New York in 2019 and continued to play as the Saranac Lake Surge. From 2012-2014, the Old Orchard Beach Raging Tide in the New England Collegiate Baseball League played at the ballpark. in 2014 Owners John and Pam Gallo sold the Raging Tide franchise, which became the Bristol Blues.

Old Orchard Beach is the twin city of the French seaside resort of Mimizan, as a reminder of Oiseau Canari, the pioneer aircraft crossing of the Atlantic by Assollant, Lefèvre and Lotti in 1929 to Oyambre (Cantabria, Spain).

==Immigration and foreign affairs==

<doc id="257155" wikidata="Q2305776" url="?curid=257155" title="Somerset, Massachusetts">
<text>Somerset is a town in Bristol County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 18,303 at the 2020 census. It is the birthplace and hometown of Clifford Milburn Holland (1883–1924), the chief engineer and namesake of the Holland Tunnel in New York City.

Somerset is a part of the South Coast region of Massachusetts which encompasses the communities that surround Buzzards Bay (excluding the Elizabeth Islands, Bourne and Falmouth), Mount Hope Bay and the Sakonnet River.

==History==
Somerset was first settled in 1677 on the Shawomet lands, and was officially incorporated in 1790. It was named for Somerset Square in Boston, which was, in turn, named for the county of Somerset in England. It was once a vital shipping point, and after the War of 1812 it was one of America&#x27;s chief distribution points. In 1872, it became the site of a major coal port, and in the early 20th century a large cannery existed in the town. However, as neighboring Fall River&#x27;s industry grew, it absorbed much of Somerset&#x27;s, and the town took on more of a suburban character. In fact, the town&#x27;s population grew during the Great Depression, as many people from Fall River and other localities moved to the suburb. Today, the town&#x27;s major industry (other than suburban services) is power generation, with the Montaup Electric Company plant upriver (founded in 1923) and the Brayton Point Power Station at the town&#x27;s southern tip (founded in 1963). Brayton Point has been the target of much criticism for its pollution problems from burning coal. It closed May 31, 2017.

Historically, the town has had a connective relationship with Fall River. Originally, Slade&#x27;s Ferry ran across the Taunton River to connect the two towns since the late 18th century. In the late 19th century, the Slade&#x27;s Ferry Bridge connected the two towns, from the current southern terminus of Brayton Avenue in Somerset to Brownell Street in Fall River, and was double-decked, with a railroad section on the top level. The bridge was dismantled after closing in 1970 due to its rapid deterioration and its low height. (The path of the old bridge is still somewhat visible; two large sets of power lines cross the river at the same point.) The Brightman Street Bridge just to the north was opened in 1908. A new bridge, named the Veterans Memorial Bridge, was partially completed prior to a dedication ceremony held on September 11, 2011. At first, only the westbound side of the bridge was open to traffic. Since then, both lanes of the bridge have been opened for traffic.

==Geography==

Somerset is located at (41.748502, −71.153188). According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 32.30%, is water. It borders on Mount Hope Bay and Narragansett Bay, and its east border is formed by the Taunton River, an arm of that bay.

Somerset is bordered by Swansea on the west, Dighton on the north, Fall River on the east (across the Taunton River), and Bristol, Rhode Island, to the south. The border with Bristol is located in the middle of the bay. Cities close to Somerset include Fall River, New Bedford, Attleboro, and Providence, and the town is one hour&#x27;s drive south of Boston.

The town is accessed via Interstate 195, which enters the town via the Braga Bridge from Fall River and has an exit at Route 103. It is also connected via the Veterans Memorial Bridge, the fourth bridge to cross the Taunton River between the town and city. The Veterans Memorial Bridge carries U.S. Route 6 and Route 138 across the river. Route 6 heads east-west towards Swansea, with several shopping plazas along the route. Route 138 travels north from the bridge along County Street, the town&#x27;s main north-south thoroughfare, towards Dighton. Route 103&#x27;s eastern terminus lies at the former intersection of Routes 6 and 138 just south of the new bridge. It heads south-southeast for three-quarters of a mile before turning west-northwest towards Swansea, crossing into that town at a bridge over Lee&#x27;s River. Due to the controversy in Fall River over the proposed building of an LNG terminal, town officials have consider keeping the old Brightman Street Bridge open, as the tankers would not fit through it, and the terminal&#x27;s proposed site is upriver of the bridges. However, as of the opening of the new bridge, the bridge is closed, as the old roads leading to it on the Fall River side have been removed to make way for the new bridge&#x27;s ramp system.

Somerset has bus service along Route 6 provided by the Southeastern Regional Transit Authority (SRTA). The nearest regional bus service is in Fall River, and the nearest rail service is in Providence. There are plans in the works to bring commuter rail service to Fall River by 2023, which would give the town rail access to Boston. The town&#x27;s nearest regional airport is in New Bedford, away. Until the late 1990s, the nearest airport was in Fall River; however, the airport closed due to various issues. The nearest national airport is T. F. Green Airport in Rhode Island, away. The nearest international airport is Logan International Airport, away in Boston.

In the state senate, Somerset is part of the First Bristol and Plymouth district, which includes Fall River, Freetown, Lakeville, Rochester, Swansea and Westport. Representative Patricia Haddad (D-Somerset) represents Somerset in the State House of Representatives. Senator Michael Rodrigues (D-Westport) represents Somerset in the state senate. On the national level, the town is part of Massachusetts&#x27;s 4th congressional district, which is represented by Jake Auchincloss. The state&#x27;s senior Senator is Elizabeth Warren. The state&#x27;s junior Senator is Ed Markey.

The town&#x27;s library is located north of the town hall in the center of town, and was expanded for more resource and meeting areas in 2000. The town&#x27;s historical society is located in the north end of town, and also operates a museum in that location (in the former Village School building). The old Town Hall, to the north of the library, is still in use for various public gatherings. The town is served by one centralized police and fire headquarters, along with a smaller branch fire station in the Brayton Point area which is also trained to handle emergencies at the Brayton Point Power Plant. The town&#x27;s zip codes are 02725 and 02726, although both are now located in the central post office in the heart of town. The town maintains five parks (Buffington Park, Ashton Field, Waterfront Park, Rock Park, and South Complex Baseball/softball fields), as well as a town beach, Pierce Beach, located next to Pierce Playground along the Taunton River in the north end of town. A sixth park, Slade&#x27;s Ferry Park, was closed by eminent domain for the right-of-way of the new Brightman Street Bridge being built.

==Education==
Somerset is served by its own public school system. It has three elementary schools, from north to south they are the North Elementary School, the Chace Street School, and the South Elementary School. A fourth elementary school, Wilbur Elementary School, closed in June 2014 following a majority vote by the school board. Somerset Middle School (formerly known as Somerset Junior High School) is located adjacent to South Elementary along Brayton Avenue, and handles grades 6 through 8. Somerset Berkley Regional High School is located along County Street (Route 138). The school&#x27;s mascot is the &quot;Blue Raider&quot;, and its colors are dark blue and white. The school is known locally for having two former baseball players play professionally, Greg Gagne and Jerry Remy. The town is a member of the Diman Regional Vocational Technical High School system in Fall River, and high school students may also attend Bristol County Agricultural High School in Dighton.

Many students of all grades attend private schools in Fall River, including Bishop Connolly High School. There are no private schools in the town.

The new (and renamed) regional school opened in late August 2014. Projected costs for the new Somerset-Berkley Regional High School are now at $81.5 million to $83.8 million, notably higher than earlier estimates after planners found that more costs than they had believed wouldn&#x27;t be reimbursed by the state. The school was built just behind the old high school, atop the former location of the soccer fields and tennis courts. The football field and running track were completely refurbished and completed before the start of the school year. The first graduating class will be the class of 2015. The original high school building was set to be demolished in late 2014, and on its former site will be a new series of fields for student use.

<text>James Mackenzie Fallows (born August 2, 1949) is an American writer and journalist. He is a former national correspondent for &quot;The Atlantic.&quot; His work has also appeared in &quot;Slate&quot;, &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and &quot;The American Prospect&quot;, among others. He is a former editor of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;, and as President Jimmy Carter&#x27;s chief speechwriter for two years was the youngest person ever to hold that job.

Fallows has been a visiting professor at a number of universities in the U.S. and China, and has held the Chair in U.S. Media at the United States Studies Centre at University of Sydney. He is the author of eleven books, including &quot;National Defense&quot; (1981), for which he received the 1983 National Book Award, &quot;Looking at the Sun&quot; (1994), &quot;Breaking the News&quot; (1996), &quot;Blind into Baghdad&quot; (2006), &quot;Postcards from Tomorrow Square&quot; (2009), &quot;China Airborne&quot; (2012), and the national best-seller &quot;Our Towns&quot; (2018), which was co-written with his wife, Deborah Fallows, and made into an HBO documentary of the same name in 2021.

== Biography ==
Fallows was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the son of Jean (née Mackenzie) and James Albert Fallows, a physician. He was raised in Redlands, California, and graduated from Redlands High School. He studied American history and literature at Harvard College, where he was the editor of the daily newspaper, &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot;. From 1970 to 1972, Fallows studied economics at The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford, as a Rhodes scholar. He subsequently worked as an editor and writer for &quot;The Washington Monthly&quot; and &quot;Texas Monthly&quot; magazines.

For the first two years of the Carter administration he was Carter&#x27;s chief speechwriter. At age 27, he became the youngest person in history to hold that position. From 1979 through 1996, he was the Washington Editor for &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; (now &quot;The Atlantic&quot;). For two years of that time he was based in Texas, and for four years in Asia. He wrote for the magazine about immigration, defense policy, politics, economics, computer technology, and other subjects. He has been a finalist for the National Magazine Awards five times and won in 2003, for &quot;The Fifty-First State?&quot; (&quot;The Atlantic&quot;, November 2002), which was published six months before the invasion of Iraq and laid out the difficulties of occupying the country. He won the National Book Award for &quot;National Defense&quot; and won a NY Emmy in 2010 for his role as host of a documentary series, &quot;Doing Business in China&quot;.

Fallows&#x27;s most influential articles have concerned military policy and military procurement, the college admissions process, technology, China and Japan, and the American war in Iraq. Early in his career, he wrote an article called &quot;What Did You Do in the Class War, Daddy?&quot; (&quot;Washington Monthly&quot;, October 1975). It described the &quot;draft physical&quot; day at the Boston Navy Yard in 1970, in which Fallows and his Harvard and MIT classmates overwhelmingly produced reasons for medical exemptions, while the white working-class men of Chelsea, Massachusetts were approved for service. He argued that the class bias of the Vietnam draft, which made it easy for him and for others from influential and affluent families to avoid service, prolonged the war and that this was a truth many opponents of the war found convenient to overlook.

In the 1980s and 1990s Fallows was a frequent contributor of commentaries to National Public Radio&#x27;s &quot;Morning Edition,&quot; and since 2009 he has been the regular news analyst for NPR&#x27;s &quot;Weekend All Things Considered&quot;. From 1996 to 1998, he was the editor of &quot;US News &amp; World Report&quot;. He was the founding chairman of the New America Foundation, a nonprofit group based in Washington D.C. During the 2000–2001 academic year, Fallows taught at the graduate school of journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and in 2010 he was the Vare Writer in Residence at the University of Chicago. Starting in the 2010 academic year, he is a visiting Professor in U.S. Media at the United States Studies Centre at the University of Sydney.

Fallows is an instrument-rated pilot. In &quot;Free Flight&quot;, published in 2001, he described the new generation of &quot;personal jets&quot; and other advanced aircraft coming onto the market from Eclipse Aviation and Cirrus Design, as well as the story of Cirrus founders brothers Alan and Dale Klapmeier and how they became involved in aviation. Fallows has received numerous honorary degrees, including from the University of Utah, the University of Maryland, the University of Redlands, Northwestern University, Ursinus College, and in 2017 the University of Vermont.

Fallows has had a long interest in technology, both writing about and helping to develop it. He&#x27;s taken a special interest in personal information management software, going back to Lotus Agenda which he glowingly reviewed for &quot;The Atlantic&quot; in 1992 (&quot;Of all the computer programs I have tried, Agenda is far and away the most interesting, and is one of the two or three most valuable&quot;). During the operating system wars of the early and mid-nineties, Fallows used and wrote about IBM&#x27;s Operating System/2 (OS/2) and its battles with MS Windows, often frequenting the Canopus forum and online community on CompuServe. In 1999, he spent six months at Microsoft designing software for writers. More recently, he has written about the design of the Open Source Applications Foundation&#x27;s information manager, code-named Chandler. He was the on-stage host for the IDG Corporation&#x27;s &quot;Agenda&quot; conference (no relation to Agenda software) in the early years of the 2000s (decade) and of Google&#x27;s &quot;Zeitgeist&quot; conference starting in 2005. He has written regular technology columns for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and &quot;The Atlantic&quot;.

In September 2021, Fallows launched a Substack site called &quot;Breaking the News&quot;, whose title was based on his 1996 book of the same name.

== Politics ==
Fallows, a former speechwriter for Democratic President Jimmy Carter, has identified himself as a Democrat and has been described by &quot;Politico&quot; and &quot;The Hill&quot;, among other publications, as a liberal. According to journalist Howard Fineman, Fallows also wrote policy memos to Democratic President Bill Clinton. An article in &quot;The Futurist&quot;, a publication of the World Future Society, identifies Fallows as a radical centrist.

== Awards ==
For the first paperback edition of &quot;National Defense&quot;, Fallows received a 1983 National Book Award for Nonfiction.
He was a finalist at the National Magazine Award in the years 1988, 2006 (twice), 2007 and had won the award in 2003 for his article &quot;The Fifty-First State?&quot;. The documentary series &quot;On The Frontlines: Doing Business in China&quot; in which he participated as an editorial supervisor and co-host (together with Emily Chang) was awarded the 2010 Emmy Award.

He was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 2019.

== Genetic ancestry ==
In 2012, Fallows gained notice for the results of the testing of his genetic makeup. In addition to the fact that the lineage shown on the mitochondrial DNA of his mother&#x27;s side did not resemble any other samples found in a large-scale study, it was shown that Fallows had an abnormally high percentage of Neanderthal ancestry, at 5% of his genes being of Neanderthal origin. This drew attention from numerous scientists.

== Personal life ==
Fallows is married to writer and researcher Deborah Fallows, with whom he has two sons. The book &quot;Our Towns&quot; (2018) was co-authored and researched by the couple, which became the basis for an HBO documentary film in 2021.

<text>Lynnfield is a town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States. At the 2020 census, the town population was 13,000.

Lynnfield initially consisted of two distinct villages with a single governing body. Lynnfield Center had a mostly agricultural population, while South Lynnfield had a mixed culture. Together, the two towns evolved into one of the most prosperous suburbs in the North Shore region of Massachusetts.

== History ==

The town of Lynnfield was first settled in 1638 and was made a district separate from Lynn in 1782. It was later officially incorporated in 1814. Historically, Lynnfield functioned as two separate villages connected by one governing body: in Lynnfield Center resided a mostly agricultural population, while South Lynnfield was a crossroad situated amongst neighboring larger towns. During this time, the town had two inns, a granite rock quarry, a small carbonated beverage bottler, and various eating institutions.

The stagecoach line north from Boston to Portsmouth, New Hampshire, known locally as the &quot;Newburyport Turnpike&quot;, ran through South Lynnfield. Later this roadway became U.S. Route 1, the route which brought many people north to the small town during the post-World War II population surge. Lynnfield had attractions such as horse shows and ballroom dancing. Lynnfield has since become a modern, chiefly residential suburb of Boston.

Along with the communities of Chelsea, Lynn, Salem, Marblehead, Danvers, Middleton, Andover, Methuen, Haverhill, Amesbury and Salisbury, Lynnfield was a part of &quot;The Gerry-mander&quot; so described by the &quot;Boston Gazette&quot; on March 26, 1812.

Lynnfield Center retained limited commuter rail service, via the Boston &amp; Maine Railroad, into the late 1950s/early 1960s with a small railroad boarding platform located not far from the current Town Hall offices.

When, in the 1960s, the United States Post Office implemented the Zone Improvement Program with five-digit numerical codes, Lynnfield was assigned two ZIP codes, 01940 and 01944, for the Lynnfield Center and the South Lynnfield post offices, respectively. Later, 01944 was reassigned to Manchester (now Manchester-by-the-Sea); South Lynnfield currently shares Zip Code 01940 with Lynnfield Center.

Several lakes and ponds dot the town, including Suntaug Lake, Reedy Meadow, Pillings Pond, and Walden Pond (a less famous cousin of the one in Concord). A portion of the Lynn Woods Reservation is located in the southeastern corner of town, and in the northwestern part of town lies part of Camp Curtis Guild, a Massachusetts National Guard base which also contains lands in the neighboring towns. The highest part of town lies on Middleton Hill in the northern part of town.

No other state routes pass through the town. The Springfield Terminal Railroad passes through town, but is no longer in service. There is no MBTA Commuter Rail service within Lynnfield; the nearest train station is off to the west in the neighboring town of Wakefield, which serves the Haverhill Commuter Rail Line. MBTA Bus Route 436 clips the extreme southeastern corner of Lynnfield with a bus stop available at the intersection of Lynnfield Street and Lookout Terrace; the stop is located just two blocks southeast of Condon Circle (sometimes referred to as Goodwin Circle). Inbound service on MBTA Bus Route 436 travels to Central Square, Lynn to connect with the Newburyport/Rockport Commuter Rail Line; outbound buses provide service to the Northshore Mall in Peabody and the Liberty Tree Mall in Danvers.

<text>Nahant () is a town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States. The population was 3,334 at the 2020 census, which makes it the smallest municipality by population in Essex County. With just of land area, it is also the smallest municipality by area in the state and is primarily a residential community. The town is situated on a peninsula consisting of two near-islands (known as &quot;Little Nahant&quot; and &quot;Big Nahant&quot; respectively) connected to the mainland by a narrow sandy isthmus traversed by a single causeway known as &quot;Nahant Road&quot;. Numerous tourist beaches line the shores, with the most popular being the so-called &quot;Long Beach&quot; and &quot;Short Beach&quot; along the eastern side of the causeway.

==History==

The area around Nahant was inhabited for thousands of years prior to European colonization of the Americas, but little is known of this period until European records began to document the area in the early 1600s. 

In 1605, Samuel de Champlain interacted briefly with native people in Nahant and remarked that &quot;all along this coast there is much cleared land sewn with Indian corn.&quot; 

By the 1630s at the time of English colonization, the seat of &quot;Sagamore James&quot; of the Naumkeag, known in his own tongue as Montowampate, was at the outlet of the Saugus River overlooking Nahant, though the island itself may have been controlled by a sachem Poquanum, known to English settlers as Blacke William or Duke William, who around 1632 gave permission to Thomas Dexter to use the island in exchange for an English suit. The word Nahant may mean &quot;at the point,&quot; or &quot;twin islands,&quot; or it may refer to an important local person named Nahantum.

The peninsula was first settled by English colonists in 1630, in the second year of the Puritan coming: the servants of Isaac Johnson grazed his cattle on the land, and it was also often used by citizens of Lynn for grazing cattle, sheep and goats. Although not a separate town until 1853, Nahant was listed as one of thirty &quot;noted Habitations&quot; in New England by William Wood in 1633, and Nahant Poynt appears labeled on a map of the Massachusetts coastline from 1639.

Before 1800 there were only three homes on the island: those built by the Breeds and the Hoods, and the Johnson home built by Jeremiah Gray. The first hotel was built by one of the Johnsons 1802, and in 1817 a steamboat ran daily between Boston and Nahant. The town was originally part of Lynn; when the temperance movement threatened the summer resort trade in 1853, Nahant incorporated as a separate town. In the late 19th century, it was home to some of the country&#x27;s first amusement parks, as well as a popular summer retreat for the wealthy, including the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow. The geologist Louis Agassiz was a resident and the artist William Stanley Haseltine produced many versions of his oil painting &#x27;The Rocks at Nahant&#x27;. During World War II, East Point was the site of a coastal artillery battery. It is now a town park, and location of the Marine Science Center for Northeastern University.

===Development===
The old Nahant Life-Saving Station (NLSS) on Nahant Road and the new War Memorial erected across the street from the NLSS were renovated in 2004.

In 2003, the dilapidated Valley Road School was refurbished and re-commissioned as the Nahant Community Center, which is now home to many local activities and banquets, including the local Boy Scout Troop 50.

On September 25, 2005, the Town of Nahant officially commemorated the completely rebuilt Bailey&#x27;s Hill Gazebo as the Calantha Sears Gazebo. The original was built for the bicentennial in 1976, and over the years had fallen into disrepair. With funding from the Woman&#x27;s Club of Nahant and collaboration with the town of Nahant, local residents contributed to its reconstruction. Besides the cement base, the only remaining piece of the original is the wooden cylinder in the center of the roof, which still bears the &quot;1976&quot; emblem—repainted by Nahant resident Octavia Randolph.

==Geography and transportation==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 93.24%, is water. Nahant is a tied island connected to the mainland by a natural tombolo, effectively a peninsula though often referred to as an &quot;island&quot;. Nahant is connected by a causeway to the city of Lynn. The town is surrounded by Nahant Bay to the east, Nahant Harbor to the south, and Lynn Harbor to the west, all of which lead directly into Broad Sound and Massachusetts Bay. The town is essentially divided into a main portion and Little Nahant, just north of the main portion of town along the eastern side of the causeway. The area along the west side of town, between Black Rock Point and Bass Point, is the most densely settled part of town. There are ten beaches along the coastline, the largest being Nahant Beach and Long Beach, both of which line the eastern side of the causeway road north of Little Nahant. Included in these ten beaches is Short beach, one of the most popular sites in the town during the summer, only accessible through a Nahant beach sticker. The town also has a few small parks and the Kelly Greens Golf Course.

Nahant is just one of four towns out of the 351 cities and towns in Massachusetts (along with Rockport, Provincetown and Aquinnah) that only touches one other town by land (Gosnold and Nantucket do not touch any). Only touching a 400-yard portion of Lynn by land, the water rights of the town also touch those of Revere, Winthrop and Boston, in Suffolk County. Both by land and by sea, Nahant is the southernmost town in Essex County. The town is centered by land northeast of Boston, south of Salem, and southwest of Cape Ann.

The nearest state route is Route 129, within Lynn. The nearest highways are a highway portion of U.S. Route 1 in Saugus and Interstate 95 and Route 128 in Peabody. The only mass transit within town is route 439 of the MBTA bus system, which loops within town before passing back into Lynn, providing access to Central Square, home to a stop along the Newburyport/Rockport Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail, providing service between the North Shore and Boston&#x27;s North Station. Some 439 buses extend their service to Wonderland, providing a connection to the MBTA Blue Line. The nearest airport to town is Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport.

<text>Saugus is a town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States, in the Greater Boston area. The population was 28,619 at the 2020 census. Saugus is known as the site of the first integrated iron works in North America.

==History==

Native Americans inhabited the area around Saugus for thousands of years before the arrival of European settlers in the 1620s. At the time of European arrival, the Naumkeag, also known as Pawtucket, under the leadership of Montowampate were based near present-day Saugus and controlled land extending from what is now Boston to the Merrimack River. English settlers took the name &quot;Sagus&quot; or &quot;Saugus&quot; from the Pawtucket word for &quot;outlet&quot;, and used the term to refer to the Saugus River and the region that includes the present day cities and towns of Swampscott, Nahant, Lynn, Lynnfield, Reading, North Reading and Wakefield) which were later renamed Lin or Lynn in 1637, after King&#x27;s Lynn in Norfolk, England.

In 1646, the Saugus Iron Works, then called Hammersmith, began operations. It was the first integrated iron works in North America as well as one of the most technologically advanced in the world. The Iron Works produced over one ton of iron a day but was not financially successful. It closed around 1670.

In September 1687, Major Samuel Appleton was said to have given a speech from a rocky cliff near the Iron Works denouncing the tyranny of Colonial Governor Sir Edmund Andros. The place where he is said to have delivered the speech became known as Appleton&#x27;s Pulpit.

Nearly 100 men from Saugus fought in the American Revolutionary War. Saugus&#x27; preacher, Parson Joseph Roby, worked to strengthen the spirit of independence in Saugus and was instrumental in seeing that Saugus sent a large contingent to fight in the war.

The nineteenth century ice industry began in Saugus when in 1804 Frederic Tudor cut ice from a pond on the family farm and shipped it to Martinique.

In 1805 the Newburyport Turnpike (now U.S. 1) was built. About four miles of this road were built in Saugus. At first, the turnpike was considered a mistake, as it was built over hills and swamps and grass soon grew over the roadbed. From 1840 to 1846, the tolls were discontinued and it became a public highway. The invention of the automobile resulted in an increase in traffic on the Turnpike. In 1933 the road was widened and an overpass was added to separate the traffic on Route 1 and Main Street. In the 1950s, new businesses started relocating to Route 1. Today, the businesses along Route 1 generate millions of dollars for Saugus.

The Lynn territory was shortened beginning in 1814 with the incorporation of Lynnfield. On February 17, 1815, present-day Saugus was officially incorporated as a town. The first town meeting was held on March 13, 1815, in the parish church. At the time of its incorporation, Saugus&#x27; population was 784. Its main industry was agriculture.

During the Industrial Revolution, many new industries moved to Saugus. Shoes and woolen goods were made in Saugus Center, and tobacco was manufactured in Cliftondale and East Saugus.

Saugus&#x27; first post office was established in 1832 in East Saugus. In 1858 two more were established—one in Saugus Center and one in Cliftondale. Now only the Cliftondale post office remains in Saugus.

The first town hall was built in 1837. It was built with $2,000 of the United States revenue surplus distributed by President Andrew Jackson. It is currently an American Legion hall. In 1875, the town built its second and current town hall on Central Street. The construction of the town hall put Saugus in a $50,000 debt. For this and other reasons, the neighborhood of East Saugus sought to be set off from Saugus and annexed to the city of Lynn. East Saugus was unable to get a bill in both houses of the state legislature, and the issue was dropped after the town appropriated $5,000 for the laying of water pipes through East Saugus.

Passenger trains ran through Saugus from 1853 to 1958 on the Saugus Branch Railroad. There were three Saugus Branch stations in Saugus (Saugus Center, Cliftondale, and Pleasant Hills) and two just outside the town&#x27;s borders in Lynn (East Saugus) and Revere (Franklin Park).
During the American Civil War, 155 Saugonians enlisted in the Union Army, and eight others enlisted in the Union Navy. Saugus native Gustavus Fox served as the United States Assistant Secretary of the Navy during the war. The , a Union Navy monitor named after the town, was launched in December 1863. Following the war, Henry E. Hone donated a large granite monument to the town of Saugus. The monument, which was designed by Melzar Hunt Mosman and cost $10,000 to build, contains the names of all of the men from Saugus who served during the Civil War on bronze tablets. Above the tablets are two bronze statues, one of a soldier and one of a sailor. It is topped by a granite statue of a woman wearing a helmet with an eagle on the top and holding a shield in her right hand, which serves as an allegorical representation of the United States. The monument was erected in the rotary at Saugus Center in 1875.

Following the Civil War, the Cliftondale section of Saugus became a major producer of tobacco, as many of the southern tobacco plantations had been destroyed. Waitt &amp; Bond became a major producer of cigars and the snuff factory in East Saugus was the nation&#x27;s largest producer of that product.

From 1859 to 1905, Saugus was home to the Franklin Park harness racing track. also known as the Old Saugus Race Track or Saugus Race Course. It closed in 1905 after local citizens complained about the questionable patrons that the racetrack attracted. In 1911 the racetrack became an airfield. In 1912, the property was purchased by the General Aviation Corporation who named it Atwood Park in honor of their most famous pilot, Harry Atwood. The airfield saw the first airmail delivery in New England on May 30, 1912. Pioneer aviators Ruth Bancroft Law and Lincoln J. Beachey flew at Saugus. The airport closed in the 1920s.

On October 8, 1900, George E. Bailey was murdered at Breakheart Hill Farm in Saugus. His legs and torso would be found nine days later in Floating Bridge Pond in Lynn. His head and arms were found there the next day. After a highly publicized investigation and trial, John C. Best was found guilty of murder. He was executed on September 9, 1902.

In 1934, Breakheart Hill Forest, a private hunting retreat located in North Saugus, was purchased by the Metropolitan District Commission for use as a state park. Shortly after purchasing Breakheart, the MDC turned the land over to the Civilian Conservation Corps, which built roads and trails, planted trees, and restored two dams on the property. In 1936, Breakheart Reservation was opened to the public.
Following a June 2, 1947, referendum, the town adopted a Plan E form of government. Saugus became the first town in Massachusetts to accept this form of government. On February 16, 1948, James Shurtleff was unanimously chosen by the Board of Selectmen to become the first Town Manager of Saugus.
In 1948, archaeologist Roland W. Robbins began excavating the site of the Saugus Iron Works, which had become hidden by underbrush since its closure. Based on the archeological evidence gathered by Robbins as well as historical documents and conjecture, the First Iron Works Association, with funding from the American Iron and Steel Institute, reconstructed the Saugus Iron Works. The Saugus Iron Works was opened on September 18, 1954, and operated as a private museum from 1954 until April 5, 1968, when it was renamed the Saugus Iron Works National Historic Site and became part of the National Park Service system.

Saugus is home to the oldest barber shop in the United States. The nearly 127-year-old George&#x27;s Barber Shop is located in Cliftondale Square,Saugus. A 6th Generation family business originally opened in 1898.

In the 1970s, the town, led by Town Manager Francis Moorehouse, attempted to transform the area around Route 107 by having an oil refinery and a garbage incineration plant built. Although the refinery plans fell through in October 1975, the incineration plant was completed. It would become the first commercially successful incineration plant in the U.S. and is still in operation today.
In 1989, the attempted murder of Frank Salemme (infamous criminal associate of Whitey Bulger and Stephen Flemmi) by Angelo Mercurio took place in Saugus.

During the 1990s and 2000s, the town&#x27;s Capital Improvement Plan, designed by Edward J. Collins, Jr., resulted in the construction of the new public safety building, senior center, library and public works facility. The Saugus Town Hall and the Stackpole Field clubhouse were renovated. In 2001, Town Manager Steven Angelo was able to secure federal funds to dredge the Saugus River, a project that had lingered since the 1960s.

The Saugus American Little League team represented New England in the 2003 Little League World Series. The team finished the tournament in 4th place. Its come-from-behind victory over Richmond, Texas in the tournament&#x27;s quarterfinals was nominated for the Best Game ESPY Award.

==Geography and transportation==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and , or 8.53%, is water. The town lies just inland from Massachusetts Bay, divided from the ocean by the Point of Pines neighborhood of Revere. The southern end of town is dominated by Rumney Marsh, which lies along the Pines River, a tributary of the Saugus River. The Saugus River flows through town and is fed by several brooks. There are several ponds within town, including parts of Birch Pond, Hawkes Pond and Walden Pond. Part of the Lynn Woods Reservation, and most of the Breakheart Reservation and Rumney Marsh Reservation lie within town.
Saugus is divided into several neighborhood villages, including Saugus Center, East Saugus, North Saugus, Pleasant Hills, Lynnhurst, Oaklandvale, Hammersmith Village, Golden Hills, Blacksmith Village, Bristow and Cliftondale. Of these, the majority of the town&#x27;s population resides in Lynnhurst, Pleasant Hills, Cliftondale, East Saugus and Saugus Center; Oaklandvale and North Saugus are much less densely populated. The town lies at the southern end of Essex County (though it is not the southernmost town in the county; Nahant extends just south of the town). The town is also bordered by Lynnfield to the north, Lynn to the east, Revere (in Suffolk County) to the south, and Melrose and Wakefield (both in Middlesex County) to the west. The town also shares a common point with the city of Malden, where it also meets Melrose and Revere. Saugus lies southwest of Salem, northeast of Boston, southwest of Cape Ann and south of the New Hampshire state line.

U.S. Route 1 passes through town as a high-speed divided six-lane highway, with five exits throughout town. This stretch of Route 1, though not a full controlled access highway (it is lined with a major shopping district, including the Square One Mall), is the main commuter route out of Boston for the North Shore region, heading towards the interchange of Interstate 95 and Massachusetts Route 128 in Lynnfield, effectively serving as a practical extension of I-95 into Boston. Route 1 through Saugus was once known for its abundance of kitschy roadside commercial architecture, including the 68-foot neon cactus of the Hilltop Steak House, though since the 2000s some of these landmarks have been demolished or fallen into disrepair. The route is also shared by a 3/4-mile long concurrency with Route 129, which passes through North Saugus before joining Route 1 to head northward into Lynnfield. Route 99 terminates at Route 1 as well, in the southern end of town. Route 107 passes through the town as the Salem Turnpike through the Rumney Marsh, crossing the Saugus River into Lynn over the Fox Hill Bridge.

The Newburyport/Rockport Line of the MBTA Commuter Rail passes through the southeastern corner of Saugus but does not have a station in Saugus. The town is served by several MBTA bus routes. The nearest airport is Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport.

<text>Swampscott () is a town in Essex County, Massachusetts, United States, located up the coast from Boston in an area known as the North Shore. The population was 15,111 as of the 2020 United States Census. A former summer resort on Massachusetts Bay, Swampscott is today a fairly affluent residential community and includes the village of Beach Bluff, as well as part of the neighborhood of Clifton.

== History ==

The area in and around Swampscott, Massachusetts has been inhabited by indigenous people for 12,000 years. Prior to European colonization, the town was inhabited by members of the Naumkeag, Pennacook, and Pawtucket groups and Massachusett tribe. They spoke an Eastern Algonquin language, and the Pawtucket migrated seasonally throughout the eastern coasts of Massachusetts and Rhode Island. It&#x27;s estimated that 50-100 indigenous individuals resided in the Swampscott area at the time of European colonization. A series of epidemics following European settlement, including smallpox, killed many of the indigenous people living in the area, and it&#x27;s estimated that fewer than 50 individuals remained by the late 17th century.

Wood&#x27;s &quot;New England Prospect&quot; lists &quot;Swampscott&quot; as a noted habitation in 1633 before extensive European settlement. According to an early twentieth century source, the name &quot;Swampscott&quot; is variously said to mean &quot;at the red rock&quot;, &quot;broken waters&quot;, or &quot;pleasant water place&quot;.

Indigenous people in the Swampscott area subsisted on seasonally determined activities, including hunting, fishing, collecting wild plants and shellfish, and horticulture. They hunted deer, marine mammals, upland game birds, and ducks, and cultivated crops like corn, beans, pumpkin, squash, and tobacco.

Swampscott was first colonized by Europeans in 1629 when Francis Ingalls settled there and built the first Massachusetts Bay Colony tannery. Ingalls observed that the town&#x27;s indigenous population lived in wigwams extending from Black Will&#x27;s Cliff along the entire north shore. Swampscott has an important Revolutionary War site: the final home of General John Glover in Vinnin Square. During the War, the property was seized from Loyalist William Browne; Glover bought the land in 1781. The 1750s era Glover farmhouse, embedded in a former restaurant, is threatened with demolition for new development. 
The town was first settled as the eastern part (Ward One) of Lynn, and was set off and officially incorporated in 1852.

In 1867, a piece of the far western end of Salem, then known as the &quot;Salem Finger&quot;, became part of Swampscott. A beach town north of Boston, measuring and abutting Salem, Marblehead and Lynn, Swampscott was an important destination for the wealthy at the beginning of the 20th century. While Revere Beach, which lies just several miles down the road, has the honor of technically being America&#x27;s first public beach, Swampscott was the de facto first resort town. Lynn was the divider between the poor beach and the rich resort town.

==Education==
The community lies within the Swampscott School District.

Swampscott&#x27;s public school system includes one elementary school, Swampscott Elementary School; one middle school, Swampscott Middle School; and one high school, Swampscott High School. The Machon elementary school was shut down in 2007, and is now a mixed-income senior community. After construction of Swampscott Elementary School was completed in 2024, the Hadley Elementary School was shut down. Stanley Elementary School and Clarke Elementary School are also located in Swampscott. A new building was completed in 2007 for Swampscott High School. In 2011, Swampscott considered installing a wind turbine, with the approximate height of a 30-story building, on the property of the Swampscott Middle School, but ultimately rejected the project. In a special election on October 19, 2021, voters approved a new $98 million elementary school to be built on the site of the Stanley School. This new school replaced all former schools and opened to students in September 2024.

<text>Madeline Charlotte Moorman (November 18, 1933 – November 8, 1991) was an American cellist, performance artist, and advocate for avant-garde music. Referred to as the &quot;Jeanne d&#x27;Arc of new music&quot;, she was the founder of the Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York and a frequent collaborator with Korean American artist Nam June Paik.

== Early life ==
Madeline Charlotte Moorman was born on November 18, 1933, in Little Rock, Arkansas. At the age of ten she began to study cello. After her graduation from Little Rock High School in 1951 she had a music scholarship to attend Centenary College in Shreveport, Louisiana. She attained her B.A. in music in 1955. She later attained a M.A. from the University of Texas at Austin and continued on to postgraduate studies at The Juilliard School in 1957 where she received her master&#x27;s degree in cello.

==Career==
Following her studies at Juilliard, Moorman commenced a classical concert hall career as a cellist and joined the American Symphony Orchestra. From 1958 to 1963 she was also a member of Jacob Glick&#x27;s Boccerini Players. However, she was soon drawn into the more experimental performance art scene of the 1960s through her roommate and friend Yoko Ono. When asked during an interview how she had become interested in the avant-garde, Moorman said that one day she had grown [tired] of a Kabalevsky cello piece and someone had suggested that she try playing John Cage&#x27;s &quot;26 Minutes, 1.1499 Seconds for a String Player,&quot; which, among other things, requires the performer to prepare and eat mushrooms.

Moorman befriended and later performed with many well-known artists of the late 20th century, including Paik, Yoko Ono, John Cage, Wolf Vostell, Joseph Beuys, Joseph Byrd, Carolee Schneemann, and Jim McWilliams. This led to her loose involvement with the Fluxus movement of avant-garde performance artists. She later worked closely with many of its protagonists to interpret enigmatic scores written in the open-ended spirit of Fluxus. In 1966, Beuys, then associated with Fluxus, created his work &quot;Infiltration Homogen für Cello,&quot; a felt-covered violoncello, in her honor. However, Moorman, like numerous other female artists including her close friend, Schneemann, was &quot;blacklisted&quot; by Fluxus-organizer George Maciunas for reasons that remain unclear.

===Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York===
In 1963 Moorman founded the Annual Avant Garde Festival of New York, which presented the experimental music of the Fluxus group and Happenings alongside performance, kinetic art, and video art. Despite the event&#x27;s title the festival was not held annually. There were fifteen festivals from 1963 to 1980. In addition, the festivals were often organized at unique locations such as Shea Stadium, Grand Central Station, the World Trade Center, and the Staten Island Ferry.

As well as being a star performer of avant-garde pieces, she was an effective spokesperson and negotiator for advanced art, charming the bureaucracies of New York and other major cities into co-operating and providing facilities for controversial and challenging performances. The years of the Avant Garde Festival marked a period of unparalleled understanding and good relations between advanced artists and local authorities. Friend and artist Jim McWilliams&#x27; created numerous memorable pieces for her to perform at the New York Avant Garde Festivals, including &quot;Sky Kiss&quot; which involved her hanging suspended from helium-filled weather balloons for the Sixth Avant Garde Festival, and &quot;The Intravenous Feeding of Charlotte Moorman&quot; for the 1973 edition.

===Collaborations with Nam June Paik===
At the Second Avant Garde Festival, Moorman convinced Karlheinz Stockhausen to restage his performance piece, &quot;Originale&quot;, using his original collaborator Nam June Paik. This meeting began the decades-long collaboration between Moorman and Paik in which they fused sculpture, performance, music and art. In addition, Paik created many works specifically for Moorman, including &quot;TV Bra for Living Sculpture&quot; (1969) and &quot;TV-Cello&quot; (1971).

On February 9, 1967, Moorman achieved widespread notoriety for her performance of Paik&#x27;s &quot;Opera Sextronique&quot; at the Film-Makers Cinematheque in New York City. For this performance, Moorman was to perform movements on the cello in various states of nudity. In the program for the performance, Paik wrote: &quot;The purge of sex under the excuse of being &#x27;serious&#x27; exactly undermines the so-called &#x27;seriousness&#x27; of music as a classical art, ranking with literature and painting.&quot; During the first movement, Moorman played &quot;Elegy&quot; by the French composer Jules Massenet in the dark while wearing a bikini that had blinking lights. For the second movement, she played &quot;International Lullaby&quot; by Max Mathews while wearing a black skirt, but while being topless, and was arrested mid-performance by three plainclothes police officers. She was not able to return to perform the last two movements of the work. As a result of &quot;Opera Sextronique&quot;, Moorman was charged with indecent exposure, though her penalty was later suspended, and gained nationwide fame as the &quot;topless cellist.&quot; She was also fired from the American Symphony Orchestra. For her court trial, Moorman and Paik restaged and filmed the first two movements of &quot;Opera Sextronique&quot; with the filmmaker Jud Yalkut, though the film was not permitted to be shown in court.

For the 9th Annual New York Avant Garde Festival in 1972, Moorman performed Jim McWilliam’s &quot;A Water Cello for Charlotte Moorman&quot; at South Street Seaport, New York City.

Other collaborations with Paik focused more on humanizing technology and less on sexualizing music. For example, works like &quot;TV Bra for Living Sculpture&quot; (1969), in which two small television sets were attached to Moorman&#x27;s naked breasts while she played cello.

Following Moorman&#x27;s death, Paik made a film entitled &quot;Topless Cellist&quot; (1995) about Moorman&#x27;s life and avant-garde performances.

In 2001, Northwestern University Library acquired her archive. A portion of the archive&#x27;s photographs, scores, props, and costumes were exhibited at the Mary and Leigh Block Museum of Art and the Grey Art Gallery in 2016 and the Museum der Moderne Salzburg in early 2017.

==Death==
In the late 1970s she was diagnosed with breast cancer. She underwent a mastectomy and further treatment, to continue performing through the 1980s in spite of pain and deteriorating health. She died of cancer in New York City on November 8, 1991, aged 57. Following Moorman&#x27;s death, her friend and fellow artist Carolee Schneemann created an online memorial for her.

<text>Maurice Blanchot ( ; ; 22 September 1907 – 20 February 2003) was a French writer, philosopher and literary theorist. His work, exploring a philosophy of death alongside poetic theories of meaning and sense, bore significant influence on post-structuralist philosophers such as Gilles Deleuze, Michel Foucault, Jacques Derrida and Jean-Luc Nancy.

==Biography==
===Pre-1945===
Blanchot was born in the village of Quain (Saône-et-Loire) on 22 September 1907.

Blanchot studied philosophy at the University of Strasbourg, where he became a close friend of the Lithuanian-born French Jewish phenomenologist Emmanuel Levinas. He then embarked on a career as a political journalist in Paris. From 1932 to 1940 he was editor of the mainstream conservative daily the &quot;Journal des débats&quot;. In 1930 he earned his DES (diplôme d&#x27;études supérieures), roughly equivalent to an M.A. at the University of Paris, with a thesis titled &quot;La Conception du Dogmatisme chez les Sceptiques anciens d&#x27;après Sextus Empiricus&quot; (&quot;The Conception of Dogmatism in the Ancient Sceptics According to Sextus Empiricus&quot;).

Early in the 1930s he contributed to a series of radical nationalist magazines while also serving as editor of the fiercely anti-German daily &quot;Le rempart&quot; in 1933 and as editor of Paul Lévy&#x27;s anti-Nazi polemical weekly &quot;Aux écoutes&quot;. In 1936 and 1937 he also contributed to the far right monthly &quot;Combat&quot; and to the nationalist-syndicalist daily &quot;L&#x27;Insurgé&quot;, which eventually ceased publication – largely as a result of Blanchot&#x27;s intervention – because of the anti-semitism of some of its contributors. There is no dispute that Blanchot was nevertheless the author of a series of violently polemical articles attacking the government of the day and its confidence in the politics of the League of Nations, and warned persistently against the threat to peace in Europe posed by Nazi Germany.

In December 1940, he met Georges Bataille, who had written strong anti-fascist articles in the thirties, and who would remain a close friend until his death in 1962. Blanchot worked in Paris during the Nazi occupation. In order to support his family he continued to work as a book reviewer for the &quot;Journal des débats&quot; from 1941 to 1944, writing for instance about such figures as Sartre and Camus, Bataille and Michaux, Mallarmé and Duras for a putatively Pétainist Vichy readership. In these reviews he laid the foundations for later French critical thinking by examining the ambiguous rhetorical nature of language and the irreducibility of the written word to notions of truth or falsity. He refused the editorship of the collaborationist &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot; for which, as part of an elaborate ploy, he had been suggested by Jean Paulhan. He was active in the Resistance and remained a bitter opponent of the fascist, anti-semitic novelist and journalist Robert Brasillach, who was the principal leader of the pro-Nazi collaborationist movement. In June 1944, Blanchot was almost executed by a Nazi firing squad (as recounted in his text &quot;The Instant of My Death&quot;).

===Post-1945===
After the war, Blanchot began working only as a novelist and literary critic. In 1947, Blanchot left Paris for the secluded village of Èze in the south of France, where he spent the next decade of his life. Like Sartre and other French intellectuals of the era, Blanchot avoided the academy as a means of livelihood, instead relying on his pen. Importantly, from 1953 to 1968, he published regularly in &quot;Nouvelle Revue Française&quot;. At the same time, he began a lifestyle of relative isolation, often not seeing close friends (like Levinas) for years, while continuing to write lengthy letters to them. Part of the reason for his self-imposed isolation (and only part of it – his isolation was closely connected to his writing and is often featured among his characters) was the fact that, for most of his life, Blanchot suffered from poor health.

Blanchot&#x27;s political activities after the war shifted to the left. He is widely credited with being one of the main authors of the important &quot;Manifesto of the 121&quot;, named after the number of its signatories, who included Jean-Paul Sartre, Robert Antelme, Alain Robbe-Grillet, Marguerite Duras, René Char, Henri Lefebvre, Alain Resnais, Simone Signoret and others, which supported the rights of conscripts to refuse to serve in the colonial war in Algeria. The manifesto was crucial to the intellectual response to the war.

In May 1968, Blanchot once again emerged from personal obscurity, in support of the student protests. It was his sole public appearance after the war. Yet for fifty years he remained a consistent champion of modern literature and its tradition in French letters. During the later years of his life, he repeatedly wrote against the intellectual attraction to fascism, and notably against Heidegger&#x27;s post-war silence over The Holocaust.

Blanchot wrote more than thirty works of fiction, literary criticism, and philosophy. Up to the 1970s, he worked continually in his writing to break the barriers between what are generally perceived as different &quot;genres&quot; or &quot;tendencies&quot;, and much of his later work moves freely between narration and philosophical investigation.

In 1983, Blanchot published &quot;La Communauté inavouable&quot; (&quot;The Unavowable Community&quot;). This work inspired &quot;The Inoperative Community&quot; (1986), Jean-Luc Nancy&#x27;s attempt to approach community in a non-religious, non-utilitarian and un-political exegesis.

He died on 20 February 2003 in Le Mesnil-Saint-Denis, Yvelines, France.

==Work==
Blanchot&#x27;s work explores a philosophy of death, not in humanistic terms, but through concerns of paradox, impossibility, nonsense and the noumenal that stem from the conceptual impossibility of death. He constantly engaged with the &quot;question of literature&quot;, a simultaneous enactment and interrogation of the idiosyncratic act of writing. For Blanchot, &quot;literature begins at the moment when literature becomes a question&quot;.

Blanchot drew on the poetics of Stéphane Mallarmé and Paul Celan, as well as the concept of negation in the Hegelian dialectic, for his theory of literary language as something that is always anti-realist and so distinct from everyday experience that realism does not simply stand for literature about reality, but for literature concerning paradoxes made by the qualities of the act of writing. Blanchot&#x27;s literary theory parallels Hegel&#x27;s philosophy, establishing that actual reality always succeeds conceptual reality. For instance, &quot;I say flower,&quot; Mallarmé wrote in &quot;Poetry in Crisis&quot;, &quot;and outside the oblivion to which my voice relegates any shape, [...] there arises [...] the one absent from every bouquet.&quot;

What the everyday use of language steps over or negates is the physical reality of the thing for the sake of the abstract concept. Literature - through its use of symbolism and metaphor - frees language from this utilitarianism, thereby drawing attention to the fact that language refers not to the physical thing, but only to an idea of it. Literature, Blanchot writes, remains fascinated by this presence of absence, and attention is drawn, through the sonority and rhythm of words, to the materiality of language.

Blanchot&#x27;s best-known fictional works are &quot;Thomas l&#x27;Obscur&quot; (&quot;Thomas the Obscure&quot;), an unsettling &quot;récit&quot; (which &quot;is not the narration of an event, but that event itself, the approach to that event, the place where that event is made to happen ...&quot;) about the experience of reading and loss, &quot;Death Sentence&quot;, &quot;Aminadab&quot;, and &quot;The Most High&quot;. His central theoretical works are &quot;Literature and the Right to Death&quot; (in &quot;The Work of Fire&quot; and &quot;The Gaze of Orpheus&quot;), &quot;The Space of Literature&quot;, &quot;The Infinite Conversation&quot;, and &quot;The Writing of the Disaster&quot;.

===Themes===
Blanchot engages with Heidegger on the question of how literature and death are both experienced as an anonymous passivity, an experience that Blanchot variously refers to as &quot;the Neutral&quot; (&quot;le neutre&quot;). Unlike Heidegger, Blanchot instead rejects the possibility of an authentic relation to death, &quot;because&quot; he rejects the conceptual possibility of death. In a manner similar to Levinas, who Blanchot later became influenced by with regards to the question of responsibility to the Other, he reverses Heidegger&#x27;s position on death as the &quot;possibility of the absolute impossibility&quot; of Dasein, instead viewing death as the &quot;impossibility of every possibility&quot;.

<doc id="257195" wikidata="Q4909187" url="?curid=257195" title="Bill Gothard">
<text>William W. Gothard Jr. (born November 2, 1934) is an American Christian minister, speaker, and writer, and the founder of the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP), an independent fundamentalist Christian organization.
His conservative teachings encourage Bible memorization, large families, homeschooling, aversion to debt, familial patriarchy, the submission of wives to husbands, and modest attire.

At the height of Gothard&#x27;s popularity during the 1970s and 80s, his Basic Youth Conflicts seminar which became the Basic and Advanced Seminars were regularly filling auditoriums throughout the United States and beyond with attendance figures as large as ten thousand and more for a one-week seminar. In this way, he reached many in the evangelical community. Other seminars during this time included events for pastors, physicians, and legislators.

In 2014, he stepped down from IBLP after 34 women accused him of sexual harassment and molestation, with some incidents allegedly occurring when the victims were minors. In 2016, Gothard and IBLP were sued by a group of alleged victims. The lawsuit was dismissed in 2018, as the statute of limitations had been exceeded.

== Biography ==
Bill Gothard received his BA in biblical studies from Wheaton College, 1957 and then his MA in Christian education in 1961. He completed his Ph.D. in biblical studies at Louisiana Baptist University in 2004.

In 1961, Gothard started Campus Teams, an organization which changed its name to the Institute in Basic Youth Conflicts (IBYC) in 1974. The organization&#x27;s name changed again in 1989 to the Institute in Basic Life Principles (IBLP), of which Gothard was the president and a board member until his resignation in 2014.

In 1984, Gothard founded the Advanced Training Institute (ATI), a homeschooling program with a curriculum based on the Sermon on the Mount.

Gothard had many political connections with Republican political leaders, including Mike Huckabee, Sonny Perdue, and Sarah Palin. His ministry was also popular with the reality TV Duggar family and others. He has never married.

== Teaching ==
Gothard&#x27;s primary teaching, his &quot;Basic Seminar&quot;, focuses on what he refers to as seven &quot;Basic Life Principles&quot;. He teaches that these principles are universal, and that people will suffer consequences for violating them. Gothard&#x27;s principles are called Design, Authority, Responsibility, Suffering, Ownership, Freedom, and Success.

The &quot;umbrella of authority&quot; is the idea that in order to be protected from the devil, one must have absolute obedience to those above them in the chain of authority.

Gothard teaches that dating is morally dangerous and that courtship is the better alternative. Gothard encourages parents to be involved in their children&#x27;s courtship, and that a father should be involved in his daughter&#x27;s relationships, and should at the very least have the right to say &quot;no&quot; when a man asks to marry his daughter. Gothard also advocates conservative dress. Gothard&#x27;s teachings discourage dating and syncopated music, including Christian rock. He has warned that Cabbage Patch dolls are idolatrous.

Gothard has been the subject of much debate in Christian circles, and occasionally in mass media. Various books and articles have challenged Gothard&#x27;s teachings on legalism, law, and grace, and questioned his handling of the IBLP ministry.

== Sexual harassment allegations ==
On February 27, 2014, the board of directors of the Institute in Basic Life Principles placed Gothard on indefinite administrative leave while it investigated claims that he sexually harassed several female employees and volunteers. No criminal activity was uncovered, but an investigation found that Gothard had acted in an &quot;inappropriate manner&quot;. The claims had been publicized on the &quot;Recovering Grace&quot; website, which is a support group for former followers of Gothard&#x27;s teachings. As many as 34 women who worked for Gothard have claimed that he harassed them. Gothard denied the allegations and admitted no wrongdoing but announced his resignation from the Institute in order &quot;to listen to those who have ought against him&quot;.

On June 17, 2014, IBLP issued a statement, summarizing the investigation conducted by &quot;outside legal counsel&quot;. They asserted that although no criminal activity was uncovered, Gothard had acted in an &quot;inappropriate manner&quot; and so &quot;is not permitted to serve in any counseling, leadership, or Board role within the IBLP ministry&quot;. In July 2015, Gothard re-launched his website, including testimonials from several women.

In 2016, Gothard and IBLP were sued by a group of alleged victims who accused him of sexual harassment and assault. The plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their lawsuit in 2018, citing &quot;unique complexities&quot; with the statute of limitations, but emphasized: &quot;We are not recanting our experiences or dismissing the incalculable damage that we believe Gothard has done.&quot;

<text>Welwyn Hatfield is a local government district with borough status in the county of Hertfordshire, England. Its council is based in Welwyn Garden City. The borough borders Hertsmere, St Albans, North Hertfordshire, East Hertfordshire, Broxbourne, and the London Borough of Enfield.

The borough includes the two towns of Welwyn Garden City and Hatfield, along with numerous smaller settlements from Woolmer Green in the north to Cuffley in the south. The borough has six railway stations on the Great Northern Railway; five being on the main line and one on the Hertford loop line. The Digswell Viaduct is a local landmark. The A1 road passes through the borough.

Much of the borough lies within the Metropolitan Green Belt which surrounds London. Welwyn Garden City is notable as being one of only two Garden Cities in the country, and is uniquely both a Garden City and a designated New Town. The University of Hertfordshire has its main campus at Hatfield.

==History==
Welwyn Hatfield was created on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, covering the area of three former districts, which were all abolished at the same time:
*Hatfield Rural District
*Welwyn Garden City Urban District
*Welwyn Rural District

The new district was named Welwyn Hatfield. From 1974 to 2006 the council was called Welwyn Hatfield District Council. The council petitioned for borough status in 2005, allowing the chair of the council to take the title of mayor. The petition was agreed to by the Privy Council and a charter conferring borough status was issued which took effect on 22 May 2006, when John Hawkins was appointed the first mayor and the council&#x27;s name changed to Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council.

==Governance==
Hertfordshire has a two-tier structure of local government, with the ten district councils (including Welwyn Hatfield Borough Council) providing district-level services, and Hertfordshire County Council providing county-level services.

===Political control===
The first election to the council was held in 1973, initially operating as a shadow authority alongside the outgoing authorities until the new system came into force on 1 April 1974. Political control since 1974 has been as follows:
===Leadership===
The role of mayor is largely ceremonial in Welwyn Hatfield, and is usually held by a different councillor each year. Political leadership is instead provided by the leader of the council. The leaders since 2005 have been:

===Composition===
Following the 2024 local elections the composition of the council is as follows:

Since the 2023 local elections the council has been under no overall control. While at the time Conservatives were the largest party, the Liberal Democrats and Labour formed a coalition to take control of the council, with Liberal Democrat group leader Paul Zukowskyj becoming leader of the council and Labour group leader Lynn Chesterman becoming deputy leader of the council. The joint administration continued after the 2024 local elections when Labour became the party with the most seats on the council.

The next elections are due to be held in 2026, where a third of the council&#x27;s seats will be up for election.

==Premises==
The council is based at the Council Offices on The Campus in the centre of Welwyn Garden City, which it inherited from the old Welwyn Garden City Urban District Council. The building was completed in 1937.

==Towns and Parishes==
Welwyn Hatfield contains eight civil parishes. The town of Welwyn Garden City is an unparished area. The parishes are:

*Ayot St Lawrence
*Ayot St Peter
*Essendon
*Hatfield
*North Mymms
*Northaw and Cuffley
*Welwyn
*Woolmer Green
==Elections==

Since the last boundary changes in 2016 the council has comprised 48 councillors representing 16 wards, each of which elects three councillors. Elections are held three years out of every four, electing one councillor from each ward each time. Elections to Hertfordshire County Council are held in the fourth year of the cycle when there are no borough council elections.

===Wards===
The wards of the borough are:

* Brookmans Park &amp; Little Heath
* Haldens
* Handside
* Hatfield Central
* Hatfield East
* Hatfield South West
* Hatfield Villages
* Hollybush
* Howlands
* Northaw and Cuffley
* Panshanger
* Peartree
* Sherrards
* Welham Green and Hatfield South
* Welwyn East
* Welwyn West
===Wider politics===
Most of Welwyn Hatfield borough is within Welwyn Hatfield parliamentary constituency, whose current MP for Welwyn Hatfield is Andrew Lewin of the Labour Party. The constituency&#x27;s boundaries differ from the borough only by the single ward of Northaw and Cuffley being within the borough, but in the parliamentary constituency of Hertsmere, whose current MP is Oliver Dowden of the Conservative Party.

<text>Venture capital (VC) is a form of private equity financing provided by firms or funds to startup, early-stage, and emerging companies, that have been deemed to have high growth potential or that have demonstrated high growth in terms of number of employees, annual revenue, scale of operations, etc. Venture capital firms or funds invest in these early-stage companies in exchange for equity, or an ownership stake. Venture capitalists take on the risk of financing start-ups in the hopes that some of the companies they support will become successful. Because startups face high uncertainty, VC investments have high rates of failure. Start-ups are usually based on an innovative technology or business model and often come from high technology industries such as information technology (IT) or biotechnology.

Pre-seed and seed rounds are the initial stages of funding for a startup company, typically occurring early in its development. During a seed round, entrepreneurs seek investment from angel investors, venture capital firms, or other sources to finance the initial operations and development of their business idea. Seed funding is often used to validate the concept, build a prototype, or conduct market research. This initial capital injection is crucial for startups to kickstart their journey and attract further investment in subsequent funding rounds.

Typical venture capital investments occur after an initial &quot;seed funding&quot; round. The first round of institutional venture capital to fund growth is called the Series A round. Venture capitalists provide this financing in the interest of generating a return through an eventual &quot;exit&quot; event, such as the company selling shares to the public for the first time in an initial public offering (IPO), or disposal of shares happening via a merger, via a sale to another entity such as a financial buyer in the private equity secondary market or via a sale to a trading company such as a competitor.

In addition to angel investing, equity crowdfunding and other seed funding options, venture capital is attractive for new companies with limited operating history that are too small to raise capital in the public markets and have not reached the point where they are able to secure a bank loan or complete a debt offering. In exchange for the high risk that venture capitalists assume by investing in smaller and early-stage companies, venture capitalists usually get significant control over company decisions, in addition to a significant portion of the companies&#x27; ownership (and consequently value). Companies who have reached a market valuation of over $1 billion are referred to as Unicorns. As of May 2024 there were a reported total of 1248 Unicorn companies. Venture capitalists also often provide strategic advice to the company&#x27;s executives on its business model and marketing strategies.

Venture capital is also a way in which the private and public sectors can construct an institution that systematically creates business networks for the new firms and industries so that they can progress and develop. This institution helps identify promising new firms and provide them with finance, technical expertise, mentoring, talent acquisition, strategic partnership, marketing &quot;know-how&quot;, and business models. Once integrated into the business network, these firms are more likely to succeed, as they become &quot;nodes&quot; in the search networks for designing and building products in their domain. However, venture capitalists&#x27; decisions are often biased, exhibiting for instance overconfidence and illusion of control, much like entrepreneurial decisions in general.

==History==
===Origins of modern venture capital===
Before World War II (1939–1945) venture capital was primarily the domain of wealthy individuals and families. J.P. Morgan, the Wallenbergs, the Vanderbilts, the Whitneys, the Rockefellers, and the Warburgs were notable investors in private companies. In 1938, Laurance S. Rockefeller helped finance the creation of both Eastern Air Lines and Douglas Aircraft, and the Rockefeller family had vast holdings in a variety of companies. Eric M. Warburg founded E.M. Warburg &amp; Co. in 1938, which would ultimately become Warburg Pincus, with investments in both leveraged buyouts and venture capital. The Wallenberg family started Investor AB in 1916 in Sweden and were early investors in several Swedish companies such as ABB, Atlas Copco, and Ericsson in the first half of the 20th century.

Only after 1945 did &quot;true&quot; venture capital investment firms begin to emerge, notably with the founding of American Research and Development Corporation (ARDC) and J.H. Whitney &amp; Company in 1946.

Georges Doriot, the &quot;father of venture capitalism&quot;, along with Ralph Flanders and Karl Compton (former president of MIT) founded ARDC in 1946 to encourage private-sector investment in businesses run by soldiers returning from World War II. ARDC became the first institutional private-equity investment firm to raise capital from sources other than wealthy families. Unlike most present-day venture capital firms, ARDC was a publicly traded company. ARDC&#x27;s most successful investment was its 1957 funding of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), which would later be valued at more than $355 million after its initial public offering in 1968. This represented a return of over 1200 times its investment and an annualized rate of return of 101% to ARDC.

Former employees of ARDC went on to establish several prominent venture capital firms including Greylock Partners, founded in 1965 by Charlie Waite and Bill Elfers; Morgan, Holland Ventures, the predecessor of Flagship Ventures, founded in 1982 by James Morgan; Fidelity Ventures, now Volition Capital, founded in 1969 by Henry Hoagland; and Charles River Ventures, founded in 1970 by Richard Burnes. ARDC continued investing until 1971, when Doriot retired. In 1972 Doriot merged ARDC with Textron after having invested in over 150 companies.

John Hay Whitney (1904–1982) and his partner Benno Schmidt (1913–1999) founded J.H. Whitney &amp; Company in 1946. Whitney had been investing since the 1930s, founding Pioneer Pictures in 1933 and acquiring a 15% interest in Technicolor Corporation with his cousin Cornelius Vanderbilt Whitney. Florida Foods Corporation proved Whitney&#x27;s most famous investment. The company developed an innovative method for delivering nutrition to American soldiers, later known as Minute Maid orange juice and was sold to The Coca-Cola Company in 1960. J.H. Whitney &amp; Company continued to make investments in leveraged buyout transactions and raised $750 million for its sixth institutional private-equity fund in 2005.

=== Early venture capital and the beginning of Silicon Valley ===
One of the first steps toward a professionally managed venture capital industry was the passage of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958. The 1958 Act officially allowed the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) to license private &quot;Small Business Investment Companies&quot; (SBICs) to help the financing and management of the small entrepreneurial businesses in the United States. The Small Business Investment Act of 1958 provided tax breaks that helped contribute to the rise of private-equity firms.

During the 1950s, putting a venture capital deal together may have required the help of two or three other organizations to complete the transaction. It was a business that was growing very rapidly, and as the business grew, the transactions grew exponentially. Arthur Rock, one of the pioneers of Silicon Valley during his venturing the Fairchild Semiconductor is often credited with the introduction of the term &quot;venture capitalist&quot; that has since become widely accepted.

During the 1960s and 1970s, venture capital firms focused their investment activity primarily on starting and expanding companies. More often than not, these companies were exploiting breakthroughs in electronic, medical, or data-processing technology. As a result, venture capital came to be almost synonymous with financing of technology ventures. An early West Coast venture capital company was Draper and Johnson Investment Company, formed in 1962 by William Henry Draper III and Franklin P. Johnson, Jr. In 1965, Sutter Hill Ventures acquired the portfolio of Draper and Johnson as a founding action. Bill Draper and Paul Wythes were the founders, and Pitch Johnson formed Asset Management Company at that time.

It was also in the 1960s that the common form of private-equity fund, still in use today, emerged. Private-equity firms organized limited partnerships to hold investments in which the investment professionals served as general partner and the investors, who were passive limited partners, put up the capital. The compensation structure, still in use today, also emerged with limited partners paying an annual management fee of 1.0–2.5% and a carried interest typically representing up to 20% of the profits of the partnership.

The growth of the venture capital industry was fueled by the emergence of the independent investment firms on Sand Hill Road, beginning with Kleiner Perkins and Sequoia Capital in 1972. Located in Menlo Park, California, Kleiner Perkins, Sequoia and later venture capital firms would have access to the many semiconductor companies based in the Santa Clara Valley as well as early computer firms using their devices and programming and service companies. Kleiner Perkins was the first venture capital firm to open an office on Sand Hill Road in 1972.

Throughout the 1970s, a group of private-equity firms, focused primarily on venture capital investments, would be founded that would become the model for later leveraged buyout and venture capital investment firms. In 1973, with the number of new venture capital firms increasing, leading venture capitalists formed the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA). The NVCA was to serve as the industry trade group for the venture capital industry. Venture capital firms suffered a temporary downturn in 1974, when the stock market crashed and investors were naturally wary of this new kind of investment fund.

It was not until 1978 that venture capital experienced its first major fundraising year, as the industry raised approximately $750 million. With the passage of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) in 1974, corporate pension funds were prohibited from holding certain risky investments including many investments in privately held companies. In 1978, the US Labor Department relaxed certain restrictions of the ERISA, under the &quot;prudent man rule&quot;, thus allowing corporate pension funds to invest in the asset class and providing a major source of capital available to venture capitalists.

===1980s and VC involvement in large American companies===
The public successes of the venture capital industry in the 1970s and early 1980s (e.g., Digital Equipment Corporation, Apple Inc., Genentech) gave rise to a major proliferation of venture capital investment firms. From just a few dozen firms at the start of the decade, there were over 650 firms by the end of the 1980s, each searching for the next major &quot;home run&quot;. The number of firms multiplied, and the capital managed by these firms increased from $3 billion to $31 billion over the course of the decade.

The growth of the industry was hampered by sharply declining returns, and certain venture firms began posting losses for the first time. In addition to the increased competition among firms, several other factors affected returns. The market for initial public offerings cooled in the mid-1980s before collapsing after the stock market crash in 1987, and foreign corporations, particularly from Japan and Korea, flooded early-stage companies with capital.

In response to the changing conditions, corporations that had sponsored in-house venture investment arms, including General Electric and Paine Webber either sold off or closed these venture capital units. Additionally, venture capital units within Chemical Bank and Continental Illinois National Bank, among others, began shifting their focus from funding early stage companies toward investments in more mature companies. Even industry founders J.H. Whitney &amp; Company and Warburg Pincus began to transition toward leveraged buyouts and growth capital investments.

===Venture capital boom and the Internet Bubble===
By the end of the 1980s, venture capital returns were relatively low, particularly in comparison with their emerging leveraged buyout cousins, due in part to the competition for hot startups, excess supply of IPOs and the inexperience of many venture capital fund managers. Growth in the venture capital industry remained limited throughout the 1980s and the first half of the 1990s, increasing from $3 billion in 1983 to just over $4 billion more than a decade later in 1994.

The advent of the World Wide Web in the early 1990s reinvigorated venture capital as investors saw companies with huge potential being formed. Netscape and Amazon (company) were founded in 1994, and Yahoo! in 1995. All were funded by venture capital. Internet IPOs—AOL in 1992; Netcom in 1994; UUNet, Spyglass and Netscape in 1995; Lycos, Excite, Yahoo!, CompuServe, Infoseek, C/NET, and E*Trade in 1996; and Amazon, ONSALE, Go2Net, N2K, NextLink, and SportsLine in 1997—generated enormous returns for their venture capital investors. These returns, and the performance of the companies post-IPO, caused a rush of money into venture capital, increasing the number of venture capital funds raised from about 40 in 1991 to more than 400 in 2000, and the amount of money committed to the sector from $1.5 billion in 1991 to more than $90 billion in 2000.

The bursting of the dot-com bubble in 2000 caused many venture capital firms to fail and financial results in the sector to decline.

===2001 Private equity crash===

The Nasdaq crash and technology slump that started in March 2000 shook virtually the entire venture capital industry as valuations for startup technology companies collapsed. Over the next two years, many venture firms had been forced to write-off large proportions of their investments, and many funds were significantly &quot;under water&quot; (the values of the fund&#x27;s investments were below the amount of capital invested). Venture capital investors sought to reduce the size of commitments they had made to venture capital funds, and, in numerous instances, investors sought to unload existing commitments for cents on the dollar in the secondary market. By mid-2003, the venture capital industry had shriveled to about half its 2001 capacity. Nevertheless, PricewaterhouseCoopers&#x27; MoneyTree Survey shows that total venture capital investments held steady at 2003 levels through the second quarter of 2005.

Although the post-boom years represent just a small fraction of the peak levels of venture investment reached in 2000, they still represent an increase over the levels of investment from 1980 through 1995. As a percentage of GDP, venture investment was 0.058% in 1994, peaked at 1.087% (nearly 19 times the 1994 level) in 2000 and ranged from 0.164% to 0.182% in 2003 and 2004. The revival of an Internet-driven environment in 2004 through 2007 helped to revive the venture capital environment. However, as a percentage of the overall private-equity market, venture capital has still not reached its mid-1990s level, let alone its peak in 2000.

Venture capital funds, which were responsible for much of the fundraising volume in 2000 (the height of the dot-com bubble), raised only $25.1 billion in 2006, a 2% decline from 2005 and a significant decline from its peak. The decline continued till their fortunes started to turn around in 2010 with $21.8 billion invested (not raised). The industry continued to show phenomenal growth and in 2020 hit $80 billion in fresh capital.

==Financing==
Obtaining venture capital is substantially different from raising debt or a loan. Lenders have a legal right to interest on a loan and repayment of the capital irrespective of the success or failure of a business. Venture capital is invested in exchange for an equity stake in the business. The return of the venture capitalist as a shareholder depends on the growth and profitability of the business. This return is generally earned when the venture capitalist &quot;exits&quot; by selling its shareholdings when the business is sold to another owner.

Venture capitalists are typically very selective in deciding what to invest in, with a Stanford survey of venture capitalists revealing that 100 companies were considered for every company receiving financing. Ventures receiving financing must demonstrate an excellent management team, a large potential market, and most importantly high growth potential, as only such opportunities are likely capable of providing financial returns and a successful exit within the required time frame (typically 8–12 years) that venture capitalists expect. 

Because investments are illiquid and require the extended time frame to harvest, venture capitalists are expected to carry out detailed due diligence prior to investment. Venture capitalists also are expected to nurture the companies in which they invest, in order to increase the likelihood of reaching an IPO stage when valuations are favourable. Venture capitalists typically assist at four stages in the company&#x27;s development:
* Idea generation;
* Start-up;
* Ramp-up; and
* Exit

Because there are no public exchanges listing their securities, private companies meet venture capital firms and other private-equity investors in several ways, including warm referrals from the investors&#x27; trusted sources and other business contacts; investor conferences and symposia; and summits where companies pitch directly to investor groups in face-to-face meetings, including a variant known as &quot;Speed Venturing&quot;, which is akin to speed-dating for capital, where the investor decides within 10 minutes whether he wants a follow-up meeting. In addition, some new private online networks are emerging to provide additional opportunities for meeting investors.

This need for high returns makes venture funding an expensive capital source for companies, and most suitable for businesses having large up-front capital requirements, which cannot be financed by cheaper alternatives such as debt. That is most commonly the case for intangible assets such as software, and other intellectual property, whose value is unproven. In turn, this explains why venture capital is most prevalent in the fast-growing technology and life sciences or biotechnology fields.

If a company does have the qualities venture capitalists seek including a solid business plan, a good management team, investment and passion from the founders, a good potential to exit the investment before the end of their funding cycle, and target minimum returns in excess of 40% per year, it will find it easier to raise venture capital.

===Financing stages===
There are multiple stages of venture financing offered in venture capital, that roughly correspond to these stages of a company&#x27;s development.
* Pre-seed funding: The earliest round of financing needed to prove a new idea, often provided by friends and family, angel investors, startup accelerators, and sometimes by venture capital funds. Equity crowdfunding is also emerging as an option for seed funding.
* Early Stage: Early stage funding includes Seed and Series A financing rounds. Companies use this capital to find product-market fit.
* Growth Capital: Once companies have found product-market fit, companies will use growth capital to scale the business. These are typically larger financing rounds with have higher valuations because the companies have started to prove traction and de-risk the investment. Growth capital typically includes Series B, Series C, and later rounds. 
* Exit of venture capitalist: VCs can exit through secondary sale or an initial public offering (IPO) or an acquisition. Early stage VCs may exit in later rounds when new investors (VCs or private-equity investors) buy the shares of existing investors. Sometimes a company very close to an IPO may allow some VCs to exit and instead new investors may come in hoping to profit from the IPO.
* Bridge financing is when a startup seeks funding in between full VC rounds. The objective is to raise a smaller amount of money to &quot;bridge&quot; the gap when current funds are expected to run out prior to planned future funding, intended to meet short-term working capital needs.

In early stage and growth stage financings, venture-backed companies may also seek to take venture debt.

==Firms and funds==
===Venture capitalist===

A venture capitalist, or sometimes simply called a capitalist, is a person who makes capital investments in companies in exchange for an equity stake. The venture capitalist is often expected to bring managerial and technical expertise, as well as capital, to their investments. A venture capital fund refers to a pooled investment vehicle (in the United States, often an LP or LLC) that primarily invests the financial capital of third-party investors in enterprises that are too risky for the standard capital markets or bank loans. These funds are typically managed by a venture capital firm, which often employs individuals with technology backgrounds (scientists, researchers), business training and/or deep industry experience.

A core skill within VCs is the ability to identify novel or disruptive technologies that have the potential to generate high commercial returns at an early stage. By definition, VCs also take a role in managing entrepreneurial companies at an early stage, thus adding skills as well as capital, thereby differentiating VC from buy-out private equity, which typically invest in companies with proven revenue, and thereby potentially realizing much higher rates of returns. Inherent in realizing abnormally high rates of returns is the risk of losing all of one&#x27;s investment in a given startup company. As a consequence, most venture capital investments are done in a pool format, where several investors combine their investments into one large fund that invests in many different startup companies. By investing in the pool format, the investors are spreading out their risk to many different investments instead of taking the chance of putting all of their money in one start up firm.

===Structure===

Venture capital firms are typically structured as partnerships, the general partners of which serve as the managers of the firm and will serve as investment advisors to the venture capital funds raised. Venture capital firms in the United States may also be structured as limited liability companies, in which case the firm&#x27;s managers are known as managing members. Investors in venture capital funds are known as limited partners. This constituency comprises both high-net-worth individuals and institutions with large amounts of available capital, such as state and private pension funds, university financial endowments, foundations, insurance companies, and pooled investment vehicles, called funds of funds.

===Types===
Venture capitalist firms differ in their motivations and approaches. There are multiple factors, and each firm is different.

Venture capital funds are generally three in types:

* 1. Angel investors 
* 2. Financial VCs 
* 3. Strategic VCs

Some of the factors that influence VC decisions include:
* Business situation: Some VCs tend to invest in new, disruptive ideas, or fledgling companies. Others prefer investing in established companies that need support to go public or grow.
* Some invest solely in certain industries.
* Some prefer operating locally while others will operate nationwide or even globally.
* VC expectations can often vary. Some may want a quicker public sale of the company or expect fast growth. The amount of help a VC provides can vary from one firm to the next. There are also estimates on how big of an exit a VC will expect for the company (i.e. if the size of the VC fund is $20M, estimate that they will at least want the company to exit for the size of the fund).

===Roles===
Within the venture capital industry, the general partners and other investment professionals of the venture capital firm are often referred to as &quot;venture capitalists&quot; or &quot;VCs&quot;. Typical career backgrounds vary, but, broadly speaking, venture capitalists come from either an operational or a finance background. Venture capitalists with an operational background (operating partner) tend to be former founders or executives of companies similar to those which the partnership finances or will have served as management consultants. Venture capitalists with finance backgrounds tend to have investment banking or other corporate finance experience.

Although the titles are not entirely uniform from firm to firm, other positions at venture capital firms include:

===Structure of the funds===

The average maturity of most venture capital funds ranges from 10 years to 12 years, with the possibility of a few years of extensions to allow for private companies still seeking liquidity. The investing cycle for most funds is generally three to five years, after which the focus is managing and making follow-on investments in an existing portfolio. This model was pioneered by successful funds in Silicon Valley through the 1980s to invest in technological trends broadly but only during their period of ascendance, and to cut exposure to management and marketing risks of any individual firm or its product.

In such a fund, the investors have a fixed commitment to the fund that is initially unfunded and subsequently &quot;called down&quot; by the venture capital fund over time as the fund makes its investments. There are substantial penalties for a limited partner (or investor) that fails to participate in a capital call.

It can take anywhere from a month to several years for venture capitalists to raise money from limited partners for their fund. At the time when all of the money has been raised, the fund is said to be closed and the 10-year lifetime begins. Some funds have partial closes when one half (or some other amount) of the fund has been raised. The vintage year generally refers to the year in which the fund was closed and may serve as a means to stratify VC funds for comparison.

From an investor&#x27;s point of view, funds can be: (1) traditional—where all the investors invest with equal terms; or (2) asymmetric—where different investors have different terms. Typically asymmetry is seen in cases where investors have opposing interests, such as the need to not have unrelated business taxable income in the case of public tax-exempt investors.

=== Investment Decision Process ===
The decision process to fund a company is elusive. One study report in the &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; states that VCs rarely use standard financial analytics. First, VCs engage in a process known as &quot;generating deal flow,&quot; where they reach out to their network to source potential investments. The study also reported that few VCs use any type of financial analytics when they assess deals; VCs are primarily concerned about the cash returned from the deal as a multiple of the cash invested. According to 95% of the VC firms surveyed, VCs cite the founder or founding team as the most important factor in their investment decision. Other factors are also considered, including intellectual property rights and the state of the economy. Some argue that the most important thing a VC looks for in a company is high-growth.

The funding decision process has spawned bias in the form of a large disparity between the funding received by men and minority groups, such as women and people of color. In 2021, female founders only received 2% of VC funding in the United States. Some research studies have found that VCs evaluate women differently and are less likely to fund female founders.

===Compensation===

Venture capitalists are compensated through a combination of management fees and carried interest (often referred to as a &quot;two and 20&quot; arrangement):

Because a fund may run out of capital prior to the end of its life, larger venture capital firms usually have several overlapping funds at the same time; doing so lets the larger firm keep specialists in all stages of the development of firms almost constantly engaged. Smaller firms tend to thrive or fail with their initial industry contacts; by the time the fund cashes out, an entirely new generation of technologies and people is ascending, whom the general partners may not know well, and so it is prudent to reassess and shift industries or personnel rather than attempt to simply invest more in the industry or people the partners already know.

===Alternatives===

Because of the strict requirements venture capitalists have for potential investments, many entrepreneurs seek seed funding from angel investors, who may be more willing to invest in highly speculative opportunities, or may have a prior relationship with the entrepreneur. Additionally, entrepreneurs may seek alternative financing, such as revenue-based financing, to avoid giving up equity ownership in the business. For entrepreneurs seeking more than just funding, startup studios can be an appealing alternative to venture capitalists, as they provide operational support and an experienced team.

Furthermore, many venture capital firms will only seriously evaluate an investment in a start-up company otherwise unknown to them if the company can prove at least some of its claims about the technology and/or market potential for its product or services. To achieve this, or even just to avoid the dilutive effects of receiving funding before such claims are proven, many start-ups seek to self-finance sweat equity until they reach a point where they can credibly approach outside capital providers such as venture capitalists or angel investors. This practice is called &quot;bootstrapping&quot;.

Equity crowdfunding is emerging as an alternative to traditional venture capital. Traditional crowdfunding is an approach to raising the capital required for a new project or enterprise by appealing to large numbers of ordinary people for small donations. While such an approach has long precedents in the sphere of charity, it is receiving renewed attention from entrepreneurs, now that social media and online communities make it possible to reach out to a group of potentially interested supporters at very low cost. Some equity crowdfunding models are also being applied specifically for startup funding, such as those listed at Comparison of crowd funding services. One of the reasons to look for alternatives to venture capital is the problem of the traditional VC model. The traditional VCs are shifting their focus to later-stage investments, and return on investment of many VC funds have been low or negative.

In Europe and India, Media for equity is a partial alternative to venture capital funding. Media for equity investors are able to supply start-ups with often significant advertising campaigns in return for equity. In Europe, an investment advisory firm offers young ventures the option to exchange equity for services investment; their aim is to guide ventures through the development stage to arrive at a significant funding, mergers and acquisition, or other exit strategy.

In industries where assets can be securitized effectively because they reliably generate future revenue streams or have a good potential for resale in case of foreclosure, businesses may more cheaply be able to raise debt to finance their growth. Good examples would include asset-intensive extractive industries such as mining, or manufacturing industries. Offshore funding is provided via specialist venture capital trusts, which seek to use securitization in structuring hybrid multi-market transactions via an SPV (special purpose vehicle): a corporate entity that is designed solely for the purpose of the financing.

In addition to traditional venture capital and angel networks, groups have emerged, which allow groups of small investors or entrepreneurs themselves to compete in a privatized business plan competition where the group itself serves as the investor through a democratic process.

Law firms are also increasingly acting as an intermediary between clients seeking venture capital and the firms providing it.

Other forms include venture resources that seek to provide non-monetary support to launch a new venture.

==Role in employment==

Every year, there are nearly 2 million businesses created in the US, but only 600–800 get venture capital funding. According to the National Venture Capital Association, 11% of private sector jobs come from venture-backed companies and venture-backed revenue accounts for 21% of US GDP.

== Gender disparities ==
In 2020, female-founded companies raised 2.8% of capital investment from venture capital, the highest amount recorded. Babson College&#x27;s Diana Report found that the number of women partners in VC firms decreased from 10% in 1999 to 6% in 2014. The report also found that 97% of VC-funded businesses had male chief executives, and that businesses with all-male teams were more than four times as likely to receive VC funding compared to teams with at least one woman. 

Currently, about 3% of all venture capital is going to woman-led companies. More than 75% of VC firms in the US did not have any female venture capitalists at the time they were surveyed. It was found that a greater fraction of VC firms had never had a woman represent them on the board of one of their portfolio companies. For comparison, a UC Davis study focusing on large public companies in California found 49.5% with at least one female board seat. 

==Geographical differences==
Venture capital, as an industry, originated in the United States, and American firms have traditionally been the largest participants in venture deals with the bulk of venture capital being deployed in American companies. However, increasingly, non-US venture investment is growing, and the number and size of non-US venture capitalists have been expanding.

Venture capital has been used as a tool for economic development in a variety of developing regions. In many of these regions, with less developed financial sectors, venture capital plays a role in facilitating access to finance for small and medium enterprises (SMEs), which in most cases would not qualify for receiving bank loans.

In the year of 2008, while VC funding were still majorly dominated by U.S. money ($28.8 billion invested in over 2550 deals in 2008), compared to international fund investments ($13.4 billion invested elsewhere), there has been an average 5% growth in the venture capital deals outside the US, mainly in China and Europe. Geographical differences can be significant. For instance, in the UK, 4% of British investment goes to venture capital, compared to about 33% in the U.S.

VC funding has been shown to be positively related to a country&#x27;s individualistic culture. According to economist Jeffrey Funk however more than 90% of US startups valued over $1 billion lost money between 2019–2020 and return on investment from VC barely exceed return from public stock markets over the last 25 years.

===United States===

In the United States, venture capital investing reached $209.4 billion in 2022, the second-highest investment year in history.

Venture capitalists invested some $29.1 billion in 3,752 deals in the U.S. through the fourth quarter of 2011, according to a report by the National Venture Capital Association. The same numbers for all of 2010 were $23.4 billion in 3,496 deals.

According to a report by Dow Jones VentureSource, venture capital funding fell to $6.4 billion in the US in the first quarter of 2013, an 11.8% drop from the first quarter of 2012, and a 20.8% decline from 2011. Venture firms have added $4.2 billion into their funds this year, down from $6.3 billion in the first quarter of 2013, but up from $2.6 billion in the fourth quarter of 2012.

===Canada===
Canadian technology companies have attracted interest from the global venture capital community partially as a result of generous tax incentive through the Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&amp;ED) investment tax credit program. The basic incentive available to any Canadian corporation performing R&amp;D is a refundable tax credit that is equal to 20% of &quot;qualifying&quot; R&amp;D expenditures (labour, material, R&amp;D contracts, and R&amp;D equipment). An enhanced 35% refundable tax credit of available to certain (i.e. small) Canadian-controlled private corporations (CCPCs). Because the CCPC rules require a minimum of 50% Canadian ownership in the company performing R&amp;D, foreign investors who would like to benefit from the larger 35% tax credit must accept minority position in the company, which might not be desirable. The SR&amp;ED program does not restrict the export of any technology or intellectual property that may have been developed with the benefit of SR&amp;ED tax incentives.

Canada also has a fairly unusual form of venture capital generation in its labour-sponsored venture capital corporations (LSVCC). These funds, also known as Retail Venture Capital or Labour Sponsored Investment Funds (LSIF), are generally sponsored by labor unions and offer tax breaks from government to encourage retail investors to purchase the funds. Generally, these Retail Venture Capital funds only invest in companies where the majority of employees are in Canada. However, innovative structures have been developed to permit LSVCCs to direct in Canadian subsidiaries of corporations incorporated in jurisdictions outside of Canada. In 2022, the Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector closed around 50% of Canada&#x27;s venture capital deals, 16% were in the Life Sciences.

===Mexico===
The Venture Capital industry in Mexico is a fast-growing sector in the country that, with the support of institutions and private funds, is estimated to reach US$100 billion invested by 2018.

=== Australia and New Zealand ===

In Australia and New Zealand, there have been 3 waves of VC, starting with Bill Ferris who founded IVC in 1970. are more than one hundred active VC funds, syndicates, or angel investors making VC-style investments. The 2nd wave was led by Starfish &amp; Southern Cross VC, with the latter producing the leading VC of the 3rd wave, Blackbird. There was a boom in 2018, and today there are more than one hundred active VC funds, syndicates, or angel investors making VC-style investments. There have been few Nasdaq IPOs of Australian VC backed startups, with only Looksmart from Bill Ferris&#x27;s fund, and Quantenna from Larry Marshall&#x27;s Southern Cross VC, but Blackbird is expected to IPO Canva soon.

The State of Startup Funding report found that in 2021, over AUD $10 billion AUD was invested into Australian and New Zealand startups across 682 deals. This represents a 3x increase from the $3.1 billion that was invested in 2020.

Some notable Australian and New Zealand startup success stories include graphic design company Canva, financial services provider Airwallex, New Zealand payments provider Vend (acquired by Lightspeed), rent-to-buy company OwnHome, and direct-to-consumer propositions such as Eucalyptus (a house of direct-to-consumer telehealth brands), and Lyka (a pet wellness company).

In 2022, the largest Australian funds are Blackbird Ventures, Square Peg Capital, and Airtree Ventures. These three funds have more than $1 billion AUD under management across multiple funds. These funds have funding from institutional capital, including AustralianSuper and Hostplus, family offices, and sophisticated individual high-net-wealth investors.

Outside of the &#x27;Big 3&#x27;, other notable institutional funds include AfterWork Ventures, Artesian, Folklore Ventures, Equity Venture Partners, Our Innovation Fund, Investible, Main Sequence Ventures (the VC arm of the CSIRO), OneVentures, Proto Axiom, and Tenacious Ventures.

As the number of capital providers in the Australian and New Zealand ecosystem has grown, funds have started to specialise and innovate to differentiate themselves. For example, Tenacious Ventures is a $35 million specialised agritech fund, while AfterWork Ventures is a &#x27;community-powered fund&#x27; that has coalesced a group of 120 experienced operators from across Australia&#x27;s startups and tech companies. Its community is invested in its fund, and lean into assist with sourcing and evaluating deal opportunities, as well as supporting companies post-investment.

Several Australian corporates have corporate VC arms, including NAB Ventures, Reinventure (associated with Westpac), IAG Firemark Ventures, and Telstra Ventures.

=== Europe ===
Leading early-stage venture capital investors in Europe include Mark Tluszcz of Mangrove Capital Partners and Danny Rimer of Index Ventures, both of whom were named on &quot;Forbes&quot; Magazine&#x27;s Midas List of the world&#x27;s top dealmakers in technology venture capital in 2007. In 2020, the first Italian Venture capital Fund named Primo Space was launched by Primomiglio SGR. This fund first closed €58 million out a target €80 million and is focused on Space investing.

Comparing the EU market to the United States, in 2020 venture capital funding was seven times lower, the EU having less unicorns. This hampers the EU&#x27;s transformation into a green and digital economy.

As of 2024, tighter financial conditions have harmed venture capital funding in the European Union, which remains undeveloped in comparison to the United States.

The EU lags significantly behind the US and China in venture capital investments, with the EU capturing only 5% of global venture capital compared to 52% in the US and 40% in China. Venture capital funds in the EU account for just 5% of the global total, whereas those in the United States and China secure 52% and 40%, respectively. The financing gap for EU scale-ups is significant, with companies raising 50% less capital than those in Silicon Valley. This disparity exists across industries and is unaffected by the business cycle or year of establishment.

The European Green Deal has fostered policies that contributed to a 30% rise in venture capital specifically for greentech companies in the EU from 2021 to 2023, despite a downturn in other sectors during the same period.

===Nordic countries===
Recent years have seen a revival of the Nordic venture scene with more than €3 billion raised by VC funds in the Nordic region over the last five years. Over the past five years, a total of €2.7 billion has been invested into Nordic startups. Known Nordic early-stage venture capital funds include NorthZone (Sweden), Maki.vc (Finland) and ByFounders (Copenhagen).

===Switzerland===
Many Swiss start-ups are university spin-offs, in particular from its federal institutes of technology in Lausanne and Zurich.
According to a study by the London School of Economics analysing 130 ETH Zurich spin-offs over 10 years, about 90% of these start-ups survived the first five critical years, resulting in an average annual IRR of more than 43%.
Switzerland&#x27;s most active early-stage investors are The Zurich Cantonal Bank, investiere.ch, Swiss Founders Fund, as well as a number of angel investor clubs. In 2022, half of the total amount of CHF 4 billion investments went to the ICT and Fintech sectors, whereas 21% was invested in Cleantech.

=== Poland ===

As of March 2019, there are 130 active VC firms in Poland which have invested locally in over 750 companies, an average of 9 companies per portfolio. Since 2016, new legal institutions have been established for entities implementing investments in enterprises in the seed or startup phase. In 2018, venture capital funds invested in Polish startups (0.033% of GDP). As of March 2019, total assets managed by VC companies operating in Poland are estimated at . The total value of investments of the Polish VC market is worth .

=== Bulgaria ===
The Bulgarian venture capital industry has been growing rapidly in the past decade. As of the beginning of 2021, there are 18 VC and growth equity firms on the local market, with the total funding available for technology startups exceeding €200M. According to BVCA – Bulgarian Private Equity and Venture Capital Association, 59 transactions of total value of €29.4 million took place in 2020. Most of the venture capital investments in Bulgaria are concentrated in the seed and Series A stages. Sofia-based LAUNCHub Ventures recently launched one of the biggest funds in the region, with a target size of €70 million.

===Asia===

South Korea has been undergoing an investment boom over the last ten years, peaking at US$10 billion in 2021. The Korean government and mega-corporations such as Kakao, Smilegate, SK, and Lotte has been behind much of the funding, backing both venture firms and accelerators, but new venture capitalists are in dire straits as they announce a 40% cut in financing in 2024.

India is catching up with the West in the field of venture capital and a number of venture capital funds have a presence in the country (IVCA). In 2006, the total amount of private equity and venture capital in India reached $7.5 billion across 299 deals. In the Indian market, venture capital consists of investing in equity, quasi-equity, or conditional loans in order to promote unlisted, high-risk, or high-tech firms driven by technically or professionally qualified entrepreneurs. It is also used to refer to investors &quot;providing seed&quot;, &quot;start-up and first-stage financing&quot;, or financing companies that have demonstrated extraordinary business potential. Venture capital refers to capital investment; equity and debt; both of which carry indubitable risk. The anticipated risk is very high. The venture capital industry follows the concept of &quot;high risk, high return&quot;, innovative entrepreneurship, knowledge-based ideas and human capital intensive enterprises have become common as venture capitalists invest in risky finance to encourage innovation. A large portion of funding from startups in India arise from Foreign Venture Capital Funds such as Sequoia, Accel, Tiger Global, SoftBank, etc.

China is also starting to develop a venture capital industry (CVCA).

Vietnam is experiencing its first foreign venture capitals, including IDG Venture Vietnam ($100 million) and DFJ Vinacapital ($35 million).

Singapore is widely recognized and featured as one of the hottest places to both start up and invest, mainly due to its healthy ecosystem, its strategic location and connectedness to foreign markets. With 100 deals valued at US$3.5 billion, Singapore saw a record value of PE and VC investments in 2016. The number of PE and VC investments increased substantially over the last 5 years: In 2015, Singapore recorded 81 investments with an aggregate value of US$2.2 billion while in 2014 and 2013, PE and VC deal values came to US$2.4 billion and US$0.9 billion respectively. With 53 percent, tech investments account for the majority of deal volume.

Moreover, Singapore is home to two of South-East Asia&#x27;s largest unicorns. Garena is reportedly the highest-valued unicorn in the region with a US$3.5 billion price tag, while Grab is the highest-funded, having raised a total of US$1.43 billion since its incorporation in 2012.

Start-ups and small businesses in Singapore receive support from policymakers and the local government fosters the role VCs play to support entrepreneurship in Singapore and the region. For instance, in 2016, Singapore&#x27;s National Research Foundation (NRF) has given out grants up to around $30 million to four large local enterprises for investments in startups in the city-state. This first of its kind partnership NRF has entered into is designed to encourage these enterprises to source for new technologies and innovative business models.

Currently, the rules governing VC firms are being reviewed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) to make it easier to set up funds and increase funding opportunities for start-ups. This mainly includes simplifying and shortening the authorization process for new venture capital managers and to study whether existing incentives that have attracted traditional asset managers here will be suitable for the VC sector. A public consultation on the proposals was held in January 2017 with changes expected to be introduced by July.

In recent years, Singapore&#x27;s focus in venture capital investments has geared more towards more early stage, deep tech startups, with the government launching SGInnovate in 2016 to support the development of deep tech startups. Deep tech startups aim to address significant scientific problems. Singapore&#x27;s tech startup scene has grown in recent years, and the city-state ranked seventh in the latest Global Innovation Index 2022. For the first nine months of 2022, investments up to Series B rounds amounted to $5.5 billion Singapore dollars ($4 billion), an increase of 14% by volume and 45% by value, according to data from government agency Enterprise Singapore.

===Middle East and North Africa===
The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) venture capital industry is an early stage of development but growing. According to &quot;H1 2019 MENA Venture Investment Report&quot; by MAGNiTT, 238 startup investment deals have taken place in the region in the first half of 2019, totaling in $471 million in investments. Compared to 2018&#x27;s H1 report, this represents an increase of 66% in total funding and 28% in number of deals.

According to the report, the UAE is the most active ecosystem in the region with 26% of the deals made in H1, followed by Egypt at 21%, and Lebanon at 13%. In terms of deals by sector, fintech remains the most active industry with 17% of the deals made, followed by e-commerce at 12%, and delivery and transport at 8%.

The report also notes that a total of 130 institutions invested in MENA-based startups in H1 2019, 30% of which were headquartered outside the MENA, demonstrating international appetite for investments in the region. 15 startup exits have been recorded in H1 2019, with Careem&#x27;s $3.1 billion acquisition by Uber being the first unicorn exit in the region. Other notable exits include Souq.com exit to Amazon in 2017 for $650 million.

===Israel===
In Israel, high-tech entrepreneurship and venture capital have flourished well beyond the country&#x27;s relative size. As it has very little natural resources and, historically has been forced to build its economy on knowledge-based industries, its VC industry has rapidly developed, and nowadays has about 70 active venture capital funds, of which 14 international VCs with Israeli offices, and additional 220 international funds which actively invest in Israel. In addition, as of 2010, Israel led the world in venture capital invested per capita. Israel attracted $170 per person compared to $75 in the US. About two thirds of the funds invested were from foreign sources, and the rest domestic. In 2013, Wix.com joined 62 other Israeli firms on the Nasdaq.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===

The Southern African venture capital industry is developing. The South African Government and Revenue Service is following the international trend of using tax-efficient vehicles to propel economic growth and job creation through venture capital. Section 12 J of the &quot;Income Tax Act&quot; was updated to include venture capital. Companies are allowed to use a tax-efficient structure similar to VCTs in the UK. Despite the above structure, the government needs to adjust its regulation around intellectual property, exchange control and other legislation to ensure that Venture capital succeeds.

Currently, there are not many venture capital funds in operation and it is a small community; however, the number of venture funds are steadily increasing with new incentives slowly coming in from government. Funds are difficult to come by and due to the limited funding, companies are more likely to receive funding if they can demonstrate initial sales or traction and the potential for significant growth. The majority of the venture capital in Sub-Saharan Africa is centered on South Africa and Kenya.

Entrepreneurship is a key to growth. Governments will need to ensure business friendly regulatory environments in order to help foster innovation. In 2019, venture capital startup funding grew to 1.3 billion dollars, increasing rapidly. The causes are as of yet unclear, but education is certainly a factor.

==Confidential information==
Unlike public companies, information regarding an entrepreneur&#x27;s business is typically confidential and proprietary. As part of the due diligence process, most venture capitalists will require significant detail with respect to a company&#x27;s business plan. Entrepreneurs must remain vigilant about sharing information with venture capitalists that are investors in their competitors. Most venture capitalists treat information confidentially, but as a matter of business practice, they do not typically enter into Non Disclosure Agreements because of the potential liability issues those agreements entail. Entrepreneurs are typically well advised to protect truly proprietary intellectual property. Startups commonly use a data room to securely share this information with potential investors during the due diligence process.

Limited partners of venture capital firms typically have access only to limited amounts of information with respect to the individual portfolio companies in which they are invested and are typically bound by confidentiality provisions in the fund&#x27;s limited partnership agreement.

==Governmental regulations==
There are several strict guidelines regulating those that deal in venture capital. Namely, they are not allowed to advertise or solicit business in any form as per the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission guidelines.

==In popular culture==

<doc id="257211" wikidata="Q4998570" url="?curid=257211" title="Burgerville">
<text>Burgerville (originally Burgerville USA) is a privately held American restaurant chain in Oregon and southwest Washington, owned by The Holland Inc. As the chain&#x27;s name suggests, Burgerville&#x27;s sandwich menu consists mostly of hamburgers. As of May 2005, all Burgerville locations were within a 180-mile (290-km) radius, mostly in the Portland metropolitan area. The chain had annual revenue of around $75 million in 2010, at which time it had 39 locations and about 1,500 employees.

In addition to burgers and fries, Burgerville offers other products such as chicken and turkey sandwiches, veggie burgers, fish sandwiches, and fish and chips. The chain uses local ingredients, such as Tillamook Cheddar, and locally grown strawberries in its milkshakes and sundaes. Throughout the year it offers seasonal items such as milkshakes made with hazelnuts, pumpkin, fresh raspberries, fresh strawberries, and blackberries, and side orders such as Walla Walla onion rings, sweet potato fries, tempura-style fried asparagus and Yukon Gold potatoes.

==History==

Burgerville was founded in 1961 by George Propstra in Vancouver, Washington. The first Burgerville was located on Mill Plain Blvd in Vancouver, about three miles east of downtown on the southeast corner of Mill Plain and Morrison.

The chain uses 100% wind power for all of its restaurants and headquarters, and is the largest chain in America to do so. Burgerville uses only trans fat-free canola oil and sends 7,500 gallons per month to be transformed into biodiesel. In 2004, Burgerville switched to range-fed beef raised without hormones and antibiotics. In 2007, it began composting food waste which is expected to result in an 85% reduction in waste and $100,000 annual savings.

In September 2009, after complaints from bicycle commuters, Burgerville began allowing bicyclists to order using its drive-through windows .

The fast casual restaurant chain was named by &quot;Gourmet&quot; magazine as having the freshest fast food in the country in 2003, with offerings such as a salad with smoked salmon and Oregon hazelnuts. As of August 2007, their slogan is, &quot;Choose Fresh, Local, Sustainable. Choose Burgerville.&quot; Also in 2007, Burgerville was awarded with the &quot;Better Burger&quot; award at the 1st Annual Food Network Awards.

In January 2008, Jeff Harvey accepted the position of President and CEO of Burgerville after Tom Mears, the former holder of the titles stepped aside, and became Chairman of the company.

In October 2018, Burgerville disclosed that it had suffered a data breach by the Fin7 hacking group of all customer credit and debit card information processed from September 2017 to September 2018.

===Burgerville Workers Union===
In April 2016, Burgerville workers organized and formed a labor union, the Burgerville Workers Union, with support from Portland IWW, among other groups. The company opposed the union organizing effort and sought to discourage workers from joining. In 2018, the workers of one Burgerville restaurant in southeast Portland voted 18-4 in an NLRB-administered election to form a labor union; the vote compels the company to officially recognize the Burgerville Workers Union (BVWU) and to collectively bargain with it. The BVWU is the only fast food union in the United States with federal recognition.

The union has demanded a $5 an hour increase in wages for all workers, fair scheduling, improved health care, and parental leave. In October, 2019, the workers union was preparing to strike following a breakdown of negotiations with the company over the previous 18 months. The company had offered an increase of $1 per hour for all employees to $13.50, six months ahead of when Portland&#x27;s local minimum was set to increase to $13.25.

As of October 2019, five Burgerville locations have held successful union drives.

== Locations ==
As of October 2016, Burgerville had 47 locations throughout Oregon and Washington.

On major highways leaving Burgerville&#x27;s reach, there is usually a billboard resembling an overhead highway warning sign alerting drivers that there will not be another Burgerville location for approximately another 24,700 miles (39,750 km), which is the distance to the next Burgerville should one continue around the globe in that direction. The distance reported on each sign varies depending on the actual location of the billboard.

<text>Millbank is an area of central London in the City of Westminster. Millbank is located by the River Thames, east of Pimlico and south of Westminster. Millbank is known as the location of major government offices, Burberry headquarters, the Millbank Tower and prominent art institutions such as Tate Britain and the Chelsea College of Art and Design.

==History==

The area derives its name from a watermill owned by Westminster Abbey that once stood at a site close to present day College Green. Norden&#x27;s survey, taken during the reign of Elizabeth I in 1573, records the existence of such a mill although much of the area that comprises Millbank today, was referred to by Samuel Pepys and others as Tothill Fields. Described as a place of plague pits and a &quot;low, marshy locality&quot; suitable for shooting snipe in the nearby &quot;bogs and quagmires&quot;.

After Cromwell&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Worcester in September 1651, some 4,000 defeated Royalists were imprisoned at Tothill Fields prior to being sold as slaves to merchants trading with Africa and the West Indies. Facilities at the prison camp on the marshy ground were so poor that 1,200 prisoners were recorded as having died in the primitive conditions.

Prior to the development of Millbank Prison in 1816, the area was sparsely covered with residential houses, but did feature a distillery by the river owned by a Mr. Hodge and numerous small almshouses, bridewells and pest houses for the poor, criminally inclined and sick. Baltic Wharf, a site just to the north of Vauxhall Bridge, was for much of the 19th century the location of a Henry Castle &amp; Son, a ship breaking and timber merchant. Numerous wooden ships of the line of the Royal Navy were dismantled at this location, their ornate figureheads often displayed on the gates and perimeter of the yard walls.

Millbank&#x27;s general appearance today dates from the 1930s, when the area was extensively rebuilt to repair damage caused by the 1928 Thames flood disaster, following the collapse of a 25-metre-long section of the Thames Embankment. Millbank shares the name of the main road (A3212) along the north bank of the River Thames, extending northwards from Vauxhall Bridge to Abingdon Street, just south from Parliament Square. There are parliamentary offices situated across this road, notably No.7, built as the headquarters of British American Tobacco. The road was created as part of the Thames Embankment in the mid 19th century and lies above a large interceptor sewer.

The former Royal Army Medical College, situated at Millbank, is the site where the vaccine for typhoid was first developed, and in the late 19th century, was where the world&#x27;s first modern prison (Millbank Prison) was established. The listed site has since been renovated as a purpose-built arts college for the Chelsea College of Art and Design in 2005. The Tate Britain art gallery (former Tate Gallery) is directly opposite near the end of Vauxhall Bridge, providing a distinct arts presence in the area.

The headquarters of the British chemicals giant ICI was originally located at Imperial Chemical House on Millbank (The Smith Square entrance of which was called Nobel House) before it relocated to Manchester Square, also situated in London. The headquarters for the Northern Ireland Office, MI5 and Thames House are also nearby.

On 18 December 1973, the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) exploded a bomb on Thorney Street at 8:50am. The bomb resulted in over 50 people injured, including two seriously (see 1973 Westminster bombing).

Millbank Studios reside in the area as an independent broadcast company, owned by ITV. The studio is situated opposite the Houses of Parliament. The BBC Parliament broadcasting channel is also situated nearby (intended to broadcast parliamentary and general political coverage on behalf of the BBC). No.4 is the location commonly used by broadcasters for producing coverage of the Westminster area, including the BBC, Sky News and ITV. Neighbouring College Green is used as a setting for interviewing politicians outdoors. Foreign countries&#x27; broadcasters also have bureaus in the Millbank studio compound. Australian broadcasters ABC, Seven and Nine all have bureaus in the building. Channel Ten (of Australia) used to have an office as well, but it was scrapped due to financial difficulties. Japan&#x27;s broadcaster NHK has an office in the compound as well. RTÉ News and Current Affairs also have their London bureau at the same location.

==Notable buildings==

Millbank Estate is a large but highly regarded Grade II-listed red-brick housing estate that gives the area behind Tate Britain a distinct character. The estate was built between 1897 and 1902, the bricks being recycled from Millbank Prison, which had closed in 1890. The 17 buildings, comprising one of London&#x27;s earliest social housing schemes, are named after distinguished painters such as Turner, Gainsborough, Millais, etc. The estate has 562 flats, all managed on behalf of Westminster City Council by MEMO, the largest tenant management organisation in Westminster. The estate&#x27;s management board is elected annually from the resident population. Half of the estate&#x27;s flats are private leaseholds, the other half are rented from Westminster City Council. The estate&#x27;s buildings are maintained by a regular works program.

In 1914–1916, architects John W. Simpson and Maxwell Ayrton designed and built 4 Millbank, a six-story Neoclassical office building for the Offices of the Crown Agents for the Colonies. This structure has since been converted into multi-let office building with a central, glass-roofed atrium.

Hide Tower is a 20-storey building (with an additional walk-up penthouse level) of 162 flats with a garden and a community hall. When built in 1962 it was the tallest all residential building in Europe. Approximately a quarter of the accommodation is privately rented; half is rented from Westminster City Council and the remainder is owner-occupied. The name was derived from the &quot;hide&quot;, an old English land measure (used in the Domesday Survey of 1086).

Millbank Tower is a large, modernistic office complex between the River Thames, Millbank Estate and Tate Britain Gallery. It has several restaurants and a public garden. Before the 1997 General Election, the Labour Party acquired two floors of the building as its headquarters. The £1 million annual rent, however, forced the party to vacate the tower in 2001 for 16 Old Queen Street, Westminster. In British politics, the term &quot;Millbank Machine&quot; or &quot;Millbank tendency&quot; (a play on &quot;Militant tendency&quot;) has been linked with the activities of spin doctors. The Conservative Party also formerly had its headquarters, CCHQ, based in the tower.

==Public transport==
Millbank Millennium Pier is a modern River Thames pier structure. A regular service by a Damien Hirst-designed riverboat connects Tate Britain with Tate Modern.

The nearest London Underground stations are Westminster, Pimlico and Victoria. London Victoria station is also a National Rail mainline terminus with an adjacent national coach station. Waterloo and Charing Cross stations are also nearby. Millbank is well connected by buses.

<doc id="257215" wikidata="Q964401" url="?curid=257215" title="Fertility">
<text>Fertility in colloquial terms refers the ability to have offspring. In demographic contexts, fertility refers to the actual production of offspring, rather than the physical capability to reproduce, which is termed fecundity. The fertility rate is the average number of children born during an individual&#x27;s lifetime. In medicine, fertility refers to the ability to have children, and infertility refers to difficulty in reproducing naturally. In general, infertility or subfertility in humans is defined as not being able to conceive a child after one year (or longer) of unprotected sex. The antithesis of &quot;fertility&quot; is infertility, while the antithesis of &quot;fecundity&quot; is sterility. 

==Demography==
In demographic contexts, fertility refers to the actual production of offspring, rather than the physical capability to produce which is termed fecundity. While fertility can be measured, fecundity cannot be. Demographers measure the fertility rate in a variety of ways, which can be broadly broken into &quot;period&quot; measures and &quot;cohort&quot; measures. &quot;Period&quot; measures refer to a cross-section of the population in one year. &quot;Cohort&quot; data on the other hand, follows the same people over a period of decades. Both period and cohort measures are widely used.

===Period measures===
* Crude birth rate (CBR) - the number of live births in a given year per 1,000 people alive at the middle of that year. One disadvantage of this indicator is that it is influenced by the age structure of the population.
* General fertility rate (GFR) - the number of births in a year divided by the number of women aged 15–44, times 1000. It focuses on the potential mothers only, and takes the age distribution into account.
* Child-Woman Ratio (CWR) - the ratio of the number of children under 5 to the number of women 15–49, times 1000. It is especially useful in historical data as it does not require counting births. This measure is actually a hybrid, because it involves deaths as well as births. (That is, because of infant mortality some of the births are not included; and because of adult mortality, some of the women who gave birth are not counted either.)
* Coale&#x27;s Index of Fertility - a special device used in historical research

===Cohort measures===

* Total fertility rate (TFR) - the total number of children a woman would bear during her lifetime if she were to experience the prevailing age-specific fertility rates of women. TFR equals the sum for all age groups of 5 times each ASFR rate.
* Gross Reproduction Rate (GRR) - the number of girl babies a synthetic cohort will have. It assumes that all of the baby girls will grow up and live to at least age 50.
* Net Reproduction Rate (NRR) - the NRR starts with the GRR and adds the realistic assumption that some of the women will die before age 49; therefore they will not be alive to bear some of the potential babies that were counted in the GRR. NRR is always lower than GRR, but in countries where mortality is very low, almost all the baby girls grow up to be potential mothers, and the NRR is practically the same as GRR. In countries with high mortality, NRR can be as low as 70% of GRR. When NRR = 1.0, each generation of 1000 baby girls grows up and gives birth to exactly 1000 girls. When NRR is less than one, each generation is smaller than the previous one. When NRR is greater than 1 each generation is larger than the one before. NRR is a measure of the long-term future potential for growth, but it usually is different from the current population growth rate.

===Social and economic determinants of fertility===

A parent&#x27;s number of children strongly correlates with the number of children that each person in the next generation will eventually have. Factors generally associated with increased fertility include religiosity, intention to have children, and maternal support. Factors generally associated with decreased fertility include wealth, education, female labor participation, urban residence, cost of housing, intelligence, increased female age and (to a lesser degree) increased male age.

The &quot;Three-step Analysis&quot; of the fertility process was introduced by Kingsley Davis and Judith Blake in 1956 and makes use of three proximate determinants: The economic analysis of fertility is part of household economics, a field that has grown out of the New Home Economics. Influential economic analyses of fertility include Becker (1960), Mincer (1963), and Easterlin (1969). The latter developed the Easterlin hypothesis to account for the Baby Boom.

===Bongaarts&#x27; model of components of fertility===
Bongaarts proposed a model where the total fertility rate of a population can be calculated from four proximate determinants and the total fecundity (TF). The index of marriage (Cm), the index of contraception (Cc), the index of induced abortion (Ca) and the index of postpartum infecundability (Ci). These indices range from 0 to 1. The higher the index, the higher it will make the TFR, for example a population where there are no induced abortions would have a Ca of 1, but a country where everybody used infallible contraception would have a Cc of 0.

TFR = TF × Cm × Ci × Ca × Cc

These four indices can also be used to calculate the total marital fertility (TMFR) and the total natural fertility (TN).

TFR = TMFR × Cm

TMFR = TN × Cc × Ca

TN = TF × Ci

;Intercourse
:The first step is sexual intercourse, and an examination of the average age at first intercourse, the average frequency outside marriage, and the average frequency inside.
;Conception
:Certain physical conditions may make it impossible for a woman to conceive. This is called &quot;involuntary infecundity.&quot; If the woman has a condition making it possible, but unlikely to conceive, this is termed &quot;subfecundity.&quot; Venereal diseases (especially gonorrhea, syphilis, and chlamydia) are common causes. Nutrition is a factor as well: women with less than 20% body fat may be subfecund, a factor of concern for athletes and people susceptible to anorexia. Demographer Ruth Frisch has argued that &quot;It takes 50,000 calories to make a baby&quot;. There is also subfecundity in the weeks following childbirth, and this can be prolonged for a year or more through breastfeeding. A furious political debate raged in the 1980s over the ethics of baby food companies marketing infant formula in developing countries. A large industry has developed to deal with subfecundity in women and men. An equally large industry has emerged to provide contraceptive devices designed to prevent conception. Their effectiveness in use varies. On average, 85% of married couples using no contraception will have a pregnancy in one year. The rate drops to the 20% range when using withdrawal, vaginal sponges, or spermicides. (This assumes the partners never forget to use the contraceptive.) The rate drops to only 2 or 3% when using the pill or an IUD, and drops to near 0% for implants and 0% for tubal ligation (sterilization) of the woman, or a vasectomy for the man.
;Gestation
:After a fetus is conceived, it may or may not survive to birth. &quot;Involuntary fetal mortality&quot; involves natural abortion, miscarriages and stillbirth (a fetus born dead). Human intervention intentionally causing abortion of the fetus is called &quot;therapeutic abortion&quot;.

==In medicine==
In medicine, the definition of fertility is &quot;the capacity to establish a clinical pregnancy.&quot;

Women have hormonal cycles which determine when they can achieve pregnancy. The cycle is approximately twenty-eight days long, with a fertile period of five days per cycle, but can deviate greatly from this norm. Men are fertile continuously, but their sperm quality is affected by their health, frequency of ejaculation, and environmental factors.

Fertility declines with age in both sexes. For women, the decline begins around the age of 32, and becomes precipitous at age 37. For men, potency and sperm quality begins to decline around the age of 40. Even if an older couple does manage to conceive a child, the pregnancy will be increasingly difficult for the mother, and carries a higher risk of birth defects and genetic disorders for the child.

Pregnancy rates for sexual intercourse are highest when it occurs every 1 or 2 days, or every 2 or 3 days. Studies have found no significant difference between different sex positions and pregnancy rate, as long as it results in ejaculation into the vagina.

===Menstrual cycle===
A woman&#x27;s menstrual cycle begins, as arbitrarily assigned, with menses. Next is the follicular phase where estrogen levels build as an ovum matures (due to the follicular stimulating hormone, or FSH) within the ovary. When estrogen levels peak, it spurs a surge of luteinizing hormone (LH) which completes maturation and enables the ovum to break through the ovary wall. This is ovulation. During the luteal phase following ovulation LH and FSH cause the post-ovulation ovary to develop into the corpus luteum which produces progesterone. The production of progesterone inhibits the LH and FSH hormones which (in a cycle without pregnancy) causes the corpus luteum to atrophy, and menses to begin the cycle again.

Peak fertility occurs during just a few days of the cycle: usually two days before and two days after the ovulation date. This fertile window varies from woman to woman, just as the ovulation date often varies from cycle to cycle for the same woman. The ovule is usually capable of being fertilized for up to 48 hours after it is released from the ovary. Sperm survive inside the uterus between 48 and 72 hours on average, with the maximum being 120 hours (5 days).

These periods and intervals are important factors for couples using the rhythm method of contraception.

===Female fertility===

The average age of menarche in the United States is about 12.5 years. In postmenarchal girls, about 80% of the cycles are anovulatory (ovulation does not actually take place) in the first year after menarche, 50% in the third and 10% in the sixth year.

Menopause occurs during a woman&#x27;s midlife between ages 48 and 55. During menopause, hormonal production by the ovaries is reduced, eventually causing a permanent cessation of the creation of the uterine lining (period). This is considered the end of the fertile phase of a woman&#x27;s life.

The predicted effect of age on female fertility in women trying to get pregnant, without using fertility drugs or in vitro fertilization:
* At age 30
** 75% will conceive ending in a live birth within one year
** 91% will conceive ending in a live birth within four years.
* At age 35
** 66% will conceive ending in a live birth within one year
** 84% will conceive ending in a live birth within four years.
* At age 40
** 44% will conceive ending in a live birth within one year
** 64% will conceive ending in a live birth within four years.
Studies of couples trying to conceive have yielded better results: one 2004 study of 770 European women found that 82% of 35- to 39-year-old women conceived within a year, while a study in 2013 of 2,820 Danish women saw 78% of 35- to 40-year-olds conceive within a year.

According to an opinion by the Practice Committee of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, specific coital timing or position, and resting supine after intercourse have no significant impact on fertility. Sperm can be found in the cervical canal seconds after ejaculation, regardless of coital position.

Successful pregnancies facilitated by fertility treatment have been documented in women as old as 67.

===Male fertility===
Some research suggests that older males have decreased semen volume, sperm motility, and impaired sperm morphology. In studies that controlled for female partner&#x27;s age, comparisons between men under 30 and men over 50 found relative decreases in pregnancy rates between 23% and 38%. Sperm count declines with age, with men aged 50–80 years producing sperm at an average rate of 75% compared with men aged 20–50 years and larger differences exist in the number of seminiferous tubules in the testes containing mature sperm:
* In males 20–39 years old, 90% of the seminiferous tubules contain mature sperm.
* In males 40–69 years old, 50% of the seminiferous tubules contain mature sperm.
* In males 80 years old and older, 10% of the seminiferous tubules contain mature sperm.
Decline in male fertility is influenced by many factors, including lifestyle, environment and psychological factors.

Some research suggests increased risks for health problems for children of older fathers, but no clear association has been proven. A large scale study in Israel suggested that the children of men 40 or older were 5.75 times more likely than children of men under 30 to have an autism spectrum disorder, controlling for year of birth, socioeconomic status, and maternal age. Increased paternal age has been suggested to correlate with schizophrenia but it is unproven.

Australian researchers have found evidence to suggest obesity may cause subtle damage to sperm and prevent a healthy pregnancy. They reported fertilization was 40% less successful when the father was overweight.

The American Fertility Society recommends an age limit for sperm donors of 50 years or less, and many fertility clinics in the United Kingdom will not accept donations from men over 40 or 45 years of age.

==Historical trends by country==

===France===
The French pronatalist movement from 1919 to 1945 failed to convince French couples they had a patriotic duty to help increase their country&#x27;s birthrate. Even the government was reluctant to support the movement. Only between 1938 and 1939 did the French government become directly and permanently involved in the pronatalist effort. Although the birthrate started to surge in late 1941, the trend was not sustained. Falling birthrate again became a major concern among demographers and government officials in the 1970s. In mid-2018, there was a bill introduced to legalize single women and lesbian couples to get fertility treatment. At the beginning of 2020, the Senate approved the bill 160 votes to 116. They are a step closer to legalizing fertility treatments for all women regardless of sexual orientation or marital status. Soon there will be no reason for lesbian couples or single women to travel to be able to start their own family.

===Korea===


South Korea has the lowest fertility rate in the world at 0.78. A variety of explanations have been proposed, ranging from investment in education to birth control, abortion, a decline in the marriage rate, divorce, female participation in the labor force, and the 1997 Asian financial crisis. After being legal from the 1960s to the 1980s, abortion was again made illegal in South Korea in the early 2000s in an attempt to reverse the declining fertility rate.

===United States===

From 1800 to 1940, fertility fell in the US. There was a marked decline in fertility in the early 1900s, associated with improved contraceptives, greater access to contraceptives and sexuality information and the &quot;first&quot; sexual revolution in the 1920s.

====Post-WWII====

After 1940 fertility suddenly started going up again, reaching a new peak in 1957. After 1960, fertility started declining rapidly. In the Baby Boom years (1946–1964), women married earlier and had their babies sooner; the number of children born to mothers after age 35 did not increase.

====Sexual revolution====
After 1960, new methods of contraception became available, the ideal family size fell, from 3 to 2 children. Couples postponed marriage and first births, and they sharply reduced the number of third and fourth births.

<text>The Porvoo Communion is a communion of 15 predominantly northern European Anglican and Evangelical Lutheran churches, with a couple of far-southwestern European (in the Iberian Peninsula) church bodies of the same denomination. It was established in 1992 by a theological agreement entitled the &quot;Porvoo Common Statement&quot; which establishes full communion between and among these churches. The agreement was negotiated in the town of Järvenpää in Finland, but the communion&#x27;s name comes from the nearby city of Porvoo, where a joint Eucharist (or Holy Communion) was celebrated in Porvoo Cathedral after the formal signing in Järvenpää.

==Overview==
The first seeds to the broader communion formed in 1992 were planted in 1922 when the Anglican Church and the Church of Sweden agreed to enter communion with each other. In 1938, the Archbishop of Canterbury, symbolic head of the Anglican Communion, invited the representatives of the Estonian Evangelical Lutheran Church and Latvian Lutheran Church to Lambeth Palace in London in order to reach &quot;altar and pulpit fellowship&quot; between the Anglican and Baltic Lutheran churches. This process came to a formal conclusion with the establishment of the much wider Porvoo Communion in 1992. The churches involved are the several Anglican churches of the British Isles (headed by the founding Church of England) and the other Evangelical Lutheran churches of the Northern European countries. Later negotiations brought the small Anglican churches of the Iberian Peninsula (Spain and Portugal) into the agreement. These churches all share episcopal polity of church organization with the three-fold ministry of bishops, priests (or pastors) and deacons within the historical episcopate with apostolic succession (only bishops ordaining clergy or other bishops, priests and deacons). This is based on the original ministry of the early church.

The Porvoo Communion has no central office or overseer. Each member church has a contact person and these form a contact group which meets each year. Two bishops, one Lutheran and the other Anglican, are co-moderators of the contact group, and there are two co-secretaries also drawn from each tradition. Both are members of the Lutheran World Federation and the Anglican Communion. There are also various conferences and meetings organized to discuss issues of concern to the entire Communion.

<doc id="257218" wikidata="Q1506093" url="?curid=257218" title="Romney Marsh">
<text>Romney Marsh is a sparsely populated wetland area in the counties of Kent and East Sussex in the south-east of England. It covers about . The Marsh has been in use for centuries, though its inhabitants commonly suffered from malaria until the 18th century. Due to its location, geography and isolation, it was important for smugglers between the 17th and 19th centuries. The area has long been used for sheep pasture: Romney Marsh sheep are considered one of the most successful and important sheep breeds. Featuring numerous waterways, and with some areas lying below sea level, the Marsh has over time sustained a gradual level of reclamation, both through natural causes and by human intervention.

==Governance==
An electoral ward in the same name exists. This ward had a population of 2,358 at the 2011 census.

==Quotations==

*&quot;As Egypt was the gift of the Nile, this level tract ... has by the bounty of the sea been by degrees added to the land, so that I may not without reason call it the Gift of the Sea.&quot; (from &quot;Britannia&quot; by William Camden 1551–1623)
*&quot;The world according to the best geographers is divided into Europe, Asia, Africa, America, and Romney Marsh&quot; from &quot;Ingoldsby Legends&quot;, Reverend Richard Harris Barham (Rector of Snargate)

==Areas of Romney Marsh==
Romney Marsh is flat and low-lying, with parts below sea level. It consists of several areas:
*the Romney Marsh proper, lying north of a line between New Romney and Appledore;
*the Walland Marsh, south of that line to approximately the Kent/East Sussex border;
*the East Guldeford Level, south again to Rye;
*the Denge Marsh, south-east of Lydd, which now includes Denge Beach and Dungeness;
*the Rother Levels, which, with various ditches, lie around the Isle of Oxney; and
*the Rye, Winchelsea and Pett Levels.

===River Rother===
The River Rother today flows into the sea below Rye, but until 1287 its mouth lay between Romney and Lydd. It was tidal far upstream, almost to Bodiam. The river mouth was wide with a huge lagoon, making Rye a port at its western end. That lagoon lay behind a large island, which now makes up a large part of the Denge Marsh, on which stood the ports of Lydd and the old Winchelsea. All these ports were affiliated to (as &quot;limbs&quot; of) the Cinque Ports.

===Reclamation===

The Romney Marsh has been gradually built up over the centuries.

====Rhee Wall====
The most significant feature of the Marsh is the Rhee Wall (Rhee is a word for river), forming a prominent ridge. This feature was extended as a waterway in three stages from Appledore to New Romney in the 13th century. Sluices controlled the flow of water, which was then released to flush silt from the harbour at New Romney. Ultimately, the battle was lost: the harbour silted up and New Romney declined in importance. The Rhee kept part of the old port open until the 15th century.

The wall at Dymchurch was built around the same time: storms had breached the shingle barrier, which had protected it until that time. It is a common misconception that both these structures were built by the Romans.

====Shingle====
In 1250 and in the following years, a series of violent storms broke through the coastal shingle banks, flooding significant areas and returning it to marsh, and destroying the harbour at New Romney. In 1287, water destroyed the port town of Old Winchelsea (now located some 2 mi (3 km) out in Rye bay), which had been endangered because of its proximity to the sea since at least 1236. Winchelsea, the third-largest port in England and a major importer of wine, was relocated on higher land, with a harbour consisting of 82 wharfs. Those same storms, however, helped to build up more shingle; such beaches now ran along practically the whole seaward side of the marshland.

By the 14th century, much of the Walland and Denge Marshes had been reclaimed by &quot;innings&quot;, the process of throwing up an embankment around the sea-marsh and using the low-tide to let it run dry by means of one-way drains set into the new seawall, running off into a network of dykes called locally &quot;sewers&quot;. In 1462, the Romney Marsh Corporation was established to install drainage and sea defences for the marsh, which it continued to build into the 16th century. By that time, the course of the Rother had been changed to its channel today; most of the remainder of the area had now been reclaimed from the sea.

Today, shingle continues to be deposited in the harbour. As a result, all the original Cinque Ports of the Marsh are now far from the sea. Dungeness Point is still being added to (especially near Dungeness and Hythe), though a daily operation is in place to counter the reshaping of the shingle banks, using boats to dredge and move the drifting shingle.

====Habitation====
Much of the Marsh became the property of the Priory of Canterbury in the 9th century, when the lands owned by the double minster of Lyminge were transferred to Christ Church, Canterbury. Prior Wilbert granted a tenancy on their land in Misleham, now part of Brookland parish, to a man called Baldwin, sometime between 1155 and 1167, for &quot;all their land in Misleham which lies in the Marsh, in so far as Baldwin can inclose it against the sea&quot;; &quot;Baldwin&#x27;s Sewer&quot; (drainage ditch) remains in use. The marsh has since become covered by a dense network of drainage ditches that once supported large farming communities. These watercourses have been maintained and managed by internal drainage boards (IDBs) for sustainable water levels since the 1930s. In April 2001, the five drainage boards responsible for the marsh amalgamated to form the Romney Marshes Area IDB.

====Sustainability====
Romney Marsh is adjacent to the High Weald Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, which is less developed than many other areas in Kent and Sussex. The decline in sheep prices meant that even the local stock (sold around the world for breeding for over two centuries) became unsustainable. Turfing had always been a lesser practice due to the grassland kept short by the sheep reared upon it, but farms are increasing in size to compensate for the decline in sustainable livestock farming. Some view this as unsustainable due to the damage to soil ecology of the Marsh. The only other alternative, since 1946, has been for farmers to turn to arable farming, changing the landscape from a patchwork of small family farms to a few extensive arable production units.

== Wind farm ==

A 59.8 MW wind farm was constructed by Npower Renewables at Little Cheyne Court, west of Lydd and commissioned in March 2009. There were objections to the planned development from Kent County Council, Shepway District Council, English Nature and the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds (RSPB), and so a public enquiry was held to consider the application and objections. English Nature and the RSPB were concerned about possible detrimental effects of the wind farm on bird populations, as the location is close to a designated Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and a European Union Special Protection Area (SPA), because it provides habitat for large numbers of migratory birds. Bewick swans and shovellers spend the winter there, while there are large breeding populations of common terns, little terns and Mediterranean gulls. The enquiry concluded that the project would not adversely affect the conservation areas, and the two organisations entered into a formal agreement with Npower Renewables to monitor and manage the area, with Npower funding the programme.

==Romney Marsh sheep==
Sheep have formed an important part of the economy of Romney Marsh for over 700 years. Romney Marsh sheep were bred from European white face, long-tailed sheep, but by 1800 they were considered to be a distinct breed. Some cross-breeding with Leicester sheep took place at around that time, to improve their characteristics. They are dual-purpose animals, producing good meat and quality wool. They are particularly adapted to wet conditions, being resistant to foot rot, while their fleeces stay healthy in the harsh conditions found on the Marsh. They are also resistant to the liver fluke parasite. Their wool has fibres which are finer than all other breeds of longwool sheep, and is particularly good for hand spinning. A flock book for the breed has been maintained since 1895.

Romney sheep were exported around the world from the early 19th century onwards. The first flocks were sent to New Zealand, where they adapted to their new environment well, and are still the most prolific breed in the country. They have since been shipped to many parts of England, Australia, Patagonia, Canada, Brazil, Portugal, the Falkland Islands and the United States.
However, for Downland sheep that were often taken to the marshes to be fattened before sale, 19th-century reports suggest the Romney pastures were highly likely to result in the animals becoming ill with liver fluke and thus their meat becoming contaminated. Whitlaw suggests that this was probably due to the cultivation of buttercups in the region during the 1830s.

==Lookers&#x27; huts==

In the 18th and 19th centuries, men known as lookers were hired to look after the large flocks of sheep in the expanses of Romney Marsh. The lookers&#x27; huts were their temporary accommodation and store for tools. A hut was about square with a tiled roof and a chimney, a small window and a fireplace. The hut was particularly important at lambing time: the looker&#x27;s family would regularly visit him, bringing supplies for the week.

There were 356 lookers&#x27; huts recorded in 1870; the practice of living out on the Marsh at certain times of the year was ending in the 1930s, and few are now left. A hut at Cold Harbour Farm near Brookland, built about 1900, is a Grade II listed building. There is a reconstructed hut at the Visitor Centre in Romney Warren Country Park.

==Romney Marsh Countryside Partnership (RMCP)==
The Romney Marsh Countryside Partnership was set up in June 1996, as a sister project to the White Cliffs Countryside Partnership. With the help of volunteers, it manages and maintains various sites across the Marsh. The non-profit organisation aims to care for the special landscape and wildlife of the Romney Marsh and Dungeness while encouraging people to enjoy and understand the countryside through volunteer work, guided walks, cycle rides, countryside events and children&#x27;s activities.

==Malaria==
In the past, people who lived in the marsh frequently suffered from malaria, then known as &quot;ague&quot; or &quot;marsh fever&quot;, which caused high mortality rates until the 1730s. It remained a major problem until the completion of the Royal Military Canal in 1806, which greatly improved the drainage of the area.

This disease probably arrived here with mosquitoes as soon as the weather became warm enough after the end of the Last Glacial Period, around or before the time of the Roman occupation. The strain responsible was most probably &quot;Plasmodium vivax&quot;, as records and texts describe agues or fevers at three or four-day intervals. Prior Anselm, of nearby Canterbury, recorded in the 1070s and 1080s a case that had every appearance of malaria.

Although five indigenous mosquito species are capable of being hosts for the malarial parasite, only the &quot;Anopheles atroparvus&quot; species breeds in sufficient numbers here to act as an efficient vector. However, &quot;P. vivax&quot; likes brackish waters and, with the recreation of the old coastal wetlands coming into favour, this could expand the future malarial parasite host reserve. Together with the average temperatures in England increasing due to climate change, English malaria may become re-established in the marshes.

==Transport==
===Roads===
Roads across the Marsh have always been narrow and winding. This is partly because of the hundreds of &quot;sewers&quot; and smaller drainage ditches, and because the grazing land is far more important than the roads. The lack of road signs and few villages can make navigating across the marsh very confusing for outsiders. Several minor roads have no finger posts at junctions at all and at others, it is possible to find two or three lanes apparently leading to the same village.

Many of these lanes are built on the remains of enclosures used to &quot;in&quot; the Marsh. There is a dramatic section near Brookland, where a lane linking the Woolpack pub to Lydd is perched 2 or 3 m above the surrounding farmland, on the &quot;Hook&quot; wall. The section of road between Brenzett and Lydd Lane end is built on the Rhee wall, a medieval canal that brought water from higher up the river Rother.

The main road is the A259 from Rye, which is narrow and winding to Brookland and Brenzett, where it splits in two. One arm becomes the A2070 and runs parallel to the railway to link the Marsh to Hamstreet, Ashford and the wider world. The other, still the A259, is good only as far as the junction with Lydd Lane (B2075) and leads to New Romney, Dymchurch, Hythe and eventually, Folkestone.

The local bus routes on the Marsh are operated by Stagecoach in East Kent and link it to Ashford, Canterbury, Dover, Folkestone, Hastings, Northiam and Tenterden.

National Cycle Route 2 passes through the area; the section between Rye and Lydd is mostly off-road. From Lydd to Hythe, it uses quiet lanes; from Hythe it is possible to cycle along the sea wall to Folkestone, and ultimately (off-road) to reach Dover.

===Railways===
The main line railway known as the Marsh Link Line is the Ashford to Hastings line, with stations at Hamstreet, Appledore, Rye, and Winchelsea. The one-time branch to New Romney from Appledore (its small offshoot to Dungeness closed in 1937) was closed to passenger traffic in 1967. It was possible to travel directly from Dungeness to London, and the 2-hr journey time was quicker than by road and rail today. The line is still in place about a mile short of Dungeness. In the early 21st century, it is used to transfer spent fuel from the nuclear power plant.

The Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway, a -gauge miniature railway and the only miniature railway in the British Isles ever to have been incorporated under the Light Railways Act 1896, has been operating along the Romney Marsh coast since 1927. It runs for from Hythe to Dungeness.

===Walks===
The Saxon Shore Way is a long-distance footpath which starts at Gravesend, Kent. It traces the coast as it was in Roman times as far as Hastings, East Sussex. It is long, and its route crosses the northern edge of the Marsh. The idea for the path was conceived in the 1970s and it was officially opened on 22 June 1980 by the Archbishop of Canterbury.

==The Marsh in war==
Throughout its history, the proximity of the marsh to the European mainland meant that this area was in the front line whenever invasion threatened. In AD 892, one such invasion was successful. The Danish fleet of 250 ships sailed right into the Rother and took the fortress at Appledore (allegedly built by King Arthur), which they destroyed.

===Cinque Ports===
The importance of the Cinque Ports was in their strategic location at the narrowest part of the English Channel. They were important for both trade and defence. Romney and Hythe were two of the ports within the Romney Marsh; Rye and Winchelsea were later added as &quot;Antient Towns&quot;. Rye replaced Romney as one of the main five when Romney&#x27;s port was silted in.

===Royal Military Canal===
The Royal Military Canal stretches for 28 miles hugging the old cliff line that borders the Romney Marsh from Hythe in the north east to Cliff End in the south west. It was conceived by Lt-Col Brown of the Royal Staff Corps of field engineers in 1804, the time of the Napoleonic Wars, as a way to ensure that an invasion by the French could not use the marsh as a bridgehead. John Rennie acted as consultant engineer, and the work was completed in April 1809. A military road was built on the inland side of the canal, which consisted of two parts, joined by sections of the River Rother and the River Brede.

===Martello towers===
Martello towers are fortifications that were built by the British Army for coastal defence during the early nineteenth century and the Napoleonic Wars. Seventy-four towers were built along the south coast; Tower 1 was at Folkestone, overlooking the harbour, and Tower 74 guarded the beach at Seaford in East Sussex. Six were built in pairs in Dymchurch to protect the Romney Marsh sluices from potential invading French forces. One of these, Martello Tower No. 24 is closest to its original condition, and has its cannon. It is open to the public during the summer months. The towers were built between 1805 and 1808, when Napoleon was a threat.

===Sound mirrors===
Prior to World War II, experiments to detect enemy aircraft with huge concrete acoustic mirrors were conducted at Greatstone. The large concrete mirrors were built between 1928 and 1930 as an early warning system in case of approaching German aircraft. While they could detect slow moving aircraft before they were visible, they were less effective as aircraft got faster, and operators struggled to distinguish between aeroplanes and seagoing ships. They were superseded by radar technology in 1935, and abandoned in 1939.

===Second World War===
Germany&#x27;s Operation Sea Lion plan included crossing the flat marsh during an invasion across the English Channel. The government planned to flood the area to prevent troops and equipment from crossing the area. Thousands of concrete pillboxes were built in Kent; 6,500 of the crumbling structures remain standing to this day. The ancient Royal Military Canal was well guarded with troops, pillboxes and barbed wire. Training was provided in the area for the secret Auxiliary Units, men who would be deployed in case of an invasion. Four advanced landing ground airstrips were built on Romney Marsh in 1942, for use by fighters and light bombers; these were used for flights in 1944 against the German flying bombs.

The miniature Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway was used by the government to run armoured trains during construction of Operation Pluto, known as the Pipe Line Under The Ocean. It was to pass under the English Channel, and was intended to supply fuel to the Allied forces that would be involved in Operation Overlord (the 1944 invasion of Normandy).

===Military training===
There are two military establishments on the Marsh: the Hythe and Lydd Ranges. The latter has a large danger area marked on maps south of Lydd towards the sea. The Metropolitan Police also have a substantial facility just outside Lydd, where a mock urban &#x27;townscape&#x27; complete with full-size houses, streets, etc., provides an appropriate environment for counter-terrorism and civil disorder training.

==&quot;Lost villages&quot; of the Marsh==

Some of the &quot;lost communities&quot; on the Marsh are instances of the modern decline of the rural communities; others occurred over the centuries. In 1348, for example, many villages were decimated by the Black Death. The few survivors moved to other places.

The villages, shown below with the modern Ordnance Survey map information on Sheet 189, were:
*&quot;Buttdarts&quot;: Buttdart Bridge, over one of the larger marsh drains 
*&quot;Dengemarsh&quot;: south of Lydd; the village was closed when the government opened the Lydd ranges in WWII [not marked on OS Map: ?TR 0417] 
*&quot;Eastbridge&quot;: Eastbridge House, on Dymchurch to Bonnington road: the road is named Eastbridge Road out of Dymchurch. Remains: large part of west wall of the tower, some other fragments. Village had a population of 21 (1801 Census). 
*&quot;Fairfield&quot;: NW of Brookland 
*&quot;Falconhurst&quot;: a house north of the Royal Military Canal six miles west of Hythe. 
*&quot;Galloways&quot;: south of Lydd, village was closed when the Lydd ranges were opened in WWII [not marked on OS Map: ?TR 0017] 
*&quot;Hope All Saints&quot;: Hope Farm, NW of New Romney. The remains of the church are marked on the map. (See &quot;Romney Marsh Gazeteer&quot;) 

*&quot;Midley&quot;: Midley Cottages, SW of Old Romney This was once a small island in the Rother between the larger ones of Romney and Lydd, and the name means &quot;middle island&quot;. In the 8th century there was a village on this site, and 23 people still lived here in 1801. Now, only the ruined west wall of the church remains. During World War II, an RAF airfield was built and operated here.
*&quot;Orgarswick&quot;: Orgarswick Farm, NW of Dymchurch 
*&quot;Shorne&quot;: no modern trace, although there are unnamed church remains NNW of New Romney near Chapel Land Farm 
*&quot;Snave&quot;: Although the church still stands, it is used only once a year for a harvest festival service. Today it falls under the Hamstreet group of churches. (See Romney Marsh Gazeteer) 

==Smuggling==
The flat, almost empty landscape and numerous waterways created an ideal environment for smuggling from the 17th until the early 19th century. The traffic was two-way, since wool was smuggled from this area to the Continent.

The main gangs on the Marsh were the Hawkhurst Gang, the Mayfield Gang, and the Aldington Gang, known also as &quot;the Blues&quot;.

Smugglers on the Marshes were known as &quot;Owlers.&quot; The name was rumoured to be derived from the owl-like sounds they used to communicate at night.

==Literary associations==
Romney Marsh has been represented in a distinguished literary history. Three authors who specifically used the marsh as settings for their works were E. F. Benson, author of the Mapp and Lucia novels; Russell Thorndike, author of the Doctor Syn novels; and the children&#x27;s writer Monica Edwards, author of Romney Marsh books. She changed the name of Rye Harbour to &quot;Westling&quot;, Rye is renamed &quot;Dunsford&quot;, and Winchelsea is known as &quot;Winklesea&quot;.

Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1955 historical novel &quot;Outcast&quot; depicts Roman efforts to build the Rhee Wall and reclaim land from the sea. A fictitious Romney Marsh estate near Charbury is a key setting in &quot;The Eagle Has Flown&quot; (1991) by Jack Higgins, the quasi-sequel to &quot;The Eagle Has Landed.&quot; Both are related to World War II. The latter novel was adapted as a successful motion picture starring Michael Caine.

Modern-day novelist George Chittenden captures smuggling on the Kent coast in his highly praised debut children&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Boy Who Led Them&quot; (2012). It follows the rise and fall of a smuggling gang leader in Deal, Kent, a notorious smuggling town further down the coast.

Many other well-known writers have been associated with the area: Henry James lived in Rye; Daphne du Maurier lived in Hythe for a few years during World War II; H. G. Wells, Joseph Conrad, Ford Madox Ford, Stephen Crane, Radclyffe Hall, Noël Coward, Edith Nesbit, Rumer Godden, Malcolm Saville, and Conrad Aiken also lived in marsh towns. Conrad&#x27;s daughter, Joan Aiken, set her children&#x27;s book, Cold Shoulder Road, in Romney Marsh. Rudyard Kipling and his poem, &quot;A Smugglers&#x27; Song&quot;, are also associated with the 18th-century Sussex smugglers.

According to Norman Wright&#x27;s book &quot;The Famous Five: Everything You Ever Wanted to Know&quot;, Rye&#x27;s history inspired Enid Blyton when she wrote &quot;Five Go to Smuggler&#x27;s Top.&quot;

The 1947 British historical drama film &quot;The Loves of Joanna Godden,&quot; based on the novel by Sheila Kaye-Smith and directed by Charles Frend, is set in Romney Marsh.

The 1963 a three-part television series entitled &quot;The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh,&quot; was produced for the &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Wonderful World of Color&quot; TV series. It described the adventures of Dr. Syn. Parts of it were filmed at St Clement&#x27;s Church in Old Romney, Romney Marsh. The three-part series was edited into a motion picture and released in the United Kingdom and subsequently Europe, Central America and South America. It debuted on American television in 1964.

In 2023, English author K.J. Charles published &quot;The Secret Lives of Country Gentlemen&quot;, a historical romance set on Romney Marsh and featuring smuggling. This was followed by a sequel titled &quot;The Nobleman&#x27;s Guide to Seducing a Scoundrel&quot;, also set on the marsh.

<text>Dave Sim (born 17 May 1956) is a Canadian cartoonist and publisher, known for his comic book &quot;Cerebus&quot;, his artistic experimentation, his advocacy of self-publishing and creators&#x27; rights, and his controversial political and philosophical beliefs.

Sim rose to prominence with &quot;Cerebus&quot;, which began in December 1977. Sim initially conceived it as a parody of &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; and other sword and sorcery comics, but after two years he began to consider the series a self-contained work that would run for 300 issues and be subdivided into novels. By the time the 6000-page work was completed in March 2004, Sim had delved into politics, and an examination of feminism and gender, while becoming progressively more sophisticated and experimental in his storytelling and artwork. Sim worked on &quot;Cerebus Archives&quot; afterward, and he produced the comic books &quot;Glamourpuss&quot;, which examines the history of photorealistic comics, and &quot;Judenhass&quot;, about the Holocaust.

Sim co-founded the small press publisher Aardvark-Vanaheim with his wife-to-be, Deni Loubert, in 1977. Most of the titles it published moved to Loubert&#x27;s Renegade Press after the couple&#x27;s divorce in the mid-1980s. The publishing company later was co-owned by Sim&#x27;s creative partner, Gerhard, who dissolved their partnership and sold his stake in the company to Sim in 2007.

Sim helped create the Creator&#x27;s Bill of Rights in 1988. He has criticized the use of copyright to restrict creators, and has arranged for his body of work to fall into the public domain following his death. Sim has already released one of his works, &quot;Judenhass&quot;, to the public domain.

==Early life==
Sim was born on 17 May 1956. His father was a factory supervisor at Budd Automotive and worked as a labour negotiator.

Sim became interested in comic books when he was eight. He had a letter published in &quot;Iron Man&quot; #37 (May 1971). Bernie Wrightson&#x27;s &quot;Badtime Stories&quot; (1971) inspired him to devote himself to drawing. Sim also found inspiration in &quot;Mad&quot; magazine, particularly Harvey Kurtzman and Wally Wood&#x27;s &quot;Superduperman&quot; parody, as well as underground cartoonist Jack Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Conan&quot; parody. He wrote and drew comics throughout his adolescence, and he began submitting work to fanzines. His first published work was some articles in the comics fanzine &quot;Rocket&#x27;s Blast Comicollector&quot;. He had submitted artwork as well and, although it was rejected, Sim struck up a relationship with editor Gabe Quintanilla, who encouraged him to continue submitting material. Now &amp; Then Books owner Harry Kremer allowed him to produce a newsletter called &quot;Now &amp; Then Times&quot;. The first issue arrived in summer 1972. Sim produced another issue in 1973, but he had begun devoting his time to John Balge&#x27;s &quot;Comic Art News and Reviews&quot;, another Canadian comics fanzine. For &quot;CANAR&quot; he interviewed subjects such as Barry Windsor-Smith.

Inspired by Charles Schulz&#x27;s &quot;Peanuts&quot; and &quot;Outhouses of the North&quot; (a small book of cartoons published by the Highway Bookshop in northern Ontario), Sim spent 1975 and 1976 developing a comic strip called &quot;The Beavers&quot;. Highway Bookshop published the strip as a book in 1976. A second book failed to materialize when the publisher shut down. Sim then pursued syndication, pitching &quot;The Beavers&quot; to the &quot;Kitchener-Waterloo Record&quot;. With Day inking the strips, a year&#x27;s worth was produced in three days. Sim also wrote or drew stories published in anthologies such as &quot;Phantacea&quot; and &quot;Star*Reach&quot;. &quot;The Beavers&quot; also saw print in &quot;Star*Reach&#x27;s&quot; sister talking animals comic &quot;Quack!&quot;.

Around this time, Sim&#x27;s work was published by Charlton Comics and Warren Publishing. In 1976, Sim took the only job he ever held outside of comics: an employee at Now &amp; Then Books. He also wrote and drew parts of &quot;Ali Baba&quot; #1 for Gauntlet Comics.

==Career==
===&quot;Cerebus&quot;===
In December 1977, Sim began publishing &quot;Cerebus&quot;, an initially bi-monthly, black-and-white comic book series. It began as a parodic cross between Conan the Barbarian and Howard the Duck. Progressively, Sim shifted his narrative style to story arcs of a few issues&#x27; length. Soon he moved to longer, far more complex &quot;novels&quot;, beginning with the 25-issue storyline &quot;High Society&quot; which began in issue #26. The sword and sorcery elements in the series, prominent up to that point, were minimized as Sim concentrated more on politics.

&quot;Cerebus&quot; was published through Sim&#x27;s company, Aardvark-Vanaheim, which was run by his wife, Deni Loubert. The two met in 1976, married in 1979, and divorced after nearly five years of marriage.

In 1979, during a time when he was taking large doses of LSD, Sim was hospitalized for treatment of schizophrenia-like symptoms.

&quot;Arnold the Isshurian&quot;, a two-page parody of Conan and Little Nemo, ran in &quot;Epic Illustrated&quot; in February 1982.

Beginning with issue #65 (August 1984), Sim began collaborating with the artist Gerhard, who drew all the backgrounds while Sim, who continued to write the series himself, drew the foreground figures. Gerhard and Sim continued to work together on &quot;Cerebus&quot; until the series concluded with issue #300, in March 2004.

During a panel discussion at the 1999 San Diego Comic-Con the editorial staff of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; indicted Sim in what Gary Groth characterized as a &quot;Nuremberg-style tribunal designed to bring to light the most deserving criminals who had over the past decade and longer besmirched the good name of the comics art and industry&quot;. Groth took issue with a 1992 speech Sim had given to Diamond Comic Distributors, which, at the time, was the exclusive distributor of most major U.S. comic book publishers. In his speech, Sim unabashedly advocated for the speculator boom occurring at the time, a position that Groth felt personified the worst aspects of capitalism and greed.

Although Sim did not maintain a consistent monthly schedule for the entire run, which at times required an accelerated production schedule to catch up, he completed the &quot;Cerebus&quot; series on schedule in March 2004. As the series progressed, it was noted for its tendency towards artistic experimentation. Sim has called the complete run of &quot;Cerebus&quot; a 6,000-page novel, a view shared by several academic writers and comics historians.

He purchased Gerhard&#x27;s stake in Aardvark-Vanaheim and has made arrangements for the copyright of &quot;Cerebus&quot; to fall into the public domain following his death.

===Post-&quot;Cerebus&quot; work===

Beginning in 2006, Sim began publishing an online comic-book biography of Canadian actress Siu Ta titled &quot;Siu Ta, So Far&quot;.

In late 2007, Sim announced two projects. One, which he initially referred to only as &quot;Secret Project One&quot;, was &quot;Judenhass&quot; (German for &quot;Jew hatred&quot;), a 56-page &quot;personal reflection on The Holocaust&quot; which was released on May 28, 2008. The other is &quot;glamourpuss&quot;, a comic-book series which was a combined parody of fashion magazines (wherein Sim traces photos from real fashion magazines) and a historical study of the photorealist style of comic-strip art, for which he did a promotional &quot;tour&quot; of comics-related forums online in February 2008.

In 2009, Sim began publishing &quot;Cerebus Archive&quot;, a bimonthly presentation of his work before and surrounding &quot;Cerebus&quot;.

On October 23, 2009, the first episode of the web series &quot;Cerebus TV&quot; premiered. The show aired new episodes Fridays at 10 pm Eastern time, which then stream continuously throughout the week. Credits list Dave Sim as the executive producer. Sim was often the primary feature of the shows, either interviewing comics legends or showing behind the scenes at Aardvark-Vanaheim. As of early 2013, there were approximately 115 episodes of Cerebus TV.

In 2011, BOOM! Town announced that in 2012 it would publish &quot;Dave Sim&#x27;s Last Girlfriend&quot;, a collection of letters between Dave Sim and Susan Alston originally intended for Denis Kitchen&#x27;s Kitchen Sink Press. A collection of academic essays about &quot;Cerebus&quot; was published in 2012 by McFarland.

It appeared that the 2012 end of &quot;Glamourpuss&quot; would mean the end of &quot;The Strange Death of Alex Raymond&quot;, a running feature in that book. In 2013 it was announced IDW would publish the series in a reworked edition, as well as handle a number of other projects, including a &quot;Cerebus&quot; cover collection.

In 2001, Sim and his then-collaborator Gerhard founded the Howard E. Day Prize for outstanding achievement in self-publishing, in tribute to Sim&#x27;s mentor, Gene Day. Bestowed annually at SPACE (Small Press and Alternative Comics Expo) in Columbus, Ohio from 2002 to 2008 the prize consisted of a $500 cash award and a commemorative plaque. The recipient was chosen by Sim and Gerhard from a pool of submitted works. Beginning in 2009, the Day Prize was replaced by the SPACE Prize.

In 2017, Cerebus returned in a series of one-shots collectively known as Cerebus in Hell? Presents. Each title presented as a #1.

In 2020, Sim ceased work on &quot;The Strange Death of Alex Raymond&quot;. His collaborator on the project, Carson Grubaugh, finished and published the work, which saw release in 2021 through Living the Line.

==Influence==
Sim&#x27;s use of an extended, multi-layered storytelling canvas, divided in large arcs divided in mostly self-contained issues, was acknowledged by J. Michael Straczynski as his inspiration for the structure of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;. Neil Gaiman named Sim as one of his two biggest influences within comics.

==Controversies==
===Creators&#x27; rights===
During the 1980s and early 1990s, Sim used his sales leverage from &quot;Cerebus&quot; to act as a major proponent and advocate of creators&#x27; rights and self-publishing. After the &quot;Puma Blues&quot; distribution incident, he helped write the Creators&#x27; Bill of Rights along with Kevin Eastman, Peter Laird, and Scott McCloud. In addition to speaking on these topics at comic book conventions (as in his 1993 PRO/con speech), Sim also published the seminal &quot;The Cerebus Guide to Self-Publishing&quot; in 1997, which instructed readers on the practical matters of how to successfully self-publish their own comics, and which promoted other creators&#x27; fledgling work.

Sim has criticized the use of copyrights to restrict the use of creations which would have more quickly become public domain under earlier copyright law. He has stated that other creators are free to use his characters in their own works, which he characterizes as an attempt to be consistent with his own appropriation of others&#x27; works.

===Views on women===
In the course of writing &quot;Cerebus&quot;, Sim expressed opposition to feminism and made controversial statements regarding men and women. Sim expressed his views on gender in issue #186 of &quot;Cerebus&quot;, in a text piece as part of the story arc &quot;Reads&quot; (one of four books in the larger &quot;Mothers &amp; Daughters&quot; arc), using the pseudonym Viktor Davis. Among the various theories expounded upon in the piece, Sim&#x27;s alter-ego Viktor Davis categorizes humanity into metaphorical &quot;lights&quot;, which tended to reside in men, and &quot;voids&quot;, which tended to be in women. He characterized Voids as &quot;without a glimmer of understanding of intellectual processes&quot; and declared that &quot;Light does not Breed&quot;.

In 1995, &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; #174 featured a Bill Willingham caricature of Sim on one of the covers, bearing the title &quot;Dave Sim: Misogynist Guru of Self-Publishers&quot;. Inside was a lengthy article written by Jonathan Hagey and Kim Thompson that published responses from comics creators such as Alan Moore, Seth, Rick Veitch, Steve Bissette, and Sim&#x27;s friend and fellow Canadian Chester Brown. The responses ranged from anger to a belief that Sim was joking. Others would later speculate that Sim had a mental illness related to his heavy drug use in the late 1970s. The article also included a short interview with Sim&#x27;s ex-wife, wherein she described the essay as evidence of Sim being &quot;very scared&quot;. In the essay in &quot;Cerebus&quot; #186, Sim characterized fellow self-publishing cartoonist Jeff Smith as an example of a man dominated by his wife. When Smith contested this, Sim accused Smith of lying and challenged Smith to a boxing match, which Smith declined.

In 2001, Sim published another essay, &quot;Tangent&quot;, in &quot;Cerebus&quot; #265 (April 2001). In it, Sim furthered the themes from &quot;Reads&quot;, describing the tangent he contends western society has taken due to the widespread acceptance and proliferation of feminism, beginning in 1970. &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; posted the full essay on its website, although a short introduction by staff distanced the &quot;Journal&quot; from the ideas therein, calling them &quot;nutty and loathsome&quot;. The following issue included a rebuttal to the first &quot;Tangent&quot; by &quot;Ruthie Penmark&quot;. Several years later, in issue #263, the &quot;Journal&quot; devoted a section to discussion of &quot;Cerebus&quot;. It reprinted a 2001 essay by R. S. Stephen—&quot;Masculinity&#x27;s Last Hope, or Creepily Paranoid Misogynist?: An Open Letter to Dave Sim&quot;—addressing the &quot;Tangent&quot; controversy. Sim&#x27;s reply to Stephen, and Stephen&#x27;s subsequent rebuttal, were published in &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; #266.

Despite the description of his views and his reputation as a misogynist, Sim maintains that he is not one. In 2008, Sim sent out a self-written form letter to individuals who had sent him mail, detailing his disagreement with being called a misogynist and disenchantment with what he perceived as a dearth of support in refuting those claims to his character. Contending that society perceived misogynists as the &quot;lowest, subhuman form of life in our society&quot;, he mentioned that few, if any, people had defended him, allowing him to be called &quot;the lowest, subhuman form of life in our society with impunity.&quot; Sim&#x27;s letter ended with an ultimatum, requesting that those who wished to receive his return correspondence reply with a letter or online posting and the statement, &quot;I do not believe Dave Sim is a misogynist.&quot; All others were asked not to attempt to contact him again.

===Relationship with &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;===
The coverage of Sim&#x27;s writings about feminism was not the only subject of Sim&#x27;s conflict with &quot;The Comics Journal&quot;. He and Gary Groth, the &quot;Journal&quot;″s editor-in-chief, developed a combative relationship. In December 1979, the magazine published a review of the first dozen or so issues of &quot;Cerebus&quot; by Kim Thompson, who called &quot;Cerebus&quot; &quot;a true heir to Carl Barks&#x27; duck stories&quot;.

During a panel discussion at the 1999 San Diego Comic-Con the editorial staff of &quot;The Comics Journal&quot; indicted Sim in what Groth characterized as a &quot;Nuremberg-style tribunal designed to bring to light the most deserving criminals who had over the past decade and longer besmirched the good name of the comics art and industry&quot;. Groth took issue with a 1992 speech Sim had given to Diamond Comic Distributors, which, at the time, was the exclusive distributor of most major U.S. comic book publishers. In his speech, Sim unabashedly advocated for the speculator boom occurring at the time, a position that Groth felt personified the worst aspects of capitalism and greed.

===Accusation of child grooming===

In September 2018, Sim publicly voiced support for Ethan Van Sciver, a leading figure in the Comicsgate movement. Van Sciver hired Sim to write a story for Van Sciver&#x27;s creator-owned book &quot;Cyberfrog&quot;. In the wake of this announcement, statements Sim had made about dating a fourteen-year-old girl resurfaced. Although Sim claims that the relationship did not become sexual until just before her 21st birthday, Sim conceded that his interest in her had been immoral, and that he had violated the Mann Act when he transported her across state lines during a 1985 convention. Van Sciver initially defended the relationship but subsequently canceled the project.

==Health==
On February 27, 2015 Sim suffered a wrist injury, and was physically unable to draw. In a September 28, 2017 video on his Cerebus Online YouTube channel, he revealed that he had been showing some signs of recovery and was able to create his first new drawing of Cerebus.

<doc id="257227" wikidata="Q4855967" url="?curid=257227" title="Bank Secrecy Act">
<text>The Bank Secrecy Act of 1970 (BSA), also known as the Currency and Foreign Transactions Reporting Act, is a U.S. law requiring financial institutions in the United States to assist U.S. government agencies in detecting and preventing money laundering. Specifically, the act requires financial institutions to keep records of cash purchases of negotiable instruments, file reports if the daily aggregate exceeds $10,000, and report suspicious activity that may signify money laundering, tax evasion, or other criminal activities.

The BSA is sometimes referred to as an anti-money laundering law (AML) or jointly as BSA/AML.

==History==
The BSA was originally passed by the U.S. Congress in 1970 and signed by President Richard Nixon into law on October 26, 1970. Shortly after passage, several groups attempted to have the courts rule the law unconstitutional, claiming it violated both Fourth Amendment rights against unwarranted search and seizure, and Fifth Amendment rights of due process. Several cases were combined before the Supreme Court in &quot;California Bankers Assn. v. Shultz&quot;, , which ruled that the Act did not violate the Constitution. Until the 1980s, there was a &quot;prolonged period of inaction&quot;, but financial institutions eventually complied with the BSA&#x27;s reporting requirements.

The statute has been amended several times, including provisions in Title III of the USA PATRIOT Act, which amended the BSA to require financial institutions to establish anti-money-laundering programs by establishing internal policies, procedures, and controls, designating compliance officers, providing ongoing employee training, and testing their programs through independent audits. There was an attempt to include another amendment in 2018, called the Illicit Arts and Antiquities Trafficking Prevention Act (IAATP). As the name implies, its aim was to restrict illegal trafficking of art in the United States which has the highest rates of money laundering in the world. It was not passed in the United States House of Representatives. This was because the aim of the IAATP did not directly correspond with the aim of the BSA which, according to Congressman Luke Messer, sponsor of the bill, is to &quot;counteract terrorist financing and crack down on terrorist organizations like ISIS&quot;.

==Reports==
BSA regulations require all financial institutions to submit five types of reports. Individuals must file an individual filing requirement.

===Currency transaction reports===
A currency transaction report (CTR) reports cash transactions exceeding $10,000 in one business day, regardless of whether it&#x27;s in one transaction or several cash transactions. It is filed electronically with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) and is identified as FinCEN Form 112 (formerly Form 104).

CTRs include an individual&#x27;s bank account number, name, address, and social security number. SAR reports, required when transactions indicate behavior designed to elude CTRs (or many other types of suspicious activities), include somewhat more detailed information and usually include investigation efforts on the part of the financial institution to assess the validity or nature of the transactions. A single CTR filed for a client&#x27;s account is usually of no concern to the authorities, while multiple CTRs from varying institutions or a SAR suggest that activity may be suspicious.

===Suspicious activity report===
A suspicious activity report (SAR) must report any cash transaction where the customer seems to be trying to avoid BSA reporting requirements by not filing CTR or monetary instrument log (MIL), for example. A SAR must also be filed if the customer&#x27;s actions suggest that they are laundering money or otherwise violating federal criminal laws and committing wire transfer fraud, check fraud, or mysterious disappearances. These reports are filed with FinCEN and are identified as Treasury Department Form 90-22.47 and OCC Form 8010-9, 8010-1. This requirement and its accompanying implied gag order was added by the Annunzio-Wylie Anti-Money Laundering Act § 1517(b) (part of the Housing and Community Development Act of 1992, , , 4060).

A financial institution is not allowed to inform a business or consumer that a SAR is being filed, and all the reports mandated by the BSA are exempt from disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act.

===FBAR===
U.S. citizens and residents with a financial interest in or authority over foreign bank accounts or &quot;foreign financial accounts&quot; with an aggregate value of $10,000 or more are required to file a Foreign Bank Account Report (FBAR) with the U.S. Treasury by October 15 every year. It is identified as FinCEN Form 114 (formerly Treasury Department Form 90-22.1). Additionally, they must report the interest or dividend income from the accounts on Schedule B of the Form 1040 tax form and, if a higher threshold is exceeded, also report the amounts and interest on Form 8938. Proponents of FBAR argue that it helps the United States deter financial crimes and encourage whistle-blowing for financial crimes, while critics argue that FBAR wastes time and money, &quot;perversely discouraging compliance&quot; without focusing on &quot;likely criminal activity&quot;.

===Other reports ===

A MIL must indicate cash purchases of monetary instruments, such as money orders, cashier&#x27;s checks, and traveler&#x27;s checks valued between and . This form is required to be kept on record at the financial institution for at least five years, and produced at the request of examiners or audit to verify compliance.

The &quot;Report of International Transportation of Currency or Monetary Instruments&quot;, also referred to as a Currency and Monetary Instrument Report (CMIR), must be filed by each person or institution that physically transports, mails, or ships, or causes to be physically transported, mailed, shipped, or received, currency, traveler&#x27;s checks, and certain other monetary instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding into or out of the United States must file a CMIR. It is identified as FinCEN Form 105 Report.

Banks are required to file a Designation of Exempt Person (FinCEN Form 110) to designate an exempt customer for the purpose of CTR reporting under the BSA. In addition, banks use this form once every two years to renew exemptions for eligible non-listed business and payroll customers.

It also requires any business receiving one or more related cash payments totaling more than to file IRS/FinCEN Form 8300.

==Sanctions==
There are heavy penalties for individuals and financial institutions that fail to file CTRs, MILs, or SARs. There are also penalties for banks who disclose to its client that it has filed a SAR about the client. Penalties include heavy fines and prison sentences. IRC §6038D requires that all U.S. persons, individuals, corporations, partnerships, LLCs, and trusts, provide timely information regarding their foreign accounts, otherwise a $10,000 penalty will result for every month it is late (subject to a certain maximum penalty).

In 1998, the Supreme Court ruled in &quot;United States v. Bajakajian&quot; that the government may not confiscate money from an individual for failure to report it on a Currency and Other Monetary Instruments Report (CMIR), as such punishment would be &quot;grossly disproportional to the gravity of [the] offense&quot; and unconstitutional under the Excessive Fines clause of the Eighth Amendment. Bajakajian and his family had tried to take $357,144 out of the United States in their luggage, and the government had seized it under the Bank Secrecy Act, which allows forfeiture of &quot;any property, real or personal, involved in such offense&quot;. It was the first time the Supreme Court struck down the federal government&#x27;s &quot;aggressive use of forfeiture&quot;.

In March 2010, Wachovia admitted to &quot;serious and systemic&quot; violations of the Bank Secrecy Act for laundering $378 billion between 2004 and 2007, the largest violation in terms of a dollar amount. It allowed Mexican and Colombian drug cartels to launder money through &quot;casas de cambio&quot; by willfully failing to set up an effective anti-money-laundering program.

In 2022, Arthur Hayes, entrepreneur and co-founder and former CEO of cryptocurrency exchange BitMEX, pled guilty to Bank Secrecy Act violations and was sentenced to six months of home detention, two years of probation, and a $10 million fine.

==Additional information==
An entire industry has developed around providing software to analyze transactions in an attempt to identify transactions or patterns of transactions called structuring, which requires SAR filing. Financial institutions are subject to penalties for failing to properly file CTRs and SARs, such as heavy fines and regulatory restrictions, including charter revocation.

These software applications effectively monitor customer transactions on a daily basis and, using a customer&#x27;s past transactions and account profile, provide a &quot;whole picture&quot; of the customer to the bank management. Transaction monitoring can include cash deposits and withdrawals, wire transfers, and ACH activity. In the banking industry, these applications are known as &quot;BSA software&quot; or &quot;anti-money laundering software&quot;.

<doc id="257230" wikidata="Q925037" url="?curid=257230" title="Thomas Heath (classicist)">
<text>Sir Thomas Little Heath (; 5 October 1861 – 16 March 1940) was a British civil servant, mathematician, classical scholar, historian of ancient Greek mathematics, translator, and mountaineer. He was educated at Clifton College. Heath translated works of Euclid of Alexandria, Apollonius of Perga, Aristarchus of Samos, and Archimedes of Syracuse into English.

==Life==
Heath was born in Barnetby-le-Wold, Lincolnshire, England, being the third son of a farmer, Samuel Heath, and his wife Mary Little. He had two brothers and three sisters. He was educated at Caistor Grammar School and Clifton College before entering Trinity College, Cambridge, where he was awarded an ScD in 1896 and became an Honorary Fellow in 1920. He got first class honours in both the classical tripos and mathematical tripos and was the twelfth wrangler in 1882. In 1884 he took the Civil Service examination and became an Assistant Secretary to the Treasury, finally becoming Joint Permanent Secretary to the Treasury and auditor of the Civil List in 1913. He held the position till 1919 when he was appointed as the comptroller of the National Debt Office, from which he retired at the end of 1926 because of age limitations. He was honoured for his work in the Civil Service by being appointed Companion of the Order of the Bath in 1903, Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in 1909, and Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order in 1916. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1912. He was a president of the Mathematical Association in 1922-23, and a fellow of the British Academy.

He had married professional musician Ada Mary Thomas in 1914; they had a son, Geoffrey Thomas Heath, and a daughter, Veronica Mary Heath. Heath&#x27;s son Geoffrey went to Trinity College, Cambridge, before becoming a teacher at Ampleforth College, and had 6 children. 

Heath died in Ashtead, Surrey, on 16 March 1940.

==Work==
Heath was distinguished for his work in ancient Greek mathematics and was the author of several books on ancient Greek mathematics. It is primarily through Heath&#x27;s translations that modern English-speaking readers are aware of what Archimedes did. His translation of the celebrated Archimedes Palimpsest, however, was based on a transcription that had lacunae, which scholars such as Reviel Netz have been able to fill in to a certain extent, by exploiting scientific methods of imagery not available in Heath&#x27;s time.

When Heath&#x27;s &quot;Works of Archimedes&quot; was published in 1897, the Archimedes Palimpsest had not been extensively explored. Its significance was not recognised until 1906, when it was examined by Danish professor Johan Ludvig Heiberg. The palimpsest contained an extended version of &quot;Stomachion&quot;, and a treatise entitled &quot;The Method of Mechanical Theorems&quot; that had previously been thought lost. These works have been a focus of research by later scholars.

<doc id="257231" wikidata="Q912969" url="?curid=257231" title="Sailor Pluto">
<text>is a fictional character in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga series written by Naoko Takeuchi. The alternate identity of , she is a member of the Sailor Guardians, female supernatural fighters who protect the Solar System from evil.

She is unique among all the characters in that she is stationed at the Door of Space-Time, with the specific duty of forbidding anyone to pass through it without permission. She possesses powers that are associated with time, space, the underworld, and darkness. She was one of several new characters introduced in the series&#x27; second arc (called &quot;Black Moon&quot; in the manga and &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, and &quot;Sailor Moon R&quot; in the first anime adaptation), which was comparable to a retool to continue &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; past the point it was originally supposed to end.

Her role and importance differ greatly between the first anime and manga (though her personality in the two media is mostly the same). A major part of the second arc in the original manga is Pluto and Chibiusa&#x27;s relationship, thus the two of them are important characters. In the anime, this relationship is not focused on and Pluto loses her prominence.

==Profile==
Sailor Pluto is not introduced until late in the &quot;Sailor Moon R&quot; series, though she appears earlier in the manga and &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, in the chapter/episode named after her, though this is still at the halfway point. She is the Guardian who guards the Gates of Time. She is first seen contacting Chibiusa through Luna-P in the anime; this does not happen in the manga or &quot;Crystal&quot;. In fact, this ability of Luna-P&#x27;s is anime-only. Sailor Pluto refers to Chibiusa as &quot;Small Lady.&quot; Chibiusa usually calls Sailor Pluto by the nickname &quot;Puu&quot;. She acts as Chibiusa&#x27;s guardian in the anime, but is more of a friend in the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot; and her deference to the future queen is apparent. She is also very good friends with Diana, which makes sense considering Diana is to Luna and Artemis what Chibiusa is to Usagi and Mamoru, and occasionally trusts her to watch the Door of Space-Time. Overall, Pluto in the manga seems to be good with children, which is probably why she ends up working as a nurse at Chibiusa&#x27;s school in the fifth arc. She also mentors Ami/Sailor Mercury in the fourth arc, allowing her to power up to her Super form.
After the events of the second story arc, she leaves the gates of time to temporarily live as a normal human, joins Sailors Uranus and Neptune, and becomes a university student studying physics. At this point, she gains the civilian identity &quot;Setsuna Meioh&quot; where previously it seems Pluto had none, unique among the ten main Solar System Guardians. The exact nature of how she leaves her post differs between versions: in the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot;, she is reincarnated in the present-day by Neo-Queen Serenity after sacrificing herself during the second arc while for unknown reasons she still appears in the future in the fifth arc; and the anime gives no explicit reason for her appearing in the third season, she just shows up with a previously unmentioned civilian form with no apparent consequences. This is most likely due to Pluto&#x27;s sacrifice not happening in &quot;R&quot; and the Infinity arc requiring her presence. Neo-Queen Serenity was also never established as having the ability to reincarnate people in the anime. The identity of who set Pluto at the time door and gave her the taboos and when this might have happened are also never stated in the anime.

Even in her civilian form, Setsuna is the oldest of the girls, around her late teens or older. Her personality has been described as distant and somewhat lonely; however, she does consistently display warmth and affection for Chibiusa. When she reincarnates, she becomes more friendly, but is still not very emotional, although there are moments in the manga where she expresses much more emotion than the anime (she loosens up enough that she brings alcohol to a minor&#x27;s birthday party). She later cares for Hotaru along with Michiru and Haruka; this happens at the end of the Infinity arc in the manga, but not until the fifth and final arc in the anime (which was shorter than the previous four arcs).

She does not seem to have any non-Guardian contacts in the anime, which is in sharp contrast both to the other Guardians in that continuity and the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot;. In the latter, she befriends Reika Nishimura as they attend the same college and are around the same age. They may also share an interest in fashion. In fact, as soon as Uranus and Neptune show up in the anime, Pluto loses her independence and does whatever they do, despite not being as harsh towards the Inners for their idealism. Contrariwise in the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot;, Setsuna is Haruka and Michiru&#x27;s equal and she even attempts to investigate the strange going-ons at Infinity Academy by herself before she reawakens as Sailor Pluto, for instance, by buying one of Tellu&#x27;s Tellun plants (who she later kills).

Unlike the other Guardians (excluding Sailor Venus, who has been described as a goddess before), it is questioned whether she is fully human—she has been described as &quot;a goddess, eternally guarding the Portal of Space and Time.&quot; She was born under the sun sign Scorpio, whose modern ruling planet is Pluto, though sometimes Pluto is said to co-rule with Mars, Scorpio&#x27;s traditional ruling planet.

In the anime, Sailor Pluto appears in relatively few episodes (despite being the sixth Sailor Guardian introduced) and does not really do anything of consequence, even her sacrifice comes off as existing simply because it was in the manga and the writers felt the need to include it, despite the circumstances not being as dire and heart-wrenching. Unlike Sailor Neptune and Sailor Uranus, she is sympathetic toward the Inners and assists them on several occasions. During the second story arc, she allows them to travel through time even though this is not ordinarily allowed. In the third story arc, she often extends help or advice to Sailor Moon and her companions even when Sailors Uranus and Neptune want the two groups separate. Later, Setsuna joins the Sailor Guardians in investigating the true identity of ChibiChibi.

Sailor Pluto has additional, less cited spheres of dominion in her manga and &quot;Crystal&quot; incarnation, influences that are vaguely suggested in the anime, but never made explicit. Sailor Pluto is much darker in the black-and-white manga than in color illustrations and both anime series (something which has not gone unnoticed by the Western fandom; her skin color also is not consistent among seasons with her appearance in &quot;R&quot; as being extremely pale, as a bit darker in &quot;S&quot;, and lastly flat-out orange in &quot;Stars&quot;. In &quot;Crystal&quot;, she is dark enough to tell she is not the same shade as everyone else which is fairly consistent with how Takeuchi draws her in her color pictures). She is identified as the &quot;Guardian of the Underworld&quot; wearing a black-themed sailor suit. She is also stated to be the daughter of Chronos, the god of time. She is ruthless and follows rather exacting laws, executing any intruders who dare violate the underworld in search for the Gates of Time. She nearly kills Sailor Moon before realizing who she is, stating that &quot;all who break the taboo must be eliminated.&quot; Luna also states to the others that no one is to even know that Sailor Pluto exists, due to her dominion and nature, and that to her knowledge no one has ever seen her. Luna calls her a &quot;lone warrior,&quot; noting the sadness in her eyes. In the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot;, not even the cats know she exists at first.

In the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot;, Pluto&#x27;s death scene vaguely implies a romantic interest in Endymion, though this is never explored again. In the Sailor Moon musicals, Sailor Pluto has an unrequited love for King Endymion. It is explicitly mentioned in &quot;Eien Denetsu&quot; and &quot;Shin-Densetsu Kourin&quot;, in the song Onna no Ronsou (&quot;Woman&#x27;s Conflicts&quot;). In the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot;, it can only be inferred from depictions of Pluto blushing while around King Endymion and her reaction when he runs to comfort her during her death. Various situations in the musicals have shown Pluto&#x27;s unrequited love; for example, Tuxedo Mask&#x27;s actor, Yūta Mochizuki being leaned on by the actress of Sailor Pluto, Rei Saitou, and commenting on his new year&#x27;s resolution: to be by Pluto&#x27;s side. It is entirely possible she only has a crush on King Endymion and not on any of the other forms of Mamoru Chiba. Since King Endymion only appears in person in the Black Moon arc, it makes sense why it never appears outside of that story line.

A small quirk occurs in continuity between the manga and anime. Sailor Pluto (temporarily) expires in both, but at different times; her death in the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot; occurs much earlier and reawakens the good side of Black Lady, a corrupted Chibiusa, due to remembering her friendship with Pluto as she watches her die. This is also the point where Sailor Chibimoon appears, again much earlier than in the anime. However, for all intents and purposes, in the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot; the technicality of Sailor Pluto existing outside of time means she is able to be reincarnated as a normal woman while still existing back at her post at the Time Gate (though this does not cause problems in the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot; continuity to begin with). Alternately, she reincarnates backwards, so the Setsuna known in seasons 3-5 will become the Sailor Pluto seen in season 2.

==Aspects and forms==
As a character with different incarnations, special powers, transformations, and a long lifetime spanning the Silver Millennium and the 30th century, Setsuna gains multiple aspects and aliases as the series progresses.

===Sailor Pluto===
Setsuna&#x27;s primary identity is that of a Sailor Guardian. Her sailor suit theme colors are black and garnet and in its first iteration has no sleeves and a jewel hanging from the choker. These colors never change. During the manga&#x27;s Black Moon arc, she is depicted with a chain of keys around her waist. This accessory is included in her &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; character design, but was absent from the first anime. She is given specific titles throughout the various series, including Guardian of Change, Guardian of Revolution, Guardian of the Afterlife, and, most commonly, Guardian of Time. Her personality is not noticeably different in civilian form, much like the other Sailor Guardians seen.

Sailor Pluto has power over both time and space and is ordinarily stationed at the Space-Time Door (a time travelling gate) to prevent its use. When charged with this duty by Queen Serenity, she was given three &quot;taboos&quot;, rules which she was forbidden to disobey: she must not travel through time, she must not abandon her post at the Door, and she must never cause time to stop. If she does stop time, once time continues she will slowly die. Throughout the course of the series, Sailor Pluto breaks all three of these rules.

As she grows stronger, Sailor Pluto gains additional powers and at key points her uniform changes to reflect this. The first change takes place in act 44 of the manga, when she obtains the Pluto Crystal and her outfit becomes similar to that of Super Sailor Moon. She is not given a new title. A similar event takes place in episode 167 of the anime and she is given the name Super Sailor Pluto. A third form appears in Act 49 of the manga, unnamed but similar to Eternal Sailor Moon (without wings). In the official visual book for Sailor Moon Eternal, this form was named &quot;Eternal Sailor Pluto&quot;.

===Princess Pluto===
In Silver Millennium, Sailor Pluto was also the princess of her home world. She was among those given the duty of protecting the Solar System from outside invasion. As Princess Pluto, she dwelt in Charon Castle and wore a black gown—she appears in this form in manga act 48 as well as in supplementary art.
==Special powers and items==

Setsuna is not shown using any special powers while in civilian form. She must first transform by either raising her hand or using a special device called the Lip Rod in the anime into the air and shouting a special phrase, originally &quot;Pluto Planet Power, Make up!&quot; In the manga she eventually gains her Pluto Crystal and this phrase changes to evoke &quot;Pluto Crystal Power&quot;. In the anime, although she does upgrade to Super Sailor Pluto, the Sailor Crystal is never mentioned and her transformation is not shown on screen.

She wields the Garnet Rod, a gigantic key which is topped by the Garnet Orb and a heart. The orb is one of three items necessary for Sailor Saturn&#x27;s awakening and a reference to one of Japan&#x27;s Imperial Regalia: the jewel. The reason for garnet specifically being associated with Sailor Pluto is probably due to an elaborate pun regarding her underworld-based powers and mythology. The Japanese name for garnet is &quot;pomegranate stone&quot; and pomegranates were the food of the underworld in the Greek myth of Persephone becoming Hades&#x27; (aka Pluto&#x27;s) wife. Therefore, the Guardian of the underworld king planet (Pluto) incorporates garnet into her outfit and weapon. However, there being a heart-shaped region on Pluto was an accident as there was no way for Takeuchi to know what Pluto looked like in real life until 2015. The Time Keys around her waist look like mini Garnet Rods; these keys are the only way to travel through time.

Sailor Pluto&#x27;s powers over time and space are somewhat tied with the destructive power of Sailor Saturn for astrological and mythological reasons. The names of Sailor Pluto&#x27;s attacks include frequent reference to the underworld (in Act 32 of the manga, she states that she &quot;carries the protection of the planet of the underworld, Pluto.&quot;), which was the province of Pluto in Roman myth; this is evident in her first named power, , which is her primary attack throughout the first anime. Unlike any other attack in the series, its name is whispered rather than shouted when she uses it.

In the manga, Sailor Pluto demonstrates a few other named powers, including and the defensive force field &quot;Garnet Ball&quot;.

Sailor Pluto has enough power over time to stop it entirely and although she is forbidden to do so, she uses this power one time each in the anime and manga. In the manga, &quot;Crystal&quot;, and the musicals &quot;Tanjou! Ankoku no Princess Black Lady&quot; and its revision &quot;Tanjou! Ankoku no Princess Black Lady (Kaiteiban)-Wakusei Nemesis no Nazo&quot;, she uses it to stop Prince Demand from touching the Silver Crystals of the past and future together, which would destroy the universe in a time paradox. In the anime, she uses this power to allow Sailors Uranus and Neptune to escape from a helicopter explosion. In each case, she sacrifices herself on pain of death, but is reinstated later in the series.

In addition to these powers, when the Space-Time Door has been misused, Sailor Pluto is able to close off passage to other worlds. At the end of the manga&#x27;s Infinity arc (corresponds to the anime&#x27;s S season), Sailor Saturn asks her to seal off the gateway to the world Pharaoh 90 had come from forever. This is done with .

All of Sailor Pluto&#x27;s attacks require the use of the Garnet Rod, which is shaped like a giant key as a symbol of her stewardship over the Door of Space-Time. In Roman mythology, it is stated that the god Pluto holds a key because &quot;they say that what is called Hades has been locked up by Pluto, and that nobody will return back again therefrom.&quot; Natale Conti cites Pausanias in noting that keys are an attribute of Pluto as the scepter is of Jove (Roman Zeus) and the trident of Neptune (Poseidon). The Pluto Crystal is perhaps her most important possession, as it is her Sailor Crystal and the source of all her power, which becomes especially important in the fifth story arc. It is given to her by Sailor Saturn.

==Development==
The statistics listed for Setsuna in the back of manga volume 10 are unusual in that most of them never come up in the series itself. Her favorite school subject is given as physics, which tracks with her stated college major in theoretical physics, and the love of green tea attributed to her is common among Japanese people. More incongruously, however, she is listed as skilled in sewing, with a dream of becoming a fashion designer. These interests are never spoken of in the actual story, although creator Naoko Takeuchi drew concept art of Setsuna in outfits worn by real-life supermodels. Likewise, Setsuna is never actually shown to enjoy shopping nor to dislike cockroaches, eggplant, or the study of music, yet all of these things are delineated by Takeuchi well after the character&#x27;s introduction. In fact, almost nothing about her personal life or interests is ever revealed. It is not even clear whether she has a civilian history at all, as time travel and multiple deaths and reincarnations complicate any backstory. Her devotion to the life of a Sailor Guardian, too, may have cut her off from worldly dreams, as it did with Sailors Uranus and Neptune (which may be the reason she appears to be distant and lonely at first). Likewise she doesn&#x27;t display any personality traits associated with Scorpios despite being born under the sign; it seems to have been picked solely for its astrological significance. Also, according to Naoko Takeuchi&#x27;s notes in the various artbooks, she mentions that &quot;Setsuna wears hotpants as well at home, but basically she also likes long skirts&quot; and that she believes &quot;Setsuna should forever wear white clothes&quot;.

The kanji of Setsuna&#x27;s surname translates as and . Together, they constitute most of the name of the dwarf planet Pluto in Japanese: . Her given name is in hiragana which is a loanword from Sanskrit &quot;ksana&quot;, means &quot;moment&quot; , fitting in with her time-based powers.

The packaging of Irwin dolls released in Canada in 1998 called her by the name Celia. When her civilian form debuted in the third season originally dubbed by Cloverway Inc., she was instead called Trista (while her last name was kept as Meioh).

===Actresses===
In the Japanese dub of the first anime, she is voiced by Chiyoko Kawashima. In the Japanese dub of &quot;Crystal&quot; and all media since, she is voiced by Ai Maeda.

In the stage musicals, Setsuna has been played by 10 actresses: Miwa Hosoki, Rei Saitou, Yuki Kamiya, Seiko Nakazawa, Teruyo Watanabe, Yuko Hosaka, Yukiko Nakae, Miho Yokoi, Mikako Ishii and Chisato Minami . In one show, &quot;Usagi * Ai no Senshi e no Michi&quot;, she appeared only as a silhouette and was portrayed by Noriko Kamiyama.

In the DIC Entertainment English dub, when her voice is heard through Rini&#x27;s Luna Ball, her voice is provided by Luna&#x27;s voice actress Jill Frappier (the dubbers may have mistakenly thought Luna was talking instead of a new character). Sabrina Grdevich voices her during her physical appearances in &quot;Sailor Moon R&quot; and the two movies she appears in, where she sounds like a valley girl very much out-of-character with how Pluto is portrayed in the Japanese dub and manga. In the Cloverway English dub, she&#x27;s voiced by Susan Aceron. In the Viz Media English dub, she&#x27;s voiced by Veronica Taylor.

==Reception and influence==
The official &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; character popularity polls listed Setsuna Meioh and Sailor Pluto as separate entities. In 1994, with fifty one choices, Setsuna was the thirteenth most popular character and Pluto was fifth. In early 1996, with fifty one choices, Setsuna was the twenty-ninth most popular character and Pluto was the twenty-first.

In her reviews of the second season of &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, IGN writer Meghan Sullivan considered the introduction of Sailor Pluto as one of the exciting twists of Act 19, noting that she takes her duties as a Sailor Guardian so seriously, &quot;she&#x27;s willing to kill her own allies just to protect the Door of Space-Time.&quot; Sullivan especially enjoyed the interaction between Pluto and Chibiusa over magic tricks, since the viewer had the chance to see &quot;a more tender side to her; it fleshed out her personality and made her endearing.&quot; The scene in which Queen Serenity talks with a young Sailor Pluto about the taboos she must not break was described by Sullivan as an &quot;adorable moment&quot; but that foreshadows &quot;something dire was going to happen&quot;. Nonetheless, she enjoyed watching the younger Pluto taking her duties seriously. Finally, the author said that the penultime episode of the season should not be named &quot;Showdown, Death Phantom&quot; but &quot;Heroine, Sailor Pluto&quot;, since she &quot;knew she was going to die once she left the Space-Time door and used her Garnet Rod to stop time, but she didn&#x27;t care. All she could think about was saving her friends from eminent destruction.&quot; Sullivan also praised the voice acting of Ai Maeda during the episode.

==Governance==
Nag&#x27;s Head Town Centre is a shopping arcade between Morrisons and Selby&#x27;s, and it is governed by the Nag&#x27;s Head Town Centre Management Group.

==Geography==
The name refers to the junction of Holloway Road (the A1) with Seven Sisters Road, where the Nag&#x27;s Head pub stood, and also to the surrounding area, particularly the stretch of Holloway Road between the former pub and its junction with Camden Road.

<doc id="257236" wikidata="Q7802241" url="?curid=257236" title="Tillamook County Creamery Association">
<text>The Tillamook County Creamery Association (TCCA) is a farmer-owned dairy cooperative headquartered in Tillamook County, Oregon, United States. The association manufactures and sells dairy products under the &quot;Tillamook&quot; brand name. Its main facility is the Tillamook Creamery, located two miles north of the city of Tillamook on U.S. Route 101.

According to the trade magazine Dairy Foods, Tillamook, the 44th largest dairy processor in North America, posted $1 billion in sales in 2021. TCCA employs nearly 900 people in Oregon and is the largest employer in Tillamook County. The brand is strongest on the West Coast but sells in all 50 states. It routinely wins awards from the American Cheese Society and other groups.

The cooperative includes nearly 60 dairy farms, mostly within Tillamook County. The cooperative markets several processed dairy products, including cheese, ice cream, butter, sour cream, and yogurt, some of which are manufactured by the cooperative itself and other products which are produced under licensing agreements with various partner companies. Their most notable product is Tillamook cheese, including the most popular cheese: Tillamook Cheddar. In March 2010, Tillamook&#x27;s Medium Cheddar cheese won the gold medal in the 2010 World Cheese Championship Cheese Contest hosted by the Wisconsin Cheese Makers Association in Madison, Wisconsin. The cheese scored 99.6 out of 100 points possible, beating 59 other entries.

== History ==

The Tillamook Valley was ideal for dairy cattle in the mid-19th century, but transporting the milk and butter over the mountains surrounding the valley was a problem. In 1854, several farmers from the county built a schooner named the &quot;Morning Star&quot; to transport butter to Portland, Oregon; the schooner is now featured as part of the co-op&#x27;s logo, and a replica (constructed in 1992 by master shipwright Richard Miles of Aberdeen, WA) is on display at The Tillamook Cheese Factory. Peter McIntosh and T. S. Townsend established the county&#x27;s first cheese factory in 1894. The association was founded by ten independent creameries in 1909. TCCA hired an ad agency and began campaigning in 1917 in Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Portland.

Under secretary-manager George R. Lawson (CEO- 1944-1950), the cooperative began producing rindless cheese in 1946 and bottled milk the following year. In 1949, partnering with four independent plants and with financing arranged through First National Bank, the Tillamook Cheese Factory north of Tillamook was built. The enlarged facility included a storage plant and traffic department.

Columbia River Processing, Inc., a second cheese-making facility, was built in Boardman, Oregon in September 2001. Its production capacity doubled TCCA&#x27;s cheesemaking capabilities.

In 2009, Tillamook County Creamery Association celebrated 100 years in business.

==Tillamook Creamery==


The Tillamook Cheese Factory, located at 4165 U.S. 101 North in Tillamook, Oregon, is the Tillamook County Creamery Association&#x27;s original cheese production facility. The Tillamook Cheese Factory also has a visitor center, the Tillamook Creamery, and hosts over 1.3 million tourists annually. Visitors can learn about the cheesemaking process, cheese packaging process, and the ice cream-making process from a viewing gallery over the main production floor. Tours are self-guided, self-paced, and augmented by video presentations and interactive kiosks.

Tours inside the actual cheese processing area of the plant were discontinued in 1967 due to health and safety regulations. A new visitors center was opened in June 2018 with of exhibit and viewing space. The center also includes a dining area and gift store.

The Tillamook Cheese Factory produces more than 170,000 pounds of cheese daily and packages approximately one million pounds on-site each week. The factory warehouse can age 50 million pounds of cheese. The cooperative also operates the aforementioned cheesemaking facilities in Boardman, Oregon and contracts some of its packaging and distribution to Marathon Cheese in Mountain Home, Idaho and Great Lakes Cheese in Salt Lake City.

==Marketing==
Tillamook had a &quot;Loaf Love Tour&quot; featuring customized Volkswagen &quot;Baby Loaf&quot; busses that sample cheese at grocery stores and community events. Tillamook commercials on television include its &quot;Food Loves Tillamook&quot; campaign, &quot;Dairy Done Right&quot; campaign, and &quot;Goodbye Big Food, Hello Real Food&quot; campaign. Tillamook sponsored the Grilled Cheese Invitational in 2010 and 2011.

==Controversy==
TCCA bought the cheese cooperative in Bandon, Oregon in 2000. After buying the Bandon Cheese factory and its brand name, Tillamook&#x27;s lawyers warned several South Coast businesses with &quot;Bandon&quot; in their names that they might need to make a &quot;content change&quot; to avoid confusion with the cheese. This controversy made international news, particularly in 400-year-old Bandon, Ireland, where residents have milked cows for generations.

The cooperative ran into additional controversy in 2004 with its attempted enforcement of the Tillamook Cheese and Bandon Cheese trademarks against local businesses such as Tillamook Country Smoker, a purveyor of jerky and smoked meats for over 30 years. The creamery tried to stop the meat company from using the name &quot;Tillamook&quot;. In that 2004 case, a federal judge ruled that Tillamook Country Smoker could register its name as a trademark, but that Tillamook Country Smoker could not use or register the Tillamook Jerky mark.

However, the move that garnered Tillamook the most nationwide attention came in 2005 after a slew of consumer inquiries about dairies&#x27; use of a genetically engineered bovine growth hormone designed to boost milk production. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration had said milk products derived from cows injected with the hormone were safe, but consumer worries about potential cancer risks persisted. Over objections from some member farmers and biotechnology giant Monsanto, which manufactured the hormone, Tillamook County Creamery Association voted to require all of its dairy suppliers to phase out its use. Tillamook was one of the first big national dairy brands to make such a decision.

In early 2018, a large &quot;mega-dairy&quot; near Boardman, Oregon, producing milk for Tillamook, was fined and ultimately sued by the state of Oregon for repeated violations of its wastewater permit. The mega-dairy, Oregon&#x27;s second-largest, was approved by state regulators for 30,000 cows in early 2017 despite opposition from local and national environmental and animal welfare groups and small-farm advocates. Shortly after state regulators sued the facility, Tillamook stated that it had terminated its contract, but continued to purchase milk from the operation.

<doc id="257240" wikidata="Q913373" url="?curid=257240" title="Sailor Saturn">
<text>is a fictional supporting character in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga, the 1992–1997 anime series created by Naoko Takeuchi and the 2014–2023 reboot that more closely follows the manga. Her spirit resides deep within twelve-year-old , a frail middle schoolgirl who is her lookalike reincarnation, which makes Sailor Saturn her alter ego; entirely apart from how the other nine Sailor Guardians are reborn and their human identities remain entirely separate.
She is the tenth and last of the Sailor Guardians of the long gone Moon Kingdom to be introduced, possessing immensely strong dark powers associated with silence and ruin, nothingness and the void, destruction and death, annihilation and rebirth. Her powers made her a potential threat as she can wipe out a planet and even an entire Star System or reset its evolution. Her deathly powers are necessary for rejuvenation and re-creation to complement Sailor Moon&#x27;s mighty powers of healing and rejuvenation with powerful moonlight from the Silver Crystal.

==Profile==

Prior to the main events of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, when Hotaru was eight years old, she lived with her parents in Tokyo&#x27;s Sankakusu District when a freak storm occurred causing a fire that killed her mother Keiko and left her on the verge of death herself. Later admitting that she was meant to die at the time, Hotaru&#x27;s life was unnaturally prolonged by both the actions of her father Souichi Tomoe turning her into a cyborg and being made a host to the Daimon Mistress 9 whose presence caused Hotaru&#x27;s body to suffer seizures with only the Tairon Crystal appearing to reduce the pain, only seen in &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&#x27;s&quot; thirteen-episode third season. Wearing clothes to conceal her altered body, unaware of Mistress 9&#x27;s existence prior, Hotaru was friendless before meeting her best friend, Chibiusa.

By the time she realized Mistress 9&#x27;s existence, she loses her body to the Daimon as she steals Chibiusa&#x27;s Silver Crystal to fully regain her strength. Hotaru is also revealed to be the reincarnation of Sailor Saturn who was responsible for destroying the last remnants of the fallen Moon Kingdom Silver Millenium so it can begin anew of Earth. This fact and her power made her feared by the Outer Guardians as they initially intended to kill Hotaru and seal her soul before she could awaken and destroy Earth. But Hotaru, seemingly destroyed when Mistress 9 ripped herself out of the human&#x27;s body, ended up awakening as Sailor Saturn when Pharaoh 90 appeared and Sailor Moon appeared to have died in a gambit. Though Saturn intended to destroy Earth along with Pharaoh 90, she stops the destruction upon seeing Sailor Moon alive and deemed destroying Earth to make way for the new Silver Millenium not necessary. She then drives Pharaoh 90 to his domain while sacrificing herself to ensure he remains trapped, though Sailor Moon&#x27;s restoration brings Hotaru back to Earth as an infant. With her father dead, Hotaru becomes the adopted daughter of Haruka Tenoh, Michiru Kaioh and Setsuna Meioh as the four of them reside at an Empire Victorian House.

In the first anime, Hotaru&#x27;s story is mostly the same except that she was &quot;not&quot; modified into a cyborg and Mistress 9 had a stronger influence that played a role in her being ostracized by her classmates. Her father also survived the Death Busters&#x27; defeat and was allowed to raise her until Setsuna asks for her help in the first part of &quot;Sailor Moon Sailor Stars&quot;.

Hotaru&#x27;s age fluctuates during the series; she is first introduced as a twelve-year-old, is reborn as an infant due to Sailor Saturn&#x27;s spirit forever within her, quickly develops into a young four or five-year-old child around then reaches her proper chronological age after a metaphysical epiphany with Sailor Saturn herself appearing before her to &quot;wake up.&quot; When not transformed, her body retains the smaller height of a five-year-old; the exact same height she gained since being reborn.

In the musicals, Professor Souichi Tomoe is only present in a few stages, though Sailor Saturn appears in every musical from the third on. In musicals where Tomoe is absent, Hotaru is presented as being in the care of Haruka and Michiru. During &quot;Last Dracul Jokyoku&quot;, Hotaru is presented in the care of Professor Tomoe, knowing of the existence of the Sailor Soldiers, yet not awakening as Sailor Saturn until halfway through the musical.

Naoko Takeuchi, the series creator, describes her as delicate, quiet, precocious, and expressionless.

==Aspects and Forms==
As a character with special powers, ever evolving transformations and a long lifetime virtually spanning between the Silver Millennium era and the 30th century, Hotaru gains multiple aspects and aliases from both her separate personalities (until Mistress 9 is fully expelled) as the series progresses.

In the original anime&#x27;s fifth and final season, her Eternal form is never seen neither is her transformation sequence into her Super Sailor form.

===Sailor Saturn===
Sailor Saturn wears a dark blue-violet uniform with a pale maroon bow in the front of her chest with a silver crystalline brooch and in the back of her miniskirt. The initial version of this uniform has petal-shaped sleeves, a windrose brooch and choker with the same kind of windrose, bellflower-shaped white gloves, and knee-high, lace up boots. She is given various specific titles, including Guardian of Silence, Guardian of Destruction, and Guardian of Ruin and Rebirth.

Sailor Saturn carries the Silence Glaive, which she may use to bring about the destruction of a world or worlds with a single swing. She also has the ability to heal minor wounds in both her civilian and Guardian forms, having healed Chibiusa when she was attacked by a Daimon, though the process weakens her which was more detrimental while she had Mistress 9 in her body.

In her past life, Sailor Saturn lived far from Silver Millennium and only appears during a crisis with the Three Talismans of her fellow Outer Guardians serving as keys to summon her once the items were brought together. Because of their distance from Silver Millennium and each other, Saturn and the Outer Guardians were not intended to be reborn. But as Hotaru theorized, the events caused by the Death Busters played a key role in her awakening when she was originally meant to die and the Outer Guardians allowed to live normal lives.
Sailor Saturn gains additional powers as the series progresses, and at key points her uniform changes to reflect this. The first change takes place in Act 44 of the manga, when she obtains the Saturn Crystal and her outfit becomes similar to that of Super Sailor Moon. She is not given a new title. A similar event takes place in Episode 168 of the anime, and she is given the name Super Sailor Saturn. A third form appears in Act 49 of the manga, unnamed but similar to Eternal Sailor Moon (without wings). In the official visual book for Sailor Moon Eternal, this form was named &quot;Eternal Sailor Saturn&quot;.

===Princess Saturn===
According to the manga, on Silver Millennium, Sailor Saturn was also the princess of her home planet. She was among those given the duty of protecting the Solar System from outside invasion. As Princess Saturn, she dwelt in Titan Castle and wore a purple gown—she appears in this form in the original manga and in supplementary art. Unlike the other Sailor Guardians, it is stated that Saturn did not awaken on Silver Millennium until after it was destroyed so Princess Saturn&#x27;s exact status during that time is unclear.

===Mistress 9===

During the third story arc of the manga and the anime adaptations, Hotaru&#x27;s body was possessed by a parasitic Daimon known as Mistress 9 since she was four years old, whereas the Sailor Guardian of Death and Rebirth had inhabited Hotaru since birth. Mistress 9 eventually took over Hotaru&#x27;s body and distorted it into an adult-like form, eventually destroying it when Mistress 9 is ripped out of her host&#x27;s body. In the first anime, retaining her sense and defying the extraterrestrial parasite, like in the manga and its 2014-2023 reboot, Hotaru fully awakened, as one with Sailor Saturn herself, and ultimately destroyed Mistress 9&#x27;s persona at the cost of her physical self.

A vision of the solitary Sailor Guardian of Space-Time of the Outer Solar System had told Chibiusa of how Mistress 9 was expelled with the help of Sailor Moon, thus enabling Hotaru to live her life anew with Sailor Saturn&#x27;s vital essence still within her until the renowned Sailor Guardian of Ruin and Rebirth&#x27;s full powers of death and destruction, annihilation and silence, would be needed once again for an additional crisis.

===Mysterious Girl===
In the musical &quot;Yume Senshi - Ai - Eien ni...&quot; and its revision, &quot;Yume Senshi - Ai - Eien ni... Saturn Fukkatsu Hen!&quot;, Hotaru takes the alias of a nameless girl while under the control of the Dead Moon Circus, who beat and ridicule her. Her memories are seemingly erased and she is given the powers to enter and alter people&#x27;s dreams. Only Sailors Uranus, Neptune and Pluto realize who she really is. In the original musical, it is only implied that she is Hotaru, and it is stated but not shown that she is Sailor Saturn. Her actual awakening as Saturn is also ambiguous, while implied, it&#x27;s not shown and she is simply shown as a normal girl at the end of the musical. In the revision, her identity as Hotaru is stated plainly, and she awakens on-stage as Saturn, after being saved by the other Sailor Guardians and appears transformed moments later.

===Kon===
In all four of the &quot;Kaguya Island&quot; musicals, Hotaru is possessed by a spirit named Kon, who speaks through Hotaru to the other Sailor Guardians. When Hotaru awakens she has no memory of what happened while Kon possessed her body. Kon is the remnant of stars destroyed by Dark Plasman and the comet Coatl. In the first two of these musicals, she gives her power to Sailor Moon in the final battle to allow her to transform into Eternal Sailor Moon. Kon was given the song &quot;Hitosuji no Hikari no Kokoro&quot; in her appearances.

==Special powers and items==

While several Sailor Guardians have unusual powers as civilians, Hotaru&#x27;s are numerous and varied in both her civilian and ever evolving Sailor forms. Some of these are portrayed only in the third story arc, such as her past life existing as a secondary personality that unconsciously transmits visions to the other Sailor Guardians of incoming disasters that would lead to her eventual awakening. Prior to her awakening, Hotaru displayed the ability to involuntarily create force-fields and energy beams whenever in danger and heal minor flesh wounds. Her possession by Mistress 9 also revealed her ability to exist as a disembodied spirit as long as her physical self is intact.

Due to the destructive nature of her powers, Hotaru would be reborn as an infant immediately upon fulfilling her task as Sailor Saturn in an event that ends with her demise. The infant Hotaru would later grow to her former within a matter of days should she need to reawaken, with a visitation by the soul of her past life completing the process.

Sailor Uranus, Sailor Neptune, and Sailor Pluto gained their second transformation when Hotaru gives them their Sailor Crystals while she regained her original twelve-year-old body upon reconnecting with her past memories and bonding with Sailor Saturn herself. In the anime, Hotaru is still an infant when Sailor Saturn&#x27;s mighty power floods Sailors&#x27; Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, upgrading them and herself to their evolved Super forms. In both versions, Hotaru has visions of coming events, especially of danger, and can project these visions to other people. When she is a young girl, she creates a small projection of the galaxy which hovers in the air in her room, simulating astronomical history at high speed. However, it is only in the manga that Haruka stays with her while she reproduces these events to help keep her increasingly powerful abilities in check.

Hotaru&#x27;s transformation into Sailor Saturn is very rare indeed. The transformation sequence into her standard Sailor form is never shown in the main series, although one of the video games included a shortened transformation sequence, which she initiated by raising her hand in the air (like the other Sailor Soldiers) and shouting &quot;Saturn Planet Power, Make up!&quot;. In the manga she eventually gains her Saturn Crystal and does transform in front of the other Soldiers, evoking &quot;Saturn Crystal Power! Make Up!&quot;. In the anime, although she does upgrade to Super Sailor Saturn, the command &quot;Saturn Crystal Power&quot; is never mentioned and her transformation is again not shown on-screen.

Sailor Saturn&#x27;s powers are mostly based on Roman mythology, in which Saturn is the god of the harvest. In Western astrology, the planet Saturn is known as &quot;the Greater Malefic&quot;, &quot;the Old Taskmaster&quot; and &quot;the Grim Reaper.&quot; Calling herself a &quot;harbinger of death&quot;, referred by others as the Forbidden Guardian, Saturn&#x27;s primary role is execute total annihilation and is normally summoned as a final resort when all hope is lost. Such an example is Saturn wiping out what remained of Silver Millennium after Metaria destroyed most of it, which made the Outer Guardians greatly fear her as they did not fully understand her purpose at the time. Saturn&#x27;s signature weapon is her Silence Glaive, which is referenced by Sailor Neptune as the &quot;scythe of the Goddess of Death,&quot;. This is made apparent as a single swing of the Silence Glaive is enough to destroy an entire world. The Roman god Saturn is often depicted carrying a scythe or sickle, which became symbolic of harvesting human souls at the end of their lifespan.

When first awakened during the Mugen Academy incident, a result of Sailor Moon&#x27;s apparent demise, Saturn&#x27;s first act was deeming Earth beyond salvation while fatally weakening Master Pharaoh 90 with her &quot;Death Reborn Revolution.&quot; The kanji used with this maneuver translate to , with the intended pronunciation given in furigana. But when Sailor Moon remerges alive and unharmed, Saturn renounces her intent of destroying Earth and deliberately allows herself to be sealed away in Master Pharaoh 90&#x27;s dimension while he is escaping. In the original anime&#x27;s third season, Saturn will die from using the attack, only to be saved by Super Sailor Moon at the last moment as she obliterated Pharaoh 90 from existence with incredibly powerful bursts of purple destructive energy.

When Sailor Saturn returns near the end of the fourth story arc (which actually overflows into the beginning of the fifth season), a couple more attacks are introduced. She defends herself and her allies with , a dome of dark energy that deflects attacks, and attacks with . In the anime this attack is used against Nehellenia; seeing no other way to defeat her, Saturn intends to bring down her Glaive and destroy everything and everyone, but before she manages to strike the ground Sailor Chibi Moon throws herself at Saturn to stop her from completing the action and sacrificing her life, nevertheless, the Glaive releases massively destructive power that destroys most of Queen Nehellenia&#x27;s palace.

In the manga and &quot;Crystal&quot; series, the Death Busters use a power source called the Taioron Crystal which is the life source of their home world. One fragment somehow ended up in the possession of Hotaru&#x27;s late mother, Keiko Tomoe, with Professor Tomoe giving the item to Hotaru in order to ease her seizures while nourishing Mistress 9 until the Daimon stole Chibiusa&#x27;s Legendary Silver Crystal of the thirtieth century. The Saturn Crystal is her Sailor Crystal and the source of all her power, which becomes especially important in the fourth and fifth sagas.

==Development==
In the original character sketches, Takeuchi drew Sailor Saturn with a brown staff rather than her Silence Glaive. Her Sailor Uniform was also different with purple sleeves rather than white, there was no windrose on her chest, and the third band on her gloves was sheer with a point. Her choker also differed from the final version having a gold 6-pointed star rather than the present choker.

The kanji of Hotaru&#x27;s surname translate as and . The former comes from the name of her planet in Japanese, . Her given name is in hiragana and so its meaning is not inherent, but the word itself means &quot;firefly&quot; , and this meaning is used at least once as a pun. Fireflies are associated with spirits of the dead in Japanese mythology, referring to her status as the Soldier of death and rebirth.

In the Japanese anime series, Hotaru has been voiced by Yūko Minaguchi. In the third season of &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, she is voiced by Yukiyo Fujii. In English, Hotaru is voiced by Jen Gould for the Cloverway Inc. adaptation, and by Christine Marie Cabanos in the Viz Media adaptations.

In the stage musicals, Hotaru has been played by twelve actresses: Keiko Takeda, Chihiro Imai, Asami Sanpei, Mao Mita, Mario Tomioka, Ayami Kakiuchi, Ruria Nakamura, Yui Iizuka, Eriko Funakoshi, Karin Takahashi, Mirai, and Yuuka Ide. 

==Reception and influence==
The official &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; popularity polls listed Hotaru Tomoe and Sailor Saturn as separate characters. In 1994, with fifty-one choices, Sailor Saturn was the third most popular character and Hotaru was the fourth. In early 1996, with fifty one choices, Saturn was the sixth most popular character, and Hotaru was the seventh.

It has been suggested that &quot;moe&quot; comes from a contraction of her last name, but this is considered a false etymology.

Tsubame Sanjou of &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; had her final design based on Hotaru.

<text>Antonio Negri (; ; 1 August 1933 – 16 December 2023) was an Italian political philosopher known as one of the most prominent theorists of autonomism, as well as for his co-authorship of &quot;Empire&quot; with Michael Hardt. Born in Padua, Italy, Negri became a professor of political philosophy at the University of Padua, where he taught state and constitutional theory. Negri founded the Potere Operaio (Worker Power) group in 1969 and was a leading member of Autonomia Operaia, and published highly influential books, including &quot;Empire&quot; and &quot;&quot;, urging &quot;revolutionary consciousness.&quot;

Negri was accused in the late 1970s of being the mastermind of the left-wing urban guerrilla organization Red Brigades (Brigate Rosse or BR), which was involved in the May 1978 kidnapping and murder of former Italian prime minister Aldo Moro. On 7 April 1979, Negri was arrested and charged with a number of crimes including the Moro murder. Most charges were quickly dropped, but in 1984, having fled to France, he was sentenced &quot;in absentia&quot; to 30 years in prison. He was given an additional four years on the charge of being &quot;morally responsible&quot; for the violence of political activists in the 1960s and 1970s. The question of Negri&#x27;s involvement with left-wing extremism is a controversial subject. He was indicted on a number of charges, including &quot;association and insurrection against the state&quot; (a charge which was later dropped), and sentenced for involvement in two murders.

Negri fled to France where, protected by the Mitterrand doctrine, he taught at the Paris VIII (Vincennes) and the Collège international de philosophie, along with Jacques Derrida, Michel Foucault, and Gilles Deleuze. In 1997, after a plea-bargain that reduced his prison time from 30 to 13 years, he returned to Italy to serve the end of his sentence. Many of his most influential books were published while he was behind bars. After his release he lived in Venice and Paris with his partner, the French philosopher Judith Revel. He was the father of film director Anna Negri.

== Early years ==
Antonio Negri was born in Padua, in the Northeastern Italian region of Veneto, in 1933. His father was an active communist militant from the city of Bologna (in the Northeastern Italian region of Emilia-Romagna), and although he died when Negri was two years old, his political engagement made Negri familiar with Marxism from an early age, while his mother was a teacher from the town of Poggio Rusco (in the province of Mantua, Lombardy). He began his career as a militant in the 1950s with the activist Roman Catholic youth organization Gioventú Italiana di Azione Cattolica (GIAC). Negri became a communist in 1953–54 when he worked at a kibbutz in Israel for a year. The kibbutz was organised according to ideas of Zionist socialism and all the members were Jewish communists. He joined the Italian Socialist Party in 1956 and remained a member until 1963, while at the same time becoming more and more engaged throughout the late 1950s and early 1960s in Marxist movements.

Negri studied philosophy and was hired as a professor at the University of Padua, soon after receiving his doctorate in 1956. There. he taught &quot;dottrina dello Stato&quot; (&quot;state doctrine&quot;), an Italian field similar to the philosophy of law, covering state and constitutional theory. In the early 1960s, Negri joined the editorial group of &quot;Quaderni Rossi&quot;, a journal that represented the intellectual rebirth of Marxism in Italy outside the realm of the Communist party. In 1969, together with Oreste Scalzone and Franco Piperno, Negri was one of the founders of the group Potere Operaio (Workers&#x27; Power) and the &quot;operaismo&quot; () movement.

== Arrest and flight ==
On 16 March 1978, Aldo Moro, the party leader of Christian Democracy and the former Italian prime minister, was kidnapped in Rome by the Red Brigades. Forty-five days after the kidnapping and nine days before Moro&#x27;s death, the Red Brigades called his family and informed Moro&#x27;s wife of his impending death. The conversation was recorded and later broadcast. While a number of people who knew Negri at the time identified him as the probable author of the call, the caller was later revealed to be Valerio Morucci.

On 7 April 1979 Negri and other activists were charged with kidnapping, assassination and insurrection. Padova&#x27;s Public Prosecutor Pietro Calogero accused them of being involved in the political wing of the Red Brigades, and thus behind left-wing terrorism in Italy. Negri was charged with a number of offences, including leadership of the Red Brigades, masterminding the 1978 kidnapping and murder of the President of the Christian Democratic Party Aldo Moro, and plotting to overthrow the government. At the time, Negri was a political science professor at the University of Padua and visiting lecturer at Paris&#x27; École Normale Supérieure. The Italian public was shocked that an academic could be involved in such events.

A year later a leader of the BR, having decided to cooperate with the prosecution, testified that Negri &quot;had nothing to do with the Red Brigades.&quot; The charge of &#x27;armed insurrection against the State&#x27; against Negri was dropped and he consequently did not receive the 30-year plus life sentence requested by the prosecutor, but did receive 30 years for being the instigator of political activist Carlo Saronio&#x27;s murder and having &#x27;morally concurred&#x27; with the murder of Andrea Lombardini, a &quot;carabiniere&quot;, during a failed bank robbery.

Some of his peers found little fault with Negri&#x27;s activities. Michel Foucault commented, &quot;Isn&#x27;t he in jail simply for being an intellectual?&quot; French philosophers Félix Guattari and Gilles Deleuze also signed in November 1977 &quot;L&#x27;Appel des intellectuels français contre la répression en Italie&quot; (The Call of French Intellectuals Against Repression in Italy) in protest against Negri&#x27;s imprisonment and Italian anti-terrorism legislation. On the other hand in the late 1980s Italian President Francesco Cossiga described Antonio Negri as &quot;a psychopath&quot; who &quot;poisoned the minds of an entire generation of Italy&#x27;s youth.&quot;

In 1983, four years after his arrest and while he was still in prison awaiting trial, Negri was elected to the Italian legislature as a member for the Radical Party. He was freed from prison claiming parliamentary immunity and was released, fleeing to France with the help of Félix Guattari and Amnesty International. His release was later revoked when the Chamber of Deputies voted to strip him of his immunity. Negri remained in exile in France for the next 14 years, where he was protected from extradition by the &quot;Mitterrand doctrine&quot;.

In France, Negri began teaching at the Paris VIII (Vincennes), and also at the Collège international de philosophie founded by Jacques Derrida. Although the conditions of his residence in France prevented him from engaging in political activities, he wrote prolifically and was active in a broad coalition of left-wing intellectuals. In 1997, he returned to Italy to serve out his sentence hoping to raise awareness of the status of hundreds of other political exiles from Italy. His sentence was commuted and he was released from prison in 2003, having written some of his most influential works while behind bars.

== Political thought and writing ==
Negri was one of the central theorists of autonomist Marxism, and was a prominent philosopher within libertarian socialism, communism, and Marxism. He also wrote various works on imperialism, radical democracy, and political praxis.

=== &quot;Labor of Dionysus: A Critique of the State-Form&quot; (1994)===
Written together with Michael Hardt, the authors ask themselves in this book, &quot;How is it, then, that labour, with all its life-affirming potential, has become the means of capitalist discipline, exploitation, and domination in modern society?&quot; The authors expose and pursue this paradox through a systematic analysis of the role of labour in the processes of capitalist production and in the establishment of capitalist legal and social institutions. Critiquing liberal and socialist notions of labor and institutional reform from a radical democratic perspective, Hardt and Negri challenge the state-form itself.

=== &quot;Insurgencies: Constituent Power and the Modern State&quot; (1999) ===
This book, written solely by Negri, &quot;explores the drama of modern revolutions-from Machiavelli&#x27;s Florence and Harrington&#x27;s England to the American, French, and Russian revolutions-and puts forward a new notion of how power and action must be understood if we are to achieve a radically democratic future.&quot;

=== &quot;Empire&quot; (2000) ===
In general, the book theorizes an ongoing transition from a &quot;modern&quot; phenomenon of imperialism, centered around individual nation-states, to an emergent postmodern construct created among ruling powers which the authors call &quot;Empire&quot;, with different forms of warfare:
According to Hardt and Negri&#x27;s &quot;Empire&quot;, the rise of Empire is the end of national conflict, the &quot;enemy&quot; now, whoever he is, can no longer be ideological or national. The enemy now must be understood as a kind of criminal, as someone who represents a threat not to a political system or a nation but to the law. This is the enemy as a terrorist ... In the &quot;new order that envelops the entire space of ... civilization&quot;, where conflict between nations has been made irrelevant, the &quot;enemy&quot; is simultaneously &quot;banalized&quot; (reduced to an object of routine police repression) and absolutized (like the Enemy, an absolute threat to the ethical order&quot;).

&quot;Empire&quot; elaborates a variety of ideas surrounding constitutions, global war, and class. Hence, the Empire is constituted by a monarchy (the United States and the G8, and international organizations such as NATO, the International Monetary Fund or the World Trade Organization), an oligarchy (the multinational corporations and other nation-states) and a democracy (the various non-government organizations and the United Nations). Part of the book&#x27;s analysis deals with &quot;imagin[ing] resistance&quot;, but &quot;the point of Empire is that it, too, is &quot;total&quot; and that resistance to it can only take the form of negation – &quot;the will to be against&quot;. The Empire is total, but economic inequality persists, and as all identities are wiped out and replaced with a universal one, the identity of the poor persists.

=== &quot;Multitude: War and Democracy in the Age of Empire&quot; (2004)===

&quot;Multitude&quot; addresses these issues and picks up the thread where &quot;Empire&quot; leaves off. In order to do so, Hardt and Negri argue, one must first analyze the present configuration of war and its contradictions. This analysis is performed in the first chapter, after which chapters two and three focus on multitude and democracy, respectively. &quot;Multitude&quot; is not so much a sequel as it is a reiteration from a new point of view in a new, relatively accessible style that is distinct from the predominantly academic prose style of &quot;Empire&quot;. Multitude remains, the authors insist, despite its ubiquitous subject matter and its almost casual tone, a book of philosophy which aims to shape a conceptual ground for a political process of democratization rather than present an answer to the question &#x27;what to do?&#x27; or offer a programme for concrete action.

=== &quot;Commonwealth&quot; (2009)===
In 2009 Negri completed the book &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, the final in a trilogy that began in 2000 with &quot;Empire&quot; and continued with &quot;Multitude&quot; in 2004, co-authored with Michael Hardt.
In this book, the authors introduce the concept of &quot;the republic of property&quot;: &quot;What is central for our purposes here is that the concept of property and the defence of property remain the foundation of every modern political constitution. This is the sense in which the republic, from the great bourgeois revolutions to today, is a republic of property&quot;. Part 2 of the book deals with the relationship between modernity and anti-modernity and proposes &quot;altermodernity&quot;. Altermodernity &quot;involves not only insertion in the long history of antimodern struggles but also rupture with any fixed dialectic between modern sovereignty and antimodern resistance. In the passage from antimodernity to altermodernity, just as tradition and identity are transformed, so too resistance takes on a new meaning, dedicated now to the constitution of alternatives. The freedom that forms the base of resistance, as we explained earlier, comes to the fore and constitutes an event to announce a new political project.&quot;

For Alex Callinicos in a review &quot;What is newest in &quot;Commonwealth&quot; is its take on the fashionable idea of the common. Hardt and Negri mean by this not merely the natural resources that capital seeks to appropriate, but also &quot;the languages we create, the social practices we establish, the modes of sociality that define our relationships&quot;, which are both the means and the result of biopolitical production. Communism, they argue, is defined by the common, just as capitalism is by the private and socialism (which they identify in effect with statism) with the public.&quot; For David Harvey Negri and Hardt &quot;in the search of an altermodernity – something that is outside the dialectical opposition between modernity and anti-modernity – they need a means of escape. The choice between capitalism and socialism, they suggest, is all wrong. We need to identify something entirely different, communism – working within a different set of dimensions.&quot; Harvey also notes that &quot;Revolutionary thought, Hardt and Negri argue, must find a way to contest capitalism and &#x27;the republic of property.&#x27; It &#x27;should not shun identity politics but instead must work through it and learn from it,&#x27; because it is the &#x27;primary vehicle for struggle within and against the republic of property since identity itself is based on property and sovereignty.&#x27;&quot; In the same exchange in Artforum between Harvey and Micheal Hardt and Antonio Negri, Hardt and Negri attempt to correct Harvey in a concept that is important within the argument of &quot;Commonwealth&quot;. As such, they state that &quot;We instead define the concept of singularity, contrasting it to the figure of the individual on the one hand and forms of identity on the other, by focusing on three aspects of its relationship to multiplicity: Singularity refers externally to a multiplicity of others; is internally divided or multiple; and constitutes a multiplicity over time – that is, a process of becoming.&quot;

After &quot;Commonwealth&quot;, he wrote multiple notable articles on the Arab Spring and Occupy movements along with other social issues.

=== Occupy movements of 2011–2012 and &quot;Declaration&quot; ===
In May 2012 Negri self-published (with Michael Hardt) an electronic pamphlet on the occupy and encampment movements of 2011–2012 called &quot;Declaration&quot; that argues the movement explores new forms of democracy. The introduction was published at &quot;Jacobin&quot; under the title &quot;Take Up the Baton&quot;. He also published an article with Hardt in &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot; in October 2011 stating &quot;The Encampment in Lower Manhattan Speaks to a Failure of Representation.&quot;

=== &quot;Assembly&quot; and essay collections (2013–2023) ===
In 2013, Negri published &quot;Spinoza: Politics and Postmodernity&quot;, a collections of essays on Spinoza and his contemporary relevance to philosophy and political theory, translated into English by William McCuaig.

In 2017, Negri and Michael Hardt published &quot;Assembly&quot;. The book provides a series of reflections on the nature of contemporary capitalism and social movements, drawing together the concepts and ideas explored previously in their &quot;Empire&quot; &#x27;trilogy&#x27; such as the common, the multitude, and globalisation. It also introduces a new political concept of &#x27;assembly&#x27;, which draws on Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari&#x27;s concept of an &#x27;assemblage&#x27; (French: &quot;agencements&quot;) as a way of thinking about mass movements and the role of constituent power. It also provides analyses of events that occurred in the years since &quot;Commonwealth&quot; was published in 2009, such as the rise of right-wing populism, Occupy Wall Street, the automation of work, and the digital economy. It continues their reflections on the character and goals of leaderless movements, and especially focuses on the ways in which these movements can seek to self-organise in radically democratic and egalitarian ways. They propose that instead of the usual model of leadership and movement in which leadership serves to articulate the long-term and &#x27;large scale&#x27; programme of the multitude, this relationship should instead be inverted: leadership instead comes to serve specific, tactical, and short-term ends (such as the organisation of specific moblisations, protests, direct action, strikes, etc.), while the multitude (or collective) serves to &quot;articulate the long-term goals and objectives&quot; to which the leadership must submit and facilitate.

The book received generally positive reviews. Writing for &quot;Critical Inquiry&quot;, Kyle Perry argues that the central claim of the book is that &quot;advocates for a truly democratic world must no longer refuse the demands of leading, strategizing, decision making, and institution building that can otherwise remain variously secondary, absent, or anathema amid left, liberatory, and progressive causes.&quot; It also rejects as a false binary the idea that liberal-democratic institutions should either be occupied or destroyed; instead, &quot;The better move is to get creative about inventing new, effective, and crucially &#x27;nonsovereign&#x27; institutions. Such institutions are not meant to &#x27;rule over us&#x27; but to &#x27;foster continuity and organization&quot; and to &quot;help organize our practices, manage our relationships, and together make decisions&#x27;.&quot; Writing for the &quot;Los Angeles Review of Books&quot;, Terence Renaud argues that &quot;Given how much the political terrain has changed since &quot;Empire&quot; appeared in 2000, much of Hardt and Negri&#x27;s project appears dead. It has said all that it&#x27;s going to say. Even so, the authors do an excellent job of highlighting the internal challenges that a resurgent left will face. Every new left risks degenerating into sectarian conflict, heavy-handed leadership, and complacency about its own righteousness. Hardt and Negri insist on a self-critical and internally democratic left that never ceases to call its own assumptions into question. In order to transform society, the left must first transform itself.&quot;

Between 2016 and 2019, Negri published a three-volume collection of essays written in various years, but translated, collected and published together in English in these volumes. The first volume was titled &quot;Marx and Foucault&quot;, and published on 16 December 2016. In this first volume, Negri aims to show &quot;how the thinking of Marx and Foucault were brought together to create an original theoretical synthesis – particularly in the context of Italy from May &#x27;68 onwards.&quot; The second volume was titled &quot;From the Factory to the Metropolis&quot;, and was published in February 2018. This second volume turns towards an analysis of the passage from the traditional proletarian &#x27;mass worker&#x27; of industrial capitalism (especially as found in Marx&#x27;s writing) to the contemporary &#x27;socialised worker&#x27;, as well as of the modern &#x27;metropolis&#x27;, which Negri describes as &quot;a space of antagonisms between forms of life produced, on the one hand, by finance capital (the capital that operates around rents), and on the other by the &#x27;cognitive proletariat&#x27;. The central question is then how &#x27;the common&#x27; of the latter can be mobilised for the destruction of capitalism.&quot; The third and final volume of this &#x27;trilogy&#x27; was titled &quot;Spinoza: Then and Now&quot;, which was published in February 2020. In this third volume, Negri &quot;examines how Spinoza&#x27;s thought constitutes a radical break with past ideas and an essential tool for envisaging a form of politics beyond capitalism.&quot;

On 29 October 2021, Negri published the first volume of a new trilogy of books. This first volume is titled &quot;Marx in Movement: Operaismo in Context&quot;, and seeks to provide an account and examination of the history of Italian Autonomist (or &#x27;Autonomist Marxist&#x27;) thought, particularly in terms of Negri&#x27;s theoretical development of the concept of the &#x27;social worker&#x27; as an attempt to update Marxism in light of the changes since the factory-based industrial labour of Marx&#x27;s time.
