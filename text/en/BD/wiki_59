<text>Bernard Sumner (born 4 January 1956) is an English musician. He is a founding member of the bands Joy Division, New Order, Electronic, and Bad Lieutenant. Sumner was an early force in several areas, including the post-punk, synth-pop, and techno music scenes, as well as their various related genres, and was an early influence on the Manchester music scene that presaged the Madchester movement of the late 1980s centred on Factory Records and The Haçienda club in Manchester. He and drummer Stephen Morris are the only two continuous members of New Order, as well as appeared on every band’s albums. 

He began his career playing guitar and keyboards for Joy Division. Following lead singer Ian Curtis&#x27;s death, the remaining members of Joy Division formed New Order with Sumner taking on lead vocal duties. His complex electronic compositions became less guitar-driven and more focused on electronic keyboards, synthesizers, and programming throughout the 1980s and 1990s. He formed Electronic with Johnny Marr in the late 1980s as a creative outlet outside of New Order, which continued after New Order went on hiatus in 1993. New Order became active again from 1998 through 2006, after which he returned to a more traditional rock context with the band Bad Lieutenant. He continues to record and perform with the latest iteration of New Order, which reformed in 2011.

==Early life==
Sumner was born on 4 January 1956 in Broughton, Salford, Lancashire, England. He has also used the surnames Dicken (similar to his stepfathers name Dickin) and Albrecht.

Sumner was educated at Salford Grammar School, before joining a company who did cartoon animations for television.

==Career==

===Joy Division===
Sumner was a founding member of Joy Division, formed at Salford in 1976. He and childhood friend Peter Hook both attended the fabled Sex Pistols concert at Manchester&#x27;s Free Trade Hall on 4 June 1976 and whose music inspired them to perform together. Widely considered one of the most influential bands of the era, Sumner was lead guitarist (his main guitars were a Gibson SG and a custom Shergold Masquerader), as well as playing electronic keyboards and made his first vocal appearance on record singing the chorus of &quot;Walked in Line&quot; on the &quot;Warsaw&quot; album. In May 1980, after the suicide of its lead singer, Ian Curtis, Joy Division disbanded.

===New Order===
Sumner and remaining band members Peter Hook and Stephen Morris started a new band named New Order, joined by keyboardist Gillian Gilbert in October 1980. Though Hook, Morris and Gilbert also contributed vocals on some early tracks, Sumner emerged as the band&#x27;s permanent singer and lyricist, alongside playing guitar and keyboards. Through a series of splits and reformations, the band has released ten studio albums. Sumner and Morris are the only members to be part of every lineup.

===Electronic===
In 1989, Sumner joined up with former Smiths guitarist Johnny Marr to form Electronic. The Pet Shop Boys&#x27; Neil Tennant collaborated on two tracks on their debut eponymous album, providing vocals. Sumner was their singer, guitarist, keyboardist and lyricist. Electronic released two other albums until a quiet disband in 2001 for Sumner to focus his efforts on New Order. Sumner occasionally appears to sing Electronic songs at Marr&#x27;s concerts.

===Bad Lieutenant===
Bad Lieutenant included fellow New Order member Phil Cunningham and Jake Evans of Rambo &amp; Leroy. Stephen Morris of New Order and Blur bassist Alex James also performed on the band&#x27;s debut album. Sumner provided vocals, guitar and lyrics. Bad Lieutenant disbanded after New Order reformed in 2011.

===Other projects===
In 1981, Pauline Murray and The Invisible Girls released their last single &quot;Searching for Heaven&quot;, which included a guitar solo by Sumner, although he was not credited in the sleeves of its 7&quot; and 10&quot; edition at the time. In 1983, Sumner co-produced, with Donald Johnson, the single &quot;The Great Divide&quot;/&quot;Love in a Strange Place&quot; by the band Foreign Press. Foreign Press (aka Emergency) had had a long history with Sumner through both Joy Division and New Order.

In 1990, he worked with former Factory Records label mates A Certain Ratio, remixing their song &quot;Won&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;. He has also recorded tracks with fellow Mancunians 808 State and Sub Sub. Sumner appeared as guest singer and guitarist (alongside Primal Scream&#x27;s Bobby Gillespie) on The Chemical Brothers&#x27; 1999 album &quot;Surrender&quot;, on the track &quot;Out of Control&quot;; and in a 2005 Chemical Brothers show at the Brixton Academy, Sumner appeared live onstage as a special guest on this track. He has also lent vocals and guitar to a track (&quot;Miracle Cure&quot;) on German trance outfit Blank &amp; Jones 2008 release, &quot;The Logic of Pleasure&quot;. Sumner also appeared on the Primal Scream track &quot;Shoot Speed Kill Light&quot; from their 2000 album &quot;XTRMNTR&quot;.

He has produced several remixes for tracks such as Technotronic&#x27;s &quot;Rockin&#x27; Over the Beat&quot; (which was featured in the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III&quot; soundtrack) and served as a record producer and/or songwriter for other Factory Records acts including Happy Mondays (whose second single, &quot;Freaky Dancin&#x27;,&quot; he produced in 1986), Shark Vegas, Abecedarians, 52nd Street and Section 25.

==Personal life==
Sumner married Sue Barlow on 28 October 1978; they had a son, James (born 1983), before divorcing in 1989. Sumner currently lives with his second wife, Sarah Dalton, and their three children, Dylan (born 1992), Tess (born 1994) and Finley (born 2003).

Sumner was portrayed by John Simm in the 2002 film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; and James Anthony Pearson in the 2007 film &quot;Control&quot;.

<text>The mandola (US and Canada) or tenor mandola (Ireland and UK) is a fretted, stringed musical instrument. It is to the mandolin what the viola is to the violin: the four double courses of strings tuned in fifths to the same pitches as the viola (C3-G3-D4-A4), a fifth lower than a mandolin. The mandola, though now rarer, is an ancestor of the mandolin. (The word &quot;mandolin&quot; means &quot;little mandola&quot;.)

The name &quot;mandola&quot; may originate with the ancient pandura, and is also rendered as mandora, the change perhaps having been due to approximation to the Italian word for &quot;almond&quot;. The instrument developed from the lute at an early date, being more compact and cheaper to build, but the sequence of development and nomenclature in different regions is now hard to discover. Historically related instruments include the mandore, mandole, vandola (Joan Carles Amat, 1596), bandola, bandora, bandurina, pandurina and – in 16th-century Germany – the quinterne or chiterna.
However, significantly different instruments have at times and places taken on the same or similar names, and the &quot;true&quot; mandola has been strung in several different ways.

The mandola has four double courses of metal strings, tuned in unison. The scale length is typically around 42 cm (16.5 inches). The mandola is typically played with a plectrum (pick). The double strings accommodate a sustaining technique called tremolando, a rapid alternation of the plectrum on a single course of strings.

The mandola is commonly used in folk music—particularly Italian folk music. It is sometimes played in Irish traditional music, but the instruments octave mandolin, Irish bouzouki and modern cittern are more commonly used. Some Irish traditional musicians, following the example of Andy Irvine, restring the tenor mandola with lighter, mandolin strings and tune it F-C-G-C (two semi-tones lower than G-D-A-D, since the mandola&#x27;s fretboard is two frets longer than the mandolin&#x27;s), while others (Brian McDonagh of Dervish being the best known) use alternate tunings such as D-A-E-A. Like the guitar, the mandola can be acoustic or electric. Attila the Stockbroker, punk poet and frontman of Barnstormer, uses an electric mandola as his main instrument, and Lief Sørbye of the band Tempest play an electric, double-neck mandola/mandolin. Alex Lifeson, guitarist of Rush, has also featured the mandola in his work.

Mandolas are sometimes played in mandolin orchestras, along with other members of the mandolin family: mandolin, mandocello and mandobass. Sometimes the octave mandolin (also referred to as an octave mandola) is included as well.

<text>Prison sexuality (or prison sex or penitentiary sex) consists of sexual relationships between prisoners or between a prisoner and a prison employee or other persons to whom prisoners have access. Since prisons are usually separated by sex, most sexual activity is with a same-sex partner. Exceptions to this include sex with spouses/partners during conjugal visits and sex with a prison employee of the opposite sex.

Prison sexuality is an issue that has been commonly misunderstood and misrepresented due not only to the taboo nature of the subject, but also because of a lack of research. Contrary to popular belief, the most common kind of sexual activity in prisons is consensual sex.

A 2011 study developed a taxonomy for different types of sexual behaviors in women&#x27;s prison. They include suppression, in which an inmate chooses celibacy (&quot;i.e.,&quot; refrains from sexual activity while in prison, most commonly to stay loyal to a partner who is outside of prison); autoeroticism (&quot;i.e.,&quot; masturbation); true homosexuality (consensual sex between inmates who were already homosexual before entering prison); situational homosexuality (consensual sex between inmates who have homosexual experiences for the first time in prison); and sexual violence (which can be between inmates or between a staff member and an inmate). Sexual violence includes coercion, manipulation, and compliance. Manipulation is performed for power or some kind of reward. Compliance occurs to obtain safety or protection or out of fear.

In general, prisoner-prisoner relationships are same-sex relationships because prisons are generally segregated by sex. An example of an exception to this general rule took place in Canada at the Sainte-Anne-des-Plaines prison. There, two convicted killers of the opposite sex, Karla Homolka and Jean-Paul Gerbet, were able to engage in sexual activity through a chain-link fence, which was the only barrier separating men and women. This prison is Canada&#x27;s highest security prison to which inmates of either sex may be sent if considered especially dangerous.

==Prisoner-prisoner relationships==
=== Female prisoners ===

The first research done on prison sexuality was on women in 1913. In 1931, researcher Selling found that different levels of relationships exist between women in prison (and female juvenile facilities), such as &quot;friendship, pseudofamily membership, pseudohomosexuality, and overt homosexuality&quot;. The forming of pseudofamilies have been more common in women prisons. These are families women create in prison that provide them support, bonds and relationships, like a traditional family would. Typically, only the main couple in the family has sexual relations. The women take on masculine and feminine roles to mimic a traditional heterosexual family. &quot;Mammy&quot; or &quot;mumsy&quot; is given to an older, maternal woman in the family, and &quot;Popsy&quot; is given to a dominant woman, who is least feminine. These &quot;parents&quot; are typically older and are seen as mentors to younger inmates. Roles within pseudofamilies are flexible and can change with time.

In 1965, Ward and Kassebaum conducted research in Frontera through questionnaires and concluded from staff and inmates that &quot;between 30% and 75% of the inmates had sexual affairs while in prison&quot;, 50% of those engaging in same-sex sexual activity. Sexual intercourse between these women were typically for fun and enjoyment, sometimes transitioning into a serious relationship. Furthermore, these relationships occurred between women who were housed together or between women of different races; same-race relations are not as typical. After a survey taken in a study conducted by Propper in 1976, his results for reasons for homosexual relationships include &quot;game playing, economic manipulation, loneliness, the need for companionship, and genuine affection&quot;.[4] Researcher Otis studied what was seen as &quot;unnatural relationships&quot; between interracial women. In 2014, consensual sexual relationships between women in UK prisons were described as &quot;commonplace&quot; by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

In homosexual relationships, sexual types for women include: &quot;butch&quot; or “daddy&quot; refers to the masculine woman who is dominant. The &quot;femme&quot; or &quot;mommy&quot; is the submissive one. A &quot;trick&quot; is a girl who allows herself to be used by others. A &quot;commissary hustler&quot; is manipulative. &quot;Cherries&quot; have never had lesbian experiences and a &quot;square&quot; will not take part in homosexual acts.

=== Male prisoners ===
Prison sexuality for men has been studied since the 1930s. Research is lacking on consensual sex, as most research done has focused on coercion. Sexual abuse is more common among male inmates. Men sexually abuse others to establish dominance, power and to maintain their masculinity. In protective pairing, men who are physically weaker will offer consensual sex in exchange for protection, security, goods or support.

Heterosexual men in prison view their homosexual acts as being situational and may not consider themselves bisexual. These men often describe how they imagine being with a woman while taking part in sexual activity with a male inmate. During masturbation, they picture past sexual experiences with women. They take part in homosexual activity due to having no “heterosexual outlets”.

A dominant sexual partner in prison is called &quot;daddy&quot; while their submissive partner is called &quot;kid&quot; or “girl”. The dominant partner has their mate take on the feminine role in order to feel more masculine and powerful.

Jonathan Schwartz&#x27;s research in the documentary &quot;Turned Out: Sexual Assault Behind Bars&quot; found that &quot;in male prison populations where entitlement to (anal and oral) penetration (or perhaps possessing a &#x27;wife&#x27;) is the ultimate symbol of domination – [it is] part of the symbolic economy of an all-male, hyper-masculinist environment.&quot;

=== Mixed-sex prisons ===
While most prisons exclusively house inmates of either gender, there are some facilities that house both men and women. Within such institutions there are cases where inmates engage in heterosexual sex with prisoners of the opposite gender. Additionally, there have even been instances in which married couples are held in the same location. However such sexual encounters are not very common and can be difficult for the inmates to arrange with each other as a result of the men and women being separated from each other and the fact that the prisoners are closely monitored by the prison officers.

This specific kind of interaction between inmates is gaining more attention, due to the benefits it seems to provide for inmates. For instance, inmates in these relationships experience a lower level of romantic loneliness, a higher level of sexual satisfaction, as well as increased quality of life compared to inmates with a spouse/romantic partner outside of the jail or inmates with no partner whatsoever. This suggests that inmates in the same prison will benefit from developing relationships with other inmates. In the rare instances where inmates are permitted contact with incarcerated members of the opposite sex, intimate relationships are shown to be beneficial for the inmates&#x27; interpersonal and psychological state.

== Prisoners and other relationships ==
Around the world many prisons offer conjugal visits to the partners of inmates, in which prisoners are permitted to spend time in private rooms, with their partners in a prison-facilitated environment like private apartment-style rooms within the prison itself or the inmates are taken to meet their spouses in secure locations such as trailers or cabins. During conjugal visits the inmate and their partners may even be provided with supplies such as soap, towels, bed linens, condoms, lubricant, and even G-rated (in the United States) DVDs. Conjugal visits are restricted to only inmates with good behavior, and in some jurisdictions this is only permitted for married couples, while others allow domestic partners.

Inmates might also engage in heterosexual relationships during work release programs, in which a prisoner is sufficiently monitored by a supervisor or trusted enough to temporarily leave the prison to work at a place of employment before returning to the prison. During the working shift, inmates have taken advantage of the temporary freedom to engage in sex with either their work release supervisor, a co-worker from their place of employment, or anyone else they can manage to contact. However such relations are not allowed and thus any inmate caught engaging in such activity may face punishments such as being excluded from the work release programs.

In prisons with high enough levels of corruption, inmates with considerable amounts of wealth and influence, such as crime bosses and/or drug lords, have been known to use their money to bribe the prison staff, so as to allow outsiders, such as prostitutes or even intimate partners, to enter into the prisons for sexual activity with the inmates. However prison staff that engage in such misconduct risk being temporarily suspended or fired if their corruption is exposed, along with possible prosecution.

Relations also occur between correctional staff and inmates. Due to the power dynamic of staff over the inmates, tight quarters and restriction of sexual relations, prisoners are in a vulnerable position toward staff members. Personnel of the staff include: security staff, teachers, case managers, counselors, medical workers, work release supervisors, contractors and religious workers; additionally there have also been cases of inmates having relations with lawyers visiting clients in the prison. At times there are even cases of women becoming pregnant as a result of sexual relations between inmates and staff. Although not allowed, many times this would be the only opportunity for inmates to engage in heterosexual relations. In some jurisdictions, sexual relations by prison staff with inmates are illegal regardless of consent.

Additionally prison inmates with contraband such as mobile web have been known to use their smartphones and/or tablet computers to either watch pornography or to engage in sexting, phone sex or cybersex with people outside of the prisons.

A government report in the UK in 2014 found that female prisoners in England and Wales have been coerced into sex with staff in exchange for alcohol and cigarettes. Some sexbot manufacturers have argued that introducing sexbots into prisons will have the positive effect of reducing prison rapes and reducing sexual tension.

== Prison rape ==

Prison is a community sexologically characterized by overt masturbation and by homosexual couplings that may be consensual, coercive or assaultive (rape). Prison rape is defined differently from state to state but is understood to be non-consensual or unwanted sexual contact between individuals. Prison rape can be between inmates or inmates and staff of the prison. This is a form of sexuality because these individuals use their capacity for sexual feelings to intimidate or control their victims which causes sociological properties of the prison to change.

According to research done in 1980, prisoners have two overarching reasons to rape a victim. One is to satisfy their overt sexual- and need-based desires that self-pleasure cannot. The second is to use the assault as a sort of intimidation factor to grant the rapist power in a place where these actions generally go unpunished. In prison, the term &quot;booty bandit&quot; is used to describe an inmate who would rape another (in the case of men). There seems to be no correlation shown that men who are abusive to their partners outside of prison are more likely to be rapists in prisons. Such men are not known to have a history of sexual assault before prison.

According to the 2001 Human Rights Watch report &quot;No Escape: Male Rape in U.S. Prisons&quot;, sexual slavery is frequently posed as a consensual sexual relationship inside prisons. Rape victims are often intimidated into feigning consent to sexual activity, to the point of becoming &quot;slaves&quot; and the figurative property of their rapists.

Prospective slaveholders will sometimes use intimidating innuendo, as opposed to overt threats of violence, which the prospective slave unwillingly accepts, thereby disguising the coercive nature of the sexual activity from even the enslaver. Victims might not even see themselves as being coerced if the abuse is negotiated as repayment for a debt. The trauma of the sexual violations often affects men as it threatens their sense of masculinity, gender identity and sexual orientation. The HRW report contains an account in which an inmate is feeling this way. It concludes that in prison, consent is inherently illusory.

In 2003, for the first time ever, the United States government moved to protect prisoners from sexual violence. With pressure from human rights groups, the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate unanimously passed the Prison Rape Elimination Act (PREA) to protect prisoners from sexual violence.

=== In news media ===
The printed news media in the historical era emphasized the issue of prison rape by establishing a social problem and blaming the U.S. correction system. According to major newspapers, the U.S. correction system not only involved the correctional personnel but the inmates who engaged in homosexual behavior. Later in the contemporary era, print news media shifted the United States&#x27; focus on prison rape from a framed-problem perspective to a political rights and civil rights issue within the U.S. correction system.

The issue of prison rape gained national attention in the press, thus creating an open door for new perspectives on how to understand and eliminate the issue. News media contributed to the U.S. government&#x27;s initiative to intervene in the matter.

== Discrimination in prison sexuality ==
=== Gender discrimination ===
Studies conducted by Cindy Struckman-Johnson conclude that 22 percent of male inmates have either been coerced or persuaded into sexual acts in prison. Sexual assault in prison is not exclusive to male prisons. Female prisoners experience sexual assault in a different way. By 1998, there were over 138,000 women in the prison system. While this is the case, the majority of prison guards are male. There is evidence that women prisoners are coerced into sex by prison staff in exchange for &quot;drugs, favors, and promises of more lenient treatment.&quot; Female inmates also report that guards and staff watch them shower and undress, as well improperly touch them during pat-downs.

=== LGBTQ+ discrimination ===
Members of the LGBTQ+ community are incarcerated at higher rates than heterosexual people in the United States. There is a significant demographic of LGBTQ+ individuals within the criminal justice system. The Bureau of Justice Statistics, a branch of the Department of Justice, reports that gay and lesbian men and women are ten times more likely to be sexually assaulted in prison by another inmate. Additionally, they are 2.6 times more likely than heterosexual inmates to be sexually assaulted by prison staff.

==== Transgender and intersex Inmates ====
Transgender inmates in particular face tougher discrimination than any other prison demographic. Not only do they object to the standard requirement that they be imprisoned with other members of their biological sex, but the lack of facilities for transgender inmates is discriminatory in nature. The concept of differentiating the sexes in prisons is called sex segregation. The separate men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s prisons bring forward issues for transgender and intersex people who are incarcerated.

While it is known that discrimination exists against transgender and intersex prisoners, there is little data on the issue thus far. This is due to the fact that jails and prisons are segregated by binary sex. There are studies that demonstrate that compared to the United Kingdom, transgender inmates in the United States are much less likely to be housed with other members of the gender they identify with.

The treatment of transgender inmates also varies across different jurisdictions in the United States. The most inclusive states allow for inmates to be segregated based on their gender identity on their Department of Motor Vehicle identification card. Others states such as Tennessee have restrictive laws against gender identification in prisons. The state of Tennessee only allows inmates to be housed based on their biological sex on their birth certificate, which in this state cannot be changed.

The lack of autonomy for transgender people in prison to decide where they should be housed is discriminatory and dangerous in nature. It leads to more sexual assaults from other prisoners and prison personnel. A study conducted in California concluded that transgender people in prison are 13 times more likely to be a victim of sexual assault.

== Inmate contraceptive access ==
Even though the state law prohibits all sex acts, sex still takes place in prison whether widely consensual or violently coerced. Health advocates believe that condoms should be available for everyone to prevent the spread of HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections and since sex is going to happen in the prisons, it should be safe. Organizations like the World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Program On HIV/AIDS believe that condoms should be available to prisoners and have been insistent on it for more than a decade. Despite their attempts to provide condoms some places still do not provide them. Conversations in the United States can be filled with judgments as to what prisoners do not deserve, and condoms are a part of this. While the conversations take place the infection rates of HIV and other STIs continue to rise, severely affecting both the inmates and the community.

As of September 2013, condoms are available inside prisons in Canada, most of the European Union, Australia, Brazil, Indonesia, South Africa, and the US state of Vermont. In September 2014, a law was passed in California when Governor Jerry Brown signed the Assembly Bill 966 also known as the Prisoner Protections for Family and Community Health Act to require the state to hand out condoms and make them available to inmates in 34 of its prison facilities. This bill protects the prisoner&#x27;s health as well while being cost effective. For the state, condom distribution is a low cost method to prevent the transmission of HIV and sexually transmitted infections since individual HIV treatments are costly.

As of 12 September 2016, a California bill passed stating that birth control and hygiene products are allowed for women inmates to use if they are prescribed by their physician. All forms of birth control approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) will be made available to all inmates capable of becoming pregnant.

=== Debate over condoms in the U.S. ===
Multiple factors contribute to the debate over providing condoms to prisoners, one is that of political standings. In the U.S. in particular, prison officials believe that providing condoms amounts to condoning sex, which in some places is illegal. In 1999 some penal systems participated in condom distribution including San Francisco, Washington D.C, and New York City. Without condoms, some prisoners are forced to improvise, such as using foam to prevent transmission of HIV.

== HIV testing ==
The amount of STIs in prisons is eight-ten times higher than the general population among both men and women.

Many of these incarcerated individuals with drug-related crime have participated in unsafe injection or have sexual risk for HIV and other sexually transmitted or infectious diseases. Even though correctional administrators deny it, sexual activity and drug use take place in prisons. HIV/AIDS and sexually transmitted infections are transmitted by unprotected sex and sharing contaminated drug injection equipment in these correctional facilities. Many prisoners are infected while incarcerated which can affect their personal health, spread infectious diseases to other inmates, and eventually their sexual partner in the community. Because the rate of STIs is much higher in prison, some prisons provide voluntary HIV testing and counseling to educate and reduce HIV risk behavior. Some prisoners refuse to voluntarily get tested for HIV because they fear their results will not remain confidential among the staff and that they will be discriminated against.

Health is a priority for many prisons, especially when prisoners return to their communities once their sentence is complete.

== Social constructionist approach ==
Some explanations for prison sexuality include the social constructionist theory by Groth. He implies that sexuality is not only an &quot;inherent part&quot; of a person but also that it may be a &quot;construct of that person&#x27;s society&quot;. Additionally, he mentions that you cannot classify the prisoner&#x27;s sexuality as heterosexual or homosexual during their prison time because it could not be accurate; their sexuality is on hold meanwhile because they act rather on personal needs than interpersonal needs. This, however does not fully conclude that this is the sole reason for prison relationships because they also feel the genuine connection that can turn into a serious relationship.

A similar perspective was penned by Donald Clemmer, who in 1940 theorized that inmates engaged in homosexual behavior partly as they &quot;were deprived of a heteronormative sexual identity&quot;. As sexuality has been historically separated into heterosexual or homosexual categories, this deprivation model of an inmate satisfying their needs at the cost of changing from heterosexual to homosexual fits with the social constructionist theory.

In 1958, Gresham Sykes created the deprivation model. In this model, heterosexual inmates struggle with deprivation and create a prison subculture. Inmates are deprived of their sexual needs and desire some activity, resort to masturbation, consensual or coerced sex.

John Irwin and Donald Cressey created the importation model in 1962. With this model, inmates create a unique prison culture based on values from the outside. The social constructionist model is made up of social situations and values.

<text>Huntly () (population ) is a town in the Waikato district and region of the North Island of New Zealand. It was on State Highway 1 (until Huntly bypass opened in March 2020), south of Auckland and north of Hamilton. It is situated on the North Island Main Trunk (NIMT) railway (served by Te Huia since 6 April 2021 at a rebuilt Raahui Pookeka-Huntly Station) and straddles the Waikato River. Huntly is within the Waikato District which is in the northern part of the Waikato region local government area.

==History and culture==

Originally settled by Māori, European migrants arrived in the area some time in the 1850s. The Huntly name was adopted in the 1870s when the postmaster named it after Huntly, Aberdeenshire, in Scotland. He used an old &#x27;Huntley Lodge&#x27; stamp to stamp mail from the early European settlement. The word &quot;Lodge&quot; was later dropped and the spelling changed to also drop the additional &#x27;e&#x27;.

The railway from Auckland reached Huntly in 1877, when the Huntly railway station was opened.

Huntly and its surrounding area is steeped in Māori history and falls within the &quot;rohe&quot; (tribal area) of Waikato-Tainui of the Tainui waka confederation. Ngāti Mahuta and Ngāti Whawhakia are the subtribes in the Huntly area. Waahi Pa in Huntly was the home of the Māori queen Dame Te Atairangikaahu and of her son the Māori king Tūheitia.

Rakaumanga Native School was established in 1896. It was moved to its present site in 1974 to make way for the building of Huntly Power Station. It became one of the first bilingual schools (Māori/English) in New Zealand in 1984. It became a kura kaupapa (total immersion, Māori as its first language) in 1994 and is now known by the name Te Whare Kura o Rakaumangamanga.

===Marae===

There are a number of marae in and around Huntly, affiliated with the Ngāti Kuiaarangi, Ngāti Mahuta, Ngāti Tai and Ngāti Whāwhākia hapū: Kaitumutumu Marae and Ruateatea meeting house, Te Kauri Marae and Karaka meeting house, Te Ōhākī Marae and Te Ōhākī a Te Puea meeting house, and Waahi Pa and Tāne i te Pupuke meeting house.

In October 2020, the Government committed $2,584,751 from the Provincial Growth Fund to upgrade Waahoi Marae and 7 other Waikato Tainui marae, creating 40 jobs.

Horahora Marae and Maurea Marae are located north of Huntly at Rangiriri.

==Major industries==

Huntly Power Station is a large gas/coal-fired power station, prominently situated on the western bank of the Waikato River. It is New Zealand&#x27;s largest thermal power station, situated in the area which is New Zealand&#x27;s largest producer of coal, producing over 10,000 tonnes a day.

Huntly is also surrounded by farmland and lakes (many of them former open-pit mines) which are used for coarse fishing, yachting and waterskiing.

=== Coal ===
The Waikato coalfield is formed of 30 -35m year old Eocene-Oligocene rocks. The lowest coal measures are the Taupiri Seams, worked at Rotowaro, the upper Kupakupa and Renown Seams having been largely worked out.

The area has a very long history of coal mining, with both open cast and classical mines operating or having operated here. The major New Zealand clients for the mined coal are the power station and the New Zealand Steel mill at Glenbrook.

The first coal to be mined was half a ton at Taupiri in 1849, followed by 32 tons in 1850, opposite Kupa Kupa, about south of Huntly, and coal was also discovered at Papahorohoro, near Taupiri. However, it wasn&#x27;t being exploited when the geologist, Ferdinand von Hochstetter, visited it in 1859. It was used to fuel steamers during the 1863 invasion of the Waikato. Kupakupa mine was started in 1864 and produced 11,000 tons by 1866. The area was confiscated in 1865. It was auctioned by government in 1867.

Taupiri Coal Co was producing 1,300 tons a month by 1879, up from 5,300 tons a year in 1878. A mine across the river from Kupakupa was opened in 1879.

On 12 September 1914 at the Ralph Mine in Huntly, a naked light caused an explosion that killed 43 coal miners.

After the Pukemiro railway opened in 1915, mines opened at Pukemiro, Glen Afton, Rotowaro, Waikōkōwai and Renown. Open cast mining began west of Huntly during World War 2, and later an opencast mine at Kimihia.

==== O’Reilly’s Opencast Mine ====
This was the last mine operating in Huntly (off Riverview Rd), producing 24,708 tonnes in 2016. It was a privately owned mine, opened in 1957 and mainly selling to New Zealand Steel. It closed in 2018. Puke Mine and Rotowaro are the only mines still open in the Huntly area.

==== Huntly East Coalmine ====
Solid Energy closed this Huntly mine on 22 October 2015, saying it was losing $500,000 a month. It opened in 1978, produced a peak of 465,000 tonnes in 2004 and was digging about 450,000 tonnes a year until production was cut to 100,000 tonnes in September 2013. The mine entrance was in Huntly East, but by 2012 all mining was west of the Waikato, with roadways 150 metres below the river, the two 8 to 20 metre thick sub-bituminous seams being 150 to 400 metres deep. In 2012 it was estimated that 7 million tonnes of recoverable coal remained in the consented mining areas, with a further 12 million available for future expansion. Coal was mined by remote-controlled continuous miners and taken to the entrance in shuttle cars and then by conveyor belt. It continued to Glenbrook via the Kimihia branch railway and the NIMT. It employed about 200 in 2012, but was down to 68 at closure.

Kimihia Wetland was created on the former bed of Lake Kimihia to cope with subsidence and treat water from Huntly East Mine.

=== Bricks ===
Clay suited for bricks lies on top of some of the coal deposits. Brick making began in 1884, Huntly Brick and Fireclay was established in 1911 and Shinagawa Refractories continues on the site at the south end of the town. Nearby, Clay Bricks operate a brickworks.

==Rugby league==
Huntly has a proud rugby league history – at one time the town had four rugby league clubs: Taniwharau, Huntly South, Huntly United and Rangiriri Eels. Taniwharau has been one of the most successful clubs having won 11 straight Waikato premierships during the 1970s and 1980s. Taniwharau also won the inaugural Waicoa Bay championship in 2002 and again in 2007 a year in which they went through the season unbeaten; a feat that has never been achieved before at the Waikato premier level. The Waicoa Bay championship is a combined rugby league competition involving clubs from Waikato, Bay of Plenty and Coastlines.

A number of New Zealand players have come out of Huntly including pre war players Tom Timms, Richard Trautvetter and Len Mason who also, after the 1926 Kiwi tour of Great Britain finished his playing career at Wigan, playing a record 365 games in 9 years including a winning Challenge Cup final at Wembley in 1929. Post war players include Albert Hambleton, Reg Cooke, Graeme Farrar, Roger Tait, Ted Baker, Paul Ravlich, Tawera Nikau (Rangiriri) and, more recently, Wairangi Koopu (Taniwharau) and Lance Hohaia (Taniwharau). Other Kiwi players to come out of Huntly include Andy Berryman, Don Parkinson, Rick Muru, Kevin Fisher and Vaun O&#x27;Callaghan. The town has also produced numerous NZ Māori Rugby league representatives and two international referees; Arthur Harlock and Roland (Roly) Avery.

== Bridges ==

Rail Bridge After a first pile driving ceremony in 1911, the punt (opened 18 September 1894) was replaced in 1915 by a road/rail bridge serving the Pukemiro railway.

Tainui Bridge is a 7-span bowstring-arch for road traffic opened in 1959, when the 1915 bridge became rail only, and a footbridge was attached to its side. Tainui Bridge was strengthened in 2005 to allow 500 tonne turbines to be carried to the Power Station, work which gained an award. Seismic strengthening was done in 2011. The bridge was repainted in 2016.

A footbridge across Shand Lane, the 1978 SH1 bypass and NIMT links Glasgow St with Main St. The 14-tonne central span was raised from 4.8 to 5.25m in 2010 to provide clearance for Te Uku construction trucks. It was also closed twice in 2015, firstly for repainting, then again when the arm of an excavator on a truck hit the bridge, requiring also temporary closure of SH1. Cameras and extra rails have been installed to improve safety, following stone throwing.

<text>The Gruber–De Gasperi Agreement was a bilateral treaty that was signed by the foreign minister of Austria, Karl Gruber, and the prime minister of Italy, Alcide De Gasperi, on 5 September 1946. Recognized by international law, it granted the German-speaking population of the Province of South Tyrol the right to autonomy and to preserve its cultural identity and customs. It also recognized German and Italian as official languages. 

People were granted the right to return to their original German given and family names, which had been abandoned by many during the Fascists&#x27; programme of forced assimilation.

==Content==
# German-speaking inhabitants of the Bolzano Province and of the neighbouring bilingual townships of the Trento Province will be assured complete equality of rights with the Italian-speaking inhabitants, within the framework of special provisions to safeguard the ethnical character and the cultural and economic development of the German-speaking element.In accordance with legislation already enacted or awaiting enactment the said German-speaking citizens will be granted in particular:
## 
## 
# The populations of the above-mentioned zones will be granted the exercise of autonomous legislative and executive regional power. The frame within which the said provisions of autonomy will apply, will be drafted in consultation also with local representative German-speaking elements.
# The Italian Government, with the aim of establishing good neighbourhood relations between Austria and Italy, pledges itself, in consultation with the Austrian Government and within one year from the signing of the present Treaty:

<doc id="264194" wikidata="Q912741" url="?curid=264194" title="Colposcopy">
<text>Colposcopy ( + &quot;skopos&quot; &#x27;look at&#x27;) is a medical diagnostic procedure to visually examine the cervix as well as the vagina and vulva using a colposcope.

The main goal of colposcopy is to prevent cervical cancer by detecting and treating precancerous lesions early. Human Papillomavirus (HPV) is a common infection and the underlying cause for most cervical cancers. Smoking also makes developing cervical abnormalities more likely.

Other reasons for a patient to have a colposcopy include assessment of diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in utero, immunosuppression, abnormal appearance of the cervix or as a part of a sexual assault forensic examination.

Colposcopy is done using a colposcope, which provides a magnified and illuminated view of the areas, allowing the colposcopist to visually distinguish normal from abnormal appearing tissue, such as damaged or abnormal changes in the tissue (lesions), and take directed biopsies for further pathological examination if needed.

Colposcopy has historical roots in the 10th century when Abulcasis, a renowned Arabian physician, pioneered the use of reflected light to inspect internal organs, with the cervix being the first organ examined in this way. The modern procedure was developed by the German physician Hans Hinselmann, with help from Eduard Wirths. The development of colposcopy involved experimentation on Jewish inmates from Auschwitz.

== Indications ==

Most women undergo a colposcopy to further investigate an abnormal pap test result (cytological).

Other reasons for a patient to have a colposcopy include:
* assessment of diethylstilbestrol (DES) exposure in utero,
* immunosuppression such as HIV infection, or an organ transplant patient
* an abnormal appearance of the cervix as noted by a primary care provider
* as a part of a sexual assault forensic examination using a specialized colposcope equipped with a camera

Many physicians base their current evaluation and treatment decisions on the report &quot;Evidence-Based Consensus Recommendations for Colposcopy Practice for Cervical Cancer Prevention in the United States&quot;, developed by the American Society for Colposcopy and Cervical Pathology, most recently in 2017.

Colposcopy is not generally performed for people with pap test results showing low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) or less. SILs are an abnormal growth of epithelial cells, known as a lesion, on the surface of the cervix. Unless the person has a visible lesion, colposcopy for this population does not detect a recurrence of cancer.

== Procedure ==

During the initial evaluation, a medical history is obtained. The procedure is fully described to the patient. In some cases a pregnancy test may be performed before the procedure and the patient then signs a consent form. Colposcopy is performed with the woman lying back, legs in stirrups, and buttocks at the lower edge of the table (a position known as the dorsal lithotomy position). A speculum is placed in the vagina after the vulva is examined for any suspicious lesions.

A colposcope is used to identify visible clues suggestive of abnormal tissue. It functions as a lighted binocular or monocular microscope to magnify the view of the cervix, vagina, and vulvar surface. 

Low magnification (2× to 6×) may be used to obtain a general impression of the surface architecture. 8× to 25× magnification are utilized to evaluate the vagina and cervix. High magnification together with green filter is often used to identify certain vascular patterns that may indicate the presence of more advanced pre-cancerous or cancerous lesions.

The squamocolumnar junction, or &quot;transformation zone&quot;, is a critical area on the cervix where many precancerous and cancerous lesions most often arise. The ability to see the transformation zone and the entire extent of any lesion visualized determines whether an adequate colposcopic examination is attainable.

Acetic acid solution is applied to the surface of the cervix using cotton swabs to improve visualization of abnormal areas.. Areas of the cervix that turn white (acetowhiteness) after the application of acetic acid or have an abnormal vascular pattern are often considered for biopsy. If no lesions are visible, an iodine solution may be applied to the cervix to help highlight areas of abnormality.

After a complete examination, the colposcopist determines the areas with the highest degree of visible abnormality and may obtain biopsies from these areas using a long biopsy instrument, such as a punch forceps, SpiraBrush CX or SoftBiopsy. Most doctors and patients consider anesthesia unnecessary; however, some colposcopists now recommend and use a topical anesthetic such as lidocaine or a cervical block to decrease patient discomfort, particularly if many biopsy samples are taken.

Following any biopsies, an endocervical curettage (ECC) is often done. The ECC utilizes a long straight curette, a Soft-ECC curette employing fabric to simultaneously collect tissue, or a cytobrush (like a small pipe-cleaner) to scrape the inside of the cervical canal. The ECC should never be done on a patient who is pregnant. Monsel&#x27;s solution is applied with large cotton to the surface of the cervix to control bleeding. This solution looks like mustard and turns black when exposed to blood. After the procedure this material will be expelled naturally: Patients can expect to have a thin coffee-ground like discharge for up to several days after the procedure. Alternatively, some physicians achieve hemostasis with silver nitrate.

==Interpretation==
One model for scoring colposcopy findings is the &quot;Swede Score&quot;, which assigns a score between 0 and 2 for five different parameters, based on what is visible during the colposcopy, as given in table below:

The total Swede Score ranges between 0 and 10. A score of 5 or above is reported to identify all potential high-grade lesions (HGL) and 8 or above to have a 90% chance of being a HGL. A score below 5 does not require biopsy because of low risk of cancer, a score from 5 to 7 requires biopsy, and a score 8 or above does not require biopsy because it is likely more efficient to intervene directly (e.g., by excision).

== Complications ==
Significant complications from a colposcopy are not common but may include bleeding, infection at the biopsy site or endometrium, and failure to identify the lesion. Monsel&#x27;s solution and silver nitrate interfere with the interpretation of biopsy specimens, so these substances are not applied until all biopsies have been taken. Some patients experience a degree of discomfort during the curettage, and many experience discomfort during the biopsy.

Colposcopy with biopsy does not cause infertility or subfertility.

== Follow up ==

Adequate follow-up is critical to the success of this procedure. Treatments for significant lesions include ablative treatments (cryotherapy, thermocoagulation, and laser ablation) and excisional methods (loop electrosurgical excision procedure or LEEP, or Cervical conization).

<text>Club Atlético Peñarol (), more commonly referred to as Peñarol, is a Uruguayan professional football club based in Montevideo. The club currently competes in the Uruguayan Primera División, the highest tier in Uruguayan football.

The name derives from the neighbourhood on the outskirts of Montevideo. Its origin dates back to the 28th of September 1891, when the club was initially established as the [[Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club]] (also known by its acronym CURCC), founded by mostly British railway workers for the practise of cricket. The club was renamed as Peñarol on 13 December 1913; the continuity between the football section of the CURCC and Peñarol has sparked significant controversy in Uruguayan football, as some football pundits have argued that while Peñarol inherited its tradition from the CURCC and there is a sociological continuity between the two, legally they are two separate institutions, as the CURCC would&#x27;ve continued to exist until it&#x27;s dissolution in 22 January 1915, though merely was by then a recreational branch for the employees of the railway company. However, the Uruguayan Football Association has recognized Peñarol as the continuity of CURCC since 1914.

By the 1910s, Peñarol began to establish themselves as a promising club in national and international football. The introduction of the FIFA World Cup in 1930 helped elevate the presence of Uruguayan football, including Peñarol; several members of the team were products of the club. The start of the 1940s ushered in a golden generation for Peñarol, as the following four decades the club would have won several international tournaments led by generational talents including Diego Aguirre, Néstor Gonçalves, Fernando Morena, Juan Alberto Schiaffino, and Alberto Spencer. By the 1990s, Peñarol experienced a decline in form, with fewer domestic and international titles compared to the previous decades. However, the club has seen a resurgence in international competition since the 2010s.

Although the original colors of the CURCC were black and orange, Peñarol has consistently identified with yellow and black throughout its history, inspired by the Stephenson&#x27;s Rocket and the railway workers&#x27; union. The club throughout its history has also participated in other sports, such as athletics, basketball, cycling, futsal, rugby union, and women&#x27;s football. Its main focus, however, has always been on men&#x27;s football, a sport in which the club excels, having never been relegated from the top division. The club currently host their matches at the 40,000-capacity Estadio Campeón del Siglo since 2016, having previously played at Estadio Centenario since 1933. Peñarol currently have 80,000 associates.

Peñarol is considered one of the most prestigious football clubs in the sport; in September 2009, the club was recognized as the best South American club of the 20th century by the IFFHS. In international competition, Peñarol is the third-highest Copa Libertadores winner, having won it on five editions (1960, 1961, 1966, 1982, and 1987), and shares the record for Intercontinental Cup victories with three (1961, 1966, and 1982). In domestic football, Peñarol has won 42 tournaments in its era, and considering the titles won by their predecessor, it has claimed 51 championships overall. The club has many long-standing rivalries, most notably &quot;El Clásico Uruguayo&quot; with Club Nacional de Football. The derby is considered one of the oldest in international football, with their first meeting on 15 July 1900 with a 2-0 victory. Since then, they have faced each other in more than 500 occasions. As of 2024, Peñarol currently holds the advantage in the head-to-head record.

==History==
===Origins===

On 28 September 1891, employees of the Central Uruguay Railway Company established the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club (CURCC) of Montevideo, with the purpose of stimulating the practice of cricket, rugby football and &quot;other male sports&quot; (literal from the Spanish).

The Central Uruguay Railway company had operated in Uruguay since 1878, with 118 employees, 72 British, 45 Uruguayan and one German. The club was known as CURCC in the neighborhood of Peñarol—the latter from the Peñarol neighborhood, about from Montevideo, whose name in turn derived from an Italian city. The club&#x27;s first president was Frank Henderson, who remained in that position until 1899.

In 1892, the CURCC shifted its focus from cricket and rugby to association football. The football club&#x27;s first game was against a team of students from the English high school and ended with a 2–0 victory. In 1895, Uruguayan footballer Julio Negrón was chosen as the team&#x27;s first non-British captain.

===First titles===

In 1900 the CURCC was one of four charter members of the Uruguay Association Football League, making its debut in official competition on 10 June against Albion and winning 2–1. The club won its first Uruguayan championship that year, repeating in 1901, 1905 and 1907. In 1906 Charles W. Bayne took over the railroad, and refused to sponsor the football team due to financial and work issues. Conflict between the company and the football club led to the severance of their relationship in 1913.

In 1908, the club left the Uruguayan league after the league rejected their request to replay a game with F.C. Dublín. CURCC had lost 2–3 on the road, and believed their poor showing was due to refereeing mistakes caused by pressure from rabid home fans. As a sign of good faith, Nacional also retired from the league, since both teams agreed that &quot;Los Partidos se ganan en la Cancha&quot;, or &quot;matches are won on the pitch&quot;. Back in competition the following year, relations between the CUR and the club became frostier after fans burned a train car used for rival teams.

A year after the club&#x27;s 1911 Uruguayan championship, the club attempted reforms to its policies. Proposals included greater participation by non-CUR players and a name change to &quot;CURCC Peñarol&quot;. In June 1913, the proposals were rejected; the company wanted to distance itself from the club&#x27;s local reputation. The railroad company, decided to separate the &quot; foot-ball &quot; section of the team from the company on Saturday 13 December 1913. That is when Peñarol was founded. The following day it was the first time a &quot; Clasico &quot; was officially played between Nacional and Peñarol.

CURCC kept playing football in the amateurism until it was dissolved on 22 January 1915 and donated all their trophies to the British Hospital of Montevideo, not to Peñarol.

===C.A. Peñarol===

On 12 March 1914, Peñarol replaced CURCC&#x27;s spot in the Uruguayan Football League after its foundation in 1913. A request submitted to the Uruguayan Football League two days later and approved the following day. During its first years Peñarol was not successful, although a new stadium (&quot;Las Acacias&quot;) opened on 19 May 1916. The club won its first two league titles in 1918 and 1920.

In November 1922 the Asociación Uruguaya de Fútbol (AUF) disqualified Peñarol because the club played an exhibition game with Racing, an Argentine club affiliated with Asociación Amateurs de Football (a dissident association established in 1919 that rivalized with the official entity, AFA). Peñarol and other clubs then organised a new league, the Uruguayan Football Federation (FUF), and the club won the 1924 championship. The league was short-lived; Peñarol won the 1926 Copa del Consejo Provisorio, triggering a merger between the AUF and the FUF.
===First European tour===
In 1927, Peñarol made its first tour to Europe, playing a total of 19 matches against teams from Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Spain, Czechoslovakia and France. The tour extended from April to June. The first match of the tour was vs. the Vienna combined, which Peñarol lost by 3–1. The Uruguayan team then played Bayern Munich (1–2), SpVgg (1–2), Hertha BSC (Berlin) (0–1). The first win was v. Eintracht Frankfurt (3–1). The lineup for that match was Luis Biscardi, Demis D’Agosto, José Benincasa, Pascual Ruotta, Gildeón Silva, Antonio Aguerre, Ladislao Pérez, Antonio Sacco, Pablo Terevinto, Peregrín Anselmo, Antonio Campolo. Goals were scored by Suffiotti (2) and Ruotta. The tour continued in Switzerland, v. Young Fellows (1–0), Rapid Vienna (0–5), then facing Sparta Prague (losing by 1–0).

On 5 June, Peñarol played its first game in Spain v. FC Barcelona, losing by 1–5. The second test was played one day later, finishing in a tie (1–1). Other notable games of the tour were the two tests v. Atlético Madrid (5–2 and 4–3).

Peñarol played a total of 19 matches in 80 days (6 in Spain, 5 in Germany, 4 in Switzerland and 1 in Czechoslovakia and France), totalizing 7 wins, 4 draws and 8 losses. The team scored 32 goals and received 33, with Antonio Sacco being the topscorer with 9 goals.

After its first European tour in 1927, Peñarol won the Uruguayan championship in 1928 and 1929; the following year, the club defeated Olimpia 1–0 in its first game at the Centenario Stadium in Montevideo.
===Consolidation===

In 1932, Peñarol and River Plate played the first game of the professional era. Peñarol won the first Uruguayan professional championship with 40 points, five more than runners-up Rampla Juniors. After placing second in 1933 and 1934, the club won four consecutive league tournaments between 1935 and 1938; they also won the 1936 Torneo Competencia.

The club stayed in second place until 1944, when Peñarol again won the Uruguayan Championship (defeating Nacional in a two-game final, 0–0 and 3–2). In 1945 the club retained the title, with Nicolás Falero and Raúl Schiaffino the top goal scorers of the playoffs with 21 apiece. Peñarol was again victorious in 1949, four points ahead of runner-up Nacional with Óscar Míguez the top scorer.

After placing second in 1950, Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship the following year; this was also the start of the Palacio Peñarol&#x27;s four-year construction. During the 1950s, the club also won national championships in 1953, 1954, 1958 and 1959.

===International success===

Their 1959 championship qualified Peñarol for the recently created Copa Libertadores, an international competition then known as the Copa de Campeones de América. Peñarol won the first two tournaments, beating Olimpia of Paraguay in 1960 and Palmeiras of Brazil in 1961. That year the club won its first Intercontinental Cup, defeating Benfica of Portugal 2–1 in the third game. Peñarol won three more league titles (1960, 1961 and 1962), for five consecutive championships. Béla Guttmann coached the team in 1962.

After a quiet year in 1963, Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship in 1964 and 1965 and the Copa Libertadores in 1966, defeating River Plate 4–2. That year the club won its second Intercontinental Cup, defeating Real Madrid 2–0 in Centenario Stadium and Santiago Bernabéu. During the next few years the club won national championships in 1967 and 1968 and the Intercontinental Champions&#x27; Supercup in 1969 (a tournament with South American Intercontinental Cup winners). Peñarol had the longest undefeated run in Uruguayan league history: 56 games, from 3 September 1966 to 14 September 1968. Copa Libertadores all-time top scorer Alberto Spencer played for Peñarol at this time.

In 1970 the club again reached the Libertadores final again, losing to Estudiantes de La Plata. The club set a tournament record for greatest goal difference, defeating Valencia of Venezuela 11–2. With Fernando Morena as the team&#x27;s star, the club won the Uruguayan championship for three consecutive years, from 1973 to 1975. After placing second in 1976 and 1977, Peñarol won again in 1978. That year, Morena set two records: most goals scored in a Uruguayan season (36) and most goals scored in a single game (seven, against Huracán Buceo on 16 July). The 1970s ended with another championship in 1979. Morena was top scorer in the Uruguayan tournament six straight times, and top Copa Libertadores scorer in 1974 and 1975.

After beginning the 1980s with a third-place finish in 1981, Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship with Fernando Morena and Rubén Paz (the tournament&#x27;s top scorer). The next season the club again won the Copa Libertadores, defeating Cobreloa of Chile 1–0 on a goal from Fernando Morena (the tournament&#x27;s top scorer with seven goals) in the game&#x27;s final minutes. Later that year the club won the Uruguayan championship and its third Intercontinental Cup, defeating Aston Villa 2–0.
Despite financial problems during the 1980s, Peñarol won the national championship in 1985 and 1986, and a fifth Copa Libertadores in 1987. The club defeated América de Cali 1–0 with a goal by Diego Aguirre in the final seconds of extra time, when a tie would have gone to the Colombians on the goal differential. It was the third Copa Libertadores won by Peñarol at the Nacional de Chile, following victories in 1966 and 1982.
Peñarol celebrated its hundredth anniversary in 1991, despite a controversy ignited by archrivals Nacional concerning Peñarol&#x27;s 1913 name change. With Pablo Bengoechea and the young Antonio Pacheco on the team and Gregorio Pérez behind the bench, Peñarol again won the Uruguayan championship five straight times (1993–97). The club also reached the Copa Conmebol final in 1994 and 1995, rounding out the century with a national championship in 1999 (defeating Nacional 2–1 in the final, despite Julio Ribas on the bench).

The next year, Peñarol lost the Uruguayan championship final against Nacional; many of the team&#x27;s players were jailed after a tournament fight. Peñarol won the national championship again in 2003 for Diego Aguirre, defeating Nacional in the final. The club did not win another national title until the 2009–10 season, when it won the Clausura tournament with 14 victories in 15 games (12 of them in a row). In the Clausura final, Peñarol defeated Nacional 2–1. The championship qualified the team for the Libertadores 2011, where Peñarol reached the final with Santos.

The club was congratulated on its 120th anniversary in September 2011 by presidents Joseph Blatter, Michel Platini, and Nicolás Leoz.

==Crest and colors==

===Badge===

Throughout the club&#x27;s history minor changes have been made to its symbols, but it has kept its original colors. The shield and flag were designed by architect Constante Facello and consist of five black stripes, four yellow stripes and eleven yellow stars on a black background (representing the eleven players).

===Uniforms===
Since its founding, Peñarol&#x27;s colors have been yellow and black. They were inspired by the Rocket locomotive designed by George Stephenson, which won an award in 1829.

The first jersey was a plain shirt, divided into four square sections which alternated black and yellow. A variant had two vertical halves (black on the right and black-and-yellow stripes on the left), with black shorts and socks. Peñarol&#x27;s official jersey (black and yellow stripes) dates back to 1911 and has been worn almost continuously, with only slight variations.

===Inspiration for Romanian club FC Brașov===
Peñarol inspired Romanian club FC Brașov to change its official colors in December 1966 from white and blue to yellow and black. The change came following a tournament of Romania&#x27;s Olympic football team in Uruguay. After a match with Peñarol, Csaba Györffy, player at FC Brașov, received from Peñarol&#x27;s captain Alberto Spencer the shirt with which he played. Györffy was fascinated by the combination of yellow and black stripes and decided at the return in the country to wear the shirt during his training sessions with the team. The decision to change the colors of the club was taken by coach Silviu Ploeşteanu, who considered that, in the new colors, the team will be seen better on the field. Since January 1967, the team from Brașov has yellow-black as official colors, recalling Peñarol.

===Stadium===

Peñarol&#x27;s first stadium was the José Pedro Damiani, also known as &quot;Las Acacias&quot;. It was bought in 1913 and inaugurated on 19 April 1916 with a 3–1 victory over Nacional. The stadium&#x27;s gate was that of the former Estadio Pocitos, Peñarol&#x27;s first stadium where the first goal in the history of the FIFA World Cup was scored in 1930.

The stadium is in the Marconi neighbourhood of Montevideo. Its pitch is of , and it has a capacity of 12,000. Because Peñarol was not allowed to play there due to security concerns, the club home ground was the city owned Estadio Centenario. Opened on 18 July 1930, the Centenario stadium is in Parque Batlle and can hold 65,235.

Las Acacias has acted as the home ground for all Peñarol&#x27;s Youth Teams.

On 28 September 2012, the club proposed a 40,000-capacity stadium in the outskirts of Montevideo, about from the Aeropuerto Internacional de Carrasco. The name of their newest stadium is Campeón del Siglo (CDS), opening in March 2016 and which has been the home ground ever since.

===Palacio Peñarol===

The Palacio Peñarol, in downtown Montevideo, is the club&#x27;s headquarters and basketball stadium. It was opened on 21 June 1955; and is located. The Palacio has in addition to basketball, it is home the club&#x27;s museum and offices. After the October 2010 collapse of the Cilindro Municipal, the Palacio Peñarol became an important venue for Uruguayan basketball.

===Complejo Deportivo Washington Cataldi===
The Complejo Deportivo Washington Cataldi, commonly known as Los Aromos, is a training ground for the main team. In Villa Los Aromos of Barros Blancos, in the Canelones department, Los Aromos was bought in 1945; under the direction of architect José Donato, it was built in two years.

===Centro de Alto Rendimiento===
For the club&#x27;s 118th anniversary, the Centro de Alto Rendimiento was inaugurated. The new facility, which opened on 28 September 2009, includes five football pitches, a weight room and a gymnasium with artificial turf.

=== Frank Henderson School ===
The Frank Henderson School, named in honor of the club&#x27;s first president, is a few kilometers away from the Centro de Alto Rendimiento. It was built to develop the club&#x27;s young players, and houses those who come from other areas.
==Supporters==

In Uruguayan football, loyalty to Peñarol or Nacional divides the country. The clubs are evenly matched, and have a large fan base. Many surveys of public opinion have been conducted, but none have been conclusive. In 1993 the Factum consulting firm reported that Peñarol was the favorite team of 41 percent of football fans, while 38 percent supported Nacional. Factum conducted another survey in 2006, confirming its previous results: Peñarol with 45 percent and Nacional with 35 percent.

MPC Consultants surveyed 9,000 Uruguayans; Peñarol had 45 percent of the supporters, and Nacional 38 percent. An online survey on the webpage Sportsvs.com showed Nacional with 50.35 percent and Peñarol with 49.45 percent.

Since its formation, Peñarol&#x27;s &quot;barra brava&quot; has been involved in violence against other clubs and the Uruguayan police. Incidents provoked by these fans have cost Peñarol 31 points since 1994; the penalties cost the team three tournaments (Apertura 1994, Clausura 1997 and Clausura 2002).

===Fan club===
In 2010 the club attempted to increase its fan base to improve its sustainability. During Clausura 2010 promotions were offered, marketing managers hired and the &quot;peñas&quot; (local fan clubs) encouraged. The campaign was successful; in February 2013 the club had over 62,000 members, the largest fan club in Uruguay.

===Rivalries===
The Uruguayan Derby between Peñarol and Nacional goes back to 1900, the oldest football rivalry outside the British Islands. The first game ever played between Nacional and CURCC was on 15 July 1900 and ended 2–0 in favor of CURCC. CURCC was ahead at first, but Nacional caught up during the late 1910s. Nacional took the lead by fourteen games in 1948, and would not surrender it until the late 1970s (except briefly in 1968). Since then, Peñarol has been the leader; its longest lead was 26 games in January 2004. Including the amateur and professional eras, league and friendly games, the teams have met 511 times in the past with 182 victories to Peñarol, 166 to Nacional and 163 ties.

A notable game for Peñarol fans is occurred on 9 October 1949 in the Uruguayan Cup first round, and is known as the &quot;Clásico de la fuga&quot; (the &quot;escape derby&quot;). At the end of the first half Peñarol was leading 2–0, but at halftime Nacional decided not to return. While Peñarol fans believe that Nacional did not want to be defeated by a Peñarol team known as the &quot;Máquina del 49&quot; (&quot;Machine of 49&quot;), Nacional supporters claim it was a protest against poor officiating.

On 23 April 1987 for a friendly game, Peñarol and Nacional were tied 1–1 with 22 minutes remaining when three Peñarol players (José Perdomo, José Herrera and Ricardo Viera) were ejected after a foul and subsequent protests. Peñarol then had to face a full Nacional team with only eight players on the pitch. With eight minutes remaining Diego Aguirre set up Jorge Cabrera, who scored the winning goal. This win by the &quot;aurinegro&quot; was known as the &quot;Clásico de los 8 contra 11&quot; (the &quot;8 against 11 derby&quot;).

Peñarol and Nacional have faced each other in the final game of the Uruguayan Championship thirteen times, with Peñarol winning eight. The most recent was in 2018, when Peñarol won the championship 2–1.

===&quot;Manyas: The Movie&quot;===
In early October 2011 &quot;Manyas: The Movie&quot;, a documentary about Peñarol&#x27;s fans, was released in Uruguay. Produced by Kafka Films and Sacromonte and directed by Andrés Benvenuto, the film features interviews with fans, football journalists, psychologists and politicians. &quot;Manyas: The Movie&quot; was deemed of cultural interest by the Culture and Education Ministry of Uruguay and of ministerial interest by Uruguay&#x27;s Ministry of Tourism and Sport. The film had the most-successful premiere of any Uruguayan film, selling 13,000 tickets during its first weekend and 30,000 over its first fifteen days.
===World&#x27;s Biggest flag===
After raising $35,000 in raffles and donations, on 12 April 2011 Peñarol fans unveiled the largest flag ever unfurled in a stadium up to that moment. Nacional unfurled a bigger one years later that covered three stands of the stadium. The flag, long and wide for a surface area of , covered one-and-a-half grandstands in Centenario Stadium.
In 2013, Club Nacional de Football displayed a flag which was 600 metres long by 50 metres wide. This is now the world&#x27;s biggest flag.

===Noted players===
Néstor Gonçalves has the most official games in the club&#x27;s history (571 matches), between 28 April 1957 and 28 November 1970. The team&#x27;s all-time top scorers in the Primera División are Fernando Morena (203), Alberto Spencer (113) and Óscar Míguez (107). Morena&#x27;s (whose 230 goals—203 with Peñarol and 27 with River Plate—make him the highest-scoring player in the Uruguayan League) 440 goals with Peñarol are a record as well. He scored the most goals in a single Uruguayan season (36 in 1978), and is the club&#x27;s second-best goal scorer in international competition with 37 goals (behind Alberto Spencer, who scored 58 goals between 1960 and 1970). Spencer and Morena are the top scorers in Copa Libertadores history, with 48 and 37 goals respectively for Peñarol.

Peñarol has made a large contribution to the Uruguay national football team. Three Peñarol players were on the Uruguayan team which played Argentina in 1905. Five Peñarol players were on the Uruguayan squad which won the 1930 FIFA World Cup: goalkeeper Miguel Capuccini, defender Peregrino Anselmo and midfielders Lorenzo Fernández, Álvaro Gestido and Carlos Riolfo. Peñarol had nine players on the Uruguayan squad which won the 1950 FIFA World Cup: goalkeeper Roque Máspoli, defenders Juan Carlos González and Washington Ortuño, midfielders Juan Alberto Schiaffino and Obdulio Varela and forwards Ernesto Vidal, Julio César Britos, Óscar Míguez and Alcides Ghiggia. Schiaffino and Ghiggia scored the team&#x27;s two goals in the Maracanazo, the final game against Brazil. Peñarol is the only club which has represented Uruguay in all its World Cup appearances.

==Managers==

While there is no hard information about managers in the amateur era of Uruguayan football, Peñarol has had a total of 62 coaches during its professional era. The first manager was Leonardo de Luca, who coached the team for two years and won the Uruguayan Championship (the first professional tournament in Uruguay) in 1932.

Of these 62 managers, 53 were Uruguayan; two were Hungarian (Emérico Hirschl and Béla Guttmann), two British (John Harley and Randolph Galloway), one Serbian (Ljupko Petrović), two Brazilian (Osvaldo Brandão and Dino Sani), one from Chile (Mario Tuane) and two from Argentina (Jorge Kistenmacher and César Luis Menotti).

Hugo Bagnulo and Gregorio Pérez have coached Peñarol the longest, leading the first team for eight seasons: Bagnulo for four stints and Pérez for five. Athuel Velásquez had the longest uninterrupted coaching period for Peñarol (five straight years, between 1935 and 1940). Bagnulo has the most Uruguayan championships (five); Pérez and Velásquez follow, with four each. In international competition Roberto Scarone was the most successful manager, winning two Copa Libertadores and an Intercontinental Cup with Peñarol.

==Administration==

During a meeting presided over by Roland Moor on 28 September 1891, it was stipulated that responsibility for the Central Uruguay Railway Cricket Club would belong to the principal administrator of the Central Uruguay Railway Company of Montevideo. The first president of the club was Frank Henderson, who remained in that office until 1899.

After Henderson CUR administrators remained as chairmen of the sports club until 1906, when Charles W. Bayne took over the CUR. Bayne refused to sponsor the CURCC because of vandalism by fans and absenteeism by workers. He was replaced by CUR employee Roland Moor.

Conflicts remained between the company and the sports club, which resulted in the separation of CURCC&#x27;s football section from the company and a name change to Club Atlético Peñarol. Jorge Clulow, an Englishman with Uruguayan nationality, was chosen chairman of the club; he remained in office from 1914 to 1915.

==Statistics==


Peñarol played 26 seasons of the Uruguay Association Football League, from its creation in 1900 until the end of the amateur era in 1931 (absent 1923–26, when the club was disaffiliated from the AUF). During this period Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship nine times, with its best years in 1900 and 1905 (when the club won the championship without conceding any points). Peñarol was undefeated in 1901, 1903 and 1907. Its worst year was 1908; the team left the league after ten games, forfeiting the other eight. Peñarol&#x27;s largest goal difference in a game during its amateur era was in 1903, when they defeated Triunfo 12–0.

The club placed second in 1923 (when they scored a record 100 goals), and won in 1924; its most impressive victory was a 10–0 win over Roberto Cherry during the cancelled 1925 season. Both tournaments were organised by dissident body Uruguayan Football Federation (FUF).

Since the beginning of the professional era in 1932, Peñarol and Nacional are the only teams who have played every season for the Uruguayan championship. Peñarol has the most Uruguayan League titles (winning 38 times between 1932 and 2013) and the greatest number of undefeated championships (1949, 1954, 1964, 1967, 1968, 1975 and 1978). Its best performances were in 1949 and 1964, seasons when the team scored 94.44 percent of possible points; its worst season was 2005–06, when it finished in 16th place after winning 32.32 percent of possible points. A 12-point deduction given the team by the AUF because of unrest after a game with Cerro relegated them to that position.

Peñarol&#x27;s best victory was a 9–0 win against Rampla Juniors in 1962; its worst defeat was 0–6 against Nacional. On the international scene, its best result was an 11–2 win over Valencia of Venezuela on 15 March 1970; its worst was against Olimpia of Paraguay, a 0–6 loss on 10 December 1990 during the Supercopa Sudamericana.

Peñarol holds a number of national and international records. The club has the longest undefeated run in the Uruguayan league: 56 games, from 3 September 1966 to 14 September 1968. This is also the longest undefeated run in South American professional football (second place if amateur leagues are counted).

It was the first club to win the Copa Libertadores de América undefeated, in 1960. Peñarol has the greatest number of appearances in the Copa Libertadores (40), and the second most appearances in the finals (10) after Boca Juniors. The club holds the record for the biggest win (11–2 against Valencia), and the biggest goal difference in a two-legged elimination (defeating Everest from Ecuador 5–0 and 9–1). Peñarol is one of the teams with five Intercontinental Cup appearances, the first to reach that number.

==Honours==
=== Senior titles ===


===Under-20 team===
===South American Club of the Century===

In 2009, the International Federation of Football History &amp; Statistics released a list of the best clubs of the 20th century on each continent. The organization awarded points for each victory in a quarterfinal or higher in international competition but only took into account games played after 1932 for the Professional era. Peñarol was the number-one team in South America, above Independiente of Argentina and arch-rivals Nacional.

==Other sports==

===Basketball===
Peñarol&#x27;s basketball records date back to the late 1920s, when Club Piratas was formed; in 1931, it became Peñarol. Its first league game (in the fourth division of Uruguayan basketball) was played in 1940. By 1943 the team, playing in the first division for Ramón Esnal, finished third. The following year Peñarol won the Federal Championship, a tournament attracting the best basketball teams in Montevideo; in 2003, the league changed its name to Liga Uruguaya de Basketball.

In 1945, Peñarol jumped from the Uruguayan Basketball Federation to play in a new league; when the upstart league failed, the club rejoined the federation in 1947. In 1952 Peñarol again won the Federal Championship, winning the Winter Tournament in 1953 and 1955. After a low period (with relegation in 1968), Peñarol won the Uruguayan Championship in 1973, 1978, and 1979;the latter was the first professional tournament in league history. In 1982 the club enjoyed its most successful season, winning the Federal Championship and the Winter Tournament The club also won the Campeonato Sudamericano de Clubes in 1983. In 1985 the club was relegated, beginning a downward spiral which ended with its expulsion from the league in 1997. However, the club rejoined in 2018 the Federación Uruguaya de Basket Ball, in the third tier.

===Cycling===
Peñarol has participated in the &quot;Vuelta Ciclista del Uruguay&quot; (Tour of Uruguay) since it began in 1939. Although the team rode well during its early years, it was not until the ninth edition (in 1952) that a Peñarol cyclist would win the race (Dante Sudatti, with an overall time of 48 hours, 38 minutes and 38 seconds). Peñarol cyclists also won the general classification 1953 and 1956; in the latter year, the club won the team championship.

After again winning the team championship in 1959, Peñarol would only win one individual championship in 1964. The team later improved, winning three individual titles in a row from 1989 to 1991 and the team victory in 1990 and 1991. 2002 was the fourth year that the club won both the individual and team classifications. Peñarol has competed in other road races, including José María Orlando&#x27;s 1990 victory in the Rutas de América.

===Futsal===
Peñarol began playing futsal in 1968. During its first two decades, the club won on the national and international levels (including a victory in the 1987 World Interclub Championship). In 1995 FIFA took over the sport, and Peñarol began competing in AUF tournaments. The team won the first three Uruguayan Championships (1995, 1996, and 1997), also finishing at the top in 1999 and 2004. It won another three consecutive tournaments in 2010, 2011 and 2012.

===Beach soccer===
In January 2013 Peñarol inaugurated its beach soccer section. Diego Monserrat, goalkeeper of the Uruguay national team for many years, was the institution&#x27;s first coach in this sport, while also goalkeeper Felipe Fernández was the club&#x27;s first captain. In the second half of the same month, Peñarol won one of the three groups of five teams, that formed the qualification tournament to the &quot;Super Liga&quot;, name given to the Uruguayan Championship of the discipline. After victories on quarterfinals and semi-finals, Peñarol was declared champion of the tournament without the need of a final, after the other semi-final was suspended.

===Rugby===

Peñarol have announced that they will form a rugby union section to compete in the inaugural 2020 season of the Superliga Americana de Rugby, to be start in February 2020. Peñarol Rugby will be the only representative of Uruguay at the competition.

Peñarol Rugby was the Champion of the 2022 Súper Liga Americana de Rugby season.

=== Esports ===
Peñarol also has an esports division, with squads competing in League of Legends and FIFA leagues organized by the Uruguayan Virtual Football Association.

<text>Stephen III, commonly known as Stephen the Great (; ); died 2 July 1504), was Voivode (or Prince) of Moldavia from 1457 to 1504. He was the son of and co-ruler with Bogdan II, who was murdered in 1451 in a conspiracy organized by his brother and Stephen&#x27;s uncle Peter III Aaron, who took the throne. Stephen fled to Hungary, and later to Wallachia; with the support of Vlad III Țepeș, Voivode of Wallachia, he returned to Moldavia, forcing Aaron to seek refuge in Poland in the summer of 1457. Teoctist I, Metropolitan of Moldavia, anointed Stephen prince. He attacked Poland and prevented Casimir IV Jagiellon, King of Poland, from supporting Peter Aaron, but eventually acknowledged Casimir&#x27;s suzerainty in 1459.

Stephen decided to recapture Chilia (now Kiliia in Ukraine), an important port on the Danube, which brought him into conflict with Hungary and Wallachia. He besieged the town during the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia in 1462, but was seriously wounded during the siege. Two years later, he captured the town. He promised support to the leaders of the Three Nations of Transylvania against Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, in 1467. Corvinus invaded Moldavia, but Stephen defeated him in the Battle of Baia. Peter Aaron attacked Moldavia with Hungarian support in December 1470, but was also defeated by Stephen and executed, along with the Moldavian boyars who still endorsed him. Stephen restored old fortresses and built new ones, which improved Moldavia&#x27;s defence system as well as strengthened central administration. Ottoman expansion threatened Moldavian ports in the region of the Black Sea. In 1473, Stephen stopped paying tribute (&quot;haraç&quot;) to the Ottoman sultan and launched a series of campaigns against Wallachia in order to replace its rulers – who had accepted Ottoman suzerainty – with his protégés. However, each prince who seized the throne with Stephen&#x27;s support was soon forced to pay homage to the sultan.

Stephen eventually defeated a large Ottoman army in the Battle of Vaslui in 1475. He was referred to as &quot;Athleta Christi&quot; (&quot;Champion of Christ&quot;) by Pope Sixtus IV, even though Moldavia&#x27;s hopes for military support went unfulfilled. The following year, Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II routed Stephen in the Battle of Valea Albă, but the lack of provisions and the outbreak of a plague forced him to withdraw from Moldavia. Taking advantage of a truce with Matthias Corvinus, the Ottomans captured Chilia and their Crimean Tatar allies Cetatea Albă (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in Ukraine) in 1484. Although Corvinus granted two Transylvanian estates to Stephen, the Moldavian prince paid homage to Casimir, who promised to support him to regain Chilia and Cetatea Albă. Stephen&#x27;s efforts to capture the two ports ended in failure. From 1486, he again paid a yearly tribute to the Ottomans. During the following years, dozens of stone churches and monasteries were built in Moldavia, which contributed to the development of a specific Moldavian architecture.

Casimir IV&#x27;s successor, John I Albert, wanted to grant Moldavia to his younger brother, Sigismund, but Stephen&#x27;s diplomacy prevented him from invading Moldavia for years. John Albert attacked Moldavia in 1497, but Stephen and his Hungarian and Ottoman allies routed the Polish army in the Battle of the Cosmin Forest. Stephen again tried to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă, but he had to acknowledge the loss of the two ports to the Ottomans in 1503. During his last years, his son and co-ruler Bogdan III played an active role in government. Stephen&#x27;s long rule represented a period of stability in the history of Moldavia. From the 16th century onwards both his subjects and foreigners remembered him as a great ruler. Modern Romanians regard him as one of their greatest national heroes, and he also endures as a cult figure in Moldovenism. After the Romanian Orthodox Church canonized him in 1992, he is venerated as &quot;Stephen the Great and Holy&quot; (&quot;Ștefan cel Mare și Sfânt&quot;).

== Early life ==

Stephen was the son of Bogdan, who was a son of Alexander the Good, Prince of Moldavia. Stephen&#x27;s mother, Maria Oltea, was most probably related to the princes of Wallachia, according to historian Radu Florescu. The date of Stephen&#x27;s birth is unknown, though historians estimate that he was born between 1433 and 1440. One church diptych records that he had five siblings: brothers Ioachim, Ioan, Christea; and sisters Sorea and Maria. Some of Stephen&#x27;s biographers hypothesize that Cârstea Arbore, father of the statesman Luca Arbore, was the prince&#x27;s fourth brother, or that Cârstea was the same as Ioachim. These links with the high-ranking Moldavian boyars are known to have been preserved through matrimonial connections: Maria, who died in 1485, was the wife of Șendrea, gatekeeper of Suceava; Stephen&#x27;s other brother-in-law, Isaia, also held high office at his court.

The death of Alexander the Good in 1432 gave rise to a succession crisis that lasted more than two decades. Stephen&#x27;s father seized the throne in 1449 after defeating one of his relatives with the support of John Hunyadi, Regent-Governor of Hungary. Stephen was styled &quot;voivode&quot; in his father&#x27;s charters, showing that he had been made his father&#x27;s heir and co-ruler. Bogdan acknowledged the suzerainty of Hunyadi in 1450. Stephen fled to Hungary after Peter III Aaron (who was also Alexander the Good&#x27;s son) murdered Bogdan in October 1451.

Vlad Țepeș (who had lived in Moldavia during Bogdan II&#x27;s reign) invaded Wallachia and seized the throne with the support of Hunyadi in 1456. Stephen either accompanied Vlad to Wallachia during the military campaign or joined him after Vlad became the ruler of Wallachia. According to reports from the 1480s, Stephen spent part of that interval in Brăila, where he fathered an illegitimate son, Mircea. With the assistance of Vlad, Stephen stormed into Moldavia at the head of an army 6,000 strong in the spring of 1457. According to Moldavian chronicles, &quot;men from the Lower Country&quot; (the southern region of Moldavia) joined him. The 17th-century Grigore Ureche wrote: &quot;Stephen routed Peter Aaron at Doljești on 12 April, but Peter Aaron left Moldavia for Poland only after Stephen inflicted a second defeat on him at Orbic.&quot;

== Reign ==
=== Early campaigns ===

One widely accepted theory, based on Ureche, states that an assembly of boyars and Orthodox clergymen acclaimed Stephen the ruler of Moldavia at Direptate, a meadow near Suceava. According to scholar Constantin Rezachievici, this elective custom has no precedent before the 17th century, and appears superfluous in Stephen&#x27;s case; he argues that it was a legend fabricated by Ureche. While this election remains uncertain, various historians agree that Teoctist I, Metropolitan of Moldavia, anointed Stephen prince. To emphasize the sacred nature of his rule, Stephen styled himself &quot;By the Grace of God, ... Stephen voivode, lord (or &quot;hospodar&quot;) of the Moldavian lands&quot; on 13 September 1457. His use of Christian devices for legitimization overlapped with a troubled context for Moldavian Orthodoxy: the attempted Catholic–Orthodox union had divided the Byzantine Rite churches into supporters and dissidents; likewise, the Fall of Constantinople had encouraged local bishops to consider themselves independent of the Patriarchy. There is a long-standing dispute about whether Teoctist was a dissenter, belonging to one of the several emancipated Orthodox jurisdictions, or a loyalist of Patriarch Isidore. Historian Dan Ioan Mureșan argues that the evidence is for the latter option, because Moldavia appears on the list of Patriarchate jurisdictions, and because Stephen, though he tested the Patriarch by sometimes using imperial titles such as &quot;tsar&quot; by 1473, was never threatened with excommunication. 

As one of his earliest actions as prince, Stephen attacked Poland to prevent Casimir IV from supporting Peter Aaron in 1458. This first military campaign &quot;established his credentials as a military commander of stature&quot;, according to historian Jonathan Eagles. However, he wanted to avoid prolonged conflict with Poland, because the recapture of Chilia was his principal aim. Chilia was an important port on the Danube that Peter III of Moldavia had surrendered to Hungary in 1448. He signed a treaty with Poland on the river Dniester on 4 April 1459. He acknowledged the suzerainty of Casimir IV and promised to support Poland against Tatar marauders. Casimir in turn pledged to protect Stephen against his enemies and to forbid Peter Aaron from returning to Moldavia. Peter Aaron subsequently left Poland for Hungary and settled in Székely Land, Transylvania.

Stephen invaded Székely Land multiple times in 1461. Matthias Corvinus, King of Hungary, decided to support Peter Aaron, giving him shelter in his capital at Buda. In 1462, Stephen underscored his wish for good relations with the Ottoman Empire, expelling from Moldavia the Franciscans, who were agitating for a united church and a crusade. Stephen continued to pay the yearly tribute to the Ottoman Empire initiated by his predecessor. He also made a new agreement with Poland in Suceava on 2 March 1462, promising to personally swear fealty to Casimir IV if the king required it. This treaty declared that Casimir was the sole suzerain of Moldavia, prohibiting Stephen from alienating Moldavian territories without his authorization. It also obliged Stephen to recapture the Moldavian territories that had been lost, obviously in reference to Chilia.

Written sources evidence that the relationship between Stephen and Vlad Țepeș became tense in early 1462. On 2 April 1462, the Genoese governor of Caffa (now Feodosia in Crimea) informed Casimir IV of Poland that Stephen had attacked Wallachia while Vlad Țepeș was waging war against the Ottomans. The Ottoman Sultan, Mehmed II, later invaded Wallachia in June 1462. Mehmed&#x27;s secretary, Tursun Beg, recorded that Vlad Țepeș had to station 7,000 soldiers near the Wallachian-Moldavian frontier during the sultan&#x27;s invasion to &quot;protect his country against his Moldavian enemies&quot;. Both Tursun and Laonikos Chalkokondyles note that Stephen&#x27;s troops were loyal to Mehmed, and directly involved in the invasion. Taking advantage of the presence of the Ottoman fleet at the Danube Delta, Stephen also laid siege to Chilia in late June. According to Domenico Balbi, the Venetian envoy in Istanbul, Stephen and the Ottomans besieged the fortress for eight days, but they could not capture it, because the &quot;Hungarian garrison and Țepeș&#x27;s 7,000 men&quot; defeated them, killing &quot;many Turks&quot;. Stephen was seriously wounded during the siege, suffering an injury on his left calf, or his left foot, that would never heal his entire life.
=== Consolidation ===

Stephen again laid siege to Chilia on 24 January 1465. The Moldavian army bombarded the fortress for two days, forcing the garrison to surrender on 25 or 26 January. The sultan&#x27;s vassal, Radu the Handsome, Voivode of Wallachia, had also laid claim to Chilia, thus the capture of the port gave rise to conflicts not only with Hungary, but also with Wallachia and the Ottoman Empire. In 1465 or earlier, Stephen peacefully regained the fortress of Hotin (now Khotyn in Ukraine) on the Dniester from the Poles. To commemorate the capture of Chilia, Stephen ordered the construction of the Church of the Assumption of the Mother of God in a glade on the Putna River in 1466. It became the central monument of Putna Monastery, extended by Stephen in 1467, when he donated the village of Vicov, and finally consecrated in September 1470.

At Matthias Corvinus&#x27; instance, the Diet of Hungary abolished all previous exemptions relating to the tax known as the &quot;chamber&#x27;s profit&quot;. The leaders of the Three Nations of Transylvania who regarded the reform as an infringement of their privileges declared on 18 August 1467 that they were ready to fight to defend their liberties. Stephen promised support to them, but they yielded to Corvinus without resistance after the king marched to Transylvania. Corvinus invaded Moldavia and captured Baia, Bacău, Roman and Târgu Neamț. Stephen assembled his army and launched a crushing defeat on the invaders in the Battle of Baia on 15 December. This episode was presented in contemporary Hungarian chronicles as a defeat of Stephen&#x27;s armies. However, Corvinus, who received wounds in the battle, could only escape from the battlefield with the help of Moldavian boyars who had joined him. A group of boyars rose up against Stephen in the Lower Country, but he had 20 boyars and 40 other landowners captured and executed before the end of the year.

Stephen again swore loyalty to Casimir IV in the presence of the Polish envoy in Suceava on 28 July 1468. He conducted raids against Transylvania between 1468 and 1471. When Casimir came to Lviv in February 1469 to personally receive his homage, Stephen did not go to meet him. In the same year or in early 1470, Tatars invaded Moldavia, but Stephen routed them in the Battle of Lipnic near the Dniester. To strengthen the defence system along the river, Stephen decided to erect new fortresses at Old Orhei and Soroca around the same time. A Wallachian army laid siege to Chilia, but it could not force the Moldavian garrison to surrender.

Matthias Corvinus sent peace proposals to Stephen. His envoys sought Casimir IV&#x27;s advice on Corvinus&#x27; proposals at the Sejm (or general assembly) of Poland at Piotrków Trybunalski in late 1469. Stephen invaded Wallachia and destroyed Brăila and Târgul de Floci (the two most important Wallachian centres of commerce on the Danube) in February 1470. Peter Aaron hired Székely troops and broke into Moldavia in December 1470, but his attack was probably anticipated by Stephen. The voivode defeated his rival near Târgu Neamț. Peter Aaron fell captive in the battlefield. He and his Moldavian supporters, among them Stephen&#x27;s &quot;vornic&quot; and brother-in-law, Isaia, and the chancellor Alexa, were executed on the orders of Stephen. Radu the Fair also invaded Moldavia, but Stephen defeated him at Soci on 7 March 1471. Reportedly, he killed all but two of the Wallachian noblemen he captured in battle.

The relationship between Casimir IV and Matthias Corvinus became tense in early 1471. After Stephen failed to support Poland, Casimir IV dispatched an embassy to Moldavia, insisting that Stephen should comply with his obligations. Stephen met the Polish envoys in Vaslui on 13 July, reminding them of the hostile acts Polish noblemen committed along the border and demanded the extradition of the Moldavian boyars who had fled to Poland. In parallel, he sent his own envoys to Hungary to start negotiations with Corvinus. He granted commercial privileges to Saxon merchants from the Transylvanian town of Corona (now Brașov) on 3 January 1472.

=== Wars with Mehmed II ===

The Ottomans put pressure on Stephen to abandon Chilia and Cetatea Albă (now Bilhorod-Dnistrovskyi in Ukraine) in the early 1470s. Instead of obeying their demands, Stephen declined to send the yearly tribute to the Sublime Porte in 1473. From 1472, he had friendly contacts with Uzun Hasan, sultan of Aq Qoyunlu, plotting an anti-Ottoman coordination. Taking advantage of Mehmed&#x27;s war against Uzun in Anatolia, Stephen invaded Wallachia to replace Radu the Fair, an Ottoman-installed Muslim convert and vassal, with his protégé, Basarab III Laiotă. He routed the Wallachian army at Râmnicu Sărat in a battle that lasted for three days from 18 to 20 November 1473. Four days later, the Moldavian army captured Bucharest and Stephen placed Basarab on the throne. However, Radu regained Wallachia with Ottoman support before the end of the year. Basarab again expelled Radu from Wallachia in 1475, but the Ottomans once more assisted him to return. The Wallachians took revenge by plundering some parts of Moldavia. To restore Basarab, Stephen launched a new campaign to Wallachia in October, forcing Radu to flee from the principality.

Mehmed II ordered Hadım Suleiman Pasha, Beylerbey (or governor) of Rumelia, to invade Moldavia – an Ottoman army of about 120,000 strong broke into Moldavia in late 1475. Wallachian troops also joined the Ottomans, while Stephen received support from Poland and Hungary. Outnumbered three to one by the invaders, Stephen was forced to retreat. He joined battle with Hadım Suleiman Pasha at Podul Înalt (or the High Bridge) near Vaslui on 10 January 1475. Before the battle, he had sent his buglers to hide behind the enemy fronts. When they suddenly sounded their horns, they caused such a panic among the invaders that they fled from the battlefield. Over the next three days, hundreds of Ottoman soldiers were massacred and the survivors retreated from Moldavia.
Stephen&#x27;s victory in the Battle of Vaslui was &quot;arguably one of the biggest European victories over the Ottomans&quot;, according to historian Alexander Mikaberidze. Mara Branković, Mehmed II&#x27;s stepmother, stated the Ottomans &quot;had never suffered a greater defeat&quot;. Stephen sent letters to the European rulers to seek their support against the Ottomans, reminding them that Moldavia was &quot;the Gateway of Christianity&quot; and &quot;the bastion of Hungary and Poland and the guardian of these kingdoms&quot;. Pope Sixtus IV praised him as &quot;Verus christiane fidei athleta&quot; (&quot;The true defender of the Christian faith&quot;). However, neither the Pope, nor any other European power, sent material support to Moldavia. Stephen was also approaching Mehmed with peace offers. According to disputed reports by the chronicler Jan Długosz, he was also playing down the invasion as the deed of &quot;some fugitives and brigands&quot; whom the Sultan would want to punish.

Meanwhile, Stephen&#x27;s brother-in-law, Alexander, seized the Principality of Theodoro in the Crimea at the head of a Moldavian army. Stephen also decided to expel his former protégé, Basarab Laiotă, from Wallachia, because Basarab had supported the Ottomans during their invasion of Moldavia. He made an alliance with Matthias Corvinus in July, persuading him to release Basarab&#x27;s rival, Vlad Țepeș, who had been imprisoned in Hungary in 1462. Stephen and Vlad made an agreement to put an end to the conflicts between Moldavia and Wallachia, but Corvinus did not support them to invade Wallachia. The Ottomans occupied the Principality of Theodoro and the Genoese colonies in the Crimea before the end of 1475. Stephen ordered the execution of the Ottoman prisoners in Moldavia to take vengeance for the massacre of Alexander of Theodoro and his Moldavian retainers. Thereafter the Venetians, who had waged war against the Ottomans since 1463, regarded Stephen as their principal ally. With their support, Stephen&#x27;s envoys tried to persuade the Holy See to finance Stephen&#x27;s war directly, instead of sending the funds to Matthias Corvinus. The Signoria of Venice emphasized, &quot;No one should fail to understand the extent to which Stephen could influence the evolution of events, one way or another&quot;, referring to his pre-eminent role in the anti-Ottoman alliance.

Mehmed II personally commanded a new invasion against Moldavia in the summer of 1476. This force included 12,000 Wallachians under Laiotă, and a retinue of Moldavians under a certain Alexandru, who claimed to be Stephen&#x27;s brother. The Crimean Tatars were the first to break into Moldavia at the Sultan&#x27;s order, but Stephen routed them. He also persuaded the Tatars of the Great Horde to break into the Crimea, forcing the Crimean Tatars to withdraw from Moldavia. The Sultan invaded Moldavia in late June 1476.

Himself supported by troops sent by Corvinus, Stephen adopted a scorched earth policy, but could not avoid a pitched battle. He suffered a defeat in the Battle of Valea Albă at Războieni on 26 July and had to seek refuge in Poland, but the Ottomans could not capture the fortress of Suceava, and similarly failed before Neamț. The lack of sufficient provisions and an outbreak of cholera in the Ottoman camp forced Mehmed to leave Moldavia, enabling the voivode to return from Poland. Folk tradition claims that Stephen had also been pledged a new army with the free peasantry of Putna County, grouped around the seven sons of a local lady, Tudora &quot;Baba&quot; Vrâncioaia. This contingent reportedly attacked the Ottomans&#x27; flank at Odobești. Another account, repeated by Ureche, is that Maria Oltea forced her son back into battle, pushing him to either return victorious or die.

The Byzantine historian George Sphrantzes concluded that Mehmed II &quot;had suffered more defeats than victories&quot; during the invasion of Moldavia. From summer 1475, during an interlude in the rivalry between Poland and Hungary, Stephen swore his allegiance to the latter. With Hungarian support, Stephen and Vlad Țepeș invaded Wallachia, forcing Basarab Laiotă to flee in November 1476. Stephen returned to Moldavia, leaving Moldavian troops behind for Vlad&#x27;s protection. The Ottomans invaded Wallachia to restore Basarab Laiotă. Țepeș and his Moldavian retainers were massacred before 10 January 1477. Stephen again broke into Wallachia and replaced Basarab Laiotă with Basarab IV the Younger.

Stephen sent his envoys to Rome and Venice, including John Tsamblak, to persuade the Christian powers to continue the war against the Ottomans. He and Venice also wanted to involve the Great Horde in the anti-Ottoman coalition, but the Poles were unwilling to allow the Tatars to cross their territories. To strengthen his international position, Stephen signed a new treaty with Poland on 22 January 1479, promising to personally swear fealty to Casimir IV in Colomea (now Kolomyia in Ukraine) if the king specifically demanded it. Venice and the Ottoman Empire made peace in the same month; Hungary and Poland in April. After Basarab the Younger paid homage to the sultan, Stephen had to seek reconciliation with the Ottomans. In May 1480, he promised to renew the annual tribute that he had stopped paying in 1473. Taking advantage of the peace, Stephen made preparations to a new confrontation with the Ottoman Empire. He again invaded Wallachia and replaced Basarab the Younger with one Mircea, possibly Stephen&#x27;s own son, but Basarab regained Wallachia with Ottoman support. The Wallachians and their Ottoman allies broke into Moldavia in the spring of 1481.

=== Wars with Bayezid II ===

Mehmed II died in 1481. The conflict between his two sons, Bayezid II and Cem, enabled Stephen to break into Wallachia and the Ottoman Empire in June. He routed Basarab the Younger at Râmnicu Vâlcea and placed Vlad Țepeș&#x27;s half-brother, Vlad Călugărul (Vlad the Monk), on the throne. After Basarab the Younger returned with Ottoman support, Stephen made a last attempt to secure his influence in Wallachia. He again led his army to Wallachia and defeated Basarab the Younger, who died in the battle. Although Vlad Călugărul was restored, he was soon forced to accept the Sultan&#x27;s suzerainty. Anticipating a new Ottoman attack, Stephen fortified his frontier with Wallachia and entered an alliance with Ivan III of Russia, Grand Prince of Moscow.

Matthias Corvinus signed a five-year truce with Bayezid II in October 1483. The truce applied to all Moldavia, with the exception of the ports. Bayezid invaded Moldavia and captured Chilia on 14 or 15 July 1484. His vassal, Meñli I Giray, also broke into Moldavia and seized Cetatea Albă on 3 August. The capture of the two ports secured the Ottomans&#x27; control of the Black Sea. Bayezid left Moldavia only after Stephen personally came to pay homage to him. Although this prostration was largely without effect on Moldavian independence, the loss of Chilia and Cetatea Albă put an end to the Moldavian control of important trading routes.

Corvinus was unwilling to break his own truce with Bayezid, having tacit Ottoman backing for his own war in the west. However, he granted his vassal a territorial gift in Transylvania, comprising the domains of Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă. According to various interpretations, this exchange occurred in or after 1484, and was meant to compensate Stephen for the loss of his ports. Medievalist Marius Diaconescu dates the lease of Cetatea to 1482, when Corvinus agreed to give Stephen a place of refuge, should Moldavia fall to the Ottomans, while Ciceu only became Stephen&#x27;s castle in 1489. Both citadels were on land confiscated after conflicts between the Three Nations and Corvinus. Ciceu had been a fief of the Losonczi family, under litigation, while Cetatea had been a special domain of the Voivode of Transylvania, whose last titular owner before Stephen was John Pongrác of Dengeleg.

By then, war between the Poles and the Ottomans was in preparation, with clashes between the two sides occurring in 1484. Historian Șerban Papacostea notes that Casimir IV had always remained neutral during Stephen&#x27;s conflicts with the Ottomans, but the Ottoman control of the mouths of the Dnieper and the Danube threatened Poland. The king, Papacostea argues, also wanted to strengthen his suzerainty over Moldavia, which helped him decide to intervene in the conflict on Stephen&#x27;s behalf. Casimir formed or joined with an anti-Ottoman league, which, in 1485, had also gathered reluctant support from the Teutonic Knights. Historians provide different readings of the issue: according to Robert Nisbet Bain, Casimir&#x27;s intervention also drove the Ottomans out of Moldavia; Veniamin Ciobanu however argues that the Polish involvement remained non-military, purely diplomatic.

Casimir then marched on Colomea with 20,000 troops. To secure his support, Stephen also went to Colomea and swore fealty to him on 12 September 1485. The ceremony took place in a tent, but its curtains were drawn aside at the moment when Stephen was on his knees before Casimir. Three days after Stephen&#x27;s oath of fealty, Casimir IV pledged that he would not acknowledge the capture of Chilia and Cetatea Albă by the Ottomans without Stephen&#x27;s consent. During Stephen&#x27;s visit in Poland, the Ottomans broke into Moldavia and sacked Suceava. They also tried to place a pretender, Peter Hronoda, on the throne.

Stephen returned from Poland and defeated the invaders with Polish assistance at Cătlăbuga Lake in November. He again confronted the Ottomans at Șcheia in March 1486, but could not recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă. He narrowly escaped with his life, reportedly after being helped by the Aprod Purice, whom tradition identifies as patriarch of the Movilești family. Historian Vasile Mărculeț agrees with Ottoman sources in noting that Șcheia was not a military victory for Moldavia, but overall a relative success for his enemy, Skender Pasha. Moldavians reported winning the day only because they narrowly avoided disaster; and because Hronoda, recognized a voivode by dissenting boyars, was captured and beheaded. In the end, Stephen signed a three-year truce with the Porte, promising to pay the yearly tribute to the Sultan.

=== Conflicts with Poland ===

Researcher V. J. Parry argues that, because the Poles were continuously harassed by the Great Horde, they were in no position to help Stephen. Eventually, in late 1486, Poland announced plans of actually starting a &quot;crusade&quot; against the Ottomans, to be led by John Albert; Stephen approached the Sejm to negotiate Moldavia&#x27;s role in the affair. He kept out, with the expedition being rerouted from Lviv, then attacking the Tatars. Poland concluded a peace treaty with the Ottoman Empire in 1489, acknowledging the loss of Chilia and Cetatea Albă, without Stephen&#x27;s consent. Although the treaty confirmed Moldavia&#x27;s frontiers, Stephen regarded it as a breach of his 1485 agreement with Casimir IV. Instead of accepting the treaty, he acknowledged the suzerainty of Matthias Corvinus. However, Corvinus died unexpectedly on 6 April 1490. Four candidates laid claim to Hungary, including Maximilian of Habsburg, and Casimir IV&#x27;s two sons, John Albert and Vladislaus.

Stephen supported Maximilian of Habsburg, who urged the Three Nations of Transylvania to cooperate with Stephen against his opponents. Most Hungarian lords and prelates, however, supported Vladislaus who was crowned king on 21 September, forcing Maximilian to withdraw from Hungary in November. For John Albert (who was his father&#x27;s heir in Poland) did not abandon his claim, Stephen decided to support Vladislaus in order to prevent a personal union between Hungary and Poland. He broke into Poland and captured Pocuția (now Pokuttya in Ukraine). He believed that he was entitled to this former Moldavian fief, its revenue redirected toward paying the Ottoman tribute. Stephen also supported Vladislaus against the Ottomans who broke into Hungary several times after Corvinus&#x27; death. In exchange, Vladislaus confirmed Stephen&#x27;s claim to Ciceu and Cetatea de Baltă in Transylvania. John Albert, in turn, was forced to acknowledge his brother as the lawful king in late 1491.

Casimir IV died on 7 June 1492. One of his younger sons, Alexander, succeeded him in Lithuania, and John Albert was elected king of Poland in late August. Ivan III of Moscow broke into Lithuania to expand his authority over the principalities along the borderlands. During the following years, Ivan and Stephen coordinated their diplomacy, which enabled Ivan to persuade Alexander to acknowledge the loss of significant territories to Moscow in February 1494.

Ottoman pressure also brought about a rapprochement between Hungary and Poland. Vladislaus met his four brothers, including John Albert and Sigismund, in Lőcse (now Levoča in Slovakia) in April 1494. They planned a crusade against the Ottoman Empire. However, John Albert wanted to strengthen Polish suzerainty over Moldavia and to dethrone Stephen in favour of Sigismund, which gave rise to new tensions between Poland and Hungary. Shortly after the conference, John Albert decided to launch a campaign against the Ottomans to recapture Chilia and Cetatea Albă. Fearing that the subjugation of Moldavia was John Albert&#x27;s actual purpose, Stephen made several attempts to prevent his campaign. With Ivan III&#x27;s support, he persuaded Alexander of Lithuania not to associate himself with John Albert. As reported by the &quot;Bychowiec Chronicle&quot;, the Lithuanian magnates also condemned the war, and simply refused to cross the Southern Bug.

For its part, the Polish army marched across the Dniester into Moldavia in August 1497. The Sultan sent 500 or 600 Janissaries to Moldavia at Stephen&#x27;s request, joining the Moldavian forces gathered at Roman. Stephen sent his chancellor, Isaac, to John Albert, requesting the withdrawal of Polish forces from Moldavia, but John Albert had Isaac imprisoned. The Poles then laid siege to Suceava on 24 September. The campaign failed: Teutonic reinforcements never arrived, with Johann von Tiefen dying on the way. Before long, a plague broke out in the Polish camp, while Vladislaus of Hungary sent an army of 12,000 strong to Moldavia, forcing John Albert to lift the siege on 19 October.

The Poles started to march towards Poland, but Stephen ambushed and routed them at a ravine in Bukovina on 25 and 26 October. Several raids into Poland during the following months, including the sacking of Lviv, Yavoriv, and Przemyśl, cemented his victory. These were either ordered and directed by Stephen, or carried out through a combined force of Ottoman–Tatar–Moldavian irregulars commanded by Malkoçoğlu. Stephen made peace with John Albert only after Poland and Hungary concluded a new alliance against the Ottoman Empire, and Moldavia received direct access to Lviv&#x27;s markets. Meanwhile, the Ottoman campaign ended in disaster, as a heavy winter induced famine; various Polish and Lithuanian reports also suggest that Stephen ordered false flag attacks against his panicking former allies.

=== Last years ===

From about 1498, power in Moldavia quietly shifted toward a group of boyars and administrators, comprising, among others, Luca Arbore and Ioan Tăutu. Stephen&#x27;s son and co-ruler, Bogdan, was also taking on princely responsibilities from his father. He conducted the negotiations with Poland about a peace treaty. The treaty, which Stephen ratified at Hârlău in 1499, put an end to Polish suzerainty over Moldavia. Stephen again stopped paying tribute to the Ottomans in 1500, although by then his health had declined. In February 1501, his delegation arrived in Venice, asking for a specialist doctor. As reported by Marin Sanudo, his envoys also discussed the possibility of Moldavia and Hungary joining the Ottoman–Venetian War. The Doge of Venice, Agostino Barbarigo, sent a physician, Matteo Muriano, to Moldavia to treat his counterpart.

Stephen&#x27;s armies again broke into the Ottoman Empire, but they could not recapture Chilia or Cetatea Albă. The Tatars of the Great Horde invaded southern Moldavia, but Stephen defeated them with the support of the Crimean Tatars in 1502. He also sent reinforcements to Hungary to fight against the Ottomans. By then, however, the treaty with Poland was no longer enforced, prompting Stephen to recapture Pocuția in 1502. Although Alexander of Lithuania was by then the new King of Poland, no understanding could be reached between him and Stephen, and the two became enemies. At around that time, Luca Arbore, acting either as Stephen&#x27;s envoy or on his own, stated a Moldavian claim to Halych and other towns of the Ruthenian Voivodeship. Hungary and the Ottoman Empire concluded a new peace treaty on 22 February 1503, which also included Moldavia. Thereafter Stephen again paid a yearly tribute to the Ottomans.
Stephen survived his doctor, who died in Moldavia in late 1503. Another Moldavian delegation was sent to Venice to ask for a replacement, but also to propose a new alliance against the Ottomans. This was one of his last acts of international diplomacy. When Stephen was dying, various boyars, who opposed Bogdan, rebelled, but they were suppressed. On his deathbed, he had urged Bogdan to continue to pay the tribute to the Sultan. He died on 2 July 1504 and was buried in the Monastery of Putna.

== Family ==

A woman named Mărușca (or Mărica) most probably gave birth to Stephen&#x27;s first recognized son, Alexandru. Historian Ioan-Aurel Pop describes Mărușca as Stephen&#x27;s first wife, but other researchers note that the legitimacy of the Stephen–Mărușca marriage is uncertain. According to Jonathan Eagles, Alexandru either died in childhood or survived infancy and became his father&#x27;s co-ruler. This older Alexandru died in July 1496, not before marrying a daughter of Bartolomeu Dragfi, the Transylvanian Voivode. He is probably not the same Alexandru who, in 1486, was sent by Stephen as a voluntary hostage to Istanbul, where he married a Byzantine noblewoman. This Alexandru was still alive by the end of his father&#x27;s rule and beyond, when he became a pretender to the throne, and ultimately a contested prince. A 1538 letter by Fabio Mignanelli describes the surviving Alexandru, or &quot;Sandrin&quot;, as a posthumous son of Stephen, but this is likely an error.

If Stephen fathered two or three sons named Alexandru, the one who was for a while his designated successor was born to Evdochia of Kiev, whom Stephen married in 1463. An Olelkovich, she was closely related both to Ivan III of Moscow and to Casimir IV of Poland and Lithuania. Stephen&#x27;s charter of grant to the Hilandar Monastery on Mount Athos refers to two children of Stephen and Evdochia, Alexandru and Olena. Olena was the wife of Ivan Molodoy, the eldest son of Ivan III, and mother of the usurped heir Dmitry.

Stephen&#x27;s second (or third) wife, Maria of Mangup, was of the family of the Princes of Theodoro. She was probably also cousins with the Muscovite Grand Princess Sophia Palaiologina and was related to Trebizond&#x27;s royal couple, Emperor David and Empress Maria. The Stephen–Maria marriage took place in September 1472, but she died in December 1477. During her brief stay in Moldavia, Maria supported the Latin Patriarchate of Constantinople, contributing to the friendly contacts between Stephen and Catholic powers. Stephen&#x27;s third (or fourth) wife, Maria Voichița, was the daughter of Radu the Fair, Voivode of Wallachia. She was the mother of Stephen&#x27;s immediate successor, Bogdan, and a daughter named . The latter married into the House of Sanguszko. Stephen is known to have fathered two other sons who died in childhood, at a time when he was married to Maria Voichița: Bogdan died in 1479, and Peter (Petrașco) in 1480. Scholars are divided as to whether their mother was Evdochia, Maria of Mangup, or a very young Maria Voichița. Bogdan was also known as &quot;Vlad&quot;—a regal name rarely used in Moldavia, but common for Wallachian princes. The choice was either &quot;an underlining of the Moldo–Wallachian unity which Prince Stephen had sought to achieve&quot;, or, more precisely but less certainly, a proof that Stephen wished to make Bogdan-Vlad his co-ruler over Wallachia. Archivist Aurelian Sacerdoțeanu believes that Bogdan-Vlad also had a twin, Iliaș.

In 1480, Stephen finally recognized his first-born, Mircea, born from his 1450s affair with Călțuna of Brăila, and groomed him to take the throne in Wallachia. According to Sacerdoțeanu, recognition came only after the death of Mircea&#x27;s legal father, who may have been one of the boyars spared at Soci. Stephen also fathered another illegitimate son, Petru Rareș, who became prince of Moldavia in 1527. The church regards his mother, Maria Rareș, as Stephen&#x27;s fourth wife, although she is known to have been married to a burgher. Stephen V &quot;Locust&quot;, who held the Moldavian throne in 1538–1540, also presented himself as Stephen&#x27;s illegitimate son. According to Sacerdoțeanu, his claim is credible. A local tradition in Putna County (today&#x27;s Vrancea) attributes to Stephen other extra-conjugal affairs, with many peasants reporting that they consider themselves &quot;of his blood&quot; or &quot;of his marrow&quot;.

== Legacy ==

=== Stability and violence ===

Stephen reigned for more than 47 years, which was &quot;in itself an outstanding achievement in the context of the political and territorial fragility of the Romanian principalities&quot;. His diplomacy evidenced that he was one of the &quot;most astute politicians&quot; of Europe in the 15th century. This skill enabled him to play off the Ottoman Empire, Poland and Hungary against each other. According to historian Keith Hitchins, Stephen &quot;paid tribute to the Ottomans, but only when it was advantageous...; he did homage to King Casimir of Poland as his suzerain when that seemed wise ...; and he resorted to arms when other means failed.&quot;

Stephen suppressed the rebellious boyars and strengthened central government, often applying cruel punishments, including impalement. He consolidated the practice of slavery, including the notion that different laws applied to slaves, reportedly capturing as many as 17,000 Roma during his invasion of Wallachia, but also selectively freeing and assimilating Tatar slaves. He supposedly used both communities as &quot;slaves of the court&quot;, treasuring their specialized skills; nevertheless, one folk legend additionally claims that Stephen practiced human sacrifice against Roma slaves, to alleviate the floods at Sulița. According to Marcin Bielski, during the 1498 expedition to Poland, the voivode participated in, or at least tolerated, the capture of as many as 100,000 people. At least some of these were colonized in Moldavia, where, according to various reports of the period, they founded &quot;Ruthenian&quot; undefended towns. According to historian Mircea Ciubotaru, these may include Cernauca (now Chornivka in Ukraine), Dobrovăț, Lipnic, Ruși-Ciutea, and a cluster of villages outside Hârlău.

Stephen also welcomed freemen as settlers, establishing some of the first Armenian colonies in Moldavia, including one at Suceava, while also settling Italians, some of whom were escapees from the Ottoman slave trade, in that city. Early on, he renewed the commercial privileges of Transylvanian Saxons who traded in Moldavia, but subsequently introduced some protectionist barriers. His own court was staffed with foreign experts, among them Matteo Muriano and the Italian banker Dorino Cattaneo. However, as a &quot;crusader&quot; in the 1470s, Stephen encouraged the religious persecution and extortion of Gregorian Armenians, Jews, and Hussites, some of whom became supporters of the Ottoman Empire.

In addition to his colonization policies, Stephen restored Crown lands that had been lost during the civil war that followed Alexander the Good&#x27;s rule, either through buying or confiscating them. On the other hand, he granted much landed property to the Church and to the lesser noblemen who were the main supporters of the central government. His itinerant lifestyle enabled him to personally hold court in the whole of Moldavia, which contributed to the development of his authority.

When talking with Muriano in 1502, Stephen mentioned that he had fought 36 battles, only losing two of them. When the enemy forces mostly outnumbered his army, Stephen had to adopt the tactics of &quot;asymmetric warfare&quot;. He practised guerilla warfare against invaders, avoiding challenging them to open battle before they were weakened due to the lack of supplies or sickness. During his invasions, however, he moved quickly and forced his enemies to do battle. To strengthen the defence of his country, he restored the fortresses built during Alexander the Good&#x27;s rule at Hotin, Chilia, Cetatea Albă, Suceava and Târgu Neamț. He also erected a number of castles, including the new fortresses at Roman and Tighina. The &quot;pârcălabi&quot; (or commanders) of the fortresses were invested with administrative and judicial powers and became important pillars of royal administration, their work controlled by a new central office, the &quot;armaș&quot; (first attested in 1489). The &quot;pârcălabi&quot; included members of the princely family, such as Duma, who was Stephen&#x27;s cousin; before his execution, Isaia, the voivode&#x27;s brother-in-law, had supervised Chilia and Neamț Citadel.

Stephen hired mercenaries to man his forts, which diminished the military role of the boyars&#x27; retinues within the Moldavian military forces. He also set up a personal guard 3,000 strong and, at least for a while, an Armenian-only unit. To strengthen the defence of Moldavia, he obliged the peasantry to bear arms. Moldavian chronicles recorded that if &quot;he found a peasant lacking arrows, bow or sword, or coming to the army without spurs for the horse, he mercilessly put that man to death&quot;. The military reforms increased Moldavia&#x27;s military potential, enabling Stephen to muster an army of more than 40,000 strong.

=== Cultural development ===

The years following Stephen&#x27;s wars against the Ottoman Empire have been described as the era of &quot;cultural policies&quot; and &quot;great architectural upsurge&quot;. More than a dozen stone churches were erected at Stephen&#x27;s initiative after 1487. The wealthiest boyars followed him, and Stephen also supported the development of monastic communities. For instance, the Voroneț Monastery was built in 1488 and the monastery at Tazlău in 1496 to 1497.

The style of the new churches evidences that a &quot;genuine school of local architects&quot; developed during Stephen&#x27;s reign. They borrowed components of Byzantine and Gothic architecture and mixed it with elements of local tradition. Painted walls and towers with a base forming a star were the most featuring elements of Stephen&#x27;s churches. The prince also financed the building of churches in Transylvania and Wallachia, which contributed to the spread of Moldavian architecture beyond the boundaries of the principality. Stephen commissioned votive paintings and carved tomb stones for many of his ancestors&#x27; and other relatives&#x27; graves. The tomb room of the Putna Monastery was built to be the royal necropolis of Stephen&#x27;s family. Stephen&#x27;s own tombstone was decorated with acanthus leaves (a motif adopted from Byzantine art) which became the featuring decorative element of Moldavian art during the following century.

Stephen also contributed to the development of historiography and Church Slavonic literature in Moldavia. He ordered the collection of the annals of the principality and initiated the completion of at least three Slavonic chronicles, noted in particular for doing away with the conventions of Byzantine literature, and for introducing new storytelling canons. Some portions of these historiographic texts were corrected, and perhaps even dictated, by Stephen himself. The &quot;Chronicle of Bistrița&quot;, which was allegedly the oldest chronicle, narrated the history of Moldavia from 1359 to 1506. The two versions of the &quot;Chronicle of Putna&quot; covered the period from 1359 to 1526, but it also wrote of the history of the Putna Monastery. They were accompanied by a large number of lay and religious texts (including the Gospels, in several versions by Teodor Mărișescul; as well as commentary on the Nomocanon and Slavonic translations from John Climacus). Some were richly decorated with miniatures, such as portraits of Stephen (in the Humor Monastery &quot;Gospel&quot;, 1473) and his courtier Ioan Tăutu (&quot;Psalter&quot; of Mukachevo, 1498). The &quot;Moldavian style&quot;, developed at Neamț Monastery by the disciples of Gavriil Uric, became influential outside Moldavia, creating a fashion among Russian illustrators and calligraphers.

=== National hero ===

Stephen received the sobriquet &quot;Great&quot; shortly after his death. Sigismund I of Poland and Lithuania referred to him as &quot;that great Stephen&quot; in 1534. The Polish historian Martin Kromer mentioned him as the &quot;great prince of the Moldavians.&quot; According to Maciej Stryjkowski, by 1580 the Wallachians and Moldavians alike sang ballads honoring Stephen, whose portrait was displayed at the court of Bucharest; his raids in Wallachia were generally overlooked in such testimonials. Despite being honored for his skill, he was still primarily known under sobriquets indicating his standing and age: in 16th-century Moldavia and Wallachia, he was casually known as &quot;Ștefan cel Vechi&quot; and &quot;Ștefan cel Bătrân&quot; (&quot;Stephen the Ancient&quot; or &quot;the Old&quot;). Oral history also maintained Stephen&#x27;s Byzantine self-references, often calling him an &quot;emperor&quot; or a &quot;&quot;crai&quot; (king) of the Moldavians&quot;.

In the mid-17th-century, Grigore Ureche described Stephen as &quot;a benefactor and a leader&quot; when writing of his funeral. A boyar by birth, Ureche also mentioned Stephen&#x27;s despotic cruelty, bad temper, and diminutive stature — possibly because, according to scholar Lucian Boia, he resented authoritarian princes. In tandem, local folklore came to regard Stephen as a protector of peasantry against noblemen and foreign invaders. For centuries, free peasants claimed that they inherited their landed property from their ancestors to whom it had been granted by Stephen for their bravery in the battles.

Such precedents also made Stephen a cult figure in Romanian nationalism, which sought the union of Moldavia with Wallachia, and in rival Moldovenism. Early in the 19th century, the Moldavian regionalist Gheorghe Asachi made Stephen the topic of historical fiction, popular prints, and heraldic reconstructions. Asachi, and later Teodor Balș, also campaigned for the erection of a Stephen the Great statue, which was supposed to represent resistance against Wallachian encroachment. The Moldavian separatist Nicolae Istrati wrote several theatrical works which contributed to the Stephen cult. Other Moldavians, shunning separatism, paid their own homage to the medieval hero. In the 1840s, Alecu Russo inaugurated the effort to collect and republish folklore about Stephen, which he believed was the &quot;source of truth&quot; about Romanian history. One of the first epic poems to deal with the voivode was &quot;The Aprod Purice&quot;, by Constantin Negruzzi, which fictionalizes the battle of Șcheia. In the Bessarabia Governorate, which had been carved out of Moldavia by the Russian Empire, the peasantry and intellectual class both appealed to Stephen as a symbol of resistance. His &quot;golden century&quot; was a reference for Alexandru Hâjdeu and Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu. The latter dedicated him a large number of works, from poems written in his native Russian to Romanian-language historical novels in which Stephen is a leading protagonist.

By then, the cult of Stephen&#x27;s &quot;patriotic virtues&quot; had been introduced to Wallachia by Ienăchiță Văcărescu and Gheorghe Lazăr. Wallachian scholar Nicolae Bălcescu was the first Romanian historian to describe Stephen as a national hero; his rule, Bălcescu argued, was an important step towards the unification of the lands inhabited by Romanians. During that period, Stephen became explicitly mentioned in the Romantic poetry of Andrei Mureșanu, in particular as the &quot;mighty shadow&quot; described in Romania&#x27;s future national anthem. In 1850s Wallachia, Dimitrie Bolintineanu produced a lukewarm ballad depicting Stephen fleeing for battle, and his mother Oltea ordering him back. It became a hugely popular after being set to music. His later works also contribute to the nationalist cult, or fictionalize his erotic life. The nationalist investment in Stephen was by then resisted by other writers, in particular George Panu, Ioan Bogdan, and other &quot;Junimea&quot; members, who favored a critique of Romantic nationalism. In Panu&#x27;s works, Stephen appears as merely a &quot;Polish vassal&quot;; the one-time &quot;Junimist&quot; A. D. Xenopol also chided the voivode for his loss of Chilia and his supposed betrayal of Wallachia.

Anniversaries of the most important events of Stephen&#x27;s life have been officially celebrated since the 1870s, including in 1871 the defiant show of solidarity at Putna. This doubled as a protest against Austria-Hungary, which had annexed Bukovina; it was organized by Teodor V. Ștefanelli and was notably attended by poet Mihai Eminescu. Nationalist interpretations still prevailed, particularly after 1881, when Eminescu dedicated his poem &quot;Doina&quot; (written in the style of traditional Romanian song) to Stephen, calling upon him to leave his grave to again lead his people. His statue was ultimately raised in Iași in 1883.

On the 400th anniversary of the voivode&#x27;s death in 1904, ceremonies included the completion of a stone monument in Bârsești, by locals who claimed descent from Vrâncioaia. Also then, Nicolae Iorga published Stephen&#x27;s biography. Against Xenopol&#x27;s verdict, Iorga emphasized that Stephen&#x27;s victories were to be attributed to the &quot;true unity of the whole people&quot; during his reign. Many more works of literature appeared in the Kingdom of Romania and other Romanian-inhabited regions, helping to consolidate Stephen&#x27;s cultural legacy. One such contribution was the 1909 play &quot;Apus de soare&quot;, by Barbu Ștefănescu Delavrancea, including advice attributed, in the public&#x27;s mind, to historical Stephen:
Depicting Stephen as a dying sage, it was followed by two other Delavrancea plays, which insisted on the prince&#x27;s pragmatic cruelty and the effects this had on his succession. By then, Stephen as a statesman had also become a point of reference and a benchmark for the long and stabilizing rule of Carol I, King of Romania. Over the following three decades, Stephen&#x27;s deeds became the inspiration for literary works by Iorga, Mihai Codreanu, and especially Mihail Sadoveanu. In the 1930s, the Iron Guard embraced Stephen the Great&#x27;s cult for its own purposes, with special emphasis on his contribution as a Christian monarch.

The reading of Stephen as a pan-Romanian nationalist peaked during the late stages of Communist Romania. Initially, the regime looked down on Stephen&#x27;s treatment of the peasantry, and only emphasized his connections with the East Slavs or his clampdown against boyardom. This stance was overturned by national communism. Initially, censorship toned down or removed references to his legacy in Soviet Bessarabia or Pokuttya; in the 1980s, however, official historians claimed that Stephen was literally a &quot;lord of all Romanians&quot;. Iorga&#x27;s book has been republished several times, including on the 500th anniversary of Stephen&#x27;s death. On the same anniversary, Stephen was presented as a symbol of &quot;national identity, independence and inter-ethnic harmony&quot; in the Republic of Moldova, where he also endures as the symbol of &quot;Moldavian particularism&quot; or &quot;Moldovan patriotism&quot;. Thus, Stephen was invoked by both the Popular Front of Moldova, which favored Romanian identity, and the Moldovenist Party of Communists. The latter describes Stephen as &quot;the founder of Moldavian statehood&quot;, claiming direct continuity from his principality to the present-day state.

As Eagles notes, &quot;Stephen is an ever-present icon&quot; in both Romania and Moldova: &quot;statues of his image abound; politicians cite him as an exemplar; schools and a university bears his name; villages and the main thoroughfares of towns and cities are named after him; there is a Ștefan cel Mare metro station in central Bucharest; and his crowned head has adorned &quot;every&quot; banknote in the post-Soviet Moldovan republic&quot;. According to a 1999 opinion poll, more than 13% of the participants regarded Stephen the Great as the most important personality who had &quot;influenced the destiny of the Romanians for the better&quot;. Seven years later, during a programme called the &quot;100 Greatest Romanians&quot; on Romanian Television, he was voted &quot;the greatest Romanian of all time&quot;.

=== Holy ruler ===
In Athonite legends, Romanian stories, and Moldavian chronicles alike, Stephen&#x27;s victories against the Ottomans and Hungarians were already regarded as God-inspired, or as placed under the direct patronage of various saints (George, Demetrius, Procopius, or Mercurius). Veneration of Stephen himself was first recorded in the 1570s, but, according to Ureche, he had been regarded as a saint soon after his funeral: &quot;not on account of his soul ... for he was a man with sins ... but on account of the great deeds he accomplished&quot;. The positive nuances of Ureche&#x27;s report were also repeated by Miron Costin.

The abbot of Putna Monastery, Artimon Bortnic, initiated the investigation of the tomb room of the monastery in 1851, referring to important shrines in Russia and Moldavia. In 1857 (a year after Stephen&#x27;s tomb was opened), the priest and journalist Iraclie Porumbescu already wrote of the &quot;holy bones of Putna&quot;. In at least some legends attested by 1903, the voivode is depicted as an immortal sleeping hero, or, alternatively, as the ruler of heaven. However, Stephen the Great was ignored when the Romanian Orthodox Church canonized the first Romanian saints in the 1950s.

Teoctist, Patriarch of All Romania, canonized Stephen along with 12 other saints at Saint Spyridon the New Church in Bucharest on 21 June 1992. On this occasion, the patriarch emphasized that Stephen had been a defender of Christianity and protector of his people. He also underlined that Stephen had built churches during his reign. Stephen&#x27;s feast day is 2 July (the day of his death) in the calendar of the Romanian Orthodox Church. On his first feast after his canonization, a new ceremony was held to celebrate Stephen the Great and Saint in Putna. 15,000 people (including the President of Romania at the time, Ion Iliescu, and two ministers) attended the event. Patriarch Teoctist noted that &quot;God has brought us together under the same skies, just as Stephen rallied us under the same flag in the past.&quot;

==Arms==
Stephen&#x27;s rule consolidated the usage of the coat of arms of Moldavia, featuring the aurochs head (first attested in 1387), sometimes as a helmet atop his personal arms. He revived the elaborate design introduced under Alexander the Good, which also featured a rose, crescent, sun and star (often, but not always, five-pointed); its tinctures remain unknown. This arrangement was not familiar to heraldists in Western Europe. By the 1530s, they represented Moldavia with attributed arms featuring Maures; these arms, though originally used for Wallachia, possibly echoed Stephen&#x27;s victories over the Ottomans.

The personal arms and heraldic flags used by Stephen have been the topic of additional scrutiny and debate. Stephen is known to have used a &quot;party per cross&quot; shield with one striped quarter, but the colors are uncertain: one prevailing interpretation is that the dominant tinctures were or and vert, although they may also have been gules and argent. These may derive from the colors used by the House of Basarab (which were possibly used by Stephen&#x27;s in-law Radu the Handsome), from the coat of arms of Hungary, or from a purely Moldavian tradition. The division and the striped pattern are possibly Hungarian; they survived in some of Stephen&#x27;s seals even during his dispute with the Hungarian crown. He also continued to use the &quot;fleur-de-lis&quot;, an Angevin symbol, but altered it into a &quot;double-headed lily&quot;, then renounced it altogether. Similarly, he used the Cross of Lorraine, pattée, possibly in reference to the Pahonia. Following his 1489 dispute with Poland, that charge was altered into a double cross fleury.

Stephen&#x27;s heraldic symbols progressively merged with those attributed to the House of Mușat, and were intensively used by all princes who claimed full or partial descent from Alexander the Good—including Peter the Lame, a Wallachian pretender to Moldavia&#x27;s throne. The Putna tombstones of Stephen&#x27;s two sons who died during his lifetime, Bogdan and Peter, already display the aurochs within the &quot;Mușat coat-of-arms&quot;.

A Moldavian banner also survives in hand-colored versions illustrating Johannes de Thurocz&#x27;s &quot;Chronica Hungarorum&quot;, with varying tinctures. These were first identified as Stephen&#x27;s flags by Constantin Karadja, and described by later authors as a version of the or-an-vert scheme in the coat of arms. Other clues suggest that the field was a solid one of or, charged with an aurochs of or, but also that the preferred &quot;single Moldavian&quot; color was gules. Gules is also the color of Stephen&#x27;s alleged war flag, defaced with an icon of Saint George and the Dragon and donated by the prince himself to Zograf monastery. However, scholar Petre Ș. Năsturel cautions that this may not be a heraldic object of any kind, but rather a votive offering. The &quot;war flag&quot;, he notes, is too small to carry in battle, and does not match with images in either Thurocz or Marcin Bielski, nor with the description in Alexander Guagnini.

<doc id="264209" wikidata="Q255063" url="?curid=264209" title="Superuser">
<text>In computing, the superuser is a special user account used for system administration. Depending on the operating system (OS), the actual name of this account might be root, administrator, admin or supervisor. In some cases, the actual name of the account is not the determining factor; on Unix-like systems, for example, the user with a user identifier (UID) of zero is the superuser [i.e., uid=0], regardless of the name of that account; and in systems which implement a role-based security model, any user with the role of superuser (or its synonyms) can carry out all actions of the superuser account.
The principle of least privilege recommends that most users and applications run under an ordinary account to perform their work, as a superuser account is capable of making unrestricted, potentially adverse, system-wide changes.

==Unix and Unix-like==
In Unix-like computer OSes (such as Linux), &quot;root&quot; is the conventional name of the user who has all rights or permissions (to all files and programs) in all modes (single- or multi-user). Alternative names include &quot;baron&quot; in BeOS and &quot;avatar&quot; on some Unix variants. BSD often provides a &quot;toor&quot; (&quot;root&quot; written backward) account in addition to a root account. Regardless of the name, the superuser always has a user ID of 0. The root user can do many things an ordinary user cannot, such as changing the ownership of files and binding to network ports numbered below 1024.

The name &quot;root&quot; may have originated because &quot;root&quot; is the only user account with permission to modify the root directory of a Unix system. This directory was originally considered to be root&#x27;s home directory, but the UNIX Filesystem Hierarchy Standard now recommends that root&#x27;s home be at .&quot;&quot; The first process bootstrapped in a Unix-like system, usually called , runs with root privileges. It spawns all other processes directly or indirectly, which inherit their parents&#x27; privileges. Only a process running as root is allowed to change its user ID to that of another user; once it has done so, there is no way back. Doing so is sometimes called &quot;dropping root privileges&quot; and is often done as a security measure to limit the damage from possible contamination of the process. Another case is and other programs that ask users for credentials and in case of successful authentication allow them to run programs with privileges of their accounts.

It is often recommended that &quot;root&quot; is never used as a normal user account, since simple typographical errors in entering commands can cause major damage to the system. Instead, a normal user account should be used, and then either the (substitute user) or (substitute user do) command is used. The approach requires the user to know the root password, while the method requires that the user be set up with the power to run &quot;as root&quot; within the file, typically indirectly by being made a member of the &quot;wheel&quot;, &quot;adm&quot;, &quot;admin&quot;, or &quot;sudo&quot; group.

For a number of reasons, the approach is now generally preferred – for example it leaves an audit trail of who has used the command and what administrative operations they performed.

Some OSes, such as macOS and some Linux distributions (most notably Ubuntu), automatically give the initial user created the ability to run as root via – but this is configured to ask them for their password before doing administrative actions. In some cases the actual &quot;root&quot; account is disabled by default, so it can&#x27;t be directly used. In mobile platform-oriented OSs such as Apple iOS and Android, superuser access is inaccessible by design, but generally the security system can be exploited in order to obtain it. In a few systems, such as Plan 9, there is no superuser at all.

==Microsoft Windows==
In Windows NT and later systems derived from it (such as Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003, and Windows Vista/7/8/10/11), there must be at least one administrator account (Windows XP and earlier) or one able to elevate privileges to superuser (Windows Vista/7/8/10/11 via User Account Control). In Windows XP and earlier systems, there is a built-in administrator account that remains hidden when a user administrator-equivalent account exists. This built-in administrator account is created with a blank password. This poses security risks as local users would be able to access the computer via the built-in administrator account if the password is left blank, so the account is disabled by default in Windows Vista and later systems due to the introduction of User Account Control (UAC). Remote users are unable to access the built-in administrator account.

A Windows administrator account is not an exact analogue of the Unix root account – Administrator, the built-in administrator account, and a user administrator account have the same level of privileges. The default user account created in Windows systems is an administrator account. Unlike macOS, Linux, and Windows Vista/7/8/10 administrator accounts, administrator accounts in Windows systems without UAC do not insulate the system from most of the pitfalls of full root access. One of these pitfalls includes decreased resilience to malware infections. To avoid this and maintain optimal system security on pre-UAC Windows systems, it is recommended to simply authenticate when necessary from a standard user account, either via a password set to the built-in administrator account, or another administrator account.

In Windows Vista/7/8/10/11 administrator accounts, a prompt will appear to authenticate running a process with elevated privileges. Usually, no user credentials are required to authenticate the UAC prompt in administrator accounts but authenticating the UAC prompt requires entering the username and password of an administrator in standard user accounts. In Windows XP (and earlier systems) administrator accounts, authentication is not required to run a process with elevated privileges. This poses a security risk that led to the development of UAC. Users can set a process to run with elevated privileges from standard accounts by setting the process to &quot;run as administrator&quot; or using the command and authenticating the prompt with credentials (username and password) of an administrator account. Much of the benefit of authenticating from a standard account is negated if the administrator account&#x27;s credentials being used has a blank password (as in the built-in administrator account in Windows XP and earlier systems), hence why it is recommended to set a password for the built-in administrator account.

In Windows NT, 2000 and higher, the root user is the Administrator account.

==Novell NetWare==
In Novell NetWare, the superuser was called &quot;supervisor&quot;, later &quot;admin&quot;.

==OpenVMS==
In OpenVMS, &quot;SYSTEM&quot; is the superuser account for the OS.

==Older personal systems==
On many older OSes on computers intended for personal and home use, anyone using the system had full privileges. Many such systems, such as DOS, did not have the concept of multiple accounts, and although others such as Windows 95 did allow multiple accounts, this was only so that each could have its own preferences profile – all users still had full administrative control over the machine.

<doc id="264210" wikidata="Q214604" url="?curid=264210" title="Zero of a function">
<text>In mathematics, a zero (also sometimes called a root) of a real-, complex-, or generally vector-valued function formula_1, is a member formula_2 of the domain of formula_1 such that formula_4 &quot;vanishes&quot; at formula_2; that is, the function formula_1 attains the value of 0 at formula_2, or equivalently, formula_2 is a solution to the equation formula_9. A &quot;zero&quot; of a function is thus an input value that produces an output of 0.

A root of a polynomial is a zero of the corresponding polynomial function. The fundamental theorem of algebra shows that any non-zero polynomial has a number of roots at most equal to its degree, and that the number of roots and the degree are equal when one considers the complex roots (or more generally, the roots in an algebraically closed extension) counted with their multiplicities. For example, the polynomial formula_1 of degree two, defined by formula_11 has the two roots (or zeros) that are 2 and 3.
formula_12

If the function maps real numbers to real numbers, then its zeros are the formula_2-coordinates of the points where its graph meets the &quot;x&quot;-axis. An alternative name for such a point formula_14 in this context is an formula_2-intercept.

==Solution of an equation==
Every equation in the unknown formula_2 may be rewritten as

:formula_17

by regrouping all the terms in the left-hand side. It follows that the solutions of such an equation are exactly the zeros of the function formula_1. In other words, a &quot;zero of a function&quot; is precisely a &quot;solution of the equation obtained by equating the function to 0&quot;, and the study of zeros of functions is exactly the same as the study of solutions of equations.

== Polynomial roots ==

Every real polynomial of odd degree has an odd number of real roots (counting multiplicities); likewise, a real polynomial of even degree must have an even number of real roots. Consequently, real odd polynomials must have at least one real root (because the smallest odd whole number is 1), whereas even polynomials may have none. This principle can be proven by reference to the intermediate value theorem: since polynomial functions are continuous, the function value must cross zero, in the process of changing from negative to positive or vice versa (which always happens for odd functions).

===Fundamental theorem of algebra===

The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial of degree formula_19 has formula_19 complex roots, counted with their multiplicities. The non-real roots of polynomials with real coefficients come in conjugate pairs. Vieta&#x27;s formulas relate the coefficients of a polynomial to sums and products of its roots.

== Computing roots ==

There are many methods for computing accurate approximations of roots of functions, the best being Newton&#x27;s method, see Root-finding algorithm. 

For polynomials, there are specialized algorithms that are more efficient and may provide all roots or all real roots; see Polynomial root-finding and Real-root isolation.

Some polynomial, including all those of degree no greater than 4, can have all their roots expressed algebraically in terms of their coefficients; see Solution in radicals.

==Zero set==

In various areas of mathematics, the zero set of a function is the set of all its zeros. More precisely, if formula_21 is a real-valued function (or, more generally, a function taking values in some additive group), its zero set is formula_22, the inverse image of formula_23 in formula_24. 

Under the same hypothesis on the codomain of the function, a level set of a function formula_1 is the zero set of the function formula_26 for some formula_27 in the codomain of formula_28

The zero set of a linear map is also known as its kernel.

The cozero set of the function formula_21 is the complement of the zero set of formula_1 (i.e., the subset of formula_24 on which formula_1 is nonzero). 

=== Applications ===
In algebraic geometry, the first definition of an algebraic variety is through zero sets. Specifically, an affine algebraic set is the intersection of the zero sets of several polynomials, in a polynomial ring formula_33 over a field. In this context, a zero set is sometimes called a &quot;zero locus&quot;.

In analysis and geometry, any closed subset of formula_34 is the zero set of a smooth function defined on all of formula_34. This extends to any smooth manifold as a corollary of paracompactness. 

In differential geometry, zero sets are frequently used to define manifolds. An important special case is the case that formula_1 is a smooth function from formula_37 to formula_34. If zero is a regular value of formula_1, then the zero set of formula_1 is a smooth manifold of dimension formula_41 by the regular value theorem.

For example, the unit formula_42-sphere in formula_43 is the zero set of the real-valued function formula_44.

<text>A root (also known as a root word or radical) is the core of a word that is irreducible into more meaningful elements. In morphology, a root is a morphologically simple unit which can be left bare or to which a prefix or a suffix can attach. The root word is the primary lexical unit of a word, and of a word family (this root is then called the base word), which carries aspects of semantic content and cannot be reduced into smaller constituents.
Content words in nearly all languages contain, and may consist only of, root morphemes. However, sometimes the term &quot;root&quot; is also used to describe the word without its inflectional endings, but with its lexical endings in place. For example, &quot;chatters&quot; has the inflectional root or lemma &quot;chatter&quot;, but the lexical root &quot;chat&quot;. Inflectional roots are often called stems. A root, or a root morpheme, in the stricter sense, a mono-morphemic stem.

The traditional definition allows roots to be either free morphemes or bound morphemes. Root morphemes are the building blocks for affixation and compounds. However, in polysynthetic languages with very high levels of inflectional morphology, the term &quot;root&quot; is generally synonymous with &quot;free morpheme&quot;. Many languages have a very restricted number of morphemes that can stand alone as a word: Yup&#x27;ik, for instance, has no more than two thousand.

The root is conventionally indicated using the mathematical symbol √; for instance, the Sanskrit root &quot; means the root &quot;.

==Examples==
English verb form &quot;running&quot; contains the root &quot;run&quot;. The Spanish superlative adjective &quot;amplísimo&quot; contains the root &quot;ampli-&quot;. In the former case, the root can occur on its own freely. In the latter, modification via affixation is required to be used as a free form. English has minimal use of morphological strategies such as affixation and features a tendency to have words that are identical to their roots. However, such forms as in Spanish exist in English such as &quot;interrupt&quot;, which may arguably contain the root &quot;-rupt&quot;, which only appears in other related prefixed forms (such as &quot;disrupt&quot;, &quot;corrupt&quot;, &quot;rupture&quot;, etc.). The form &quot;-rupt&quot; cannot occur on its own.

Examples of (consonantal roots) which are related but distinct to the concept developed here are formed prototypically by three (as few as two and as many as five) consonants. Speakers may derive and develop new words (morphosyntactically distinct, i.e. with different parts of speech) by using non-concatenative morphological strategies: inserting different vowels. Unlike &#x27;root&#x27; here, these cannot occur on their own without modification; as such these are never actually observed in speech and may be termed &#x27;abstract&#x27;. For example, in Hebrew, the forms derived from the abstract consonantal roots, a major Hebrew phonetics concept ג-ד-ל (g-d-l) related to ideas of largeness: gadol and gdola&quot; (masculine and feminine forms of the adjective &quot;big&quot;), gadal &quot;he grew&quot;, &quot;higdil &quot;he magnified&quot; and &quot;magdelet&quot; &quot;magnifier&quot;, along with many other words such as godel &quot;size&quot; and &quot;migdal&quot; &quot;tower&quot;.

Roots and reconstructed roots can become the tools of etymology.

==Secondary roots==

Secondary roots are roots with changes in them, producing a new word with a slightly different meaning. In English, a rough equivalent would be to see a &quot;conductor&quot; as a secondary root formed from the root &quot;to conduct&quot;. In abjad languages, the most familiar are Arabic and Hebrew, in which families of secondary roots are fundamental to the language, secondary roots are created by changes in the roots&#x27; vowels, by adding or removing the long vowels &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;. (Notice that Arabic does not have the vowels &quot;e&quot; and &quot;o&quot;.) In addition, secondary roots can be created by prefixing (&quot;m−&quot;, &quot;t−&quot;), infixing (&quot;−t−&quot;), or suffixing (&quot;−i&quot;, and several others). There is no rule in these languages on how many secondary roots can be derived from a single root; some roots have few, but others have many, not all of which are necessarily in current use.

Consider the Arabic language:
* مركز [mrkz] or [markaza] meaning &#x27;centralized (masculine, singular)&#x27;, from [markaz] &#x27;centre&#x27;, from [rakaza] &#x27;plant into the earth, stick up (a lance)&#x27; ( ر-ك-ز | r-k-z). This in turn has derived words [markaziy], meaning &#x27;central&#x27;, [markaziy:ah], meaning &#x27;centralism&#x27; or &#x27;centralization&#x27;, and , [la:markaziy:ah] &#x27;decentralization&#x27;
* أرجح [rjh] or [ta&#x27;arjaħa] meaning &#x27;oscillated (masculine, singular)&#x27;, from [&#x27;urju:ħa] &#x27;swing (n)&#x27;, from [rajaħa] &#x27;weighed down, preponderated (masculine, singular)&#x27; ( ر-ج-ح | r-j-ħ).
* محور [mhwr] or [tamaħwara] meaning &#x27;centred, focused (masculine, singular)&#x27;, from [mihwar] meaning &#x27;axis&#x27;, from [ħa:ra] &#x27;turned (masculine, singular)&#x27; (ح-و-ر | h-w-r).
* مسخر [msxr], تمسخر [tamasxara] meaning &#x27;mocked, made fun (masculine, singular)&#x27;, from مسخرة [masxara] meaning &#x27;mockery&#x27;, from سخر [saxira] &#x27;mocked (masculine, singular)&#x27; (derived from س-خ-ر[s-x-r]).&quot; Similar cases may be found in other Semitic languages such as Hebrew, Syriac, Aramaic, Maltese language and to a lesser extent Amharic.

Similar cases occur in Hebrew, for example Israeli Hebrew √m-q-m &#x27;locate&#x27;, which derives from Biblical Hebrew &quot;måqom&quot; &#x27;place&#x27;, whose root is √q-w-m &#x27;stand&#x27;. A recent example introduced by the Academy of the Hebrew Language is &quot;midrúg&quot; &#x27;rating&#x27;, from &quot;midrág&quot;, whose root is √d-r-g &#x27;grade&#x27;.&quot;

According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, &quot;this process is morphologically similar to the production of frequentative (iterative) verbs in Latin, for example:
* &quot;iactito&quot; &#x27;to toss about&#x27; derives from &quot;iacto&quot; &#x27;to boast of, keep bringing up, harass, disturb, throw, cast, fling away&#x27;, which in turn derives from &quot;iacio&quot; &#x27;to throw, cast&#x27; (from its past participle &quot;iactum&quot;).

Consider also Rabbinic Hebrew √t-r-m &#x27;donate, contribute&#x27; (Mishnah: T&#x27;rumoth 1:2: &#x27;separate priestly dues&#x27;), which derives from Biblical Hebrew &quot;t&#x27;rūmå&quot; &#x27;contribution&#x27;, whose root is √r-w-m &#x27;raise&#x27;; cf. Rabbinic Hebrew √t-r-&#x27; &#x27;sound the trumpet, blow the horn&#x27;, from Biblical Hebrew &quot;t&#x27;rū&#x27;å&quot; &#x27;shout, cry, loud sound, trumpet-call&#x27;, in turn from √r-w-&#x27;.&quot;
and it describes the suffix.

== Category-neutral roots ==
Decompositional generative frameworks suggest that roots hold little grammatical information and can be considered &quot;category-neutral&quot;. Category-neutral roots are roots without any inherent lexical category but with some conceptual content that becomes evident depending on the syntactic environment. The ways in which these roots gain lexical category are discussed in Distributed Morphology and the Exoskeletal Model.

Theories adopting a category-neutral approach have not, as of 2020, reached a consensus about whether these roots contain a semantic type but no argument structure, neither semantic type nor argument structure, or both semantic type and argument structure.

In support of the category-neutral approach, data from English indicates that the same underlying root appears as a noun and a verb - with or without overt morphology.
In Hebrew, the majority of roots consist of segmental consonants √CCC. Arad (2003) describes that the consonantal root is turned into a word due to pattern morphology. Thereby, the root is turned into a verb when put into a verbal environment where the head bears the &quot;v&quot; feature (the pattern).

Consider the root √š-m-n (ש-מ-נ).
Although all words vary semantically, the general meaning of a greasy, fatty material can be attributed to the root.

Furthermore, Arad states that there are two types of languages in terms of root interpretation. In languages like English, the root is assigned one interpretation whereas in languages like Hebrew, the root can form multiple interpretations depending on its environment. This occurrence suggests a difference in language acquisition between these two languages. English speakers would need to learn two roots in order to understand two different words whereas Hebrew speakers would learn one root for two or more words.

Alexiadou and Lohndal (2017) advance the claim that languages have a typological scale when it comes to roots and their meanings and state that Greek lies in between Hebrew and English.

<text>Sheremetyevo International Airport (, Internal code: ШРМ) is one of four international airports that serve the city of Moscow. It is the busiest airport in Russia, as well as the 11th-busiest airport in Europe. Originally built as a military airbase, Sheremetyevo was converted into a civilian airport in 1959. The airport was originally named after a nearby village, and a 2019 contest extended the name to include the name of the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin.

The airport comprises six terminals: four international terminals (one under construction), one domestic terminal, and one private aviation terminal. It is located northwest of central Moscow, between the towns of Lobnya and Khimki in Moscow Oblast.

In 2019, the airport handled about 49.9 million passengers. Sheremetyevo serves as the main hub for Russian flag carrier Aeroflot as well as its subsidiaries Rossiya Airlines and Pobeda, for Nordwind Airlines and its subsidiary Ikar, and for Smartavia.

==History==

=== Soviet era ===
The airport was initially built as a military airfield called Sheremetyevsky (), named after a village of the same name, as well as the nearby railway station of the same name. The decree for the construction of the Central Airdrome of the Air Force near the settlement of Chashnikovo on the outskirts of Moscow was issued on 1 September 1953 by the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union. The airport became operational on 7 November 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution.

In August 1959, the Council of Ministers made a decree to terminate the airbase&#x27;s use for military purposes, where it would be handed over to the Principal Directorate of the Civil Air Fleet to be converted into a civilian airport. Sheremetyevo&#x27;s civilian purposes started on 11 August 1959 when a Tupolev Tu-104B landed at the airport from Leningrad.
The first international flight took place on 1 June 1960 to Berlin Schönefeld Airport using an Ilyushin Il-18. Sheremetyevo was officially opened on the day after, where a two-story terminal occupying was commissioned. On 3 September 1964, the Sheremetyevo-1 terminal was opened. Of that year, 18 foreign airlines had regular flights to Sheremetyevo, with up to 10 different types of aircraft involved. By the end of 1964, Sheremetyevo handled 822,000 passengers and 23,000 tons of mail and cargo, including 245,000 passengers and 12,000 tons of cargo that were transported internationally. Soon, by the end of 1965, a majority of international flights to the USSR was achieved through Sheremetyevo thanks to Aeroflot&#x27;s air traffic agreements with 47 countries.

In the early 1970s, a second runway was constructed at Sheremetyevo, with the first airliner to land being an Ilyushin Il-62. In preparation for the 1980 Summer Olympics, construction of a second terminal for Sheremetyevo, Sheremetyevo-2, was approved by the Ministry of Civil Aviation in early 1976. Construction of Sheremetyevo-2 started on 17 November 1977.

On 1 January 1980, Sheremetyevo-2 was put into operation, with a capacity to serve an annual 6 million passengers, or 2,100 passengers per hour. Despite this, its official opening ceremony was held much later, on 6 May 1980. During the Olympics, Sheremetyevo served more than 460,000 international passengers.

=== Contemporary era ===
On 11 November 1991, Sheremetyevo International Airport received its legal status as a state-owned enterprise, amidst the dissolution of the Soviet Union. On 9 July 1996, Sheremetyevo became an open joint-stock company. In 1997, the airport renovated one of its runways with a thick concrete surface.

In the early 2000s, Sheremetyevo saw growing competition from the rapidly expanding Moscow Domodedovo Airport, which was more modern and convenient to access, and the neighbouring Vnukovo Airport. Sheremetyevo saw 24 of its airlines, notably domestic airlines such as Sibir, KrasAir, Transaero, Pulkovo Airlines, and UTAir, as well as international airlines Air Malta, Adria Airlines, Swiss, British Airways, and Emirates, move their services to Domodedovo. As a result, Aeroflot pushed for a third terminal for the airport, Sheremetyevo-3, to increase the airport&#x27;s passenger capacity as well as be able to fulfill its requirements to join Skyteam.

In the late 2000s, Sheremetyevo oversaw rapid planning and expansion of the airport. On 12 March 2007, the airport opened Terminal C to maximise the airport&#x27;s international passenger capacity. On 5 March 2008, the airport renovated its second runway to receive all types of aircraft, including the Airbus A380 and the Boeing 787 Dreamliner. An Aeroexpress line was constructed between Sheremetyevo and Savyolovsky Railway Station on 10 June 2008, quickening traveling time from the airport to central Moscow in 30 minutes. In January 2009, Sheremetyevo finalised a master plan where it would increase passenger capacity to an annual 64 million per year and build a second airfield with a third runway. On 15 November 2009, construction of Terminal D was completed, with a total surface area of , an annual capacity of 12 million passengers, and operation being putting forth in the beginning of next year. Sheremetyevo-2 was renamed Terminal F on 25 December 2009 with terminal identification using international (Latin) lettering.
Expansion of Sheremetyevo continued into 2010. Sheremetyevo-1 was renamed Terminal B on 28 March. Terminal E was opened on 30 April, connecting Terminal D and Terminal F and increasing the airport&#x27;s capacity to 35 million passengers per year. In June, construction started for Terminal A, a private aviation terminal. In July, a walkway opened between Terminals D, E, F, and the Aeroexpress railway terminal on the public access side. In November, a walkway opened between Terminals D, E, and F on the security side. Both of have simplified transfer between transit flights. Ultimately, after the northern the recent construction work, the airport now has the capacity to receive more than 40 million passengers annually.

On 28 March 2011, a separate airfield that would serve as Sheremetyevo&#x27;s third runway was approved. On 13 December 2011, the Federal Agency for State Property Management approved an agreement that merged the airport operators OAO Terminal (operator of Terminal D) and OJSC Sheremetyevo, consolidating control of the airport under one entity. On 26 December 2011, a new area control centre (ACC) was opened for Sheremetyevo, consolidating operations of the airport&#x27;s different control centres to increase efficiency. The situational centre was also created as part of the ACC for joint work of top-managers, heads of state bodies, and partners of Sheremetyevo to resolve emergencies.

=== Continued expansion ===
On 30 December 2013, TPS Avia successfully won a competitive tender to develop Sheremetyevo International Airport&#x27;s northern area, including a new passenger terminal, a new freight terminal, a refuelling area and a tunnel linking the passenger terminal to three other terminals.

Terminal B, previously Sheremetyevo-1, was demolished in August 2015 to be reconstructed as a newer and more modern terminal, which began in October 2015. By the end of 2015, Sheremetyevo surpassed its competitor Domodedovo as Russia&#x27;s busiest airport, serving 31.28 million passengers, compared to Domodedovo&#x27;s 30.05 million. This trend continued in 2016, where Sheremetyevo saw growth while Vnukovo and Domodedovo showed losses in passengers. A growing number of airlines launched new operations to Sheremetyevo, such as Tianjin Airlines, Tunisair, Nouvelair, and Air Malta, which back in the 2000s moved its operation to Domodedovo.

In February 2016, TPS Avia combined its assets with Sheremetyevo Airport and committed to invest US$840 million to upgrade and expand the airport&#x27;s infrastructure – as a result TPS Avia secured a 68% stake in Sheremetyevo Airport. Part of the plan includes demolishing Terminal C for a newer reconstruction of the terminal, which came to effect on 1 April 2017. Sheremetyevo International Airport was the official airport of the 2018 FIFA World Cup. Sheremetyevo completed re-construction of its first northern terminal, Terminal B, in May 2018, to handle more passengers for the tournament. In 2018, the Airport reported revenues of €194.9 million, a 6% increase year over year. Profit increased 7.4% year over year. These increases are attributed in part to increased air traffic due to the 2018 FIFA World Cup.

In late 2018, SVO enacted a series of changes to its flight traffic. Aeroflot subsidiary Rossiya Airlines announced the transfer of its flights from Vnukovo to Sheremetyevo starting 28 October 2018. British Airways also launched direct flights from London Heathrow to Sheremetyevo on the same day. Syria-based Cham Wings Airlines began direct flights from Damascus to SVO in November 2018 as well. In December 2018, following the results of the Great Names of Russia contest, Sheremetyevo was named after the great Russian poet Alexander Pushkin. The ceremony took place on 5 June 2019, which was the 220th anniversary of Pushkin&#x27;s birth year. The airport is now officially named Sheremetyevo Alexander S. Pushkin International Airport.

In 2019, the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB) began testing an automated passport control system at SVO. This system relies on biometric data and foreign passport recognition to allow Russian passengers to move through border control with fewer movement restrictions. If successful, the FSB may implement this system in other Russian airports.

== Fraud ==

OCCRP reports that the airport has been used for laundering money. It purchased fuel from a broad network of middlemen between 2003 and 2008, which greatly increased the price. Court records show that just in 2006 and 2007, phantom corporations made at least $200 million in pointless markups. The scam cost the Russian government approximately 1 billion rubles ($40 million) in missing tax income. The cost of fuel increased, which also increased the cost of airline tickets for the general people.

==Terminals==

Sheremetyevo International Airport has four operating passenger terminals and one special terminal reserved for the use of private and business aviation. The airport&#x27;s four passenger terminals are divided into two groups based on geographical location: the Northern Terminal Complex and the Southern Terminal Complex. The current terminal naming system was introduced in December 2009; previously, the terminals were numbered: Sheremetyevo-1 (now Terminal B), Sheremetyevo-2 (now Terminal F), and Sheremetevo-3 (now Terminal D).

=== Terminal A ===

Opened on 16 January 2012, Terminal A handles servicing of business and private aviation out of Sheremetyevo. The terminal occupies an area of and can carry an annual capacity of 75,000 passengers.

===Northern terminals===
====Terminal B====
Terminal B – originally named Sheremetyevo-1 – has two iterations.

The first iteration was constructed and opened on 3 September 1964. The terminal, as Sheremetyevo-1, was known for its &quot;flying-saucer&quot;-like design, and was nicknamed &quot;shot glass&quot; by locals. Being long and wide, as well as having a volume exceeding , the terminal can hold up to 800 people per hour. Formerly serving international flights, Sheremetyevo-1 would transition to serving domestic flights. Along with other Sheremetyevo terminals that underwent Latin lettering conventions, Sheremetyevo-1 was renamed Terminal B on 28 March 2010. Terminal B was then demolished in August 2015 to be reconstructed as a larger and more modern terminal which began in October 2015.

The new terminal B commenced its operations on 3 May 2018, with the Aeroflot&#x27;s flight to Saratov. All airlines that have domestic flights from Sheremetyevo and some flights of Aeroflot began shifting to Terminal B from Terminal D. Compared to the previous terminal B, that was demolished, new terminal will have an increased passenger capacity of 20 million passengers and will serve domestic flights only. As of November 2018, Aeroflot has consolidated all of its domestic services at Terminal B, with the exception of flights to far eastern destinations in Vladivostok, Khabarovsk and Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky. Flights to the eastern Russian shore and some short-haul (including all domestic flights served by widebodies) continue out of SVO&#x27;s Terminal D.

The terminal is connected by an interterminal underground passage with Sheremetyevo&#x27;s southern terminals and the Aeroexpress railway station.

====Terminal C====

On 12 March 2007, Sheremetyevo opened the former Terminal C for the servicing of international charter flights to maximize location convenience for all areas in the airport. Located adjacent to the former Terminal B, Terminal C served from 5 to 6 million passengers. The role of Terminal C diminished as passengers for international flights for the airport were distributed among Terminal D and Terminal E. As part of Sheremetyevo&#x27;s long-term redevelopment plan, Terminal C was closed on 1 April 2017 to be demolished for construction of a newer terminal.

Integrated with the now-reconstructed domestic Terminal B, the new Terminal C was designed to serve up to 20 million passengers.

The first section of the new Terminal C opened on 17 January 2020, with a planned capacity of 20 million passengers. It is called Terminal C1, and some international flights were transferred to that new terminal. Another part called Terminal C2 is scheduled to be opened in 2026, and will add another 10 million passengers capacity.

===Southern terminals===

====Terminal D====

Terminal D, opened in November 2009, is adjacent to Terminal F. The building is a hub for Aeroflot and its SkyTeam partners, with capacity for 12 million passengers per year. Aeroflot had been trying to implement the project of a new terminal (Sheremetyevo-3) since January 2001. However, construction only began in 2005, with commissioning of the complex finally taking place on 15 November 2009. The acquisition of its own terminal was a condition of Aeroflot&#x27;s entry into the SkyTeam airline alliance, thus necessitating the construction. The main contractor for the build was a Turkish company Enka. Terminal D has 22 jetways and 11 remote stands. On 15 November 2009 at 9:15 a.m., the first flight from Terminal D (the new official name of Sheremetyevo-3) departed for the southern resort city of Sochi. Despite this, Aeroflot took a number of months (due to unexpected administrative delays) to transfer all of its international flights from Terminal F to D (a full transfer was originally planned for February 2010). Whilst previously Terminal D had remained a separate legal entity from the rest of Sheremetyevo Airport, in spring 2012, it became an integrated unit of &quot;Sheremetyevo International Airport&quot; JSC. As part of the deal, Aeroflot, VEB Bank, and VTB Bank, all of which had invested in the construction of Terminal D, became part shareholders in the airport as a whole. The basis for the architectural and artistic image of Terminal D is that of a giant swan with outstretched wings.

There is an official multi-story parking at Terminal D connected with the main building by means of a pedestrian bridge. The parking size is about 4100 lots, however it has a relatively dense layout.

Between August 2015 and May 2018, Terminal D used to be the only terminal at Sheremetyevo that was able to serve domestic flights. Even since new Terminal B was opened and commenced its services, Terminal D continues to operate non-Aeroflot domestic flights.

On 28 October 2018, Terminal D started handling all of Rossiya Airlines&#x27; Moscow-originating domestic flights and its international service to Indonesia.

On 15 March 2022, the Terminal D was closed caused by dramatic passenger traffic decrease. On terminal was reopened. As of October 2024 it serve flights operated by Pobeda and Smartavia.

====Terminal E====
Terminal E opened in 2010 as a capacity expansion project, connecting terminals D and F. The terminal&#x27;s construction has allowed for the development of terminals D and F, as well as the railway station, into a single south terminal complex. The terminals of this complex are connected by a number of pedestrian walkways with travelators, thus allowing for passengers to move freely between its constituent facilities. In December 2010, a new chapel dedicated to St. Nicholas opened on the second floor of Terminal E. The terminal was used for international flights, primarily by Aeroflot and its SkyTeam partners. Terminal E has 8 jetway equipped gates. The V-Express Transit Hotel between security/passport check-ins provided short-term accommodations for passengers changing planes without having to present a visa for entering Russia. The hotel drew international attention in June 2013 when Edward Snowden checked into the hotel while seeking asylum.

In March 2020, Terminal E was closed due to a decrease in passenger flow and due to COVID-19 in Russia.
====Terminal F====

Opened on 6 May 1980 for Moscow&#x27;s Summer Olympics, Terminal F, previously Sheremetyevo-2, has 15 jetways and 21 remote aircraft stands. The terminal was designed to service 6 million passengers per year. Until the completion of the original Terminal C, it was the only terminal that serviced international flights. The design is a larger version of the one of Hannover–Langenhagen Airport by the same architects and constructed by Rüterbau, a company located in Hanover. All materials, except the bricks which came from Poland, and every piece of equipment, was transported from Germany to Moscow by lorry. A major reconstruction of the terminal and its interior space was completed by late 2009. For the convenience of passengers, the departures lounge and duty free zone were thoroughly modernised, whilst a number of partition walls were removed to create extra retail and lounge space.

It was announced that terminal F will be re-constructed after the construction of terminal C is completed.

On 30 December 2021, at 0:00 by Moscow Time, the terminal F was closed for reconstruction.
==== Terminal G ====
In November 2019, it was announced that a new Terminal G will also be built. Construction is planned to begin in 2024-2025.

<text>Henry Jones Ford (August 25, 1851 – August 29, 1925) was an American political scientist, journalist, university professor, and government official. He served as president of the American Political Science Association. He was appointed by Woodrow Wilson as the Banking and Insurance Commissioner of New Jersey in 1912.

== Biography ==
He was born on August 25, 1851, in Baltimore, Maryland. He graduated from Baltimore City College at the age of seventeen.

Ford worked as a managing editor and editorial writer from 1872 to 1905, at six different newspapers in three cities Baltimore, New York City, and Pittsburgh.

Later returning to Baltimore, Ford taught at Johns Hopkins University, and afterwards taught at the University of Pennsylvania. Known to say that politics was a &quot;dirty business&quot; unsuitable for women, his students at Penn included suffragist Alice Paul, whose experiences in his classes informed her decision to pursue master&#x27;s and doctoral degrees in sociology instead of politics. Ford later took a job as professor of politics at Princeton University, at the request of the university&#x27;s then-president, Woodrow Wilson.

Ford&#x27;s association with Wilson also took him also into politics. When Wilson became governor of New Jersey, he appointed Ford Commissioner of Banking and Insurance; after Wilson became president, Ford was sent to the Philippines on a special mission, reporting directly to the President, and toward the end of Wilson&#x27;s presidency, Ford was named to a position on the Interstate Commerce Commission. Their association also resulted in Ford&#x27;s book &quot;Woodrow Wilson, the Man and His Work&quot;, which was an account of Wilson&#x27;s experience on the presidential campaign trail.

Ford served as president of the American Political Science Association from 1918 to 1919.

He died on August 29, 1925, in Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania.

<doc id="264228" wikidata="Q262945" url="?curid=264228" title="Rogers Hornsby">
<text>Rogers Hornsby (April 27, 1896 – January 5, 1963), nicknamed &quot;the Rajah&quot;, was an American baseball infielder, manager, and coach who played 23 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for the St. Louis Cardinals (1915–1926, 1933), New York Giants (1927), Boston Braves (1928), Chicago Cubs (1929–1932), and St. Louis Browns (1933–1937). He was named the National League (NL)&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice, and was a member of one World Series championship team.

Born in Winters, Texas, and raised in Fort Worth, Texas, Hornsby played for several semi-professional and minor league teams. In 1915, he began his major league career with the St. Louis Cardinals and remained with the team for 12 seasons. During this period, Hornsby won his first MVP Award and the Cardinals won the 1926 World Series. After that season, he spent one season with the New York Giants and another with the Boston Braves before being traded to the Chicago Cubs. He played with the Cubs for four years and won his second MVP Award before the team released him in 1932. Hornsby re-signed with the Cardinals in 1933, but was released partway through the season, effectively ending his career as a full-time player. He was picked up by the St. Louis Browns and remained there until his final season in 1937, though he made only 67 appearances for them as a player. From 1925 to 1937, Hornsby was intermittently a player-manager. After retiring as a player, he managed the Browns in 1952 and the Cincinnati Reds from 1952 to 1953.

Hornsby is regarded as one of the best hitters of all time. He had 2,930 hits and 301 home runs in his career; his career batting average of .358 is third only to Ty Cobb, at .366, and Oscar Charleston, at .364, in MLB history. He also won two Triple Crowns and batted .400 or more three times during his career. He is the only player to hit 40 home runs and bat .400 in the same year (1922). His batting average for the 1924 season was .424, a mark that no player has matched since. In 1942, Hornsby was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. In 2014, he was inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame.

Hornsby married three times, in 1918, 1924, and 1957, and had two children. Known as someone who was difficult to get along with, he was not well-liked by his fellow players. He never smoked, drank, or went to the movies, but frequently gambled on horse races during his career.

==Early life==
Hornsby was born in Winters, Texas, the last of Ed and Mary (Rogers) Hornsby&#x27;s six children. Hornsby was two when his father died of unknown causes. Four years later, the surviving Hornsbys moved to Fort Worth, Texas, so Hornsby&#x27;s brothers could get jobs in the meat packing industry to support the family.

Hornsby started playing baseball at a very young age; he once said, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember anything that happened before I had a baseball in my hand.&quot; He took a job with the Swift and Company meat industry plant as a messenger boy when he was 10, and he also served as a substitute infielder on its baseball team. By the age of 15, Hornsby was already playing for several semi-professional teams. He also played baseball for North Side High School until 10th grade, when he dropped out to take a full-time job at Swift. While he was in high school, Hornsby also played on the football team, alongside future College Football Hall of Famer Bo McMillin.

==Professional career==
===Minor leagues===
In 1914, Hornsby&#x27;s older brother Everett, a minor league baseball player for many years, arranged for Rogers to get a tryout with the Texas League&#x27;s Dallas Steers. He made the team, but was released two weeks later without appearing in a game. He then signed with the Hugo Scouts of the Class D Texas–Oklahoma League as their shortstop for $75 per month ($ today). The team folded a third of the way through the season, and Hornsby&#x27;s contract was sold to the Denison Champions of the same league for $125 ($ today). Hornsby batted a combined .232 in 1914 and committed 45 errors in 113 games.

The Denison team changed its name to the Railroaders and joined the Western Association in 1915, and raised Hornsby&#x27;s salary to $90 per month ($ today). Hornsby&#x27;s average improved to .277 in 119 games, but he made 58 errors. Nonetheless, his contributions helped the Railroaders win the Western Association pennant. At the end of the season a writer from &quot;The Sporting News&quot; said that Hornsby was one of about a dozen Western Association players to show any major league potential.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1915–1926)===

Hornsby came to the attention of the Major League St. Louis Cardinals during an exhibition series between that team and the Railroaders in spring training in 1915. Cardinals&#x27; manager Miller Huggins told his only scout, Bob Connery, to look for minor league players to fill the roster of their financially struggling National League team. In September, the Cardinals purchased Hornsby&#x27;s contract from Denison and added him to their major league roster, although his only professional baseball experience had been in Class D. Hornsby&#x27;s first game came on September 10, when he relieved Art Butler at shortstop in a 7–1 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. Three days later he started a game, and he got his first hit the next day against Rube Marquard of the Brooklyn Robins. Hornsby finished the season with a .246 average in 57 at-bats while the Cardinals finished in sixth place in the National League (NL). At only 19 years old, Hornsby was the fourth-youngest player in the NL that year.

The Cardinals picked up Roy Corhan from the San Francisco Seals of the Pacific Coast League to play at shortstop in 1916, making Hornsby one of three candidates for the position. Hornsby&#x27;s great performance in spring training, a shoulder injury to Corhan, and poor hitting by Butler meant Hornsby was the starting shortstop on Opening Day. He had both runs batted in (RBIs) in the Cardinals&#x27; 2–1 victory over the Pittsburgh Pirates that day. On May 14, he hit his first major league home run against Jeff Pfeffer of Brooklyn. He rotated among infield positions before finally settling in at third base for much of the second half of the year. Late in the season, he missed 11 games with a sprained ankle. He finished 1916 with a .313 average, fourth in the NL, and he was one short of the league lead in triples with 15.

Hornsby returned to the shortstop position in 1917 after Corhan returned to San Francisco and Butler was released. After playing nearly every game throughout the first month of the season, Hornsby was called away from the team on May 29 after his brother William was shot and killed in a saloon. Rogers attended the funeral on June 1 and returned to the Cardinals on June 3, finishing the season without missing any more playing time. His batting statistics improved from the previous season; his .327 batting average was second in the league, and he led the league in triples (17), total bases (253), and slugging percentage (.484).

Many baseball players were drafted to fight in World War I in 1918, but Hornsby was given a draft deferment because he was supporting his family. During the offseason, Miller Huggins, unhappy with the Cardinals&#x27; management, left the team to manage the New York Yankees. He was replaced by Jack Hendricks, who had managed the Indianapolis Indians to a pennant in the American Association the previous year. Hornsby lacked confidence in Hendricks&#x27;s ability to run the Cardinals, and the two men developed animosity towards each other as a result of Hornsby&#x27;s growing egotism and fondness for former manager Huggins. Under Hendricks, Hornsby&#x27;s batting average dipped to .281. He had problems off the field too; on June 17, Hornsby hit St. Louis resident Frank G. Rowe with his Buick when Rowe stepped out in front of traffic to cross an intersection. Rowe sued Hornsby for $15,000 ($ today), but Hornsby eventually settled for a smaller, undisclosed amount, and the case was dismissed. He was still among the league leaders in triples and slugging percentage in 1918, but after the season ended with the Cardinals in last place, he announced that he would never play under Hendricks again. Partially due to Hornsby&#x27;s complaints, Hendricks was fired after the season and replaced by Branch Rickey, then president of the Cardinals.

In 1919, after the Cardinals acquired shortstop Doc Lavan, Rickey tried converting Hornsby into a second baseman in spring training. Hornsby played third base for most of the year. His batting average was low at the beginning of the season but improved by June. At season&#x27;s end, his average of .318 was second-highest in the league, and he also finished second in total bases and runs batted in.
In 1920, Rickey moved Hornsby to second base, where he remained for the rest of his career. He started the year with a 14-game hitting streak. On June 4, he had two triples and two RBIs as the Cardinals defeated the Chicago Cubs 5–1, a game that ended future Hall of Famer Grover Cleveland Alexander&#x27;s 11-game winning streak. Hornsby finished the season with the first of seven batting titles by hitting .370, and he also led the league in on-base percentage (.431), slugging percentage (.559), hits (218), total bases (329), doubles (44), and RBIs (94).

The beginning of the live-ball era led to a spike in hitting productivity throughout the majors, which helped Hornsby to hit with increased power during the 1921 season. He hit .397 in 1921, and his 21 home runs were second in the league, more than twice his total in any previous season. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.458), slugging percentage (.639), runs scored (131), RBIs (126), doubles (44), and triples (18). The Cardinals held a special day in Hornsby&#x27;s honor on September 30 before a home game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, and they presented Hornsby with multiple awards before the game, including a baseball autographed by President of the United States Warren G. Harding. The Cardinals beat the Pirates 12–4 that day as Hornsby hit a home run and had two doubles.

By the 1922 season, Hornsby was considered a big star, having led the league in batting average, hits, doubles, and runs batted in multiple times. As a result, he sought a three-year contract for $25,000 per season. After negotiating with Cardinals management he settled for three years at $18,500 ($ today), which made him the highest-paid player in league history to that point. On August 5, Hornsby set a new NL record when he hit his 28th home run of the season, off Jimmy Ring of the Philadelphia Phillies. From August 13 through September 19, he had a 33-game hitting streak. Hornsby set National League records in 1922 with 42 home runs, 250 hits and a .722 slugging percentage (still the highest ever for players with 600+ at-bats). His .401 batting average was the highest in the National League since 1897. He won the first of his two Triple Crowns that year, and he led the league in RBIs (152), on-base percentage (.459), doubles (46), and runs scored (141). His 450 total bases in 1922 remain the National League single-season record. On defense, Hornsby led all second basemen in putouts, double plays, and fielding percentage.
On May 8, 1923, Hornsby suffered an injury to his left knee in a game against the Phillies when he turned to make a throw. He returned 10 days later, but the injury lingered, and he was removed from a game against the Pirates on May 26 to be examined by Robert Hyland, the Cardinals&#x27; physician. Hyland had Hornsby&#x27;s knee placed in a cast for two weeks, after which he returned to the Cardinals. During a game in August, Hornsby was on third base late in the game and threw up his hands in disgust in response to a sign flashed by Rickey; he had given the current batter the take sign, and Hornsby felt the batter should have hit the ball. After the game, he and Rickey fought in the clubhouse, but teammates quickly broke it up. Hornsby missed several games late in the year with injuries that the Cardinals (and Hyland) did not believe to be serious; as a result he was fined $500 ($ today) and suspended for the last five games of the year. However, Hornsby still won his fourth consecutive NL batting title with a batting average of .384. He also repeated as the leader in on-base percentage (.459) and slugging percentage (.627).

Hornsby raised his average to .424 in 1924, which is the fourth-highest batting average in a single season in MLB history, and the live-ball era batting average record. He led the league with 89 walks, producing a .507 on-base percentage, a National League record for over 75 years. His slugging percentage of .696 again led the league, as did his 121 runs scored, 227 hits, and 43 doubles; he hit 25 home runs as well. That year, the NL reintroduced its Most Valuable Player (MVP) award. Although Hornsby was expected to win the award, it went to Dazzy Vance instead. Cincinnati voter Jack Ryder left Hornsby&#x27;s name off his ballot altogether because he believed Hornsby was an MVP on the stat sheet, but was not a team player. In 1962, the Baseball Writers&#x27; Association of America presented Hornsby with an award retroactively recognizing him as the 1924 MVP.

In 1925, Sam Breadon, the owner of the Cardinals, wished to replace Rickey as manager. Hornsby initially declined the job. After discovering that Rickey planned to sell his stock in the Cardinals if he was replaced as field manager, Hornsby agreed to take the job as long as Breadon would help him purchase the stock. Breadon agreed, and Hornsby became the Cardinals&#x27; player-manager. Hornsby finished the year with his second Triple Crown, when he combined a .403 batting average with 39 home runs and 143 RBIs in 138 games. He bested teammate Jim Bottomley in the batting title race by nearly 40 points. His 1925 batting average has not been matched by any National Leaguer since. That year, he won the MVP Award, receiving 73 out of 80 possible votes. His .756 slugging percentage and 1.245 on-base plus slugging set National League records that stood until broken by Barry Bonds in 2001. The Cardinals finished in fourth place in 1925, finishing one game over .500, though the team won 64 games and lost 51 under Hornsby. During the year, his wife Jeanette had a son, Billy.

Hornsby had an off-year offensively in 1926, as he hit only .317 with 11 home runs. Nonetheless, St. Louis won its first NL pennant. In the 1926 World Series, the Cardinals defeated the Yankees in a seven-game series. The final out of game seven came when Hornsby tagged out Babe Ruth on a stolen base attempt, giving the Cardinals their first World Series title. It would also be the only time in Hornsby&#x27;s long career that he would be part of a world champion. In the series, Hornsby batted .250, with one extra base hit and 4 RBIs. Years later, Hornsby said that his tag of Ruth was the biggest thrill of his career.

During post-season negotiations for a new contract, Hornsby demanded $50,000 per year for three years. Breadon agreed to a one-year contract for $50,000 ($ today), with the stipulation that Hornsby stay away from the track. When Hornsby refused to give way, the Cardinals traded him to the New York Giants for Frankie Frisch and Jimmy Ring on December 20, 1926. Indeed, Breadon had lost patience with Hornsby, even though he had led the Cardinals to their first undisputed world title. He had already arranged to send him to New York if contract talks fell through; later, Breadon said he so wanted to part ways with Hornsby that he was afraid Hornsby would call his bluff and take the one-year deal. The trade was briefly postponed as NL president John Heydler stated that Hornsby could not play for the Giants while he held stock in the Cardinals. Hornsby wanted $105 per share for his stock, a price Breadon was unwilling to pay. In early 1927, Hornsby was able to sell his shares at $105 each, enabling him to officially become a Giant.

===New York Giants (1927)===
Hornsby enjoyed a better season in 1927, as he hit .361 and led the league in runs scored (133), walks (86), and on-base percentage (.448). He was a player-coach, and served as acting manager for part of the year after John McGraw briefly stood down due to sinusitis. Hornsby&#x27;s performance helped guide the Giants to a 92–62 win–loss record during the season, which was good enough for third place in the NL. McGraw was initially overjoyed to finally get Hornsby, having sought to trade for him at least as early as 1920. However, their relationship quickly soured due to Hornsby&#x27;s overbearing personality. Additionally, his gambling problems at the race track and distrust of Giants&#x27; management annoyed team owner Charles Stoneham. During the offseason he was traded to the Boston Braves for Jimmy Welsh and Shanty Hogan.

===Boston Braves (1928)===

With the Boston Braves in 1928, Hornsby was again the league&#x27;s most productive hitter; he won his seventh batting title with a .387 average, also leading the league in on-base percentage (.498), slugging percentage (.632), and walks (107). One month into the season, manager Jack Slattery resigned, and the Braves hired Hornsby to be his replacement. The Braves, however, lost 103 games and finished in seventh place out of eight teams in the NL. They were also struggling financially, and when the Chicago Cubs offered $200,000 ($ today) and five players for Hornsby, the Braves found the offer too good to pass up. Indeed, Hornsby was well aware of the Braves&#x27; financial struggles and actually encouraged Braves owner Emil Fuchs to trade him to Chicago.

===Chicago Cubs (1929–1932)===
Hornsby hit .380 for Chicago in 1929 while recording 39 home runs and a league-leading .679 slugging percentage. His 156 runs scored led the major leagues and is still the team record while his .380 batting average remains the highest for a Cub since 1895. He also collected another MVP award, and the Cubs won the NL pennant. However, they lost in the 1929 World Series to the Philadelphia Athletics in five games, as Hornsby batted .238 with one RBI. He also set a World Series record for strikeouts with eight.

After the first two months of the 1930 season, Hornsby was batting .325 with two home runs. In the first game of a doubleheader against the Cardinals, Hornsby broke his ankle while advancing to third base. He did not return until August 19, and he was used mostly as a pinch-hitter for the rest of the season. With four games to go in the season, the Cubs fired manager Joe McCarthy, replacing him with Hornsby. Although there were longstanding rumors Hornsby had actively undermined McCarthy, Hornsby adamantly denied this; in fact, he and McCarthy were very close friends. Hornsby finished the year with a .308 batting average and two home runs.

On April 24, 1931, Hornsby hit three home runs and drove in eight runs in a 10–6 victory over Pittsburgh. Hornsby played in 44 of the first 48 games, but after a disappointing performance he played himself only about half the time for the rest of the year. In 100 games, he had 90 RBIs, 37 doubles, and a batting average of .331. He also led the league in on-base percentage (.421) for the ninth time in his career. The team finished 84–70, 17 games back of the pennant-winning Cardinals, and four games back of the Giants.

Hornsby was bothered by boils on his feet during the start of the 1932 season, which kept him out of the lineup until May 29. Hornsby played right field from May 29 to June 10, appeared in two games as a pinch hitter, played third base from July 14 through July 18, and played one last game as a Cub when he pinch-hit on July 31.

Cubs president William Veeck Sr. had never liked the idea of Hornsby as a manager; indeed, he briefly resigned when principal owner William Wrigley, Jr. ousted McCarthy in his favor. Over the next year-and-a-half, Veeck grew increasingly dissatisfied with Hornsby, believing his autocratic managing style hurt team morale. Veeck was particularly angered when Hornsby disagreed with an umpire&#x27;s call, but sent another player out to argue the call. That player was ejected from the game. Veeck believed Hornsby breached an unwritten rule of baseball which called for the manager to argue calls himself. On August 2, although the Cubs were in second place, Veeck fired Hornsby as manager and released him as a player. First baseman Charlie Grimm took over as manager for the rest of the season. Hornsby had played 19 games, batting .224 with one home run and seven RBIs. Although the Cubs advanced to the 1932 World Series, the players voted not to give Hornsby a share of money from the World Series.

===St. Louis Cardinals (1933)===
Hornsby did not play for the rest of 1932, but the Cardinals signed him as a player on October 24 for the 1933 season. Breadon put aside his previous disputes with Hornsby and brought him back to St. Louis, knowing that Hornsby could still handle a bat. He played regularly at second base from April 25 through May 5 in what would be his last non-cameo appearances as a player. After May 5, the Cardinals used him mostly as a pinch hitter due to numerous foot and leg problems. On July 22, Hornsby got his final NL hit in a 9–5 loss to the Braves. Through July 23, Hornsby was batting .325 with two home runs and 21 RBIs. However, that day, the Cardinals waived him. By this time, the Cardinals were in fifth place and long out of the pennant race, and Breadon was concerned that Hornsby was no longer able to play regularly.

===St. Louis Browns (1933–1937)===
Hornsby was claimed by the last-place St. Louis Browns of the American League on July 26. The Browns immediately named him player-manager; Bill Killefer had just resigned as manager, and Browns owner Phil Ball wanted Hornsby as a replacement. It would be one of Ball&#x27;s last acts before his death in October. Hornsby appeared in 11 games for the Browns. He had three hits, including a home run, in nine at-bats. The Browns finished in last place in the AL. That year, Hornsby began operating a baseball school in Hot Springs, Arkansas, which he ran on and off between 1933 and 1951 with various associates. He played in a total of 57 games in 1933.

In 1934, Hornsby appeared in 24 games, but started only two of them–one at third base, and the other in right field. In all of his other appearances, he was a pinch hitter. For the season, he batted .304 with one home run and 11 RBIs. The Browns improved on their previous season, finishing in sixth place out of eight teams in the AL.

Hornsby played in 10 games in the 1935 season, starting in four. From April 16 through April 21, he started at first base, and he started at third base on May 22. He finished the year with five hits and a .208 average, while the Browns slipped to seventh place. The regression came in part because Ball&#x27;s estate, which was running the Browns pending a sale, refused to infuse badly-needed capital into the team. The Browns had to sell promising players in order to pay the bills–a pattern that would continue throughout Hornsby&#x27;s tenure with the Browns.

Hornsby appeared in only two games with the team during the 1936 season. On May 31, his pinch-hit single in the ninth inning gave the Browns an 11–10 win over the Detroit Tigers. In his other appearance on June 9, he played first base in a 5–3 win over the Yankees. The Browns again finished in seventh place. After the season, Hornsby publicly decried his team&#x27;s lack of talent. He also claimed Ball&#x27;s estate made it difficult to enforce discipline.

In the winter of 1936, the Ball estate sold the Browns to Donald Lee Barnes, who retained Hornsby as manager on Rickey&#x27;s advice. In 1937, Hornsby played in 20 games. On April 21, in his first game of the year, Hornsby hit the final home run of his career in a 15–10 victory over the Chicago White Sox. On July 5, he had the final hit of his career in a 15–4 loss in the second game of a doubleheader with the Cleveland Indians.

On July 20, Hornsby appeared in what would be his final game, a 5–4 loss to the Yankees. A day later, the last-place Browns fired Hornsby as manager and released him as a player. Accounts differ on the circumstances that led to his ouster. According to the Society for American Baseball Research, Barnes had lost patience with Hornsby&#x27;s compulsive gambling, and fired him after learning that Hornsby was actually placing horse racing bets during a game. However, according to biographer Charles C. Alexander, Hornsby won $35,000 ($ today) from betting on a race on July 15. When he tried to use $4,000 of this money to pay off a debt to Barnes, Barnes refused to accept it, since it had come from a bookmaker. Hornsby protested to Barnes, &quot;The money is as good as the money you take from people in the loan-shark business. It&#x27;s better than taking interest from widows and orphans&quot;. Barnes released him five days later. Hornsby finished the 1937 season with a .321 batting average and 18 hits in 20 games, and was the oldest player in the AL that season.

==Later baseball career==

Following his release from the Browns, Hornsby was unable to retire because he had lost so much money gambling over the years. He signed as a player-coach with the Baltimore Orioles of the International League in 1938 before leaving them to play for and manage the Chattanooga Lookouts of the Southern Association for the rest of the season. Hornsby then returned to the Orioles to manage them for 1939, but he did not return to the club following the season.

Halfway through 1940, he signed to manage the Oklahoma City Indians of the Texas League. Hornsby led them from last place to the Texas League playoffs, where they fell to the Houston Buffaloes in four games. Hornsby began 1941 managing the Indians once again, but he resigned in the middle of the season. In November, he became the general and field manager of the Fort Worth Cats, also of the Texas league. Fort Worth finished in third place and made the playoffs in 1942, but they were eliminated in the first round by the Shreveport Sports. The league decided to suspend operations for the duration of World War II in 1943.

In February 1944, Hornsby signed as a player-manager with the Azules de Veracruz of the Mexican League for the coming season. Hornsby won two games inserting himself as a pinch hitter in the ninth inning, including one occasion in which he drove in three runs with a bases-loaded double. His tenure in Mexico ended after only nine days, however, owing to financial differences with team owner Jorge Pasquel. Hornsby announced:
I&#x27;m perfectly willing to keep my own agreements if the other fellow keeps his, but in this case it&#x27;s hopeless. I found out that I&#x27;d even have to pay my expenses on road trips, and that&#x27;s unheard of. The management finally consented to pay my expenses but there were many other matters to iron out. I finally gave up.

Hornsby indicated plans to return to Fort Worth, Texas.

Following his return to the United States, Hornsby spent 1945 out of baseball, his first campaign out of the game in over three decades. There were rumors that Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis had informally blackballed him from the majors because of his persistent gambling. However, Hornsby had a long wait to get another major-league job even after Landis died in November 1944. He did some commentary for radio station WTMV in East St. Louis, Illinois, served as a spring-training hitting instructor for the Chicago White Sox in 1946 and the Cleveland Indians in 1947, and became a TV announcer for Chicago Cubs games in 1949.

Hornsby did not become a manager or coach again until 1950, when he was hired to manage the Texas League&#x27;s Beaumont Roughnecks. He led the Roughnecks to the pennant, but they were swept in the first round of the playoffs by the San Antonio Missions. The next year, in 1951, Hornsby managed the Seattle Rainiers of the Pacific Coast League. Under Hornsby&#x27;s leadership, the Rainiers won the pennant.

===St. Louis Browns (1952)===
With Hornsby&#x27;s success in Beaumont and Seattle, both of St. Louis&#x27; major-league teams offered him three-year contracts. He decided to return to the Browns, apparently believing there was a greater upside to rebuilding a perennial loser than there was to managing a perennial contender. The Browns&#x27; owner, Bill Veeck, was the son of former Cubs president William Veeck Sr. Hornsby was not well received by the players, however. He reportedly spoke to players only to criticize them. As the season wore on and the losses piled up, Hornsby&#x27;s fuse became even shorter.

On June 9, he was fired after a disagreement with Veeck over an incident against the Yankees the day before. During the game, a fan prevented Gil McDougald of the Yankees from catching a fly ball, and the umpire ruled that it was fan interference. Hornsby did not initially argue the call, coming out of the dugout only on orders from Veeck (when it was already too late to do anything about it). This led to Hornsby and the Browns parting ways. The Browns players were so happy about Hornsby&#x27;s firing that they gave Veeck an engraved trophy to thank him.

===Cincinnati Reds (1952–1953)===
A little over a month later, on July 26, Hornsby was hired to replace Luke Sewell as manager of the Cincinnati Reds. The Reds went 27-23 for the rest of the season. However, late in a lackluster 1953 season, the Reds announced that he would not return for 1954. He resigned with eight games to go in the season; coach Buster Mills replaced him. He finished his MLB managerial career with a record of 701–812.

Following his dismissal from the Reds, Hornsby worked as a coach for the Cubs from 1958 to 1960 before becoming a scout and third base coach for the New York Mets in 1962.

==Managerial record==

==Legacy==

Baseball experts and sportswriters consider Hornsby to be one of the greatest hitters of all time. His lifetime batting average of .358 is only exceeded by Ty Cobb&#x27;s career mark of .366, and Oscar Charleston&#x27;s .364. He won seven batting titles in total, number three all-time at the time of his retirement, and a feat tied or exceeded by only five players (Cobb [11 or 12, depending on the source], Tony Gwynn [8], Honus Wagner [8], Rod Carew [7], and Stan Musial [7]). Hornsby led the National League in slugging percentage nine times, a record that still stands. He also hit more home runs, drove in more runs, and had a higher batting average than any other National League player during the 1920s, which makes him one of four players in baseball history (along with Honus Wagner, Ted Williams, and Albert Pujols) to win a decade &quot;triple crown&quot;. He hit a career total of 301 home runs and was the first player to reach 300 while playing mostly in the National League. His 264 home runs as a second baseman was a major league record for that position until Joe Morgan surpassed him in 1984. Hornsby was also a very consistent hitter whether he was playing at home or on the road. His lifetime home batting average was .359, and his lifetime away batting average was .358. Ted Williams, who had the highest career batting average since Hornsby, said that Hornsby was the greatest hitter for power and average in baseball, and Frankie Frisch said of him, &quot;He&#x27;s the only guy I know who could hit .350 in the dark.&quot; Hornsby also holds second place on the unofficial major league record list of &quot;consecutive games with two or more hits&quot; with 13 games, two behind Count Campau, a nineteenth-century player who retired in 1894. Hornsby is only the second right-handed batter in history to hit over .400 three times and is considered, according to the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, to be the greatest right-handed hitter in history. He led the National League in batting average, on-base percentage, slugging percentage, and total bases every year from 1920 to 1925.

Rogers Hornsby was so respected as a hitter that once, when a rookie pitcher complained to umpire Bill Klem that he thought he had thrown Rogers a strike, Klem replied, &quot;Son, when you pitch a strike, Mr. Hornsby will let you know.&quot;
Hornsby was also renowned for his speed, and was considered to be the fastest player in the National League in his prime. He did not try to steal very often but used his speed to take extra bases. Between 1916 and 1927 Hornsby had 30 inside-the-park home runs, and he led the league with 17 triples in 1917 and 18 triples in 1921; he had 20 triples in 1920.

Hornsby never went to movies or read books, convinced that it would harm a batter&#x27;s eyesight, and he never smoked or drank. He was notoriously difficult to get along with, a major reason he changed teams so frequently in the last decade of his career. He usually left due to falling out with the front office. Most of the players he managed did not like him due to his insistence that others follow his lifestyle, although some (like Woody English and Clint Courtney) did. As one contemporary writer put it, &quot;Hornsby knew more about baseball and less about diplomacy than any player I knew.&quot; Hornsby never played cards, but he did bet frequently on horse races, and he lost more than he won. His compulsive gambling was often a factor in his dismissal from a team; by one account, he lost at least one managerial job for placing a bet during a game. He was forced to play in the minors well into his 40s to make up for losing so much money on bets that went sour.

By most contemporary accounts, he was at least as mean and nasty as Cobb, who was known in his time for his aggressive attitude and dirty play. Notably, Hornsby&#x27;s mother died shortly before the 1926 World Series, and Hornsby decided to play instead of going to her funeral. &quot;Some thought it was heartless,&quot; wrote Fred Lieb, &quot;but it was just like Rogers Hornsby.&quot;

Hornsby was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1942. In 1999, Hornsby was ranked ninth on &quot;The Sporting News&quot; list of Baseball&#x27;s Greatest Players. Later that year, he was named to the Major League Baseball All-Century Team. In 2001, writer Bill James ranked him as the 22nd-greatest player and the third-greatest second baseman in baseball history, while at the same time documenting his unpopularity and his difficult personality. He is also tied for eighth overall with Stan Musial in wins above replacement for position players. Hornsby has also been recognized on the St. Louis Walk of Fame. In January 2014, the Cardinals announced Hornsby among 22 former players and personnel to be inducted into the St. Louis Cardinals Hall of Fame Museum for the inaugural class of 2014. The San Antonio–Austin metroplex chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research is named in honor of Hornsby.

==Personal life==
On September 23, 1918, Hornsby married Sarah Elizabeth Martin, whom he had known since he played for the Denison Railroaders, in Philadelphia. They had a son, Rogers Hornsby, Jr., on November 15, 1920. Rogers Jr. died in a plane crash on December 23, 1949, near Savannah, Georgia.

During 1922 he began seeing Jeanette Pennington Hine, who was married to an automobile-supply salesman named John Hine. On June 12, 1923, Hornsby divorced Sarah, and Hine divorced her spouse in 1923 as well; the two were married on February 28, 1924. As a result of the divorce, Sarah took custody of Rogers Jr.

Hornsby and Jeanette had a son, Billy, on June 2, 1925. Billy played baseball for several years in the minor leagues, but never reached the majors. Hornsby and Jeanette became estranged in December 1944, and Hornsby began seeing a woman named Bernadette Harris, whom he called his &quot;personal good friend and secretary&quot;, in 1945. They lived together after 1948. Harris died of suicide when she jumped out of a third-story window on September 7, 1953. Her suicide was attributed to depression. Following Jeanette&#x27;s death on June 1, 1956, Hornsby married Marjorie Bernice Frederick Porter on January 27, 1957. They remained together until Hornsby&#x27;s death. In 1963, Hornsby died of a heart attack. He was buried in Hornsby Bend Cemetery near Austin, Texas.

<doc id="264229" wikidata="Q1199087" url="?curid=264229" title="Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport">
<text>Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport , also known by its former official names Louisville International Airport and Standiford Field, is a civil-military airport in Louisville in Jefferson County, Kentucky. The airport covers and has three runways. Its IATA airport code, SDF, is based on the airport&#x27;s former name, Standiford Field. Despite being called an international airport, it has no regularly-scheduled international passenger flights, but is a port of entry, handling many UPS Airlines international cargo flights through the United Parcel Service&#x27;s worldwide air hub, often referred to as UPS Worldport.

Over 4.6 million passengers passed through the airport in 2023, while over 6.7 billion pounds (3.38 million tons) of cargo passed through in 2022. It is also the third-busiest in the United States in terms of cargo traffic, and sixth-busiest for such in the world. The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized it as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport since it has over 10,000 passenger boardings (enplanements) per year. Federal Aviation Administration records show the airport had 2,402,517 revenue enplanements in 2024.

Because of UPS Airlines&#x27; operations, Louisville International Airport is the third-busiest cargo airport in the United States, only falling short of the Ted Stevens Airport in Anchorage, Alaska and FedEx&#x27;s SuperHub at Memphis International Airport.
It is also the world&#x27;s sixth-busiest airport by cargo traffic, behind Hong Kong, Memphis, Shanghai Pudong, Anchorage, and Seoul Incheon Airport. The Kentucky Air National Guard&#x27;s 123d Airlift Wing operates C-130 transport aircraft from the co-located Louisville Air National Guard Base.

On January 16, 2019, the Regional Airport Authority voted to change the name of the airport to &quot;Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport&quot; in honor of the boxer and Louisville native Muhammad Ali. On June 6, 2019, the airport unveiled its new logo, featuring &quot;Ali&#x27;s silhouette, arms up and victorious, against the background of a butterfly&quot;.

==History==
Standiford Field was built by the Army Corps of Engineers in 1941 on a parcel of land south of Louisville that was found not to have flooded during the Ohio River flood of 1937. It was named for Dr. Elisha David Standiford, a local businessman and politician, who was active in transportation issues and owned part of the land. The field remained under Army control until 1947, when it was turned over to the Louisville Air Board for commercial operations.

Until around 1947, Bowman Field was Louisville&#x27;s main airport, which was too close to downtown to expand. For many years, passenger traffic went through the small brick Lee Terminal at Standiford Field. Today&#x27;s more modern and much larger facilities were built in the 1980s. Most of the Lee Terminal was later torn down.

When Standiford Field was built by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 1941, it had one runway. The airfield opened to the public in 1947 and all commercial service from Bowman Field moved to Standiford Field. American, Eastern, and TWA were the first airlines and had 1,300 passengers a week. The airlines used World War II barracks on the east side of the field until May 25, 1950, when a proper terminal opened. Lee Terminal could handle 150,000 passengers annually and included 6 new gates, which increased terminal space to . The three runways (1, 6 and 11) were all 5000 ft.

The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 45 weekday departures on Eastern Airlines, 19 American, 9 TWA, 4 Piedmont and 2 Ozark. Scheduled jet flights (Eastern 720s to Idlewild) began in January–February 1962.

In 1970, the terminal again expanded; the main lobby was extended and the Delta Air Lines concourse was built.

The 1980s brought plans for a new terminal, the Louisville Airport Improvement plan (LAIP). Construction of a new landside terminal designed by Bickel-Gibson Associated Architects Inc. began, costing $35 million with capacity for nearly 2 million passengers in 1985. Parallel runways, needed for expanded UPS operations, were part of the airport expansion. Most of the improvements were completed in the 1990s and the airport was totally renewed.

During the 1990s, Southwest Airlines began service to the airport which helped passenger boardings increase 97.3 percent. In 1995, the airport&#x27;s name was changed from Standiford Field to Louisville International Airport. Around that time, SDF opened the two new parallel runways: runway 17L/35R, long and runway 17R/35L, ; both are wide. The Kentucky Air National Guard moved its base to SDF with 8 military aircraft; a new UPS air mail facility, new corporate hangars, a four-level parking garage and a new control tower were also added. A new FBO was added, run by Atlantic Aviation and managed by Michael Perry.

In 2005, a $26 million terminal renovation designed by Gensler Inc. was completed. , the airport is in the midst of a major renovation project called SDF Next, which includes more than $1 billion in planned enhancements to the Jerry E. Abramson Terminal, work on the baggage claim, updates to security and lighting, and changes to the rental car counters, among other improvements.

On January 16, 2019, the Louisville Regional Airport Authority voted to rename the airport Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport, after boxing legend Muhammad Ali, a Louisville native.

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
The Jerry E. Abramson Terminal is the airport&#x27;s main commercial terminal. It consists of two floors with ground transportation and baggage claim services on the first floor and ticketing, passenger drop off, and concourse access on the second floor. There are 24 gates in the two concourses. These concourses are connected by a rotunda and connector that contains a unified security checkpoint located in the main section of the terminal.

*Concourse A contains 12 gates.
*Concourse B contains 12 gates.

===Runways===
Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport has three concrete runways, two of which are parallel with one crosswind. The westernmost runway (17R/35L) is the longest of the three at and was extended in 2007 to accommodate larger aircraft flying nonstop to destinations as far away as the Pacific Rim and Asia.

===Worldport===
Worldport is the worldwide air hub for UPS (United Parcel Service) located at Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport. Because of UPS, Louisville is the sixth-busiest cargo airport in the world, and the third busiest in the United States. Although UPS has had a hub at Louisville since 1980, the term was not used officially by the company until 2002, after a $1billion, five-year expansion. Previously, the project was named Hub 2000. The facility is currently the size of 5.2million square feet (48 ha; 80 football fields) and capable of handling 115 packages per second, or 416,000 per hour. With more than 20,000 employees, UPS is one of the largest employers in both the city of Louisville and the state of Kentucky as a whole. The facility, which serves all of the company&#x27;s major international and domestic hubs, mainly handles express and international packages and letters.

A expansion was completed in spring 2006 to integrate heavy freight into the UPS system. The expansion was prefaced by the purchase of Menlo Worldwide Forwarding, formerly Emery Worldwide. The new facility, designated Worldport Freight Facility (HWP), went online in April 2006 and was the first of the company&#x27;s regional hubs to begin integrating the Menlo volume into the system. Menlo&#x27;s facility in Dayton, Ohio, was taken offline in June 2006.

In May 2006, UPS announced that for the third time in seven years it would significantly expand its Worldport hub, with a second investment of $1billion. The second expansion was completed in April 2010, with the facility now measuring , with a perimeter of . The plan was for more than to be added to its existing facility, with another of space to be renovated with new technology and equipment. Worldport sorting capacity was to expand from 300,000 packages per hour to 416,000 packages per hour. Additionally, several ramps at the Louisville Muhammad Ali International Airport were to be built or altered bringing a total increase of just over .

==Accidents and incidents==
*September 28, 1953: Resort Airlines Flight 1081, a Curtiss C-46 Commando leased from the USAF, crashed on landing at Louisville-Standiford Field when the aircraft ballooned slightly during the flare-out, causing a loss of control when it climbed to 300 feet and stalled. Out of the 41 on board, 22 passengers and three crew were killed. Failure of the left elevator during landing was the cause.
*March 10, 1957: Eastern Airlines Flight 181, a Martin 4-0-4 crash-landed at SDF. All 34 passengers and crew aboard survived with just one serious injury. The pilot&#x27;s improper landing approach caused an excessive sink rate, causing a portion of the left wing to separate inboard of the #1 engine and left the aircraft partially inverted. The plane was damaged beyond repair.
*September 8, 1970: Delta Air Lines Flight 439, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9 inbound from Chicago–O&#x27;Hare attempting an instrument landing at night at SDF landed 156 feet short of the runway threshold, hitting sloping terrain, becoming airborne, bouncing and then skidding down the runway for nearly 1,500 yards before coming to a stop. All five crew and 89 passengers survived. The aircraft was substantially damaged, but repaired and later put back into service. Pilot error was the cause.
*June 7, 2005: UPS Airlines Flight 6971, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 with four occupants aboard, suffered a collapse of the nose gear assembly after touchdown due to improper handling of the aircraft by the flying pilot after the main landing gear touchdown and the pilot-in-command&#x27;s inadequate supervision during landing. The aircraft had substantial damage but was repaired and returned to service.

<doc id="264230" wikidata="Q363717" url="?curid=264230" title="Jonah Lomu">
<text>Jonah Tali Lomu (12 May 1975 – 18 November 2015) was a New Zealand professional rugby union player. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential players in the history of the sport, and as one of the most talented sportsmen ever. Lomu is considered to have been the first true global superstar of rugby, and consequently had a huge impact on the game.

Standing and weighing , Lomu was famed for his unprecedented speed, strength and agility. Exceptionally large for a wing player, he is also known as the first winger to be a physical heavyweight. For his fast and effortless style of play, Lomu was once nicknamed the &quot;freight train in ballet shoes&quot;, and was celebrated for his ability to shrug off tackles from multiple opponents at once. He became the youngest ever All Black when he played his first international in 1994 at the age of 19 years and 45 days. Playing on the wing, Lomu finished his international career with 63 caps and 37 tries. Lomu was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame on 9 October 2007, and the IRB Hall of Fame on 24 October 2011.

Born in Pukekohe to Tongan immigrants from Haʻapai, Lomu grew up between rural Tonga and South Auckland. His childhood in Auckland was marked by local gang violence, and his mother nurtured his interest in sport. Attending Wesley College, he excelled in athletics and both rugby codes before pursuing a professional career. He burst onto the international rugby scene during the 1994 Hong Kong Sevens tournament, the same year he made his fifteen-a-side debut. He was acknowledged as the top player at the 1995 World Cup for his acclaimed 4-try performance in the semi-final against England, even though New Zealand lost the final to the host South Africa. In the semi-final he famously bulldozed several players and ran straight over the top of full-back Mike Catt, establishing him as one of the most talented young players of his generation. He shares with South African Bryan Habana the Rugby World Cup all-time try scoring record of 15, which he accumulated in only two tournaments.

At the height of his fame in the mid-1990s, Lomu became a globally recognised cultural icon of South Auckland and its Pasifika community. His performance at that Rugby World Cup and others that followed established him as &quot;rugby union&#x27;s biggest drawcard&quot;, just as the game turned fully professional, with him swelling attendances at any match where he appeared. Lomu&#x27;s innovative position as a physically large winger was highly influential; for his impact on the gameplay of rugby union itself, he has been compared with Muhammad Ali, Don Bradman and Tiger Woods in their respective fields. He was appointed as a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby, in the 2007 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours. Lomu was known for his humility, gentle nature, and passion. He used his celebrity to support Pasifika community efforts and charities such as UNICEF, and often paid bills for his childhood friends in Māngere.

In 1995 he was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, a serious genetic kidney disorder, and the disease had a significant impact on his playing career and wider life. By 2003 he was on dialysis, and in 2004 underwent a kidney transplant that saved his life. He turned his energy to being a Kidney Kids NZ ambassador, encouraging children with similar afflictions to seek treatment. After a period of hiatus, he returned to play domestically rather than internationally. Lomu played for several domestic New Zealand provincial or Super Rugby sides, and late in his career played club rugby in both Wales and France. These included the Auckland Blues, with whom he won the inaugural 1996 Super 12 Final with, Chiefs and Hurricanes, and Counties Manukau, Wellington, and later North Harbour and the Cardiff Blues. His illness forced his retirement from professional rugby in 2007 at the age of 32.

After returning from abroad, Lomu died unexpectedly on 18 November 2015 at home in Auckland. The cause was a heart attack associated with his kidney condition. His passing saw widespread tributes to him and his family, including condolences from Queen Elizabeth II and a haka performed by the pupils of his boyhood primary school. The New Zealand Parliament passed a national motion in honour of his life.

== Early life and youth career ==

Lomu was born in Pukekohe, Auckland on 12 May 1975 to Tongan parents, who had emigrated from Holopeka, a village on Lifuka in the Haʻapai Islands. Lomu was a Tongan speaker; he spent some of his early childhood in Holopeka with his aunt Longo and uncle Mosese, where he spoke the language to fluency. He then moved back to Auckland suburb of Māngere to be educated, where he spent the rest of his childhood with his parents and siblings. There, he was exposed to nearby gang violence, and lost an uncle and a cousin to attacks. This led his mother to send him to Wesley College in Auckland. At high school, Lomu excelled in athletics, in particular, the 100 metres, shot put, javelin, high jump, hurdles and relay. In his final year, he ran the 100 mts in 11.2 seconds. By 1993, during his last year at Wesley, he started playing rugby more seriously, while still combining it with athletics.

New Zealand sevens star Eric Rush played a touch game with Lomu when he was 14 years old and was so impressed he invited him to a sevens tournament in Singapore the next day. As a youngster however, Lomu first played rugby league. His introduction to rugby union came through a tournament in Te Kuiti where he stayed with Glyn Meads, son of famous All Black Colin Meads.

Lomu started his rugby union career in the forwards, mostly as an openside flanker (no.7), sometimes to the blindside (no.6), before switching to the left wing in what he described as the &quot;best move he could have made&quot;. He represented New Zealand in the national under-19 side in 1993, as well as the under-21 side the following year. He first came to international attention at the 1994 Hong Kong Sevens tournament as part of a team including Rush.

At the age of 19 years and 45 days, Lomu became the youngest All Black test player as he debuted on the wing against France in 1994, breaking a record that had been held by Edgar Wrigley since 1905. The match was played at Lancaster Park in Christchurch, and the All Blacks lost 22–8. The second match was played at Eden Park in Auckland with France winning again, 23–20. Lomu marked Emile N&#x27;tamack and admits that his inexperience led to him being exposed by the French team.

==1995 World Cup==
Despite having just two All Black caps, Lomu was included in the squad for the 1995 World Cup in South Africa. Lomu scored seven tries in five matches, two in the first match against Ireland in Johannesburg, a try in the quarter final against Scotland at Loftus Versfeld, and four tries in the semi-final against England at Newlands. The first try in the English match occurred after Lomu received a pass behind him, beat two defenders and then, after a stumble, ran straight over the top of Mike Catt. This caused one New Zealand commentator, Keith Quinn, to gasp.

After the game, England captain Will Carling said: &quot;He is a freak and the sooner he goes away the better&quot;. His first score was voted the try of the tournament. In 2002 the UK public voted Lomu&#x27;s performance no. 19 in the list of the 100 Greatest Sporting Moments. New Zealand played the World Cup final at Ellis Park against South Africa. Neither side scored a try, with South Africa coming out on top 15–12 after kicking a drop-goal in extra time.

==1996–1998==
Following the World Cup New Zealand played Australia home and away for the Bledisloe Cup with Lomu scoring tries in both matches. He scored two tries in the All Blacks victory over Italy in Bologna. Lomu played against France in Toulouse, where New Zealand failed to score any tries. He scored a try in the second test in Paris, helping his team to victory. Lomu played for the All Blacks in matches against the touring Samoa and Scotland teams in June 1996, scoring in one of the Scottish matches.

Just before the World Cup final a deal was struck between South Africa, New Zealand and Australia (SANZAR) to create the Tri-Nations, an annual round robin competition between the three nations launched with the advent of professionalism in rugby. New Zealand won all their games to become the first Tri-Nations winners. Lomu scored a try in a 43–6 victory over Australia in the inaugural match, which has been described by New Zealand Herald journalist David Leggat as &quot;the perfect wet-weather game&quot;.

At the end of 1996, Lomu was diagnosed with a rare and serious kidney disorder, which saw him take time off from the sport. As a result, he did not play in the 1997 Tri Nations Series, but he was included in the All Blacks tour of the northern hemisphere at the end of the year. Lomu played in the two warm up matches, scoring tries against Wales &#x27;A&#x27; and Emerging England. He played the first test against England at Old Trafford, as well as the test against Wales at Wembley Stadium, and the second match against England—he did not score in any of the three games.

At the 1998 Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur, he won a gold medal representing New Zealand in the Sevens Rugby event. The English rugby team came to New Zealand the following year for a two test series. Lomu played in both of the matches, scoring in the first, which was a 64–22 win in Dunedin, but not in the second test won 40–10 by the All Blacks.

==1999 and the World Cup==
Lomu&#x27;s 1999 international season kicked off with a warm-up match against New Zealand A, which was followed by a game against Samoa in which Lomu scored one of the All Blacks&#x27; nine tries. He came on as a replacement in every game of the 1999 Tri Nations Series with Christian Cullen and Tana Umaga preferred as starters on the wings. New Zealand were crowned Tri Nations champions despite losing the last game against Australia.

Lomu scored eight tries at the 1999 World Cup. In pool matches he scored two tries against Tonga, one against England and two against Italy. The All Blacks finished top of their pool and proceeded to the quarter-finals. They defeated Scotland, with Lomu scoring one of New Zealand&#x27;s four tries. Lomu scored twice in the semi-final match against France, though it was not enough to see them through to the final as France went on to win 43–31. Following the World Cup, despite speculation that he would be moving to play American Football in the National Football League or stay to play rugby in the English Premiership, Lomu returned to New Zealand.

==End of international career==

Lomu started 2000 with big victories over Tonga and Scotland. The opening match of the 2000 Tri Nations Series was played in front of a record crowd of 109,874 and has been labelled the &quot;match of the century&#x27;.&#x27; New Zealand scored three tries in the first five minutes to lead by 21 points, before Australia came back, leveling the scores before half time. With minutes remaining, the Wallabies led 35 to 34; until Lomu &quot;brushed past a desperate Stephen Larkham to tip-toe down the line and score the winning try&quot;. The match was followed by a victory over South Africa, and then a re-match with Australia, which Australia won 24 to 23. New Zealand lost the final game to South Africa finishing second in the table, behind Australia. Lomu played in one other test that year; against France at Stade de France in November, which the All Blacks won 39 to 26.

Lomu was part of the New Zealand Sevens team that won the 2001 Sevens World Cup, filling in for Rush, who suffered a broken leg during the competition. In the lead up to the 2001 Tri Nations Series, the All Blacks played Argentina and France at home, Lomu scoring a try in the French match. After a try-less opening victory against South Africa Lomu played his 50th test for the All Blacks at the Carisbrook &#x27;House of Pain&#x27;, scoring a try in the second minute of play. The Wallabies spoiled the party however, winning 23 to 15. This was followed by a win over South Africa, and loss to the Wallabies at Stadium Australia.

During the 1999 off season, Lomu transferred to Wellington, signing up with second division club Wainuiomata RFC. Lomu played his debut match against Northern United scoring twice and attracting a bumper crowd and followed that up with a further appearance in 2001. Lomu wore the green and black club socks when he played for the Barbarian F.C. in 2000.

At the end of the year, the All Blacks played Ireland at Lansdowne Road in Dublin. Lomu was a central figure in the 40 to 29 win, setting up Aaron Mauger for his debut try, and taking an inside pass to blast through for one of his own. The All Blacks end of season tour continued at Murrayfield in Edinburgh, where they defeated Scotland 37 to six, with Lomu contributing one try. In the final match of the tour, the All Blacks played Argentina at the River Plate Stadium. Lomu put the All Blacks in front with a try after Argentina took an early lead. New Zealand won the match by a score of 24 to 20.

In his first test of 2002, he came off the bench in the second half to score a try in a match against Italy. He was again injected into play from the bench in the first of a two test series against Ireland in New Zealand; helping New Zealand to an uninspiring win. Lomu was back starting on the left wing for the second test against the Irish, which New Zealand won 40–8. Lomu did not score in the subsequent match against Fiji; in performance that was labelled &quot;disappointing&quot; by Matthew Cooper after he was beaten on the outside for Fiji&#x27;s first try. Lomu came off the bench in the All Blacks first game of the 2002 Tri Nations Series against South Africa, though he did not play in the rest of the tournament.

He returned to the wing for a game against England in November 2002. Lomu ended up scoring two tries, though it was not enough to secure a New Zealand victory, with England winning 31–28. The subsequent match against France resulted in a draw, the first between the two nations in 96 years. The last match of the end of season tour was against Wales, which the All Blacks won 43–17. These were the last international matches that Lomu would play for New Zealand as his illness worsened and he needed a kidney transplant.

== Comeback ==
Lomu returned to professional rugby in 2005. He first needed special clearance from the World Anti-Doping Agency, as one of the anti-rejection drugs he was required to take is on the WADA list of banned substances. On 8 April 2005, he signed a two-year contract to play for the New Zealand first division provincial team North Harbour in the NPC. He ended up missing the first season when he injured his shoulder scoring a try in a preseason testimonial match against Martin Johnson&#x27;s invitational XV. Instead he worked in a coaching capacity. North Harbour gave him permission to play overseas at the Cardiff Blues over the off season.

Lomu made his first appearance in a competitive match since his transplant on 10 December 2005, with a 60-minute effort in Cardiff&#x27;s away Heineken Cup fixture against Italian club Calvisano. Lomu scored his first try for Cardiff on 27 December, with a man-of-the-match performance during a 41–23 win against the Newport Gwent Dragons. He spent the early part of 2006 sidelined while he concentrated on gaining speed and strength not playing again until April. He broke his ankle near the end of his first game back, ending his season with Cardiff. During his time in Wales, he played 10 games and scored one try.

He returned to North Harbour for the 2006 NPC season, playing for Massey against Marist in the North Harbour club competition. For Lomu it was &quot;a small step&quot; towards his aim of reclaiming his All Blacks jersey for the 2007 World Cup. Lomu played for North Harbour in round four of the National Provincial Championship against Wellington winning 31–16. Lomu said after the match &quot;For me it&#x27;s a dream come true... I&#x27;ve always said this is my goal—to come back and play in New Zealand.&quot; Lomu failed to get a Super Rugby contract, effectively dashing any hopes of making the World Cup squad. Lomu stated that he was disappointed by his failure to gain a Super 14 contract, but that he had not failed himself.

Lomu was offered a contract with the Gold Coast Titans, a new Queensland franchise in the National Rugby League competition, but turned it down as it would have been difficult to reconcile his sponsorship contracts with companies associated with rugby union.

===Retirement===
Lomu retired from professional rugby in 2007, but still took part in some charity matches. He was going to play in the Help For Heroes charity match at Twickenham in 2008, but had to withdraw after injuring his ankle in training. Later that year Lomu played in a charity match at Aberavon RFC&#x27;s Talbot Athletic grounds to raise money for a local children&#x27;s charity. The match was covered by the BBC rugby show &quot;Scrum V&quot;.

In September 2009, Lomu took part in an amateur bodybuilding contest, finishing second in two categories, including the men&#x27;s open over-90 kg, and the mixed pairs. He joined French Fédérale 1 team Marseille Vitrolles in November, making his debut in a 64–13 victory over against Montmelian. Lomu started the match at centre then moved to number 8, the position he played as a youngster in New Zealand.

Lomu also made an attempt to take part in a charity boxing event in New Zealand called &quot;Fight for Life&quot; 2011, for which he was the intended captain of the rugby union team. It was his intention to fight the main event against former league player Monty Betham. On 14 November Lomu pulled out of the competition as he had just recently been hospitalised for over a week due to his failing kidney.

==Statistics==

===International tries===

Lomu scored tries against every major test playing nation in World Rugby except South Africa (12 matches) and Wales (3 matches). In his career, Lomu scored eight tries against England—more than any other All Black. Lomu set a record of 15 tries in World Cup tournaments, which was equalled by South African Bryan Habana in 2015.

== Playing style ==
Lomu had a unique combination of power, size and speed that made him devastating with the ball in hand. He weighed 120 kg and was 1.96 metres tall, but could run 100 metres in 11.2 seconds. He ran with a low centre of gravity and was the best exponent at bumping off attempted tackles in the game. He also had a powerful fend and subtle body swerve. He generally stayed out on his wing, but would occasionally replace Zinzan Brooke at the back of the scrum if the All Blacks wanted more power. Lomu was famously described as the &quot;freight train in ballet shoes&quot; by Australian rugby journalist Peter FitzSimons, who elaborated: &quot;other players could go through players, other players could go around player... Lomu could do it all.”

==Personal life==

In 1996, Lomu married South African Tanya Rutter, and they made their home in New Zealand. Lomu&#x27;s family never approved of the relationship, and they divorced after four years of marriage.

Lomu married his second wife Fiona in a secret ceremony on Waiheke Island in August 2003, holding the wedding reception a week later on the same island. In 2008, Lomu and Fiona divorced after he had an affair with Nadene Quirk. Lomu and Nadene later married in 2011 and at the time of his death he was living with Nadene and their children, Brayley and Dhyreille. Lomu was a lover of languages.
In addition to English and his parents&#x27; Tongan, he also learned to speak in French, Spanish, Mandarin, Cantonese and he had a working proficiency of Russian.

Lomu was a member of the Champions for Peace club, a group of 54 famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organisation. In 2012, Lomu and Nadene became members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

In 1996, McDonald&#x27;s New Zealand named a burger after Lomu, temporarily rebranding the McFeast burger line (called &quot;Mega Feast&quot; in New Zealand) as the &quot;Jonah Burger&quot;.

On 9 April 2007, Lomu appeared on New Zealand&#x27;s version of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, in which he was reunited with long time friend Grant Kereama, who had donated a kidney to Lomu when he underwent a kidney transplant in July 2004. He was a subject of the British version of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2002 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel while touring with the All Blacks in Edinburgh.

=== Financial troubles ===
Despite making millions of dollars during his rugby career, Lomu died with only a few assets to his name and very little savings. It is believed his earnings were absorbed by his divorces, medical bills related to his kidney disease, and failed business ventures.

Lomu was the director and a shareholder in Global 11 Travel, which was liquidated in 1999. At the time of his death, he owed money on property investments, as well as loans taken out to buy personal vehicles. His family were living in a rented $2.2 million (NZD) Auckland home. Lomu had sold some of his properties a decade prior, including his Maupuia mansion bought in 2000, which sold three years later for a reported $1.4 million (NZD).

==Health issues==

At the end of 1995, Lomu was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome, a serious kidney disorder. His rugby union career went on hold whilst the disorder was treated. In May 2003, the NZRFU announced that Lomu had been put on dialysis three times a week due to deterioration in his kidney function. Side effects of Lomu&#x27;s dialysis treatment led to severe nerve damage in his feet and legs; his doctors warned him that he faced life in a wheelchair if a kidney transplant was not performed soon. Lomu underwent a kidney transplant on 28 July 2004 in Auckland, New Zealand. The kidney was donated by Wellington radio presenter Grant Kereama.

===Death===
On the morning of 18 November 2015, Lomu died unexpectedly in Auckland from a heart attack linked to his kidney disease. The previous night he had returned from the United Kingdom with his family after a short holiday stay in Dubai. Lomu had been receiving dialysis treatments during his visit to the UK where he was involved in heavy promotional work during the 2015 Rugby World Cup. His first public service was held in his home church in Māngere, Auckland, with Lomu&#x27;s family members in attendance. Two public services were held at Vodafone Events Centre in Manukau on 28 November 2015, and at Eden Park on 30 November 2015, a day before a private service. His passing saw widespread tributes to him and his family, from Queen Elizabeth II to a haka performed by the pupils of his boyhood primary school. The New Zealand Parliament passed a national motion in honour of his life.

A month after his death, an independent trust known as the Jonah Lomu Legacy Trust was formed by the New Zealand Rugby Players&#x27; Association, intended to help support his sons.

== Legacy ==
Lomu has been described as one of the greatest athletes not just in the game of rugby, but in sporting history altogether. He has been widely described as the first true global superstar of rugby union and as having a huge impact on the game, with comparisons being drawn with Muhammad Ali, Don Bradman and Tiger Woods. On his game-changing ability, fellow rugby player Kenny Logan stated, &quot;you could talk about Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo, that’s what Jonah was, someone who could change games if you gave him the ball wherever he was&quot;. At one time Lomu was considered &#x27;rugby union&#x27;s biggest drawcard&#x27;, as his appearance at a match would increase attendance.

Before 1995, wingers were generally fast and good on their feet. Lomu was the first truly massive wing, a trend that has now become standard in many teams. Following his displays at the 1995 Rugby World Cup, in December 1995 Lomu received the BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year, an award given to a non-British sportsperson considered to have made the most substantial contribution to a sport each year who has also captured the imagination of the British public. Lomu was also noted for his charity; as a celebrity, he supported Pasifika community efforts and charities such as UNICEF and Kidney Kids NZ.

Lomu was inducted into the International Rugby Hall of Fame on 9 October 2007, and the IRB Hall of Fame on 24 October 2011. He was appointed as a Member of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to rugby, in the 2007 Queen&#x27;s Birthday Honours.

Lomu lent his name to various video games including &quot;Jonah Lomu Rugby&quot; and &quot;Rugby Challenge&quot;. He is portrayed by Isaac Fe&#x27;aunati in &quot;Invictus&quot;, a film chronicling Nelson Mandela&#x27;s journey with the South African rugby team in the 1995 World Cup.

In March 2018, Jonah Lomu Drive, in the Paerata Rise development north of Pukekohe, was named in his honour.

On 16 November 2018, an exhibition rugby match was held at Aberavon Quins RFC to raise funds for the Jonah Lomu Legacy Trust. The game was organised by a local rugby fanatic, Stuart Broad, as a means to thank Lomu for having turned out to play for Aberavon Naval RFC 10 years previously. The event included players from all over Wales, as well as a Welsh male voice choir, a female vocalist, a brass band, Māori war dancers and a fireworks display. It raised £3,500 in aid of the trust set up for Lomu&#x27;s two sons.

As of 2024, a documentary on the life of Lomu (titled &quot;Lomu&quot;) is in production. The documentary has received NZ$800,000 in funding from the New Zealand Film Commission. Lomu&#x27;s widow, Nadene Lomu, has strongly opposed its production.

<text>Río Muni (called &quot;Mbini&quot; in Fang) is the Continental Region (called &quot;Región Continental&quot; in Spanish) of Equatorial Guinea, and comprises the mainland geographical region, covering . The name is derived from the Muni River, along which the early Europeans had built the Muni River Settlements.

==History==
Río Muni was ceded by Portugal to Spain in 1778 in the Treaty of El Pardo. The Spanish had hoped to collect slaves to work in their other overseas possessions, but the settlers died of yellow fever, and the area was deserted. Cocoa and timber became major industries upon recolonization. Río Muni, along with Bioko, became a province of Spanish Guinea in 1959.

==Population==
In 2015, 885,015 people—about 72% of Equatorial Guinea&#x27;s population—lived in Río Muni. The main languages spoken in Río Muni are Fang-Ntumu, which is spoken in the north, and Fang-Okak, which is spoken in the south. Spanish is also spoken, although only as a second language.

==Provinces==
Río Muni comprises five provinces: 
:*Centro Sur
:*Djibloho
:*Kié-Ntem
:*Litoral
:*Wele-Nzas

==Cities==
The largest city is Bata, which also serves as the regional administrative capital. Other major towns include Evinayong, Ebebiyín, Acalayong, Acurenam, Mongomo and Mbini.

<doc id="264234" wikidata="Q2367930" url="?curid=264234" title="Gebeleizis">
<text>Gebeleizis was a god worshiped by the Getae, whose name has been interpreted as a theonym for the Indo-European sky and weather god, evidently also called by the Thracians with a symilar theonym – Zibelthiurdos or Zbelsurdos. In ancient literature he is mentioned only by Herodotus.

Gebeleizis was represented as a handsome man, sometimes wearing a beard. The lightning and thunder were his manifestations. According to Herodotus, some Getae equated Gebeleizis with Zalmoxis as the same god.

==Name==
The name of the god can be deduced from the Proto-Slavic *gybělь, with meaning disaster, destruction, ruin, devastation, perdition, doom.

The airport had its beginnings in 1909, when the Aero Club of St. Louis created a balloon launching base called the &quot;Permanent Aviation Field and Dirigible Harbor&quot; in Kinloch Park, a suburban development of the 1890s. In October 1910, the airfield hosted the first International Air Meet, attracting &quot;many famous persons,&quot; including the Wright brothers, who brought six airplanes and their Exhibition Team. President Theodore Roosevelt accepted the club&#x27;s telegraphed invitation to attend, and after initially ruling out a flight, took off on October 11 with pilot Arch Hoxsey, becoming the first U.S. president to fly. The following year, the airfield—generally called &quot;Kinloch Field&quot;—was the takeoff point for what is generally regarded as the first parachute jump from an airplane. The club&#x27;s lease on the land expired in 1912, and the field was closed and its grandstand demolished. Efforts to revive the facility were unsuccessful.

In June 1920, a nearby 170-acre field was leased to the Missouri Aeronautical Society, which named its facility the &quot;St. Louis Flying Field.&quot; Among the Society&#x27;s leading members was Albert Bond Lambert, an Olympic silver medalist golfer in the 1904 Summer Games, president of Lambert Pharmaceutical Corporation (which made Listerine), and the first person to receive a pilot&#x27;s license in St. Louis. So vigorous was Lambert in his efforts to promote St. Louis aviation that in 1923 the field was renamed &quot;Lambert-St. Louis Flying Field.&quot; Lambert purchased the field outright in February 1925, and added hangars and a passenger terminal. In the late 1920s, the airport became the first with an air traffic control system–albeit one that communicated with pilots via waving flags. The first controller was Archie League.

Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s first piloting job was flying airmail for Robertson Aircraft Corporation from the airfield. He stopped at the airport during his cross-country San Diego to New York flight about a week before his record-breaking flight to Paris in 1927. In February 1928, the City of St. Louis leased the airport for $1. Later that year, Lambert sold the airport to the city after a $2 million bond issue was passed, making it one of the first municipally owned airports in the United States.

In 1925, the airport became home to Naval Air Station St. Louis, a Naval Air Reserve facility that became an active-duty installation during World War II.

In 1930, the airport was officially christened &quot;Lambert–St. Louis Municipal Airport&quot; by Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd. The first terminal building opened in 1933, and within the decade, the airport was served by Robertson Air Lines, Marquette Airlines, Eastern Air Lines, and Transcontinental &amp; Western Air (later renamed TWA).

In August 1942, voters passed a $4.5 million bond issue to expand the airport by and build a new terminal.

During World War II, the airport became a manufacturing base for the McDonnell Aircraft Corporation (later McDonnell Douglas, now Boeing) and Curtiss-Wright.

===After World War II: expansion, Ozark Air Lines hub===

After the war, NAS St. Louis reverted to a reserve installation, supporting carrier-based fighters and land-based patrol aircraft. When it closed in 1958, most of its facilities were acquired by the Missouri Air National Guard and became &quot;Lambert Field Air National Guard Base.&quot; Some other facilities were retained by non-flying activities of the Naval Reserve and Marine Corps Reserve, while the rest was redeveloped to expand airline operations at the airport.

Ozark Air Lines began operations at the airport in 1950.

To handle increasing passenger traffic, Minoru Yamasaki was commissioned to design a new terminal, which began construction in 1953. Completed in 1956 at a total cost of $7.2 million, the three-domed design preceded terminals at John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) in New York City and Paris–Charles de Gaulle Airport. A fourth dome was added in 1965 following the passage of a $200 million airport revenue bond.

The April 1957 Official Airline Guide shows 44 weekday TWA departures; American, 24; Delta, 16; Ozark, 14; Eastern, 13; Braniff, 6 and Central, 2. The first scheduled jet was a TWA 707 to New York on July 21, 1959.

In 1971, the airport became &quot;Lambert–St. Louis International Airport.&quot;

In the 1970s, St. Louis city officials proposed to replace Lambert with a new airport in suburban Illinois. After Missouri residents rejected that, Lambert in 1977 received a $290-million expansion that lengthened the runways, increased the number of gates to 81, and boosted its capacity by half. (In 1997, MidAmerica St. Louis Airport would open in Mascoutah, Illinois, far from the site proposed in the 1970s.) Concourse A and Concourse C were rebuilt into bi-level structures with jet bridges as part of a $25 million project in the mid-1970s designed by Sverdrup. The other concourses were demolished. Construction began in the spring of 1976 and was completed in September 1977. A $20 million, extension of Concourse C for TWA and a $46 million, Concourse D for Ozark Air Lines (also designed by Sverdrup) were completed in December 1982.

Ozark established its only hub at Lambert in the late 1950s. The airline grew rapidly, going from 36 million revenue passenger miles in 1955, to 229 million revenue passenger miles in 1965. The jet age came to Ozark in 1966 with the Douglas DC-9-10 and its network expanded to Denver, Indianapolis, Louisville, Washington, D.C., New York City, Miami, Tampa, and Orlando. With the addition of jets, Ozark began its fastest period of growth, jumping to 653 million revenue passenger miles in 1970 and 936 million revenue passenger miles in 1975; Ozark soon faced heavy competition in TWA&#x27;s new hub at Lambert.

In 1979, the year after airline deregulation, STL&#x27;s dominant carriers were TWA (36 routes) and Ozark (25), followed by American (17) and Eastern (12). In April 1980, British Caledonian began a nonstop flight to London&#x27;s Gatwick Airport using a Boeing 707. This was the airport&#x27;s first transatlantic service. The company later partnered with Ozark so that the latter&#x27;s network could feed the flights. British Caledonian severed the link in October 1984.

===Trans World Airlines hub===
After airline deregulation in 1978, airlines began to change their operations to a hub and spoke model. Trans World Airlines (TWA) was headquartered in New York City but its main base of employment was at Kansas City International Airport (MCI) and had large operations at Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport (ORD) as well as St. Louis. TWA deemed Kansas City&#x27;s terminals unsuitable to serve as a primary hub. TWA reluctantly ruled out Chicago, as its Chicago operation was already losing $25 million a year under competition from American Airlines and United Airlines. This meant that St. Louis was the carrier&#x27;s only viable option. TWA downsized in Chicago and built up in St. Louis, swapping three Chicago gates for five of American&#x27;s St. Louis gates. By December 1982, St. Louis accounted for 20% of TWA&#x27;s domestic capacity. Lambert&#x27;s terminal was initially too small for this operation, and TWA was forced to use temporary terminals, mobile lounges and airstairs to handle the additional flights. Concourse D was completed in 1985. In April 1985, TWA began service from Lambert to London-Gatwick, Frankfurt, and Paris. It operated the flight to London with Boeing 747s and the ones to Paris and Frankfurt with 767s.

TWA&#x27;s hub grew again in 1986 when the airline bought Ozark Air Lines, which operated its hub from Lambert&#x27;s B, C, and D concourses. In 1985, TWA had accounted for 56.6% of boardings at STL while Ozark accounted for 26.3%, so the merged carriers controlled over 80% of the traffic. The carriers were merged on October 26, 1986 at which time TWA served STL with nonstop service to 84 cities, an increase from 80 cities served by TWA and/or Ozark in 1985, before the merger.

Lambert again grew in importance for TWA after the airline declared bankruptcy in 1992 and the following year moved its headquarters to St. Louis from Mount Kisco, New York. TWA increased the number of cities served and started routing more connecting passengers through its hub at Lambert. The total number of passengers departing Lambert jumped almost 20% in a year, from 19.9 million passengers in 1993 to 23.4 million in 1994. Growth continued, to 27.3 million by 1997 and the airport&#x27;s all-time peak of 30.6 million in 2000.

By September 1999, Lambert was TWA&#x27;s main hub, with 103 destinations served by 515 daily flights: 352 on TWA mainline aircraft and 163 on Trans World Express flights operated by its commuter airline partners. Lambert became the eighth-busiest U.S. airport by flights. Congestion caused delays during peak hours and was exacerbated when bad weather reduced the number of usable runways from three to one, and traffic projections made in the 1980s and 1990s predicted enough growth to strain the airport and the national air traffic system. As a result, city leaders decided to build a runway, dubbed Runway 11/29, parallel to the two larger existing runways. At $1.1 billion, it was the costliest public works program in St. Louis history. It required moving seven major roads and destroying about 2,000 homes, six churches, and four schools in Bridgeton. Work began in 1998 and continued even as traffic at the airport declined after the 9/11 attacks, the collapse of TWA and its subsequent purchase by American, and American&#x27;s flight reductions several years later.&lt;ref name=&quot;11/29&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Airlines and hub closure===

As TWA entered the new millennium, its financial condition deteriorated; it was purchased by American Airlines in April 2001. The last day of operations for TWA was December 1, 2001, including a ceremonial last flight to TWA&#x27;s original and historic hometown of Kansas City before returning to St. Louis one final time. The following day, TWA was officially absorbed into American Airlines. The plan for Lambert was to become a reliever hub for the existing American hubs at Chicago–O&#x27;Hare and Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW). American was looking at something strategic with its new St. Louis hub to potentially offload some of the pressure on O&#x27;Hare as well as provide a significant boost to the airline&#x27;s east/west connectivity.

The September 11 attacks depressed air service nationwide: total airline industry domestic revenue passenger miles dropped 20% in October 2001 and 17% in November 2001. Overnight, American no longer had the same need for a hub that bypassed its hubs at Chicago and Dallas/Fort Worth, which suddenly became less congested. As a result of this and the ongoing economic recession, service at Lambert was reduced to 207 flights by November 2003. Total passenger traffic dropped to 20.4 million that same year. On the international front, American dropped flights to London-Gatwick in October 2003, leaving St. Louis without transatlantic service.

In 2006, the United States Air Force (USAF) announced plans to turn the 131st Fighter Wing of the Missouri Air National Guard into the 131st Bomb Wing. The wing&#x27;s 20 F-15C and F-15D aircraft were moved to the Montana Air National Guard&#x27;s 120th Airlift Wing at Great Falls International Airport/Air National Guard Base, Montana, and the Hawaii Air National Guard&#x27;s 154th Wing at Hickam AFB, Hawaii. The pilots and maintainers moved to Whiteman AFB, Missouri to fly and maintain the B-2 Spirit stealth bomber as the first Air National Guard wing to fly the aircraft. Lambert Field Air National Guard Base formally shut down on June 13, 2009, when the final two F-15C Eagles did a low approach over the field and then flew away, ending an 86-year chapter of Lambert&#x27;s history.

2006 also saw the completion of the W-1W airport expansion after eight years of work. The culmination of this program was the opening of Runway 11/29, the airport&#x27;s fourth, on April 13, 2006, when American Airlines Flight 2470 became the first commercial airliner to land on the new runway.

In 2008, Lambert&#x27;s position as an American Airlines hub faced further pressure due to increased fuel costs and softened demand because of a depressed economy. American cut its overall system capacity by over 5% during 2008. At Lambert, American shifted more flights from mainline to regional. Total passengers enplaned fell 6% to 14.4 million in 2008, then fell another 11% to 12.8 million passengers in 2009. In 2009, American announced that as a part of the airline&#x27;s restructuring, it would close its St. Louis hub by reducing its operations from about 200 daily flights to 36 daily flights by summer 2010. American&#x27;s closure of the St. Louis hub coincided with its new &quot;Cornerstone&quot; plan, wherein the airline would concentrate itself in several major markets: Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, Miami, New York, and Los Angeles. A 12-gate section of Concourse D closed in 2009 as a result of the hub closure. Further flight reductions led to the closure of Concourse B and the rest of Concourse D in 2010 (though some gates at the east end of Concourse D are now part of Concourse E).

===Recent years===
In the aftermath of the American hub closure, Southwest Airlines boosted daily departures from 74 to 83, adding six new destinations for a total of 31. Southwest quickly replaced American as the carrier with the most daily flights, and continues to dominate the airport to this day. Southwest Airlines had been growing steadily at Lambert since the mid-1990s. In 1998, the East Terminal (known today as Terminal 2) and Concourse E opened to accommodate Southwest&#x27;s growth, where they operate today.

On April 22, 2011, a tornado (rated EF4 nearby but not at the airport itself) struck the airport&#x27;s Terminal 1, destroying jetways and breaking more than half of the windows. The wind damaged a Southwest Airlines aircraft by pushing a baggage conveyor belt into it. Four American Airlines aircraft were damaged, including one that was buffeted by crosswinds while taxiing after landing. Another aircraft, with passengers still on board, was moved away from its jetway by the storm. The FAA closed the airport at 8:54 pm CDT, and reopened it the following day at temporarily lower capacity. The damage to Concourse C even forced the airport to temporarily reopen some of Concourses B and D for additional gate space. Concourse C underwent renovations and repairs and reopened on April 2, 2012.

In late 2016, officials with the City of St. Louis announced that brand researchers had found that travelers might be confused by the name &quot;Lambert–St. Louis International Airport&quot;. They said they might rename it St. Louis International Airport at Lambert Field to freshen up the airport&#x27;s image and emphasize &quot;St. Louis&quot; in the name. Descendants of Albert Bond Lambert opposed the change, arguing that it de-emphasized the importance of Maj. Lambert to the airport&#x27;s history and the history of aviation. The proposal was amended, and the St. Louis Airport Commission voted unanimously to change the name to St. Louis Lambert International Airport.

In May 2018, Wow Air began flights between St. Louis and Reykjavík on an Airbus A321. This was the airport&#x27;s first service to Europe since 2003. Despite strong sales, Wow ended the route in January 2019 amid financial struggles. In June 2022, Lufthansa commenced nonstop service to Frankfurt using Airbus A330s. German firms like Bayer and the Merck Group have a significant presence in St. Louis.

In early 2022, airport officials released a plan that would consolidate both existing terminals into one, at the existing Terminal 1 site. The proposal would gradually demolish Concourses A, B, C and build a single new concourse with 62 gates in its place, while retaining the iconic domed terminal building. Following the completion, Terminal 2 would be demolished or repurposed.

==Facilities==
=== Terminals ===
The airport has two terminals, five concourses, and 54 gates.

*Terminal 1 contains 36 gates across two concourses, lettered A and C. It also has an American Airlines Admirals Club and one of the nation&#x27;s largest USO facilities. 
*Terminal 2 contains 18 gates across one concourse, lettered E. It also has a public lounge operated by Wingtips. All international flights without border preclearance are processed in Terminal 2.

Inter-terminal transfers/connections can be made by Terminal Shuttle Buses or on the Metro rail between Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 (rail connection is free between the terminals as of July 2024)

===Runways===

The airport has four runways: three parallel and one crosswind. The crosswind runway, 6/24, is the shortest of the four at . The newest runway is 11/29, completed in 2006 as part of a large expansion program.

The airport&#x27;s current ~ control tower opened in 1997 at a cost of about $15 million.

===Ground transportation===

The airport is served by MetroLink, the light rail transportation system serving Greater St. Louis. The Red Line has stations at Terminal 1 and Terminal 2. The Metro lines serve the city of St. Louis, along with cities in St. Louis County, and Illinois suburbs in St. Clair County.

The airport is served by I-70; eastbound leads to downtown St. Louis and Illinois with a north–south connection at I-170 immediately east of the airport, while westbound leads to St. Louis exurbs in St. Charles County with a north–south connection at I-270 immediately west of the airport.

===Art and historical pieces===

&quot;Black Americans in Flight&quot; is a mural that depicts African American aviators and their contributions to aviation since 1917. It is located in Terminal 1 / Main Terminal on the lower level near the entrance to gates C and D and baggage claim. The mural consists of five panels and measures tall and long. The first panel includes Albert Edward Forsythe and C. Alfred Anderson, the first black pilots to complete a cross-country flight; the Tuskegee Institute and the Tuskegee Airmen; Eugene Bullard; Bessie Coleman; and Willa Brown, the first African American woman commercial pilot. The second panel shows Benjamin O. Davis Jr., Clarence &quot;Lucky&quot; Lester, and Joseph Ellesberry. The third panel shows Gen. Daniel &quot;Chappie&quot; James, Capt. Ronald Radliff, and Capt. Marcella Hayes. The fourth and fifth panels show Ronald McNair, who died in the Space Shuttle &quot;Challenger&quot; disaster in 1986, Guion Bluford, who in 1983 became the first African American in space, and Mae Jemison, the first African American woman in space. Spencer Taylor and Solomon Thurman created the mural in 1990. The mural had a re-dedication ceremony in 2012.

One aircraft from the Missouri History Museum currently hangs from Lambert&#x27;s ceilings. This aircraft, a red Monocoupe 110 Special manufactured in St. Louis in 1931, hangs in the ticketing hall of Terminal 2. The airport has also played host to two other aircraft. A Monocoupe D-127 hung near the eastern security checkpoint in Terminal 1. Charles Lindbergh bought it in 1934 from the Lambert Aircraft Corporation and flew it as his personal aircraft. It was removed in 2018 and returned to the Missouri Historical Society, from which the aircraft had been on loan since 1979, for preservation purposes. Until 1998, a Ryan B-1 Brougham, a replica of the &quot;Spirit of St. Louis&quot;, hung next to the D-127.

=== Accidents ===
* August 5, 1936: Chicago and Southern Flight 4, a Lockheed 10 Electra headed for Chicago, crashed after takeoff, killing all eight passengers and crew. The pilot became disoriented in fog.
* January 23, 1941: a Douglas DC-3 of Transcontinental &amp; Western Air crashed 0.4 miles west of St. Louis Municipal Airport during a landing attempt in adverse weather, killing two occupants out of the 14 on board.
* August 1, 1943: during a demonstration flight of an &quot;all St. Louis-built glider&quot;, a Waco CG-4A, USAAF serial &quot;42-78839&quot;, built by sub-contractor Robertson Aircraft Company, lost its starboard wing due to a defective wing strut support and plummeted vertically to the ground at Lambert Field, killing all on board, including St. Louis Mayor William D. Becker; Maj. William B. Robertson and Harold Krueger, both of Robertson Aircraft; Thomas Dysart, president of the St. Louis Chamber of Commerce; Max Doyne, director of public utilities; Charles Cunningham, department comptroller; and Henry Mueller, St. Louis Court presiding judge. The failed component had been manufactured by Robertson subcontractor Gardner Metal Products Company, of St. Louis, which, coincidentally, had been a casket maker.
* September 6, 1944: the starboard engine of the sole completed McDonnell XP-67 prototype, USAAF serial &quot;42-11677&quot;, caught fire during a test flight. Test pilot E.E. Elliot executed an emergency landing at Lambert Field and escaped, but the fire rapidly spread, destroying the aircraft. This was a crippling setback to the XP-67 program, which had been plagued by delays and technical problems, and the second prototype was only 15% complete, so flight testing could not promptly resume. The United States Army Air Forces deemed the XP-67 unnecessary and canceled the program.
* May 24, 1953: a Meteor Air Transport Douglas DC-3 crashed on approach to the airport, killing six of the seven people on board.
* February 28, 1966: astronauts Elliot See and Charles Bassett – the original crew of the Gemini 9 mission – were killed in the crash of their T-38 trainer while attempting to land at Lambert Field in bad weather. The aircraft crashed into the same McDonnell Aircraft Corporation building (adjacent to the airport) where their spacecraft was being assembled.
* March 20, 1968: a McDonnell F-4 Phantom II jet fighter crashed on takeoff during a test flight. The aircraft pitched up and stalled almost immediately after lifting from the runway; both crewmen were able to eject and were not seriously injured. The aircraft was destroyed in the ensuing explosion and fire. The crash was allegedly caused by a wrench socket, mistakenly left in the cockpit by maintenance crews, becoming lodged inside the control stick well on takeoff, jamming the stick in the full aft position.
* March 27, 1968: Ozark Air Lines Flight 965, a Douglas DC-9-15, collided with a Cessna 150F on a local training flight approximately north of the airport while both aircraft were on approach to runway 17. The Cessna was destroyed and both of its occupants were killed. The DC-9 sustained light damage and was able to land safely; none of its 44 passengers or five crewmembers were injured. The accident was attributed to inadequate visual flight rules (VFR) procedures in place at the airport, the failure of the DC-9 crew to spot the other aircraft in time, the Cessna crew&#x27;s deviation from their traffic pattern instructions, and poor communications between the Cessna pilots and air traffic control.
* July 23, 1973: while on the approach to land at St. Louis International Airport, Ozark Air Lines Flight 809 crashed near the University of Missouri – St. Louis, killing 38 of the 44 persons on board. Wind shear was cited as the cause. A tornado had been reported at Ladue, Missouri, about the time of the accident but the National Weather Service did not confirm that there was a tornado.
* July 6, 1977: a Fleming International Airways Lockheed L-188 Electra, a cargo flight, crashed during the takeoff roll; all three occupants were killed.
* January 9, 1984: Douglas DC-3 registration C-GSCA of Skycraft Air Transport crashed on take-off, killing one of its two crew members. The aircraft was on an international cargo flight to Toronto Pearson International Airport, Canada. Both engines lost power shortly after take-off. The aircraft had been fueled with jet fuel instead of avgas.
* April 8, 1990: A Missouri Air National Guard F-4 Phantom II veered off the runway during takeoff, crashed, and burst into flames. The pilot suffered minor injuries after his ejection seat failed to deploy and he was forced to exit the burning wreckage while the weapons officer fractured his left leg when he ejected from the aircraft.
* November 22, 1994: TWA Flight 427 collided with a Cessna 441 Conquest, registration N441KM, at the intersection of runway 30R and taxiway Romeo. The TWA McDonnell Douglas MD-82 was taking off for Denver and had accelerated through when the collision occurred. The MD-82 sustained substantial damage during the collision. The Cessna 441, operated by Superior Aviation, was destroyed. The pilot and the passenger were killed. The investigation found the Cessna 441 had entered the wrong runway for its takeoff.
* September 28, 2007: American Airlines Flight 1400, an MD-82 from Lambert-St. Louis International Airport to O&#x27;Hare International Airport, suffered an engine fire on the left engine right after takeoff, and a partial hydraulic and electrical failure. The aircraft returned to Lambert-St Louis after a go-around where a successful emergency landing was made, after the nose gear had to be extended by the emergency landing gear extension procedure. No injuries were reported among the 138 passengers and crew, although the aircraft was substantially damaged. During the investigation it was determined that the captain and ground crew had started the engine using an unapproved method.
*February 12th, 2025: United Airlines Flight 4427, a Bombardier CRJ-550 from Washington-Dulles International Airport suffered a runway excursion while landing on Runway 11. There were no injuries.

<text>Violeta Barrios Torres de Chamorro (; 18 October 1929) is a Nicaraguan former politician who served as the 55th President of Nicaragua from 1990 to 1997. She was the first woman to hold the position of president of Nicaragua. Previously, she was a member of the Junta of National Reconstruction (, JGRN) from 1979 to 1980.

Born into a landed family in southern Nicaragua, Chamorro was partially educated in the United States. After returning to her home country, she married and raised a family. Her husband, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal, was a journalist working at his family&#x27;s newspaper, &quot;La Prensa&quot;, which he later inherited. As a result of his anti-government stance, he was often jailed or exiled, forcing Chamorro to spend a decade following him abroad or visiting him in jail. When he was assassinated in 1978, Chamorro took over the newspaper. Pedro&#x27;s murder strengthened the Nicaraguan Revolution and his image, as wielded by his widow, became a powerful symbol for the opposition forces.

Initially, when the Sandinistas were victorious over Anastasio Somoza Debayle, Chamorro fully supported them. She agreed to become part of the provisional government established under the Junta of National Reconstruction. However, when the Junta began moving in a more radical direction and signed agreements with the Soviet Union, Chamorro resigned on 19 April 1980 and returned to the newspaper.

Under her direction, &quot;La Prensa&quot; continued to criticize the government and its policies despite threats and government-forced shutdowns. When Daniel Ortega announced that elections would be held in 1990, Chamorro was selected as the candidate for the opposition group known as the National Opposition Union (, UNO). This 14-party alliance ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists and because of ideological differences had difficulty in devising any political platform other than a promise to end the war. Despite polls indicating a victory for the incumbent Sandinista President Ortega, Chamorro won the election on 25 February 1990. She was the first elected female head of state in the Americas. She was also the second female to be elected in her own right as a head of government in the Americas, after Prime Minister Eugenia Charles of Dominica.

Chamorro was sworn into office on 25 April 1990. Chamorro&#x27;s leadership covered six difficult years marked by economic strife and social unrest, but she was able to compromise with rivals, maintain a constitutional regime, re-establish international banking relationships and end the hyperinflation that had plagued the country for several years.

After leaving office on 10 January 1997, Chamorro worked on several international peace initiatives until poor health forced her to retire from public life.

== Early life ==
Violeta Barrios Torres was born on 18 October 1929 in Rivas, a small city near the Nicaraguan border with Costa Rica, to Carlos José Barrios Sacasa and Amalia Torres Hurtado. Her family was wealthy and conservative, and although she has often been claimed by the U.S. media to be part of the Nicaraguan aristocracy, in truth, her family had large landholdings and cattle; they were more akin to the cattle barons of the western United States than the &quot;Nicaraguan Gloria Vanderbilt&quot; she was sometimes styled as in the American press.

She attended primary school at the Sagrado Corazón de Jesús (Sacred Heart of Jesus) school in Rivas and the French school in Granada. Barrios began her secondary education at the Colegio La Inmaculada in Managua and then transferred to an American boarding school, as her parents wanted her to perfect her English. She first attended Our Lady of the Lake Catholic High School for Girls in San Antonio, Texas, and then in 1945 changed to Blackstone College for Girls in Virginia. In June 1947, her father was diagnosed with terminal lung cancer and though he died before she could make it home, she returned to Nicaragua, without graduating in the United States.

== Personal life ==
Violeta met Pedro Joaquín Chamorro Cardenal in 1949, they married in December 1950; subsequently, they had five children together. In 1952, on his father&#x27;s death, Chamorro&#x27;s husband inherited the newspaper &quot;La Prensa&quot;. He took over publishing and under his direction, the paper became a voice of opposition to the Somoza regime. Chamorro Cardenal was frequently jailed between 1952 and 1957 for the content of the paper and in 1957 led a revolt against Somoza. His actions resulted in his exile to Costa Rica, where Chamorro joined him after settling their children with his mother. Two years were spent in Costa Rica, with Pedro writing against the regime and immediately upon their return he was jailed again. Chamorro&#x27;s life throughout the 1960s and 1970s was a repetitive cycle of reunions with either her husband or children. She followed him; if he was forced to leave, she left the children with family and traveled to be with him; if he was jailed, she was reunited with the children and visited him. Chamorro&#x27;s earnings from a rental property that her mother had given her gave the couple a steady income. When her husband was assassinated on 10 January 1978, she took over control of the newspaper.

Over the years, Chamorro&#x27;s family has been split into feuding factions based upon political association. Two of her children, Pedro and Cristiana, worked at &quot;La Prensa&quot;, although Pedro left Nicaragua in 1984 to join the Contras. Her other children were active Sandinistas; Claudia was ambassador to Costa Rica and Carlos became the editor of the FSLN daily newspaper &quot;Barricada&quot;. In spite of the conflicting political views of her children, Chamorro encouraged and hosted family dinners during which she insisted political affiliations were temporarily put aside in the interest of family harmony.

== Rise to power ==
The assassination of Chamorro&#x27;s husband sparked the Sandinista Revolution. His image became a symbol of their cause and when Daniel Ortega led the Sandinista guerrillas triumphantly into Managua in July 1979, Chamorro was with them. A coalition to replace the Somoza regime was formed. Chamorro, represented the Democratic Union of Liberation (, UDEL) in the first Junta of National Reconstruction (, JGRN), which also included Ortega for the Sandinista National Liberation Front (, FSLN); Moisés Hassan Morales, of the pro-Sandinista National Patriotic Front (, FPN); Luis Alfonso Robelo Callejas, with the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement (, MDN); and Sergio Ramirez Mercado for the Group of Twelve (). This directorate, which initially promised an independent judiciary, free elections, free enterprise and a free press, was assisted by an 18-member Cabinet and a 33-member Council, whose membership represented a broad spectrum of Nicaraguan society. After the civil war of 1978–1979 and last-minute transferring of the national treasury to foreign banks by the Somoza regime, the country was devastated and it was believed that a Marxist-style government would restore prosperity; however, the Sandinistas soon began taking over television and radio stations and censoring newspapers. Following the lead of the Sandinista&#x27;s mentor Fidel Castro, Cuban-style Marxism was implemented and Nicaragua increasingly took on the traits of a police state, in some respects. In others, while the Sandinistas did increase their ties with the Soviet bloc and embraced Marxist philosophy, they announced a non-alignment policy and continued discussions on diplomatic, economic, and military relationships with the United States.

In February 1980, FSLN signed several accords with the Soviet Union causing the US president, Jimmy Carter, who had initially authorized aid to the Sandinista government, to approve CIA support for the opposition forces. On 19 April 1980, Chamorro resigned from the Junta in opposition to the Sandinista&#x27;s push for control, implementation of a Cuban interpretation of Marx, and failure to keep the commitments made in Puntarenas, Costa Rica for establishment of a democracy. Her exit prompted other members of the Junta to resign and join opposition groups that were beginning to form. She returned to her role as editor of &quot;La Prensa&quot;, driving it to become both an advocate of free speech and opposition thought. Her support of the Contras caused divisions in her own family and resulted in &quot;La Prensa&quot;″s offices being temporarily shut down on several occasions. In 1986, President Ortega even threatened her personally with a thirty-year prison sentence for treason. That same year, she won the Louis Lyons Award from the Nieman Foundation at Harvard University; the award citation said that she had &quot;resisted repression and censorship&quot; and remained dedicated to a free press despite threats, redactions and suppression by the government.

From 1987, a conglomerate of 14 political parties began working together in the hope of defeating the Sandinistas should an election come about. By 1989, efforts by Costa Rican President Óscar Arias and other Central American leaders had persuaded Ortega to hold elections. He agreed not only to free elections, but to the monitoring of the process. The conglomerate of opposition, now calling itself the National Opposition Union (, UNO) agreed upon a formula to select a consensus candidate. After five rounds of voting, Chamorro was appointed the presidential candidate for UNO. Her platform primarily consisted of two key promises: ending the civil war and ending mandatory military service. It also played heavily on her simplicity, her faith, common sense, and the image of her being the &quot;queen-mother&quot; and the wife of a martyr.

Almost all news outlets reported that Chamorro could not win. She was depicted as rich with no real experience. There were rumors that she received millions from the United States via their embassy and that she was a US lackey; that she was too religious; and that her coalition was too disorganized, had no money, and was plagued by in-fighting. In reality, her humility and provincial roots worked for her; she had run a family, a business and been part of the original Junta; the Sandinistas blocked payment of funds to her from the US while simultaneously claiming she received them; and she had long been vocal about her displeasure of US involvement in Nicaragua. According to Peruvian novelist Mario Vargas Llosa; Humberto Belli, an editor of &quot;La Prensa&quot; and later Minister of Education; and other writers such as Edward Sheehan and Shirley Christian who have written about the country, Nicaragua is one of the most religious countries in Latin America. Chamorro&#x27;s faith and support for free expression united those who had felt alienated by the Sandinistas. Her chief appeal though was that she promised peace to a country tired of war. Ortega spent large sums of money, and strutted around like a &quot;macho rooster&quot;, as if the election were already won; he even used a fighting rooster as the symbol of his campaign.

The United States government was convinced Chamorro could not win without measures to &quot;level the field&quot;. The George H. W. Bush administration wanted Congress to waive the prohibition of using National Endowment for Democracy funds to support a candidate and to approve a $9 million aid plan in addition to granting $3 million outright in assistance to UNO. Congress refused, as direct aid to candidates or parties was prohibited by law. Congress finally agreed to the $9 million package, only as per the legal requirements—meaning funds could only be used for election monitoring and observers, drives to increase voter turnout and must be fully disclosed. These funds were earmarked for building voting infrastructure, for vehicles and gasoline, salaries, poll watchers, office equipment, trips abroad to train poll workers and those registering voters, election monitoring teams, and as per the provision of foreign donations, $2 million was paid into the Nicaraguan Supreme Electoral Council run by the government. In addition, the CIA covertly paid close to $500,000 (USD) to nearly a hundred Nicaraguans living abroad so they would return home to vote. The aid package ran into difficulties though: one month before the elections, only $400,000 of the money had been sent and it was deposited in accordance with Nicaraguan law into an account at the government-run Central Bank. The vehicles which were provided for in the aid package arrived in Nicaragua, but due to the customs director&#x27;s vacation, the vehicles were not cleared, nor were tags issued for their use. Three weeks before the election, UNO officials reportedly had received only around $250,000 and accused Ortega&#x27;s administration of delaying tactics and taking a share off the top. The government countered that the history of the Iran–Contra affair was a basis for caution and that the US itself was creating delays. Since the United States invasion of Panama had frozen Panamanian currency, a spokesperson for the Central Bank of Nicaragua stated that the Ortega Administration had no access to their funds which were deposited in Panamanian banks.
Up to 1990, Nicaragua had lived with forty years of the Somoza dictatorship, through a decade of civil warfare and Sandinista rule, and five years of US imposed economic sanctions. On 25 February 1990, Chamorro won the election with a 54.7% share of the vote, ousting the incumbent Ortega and becoming the first elected woman president in the Americas. Because the election was held in the midst of a civil war, it was important both domestically and internationally that the vote was seen to be legitimate. The Esquipulas Peace Agreement which had been brokered by Arias, called for monitoring of elections by the Organization of American States and the United Nations, among other provisions. The election was the most strictly monitored of any in Latin America and involved 2,578 international observers among them former US President Jimmy Carter; Raul Alfonsín, former President of Argentina; Alfonso López Michelsen, former President of Colombia; Rodrigo Carazo Odio, former President of Costa Rica and many Caribbean and US dignitaries. Ortega and his supporters conceded defeat without argument and observers left only a skeleton staff to assist with the transition of power.

In the resulting February 1990 elections, Violeta Chamorro and her party the UNO won an upset victory of 55% to 41% over Daniel Ortega. Opinion polls leading up to the elections divided along partisan lines, with 10 of 17 polls analyzed in a contemporary study predicting an UNO victory while seven predicted the Sandinistas would retain power.

Possible explanations include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government, as economic mismanagement, a US embargo, and increased Contra activities in 1987 had, by 1990, decreased per capita GNI to 20 year lows. By November 1989, the White House had announced that the US economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless Violeta Chamorro won. Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras, with a Canadian observer mission claiming that 42 people were killed by the contras in &quot;election violence&quot; in October 1989. This led many commentators to assume that Nicaraguans voted against the Sandinistas out of fear of a continuation of the contra war and economic deprivation.

== Presidency (1990–1997) ==
Two months after the election, on 25 April 1990, Chamorro was sworn into office. The ceremony, held at the Rigoberto López Pérez Stadium before a crowd of some 20,000, marked the first time in more than five decades that a sitting government had peacefully surrendered power to the opposition. It was also the first time governmental change had been the result of a free election with substantial popular participation. With the exception of the promise to end the war, Chamorro did not present a political platform. UNO had been unable to agree on specifics, as its membership ranged from the far left to the far right, making their plan one of running against whatever the Sandinistas were for.

Social scientists who analyzed the elections, concluded that the results were rational in the context that ending the war would also end the psychological threat that the US, which had recently invaded Panama and had been deeply involved in Nicaragua, might invade the country. Sandinistan analysts confirmed these findings, determining that they had lost touch with what their constituency wanted. Marvin Ortega, who had conducted polls prior to the election, conceded that voters did not vote &quot;with their stomachs&quot;, even though the economic situation was dire, but voted against war and the repression of their liberties.

=== Peace reforms ===
Chamorro&#x27;s peace reforms are perhaps her most enduring legacy. Most noteworthy was her official declaration of the end of the war, as it was the pivot upon which all of her other policies depended. She maintained peace by reducing the size and power of the military, ending the national draft, and demobilizing the military. The day she took office, she abolished military conscription and within a few weeks had reduced the size of the army by half. Demobilization included disbanding the US-backed Contras, thereby leaving the Sandinistas with no one to fight, and creating a highly effective peace. Chamorro also granted unconditional amnesties for political crimes, resulting in little room for protest from the Sandinistas, and enabling a smooth transition of power. One of the ways she accomplished the co-operation of the Contras was to seek help openly from local officials in collecting weapons from both sides of the conflict. She began a fierce weapon-buying campaign to help eradicate the threat of continuing violence; all the collected weapons were covered in concrete at the Plaza de la Paz (Peace Square), specifically built in downtown Managua to symbolize &quot;Never Again&quot;.

 The downside of demobilization was that around 70,000 military personnel were left unemployed. Most of the conscripts returned home, but the lives of career military personnel were disrupted as they lost employment, and the houses, land, and money which was promised to them was either not delivered, due to inadequate resources, or seemed to be paid arbitrarily. Since only 5.8% of the former officers had received benefits by early 1992, many believed that only those who had political favor had either kept their jobs, in the 14% of the military that was retained, or received their promised compensation. Between April and December 1992, veterans held a series of strikes in protest of the situation. Pockets of army veterans (&quot;recompas&quot;) and resistance veterans (&quot;recontras&quot;) threatened to re-arm but, realizing they had the same issues, the two sides joined forces. To pacify the groups, Chamorro integrated some of the former Contra fighters into the rural police services; she established a Civil Inspectorate to investigate claims of police abuses and human rights violations. She also allowed the Sandinistas&#x27; agrarian reform movement&#x27;s redistribution of land to be maintained and expanded it on the Caribbean coast to meet veterans&#x27; demands. That action created conflict with the Caribbean indigenous people who had claims to the land, and also infringed on forestry reserves, leading to criticism. Others who had received land from the Sandinistas began to return their co-operative land titles to the large landholders who had owned them before the reforms, or simply sold their portions to opportunists. Unable to solve the problem, Chamorro dealt with the most egregious claims and turned the issue over to the courts to resolve individual disputes.

From the outset, Chamarro performed a delicate balancing act. Her choice to lead the Assembly, , was rejected by the UNO vote, which chose Miriam Argüello. Chamorro kept her word to accept the vote. Her Vice President-elect Virgilio Godoy was in favor of hard-line policies to exclude the Sandinistas, but Chamorro retained Daniel Ortega&#x27;s brother, Humberto Ortega, as a military leader. She claimed the position of Defense Minister and named Humberto Ortega to second-in-command as the Chief of Staff. For this, Chamorro&#x27;s critics accused her of supporting the Sandinistas, but it proved to be a valuable political move. The president demonstrated that, for the good of the nation, she was willing to compromise in ways that fostered reconciliation. She also appointed three FSLN cabinet members, including one for agrarian reform.

=== US relations ===
When Chamorro was elected, President George H. W. Bush removed the embargo that Ronald Reagan had imposed during Sandinista rule and promised economic aid to the country. In addition, the United States paid off the past-due debts of Nicaragua that were owed to private banks, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. Some people in Chamorro&#x27;s campaign team were hoping to get $1 billion in aid from the United States to help rebuild the country after the years of civil war, but the Bush administration instead gave $300 million to the country in the first year of Chamorro&#x27;s presidency, 1990, and $241 million the year after. Given the devastation that Nicaragua had faced, this aid was not enough to make any serious improvement, and the renegotiated loans created even more debt.

During Chamorro&#x27;s presidency, US interest in Nicaragua declined, to the point that when Chamorro traveled to the US in April 1991 to ask Congress for more economic aid, few members showed up to listen to her. Because the Sandinistas were no longer a threat and peace talks were being established, US foreign policymakers were much less concerned with Nicaragua than with issues in the Middle East. Hoping to improve relations, Chamorro&#x27;s administration repealed the law that required the country to seek compensation in the case of &quot;Nicaragua v. United States,&quot; which had long been contentious, and withdrew the suit. The United States had refused to recognise the judgment of the International Court of Justice, which had found five years earlier that the US had violated international law by sponsoring the Contras and ordered it to make reparations.

In 1992, Senator Jesse Helms attempted to cut off financial aid to Nicaragua. In his report to the Senate, he said that the Sandinistas were still controlling much of the Nicaraguan administration and suggested that the Nicaraguan government replace all former Sandinista officers with ex-Contras, replace all judges, and return all property that was taken from US citizens during the revolution. Chamorro&#x27;s administration denied Helms&#x27; allegations while still trying to comply with his demands. Helms managed to sway opinion in Congress, and the US government denied Nicaragua the $104 million that had been promised for that year. The aid was cut off and Helms&#x27; demands were made the month after Chamorro withdrew the compensation claims associated with the &quot;Nicaragua vs. United States&quot; verdict.

=== Economic stability ===
Chamorro inherited an economy devastated by civil war and which had been struggling with hyperinflation since 1988. Chamorro&#x27;s administration immediately set about trying to eliminate inflation. The neoliberal model outlined in the Mayorga Plan attempted to re-integrate Nicaragua into the world market, increase foreign investment while reducing foreign dependence, and increase privatization. First the government combined state enterprises into a holding company known as the Corporaciones Nacionales del Sector Público (CORNAP) and set about privatizing them. The goal was to raise capital by privatizing 90% of the CORNAP companies by 1993, but the response was slow. Next, the administration introduced the &quot;córdoba oro,&quot; which put Nicaraguan currency on par with the US dollar, but confidence in the new currency was never attained. One third of it was returned to the bank in exchange for US funds. Devaluing the currency and ending subsidies of basic consumer goods reduced government spending, but created unrest with lower-middle-class and working-class people, who were faced with rising prices, layoffs due to privatization, and stagnant wages.

In the opening months of the Chamorro administration, social programs were cut, including free bus tokens for the education sector, pensions for the elderly and disabled, child care and child development services, and health care initiatives. By 1991 the austerity measures adopted by Chamorro&#x27;s administration were leading to massive strikes. Chamorro chose to recognize the workers&#x27; right to 25% of the shares of privatized state enterprises, despite the disapproval that generated both at home and abroad. The Sandinistas, who had removed some of the businesses from the private sector during their administration, were not in favor of privatization, but they were in favor of workers sharing in the revenues. The far-right of her own coalition was against making labor compromises of any kind. The US embassy and United States Agency for International Development both voiced displeasure at the concessions and speed with which the economic plan was being implemented.

In spite of the other programs implemented, inflation was reduced by the renegotiation of the country&#x27;s debt (called for by the Lacayo Plan). Through negotiations, Nicaragua was able to obtain a writedown of 75% of their international debt on the condition that they had no arrears.

As noted previously, the US assisted Nicaragua in paying off the past-due debt to the IMF, the World Bank and the Inter-American Development Bank through bridge loans, and negotiating a 95% writedown of debts owed to Colombia, Mexico, and Venezuela. These measures provided the means to end hyperinflation and reopen monetary markets, but they were overshadowed by high unemployment, underemployment and an overall recession. The trade deficit rose and GNP declined, and overall low wages and reductions of education and health services caused poverty to escalate, and social tensions to rise.

Violeta Chamorro&#x27;s years in power began a period of significant economic and social decline for Nicaragua. From 1990 to 2001, the country fell from 60th to 116th place in the world for human development, as measured by the Human Development Index, and became the poorest country in the Americas after Haiti, according to the UNDP. Public spending per capita on health fell from $35 in 1989 to $14 in 1995. Medical assistance for childbirth and diagnosis of female cancers have been reduced. Child development centers established in the 1980s—which served 75,000 children—have been eliminated. Life expectancy dropped from 66 years in 1989 to 60 years in 1996 due to an increase in infectious diseases and malnutrition. Infant mortality rose from 58 per 1,000 in 1990 to 72 per 1,000 in 1995. Salvador Martí i Puig and Eduardo Baumeister indicate that between 1993 and 1998 rural poverty declined by 7% from 1,553,000 to 1,517,000.

=== Constitutional crisis ===
Besides the economic issues which plagued the country, the constitutional crisis that occurred in 1995 posed a significant threat to maintaining peace. When Chamorro took office, she was governing under the Constitution of 1987, which had been drafted by the Sandinistas and provided for a strong executive branch and a weaker, compliant legislature and judiciary. In 1993, the legislature began to review the constitution to restructure the country&#x27;s government. After a year of discussion, the changes were submitted to the National Assembly, approved in the first round of voting, and passed in February 1995. The reforms to the Constitution were intended to reduce of the power of the presidency, and included measures to transfer the authority to levy taxes to the legislature, prohibit conscription, guarantee property rights, and curtail the succession of an incumbent or their close family members. Chamorro refused to publish the changes in &quot;La Gaceta&quot; (the official journal of the legislature), stating that the legislature had overstepped its authority.

In response, the legislature published the revisions on its own, effectively creating a situation of dual constitutions. As there was not a quorum, the Supreme Court was unable to act. To solve the situation, the legislators appointed six new justices, but the Court still refused to act, as doing so would be to accept the appointments and thus validate the new constitution. Chamorro choreographed a ruling from the Supreme Court which voided the Assembly&#x27;s publication of the reforms, provoking the Assembly to refuse to acknowledge the Court&#x27;s authority. As international investors began to fret over the ensuing instability and evaluate further aid, the Roman Catholic cardinal, Miguel Obando y Bravo, stepped in as mediator and brokered an accord. Chamorro agreed to publish the new constitution, as required by law, and the Assembly agreed to allow the president to continue to negotiate foreign aid and tax measures, though no longer by decree. One of the most contentious provisions, which banned nepotism, was conceded by Chamorro. Both sides claimed victory, though the Supreme Court issue was still not resolved: the Assembly insisted their appointees were valid and the President refused to acknowledge them.

As in other crises, Chamorro&#x27;s ability to compromise was pivotal. The executive and legislative branches became more interdependent, but power was shared. The National Assembly prepared the budget, but the president had to be consulted on taxation; Supreme Court vacancies had to be agreed on by both of the other branches of government; and although the president retained the power of veto, the legislature could overturn a veto by a simple majority vote. Though some of the changes also included reform of the Code of Criminal Procedures—creating trial by jury, expanding the right of citizens to press charges, and evaluating police authority, among others—failure of the government to investigate past abuses by the police and the military or institute judicial proceedings, granted tacit impunity for those who committed human rights abuses or violence. Though the 1990 Amnesty Law had curtailed some of administration&#x27;s ability to prosecute, it also lacked the funds, impartial judiciary and possibly the will to seek transitional justice. Sofía Montenegro, editor of the Sandinistan paper &quot;Barricada,&quot; and others have argued that Chamorro would have dealt with past abuse if she could have. Bishop Bernardo Hombach and others believe that her faith would have required her to forgive. Prosecutions would have prolonged conflict and harsh retaliation by the government would not have produced the reconciliation and peace she desired.

=== Gender consequences ===
Though 15 delegates of her parliament (16%) were women, few advances in women&#x27;s rights were made during Chamorro&#x27;s administration. Chamorro was not a feminist, since her beliefs prevented her from advocating many of the goals of traditional feminism. She was against abortion and questioned cohabitation, contraception and divorce. Cutbacks in public services during her regime, like child care and centers for rehabilitation, led to an increase in low-income women being forced into prostitution and crime. According to a United Nations study, the financial insecurity forced women and adolescents into &quot;street professions&quot;, elevating security risks and increasing the rate of drop outs, drug abuse, juvenile delinquency and prostitution. In addition, austerity measures that eliminated free health care made it difficult for the poor to afford care. The Sandinista Workers Central (, CST) stepped in to offer health care and child care to women who could not afford the new government plan. Chamorro did support women&#x27;s rights to become property holders, and saw such ownership as a protection when divorce or widowhood deprived women of a husband&#x27;s support. Her administration did not actively prepare or encourage women&#x27;s participation in political life, nor did she appoint women to governmental positions.

The economic policies adopted by Chamorro feminized Nicaragua&#x27;s labor force. While men&#x27;s employment rate between 1977 and 1985 remained constant at 68%, women&#x27;s employment outside the home in Nicaragua steadily increased during the same time frame with no reduction in the expectations of simultaneous work within the home. Women&#x27;s participation in the labor market increased from 26.7% in 1977 to 32% in 1985 and by 1995 was at 36%, one of the highest participation rates in Central America. Though Chamorro&#x27;s policies changed the nature of the formal work force by introducing more women, the policies did not result in corresponding income increases: wages remained stagnant and changed little over the decade.

The 1992 Sexual Crime Code modifications resulted in winners and losers. Previously, the Penal Code had the penalty for rape specified as 8 to 12 years in prison (compared to 6 to 14 for simple homicide). However, it also defined some lesser sexual crimes in a way designed to protect the interests of fathers and husbands more than of the women themselves; for example, the penalty for &quot;kidnapping of a virgin [...] when her guardians were away or without violence&quot; depended on whether marriage was intended. Victoria González-Rivera writes that prior to the 1992 changes, rape had been considered a private affair, and the law encouraged women to marry their rapists or accept a monetary settlement. UNO women and FSLN women in the National Assembly joined forces after Chamorro won the election and formed a Commission on Women, Youth, Children and the Family; they began to discuss reform of the sexual crimes law. Convincing 18 bipartisan legislators to introduce a reform, they asked for increasing penalties for rape (to 15 to 20 years), decriminalization for abortion if the pregnancy was the result of rape, and decriminalization of consensual sodomy. When the final bill passed, the approved version eliminated the exception for abortion for rape victims. Not only did it not decriminalize sodomy, but it increased the scope of the existing law to include &quot;inducing, promoting or propagandizing&quot; homosexual conduct. The new anti-sodomy law was the most repressive law of its type in Latin America, changing the imposed sentence for &quot;anyone who induces, promotes, propagandizes, or practices sex among persons of the same sex in a scandalous manner&quot; to as much as three years in prison. Chamorro rejected calls to veto the law and sent it for publication in &quot;La Gaceta&quot;, a legal requirement for a statute to become law. Lawyers immediately challenged the constitutionality of the law, but on 7 March 1994 the Supreme Court rejected their challenge.

== Post-presidency ==
Chamorro retired from politics after her presidential term ended in 1997; at the time, the Nicaraguan Constitution did not allow presidents to run for immediate reelection. In July of the same year, she established a foundation bearing her name () which she chaired with the goal of creating developmental projects to strengthen peace initiatives. She joined the Carter Center&#x27;s Council of Presidents and Prime Ministers of the Americas Program which works for co-operation and peace throughout the Americas. Chamorro is also a member of the Inter-American Dialogue.

She suffered from poor health and had several surgeries to correct problems with osteoporosis. During her presidential campaign, she was on crutches most of the time due to a fractured kneecap as a result of her osteoporosis. She later developed a brain tumor, which has kept her out of public life.

<text>Salt Lake City International Airport is a joint civil-military international airport located about west of Downtown Salt Lake City, Utah, United States. The airport, along with the much smaller Provo Airport (PVU) and Ogden–Hinckley Airport (OGD) are the closest commercial airports for more than 3 million people and is within a 30-minute drive of nearly 1.3 million jobs. The airport serves as a hub for Delta Air Lines and is a major gateway to the Intermountain West and West Coast. The airport sees 343 scheduled nonstop airline departures per day to 93 cities in North America and Europe. It is by far the busiest airport in Utah.

Salt Lake City International Airport continues to rank high for on-time departures/arrivals and the fewest flight cancellations among major US airports. The airport ranked first for on-time departures and arrivals and first for the percentage of cancellations as of April 2017. The airport is owned by the City of Salt Lake City and is administered by the municipal Department of Airports.

In 2024, SLC Int&#x27;l Airport set an all-time record with 28,364,610 passengers served, a 5.2% increase from 2023. 

==History==

===1900 to 1940===
In 1911, a site for an air field was chosen on Basque Flats, named for Spanish-French sheep herders who worked the fields in the then-desolate area of the Salt Lake Valley, where a cinder-covered landing was subsequently created. The Great International Aviation Carnival was held the same year and brought aviation pioneers representing Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company and a team representing the Wright Brothers to Salt Lake City. World-famous aviator Glenn H. Curtiss brought his newly invented Seaplane to the carnival, a type of airplane that had never been demonstrated to the public. Curtiss took off from the nearby Great Salt Lake, awing the 20,000 spectators and making international headlines.

For several years, the new field was used mainly for training and aerobatic flights. That would change in 1920 when the United States Postal Service (USPS) began air mail service to Salt Lake City. The city bought a 100-acre tract around Basque Flats for $4,000 and built a field, hangar and other facilities. In the same year, the airfield was given the name Woodward Field, named for John P. Woodward, a local aviator. The first transcontinental air mail flight landed at Woodward Field on September 8.

In 1925, the postal service began awarding contracts to private companies. Western Air Express, the first private company to carry U.S. mail, began flying from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles via Las Vegas. Less than a year later, Western Air Express would begin flying passengers along the same route. Western Air Express later became Western Airlines, which had a large hub in Salt Lake City.

Charles Lindbergh visited Woodward Field in 1927, drawing many spectators to see The Spirit of St. Louis. During the next few years the airport would gain another runway and would span over . In 1930 the airport was renamed Salt Lake City Municipal Airport.

The first terminal and airport administration building was built in 1933 at a cost of $52,000. By then, United Airlines had begun serving Salt Lake City on flights between New York City and San Francisco.

As air travel became more popular and the United States Army Air Forces established a base at the airport during World War II, a third runway was added (Runway diagram for 1955). The April 1957 Official Airline Guide (now OAG) shows 42 weekday departures: 18 on Western, 17 United and 7 Frontier. United had flown nonstop to Chicago since 1950, but nonstop service to New York did not start until 1968. The first jets were United 720s in September 1960.

===1960 terminal===
A new terminal was needed and work began on the west side of the airport on Terminal 1, designed by Brazier Montmorency Hayes &amp; Talbot and dedicated in 1960 after seven years of work and a cost of $8 million. In 1968, the airport became Salt Lake City International Airport when a non-stop route to Calgary, Canada was awarded to Western Airlines.

After airline deregulation in 1978, hub airports appeared. Western Airlines, with ties to Salt Lake City since its inception, increased service into hub status on May 1, 1982.

Terminal 2 was designed by Montmorency Hayes &amp; Talbot and built solely for Western and had several murals by artist LeConte Stewart.

During the 1980s, the airport saw further expansion to both terminals as well as runway extension. In 1987, Western Airlines merged with Delta Air Lines. Salt Lake City would continue to be a major airline hub for Delta.

In 1991, the airport opened a new short-term parking garage. The airport opened a new runway in 1995 along with the International Terminal and E concourse for SkyWest Airlines, which was designed by Gensler. A new control tower, new approach control facility, and a new fire station were opened in 1999.

In 2001, Concourse E was expanded for additional gates and SkyWest Airlines opened its new maintenance hangar and training facility. In 2002, the airport saw heavy crowds as Salt Lake City welcomed over one million visitors for the Winter Olympics.

In June 2008, Delta Air Lines began service to Charles de Gaulle Airport in Paris on a Boeing 767. This was the airport&#x27;s first transatlantic route. Delta also added the first flight from Salt Lake City to Asia, a link to Tokyo&#x27;s Narita Airport, the following June. The service aboard Airbus A330s resulted from Delta&#x27;s merger with Northwest Airlines, which had a hub at Narita. Later that year, Delta made it seasonal. The airline stopped flying to Tokyo in October 2011.

===New terminal and concourses===
The Airport Redevelopment Program broke ground in 2014, initiating construction of the New SLC terminal complex. This began the process of replacing the existing, aging facilities with all new facilities, including a rental car center, a parking garage, a terminal with two linear concourses (similar to Atlanta, Denver and Washington–Dulles) with 93 gates, two tunnels, and an elevated roadway. The construction was funded by airport funds, passenger and customer facility charges, bonds, and federal grants.

The Airport opened Phase 1 of the new terminal in 2020. This first phase consisted of the western portion of concourse A with 25 gates, and the western portion of Concourse B with 21 gates. The concourses were connected by a mid-field underground tunnel. After Concourse B opened, the old terminals and concourses were demolished, and then construction on concourses A and B east began. With the opening of the new airport, Delta Air Lines opened a brand new Sky Club in concourse A, which at the time was the largest in their network. 

Phase 2 of the project included the eastern portion of concourse A with 22 gates and additional concession options. It opened in increments throughout 2023, with the final 13 gates opening on October 31, 2023. 

Phase 3 opened on October 22, 2024 including five additional gates in the eastern portion of concourse B, the Concourse B Plaza, additional concession options and the much anticipated central River Tunnel. The central tunnel, which allows passengers to directly access concourse B from just outside the security checkpoint, will reduce walk times to concourse B by as much as half. The Concourse B Plaza includes the reinstalled floor world map that was featured in the former terminal, as well as a 30-foot-long replica of an allosaurus fossil. 

Future features of Phase 3 will include 5 gates in the eastern portion of concourse B and an additional Delta Sky Club. Phase 4 will include the airport&#x27;s first non-Delta club, a United Airlines club that will be on the far east end of concourse B, as well as the airport&#x27;s only non-airline specific club, an American Express Centurion Lounge. The easternmost 16 gates of concourse B, to be completed in 2026, are also part of Phase 4. Future plans call for adding a tram to the central tunnel when a future concourse C is eventually built. All told, phase 2 through phase 4 are planned to add 48 new gates to the airport.

==Facilities==

The airport covers and has four runways. The runways are generally oriented in a NNW/SSE magnetic direction due to consistent prevailing winds in this direction.

===Terminal===
SLC has a single terminal with two concourses connected by two underground tunnels for a total of 73 gates. There is a single security check point with 16 lanes and 11 baggage carousels, with additional checkpoint and carousel facilities for international arrivals.

* Concourse A has 47 gates, completed October 2023.
* Concourse B has 26 gates, with 21 more opening in phases beginning in 2025.

===Ground transportation===
The airport is accessible from I-80 at exit 115 B or from I-215 at exits 22 and 22 B, with the GA terminal accessible from I-215 exit 23. The airport can also be accessed from North Temple Street and Utah State Route 154 (Bangerter Highway), both of which terminate and merge into the airport&#x27;s Terminal Drive.

Rail and bus services that connect the surrounding region to Salt Lake City International Airport include TRAX light rail service from the Airport station, UTA bus service (via TRAX), and FrontRunner commuter rail (via TRAX).

Ground transportation is available from the airport to ski resorts and locations throughout Salt Lake, Davis, Weber, Utah, and Summit counties. Many Salt Lake taxis, limousines, and shuttles accommodate ski equipment.

===General aviation===
Despite being the 28th busiest airport in the world in terms of aircraft operations, the airport still maintains a large general aviation presence. In 2008, 19% of aircraft movements at the airport came from general aviation traffic. This is in contrast to most large airports, which encourage general aviation aircraft to use smaller or less busy airports in order to prevent delays to commercial traffic. The airport is able to effectively handle both commercial and general aviation traffic largely in part to the airport&#x27;s layout and airspace structure. Nearly all general aviation operations are conducted on the east side of the airport, away from commercial traffic. Additionally, smaller and relatively slower general aviation aircraft arrive and depart the airport in ways that generally do not hinder the normal flow of arriving or departing commercial aircraft.

2021 data shows that there were 337 general aviation aircraft based at the airport. The airport has three fixed-base operators; Signature Flight Support, Atlantic Aviation, and Menzies Aviation located on the east side of the airport. The airport has facilities for air ambulance, law enforcement, as well as state and federal government aircraft. Additionally, the airport is home to several flight training facilities, including one operated by Westminster College.

===Military operations===
The Utah Air National Guard operates what was previously named the Salt Lake City Air National Guard Base on the east side of the airport. In November 2014, the installation was renamed the Roland R. Wright Air National Guard Base after Brigadier General Roland R. Wright, USAF (Ret).

The base occupies approximately 140 acres as a U.S. Government cantonment area leased from the airport. In addition to flight line, the installation comprises 65 buildings: 3 services, 13 administrative, and 47 industrial. There are 255 full-time Air Reserve Technician and Active Guard and Reserve personnel assigned, augmented by 1,343 part-time traditional air national guardsmen. The host wing for the installation is the 151st Wing (151 WG), an Air Mobility Command (AMC)-gained unit operating the KC-135R Stratotanker.

==Accidents and incidents==

* On May 1, 1942, United Airlines Trip 4, a Douglas DC-3 impacted the side of a hill after deviating off course NE of Salt Lake Municipal Airport, all 17 on board were killed.
* On January 17, 1963, a West Coast Airlines Fairchild F-27 on a training flight out and back to SLC crashed west of the airport into Great Salt Lake simulating an emergency descent, all three occupants perished.
* On November 11, 1965, United Airlines Flight 227, operated with a Boeing 727, crashed just short of the runway at Salt Lake City International Airport (then named Salt Lake City Municipal Airport), killing 43 of the 91 people on board.
* On December 16, 1969, an Aero Commander 1121 Jet Commander operated by American Smelting and Refining Co. lifted off prematurely, stalled and crashed. Both occupants died.
* On December 18, 1977, United Airlines Flight 2860, a cargo flight operated with a Douglas DC-8 crashed into a mountain near Kaysville while in a holding pattern prior to landing at Salt Lake City International Airport. The crew was trying to figure out an electrical problem and did not realize they were adjacent to a mountain. All three people on board were killed in the accident.
* On January 15, 1987, Skywest Airlines Flight 1834, a Fairchild Metro, collided with a Mooney M20 at 7000 feet while the Metro was on a runway 34 approach. Both aircraft fell and crashed to the ground. All eight on the Metro and two on the Mooney were killed.
* On October 14, 1989, Delta Air Lines Flight 1554, operated with a Boeing 727, caught fire during the boarding process for a flight to Edmonton, Alberta, Canada while the aircraft was parked at a gate. Of the 22 people who were on the aircraft at the time, five sustained minor injuries. While all passengers and crew evacuated, the aircraft was destroyed. An investigation determined the fire started due to a malfunction with the passenger oxygen system.
* On March 2, 1997, a Beechcraft Super King Air operated by Coast Hotels and Casinos impacted terrain south of SLC. One passenger out of the four on board died.
* On November 16, 2015, three days after the 2015 Paris terror attacks, an Air France Airbus A380 traveling from Los Angeles to Paris was diverted to Salt Lake City International Airport due to a bomb threat on the aircraft. The aircraft was the largest plane to ever land at the airport. The airport workers had only 15 minutes to get ready for the emergency landing.
* On January 18, 2016, two people died when their Cessna 525 private jet crashed shortly after take-off from Salt Lake City International on their way to Tucson International Airport in Tucson, Arizona. 
* On March 30, 2021, a chartered Delta Airlines Boeing 757 carrying the NBA&#x27;s Utah Jazz to Memphis International Airport in Memphis, Tennessee for a game against the Memphis Grizzlies made an emergency landing at SLC after suffering a bird strike shortly after takeoff. The plane suffered damage to an engine but there were no injuries among its occupants.
* On January 1, 2024, a 30-year-old man exited the terminal via an emergency exit following a reported &quot;disturbance&quot; and ran to a deicing area, where he proceeded to crawl into a Delta Airbus A220&#x27;s engine intake. The man was removed from the engine and died on the scene. He apparently had a boarding pass for Denver.

==In popular culture==
In the 1974 film &quot;Airport 1975&quot;, Captain Alan Murdock (played by Charlton Heston) lands a crippled Boeing 747 at SLC which was involved in a midair collision with a Beechcraft Baron which crashed into the cockpit of the 747, killing most of the flight crew. After landing, the aircraft exited the runway but eventually came to a stop. The movie ends with an emergency evacuation of all passengers and crew at the airport. A good portion of the movie was filmed on location at SLC.

Other notable films with scenes shot on location at SLC:

* &quot;Dumb and Dumber&quot; (1994)
* &quot;Unaccompanied Minors&quot; (2006) 
* &quot;Darling Companion&quot; (2012)

<text>The Griffin Poetry Prize is a Canadian poetry award. It was founded in 2000 by businessman and philanthropist Scott Griffin.

Before 2022, two separate awards went to one Canadian and one international poet who writes in the English language. In 2022, the two awards were consolidated into a single international prize of CAD$130,000. Shortlisted poets are awarded CAD$10,000, and a Lifetime Recognition Award comes with an award of CAD$25,000.

Concurrently with the merger, the Griffin Poetry Prize also introduced a juried Canadian First Book Prize to honor the year&#x27;s best debut book by a Canadian poet.

==History==
In April 2000, Scott Griffin started the Griffin Trust to raise public awareness of the crucial role poetry plays in society&#x27;s cultural life. Griffin served as its chairman, with board of trustees Margaret Atwood, Robert Hass, Michael Ondaatje, Robin Robertson, and David Young. In June 2004, Carolyn Forché joined the board. New trustees have been named over the years: in 2014, Karen Solie, Colm Tóibín, and Mark Doty; in 2016, Jo Shapcott and Marek Kazmierski; in 2018, Ian Williams; and in 2020, Sarah Howe. Margaret Atwood, Robert Hass, Michael Ondaatje, Robin Robertson, Jo Shapcott and Colm Tóibín have assumed the role of trustees emeriti. 

The Trust created the Griffin Poetry Prize with the aim of helping to introduce contemporary collections of poetry to the public&#x27;s imagination. Eligible collections of poetry must have been published between January 1 and December 31 of the prior year. Submissions must come from publishers only. Originally, the award was two annual prizes of CAD$40,000 each for collections of poetry published in English during the preceding year. One prize was to go to a living Canadian poet, the other to a living poet from any country, which could include Canada as well. 

Among the trustees’ responsibilities is to select each year’s judges, who select a shortlist announced in April, National Poetry Month. The shortlisted poets then gather for an evening of public readings in May or June; the following evening, the winners are announced and all the poets feted.

In 2010, the total amount of the annual prizes was doubled from CAD$100,000 to CAD$200,000 in recognition of the prize’s tenth anniversary. The increased amount of CAD$200,000 was awarded as follows: CAD$10,000 to each of seven shortlisted poets—four international and three Canadian—for their participation in the shortlist readings. The two winners, announced the next evening at the Griffin Poetry Prize Awards, were given CAD$65,000 each, for a total of CAD$75,000 that included the CAD$10,000 awarded the previous evening.

Selections from the shortlisted works are gathered annually in &quot;The Griffin Poetry Prize Anthology&quot;, typically edited by one of that year&#x27;s judges. In 2019, House of Anansi Press partnered with the National Network for Equitable Library Services (NNELS) to offer the anthology in print and digital Braille editions. 

The Griffin Trust has championed other initiatives. In November 2010, Scott Griffin announced Poetry In Voice/Les voix de la poésie, a bilingual recitation contest for high school students across Canada. Other projects have included funding a statue in tribute to poet Al Purdy, participation in international poetry festivals, and donations of poetry books to organizations such as the Correctional Service of Canada, the Scottish Poetry Library, a rebuilt Slave Lake Public Library (which was destroyed in a wildfire in 2011), and other libraries, schools, and colleges.

In 2022, Griffin Poetry Prize officials announced that the Canadian and international awards would be consolidated into a single award of CAD$130,000. Founder Scott Griffin said he originally believed that Canadian poets needed a separate category, but &quot;now that a lot of Canadians have been recognized in the poetry world, we felt it was time they had to compete on the international stage with everybody else&quot;. The trust also announced a new prize: CAD$10,000 for a debut work of Canadian poetry. Critics from within Canadian poetry expressed concern about loss of opportunities &quot;given the role the award played in securing grants and jobs&quot;. For instance, Alicia Elliot criticized the timing of the change, considering it happened &quot;in the midst of a rather remarkable run for Black poets, Indigenous poets and poets of colour nominated for the Canadian portion&quot; of the prize, and suggested the change implied that Canadian literature &quot;is only relevant and worthwhile if it is being praised internationally.&quot;

In April 2023, Scott Griffin gave an endowment to the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada to expand the prize package for what is now the Latner Griffin Writers&#x27; Trust Poetry Prize.

Prior to 2023, the Griffin Poetry Prize was separated into two categories with prizes specifically for Canadian poets and another for international poets with each winner receiving $65,000. However, in 2023, the Canadian-specific prize was eliminated with only one winner selected each year who wins $130,000.

<doc id="264245" wikidata="Q283530" url="?curid=264245" title="Chinese paper cutting">
<text>The traditional art of paper cutting () in China may date back to the 2nd century CE, when paper was invented by Cai Lun, a court official of the Eastern Han dynasty. On May 20, 2006, paper cutting has been officially listed as one of the earliest intangible cultural heritage of China, issue by Shanxi Culture Department. It is put on the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2009. 

Prior to the invention of paper, ancient Chinese used silver and gold leaf to create similar patterns of decorations. Paper cutting became popular as a way of decorating doors and windows as paper became more accessible. These elaborate cutting designs are created with scissors or artwork knives and can include a variety of shapes, such as symbols and animals. As paper became more affordable in Eastern Han dynasty, paper-cutting became one of the most important types of Chinese folk art. Later, this art form spread to other parts of the world, with different regions adopting their own cultural styles. 

Since the cut-outs are often used to decorate doors and windows, most paper cuts are called &quot;hua&quot;, which means &quot;flower&quot;. &quot;Flower&quot; refers to the meaning of pattern instead of the botanic beauty. For different use of decorations, they are sometimes referred as different &quot;hua&quot;. The paper cuts that used to decorate the window, it is called &quot;window flowers&quot; () or &quot;window paper-cuts&quot;. For those used as sencils for embroidery called &quot;hat flower&quot; (帽花; mao hua), &quot;pillow flower&quot; (枕花; zhen hua), &quot;shoe flower&quot; (鞋花; xie hua). Usually, the artworks are made of red paper, as red is associated with festivities and luck in Chinese culture, but other colours are also used. Normally cut-paper artwork is used on festivals such as Chinese New Year, weddings and childbirth, as cut-paper artwork is considered to symbolize luck and happiness.

==Origin==
Chinese paper-cutting originated from the practice of worship of both ancestors and gods, a traditional part of Chinese culture dating back roughly two millennia. According to archaeological records, paper-cutting originates from the 6th century, although some believe that its history could be traced back as far as the Warring States period (around 3 BC), long before paper was invented. At that time, people used other thin materials, like leaves, silver foil, silk and even leather, to carve negative-space patterns. Currently, the earliest pattern of paper cuts was found in 1959 from a gravesite in Xinjiang region, dating back to the year AD 386 - 581.Later when paper was invented by Cai Lun in the year AD 105, people realized that this material was easy to cut, store and discard, so paper became the major material for this type of artwork.
=== Tang dynasty ===
Although paper was officially invented during the Han dynasty, techniques for cutting and carving thin materials such as gold foil, silk, and leaves were developed for decoration prior to the invention of paper. During the Tang dynasty, paper cutting developed rapidly and became popular in China, which typically combined paper cutting with painting to illustrate spiritual ideas. Paper-cutting as an artform matured during the Tang dynasty, where it became considered not only a type of handicraft, but also a type of artwork, as ideas and concepts were expressed through the pattern cut into the paper.

=== Song dynasty ===
During the Song dynasty, Chinese papercutting developed into a more advanced technique, with trained artisans creating more complex artworks. The technique was used to decorate ceramics and make shadow puppets. By carving patterns onto oily cardboard and scraping patterns onto the fabric, blue-printed fabric came about.

=== Ming and Qing dynasties ===

In the Ming and Qing dynasty (1368-1912), paper-cutting reached a developmental peak and became a more popular Chinese art. Folk paper-cutting spread to a wider range of people and expressed an abundance of artistic expression. It developed a variety of uses, including lantern and fan ornaments, needlework patterns, and window flowers. Paper-cutting was used to decorate doors, windows, and walls, to show happiness and celebrate festivals. The imperial family also utilized papercutting, with the Forbidden City decorated with papercuts during the emperor&#x27;s wedding ceremony. Its continual appeal reflects the Chinese people&#x27;s creativity, with designs expressing cultural ideas and values.

This artistry witnessed its most prosperous period in Ming and Qing dynasties. For over a thousand years, people (mainly women) created cut-paper artworks as a leisure activity, creating different types of paper-cutting and passing this traditional craft onto their children, resulting in the art form becoming more popular. Paper-cutting is still practiced as an art form in modern-day China as a result.

As a material, paper mildews and rots easily. In the southeast of China, where it typically rains in May and June, this causes paper to mildew and rot especially quickly; as a result, people in the southeast typically did not engage in paper-cutting art, making it hard to find cut-paper artworks from previous centuries. In contrast, the weather in the northwest of China is usually dry, making it possible to find cut-paper art made in the Northern dynasties in Turpan, Sinkiang province.

==Style Classification==
Paper-cutting is one of the oldest and the most popular folk arts in China. It can be geographically divided into three main schools. 

* South School (南方剪纸 nán fāng jiǎn zhǐ)

The south school, represented by works from Foshan in Guangdong Province and Fujian Province, features rigorous, decorative and elegant designs. It is varied in its theme choice, among which the gift flowers of Putian are the most special and famous pattern of South School. 

* Jiangzhe School (江浙剪纸 jiāng zhè jiǎn zhǐ)

The Jiangzhe School is originated from the Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces in Eastern China. Representative works are from Yangzhou in Jiangsu Province and Yueqing in Zhejiang Province. features ingenious and beautiful designs, exquisite carving and interesting shapes. It is the most famous internationally. It usually depicts nature theme of flowers, birds, fish and fruits.

* North School (北方剪纸 běi fāng jiǎn zhǐ)

The northern style, mainly from Yuxian and Fengning in Hebei Province, and best represented by works from northern Shaanxi, features exaggerated shapes, vigorousness, vivid depictions and diverse patterns. The style tend to have a relatively simple and symmetrical design, focusing on abstract shapes, animals and patterns. 

==Characteristics==

Chinese papercutting is an art form from the Chinese cultural legacy that displays a wide range of designs, from simple basic designs consisting of a single image to symmetrical, which are created by folding the paper into proportionate portions before cutting, so that when unfolded, it forms a symmetrical design, and are usually folded into an even number, such as twice or four times. Typically, the designs are freeform and depict scenes from daily life.

Red paper is the most prevalent because it is connected with happiness and good fortune in Chinese culture. Thus, it is popularly used to celebrate important events such as weddings and festivals. Paper cutting is consistently evolving and has developed beyond China, with artists developing new techniques and materials to keep this art form alive.

==Uses and Functions==

=== Decorative use ===

Source:

Chinese papercutting is mostly used for decoration nowadays. Many Chinese people decorate their windows with paper cuttings to express enthusiasm for the new season or new year. Paper cuttings are also used in homes to decorate walls, doors, lamps, and lanterns and are often presented as gifts. Furthermore, paper cuttings pasted near entrances symbolize good luck. This traditional habit festively decorates houses and special occasions. Today, paper cuttings are chiefly decorative. They liven up walls, windows, doors, columns, mirrors, lamps and lanterns in homes and are also used on presents or are given as gifts themselves. Paper cut-outs pasted on or near entrances are supposed to bring good luck. Paper cuttings used to be used as patterns, especially for embroidery and lacquer work. Cut-paper artworks are used by young people as a decoration for their kits and books.

Paper-cutting was and is mostly used as a decoration, or an aesthetic way to express people&#x27;s hopes, gratitude and other emotions. The vivid designs depicting on paper-cuttings have different meanings. Some express wishes for a harvest or a wealthy life, shown through the imagery of a golden harvest, thriving domestic animals and plants, as well as good fortunes, a carp jumping over a dragon gate (a traditional Chinese story, indicating a leap towards a better life), polecats, lions, qilins (a mythical Chinese creature), jade rabbits (an animal taken from Chinese legend), pomegranates and peonies. Other designs feature legendary figures, or scenes from traditional myths or stories, such as designs of the Yellow Emperor, the meeting of Cowherd() and Weaver Girl(), and the 24 stories of filial piety. Designs may also show people&#x27;s gratitude towards life, such as paper-cuttings of a doll with two twisted hairs on each side of the head, or fish swimming through lotus plants.

=== Symbolic use ===
The most popular papercutting Chinese characters are the characters 福 (meaning &#x27;lucky&#x27;) and (meaning &#x27;double happiness&#x27;). The character 福 is a symbol of good luck and is often displayed during Chinese New Year celebrations to bring fortune and prosperity for the coming year. The character 囍 is commonly used for weddings, symbolizes double happiness and the hope for a fulfilling marriage. These papercuts are important Chinese cultural symbols and are cherished for their aesthetic beauty.

=== Spiritual use ===

Chinese paper cuttings&#x27; designs are often used to express hopes, appreciation, and other spiritual emotions. Common Chinese papercutting motifs include representations of harvests, animals, and mythical stories such as the carp jumping over the dragon gate. Chinese people express cultural heritage, values, and beliefs through the art of papercutting, making it a significant element of their spiritual expression.

Window paper-cuttings have a close relationship with the beginning of spring, and it is traditional to decorate windows with paper-cuttings to welcome spring. In many areas of China, especially in the north, paper-cuttings are pasted to windows to express happiness for the new season, a tradition that has been practiced since the Song and Yuan dynasties.

=== Educational use ===
Chinese papercutting has educational uses that teach children about traditional Chinese art and culture and the beauty of papercutting while learning Chinese papercutting history. Practicing paper cuts also helps children enhance their fine motor skills, hand-eye coordination, cutting and creativity.

==Construction methods==

Source:

There are two methods of manufacturing Chinese paper-cuttings: one method uses scissors, the other a sharp knife. In the scissor method, several pieces of paper – up to eight – are fastened together, before the motif is then cut with sharp, pointed scissors. Chinese papercutting involves cutting intricate, exquisite designs from a single or multiple layers of paper with scissors or artwork knives. It is passed down through generations because both procedures demand a great deal of talent and skills. The construction methods of papercutting involve several steps, including the selection of paper materials, specifically types and colors depending on the desired effect. The selected paper is then folded multiple times, and the pattern is drawn onto it. Next, cut the design out carefully, either with scissors or an art knife. Finally, the paper cutout is opened up to reveal the exquisite design, which can be further enhanced with additional details such as coloring and shading. The construction of papercutting requires patience, skill, and carefulness, as well as the creativity and artistry of artists.

=== Scissor construction method ===
The scissor construction approach involves taping multiple sheets of paper together and then cutting off the designated shapes using sharp scissors. This cutting of multiple paper layers at the same time enables a more consistent pattern.

=== Knife construction method ===
On the other hand, in the artwork knife construction approach, the design is carved out with a sharp knife, commonly following a pattern, but expert artisans can alternatively cut varied shapes freely. In the knife method, several layers of paper are placed on a relatively soft foundation, consisting of a mixture of tallow and ashes. Following a pattern, the motifs are then cut into the paper with a sharp knife, which is usually held vertically. Skilled artisans can cut different designs freehand, without following a pattern.

<doc id="264246" wikidata="Q504790" url="?curid=264246" title="Nephrotic syndrome">
<text>Nephrotic syndrome is a collection of symptoms due to kidney damage. This includes protein in the urine, low blood albumin levels, high blood lipids, and significant swelling. Other symptoms may include weight gain, feeling tired, and foamy urine. Complications may include blood clots, infections, and high blood pressure.
Causes include a number of kidney diseases such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis, membranous nephropathy, and minimal change disease. It may also occur as a complication of diabetes, lupus, or amyloidosis. The underlying mechanism typically involves damage to the glomeruli of the kidney. Diagnosis is typically based on urine testing and sometimes a kidney biopsy. It differs from nephritic syndrome in that there are no red blood cells in the urine.
Treatment is directed at the underlying cause. Other efforts include managing high blood pressure, high blood cholesterol, and infection risk. A low-salt diet and limiting fluids are often recommended. About 5 per 100,000 people are affected per year. The usual underlying cause varies between children and adults.

==Signs and symptoms==
Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by large amounts of proteinuria (&gt;3.5 g per 1.73 m2 body surface area per day, or &gt; 40 mg per square meter body surface area per hour in children), hypoalbuminemia (&lt; 3.5 g/dl), hyperlipidaemia, and edema that begins in the face. Lipiduria (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome.

A few other characteristics seen in nephrotic syndrome are:
* The most common sign is excess fluid in the body due to serum hypoalbuminemia. Lower serum oncotic pressure causes fluid to accumulate in the interstitial tissues. Sodium and water retention aggravates the edema. This may take several forms:
** Puffiness around the eyes, characteristically in the morning.
** Pitting edema over the legs.
** Fluid in the pleural cavity causing pleural effusion. More commonly associated with excess fluid is pulmonary edema.
** Fluid in the peritoneal cavity causing ascites.
** Generalized edema throughout the body known as anasarca.
* Most of the people with nephrotic syndrome are normotensive but hypertension (rarely) may also occur.
* Anaemia (iron resistant microcytic hypochromic type) may be present due to transferrin loss.
* Dyspnea may be present due to pleural effusion or due to diaphragmatic compression with ascites.
* Erythrocyte sedimentation rate is increased due to increased fibrinogen &amp; other plasma contents.
* Some people may notice foamy or frothy urine, due to a lowering of the surface tension by the severe proteinuria. Actual urinary complaints such as haematuria or oliguria are uncommon, though these are seen commonly in nephritic syndrome.
* May have features of the underlying cause, such as the rash associated with systemic lupus erythematosus, or the neuropathy associated with diabetes.
* Examination should also exclude other causes of gross edema—especially the cardiovascular and liver system.
* Muehrcke&#x27;s nails; white lines (leukonychia) that extend all the way across the nail and lie parallel to the lunula

The main signs of nephrotic syndrome are:
* Proteinuria of greater than 3.5 g /24 h /1.73 m2 (between 3 and 3.5 g/24 h /1.73 m2 is considered to be proteinuria in the nephrotic range) or greater than 40 mg/h/m2 in children. The ratio between urinary concentrations of albumin and creatinine can be used in the absence of a 24-hour urine test for total protein. This coefficient will be greater than 200–400 mg/mmol in nephrotic syndrome. This pronounced loss of proteins is due to an increase in glomerular permeability that allows proteins to pass into the urine instead of being retained in the blood. Under normal conditions a 24-hour urine sample should not exceed 80 milligrams or 10 milligrams per decilitre.
* Hypoalbuminemia of less than 2.5 g/dL, that exceeds the &quot;liver clearance&quot; level, that is, protein synthesis in the liver is insufficient to increase the low blood protein levels.
* Edema is thought to be caused by two mechanisms. The first being hypoalbuminemia which lowers the oncotic pressure within vessels resulting in hypovolemia and subsequent activation of the renin–angiotensin system and thus retention of sodium and water (underfill hypothesis). Additionally, it is thought that urinary proteases (excreted as a result of significant proteinuria) cause a direct effect by activating the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the principal cell that leads to the reabsorption of sodium and water (overfill hypothesis). Nephrotic syndrome edema initially appears in parts of the lower body (such as the legs) and in the eyelids. In the advanced stages it also extends to the pleural cavity and peritoneum (ascites) and can even develop into a generalized anasarca.
* Hyperlipidaemia in nephrotic syndrome is typically caused by two mechanisms. First, hypoproteinemia stimulates protein synthesis in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of low and very-low-density lipoproteins. There is also an increase in the liver synthesis of cholesterol. Second, lipid catabolism is decreased due to lower levels of lipoprotein lipase, the main enzyme involved in lipoprotein breakdown. Cofactors, such as apolipoprotein C2, may also be lost by increased filtration of proteins.
* Thrombophilia, or hypercoagulability, is a greater predisposition for the formation of blood clots that are caused by a decrease in the levels of antithrombin III in the blood due to its loss in urine.
* Lipiduria or loss of lipids in the urine is indicative of glomerular pathology due to an increase in the filtration of lipoproteins.

=== Complications ===
Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with a series of complications that can affect an individual&#x27;s health and quality of life:
* Thromboembolic disorders: particularly those caused by a decrease in blood antithrombin III levels due to leakage. Antithrombin III counteracts the action of thrombin. Thrombosis usually occurs in the kidney veins although it can also occur in arteries. Treatment is with oral anticoagulants (not heparin as heparin acts via anti-thrombin 3 which is lost in the proteinuria so it will be ineffective.) Hypercoagulopathy due to extravasation of fluid from the blood vessels (edema) is also a risk for venous thrombosis.
* Infections: The increased susceptibility of people with nephrotic syndrome to infections can be a result of the leakage of immunoglobulins from the blood, the loss of proteins in general, and the presence of oedematous fluid (which acts as a breeding ground for infections). The most common infection is peritonitis, followed by lung, skin, and urinary infections, meningoencephalitis and in the most serious cases septicaemia. The most notable of the causative organisms are &quot;Streptococcus pneumoniae&quot; and &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot;.
* Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis can develop where there is ascites present. This is a frequent development in children but very rarely found in adults.
* Acute kidney failure due to hypovolemia: the loss of vascular fluid into the tissues (edema) produces a decreased blood supply to the kidneys that cause a loss of kidney function. Thus it is a tricky task to get rid of excess fluid in the body while maintaining circulatory euvolemia.
* Pulmonary edema: the loss of proteins from blood plasma and the consequent fall in oncotic pressure causes an abnormal accumulation of liquid in the lungs causing hypoxia and dyspnoea.
* Hypothyroidism: deficiency of the thyroglobulin transport protein thyroxin (a glycoprotein that is rich in iodine and is found in the thyroid gland) due to decreased thyroid-binding globulin.
* Vitamin D deficiency can occur. Vitamin D binding protein is lost.
* Hypocalcaemia: lack of 25-hydroxycholecalciferol (the way that vitamin D is stored in the body). As vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium present in the blood, a decrease in its concentration will lead to a decrease in blood calcium levels. It may be significant enough to cause tetany. Hypocalcaemia may be relative; calcium levels should be adjusted based on the albumin level and ionized calcium levels should be checked.
* Microcytic hypochromic anaemia: iron deficiency caused by the loss of ferritin (compound used to store iron in the body). It is iron-therapy resistant.
* Protein malnutrition: this occurs when the amount of protein that is lost in the urine is greater than that ingested, this leads to a negative nitrogen balance.
* Growth retardation: This can occur in cases of relapse or resistance to therapy. Causes of growth retardation are protein deficiency from the loss of protein in urine, anorexia (reduced protein intake), and steroid therapy (catabolism).
* Cushing&#x27;s syndrome

== Causes ==

Nephrotic syndrome has many causes and may either be the result of a glomerular disease that can be either limited to the kidney, called &quot;primary&quot; nephrotic syndrome (primary glomerulonephrosis), or a condition that affects the kidney and other parts of the body, called &quot;secondary&quot; nephrotic syndrome.

=== Primary glomerulonephrosis ===
Primary causes of nephrotic syndrome are usually described by their histology:
* Minimal change disease (MCD): is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. It owes its name to the fact that the nephrons appear normal when viewed with an optical microscope as the lesions are only visible using an electron microscope. Another symptom is pronounced proteinuria.
* Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS): is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults. It is characterized by the appearance of tissue scarring in the glomeruli. The term &quot;focal&quot; is used as some of the glomeruli have scars, while others appear intact; the term &quot;segmental&quot; refers to the fact that only part of the glomerulus is damaged.
* Membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN): The inflammation of the glomerular membrane causes increased leaking in the kidney. It is not clear why this condition develops in most people, although an auto-immune mechanism is suspected.
* Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis (MPGN): is the inflammation of the glomeruli along with the deposit of antibodies in their membranes, which makes filtration difficult.
* Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN): (Usually presents as a nephrotic syndrome) A person&#x27;s glomeruli are present in a &quot;crescent moon&quot; shape. It is characterized clinically by a rapid decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by at least 50% over a short period, usually from a few days to 3 months.

They are considered to be &quot;diagnoses of exclusion&quot;, i.e. they are diagnosed only after secondary causes have been excluded.

=== Secondary glomerulonephrosis ===

Secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome have the same histologic patterns as the primary causes, though they may exhibit some differences suggesting a secondary cause, such as inclusion bodies. They are usually described by the underlying cause, such as:
* Diabetic nephropathy: is a complication that occurs in some diabetics. Excess blood sugar accumulates in the kidney causing them to become inflamed and unable to carry out their normal function. This leads to the leakage of proteins into the urine.
* Systemic lupus erythematosus: this autoimmune disease can affect a number of organs, among them the kidney, due to the deposit of immunocomplexes that are typical to this disease. The disease can also cause &quot;lupus nephritis&quot;.
* Sarcoidosis: This disease does not usually affect the kidney but, on occasions, the accumulation of inflammatory granulomas (collection of immune cells) in the glomeruli can lead to nephrotic syndrome.
* Syphilis: kidney damage can occur during the secondary stage of this disease (between 2 and 8 weeks from onset).
* Hepatitis B: certain antigens present during hepatitis can accumulate in the kidneys and damage them.
* Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome: this autoimmune disease causes the deposit of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli, causing them to become inflamed, this is the same mechanism as occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus.
* HIV: the virus&#x27;s antigens provoke an obstruction in the glomerular capillary&#x27;s lumen that alters normal kidney function.
* Amyloidosis: the deposit of &quot;amyloid substances&quot; (proteins with anomalous structures) in the glomeruli modifying their shape and function.
* Multiple myeloma: kidney impairment is caused by the accumulation and precipitation of light chains, which form casts in the distal tubules, resulting in kidney obstruction. In addition, myeloma light chains are also directly toxic on proximal kidney tubules, further adding to kidney dysfunction.
* Vasculitis: inflammation of the blood vessels at a glomerular level impedes the normal blood flow and damages the kidney.
* Cancer: as happens in myeloma, the invasion of the glomeruli by cancerous cells disturbs their normal functioning.
* Genetic disorders: congenital nephrotic syndrome is a rare genetic disorder in which the protein nephrin, a component of the glomerular filtration barrier, is altered.
* Drugs ( e.g. gold salts, penicillin, captopril): gold salts can cause a more or less important loss of proteins in urine as a consequence of metal accumulation. Penicillin is nephrotoxic in people with kidney failure and captopril can aggravate proteinuria.

===Genetics===

Over 50 mutations are known to be associated with this condition.

Non-Genetic

There is no known genetic cause for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. This is thought to be caused by a hitherto unknown circulating permeability factor that travels in the circulation to the podocyte within the glomerulus of the kidney. This circulating factor damages the podocyte which changes its structure. The podocytes are now less able to restrict urinary protein loss. Despite not knowing the specific indentity of the circulating factor, scientists are learning more about it. It is thought to be either T cell or B cell derived, hence why staroid treatment can be effective for some patients. There is also evidence that the circulating factor could be signalling via the PAR-1 receptro on the podocytes.

== Pathophysiology ==
The kidney glomerulus filters the blood that arrives at the kidney. It is formed of capillaries with small pores that allow small molecules to pass through that have a molecular weight of less than 40,000 daltons, but not larger macromolecules such as proteins.

In nephrotic syndrome, the glomeruli are affected by an inflammation or a &quot;hyalinization&quot; (the formation of a homogenous crystalline material within cells) that allows proteins such as albumin, antithrombin or the immunoglobulins to pass through the cell membrane and appear in urine.

Albumin is the main protein in the blood that is able to maintain an oncotic pressure, which prevents the leakage of fluid into the extracellular medium and the subsequent formation of edemas.

As a response to hypoproteinemia the liver commences a compensatory mechanism involving the synthesis of proteins, such as alpha-2 macroglobulin and lipoproteins. An increase in the latter can cause the hyperlipidemia associated with this syndrome.

== Diagnosis ==
Along with obtaining a complete medical history, a series of biochemical tests are required in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis that verifies the presence of the illness. In addition, imaging of the kidneys (for structure and presence of two kidneys) is sometimes carried out, and/or a biopsy of the kidneys. The first test will be a urinalysis to test for high levels of proteins, as a healthy subject excretes an insignificant amount of protein in their urine. The test will involve a 24-hour bedside urinary total protein estimation. The urine sample is tested for proteinuria (&gt;3.5 g per 1.73 m2 per 24 hours). It is also examined for urinary casts, which are more a feature of active nephritis. Next a blood screen, comprehensive metabolic panel (CMP) will look for hypoalbuminemia: albumin levels of ≤2.5 g/dL (normal=3.5-5 g/dL). Then a Creatinine Clearance CCr test will evaluate kidney function particularly the glomerular filtration capacity. Creatinine formation is a result of the breakdown of muscular tissue, it is transported in the blood and eliminated in urine. Measuring the concentration of organic compounds in both liquids evaluates the capacity of the glomeruli to filter blood. Electrolytes and urea levels may also be analysed at the same time as creatinine (EUC test) in order to evaluate kidney function.
A lipid profile will also be carried out as high levels of cholesterol (hypercholesterolemia), specifically elevated LDL, usually with concomitantly elevated VLDL, is indicative of nephrotic syndrome.

A kidney biopsy may also be used as a more specific and invasive test method. A study of a sample&#x27;s anatomical pathology may then allow the identification of the type of glomerulonephritis involved. However, this procedure is usually reserved for adults as the majority of children experience minimal change disease that has a remission rate of 95% with corticosteroids. A biopsy is usually only indicated for children that are &quot;corticosteroid resistant&quot; as the majority have focal and segmental glomeruloesclerosis.

Further investigations are indicated if the cause is not clear including analysis of auto-immune markers (ANA, ASOT, C3, cryoglobulins, serum electrophoresis), or ultrasound of the whole abdomen.

===Classification===
A broad classification of nephrotic syndrome based on underlying cause:


Nephrotic syndrome is often classified histologically:


===Differential diagnosis===
Some symptoms that are present in nephrotic syndrome, such as edema and proteinuria, also appear in other illnesses. Therefore, other pathologies need to be excluded in order to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.
* Edema: in addition to nephrotic syndrome there are two other disorders that often present with edema; these are heart failure and liver failure. Congestive heart failure can cause liquid retention in tissues as a consequence of the decrease in the strength of ventricular contractions. The liquid is initially concentrated in the ankles but it subsequently becomes generalized and is called anasarca. People with congestive heart failure also experience an abnormal swelling of the heart cardiomegaly, which aids in making a correct diagnosis. Jugular venous pressure can also be elevated and it might be possible to hear heart murmurs. An echocardiogram is the preferred investigation method for these symptoms. Liver failure caused by cirrhosis, hepatitis and other conditions such as alcoholism, IV drug use or some hereditary diseases can lead to swelling in the lower extremities and the abdominal cavity. Other accompanying symptoms include jaundice, dilated veins over umbilicus (caput medusae), scratch marks (due to widespread itching, known as pruritus), enlarged spleen, spider angiomata, encephalopathy, bruising, nodular liver and anomalies in the liver function tests. Less frequently symptoms associated with the administration of certain pharmaceutical drugs have to be discounted. These drugs promote the retention of liquid in the extremities such as occurs with NSAIDs, some antihypertensive drugs, the adrenal corticosteroids and sex hormones.
Acute fluid overload can cause edema in someone with kidney failure. These people are known to have kidney failure, and have either drunk too much or missed their dialysis. In addition, when Metastatic cancer spreads to the lungs or abdomen it causes effusions and fluid accumulation due to obstruction of lymphatic vessels and veins, as well as serous exudation.
* Proteinuria: the loss of proteins from the urine is caused by many pathological agents and infection by these agents has to be ruled out before it can be certain that a person has nephrotic syndrome. Multiple myeloma can cause a proteinuria that is not accompanied by hypoalbuminemia, which is an important aid in making a differential diagnosis; other potential causes of proteinuria include asthenia, weight loss or bone pain. In diabetes mellitus there is an association between increases in glycated hemoglobin levels and the appearance of proteinuria. Other causes are amyloidosis and certain other allergic and infectious diseases.

== Treatment ==
The treatment of nephrotic syndrome can be symptomatic or can directly address the injuries caused to the kidney.

=== Symptomatic ===
The objective of this treatment is to treat the imbalances brought about by the illness: edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidaemia, hypercoagulability and infectious complications.
* Edema: a return to an unswollen state is the prime objective of this treatment of nephrotic syndrome. It is carried out through the combination of a number of recommendations:
** Rest: depending on the seriousness of the edema and taking into account the risk of thrombosis caused by prolonged bed rest.
** Medical nutrition therapy: based on a diet with the correct energy intake and balance of proteins that will be used in synthesis processes and not as a source of calories. A total of 35 kcal/kg body weight/day is normally recommended. This diet should also comply with two more requirements: the first is to not consume more than 1 g of protein/kg body weight/ day, as a greater amount could increase the degree of proteinuria and cause a negative nitrogen balance. People are usually recommended lean cuts of meat, fish, and poultry. The second guideline requires that the amount of water ingested is not greater than the level of diuresis. In order to facilitate this, the consumption of salt must also be controlled, as this contributes to water retention. It is advisable to restrict the ingestion of sodium to 1 or 2 g/day, which means that salt cannot be used in cooking and salty foods should also be avoided. Foods high in sodium include seasoning blends (garlic salt, Adobo, season salt, etc.) canned soups, canned vegetables containing salt, luncheon meats including turkey, ham, bologna, and salami, prepared foods, fast foods, soy sauce, ketchup, and salad dressings. On food labels, compare milligrams of sodium to calories per serving. Sodium should be less than or equal to calories per serving.
** Medication: The pharmacological treatment of edema is based on diuretic medications (especially loop diuretics, such as furosemide). In severe cases of edema (or in cases with physiological repercussions, such as scrotal, preputial or urethral edema) or in people with one of a number of severe infections (such as sepsis or pleural effusion), the diuretics can be administered intravenously. This occurs where the risk from plasmatic expansion is considered greater than the risk of severe hypovolemia, which can be caused by the strong diuretic action of intravenous treatment. The procedure is the following:
:# Analyse haemoglobin and haematocrit levels.
:# A solution of 25% albumin is used that is administered for only 4 hours in order to avoid pulmonary edema.
:# Haemoglobin and haematocrit levels are analysed again: if the haematocrit value is less than the initial value (a sign of correct expansion) the diuretics are administered for at least 30 minutes. If the haematocrit level is greater than the initial one this is a contraindication for the use of diuretics as they would increase said value.
:It may be necessary to give a person potassium or require a change in dietary habits if the diuretic drug causes hypokalaemia as a side effect.
* Hypoalbuminemia: is treated using the medical nutrition therapy described as a treatment for edema. It includes a moderate intake of foods rich in animal proteins.
* Hyperlipidaemia: depending on the seriousness of the condition it can be treated with medical nutrition therapy as the only treatment or combined with drug therapy. The ingestion of cholesterol should be less than 300 mg/day, which will require a switch to foods that are low in saturated fats. Avoid saturated fats such as butter, cheese, fried foods, fatty cuts of red meat, egg yolks, and poultry skin. Increase unsaturated fat intake, including olive oil, canola oil, peanut butter, avocadoes, fish and nuts. In cases of severe hyperlipidaemia that are unresponsive to nutrition therapy the use of hypolipidaemic drugs may be necessary (these include statins, fibrates and resinous sequesters of bile acids).
* Thrombophilia: low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may be appropriate for use as a prophylactic in some circumstances, such as in asymptomatic people that have no history of having thromboembolism. When the thrombophilia is such that it leads to the formation of blood clots, heparin is given for at least 5 days along with oral anticoagulants (OAC). During this time and if the prothrombin time is within its therapeutic range (between 2 and 3), it may be possible to suspend the LMWH while maintaining the OACs for at least 6 months.
* Infectious complications: an appropriate course of antibacterial drugs can be taken according to the infectious agent.

In addition to these key imbalances, vitamin D and calcium are also taken orally in case the alteration of vitamin D causes severe hypocalcaemia, this treatment has the goal of restoring physiological levels of calcium in the person.
* Achieving better blood glucose level control if the person is diabetic.
* Blood pressure control. ACE inhibitors are the drug of choice. Independent of their blood pressure-lowering effect, they have been shown to decrease protein loss.

===Kidney damage===
The treatment of kidney damage may reverse or delay the progression of the disease. Kidney damage is treated by prescribing drugs:
* Corticosteroids: the result is a decrease in proteinuria and the risk of infection as well as a resolution of the edema. Prednisone is usually prescribed at a dose of 60 mg/m2 of body surface area/day in a first treatment for 4–8 weeks. After this period the dose is reduced to 40 mg/m2 for a further 4 weeks. People experiencing a relapse or children are treated with prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day until urine becomes negative for protein. Then, 1.5 mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Frequent relapses treated by: cyclophosphamide or nitrogen mustard or cyclosporin or levamisole. People can respond to prednisone in a number of different ways:
** People with Corticosteroid sensitive or early steroid-responder: the subject responds to the corticosteroids in the first 8 weeks of treatment. This is demonstrated by a strong diuresis and the disappearance of edemas, and also by a negative test for proteinuria in three urine samples taken during the night.
** People with Corticosteroid resistance or late steroid-responder: the proteinuria persists after the 8-week treatment. The lack of response is indicative of the seriousness of the glomerular damage, which could develop into chronic kidney failure.
** People with Corticosteroid intolerant: complications such as hypertension appear, and they gain a lot of weight and can develop aseptic or avascular necrosis of the hip or knee, cataracts and thrombotic phenomena and/or embolisms.
** People with Corticosteroid dependent: proteinuria appears when the dose of corticosteroid is decreased or there is a relapse in the first two weeks after treatment is completed.

The susceptibility testing in vitro to glucocorticoids on the person&#x27;s peripheral blood mononuclear cells is associated with the number of new cases of not optimal clinical responses: the most sensitive people in vitro have shown a higher number of cases of corticodependence, while the most resistant people in vitro showed a higher number of cases of ineffective therapy.
* Immunosupressors (cyclophosphamide): only indicated in recurring nephrotic syndrome in corticosteroid dependent or intolerant people. In the first two cases, the proteinuria has to be negated before treatment with the immunosuppressor can begin, which involves a prolonged treatment with prednisone. The negation of the proteinuria indicates the exact moment when treatment with cyclophosphamide can begin. The treatment is continued for 8 weeks at a dose of 3 mg/kg/day, the immunosuppression is halted after this period. In order to be able to start this treatment the person should not have neutropenia nor anaemia, which would cause further complications. A possible side effect of the cyclophosphamide is alopecia. Complete blood count tests are carried out during the treatment in order to give advance warning of a possible infection.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for nephrotic syndrome under treatment is generally good although this depends on the underlying cause, the age of the person and their response to treatment. It is usually good in children, because minimal change disease responds very well to steroids and does not cause chronic kidney failure. Any relapses that occur become less frequent over time; the opposite occurs with mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis, in which the kidney fails within three years of the disease developing, making dialysis necessary and subsequent kidney transplant. In addition children under the age of 5 generally have a poorer prognosis than prepubescents, as do adults older than 30 years of age as they have a greater risk of kidney failure.

Other causes such as focal segmental glomerulosclerosis frequently lead to end stage kidney disease. Factors associated with a poorer prognosis in these cases include level of proteinuria, blood pressure control and kidney function (GFR).

Without treatment nephrotic syndrome has a very bad prognosis especially &quot;rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis&quot;, which leads to acute kidney failure after a few months.

== Epidemiology ==
Nephrotic syndrome can affect any age, although it is mainly found in adults with a ratio of adults to children of 26 to 1.

The syndrome presents in different ways in the two groups: the most frequent glomerulopathy in children is minimal change disease (66% of cases), followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (8%) and mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (6%). In adults the most common disease is mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (30-40%), followed by focal and segmental glomeruloesclerosis (15-25%) and minimal change disease (20%). The latter usually presents as secondary and not primary as occurs in children. Its main cause is diabetic nephropathy. It usually presents in a person from their 40s or 50s.
Of the glomerulonephritis cases, approximately 60% to 80% are primary, while the remainder are secondary.

There are also differences in epidemiology between the sexes, the disease is more common in men than in women by a ratio of 2 to 1.

The epidemiological data also reveals information regarding the most common way that symptoms develop in people with nephrotic syndrome: spontaneous remission occurs in up to 20% or 30% of cases during the first year of the illness. However, this improvement is not definitive as some 50% to 60% of people with Nephrotic syndrome die and/or develop chronic kidney failure 6 to 14 years after this remission. On the other hand, between 10% and 20% of people have continuous episodes of remissions and relapses without dying or jeopardizing their kidney. The main causes of death are cardiovascular, as a result of the chronicity of the syndrome, and thromboembolic accidents.

<text>Mēḷakartā is a collection of fundamental musical scales (ragas) in Carnatic music (South Indian classical music). &quot;Mēḷakartā&quot; ragas are parent ragas (hence known as &quot;janaka&quot; ragas) from which other ragas may be derived. A &quot;melakarta&quot; raga is sometimes referred as &quot;mela&quot;, &quot;karta&quot; or &quot;sampurna&quot; as well, though the latter usage is inaccurate, as a &quot;sampurna&quot; raga need not be a &quot;melakarta&quot; (take the raga &quot;Bhairavi,&quot; for example).

In Hindustani music the &quot;thaat&quot; is the rough equivalent of &quot;Melakartā&quot;. There are 10 &quot;thaats&quot; in Hindustani music, though the commonly accepted &quot;melakarta&quot; scheme has 72 ragas.

==Rules for &quot;Mēḷakarta&quot; ragas==
Ragas must contain the following characteristics to be considered &quot;Melakarta&quot;:
*They are &quot;sampurna ragas&quot; – they contain all seven &quot;swaras&quot; (notes) of the octave in both ascending and descending scale.
*The upper shadjam is included in the raga scale. (ragas like &quot;Punnagavarali&quot; and &quot;Chenchurutti&quot; are not &quot;mēḷakarta&quot; as they end with &quot;nishadam&quot;)
*The ascending and descending scales must have the same notes.

==History==
The &quot;mēḷa&quot; system of ragas was first propounded by Raamamaatya in his work Svaramelakalanidhi c. 1550. He is considered the father of &quot;mela&quot; system of ragas. Later, Venkatamakhin, a gifted musicologist in the 17th century, expounded a new &quot;mela&quot; system known today as &quot;mēḷakarta&quot; in his work &quot;Chaturdandi Prakaasikaa&quot;. He made some bold and controversial claims and defined somewhat arbitrarily 6 &quot;svaras&quot; from the known 12 semitones, at that time, to arrive at 72 &quot;mēḷakarta&quot; ragas. The controversial parts relate to double counting of R2 (and similar &quot;svaras&quot;) and his exclusive selection of &quot;madhyamas&quot; for which there is no specific reasoning (also known as &quot;asampurna melas&quot; as opposed to &quot;sampurna ragas&quot;). However, today the 72 &quot;mēḷakarta&quot; ragas use a standardized pattern, unlike Venkatamakhi&#x27;s pattern, and have gained a significant following. Govindhacharya is credited with the standardization of rules and known for giving different names for standard ragas that have a different structure but the same swaras as those proposed by Venkatamakhi. The scales in this page are those proposed by Govindaacharya.

==Determining the &quot;Mēḷakarta&quot;==

A hundred years after Venkatamakhin&#x27;s time the &quot;Katapayadi sankhya&quot; rule came to be applied to the nomenclature of the &quot;mēḷakarta&quot; ragas. The &quot;sankhya&quot; associates Sanskrit consonants with digits. The digits corresponding to the first two syllables of the name of a raga, when reversed, give the index of the raga. Thus the scale of a &quot;mēḷakarta&quot; raga can be easily derived from its name. The Sanskrit rule of “Sankhyānam vāmatò gatihi” means for arriving to digits, you read from right to left.

For example, &quot;Harikambhoji&quot; raga starts with syllables &quot;Ha&quot; and &quot;ri&quot;, which have numbers 8 and 2 associated with them. Reversing them we get 28. Hence Harikambhoji is the 28th Mēḷakarta rāga. See Katapayadi sankhya for more details and examples.

==&quot;Mēḷakarta&quot; scale==
Each &quot;mēḷakarta&quot; raga has a different scale. This scheme envisages the lower Sa (&quot;Keezh Shadja&quot;), upper Sa (&quot;Mael Shadja&quot;) and Pa (&quot;Panchama&quot;) as fixed &quot;swaras&quot;, with the Ma (&quot;Madhyama&quot;) having two variants and the remaining swaras Ri (&quot;Rishabha&quot;), Ga (&quot;Gandhaara&quot;), Dha (&quot;Dhaivata&quot;) and Ni (&quot;Nishaada&quot;) as having three variants each. This leads to 72 seven-note combinations (scales) referred to as the &quot;Mēḷakarta&quot; ragas as follows.

There are twelve semitones of the octave S, R1, R2=G1, R3=G2, G3, M1, M2, P, D1, D2=N1, D3=N2, N3 (see &quot;swaras&quot; in Carnatic music for explanation of these notations). A melakarta raga must necessarily have S and P, one of the M&#x27;s, one each of the R&#x27;s and G&#x27;s, and one each of the D&#x27;s and N&#x27;s. Also, R must necessarily precede G and D must precede N (&quot;krama sampūrṇa&quot; rāga). This gives 2 × 6 × 6 = 72 ragas. Finding &quot;mēḷakarta ragas&quot; is a mathematical process. By following a simple set of rules we can find the corresponding raga and the scale associated with it.

A raga which has a subset of &quot;svarās&quot; from a &quot;Mēḷakarta&quot; raga is said to be a &quot;janya&quot; (means born or derived from) of that &quot;Mēḷakarta&quot; raga. Every raga is the &quot;janya&quot; of a &quot;mēḷakarta&quot; raga. &quot;Janya&quot; ragas whose notes are found in more than one &quot;mēḷakarta&quot; raga are assigned (or associated) parent &quot;Melakarta&quot; based on subjective notions of similarity. This is obvious for ragas that have less than seven notes. For such ragas it can be associated with a &quot;Mēḷakarta&quot; which has any of the different swaras in that position. For example, Hindolam has Rishabha and Panchama missing. Hence, it could be considered a janya of &quot;Todi&quot; (also known as &quot;Hanumatodi&quot;) which has &quot;shuddha rishabha&quot; or with &quot;Natabhairavi&quot; which has a &quot;chathushruti rishabha&quot;. It is popularly associated with &quot;Natabhairavi&quot;.

==&quot;Chakras&quot;==

The 72 &quot;Mēḷakarta&quot; ragas are split into 12 groups called &quot;chakrās&quot;, each containing 6 ragas. The ragas within the chakra differ only in the &quot;dhaivatam&quot; and &quot;nishadam&quot; notes (D and N), as illustrated below. The name of each of the 12 &quot;chakras&quot; suggest their ordinal number as well.

* &quot;Indu&quot; stands for the moon, of which we have only one – hence it is the first &quot;chakra&quot;.
* &quot;Nētra&quot; means eyes, of which we have two – hence it is the second.
* &quot;Agni&quot; is the third &quot;chakra&quot; it indicates three kinds of Agni (Dakshina, Ahavaniyam and gArhapatyam). So agni indicates 3rd &quot;Chakra&quot;.
* &quot;Vēda&quot; denoting four &quot;Vedas&quot; is the name of the fourth &quot;chakra&quot;.
* &quot;Bāṇa&quot; comes fifth as it stands for the five Arrows of &quot;Manmatha&quot;.These arrows of Manmatha are mango, lotus, blue lily, jasmine and asoka. These arrows were to give the person hit by it have intense issues
* &quot;Rutu&quot; is the sixth &quot;chakra&quot; standing for the 6 seasons of Hindu calendar, which are Vasanta, Greeshma, Varsha, Sharat, Hemanta and Shishira.
* &quot;Rishi&quot;, meaning sage, is the seventh &quot;chakra&quot; representing the seven sages.
* &quot;Vasu&quot; stands for the eight &quot;vasus&quot; of Hinduism.
* &quot;Brahma&quot; comes next of which there are 9.
* Disi &quot;Chakra&quot; indicates Ten directions(East, West, North, South, North East, North West, South East, South West, Above and Below). Hence it is 10th &quot;Chakra&quot;.
* Eleventh &quot;chakra&quot; is &quot;Rudra&quot; of which there are eleven.
* Twelfth comes &quot;Ādityas&quot; of which there are twelve.

These 12 &quot;chakras&quot; were also established by Venkatamakhi.

==Table of &quot;Mēḷakartā&quot; ragas==
The 72 &quot;Mēḷakartā&quot; ragas can be divided into two parts, &quot;shuddha madhyama&quot; and &quot;prati madhyama&quot; ragas. When a given &quot;shuddha madhyama&quot; raga&#x27;s M1 is replaced by M2, we get the corresponding &quot;prati madhyama&quot; raga. See Katapayadi sankhya for more information on how to derive the various &quot;swaras&quot; of a raga from its &quot;mēḷakartā&quot; number.

See swaras in Carnatic music for explanation of the notations like R1, G2, N2, and so forth.
==Alternate &quot;Mēḷakarta&quot; scheme==

Muthuswami Dikshitar school followed a different set of scales as the 72 &quot;Mēḷakarta&quot; ragas. These were taught by Venkatamakhin. Many of the scales were &quot;asampurna&quot; (not sampurna ragas) because Dikshitar chose to follow the earlier established structure to mitigate ill-effects of usage of direct &quot;vivadi swaras&quot; in the scales.

<text>Vertebrate paleontology is the subfield of paleontology that seeks to discover, through the study of fossilized remains, the behavior, reproduction and appearance of extinct vertebrates (animals with vertebrae and their descendants). It also tries to connect, by using the evolutionary timeline, the animals of the past and their modern-day relatives.

The fossil record shows aspects of the meandering evolutionary path from early aquatic vertebrates to modern fish as well as mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, with a host of transitional fossils, though there are still large blank areas. The earliest known fossil vertebrates were heavily armored fish discovered in rocks from the Ordovician period about 485 to 444 Ma (megaannum, million years ago), with jawed vertebrates emerging in the following Silurian period (444 to 419 Ma) with the placoderms and acanthodians. The Devonian period (419 to 359 Ma) saw primitive air-breathing fish to develop limbs allowing them to walk on land, thus becoming the first terrestrial vertebrates, the stegocephalians.

Romer&#x27;s gap in the early Carboniferous period (359 to 299 Ma) left little of the early stegocephalians, but allowed vertebrates more adapted to life on land to flourish in their wake. Crown-group tetrapods appeared in the early Carboniferous, with temnospondyls dominating the ecosystem and becoming the first land vertebrate megafauna. A lineage of reptiliomorphs developed a metabolism better suited for life exclusively on land, as well as a novel form of reproduction freeing them from the water: the amniotic egg, with full-fledged amniotes appearing in the mid-Carboniferous. Sharks and their holocephalian relatives flourished in the seas, while rivers were dominated by lobe-finned fish like rhizodonts.

During the Permian period (299 to 252 Ma), one of the two major branches of amniotes, the synapsids, flourished, with derived therapsids taking over in the middle of the period. The Great Dying wiped out most of the synapsid diversity, with archosaurs, emerging from the other sauropsid branch, replacing many of them in the Triassic period (252 to 201 Ma). Lissamphibians, modern amphibians, likely arose around that time from temnospondyls. True mammals, derived from cynodont therapsids, showed up in the Middle Triassic around the same time as the dinosaurs, who emerged from a clade of archosaurs. At the same time, ray-finned fish diversified, leading to teleost fish dominating the seas.

Ancestral birds (Avialae) like &quot;Archaeopteryx&quot; first evolved from dinosaurs during the Jurassic, with crown-group birds (Neornithes) emerging in the Cretaceous between 100 Ma and 60 Ma.

The K-Pg mass extinction wiped out many vertebrate clades, including the pterosaurs, plesiosaurs, mosasaurs and nearly all dinosaurs, leaving many ecological niches open. While therian mammals had already evolved in the Late Jurassic, they would rise to prominence in the Paleogene following the mass extinction and remain to this day, although squamates and birds still lead in diversity.
==History==
One of the people who helped figure out the vertebrate progression was French zoologist Georges Cuvier (1769–1832), who realized that fossils found in older rock strata differed greatly from more recent fossils or modern animals. He published his findings in 1812 and, although he steadfastly refuted evolution, his work proved the (at the time) contested theory of extinction of species.

Thomas Jefferson is credited with initiating the science of vertebrate paleontology in the United States with the reading of a paper to the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia in 1797. Jefferson presented fossil bones of a ground sloth found in a cave in western Virginia and named the genus (&quot;Megalonyx&quot;). The species was ultimately named &quot;Megalonyx jeffersonii&quot; in his honor. Jefferson corresponded with Cuvier, including sending him a shipment of highly desirable bones of the American mastodon and the woolly mammoth.

Paleontology really got started though, with the publication of &quot;Recherches sur les poissons fossiles&quot; (1833–1843) by Swiss naturalist Louis Agassiz (1807–1873). He studied, described and listed hundreds of species of fossil fish, beginning the serious study into the lives of extinct animals. With the publication of the Origin of Species by Charles Darwin in 1859, the field got a theoretical framework. Much of the subsequent work has been to map the relationship between fossil and extant organisms, as well as their history through time.

In modern times, Alfred Romer (1894–1973) wrote what has been termed the definitive textbook on the subject, called &quot;Vertebrate Paleontology&quot;. It shows the progression of evolution in fossil fish, and amphibians and reptiles through comparative anatomy, including a list of all the (then) known fossil vertebrate genera. Romer became the first president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in 1940, alongside co-founder Howard Chiu. An updated work that largely carried on the tradition from Romer, and by many considered definitive book on the subject was written by Robert L. Carroll of McGill University, the 1988 text &quot;Vertebrate Paleontology and Evolution&quot;. Carroll was president of the Society of Vertebrate Paleontology in 1983. The Society keeps its members informed on the latest discoveries through newsletters and the &quot;Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology&quot;.

==Classification==

The &quot;traditional&quot; vertebrate classification scheme employ evolutionary taxonomy where several of the taxa listed are paraphyletic, i.e. have given rise to another taxa that have been given the same rank. For instance, birds are generally considered to be the descendants of reptiles (Saurischian dinosaurs to be precise), but in this system both are listed as separate classes. Under phylogenetic nomenclature, such an arrangement is unacceptable, though it offers excellent overview.

This classical scheme is still used in works where systematic overview is essential, e.g. Benton (1998), Hildebrand and Goslow (2001) and Knobill and Neill (2006). While mostly seen in general works, it is also still used in some specialist works like Fortuny &amp; al. (2011).

== The oVert Thematic Collections Network ==
The oVert (openVertebrate) Thematic Collection Network (TCN) is a project that aims to generate and distribute high-resolution digital three-dimensional data for internal anatomy across vertebrate diversity. The project will CT-scan over 20,000 fluid-preserved specimens, representing more than 80% of the living genera of vertebrates, at a network of digitization centers across the US. This collection of digital imagery and three-dimensional volumes will be open for exploration, download, and use to address questions related to the discovery of new species, documenting patterns of anatomical diversity and growth, and testing hypotheses of function and evolution.

<text>Jovinus was a Gallo-Roman senator and claimed to be Roman Emperor (411–413 AD).

Following the defeat of the usurper known as Constantine III, Jovinus was proclaimed emperor at Mainz in 411, a puppet supported by Gundahar, king of the Burgundians, and Goar, king of the Alans. Jovinus kept his position in Gaul for two years, long enough to issue coinage that showed him wearing the imperial diadem. He was supported by a number of local Gallo-Roman nobles who had survived Constantine&#x27;s defeat.

Under the pretext of Jovinus&#x27; imperial authority, Gundahar and his Burgundians established themselves on the left bank of the Rhine (the Roman side) between the river Lauter and the Nahe. Here they founded a kingdom with the old Romanized Gaulish settlement of Borbetomagus (Worms) as its capital.

Jovinus&#x27; end came after the Visigoths under Ataulf left Italy (at Priscus Attalus&#x27; advice), ostensibly to join him, carrying with them as hostages the ex-emperor Attalus and Galla Placidia, Honorius&#x27; half-sister. Then Ataulf attacked and killed Sarus, who had also come to support Jovinus. Jovinus, offended at this act, then failed to consult Ataulf when he elevated his brother Sebastianus as co-emperor. Insulted, Ataulf allied his Visigoths with Honorius, and they defeated Jovinus&#x27; troops. Sebastianus was executed. Jovinus fled for his life, but was besieged and captured in Valentia (Valence, Drôme) and taken to Narbo (Narbonne), where Caius Posthumus Dardanus, the praetorian prefect (governor) in Gaul, who had remained loyal to Honorius, had him executed. Jovinus&#x27; and Sebastianus&#x27; heads were afterwards sent to Honorius and mounted on the walls of Ravenna (before being passed on to Carthage, where they were put on permanent display with the heads of Maximus of Hispania and three other usurpers).

<text>The White House Rose Garden is a garden bordering the Oval Office and the West Wing of the White House in Washington, D.C., United States. The garden is approximately 125 feet long and 60 feet wide ( by , or about 684m2). It balances the Jacqueline Kennedy Garden on the east side of the White House Complex. It is commonly used as a stage for receptions and media events due to its proximity to the White House.

==Design and horticulture==


===History===
Prior to 1902, the area of the present-day Oval Office, Cabinet Room, and Rose Garden contained extensive stables housing horses and coaches. There was also a conservatory rose house in the area. During the 1902 Roosevelt renovation of the White House, First Lady Edith Roosevelt established a &quot;proper colonial garden&quot; in place of the conservatory.

The White House Rose Garden was established in 1913 by Ellen Louise Axson Wilson, wife of Woodrow Wilson, and designed by landscape architect George Burnap. In 1935, President Franklin D. Roosevelt commissioned Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. to redesign the garden, and he installed cast iron furniture pieces.

===Renovations performed in 1961===
In 1961, during the John F. Kennedy administration, the garden was largely redesigned by Rachel Lambert Mellon concurrently with extensive repair work to the East Garden. Mellon created a space with a more defined central lawn, bordered by flower beds that were planted in a French formal garden style while largely using American botanical specimens. Although individual plantings are changed frequently according to the wishes of the incumbent administration, until 2020 the garden followed the same layout first established by Mellon, where each flower bed was planted with a series of pale pink &#x27;Katherine&#x27; crabapples and Littleleaf lindens bordered by low diamond-shaped hedges of thyme. (The &#x27;Katherine&#x27; crabapples were replaced in 2019 with a white-flowering variety called Spring Snow, which did not do well.) Additionally, the outer edges to the flower bed which faced the central lawn were edged with boxwood, and each of the four corners to the garden were punctuated by &quot;Magnolia&quot; × &quot;soulangeana&quot;; specifically, obtaining specimens that were found growing along the banks of the Tidal Basin by Mellon. Mellon tasked White House Head Gardener Irvin Williams with planting the trees. Initially blocked from doing so by the National Park Service, Williams secretly removed and transported the trees from the Basin to the White House under cover of night.

Ever since then, roses have served as the primary flowering plants in the garden, including large numbers of &#x27;Queen Elizabeth&#x27; grandiflora roses, along with the tea roses &#x27;Pascali&#x27;, &#x27;Pat Nixon&#x27;, and &#x27;King&#x27;s Ransom&#x27;. A shrub rose, &#x27;Nevada&#x27;, also served to add a cool note of white coloration to the landscaping. Seasonal flowers are further interspersed to add nearly year-round color and variety to the garden. Some of the Spring blooming bulbs planted in the Rose Garden include jonquil, daffodil, fritillaria, grape hyacinth, tulips, chionodoxa and squill. Summer blooming annuals are changed on a near yearly basis. In the fall, chrysanthemum and flowering kale bring color leading all the way up until the early winter days. In a tradition, every summer sees garden gnomes placed throughout the Rose Garden on July 1 - the number representing the number of living presidents at that time.

=== Renovations performed in 2020 ===
First Lady Melania Trump commissioned an August 2020 renovation of the garden by Oehme, van Sweden and Perry Guillot. In the flower beds, white and pale pink rose bushes are intermixed with seasonal bulbs and annuals, including the Pope John Paul II Rose in honor of the first time a pope visited the White House in 1979. A new limestone walk, wide to comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act, was laid around the borders of the garden. The crabapple trees, added during the Kennedy redesign, were relocated elsewhere on the White House grounds as the newer trees were failing to thrive.

The renovation was controversial, with many observers describing it as &quot;sterile, bland, and devoid of any joy&quot;. Presidential historian Michael Beschloss opined that the renovation was an &quot;evisceration&quot; of the Rose Garden, and that &quot;decades of American history [was] made to disappear.&quot; &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, however, stated that the renovation was &quot;long overdue&quot; and noted several problems with the Rose Garden&#x27;s pre-renovation landscaping, including a poorly-drained lawn which required annual replacement, the die-off of multiple rose bushes &quot;to the point where only a dozen or so remained&quot;, and the parterres&#x27; susceptibility to boxwood blight.

White House interior designer and Grounds Committee member Thammanoune Kannalikham described the decision as a &quot;collective&quot; one, made “by the entire team to respond to the changed environment of the garden ... It allows the roses to thrive (having increased in quantity from 19 to over 200), while bringing in the greater narrative of the colonnade into the design of the garden.&quot;

===&quot;Floor Frame&quot;===
The abstract sculpture &quot;Floor Frame&quot; by Isamu Noguchi is displayed under a magnolia tree in the Rose Garden. It was unveiled by Melania Trump and Stewart McLaurin, the director of the White House Historical Association in November 2020. It was the first art work by an Asian American artist to enter the official collection of the White House.

==Official and informal use==
Beginning with the establishment of the garden in the early twentieth century, the Rose Garden has been used for events. President Wilson met there with the press for informal questions. President Herbert Hoover began a tradition of welcoming and being photographed with prominent citizens there. Calvin Coolidge used the garden for making public announcements about policy and staffing decisions. President John F. Kennedy welcomed Project Mercury astronauts in the garden. Many presidential news conferences take place in the garden, as well as occasional White House dinners and ceremonies. The wedding of President Richard Nixon&#x27;s daughter Tricia to Edward F. Cox took place in the Rose Garden in 1971. In recent years, joint news conferences with the president and a visiting head of state have been held in the Rose Garden. On July 25, 1994, a declaration of peace between Israel and Jordan was signed in the Rose Garden. Presidents frequently host American Olympic and major league athletes in the Rose Garden after winning in their respective sport. George W. Bush welcomed the Stanley Cup champion Carolina Hurricanes to the Rose Garden after their victory in 2006. In August 2020, First Lady Melania Trump gave a speech for the second night of the 2020 Republican National Convention in the Rose Garden before an audience of 70 people. Although the Rose Garden is used frequently to greet distinguished visitors and for special ceremonies and public statements, the contemplative setting is often a very personal and private place for the president.

On September 26, 2020, President Donald Trump announced his Supreme Court nomination of Amy Coney Barrett in a ceremony in the Rose Garden before an audience of top Washington officials, other dignitaries, and family members. Following the event, several attendees tested positive for COVID-19, including Trump himself.

===Rose Garden strategy===

The phrase &quot;Rose Garden strategy&quot; (such as a re-election strategy) refers to staying inside or on the grounds of the White House, as opposed to traveling throughout the country. For example, Jimmy Carter&#x27;s initial efforts to end the Iran hostage crisis (1979–1981) were a Rose Garden strategy because he mostly held discussions with his close advisers in the White House rather than traveling to elicit public support. Four years earlier, Carter had accused Gerald Ford of the same thing and said that President Ford was using White House actions to garner free publicity while as challenger, Carter had to struggle for press coverage.

<text>Priscus Attalus (Greek: Πρίσκος Άτταλος, died after 416) was twice Roman usurper (in 409–10 and in 414–15), against Emperor Honorius, with Visigothic support. Originally a pagan, he was eventually baptized as an Arian Christian, thus becoming the last pretender to the Roman imperial office who did not profess Nicene Christianity.

==Biography==
Priscus Attalus was a Greek from the Roman province of Asia, whose father had moved to Italy under Valentinian I. Attalus was an important senator in Rome, who served as &quot;praefectus urbi&quot; in 409. He was twice proclaimed emperor by the Visigoths in an effort to impose their terms on the ineffectual Emperor Honorius, who was based in Ravenna.

Attalus held the title of Emperor in Rome for a few months 409–410, and later in Burdigala again for a few months in 414–415. The first reign ended when Alaric believed it was hampering his negotiations with Honorius, and the second ended after he was abandoned by the Visigoths and eventually captured by Honorius&#x27;s men. Attalus was obliged to participate in the triumph Honorius celebrated in the streets of Rome in 416, before finishing his days exiled in the Aeolian Islands.

<doc id="264268" wikidata="Q163446" url="?curid=264268" title="Carpet">
<text>A carpet is a textile floor covering typically consisting of an upper layer of pile attached to a backing. The pile was traditionally made from wool, but since the 20th century synthetic fibers such as polypropylene, nylon, or polyester have often been used, as these fibers are less expensive than wool. The pile usually consists of twisted tufts that are typically heat-treated to maintain their structure. The term &quot;carpet&quot; is often used in a similar context to the term rug, but rugs are typically considered to be smaller than a room and not attached to the floor.
Carpets are used for a variety of purposes. These include insulating a person&#x27;s feet from a cold tile or concrete floor, making a room more comfortable as a place to sit on the floor (e.g., when playing with children or as a prayer rug), reducing sound from walking (particularly in apartment buildings), and adding decoration or color to a room. Carpets can be made in any color by using differently dyed fibers. Carpets can have many different types of patterns and motifs used to decorate the surface. Carpets are used in industrial and commercial establishments such as retail stores and hotels and in private homes. Today, a huge range of carpets and rugs are available at many price and quality levels, ranging from inexpensive, synthetic carpets that are mass-produced in factories and used in commercial buildings to costly hand-knotted wool rugs that are used in private residences.

Carpets can be produced on a loom quite similarly to woven fabric, made using needle felts, knotted by hand (in oriental rugs), made with their pile injected into a backing material (called tufting), flatwoven, made by hooking wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric, or embroidered. Carpet is commonly made in widths of in the US and in Europe. Since the 19th and 20th century, where necessary for wall-to-wall carpet, different widths of carpet can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was sewn together) and fixed to a floor over a cushioned underlay (pad) using nails, tack strips (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal stair rods. Wall-to-wall carpet is distinguished from rugs or mats, which are loose-laid floor coverings, as wall-to-wall carpet is fixed to the floor and covers a much larger area.

==Etymology and usage==

The term &quot;&quot; comes from Latin &quot;carpita&quot;, Old French &quot;carpite&quot;. One derivation of the term states that the French term came from the Old Italian &quot;carpita&quot;, from the verb &quot;carpire&quot; meaning &#x27;to pluck&#x27;. The &quot;Online Etymology Dictionary&quot; states that the term &quot;carpet&quot; was first used in English in the late 13th century, with the meaning &#x27;coarse cloth&#x27;, and by the mid-14th century, &quot;tablecloth, [or] bedspread&quot;. The word comes from Old French &quot;carpite&quot; &#x27;heavy decorated cloth, carpet&#x27;, from Medieval Latin or Old Italian &quot;carpita&quot; &#x27;thick woolen cloth&#x27;, which may derive from Latin &quot;carpere&quot; &#x27;to card, pluck&#x27;. The Latin word &quot;carpet&quot; was introduced in the 13th century by the Florentines from the Middle Armenian word կարպետ (carpet). The meaning of the term &quot;carpet&quot; shifted in the 15th century to refer to floor coverings.

The terms &quot;carpet&quot; and &quot;rug&quot; are often used interchangeably. A carpet is sometimes defined as stretching from wall to wall. Another definition treats rugs as of lower quality or of smaller size, with carpets quite often having finished ends. A third common definition is that a carpet is permanently fixed in place while a rug is simply laid out on the floor. Historically, the term &quot;carpet&quot; was also applied to table and wall coverings, as carpets were not commonly used on the floor in European interiors until the 15th century.

The term &quot;rug&quot; was first used in English in the 1550s, with the meaning &#x27;coarse fabric&#x27;. The term is of Scandinavian origin, comparable to Norwegian &quot;rugga&quot; &#x27;coarse coverlet&#x27;, from Old Norse &quot;rogg&quot; &#x27;shaggy tuft&#x27;, from Proto-Germanic &quot;*rawwa-&quot;. The meaning of &quot;rug&quot; &quot;evolved to &#x27;coverlet, wrap&#x27; (1590s), then &#x27;mat for the floor&#x27; (1808)&quot;.

==Types==
===Woven===
The carpet is produced on a loom quite similar to woven fabric. The pile can be plush or Berber. Plush carpet is a cut pile and Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Turkey, Iran, India, Pakistan, and Arabia.

===Needle felt===

Needle felt carpets are more technologically advanced. These carpets are produced by intermingling and felting individual synthetic fibers using barbed and forked needles forming an extremely durable carpet. These carpets are normally found in commercial settings where there is frequent traffic, such as hotels and restaurants.

===Knotted===
On a knotted pile carpet (formally, a &quot;supplementary weft cut-loop pile&quot; carpet), the structural weft threads alternate with a supplementary weft that rises at right angles to the surface of the weave. This supplementary weft is attached to the warp by one of three knot types (see below), such as shag carpet which was popular in the 1970s, to form the pile or nap of the carpet. Knotting by hand is most prevalent in oriental rugs and carpets. Kashmir carpets are also hand-knotted. Pile carpets, like flat carpets, can be woven on a loom. Both vertical and horizontal looms have been used in the production of European and oriental carpets. The warp threads are set up on the frame of the loom before weaving begins. A number of weavers may work together on the same carpet. A row of knots is completed and cut. The knots are secured with (usually one to four) rows of weft. The warp in woven carpet is usually cotton and the weft is jute.

There are several styles of knotting, but the two main types of knot are the symmetrical (also called Turkish or Ghiordes) and asymmetrical (also called Persian or Senna). Contemporary centres of knotted carpet production are: Lahore and Peshawar (Pakistan), Kashmir (India), Mirzapur and Bhadohi (India),Tabriz (Iran), Afghanistan, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Turkey, Northern Africa, Nepal, Spain, Turkmenistan, and Tibet. The importance of carpets in the culture of Turkmenistan is such that the national flag features a vertical red stripe near the hoist side, containing five carpet guls (designs used in producing rugs). Kashmir and bhadohi is known for handknotted carpets of silk or wool.

===Tufted===
These are carpets that have their pile injected with the help of tufting gun into a backing material, which is itself then bonded to a secondary backing made of a woven hessian weave or a man made alternative to provide stability. The pile is often sheared in order to achieve different textures. This is the most common method of manufacturing of domestic carpets for floor covering purposes in the world.

===Others===
A flatweave carpet is created by interlocking warp (vertical) and weft (horizontal) threads. Types of oriental flatwoven carpet include kilim, soumak, plain weave, and tapestry weave. Types of European flatwoven carpets include Venetian, Dutch, damask, list, haircloth, and ingrain (aka double cloth, two-ply, triple cloth, or three-ply).

A hooked rug is a simple type of rug handmade by pulling strips of cloth such as wool or cotton through the meshes of a sturdy fabric such as burlap. This type of rug is now generally made as a handicraft. The process of creating a hooked rug is called rug hooking.

Unlike woven carpets, embroidery carpets are not formed on a loom. Their pattern is established by the application of stitches to a cloth (often linen) base. The tent stitch and the cross stitch are two of the most common. Embroidered carpets were traditionally made by royal and aristocratic women in the home, but there has been some commercial manufacture since steel needles were introduced (earlier needles were made of bone) and linen weaving improved in the 16th century. Mary, Queen of Scots, is known to have been an avid embroiderer. 16th century designs usually involve scrolling vines and regional flowers (for example, the Bradford carpet). They often incorporate animal heraldry and the coat of arms of the maker. Production continued through the 19th century. Victorian embroidered carpet compositions include highly illusionistic, 3-dimensional flowers. Patterns for tiled carpets made of a number of squares, called Berlin wool work, were introduced in Germany in 1804, and became extremely popular in England in the 1830s. Embroidered carpets can also include other features such as a pattern of shapes, or they can even tell a story.

==Fibres and yarns==

Carpet can be formulated from many single or blended natural and synthetic fibres. Fibres are chosen for durability, appearance, ease of manufacture, and cost. In terms of scale of production, the dominant yarn constructions are polyamides (nylons) and polypropylene with an estimated 90% of the commercial market.

===Nylon===
Since the 20th century, nylon is one of the most common materials for the construction of carpets. Both nylon 6 and nylon 6-6 are used. Nylon can be dyed topically or dyed in a molten state (solution dying). Nylon can be printed easily and has excellent wear characteristics. Due to nylon&#x27;s excellent wear-resistance, it is widely used in industrial and commercial carpeting. In carpets, nylon tends to stain easily due to the presence of dye sites. These dye sites need to be filled in order to give nylon carpet any type of stain resistance. As nylon is petroleum-based it varies in price with the price of oil.

===Polypropylene===
Polypropylene, a polyolefin stiffer than the cheaper polyethylene, is used to produce carpet yarns because it is still less expensive than the other materials used for carpets. It is difficult to dye and does not wear as well as wool or nylon. Polypropylene, sometimes referred to simply as &quot;olefin&quot;, is commonly used to construct berber carpets. Large looped olefin berber carpets are usually only suited for light domestic use and tend to mat down quickly. Berber carpets with smaller loops tend to be more resilient and retain their new appearance longer than large looped berber styles. Commercial grade level-loop carpets have very small loops, and commercial grade cut-pile styles can be well constructed. When made with polypropylene, commercial grade styles wear very well, making them very suitable for areas with heavy foot traffic such as offices. Polypropylene carpets are known to have good stain resistance, but not against oil-based agents. If a stain does set, it can be difficult to clean. Commercial grade carpets can be glued directly to the floor or installed over a 1/4&quot; thick, 8-pound density padding. Outdoor grass carpets are usually made from polypropylene.

===Wool and wool-blends===

Wool has excellent durability, can be dyed easily and is fairly abundant. When blended with synthetic fibres such as nylon the durability of wool is increased. Blended wool yarns are extensively used in production of modern carpet, with the most common blend being 80% wool to 20% synthetic fibre, giving rise to the term &quot;80/20&quot;. Wool is relatively expensive and consequently, it only comprises a small portion of the market.

===Polyester===
The polyester known as &quot;PET&quot; (polyethylene terephthalate) is used in carpet manufacturing in both spun and filament constructions. After the price of raw materials for many types of carpet rose in the early 2000s, polyester became more competitive. Polyester has good physical properties and is inherently stain-resistant because it is hydrophobic, however oil-based stains can pose a problem for this type of material and it can be prone to soiling. Similar to nylon, colour can be added after production or it can be infused in a molten state (solution dyeing). Polyester has the disadvantage that it tends to crush or mat down easily. It is typically used in mid- to low-priced carpeting.

Another polyester, &quot;PTT&quot; (Polytrimethylene terephthalate), also called Sorona or 3GT (Dupont) or Corterra (Shell), is a variant of PET. Lurgi Zimmer PTT was first patented in 1941, but it was not produced until the 1990s, when Shell Chemicals developed the low-cost method of producing high-quality 1,3 propanediol (PDO), the starting raw material for PTT Corterra Polymers. DuPont subsequently commercialized a biological process for making 1,3-propanediol from corn syrup, imparting significant renewable content on the corresponding Sorona polyester carpet fibers. These carpet fibers have resiliency comparable to nylon.

===Acrylic===
Acrylic is a synthetic material first created by the Dupont Corporation in 1941 but has gone through various changes since it was first introduced. In the past, acrylic carpet used to fuzz or &quot;pill&quot; easily. This happened when the fibres degraded over time and short strands broke away with contact or friction. Over the years, new types of acrylics have been developed to alleviate some of these problems, although the issues have not been completely removed. Acrylic is fairly difficult to dye but is colourfast, washable, and has the feel and appearance of wool, making it a good rug fabric.

==History==


The knotted pile carpet probably originated in the Caspian Sea area (Northern Iran) or the Armenian Highland. Although there is evidence of goats and sheep being sheared for wool and hair which was spun and woven as far back at the 7th millennium, the earliest surviving pile carpet is the &quot;Pazyryk carpet&quot;, which dates from the 5th-4th century BC. It was excavated by Sergei Ivanovich Rudenko in 1949 from a Pazyryk burial mound in the Altai Mountains in Siberia. This richly coloured carpet is and framed by a border of griffins.

Although claimed by many cultures, this square tufted carpet, almost perfectly intact, is considered by many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The rug is woven using the Armenian double knot, and the red filaments&#x27; color was made from Armenian cochineal. The eminent authority of ancient carpets, Ulrich Schurmann, says of it, &quot;From all the evidence available I am convinced that the Pazyryk rug was a funeral accessory and most likely a masterpiece of Armenian workmanship&quot;. Gantzhorn concurs with this thesis. At the ruins of Persepolis in Iran where various nations are depicted as bearing tribute, the horse design from the Pazyryk carpet is the same as the relief depicting part of the Armenian delegation.
The historian Herodotus writing in the 5th century BC also informs us that the inhabitants of the Caucasus wove beautiful rugs with brilliant colors which would never fade.

===Afghanistan===

There has recently been a surge in demand for Afghan carpets, although many Afghan carpet manufacturers market their products under the name of a different country. The carpets are made in Afghanistan, as well as by Afghan refugees who reside in Pakistan and Iran. Famous Afghan rugs include the &quot;Shindand&quot; or &quot;Adraskan&quot; (named after local Afghan villages), woven in the Herat area in western Afghanistan.

Afghan carpets are commonly known as Afghan rugs. Afghan carpets are a unique and widely recognized handmade material design that originates from Afghanistan. They often exhibit intricate detailing, mainly using traditional tribal designs originating from the Turkmens, Kazakhs, Balochs, and Uzbeks. The handmade rugs come in many patterns and colors, yet the traditional and most common example of Afghan carpet is the octagon-shaped elephant-foot (Bukhara). The rugs with this print are most commonly red in color. Many dyes, such as vegetable dyes, are used to impart rich color.

===Armenia===
Various rug fragments have been excavated in Armenia dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier. The oldest single surviving knotted carpet in existence is the Pazyryk carpet, excavated from a frozen tomb in Siberia, dated from the 5th to the 3rd century BC, now in the Hermitage Museum in St. Petersburg. This square tufted carpet, almost perfectly intact, is considered by many experts to be of Caucasian, specifically Armenian, origin. The eminent authority of ancient carpets, Ulrich Schurmann, says of it, &quot;From all the evidence available I am convinced that the Pazyryk rug was a funeral accessory and most likely a masterpiece of Armenian workmanship&quot;. Gantzhorn concurs with this thesis. At the ruins of Persepolis in Iran where various nations are depicted as bearing tribute, the horse design from the Pazyryk carpet is the same as the relief depicting part of the Armenian delegation.
Armenian carpets were renowned by foreigners who travelled to Artsakh; the Arab geographer and historian Al-Masudi noted that, among other works of art, he had never seen such carpets elsewhere in his life.

Art historian Hravard Hakobyan notes that &quot;Artsakh carpets occupy a special place in the history of Armenian carpet-making.&quot; Common themes and patterns found on Armenian carpets were the depiction of dragons and eagles. They were diverse in style, rich in colour and ornamental motifs, and were even separated in categories depending on what sort of animals were depicted on them, such as &quot;artsvagorgs&quot; (eagle-carpets), &quot;vishapagorgs&quot; (dragon-carpets) and &quot;otsagorgs&quot; (serpent-carpets). The rug mentioned in the Kaptavan inscriptions is composed of three arches, &quot;covered with vegatative ornaments&quot;, and bears an artistic resemblance to the illuminated manuscripts produced in Artsakh.

The art of carpet weaving was in addition intimately connected to the making of curtains as evidenced in a passage by Kirakos Gandzaketsi, a 13th-century Armenian historian from Artsakh, who praised Arzu-Khatun, the wife of regional prince Vakhtang Khachenatsi, and her daughters for their expertise and skill in weaving.

According to ancient perceptions, the carpet is the universe where, according to mythological conceptions, there is 
# The sacred center, 
# The cosmic space, 
# The zone demarcating and protecting the universe.

===Azerbaijan===
The Gultapin excavations discovered several carpet weaving tools which date back to the 4th-3rd millennium BC. According to Iranica Online, &quot;The main weaving zone was in the eastern TransCaucasus south of the mountains that bisect the region diagonally, the area now comprised in the Azerbaijan SSR; it is the homeland of a Turkic population known today as Azeri. Other ethnic groups also practiced weaving, some of them in other parts of the Caucasus, but they were of lesser importance.&quot; Azerbaijan was one of the most important centers of carpet weaving; as a result, several different schools have evolved. While traditionally schools are divided into four main branches, each region has its own version of the carpets. The schools are divided into four main branches: Kuba-Shirvan, Ganja-Kazakh carpet-weaving school, Baku carpet school, and Karabakh school of carpet weaving. Carpet weaving is a family tradition in Azerbaijan that is transferred verbally and with practice, and is associated with the daily life and customs of its people. A variety of carpet and rug types are made in Azerbaijan such as silk, wool, gold and silver threads, pile and pileless carpets, as well as kilim, sumakh, zili, verni, mafrashi and khurjun. In 2010, the traditional art of Azerbaijani carpet weaving was added to the Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity of UNESCO.

===Balochi===
Balochi Rugs are a group of carpets that are woven by the Baloch tribes. The size of Baloch rugs are eight feet in length, which made them lighter and easier to transport. Their material typically include of wool or a mixture of wool and goat hair, newer carpets have a warp made of cotton and sturdy wool pile rugs.

===China===

As opposed to most antique rug manufactory practices, early Chinese carpets were woven almost exclusively for internal consumption. China has a long history of exporting traditional goods; however, it was not until the first half of the 19th century that the Chinese began to export their rugs. Once in contact with western influences, there was a large change in production: Chinese manufactories began to produce art deco rugs with commercial look and price point. The centuries-old Chinese textile industry is rich in history. While most antique carpets are classified according to a specific region or manufactory, scholars attribute the age of any specific Chinese rug to the ruling emperor of the time. The earliest surviving examples of the craft were produced during the time of Chen Shubao, the last emperor of the Chen dynasty.

===India===
Carpet weaving may have been introduced into the area as far back as the 11th century with the coming of the first Muslim conquerors, the Ghaznavids and the Ghurids, from the West. It can with more certainty be traced to the beginning of the Mughal Empire in the early 16th century, when the last successor of Timur, Babur, extended his rule from Kabul to India to found the Mughal Empire. Under the patronage of the Mughals, Indian crafters adopted Persian techniques and designs. Carpets woven in the Punjab made use of motifs and decorative styles found in Mughal architecture.

Akbar, a Muhal emperor, is credited with introducing the art of carpet weaving to India during his reign. The Mughal emperors patronized Persian carpets for their royal courts and palaces. During this period, he brought Persian crafters from their homeland and established them in India. Initially, these Mughal carpets showed the classic Persian style of fine knotting, then gradually the style blended with Indian art. Thus the carpets produced became typical of Indian origin and the industry began to diversify and spread all over the subcontinent. During the Mughal period, carpets made on the Indian subcontinent became so famous that demand for them spread abroad. These carpets had distinctive designs and boasted a high density of knots. Carpets made for the Mughal emperors, including Jahangir and Shah Jahan, were of the finest quality. Under Shah Jahan&#x27;s reign, Mughal carpet weaving took on a new aesthetic and entered its classical phase. Indian carpets are well known for their designs with attention to detail and presentation of realistic attributes. The carpet industry in India flourished more in its northern part, with major centres found in Kashmir, Jaipur, Agra and Bhadohi.

Indian carpets are known for their high density of knotting. Hand-knotted carpets are a speciality and widely in demand in the West. The carpet industry in India has been successful in establishing social business models that help underprivileged sections of the society. Notable examples of social entrepreneurship ventures are Jaipur rugs and the Fabindia retail chain.

Another category of Indian rugs which, though quite popular in most western countries, have not received much press, is hand-woven rugs of Khairabad (Citapore rugs). Khairabad, a small town in the Citapore (now spelled as &quot;Sitapur&quot;) district of India had been ruled by Raja Mehmoodabad. Khairabad (Mehmoodabad Estate) was part of Oudh province which had been ruled by shi&#x27;i Muslims having Persian linkages. Citapore rugs made in Khairabad and neighbouring areas are hand-woven and distinct from tufted and knotted rugs. Flat weave is the basic weaving technique of Citapore rugs and generally cotton is the main weaving material here but jute, rayon, and chenille are also popular. IKEA and Agocha have been major buyers of rugs from this area.
=== Iran ===
Iranian carpet is derived from Persian art and culture. Carpet-weaving in Persia dates back to the Bronze Age. The earliest surviving corpus of Persian carpets comes from the Safavid dynasty (1501–1736) in the 16th century. However, painted depictions prove a longer history of production. There is much variety among classical Persian carpets of the 16th and 17th centuries. Common motifs include scrolling vine networks, arabesques, palmettes, cloud bands, medallions, and overlapping geometric compartments rather than animals and humans. This is because Islam, the dominant religion in that part of the world, forbids their depiction. Still, some show figures engaged either in the hunt or feasting scenes. The majority of these carpets are wool, but several silk examples produced in Kashan survive.

Iran is also the world&#x27;s largest producer and exporter of handmade carpets, producing three-quarters of the world&#x27;s total output and having a share of 30% of world&#x27;s export markets. The world&#x27;s largest hand-woven carpet was produced by Iran Carpet Company (ICC) at the order of the Diwan of the Royal Court of Sultanate of Oman to cover the entire floor of the main praying hall of the Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque (SQGM) in Muscat.

==== Balochi====
Balochi Rugs (Balochi:) are a group of carpets that are woven by the Baloch tribes. The size of Baloch rugs are eight feet in length, which made them lighter and easier to transport.

Baloch rugs tend to be a dark combination of reds, browns, and blues, with touches of white and their material often includes wool or a mixture of wool and goat hair; newer carpets have a warp made of cotton and sturdy wool pile rugs.

Baloch rugs are typically eight feet in length, which made them lighter and easier to transport.

Nature, animal figurines, religious beliefs in Baluch prayer rugs, and objects of interest and use by the people of the tribe and the villagers are visualized in these designs. They are mostly designed geometrically with lines and surfaces, creating abstract and non-abstract patterns.

Mehrabi is a prayer rug designed in the Balochi style, and it typically features a mihrab or arch at one end of the rug.

===Pakistan===
The art of weaving developed in South Asia at a time when few other civilizations employed it. Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjo-Daro, ancient cities of the Indus Valley civilization, have established that the inhabitants used spindles and spun a wide variety of weaving materials. Some historians consider that the Indus Valley civilization first developed the use of woven textiles. As of the late 1990s, hand-knotted carpets were among Pakistan&#x27;s leading export products and their manufacture is the second largest cottage and small industry. Pakistani craftsmen have the capacity to produce any type of carpet using all the popular motifs of gulls, medallions, paisleys, traceries, and geometric designs in various combinations. At the time of independence, manufacturing of carpets was set up in Sangla Hill, a small town of Sheikhupura District. Chaudary Mukhtar Ahmad Member, son of Maher Ganda, introduced and taught this art to locals and immigrants. He is considered founder of this industry in Pakistan. Sangla Hill is now a focal point of the carpet industry in Pakistan. Almost all the exporters and manufacturers who are running their business at Lahore, Faisalabad, and Karachi have their area offices in Sangla Hill.

In Pakistan, multiple material types are used including: wool, silk and cotton or jute etc. Carpet textures are typically soft and light in Pakistan.
===Scandinavia===
Scandinavian rugs are among the most popular of all weaves in modern design. Preferred by influential modernist thinkers, designers, and advocates for a new aesthetic in the mid-twentieth century, Scandinavian rugs have become widespread in many different avenues of contemporary interior design. With a long history of adaptation and evolution, the tradition of Scandinavian rug-making is among the most storied of all European rug-making traditions.

===Turkey===


Turkish carpets (also known as Anatolian), whether hand knotted or flat woven, are among the most well-known and established handcrafted artworks in the world. Historically: religious, cultural, environmental, sociopolitical and socioeconomic conditions created widespread utilitarian need and have provided artistic inspiration among the many tribal peoples and ethnic groups in Central Asia and Turkey. Turks, nomadic or pastoral, agrarian or town dwellers, living in tents or in sumptuous houses in large cities, have protected themselves from the extremes of the cold weather by covering the floors, and sometimes walls and doorways, with carpets and rugs. The carpets are always hand made of wool or sometimes cotton, with occasional additions of silk. These carpets are natural barriers against the cold. Turkish pile rugs and kilims are also frequently used as tent decorations, grain bags, camel and donkey bags, ground cushions, oven covers, sofa covers, bed and cushion covers, blankets, curtains, eating blankets, table top spreads, prayer rugs and for ceremonial occasions.

The oldest records of flat woven kilims come from Çatalhöyük Neolithic pottery, circa 7000 B.C. One of the oldest settlements ever to have been discovered, Çatalhöyük is located south east of Konya in the middle of the Anatolian region. The excavations to date (only three percent of the town) not only found carbonized fabric but also fragments of kilims painted on the walls of some of the dwellings. The majority of them represent geometric and stylized forms that are similar or identical to other historical and contemporary designs.

The knotted rug is believed to have reached Asia Minor and the Middle East with the expansion of various nomadic tribes peoples during the latter period of the great Turkic migration of the 8th and 9th centuries. Famously depicted in European paintings of The Renaissance, beautiful Anatolian rugs were often used from then until modern times, to indicate the high economic and social status of the owner.

Women learn their weaving skills at an early age, taking months or even years to complete the beautiful pile rugs and flat woven kilims that were created for their use in every aspect of daily life. As is true in most weaving cultures, traditionally and nearly exclusively, it is women and girls who are both artisan and weaver.

===Turkmen===

Türkmen carpet (also called &quot;Bukhara Uzbekistan&quot;) is a type of handmade floor-covering textile traditionally originating in Central Asia. It is useful to distinguish between the original Turkmen tribal rugs and the rugs produced in large numbers for export in the 2000s, mainly in Pakistan and Iran. The original Turkmen rugs were produced by the Turkmen tribes who are the main ethnic group in Turkmenistan and are also found in Afghanistan and Iran. They are used for various purposes, including tent rugs, door hangings and bags of various sizes.

===Uyghur===

Weaving was traditionally done by men in Uyghur society. Scholars speculate that when the Mongols invaded northwest China in the 13th century, under the leadership of General Subutai, they may have taken as captives some of these skilled carpet weavers.

===Europe===
====Oriental imports====
Oriental carpets began to appear in Europe after the Crusades in the 11th century, due to contact by Crusaders with Eastern traders. Until the mid-18th century they were mostly used on walls and tables. Except in royal or ecclesiastical settings, they were considered too precious to cover the floor. Starting in the 13th century, oriental carpets begin to appear in paintings (notably from Italy, Flanders, England, France, and the Netherlands). Carpets of Indo-Persian design were introduced to Europe via the Dutch, British, and French East India Companies of the 17th and 18th century and in the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth by Armenian merchants (Polish carpets or Polonaise carpets).

====Spain====

Although isolated instances of carpet production pre-date the Muslim invasion of Spain, the Hispano-Moresque examples are the earliest significant body of European-made carpets. Documentary evidence shows production beginning in Spain as early as the 10th century AD. The earliest extant Spanish carpet, the so-called Synagogue carpet in the Museum of Islamic Art, Berlin, is a unique survival dated to the 14th century. The earliest group of Hispano-Moresque carpets, Admiral carpets (also known as armorial carpets), has an all-over geometric, repeat pattern punctuated by blazons of noble Christian Spanish families. The variety of this design was analyzed most thoroughly by May Beattie. Many of the 15th century Spanish carpets rely heavily on designs originally developed on the Anatolian Peninsula. Carpet production continued after the Reconquest of Spain and eventual expulsion of the Muslim population in the 15th century. Sixteenth century Renaissance Spanish carpet design is a derivative of silk textile design. Some of the most popular motifs are wreaths, acanthus leaves and pomegranates.

During the Moorish (Muslim) period, production took place in Alcaraz in the province of Albacete, as well as being recorded in other towns. Carpet production after the Christian reconquest continued in Alcaraz while Cuenca, first recorded as a weaving centre in the 12th century, became increasingly important, and was dominant in the 17th and early 18th century. Carpets of completely different French-based designs began to be woven in a royal workshop, the Royal Tapestry Factory &quot;(Real Fábrica de Tapices de Santa Bárbara)&quot; in Madrid in the 18th century. Cuenca was closed down by the royal degree of Carlos IV in the late 18th century to stop it competing with the new workshop. Madrid continued as a weaving centre through to the 20th century, producing brightly coloured carpets, most of whose designs are strongly influenced by French carpet design, and which are frequently signed (on occasions with the monogram MD; also sometimes with the name Stuyck) and dated in the outer stripe. After the Spanish Civil War General Franco revived the carpet weaving industry in workshops named after him, weaving designs that are influenced by earlier Spanish carpets, usually in a very limited range of colours.

====Serbia====

Pirot carpet (Serbian: Пиротски ћилим, Pirotski ćilim) refers to a variety of flat tapestry-woven carpets or rugs traditionally produced in Pirot, a town in southeastern Serbia. Pirot kilims with some 122 ornaments and 96 different types have been protected by geographical indication in 2002. They are one of the most important traditional handicrafts in Serbia. In the late 19th century and up to the Second World War, Pirot kilims have been frequently used as insignia of Serbian and Yugoslav royalty. This tradition was revived in 2011 when Pirot kilims were reintroduced for state ceremonies in Serbia. Carpet weaving in Pirot dates back to the Middle Ages. One of the first mentions of the Pirot kilim in written sources date to 1565, when it was said that the šajkaši boats on the Danube and Drava were covered with Pirot kilims. Pirot was once the most important rug-making centre in the Balkans. Pirot is located on the historical main highway which linked central Europe with Constantinople. Pirot was also known as Şarköy in Turkish. The Pirot carpet varieties are also found in Bulgaria and Turkey, and in many other international collections. One of the chief qualities are the colour effects achieved through the choice and arrangement of colours.

In the beginning of the 19th century, plant dyes were replaced by aniline colourings. &quot;The best product of the country is the Pirot carpet, worth about ten shillings a square metre. The designs are extremely pretty, and the rugs, without being so heavy as the Persian, or so ragged and scant in the web and weft as Caramanian, wear for ever. The manufacture of these is almost entirely confined to Pirot. From Pirots old Turkish signification as Şarköy stems the traditional trade name of the rugs as Şarköy-kilims. Stemming from the homonym to the today&#x27;s Turkish settlement of Şarköy in Thracia, which had no established rug making tradition, Şarköys are often falsely ascribed to originate from Turkey. Also in the rug-selling industry, Şarköy are mostly labeled as being of oriental or Turkish origin as to easier sell them to non-familiar customers as they prefer rugs with putative oriental origin. In fact, Şarköys have been established from the 17th century in the region of the Western Balkan or Stara Planina mountains in the towns of Pirot, Berkowiza, Lom, Chiprovtsi and Samokov. Later they have been also produced in Knjaževac and Caribrod.

====Bulgaria====

The Chiprovtsi carpet (Чипровци килим) is a type of handmade carpet with two absolutely identical sides, part of Bulgarian national heritage, traditions, arts and crafts. Its name is derived from the town of Chiprovtsi where their production started in the 17th century. The carpet weaving industry played a key role in the revival of Chiprovtsi in the 1720s after the devastation of the failed 1688 Chiprovtsi Uprising against Ottoman rule. The western traveller Ami Boué, who visited Chiprovtsi in 1836–1838, reported that &quot;mainly young girls, under shelters or in corridors, engage in carpet weaving. They earn only five francs a month and the payment was even lower before&quot;. By 1868, the annual production of carpets in Chiprovtsi had surpassed 14,000 square metres. In 1896, almost 1,400 women from Chiprovtsi and the region were engaged in carpet weaving. In 1920, the locals founded the &quot;Manual Labour&quot; carpet-weaving cooperative society, the first of its kind in the country. At present. the carpet (&quot;kilim&quot;) industry remains dominant in the town. Carpets have been crafted according to traditional designs, but in recent years it is up to the customers to decide the pattern of the carpet they have ordered. The production of a single carpet takes about 50 days; primarily women engage in carpet weaving. Work is entirely manual and all used materials are natural; the primary material is wool, coloured using plant or mineral dyes. The local carpets have been prized at exhibitions in London, Paris, Liège and Brussels. In recent decades, however, the Chiprovtsi carpet industry has been in decline as it had lost its firm foreign markets. As a result, the town and the municipality have been experiencing a demographic crisis.

====France====
In 1608 Henry IV initiated the French production of &quot;Turkish style&quot; carpets under the direction of Pierre DuPont. This production was soon moved to the Savonnerie factory in Chaillot just west of Paris. The earliest, well-known group produced by the Savonnerie, then under the direction of Simon Lourdet, are the carpets that were produced in the early years of Louis XIV&#x27;s reign. They are densely ornamented with flowers, sometimes in vases or baskets, against dark blue or brown grounds in deep borders. The designs are based on Netherlandish and Flemish textiles and paintings. The most famous Savonnerie carpets are the series made for the Grande Galerie and the Galerie d&#x27;Apollon in the Palais du Louvre between c. 1665 and c. 1685. These 105 masterpieces, made under the artistic direction of Charles Le Brun, were never installed, as Louis XIV moved the court to Versailles in 1688. Their design combines rich acanthus leaves, architectural framing, and mythological scenes (inspired by Cesare Ripa&#x27;s Iconologie) with emblems of Louis XIV&#x27;s royal power.

Pierre-Josse Joseph Perrot is the best-known of the mid-eighteenth-century carpet designers. His many surviving works and drawings display graceful rococo s-scrolls, central rosettes, shells, acanthus leaves, and floral swags. The Savonnerie manufactory was moved to the Gobelins in Paris in 1826. The Beauvais manufactory, better known for their tapestry, also made knotted pile carpets from 1780 to 1792. Carpet production in small, privately owned workshops in the town of Aubusson began in 1743. Carpets produced in France employ the symmetrical knot.

====England====

Knotted pile carpet weaving technology probably came to England in the early 16th century with Flemish Calvinists fleeing religious persecution. Because many of these weavers settled in south-eastern England, particularly in Norwich, the fourteen extant 16th and 17th century carpets are sometimes referred to as &quot;Norwich carpets&quot;. These works are either adaptations of Anatolian or Indo-Persian designs, or employ Elizabethan-Jacobean scrolling vines and blossoms; all but one are dated or bear a coat of arms. Like the French, English weavers used the symmetrical knot. There are documented and surviving examples of carpets from three 18th-century manufactories: Exeter (1756–1761, owned by Claude Passavant, 3 extant carpets), Moorfields (1752–1806, owned by Thomas Moore, 5 extant), and Axminster (1755–1835, owned by Thomas Whitty, numerous extant).

Exeter and Moorfields were both staffed with renegade weavers from the French Savonnerie and, therefore, employ the weaving structure of that factory and Perrot-inspired designs. Neoclassical designer Robert Adam supplied designs for both Moorfields and Axminster carpets based on Roman floor mosaics and coffered ceilings. Some of the most well-known rugs of his design were made for Syon House, Osterley House, Harewood House, Saltram House, and Newby Hall.

===== Axminster carpet =====
Axminster carpet was a unique floor covering first made in a factory founded at Axminster, Devon, in 1755 by the cloth weaver Thomas Whitty. Resembling somewhat the Savonnerie carpets produced in France, Axminster carpets were symmetrically knotted by hand in wool on woollen warps, and had a weft of flax or hemp. Like the French carpets, they often featured Renaissance architectural or floral patterns; others mimicked oriental patterns. Similar carpets were produced at the same time in Exeter and in the Moorfields area of London and, shortly before, at Fulham in Middlesex. The Whitty factory closed in 1835 with the advent of machine-made carpeting. The name Axminster, however, survived as a generic term for machine-made carpets whose pile is produced by techniques similar to those used in making velvet or chenille, and Axminster Carpets Ltd resumed production at a new site in the town in 1937.

Axminster carpets can use the three main types of broadloom carpet construction: machine-woven, tufted and hand-knotted. Machine-woven carpet is an investment that will last 20 or 30 years, and woven Axminster and Wilton carpets are still popular in areas where longevity and design flexibility are a big part of the purchasing decision. Hotels and leisure venues almost always choose these types, and many homes use woven Axminsters as design statements.

Machine-woven carpets like Axminster and Wilton are made by massive looms that weave together &#x27;bobbins&#x27; of carpet yarn and backing. The finished result, which can be intricately patterned, creates a floor that provides supreme underfoot luxury with high performance. Tufted carpets are also popular in the home. They are relatively speedy to make: a pre-woven backing has yarns tufted into it. Needles push the yarn through the backing, which is then held in place with underlying &quot;loopers&quot;. Tufted carpets can be twist pile, velvet, or loop pile. Twist pile carpets are produced when one or more fibres are twisted in the tufting process, so that in the finished carpet they appear to be bound together. Velvet pile carpets tend to have a shorter pile and a tighter construction, giving the finished article a smooth, velvety appearance. Loop pile carpets are renowned for being hard wearing and lend carpets great texture. The traditional domain of rugs from faraway continents, hand knotted squares and rugs use the expertise of weavers to produce work of the finest quality. Traditional rugs often feature a deliberate mistake on behalf of the weaver to guarantee their authenticity.

Six patterns of Axminster carpet are known as the Lansdowne group. These have a tripartite design with reeded circles and baskets of flowers in the central panel, flanked by diamond lozenges in the side panels. Axminster Rococo designs often have a brown ground and include birds copied from popular, contemporary engravings. Even now a large percentage of the 55,000 population of the town still seek employment in this industry.

===== Brussels and Wilton carpets =====
The town of Wilton, Wiltshire is also known for its carpet weaving, which dates back to the 18th century.

The Brussels loom was introduced into England towards the middle of the 18th century and marked the beginning of a new era in carpet-weaving. It was the first loom on which a pile carpet could be woven mechanically, the pile consisting of rows of loops, formed over wires inserted weftwise during weaving and subsequently withdrawn. Brussels was the first type of carpet to be woven in a loom incorporating the Jacquard pattern-selecting mechanism, and in 1849 power was applied to the loom by Biglow in the United States.

Later, when bladed wires were developed, the pile loops were severed on withdrawal of the wires to produce a carpet known as Wilton, and after this development the loom became known as the Wilton loom. In modern usage the designation Wilton applies to both cut-pile and loop-pile carpets made in this loom. The latter are now variously described as Brussels-Wilton, round wire Wilton, loop-pile Wilton, and round wired Jacquard. The methods of manufacture, including the principles of design, preparatory processes, and weaving, are the same in most respects for both Brussels and Wilton qualities. The chief difference between them is that whereas Brussels loop-pile is secured satisfactorily by the insertion of two picks of weft to each wire (2-shot), the Wilton cut-pile is woven more often with three picks of weft to each wire (3-shot) to ensure that the tufts are firmly secured in the carpet backing.

Brussels carpets have a smooth slightly ribbed surface and their patterning is well defined, a characteristic feature of the carpet. Closeness of pile rather than height contributes to their neat appearance and hard-wearing properties, although they do not simulate the luxury of cut-pile carpets. Brussels Wilton carpets were initially produced on 27-inch (3/4) looms and were sewn together by hand. The looms could incorporate up to five frames, each with a different colour, thus enabling figured or pattern carpets to be manufactured. With judicial and skilful planting of colours in the frames the number of colours could be increased to about twenty, enabling complex designs to be produced. Due to the additional costs in labour these carpets were normally only produced for the bespoke market.

After the First World War, the carpets started to be produced for the general market using popular designs and colourways but they always remained at the luxury end of the general market. The growing middle class of the twentieth century aspired to acquire a Wilton carpet for their &#x27;best&#x27; room. Despite the impact of industrialization, the areas where Brussels Wilton carpets were produced remained centred around the towns of Wilton, Kidderminster in the West Midlands, and in West Yorkshire where the firm of John Crossley and Sons in Halifax became synonymous with carpet manufacture. There were smaller areas of manufacture in Scotland and Durham. With the development of different manufacturing methods and looms capable of the mass production of carpets, the public began change their décor, including carpets, on a regular basis, which increased the demand for carpets. The last quarter of the 20th century saw the rapid decline of the labour-intensive Brussels Wilton carpets. Very few of the original ¾ Wilton looms still exist, and the few that do are either in museums or used by small manufacturers that continue to produce custom made luxury carpets for the elite and to replace carpets in historic buildings in the UK and abroad.

==Modern carpeting and installation==

Carpet is commonly made in widths of in the US, 4 m and 5 m in Europe. Where necessary different widths can be seamed together with a seaming iron and seam tape (formerly it was sewn together) and it is fixed to a floor over a cushioned underlay (pad) using nails, tack strips (known in the UK as gripper rods), adhesives, or occasionally decorative metal stair rods, thus distinguishing it from rugs or mats, which are loose-laid floor coverings. For environmental reasons, the use of wool, natural bindings, natural padding, and formaldehyde-free glues is becoming more common. These options are almost always at a premium cost.

In the UK, some carpets are still manufactured for yachts, hotels, pubs and clubs in a narrow width of and then sewn to size. Carpeting which covers an entire room area is loosely referred to as &#x27;wall-to-wall&#x27;, but carpet can be installed over any portion thereof with use of appropriate transition moldings where the carpet meets other types of floor coverings. Carpeting is more than just a single item; it is, in fact, a system comprising the carpet itself, the carpet backing (often made of latex), the cushioning underlay, and a method of installation.
Carpet tiles are also available, typically square. These are usually only used in commercial settings and are affixed using a special pressure-sensitive glue, which holds them into place while allowing easy removal (in an office environment, for example) or allowing rearrangement in order to spread wear.

&quot;Carpet binding&quot; is a term used for any material being applied to the edge of a carpet to make a rug. Carpet binding is usually cotton or nylon, but also comes in many other materials such as leather. Non-synthetic binding is frequently used with bamboo, grass and wool rugs, but is often used with carpet made from other materials.

The GoodWeave labelling scheme used throughout Europe and North America assures that child labour has not been used: importers pay for the labels, and the revenue collected is used to monitor centres of production and educate previously exploited children.

==Disposal==
For the year 2018 in the U.S., the recycling of carpet fiber, backing, and padding was 310,000 tons, which was 9.2 percent of carpet generation. A slightly larger proportion (17.8 percent) was combusted for energy recovery, while the majority of rugs and carpets were landfilled (73 percent).

As of 2023 according to the EPA over four billion pounds of carpet enter the solid waste stream in the United States every year, accounting for more than one percent by weight and about two percent by volume of all municipal solid waste (MSW). Furthermore, according to EPA, &quot;the bulky nature of carpet creates collection and handling problems for solid waste operations and the variety of materials present in carpet makes it difficult to recycle.&quot;

==In culture and figurative expressions==
There are many stories about magic carpets, legendary flying carpets that can be used to transport people who are on it instantaneously or quickly to their destination. Disney&#x27;s &quot;Aladdin&quot; depicts a magic carpet found by Aladdin and Abu in the Cave of Wonders while trying to find Genie&#x27;s lamp. Aladdin and Jasmine ride on the carpet to travel around the world. The term &quot;magic carpet&quot; is first attested in 1816. From the 16th to the 19th century, the term &quot;carpet&quot; was used &quot;...as an adjective often with a tinge of contempt, when used of men (as in carpet-knight, 1570s)&quot;, which meant a man who was associated with &quot;...luxury, ladies&#x27; boudoirs, and drawing rooms&quot;. &quot;Rolling out the red carpet&quot; is an expression that means to welcome a guest lavishly and handsomely. In some cases, an actual red carpet is used for VIPs and celebrities to walk on, such as at the Cannes Film Festival and when foreign dignitaries are welcomed to a country.

In 1820s British servant slang, to &quot;carpet&quot; someone means to call them for a reprimand. To be called on the carpet means to be summoned for a serious reason, typically a scolding reprimand; this usage dates from 1900, referring to the carpeted office of a person in authority, such as a schoolmaster or employer. A stronger variant of this expression, to be &quot;hauled on the carpet&quot;, implies an even sterner reprimand. Carpet bombing is a type of bombing from airplanes which developed in the 20th century in which an entire city is bombed (rather than precise strikes on military targets). The slang expression &quot;laugh at the carpet&quot; means to vomit on the floor (especially a carpeted floor). The expression &quot;on the carpet&quot; refers to a matter which is under discussion or consideration. The term &quot;carpet muncher&quot; is a derogatory slang term for a lesbian; this expression is first attested in 1992.

The term carpet bag, which literally refers to a suitcase made from a piece of carpet, is used in several figurative contexts. The term gained a popular usage after the American Civil War to refer to carpetbaggers, Northerners who moved to the South after the war, especially during the Reconstruction era (1865–1877). Carpetbaggers allegedly politically manipulated and controlled former Confederate states for financial and power gains. In modern usage in the U.S., the term is sometimes used derisively to refer to a politician who runs for public office in an area where they do not have deep community ties, or have lived only for a short time. In the United Kingdom, the term was adopted to refer informally to those who join a mutual organization, such as a building society, in order to force it to demutualize, that is, to convert into a joint stock company, solely for personal financial gain.

&quot;Cutting the rug&quot; is a slang term for dancing which originated in 1942. The use of the term &quot;rug&quot; as an informal term for a &quot;toupee&quot; (man&#x27;s wig) is theater slang from 1940. The term &quot;sweep [something] under the rug&quot; or &quot;sweep [something] under the carpet&quot; figuratively refers to situations where a person or organization is hiding something embarrassing or negative; this use was first recorded in 1953. The figurative expression &quot;pull the rug out from under (someone)&quot;, meaning to suddenly deprive of important support, or to upset their plans or make their plans fall through, is first attested to in 1936, in American English.

A related figurative expression used centuries earlier was &quot;cut the grass under (one&#x27;s) feet&quot;, which is attested to in the 1580s. A &quot;rugrat&quot; or &quot;rug-rat&quot; is a slang term for a baby or child, first attested in 1968. The expression &quot;snug as a bug in a rug&quot; means wrapped up tight, warm, and comfortable. To &quot;lie like a rug&quot; means to tell lies shamelessly.

<text>Seattle–Tacoma International Airport is the primary international airport serving Seattle and its surrounding metropolitan area in the U.S. state of Washington. It is in the city of SeaTac, which was named after the airport&#x27;s nickname Sea–Tac, approximately south of downtown Seattle and north-northeast of downtown Tacoma. The airport is the busiest in the Pacific Northwest region of North America and is owned by the Port of Seattle.

The entire airport covers an area of and has three parallel runways. It is the primary hub for Alaska Airlines, whose headquarters are near the airport. The airport is also a hub and international gateway for Delta Air Lines, which has expanded at the airport since 2011. , 31 airlines operate at Sea–Tac, serving 91 domestic and 28 international destinations in North America, Oceania, Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.

Sea–Tac was developed in the 1940s to replace Boeing Field, which had been converted to military use during World War II. A site near Bow Lake was chosen in 1942 and construction began the following year with funding from the federal government, Port of Seattle, and the City of Tacoma. The first scheduled commercial flights from the airport began in September 1947 and the terminal was dedicated on July 9, 1949. Sea–Tac was expanded in 1961 to accommodate jetliners and added new concourses and satellite terminals by 1973. The main runway was extended several times and twinned in 1970; the third runway opened in 2008 following several decades of planning due to local opposition. 

Several major concourse expansions and renovations were initiated in the 2010s to accommodate passenger growth at Sea–Tac, which had become a new hub for Delta Air Lines. A new international arrivals facility opened in 2022 as part of the program. In 2023, Sea–Tac served 50,887,260 passengers, 2 percent below the all-time record set in 2019.

In 2024, Seattle–Tacoma International Airport set an all-time record with 52,640,716 passengers served, breaking the record set in 2019 with 51.8 million passengers, and 3.45% higher than in 2023. 

==History==

===Construction and early growth (1942–1967)===

A shared public airport was proposed by the Port of Seattle and Port of Tacoma in the late 1920s, but deferred plans after the legality of public ports operating such facilities was rejected by the state attorney general in a published opinion. The state legislature authorized municipal corporations such as public ports to establish aviation facilities in 1941. The Port of Seattle accepted a $1 million grant (equivalent to $ in dollars) from the Civil Aeronautics Administration in March 1942 to construct a new airport to serve the Seattle area after the U.S. military took control of Boeing Field during World War II. A site on U.S. Route 99 near Bow Lake south of Seattle was chosen at the end of the month ahead of another candidate near Lake Sammamish that was considered too close to the Cascade Range. The City of Tacoma provided $100,000 towards the airport&#x27;s construction costs as part of a deal for the Bow Lake site, centered around an existing private airfield plagued by heavy fog. Construction of the airport, which was named Seattle–Tacoma in recognition of Tacoma&#x27;s contribution, began with a groundbreaking ceremony on January 2, 1943.

The project was originally estimated to cost $1.7 million (equivalent to $ in dollars), but the sandy soil conditions drove the final construction price to over $4.2 million (equivalent to $ in dollars). The airport&#x27;s plateau was formed through of excavated earth. A proposal to rename the airport for Boeing president Philip G. Johnson shortly after his death in September 1944 was rejected by Port of Seattle commissioners due to the objections of Tacoma. The first ceremonial landing at Seattle–Tacoma Airport was made on October 31, 1944, by a United Air Lines DC-3 carrying local elected officials and civic leaders. The first commercial flights launched in May 1945 with Northwest Airlines, but use was limited due to the U.S. Army Air Force&#x27;s need for the airport to stage Boeing B-29 bombers for delivery. Various airlines had irregular flights to the airport, which used a Quonset hut with limited heating as a terminal until a permanent building was financed by a bond issue that voters approved in 1946.

The first scheduled commercial flights began on September 1, 1947, with Northwest Airlines and Western Airlines operating ten daily departures. They were joined by United, Alaska, Trans-Canada, Western, and Pan Am by 1951 as airlines departed from Boeing Field. The terminal at the renamed Seattle–Tacoma International Airport was formally dedicated by Governor Arthur Langlie on July 9, 1949, in front of a crowd of 30,000 spectators. The building, designed by architect Herman A. Moldenhour, included a rooftop control tower and glass courting walls in the concourses. The airport originally had four runways at 45-degree angles, between long, for crosswind operations. The two perpendicular runways were arranged into an &quot;X&quot;-shape that intersected near the longest, north–south runway; an additional runway to the south ran east–west. The terminal building&#x27;s &quot;inverted V&quot; shape was arranged to match the runway layout. The north–south runway (now Runway 16L/34R) was lengthened to in 1950, to in 1955, and to in 1958 to support commercial jetliners.

The first parking lot at Sea–Tac opened in 1955 with room for 527 vehicles. The United States Postal Service opened its air mail terminal at the airport in 1957 to serve areas west of the Mississippi River and mail bound for Asia; other government agencies, including the Weather Bureau and the Customs Service also established offices at Sea–Tac. On June 28, 1959, Japan Airlines became the first international carrier to operate at Sea–Tac when it began its service to Tokyo. Several projects were completed by 1961 to prepare for the Seattle World&#x27;s Fair the following year, including a runway extension over South 188th Street, which was placed in an automobile tunnel that opened in July 1961. During construction of the runway extension in February 1961, the fossilized skeleton of a &quot;Megalonyx jeffersonii&quot; giant sloth was discovered and excavated for display at the Burke Museum in Seattle. The two-story North Concourse (later named Concourse D) opened a month later with four gate positions to prepare for regular jetliner service; the concourse&#x27;s wing was long and wide. Jetliner service began in October with Pan Am&#x27;s Boeing 707 to Honolulu. The South Concourse (now Concourse A) opened in May 1961 alongside an expanded parking lot with capacity for 2,000 vehicles.

The long Concourse B opened in December 1964. It added eight gate positions, bringing the total to 19, a area housing international arrivals and the offices of U.S. Customs, Immigration, Public Health and the Department of Agriculture. Concourse C opened in July 1966. Four years later, it was extended to include another 10 gates, bringing the total to 35. The first non-stop flights from Sea–Tac to mainland Europe began in September 1966 with Scandinavian Airlines, who used a polar route to reach Copenhagen. A parallel second runway was completed west of the main runway in 1970.

===Later expansions and third runway (1967–2008)===

The Port embarked on a major expansion plan, designed by The Richardson Associates and lasting from 1967 to 1973, adding a second runway, a parking garage, two satellite terminals and other improvements. In 1973, $28 million new terminal was built over and around the 1949 structure; the new terminal quadrupled the area for public use. On July 1, 1973, the airport opened two new satellite terminals, along with an underground train system to connect them to the Main Terminal. These fully automatic shuttle trains were among the first of their kind in the United States. Also unprecedented in any U.S. airport: as part of the expansion the Port commissioned $300,000 worth of artworks; these were the start of what would become a large public art collection owned by the Port.

In the mid-1980s, the Main Terminal was renovated and another was added to the north end. Concourse D was expanded in 1987 with a rotunda that added four new gates. In 1993, Concourses B, C, and D were renovated. The project, designed by NBBJ, included the addition of and the renovation of of space in Concourses B, C, and D. On June 15, 2004, the new Concourse A was unveiled with 14 new gates, a dozen new restaurants, new artwork and the airport&#x27;s first moving sidewalks.

Residents of the surrounding area filed lawsuits against the Port in the early 1970s, complaining of noise, vibration, smoke, and other problems. The Port and the government of King County adopted the Sea–Tac Communities Plan in 1976 to address problems and guide future development. The Port spent more than $100 million over the next decade to buy homes and school buildings in the vicinity, and soundproof others nearby. In the mid-1980s, the airport participated in the airport noise-compatibility program initiated by Congress in 1979. Airport-noise contours were developed, real estate was purchased and some homes were retrofitted to achieve noise mitigation.

In 1978 the U.S. ended airline regulation, and the U.S. airlines were allowed to determine routes and fares without government approval. Deregulation resulted in some new service to Seattle, including from TWA, then the fourth-largest U.S. airline, as well as Delta, National, and American.


Shortly after the death of U.S. Senator Henry Martin &quot;Scoop&quot; Jackson, the Port Commission voted on September 13, 1983, to change the airport&#x27;s name to the Henry M. Jackson International Airport. Citizens of Tacoma were angered by the removal of their city&#x27;s name despite their contribution to the airport&#x27;s original construction budget, which had come with a promise to share the name. An additional complicating factor was the existence of another Jackson International Airport (now Jackson–Medgar Wiley Evers International Airport) in Jackson, Mississippi. During the November 1983 elections, an advisory referendum in Tacoma on the airport&#x27;s name endorsed the original name by a 4–1 margin and two incumbent Port commissioners were defeated by candidates in favor of restoring the Sea–Tac name. Helen Jackson, the widow of the late senator, expressed her desire that their family remain neutral in the debate. With a 3–2 vote of the Port Commission on February 28, 1984, the name reverted to Seattle–Tacoma International Airport and the four signs with Jackson&#x27;s name were removed.

In the late 1980s, the Port of Seattle and a council representing local county governments considered the future of air traffic in the region and predicted that the airport could reach capacity by 2000. The rising use of regional airliners such as Horizon Air caused aircraft movements to triple from 1978 to 1990 and air cargo use at the airport had also risen dramatically. In 1992, the planning committee concluded that the best solution was to add a third runway to the airport and construct a supplemental two-runway airport in one of the neighboring counties. Members of the community opposed a third runway, as did the Highline School District and the cities of Des Moines, Burien, Federal Way, Tukwila, and Normandy Park, but a 1994 study concluded there were no feasible sites for an additional airport. The Port of Seattle approved a plan for the new runway in 1996, prompting a lawsuit from opponents. The Port secured the necessary permits by agreeing to noise reduction programs and environmental protections. Runway opponents appealed these permits, but dropped their challenges in 2004.

The third runway, measuring long, opened on November 20, 2008, with a construction cost of $1.1 billion. Parallel to the existing two, the new runway is west of runway 34R, allowing landings on both in times of low visibility. The older runways are apart, too close to allow use of both in low visibility. The third runway project included of fill dirt and several retaining walls, the longest of which is long and tall.

===Modernization and expansion (2008–present)===

The airport&#x27;s Central Terminal building was renovated and expanded in 2003 in a project designed by Curtis W. Fentress, of Fentress Architects. The renovation and expansion began in 1996 and underwent extensive modifications to accommodate new security requirements following the September 11 attacks in 2001.

In 2014, Delta Air Lines announced plans to expand Seattle into a transpacific hub. Since then, Delta has added numerous international flights and dozens of domestic flights to feed those services. Delta&#x27;s increased presence in Seattle has been seen by some industry analysts as a response to United Airlines&#x27; transpacific hub at San Francisco, as well as Delta&#x27;s disenchantment with its former Tokyo–Narita hub.

In late 2021, shortly after Alaska Airlines joined American Airlines in the Oneworld alliance, American announced that they would increase their international presence in Seattle. However, as of 2023, American had abandoned plans for long-haul flights to Asia from Seattle (including its proposed service to Bangalore, India) and ended service to London-Heathrow, their only intercontinental service from Seattle.

The North Satellite Terminal only received limited upgrades since it opened in 1973, and needed modernization. The Port of Seattle initially looked at simply updating the terminal in a project it called the North Satellite Renovation Plan (NorthSTAR). In 2016, the Port announced it would also significantly expand the terminal. The $550 million project called the North Satellite Modernization increased the size of the North Satellite by and another eight gates, bringing the total to 20. The project&#x27;s first phase, dedicated on July 11, 2019, expanded the terminal to the west by and added eight gates, a mezzanine level with eateries, and a rooftop lounge for Alaska Airlines. The second phase modernized the remaining areas of the old terminal and expands dining and retail space around the twenty existing gates. The new terminal opened on June 29, 2021.

In 2022, the Port of Seattle completed a new International Arrivals Facility (IAF) east of Concourse A, along with a -long high bridge that will take passengers from the South Satellite, up above the existing taxiway and over the top of Concourse A. The project was initially expected to be completed by 2021 at a cost of $766 million, though revised to $968 million in late 2018. The old customs and immigration facility was located in the basement of the South Satellite, and operated well over its design capacity. Additionally, the process for passengers was complicated by the satellite&#x27;s isolated location. With the opening of the new IAF, Concourse A will now also be used for arriving international flights, nearly doubling the number of gates capable of serving arriving international passengers. The South Satellite Terminal is also planned to be renovated. The IAF was initially designed to accommodate 20 widebody aircraft, but four gates were not built to those specifications; the discrepancy was described as a &quot;design flaw&quot; by the Port of Seattle and blamed on the project&#x27;s contractor.

The airport&#x27;s digital infrastructure, including its website, phone lines, check-in system, and automated baggage sorting, was disabled by a cyberattack on August 24, 2024. Most of the systems were restored by August 31, but the Port of Seattle websites and passenger information systems remained offline.

===Future===
The airport has seen record growth in passenger traffic in the 2010s and 2020s. The busiest day for outbound passengers was July 24, 2023, with 73,651 passengers; more than 198,000 passengers (departing, arriving, and connecting) passed through the airport that day. The previous record for outbound passengers was set on August 16, 2019, at 72,154. The growth has been partly fueled by the nationwide expansion of Seattle-based Alaska Airlines and by Delta Air Lines setting up a major international hub at SEA Airport. That growth has strained the airport&#x27;s facilities and led the port to invest more than $2 billion into several expansion and renovation projects.

The airport has six outbound baggage handling systems with limited to no cross-connectivity. The system now in place is aging and reaching its maximum capacity. A $320.4 million project will create one unified, high-speed baggage system under the airport. That will allow bags to be checked from any ticketing counter, to receive security screening faster, and to be routed to any gate in the airport. The extra efficiency and speed will allow the airport to handle more baggage in the future without expanding the footprint of the baggage handling systems. The initial phase of the project was finished in 2018 and the entire system is scheduled to be completed in 2027.

With estimates that the Puget Sound region will grow by another one million people by 2035, the Port of Seattle began developing the Sustainable Airport Master Plan (SAMP) in 2018 to meet passenger and cargo demands. The SAMP recommends more than 30 projects to improve efficiency and airport access, including a new terminal with 19 gates and an automated people mover through three separate stations. Near-term projects that are scheduled to be completed in the 2020s include restroom renovations, security checkpoint expansion, and roadway realignment. A four-story addition to the existing structure of Concourse C began in 2023 and is scheduled to be completed in 2027 at a cost of $399 million; it includes a &quot;central gathering place&quot; under a large wooden ceiling. Further projects include an automated parking garage guidance system, a gateway project in cooperation with Alaska Airlines, Concourse A building expansion for lounges, improved curbside safety and accessibility, continued refurbishment of the Central Terminal, and a replacement of controls pertaining to the SEA Underground shuttles.

==Facilities==

===Terminals===

The airport has 115 gates in four concourses and two satellite buildings. The two satellite terminal buildings, named the North and South Satellites, are connected to the four concourses in the main terminal by a three-line automated people mover system called the SEA Underground. The underground transit system moves passengers within the four concourses of the central terminal and out to the two satellite terminals.

All non-precleared international arrivals arrive at the South Satellite or Concourse A, regardless of their departure terminal. A dedicated international arrivals facility with customs control is on the southeast side of the terminal building and connected to the South Satellite via an overhead walkway and to the Concourse A gates via sterile walkways. The overhead bridge from the South Satellite is long and rises over a taxiway.

* Concourse A contains 16 gates, and is primarily used by Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, and several international carriers.
* Concourse B contains 17 gates, and is primarily used by Delta Air Lines and Southwest Airlines.
* Concourse C contains 27 gates, and is used exclusively by Alaska Airlines.
* Concourse D contains 17 gates, and is mainly used by Alaska Airlines and American Airlines.
* North Satellite contains 20 gates, and is used exclusively by Alaska Airlines.
* South Satellite contains 14 gates, and is used by Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, and many domestic and international carriers.

The five security checkpoints at Sea–Tac are located in the main terminal and are managed by the Transportation Security Administration (TSA). All of the checkpoints offer Clear Secure prescreening, while TSA Precheck is available from two. The airport began using a virtual queuing program, called SEA Spot Saver, in 2021 to reduce wait times and control crowds at security lines. Wait times at the TSA checkpoints during peak departure periods averaged 20 minutes in 2019 and increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, with a maximum of 90 minutes reached in June 2023. During particularly busy periods, the queues for security have backed up into the airport&#x27;s main parking garage and caused several hours of delays for passengers.

The Port of Seattle maintains and curates a collection of public artwork at Sea–Tac that began with acquisitions in 1968 and was formalized with a percent for art ordinance passed in 2000. The airport&#x27;s art collection comprises 289 works, which includes paintings, murals, stained glass pieces, video art, and sculptures, and is valued at $40 million. A live music program began as a one-year pilot in 2013 with 20 musicians who performed for 780 total hours. It was expanded into a permanent airport fixture the following year during daytime hours and was temporarily replaced by a video wall during the COVID-19 pandemic in 2021.

===Airfield===
The three parallel runways run nearly north–south, west of the passenger terminal, and are long. In calendar year 2023, the airport had 422,508 aircraft operations, or 1,158 per day: 99% commercial, &lt;1% air taxi, &lt;1% general aviation, and &lt;1% military. 

A new control tower was built beginning in 2001 and opened in November 2004, at the cost of $26 million. The floor of the new tower&#x27;s control cab is above ground level; the tower&#x27;s overall height including antennas is . The cab has of space and was designed to support operation by ten controllers, with possible future expansion up to 15. The site and construction method of the tower were designed to maximize the visibility and efficacy of radar systems. The airport&#x27;s original control tower, built in the 1950s, is now part of the passenger terminal and used as a ramp control tower after being repaired from damage caused by the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.

A recurring problem at the airport is the misidentification of the westernmost taxiway, Taxiway Tango, as a runway. A large &quot;X&quot; has been placed on the north end of the taxiway, but many aircraft have landed on the taxiway. The FAA issued an alert notice dated from August 27, 2009, to September 24, 2009, urging airplanes about taking precautions such as REILs and other visual cues while landing from the north.

In 2007, the airport became the first to implement an avian radar system providing 24-hour monitoring of wildlife activity across the airfield. This pilot program, designed and implemented with the assistance of the University of Illinois Center of Excellence for Airport Technology (CEAT), was intended to decrease potentially fatal incidents involving collisions with birds and to provide a test bed for the implementation of the technology in the US, which was expected to begin in 2009. The technology is part of a strategy to reduce the presence of wildlife on the airfield.

===Other facilities===

The Seattle office of the National Weather Service operates a weather station at the airport, with a temperature gauge between the center and eastern runways. The airport has served as Seattle&#x27;s official weather recording location since 1945.

, Sea-Tac has over 23,000 total workers, including 400 to 500 customs agents and 850 TSA security officers. The airport has 3,800 cameras that are monitored from a control center staffed by Port of Seattle Airport Operations personnel. A separate control center monitors the baggage handling system at Sea-Tac, which includes of conveyor belts and handled 14.5 million pieces in 2022. Sea-Tac is the first major airport in the U.S. to use filters to remove per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances from its firefighting foam, which had sickened firefighters and workers.

==Ground transportation==
The airport site was chosen partly due to its location along State Route 99, approximately midway between Seattle and Tacoma. Interstate 5 and Interstate 405 also converge near the airport, with an easy connection to the airport via State Route 518 and the Airport Expressway. State Route 509 runs west of the airport, connecting the area to West Seattle. The airport is the largest generator of vehicle trips in the state.

The Port of Seattle offers paid on-site parking in a 12,100-space garage, notable for being North America&#x27;s largest parking structure under one roof. The airport also offers valet parking and electric vehicle charging stations. Several privately owned parking facilities are located off-site near the airport with shuttle access.

The airport is served by the 1 Line of Sound Transit&#x27;s Link light rail system at the SeaTac/Airport station with frequent service to downtown Seattle and the University of Washington. The station opened on December 19, 2009, and is connected to the airport terminal via a pedestrian bridge to the airport parking garage. Another pedestrian bridge over International Boulevard is used to access the city of SeaTac, nearby airport hotels, and King County Metro buses including RapidRide A Line. A 1.6-mile light rail extension south to Angle Lake station at South 200th Street opened on September 24, 2016.

The airport is also served both by the King County Metro bus system and Sound Transit regional express buses. Sound Transit buses offer service to West Seattle, White Center, Burien, Renton, Newcastle and Bellevue through Route 560. In contrast, Route 574 offers service to Lakewood via Des Moines, Federal Way, and Tacoma.

Tukwila Station, which is approximately 5 miles east of the airport, is served by Sounder commuter rail and Amtrak Cascades regional inter-city rail with service north to Vancouver, Canada, and service south to Portland and Eugene in Oregon. This station can be reached in about 30 minutes via the Central Link light rail or the RapidRide A Line bus service and transferring at Tukwila International Boulevard station to the RapidRide F Line bus service.

The airport serves door-to-door shuttle services (Shuttle Express and Speedi Shuttle) and several scheduled airporter bus services. Airporters include Bellair Charters to Yakima and Bellingham, and the Quick Shuttle to downtown Vancouver, Canada, through Quick Shuttle, with other pick-up stops at downtown Seattle, Bellingham International Airport, and drop-off stops just inside the Canadian–U.S. boundary and at the Vancouver International Airport.

Taxis, limousines, and transportation network companies (Lyft, Uber and Wingz) are also available. Prior to 2019, the Port of Seattle contracted out taxi services to an independent company, but changed to direct management with drivers due to protests over high access fees. , the airport has 409 taxi drivers who are part of the Teamsters Local 117 labor union.

A consolidated rental car facility opened on May 17, 2012. The facility is at the northeastern portion of the airport at the intersection of South 160th Street and International Boulevard South. The facility has 5,400 parking spaces and can handle up to 14,000 transactions per day. After the opening of the facility, 3,200 parking spaces in the central parking structure opened for general use. Passengers reach the facility on a five-minute trip aboard one of 29 low-floor Gillig CNG buses. Previously, only Alamo, Avis, Sixt, Budget, Hertz and National had cars on site. Advantage, Dollar, Enterprise, Thrifty, EZ Rent-A-Car and Fox Rent A Car ran shuttles to off-site locations. , Rent-a-Wreck was the last remaining company to not relocate to the consolidated facility and continue using their own shuttles.

==Accidents and incidents==
* November 30, 1947: Alaska Airlines Flight 9, a Douglas C-54A en route to Seattle from Anchorage, Alaska, caught fire after overshooting the runway upon landing in heavy fog and damp conditions following failed attempts at nearby Boeing Field and Paine Field in Everett. Shortly before 2:30 p.m. on Sunday, the plane touched down beyond the approach area to runway 20 and sped onto a nearby road, colliding with a car and bursting into flames. Nine fatalities resulted from the accident, including a blind woman riding in the automobile.
* April 2, 1956: Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 2, a Boeing 377 Stratocruiser headed to Portland International Airport in Portland, Oregon and points east, experienced reduced power and extreme buffeting shortly after takeoff from runway 20 due to an improper setting of the airplane&#x27;s cowl flaps by the flight engineer. Plans were initially made to land at McChord Air Force Base, but the pilot was forced to make a water landing in Puget Sound east of Maury Island. The plane sank within 15 minutes; five of the 38 on board died.
* November 24, 1971: Northwest Airlines Flight 305, a Boeing 727 flying to SEA Airport from Portland International Airport, was hijacked by a man calling himself &quot;Dan Cooper,&quot; later misidentified by the press as &quot;D. B. Cooper&quot;. Cooper released the passengers and attendants after landing in exchange for $200,000 and four parachutes, ordered the plane back into the air and jumped out over Southwest Washington with the money. To this day, neither Cooper nor most of the $200,000 have been found.
* December 26, 1974: Harbor Airlines Flight 308, a Britten Norman Islander bound for Oak Harbor crashed 0.6 miles (1 km) north of SEA Airport in snowy weather conditions into Riverton. Four of the six occupants on board (3 passengers, 1 crew) were killed. Unknown matter in the pitot tubes caused improper readings of the airspeed indicator.
* January 20, 1983: Northwest Airlines Flight 608, a Boeing 727 flying from SEA Airport to Portland, was hijacked. The man told a flight attendant that he had a bomb and demanded to be taken to Afghanistan. Federal agents stormed the plane after it landed in Portland for refueling. The hijacker was killed and the box he carried revealed no explosives.
* April 15, 1988: Horizon Air Flight 2658, a twin-engine de Havilland Canada Dash-8 departing for Spokane International Airport, experienced a power loss in the number two engine shortly after takeoff. While the crew lowered the gear for landing as they returned to the airport, a massive fire broke out in the right engine nacelle, resulting in a loss of braking and directional control. After touchdown, the aircraft veered off the runway and crossed the ramp, colliding with two jetways before coming to a stop against a third. The aircraft was destroyed by fire on impact. Four of the 37 passengers were seriously injured, but there were no fatalities.
* August 10, 2018: An empty Horizon Air Bombardier Q400 was stolen by a staff member and ultimately crashed on Ketron Island. Two US Air Force planes tried to force the plane to land.
* August 24, 2024: An apparent cyberattack caused airport officials to shut down a number of computer systems that handle the airport&#x27;s website, ticketing/check-in kiosks, baggage handling system, and arrival/departure boards, leading to significant delays. Some airline and airport staff had to resort to writing out boarding passes by hand and manually sorting baggage. The outages were mostly resolved with the website coming back online on November 22.
* February 5, 2025: A parked Boeing 737 operated by Delta Air Lines was struck by a taxiing Japan Airlines–operated Boeing 787 Dreamliner. Japan Airlines Flight 67 had landed at SEA and was taxiing before its right wing collided with the tail of another aircraft. The other aircraft, operating as Delta Air Lines Flight 1921, was waiting for deicing before takeoff to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Some flights were paused after the incident, but no injuries were reported and the airport stated that there was a &quot;minimal impact to airport operations.&quot;

<text>Daniel Gaston Ash (born 31 July 1957) is an English musician, songwriter and singer. He became prominent in the late 1970s as the guitarist for the goth rock band Bauhaus, which spawned two related bands led by Ash: Tones on Tail and Love and Rockets. Recently, he reunited with bandmate Kevin Haskins to form Poptone, a retrospective of their respective careers, featuring Kevin&#x27;s daughter Diva Dompe on bass. He has also recorded several solo albums. Several guitarists have listed Ash as an influence, including Dave Navarro of Jane&#x27;s Addiction, Kim Thayil of Soundgarden, Hide of X Japan and John Frusciante of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.

==Life and work==
After going to concerts in his teenage years, Ash decided to perform on a stage in some way. He started playing guitar around the age of 15, but confessed to having been very lazy and learning only three chords, and nothing more, for about three years. He began playing in cover bands, often together with future band mates David J and Kevin Haskins, whom he had known since nursery school. His first gig was in the Glasgow Rangers Workman&#x27;s Club.

Ash had become friends with Peter Murphy during his teenage years. Ash went to art school and Murphy went to work in a printing factory. They met up again five years later and Ash suggested forming a band. Rigging up a makeshift rehearsal space, Ash played an Echo 12 – bar blues, while Murphy sang a series of newspaper articles. Four weeks later, they formed Bauhaus and recorded &quot;Bela Lugosi&#x27;s Dead&quot;.

That song, released in 1979, became one of the most influential songs in gothic rock music, even though they saw themselves as a &quot;dark glam&quot; band and have always distanced themselves from the gothic label. From early on, he was intent on sounding original, and often tried to &quot;make the guitar not sound like a guitar&quot;. He worked to develop a guitar style that included other-worldly and atmospheric sounds. In an interview with John Robb, he said that he first bought an EBow in 1981. He typically has used a Telecaster guitar, HH amplifiers and Marshall 4x12 cabinets for his stage gear. Later in his career, he relied heavily on the Fernandes Sustainer system to achieve sounds similar to the EBow.

After nearly five years of recording and performing, Bauhaus broke up and Ash put together Tones on Tail with Bauhaus drummer Kevin Haskins. As Ash described them: &quot;We were a motley crew of individuals who essentially wanted to sound like a band from Venus or Mars!&quot; In 1984, Tones on Tail was disbanded; Ash founded Love and Rockets in 1985 with Haskins and David J, also of Bauhaus. In an interview in June 2009, Ash emphatically stated that he had no further plans to play with Love and Rockets.

Ash has stated that guitar solos do not interest him much, since they rely on a musician&#x27;s ego. He cares much more for the craft of songwriting and the overall production of a song rather than a focus on guitar or any other single instrument. During the last ten years, he has been experimenting more with electronic music, both with Love and Rockets and solo, limiting the use of guitar as an extra element to the songs. Since the last reformation of Bauhaus, however, he has been returning to a more guitar-based rock sound.

In 2008, Bauhaus released &quot;Go Away White&quot;, (their first studio album in 25 years) which was followed by a world tour.

Love and Rockets played at Coachella Music and Arts Festival and Lollapalooza in 2008.

In June 2009, Ash released a cover of the David Essex song &quot;Rock On&quot;, featuring singer Zak Ambrose on vocals. Recorded at the Swing House rehearsal and recording complex in Hollywood, the track is on the &quot;Swing House Sessions Vol 1&quot; EP. Later in 2009, Ash released a four-song EP exclusively through iTunes, entitled &quot;It&#x27;s A Burn Out&quot;.

In March 2017, Daniel Ash, Kevin Haskins and Haskin&#x27;s daughter Diva Dompé announced Poptone and a US tour, featuring songs by Tones on Tail, Love and Rockets and Bauhaus.
In 2020, during the Covid pandemic, Ash created a new band, Ashes and Diamonds, comprising Paul Denman on bass, formerly of Sade, and Bruce Smith the former drummer with The Pop Group, Rip Rig + Panic and Public Image Ltd. An album was recorded but has yet to be released due to conflicting schedules between the members. 

Ash joined Jane&#x27;s Addiction on stage at Madison Square Garden in 2022 to perform Jane&#x27;s Addiction&#x27;s &quot;Jane Says&quot; and &quot;Slice of Life&quot; by Bauhaus.

Love and Rockets reunited in 2023 for a short reunion tour of the United States between May and June 2023, making their first performance since 2008 at Pasadena&#x27;s annual Cruel World Festival at the Rose Bowl.

Ash reunited with Kevin Haskins and Diva Dompe under the Tones on Tail moniker at Cruel World in May 2024.

<doc id="264281" wikidata="Q1983417" url="?curid=264281" title="Newberry National Volcanic Monument">
<text>Newberry National Volcanic Monument was designated on November 5, 1990, to protect the area around the Newberry Volcano in the U.S. state of Oregon. The monument was created within the boundaries of the Deschutes National Forest, which is managed by the U.S. Forest Service, and includes of lakes, lava flows, and geologic features in central Oregon.

From 1964 to 1966, the volcano was used for training Apollo astronauts.

==Description==
Newberry National Volcanic Monument consists of four primary visitor destinations: Lava Butte, Lava River Cave, Lava Cast Forest, and Newberry Caldera.

The highest point within the monument is the summit of Paulina Peak at , with views of the Oregon Cascades and the high desert. Paulina Peak may be accessed by road during the summer months, and as the road is both steep and rough, with hairpin turns towards the summit, trailers or long vehicles are discouraged. The summit area of Newberry Volcano holds two alpine lakes full of trout, East Lake and Paulina Lake.

The Big Obsidian Flow, created 1,300 years ago, covers . The black, shiny obsidian field is easily accessible from good roads within the caldera, or a trail that traverses the flow.
Lava Cast Forest is roughly south of Bend, accessible via a gravel road from U.S. Highway 97. Lava Cast Forest contains a 6,000-year-old lava flow that created molds of ancient trees.

Lava Butte is roughly south of Bend, Oregon. Lava Butte is a cinder cone volcano that rises above the Lava Lands Visitor Center. It can be accessed by either vehicle or hiking up a paved road. Interpretive signs, views of the surrounding lava flow and mountains, and an active fire lookout are found on top.

Lava River Cave is roughly south of Bend. Lava River Cave is open to visitors from May through September. Lava River Cave is the largest uncollapsed lava tube in Oregon, and may be explored by lantern. Temperatures in the cave average . White-nose syndrome has not yet affected resident bats in the cave.

== Newberry Caldera ==

Newberry Caldera is roughly from Bend and from La Pine. Newberry Caldera is the largest developed area within the national monument. The caldera was formed when a magma chamber collapsed. Over time the caldera filled up with water that created two lakes, Paulina Lake and East Lake. Newberry Caldera has many natural tourism opportunities. Visitors have access to campgrounds, trails, water recreation, lodging, viewpoints, and interpretive guides with Forest Service staff. Newberry Caldera has medium use most of the year with some high usage during peak times of the year.

There are twelve trails within Newberry Caldera ranging from 0.25 miles to 21 miles. These trails offer a variety of uses from hiking only to multiuse with hiking, biking, and horse allowed. Along the trails you can find access to fishing, viewpoints, interpretive signs, picnic areas, and even hot springs. There are seven boat launches for water recreationists, (the lakes do restrict boats to 10 miles per hour). The Caldera also offers nine campgrounds accommodating both tent and RV camper. Newberry Caldera also offers a variety of winter activates such as snowmobiling, snowshoeing, cross country skiing, and rooms for rent at the resorts.&#x27;

<doc id="264285" wikidata="Q531178" url="?curid=264285" title="Daniel K. Inouye International Airport">
<text>Daniel K. Inouye International Airport , also known as Honolulu International Airport, is the main and largest airport in Hawaii. The airport is named after Honolulu native and Medal of Honor recipient Daniel Inouye, who represented Hawaii in the United States Senate from 1963 until his death in 2012. The airport is in the Honolulu census-designated place northwest of Honolulu&#x27;s central business district. The airport covers , more than 1% of Oahu&#x27;s land.

Daniel K. Inouye Airport offers nonstop flights to many places in North America, Asia, and Oceania. The airport serves as the main hub of Hawaiian Airlines and is also a base for Aloha Air Cargo. The airport is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a large-hub primary commercial service facility.

==History==
The airport opened on March 21, 1927, as John Rodgers Airport, after World War I naval officer John Rodgers. It was funded by the territorial legislature and the Chamber of Commerce, and was the first full airport in Hawaii; aircraft had previously been limited to small landing strips, fields, and seaplane docks. From 1939 to 1943, the adjacent Keehi Lagoon was dredged for use by seaplanes, and the dredged soil was moved to HNL to provide more space for conventional planes.

The U.S. military grounded all civil aircraft and took over all civil airports after the attack on Pearl Harbor, and Rodgers Field was designated Naval Air Station Honolulu. The Navy built a control tower and terminal building, and some commercial traffic was allowed during daylight hours. Rodgers Field was returned to the Territory of Hawaii in 1946. At the time, at , it was one of the largest airports in the United States, with four paved land runways and three seaplane runways.

John Rodgers Airport was renamed Honolulu Airport in 1947; &quot;International&quot; being added to the name in 1951. Being near the center of the Pacific Ocean it was a stop for many transpacific flights. By 1950, it was the third-busiest airport in the United States in terms of aircraft operations, and its runway was the world&#x27;s longest in 1953. In summer 1959, Qantas began the first jet service to Honolulu on its flights between Australia and California. Qantas introduced these jet flights with Boeing 707 aircraft operating a routing of Sydney – Fiji – Honolulu – San Francisco. Aeronautical engineer and airline consultant Frank Der Yuen advised in the design of the original building and founded its aerospace museum.

The original terminal building on the southeast side of runways 4 was replaced by the John Rodgers Terminal, which was dedicated on August 22, 1962, and opened on October 14, 1962. From 1970 through 1978, the architect Vladimir Ossipoff designed a terminal modernization project that remodeled this terminal and created several additions, which included the Diamond Head Concourse in 1970, the Ewa Concourse in 1972, and the Central Concourse in 1980.

Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) used Honolulu as a transpacific hub for many years, initially as a connecting point between the West Coast and Polynesia (Fiji, New Caledonia, and New Zealand) in 1946, followed by service to East Asia through Midway Island and Wake Island from 1947. By 1960, Pan American was serving the airport with Boeing 707 jets. Pan Am flight number 1, operating a 707, flew a westbound routing of San Francisco – Honolulu – Wake Island – Tokyo – Hong Kong and continuing on to New York City via stops in Asia and Europe. The airline also operated nonstop 707 service to Portland, Oregon (continuing to Seattle) and Los Angeles. Pan Am also had direct 707 flights from Honolulu to Calcutta, Guam, Jakarta, Karachi, Manila, Rangoon, Saigon, and Singapore in 1960. United Airlines was flying nonstop Douglas DC-6 &quot;Mainliner&quot; service from San Francisco in 1947 and by 1961 was operating Douglas DC-8 jet service nonstop from Los Angeles and San Francisco with direct one-stop DC-8 flights from both Chicago and New York City. British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines (BCPA) began serving the airport during the mid-1940s with Douglas DC-4 aircraft flying a routing of Sydney – Auckland – Fiji – Canton Island – Honolulu – San Francisco – Vancouver, B.C. In 1950, Northwest Airlines was operating nonstop flights from Seattle with Boeing 377 Stratocruiser propliners; by 1961, Northwest was flying daily Douglas DC-8 jet service on a round trip routing of New York City – Chicago – Seattle – Portland, OR – Honolulu. Also in 1950, Canadian Pacific Air Lines (which later became CP Air) was operating service between western Canada and Australia with a routing of Vancouver – Honolulu – Canton Island – Fiji – Sydney.

Honolulu-based air carriers Aloha Airlines and Hawaiian Airlines had both introduced jet service on their respective inter-island routes in Hawaii by 1966 with Aloha operating British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets and Hawaiian flying Douglas DC-9-10 jets with both airlines also continuing to operate turboprops on their island services at this time. According to their respective timetables, Aloha was flying Fairchild F-27 and Vickers Viscount propjets while Hawaiian was operating Convair 640 propjets in addition to their new jet aircraft in 1966. Both local air carriers would eventually operate service to the U.S. mainland as well as to the South Pacific while continuing to operate inter-island flights. In 1986, Hawaiian was operating nonstop Lockheed L-1011 Tristar service from Honolulu to Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Francisco, and Seattle as well as one-stop direct service to Portland, Oregon, and also nonstop Douglas DC-8 service to Pago Pago with this flight continuing on to Tonga. By 2003, Aloha was flying nonstop Boeing 737-700 service to Burbank, Oakland, Orange County, and Vancouver, B.C., with one-stop service to Las Vegas, Phoenix, Reno, and Sacramento in addition to operating nonstop flights to Kwajalein and Pago Pago with one-stop service to Majuro and Rarotonga.

In the spring of 1969, Braniff International introduced nonstop Boeing 707-320 service to Honolulu from Dallas Love Field, Houston Hobby Airport, and St. Louis, with one-stop service from Atlanta, Miami, and New Orleans. At the same time, United Airlines introduced daily nonstop Douglas DC-8-62 flights from New York City and was continuing to operate nonstop DC-8 service to Honolulu from Los Angeles and San Francisco. Also in 1969, Western Airlines was operating nonstop Boeing 707 and Boeing 720B service not only from several California cities but also from Anchorage, Denver, Minneapolis–St. Paul, and Phoenix. By 1981, Western was operating one-stop McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30 service from London Gatwick Airport via a polar route with a stop in Anchorage. By the mid-1970s Pan Am offered nonstop service from Honolulu to Japan, Guam, Australia, New Zealand, and Fiji, as well as to cities on the West Coast. Continental Airlines used Honolulu as a stopover point for charter service to Southeast Asia during the Vietnam War era, and to feed its Guam-based Air Micronesia operation. By the early 1970s, Continental was operating scheduled nonstop flights between Honolulu and Los Angeles, Portland, Oregon, and Seattle, including Boeing 747-100 nonstops from Los Angeles and one-stop 747 flights from Chicago. Air Micronesia had service to Guam via stops at Midway Island, Kwajalein, Majuro, Ponape, (now Pohnpei) and Truk (now Chuuk State) flying a Boeing 727-100. American Airlines also operated flights to Auckland, Sydney, Fiji and Pago Pago via Honolulu during the early 1970s in addition to operating nonstop Boeing 707-320 flights from St. Louis.

Over the years, many foreign air carriers used Honolulu as a transpacific stopover point, including Air New Zealand, BOAC (now British Airways), British Commonwealth Pacific Airlines, Canadian Pacific Air Lines, China Airlines, Garuda Indonesia, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, Philippine Airlines, Qantas, Real Transportes Aereos (a Brazilian airline), and Singapore Airlines as well as French air carriers Union de Transports Aeriens (UTA) and its predecessor Transports Aeriens Intercontinentaux (TAI). BOAC served Honolulu as part of its around the world services during the 1960s and early 1970s, first with Bristol Britannia turboprop airliners and later with Boeing 707 and Vickers VC10 jets. Pan Am and Trans World Airlines (TWA) also served Honolulu as a stop on their respective around the world services during the early 1970s. In 1979, Braniff International was operating all of its flights from the airport with Boeing 747 aircraft with nonstops to Dallas–Fort Worth, Guam, and Los Angeles as well as one-stop service to Hong Kong and also one-stop service to Bogota in South America. Several small airlines based in the South Pacific also served Honolulu. In 1983, Air Nauru was operating Boeing 737-200 nonstop flights from Majuro with direct service from Nauru, Air Niugini was flying Boeing 707 aircraft nonstop from Port Moresby, Papua New Guinea and Air Tungaru was operating Boeing 727-100 aircraft nonstop from Christmas Island. Also in 1983, Honolulu-based South Pacific Island Airways was operating nonstop Boeing 707 service from Anchorage, Guam, Pago Pago and Papeete.

In April 1974, American Airlines, Braniff International, Continental Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Pan Am, TWA, United Airlines and Western Airlines were all operating nonstop services on domestic routes from the U.S. mainland while CP Air, a Canadian airline, was operating international nonstop service from Vancouver and on to the South Pacific during the mid-1970s. Just over 25 years later, in June 1999, U.S.-based air carriers operating domestic nonstop services from the mainland included American Airlines, American Trans Air, Continental, Delta Air Lines, Hawaiian Airlines, Northwest, TWA, and United, while Air Canada, Canadian Airlines International (the successor to CP Air), and Canada 3000 were operating nonstop services from Canada.

===Modernization and history since 2006===

After thirty years, Ossipoff&#x27;s &quot;forward-looking and flexible design&quot; for the Overseas Terminal had become quite dated. A 2007 retrospective book on Ossipoff&#x27;s architecture noted that his terminal design was &quot;facing the challenges of new standards of accessibility, comfort, and security&quot;, and was therefore likely to be altered or obliterated in the near future.

On March 24, 2006, Hawaii Governor Linda Lingle unveiled a $2.3 billion modernization program for Hawaii airports over a 12-year period, with $1.7 billion budgeted for Honolulu International Airport. The plan involves implementing short-term projects within the first five years to improve passenger service and increase security and operational efficiencies.

As part of the modernization, flight display monitors throughout the airport were upgraded, new food and beverage vendors were added, and a new parking garage across from the international arrival terminal was completed. An international arrivals corridor with moving sidewalks built atop the breezeway leading to the Ewa Concourse was completed in 2010.

In 2011, Hawaiian Airlines renovated the check-in lobby of the Interisland Terminal, replacing the traditional check-in counters with six circular check-in islands in the middle of the lobbies, which can be used for inter-island, mainland, and international flights. This renovation project was fully funded by Hawaiian Airlines and not a part of the modernization program.

By 2012, Hawaiian Airlines was re-establishing Honolulu International Airport as a connecting hub between the United States mainland and the Asia-Pacific region. That year, according to a Massachusetts Institute of Technology study, the airport had 24% fewer domestic departure flights than it did in 2007.

During the 2016 legislative session, the Hawaii state legislature passed a resolution requesting that the U.S. Department of Transportation rename Honolulu International Airport for the late U.S. senator and Medal of Honor recipient Daniel Inouye. The new name first appeared in Federal Aviation Administration documentation on April 27, 2017, and the airport was officially renamed in a ceremony at the airport on May 30, 2017.

On June 1, 2018, the Hawaii Department of Transportation started renumbering all gates and baggage claim carousels. Gates were renamed alphanumerically, baggage carousels were renumbered from alphanumerical to numerical, and the Interisland and Overseas terminals were redesignated Terminals 1 and 2 respectively. HDOT cited the expansion of existing terminals in the airport as a reason to renumber all gates and baggage carousels. The renumbering was the first done since 1993.

After years of delays, the state airports division broke ground on the Mauka Concourse in Terminal 1 on May 30, 2018, and completed construction on August 26, 2021. The first concourse expansion at HNL since 1995, the new concourse includes gates that can accommodate wide-body jets, thus reducing the need for Hawaiian Airlines passengers to walk between Terminals 1 and 2 for overseas arrivals and departures, and freeing up gate space for other airlines.

A new consolidated rental car facility (CONRAC) was built on the east side of Terminal 2 and was completed on December 1, 2021. The 1.8 million square foot five-story facility is a short walk from Terminal 2 baggage claim and is also served by a consolidated shuttle bus service.

In September 2024, the airport announced that travelers with a Hawaii drivers&#x27; license or identification card can now present a digital ID at TSA checkpoints at the airport, marking Hawaii as the 11th state to allow the use of digital IDs at security.

==Facilities==

The airport has four major runways, which it operates in conjunction with the adjacent Hickam Air Force Base. The principal runway designated 8R/26L, also known as the Reef Runway, was the world&#x27;s first major runway constructed entirely offshore. Completed in 1977, the Reef Runway was a designated alternate landing site for the Space Shuttle.

In addition to the four paved runways, Daniel K. Inouye International Airport has two designated offshore waterways designated 8W/26W and 4W/22W for use by seaplanes.

===Terminals===
Daniel K. Inouye International Airport has 60 gates (54 jet-way gates and 6 hard stands) in three terminals. Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 are connected post-security, however, passengers walking from Terminal 1 to Terminal 2 must pass through a USDA agricultural inspection station for carry-on luggage.

Terminal 1 (formerly known as the &quot;Interisland Terminal&quot;) opened in 1993 and has 25 gates. The $130 million 8-gate terminal was the largest construction project undertaken at that time by the State Airports Division and replaced an earlier terminal built in 1961. In 1995, a 5-gate extension to the terminal, which also featured a new post-security walkway to Terminal 2, opened.

On May 30, 2018, the state airports division broke ground on the Mauka Concourse after years of delays. This new concourse adds space for 11 narrow-body aircraft or six wide-body aircraft and also features a post-security walkway to the rest of Terminal 1 and a new six-lane TSA security checkpoint. The Mauka Concourse opened for passenger use on August 27, 2021.

Continuing the improvements to Terminal 1, Hawaiian Airlines spent $14 million on a new four-lane security checkpoint located at the makai end of the terminal. This new security checkpoint opened on February 18, 2023 and replaced the security checkpoint that was previously located in the center of the terminal.

Terminal 2 (formerly known as the &quot;Overseas Terminal&quot;) opened in 1962 and has 29 gates. Terminal 2 is the largest terminal at HNL and is the only terminal which can take international arrivals and departures. From 1970 through 1978, architect Vladimir Ossipoff designed a terminal modernization project that remodeled this terminal and created several additions, which included the Diamond Head Concourse in 1970, the Ewa Concourse in 1972, and the Central Concourse in 1980. Two 3-jetway gates to handle an Airbus A380 were added to the terminal in 2018; this was done to support All Nippon Airways&#x27;s A380 flights between Tokyo&#x27;s Narita Airport and Honolulu.

Terminal 3 opened in 2018 between the Delta and United Cargo facilities on the Diamond Head side of the airport. The terminal was originally a single-story facility located north of Terminal 1 adjacent to Nimitz Highway, but this older facility was closed on June 1, 2018, for demolition in order to make way for the Mauka Concourse expansion of Terminal 1. Originally a larger replacement commuter terminal was planned to be built on the Diamond Head side of the airport, but those plans were ultimately canceled. This was largely due to bankruptcy of three of the four airlines occupying the terminal and the higher-than-expected cost of the project.

===Ground transportation===
The airport is accessible from both Interstate H-1 at exit 16 and Nimitz Highway.

TheBus routes 20 and 303 stop on the departures level of the airport. Route 20 connects the airport to the Hālawa Skyline Station at Aloha Stadium, Downtown Honolulu, Ala Moana Center, and Waikiki. Hickam AFB is served by Route 303. Routes 40, 42, and 51 run on Nimitz Highway within walking distance of the airport.

Skyline, the light metro system serving the City and County of Honolulu, will service the airport via the Daniel K. Inouye International Airport station once Segment 2 opens in mid-2025.

The Wiki Wiki Shuttle, the airport&#x27;s free shuttle bus, provides service between the ticket lobbies of all three terminals, and between the concourses of Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 post-security.

A 1.8 million sq. ft., $377 million consolidated rental car facility (CONRAC) opened on December 1, 2021, consolidating all rental car companies into one shared facility of 4,500 parking spaces across five levels.

===Fixed-base operators===
A number of fixed-base operators are located along Lagoon Drive on the airport&#x27;s southeastern perimeter. While these focus on general aviation services, there are a few small passenger airline operations that operate from these facilities, rather than from the main terminal complex. Air tour flights typically depart from this area as well.

<doc id="264288" wikidata="Q189304" url="?curid=264288" title="Hacker Manifesto">
<text>The Conscience of a Hacker (also known as The Hacker Manifesto) is a short essay written on March 18, 1986 by Loyd Blankenship, a computer security hacker who went by the handle The Mentor, and belonged to the second-generation hacker group Legion of Doom.

It was written after the author&#x27;s arrest, and first published in the underground hacker ezine &quot;Phrack&quot;. It can be found on many websites, as well as on T-shirts and in films.

Considered a cornerstone of hacker culture, the &quot;Manifesto&quot; asserts that there is a point to hacking that supersedes selfish desires to exploit or harm other people, and that technology should be used to expand our horizons and try to keep the world free.

When asked about his motivation for writing the article, Blankenship said, I was going through hacking withdrawal, and Craig/Knight Lightning needed something for an upcoming issue of Phrack. I was reading &quot;The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress&quot; and was very taken with the idea of revolution. At a more prominent public event, when asked about his arrest and motivation for writing the article, Blankenship said, I was just in a computer I shouldn’t have been. And [had] a great deal of empathy for my friends around the nation that were also in the same situation. This was post-WarGames, the movie, so pretty much the only public perception of hackers at that time was ‘hey, we’re going to start a nuclear war, or play tic-tac-toe, one of the two,’ and so I decided I would try to write what I really felt was the essence of what we were doing and why we were doing it.

== In popular culture ==
The article is quoted several times in the 1995 movie &quot;Hackers&quot;, although in the movie it is being read from an issue of the hacker magazine &quot;2600&quot;, not the historically accurate &quot;Phrack&quot;.

The Mentor gave a reading of &quot;The Hacker Manifesto&quot; and offered additional insight at H2K2. It is also an item in the game &quot;Culpa Innata&quot;.

A poster of the Hacker Manifesto appears in the 2010 film &quot;The Social Network&quot; in the Harvard room of Mark Zuckerberg.

&quot;The Hacker Manifesto&quot; is mentioned in Edward Snowden&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Permanent Record&quot;.

Amplitude Problem&#x27;s 2019 album &quot;Crime of Curiosity&quot;, featuring The Mentor himself, YTCracker, Inverse Phase and Linux kernel maintainer King Fisher of TRIAD is dedicated to &quot;The Hacker Manifesto&quot;. Each song title is a phrase from the essay.

<doc id="264289" wikidata="Q1067803" url="?curid=264289" title="Christ Church Cathedral, Dublin">
<text>Christ Church Cathedral, more formally The Cathedral of the Holy Trinity (Irish: &quot;Ardeaglais Theampall Chríost&quot;), is the cathedral of the United Dioceses of Dublin and Glendalough and the cathedral of the ecclesiastical province of the United Provinces of Dublin and Cashel in the (Anglican) Church of Ireland. It is situated in Dublin, Ireland, and is the elder of the capital city&#x27;s two medieval cathedrals, the other being St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

The cathedral was founded in the early 11th century under the Viking king Sitric Silkenbeard. It was rebuilt in stone in the late 12th century under the Norman potentate Strongbow, and considerably enlarged in the early 13th century, using Somerset stones and craftsmen. A partial collapse in the 16th century left it in poor shape and the building was extensively renovated and rebuilt in the late 19th century, giving it the form it has today, including the tower, flying buttresses, and distinctive covered footbridge.

==Overview and history==
===Overview===

In law, and in fact, it has been the cathedral of only the Church of Ireland&#x27;s Archbishop of Dublin since the Irish Reformation. Though nominally claiming Christ Church as his cathedral, the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin uses St Mary&#x27;s in Marlborough Street in Dublin as his pro-cathedral (acting cathedral).

Christ Church Cathedral is located in the former heart of medieval Dublin, next to Wood Quay at the end of Lord Edward Street. However, a major dual carriageway building scheme around it separated it from the original medieval street pattern which once surrounded it, with its original architectural context (at the centre of a maze of small buildings and streets) lost due to road-building and the demolition of the older residential quarter at Wood Quay. As a result, the cathedral now appears dominant in isolation behind new civil offices along the quays, out of its original medieval context. The cathedral is used as the setting for filming from time to time.

===First cathedral ===
The cathedral was founded probably sometime after 1028 when King Sitric Silkenbeard, the Hiberno-Norse king of Dublin made a pilgrimage to Rome. The first bishop of this new Dublin diocese was Dúnán or Donat, and the diocese was at that time a small island of land surrounded by the much larger Diocese of Glendalough, and was for a time answerable to Canterbury rather than to the Irish Church hierarchy. The church was built on the high ground overlooking the Viking settlement at Wood Quay and Sitric gave the &quot;lands of Baldoyle, Raheny and Portrane for its maintenance.&quot; Of the four old Celtic Christian churches reputed to have existed around Dublin, only one, dedicated to St. Martin of Tours, lay within the walls of the Viking city, and so Christ Church was one of just two churches for the whole city.

The cathedral was originally staffed by secular clergy. The second Bishop of Dublin introduced the Benedictines. In 1163, Christ Church was converted to a priory of the Regular Order of Arrosian Canons (Reformed Augustinian Rule) by the second Archbishop of Dublin, later saint, Laurence O&#x27;Toole, who adhered to the rule himself; it was subsequently headed by an Augustinian prior, who ranked as the second ecclesiastical figure of the diocese, and not a dean, until re-establishment in 1541. This priory, the Priory of the Holy Trinity, became the wealthiest religious house in Ireland, holding over of property in County Dublin alone, most notable of which were the three home farms held at Grangegorman, Glasnevin and Clonken or Clonkene, now known as Deansgrange.

===Norman period===

Henry II attended the Christmas service at the cathedral in 1171. According to the cathedral guidebook, this was the first time Henry received Holy Communion following the murder of Thomas Becket by Henry&#x27;s knights in Canterbury in 1170.

In the 1180s, Strongbow and other Norman magnates helped to fund a complete rebuilding of Christ Church, initially a wooden building, in stone, comprising the construction of a choir, choir aisles and transepts, the crypt and chapels to St. Edmund and St. Mary and St. Lô.

A chapel to St Laurence O&#x27;Toole was added in the 13th century and much of the extant nave was built in the 1230s. Its design was inspired by the architecture of the English western school of Gothic, and its wrought stones – of a Somersetshire oolite from quarries in Dundry – were sculpted and laid by craftsmen from the same area.

In 1300 Richard de Ferings, Archbishop of Dublin arranged an agreement between the two cathedrals, the &quot;Pacis Compostio&quot;, which acknowledged both as cathedrals and made some provisions to accommodate their shared status (see below for more on this).

In the 1350s a major extension was undertaken by John de St Paul, Archbishop of Dublin, 1349–1362. By 1358, the nave of the cathedral was partly in use for secular purposes and a &quot;long quire&quot; was added, extending the old choir area by around 10 metres. St Paul also installed an organ. His works were destroyed by the major rebuilding project in the 1870s. He was buried under the high altar.

In 1480 the wealthy judge William Sutton bequeathed all his lands and silver to the cathedral.

The cathedral was the location of the purported coronation, in 1487, of Lambert Simnel, a boy pretender who sought unsuccessfully to depose Henry VII of England, as &quot;King Edward VI&quot;.

The choir school was founded in 1493.

===Reformation period===
As part the dissolution of the Irish monasteries, King Henry VIII by Royal Warrant of 12 December 1539 abolished the Priory of the Holy Trinity. The Prior and Canons of Holy Trinity were transformed into secular clergy, to be known as the Dean and Chapter of Christ Church. So, Robert Paynswick or Penswick, alias Castell, Prior, and Richard Ball, Sub-Prior, became Dean and Precentor respectively, whilst Walter White, Seneschal and Precentor, became Chancellor and Vicar-Choral, and John Moss, Sub-Precentor [Succentor] and Sacristan, Treasurer and Vicar-Choral of the new foundation. Thus the last Augustinian Prior (Robert Paynswick) became the first Dean of Christ Church, though the process of conversion actually continued in 1540 and 1542, finishing with a Chapter of eight clergy.

Henry VIII&#x27;s immediate successor, Edward VI of England, in 1547, provided funds for an increase in cathedral staffing and annual royal funding for the choir school.

King Edward VI formally suppressed St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral and, on 25 April 1547, its silver, jewels and ornaments were transferred to the dean and chapter of Christ Church. This episode ended with a late document of Queen Mary&#x27;s reign, a deed dated 27 April 1558, comprising a release or receipt by Thomas Leverous, dean, and the chapter of St Patrick&#x27;s, of the &quot;goods, chattels, musical instruments, etc.&quot; belonging to that cathedral and which had been in the possession of the dean and chapter of Christ Church.

Queen Mary I of England, and later James I of England, also increased Christ Church&#x27;s endowment. Meanwhile, in 1551, divine service was sung for the first time in Ireland in English instead of Latin. In 1560, the Bible was first read in English.

===Kingdom of Ireland===

The foundations of the nave, resting in peat, slipped in 1562, bringing down the south wall and the arched stone roof (the north wall, which visibly leans, survived, and largely dates back to 1230). Partial repairs were carried out but much of the debris was simply levelled and new flooring was built over it until 1871. In 1620 the English-born judge Luke Gernon observed that Christchurch was in a better state of repair than St. Patrick&#x27;s; he does not seem to have been overly impressed by either.

In the 17th century, both parliament and the law courts met in buildings erected alongside Christ Church. King James II himself presided over a state opening of parliament in that location. However, parliament and the law courts both moved elsewhere: the law courts to the newly built Four Courts on the riverfront, and Parliament to Chichester House in Hoggen Green, into the building which is now The Bank of Ireland, College Green.

Like nearby St Patrick&#x27;s, the building was in poor condition for much of the 19th century. After the building was declared unsafe and no longer fit for use, some limited works were carried out by Matthew Price (architect) between 1829 and 1831.

===19th and 20th centuries===

The cathedral and Synod Hall were extensively renovated and rebuilt from 1871 to 1878 by George Edmund Street, with the sponsorship of the whiskey distiller Henry Roe of Mount Anville. The renovations cost Roe in the region of £250,000. Wyse Jackson notes that Roe may have been trying to &quot;outdo&quot; Benjamin Lee Guinness the brewer, who some years earlier in 1864 had privately funded the restoration of nearby St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral.

The great 14th-century choir was demolished and a new eastern end was built over the original crypt. He built a new chapter house. The tower was rebuilt. The south nave arcade was rebuilt. The flying buttresses were added as a decorative feature. The north porch was removed. The baptistry was built in its place. Street built the adjacent Synod Hall, taking in the last remnant of St Michael and All Angels&#x27;s Church, including the bell tower. The synod house is linked to the cathedral by Street&#x27;s iconic covered footbridge. Roe spent over £230,000 at the time (over €26 million in 2006 terms). Further renovations were carried out, notably between 1980 and 1982.

==Role==
Christ Church is the centre of worship for the united dioceses and holds notable annual events such as the Citizenship Service. As the cathedral of the southern province of the Church of Ireland, it also hosts ordinations of priests and consecrations of bishops.

==Architecture==
===Impact of the restoration===

The extensive renovation in Victorian times preserved the seriously decayed structure from collapse, but it is now difficult to tell which parts of the interior are medieval and which parts are Victorian pastiche. Photographs of the exterior show the extent of the Victorian rebuilding: Archbishop de St Paul&#x27;s 14th-century cathedral, in particular, the &quot;long choir&quot;, was almost entirely destroyed. As a result, Christ Church is a mixture of surviving medieval and later church building.

===Stonework===
Patrick Wyse Jackson, curator of the Geological Museum in Trinity College, assessed the building in 1993 as part of his book &quot;The Building Stones of Dublin: A Walking Guide&quot; and made the following observations:
:&quot; &quot;The present cathedral, which is noted for its crypts, was begun in 1172 by the Normans, whose stonemasons used locally quarried Calp Limestone from Lucan, and an imported oolitic limestone from Dundry Hill near Bristol, which they used around the doors and windows. The remains of the chapter house of the original priory are situated on the southern side of the cathedral site. Here the various rock types may be examined at close quarters using a hand lens.&quot;&quot; 

A much wider array of stones were employed during the late-1800s restoration of the cathedral, as detailed by Wyse Jackson:
:&quot; &quot;The cathedral was restored (actually nearly rebuilt) by the architect George Street in 1878. He used Calp Limestone from Kimmage and Rathgar for the walls, and faced them with limestones from Ardbraccan, Co. Meath, and Sheephouse, near Drogheda, Co. Louth. These latter stones were also used for dressings and carvings. The cathedral was reslated with olive green slates from Eureka in America. However, these were replaced around twenty years ago (1973) with green Westmorland Slate. Examples of the American slates remain on the tower and south-west turret of the Synod Hall... Restored portions of the cathedral are easy to pick out. The blocks are usually ashlared and well pointed. The two most eastern windows on the south-facing aisle wall have replacement architraves, which differ in colour from the other windows of the wall. In 1982, some deteriorated stonework was replaced with limestone from Lecarrow, near Tullamore, Co. Offaly.&quot;&quot;

===Nave===
The cathedral contains the reputed tomb of Strongbow, a medieval Norman-Welsh peer and warlord who came to Ireland at the request of King Diarmuid MacMorrough and whose arrival marked the beginning of Anglo-Norman involvement in Ireland. According to the Christ Church Cathedral website, in 1562 the nave roof vaulting collapsed and Strongbow&#x27;s tomb was smashed; the current tomb is a contemporary replacement from Drogheda. As is well documented from a number of sources, the tomb of Strongbow was used as the venue for legal agreements from the 16th to the 18th centuries. Alongside the main tomb is a smaller figure with sloping shoulders, suggesting a female figure, but wearing chain mail, which may indicate that it was a child.

===Crypt===
Christ Church also contains the largest cathedral crypt (63.4m long) in Britain or Ireland, constructed in 1172–1173. Having been renovated in the early 2000s, it is now open for visitors.

The crypt contains various monuments and historical features, including:

* the oldest known secular carvings in Ireland, two carved statues that until the late 18th century stood outside the &quot;Tholsel&quot; (Dublin&#x27;s medieval city hall, which was demolished in 1806) 
* a tabernacle and set of candlesticks which were used when the cathedral last operated (for a very short time) under the &quot;Roman rite&quot;, when the Roman Catholic king, James II, having fled England in 1690, came to Ireland to fight for his throne and attended High Mass in the temporary restoration of Christ Church as a Roman Catholic cathedral.
* the stocks, formerly in Christ Church Place, made in 1670 and used for the punishment of offenders before the Court of the Dean&#x27;s Liberty (the small area under the cathedral&#x27;s exclusive civic authority), moved here in 1870
* historic books and altar goods of the Cathedral
* &quot;The Cat &amp; The Rat&quot; are displayed with an explanatory note.

===Chapter house===
Behind the altar area, there is the chapter house, which contains cathedral offices, meeting rooms and other facilities.

===Synod hall and bridge===
At the west end of the cathedral is a fully integrated stone bridge, leading to the former synod hall, which was built on the site of St Michael&#x27;s, a prebendal church of Christ Church which was demolished by Street during his restoration of the cathedral. This hall, which incorporates the old St Michael&#x27;s tower, was formerly used for hosting general synods and diocesan synods for Dublin, Glendalough and Kildare. It is now home to the &quot;Dublinia&quot; exhibition about medieval Dublin.

== Status ==
=== Two cathedral issue ===
For most of their common history, both Christ Church and St Patrick&#x27;s held the status of cathedral for the Dublin diocese, a rare arrangement which only ended following the move to disestablish the Church of Ireland. In early times, there was considerable conflict over status but under the six-point agreement of 1300, &quot;Pacis Compositio&quot;, still extant, and in force until 1870:

* The consecration and enthronement of the Archbishop of Dublin was to take place at Christ Church – records show that this provision was not always followed, with many archbishops enthroned in both and at least two in St Patrick&#x27;s only
* Christ Church had formal precedence, as the mother and senior cathedral of the diocese
* Christ Church was to retain the cross, mitre and ring of each deceased Archbishop of Dublin
* Deceased Archbishops of Dublin were to be buried alternately in each of the two cathedrals unless they personally willed otherwise
* The annual consecration of chrism oil for the diocese was to take place at Christ Church
* The two cathedrals were to act as one and shared equally in their freedoms

The 1868 Church Commissioners&#x27; report proposed making St Patrick&#x27;s the sole cathedral and reducing Christ Church to a parish church.

=== Roman Catholicism ===
To this day, the acting seat of the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Dublin, St Mary&#x27;s, is known as a &quot;pro-cathedral&quot; in acknowledgement of the fact that the Holy See claims Christ Church as the rightful seat of the Roman Catholic archbishop.

== Governance and staffing ==

=== Dean and chapter ===

The dean and chapter, with the consent of the Archbishop of Dublin, preside over the cathedral, with the dean as &quot;first among equals&quot; in the chapter but holding a day-to-day authority, subject to the special roles of some other figures (the dean and chapter together are in a similar position to a rector of a parish).

The chapter comprises the dean, precentor (who must be skilled in music), chancellor, treasurer, Archdeacons of Dublin and Glendalough and 12 canons, eight being clergy of the Diocese of Dublin and four clergy of the Diocese of Glendalough (the three most senior in order of appointment are known as the Prebendary of St Michael&#x27;s, Prebendary of St Michan&#x27;s and the Prebendary of St John&#x27;s).

The dean is appointed by the Archbishop of Dublin and, in an arrangement commenced in 1971, is also incumbent of the Christ Church Cathedral Group of Parishes, the day-to-day care of which is in the hands of a vicar appointed by a special board of patronage.

The dean can appoint a deputy and also appoints the cathedral verger. The dean and chapter together appoint the precentor, while the other members of the chapter are appointed by the archbishop.

=== Board ===
Having been historically governed by its clerical chapter alone, since 1872 the cathedral has been operationally overseen by a board comprising nine clerical members (the dean, precentor, two clerical vicars and five other clerics) and nine lay members, elected every third annual Easter vestry. The board has the power to appoint and remove officers of the cathedral other than those whose appointment is vested in the archbishop, or the dean and chapter, or dean, to regulate salaries and to manage financial matters. The board is in a similar position to a select vestry of a parish.

The board has committees – mid-2007, these are administration and finance, culture (including the treasury), deanery, fabric, fundraising, health and safety, information technology, music, safeguarding trust and tower.

=== Other clergy ===
There is a dean&#x27;s vicar (and clerk of the chapter), a vicar of the Cathedral Group of Parishes and posts for a curate assistant and a student reader. There are also usually honorary clerical vicars.

== Music ==
Christ Church has a long musical history, with a well-known cathedral choir and a girls&#x27; choir. Along with the precentor, the musical side of its work is led by the &quot;Organist and Director of Music&quot;, working with any assistant organist and organ scholar, as well as the &quot;Honorary Keeper of the Music and Music Librarian&quot; and, , a &quot;Music Development Officer&quot;.

== Bells ==

Christ Church Cathedral probably had at least one ringing bell from its foundation. By 1440 there were known to be three great bells in the tower; however, on 11 March 1597, an accidental gunpowder explosion on one of the nearby quays damaged the tower and caused the bells to crack. The effects of this blast also damaged the tower nearby of St. Audoen&#x27;s Church.

In 1670, six new bells were cast for the tower from cannon metal. These were recast and augmented to eight in 1738 by Abel Rudhall. In the 1840s, several of the bells were recast by John Murphy of Dublin. In the 1860s and 1870s, the bells were gradually recast and augmented to twelve by John J. Murphy, his son, with a tenor weight of 36 hundredweight in the key of B. The tenor was recast in 1979.

The most recent augmentation was in 1999 when an additional seven bells were added to the ring, giving a grand total of 20 bells – 19 swinging bells (the world&#x27;s highest number of change ringing bells) and one chiming bell, cast by the Rudhalls. Although this does not produce a diatonic scale of 19 notes, it does uniquely provide a choice of combinations: three different 12-bell peals (in the keys of B, C# and F#) as well as 14 and 16-bell peals. At the time of the augmentation, this was only the second 16 full circle bell peal in the world – St Martin-in-the-Bullring in Birmingham being the first – and is now one of three rings of 16, along with the Swan Bells in Perth, Western Australia.

They are regularly rung on tower tours and on Sunday for Sung Eucharist and Choral Evensong, with a ringing practice on Friday nights.

== Archives and publications ==
Christ Church has a range of historical archives and has arranged for a number of publications over the years, as well as maintaining a website since the 1990s. This work is overseen by, among others, the &quot;Honorary Keeper of the Archives&quot; and the honorary secretary of Christ Church Publications, Ltd.

== Access ==
As Christ Church receives no regular state support, while it welcomes all guests and has a chapel for those who simply wish to pray, there are fees for sightseeing, which can also be paid in combination with the purchase of a ticket for the neighbouring &quot;Dublinia&quot; exhibition. There is a gift shop with souvenirs, recordings of cathedral music groups and publications.

==Media usage==
In recent years, the cathedral has been used as a set for medieval dramas such as the CW&#x27;s drama &quot;Reign&quot; and &quot;The Tudors&quot;. A number of dresses and outfits worn by Maria Doyle Kennedy (playing Catherine of Aragon) and Jonathan Rhys Myers (King Henry VIII) are displayed within the cathedral crypt.

== Group of parishes ==
In 1971, the general synod, following prior discussions, created the &quot;Christ Church Cathedral Group of Parishes&quot;, uniting what were then four parishes with the cathedral, whose dean is their rector: St Andrew&#x27;s, St Werburgh&#x27;s, All Saints (Grangegorman) and St Michan&#x27;s, St Paul and St Mary. The parishes are overseen day-to-day by a vicar appointed by a special board of patronage.
