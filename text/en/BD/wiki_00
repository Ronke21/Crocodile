<text>Seawater, or sea water, is water from a sea or ocean. On average, seawater in the world&#x27;s oceans has a salinity of about 3.5% (35 g/L, 35 ppt, 600 mM). This means that every kilogram (roughly one liter by volume) of seawater has approximately of dissolved salts (predominantly sodium () and chloride () ions). The average density at the surface is 1.025 kg/L. Seawater is denser than both fresh water and pure water (density 1.0 kg/L at ) because the dissolved salts increase the mass by a larger proportion than the volume. The freezing point of seawater decreases as salt concentration increases. At typical salinity, it freezes at about . The coldest seawater still in the liquid state ever recorded was found in 2010, in a stream under an Antarctic glacier: the measured temperature was . 

Seawater pH is typically limited to a range between 7.5 and 8.4. However, there is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units.

==Properties==
===Salinity===

Although the vast majority of seawater has a salinity of between 31 and 38 g/kg, that is 3.1–3.8%, seawater is not uniformly saline throughout the world. Where mixing occurs with freshwater runoff from river mouths, near melting glaciers or vast amounts of precipitation (e.g. monsoon), seawater can be substantially less saline. The most saline open sea is the Red Sea, where high rates of evaporation, low precipitation and low river run-off, and confined circulation result in unusually salty water. The salinity in isolated bodies of water can be considerably greater still about ten times higher in the case of the Dead Sea. Historically, several salinity scales were used to approximate the absolute salinity of seawater. A popular scale was the &quot;Practical Salinity Scale&quot; where salinity was measured in &quot;practical salinity units (PSU)&quot;. The current standard for salinity is the &quot;Reference Salinity&quot; scale with the salinity expressed in units of &quot;g/kg&quot;.

===Density===
The density of surface seawater ranges from about 1020 to 1029 kg/m3, depending on the temperature and salinity. At a temperature of 25 °C, the salinity of 35 g/kg and 1 atm pressure, the density of seawater is 1023.6 kg/m3. Deep in the ocean, under high pressure, seawater can reach a density of 1050 kg/m3 or higher. The density of seawater also changes with salinity. Brines generated by seawater desalination plants can have salinities up to 120 g/kg. The density of typical seawater brine of 120 g/kg salinity at 25 °C and atmospheric pressure is 1088 kg/m3.

=== pH value ===
The pH value at the surface of oceans in pre-industrial time (before 1850) was around 8.2. Since then, it has been decreasing due to a human-caused process called ocean acidification that is related to carbon dioxide emissions: Between 1950 and 2020, the average pH of the ocean surface fell from approximately 8.15 to 8.05.

The pH value of seawater is naturally as low as 7.8 in deep ocean waters as a result of degradation of organic matter in these waters. It can be as high as 8.4 in surface waters in areas of high biological productivity. 

Measurement of pH is complicated by the chemical properties of seawater, and several distinct pH scales exist in chemical oceanography. There is no universally accepted reference pH-scale for seawater and the difference between measurements based on different reference scales may be up to 0.14 units. 

===Chemical composition===
Seawater contains more dissolved ions than all types of freshwater. However, the ratios of solutes differ dramatically. For instance, although seawater contains about 2.8 times more bicarbonate than river water, the percentage of bicarbonate in seawater as a ratio of &quot;all&quot; dissolved ions is far lower than in river water. Bicarbonate ions constitute 48% of river water solutes but only 0.14% for seawater. Differences like these are due to the varying residence times of seawater solutes; sodium and chloride have very long residence times, while calcium (vital for carbonate formation) tends to precipitate much more quickly. The most abundant dissolved ions in seawater are sodium, chloride, magnesium, sulfate and calcium. Its osmolarity is about 1000 mOsm/L.

Small amounts of other substances are found, including amino acids at concentrations of up to 2 micrograms of nitrogen atoms per liter, which are thought to have played a key role in the origin of life.



===Microbial components===
Research in 1957 by the Scripps Institution of Oceanography sampled water in both pelagic and neritic locations in the Pacific Ocean. Direct microscopic counts and cultures were used, the direct counts in some cases showing up to 10 000 times that obtained from cultures. These differences were attributed to the occurrence of bacteria in aggregates, selective effects of the culture media, and the presence of inactive cells. A marked reduction in bacterial culture numbers was noted below the thermocline, but not by direct microscopic observation. Large numbers of spirilli-like forms were seen by microscope but not under cultivation. The disparity in numbers obtained by the two methods is well known in this and other fields. In the 1990s, improved techniques of detection and identification of microbes by probing just small snippets of DNA, enabled researchers taking part in the Census of Marine Life to identify thousands of previously unknown microbes usually present only in small numbers. This revealed a far greater diversity than previously suspected, so that a litre of seawater may hold more than 20,000 species. Mitchell Sogin from the Marine Biological Laboratory feels that &quot;the number of different kinds of bacteria in the oceans could eclipse five to 10 million.&quot;

Bacteria are found at all depths in the water column, as well as in the sediments, some being aerobic, others anaerobic. Most are free-swimming, but some exist as symbionts within other organisms – examples of these being bioluminescent bacteria. Cyanobacteria played an important role in the evolution of ocean processes, enabling the development of stromatolites and oxygen in the atmosphere.

Some bacteria interact with diatoms, and form a critical link in the cycling of silicon in the ocean. One anaerobic species, &quot;Thiomargarita namibiensis&quot;, plays an important part in the breakdown of hydrogen sulfide eruptions from diatomaceous sediments off the Namibian coast, and generated by high rates of phytoplankton growth in the Benguela Current upwelling zone, eventually falling to the seafloor.

Bacteria-like Archaea surprised marine microbiologists by their survival and thriving in extreme environments, such as the hydrothermal vents on the ocean floor. Alkalotolerant marine bacteria such as &quot;Pseudomonas&quot; and &quot;Vibrio&quot; spp. survive in a pH range of 7.3 to 10.6, while some species will grow only at pH 10 to 10.6. Archaea also exist in pelagic waters and may constitute as much as half the ocean&#x27;s biomass, clearly playing an important part in oceanic processes. In 2000 sediments from the ocean floor revealed a species of Archaea that breaks down methane, an important greenhouse gas and a major contributor to atmospheric warming. Some bacteria break down the rocks of the sea floor, influencing seawater chemistry. Oil spills, and runoff containing human sewage and chemical pollutants have a marked effect on microbial life in the vicinity, as well as harbouring pathogens and toxins affecting all forms of marine life. The protist dinoflagellates may at certain times undergo population explosions called blooms or red tides, often after human-caused pollution. The process may produce metabolites known as biotoxins, which move along the ocean food chain, tainting higher-order animal consumers.

&quot;Pandoravirus salinus&quot;, a species of very large virus, with a genome much larger than that of any other virus species, was discovered in 2013. Like the other very large viruses &quot;Mimivirus&quot; and &quot;Megavirus&quot;, &quot;Pandoravirus&quot; infects amoebas, but its genome, containing 1.9 to 2.5 megabases of DNA, is twice as large as that of &quot;Megavirus&quot;, and it differs greatly from the other large viruses in appearance and in genome structure.

In 2013 researchers from Aberdeen University announced that they were starting a hunt for undiscovered chemicals in organisms that have evolved in deep sea trenches, hoping to find &quot;the next generation&quot; of antibiotics, anticipating an &quot;antibiotic apocalypse&quot; with a dearth of new infection-fighting drugs. The EU-funded research will start in the Atacama Trench and then move on to search trenches off New Zealand and Antarctica.

The ocean has a long history of human waste disposal on the assumption that its vast size makes it capable of absorbing and diluting all noxious material.
While this may be true on a small scale, the large amounts of sewage routinely dumped has damaged many coastal ecosystems, and rendered them life-threatening. Pathogenic viruses and bacteria occur in such waters, such as &quot;Escherichia coli&quot;, &quot;Vibrio cholerae&quot; the cause of cholera, hepatitis A, hepatitis E and polio, along with protozoans causing giardiasis and cryptosporidiosis. These pathogens are routinely present in the ballast water of large vessels, and are widely spread when the ballast is discharged.

=== Other parameters ===
The speed of sound in seawater is about 1,500 m/s (whereas the speed of sound is usually around 330 m/s in air at roughly 101.3 kPa pressure, 1 atmosphere), and varies with water temperature, salinity, and pressure. The thermal conductivity of seawater is 0.6 W/mK at 25 °C and a salinity of 35 g/kg.
The thermal conductivity decreases with increasing salinity and increases with increasing temperature.

==Origin and history==
The water in the sea was thought to come from the Earth&#x27;s volcanoes, starting 4 billion years ago, released by degassing from molten rock. More recent work suggests much of the Earth&#x27;s water may come from comets.

Scientific theories behind the origins of sea salt started with Sir Edmond Halley in 1715, who proposed that salt and other minerals were carried into the sea by rivers after rainfall washed it out of the ground. Upon reaching the ocean, these salts concentrated as more salt arrived over time (see Hydrologic cycle). Halley noted that most lakes that do not have ocean outlets (such as the Dead Sea and the Caspian Sea, see endorheic basin), have high salt content. Halley termed this process &quot;continental weathering&quot;.

Halley&#x27;s theory was partly correct. In addition, sodium leached out of the ocean floor when the ocean formed. The presence of salt&#x27;s other dominant ion, chloride, results from outgassing of chloride (as hydrochloric acid) with other gases from Earth&#x27;s interior via volcanos and hydrothermal vents. The sodium and chloride ions subsequently became the most abundant constituents of sea salt.

Ocean salinity has been stable for billions of years, most likely as a consequence of a chemical/tectonic system which removes as much salt as is deposited; for instance, sodium and chloride sinks include evaporite deposits, pore-water burial, and reactions with seafloor basalts.

==Human impacts==

Climate change, rising levels of carbon dioxide in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, excess nutrients, and pollution in many forms are altering global oceanic geochemistry. Rates of change for some aspects greatly exceed those in the historical and recent geological record. Major trends include an increasing acidity, reduced subsurface oxygen in both near-shore and pelagic waters, rising coastal nitrogen levels, and widespread increases in mercury and persistent organic pollutants. Most of these perturbations are tied either directly or indirectly to human fossil fuel combustion, fertilizer, and industrial activity. Concentrations are projected to grow in coming decades, with negative impacts on ocean biota and other marine resources.

One of the most striking features of this is ocean acidification, resulting from increased CO2 uptake of the oceans related to higher atmospheric concentration of CO2 and higher temperatures, because it severely affects coral reefs, mollusks, echinoderms and crustaceans (see coral bleaching).

Seawater is a means of transportation throughout the world. Every day plenty of ships cross the ocean to deliver goods to various locations around the world. Seawater is a tool for countries to efficiently participate in international commercial trade and transportation, but each ship exhausts emissions that can harm marine life, air quality of coastal areas. Seawater transportation is one of the fastest growing human generated greenhouse gas emissions. The emissions released from ships pose significant risks to human health in nearing areas as the oil and gas released from the operation of merchant ships decreases the air quality and causes more pollution both in the seawater and surrounding areas.

Another human use of seawater that has been considered is the use of seawater for agricultural purposes. In areas with higher regions of sand dunes, such as Israel, the use of seawater for irrigation of plants would eliminate substantial costs associated with fresh water when it is not easily accessible. Although it is not typical to use salt water as a means to grow plants as the salt gathers and ruins the surrounding soil, it has been proven to be successful in sand and gravel soils. Large-scale desalination of seawater is another factor that would contribute to the success of agriculture farming in dry, desert environments. One of the most successful plants in salt water agriculture is the halophyte. The halophyte is a salt tolerant plant whose cells are resistant to the typically detrimental effects of salt in soil. The endodermis forces a higher level of salt filtration throughout the plant as it allows for the circulation of more water through the cells. The cultivation of halophytes irrigated with salt water were used to grow animal feed for livestock; however, the animals that were fed these plants consumed more water than those that did not. Although agriculture from use of saltwater is still not recognized and used on a large scale, initial research has shown that there could be an opportunity to provide more crops in regions where agricultural farming is not usually feasible.

==Human consumption==
Accidentally consuming small quantities of clean seawater is not harmful, especially if the seawater is taken along with a larger quantity of fresh water. However, drinking seawater to maintain hydration is counterproductive; more water must be excreted to eliminate the salt (via urine) than the amount of water obtained from the seawater itself. In normal circumstances, it would be considered ill-advised to consume large amounts of unfiltered seawater.

The renal system actively regulates the levels of sodium and chloride in the blood within a very narrow range around 9 g/L (0.9% by mass).

In most open waters concentrations vary somewhat around typical values of about 3.5%, far higher than the body can tolerate and most beyond what the kidney can process. A point frequently overlooked in claims that the kidney can excrete NaCl in Baltic concentrations of 2% (in arguments to the contrary) is that the gut cannot absorb water at such concentrations, so that there is no benefit in drinking such water. The salinity of Baltic surface water, however, is never 2%. It is 0.9% or less, and thus never higher than that of bodily fluids. Drinking seawater temporarily increases blood&#x27;s NaCl concentration. This signals the kidney to excrete sodium, but seawater&#x27;s sodium concentration is above the kidney&#x27;s maximum concentrating ability. Eventually the blood&#x27;s sodium concentration rises to toxic levels, removing water from cells and interfering with nerve conduction, ultimately producing fatal seizure and cardiac arrhythmia.

Survival manuals consistently advise against drinking seawater. A summary of 163 life raft voyages estimated the risk of death at 39% for those who drank seawater, compared to 3% for those who did not. The effect of seawater intake on rats confirmed the negative effects of drinking seawater when dehydrated.

The temptation to drink seawater was greatest for sailors who had expended their supply of fresh water and were unable to capture enough rainwater for drinking. This frustration was described famously by a line from Samuel Taylor Coleridge&#x27;s &quot;The Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot;:

Although humans cannot survive on seawater in place of normal drinking water, some people claim that up to two cups a day, mixed with fresh water in a 2:3 ratio, produces no ill effect. The French physician Alain Bombard survived an ocean crossing in a small Zodiak rubber boat using mainly raw fish meat, which contains about 40% water (like most living tissues), as well as small amounts of seawater and other provisions harvested from the ocean. His findings were challenged, but an alternative explanation could not be given. In his 1948 book &quot;The Kon-Tiki Expedition&quot;, Thor Heyerdahl reported drinking seawater mixed with fresh in a 2:3 ratio during the 1947 expedition. A few years later, another adventurer, William Willis, claimed to have drunk two cups of seawater and one cup of fresh per day for 70 days without ill effect when he lost part of his water supply.

During the 18th century, Richard Russell advocated the medical use of this practice in the UK, and René Quinton expanded the advocation of this practice to other countries, notably France, in the 20th century. Currently, it is widely practiced in Nicaragua and other countries, supposedly taking advantage of the latest medical discoveries.

===Purification===
Like any other type of raw or contaminated water, seawater can be evaporated or filtered to eliminate salt, germs, and other contaminants that would otherwise prevent it from being considered potable. Most oceangoing vessels desalinate potable water from seawater using processes such as vacuum distillation or multi-stage flash distillation in an evaporator, or, more recently, reverse osmosis. These energy-intensive processes were not usually available during the Age of Sail. Larger sailing warships with large crews, such as Nelson&#x27;s , were fitted with distilling apparatus in their galleys.
The natural sea salt obtained by evaporating seawater can also be collected and sold as table salt, typically sold separately owing to its unique mineral make-up compared to rock salt or other sources.

A number of regional cuisines across the world traditionally incorporate seawater directly as an ingredient, cooking other ingredients in a diluted solution of filtered seawater as a substitute for conventional dry seasonings. Proponents include world-renowned chefs Ferran Adrià and Quique Dacosta, whose home country of Spain has six different companies sourcing filtered seawater for culinary use. The water is marketed as , &quot;the perfect salt&quot;, containing less sodium with what is considered a superior taste. A restaurant run by Joaquín Baeza sources as much as 60,000 litres a month from supplier Mediterranea

Animals such as fish, whales, sea turtles, and seabirds, such as penguins and albatrosses, have adapted to living in a high-saline habitat. For example, sea turtles and saltwater crocodiles remove excess salt from their bodies through their tear ducts.

==Mineral extraction==
Minerals have been extracted from seawater since ancient times. Currently the four most concentrated metals – Na, Mg, Ca and K – are commercially extracted from seawater. During 2015 in the US 63% of magnesium production came from seawater and brines. Bromine is also produced from seawater in China and Japan. Lithium extraction from seawater was tried in the 1970s, but the tests were soon abandoned. The idea of extracting uranium from seawater has been considered at least from the 1960s, but only a few grams of uranium were extracted in Japan in the late 1990s. The main issue is not one of technological feasibility but that current prices on the uranium market for uranium from other sources are about three to five times lower than the lowest price achieved by seawater extraction. Similar issues hamper the use of reprocessed uranium and are often brought forth against nuclear reprocessing and the manufacturing of MOX fuel as economically unviable.

=== The future of mineral and element extractions ===
In order for seawater mineral and element extractions to take place while taking close consideration of sustainable practices, it is necessary for monitored management systems to be put in place. This requires management of ocean areas and their conditions, environmental planning, structured guidelines to ensure that extractions are controlled, regular assessments of the condition of the sea post-extraction, and constant monitoring. The use of technology, such as underwater drones, can facilitate sustainable extractions. The use of low-carbon infrastructure would also allow for more sustainable extraction processes while reducing the carbon footprint from mineral extractions.

Another practice that is being considered closely is the process of desalination in order to achieve a more sustainable water supply from seawater. Although desalination also comes with environmental concerns, such as costs and resources, researchers are working closely to determine more sustainable practices, such as creating more productive water plants that can deal with larger water supplies in areas where these plans weren&#x27;t always available. Although seawater extractions can benefit society greatly, it is crucial to consider the environmental impact and to ensure that all extractions are conducted in a way that acknowledges and considers the associated risks to the sustainability of seawater ecosystems.

== Standard ==
ASTM International has an international standard for artificial seawater: ASTM D1141-98 (Original Standard ASTM D1141-52). It is used in many research testing labs as a reproducible solution for seawater such as tests on corrosion, oil contamination, and detergency evaluation.

== Ecosystems ==
The minerals found in seawater can also play an important role in the ocean and its ecosystem&#x27;s food cycle. For example, the Southern Ocean contributes greatly to the environmental carbon cycle. Given that this body of water does not contain high levels of iron, the deficiency impacts the marine life living in its waters. As a result, this ocean is not able to produce as much phytoplankton which hinders the first source of the marine food chain. One of the main types of phytoplankton are diatoms which is the primary food source of Antarctic krill. As the cycle continues, various larger sea animals feed off of Antarctic krill, but since there is a shortage of iron from the initial phytoplankton/diatoms, then these larger species also lack iron. The larger sea animals include Baleen Whales such as the Blue Whale and Fin Whale. These whales not only rely on iron for a balance of minerals within their diet, but it also impacts the amount of iron that is regenerated back into the ocean. The whale&#x27;s excretions also contain the absorbed iron which would allow iron to be reinserted into the ocean’s ecosystem. Overall, one mineral deficiency such as iron in the Southern Ocean can spark a significant chain of disturbances within the marine ecosystems which demonstrates the important role that seawater plays in the food chain.

Upon further analysis of the dynamic relationship between diatoms, krill, and baleen whales, fecal samples of baleen whales were examined in Antarctic seawater. The findings included that iron concentrations were 10 million times higher than those found in Antarctic seawater, and krill was found consistently throughout their feces which is an indicator that krill is in whale diets. Antarctic krill had an average iron level of 174.3mg/kg dry weight, but the iron in the krill varied from 12 to 174 mg/kg dry weight. The average iron concentration of the muscular tissue of blue whales and fin whales was 173 mg/kg dry weight, which demonstrates that the large marine mammals are important to marine ecosystems such as they are to the Southern Ocean. In fact, to have more whales in the ocean could heighten the amount of iron in seawater through their excretions which would promote a better ecosystem.

Krill and baleen whales act as large iron reservoirs in seawater in the Southern Ocean. Krill can retain up to 24% of iron found on surface waters within its range.The process of krill feeding on diatoms releases iron into seawater, highlighting them as an important part of the ocean&#x27;s iron cycle. The advantageous relationship between krill and baleen whales increases the amount of iron that can be recycled and stored in seawater. A positive feedback loop is created, increasing the overall productivity of marine life in the Southern Ocean.

Organisms of all sizes play a significant role in the balance of marine ecosystems with both the largest and smallest inhabitants contributing equally to recycling nutrients in seawater. Prioritizing the recovery of whale populations because they boost the overall productivity in marine ecosystems as well as increasing iron levels in seawater would allow for a balanced and productive system for the ocean. However, a more in depth study is required to understand the benefits of whale feces as a fertilizer and to provide further insight in iron recycling in the Southern Ocean. Projects on the management of ecosystems and conservation are vital for advancing knowledge of marine ecology.

== Environmental impact and sustainability ==
Like any mineral extraction practices, there are environmental advantages and disadvantages. Cobalt and Lithium are two key metals that can be used for aiding with more environmentally friendly technologies above ground, such as powering batteries that energize electric vehicles or creating wind power. An environmentally friendly approach to mining that allows for more sustainability would be to extract these metals from the seafloor. Lithium mining from the seafloor at mass quantities could provide a substantial amount of renewable metals to promote more environmentally friendly practices in society to reduce humans&#x27; carbon footprint. Lithium mining from the seafloor could be successful, but its success would be dependent on more productive recycling practices above ground.

There are also risks that come with extracting from the seafloor. Many biodiverse species have long lifespans on the seafloor, which means that their reproduction takes more time. Similarly to fish harvesting from the seafloor, the extraction of minerals in large amounts, too quickly, without proper protocols, can result in a disruption of the underwater ecosystems. Contrarily, this would have the opposite effect and prevent mineral extractions from being a long-term sustainable practice, and would result in a shortage of required metals. Any seawater mineral extractions also risk disrupting the habitat of the underwater life that is dependent on the uninterrupted ecosystem within their environment as disturbances can have significant disturbances on animal communities.

<doc id="255245" wikidata="Q1149022" url="?curid=255245" title="Fubini's theorem">
<text>In mathematical analysis, Fubini&#x27;s theorem characterizes the conditions under which it is possible to compute a double integral by using an iterated integral. It was introduced by Guido Fubini in 1907. The theorem states that if a function is Lebesgue integrable on a rectangle formula_1, then one can evaluate the double integral as an iterated integral:formula_2 
This formula is generally not true for the Riemann integral, but it is true if the function is continuous on the rectangle. In multivariable calculus, this weaker result is sometimes also called Fubini&#x27;s theorem, although it was already known by Leonhard Euler.

Tonelli&#x27;s theorem, introduced by Leonida Tonelli in 1909, is similar but is applied to a non-negative measurable function rather than to an integrable function over its domain. The Fubini and Tonelli theorems are usually combined and form the Fubini-Tonelli theorem, which gives the conditions under which it is possible to switch the order of integration in an iterated integral.

A related theorem is often called Fubini&#x27;s theorem for infinite series, although it is due to Alfred Pringsheim. It states that if formula_3 is a double-indexed sequence of real numbers, and if formula_4 is absolutely convergent, then

: formula_5

Although Fubini&#x27;s theorem for infinite series is a special case of the more general Fubini&#x27;s theorem, it is not necessarily appropriate to characterize the former as being proven by the latter because the properties of measures needed to prove Fubini&#x27;s theorem proper, in particular subadditivity of measure, may be proven using Fubini&#x27;s theorem for infinite series.

==History==
A special case of Fubini&#x27;s theorem for continuous functions on the product of closed, bounded subsets of real vector spaces was known to Leonhard Euler in the 18th century. In 1904, Henri Lebesgue extended this result to bounded measurable functions on a product of intervals. Levi conjectured that the theorem could be extended to functions that are integrable rather than bounded and this was proven by Fubini in 1907. In 1909, Leonida Tonelli gave a variation of the Fubini theorem that applies to non-negative functions rather than integrable functions.

==Product measures==
If formula_6 and &quot;formula_7&quot; are measure spaces, there are several natural ways to define a product measure on the product formula_1.

In the sense of category theory, measurable sets in the product formula_1 of measure spaces are the elements of the σ-algebra generated by the products formula_10, where formula_11 is measurable in formula_6 and formula_13 is measurable in formula_7.

A measure &quot;μ&quot; on &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; is called a product measure if &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot;) = &quot;μ&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;)&quot;μ&quot;2(&quot;B&quot;) for measurable subsets &quot;A&quot; ⊂ &quot;X&quot; and &quot;B&quot; ⊂ &quot;Y&quot; and measures &quot;μ&quot;1 on &quot;X&quot; and &quot;μ&quot;2 on &quot;Y&quot;. In general, there may be many different product measures on &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot;. Fubini&#x27;s theorem and Tonelli&#x27;s theorem both require technical conditions to avoid this complication; the most common approach is to assume that all measure spaces are σ-finite, in which case there is a unique product measure on &quot;X&quot;×&quot;Y&quot;. There is always a unique maximal product measure on &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot;, where the measure of a measurable set is the inf of the measures of sets containing it that are countable unions of products of measurable sets. The maximal product measure can be constructed by applying Carathéodory&#x27;s extension theorem to the additive function μ such that &quot;μ&quot;(&quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot;) = &quot;μ&quot;1(&quot;A&quot;)&quot;μ&quot;2(&quot;B&quot;) on the ring of sets generated by products of measurable sets. (Carathéodory&#x27;s extension theorem gives a measure on a measure space that in general contains more measurable sets than the measure space &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot;, so strictly speaking, the measure should be restricted to the σ-algebra generated by the products &quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot; of measurable subsets of &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.)

The product of two complete measure spaces is not usually complete. For example, the product of the Lebesgue measure on the unit interval &quot;I&quot; with itself is not the Lebesgue measure on the square &quot;I&quot; × &quot;I&quot;. There is a variation of Fubini&#x27;s theorem for complete measures, which uses the completion of the product of measures rather than the uncompleted product.

==For integrable functions==
Suppose &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are σ-finite measure spaces and suppose that &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; is given the product measure (which is unique as &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are σ-finite). Fubini&#x27;s theorem states that if &quot;f&quot; is &quot;X&quot; × &quot;Y&quot; integrable, meaning that &quot;f&quot; is a measurable function and
formula_15
then
formula_16

The first two integrals are iterated integrals with respect to two measures, respectively, and the third is an integral with respect to the product measure. The partial integrals formula_17 and formula_18 need not be defined everywhere, but this does not matter as the points where they are not defined form a set of measure 0.

If the above integral of the absolute value is not finite, then the two iterated integrals may have different values. See below for an illustration of this possibility.

The condition that &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are σ-finite is usually harmless because almost all measure spaces for which one wishes to use Fubini&#x27;s theorem are σ-finite. 
Fubini&#x27;s theorem has some rather technical extensions to the case when &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are not assumed to be σ-finite . The main extra complication in this case is that there may be more than one product measure on &quot;X&quot;×&quot;Y&quot;. Fubini&#x27;s theorem continues to hold for the maximal product measure but can fail for other product measures. For example, there is a product measure and a non-negative measurable function &quot;f&quot; for which the double integral of |&quot;f&quot;| is zero but the two iterated integrals have different values; see the section on counterexamples below for an example of this. Tonelli&#x27;s theorem and the Fubini–Tonelli theorem (stated below) can fail on non σ-finite spaces, even for the maximal product measure.

==Tonelli&#x27;s theorem for non-negative measurable functions==
, named after Leonida Tonelli, is a successor of Fubini&#x27;s theorem. The conclusion of Tonelli&#x27;s theorem is identical to that of Fubini&#x27;s theorem, but the assumption that formula_19 has a finite integral is replaced by the assumption that formula_20 is a non-negative measurable function.

Tonelli&#x27;s theorem states that if formula_21 and formula_22 are σ-finite measure spaces, while formula_23 is non-negative measurable function, then
formula_16

A special case of Tonelli&#x27;s theorem is in the interchange of the summations, as in formula_25, where formula_26 are non-negative for all &quot;x&quot; and &quot;y&quot;. The crux of the theorem is that the interchange of order of summation holds even if the series diverges. In effect, the only way a change in order of summation can change the sum is when there exist some subsequences that diverge to formula_27 and others diverging to formula_28. With all elements non-negative, this does not happen in the stated example.

Without the condition that the measure spaces are σ-finite, all three of these integrals can have different values. Some authors give generalizations of Tonelli&#x27;s theorem to some measure spaces that are not σ-finite, but these generalizations often add conditions that immediately reduce the problem to the σ-finite case. For example, one could take the σ-algebra on &quot;A&quot; × &quot;B&quot; to be that generated by the product of subsets of finite measure, rather than that generated by all products of measurable subsets, though this has the undesirable consequence that the projections from the product to its factors &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; are not measurable. Another way is to add the condition that the support of &quot;f&quot; is contained in a countable union of products of sets of finite measures. gives some rather technical extensions of Tonelli&#x27;s theorem to some non σ-finite spaces. None of these generalizations have found any significant applications outside of abstract measure theory, largely because almost all measure spaces of practical interest are σ-finite.

==Fubini–Tonelli theorem==
Combining Fubini&#x27;s theorem with Tonelli&#x27;s theorem gives the Fubini–Tonelli theorem. Often just called Fubini&#x27;s theorem, it states that if formula_6 and formula_7 are σ-finite measure spaces, and if formula_20 is a measurable function, then
formula_32
Furthermore, if any one of these integrals is finite, then
formula_33

The absolute value of formula_20 in the conditions above can be replaced by either the positive or the negative part of formula_20; these forms include Tonelli&#x27;s theorem as a special case as the negative part of a non-negative function is zero and so has finite integral. Informally, all these conditions say that the double integral of formula_20 is well defined, though possibly infinite.

The advantage of the Fubini–Tonelli over Fubini&#x27;s theorem is that the repeated integrals of formula_19 may be easier to study than the double integral. As in Fubini&#x27;s theorem, the single integrals may fail to be defined on a measure 0 set.

==For complete measures==
The versions of Fubini&#x27;s and Tonelli&#x27;s theorems above do not apply to integration on the product of the real line formula_38 with itself with Lebesgue measure. The problem is that Lebesgue measure on formula_39 is not the product of Lebesgue measure on formula_38 with itself, but rather the completion of this: a product of two complete measure spaces formula_6 and formula_7 is not in general complete. For this reason, one sometimes uses versions of Fubini&#x27;s theorem for complete measures: roughly speaking, one replaces all measures with their completions. The various versions of Fubini&#x27;s theorem are similar to the versions above, with the following minor differences:
*Instead of taking a product formula_1 of two measure spaces, one takes the completion of the product.
*If formula_20 is measurable on the completion of formula_1 then its restrictions to vertical or horizontal lines may be non-measurable for a measure zero subset of lines, so one has to allow for the possibility that the vertical or horizontal integrals are undefined on a set of measure 0 because they involve integrating non-measurable functions. This makes little difference, because they can already be undefined due to the functions not being integrable. 
*One generally also assumes that the measures on formula_6 and formula_7 are complete, otherwise the two partial integrals along vertical or horizontal lines may be well-defined but not measurable. For example, if formula_20 is the characteristic function of a product of a measurable set and a non-measurable set contained in a measure 0 set then its single integral is well defined everywhere but non-measurable.

==Proofs==

Proofs of the Fubini and Tonelli theorems are necessarily somewhat technical, as they have to use a hypothesis related to σ-finiteness. Most proofs involve building up to the full theorems by proving them for increasingly complicated functions, with the steps as follows.
# Use the fact that the measure on the product is multiplicative for rectangles to prove the theorems for the characteristic functions of rectangles.
# Use the condition that the spaces are σ-finite (or some related condition) to prove the theorem for the characteristic functions of measurable sets. This also covers the case of simple measurable functions (measurable functions taking only a finite number of values).
# Use the condition that the functions are measurable to prove the theorems for positive measurable functions by approximating them by simple measurable functions. This proves Tonelli&#x27;s theorem.
# Use the condition that the functions are integrable to write them as the difference of two positive integrable functions and apply Tonelli&#x27;s theorem to each of these. This proves Fubini&#x27;s theorem.

===Riemann integrals===
For Riemann integrals, Fubini&#x27;s theorem is proven by refining the partitions along the x-axis and y-axis as to create a joint partition of the form formula_49, which is a partition over formula_1. This is used to show that the double integrals of either order are equal to the integral over formula_1.

==Counterexamples==

The following examples show how Fubini&#x27;s theorem and Tonelli&#x27;s theorem can fail if any of their hypotheses are omitted.

===Failure of Tonelli&#x27;s theorem for non σ-finite spaces===

Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is the unit interval with the Lebesgue measurable sets and Lebesgue measure, and &quot;Y&quot; is the unit interval with all the subsets measurable and the counting measure, so that &quot;Y&quot; is not σ-finite. If &quot;f&quot; is the characteristic function of the diagonal of &quot;X&quot;×&quot;Y&quot;, then integrating &quot;f&quot; along &quot;X&quot; gives the 0 function on &quot;Y&quot;, but integrating &quot;f&quot; along &quot;Y&quot; gives the function 1 on &quot;X&quot;. So, the two iterated integrals are different. This shows that Tonelli&#x27;s theorem can fail for spaces that are not σ-finite no matter which product measure is chosen. The measures are both decomposable, showing that Tonelli&#x27;s theorem fails for decomposable measures (which are slightly more general than σ-finite measures).

===Failure of Fubini&#x27;s theorem for non-maximal product measures===

Fubini&#x27;s theorem holds for spaces even if they are not assumed to be σ-finite provided one uses the maximal product measure. In the example above, for the maximal product measure, the diagonal has infinite measure so the double integral of |&quot;f&quot;| is infinite, and Fubini&#x27;s theorem holds vacuously.
However, if we give &quot;X&quot;×&quot;Y&quot; the product measure such that the measure of a set is the sum of the Lebesgue measures of its horizontal sections, then the double integral of |&quot;f&quot;| is zero, but the two iterated integrals still have different values. This gives an example of a product measure where Fubini&#x27;s theorem fails.

This gives an example of two different product measures on the same product of two measure spaces. For products of two σ-finite measure spaces, there is only one product measure.

===Failure of Tonelli&#x27;s theorem for non-measurable functions===

Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is the first uncountable ordinal, with the finite measure where the measurable sets are either countable (with measure 0) or the sets of countable complement (with measure 1). The (non-measurable) subset &quot;E&quot; of &quot;X&quot;×&quot;X&quot; given by pairs (&quot;x&quot; , &quot;y&quot;) with &quot;x&quot;&lt;&quot;y&quot; is countable on every horizontal line and has countable complement on every vertical line. If &quot;f&quot; is the characteristic function of &quot;E&quot; then the two iterated integrals of &quot;f&quot; are defined and have different values 1 and 0. The function &quot;f&quot; is not measurable. This shows that Tonelli&#x27;s theorem can fail for non-measurable functions.

===Failure of Fubini&#x27;s theorem for non-measurable functions===

A variation of the example above shows that Fubini&#x27;s theorem can fail for non-measurable functions even if |&quot;f&quot;| is integrable and both repeated integrals are well defined: if we take &quot;f&quot; to be 1 on &quot;E&quot; and –1 on the complement of &quot;E&quot;, then |&quot;f&quot;| is integrable on the product with integral 1, and both repeated integrals are well defined, but have different values 1 and –1.

Assuming the continuum hypothesis, one can identify &quot;X&quot; with the unit interval &quot;I&quot;, so there is a bounded non-negative function on &quot;I&quot;×&quot;I&quot; whose two iterated integrals (using Lebesgue measure) are both defined but unequal. This example was found by .
The stronger versions of Fubini&#x27;s theorem on a product of two unit intervals with Lebesgue measure, where the function is no longer assumed to be measurable but merely that the two iterated integrals are well defined and exist, are independent of the standard Zermelo–Fraenkel axioms of set theory. The continuum hypothesis and Martin&#x27;s axiom both imply that there exists a function on the unit square whose iterated integrals are not equal, while showed that it is consistent with ZFC that a strong Fubini-type theorem for [0,1] does hold, and whenever the two iterated integrals exist they are equal. See List of statements undecidable in ZFC.

===Failure of Fubini&#x27;s theorem for non-integrable functions===
Fubini&#x27;s theorem tells us that (for measurable functions on a product of σ-finite measure spaces) if the integral of the absolute value is finite, then the order of integration does not matter; if we integrate first with respect to &quot;x&quot; and then with respect to &quot;y&quot;, we get the same result as if we integrate first with respect to &quot;y&quot; and then with respect to &quot;x&quot;. The assumption that the integral of the absolute value is finite is &quot;Lebesgue integrability&quot;, and without it the two repeated integrals can have different values.

A simple example to show that the repeated integrals can be different in general is to take the two measure spaces to be the positive integers, and to take the function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) to be 1 if &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot;, −1 if &quot;x&quot; = &quot;y&quot; + 1, and 0 otherwise. Then the two repeated integrals have different values 0 and 1.

Another example is as follows for the function
formula_52
The iterated integrals

formula_53
and
formula_54
have different values. The corresponding double integral does not converge absolutely (in other words the integral of the absolute value is not finite):
formula_55

== Fubini&#x27;s theorem in multiplications of integrals ==

=== Product of two integrals ===

For the product of two integrals with lower limit zero and a common upper limit we have the following formula:

=== Proof ===

Let formula_56 and formula_57 are primitive functions of the functions formula_58 and formula_59 respectively, which pass through the origin:

:formula_60

Therefore, we have

formula_61

By the product rule, the derivative of the right-hand side is

formula_62

and by integrating we have:

formula_63

Thus, the equation from the beginning we get:

formula_64

Now, we introduce a second integration parameter formula_65 for the description of the antiderivatives formula_66 and formula_67:

: formula_68

: formula_69

By insertion, a double integral appears:

formula_70

Functions that are foreign to the concerned integration parameter can be imported into the inner function as a factor:

formula_71

In the next step, the sum rule is applied to the integrals:

formula_72

And finally, we use the Fubini theorem

formula_73

== Calculation examples ==
=== Arcsine integral ===

The arcsine integral, also called the inverse sine integral, is a function that cannot be represented by elementary functions. However, some of the values of the arcsine integral can be expressed with elementary functions. These values can be determined by integrating the derivative of the arcsine integral, which is the quotient of the arcsine divided by the identity function - the cardinalized arcsine. To integrate this function, Fubini&#x27;s theorem serves as a key, which unlocks the integral by exchanging the order of the integration parameters. When applied correctly, Fubini&#x27;s theorem leads directly to an antiderivative function that can be integrated in an elementary way, which is shown in cyan in the following equation chain:

formula_74
formula_75
formula_76

=== Dirichlet eta Function ===
The Dirichlet series defines the Dirichlet eta function as follows:

formula_77

The value η(2) is equal to π²/12 and this can be proven with Fubini&#x27;s theorem in this way:

formula_78

The integral of the product of the Reciprocal Function and the Natural Logarithm of the &quot;Successor Function&quot; is a Polylogarithmic Integral and it cannot be represented by elementary function expressions. Fubini&#x27;s theorem again unlocks this integral in a combinatorial way. This works by carrying out double integration on the basis of Fubini&#x27;s theorem used on an additive combination of fractionally rational functions with fractions of linear and square denominators:

formula_79

formula_80

formula_81

This way of working out the integral of the &quot;Cardinalized&quot; natural logarithm of the successor function was discovered by James Harper and it is described in his work &quot;Another simple proof of 1 + 1/2² + 1/3² + ... = π²/6&quot; accurately.

The original antiderivative, shown here in cyan, leads directly to the value of η(2):

: formula_82

=== Integrals of Complete Elliptic Integrals ===

The improper integral of the Complete Elliptic Integral of first kind K takes the value of twice the Catalan constant accurately. The antiderivative of that K-integral belongs to the so-called &quot;Elliptic Polylogarithms&quot;. The Catalan constant can only be obtained via the Arctangent Integral, which results from the application of Fubini&#x27;s theorem:

formula_83

formula_84

This time, the expression now in royal cyan color tone is not elementary, but it leads directly to the equally non-elementary value of the &quot;Catalan constant&quot; using the Arctangent Integral, also called Inverse Tangent Integral.

The same procedure also works for the &quot;Complete Elliptic Integral of the second kind&quot; E in the following way:

formula_85
formula_86

=== Double execution for the Exponential Integral Function ===
The Euler-Mascheroni constant emerges as the &quot;Improper Integral&quot; from zero to infinity at the integration on the product of negative Natural Logarithm and the Exponential reciprocal. But it is also the improper integral within the same limits on the &quot;Cardinalized Difference&quot; of the reciprocal of the Successor Function and the &quot;Exponential Reciprocal&quot;:

formula_87

The concord of these two integrals can be shown by successively executing the Fubini&#x27;s Theorem twice and by leading this double execution of that theorem over the identity to an integral of the complementary Exponential Integral Function:

This is how the complementary integral exponential function is defined:

: formula_88

This is the derivative of that function:

: formula_89

First implementation of Fubini&#x27;s theorem:

This integral from a construction of the integral exponential function leads to the integral from the negative Natural Logarithm and the Exponential Reciprocal:

formula_90
formula_91

Second implementation of Fubini&#x27;s theorem:

The previously described integral from the described cardinalized difference leads to the previously mentioned integral from the Exponential Integral function:

formula_92
formula_93

In principle, products from exponential functions and fractionally rational functions can be integrated like this:

formula_94
formula_95

In this way it is shown accurately by using the &quot;Fubini&#x27;s Theorem&quot; twice that these integrals are indeed identical to each other.

=== Gauss curve integral ===

Now this formula for the squaring of an integral is set up:

This chain of equations can then be generated accordingly:

formula_96

formula_97

For the integral of the Gauss curve this value can be generated:

: formula_98

=== Dilogarithm of one ===

Now another formula for the squaring of an integral is set up again:

So this chain of equations applies as a new example:

formula_99

formula_100

formula_101

For the Dilogarithm of one this value appears:

: formula_102

In this way the Basel problem can be solved.

=== Legendre&#x27;s relation ===

In this next example, the more generalized form of the equation is used again as a mold:

The following integrals can be computed by using the incomplete Elliptic Integrals of the first and second kind as antiderivatives and these integrals have values that can be represented with &quot;Complete Elliptic Integrals&quot;:

: formula_103

formula_104

: formula_105

formula_106

Inserting these two integrals into the above form gives:

formula_107

formula_108

formula_109

For the Lemniscatic special case of Legendre&#x27;s relation, this result emerges:

: formula_110

<text>Ingelheim (), officially Ingelheim am Rhein (), is a town in the Mainz-Bingen district in the Rhineland-Palatinate state of Germany. The town sprawls along the Rhine&#x27;s left bank. It has been Mainz-Bingen&#x27;s district seat since 1996.

From the later half of the 8th century, the Ingelheim Imperial Palace, which served emperors and kings as a lodging and a ruling seat until the 11th century, was to be found here.

== Etymology ==
The typically Rhenish-Hessian placename ending &quot;—heim&quot; might well go back to Frankish times, that is to say, likely as far back as the 5th or 6th century. Settlements or estates then took their lords’ names and were given this suffix, which means &quot;home&quot; in German. The name is recorded in later documents as &quot;Ingilinhaim&quot;, &quot;Ingilinheim&quot; (782), &quot;Ingilenhaim&quot;, &quot;Engelheim&quot;, &quot;Hengilonheim&quot;, &quot;Engilonheim&quot; (822), &quot;Engilinheim&quot; (826), &quot;Hingilinheim&quot; (855), &quot;Ingilunheim&quot; (874), &quot;Ingulinheim&quot; (889), &quot;Ingelesheim&quot; (891), &quot;Ingelenheim&quot; (940), &quot;Anglia sedes&quot; (1051), &quot;Ingilheim&quot; and &quot;Ingelnheim&quot; (1286), among other forms.

Since 1269, a distinction has been made between &quot;Nieder-Ingelheim&quot; and &quot;Ober-Ingelheim&quot; (Lower and Upper Ingelheim).

== Geography ==

=== Location ===
Ingelheim am Rhein lies in the north of Rhein Hessen on the so-called Rhein Knee, west of the state capital, Mainz. The Rhein forms the town&#x27;s northern limit. Southwards, the town stretches into the valley of the river Selz, which empties into the Rhein in the constituent community of Frei-Weinheim or Ingelheim-Nord (&quot;North&quot;).

The constituent communities of Ingelheim-Mitte and Ingelheim-Süd (&quot;Middle&quot; and &quot;South&quot;) are nestled against the corner of the so-called (&quot;Mainz Mountain&quot;).

The municipal area&#x27;s lowest point is the harbour on the Rhein at 80.8 m above sea level. The two highest points are the Mainzer Berg at 247.8 m above sea level and the at 247.5 m above sea level.

An obelisk on the south side of the village in direction Wackernheim, marks the road begun by Charlemagne, and completed by Napoleon. From this point a fine prospect of the entire Rheingau could be obtained.

=== Municipal area’s extent ===
The municipal area&#x27;s north-south extent is 7.9 km, while the east-west extent is 5 km.

=== Neighbouring municipalities ===
Clockwise from the north, these are Geisenheim, Oestrich-Winkel on the Rhine&#x27;s right bank, and on the left bank Budenheim, Finthen, the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Nieder-Olm, Schwabenheim, Gau-Algesheim (both belonging to the &quot;Verbandsgemeinde&quot; of Gau-Algesheim) and Bingen am Rhein. Since 1 July 2019 Wackernheim and Heidesheim are incorporated into the city of Ingelheim.

=== Constituent communities ===
Ingelheim is currently divided into six &quot;Stadtteile&quot;: Ingelheim-Mitte, Ingelheim-Nord, Ingelheim-Süd, Sporkenheim, Groß-Winternheim and Ingelheim-West. Before Ingelheim became a town in 1939, the first three centres bore the names Nieder-Ingelheim, Frei-Weinheim and Ober-Ingelheim. Official changes notwithstanding, the old names are still quite often used.

=== Climate ===
The town lies in the temperate zone. The average yearly temperature in Ingelheim is 9.8 °C. The warmest months are July and August with average temperatures of 18.0 and 18.5 °C respectively, and the coldest month is January at 1.0 °C on average. The most precipitation falls in June and August with an average of 64 mm, and the least in March with an average of 31 mm. Like all Rhenish Hesse, Ingelheim, too, is sheltered from the weather by the Hunsrück, the Taunus, the Odenwald and the Donnersberg, thereby limiting the yearly precipitation to only 560 mm.
== History ==
The Ingelheim area was already settled in prehistoric times. The place first earned itself particular importance, though, only under Charlemagne and his successors. Charlemagne had built the Ingelheim Imperial Palace (&quot;Ingelheimer Kaiserpfalz&quot;) here, where synods and Imperial diets were held in the time that followed. His son and successor, Emperor Louis the Pious, died on 20 June 840 in Ingelheim.

In the High and Late Middle Ages, the Palatinate&#x27;s, and thereby also Ingelheim&#x27;s, importance shrank.

For German justice history, the &quot;Ingelheimer Oberhof&quot; (&quot;Ingelheim Upper Court&quot;) is of particular importance, as a unique collection of judgments from the 15th and 16th centuries that it handed down has been preserved.

Late 19th century Ingelheim was the residence of the Dutch writer Multatuli (Eduard Douwes Dekker).

In 1939, the formerly self-administering municipalities of Nieder-Ingelheim, Ober-Ingelheim and Frei-Weinheim were merged into the Town of Ingelheim am Rhein.

From the Second World War, Ingelheim emerged as the only unscathed town between Mainz and Koblenz. Today, Ingelheim is a middle centre in Rhineland-Palatinate, a Great District-Bound Town (&quot;Große kreisangehörige Stadt&quot; – a status deriving from the Rhineland-Palatinate Municipal Order) and the seat of district administration for Mainz-Bingen.

Furthermore, Ingelheim harbours the business Boehringer Ingelheim which is active worldwide.

== Population data ==

=== Religion ===
In 2004, 36% of Ingelheim&#x27;s inhabitants belonged to the Lutheran faith, and 34% were Catholic, while 24% were without any religious faith; from 2% of the population, no data were forthcoming.

The six Catholic parishes belong, within the Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz to the Deanery of Bingen.

The five Protestant parishes of the EKHN belong to the Provostship (&quot;Propstei&quot;) of Mainz, and within this to the Deanery of Ingelheim.

Besides these, the Baptists, Religious humanists and Muslims each have small communities in Ingelheim, as do the Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and Buddhists.

Until 1942 there was a Jewish community, whose beginnings went back to the 16th century. About 1850, roughly 200 Jewish inhabitants lived in Ober-Ingelheim, and by 1933 there were still 134 all together in Oberingelheim and Niederingelheim. In 1840 and 1841, a synagogue that was important to architectural history was built. It was dedicated on 27 August 1841 and destroyed on 9 November 1938 – Kristallnacht. Many Jewish inhabitants lost their lives after being deported to the death camps during the time of the Third Reich.

=== Amalgamations ===
On 22 April 1972 the municipality of Groß-Winternheim was amalgamated. The former municipalities Heidesheim am Rhein and Wackernheim were merged into Ingelheim am Rhein on 1 July 2019.

=== Natural monuments ===

*Drifting chalk sands and dunes
In the cadastral areas of Nieder-Ingelheim and Frei-Weinheim, mainly north of the Autobahn along Konrad-Adenauer-Straße, but also south of the Autobahn – even within the Boehringer Ingelheim industrial lands – are found drifting chalk sands. Likewise a deposit is to be found in the area of the &quot;Griesmühle&quot; (mill).

These formations are under conservational protection under the Rhineland-Palatinate State Care Law. Damaging them or removing them, among other acts, is considered an incompensable encroachment on nature and the landscape. Municipal building uses in drifting chalk sand areas are therefore routinely excluded or only approved in very special cases. Two such exceptions were the building of Konrad-Adenauer-Straße (from the Autobahn bridge to Rheinstraße) and the building of the daycare centre on Sporkenheimer Straße.

<text>The Finns Party ( , PS; , Sannf), formerly known as the True Finns, is a right-wing populist political party in Finland. It was founded in 1995 following the dissolution of the Finnish Rural Party.

The party achieved its electoral breakthrough in the 2011 Finnish parliamentary election, when it won 19.1% of votes, becoming the third largest party in the Parliament of Finland. 

In the 2015 election the party got 17.7% of the votes, making it the parliament&#x27;s second-largest political party. The party was in opposition for the first 20 years of its existence. In 2015, it joined the coalition government formed by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä.

Following a 2017 split, over half of the party&#x27;s MPs left the parliamentary group and were subsequently expelled from their membership in the party. This defector group, Blue Reform, continued to support the government coalition, while the Finns Party went into opposition. The party, having been reduced to 17 seats after the split, increased its representation to 39 seats in the 2019 Finnish parliamentary election, while Blue Reform failed to win any seats.

During the 2023 Finnish parliamentary election, the Finns Party finished in second place with 46 seats, recording their strongest result since its founding. They then, out of Petteri Orpo&#x27;s request, proceeded to form a coalition government with the winning National Coalition Party, the Christian Democrats and Swedish People&#x27;s Party of Finland. The party currently holds seven of nineteen ministerial portfolios in the Orpo Cabinet.

==History==

===Finnish Rural Party===
The predecessor of the Finns Party was the Finnish Rural Party (SMP), founded by Agrarian League dissident Veikko Vennamo in 1959. Vennamo ran into serious disagreement with Arvo Korsimo, the Agrarian League&#x27;s party secretary, and was excluded from the parliamentary group. As a result, Vennamo immediately started building his own organization and founded the Finnish Rural Party. Vennamo was a populist and became a critic of President Urho Kekkonen and of political corruption within the &quot;old parties&quot;, particularly the Centre Party (the renamed Agrarian League). The Rural Party achieved two major victories in the elections of 1970 and 1983, winning 18 and 17 seats, respectively.

In the 1970s, Vennamo&#x27;s personalized leadership style alienated some in the party, which led to a split in the parliamentary group in 1972. After the Rural Party&#x27;s new rise in 1983 under Vennamo&#x27;s son Pekka, the party became a partner in two coalition governments. However, the party&#x27;s support declined steadily in the late-1980s and early-1990s. In 1995, the party won only one seat in the Finnish parliament and soon filed for bankruptcy.

===Founding of the Finns Party and its rise in popularity===
In the summer of 1995, following the collapse of the Finnish Rural Party, the decision to found the Finns Party was made by Timo Soini, Raimo Vistbacka, Urpo Leppänen and Kari Bärlund. Soini had been the Rural Party&#x27;s last party secretary and Vistbacka its last chair and MP. The party collected the five thousand signatures needed for registration and was added to the official party register on 13 October 1995. The first party congress was held in November. Vistbacka was elected party chair and Soini the party secretary.

It took some time before the Finns Party gained ground in Finnish elections. At the time of its founding in 1995, the party&#x27;s sole MP was Vistbacka, who was reelected in the 1999 election. In 2003, the party won three seats: besides Vistbacka, Soini and Tony Halme were elected. In the 2007, the party gained two further seats for a total of five. In the 2008 municipal election, the Finns Party were most successful in those districts where the Social Democrats and the Left Alliance lost most. In the 2011 election, the Centre Party suffered the largest blow from the Finns Party&#x27;s success.

According to a 2008–2009 study, Finns Party supporters viewed themselves as centrist: on a scale where 1 was extreme left and 10 was extreme right, the average supporter placed themselves at 5.4. According to the same study, the supporters were united by patriotism and social conservatism. A 2011 study indicated that the Finns Party was the most popular party among voters with an annual income of 35,000–50,000 euros, while over a quarter of the party&#x27;s voters earn over 50,000 per year. The same study also indicated that the party&#x27;s voters included a higher percentage of blue-collar workers than those of the Social Democrats.

====Timo Soini====

Timo Soini led the Finns Party for twenty years, from 1997 until 2017. He was first elected to the parliament in 2003. He was the party&#x27;s candidate in the 2006 presidential election, and was elected to the European Parliament in 2009 with the highest personal vote share in the country. He served as an MEP for two years, returning to the Finnish parliament in the 2011 election. Soini was the party&#x27;s presidential candidate for a second time in the election of 2012. Jussi Halla-aho succeeded Soini as party chair in 2017.

===2011–2017===
The Finns Party obtained 39 seats in the 2011 election, making them the third largest party, narrowly behind the National Coalition Party (44) and the Social Democrats (42). Soini received 43,212 personal votes, the highest number of all candidates, leaving behind the Foreign Minister Alexander Stubb and the Finance Minister Jyrki Katainen in their Uusimaa electoral district. The popularity of the party rose from 4.1% to 19.1% in just four years. &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; wrote in an editorial that the party and Soini had &quot;rewritten the electoral history books&quot;. According to political analyst Jan Sundberg, Soini had the ability to appeal to common people and make complicated things look easy. The election result was also referred to as &quot;shocking&quot; and &quot;exceptional&quot;.

After the election, the National Coalition Party (NCP) began negotiations aiming to form a cabinet between the NCP, the Social Democrats, and the Finns Party. However, when it became clear that the NCP and the Social Democrats would continue to support EU bailouts, which the Finns Party vehemently opposed during the electoral campaign, the party voluntarily broke from the negotiations to become the leading opposition party. Soini said that the party would not compromise its core principles just to enter the government. According to an opinion poll, most of the party&#x27;s supporters accepted this decision.

The Finns Party&#x27;s popularity initially continued to rise after the 2011 election: in one opinion poll from June 2011 gave the party a record popularity of 23 percent. The party&#x27;s membership rose to over 8,000 members by 2013 (up from circa 5,500 in 2011 and circa 1,000 in 2005). Membership in the party&#x27;s youth organisation rose as well, going from 800 before the 2011 election to over 2,200 in 2013.

The party nominated Soini as its candidate for the 2012 presidential election; Soini finished fourth with 9.4 percent. Soini interpreted the result by saying that half of the party&#x27;s voters wanted him for president, while the other half wanted to him to remain as party chair. In municipal elections later in 2012, the party got 12.3 percent of votes and 1,195 seats in the municipal councils, up more than 750 from the previous municipal election. However, this result saw the votes for the party shrink significantly from the 2011 parliamentary election result. The party got 12.9 percent of votes in the 2014 European Parliament election and increased its number of MEPs to two.

In the 2015 election, the Finns Party got 17.7% of the votes and 38 seats. This meant that they were the third largest party by votes but the second largest party by seats. The Finns Party subsequently entered into a coalition government with the Centre Party and the NCP, led by Prime Minister Juha Sipilä. The party&#x27;s participation in the Sipilä Cabinet marked a softening of its Eurosceptic positions. On 22 June 2016, Finns Party MP Maria Tolppanen joined the Social Democrats, after which the Finns Party had 37 seats in the parliament. In March 2017, Soini announced that he would step down as party chair in the next party congress in June.

=== 2017 leadership election and splits ===

In June 2017, Jussi Halla-aho and Sampo Terho faced off in the leadership election, in which Halla-aho received 949 votes against Terho&#x27;s 646 votes and thus succeeded Soini as party chair. Sipilä and Minister of Finance Petteri Orpo soon announced that they would not continue their coalition with the Finns Party if it was led by Halla-aho. Subsequently, twenty Finns Party MPs, including Soini and Terho, defected to form a new parliamentary group under the name New Alternative, later renamed to Blue Reform and after that, in 2022, into Finnish Reform Movement. As all cabinet ministers were among the defectors, the then Blue Reform made an agreement with Sipilä to stay in the government.

Following the split, MPs Veera Ruoho and Arja Juvonen left the Finns Party parliamentary group to continue as independents, after which the party&#x27;s seats were reduced to fifteen. All of the defecting MPs were subsequently expelled from the Finns Party. In the following weeks, MPs Ritva Elomaa and Arja Juvonen regretted their decision and re-joined the party, raising the amount of MPs to seventeen.

The party nominated MP Laura Huhtasaari as its candidate for the 2018 presidential election. In the election, Huhtasaari placed third with 6.9 percent of the votes, while the incumbent president Sauli Niinistö went on to secure his second term with a majority of votes.

=== 2019 general election and revival ===

At the 2019 Finnish parliamentary election, the Finns Party finished in second place and increased its number of MPs to 39 (with its strongest result being in Satakunta) while the breakaway Blue Reform party lost all of its seats.

On 21 June 2021, Jussi Halla-aho announced that he would retire from his position as a party leader in August 2021. He was succeeded by MP Riikka Purra on 14 August.

Since 2020, further minor splits have emerged within the party, forming the Power Belongs to the People party and Blue-and-Black Movement.

During the 2023 Finnish parliamentary election the party finished in second place ahead of the Social Democrats with 20% of the vote and 46 seats, marking the strongest result to date for the party.

In April 2023, National Coalition Party leader Petteri Orpo announced his attention to form a governing coalition with the Finns Party, Swedish People&#x27;s Party, and the Christian Democrats.

In the Orpo Cabinet, the Finns have seven ministers out of 19. Former party leader Jussi Halla-aho was elected Speaker of the Parliament of Finland.

===In the European Parliament===
When the Finns Party first gained representation in the European Parliament in 2009, it became a founding member of the Europe of Freedom and Democracy Group (EFD) in the Parliament. After the 2014 election, the party chose to leave the EFD to join the European Conservatives and Reformists Group (ECR). Commenting on the party&#x27;s choice of group, party secretary Riikka Slunga-Poutsalo said in 2014 that joining a right-wing parliamentary group would not change the party&#x27;s characteristic of being a &quot;centre-left workers&#x27; party&quot;. After the 2019 election, the party joined the Identity and Democracy Group; however, this decision was reverted after the 2023 parliamentary election, with the Finns Party rejoining the ECR after a four-year break.

==Ideology==
Ideologically, the Finns Party has been described as right-wing and far-right. It is a nationalist and national-conservative party that opposes immigration, while on foreign stances it is Eurosceptic. The party combines right-wing economic policies and economic nationalism with socially conservative values, and ethnic nationalism. Several scholars have described them as radically right-wing populist. In the parliament seating order, the party was seated in the centre of the plenary until 2019 when it was moved to the right of the plenary despite the party&#x27;s opposition to the move. Some of the party&#x27;s supporters have described themselves as centrists. The party has drawn people from left-wing parties but central aspects of their manifesto have gained support from right-wing voters as well. The Finns Party has been compared by international media to the other Nordic populist parties and other similar nationalist and right-wing populist movements in Europe. It also calls for austerity policies to curb deficit spending.

==Policies and platform==

In evaluating the Finns Party&#x27;s 70-page programme for the 2011 election, Mikko Lahtinen, political scientist in the University of Tampere, and Markku Hyrkkänen, historian of ideas in the University of Turku, note that nationalism is a theme consistently repeated throughout the programme. According to them, the party presents populism as a noble ideology, which seeks to empower the people. Lahtinen describes the rhetoric used in the program as a refreshing change to the politically correct &quot;jargon&quot; of mainstream media, and believes that the Finns Party may have succeeded in gaining supporters from the traditional left-wing parties by presenting a more attractive form of criticism of neoliberalism than those parties.

Ville Pernaa, political scientist, described the party&#x27;s 2015 electoral program by stating that the Finns combine elements of both right-wing and left-wing politics along with populist rhetoric.

===Economic policy ===

In the party&#x27;s 2011 programme, the Finns Party advocated a more progressive taxation system and support for the welfare state. The party opposed the establishment of a flat tax and called for the raising of the capital gains tax and the re-institution of the wealth tax. According to the party, the willingness to pay taxes is best guaranteed by a society unified by correct social policies – the electoral program warns against individualist policies, which weaken the solidarity among citizens. &quot;The willingness to pay taxes is guaranteed by having a unified people&quot;, the program reads (p. 46).

Some observers compared the Finns Party&#x27;s fiscal policies to the old national Social Democratic taxation policy, which has given the left-wing brand to the Finns Party. During the electoral campaign in 2011 Soini stated that he preferred the Social Democrats over the centre-right National Coalition Party as a possible coalition partner in a future cabinet. Soini has stated that the Finns are a &quot;workers&#x27; party without socialism&quot;. A researcher for the opinion polling company &quot;Taloustutkimus&quot; agreed, describing the Finns Party as a &quot;non-socialist workers&#x27; party&quot;.

The party&#x27;s programme on rural policy also called for state support for rural regions, particularly agriculture, suggesting state subsidies to relieve the effect of structural changes on the rural areas. This policy is shared by the Centre Party in Finland and originates from the agrarian and rural policies of both parties.

The Finns Party favours increasing state investments in infrastructure and industry as well. A tendency towards favouring old industrial policies have led some political analysts to label the Finns Party as a centre-left party.

=== Energy policy ===
The Finns Party aspires to energy self-reliance and supports nuclear energy. The party calls for a pro-industry environmental policy, opposing green tax reform and taxpayers&#x27; involvement in emission trading funds.

The party strongly supports the peat industry, which produces massive amounts of greenhouse gases, having even proposed exempting this production from any tax. The party generally scores best in municipalities whose economies are tied to this industry. The party has strongly denounced the Paris Agreement, signed in December 2015, saying it was &quot;catastrophic&quot; for the economy, and demanded that the private sector and taxpayers be spared its &quot;disastrous economic consequences&quot;.

=== Sociocultural policy ===
The Finns Party rejects the existence of nonbinary genders, and opposes same-sex marriage, same-sex adoption and in vitro fertilisation given to same-sex couples and single women.

The party supports teaching &quot;healthy national pride&quot; in schools, because the unity of citizens is the basis of society, and wants to promote support for cultural activities that &quot;promote Finnish identity&quot;.

The party also calls for the removal of the obligatory character of the second official language (Swedish in Finnish-language schools and vice versa) in curriculums on all levels of education, freeing up time for the learning of other foreign languages such as English, German, French, Spanish and Russian (especially in the eastern part of the country). Allowance regarding the use of the Swedish language and its teaching will have to be made for those communes where Swedish-speaking populations are in the majority or a large percentage of the population – Swedish is one of Finland&#x27;s national languages.

The cultural program of the Finns Party, which proposed subsidizing traditional art over postmodern art, prompted criticism from outside the party and generated debate within the party as well. Some critics of the policy called it overtly populist or said that the state should not interfere with the content of art. A poll commissioned by &quot;Helsingin Sanomat&quot; at the time of the controversy found that a majority of Finns, 51%, agreed with the party&#x27;s stance on ending subsidies for postmodern art.

=== Immigration policy ===
Regarding immigration policy, the party&#x27;s 2011 manifesto emphasises welcoming work-based immigration, provided the immigrants pay taxes and abide by Finnish labour laws; deporting immigrants guilty of serious or recurrent crimes or those that do not meet the Immigration laws; limiting family reunification to proven direct relatives only, and requiring means of subsistence from the immigrant; limiting humanitarian immigration strictly to refugee quotas (which should be adapted to correspond with the economic situation); and granting the Finnish nationality after five years of residence in Finland, provided the immigrant masters Finnish, has no criminal record, and has means of subsistence.

The party also requires that immigrants accept Finnish sociocultural norms. The only written declaration to the European Parliament made by a True Finns&#x27; MEP also concerns immigration matters. The party underlines the role of national sovereignty in immigration issues:
In 2015, the party&#x27;s immigration programme included demands like lowering the refugee quota, tightening the conditions of family unification, ending affirmative action, outlawing begging in public places, opposing the use of public funds to advance multiculturalism, opposition to the planned burden-sharing mechanisms of the Common European Asylum Policy, making sure that immigrants living on welfare benefits are not concentrated in the same areas and only allowing the immigration of workers from outside the EU and EEA if they are found to be necessary in a given field in a means test by the Finnish Labour Office.

In their 2019 election manifesto, the party called for a prohibition on wearing the burqa and the niqāb in public.

Timo Soini signed a pan-European charter against racism in 1998. However, in 2009, before the European Parliament election, Soini refused to sign an anti-racism appeal, saying that the appeal was an attempt to influence the party&#x27;s choice of candidates (the appeal was drawn up by another political party). All other Finnish parties signed this appeal against racism. In May 2011, following controversies surrounding the remarks of the Finns Party&#x27;s MP Teuvo Hakkarainen, the Finns Party&#x27;s parliamentary group issued a statement condemning all racism and discrimination, including affirmative action. The party invited other parties to sign the statement as well, but no other party did so. In December 2011, an opinion poll revealed 51% of Finns Party voters agreed with the statement, &quot;Joihinkin rotuihin kuuluvat ihmiset eivät kerta kaikkiaan sovi asumaan moderniin yhteiskuntaan;&quot; &quot;People of certain races are unable to live within (fit into) a modern society.&quot; 

===Foreign policy ===
The Finns Party is opposed to the integration of the European Union and to Finnish Eurozone membership. The party also calls for reductions in foreign aid.

The party believes in national sovereignty: 
==== European Union ====
Shortly after the leadership election of Jussi Halla-aho, the party hardened its position towards the European Union. In 2017, Laura Huhtasaari stated that she would support leaving the EU should she win the 2018 Finnish presidential election citing the growth of the Union&#x27;s power at the expense of the member states. Other party members have supported the idea of Finland withdrawing from both the Schengen Agreement and the Eurozone. In its latest platform, the Finns Party states that it supports a &quot;European policy&quot; based on appreciation for Western and Christian shaped values. The party argues that Finland is needed in the European Parliament to defend Finnish interests in the short-term, but states the &quot;long-term strategic goal&quot; is to take gradual steps to withdraw Finland from the European Union and proposes introducing a parallel currency within Finland to initiate phasing out Finnish membership of the Eurozone.

In 2023, Halla-aho reiterated that the party&#x27;s long-term goal is strategic preparation for a &quot;Fixit&quot; (Finnish exit) from the European Union and Eurozone, highlighting what he described as a &quot;democratic deficit&quot; within the EU while Foreign Trade Minister Ville Tavio stated the party will vote against joint-EU debt policies in government. However, the party leadership stated that it also wished to strengthen European unity and cooperation in the meantime in response to Russia&#x27;s invasion of Ukraine.

==== Defence ====
Timo Soini has been an outspoken critic of both the EU and NATO, but has stated that if a choice had to be made, NATO is a lesser evil than the EU. The Finns Party favors non-alliance or neutrality, as international activities abroad for the Defence Forces would undermine the defence budget&#x27;s funds for sustaining a large conscript army of war-time personnel (which is 350,000) to guarantee the defence of all of Finland. When the Finnish Parliament voted to ratify the Ottawa Treaty, banning anti-personnel mines, in November 2011, the Finns Party was the only party unified in opposing the treaty.

Initially, the party was opposed to Finnish admission into NATO in its 2011 program. However, following the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the party signaled a change to this policy and stated it was willing to back NATO membership.

=== Judicial policy ===
During the 2011 election, the party&#x27;s judicial programme included the opposition to any incorporation of Sharia law into Finnish judicial practices, giving more resources for police and prosecutors and imposing tougher punishments for violent crimes.

The fund borrowed 1.7 million euros from the party in 2012 to buy a 450 m2 commercial property in downtown Helsinki on Yrjönkatu for use as the Party&#x27;s new headquarters. The party rented these premises from the fund. Following the split of 2017, this foundation was left in the control the defector group, Blue Reform.

Another foundation, &quot;Suomen Perusta&quot; (&quot;The Foundation of Finland&quot;), was set up in 2012. Its role is to function as a think tank affiliated with the party.

==Controversies==

===2010s===

In 2011, Finns party MP James Hirvisaari was fined 1,425 euro by the Kouvola Court of Appeals for comments he made on his blog about Muslims. In 2011, President Tarja Halonen was quoted characterizing some Finns party voters as racist. Her comments were broadly condemned by the Finns party. A 2011 book by Swedish journalist Lisa Bjurwald made a similar characterization, that the party&#x27;s leaders support racist positions, while publicly denying that they do so.

In 2011, MP Pentti Oinonen declined an invitation to the presidential Independence Day ball, citing his aversion to seeing same-sex couples dance.

Jussi Halla-aho, the previous leader of the party, a former MEP and now the Speaker of the House wrote that Somalis were genetically predisposed to rob passersby, wrote that he would be happy if a gang of immigrants raped a Green League MP, and commented &quot;Violence is an underrated problem-solving tool these days,&quot; while pondering if he should shoot a gay man. A number of senior Finns Party politicians, including Halla-aho and Immonen, are also Suomen Sisu members, an organization that Länsiväylä describes as a Nazi group. The website of Suomen Sisu has promoted books by Nazis and neo-Nazis such as Alfred Rosenberg, George Lincoln Rockwell and David Duke.

In a judgement given on 8 June 2012, MP Jussi Halla-aho, then Chairperson of the Administration Committee was found guilty by the Supreme Court of both disturbing religious worship and ethnic agitation for statements he made about Muhammad in his blog.

In October 2013, it was reported that MP James Hirvisaari, had invited far-right activist Seppo Lehto as his guest to the parliament. During his visit, Lehto made several Nazi salutes, including at least one instance where Hirvisaari took a photo of Lehto performing the Nazi salute from the spectator gallery overlooking the Parliament House&#x27;s Session Hall. Photos and videos of Lehto performing the Nazi salute in the Parliament House were then distributed on Lehto&#x27;s public Facebook page and on YouTube. After newspapers broke news of the incident, Speaker of the Parliament Eero Heinäluoma issued a notice of censure to Hirvisaari for the incident and the Finns Party leadership unanimously decided to expel Hirvisaari from the party, citing multiple cases of acting against the party&#x27;s interest.

Hirvisaari then became affiliated with the Change 2011 party as the party&#x27;s MP, until he was unseated in the parliamentary election of 2015.

The party&#x27;s Ruovesi municipal chapter&#x27;s official postal address had Nazi flags hanging in the windows in 2019. The chapter chairperson denied that the flags were his.

===2020s===
In 2020, a number of members of the Finns party in parliament criticised the Research Council of Finland for funding the research on the Holocaust of historian and Green League candidate Oula Silvennoinen at the University of Helsinki.

Finns Party politicians have frequently supported anti-Muslim movements such as the Finnish Defense League, Soldiers of Odin, Nordic Resistance Movement (NRM), Rajat Kiinni (Close the Borders), and Suomi Ensin (Finland First). An anti-mosque demonstration was supported by the youth branch of the PS, whose chair, Jarmo Keto, said that, &quot;Islam as an ideology is responsible for many conflicts and terror attacks. Thus such a mosque project is an irresponsible idea&quot;.

Members of the Finns Party have attracted criticism from the other parties and antifascists for attending events organized by or with the NRM. Two municipal-level politicians of the Finns Party have taken part in an event where the participants shot and threw knives at shooting targets, using photos of members of the Rinne Cabinet.

The Finns&#x27; General Secretary, Olli Immonen, attended an NRM event commemorating Eugen Schauman, who assassinated Nikolay Bobrikov. Some members of the party have been fired from as a result of contacts with the far-right.

In 2020, the party sacked the youth wing&#x27;s vice leader Toni Jalonen for declaring himself a fascist at a conference in Estonia. The party additionally cut financial support to its youth wing, so it was declared bankrupt as a result. A new organization called &quot;Perussuomalainen nuoriso&quot; in Finnish was founded with new personnel to replace it.

NRM and other far-right activists attend an annual torch march demonstration in Helsinki on the Finnish independence day which ends at the Hietaniemi cemetery where members visit the tomb of Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim and the monument to the Finnish Volunteer Battalion of the Waffen-SS. According to B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&#x27;s report, &quot;The main organizers and guests of the event have been drawn from either non-party-affiliated far-right-activists or members of the right-wing populist Finns Party (Perussuomalaiset), its youth organization Finns Party Youth (Perussuomalaiset Nuoret)&quot;.

Finns Party MP Vilhelm Junnila spoke at an event organized in memory of victims of a terrorist attack in 2019. His participation in the event was criticised in the media due to the event being organized by the NRM and Soldiers of Odin. The matter was especially brought up in the media after the formation of the Orpo Cabinet in 2023, where he was appointed Minister of Economic Affairs. Junnila survived a vote of no-confidence, but announced his resignation from the cabinet afterwards. He was replaced by Wille Rydman, who gained attention for his multiple nazi-related controversies after his appointment.

Viljam Nyman, a Finns Party Lapland area board member became a leader of the Atomwaffen Division&#x27;s Finnish chapter and a prominent adherent to the satanic Order of Nine Angles (ONA). Nyman&#x27;s associate, a Finns party member born in 1980 and a fellow accelerationism and ONA adherent had dozens of his writings published by the official Finns party organ, Suomen Uutiset. Both were suspected of planning murders and terrorist attacks, and Nyman has been subsequently convicted of terror offenses.

The person born in 1980 is also suspected of sending a string of letter bombs to the Social Democratic, Green League and Left Alliance parties&#x27; offices.

A Finns Party Espoo city council member Jiri Keronen told that he &quot;avows&quot; the teachings of ONA and that he is republishing their works.

On 9 May 2024, the Finns Party council expelled Timo Vornanen alongside Teuvo Hakkarainen from the party, because of the police suspecting that Timo Vornanen pointed at a group of people with a gun and then shot the ground after an argument on the 26 April in the Kamppi subdivision of Helsinki, outside a bar. After the shooting incident, Vornanen has been on sick leave from the parliament.

He announced on May 14 that he&#x27;d give up his parliamentary committee seats to the rest of the Finns Party to decide on replacements. He also posted on Facebook that he would leave the Joensuu city council&#x27;s Finns Party council group and create his own city council and parliamentary groups.

Former MEP Teuvo Hakkarainen, on the other hand, was expelled from the party because he stood as a candidate for the European Parliament on the Freedom Alliance&#x27;s list. He claims that he did this because the Finns Party&#x27;s leadership had &quot;left the field&quot; and adopted a mentality of kicking people out if they even slightly questioned the party&#x27;s leadership or criticised their actions.

<text>Carpenteria , the tree anemone or bush anemone, is a genus of flowering plants in the hydrangea family Hydrangeaceae. It is closely related to the similar genus &quot;Philadelphus&quot; and is monotypic, being represented by the single species Carpenteria californica which is a flowering evergreen shrub native to the Sierra Nevada foothills in California.

== Eponym ==
The genus was named in honor of Dr. William Marbury Carpenter, a noted botanist from Louisiana.
==Description==
&quot;Carpenteria californica&quot; grows to tall, with flaky bark on older stems. The leaves are opposite, lanceolate, long and broad, glossy green above, blue-green to whitish and downy beneath.

The sweetly-scented flowers are across with five to eight pure white petals and a cluster of yellow stamens. It flowers from late spring to midsummer. The fruit is a leathery capsule in diameter, containing numerous seeds.

==Distribution and habitat==
The bush anemone is a rare species, endemic to only seven sites in Fresno and Madera Counties, where it grows in chaparral and oak woodlands at altitude, between the San Joaquin River and Kings River. It is well adapted to wildfire, reproducing by stump sprouts after burning. Natural seedlings are rare.

==Cultivation==
&quot;Carpenteria californica&quot; is cultivated as an ornamental plant, grown for its lush foliage, large scented flowers and drought tolerance. It is used in traditional and wildlife gardens in subtropical and temperate locations in the northern hemisphere. It is hardy down to in sheltered locations in full sun.

It has been in cultivation since 1875, and is now much more common in gardens than in its natural habitat. It first flowered in England for the famed plantswoman Gertrude Jekyll at Godalming in 1885.

Cultivars include:
*&#x27;Bodnant&#x27; — cold-tolerant cultivar, hardy to in the British Isles
*&#x27;Elizabeth&#x27; — masses of smaller white flowers, more compact growth habit
*&#x27;Ladham&#x27;s&#x27; — large flowers

The cultivars &#x27;Elizabeth&#x27; and &#x27;Bodnant&#x27; have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit.

<text>Tony Christian Halme (January 6, 1963 – January 8, 2010) was a Finnish politician, athlete, author, actor, and singer. He was a member of the Finnish Parliament from 2003 to 2007 as an independent elected on the True Finns party list. Halme was also known by the pseudonym &quot;Viikinki&quot;, which he used while appearing in &quot;Gladiaattorit&quot;, a Finnish version of the TV game show &quot;Gladiators&quot;, in the 1990s.

He was also a professional wrestler best known for his appearances with Catch Wrestling Association (CWA), New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW) and World Wrestling Federation (WWF) under the ring name Ludvig Borga; a mixed martial artist and the first fighter from the Nordic countries to ever compete in the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC); and a professional boxer who held the Finnish and the American heavyweight title.

During his time in CWA, he was an accomplished main eventer, who headlined many events for the company including the company&#x27;s flagship event Euro Catch Festival three times.

==Early life==
Tony Halme spent his childhood in Lauttasaari, Helsinki. His father left the family when Tony was six months old. His older brother – who was five years older than Tony – assumed the role of father figure. Halme only heard from his father a couple of times during his life. His mother was an alcoholic with a constant revolving door of male partners. As an adult, Halme considered his brother to be his only true friend. In the mid-1970s, Tony, his mother and brother moved to Soukka, Espoo. Halme attended &quot;&quot; and a &quot;oppikoulu&quot;. He later attended a Swedish-language school and studied at the electrician line at the Strömberg School of Engineering. However, he dropped out of the latter after two years. At the age of 16, Halme left his mother&#x27;s home and moved in with his uncle.

Athletic from a young age, he actively participated in sports such as handball, football and ice hockey. He also began power training and weightlifting in his late teens after watching his brothers, who were on the Finnish national team. Aged 17, he had won a silver medal at the Finnish Bodybuilding Championship. He also worked a wide variety of jobs, including fishmonger, gatekeeper, glass cutter, singer, page, stuntman, TV and radio presenter, and coach. He later enlisted in the Finnish army and continued his training with the Finnish military sports team. After leaving the army, he became involved in boxing and worked as a bouncer in bars.

Halme developed a fascination with the United States after seeing Martin Scorsese’s film &quot;Taxi Driver&quot; at the age of 12, Halme also had a dream to get to the Gold&#x27;s Gym and see it. He left Finland to live in Los Angeles in the 1980s and lived there for 15 years. He resumed bodybuilding in the US also and began to take anabolic steroids regularly. He worked as a bodyguard for the music group Cheap Trick and musician Gene Simmons, and also as an actor, professional wrestler and a boxer.

He made his debut for Herb Abrams&#x27;s Universal Wrestling Federation (UWF) on October 29, 1990 as The Viking. In his first match, he defeated The Patriot (wrestler)|, not to be confused with Del Wilkes, but a no name wrestler with a mask. He then went on to defeat Kevin Benjamin.

===New Japan Pro-Wrestling (1990–1993)===
On October 25, 1990, Halme made his debut for the Japanese promotion New Japan Pro-Wrestling (NJPW), defeating The Soul Taker in what was billed as a &quot;boxer vs. wrestler&quot; match. Halme was brought in as an outsider and billed as a professional boxing champion with his matches billed as Mixed martial arts matches. He was instantly pushed as a big deal, scoring wins over the likes of Scott Norton, Vader and most notably Shinya Hashimoto on December 26, 1990. Halme was main eventing shows regularly as he was pushed as the biggest star of a crew that included the likes of Bobby Eaton, Chris Benoit, Dean Malenko, Eddy Guerrero and Fit Finlay. Despite Halme not getting over with NJPW fans, the company was doing strong business during his push.

On April 30, 1991, Halme defeated Masashi Aoyagi in a boxer versus karate match. He remained undefeated in NJPW until September 23, 1991, when he was defeated by Shinya Hashimoto in their third match against each other in front of 18,000 fans at the Yokohama Arena. While Halme&#x27;s matches with Hashimoto were not considered quality matches, he has been credited with helping Hashimoto take his career to another level as the win made Hashimoto look like a &quot;real fighter&quot; as opposed to a professional wrestler. Halme&#x27;s &quot;boxer versus wrestler&quot; gimmick was ended on October 18, 1991, when he was defeated by Vader.

In 1992, Halme was teamed in matches with Scott Norton, Bam Bam Bigelow and Barry Windham. He also competed in the NJPW Super Grade Tag League II teaming with Masahiro Chono, together scoring 8 points and finishing fourth overall. The tournament was won by Shinya Hashimoto and Riki Choshu. On November 22, 1992, Halme and Norton won the IWGP Tag Team Championship from The Steiner Brothers (Rick and Scott). However, the next night, Halme and Norton were forced to face each other with separate tag team partners with Halme and Ron Powers losing to Norton and TNT.

On December 14, Halme and Norton lost the IWGP Tag Team Championship to the Hell Raisers (Hawk Warrior and Power Warrior). On January 4, 1993, at &quot;Fantastic Story in Tokyo Dome&quot; (in North America aired on PPV as WCW/New Japan Supershow III), Halme was pinned by Ron Simmons. On February 16, 1993, Halme teamed up with Monsieur Rambo for the IWGP Tag Team Championship against the Hell Raisers, but lost.

Behind the scenes, Halme started having problems with Hawk Warrior and Scott Norton. It also came out that Halme had knocked out Norton in a legitimate street fight, though some claimed this was the result of a sucker punch by Halme. Fearing that Norton would be looking for retribution on Halme, NJPW officials took a secret vote on what to do with the two. Afterwards, Halme started losing matches more regularly and eventually left the promotion in June 1993. His last match took place on June 17, when he and The Barbarian lost to John Tenta and Haku.

===World Wrestling Federation (1993–1994)===
On &quot;Superstars&quot; aired on July 24, Halme debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) as Ludvig Borga, a heel Finn who appeared in a series of vignettes castigating Americans for their perceived deficiencies in issues such as environmental laws and their educational system. His singlet was adorned with the Finnish flag, and his entrance music was &quot;Maamme&quot;, the country&#x27;s national anthem. After an initial streak of squash victories over enhancement talent, Borga defeated former Intercontinental Champion Marty Jannetty at SummerSlam.

Borga was immediately pushed to main event status as he entered a feud with the federation&#x27;s top babyface, &quot;Made in the USA&quot; Lex Luger. On the October 30, 1993 edition of &quot;Superstars&quot; (filmed September 28), Borga ended Tatanka&#x27;s undefeated streak of nearly two years, dominating him throughout their match and ultimately knocking him out with a steel chair while the referee was distracted by Mr. Fuji at ringside. In a mockery of Luger&#x27;s past &quot;Narcissist&quot; gimmick, Borga pinned Tatanka with one finger. At Survivor Series, Borga participated in the main event, teaming up with Yokozuna, Quebecer Jacques and Crush as the &quot;Foreign Fanatics&quot; against &quot;All-Americans&quot; Lex Luger, The Undertaker and The Steiner Brothers. Borga and Luger were the final two remaining participants and Borga was eliminated by Luger after a running forearm smash. On December 14, Borga pinned Intercontinental Champion Razor Ramon at a house show, but the win was overturned and the match resumed because Razor&#x27;s foot was on the bottom rope. Borga pinned Razor again after Shawn Michaels hit Razor with a title belt, but the decision was reversed and Borga disqualified.

On January 17, 1994, Halme injured his ankle in a match with Rick Steiner, forcing the WWF to cancel future plans for the Borga character that included a scheduled appearance at the 1994 Royal Rumble and a proposed WrestleMania X to the match against Earthquake. Halme left the company soon after.

===Catch Wrestling Association (1995–1997)===
Halme wrestled as Ludvig Borga for Catch Wrestling Association (CWA) in 1995. On December 20, Borga won the World Heavyweight Championship, his first and only singles championship, by defeating Rambo at the 1995 Euro Catch Festival. Borga held the title for over a year, including a major title defense against August Smisl at the Euro Catch Festival in July. He then lost the title back to Rambo at Euro Catch Festival on December 21. His final match for the CWA was a boxing match against Tony Richardson, which he won by knocking out Richardson in the fourth round.

==Mixed martial arts==
After retiring from professional wrestling in 1997, Halme went on to fight in the RINGS and Ultimate Fighting Championship, though without appreciable success, notably a 56-second submission loss to Randy Couture at 
UFC XIII.

==Political career==
Halme entered parliament in the 2003 parliamentary elections and during his parliamentary career, Halme raised controversies. The day after the elections, Halme referred to President Tarja Halonen as a lesbian in a radio interview. Halme stated that if a lesbian can be president of Finland and he can be a member of Parliament, anything seems possible. A huge uproar ensued as much of the Finnish media treated the statement as a personal attack on Halonen; Halonen herself made no comment. Halme later apologized, stating that he was sorry that the statement had been interpreted as an insult and that he had been under the genuine impression that Halonen was a lesbian. Halme opted not to run for re-election in 2007 due to health issues.

Halme was also elected to the City Council of Helsinki in the 2004 municipal elections, but announced he would not participate in the council&#x27;s activities. His term officially ended in 2008.

==Personal life==
Halme had a &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; tattoo on his calf. Borga was made to put tape over the tattoo when he wrestled in the WWF.

In 1993, Halme divorced his American wife, Adriana Estrada, whom he had met in the U.S. in 1989. With the help of the marriage, Halme got a green card for the United States. From 1998 to 2005, he was married to Katja Talus. 

During his years in the U.S., Halme was convicted of firearm offenses in the 1990s, and in February 1999, he was in the San Pedro detention center, Los Angeles, for two weeks before he was deported from the U.S.

On July 4, 2003, a handgun was fired inside Halme&#x27;s apartment. No one was injured, but the gun was unlicensed. Halme was subsequently hospitalized, as he had only days before been in a boxing match and was using prescription painkillers, but his blood had additionally contained trace amounts of amphetamines, while a police search of his House of Parliament office turned up illegal steroids. Halme claimed that somebody had put the amphetamines into his drink without his knowledge. In January 2004, his trial was broadcast live on television by the MTV3 digital television channel. Halme received a four-month suspended sentence and a fine, but continued to serve as Member of Parliament. In 2006, he was convicted for driving while impaired.

In early March 2006, Halme was involuntarily committed to a mental hospital, reportedly due to delirium caused by excessive alcohol use. Earlier in 2006 he had been diagnosed with alcohol-related cirrhosis and acute pancreatitis. After spending almost the entire year of 2006 on sick leave, he went on disability pension at end of the Parliamentary term.

In December 2009, Halme told a newspaper that he was suffering from impairment of his short-term memory and had trouble remembering anything, but was still trying to write a book on his political career.

==Death==
On January 8, 2010, two days after his 47th birthday, Halme died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, from an unlicensed handgun. His body was found two days later.

==Filmography==
==Other media==
Halme authored five books and recorded one album called &quot;Mestarit salilla&quot;. Halme had a modest film career starring in Finnish movies &quot;Ponterosa&quot; and &quot;Kohtalon kirja&quot;, and in 1995 had small roles overseas in &quot;Die Hard with a Vengeance&quot; and &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;. Halme was also cast in a minor role in the 1997 blockbuster film &quot;Titanic&quot; but had to withdraw due to a filming delay.

In 1993, Halme&#x27;s professional wrestling persona was part of the Japanese wrestling video game &quot;Shin Nippon Pro Wrestling: Chou Senshi in Tokyo Dome&quot; for Super Famicom (Super Nintendo Entertainment System).

<text>Decumaria, the woodvamps, is a genus of two species of flowering plants in the family Hydrangeaceae, one (&quot;D. barbara&quot;) native to the southeastern United States, and the other (&quot;D. sinensis&quot;) native to central China.

They are shrubby lianas growing to 4–10 m high through shrubs and trees, climbing by means of aerial adhesive rootlets. The leaves are variably deciduous to evergreen (with &quot;D. barbara&quot; tending to be more often deciduous, &quot;D. sinensis&quot; more evergreen), 3–10 cm long, ovate with an acute apex, and a smooth to obscurely toothed margin. The flowers are 5–10 mm diameter, white to creamy colored, fragrant, produced in dense panicles 3–8 cm broad. The fruit is a dry capsule containing several seeds.

<doc id="255258" wikidata="Q157860" url="?curid=255258" title="Deutzia">
<text>Deutzia ( or ) is a genus of about 60 species of flowering plants in the family Hydrangeaceae, native to eastern and central Asia (from the Himalayas east to Japan and the Philippines), and Central America and also Europe. By far the highest species diversity is in China, where 50 species occur.

==Description==

The species are shrubs ranging from in height. Most are deciduous, but a few subtropical species are evergreen. The leaves are opposite, simple, with a serrated margin. The flowers are produced in panicles or corymbs; they are white in most species, sometimes pink or reddish. The fruit is a dry capsule containing numerous small seeds. Identification of the species is very difficult, requiring often microscopic detail of the leaf hairs and seed capsule structure.

==Etymology==

&quot;Deutzia&quot; was named by Carl Peter Thunberg for his friend and patron, Johann van der Deutz, 18th century botanist.

==Taxonomy==
===Selected species===
==Cultivation and uses==
The deutzias are fairly new to gardens: the exception, &quot;D. scabra&quot;, was noticed in Japanese gardens by Engelbert Kaempfer (1712) and Carl Peter Thunberg (1784) but not actually seen in Europe till the 1830s; two-thirds of the species noted in the R.H.S. &quot;Dictionary&quot; were gathered in from the wild during the 20th century.
Deutzias are commonly grown as ornamental plants for their white and pink flowers. Many cultivars and hybrids have been selected for garden use, including selections with double flowers. For example, &quot;Deutzia&quot; × &quot;lemoinei&quot; is a hybrid of &quot;D. gracilis&quot; and &quot;D. parviflora&quot;. The following cultivars and hybrids have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:-

*&quot;Deutzia gracilis&quot; &#x27;Nikko&#x27;
*&quot;Deutzia monbeigii&quot; 
*&quot;Deutzia scabra&quot; ‘Candidissima’
*&quot;Deutzia scabra&quot; ‘Codsall Pink’ 
*&quot;Deutzia setchuenensis&quot; var. &quot;corymbiflora&quot;
*&quot;Deutzia&quot; × &quot;elegantissima&quot; &#x27;Rosealind&#x27;
*&quot;Deutzia&quot; × &quot;hybrida&quot; ‘Contraste’ 
*&quot;Deutzia&quot; × &quot;hybrida&quot; &#x27;Mont Rose&#x27; 
*&quot;Deutzia&quot; × &quot;hybrida&quot; &#x27;Strawberry Fields&#x27;
The temperate deutzias are mostly hardy shrubs from East Asia where winters are dependably frozen; in milder climates, like much of England, the early-flowering species and hybrids are coaxed into premature bloom by mild spells, then spoilt by frost. Alice Coats remarks that deutzias have done better in Edinburgh, on the chilly east coast of Scotland, than in London. A solution in milder climates might be to site deutzia in the garden&#x27;s most exposed, coldest microclimate, as is often done with early-flowering magnolias.
Identification can be difficult, and in particular, many of the plants in cultivation sold as &quot;D. scabra&quot; are actually &quot;D. crenata&quot; (Huxley 1992). The selected hybrid white double &quot;Pride-of-Rochester&quot;, already in cultivation in 1881, was originated by the Rochester, New York nurserymen Ellwanger and Barry.

&quot;Deutzia scabra&quot; is used by joiners in Japan to polish wood.

<doc id="255262" wikidata="Q1184788" url="?curid=255262" title="Suburbicarian diocese">
<text>The seven suburbicarian dioceses are Catholic dioceses located in the vicinity of Rome, whose (titular) bishops are the (now six) ordinary members of the highest-ranking order of cardinals, the cardinal bishops (to which the cardinal patriarchs were added). Pope Francis has, in addition, co-opted five cardinals of the Latin Church to join the ranks of the cardinal bishops. 

Being awarded the titular title of a suburbicarian see is considered more an honor or prestige than aimed towards a functional intent.

== Seven suburbicarian sees ==
The suburbicarian dioceses have varied slightly over time and nowadays consist of:
* the Diocese of Ostia (since 1150 the additional see of the Dean of the College of Cardinals)
* the Diocese of Velletri-Segni
* the Diocese of Porto-Santa Rufina
* the Diocese of Frascati (Tusculum)
* the Diocese of Palestrina
* the Diocese of Albano
* the Diocese of Sabina-Poggio Mirteto

The see of Ostia is conferred on the Dean of the College of Cardinals in addition to the see he already had. (Until 1914, the dean received the see of Ostia and Velletri in place of the see he had earlier. The sees of Ostia and Velletri were separated in 1914.) The cardinal-dean used to be the longest-serving cardinal bishop, but is now chosen by the six cardinal bishops with the approval of the Pope.

===Incumbents===
== Diocesan administration ==
The increasing involvement of the cardinal bishops in the administration of the papal curia resulted in a detachment from their dioceses. Therefore, some of them, in particular the cardinal-bishops of Sabina and Velletri, have for centuries had auxiliary bishops and in 1910 Pope Pius X&#x27;s apostolic constitution &quot;Apostolicae Romanorum&quot; made this practice obligatory for all suburbicarian dioceses.
In 1962, Pope John XXIII in his decree &quot;Suburbicarii sedis&quot; made the cardinal bishops into titular bishops and made provision for the appointment of separate residential diocesan bishops for Velletri-Segni, Porto-Santa-Rufina, Frascati, Palestrina, Albano and Sabina. For the diocese of Ostia – the titular diocese of the Dean of the College of Cardinals – no resident diocesan bishop was appointed; it is entrusted to an apostolic administrator, which is always the Cardinal Vicar of Rome. Though the diocesan bishops exercise all episcopal administrative functions, the cardinal bishops still formally take possession of their titular dioceses.

<text>Il Risorgimento (English: &quot;The Resurgence&quot;) was a liberal, nationalist newspaper founded in Turin, Italy, on 15 December 1847 by Camillo Benso, Count of Cavour and Cesare Balbo, who was a backbone of the &quot;neo-Guelph&quot; party that saw in future a rejuvenated Italy under a republican government with a papal presidency—ideas with which Cavour did not agree. The two men were soon joined by Pietro di Santa Rosa and Michelangelo Castelli, who soon assumed the position of vice-director. Publication began as a result of the relaxation of stringent press control which made the newspaper financially viable. Within weeks the paper, conceived as a weekly, was published daily, as revolutionary events, initiated by an insurgency in Palermo and demonstrations in Genoa, gained momentum. The paper was initiated to form a moderate middle-class &quot;respectable&quot; balance to the more radical &quot;democratic&quot; program of &quot;Concordia&quot;, which was initiated at the same time. The initial editorial by Cavour made the following claim: &quot;Our aim not being of making money but of enlightening the country and of cooperating with the grand works of &quot;Resurgence&quot; initiated by the government.&quot;

Thus without seeming to lead, Cavour&#x27;s &quot;Il Risorgimento&quot; offered a regimen of liberal political ideas, of constitutionalism and freedom from foreign control. From its inception, the paper advocated a constitution to be granted by Carlo Alberto of Savoy, the absolute monarch of Sardinia-Piedmont. The eventual constitution was the Statuto Albertino, which was decreed on 8 February 1848. Cavour&#x27;s editorials were produced with the longer view of preparing Sardinia-Piedmont for a leading role in the coming upheavals, which came to the fore in the revolutionary events of 1848–49. As editor of the newspaper, Cavour gained a great degree of influence in Sardinian politics; in an editorial on 23 March he pressed for a war to drive the Austrians from Lombardy and Venice, where urban revolutions were under way. This proved disastrous for the kingdom with its overwhelming defeat at the Battle of Novara.

Although he withdrew as editor in October 1848, &quot;Il Risorgimento&quot; paved Cavour&#x27;s way towards entering the government—he was appointed prime minister to Victor Emmanuel II in 1852, after Carlo Alberto&#x27;s resignation—and a decade&#x27;s career engineering Italian unification.

In May 1849, &quot;Il Risorgimento&quot; combined with the more conservative &quot;La Nazione&quot;, continuing to support government measures.

In the course of the unification of Italy, the term &quot;Risorgimento&quot; came to be applied to the process of unification itself.

<doc id="255267" wikidata="Q107394" url="?curid=255267" title="Philadelphus">
<text>Philadelphus () (mock-orange) is a genus of about 60 species of shrubs from 3–20 ft (1–6 m) tall, native to North America, Central America, Asia and (locally) in southeast Europe.

They are named &quot;mock-orange&quot; in reference to their flowers, which in wild species look somewhat similar to those of oranges and lemons (&quot;Citrus&quot;) at first glance, and smell of orange flowers and jasmine (&quot;Jasminum&quot;). But &quot;Philadelphus&quot; is a basal asterid, not closely related to &quot;Jasminum&quot; (advanced asterids), and among the eudicots quite distant from &quot;Citrus&quot; (advanced rosids). An entirely misleading name for &quot;Philadelphus&quot; that is sometimes encountered is &quot;syringa&quot;; this properly refers to the lilacs, which are fairly close relatives of jasmine. The connection of the two shrubs lies in their introduction from Ottoman gardens to European ones, effected at the same time by the Holy Roman emperor&#x27;s ambassador to the Sublime Porte, Ogier Ghiselin de Busbecq, who returned to Vienna in 1562. The two shrubs appear together in John Gerard&#x27;s &quot;Herball&quot;, as &quot;Blew Pipe&quot; (the lilac) and &quot;White Pipe Tree&quot;, for the woods of both are pithy and easily hollowed out.

&quot;Philadelphus&quot; is named after an ancient Greek king of Egypt, Ptolemy II Philadelphus.

==Description==

Most are deciduous but a few species from the south of the genus&#x27; range are evergreen. The leaves are opposite, simple, with serrated margins, from 0.5-6 inches (1–14 cm) long. The flowers are white, with four petals and sepals, 0.5-2 inches (1–4 cm) diameter, and commonly (but not in all species) sweetly scented. The fruit is a small capsule, containing numerous small seeds. The bark is thin and flaky, finely shredding in longitudinal strips.

==Ecology==
Mock-oranges are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including the engrailed (&quot;Ectropis crepuscularia&quot;). A noted pathogen of the sweet mock-orange (&quot;P. coronarius&quot;) is the undescribed proteobacterium called &quot;Pseudomonas tomato&quot; (pv. &quot;philadelphi&quot;).

==Cultivation==
For a long time, &quot;Philadelphus coronarius&quot; was the only mock-orange of gardens, though some adventurous Americans grew the native &quot;P. inodorus&quot; that Mark Catesby had discovered growing on the banks of the Savannah River. It appeared in Lady Skipwith&#x27;s garden lists and George Washington ordered some from Bartram in 1792. Mock-oranges are popular shrubs in parks and gardens, grown for their reliable display of late spring flowers; the scented species are particularly valued. In addition to the species, there are numerous garden origin hybrids and cultivars available, selected for doubleness and large flowers, with some compromise as to scent.

===AGM cultivars===
The following hybrid cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:- 

*’Aureus’ (&quot;P. coronarius&quot;) 
*&#x27;Beauclerk&#x27; 
*&#x27;Belle Étoile&#x27; 
*’Innocence’ 
*&#x27;Manteau d&#x27;Hermine&#x27; 
*&#x27;Sybille&#x27; 
*’Variegatus’ (&quot;P. coronarius&quot;) 
==In culture==

Lewis&#x27; mock-orange (&quot;P. lewisii&quot;) is the state flower of Idaho.

&quot;Mock orange&quot; is one of the most famous poems by the Nobel Prize winning poet Louise Glück.

<doc id="255272" wikidata="Q1425202" url="?curid=255272" title="West Florida">
<text>West Florida () was a region on the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico that underwent several boundary and sovereignty changes during its history. Great Britain established West and East Florida in 1763 out of land acquired from France and Spain after the Seven Years&#x27; War. As its name suggests, it was formed out of the western part of former Spanish Florida (East Florida formed the eastern part, with the Apalachicola River as the border), along with land taken from French Louisiana. Pensacola became West Florida&#x27;s capital. The colony included about two thirds of what is now the Florida Panhandle, as well as parts of the modern U.S. states of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.

As the newly acquired territory was too large to govern from one administrative center, the British divided it into two new colonies separated by the Apalachicola River. British West Florida included the part of former Spanish Florida, which lay west of the Apalachicola, as well as parts of former French Louisiana. Its government was based in Pensacola. West Florida thus encompassed all territory between the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers, with a northern boundary which shifted several times over the subsequent years.

Both West and East Florida remained loyal to the British crown during the American Revolution, and served as havens for Tories fleeing from the Thirteen Colonies. Spain invaded West Florida and captured Pensacola in 1781, and after the war Britain ceded both Floridas to Spain. However, the lack of defined boundaries led to a series of border disputes between Spanish West Florida and the fledgling United States known as the West Florida Controversy.

Because of disagreements with the Spanish government, American and English settlers between the Mississippi and Perdido rivers declared that area as the independent Republic of West Florida in 1810. No part of that short-lived republic lay within the borders of the modern U.S. state of Florida; rather, it comprised the Florida parishes of today&#x27;s Louisiana. Within months it was annexed by the United States, which claimed the region as part of the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. In 1819, the United States negotiated the purchase of the remainder of West Florida and all of East Florida in the Adams–Onís Treaty, and in 1822 both were merged into the Florida Territory.

==Background==
The area known as West Florida was originally claimed by Spain as part of &quot;La Florida&quot;, which included most of what is now the southeastern United States. Spain made several attempts to conquer and colonize the area, notably including Tristán de Luna&#x27;s short-lived settlement in 1559, but it was not settled permanently until the 17th century, with the establishment of missions to the Apalachee. In 1698, the settlement of Pensacola was established to check French expansion into the area.

Beginning in the late 17th century, the French established settlements along the Gulf Coast and in the region as part of their colonial &quot;La Louisiane&quot;, including Mobile (1702) and Fort Toulouse (1717) in present-day Alabama and Fort Maurepas (1699) in present-day coastal Mississippi. After years of contention between France and Spain, they agreed to use the Perdido River (the modern border between Florida and Alabama) as the boundary between French Louisiana and Spanish Florida.

Before 1762, France had owned and administered the land west of the Perdido River as part of &quot;La Louisiane&quot;. The secret Treaty of Fontainebleau, concluded in 1762 but not made public until 1764, had effectively ceded to Spain all of French Louisiana west of the Mississippi River, as well as the Isle of Orleans. 

However, under the treaty that had concluded the French and Indian War (Seven Years&#x27; War) in 1763, Britain obtained immediate title to all of French &quot;La Louisiane&quot; east of the Mississippi River. This included the land between the Perdido and Mississippi. Spain also ceded to Great Britain its territory of &quot;La Florida&quot;, in exchange for Cuba, which the British had captured during the war. As a result, for the next two decades, the British controlled nearly all of the coast of the Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi River. Most of the Spanish population left Florida at that time, and its colonial government records were relocated to Havana, Cuba.

Spain, meanwhile, failed to make good by occupancy its title to Louisiana until 1769, when it took formal possession. For six years, therefore, Louisiana as France possessed it, and as Spain received it, included none of the territory between the Mississippi and Perdido rivers, as the title to that territory had passed immediately from France to Britain in 1763.

==Colonial period==


===British era===

Finding this new territory too large to govern as one unit, the British divided it into two new colonies, West Florida and East Florida, separated by the Apalachicola River, as set forth in the Royal Proclamation of 1763. East Florida consisted of most of the formerly Spanish Florida, and retained the old Spanish capital of St. Augustine. West Florida comprised the land between the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers, including land from what had been Spanish Florida and French Louisiana, with Pensacola designated as its capital. The northern boundary was arbitrarily set at the 31st parallel north.

Many English Americans and Scotch-Irish Americans moved to the territory at this time. The Governor of West Florida in November 1763 was George Johnstone; his lieutenant governor, Montfort Browne, was a major landowner in the province who heavily promoted its development. Seven General Assemblies were convoked between 1766 and 1778.

In 1767, the British moved the northern boundary to the 32° 28′ north latitude, extending from the Yazoo to the Chattahoochee River, which included the Natchez District and the Tombigbee District. The appended area included approximately the lower halves of the present states of Mississippi and Alabama. Many new settlers arrived in the wake of the British garrison, swelling the population. In 1774 the First Continental Congress sent letters inviting West Florida to send delegates, but this proposal was declined as the inhabitants were overwhelmingly Loyalist. During the American Revolutionary War, the Governor of West Florida was Peter Chester. The commander of British forces during the war was John Campbell. The colony was attacked in 1778 by the Willing Expedition.

===Spanish era===

Spain entered the American Revolutionary War on the side of France, but not the Thirteen Colonies. Bernardo de Gálvez, governor of Spanish Louisiana, led a military campaign along the Gulf Coast, capturing Baton Rouge and Natchez from the British in 1779, Mobile in 1780, and Pensacola in 1781.

In the 1783 Treaty of Paris ending the war, the British agreed to a boundary between the United States and West Florida at 31° north latitude between the Mississippi and Apalachicola Rivers. However, a separate Anglo-Spanish agreement, which ceded both Florida provinces back to Spain, did not specify a northern boundary for Florida. Spain insisted that its West Florida claim extended fully to the 1767 boundary at 32° 28′, but the United States asserted that the land between 31° and 32° 28′ had always been British territory. This sparked the first West Florida Controversy. Negotiations in 1785–1786 between John Jay and Don Diego de Gardoqui failed to reach a satisfactory conclusion. The border was finally resolved in 1795 by the Treaty of San Lorenzo, in which Spain recognized the 31° parallel as the boundary.

Spain continued to maintain East and West Florida as separate colonies. When Spain acquired West Florida in 1783, the eastern British boundary was the Apalachicola River, but Spain moved it eastward to the Suwannee River in 1785. The purpose was to transfer the military post at San Marcos (now St. Mark&#x27;s) and the district of Apalachee from East Florida to West Florida.

In the secret Treaty of San Ildefonso of 1800, Spain agreed to return Louisiana to France; however, the location of the boundary between Louisiana and West Florida was not explicitly specified. After France sold Louisiana to the United States in 1803, another boundary dispute erupted. The United States laid claim to the territory from the Perdido River to the Mississippi River, which the Americans believed had been a part of the old province of Louisiana when the French agreed to cede it to Spain in 1762. The Spanish insisted that they had administered that portion as the province of West Florida and that it was not part of the territory restored to France by Charles IV in 1802, as France had never given West Florida to Spain, among a list of other reasons.

==Republic of West Florida==
The United States and Spain held long, inconclusive negotiations on the status of West Florida. In the meantime, American settlers established a foothold in the area and resisted Spanish control. British settlers, who had remained, also resented Spanish rule, leading to a rebellion in 1810 and the establishment for 74 days of the Republic of West Florida.

In West Florida from June to September 1810, many secret meetings of those who resented Spanish rule, as well as three openly held conventions, took place in the Baton Rouge district. Out of those meetings grew the West Florida rebellion and the establishment of the independent Republic of West Florida, with its capital at St. Francisville, in present-day Louisiana, on a bluff along the Mississippi River.

Early in the morning on September 23, 1810, armed rebels stormed Fort San Carlos at Baton Rouge and killed two Spanish soldiers &quot;in a sharp and bloody firefight that wrested control of the region from the Spanish.&quot; The rebels unfurled the flag of the new republic, a single white star on a blue field. After the successful attack, organized by Philemon Thomas, plans were made to take Mobile and Pensacola from the Spanish and incorporate the eastern part of the province into the new republic. Reuben Kemper led a small force in an attempt to capture Mobile, but the expedition ended in failure.

Support for the revolt was far from unanimous. The presence of competing pro-Spanish, pro-American, and pro-independence factions, as well as the presence of scores of foreign agents, contributed to a &quot;virtual civil war within the Revolt as the competing factions jockeyed for position.&quot; The faction that favored the continued independence of West Florida secured the adoption of a constitution at a convention in October. The convention had earlier commissioned an army under General Philemon Thomas to march across the territory, subdue opposition to the insurrection, and seek to secure as much Spanish-held territory as possible. &quot;Residents of the western Florida Parishes proved largely supportive of the Revolt, while the majority of the population in the eastern region of the Florida Parishes opposed the insurrection. Thomas&#x27; army violently suppressed opponents of the revolt, leaving a bitter legacy in the Tangipahoa and Tchefuncte River regions.&quot;

On November 7, 1810, Fulwar Skipwith was elected as governor, together with members of a bicameral legislature. Skipwith was inaugurated on November 29, 1810. A week later, he and many of his fellow officials still lingered at St Francisville preparing to go to Baton Rouge, where the next session of the legislature was to consider his ambitious program. The impending U.S. takeover apparently came as a surprise to Skipwith when the Mississippi Territory governor, David Holmes, and his party approached the town. Holmes persuaded all except a few leaders, including Skipwith and Philemon Thomas, the general of the West Florida troops, to acquiesce to American authority.

Skipwith complained bitterly to Holmes that, as a result of seven years of U.S. tolerance of continued Spanish occupation, the United States had abandoned its right to the country and that the West Florida people would not now submit to the American government without conditions. Skipwith and several of his unreconciled legislators then departed for the fort at Baton Rouge, rather than surrender the country unconditionally and without terms.

At Baton Rouge on December 9, 1810, Skipwith informed Holmes that he would no longer resist but could not speak for the troops in the fort. Their commander was John Ballinger, who upon the assurance of Holmes that his troops would not be harmed, agreed to surrender the fort. The Orleans Territory governor, William C. C. Claiborne and his armed forces from Fort Adams landed above the town. Holmes reported to Claiborne that &quot;the armed citizens ... are ready to retire from the fort and acknowledge the authority of the United States&quot; without insisting upon any terms. Claiborne agreed to a respectful ceremony to mark the formal act of transfer. Thus, at 2:30 p.m. that afternoon, December 10, 1810, &quot;the men within the fort marched out and stacked their arms and saluted the flag of West Florida as it was lowered for the last time, and then dispersed.&quot;

The boundaries of the Republic of West Florida included all territory south of parallel 31°N, east of the Mississippi River and north of the waterway formed by the Iberville River, Amite River, Lake Maurepas, Pass Manchac, Lake Pontchartrain, and the Rigolets. The Pearl River with its branch that flowed into the Rigolets formed the eastern boundary of the republic.

==American annexation of the territory==
On October 27, 1810, U.S. President James Madison proclaimed that the United States should take possession of West Florida between the Mississippi and Perdido Rivers, based on a tenuous claim that it was part of the Louisiana Purchase. (See &quot;The U.S. claim&quot;, below.) The West Florida government opposed annexation, preferring to negotiate terms to join the Union. Governor Fulwar Skipwith proclaimed that he and his men would &quot;surround the Flag-Staff and die in its defense&quot;. William C. C. Claiborne was sent to take possession of the territory, entering the capital of St. Francisville with his forces on December 6, 1810, and Baton Rouge on December 10, 1810. Claiborne refused to recognize the legitimacy of the West Florida government, however, and Skipwith and the legislature eventually agreed to accept Madison&#x27;s proclamation. Congress passed a joint resolution, approved January 15, 1811, to provide for the temporary occupation of the disputed territory and declaring that the territory should remain subject to future negotiation.

On February 12, 1812, Congress secretly authorized President James Madison to take possession of the portion of West Florida located west of the Perdido River that was not already in the possession of the United States, with authorization to use military and naval force as deemed necessary. On April 14, 1812, Congress authorized the portion of the territory west of the Pearl River to be incorporated into the state of Louisiana, which would be formally created on April 30, but it was not formally attached until the state&#x27;s legislature approved it on August 4. The U.S. annexed the Mobile District of West Florida to the Mississippi Territory on May 14, 1812, although this decision was not effected with military force until nearly a year later. (See Major Gen. James Wilkinson&#x27;s role.) According to one historian, &quot;The incorporation of West Florida into the Orleans district represents the emergence of infant American imperialism by the newly constructed union. Using force, not negotiations, Claiborne and his army, with Madison&#x27;s proclamation, forced Skipwith and his sympathizers to accept foreign rule.&quot;

===United States claim===
By the secret treaty of October 1, 1800, between France and Spain, known as the St. Ildefonso treaty, Spain returned to France in 1802 the province of Louisiana as at that time possessed by Spain, and such as it was when France last possessed it in 1769.p 48 (In contrast, alluded to the time of France&#x27;s &quot;original&quot;, not last, possession.)

It is important that in the transfer of Louisiana to the United States, the identical language in Article 3 of the 1800 St. Ildefonso treaty was used. The ambiguity in this third article lent itself to the purpose of U.S. envoy James Monroe, although he had to adopt an interpretation that France had not asserted nor Spain allowed.p 83 Monroe examined each clause of the third article and interpreted the first clause as if Spain since 1783 had considered West Florida as part of Louisiana. The second clause only served to render the first clause clearer. The third clause referred to the treaties of 1783 and 1795, and was designed to safeguard the rights of the United States. This clause then simply gave effect to the others.p 84-85

According to Monroe, France never dismembered Louisiana while it was in her possession. (He regarded November 3, 1762, as the termination date of French possession, rather than 1769, when France formally delivered Louisiana to Spain.) After 1783, Spain reunited West Florida to Louisiana, Monroe held, thus completing the province as France possessed it, with the exception of those portions controlled by the United States. By a strict interpretation of the treaty, therefore, Spain might be required to cede to the United States such territory west of the Perdido as once belonged to France.p 84-85

===Counters to the U.S. claim===

# In 1800, denominated Louisiana did not include West Florida.p 288-291
# Spain, in all negotiations with France, refused to cede any part of Florida.p 288-291
# In 1801, Spain informed the Spanish governors in North America that the territory ceded to France did not include West Florida.p 87-88
# In Spanish government ordinances and treaties, the Floridas were always specified as distinct from all other Spanish possessions.p 49-50

# France never gave any part of Florida to Spain, so Spain could not give it back.p 50-52
# In the time Spain held the Floridas, they were always called the Floridas and never referred to as a portion of Louisiana. Treaties between United States and Spain also called them the Floridas.p 50-52
# In 1803, France began negotiating with Spain to acquire West and East Florida, confirming that France did not consider West Florida to have already been acquired.p 50-52
# During his negotiations with France, U.S. envoy Robert Livingston wrote nine reports to Madison in which he stated that West Florida was not in the possession of France.p 43-44
# President Jefferson asked U.S. officials in the border area for advice on the limits of Louisiana, the best informed of whom did not believe it included West Florida.p 87-88
# When Louisiana was formally delivered to the United States, the U.S. did not demand possession of West Florida.p 97-100

# In November 1804, in response to Livingston, France declared the American claim to West Florida absolutely unfounded.p 113-116
# In January 1805, the French and Spanish ambassadors jointly informed Madison that the American claim to West Florida was untenable. Madison pointed to pre-1763 maps that showed West Florida as part of the former French Louisiana territory. The French ambassador pointed out to Madison&#x27;s dismay that the same applied to Tennessee and Kentucky.p 116-117
# Upon the failure of Monroe&#x27;s 1804–1805 special mission, Madison was ready to abandon the American claim to West Florida altogether.p 118
# In 1805, Monroe&#x27;s last proposition to Spain to obtain West Florida was absolutely rejected.p 293
# In an 1809 letter, Jefferson virtually admitted that West Florida was not a possession of the United States.p 46-47
# The U.S. title to the Louisiana territory was itself a vitiated title by virtue of the 1800 France-Spain treaty.p 26
# General Andrew Jackson personally accepted the delivery of title to West Florida from its Spanish governor on July 17, 1821.

==Later history and legacy==

The Spanish continued to dispute the annexation of the western parts of its West Florida colony, but their power in the region was too weak to do anything about it. They continued administering the remainder of the colony (between the Perdido and Suwannee Rivers) from the capital at Pensacola.

On February 22, 1819, Spain and the United States signed the Adams-Onís Treaty. In this treaty, Spain ceded both West and East Florida to the United States in exchange for compensation and the renunciation of American claims to Texas. Following ratification by Spain on October 24, 1820, and the United States on February 19, 1821, the treaty took effect, thereby establishing the current boundaries.

President James Monroe was authorized on March 3, 1821, to take possession of East Florida and West Florida for the United States and provide for initial governance. As a result, the U.S. military took over and governed both Floridas with Andrew Jackson serving as governor. The United States soon organized the Florida Territory on March 30, 1822, by combining East Florida and the rump West Florida east of the Perdido River and establishing a territorial government. It was then admitted to the Union as a state on March 3, 1845.

West Florida had an effect on choosing the location of Florida&#x27;s current capital. At first, the Legislative Council of the Territory of Florida determined to rotate between the historic capitals of Pensacola and St. Augustine. The first legislative session was held at Pensacola on July 22, 1822; this required delegates from St. Augustine to travel 59 days by sea to attend. To get to the second session in St. Augustine, Pensacola members traveled 28 days over land. During this session, the council decided future meetings should be held at a half-way point to reduce the distance. Eventually, Tallahassee, site of an 18th-century Apalachee settlement, was selected as the midpoint between the former capitals of East and West Florida.

The portions of West Florida now located in Louisiana are known as the Florida Parishes. The Republic of West Florida Historical Museum is located in Jackson, Louisiana, run by the Republic of West Florida Historical Association. In 1991, the lineage society &quot;The Sons &amp; Daughters of the Province &amp; Republic of West Florida 1763–1810&quot; was founded for the descendants of settlers of the period. Its objective included to &quot;collect and preserve records, documents and relics pertaining to the history and genealogy of West Florida prior to December 7, 1810&quot;. In 1993, the Louisiana State Legislature renamed Interstate 12, the full length of which is contained in the Florida Parishes, as the &quot;Republic of West Florida Parkway&quot;.

In 1998, Leila Lee Roberts, a great-granddaughter of Fulwar Skipwith, donated the original copy of the constitution of the West Florida Republic and the supporting papers to the Louisiana State Archives in Baton Rouge. Southeastern Louisiana University in Hammond also holds an archival collection of documents from British West Florida and the Republic of West Florida, some of them dating back to 1764.

<text>East Florida () was a colony of Great Britain from 1763 to 1783 and a province of the Spanish Empire from 1783 to 1821. The British gained control over Spanish Florida in 1763 as part of the Treaty of Paris that ended the Seven Years&#x27; War. Deciding that the colony was too large to administer as a single unit, British officials divided Florida into two colonies separated by the Apalachicola River: the colony of East Florida, with its capital located in St. Augustine; and West Florida, with its capital located in Pensacola. East Florida was much larger and comprised the bulk of the former Spanish colony and most of the current state of Florida. It had also been the most populated region of Spanish Florida, but before control was transferred to Britain, most residents – including virtually everyone in St. Augustine – left the territory, with most migrating to Cuba.

Britain tried to attract settlers to the two Floridas without much success. The sparsely populated colonies were invited to send representatives to the Continental Congress but chose not to do so, and they remained loyal to Great Britain during the American Revolutionary War. However, as part of the 1783 treaty in which Britain officially recognized the independence of thirteen of its former colonies as the United States, it ceded both Floridas back to Spain, which maintained them as separate colonies while moving the boundary east to the Suwannee River.

By the early 1800s, Spain had proved uninterested in and incapable of organizing or defending either of the two Floridas much beyond the two small capital cities. American settlers moved into the territory without authorization, causing conflict with the Seminoles, a new Native American culture formed by indigenous refugees from the American Southeast. During the War of 1812, the American military invaded Florida, occupying West Florida while East Florida remained in Spanish hands. American settlers in East Florida further weakened Spanish control in 1812 when a group of Americans, mostly from Georgia, calling themselves the &quot;Patriots&quot;, declared the short-lived Republic of East Florida at Amelia Island with semi-official support from the U.S. government.

Border disputes between the United States and Seminoles in Florida continued after the war. By 1817, much of Spanish West Florida had been occupied and annexed by the United States over Spanish objections, with the land eventually becoming portions of the states of Louisiana, Alabama, and Mississippi. After a decade of intensifying border disputes and American incursions, Spain ceded both Floridas to the U.S. in the Adams–Onís Treaty of 1819. The U.S. officially took possession in 1821; in 1822, all of East Florida and the few remaining portions of West Florida were combined into a single Florida Territory with borders that closely approximated those of the current state of Florida.

==British period==
Under the terms of the 1763 Treaty of Paris, which ended the Seven Years&#x27; War (the French and Indian War), Spain ceded Spanish Florida to Britain. At the same time, Britain received all of French Louisiana east of the Mississippi River, with the exception of New Orleans, from France. Determining the new territory too large to administer as one unit, Britain divided its new southeastern acquisitions into two new colonies separated by the Apalachicola River: East Florida, with its capital in the old Spanish city of St. Augustine, and West Florida, with its capital at Pensacola. However, most of the Spanish population departed following the signing of the treaty, with the entirety of St. Augustine emigrating to Cuba.

The settlement of East Florida was heavily linked in London to the same interests that controlled Nova Scotia. The East Florida Society of London and the Nova Scotia Society of London had many overlapping members, and Council frequently followed their suggestions on the granting of lands to powerful merchant interests in London.

The apportionment of lands in the new colonies fell to the same group of English and Scottish entrepreneurs and merchant interests, led chiefly by the Scottish slave trader Richard Oswald and the British general James Grant, who would later become governor of East Florida. A list of the grantees in both Florida and Canada shows that the plums fell to a well-connected—and inter-connected—group. Lincoln&#x27;s Inn barrister Levett Blackborne, grandson of Sir Richard Levett, a powerful merchant and Lord Mayor of London, came in for grants of in both locales, for instance. Other aristocrats, nobles, and merchants did the same.

The most powerful lubricant between the East Florida speculators and the Nova Scotia speculators was Col. Thomas Thoroton of Flintham, Nottinghamshire. Thoroton, the stepbrother of Levett Blackborne, had married an illegitimate daughter of the Duke of Rutland and often lived at Belvoir Castle, where he acted as principal agent to the Duke, who, along with his son, the Marquis of Granby, were heavily involved in overseas ventures. Thoroton frequently acted as the go-between for Richard Oswald and James Grant, particularly after those two gave up their Nova Scotia Grants to focus on East Florida, where a drumbeat of steady speculation (particularly from Andrew Turnbull and William Stork) had fanned the flames of interest in London. It was not until March 1781 that the Governor of East Florida, Patrick Tonyn, called elections for a provincial legislature.

East Florida remained loyal to Great Britain during the American Revolution. The colony became a haven for Loyalist refugees and fugitive slaves fleeing to British lines from the Southern Colonies during the American War of Independence, and several military units were established by Loyalists in East Florida.
Spain participated indirectly in the war as an ally of France and captured Pensacola from the British in 1781. In the 1783 Treaty of Paris, which ended the war, the British ceded both Floridas to Spain. The same treaty recognized the independence of the United States, directly to the north.

=== Government ===
&quot;Governor of British East Florida&quot; was an appointed position. A legislative council did exist which shared power with the governor. The governor could appoint officials but they needed to be approved by the British government. These positions included: an attorney general, chief justice, coroner, etc. An official could be suspended but needed to get the council&#x27;s consent. A court relating to maritime cases, the East Florida Court of Vice Admiralty was created in April 1771. The British province of East Florida had a royal seal, as did the province of West Florida. The seal for East Florida had on one side a depiction of a fortified town and harbor with the Latin motto &quot;Moresque Viris et Moenia Ponet&quot; (&quot;He will establish customs for men, and walls&quot;).

=== Demography ===

==== Racial demographics ====
During the period of British rule in East Florida, the black population came to outnumber the white population in the province by a ratio of 2 to 1. The ratio of blacks to whites in East Florida was lower than in British West Florida but higher than in the other southern British colonies. Those who were white in Florida generally served in the military or worked as overseers, artisans, or merchants. There were very few white yeomen farmers. White residents generally lived in or around St. Augustine with an exception being generally made for overseers and those who resided in New Smyrna. Due to the poor treatment of Minorcans in New Smyrna, some left for St. Augustine, where a large number of them lived in a section of the city known as the &quot;Minorcan Quarter&quot; or the &quot;Greek Quarter&quot;.

==== Population and other characteristics ====
It is unclear what the population of East Florida was prior to the American Revolution but it is estimated to have had a population of close to 3,000, making it much larger in population than West Florida, which is believed to have had only several hundred residents. The British tried to encourage settlement in East and West Florida, thinking it would take pressure off the proclamation line that colonists in the northern British colonies wanted to move beyond. However, this plan was generally unsuccessful as many of those who got land grants did not end up settling on those lands. By 1783 the population of East Florida was about 17,000.

During the American Revolution, East Florida sided with the British and became a loyalist haven. With the end of the Revolution and the handing over of both Floridas to the Spanish, many loyalists were hesitant to leave. In the end, most of the loyalist and British residents, approximately 10,000 people, left with most of these going to the Bahamas or West Indies and some going to Nova Scotia and England. Another 4,000 people &quot;melted away into the wilderness&quot;, with some going as far away as the Mississippi River.

A town named St. Johns Bluff or St. Johns Town was laid out in 1779 along the St. Johns River. The planned community was the first town to be established on the river. Most of those who fled to Florida settled at that town and St. Augustine. St. Johns Bluff became a port and had 300 houses in it by the spring of 1783. With the end of the British period, it was renamed as St. Vincent Ferrer before it was eventually abandoned. A settlement named Rollestown was established by Denys Rolle southeast of St. Augustine, on the east shore of the St. Johns River, south of Deep Creek.

St. Augustine, the capital of the colony, was much smaller and less advanced than the capitals of the other Thirteen Colonies.

=== Slavery and economics ===
East Florida did not establish a formal slave code until 1782. Those who were black or of mixed race of European and African origin and could not prove they were free were considered to be slaves. During the American Revolution, many Georgians and Carolinians moved to Florida along with their slaves. The colonial government, along with slave-owners, used slaves to construct defensive fortifications. A militia act that allowed for conscripting slaves as laborers and soldiers was passed in 1781.

Goods produced and exported in East Florida included sugar, timber, indigo, rice, naval stores, and barrel staves; most of these goods came from plantations along the St. Marys and St. Johns rivers that used slave labor.

Bernard Romans wrote the first account of Spanish fishing ranchos existing along Florida&#x27;s southwest coast in 1770. When the British took control of Florida, they monitored the fisherman but let them continue their activities. Governor James Grant was ordered to stop the fisherman from operating but did not enforce that order. At one point the fishing boats were suspected of being a threat to British control, but a complete review in 1767-68 found they were harmless.

=== Media ===

&quot;The East Florida Gazette&quot; was a pro-loyalist newspaper that was published weekly in St. Augustine from 1783 to 1784. It was founded by a loyalist printer, John Wells, and his brother, William Charles Wells, who had moved to St. Augustine from Charleston, South Carolina. The paper was printed ...at the Printing-office in Treasury-lane. Prior to the establishment of a newspaper, most news came into St. Augustine through gazettes that were published in Savannah, Georgia, and Charleston.

The Wells brothers also published two books: &quot;Nature and the Principles of Public Credit&quot;, by Samuel Gale, along with &quot;The Case of the Inhabitants of East Florida&quot;, written by John Wells himself. In 1783, another printer named David Zubly, who was a loyalist refugee from Savannah, Georgia, printed the first book in the colony, a copy of John Tobler&#x27;s &quot;Almanack&quot;, at his home.

==Spanish period: &quot;Florida Oriental&quot;==
 Under Spanish rule, the provinces of East Florida and West Florida initially remained divided by the Apalachicola River, the boundary established by the British. However, Spain moved it eastward to the Suwanee River in 1785.

Spain continued to administer East and West Florida as separate provinces. The Spanish offered favorable terms for acquiring land, which attracted many settlers from the newly formed United States. There were several territorial disputes between the U.S. and Spain, some resulting in military action, including the Patriot War in 1812 and the filibuster at Amelia Island in 1817.

An American army under Andrew Jackson invaded East Florida during the First Seminole War. Jackson&#x27;s forces captured San Marcos on 7 April 1818; as well as Fort Barrancas at West Florida&#x27;s capital, Pensacola, on 24 May 1818.

James Monroe&#x27;s secretary of state, John Quincy Adams, defined the American position on this issue. Adams accused Spain of breaking Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty by failing to control the Seminoles. Faced with the prospect of losing control, Spain formally ceded all of its Florida territory to the U.S. under the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1819 (ratified in 1821), in exchange for the U.S. ceding its claims on Texas and the U.S. paying any claims its citizens might have against Spain, up to $5,000,000.

In 1822, the U.S. Congress organized the Florida Territory, merging East Florida and the portion of West Florida that had remained under Spanish control until 1821. In 1845, Florida was admitted as the 27th state of the United States.

=== Population and demographics ===
With the transfer of Florida to Spain, a number of former British subjects decided to stay while some Spaniards came to Florida. St. Augustine had a mix of both residents from the British period and newly arrived Spaniards. The rural areas settled by colonists were described as being &quot;exclusively Anglo&quot;. During the Spanish period, the population of St. Augustine &quot;hovered&quot; at about 3,000 people, with half of its population being black slaves. There were nine Native American towns in Florida, but those towns were not counted in the 1786 census. In 1786, St. Augustine had a population of about 950 people. Three hundred of whom had some degree of African descent whether they were enslaved or not.

=== Economics ===
With the return of the Spanish, the system of plantation agriculture developed in the colony during the British period remained. Although the production levels were not as high as other British colonies, cash crops like indigo, hemp, and rum made in Spanish East Florida led to economic growth there. As a result, St. Augustine became less dependent on the &quot;royal situado&quot; (royal financial payments for support). Trade became less restrictive during the second Spanish period as the Spanish monarchies enacted reforms allowing for trade between Spanish and non-Spanish areas, which benefited St. Augustine.

St. Augustine was the largest port on the Atlantic Ocean south of Charleston. Ships would travel often to Charleston, South Carolina and Cap Français in Haiti where goods were traded and crews learned the latest news as well. East Florida became economically dependent on the United States after Spain started to align with France and declared war on the British in 1796; as a result British trade largely stopped. Charleston began to surpass Havana as St. Augustine&#x27;s biggest trading partner while Savannah, Philadelphia and New York City had become trading partners with the city. East Florida exported oranges, lumber and cotton to the United States while fish, grain and foodstuffs were imported from the United States.

Spain was concerned about the Haitian Revolution, fearing that ideas of independence could be spread to their own colonies, including Florida, with Governor Quesada doing his best to follow the Spanish government&#x27;s policy of prohibiting interactions with French possessions, &quot;...forbidding the introduction of French ideas, books, citizens, or slaves originating from French possessions.&quot;

<doc id="255275" wikidata="Q420782" url="?curid=255275" title="Apple IIc">
<text>The Apple IIc is a personal computer introduced by Apple Inc. shortly after the launch of the original Macintosh in 1984. It is essentially a compact and portable version of the Apple IIe. The IIc has a built-in floppy disk drive and a keyboard, and was often sold with its matching monitor. The &quot;c&quot; in the name stands for &quot;compact&quot;, referring to the fact it is a complete Apple II setup in a smaller notebook-sized housing. It is compatible with a wide range of Apple II software and peripherals.

The Apple IIc has rear peripheral expansion ports integrated onto the main logic board instead of the expansion slots and direct motherboard access of earlier Apple II models. Apple intended the Apple IIc to require less technical expertise to use. The Apple IIc weighs . It was succeeded by the Apple IIc Plus in 1988.

==History==
The Apple IIc was released on April 24, 1984, during an Apple-held event called &quot;Apple II Forever&quot;. With that motto, Apple proclaimed the new machine was proof of the company&#x27;s long-term commitment to the Apple II and its users, despite the recent introduction of the Macintosh. The IIc was also seen as the company&#x27;s response to the new IBM PCjr, and Apple hoped to sell 400,000 by the end of 1984. While essentially an Apple IIe computer in a smaller case, it was not a successor, but rather a portable version to complement it. One Apple II machine would be sold for users who required the expandability of slots, and another for those wanting the simplicity of a plug and play machine with portability in mind.

The machine introduced Apple&#x27;s Snow White design language, notable for its case styling and a modern look designed by Hartmut Esslinger which became the standard for Apple equipment and computers for nearly a decade. The Apple IIc introduced a unique off-white coloring known as &quot;Fog&quot;, chosen to enhance the Snow White design style. The IIc and some peripherals were the only Apple products to use the &quot;Fog&quot; coloring. While relatively light-weight and compact in design, the Apple IIc was not a true portable in design as it lacked a built-in battery and display.

Codenames for the machine while under development included Lollie, ET, Yoda, Teddy, VLC, IIb, IIp.

==Overview of features==
===Improving the IIe===
Technically the Apple IIc was an Apple IIe in a smaller case, more portable and easier to use but also less expandable. The IIc used the CMOS-based 65C02 microprocessor which added 27 new instructions to the 6502, but was incompatible with programs that used deprecated illegal opcodes of the 6502. (Apple stated that the Apple IIc was compatible with 90–95% of the 10,000 software packages available for the Apple II.) The new ROM firmware allowed Applesoft BASIC to recognize lowercase characters and work better with an 80-column display, and fixed several bugs from the IIe ROM. In terms of video, the text display added 32 unique character symbols called &quot;MouseText&quot; which, when placed side by side, could display simple icons, windows and menus to create a graphical user interface completely out of text, similar in concept to IBM code page 437 or PETSCII&#x27;s box-drawing characters. A year later, the Apple IIe would benefit from these improvements in the form of a four-chip upgrade called the Enhanced IIe.

===Built-in cards and ports===
The equivalent of five expansion cards were built-in and integrated into the Apple IIc motherboard: An Extended 80-Column Text Card, two Super Serial Cards, a Mouse Card, and a Disk II floppy drive controller card. This meant the Apple IIc had 128 KB RAM, 80-column text, and Double-Hi-Resolution graphics built-in and available right out of the box, unlike its older sibling, the Apple IIe. It also meant less of a need for slots, as the most popular peripheral add-on cards were already built-in, ready for devices to be plugged into the rear ports of the machine. The built-in cards were mapped to phantom slots so software from slot-based Apple II models would know where to find them (i.e. mouse to virtual slot 4, serial cards to slot 1 and 2, floppy to slot 6, and so on). The entire Apple Disk II Card, used for controlling floppy drives, had been shrunk down into a single chip called the &quot;IWM&quot; which stood for Integrated Woz Machine.

In the rear of the machine were its expansion ports, mostly for providing access to its built-in cards. The standard DE-9 joystick connector doubled as a mouse interface, compatible with the same mice used by the Lisa and early Macintosh computers. Two serial ports were provided primarily to support a printer and modem, and a floppy port connector supported a single external 5.25-inch drive (and later &quot;intelligent&quot; devices such as 3.5-inch drives and hard disks). A Video Expansion port provided rudimentary signals for add-on adapters but, alone, could not directly generate a video signal (Apple produced an LCD and an RF-modulator for this port; the latter shipped with early IIc computers). A port connector tied into an internal 12 V power converter for attaching batteries; this is where the infamous external power supply (dubbed &quot;brick on a leash&quot; by users) that was included plugged in. The same composite video port found on earlier Apple II models remained present; however, gone were the cassette ports and internal DIP-16 game port.

===Built-in accessories and keyboard===
The Apple IIc had a built-in 5.25-inch floppy drive (140 KB) along the right side of the case—the first Apple II model to include such a feature. Along the left side of the case was a dial to control the volume of the internal speaker, along with a -inch monaural audio jack for headphones or an external speaker. A fold-out carrying handle was also used to prop up the back end of the machine when in use. This was required to provide good air circulation and make typing comfortable.

The keyboard layout mirrored that of the Apple IIe; however, the &quot;Reset&quot; key had been moved above the &quot;Esc&quot; key. Two toggle switches were also located in the same area: an &quot;80/40&quot;-column switch for (specially written) software to detect which text video mode to start up in, and a &quot;Keyboard&quot; switch to select between QWERTY and Dvorak layout—or between US and national layout on non-American machines. The keyboard itself was built into the front half of the case, much like a notebook computer, and early models had a rubber mat placed beneath the keycaps which acted as a liquid spill guard.

==Reception==
Although Apple predicted that it would sell 100,000 IIc computers per month, it sold an average of 100,000 per year over four years; even the unsuccessful PCjr outsold it during each computer&#x27;s first year on the market. The IIe was much more popular than the IIc because of its greater expandability, with the latter not outselling the former until late 1984, but Apple almost stopped production of the IIe because of the IIc&#x27;s expected popularity, causing a shortage of the former and glut of the latter. However, according to Paul Kunkel in &quot;AppleDesign&quot;, Apple sold more than 400,000 Apple IIc computers in the first year, most of the sales including the matching monitor.

While noting its lack of an internal modem and inability to use expansion cards such as the popular Z-80 SoftCard, &quot;BYTE&quot; in May 1984 described the Apple IIc as a &quot;head-to-head [competitor] with the IBM PCjr&quot; for novice computer users. &quot;Creative Computing&quot; agreed, stating in July 1984 that &quot;This war will have no clear winner. Apple fans will buy the IIc, and IBM fans will buy the PCjr. I believe the Apple II will live forever&quot;, with the IIc as the &quot;final transmutation&quot; of the Apple II because it was about as small as a computer with a full-sized keyboard and 5 1/4&quot; drive could be. The magazine said in December 1984 that the IIe and IIc were the best home computers with prices above $500, with the IIc better for those using word processing and business software.

In the end, however, both the Apple IIc and the PCjr were completely eclipsed by the Tandy 1000, released in late 1984. The 1000 offered essentially all the important features of the PCjr -- and even the full-size IBM PC -- at a list price of only about $1000 ($999-$1200). It further included a keyboard vastly superior to the IIc or PCjr (normal-sized, full-stroke keys, with a full numeric keypad), and superior IBM PC compatibility -- superior even to IBM&#x27;s own PCjr. Both the IIc and PCjr would be comparatively short-lived (the latter discontinued less than a year after the 1000&#x27;s introduction), while the 1000 -- in various iterations -- continued in production for nine years, until Tandy stopped making its own computers.

==Revisions==
The Apple IIc was in production from April 1984 to August 1988, and during this time accrued some minor changes. These modifications included three new ROM updates, a bug-fix correction to the original motherboard, a newly revised motherboard, and a slight cosmetic change to the external appearance of the machine. The ROM revision for a specific Apple IIc is determined by entering the Applesoft BASIC programming language and typing in the command which returns the value indicating the particular ROM version.

===Original IIc (ROM version &#x27;255&#x27;)===
The initial ROM, installed in machines produced during the first year and a half of production, was 16 KB in size. The only device which could be connected to the disk port was (one) external 5.25-inch floppy drive; software could be booted from this external drive by typing the command . The serial port did not mask incoming linefeed characters or support the XON/XOFF protocol, unlike all later firmware revisions to come. There was no self-test diagnostic present in this ROM; holding down the key during cold boot merely cycled unusual patterns on screen which served no useful purpose or indication of the machine&#x27;s health.

===Serial port timing fix===
Serial ports on Apple IIc motherboards manufactured before December 1984 are 2.9% slower than the Electronic Industries Association standard, greater than the permitted plus or minus 2% variance. Non-Apple modems with speeds greater than 300 baud are incompatible with the ports. The motherboards derived the serial timing through a 74LS161 TTL logic chip. This caused some third-party modems and printers, which operated at 1200 baud or faster, to function improperly. Slower serial devices operating at 300 baud or less were unaffected, as well as some faster devices which could tolerate the deviation. The solution to ensure all devices were compatible was to replace the TTL chip with a 1.8432 MHz crystal oscillator (next to capacitor C19) during manufacture. Apple would swap affected motherboards for users who could prove they had an incompatible serial device (e.g. a third-party 1200-baud modem which presented problems; not all did).

===UniDisk 3.5 support (ROM version &#x27;0&#x27;)===
This update, introduced in November 1985, came in the form of an upgrade to the ROM firmware which doubled in size from 16 KB to 32 KB. The new ROM supported &quot;intelligent&quot; devices such as the Apple UniDisk 3.5-inch (800 KB) floppy drive and Smartport-based hardisks, in addition to an external 5.25-inch floppy drive. A new self-test diagnostic was provided for testing built-in RAM and other signs of logic faults. The Mini-Assembler, absent since the days of the Apple II Plus, made a return, and new Monitor &quot;Step&quot; and &quot;Trace&quot; commands were added as well. The upgraded ROM added rudimentary support for an external AppleTalk networking device which was yet to be developed. When attempting to boot virtual slot 7, users would encounter the message &quot;APPLETALK OFFLINE&quot;. The IIc, however, had no built-in networking capabilities, and no external device was ever released. The upgrade consisted of a single chip swap (and a trivial motherboard modification), which Apple provided free only to persons who purchased a UniDisk 3.5 drive. A small sticker with an icon of a 3.5-inch floppy diskette was placed next to the existing 5.25-inch diskette icon above the floppy drive port indicating the machine had been upgraded.

===Memory Expansion IIc (ROM version &#x27;3&#x27;)===
Introduced in September 1986 simultaneously with the Apple II, this model introduced a new motherboard, new keyboard and new color scheme. The original Apple IIc had no expansion options and required third-party cards (e. Legend Industries) to perform various hardware tricks. This could be done by removing the CPU and MMU chips and inserting a special board into these sockets, which then used bank switching to expand memory up to 1 Megabyte (RAM). This was similar to the function of the slots in the original Apple II, II+ as well as the auxiliary slot in the Apple IIe. The new motherboard added a 34-pin socket for plugging in memory cards directly, which allowed for the addressing of up to 1 megabyte (MB) of memory using Slinky-type memory cards. The onboard chip count was reduced from 16 memory chips (64K×1) to four (64K×4). The new firmware removed the code for the cancelled AppleTalk networking device and replaced it with support for memory cards. Bumping out the non-supported AppleTalk functionality, memory now lived in virtual slot 4, and mouse support moved to slot 7. The new keyboard no longer had the rubber anti-spill mat and offered generally more tactile and responsive keys that felt more &quot;clicky&quot;. At the same time, the color of the keyboard, floppy drive latch, and power supply cords changed from beige to light grey, which matched the new Platinum color scheme of the Apple II. The case style, however, remained Snow White. Owners of the previous IIc model were entitled to a free motherboard upgrade if they purchased one of Apple&#x27;s IIc memory expansion boards (they did not receive the new keyboard or the cosmetic changes).

===Memory Expansion fix (ROM version &#x27;4&#x27;)===
In January 1988, a new ROM firmware update was issued to address bugs in the new memory-expandable IIc. Changes included better detection of installed RAM chips, correction of a problem when using the serial modem port in terminal mode, and a bug fix for keyboard buffering. The ROM upgrade was available free of charge only to owners of the memory expansion IIc. This was the final change to the Apple IIc; it would be superseded that September by the Apple IIc Plus (identified as ROM version &#x27;5&#x27;).

==International versions==
Like the Apple IIe before it, the Apple IIc keyboard differed depending on what region of the world it was sold in. Sometimes the differences were very minor, such as extra local language characters and symbols printed on certain keycaps (e.g. French accented characters on the Canadian IIc such as &quot;à&quot;, &quot;é&quot;, &quot;ç&quot;, etc., or the British Pound &quot;£&quot; symbol on the UK IIc) while other times the layout and shape of keys greatly differed (e.g. European IIcs). In order to access the local character set, the &quot;Keyboard&quot; switch above the keyboard was depressed, which would instantly switch text video from the US character set to the local set. The DVORAK keyboard layout was not available on international IIcs—the feature had been intended to switch between international keyboards; the DVORAK layout was merely added to give the switch a function on US IIcs. In some countries these localized IIcs also supported 50 Hz PAL video and the different 220/240-volt power of that region by means of a different external power supply — this was a very simple change, since the IIc had an internal 12-volt power converter. The international versions replaced any English legends printed on the case (specifically the &quot;keyboard&quot; toggle switch, &quot;Power&quot; and &quot;Disk Use&quot; drive-activity labels) with graphical icons that could be universally understood.

==Add-on accessories==

===Portability enhancements===

At the time of the Apple IIc&#x27;s release, Apple announced an optional black and white (1-bit) LCD screen designed specifically for the machine called the &quot;Apple Flat Panel Display&quot;. While it was welcomed as a means of making the IIc more portable, it did not integrate well as a portable solution, not attaching in a secure or permanent manner and not able to fold-over face down. Instead, it sat atop the machine and connected via ribbon cable to a somewhat bulky rear port connector. Its main shortcoming was that it suffered from a very poor contrast and no backlighting, making it very difficult to view without a strong external light source. The display itself had an odd aspect ratio as well, making graphics look vertically squashed. A third-party company would later introduce a work-alike LCD screen called the &quot;C-Vue&quot;, which looked and functioned very much like Apple&#x27;s product, albeit with a reportedly slight improvement in viewability. Consequently, both sold poorly and had a very short market life span, making these displays fairly uncommon (and as a result, extremely rare today).

Third parties also offered external rechargeable battery units for the Apple IIc (e.g. &quot;Prairie Power Portable System&quot; available from Roger Coats) with up to eight hours per charge or longer. Although they aided in making the machine more of a true portable, they were nonetheless bulky and heavy, and added more pieces that would have to be carried. Adapter cables were sold as well that allowed the Apple IIc to plug into an automobile&#x27;s DC power cigarette lighter.

To help transport the Apple IIc and its accessory pieces around, Apple sold a nylon carrying case with shoulder strap that had a compartment for the computer, its external power supply, and the cables. It had enough room to squeeze in one of the above-mentioned LCD display units. The case was grey in color with a stitched-on Apple logo in the upper right corner.

===Expansion capabilities===

While the Apple IIc had many built-in features to offer, many users wanted to extend the machine&#x27;s capabilities beyond what Apple provided. It proved difficult since the IIc was a closed system that initially was designed with no expansion capabilities in mind; however, many companies figured out ingenious ways of squeezing enhancements inside the tiny case. Real-time clocks, memory expansion, and coprocessors were popular, and some companies even managed to combine all three into a single add-on board. Typically, in order to add these options, key chips on the motherboard were pulled and moved onto the expansion board offering the new features, and the board was then placed into the empty sockets. While sometimes a tight squeeze, this trickery worked quite well, and most importantly of all offered users a way to expand memory—something Apple did not themselves support until the Memory Expansion IIc model was introduced.

Some companies devised a method for squeezing in an entire CPU accelerator product, by means of placing all the specialized circuitry (i.e. cache and logic) into one tall chip that outright replaced the 40-pin 65C02 microprocessor, speeding up the machine from 4–10 MHz. Notable examples are the Zip Chip and Rocket Chip.

Although the IIc lacked a SCSI or IDE interface, external hard drives were produced by third parties that connected through the floppy SmartPort as an innovative alternative connection method (e.g. &quot;ProApp&quot;, &quot;Chinook&quot;). While these specialized hard drives were relatively slow due to the nature of how data was transferred through this interface (designed primarily for floppy drives) they did allow for true mass storage. The &quot;CDrive&quot; however did mount internally and was very fast due to its direct connection to the CPU. Other innovations that used existing expansion ports led to add-on speech and music synthesis products by means of external devices that plugged into the IIc&#x27;s serial ports. Three popular such devices were the &quot;Mockingboard-D&quot;, &quot;Cricket&quot; and &quot;Echo IIc&quot;. Applied Engineering offered an ever increasing and improved line of &quot;Z-Ram&quot; internal memory expansion boards, which also included a Z-80 CPU for Apple CP/M software capability.

===General accessories===
For those wishing to use the Apple IIc as a standard desktop machine, Apple sold the Monitor IIc, a monochrome CRT display with an elevated stand. The Color Monitor IIc, a color composite monitor, followed in 1985. A mouse was another popular add-on, especially since it required no interface card, unlike earlier Apples, and simply plugged directly into the back of the machine (MousePaint, a clone of MacPaint, shipped with the IIc&#x27;s mouse). An external 5.25-inch floppy drive, matching the style of the IIc, was also made available. Later, 3.5-inch floppy storage became an option with the &quot;intelligent&quot; UniDisk 3.5 which contained its own miniature computer inside (CPU, RAM, firmware) to overcome the issue of using a high-speed floppy drive on a 1 MHz machine.

<text>James Alfred Van Allen (September 7, 1914August 9, 2006) was an American space physicist at the University of Iowa. He was instrumental in establishing the field of magnetospheric research in space.

The Van Allen radiation belts were named after him, following his discovery using Geiger–Müller tube instruments on the 1958 satellites (Explorer 1, Explorer 3, and Pioneer 3) during the International Geophysical Year. Van Allen led the scientific community in putting scientific research instruments on space satellites.

==Early years and education==
James Van Allen was born on September 7, 1914, on a small farm near Mount Pleasant, Iowa. As a child, he was fascinated by mechanical and electrical devices and was an avid reader of &quot;Popular Mechanics&quot; and &quot;Popular Science&quot; magazines. He once horrified his mother by constructing a Tesla coil that produced foot-long sparks and caused his hair to stand on end.

A fellowship allowed him to continue studying nuclear physics at the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C., where he also became immersed in research in geomagnetism, cosmic rays, auroral physics and the physics of Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere.

==World War II==
In August 1939, Van Allen joined the Department of Terrestrial Magnetism (DTM) of the Carnegie Institution in Washington, D.C. as a Carnegie Research Fellow. In the summer of 1940, he joined DTM&#x27;s national defense efforts with his appointment to a staff position in Section T with the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) in Washington, D.C., where he worked on the development of photoelectric and radio proximity fuzes, which are detonators that increase the effectiveness of anti-aircraft fire. Another NDRC project later became the atomic bomb Manhattan Project in 1941. With the outbreak of World War II, the proximity fuze work was transferred to the newly created Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) of Johns Hopkins University in April 1942. He worked on improving the ruggedness of vacuum tubes subject to the vibration from a gun battery. The work at APL resulted in a new generation of radio-proximity fuses for anti-aircraft defense of ships and for shore bombardment.

Van Allen was commissioned as a U.S. Navy lieutenant in November 1942 and served for 16 months on a succession of South Pacific Fleet destroyers, instructing gunnery officers and conducting tests on his artillery fuses. He was an assistant staff gunnery officer on the battleship USS Washington when the ship successfully defended itself against a Japanese attack during the Battle of the Philippine Sea, (June 19–20, 1944). For his actions at the Pacific, Van Allen was awarded four battle stars. He was promoted to lieutenant commander in 1946. &quot;My service as a naval officer was, far and away, the most broadening experience of my lifetime,&quot; he wrote in a 1990 autobiographical essay.

==1946–1954 Aerobee and &quot;Rockoon&quot;==
Discharged from the Navy in 1946, Van Allen returned to civilian research at APL. He organized and directed a team at Johns Hopkins University to conduct high-altitude experiments, using V-2 rockets captured from the Germans at the end of World War II. Van Allen decided a small sounding rocket was needed for upper atmosphere research. The Aerojet WAC Corporal and the Bumblebee missile were developed under a US Navy program. He drew specifications for the Aerobee sounding rocket and headed the committee that convinced the U.S. government to produce it. The first instrument-carrying Aerobee was the A-5, launched on March 5, 1948, from White Sands, New Mexico, carrying instruments for cosmic radiation research, reaching an altitude of 117.5 km.

Van Allen was elected chairman of the V-2 Upper Atmosphere Panel on December 29, 1947. The panel was renamed Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel on March 18, 1948; then Rocket and Satellite Research Panel on April 29, 1948. The panel suspended operations on May 19, 1960, and had a reunion on February 2, 1968.

Cmdr. Lee Lewis, Cmdr. G. Halvorson, S.F. Singer, and James A. Van Allen developed the idea for the Rockoon on March 1, 1949, during the Aerobee rocket firing cruise on the research vessel USS &quot;Norton Sound&quot;.

On April 5, 1950, Van Allen left the Applied Physics Laboratory, to accept a John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation research fellowship at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. The following year (1951) Van Allen accepted the position as head of the physics department at the University of Iowa. Before long, he was enlisting students in his efforts to discover the secrets of the wild blue yonder and inventing ways to carry instruments higher into the atmosphere than ever before. By 1952, Van Allen was the first to devise a balloon-rocket combination that lifted rockets on balloons high above most of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere before firing them even higher. The rockets were ignited after the balloons reached an altitude of 16 kilometers.
As &quot;Time&quot; magazine later reported, &quot;Van Allen’s ‘Rockoons’ could not be fired in Iowa for fear that the spent rockets would strike an Iowan or his house.&quot; So Van Allen convinced the U.S. Coast Guard to let him fire his Rockoons from the icebreaker &quot;Eastwind&quot; that was bound for Greenland. &quot;The first balloon rose properly to 70,000 ft., but the rocket hanging under it did not fire. The second Rockoon behaved in the same maddening way. On the theory that extreme cold at high altitude might have stopped the clockwork supposed to ignite the rockets, Van Allen heated cans of orange juice, smuggled them into the third Rockoon’s gondola, and wrapped the whole business in insulation. The rocket fired.&quot;

In 1953, the Rockoons and their science payloads fired off Newfoundland detected the first hint of radiation belts surrounding Earth. The low-cost Rockoon technique was later used by the Office of Naval Research and The University of Iowa research groups in 1953–1955 and 1957, from ships at sea between Boston and Thule, Greenland.

In 1954, in a private discussion about the Redstone project with Ernst Stuhlinger, Wernher von Braun expressed his belief that they should have a &quot;real, honest-to-goodness scientist&quot; involved in their little unofficial satellite project. Stuhlinger followed up with a visit to Van Allen at his home in Princeton, New Jersey, where Van Allen was on sabbatical leave from Iowa to work on stellarator design. Van Allen later recounted, &quot;Stuhlinger’s 1954 message was simple and eloquent. By virtue of ballistic missile developments at Army Ballistic Missile Agency (ABMA), it was realistic to expect that within a year or two a small scientific satellite could be propelled into a durable orbit around the earth (Project Orbiter)... I expressed a keen interest in performing a worldwide survey of the cosmic-ray intensity above the atmosphere.&quot;

==International Geophysical Year 1957–58==

In 1955, the U.S. announced Project Vanguard as part of the US contribution to the International Geophysical Year. Vanguard planned to launch an artificial satellite into an orbit around the Earth. It was to be run by the US Navy and developed from sounding rockets, which had the advantage of being primarily used for non-military scientific experiments.

A symposium on &quot;The Scientific Uses of Earth Satellites&quot; was held on January 26 and 27, 1956 at the University of Michigan under sponsorship of the Upper Atmosphere Rocket Research Panel, chaired by Dr. Van Allen. 33 scientific proposals were presented for inclusion in the IGY satellites. Van Allen&#x27;s presentation highlighted the use of satellites for continuing cosmic-ray investigations. At this same time his Iowa Group began preparations for scientific research instruments to be carried by &#x27;Rockoons&#x27; and Vanguard for the International Geophysical Year. Through &quot;preparedness and good fortune,&quot; as he later wrote, those scientific instruments were available for incorporation in the 1958 Explorer and Pioneer IGY launches.

* July 1, 1957: The International Geophysical Year begins. IGY is carried out by the International Council of Scientific Unions, over an 18-month period selected to match the period of maximum solar activity (e.g. sunspots). Lloyd Berkner, one of the scientists at the April 5, 1950, Silver Spring, Maryland meeting in Van Allen&#x27;s home, serves as president of the ICSU from 1957 to 1959.
* September 26, 1957: Thirty-six Rockoons (balloon-launched rockets) were launched from Navy icebreaker USS &quot;Glacier&quot; in Atlantic, Pacific, and Antarctic areas ranging from 75° N. to 72° S. latitude, as part of the U.S. International Geophysical Year scientific program headed by Van Allen and Lawrence J. Cahill of The University of Iowa. These were the first known upper atmosphere rocket soundings in the Antarctic area. Launched from IGY Rockoon Launch Site 2, Atlantic Ocean; Latitude: 0.83° N, Longitude: 0.99° W.
* October 4, 1957: The Soviet Union (USSR) successfully launches Sputnik 1, the world&#x27;s first artificial satellite, as part of their participation in the IGY.

* January 31, 1958: The first American satellite, Explorer 1, was launched into Earth orbit on a Juno I four-stage booster rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida. Aboard Explorer 1 were a micrometeorite detector and a cosmic ray experiment designed by Van Allen and his graduate students, with the satellite deployment of the sensor package supervised by Ernst Stuhlinger, who also had an expert cosmic ray background. Data from Explorer 1 and Explorer 3 (launched March 26, 1958) were used by the Iowa group to make &quot;the first space-age scientific discovery&quot;: &quot;the existence of a doughnut-shaped region of charged particle radiation trapped by the Earth’s magnetic field&quot;.
* July 29, 1958: United States Congress passed the National Aeronautics and Space Act (commonly called the &quot;Space Act&quot;), which created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) as of October 1, 1958, from the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) and other government agencies.
* December 6, 1958: Pioneer 3, the third intended U.S. International Geophysical Year probe under the direction of NASA with the Army acting as executive agent, was launched from the Atlantic Missile Range by a Juno II rocket. The primary objective of the flight, to place the 12.95 pound (5.87 kg) scientific payload in the vicinity of the Moon, failed. Pioneer III did reach an altitude of 63,000 miles (101 000 km), providing Van Allen additional data that led to discovery of a second radiation belt. Trapped radiation starts at an altitude of several hundred miles from Earth and extends for several thousand miles into space. The Van Allen radiation belts are named after Van Allen, their discoverer.

==Pioneer of space science and exploration==

The May 4, 1959, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine credited James Van Allen as the man most responsible for giving the U.S. &quot;a big lead in scientific achievement.&quot; They called Van Allen &quot;a key figure in the cold war’s competition for prestige. ... Today he can tip back his head and look at the sky. Beyond its outermost blue are the world-encompassing belts of fierce radiation that bear his name. No human name has ever been given to a more majestic feature of the planet Earth.&quot;

James Van Allen, his colleagues, associates and students at The University of Iowa continued to fly scientific instruments on sounding rockets, Earth satellites (Explorer 52 / Hawkeye 1), and interplanetary spacecraft including the first missions (Pioneer program, Mariner program, Voyager program, &quot;Galileo&quot; spacecraft) to the planets Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Their discoveries contributed important segments to the world&#x27;s knowledge of energetic particles, plasmas and radio waves throughout the Solar System.

Van Allen was the principal investigator for scientific investigations on 24 Earth satellites and planetary missions.

==Professor emeritus==
Van Allen stepped down as the head of the department of physics and astronomy in 1985, but continued working at the University of Iowa as the Carver Professor of Physics, emeritus. On October 9, 2004, the University of Iowa and the UI Alumni Association hosted a celebration to honor Van Allen and his many accomplishments, and in recognition of his 90th birthday. Activities included an invited lecture series, a public lecture followed by a cake and punch reception, and an evening banquet with many of his former colleagues and students in attendance. In August 2005, an elementary school bearing his name opened in North Liberty, Iowa. There is also a Van Allen elementary school in Escalon, CA.

In 2009, Van Allen&#x27;s boyhood home in Mt. Pleasant, once maintained as a museum, was slated to be demolished. The new owner, Lee Pennebaker, chose not to demolish the home. It was donated to the Henry County Heritage Trust, which plans to move the house next to the old Saunders School which will be the home of the Henry County museum.

==Personal life and death==
Van Allen&#x27;s wife of 61 years was Abigail Fithian Halsey II of Cincinnati (1922–2008). They met at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL) during World War II. They were married October 13, 1945, in Southampton, Long Island. Their five children are Cynthia, Margot, Sarah, Thomas, and Peter.

On August 9, 2006, James Van Allen died at University Hospitals in Iowa City from heart failure.

Professor Van Allen and his wife Abigail are buried in Southampton, New York, where Mrs. Van Allen was born and the couple were married.

Abigail M. Foerstner wrote a biography &quot;James van Allen: The First Eight Billion Miles&quot;, published by University of Iowa Press in 2007 with a paperback edition in 2009.

===Van Allen Probes mission===
The Van Allen Probes, initially the Radiation Belt Storm Probes (RBSP), were renamed in 2012 in honor of Dr. Van Allen. Managed by NASA&#x27;s Goddard Space Flight Center and implemented by the Applied Physics Laboratory (APL) at Johns Hopkins University, the mission was a part of the Living With a Star program. Designed for a two-year primary mission, the probes exceeded expectations by operating for seven years, demonstrating significant resilience against radiation in Earth&#x27;s belts.

In collaboration with the Balloon Array for RBSP Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL), the probes studied particles from the belts reaching Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Launched on August 30, 2012, aboard an Atlas V 401 rocket contracted to United Launch Alliance (ULA), the mission was initially delayed due to weather and Hurricane Isaac.

The mission concluded with the deactivation of Van Allen Probe B in July 2019 and Probe A in October 2019, following the lowering of their orbits to facilitate atmospheric reentry by 2034 as a measure against orbital debris.

The Van Allen Probes significantly advanced the understanding of space weather and its impact on Earth. Key discoveries included the dynamics of the Van Allen radiation belts and the role of solar activity in influencing space weather. The mission&#x27;s findings highlighted how these radiation belts swell and shrink over time, responding to solar eruptions and impacting terrestrial phenomena like auroras, satellite functionality, power grids, and GPS communications.

A notable discovery in February 2013 was the transient appearance of a third Van Allen Radiation Belt, which lasted a few weeks and provided new insights into the belts&#x27; structure and dynamics. The probes also revealed the long-term behavior of Earth&#x27;s ring current, a major component of the magnetosphere. Findings indicated a persistent, substantial ring current around Earth even during non-storm times, carried by high-energy protons. During geomagnetic storms, the enhancement of the ring current was shown to be due to low-energy protons entering the near-Earth region, challenging previous understandings.

===NASA BARREL mission===
Eighty years after the Second Byrd Expedition, the Balloon Array for RBSP Relativistic Electron Losses (BARREL), a NASA mission began to study Earth&#x27;s Van Allen radiation belts at the Antarctic (South Pole) managed by Dartmouth College. BARREL launched 20 balloons from Antarctica during each of two balloon campaigns in January–February 2013 and December 2013 – February 2014. This scientific data will complement the Van Allen Probes data over the two-year mission.

<doc id="255295" wikidata="Q1416101" url="?curid=255295" title="Finale (scorewriter)">
<text>Finale is a discontinued proprietary music notation software developed and released by MakeMusic for Microsoft Windows and macOS from 1988 until the 27th of August 2024, when it was discontinued.

==Functionality==
Finale&#x27;s tools are organized into multiple hierarchically organized palettes, and the corresponding tool is selected to add or edit any particular class of score element. Voices are available in Finale as well. Several of Finale&#x27;s tools provide an associated menu just to the left of the Help menu, available only when that particular tool is selected. 

On the screen, Finale provides the ability to color code several elements of the score as a visual aid; on the print-out, all score elements are black (unless color print-out is explicitly chosen). With the corresponding tool selected, fine adjustment of each set of objects in a score is possible either by clicking and dragging or by entering measurements in a dialog box. A more generalized selection tool is also available to select large measure regions for editing key and time signatures or transposing, among other uses. This tool also provides the ability to reposition several classes of score objects directly, and more recent versions of the software have implemented extensive contextual meaning via this tool.

Finale automatically manages many of the basic rules of harmony and music notation, such as correct beaming, stem direction, vertical alignment of multiple rhythmic values, and established rules for positioning note heads on chords. In other situations, without advance user customization, the program makes what can be described as &quot;a good guess&quot;, especially in the area of enharmonic spelling of newly entered data generated from a MIDI keyboard, while respecting the current key signature.

Finale is capable of notating various music such as chorales or cut-out scores including new symbols invented by the composer. It has a built-in working guitar tablature system and includes a jazz font similar to that used in the &quot;Real Book&quot;. Nearly all elements in the score can be adjusted and moved.

Music can be entered using a keyboard or using the software itself. It also includes a function for optically recognizing printed music from a scan. From &quot;Finale 2001&quot; onward, the program included MicNotator, a module able to notate melodic pitches played on a single-pitch acoustic instrument via a microphone connected to the computer.

&quot;Finale 2004&quot; introduced FinaleScript, a scripting language for the automation of repetitive tasks.

== History ==
The first version of Finale was made by Phil Farrand and John Borowicz. They wrote the original version software for &quot;Coda Music Software&quot;, which was later sold to Net4Music and then became MakeMusic. After Finale version 3.7, Finale&#x27;s marketers made the switch to years as identifiers for each new release, starting with &quot;Finale 97&quot;.

&quot;Finale 2004&quot;, released in early 2004, was the first release to run natively on Macintosh computers running Mac OS X Panther. This was considered a late release by MakeMusic, and full support for the features of Mac OS X was limited at first. More comprehensive support was brought &quot;on-line&quot; through maintenance releases going forward into 2004. Finale 2004 also continued to support PowerPC Macs running Mac OS 9. This release shortened the development cycle for Finale 2005, which was released the following August. While the number of new features in Finale &#x27;05 were necessarily limited, this was the first release to have both Windows and Mac versions on the same distribution CD.

&quot;Finale 2006&quot; (released in the summer of 2005) included the Garritan Personal Orchestra, an integrated sound library. A limited-functionality music-scanning module, SmartScore Lite, was also included. Along with Page View and Scroll View, the 2006 release added StudioView, a display mode which is similar to Scroll View with the addition of a sequencer interface. This feature gave users an environment for creation, evaluation, and experimentation with different musical ideas in a multi-track environment. In StudioView, an additional staff appears above the notation, called TempoTap, allowing for complete control over tempo changes.

&quot;Finale 2007&quot; was released with a &quot;linked&quot; score and part management system. A properly set-up &quot;full score for extraction&quot; could now contain all the data and formatting necessary to generate a full set of linked ensemble parts, ensconced within a single Finale master document. Limitations on the scope of format and layout control between parts and conductor score (including measure numbers and staff system breaks) suggested that this new feature was targeted to media production work, where quick turnaround and accuracy is a crucial factor, rather than publishing, though publishers still may use some aspects of linked parts to improve the part creation process. Finale 2007 introduced linked parts, which allow ensemble parts to remain linked to the master score.

&quot;Finale 2008&quot; was the first version to come out with full Vista (32-bit only) support. It also changed the way several editing modes are accessed, by introducing the multi-purpose &quot;selection tool&quot; described above. The 2008 release offers the importation and/or recording of synchronized real-time audio as an additional single track in a document.

&quot;Finale 2009&quot; was identified as the 20th Anniversary edition. It offers many fundamental workflow changes not seen since the program&#x27;s inception, such as the organization of expressions by category. Also notable is the re-designed Page View, which enables the viewing and editing of multiple pages within the same document window: these pages may either be arranged in a horizontal line or tiled vertically within a window. Finale 2009 includes Garritan&#x27;s new Aria Player Engine, and has new samples for this. The older Kontakt 2 Player is still supported, and the samples load under this also.

&quot;Finale 2010&quot; was released in June 2009 with improvements to percussion notation and chord symbols. This version also introduced measure number enhancements, auto-ordered rehearsal marks and support for additional graphic formats.

&quot;Finale 2011&quot; was released in June 2010 with additional Garritan Sounds, Alpha Notes (notation with note names inside), a new lyric entry window and other lyric enhancements, and a reworking of staff, system, and page layout handling. Introduced the new &quot;Hide Empty Staves&quot; command under the Staff menu, which hides all empty staves in systems. If notes are added to the system, the staff reappears automatically. (The capability of intentionally hiding staves containing notes is still available using a Staff Style). Other improvements to this Finale version include easier capo chords and a new Aria Player.

&quot;Finale 2012&quot; was released in October 2011 with new functions as Finale&#x27;s ScoreManager, Unicode text support, creation of PDF files, an updated setup Wizard, improved sound management.

In 2013, MakeMusic signed an agreement with Alfred Music. Under this agreement, Alfred Music became the sole distributor of Finale and Garritan products.

&quot;Finale 2014&quot; was released in November 2013 with new functions. As with all previous releases, a new file format was introduced, which is incompatible with older versions of Finale. However, this time easier file exchange with future versions of Finale was promised. Finale 2014&#x27;s new functions include a rewritten file format for forward and backward file compatibility, improved Apple OS X support, a new audio engine, additional Garritan sounds, and a new user interface. 2014d is the last version. An updated version, &quot;Finale 2014.5&quot; fixes several problems.

&quot;Finale Version 25&quot; was released on August 16, 2016. Some new features include: ReWire support, so that Finale can be used simultaneously and in sync with digital audio software. The new &quot;Aria Player&quot; speeds up and simplifies the choosing of Garritan instruments. Beginning with this version, the user manual is found entirely online. Band-in-a-Box and a couple of other plug-ins were removed. The ability to import scanned documents was removed. Several other features were added.

&quot;Finale Version 26&quot; was released on October 10, 2018. This release includes new features such as automatically stacking articulations, automated slur collision avoidance, expedited processes for entering chord symbols and expressions, and additional templates.

&quot;Finale Version 27&quot; was released on June 15, 2021. This release includes new features like interactive music sharing functionality, Standard Music Font Layout (SMuFL) support, an improved instrument list, MusicXML 4.0, and numerous bug fixes.

On August 26, 2024, Greg Dell&#x27;Era, president of MakeMusic, announced that the software would no longer be developed or sold, and that support would end one year from the announcement date. A partnership with Dorico&#x27;s developer, Steinberg, was also announced as an alternative for Finale users.

<doc id="255296" wikidata="Q1141614" url="?curid=255296" title="Battle of Xiaoting">
<text>The Battle of Xiaoting (猇亭之戰), also known as the Battle of Yiling and the Battle of Yiling and Xiaoting, was fought between the state of Shu and the state of Wu, between the years 221 and 222 in the early Three Kingdoms period of China. The battle is significant because Wu was able to turn the situation from a series of initial losses into a defensive stalemate, before proceeding to win a decisive victory over Shu. The Wu victory halted the Shu invasion and preceded the death of Liu Bei, Shu&#x27;s founding emperor.

==Background==
In late 219, Lü Meng, a general serving under Sun Quan, led an army to invade Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in southern Jing Province. Guan Yu, Liu Bei&#x27;s general in charge of guarding Jing Province, was away at the Battle of Fancheng and did not know about the invasion until after he returned from his Pyrrhic victory at Fancheng. He was surrounded by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in Maicheng (麥城; in Dangyang, Hubei), captured in an ambush while trying to break out of the siege, and eventually executed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in Linju (臨沮; present-day Nanzhang County, Hubei).

On 25 November 220, Emperor Xian, the figurehead monarch of the Eastern Han dynasty, abdicated in favour of Cao Pi and ended the Eastern Han dynasty. On 11 December, Cao Pi established the state of Wei to replace the Eastern Han dynasty and became its first emperor. On 10 May 221, Liu Bei declared himself emperor and established a new state, historically known as Shu, to contest Cao Pi&#x27;s claim to the Han throne. Around the same time, Sun Quan shifted the capital of his territories from Gong&#x27;an County to E County, which he renamed &quot;Wuchang&quot; (). On 23 September 221, Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi and became a vassal of the Wei state; in return, Cao Pi awarded Sun Quan the title &quot;King of Wu&quot; ().

==Prelude==
Liu Bei desired to avenge Guan Yu and take back Jing Province, so he made preparations for war against Sun Quan. When Zhao Yun, a veteran general under Liu Bei, tried to dissuade his lord from going to war with Sun Quan, Liu Bei ignored him. Later, when Liu Bei launched the campaign against Sun Quan, he did not bring Zhao Yun along and instead left him behind to guard Jiangzhou. Qin Mi, an official under Liu Bei, also advised his lord against going to war with Sun Quan but ended up being thrown into prison.

Liu Bei ordered Zhang Fei to lead 10,000 troops from Langzhong to join him at Jiangzhou. During the mobilisation, Zhang Fei was assassinated by his subordinates Fan Qiang () and Zhang Da (), who cut off his head and brought it along with them as they defected to Sun Quan&#x27;s side. Zhang Fei&#x27;s adjutant wrote a report to Liu Bei. When Liu Bei heard that Zhang Fei&#x27;s adjutant sent him a report, he exclaimed: &quot;Oh! (Zhang) Fei is dead.&quot;

In August 221, Liu Bei personally led his army to attack Sun Quan. He also gave higher appointments to some mid-ranking Shu officers from Jing Province, such as Feng Xi and Zhang Nan, to further raise his army&#x27;s morale for the campaign. Sun Quan sent Zhuge Jin as his representative to meet Liu Bei and start peace talks. When Zhuge Jin met Liu Bei, he said: Liu Bei refused to listen to him.

==Battle==
===Opening moves===
In August 221, Liu Bei sent his generals Wu Ban and Feng Xi to attack the Wu positions at the Wu Gorge, which were guarded by Li Yi () and Liu E (). After Wu Ban and Feng Xi achieved success, the Shu army, comprising over 40,000 troops, advanced further to Zigui County. Liu Bei also sent messengers to request reinforcements from the local tribes in Wuling Commandery (武陵郡). At Zigui, Liu Bei met up with Liao Hua, a former subordinate of Guan Yu. Liao Hua had become a prisoner-of-war in Wu after Guan Yu&#x27;s death, but managed to escape and make his way back to Shu. Liu Bei appointed him as the Administrator of Yidu.

In response to the Shu invasion, Sun Quan appointed Lu Xun as his Grand Chief Controller () and ordered him to lead 50,000 troops to resist the enemy. Lu Xun had under his command several Wu officers such as Zhu Ran, Pan Zhang, Song Qian, Han Dang, Xu Sheng, Xianyu Dan (), and Sun Huan.

===Shu army&#x27;s approach===
In February 222, Liu Bei planned to lead his army from Zigui (秭歸) further into Jing Province to reclaim the province. However, the Shu general Huang Quan noted that the Wu forces were powerful and had used the Yangtze to their advantage, so he volunteered to lead the attack and suggested that Liu Bei remain behind as backup. Liu Bei refused to listen to him, appointed him as General Who Guards the North (), and put him in charge of a separate Shu army to defend the northern flank (the northern bank of the Yangtze) from any possible attack by Wei forces. He then personally led the main Shu army, which travelled along the southern bank of the Yangtze.

Liu Bei also ordered Wu Ban (吳班) and Chen Shi (陳式) to lead the Shu navy to Yiling on the banks of the Yangtze. In the meantime, he also sent Ma Liang as an envoy to meet the tribes in Wuling Commandery and seek to bribe their chiefs with money and official titles to win their support. As the tribes in Wuling grew restless upon the Shu army&#x27;s approach, Sun Quan sent Bu Zhi to guard Yiyang and deal with any unrest.

When Wu generals wanted to attack the Shu army as it approached, Lu Xun objected and said: The Wu generals did not understand Lu Xun&#x27;s reasoning and thought that he feared the enemy so they were very unhappy with him.

===Stalemate===
The Shu army passed through the Wu Gorge, Jianping (), Lianping (), and Lianwei (), and arrived at the border of Yiling, where they constructed about 10 fortified garrisons. Liu Bei appointed Feng Xi as the Grand Controller (), Zhang Nan as the vanguard commander (), and Fu Kuang, Zhao Rong (), Liao Hua, and Fu Rong as detachment commanders (). The Shu and Wu forces were locked in a stalemate for about six months from February to July 222.

Liu Bei ordered Wu Ban to lead a few thousand soldiers out of the mountainous regions to set up camps on flat terrain and provoke the Wu forces to attack them. When the Wu officers wanted to respond to the taunts and attack the enemy, Lu Xun said: &quot;This must be a trick. We should observe first.&quot;

As Lu Xun suspected, there were actually 8,000 Shu troops waiting in ambush in the nearby valleys. Since the Wu forces did not respond to the taunts, Liu Bei abandoned his plan to lure the enemy into the ambush and ordered the 8,000 soldiers to come out of the valleys. When Lu Xun heard about it, he told the Wu officers: &quot;The reason why I did not follow your suggestions to attack the enemy is because I suspected there was something fishy about it.&quot; He then wrote a memorial to Sun Quan to emphasize the strategic importance of Yiling, point out some of Liu Bei&#x27;s weaknesses, and reassure Sun Quan that he would defeat the enemy.

===Wu counter-attack and the burning of the Shu camps===
Several days later, the Wu officers told Lu Xun: Lu Xun replied: 

Lu Xun then targeted one enemy camp and attacked it but failed to capture it. The Wu officers complained: &quot;We are sacrificing our soldiers&#x27; lives for nothing.&quot; Lu Xun replied: &quot;I have devised a strategy for defeating the enemy.&quot; He then ordered his men to carry a pile of straw each and launch a fire attack on the enemy. Upon the commencement of the fire attack, Lu Xun led all the Wu units on an all-out assault on the Shu forces. Zhu Ran defeated the Shu vanguard force, cut off its retreat route and forced Liu Bei to retreat. Pan Zhang&#x27;s subordinates killed Feng Xi and inflicted heavy casualties on Feng&#x27;s unit. Song Qian also destroyed five Shu garrisons and killed its defending officers. Zhang Nan, Shamoke (a tribal king allied with Shu), Ma Liang, and Wang Fu were killed in action, while Du Lu () and Liu Ning () were forced to surrender to Wu. Over 40 Shu camps were destroyed by the Wu forces. Throughout the Shu army, only Xiang Chong&#x27;s unit managed to retreat without sustaining any losses.

The actual location of the battle is at the juncture between the west of Yidu County and east of Changyang County in Yichang, Hubei.

===Liu Bei&#x27;s retreat to Baidicheng===
Liu Bei and his remaining troops retreated to the Ma&#x27;an Hills (馬鞍山; east of present-day Changyang County, Hubei), where they continued to be fiercely assaulted by the Wu forces from all directions. At the same time, landslides occurred at the Ma&#x27;an Hills and caused the Shu forces to sustain thousands of casualties. The Wu general Sun Huan fought with his life and managed to break through enemy lines and capture the key positions in the hills. Liu Bei was forced to retreat through the hazardous mountainous terrain and barely escaped alive at night. During the retreat, he ordered his men to pile up their armour and set them on fire to create barriers for the pursuing Wu forces.

Liu Bei regrouped his scattered forces and ordered them to abandon their boats and travel on foot towards Yufu County, which he renamed &quot;Yong&#x27;an&quot; (永安; literally &quot;everlasting peace&quot;). The Wu officers Li Yi () and Liu E () led their troops in pursuit of Liu Bei and garrisoned at Nanshan (). In late September or early October 222, Liu Bei and his forces retreated further to the Wu Gorge.

By the time Liu Bei reached the safety of Baidicheng, all his boats, military equipment, and supplies had been captured by Wu forces. The dead bodies of Shu soldiers floated in the river and obstructed its flow. Liu Bei was extremely upset and furious with his defeat. He exclaimed: &quot;Is it not the will of Heaven that I must be humiliated by Lu Xun?&quot; When Zhao Yun showed up at Yong&#x27;an with reinforcements from Jiangzhou, the pursuing Wu forces had already retreated on their own.

==Incidents during the battle==

===Lu Xun refusing to help Sun Huan===
In the earlier stages of the battle, Sun Huan led a separate force to attack the Shu vanguard force at Yidao but ended up being besieged by the enemy. He requested for reinforcements from Lu Xun but was denied. The other Wu officers told Lu Xun: &quot;General Sun is a relative of our lord. He is currently under siege, so shouldn&#x27;t we help him?&quot; Lu Xun replied: &quot;He has the support of his men, his base is well defended, and he has sufficient supplies. There is nothing to worry about. When my plans are in motion, even if we don&#x27;t help him, the siege on him will automatically be lifted.&quot; After the Wu victory at Xiaoting, Sun Huan came to see Lu Xun and said: &quot;Earlier on, I was indeed very resentful when you refused to help me. But now, after the victory, I see that you have your own way of doing things.&quot;

===Wu officers&#x27; reluctance to follow Lu Xun&#x27;s orders===
Many of the Wu officers who participated in the battle had either served in Wu since Sun Ce&#x27;s time or were relatives of Sun Quan&#x27;s family, so they viewed themselves highly and were unwilling to follow Lu Xun&#x27;s orders. Lu Xun placed his sword on the desk and said: 

The Wu officers began to show greater respect for Lu Xun after the Wu victory, which was largely due to his strategies. Lu Xun did not report this incident to Sun Quan, who found out about it himself after the battle. When Sun Quan asked Lu Xun about it, Lu replied that he valued those officers even though they were insubordinate towards him, and decided to put up with them because he felt it was important to maintain good working relationships with them to fulfil their common goal of resisting the Shu invasion. Sun Quan praised him and rewarded him handsomely.

===Heroics of Fu Rong and Cheng Ji===
Fu Rong volunteered to cover the rear while the Shu forces were retreating from Yiling and Xiaoting. He continued to hold his ground firmly and vent his fury on the enemy even though all his comrades had already been killed. When the Wu soldiers called for him to surrender, he replied: &quot;Dogs of Wu! Do you think a Han officer will ever surrender?&quot; He was eventually killed in action.

Cheng Ji also covered the rear during the Shu retreat. As the enemy approached, someone urged him to abandon his boat and escape, but he replied: &quot;I have never fled from battle throughout my military career. Besides, the Emperor is currently in a dangerous situation.&quot; When the Wu forces showed up, Cheng Ji wielded a &quot;ji&quot;, fought fiercely and managed to sink some enemy boats before he was eventually overwhelmed by the enemy and killed.

===Cao Pi foreseeing Liu Bei&#x27;s defeat===
When Cao Pi received news that the Shu forces had set up linked camps over a distance of more than 700 &quot;li&quot;, he told his subjects: He received a report about the Wu victory seven days later.

==Aftermath==
Huang Quan and the separate Shu army on the northern bank of the Yangtze were cut off from the main Shu army during the Wu counterattack and could not return to Shu. In desperation, Huang Quan and his subordinate Pang Lin led their troops to defect to Wei.

Small rebellions broke out in Lingling (零陵) and Guiyang (桂陽) commanderies after the Shu forces retreated. Bu Zhi, who was stationed at Yiyang before the battle, led Wu forces to suppress them.

After the battle, Xu Sheng, Pan Zhang, Song Qian and other Wu officers suggested attacking Baidicheng to capture Liu Bei. When Sun Quan asked Lu Xun for his opinion, Lu Xun, Zhu Ran and Luo Tong said that when Cao Pi amassed his forces and seemed like he was going to help Wu attack Shu, he actually had sinister intentions. They cautioned Sun Quan about this and suggested to abandon their pursuit of Liu Bei and return to Wu. Sun Quan heeded their advice. Not long later, Cao Pi led the Wei armies to invade Wu from three directions.

When Liu Bei heard of the Wei invasion of Wu, he wrote to Lu Xun: Lu Xun replied: 

Liu Bei became critically ill in April 223. Before he died on 10 June, he named his son Liu Shan as his successor and appointed Zhuge Liang and Li Yan as regents to assist Liu Shan. After taking over the reins of power, Zhuge Liang made peace with Wu and re-established the Wu–Shu alliance against Wei.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==
The events before, during, and after the Battle of Xiaoting are mentioned in chapters 81–84 of the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguo Yanyi&quot;) by Luo Guanzhong. Some fictitious stories were included and actual events were exaggerated for dramatic effect. The following are some notable events related to the battle, as described in the novel:

===Opposition to Liu Bei&#x27;s decision to go to war===
Liu Bei plans to go to war with Sun Quan to avenge Guan Yu and retake Jing Province, but his decision is opposed by many of his subjects. The first person who attempts to dissuade him from going to war is Zhao Yun, who is ignored. After that, other Shu officials such as Ma Liang and Chen Zhen urge Zhuge Liang to stop Liu Bei, so Zhuge Liang brings them along to meet Liu Bei and advise him against his decision, but Liu Bei refuses to accept their advice. Just when Liu Bei is preparing for war, Qin Mi opposes his decision. Liu Bei is so angry that he wants to execute Qin Mi. However, Qin Mi is spared after Zhuge Liang and the rest of the Shu imperial court plead with Liu Bei. Zhuge Liang then writes a memorial to Liu Bei to explain why he should not go to war with Sun Quan, but Liu Bei throws the memorial to the ground after reading it and exclaims, &quot;My decision is final. There is no need to advise me against my decision anymore!&quot;

;Historicity
The historical text &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; did not mention anything about Zhuge Liang opposing Liu Bei&#x27;s decision to go to war with Sun Quan. However, it did mention that Zhao Yun and Qin Mi attempted to dissuade Liu Bei: Zhao Yun advised Liu Bei against attacking Sun Quan, but was ignored. Qin Mi was imprisoned by Liu Bei when he advised him against the campaign, but was released later.

===Huang Zhong&#x27;s death===
The Shu general Huang Zhong participates in the campaign even though he is already over 70 years old at the time. He slays Pan Zhang&#x27;s subordinate, Shi Ji (), and defeats Pan Zhang in an engagement on the first day. On the second day, while pursuing the retreating Pan Zhang, he falls into an ambush and is surrounded by Zhou Tai, Han Dang, Ling Tong and Pan Zhang. He is hit by an arrow fired by Ma Zhong (). Guan Xing and Zhang Bao save him, but he dies from his wound that night. Liu Bei mourns his death. Since the Battle of Xiaoting historically took place between 221 and 222, going by the novel&#x27;s account, Huang Zhong&#x27;s year of death should be around 221–222.

;Historicity
Huang Zhong&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; stated that Huang Zhong died in 220, a year after the Hanzhong Campaign ended. His cause of death is unknown.

===Guan Xing killing Pan Zhang===
In one of the early engagements, Guan Xing encounters Pan Zhang, whose deputy Ma Zhong (馬忠) captured his father Guan Yu in an ambush during the Battle of Maicheng. In his eagerness to avenge his father, Guan Xing pursues Pan Zhang into a valley but loses his way inside. After nightfall, Guan Xing wanders around until he finds a house inhabited by an old man and stays there for the night. He sees his father&#x27;s portrait on the wall in the house. Later that night, Pan Zhang also finds his way to the house and asks to stay there. Guan Xing sees Pan Zhang and shouts at him. Just as Pan Zhang is about to leave, he encounters Guan Yu&#x27;s ghost and is petrified. Guan Xing catches up with Pan Zhang, kills him, digs out his heart and places it on the altar as an offering to his father&#x27;s spirit.

;Historicity
Pan Zhang&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; stated that he died in 234 – more than 10 years after the Battle of Xiaoting. His cause of death is unknown. Guan Yu&#x27;s biography mentioned that Guan Xing served as a civil official in Shu after reaching adulthood (around the age of 19) and died a few years later while in office, so Guan Xing was most probably not involved in the battle.

===Gan Ning&#x27;s death===
Gan Ning is down with dysentery around the time of the Battle of Xiaoting, but he still participates in the battle regardless of his illness. He is resting when he hears enemy forces approaching, so he quickly mounts his horse and prepares for battle. He encounters a group of tribal warriors led by Shamoke. He sees that the enemy force is too large and decides to withdraw. While retreating on horseback, Gan Ning is hit in the head by an arrow fired by Shamoke. He flees, with the arrow still embedded in his head, reaches Fuchi (富池; in present-day Yangxin County, Hubei), sits down under a tree and dies. Dozens of crows on the tree fly around his body. When Sun Quan learns of Gan Ning&#x27;s death, he is deeply saddened and gives orders for Gan to be buried with full honours.

;Historicity
No details were provided on Gan Ning&#x27;s cause and time of death in his biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;. Gan Ning&#x27;s death was briefly stated as follows: When Gan Ning died, Sun Quan deeply lamented his death.

===Zhao Yun killing Zhu Ran===
Liu Bei retreats under the protection of Guan Xing and Zhang Bao after his camps are set on fire by the Wu forces, who continue to pursue him. At a critical moment, Zhao Yun shows up and blocks the attacks from the enemy. Zhao Yun encounters Zhu Ran during the battle and kills him. He protects Liu Bei while the latter heads towards Baidicheng.

;Historicity
The &quot;Zhao Yun Biezhuan&quot; stated that Zhao Yun did not participate in the Battle of Xiaoting. Before the battle, Zhao Yun advised Liu Bei against going to war with Sun Quan but was ignored. Liu Bei ordered him to remain behind and guard Jiangzhou. When Zhao Yun learnt that Liu Bei had been defeated at Zigui, he led troops from Jiangzhou to Yong&#x27;an to help his lord.

Zhu Ran&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; stated that he died in 249 at the age of 68 (by East Asian age reckoning) – about 27 years after the Battle of Xiaoting. Besides, he outlived Zhao Yun, who historically died in 229.

===Lady Sun&#x27;s death===
News of Liu Bei&#x27;s defeat in the battle reached his ex-wife Lady Sun, who had returned to Wu. After hearing rumours that Liu Bei had been killed in battle, Lady Sun ventured out to the bank of the Yangtze, where she faced the west and wept before drowning herself.

;Historicity
Nothing was recorded in history about what happened to Lady Sun after she left Liu Bei and returned to Wu territory.

<text>A coronal mass ejection (CME) is a significant ejection of plasma mass from the Sun&#x27;s corona into the heliosphere. CMEs are often associated with solar flares and other forms of solar activity, but a broadly accepted theoretical understanding of these relationships has not been established.

If a CME enters interplanetary space, it is referred to as an interplanetary coronal mass ejection (ICME). ICMEs are capable of reaching and colliding with Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, where they can cause geomagnetic storms, aurorae, and in rare cases damage to electrical power grids. The largest recorded geomagnetic perturbation, resulting presumably from a CME, was the solar storm of 1859. Also known as the Carrington Event, it disabled parts of the newly created United States telegraph network, starting fires and electrically shocking some telegraph operators.

Near solar maxima, the Sun produces about three CMEs every day, whereas near solar minima, there is about one CME every five days.

==Physical description==
CMEs release large quantities of matter from the Sun&#x27;s atmosphere into the solar wind and interplanetary space. The ejected matter is a plasma consisting primarily of electrons and protons embedded within its magnetic field. This magnetic field is commonly in the form of a flux rope, a helical magnetic field with changing pitch angles.

The average mass ejected is . However, the estimated mass values for CMEs are only lower limits, because coronagraph measurements provide only two-dimensional data.

CMEs erupt from strongly twisted or sheared, large-scale magnetic field structures in the corona that are kept in equilibrium by overlying magnetic fields.

===Origin===
CMEs erupt from the lower corona, where processes associated with the local magnetic field dominate over other processes. As a result, the coronal magnetic field plays an important role in the formation and eruption of CMEs. Pre-eruption structures originate from magnetic fields that are initially generated in the Sun&#x27;s interior by the solar dynamo. These magnetic fields rise to the Sun&#x27;s surface—the photosphere—where they may form localized areas of highly concentrated magnetic flux and expand into the lower solar atmosphere forming active regions. At the photosphere, active region magnetic flux is often distributed in a dipole configuration, that is, with two adjacent areas of opposite magnetic polarity across which the magnetic field arches. Over time, the concentrated magnetic flux cancels and disperses across the Sun&#x27;s surface, merging with the remnants of past active regions to become a part of the quiet Sun. Pre-eruption CME structures can be present at different stages of the growth and decay of these regions, but they always lie above polarity inversion lines (PIL), or boundaries across which the sign of the vertical component of the magnetic field reverses. PILs may exist in, around, and between active regions or form in the quiet Sun between active region remnants. More complex magnetic flux configurations, such as quadrupolar fields, can also host pre-eruption structures.

In order for pre-eruption CME structures to develop, large amounts of energy must be stored and be readily available to be released. As a result of the dominance of magnetic field processes in the lower corona, the majority of the energy must be stored as magnetic energy. The magnetic energy that is freely available to be released from a pre-eruption structure, referred to as the &quot;magnetic free energy&quot; or &quot;nonpotential energy&quot; of the structure, is the excess magnetic energy stored by the structure&#x27;s magnetic configuration relative to that stored by the lowest-energy magnetic configuration the underlying photospheric magnetic flux distribution could theoretically take, a potential field state. Emerging magnetic flux and photospheric motions continuously shifting the footpoints of a structure can result in magnetic free energy building up in the coronal magnetic field as twist or shear. Some pre-eruption structures, referred to as , take on an &quot;S&quot; or reverse-&quot;S&quot; shape as shear accumulates. This has been observed in active region coronal loops and filaments with forward-&quot;S&quot; sigmoids more common in the southern hemisphere and reverse-&quot;S&quot; sigmoids more common in the northern hemisphere.

Magnetic flux ropes—twisted and sheared magnetic flux tubes that can carry electric current and magnetic free energy—are an integral part of the post-eruption CME structure; however, whether flux ropes are always present in the pre-eruption structure or whether they are created during the eruption from a strongly sheared core field (see ) is subject to ongoing debate.

Some pre-eruption structures have been observed to support prominences, also known as filaments, composed of much cooler material than the surrounding coronal plasma. Prominences are embedded in magnetic field structures referred to as prominence cavities, or filament channels, which may constitute part of a pre-eruption structure (see ).

===Early evolution===

The early evolution of a CME involves its initiation from a pre-eruption structure in the corona and the acceleration that follows. The processes involved in the early evolution of CMEs are poorly understood due to a lack of observational evidence.

====Initiation====
CME initiation occurs when a pre-eruption structure in an equilibrium state enters a nonequilibrium or metastable state where energy can be released to drive an eruption. The specific processes involved in CME initiation are debated, and various models have been proposed to explain this phenomenon based on physical speculation. Furthermore, different CMEs may be initiated by different processes.

It is unknown whether a magnetic flux rope exists prior to initiation, in which case either ideal or non-ideal magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) processes drive the expulsion of this flux rope, or whether a flux rope is created during the eruption by non-ideal process. Under ideal MHD, initiation may involve ideal instabilities or catastrophic loss of equilibrium along an existing flux rope:
* The kink instability occurs when a magnetic flux rope is twisted to a critical point, whereupon the flux rope is unstable to further twisting.
* The torus instability occurs when the magnetic field strength of an arcade overlying a flux rope decreases rapidly with height. When this decrease is sufficiently rapid, the flux rope is unstable to further expansion.
* The catastrophe model involves a catastrophic loss of equilibrium.
Under non-ideal MHD, initiations mechanisms may involve resistive instabilities or magnetic reconnection:
* Tether-cutting, or flux cancellation, occurs in strongly sheared arcades when nearly antiparallel field lines on opposite sides of the arcade form a current sheet and reconnect with each other. This can form a helical flux rope or cause a flux rope already present to grow and its axis to rise.
* The magnetic breakout model consists of an initial quadrupolar magnetic topology with a null point above a central flux system. As shearing motions cause this central flux system to rise, the null point forms a current sheet and the core flux system reconnects with the overlying magnetic field.

====Initial acceleration====
Following initiation, CMEs are subject to different forces that either assist or inhibit their rise through the lower corona. Downward magnetic tension force exerted by the strapping magnetic field as it is stretched and, to a lesser extent, the gravitational pull of the Sun oppose movement of the core CME structure. In order for sufficient acceleration to be provided, past models have involved magnetic reconnection below the core field or an ideal MHD process, such as instability or acceleration from the solar wind.

In the majority of CME events, acceleration is provided by magnetic reconnection cutting the strapping field&#x27;s connections to the photosphere from below the core and outflow from this reconnection pushing the core upward. When the initial rise occurs, the opposite sides of the strapping field below the rising core are oriented nearly antiparallel to one another and are brought together to form a current sheet above the PIL. Fast magnetic reconnection can be excited along the current sheet by microscopic instabilities, resulting in the rapid release of stored magnetic energy as kinetic, thermal, and nonthermal energy. The restructuring of the magnetic field cuts the strapping field&#x27;s connections to the photosphere thereby decreasing the downward magnetic tension force while the upward reconnection outflow pushes the CME structure upwards. A positive feedback loop results as the core is pushed upwards and the sides of the strapping field are brought in closer and closer contact to produce additional magnetic reconnection and rise. While upward reconnection outflow accelerates the core, simultaneous downward outflow is sometimes responsible for other phenomena associated with CMEs (see ).

In cases where significant magnetic reconnection does not occur, ideal MHD instabilities or the dragging force from the solar wind can theoretically accelerate a CME. However, if sufficient acceleration is not provided, the CME structure may fall back in what is referred to as a &quot;failed&quot; or &quot;confined eruption&quot;.

====Coronal signatures====

The early evolution of CMEs is frequently associated with other solar phenomena observed in the low corona, such as eruptive prominences and solar flares. CMEs that have no observed signatures are sometimes referred to as &quot;stealth CMEs&quot;.

Prominences embedded in some CME pre-eruption structures may erupt with the CME as eruptive prominences. Eruptive prominences are associated with at least 70% of all CMEs and are often embedded within the bases of CME flux ropes. When observed in white-light coronagraphs, the eruptive prominence material, if present, corresponds to the observed bright core of dense material.

When magnetic reconnection is excited along a current sheet of a rising CME core structure, the downward reconnection outflows can collide with loops below to form a cusp-shaped, two-ribbon solar flare.

CME eruptions can also produce EUV waves, also known as &quot;EIT waves&quot; after the Extreme ultraviolet Imaging Telescope or as &quot;Moreton waves&quot; when observed in the chromosphere, which are fast-mode MHD wave fronts that emanate from the site of the CME.

A coronal dimming is a localized decrease in extreme ultraviolet and soft X-ray emissions in the lower corona. When associated with a CME, coronal dimmings are thought to occur predominantly due to a decrease in plasma density caused by mass outflows during the expansion of the associated CME. They often occur either in pairs located within regions of opposite magnetic polarity, a core dimming, or in a more widespread area, a secondary dimming. Core dimmings are interpreted as the footpoint locations of the erupting flux rope; secondary dimmings are interpreted as the result of the expansion of the overall CME structure and are generally more diffuse and shallow. Coronal dimming was first reported in 1974, and, due to their appearance resembling that of coronal holes, they were sometimes referred to as &quot;transient coronal holes&quot;.

===Propagation===

Observations of CMEs are typically through white-light coronagraphs which measure the Thomson scattering of sunlight off of free electrons within the CME plasma. An observed CME may have any or all of three distinctive features: a bright core, a dark surrounding cavity, and a bright leading edge. The bright core is usually interpreted as a prominence embedded in the CME (see ) with the leading edge as an area of compressed plasma ahead of the CME flux rope. However, some CMEs exhibit more complex geometry.

From white-light coronagraph observations, CMEs have been measured to reach speeds in the plane-of-sky ranging from with an average speed of . Observations of CME speeds indicate that CMEs tend to accelerate or decelerate until they reach the speed of the solar wind ().

When observed in interplanetary space at distances greater than about away from the Sun, CMEs are sometimes referred to as &quot;interplanetary CMEs&quot;, or &quot;ICMEs&quot;.

====Interactions in the heliosphere====
As CMEs propagate through the heliosphere, they may interact with the surrounding solar wind, the interplanetary magnetic field, and other CMEs and celestial bodies.

CMEs can experience aerodynamic drag forces that act to bring them to kinematic equilibrium with the solar wind. As a consequence, CMEs faster than the solar wind tend to slow down whereas CMEs slower than the solar wind tend to speed up until their speed matches that of the solar wind.

How CMEs evolve as they propagate through the heliosphere is poorly understood. Models of their evolution have been proposed that are accurate to some CMEs but not others. Aerodynamic drag and snowplow models assume that ICME evolution is governed by its interactions with the solar wind. Aerodynamic drag alone may be able to account for the evolution of some ICMEs, but not all of them.
CMEs typically reach Earth one to five days after leaving the Sun. The strongest deceleration or acceleration occurs close to the Sun, but it can continue even beyond Earth orbit (1 AU), which was observed using measurements at Mars and by the &quot;Ulysses&quot; spacecraft. ICMEs faster than about eventually drive a shock wave. This happens when the speed of the ICME in the frame of reference moving with the solar wind is faster than the local fast magnetosonic speed. Such shocks have been observed directly by coronagraphs in the corona, and are related to type II radio bursts. They are thought to form sometimes as low as (solar radii). They are also closely linked with the acceleration of solar energetic particles.

As ICMEs propagate through the interplanetary medium, they may collide with other ICMEs in what is referred to as &quot;CME–CME interaction&quot; or &quot;CME cannibalism&quot;.

During such CME-CME interactions, the first CME may clear the way for the second one and/or when two CMEs collide it can lead to more severe impacts on Earth. Historical records show that the most extreme space weather events involved multiple successive CMEs. For example, the famous Carrington event in 1859 had several eruptions and caused auroras to be visible at low latitudes for four nights. Similarly, the solar storm of September 1770 lasted for nearly nine days, and caused repeated low-latitude auroras. The interaction between two moderate CMEs between the Sun and Earth can create extreme conditions on Earth. Recent studies have shown that the magnetic structure in particular its chirality/handedness, of a CME can greatly affect how it interacts with Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. This interaction can result in the conservation or loss of magnetic flux, particularly its southward magnetic field component, through magnetic reconnection with the interplanetary magnetic field.

===Morphology===

In the solar wind, CMEs manifest as magnetic clouds. They have been defined as regions of enhanced magnetic field strength, smooth rotation of the magnetic field vector, and low proton temperature. The association between CMEs and magnetic clouds was made by Burlaga et al. in 1982 when a magnetic cloud was observed by Helios-1 two days after being observed by SMM. However, because observations near Earth are usually done by a single spacecraft, many CMEs are not seen as being associated with magnetic clouds. The typical structure observed for a fast CME by a satellite such as ACE is a fast-mode shock wave followed by a dense (and hot) sheath of plasma (the downstream region of the shock) and a magnetic cloud.

Other signatures of magnetic clouds are now used in addition to the one described above: among other, bidirectional superthermal electrons, unusual charge state or abundance of iron, helium, carbon, and/or oxygen.

The typical time for a magnetic cloud to move past a satellite at the L1 point is 1 day corresponding to a radius of 0.15 AU with a typical speed of and magnetic field strength of 20 nT.

==Solar cycle==

The frequency of ejections depends on the phase of the solar cycle: from about 0.2 per day near the solar minimum to 3.5 per day near the solar maximum. However, the peak CME occurrence rate is often 6–12 months after sunspot number reaches its maximum.

==Impact on Earth==

Only a very small fraction of CMEs are directed toward, and reach, the Earth. A CME arriving at Earth results in a shock wave causing a geomagnetic storm that may disrupt Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere, compressing it on the day side and extending the night-side magnetic tail. When the magnetosphere reconnects on the nightside, it releases power on the order of terawatts directed back toward Earth&#x27;s upper atmosphere. This can result in events such as the March 1989 geomagnetic storm.

CMEs, along with solar flares, can disrupt radio transmissions and cause damage to satellites and electrical transmission line facilities, resulting in potentially massive and long-lasting power outages.

Shocks in the upper corona driven by CMEs can also accelerate solar energetic particles toward the Earth resulting in gradual solar particle events. Interactions between these energetic particles and the Earth can cause an increase in the number of free electrons in the ionosphere, especially in the high-latitude polar regions, enhancing radio wave absorption, especially within the D-region of the ionosphere, leading to polar cap absorption events.

The interaction of CMEs with the Earth&#x27;s magnetosphere leads to dramatic changes in the outer radiation belt, with either a decrease or an increase of relativistic particle fluxes by orders of magnitude. The changes in radiation belt particle fluxes are caused by acceleration, scattering and radial diffusion of relativistic electrons, due to the interactions with various plasma waves.

A halo coronal mass ejection is a CME which appears in white-light coronagraph observations as an expanding ring completely surrounding the occulting disk of the coronagraph. Halo CMEs are interpreted as CMEs directed toward or away from the observing coronagraph. When the expanding ring does not completely surround the occulting disk, but has an angular width of more than 120 degrees around the disk, the CME is referred to as a partial halo coronal mass ejection. Partial and full halo CMEs have been found to make up about 10% of all CMEs with about 4% of all CMEs being full halo CMEs. Frontside, or Earth-direct, halo CMEs are often associated with Earth-impacting CMEs; however, not all frontside halo CMEs impact Earth.

===Future risk===
In 2019, researchers used an alternative method (Weibull distribution) and estimated the chance of Earth being hit by a Carrington-class storm in the next decade to be between 0.46% and 1.88%.

==History==

===First traces===

CMEs have been observed indirectly for thousands of years via aurora. Other indirect observations that predated the discovery of CMEs were through measurements of geomagnetic perturbations, radioheliograph measurements of solar radio bursts, and in-situ measurements of interplanetary shocks.

The largest recorded geomagnetic perturbation, resulting presumably from a CME, coincided with the first-observed solar flare on 1 September 1859. The resulting solar storm of 1859 is referred to as the Carrington Event. The flare and the associated sunspots were visible to the naked eye, and the flare was independently observed by English astronomers R. C. Carrington and R. Hodgson. At around the same time as the flare, a magnetometer at Kew Gardens recorded what would become known as a &quot;magnetic crochet&quot;, a magnetic field detected by ground-based magnetometers induced by a perturbation of Earth&#x27;s ionosphere by ionizing soft X-rays. This could not easily be understood at the time because it predated the discovery of X-rays in 1895 and the recognition of the ionosphere in 1902.

About 18 hours after the flare, further geomagnetic perturbations were recorded by multiple magnetometers as a part of a geomagnetic storm. The storm disabled parts of the recently created US telegraph network, starting fires and shocking some telegraph operators.

===First optical observations===
The first optical observation of a CME was made on 14 December 1971 using the coronagraph of Orbiting Solar Observatory 7 (OSO-7). It was first described by R. Tousey of the Naval Research Laboratory in a research paper published in 1973. The discovery image (256 × 256 pixels) was collected on a Secondary Electron Conduction (SEC) vidicon tube, transferred to the instrument computer after being digitized to 7 bits. Then it was compressed using a simple run-length encoding scheme and sent down to the ground at 200 bit/s. A full, uncompressed image would take 44 minutes to send down to the ground. The telemetry was sent to ground support equipment (GSE) which built up the image onto Polaroid print. David Roberts, an electronics technician working for NRL who had been responsible for the testing of the SEC-vidicon camera, was in charge of day-to-day operations. He thought that his camera had failed because certain areas of the image were much brighter than normal. But on the next image the bright area had moved away from the Sun and he immediately recognized this as being unusual and took it to his supervisor, Dr. Guenter Brueckner, and then to the solar physics branch head, Dr. Tousey. Earlier observations of &quot;coronal transients&quot; or even phenomena observed visually during solar eclipses are now understood as essentially the same thing.

===Instruments===
On 1 November 1994, NASA launched the &quot;Wind&quot; spacecraft as a solar wind monitor to orbit Earth&#x27;s Lagrange point as the interplanetary component of the Global Geospace Science (GGS) Program within the International Solar Terrestrial Physics (ISTP) program. The spacecraft is a spin axis-stabilized satellite that carries eight instruments measuring solar wind particles from thermal to greater than MeV energies, electromagnetic radiation from DC to 13 MHz radio waves, and gamma-rays.

On 25 October 2006, NASA launched STEREO, two near-identical spacecraft which, from widely separated points in their orbits, are able to produce the first stereoscopic images of CMEs and other solar activity measurements. The spacecraft orbit the Sun at distances similar to that of Earth, with one slightly ahead of Earth and the other trailing. Their separation gradually increased so that after four years they were almost diametrically opposite each other in orbit.

===Notable coronal mass ejections===

On 9 March 1989, a CME occurred, which struck Earth four days later on 13 March. It caused power failures in Quebec, Canada and short-wave radio interference.

On 23 July 2012, a massive, and potentially damaging, solar superstorm (solar flare, CME, solar EMP) occurred but missed Earth, an event that many scientists consider to be a Carrington-class event.

On 14 October 2014, an ICME was photographed by the Sun-watching spacecraft PROBA2 (ESA), Solar and Heliospheric Observatory (ESA/NASA), and Solar Dynamics Observatory (NASA) as it left the Sun, and STEREO-A observed its effects directly at . ESA&#x27;s &quot;Venus Express&quot; gathered data. The CME reached Mars on 17 October and was observed by the &quot;Mars Express&quot;, MAVEN, &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot;, and Mars Science Laboratory missions. On 22 October, at , it reached comet 67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko, perfectly aligned with the Sun and Mars, and was observed by &quot;Rosetta&quot;. On 12 November, at , it was observed by &quot;Cassini&quot; at Saturn. The &quot;New Horizons&quot; spacecraft was at approaching Pluto when the CME passed three months after the initial eruption, and it may be detectable in the data. &quot;Voyager 2&quot; has data that can be interpreted as the passing of the CME, 17 months after. The &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover&#x27;s RAD instrument, &quot;Mars Odyssey&quot;, &quot;Rosetta&quot; and &quot;Cassini&quot; showed a sudden decrease in galactic cosmic rays (Forbush decrease) as the CME&#x27;s protective bubble passed by.

==Stellar coronal mass ejections==
There have been a small number of CMEs observed on other stars, all of which have been found on red dwarfs. These have been detected mainly by spectroscopy, most often by studying Balmer lines: the material ejected toward the observer causes asymmetry in the blue wing of the line profiles due to Doppler shift. This enhancement can be seen in absorption when it occurs on the stellar disc (the material is cooler than its surroundings), and in emission when it is outside the disc. The observed projected velocities of CMEs range from ≈. There are few stellar CME candidates in shorter wavelengths in UV or X-ray data. Compared to activity on the Sun, CME activity on other stars seems to be far less common. The low number of stellar CME detections can be caused by lower intrinsic CME rates compared to the models (e.g. due to magnetic suppression), projection effects, or overestimated Balmer signatures because of the unknown plasma parameters of the stellar CMEs.

<text>Admiral Pascual Cervera y Topete (18 February 1839 – 3 April 1909) was a Spanish Navy officer and politician who served in a number of high-ranking positions within the Navy and fought in several wars during the 19th century. Having served in Morocco, the Philippines, and Cuba, he went on to serve as Minister of the Navy, Chief of Staff of the Navy, naval attaché in London, the captain of several warships, and most notably, commander of the Cuba Squadron during the Spanish–American War. Although he believed that the Spanish Navy was suffering from multiple problems and that there was no chance for victory over the United States Navy, Cervera took command of the squadron and fought in a last stand during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba, where he was decisively defeated.

==Early life and service==
Pascual Cervera y Topete was born in Medina-Sidonia in the province of Cadiz, the son of a Spanish Army officer who fought against French invasion of Spain during the Napoleonic Wars. Cervera entered the naval college at the age of thirteen and was later made a midshipman during his first voyage to Havana in 1858. He later made lieutenant junior grade at the age of 21 and spent time serving in both Cuba (during the early part of the Ten Years&#x27; War) and also Morocco (during the Spanish–Moroccan war). Later, Cervera was deployed to the Spanish Philippines, where, under the command of Admiral Casto Méndez Núñez, in September 1864 he took part in the storming of Fort Pagalungan against the Moro rebels. During that action, he distinguished himself by capturing the enemy flag and was promoted to lieutenant for his service, receiving a mention in the official report on the battle. Afterwards, Cervera took part in expeditions mapping the hundreds of islands of the Philippine archipelago, which became useful to sailors navigating the area. In 1865 he returned to the Spanish homeland and got married.

Due to the political instability that persisted in Spain since Napoleon&#x27;s invasion, Cervera took part in putting down the Cantonal rebellion during one of the Carlist Wars. He later commanded the schooner &quot;Circe&quot; and the corvette &quot;Santa Lucia&quot; back in the Philippines, where Cervera again took part in operations against insurgents. In 1876 the Spanish captain was appointed as the Governor of Jolo, although he later contracted malaria because of the conditions there and barely survived, returning to Madrid to report on the conditions in the Philippines shortly after that at the request of Prime Minister Antonio Cánovas del Castillo. Cánovas asked Cervera to take up the post of Minister of the Navy, but Cervera refused, saying that he preferred to be at sea rather than at a desk job. In 1879, he was given command of the training corvette &quot;Ferolana&quot;, where he remained until 1882, when he was transferred to oversee the Cartagena naval base. From 1885 to 1890, he served on the shipbuilding commission of the battleship &quot;Pelayo&quot; and became its first commander, but had to fight against the bureaucratic procedures of the Spanish Navy that caused delays in her construction.

==In the government==
In May 1891, the Queen Regent María Cristina assigned Cervera to her court as her naval aide-de-camp. A year later the captain was assigned to oversee the construction of several cruisers for the Spanish Navy at the request of the Queen Regent. Around that time multiple politicians wanted Cervera to become the Minister of the Navy, but he continued to resist because he detested politics. Finally, in 1892, Prime Minister Práxedes Mateo Sagasta asked the Queen Regent to compel him to accept the position of naval minister in his government. She did so, and Cervera reluctantly accepted, being promoted to &quot;Contraalmirante&quot; (rear admiral). But the newly promoted flag officer made the prime minister promise to not lower the naval budget in return, which Mateo accepted. However, it was not long before the prime minister broke that promise and so Cervera resigned from the position in 1892, but not before trying to make efforts to improve the Spanish Navy&#x27;s efficiency. The rear admiral was appointed as the naval attaché in London shortly afterwards, where he witnessed the technical innovations being made by the British Royal Navy, a post he held until the situation in Cuba began escalating around 1896–97.

==Service in Cuba==
The admiral viewed the escalation of tensions between the kingdom and the United States with alarm, as he believed their defeat would be inevitable in a war because of the U.S. Navy&#x27;s advancements between 1892 and 1896. Cervera thought that the Spanish were unprepared and did not possess enough ships to defend their colonies. Nonetheless, he accepted the posting of commander of the Cuban squadron on 20 October 1897 and immediately organized training exercises to prepare the crews, since the last time naval drills had been carried out was 1884 (during tensions with the German Empire over the Caroline Islands). Cervera sought to correct the numerous deficiencies in the fleet within a short time period, including lack of training and inadequate supplies. He continued to face difficulties from the naval ministry of Admiral Segismundo Bermejo, however. After the explosion aboard the American battleship in Havana harbor in February 1898, the admiral sped back to Spain to speak to the government in person, but received orders from the Admiralty while at Cape Verde to take several ships back to Cuba and prepare for war, despite the severe problems in the fleet. Cervera returned to the Caribbean and slipped past American ships to enter the harbor Santiago de Cuba on May 19, despite several mishaps and having difficulties finding a port to refuel on coal, as most of the European countries with possessions in the Caribbean remained officially neutral. His total force included the cruisers , , , and , along with two destroyers.

The U.S. remained unaware of the Spanish squadron&#x27;s whereabouts for another several days, prior to it being discovered on May 28 or 29 at Santiago harbor by the Flying Squadron under Commodore Winfield Scott Schley. On May 31, the two sides exchanged fire, between the &quot;Cristóbal Colón&quot; and three American vessels (, , and ). After some time, Cervera ordered his squadron&#x27;s cruiser to return to the harbor, with neither side having taken any damage. The rest of the North Atlantic Squadron under Rear Admiral William T. Sampson, operating in Cuban waters, did not arrive until June 1, and together the U.S. naval forces blockaded Cervera&#x27;s squadron in Santiago. On June 2–3, the American commander decided to try to blockade the Spanish ships in the harbor by sinking a collier, the , at the entrance. However, it came under fire from the defenders and was forced aground, at which point the Spanish admiral personally met with its American crewmen, who were taken prisoner. 

Cervera later sent his chief of staff under a flag of truce to give a note to Admiral Sampson informing him that the collier&#x27;s crew was alive and safe. It was an act that impressed his American opponents and Sampson later noted that the affair &quot;gave us a favorable impression of the Spanish officers.&quot;

The fleet remained mostly inactive in harbor for the next month until July 2, when Ramón Blanco, the military governor of Cuba, gave orders for a sortie against the American blockade. Earlier, Admiral Cervera had argued with the authorities in Madrid against taking such an action, but Blanco settled the matter with his order. They formally departed on July 3. The U.S. fleet sounded the alarm at 9:31 in the morning on July 3. The approaching Spanish ships, with Cervera&#x27;s flagship &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; leading the way, opened fire and engaged the U.S. fleet. They headed west while remaining near the coastline. The American battleships and cruisers pursued them as they made their way along the coast as the Spanish admiral&#x27;s flagship sustained heavy damage from them. With their engines damaged, Cervera decided to ground the &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot;, which they did at 10:15 am. Around 10:20, the &quot;Almirante Oquendo&quot; was forced out of action with heavy damage and grounded. The two destroyers, and , put up a fight before also the former ran aground and the latter was sunk by 10:30 am.

As the admiral&#x27;s flagship raised a white flag on the beach, the remaining two cruisers – &quot;Vizcaya&quot; and &quot;Colón&quot; – were pursued, with the former being destroyed around 11:00 while the latter made it fifty miles from Santiago before being grounded on a beach. After that, the American ships began rescue operations for the Spanish sailors of the destroyed squadron, and among those captured from the wreck of the &quot;Infanta Maria Teresa&quot; was Admiral Cervera. That afternoon, he made it onto the USS &quot;Iowa&quot;, where he and the other Spanish officers met with Captain Robley D. Evans and formally surrendered to them. Afterwards, Cervera and the rest of the captured prisoners were sent to Annapolis, where they were free to roam the U.S. Naval Academy and were greeted with cheers by Americans. The &quot;New York Times&quot; reported that he appeared to be &quot;much affected by the genuineness and spontaneity of the feeling manifested.&quot; On August 20, he was offered freedom by the U.S. government on the condition that he would not take up arms against the United States, but he refused, saying that accepting conditional freedom was illegal by Spanish law, and did not return to Spain until September 1898. He gained popularity among both the Spanish and American public in the years after the war.

==Later life==
In February 1901, Cervera was promoted to &quot;Vizealmirante&quot; (vice admiral) and in December 1902 became the Chief of Staff of the Navy. In May of the following year, King Alfonso XIII of Spain named him a senator of the kingdom for life. By 1906, his health was failing and Cervera was reassigned to manage the naval district of Ferrol before retiring the next year. He died on 3 April 1909.

==Personal life==
Admiral Cervera was married and had several children, but he lived his private life with a rigid schedule. One of his sons was also in the Spanish Navy and served with his father at Santiago.

Cervera also spoke fluent English.

==Recognition==
Admiral Cervera continued to be a popular figure in the years following his death, to the point that even the Spanish Navy acknowledged him as a symbol of patriotism by naming a light cruiser after him.

<text>A box kite is a high-performance kite, noted for developing relatively high lift; it is a type within the family of cellular kites. The typical design has four parallel struts. The box is made rigid with diagonal crossed struts. There are two sails, or &quot;ribbons&quot;, whose width is about a quarter of the length of the box. The ribbons wrap around the ends of the box, leaving the ends and middle of the kite open. In flight, one strut is the bottom, and the bridle is tied between the top and bottom of this strut. The dihedrals of the sails help stability.

The box kite was invented in 1893 by Lawrence Hargrave, an English-born Australian, as part of his attempt to develop a manned flying machine. Hargrave linked several of his box kites (Hargrave cells) together, creating sufficient lift for him to fly some 16 ft (4.9 m) off the ground. A winged development of this kite is known as the Cody kite following its development by Samuel Franklin Cody. Military uses also involved a kite/radio transmitter combination issued to pilots during World War II for use in liferafts.

Large box kites are constructed as cellular kites. Rather than one box, there are many, each with its own set of sails.

Most of the altitude records for kite flying are held by large box kites, with Dacron sails, flown with Spectra cable. However in 2014 Robert Moore and a team of kite experts flew a 12 sq metre DT delta to 16,009 ft above their launch point. The location of the flights was near Cobar in Western NSW, Australia. While this was primarily a triangular winged delta kite, it has a triangular box centre cell for additional stability. Future attempts on either the single kite record or multiple kite record (trained), may use Hargrave box kites or a variant. Before Dacron, Spectra, and Kevlar were available, high performance box kites used oiled silk, linen or hemp sails, and were flown with steel cable. Silk, linen and hemp were used because they could be spun finer than cotton and stretched relatively little when wet. Steel had the highest available strength for its weight. After Hargrave invented the box kite, weather stations from around the world saw the potential for his design. Blue hill observatory and the German weather station at Lindenberg used kites routinely until weather balloons took over in the 1920s and 1930s.

<doc id="255304" wikidata="Q870490" url="?curid=255304" title="3rd Rock from the Sun">
<text>3rd Rock from the Sun is an American television sitcom created by Bonnie and Terry Turner, which originally aired from January 9, 1996, to May 22, 2001, on NBC. The show is about four extraterrestrials who are on an expedition to Earth, the third planet from the Sun, which they consider to be a very insignificant planet. The extraterrestrials pose as a human family to observe the behavior of human beings.

The show premiered three years after the film &quot;Coneheads&quot;, which was also written by the couple and featured a similar premise of extraterrestrials arriving on Earth and assimilating into American society.

== Overview ==
The premise of the show revolves around an extraterrestrial research expedition hailing from a planet in a barred spiral galaxy on the Cepheus-Draco border attempting to live as a normal human family in the fictional city of Rutherford, Ohio, said to be outside of Cleveland where they live in an attic apartment. The show&#x27;s humor is principally derived from the aliens&#x27; attempts to study human society and understand the human condition, while living as humans on Earth, reflecting on human life from the perspective of aliens. Most of the episodes are named after the protagonist, Dick. In later episodes, they have become more accustomed to Earth and are often more interested in their human lives than in their mission.

The show also takes humor from its mirroring of all human anthropological expeditions and their assumptions of superiority to the &quot;natives&quot;, as well as their inability to distinguish themselves from the natives. Dr. Mary Albright (Jane Curtin) is a professor of anthropology at fictional Pendelton State University, and many of the issues with which the four aliens struggle appear in her conversation and work. Furthermore, these four alien researchers end up looking approximately like joyriders as they get drawn increasingly further into human life.

Dick Solomon (John Lithgow), the High Commander and leader of the expedition, is the family provider and a physics professor at Pendelton (with Lithgow&#x27;s eldest son Ian playing Leon, one of his less-successful students). Information officer and oldest member of the crew Tommy (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) has been given the body of a teenager and is forced to enroll in high school (later college), leaving security officer Sally (Kristen Johnston) and &quot;the one with the transmitter in his head&quot;, Harry (French Stewart), to spend their lives as 20-somethings hanging out at home and bouncing through short-term jobs. The show also involves their relationships with humans, mostly their love interests.

The family often communicates through Harry with their off-world (and usually unseen) boss, the Big Giant Head, who when he finally visits Earth, is played by William Shatner. Harry unexpectedly (and often in inconvenient circumstances) stands up, his arms stiff (acting as the antenna), and proclaims: &quot;Incoming message from the Big Giant Head!&quot;

== Production ==

=== Theme music ===
The show&#x27;s opening theme music, composed by Ben Vaughn, was originally a 1950s-style rock-and-roll instrumental piece for the first four seasons; the theme was extended slightly in season three, when Simbi Khali, Elmarie Wendel, and Wayne Knight were officially made series regulars and added to the opening credits. During season one, James Earl Jones provided a voice introduction describing the crew. For Christmas episodes, jingle bells were added to the theme. The only major change to the theme was in season five, when the original Ben Vaughn version was replaced by a big band cover of the theme, performed by the group Big Bad Voodoo Daddy, and was only used during that season. For the sixth and final season, the original theme returned and a modern jazz underline version of the theme was used for two episodes.

=== Title sequence ===
The opening title sequence, which was produced by the London graphic design firm SVC Television, opens with computerized shots of planets and celestial bodies, some either with the planets dancing or moving in warp speed. It opens and closes with a shot of Earth (which at the open is where the show&#x27;s title logo appears, after a sunburst appears on the side of Earth). For the sixth and final season only, the typeface of the cast and creators&#x27; names was altered.

== Other media ==
A tie-in book, &quot;3rd Rock from the Sun: The Official Report On Earth&quot;, was released in 1997. It is essentially a report of the Solomons&#x27; findings during their stay on Earth. Primarily a source of humor, the book includes such features as &quot;What to do if you encounter Jell-O&quot;, a fan biography of Katie Couric written by Harry, and Sally&#x27;s version of a &quot;Cosmo&quot; quiz. Portions of the book are included in the booklets inside each season set of the series.

Despite the report&#x27;s being set within the fictional world of &quot;3rd Rock&quot;, a foreword written by John Lithgow himself is included in which he explains how he was abducted by the &quot;3rd Rock&quot; producers and forced to work on their production. A Post-it note is attached to the foreword, apparently written by Dick Solomon, stating he does not know why the foreword is there, but that Lithgow is an Earth actor who appeared in &quot;some helicopter movie&quot;.

<doc id="255307" wikidata="Q3090798" url="?curid=255307" title="Fully Completely">
<text>Fully Completely is the third studio album by Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. The album was released in October 1992 and produced by Chris Tsangarides. The album produced six singles: &quot;Locked in the Trunk of a Car&quot;, &quot;Fifty Mission Cap&quot;, &quot;Courage (For Hugh MacLennan)&quot;, &quot;At the Hundredth Meridian&quot;, &quot;Looking for a Place to Happen&quot;, and &quot;Fully Completely&quot;.

== Background ==
The Tragically Hip had released two full-length albums (&quot;Up To Here&quot; and &quot;Road Apples&quot;) before &quot;Fully Completely&quot;, working with producer Don Smith. While the albums had been successful in Canada, the Tragically Hip had not broken into the American market in a significant way. Hip guitarist Rob Baker later voiced the opinion that collaborating with the same producer on multiple projects (as the Hip had done with their first two albums) becomes troublesome because &quot;little politics and intrigues enter into things&quot;. In late 1992, producer Chris Tsangarides had just completed production on an album by Concrete Blonde, and was eager to work with the Tragically Hip. MCA, responsible for the financial success of the album, favored Tsangarides because of his proven ability to generate an American radio-friendly sound. During production of the second album, singer Gord Downie had announced that he would no longer sing lyrics written by other members of the band. &quot;Fully Completely&quot; was the first album that would follow that decision by Downie.

== Recording and production ==
&quot;Fully Completely&quot; was recorded under the supervision of producer Chris Tsangarides at Battery Studios in London, England. In contrast to the band’s first two albums, the production techniques did not try to mimic what the band was performing on stage. Each track was built instrument by instrument over the course of five weeks, with only three days dedicated to vocals. The band expected recording in London to be a &quot;grand experience,&quot; but had a mixed experience upon arriving. Some band members found the nights and weekends outside the studio to be, &quot;dull and isolating&quot;. The art budget for the album was $30,000, and the total budget for the album was an estimated $185,000. The band has described the making of the album as being &quot;about us wanting to learn&quot;.

== Album artwork ==
The cover art for &quot;Fully Completely&quot; was designed by Dutch artist Lieve Prins. Prins was given the idea of a &quot;bacchanalian sort of scene – lots of decadence, decay and rebirth,&quot; by Hip guitarist Rob Baker, and was left to work with the idea. Prins also drew inspiration from I ching symbols and numbers. The final artwork was created using a Canon colour photocopier. The cover consists of 30 segmented photocopied images pasted together. The band was granted licensing privileges to the artwork, but Prins retained the ownership of the actual artwork. In the late 1990s, the Tragically Hip bought the piece from a gallery in Los Angeles. It now hangs prominently in their studio near Kingston, Ontario.

== Themes ==
The lyrics on &quot;Fully Completely&quot; are heavily centred on Canadian icons and history. Writer Rob Mitchell has described the album as, &quot;a trippy Canadiana dream/nightmare – like The Odessy [sic] directed by Atom Egoyan&quot;. The title of the first track on the album, &quot;Courage (for Hugh MacLennan)&quot; makes reference to Canadian author Hugh MacLennan, and was inspired by his novel &quot;The Watch That Ends the Night&quot;. The second track, &quot;Looking for a Place to Happen&quot;, deals with the subject of European encroachment and the eventual annexation of indigenous lands in North America, making specific reference to explorer Jacques Cartier. The third track, &quot;At the Hundredth Meridian&quot;, references the line of longitude that separates much of Western Canada from the Central and Atlantic regions. The ninth track. &quot;Fifty Mission Cap&quot;, references the life, career, and death of Toronto Maple Leafs player Bill Barilko, as well as fifty mission caps, which were provided to elite bomber pilots of the allied air forces during World War II.

== Reception ==
&quot;Fully Completely&quot; was extremely well received in Canada. It had initial orders of 150,000 copies in Canada, and 200,000 in Canada by the end of three months. The Tragically Hip and their label, MCA, had high expectations for the U.S. release of &quot;Fully Completely&quot;. Gord Sinclair described in an interview that the band, &quot;were still holding out for the equivalent American success&quot;. The success, however, did not happen. MCA stopped American promotion of &quot;Fully Completely&quot; after two weeks. Its success in Canada, however, was unquestionable. It reached on the &quot;RPM&quot; Top 100 albums chart. The album is listed at on The Top 100 Canadian Albums by Bob Mersereau and on The Top 102 Modern Rock Albums of All Time by 102.1 The Edge. The album was certified Diamond in Canada in January 2007 for sales of 1,000,000 copies. Despite the Tragically Hip&#x27;s great domestic success, this was the only album of theirs to be released in Japan. It was released there on April 21, 1993, with the catalogue number of MVCM-360.

At the 2017 Polaris Music Prize, the album won the public vote for the Heritage Prize in the 1986-1995 category.

== Tours ==
Rather than a normal tour, the Tragically Hip followed the release of &quot;Fully Completely&quot; with the organization of &quot;Another Roadside Attraction&quot;, in 1993. Another Roadside Attraction was a traveling music and arts summer festival which promoted little known bands and traveled across Canada. In 2014 and 2015, the band held a 22nd anniversary tour in
which they played the album from beginning to end during each show.

==Reissue==
A remastered &quot;deluxe edition&quot; of the album was released in 2014. The reissue included two new tracks from the original recording sessions, as well as a second disc featuring a September 13, 1992, concert performance at the Horseshoe Tavern in Toronto. One of the new tracks, &quot;Radio Show,&quot; was released as a single to promote the reissue and reached #29 on Canada&#x27;s rock chart.

<text>The Sophisticated Operating System, or SOS (), is the primary operating system of the Apple III computer. SOS was developed by Apple Computer and released in October 1980.

In 1985, Steve Wozniak, while critical of the Apple III&#x27;s hardware flaws, called SOS &quot;the finest operating system on any microcomputer ever&quot;.

==Technical details==
SOS is a single-tasking single-user operating system. It makes the resources of the Apple III available in the form of a menu-driven utility program as well as a programming application programming interface (API). A single program is loaded at boot time, called the interpreter. Once loaded, the interpreter can then use the SOS API to make requests of the system. The SOS API is divided into four main areas:

#File Calls: Create, destroy, rename, open, close, read, write files; set, get prefix (current working directory); set, get file information; get volume information; set, set mark, EOF, and level of files
#Device Calls: Get status, device number, information of a device; send device control data
#Memory Calls: Request, find, change, release memory segment; get segment information; set segment number
#Utility Calls: Get, set fence (event threshold); get, set time; get analog (joystick) data; terminate.

The Apple III System Utilities program shipped with each Apple III computer. It provides the user interface of the operating system itself, for system configuration and file management. The System Utilities program is menu-driven and performs tasks in three categories:

#Device-handling commands: copy, rename, format, verify volumes (drives); list devices; set time and date
#File-handling commands: list, copy, delete, rename files; create subdirectories; set file write protection; set prefix (current working directory)
#System Configuration Program (SCP): configure device drivers.

SOS has two types of devices it communicates with via device drivers: character devices and block devices. Examples of SOS character devices are keyboards and serial ports. Disk drives are typical block devices. Block devices can read or write one or more 512-byte blocks at a time; character devices can read or write single characters at a time.

===Boot sequence===

When powered on, the Apple III runs through system diagnostics, then reads block number zero from the built-in diskette drive into memory and executes it. SOS-formatted diskettes place a loader program in block zero. That loader program searches for, loads, and executes a file named SOS.KERNEL, which is the kernel and API of the operating system. The kernel, in turn, searches for and loads a file named SOS.INTERP (the interpreter, or program, to run) and SOS.DRIVER, the set of device drivers to use. Once all files are loaded, control is passed to the SOS.INTERP program.

Apple ProDOS uses the same file system as SOS. On a disk formatted by ProDOS, the ProDOS loader and SOS loader are written to blocks zero and one, respectively. The ProDOS loader includes code that can execute on an Apple III, and which will chainload the SOS loader from block one, so SOS and ProDOS can co-exist on the same volume. Some software, such as ADTPro, makes use of this to store Apple II and Apple III versions of a program on the same disk, which is then bootable on both systems.

<doc id="255313" wikidata="Q205801" url="?curid=255313" title="Saffir–Simpson scale">
<text>The Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (SSHWS) is a scale that classifies hurricanes—which in the Western Hemisphere are tropical cyclones that exceed the intensities of tropical depressions and tropical storms—into five categories distinguished by the intensities of their sustained winds. This measuring system was formerly known as the Saffir–Simpson hurricane scale, or SSHS.

To be classified as a hurricane, a tropical cyclone must have one-minute-average maximum sustained winds at above the surface of at least 74 mph (64 kn, 119 km/h; Category 1). The highest classification in the scale, Category 5, consists of storms with sustained winds of at least 157 mph (137 kn, 252 km/h). The classifications can provide some indication of the potential damage and flooding a hurricane will cause upon landfall.

The Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale is based on the highest wind speed averaged over a one-minute interval 10 m above the surface. Although the scale shows wind speeds in continuous speed ranges, the US National Hurricane Center and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5-knot (kn) increments (e.g., 100, 105, 110, 115 kn, etc.) because of the inherent uncertainty in estimating the strength of tropical cyclones. Wind speeds in knots are then converted to other units and rounded to the nearest 5 mph or 5 km/h.

The Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale is used officially only to describe hurricanes that form in the Atlantic Ocean and northern Pacific Ocean east of the International Date Line. Other areas use different scales to label these storms, which are called &quot;cyclones&quot; or &quot;typhoons,&quot; depending on the area. These areas (except the JTWC) use &quot;three-minute&quot; or &quot;ten-minute&quot; averaged winds to determine the maximum sustained wind speed, creating an important difference which frustrates direct comparison between maximum wind speeds of storms measured using the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale (usually 14% more intense) and those measured using a &quot;ten-minute&quot; interval (usually 12% less intense).

There is some criticism of the SSHWS for not accounting for rain, storm surge, and other important factors, but SSHWS defenders say that part of the goal of SSHWS is to be straightforward and simple to understand. There have been proposals for the addition of higher categories to the scale, which would then set a maximum cutoff for Category 5, but none have been adopted .

==History==
In 1971, the scale was developed by civil engineer Herbert Saffir and meteorologist Robert Simpson, who at the time was director of the U.S. National Hurricane Center (NHC). In 1973, the scale was introduced to the general public, and saw widespread use after Neil Frank replaced Simpson at the helm of the NHC in 1974.

The scale was created by Herbert Saffir, a structural engineer, who in 1969 was commissioned by the United Nations to study low-cost housing in hurricane-prone areas. In 1971, while conducting the study, Saffir realized there was no simple scale for describing the likely effects of a hurricane. By using subjective damage-based scales for earthquake intensity like the Modified Mercalli intensity scale or MSK-64 intensity scale and the objective numerical gradation method of the Richter scale as models, he proposed a simplified 1–5 grading scale as a guide for areas that do not have hurricane building codes. The grades were based on two main factors: objective wind gust speeds sustaining for 2–3 seconds at an elevation of 9.2 meters, and subjective levels of structural damage. 

Saffir gave the proposed scale to the NHC for their use, where Simpson changed the terminology from &quot;grade&quot; to &quot;category&quot;, organized them by sustained wind speeds of 1 minute duration, and added storm surge height ranges, adding barometric pressure ranges later on. In 1975, the Saffir-Simpson Scale was first published publicly.

In 2009, the NHC eliminated pressure and storm surge ranges from the categories, transforming it into a pure wind scale, called the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale (Experimental) [SSHWS]. The updated scale became operational on May 15, 2010. The scale excludes flood ranges, storm surge estimations, rainfall, and location, which means a Category 2 hurricane that hits a major city will likely do far more cumulative damage than a Category 5 hurricane that hits a rural area. The agency cited examples of hurricanes as reasons for removing &quot;scientifically inaccurate&quot; information, including Hurricane Katrina (2005) and Hurricane Ike (2008), which both had stronger than estimated storm surges, and Hurricane Charley (2004), which had weaker than estimated storm surge. Since being removed from the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, storm surge prediction and modeling is handled by computer numerical models such as ADCIRC and SLOSH.

In 2012, the NHC extended the wind speed range for Category 4 by 1 mph in both directions, to 130–156 mph, with corresponding changes in the other units (113–136 kn, 209–251 km/h), instead of 131–155 mph (114–135 kn, 210–249 km/h). The NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center assign tropical cyclone intensities in 5 knot increments, and then convert to mph and km/h with a similar rounding for other reports. So an intensity of 115 kn is rated Category 4, but the conversion to miles per hour (132.3 mph) would round down to 130 mph, making it appear to be a Category 3 storm. Likewise, an intensity of 135 kn (~155 mph, and thus Category 4) is 250.02 km/h, which, according to the definition used before the change would be Category 5.

To resolve these issues, the NHC had been obliged to incorrectly report storms with wind speeds of 115 kn as 135 mph, and 135 kn as 245 km/h. The change in definition allows storms of 115 kn to be correctly rounded down to 130 mph, and storms of 135 kn to be correctly reported as 250 km/h, and still qualify as Category 4. Since the NHC had previously rounded incorrectly to keep storms in Category 4 in each unit of measure, the change does not affect the classification of storms from previous years. The new scale became operational on May 15, 2012.

==Categories==
The scale separates hurricanes into five different categories based on wind. The U.S. National Hurricane Center classifies hurricanes of Category 3 and above as &quot;major hurricanes&quot;. The Joint Typhoon Warning Center classifies typhoons of 150 mph (240 km/h) or greater (strong Category 4 and Category 5) as &quot;super typhoons&quot;. Most weather agencies use the definition for sustained winds recommended by the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), which specifies measuring winds at a height of for 10 minutes, and then taking the average. By contrast, the U.S. National Weather Service, Central Pacific Hurricane Center and the Joint Typhoon Warning Center define sustained winds as average winds over a period of one minute, measured at the same height, and that is the definition used for this scale.

The five categories are described in the following subsections, in order of increasing intensity. Example hurricanes for each category are limited to those which made landfall at their maximum achieved category on the scale.

===Category 1===

Very dangerous winds will produce some damage

Category 1 storms usually cause no significant structural damage to most well-constructed permanent structures. They can topple unanchored mobile homes, as well as uproot or snap weak trees. Poorly attached roof shingles or tiles can blow off. Coastal flooding and pier damage are often associated with Category 1 storms. Power outages are typically widespread to extensive, sometimes lasting several days. Even though it is the least intense type of hurricane, they can still produce widespread damage and can be life-threatening storms.

Hurricanes that peaked at Category 1 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Juan (1985), Ismael (1995), Danny (1997), Stan (2005), Humberto (2007), Isaac (2012), Manuel (2013), Earl (2016), Newton (2016), Nate (2017), Barry (2019), Lorena (2019), Hanna (2020), Isaias (2020), Nicholas (2021), Julia (2022), Lisa (2022), Nicole (2022), Debby (2024), and Oscar (2024).
===Category 2===

Extremely dangerous winds will cause extensive damage

Storms of Category 2 intensity often damage roofing material, sometimes exposing the roof, and inflict damage upon poorly constructed doors and windows. Poorly constructed signs and piers can receive considerable damage and many trees are uprooted or snapped. Mobile homes, whether anchored or not, are typically damaged and sometimes destroyed, and many manufactured homes suffer structural damage. Small craft in unprotected anchorages may break their moorings. Extensive to near-total power outages and scattered loss of potable water are likely, possibly lasting many days.

Hurricanes that peaked at Category 2 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Alice (1954), Ella (1958), Ginny (1963), Fifi (1974), Diana (1990), Gert (1993), Rosa (1994), Erin (1995), Alma (1996), Marty (2003), Juan (2003), Alex (2010), Tomas (2010), Carlotta (2012), Arthur (2014), Sally (2020), Olaf (2021), Rick (2021), Agatha (2022), and Francine (2024).
=== Category 3 ===


Devastating damage will occur

Tropical cyclones of Category 3 and higher are described as &quot;major hurricanes&quot; in the Atlantic, Eastern Pacific, and Central Pacific basins. These storms can cause some structural damage to small residences and utility buildings, particularly those of wood frame or manufactured materials with minor curtain wall failures. Buildings that lack a solid foundation, such as mobile homes, are usually destroyed, and gable-end roofs are peeled off.

Manufactured homes usually sustain severe and irreparable damage. Flooding near the coast destroys smaller structures, while larger structures are struck by floating debris. A large number of trees are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. Terrain may be flooded well inland. Near-total to total power loss is likely for up to several weeks. Home water access will likely be lost or contaminated.

Hurricanes that peaked at Category 3 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Easy (1950), Carol (1954), Hilda (1955), Audrey (1957), Olivia (1967), Ella (1970), Eloise (1975), Alicia (1983), Elena (1985), Roxanne (1995), Fran (1996), Isidore (2002), Jeanne (2004), Lane (2006), Karl (2010), Otto (2016), Zeta (2020), Grace (2021), John (2024), and Rafael (2024).
===Category 4===

Catastrophic damage will occur

Category 4 hurricanes tend to produce more extensive curtainwall failures, with some complete structural failure on small residences. Heavy, irreparable damage and near-complete destruction of gas station canopies and other wide span overhang type structures are common. Mobile and manufactured homes are often flattened. Most trees, except for the hardiest, are uprooted or snapped, isolating many areas. These storms cause extensive beach erosion. Terrain may be flooded far inland. Total and long-lived electrical and water losses are to be expected, possibly for many weeks.

The 1900 Galveston hurricane, the deadliest natural disaster to hit the United States, peaked at an intensity that corresponds to a modern-day Category 4 storm. Other examples of storms that peaked at Category 4 intensity and made landfall at that intensity include: Hazel (1954), Gracie (1959), Donna (1960), Carla (1961), Flora (1963), Betsy (1965), Celia (1970), Carmen (1974), Madeline (1976), Frederic (1979), Joan (1988), Iniki (1992), Charley (2004), Dennis (2005), Ike (2008), Harvey (2017), Laura (2020), Ida (2021), Lidia (2023), and Helene (2024). 
===Category 5===

Catastrophic damage will occur

Category 5 is the highest category of the Saffir–Simpson scale. These storms cause complete roof failure on many residences and industrial buildings, and some complete building failures with small utility buildings blown over or away. The collapse of many wide-span roofs and walls, especially those with no interior supports, is common. Very heavy and irreparable damage to many wood-frame structures and total destruction to mobile/manufactured homes is prevalent. 

Only a few types of structures are capable of surviving intact, and only if located at least inland. They include office, condominium and apartment buildings and hotels that are of solid concrete or steel frame construction, multi-story concrete parking garages, and residences that are made of either reinforced brick or concrete/cement block and have hipped roofs with slopes of no less than 35 degrees from horizontal and no overhangs of any kind, and if the windows are either made of hurricane-resistant safety glass or covered with shutters. Unless most of these requirements are met, the catastrophic destruction of a structure may occur.

The storm&#x27;s flooding causes major damage to the lower floors of all structures near the shoreline. Many coastal structures can be completely flattened or washed away by the storm surge. Virtually all trees are uprooted or snapped and some may be debarked, isolating most affected communities. Massive evacuation of residential areas may be required if the hurricane threatens populated areas. Total and extremely long-lived power outages and water losses are to be expected, possibly for up to several months.

Historical examples of storms that made landfall at Category 5 status include: &quot;Cuba&quot; (1924), &quot;Okeechobee&quot; (1928), &quot;Bahamas&quot; (1932), &quot;Cuba–Brownsville&quot; (1933), &quot;Labor Day&quot; (1935), Janet (1955), Inez (1966), Camille (1969), Edith (1971), Anita (1977), David (1979), Gilbert (1988), Andrew (1992), Dean (2007), Felix (2007), Irma (2017), Maria (2017), Michael (2018), Dorian (2019), and Otis (2023) (the only Pacific hurricane to make landfall at Category 5 intensity).

==Criticism==
Some scientists, including Kerry Emanuel and Lakshmi Kantha, have criticized the scale as being too simplistic, namely that the scale takes into account neither the physical size of a storm nor the amount of precipitation it produces. They and others point out that the Saffir–Simpson scale, unlike the moment magnitude scale used to measure earthquakes, is not continuous, and is quantized into a small number of categories. Proposed replacement classifications include the Hurricane Intensity Index, which is based on the dynamic pressure caused by a storm&#x27;s winds, and the Hurricane Hazard Index, which is based on surface wind speeds, the radius of maximum winds of the storm, and its translational velocity. Both of these scales are continuous, akin to the Richter scale. However, neither of these scales has been used by officials.

===Proposed extensions===
After the series of powerful storm systems of the 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, as well as after Hurricane Patricia, a few newspaper columnists and scientists brought up the suggestion of introducing Category 6. They have suggested pegging Category 6 to storms with winds greater than . Fresh calls were made for consideration of the issue after Hurricane Irma in 2017, which was the subject of a number of seemingly credible false news reports as a &quot;Category 6&quot; storm, partly in consequence of so many local politicians using the term. Only a few storms of this intensity have been recorded. 

Of the 42 hurricanes currently considered to have attained Category 5 status in the Atlantic, 19 had wind speeds at or greater. Only 9 had wind speeds at or greater (the 1935 Labor Day hurricane, Allen, Gilbert, Mitch, Rita, Wilma, Irma, Dorian, and Milton). Of the 21 hurricanes currently considered to have attained Category 5 status in the eastern Pacific, only 5 had wind speeds at or greater (Patsy, John, Linda, Rick, and Patricia). Only 3 had wind speeds at or greater (Linda, Rick, and Patricia). 

Most storms which would be eligible for this category were typhoons in the western Pacific, most notably typhoons Tip, Halong, Mawar, and Bolaven in 1979, 2019, 2023 and 2023 respectively, each with sustained winds of , and typhoons Haiyan, Meranti, Goni, and Surigae in 2013, 2016, 2020 and 2021 respectively, each with sustained winds of . 

Occasionally, suggestions of using even higher wind speeds as the cutoff have been made. In a newspaper article published in November 2018, NOAA research scientist Jim Kossin said that the potential for more intense hurricanes was increasing as the climate warmed, and suggested that Category 6 would begin at , with a further hypothetical Category 7 beginning at . In 2024 another proposal to add &quot;Category 6&quot; was made, with a minimum wind speed of , with risk factors such as the effects of climate change and warming ocean temperatures part of that research. In the NHC area of responsibility, only Patricia had winds greater than .

According to Robert Simpson, co-creator of the scale, there are no reasons for a Category 6 on the Saffir–Simpson scale because it is designed to measure the potential damage of a hurricane to human-made structures. Simpson explained that &quot;... when you get up into winds in excess of you have enough damage if that extreme wind sustains itself for as much as six seconds on a building it&#x27;s going to cause rupturing damages that are serious no matter how well it&#x27;s engineered.&quot; Nonetheless, the counties of Broward and Miami-Dade in Florida have building codes which require that critical infrastructure buildings be able to withstand Category 5 winds.

<text>The National Hurricane Center (NHC) is the division of the United States&#x27; NOAA/National Weather Service responsible for tracking and predicting tropical weather systems between the Prime Meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast Pacific Ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern Atlantic Ocean. The agency, which is co-located with the Miami branch of the National Weather Service, is situated on the campus of Florida International University in University Park, Miami, Florida.

The NHC&#x27;s Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB) routinely issues marine forecasts, in the form of graphics and high seas forecasts year round, with the Ocean Prediction Center having backup responsibility for this unit. The Technology and Science Branch (TSB) provides technical support for the center, which includes new infusions of technology from abroad. The Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes (CARCAH) unit tasks planes, for research and operational purposes, to tropical cyclones during the Atlantic hurricane season and significant weather events, including snow storms, during winter and spring. Research to improve operational forecasts is done through the Hurricane Forecast Improvement Project (HFIP) and Joint Hurricane Test Bed (JHT) initiatives.

During the Atlantic and northeast Pacific hurricane seasons, the Hurricane Specialist Unit (HSU) issues routine tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific and northern Atlantic oceans. When tropical storm or hurricane conditions are expected within 48 hours, the center issues watches and warnings via the news media and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) Weather Radio.

Although the NHC is an agency of the United States, the World Meteorological Organization has designated it as the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center for the North Atlantic and eastern Pacific, making it the clearinghouse for tropical cyclone forecasts and observations occurring in these areas. If the NHC loses power or becomes incapacitated, the Central Pacific Hurricane Center backs tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the northeast Pacific Ocean while the Weather Prediction Center backs up tropical cyclone advisories and tropical weather outlooks for the North Atlantic Ocean.

==History==
===Early history===
The first hurricane warning service was set up in the 1870s from Cuba with the work of Father Benito Viñes. After his death, hurricane warning services were assumed by the United States Signal Corps and United States Weather Bureau over the next decade, first based in Jamaica in 1898 and Cuba in 1899 before shifting to Washington, D.C., in 1902.

The central office in Washington, which evolved into the National Meteorological Center and Weather Prediction Center (formerly known as the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center), assumed hurricane warning/advisory responsibility at that time. This responsibility passed to regional hurricane offices in 1935, and the concept of the Atlantic hurricane season was established to keep a vigilant lookout for tropical cyclones during certain times of the year. Hurricane advisories issued every six hours by the regional hurricane offices began at this time.

The Jacksonville hurricane warning office moved to Miami, Florida, in 1943. Tropical cyclone naming began for Atlantic tropical cyclones using the Joint Army/Navy Phonetic Alphabet by 1947. In 1950, the Miami Hurricane Warning Office began to prepare the annual hurricane season summary articles. In the 1953 Atlantic season, the United States Weather Bureau began naming storms which reach tropical storm intensity with human names.
The National Hurricane Research Project, begun in the 1950s, used aircraft to study tropical cyclones and carry out experiments on mature hurricanes through its Project Stormfury. On July 1, 1956, a National Hurricane Information Center was established in Miami, Florida, which became a warehouse for all hurricane-related information from one United States Weather Bureau office. The Miami Hurricane Warning Office (HWO) moved from Lindsey Hopkins Hotel to the Aviation Building to the northwest on July 1, 1958. Forecasts within the hurricane advisories were issued one day into the future in 1954 before being extended to two days into the future in 1961, three days into the future in 1964, and five days into the future in 2001. The Miami HWO moved to the campus of the University of Miami in 1964, and was referred to as the NHC in 1965. The Miami HWO tropical cyclone reports were done regularly and took on their modern format in 1964.

===As the National Hurricane Center===

Beginning in 1973, the National Meteorological Center duties (renamed the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center; renamed for a second time in 2013) gained advisory responsibility for tracking and publicizing inland tropical depressions. The World Meteorological Organization assumed control of the Atlantic hurricane naming list in 1977. In 1978, the NHC&#x27;s offices moved off the campus of the University of Miami across U.S. Highway 1 to the IRE Financial Building. Male names were added into the hurricane list beginning in the 1979 season. The hurricane warning offices remained active past 1983.

In 1984, the NHC was separated from the Miami Weather Service Forecast Office, which meant the meteorologist in charge at Miami was no longer in a supervisory position over the hurricane center director. By 1988, the NHC gained responsibility for eastern Pacific tropical cyclones as the former Eastern Pacific Hurricane Center in San Francisco was decommissioned. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew blew the WSR-57 weather radar and the anemometer off the roof of NHC&#x27;s/the Miami State Weather Forecast offices. The radar was replaced with a WSR-88D NEXRAD system in April 1993 installed near Metro Zoo, near where Hurricane Andrew made landfall.

In 1995, the NHC moved into a new hurricane-resistant facility on the campus of Florida International University, capable of withstanding 130 mph (210 km/h) winds. Its name was changed to the Tropical Prediction Center in 1995. After the name change to TPC, the hurricane specialists were grouped as a separate NHC unit under the Tropical Prediction Center, separating themselves from the Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch. On October 1, 2010, the Tropical Prediction Center was renamed the NHC, and the group formerly known as the NHC became known as the Hurricane Specialist Unit (HSU).

Tropical cyclone forecasting uses statistical methods based on tropical cyclone climatology, as well as methods of numerical weather prediction where computers use mathematical equations of motion to determine their movement. The World Meteorological Organization continues to create and maintain the annual hurricane naming lists. Naming lists use a six-year rotation, with the deadliest or most infamous storm names retired from the rotation.

==Organization==
For the fiscal year of 2008, the budget for the NHC was $6.8 million. The NHC staff has 66 members including 12 managers. The NHC is one of nine national centers which compose the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP).

===Hurricane Specialist Unit===

Known as the NHC from 1995 through 2010, the hurricane specialists within the Hurricane Specialist Unit (HSU) are the chief meteorologists that predict the actions of tropical storms. The specialists work rotating eight-hour shifts from May through November, monitoring weather patterns in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific oceans. Whenever a tropical or subtropical cyclone forms, they issue advisories every six hours until the storm is over. Public advisories are issued more often when the storm expected to be of tropical storm or hurricane intensity threatens land. The specialists coordinate with officials in each country likely to be affected. They forecast and recommend watches and warnings.

During the hurricane season, the HSU routinely issues their Tropical Weather Outlook product, which identifies areas of concern within the tropics which could develop into tropical cyclones. If systems occur outside the defined hurricane season, the HSU issues special Tropical Weather Outlooks. Backup responsibility for their northeast Pacific area resides at the Central Pacific Hurricane Center (CPHC), and vice versa if CPHC were to have communication issues. North Atlantic responsibilities are backed up by the Weather Prediction Center (WPC). Routine coordination occurs at 1700 UTC each day between the Weather Prediction Center and National Hurricane Center to identify systems for the pressure maps three to seven days into the future within the tropics, and points for existing tropical cyclones six to seven days into the future. Outside of the hurricane season, the specialists concentrate on public education efforts.

On April 30, 2020, senior hurricane specialist Lixion Avila retired after working at the NHC since 1987. On January 3, 2022, it was announced that senior hurricane specialist Stacy Stewart, who also served in the U.S. Navy reserves, retired after working at the NHC since 1999. He retired due to surgeries and post-surgical effects after being injured in Iraq.

===Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch===

The Tropical Analysis and Forecast Branch (TAFB, formerly the Tropical Satellite Analysis and Forecast unit and the Tropical Analysis Center) is a part of the National Hurricane Center and was created in 1967. The TAFB is responsible for high seas analyses and forecasts for tropical portions of the Atlantic and Pacific between the Prime Meridian and the 140th meridian west poleward to the 30th parallel north in the northeast Pacific Ocean and the 31st parallel north in the northern Atlantic Ocean. Unlike the Hurricane Specialist Unit (HSU), TAFB is staffed full-time around the year. Other responsibilities of the TAFB include satellite-derived tropical cyclone position and intensity estimates, WSR-88D radar fixes for tropical cyclones, tropical cyclone forecast support, media support, and general operational support. The Ocean Prediction Center backs up TAFB in the event of a communications outage, and vice versa.

===Technology and Science Branch===
The Technology &amp; Science Branch (TSB) develops and transitions new tools and techniques into operations for tropical weather prediction in conjunction with other government and academic entities. TSB created and continues development of the Automated Tropical Cyclone Forecasting (ATCF) system, used to incorporate various data and model outputs, create and update HURDAT, and to generate tropical cyclone forecasts. The TSB provides support for NHC computer and communications systems including its website. TSB maintains a number of statistical and dynamical models used in predicting both tropical cyclone behavior and associated weather conditions. The Storm Surge Unit, which develops and maintains software to forecast the storm surge of tropical cyclones, is part of this branch. The Techniques Development and Applications Unit (TDAU) is part of TSB.

===CARCAH===
The Chief, Aerial Reconnaissance Coordination, All Hurricanes (CARCAH) is a subunit of the 53d Weather Reconnaissance Squadron (Hurricane Hunters). CARCAH&#x27;s mission is to provide a point-of-contact and to coordinate all tropical cyclone operational reconnaissance requirements at NHC and the Central Pacific Hurricane Center for the North Atlantic, Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico, and the North Pacific basin east of the International Date Line in accordance with the National Hurricane Operations Plan (NHOP). During the winter, CARCAH coordinates the Atlantic and Pacific winter storm requirements in support of the National Winter Storms Operations Plan (NWSOP). Missions are flown in advance of the high-impact weather events forecast to affect the U.S., such as heavy snowfall, and at times when there is significant uncertainty within/between numerical weather prediction output.

===HLT===
The Hurricane Liaison Team (HLT) supports hurricane response through information exchange between the NHC, the National Weather Service (NOAA/NWS), and the emergency management community. The HLT is composed of federal, state, and local emergency managers, as well as NWS meteorologists and hydrologists, who maintain open lines of communication about the progress and threat level of the storm with appropriate Federal, state, and local officials. The team establishes and facilitates video and/or teleconferences with the NHC, FEMA and other Federal agencies, state Emergency Operations Centers (EOCs), Weather Prediction Center (WPC), Storm Prediction Center (SPC), and River Forecast Centers (RFCs). During significant landfalling hurricanes, the president of the United States as well as affected city mayors and state governors join the daily briefing call, which occurs at noon Eastern Daylight Time.

==Research==
As part of their annual tropical cyclone activity, the agency issues a &quot;tropical cyclone report&quot; on every tropical cyclone in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific Ocean basins, which are available since 1958 and 1988, respectively. The report summarizes the synoptic history, meteorological statistics, casualties and damages, and the post-analysis best track of a storm. The reports were formally known as Preliminary Reports up until 1999. The agency maintains archives and climatological statistics on Atlantic and Pacific hurricane history, including annual reports on every tropical cyclone, a complete set of tropical cyclone advisories, digitized copies of related materials on older storms, season summaries published as the Monthly Weather Review, and HURDAT, which is the official tropical cyclone database.

Programs are dedicated to improving the accuracy of tropical cyclone forecasts from the center. The Joint Hurricane Testbed (JHT) is a joint operation between the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and United States Weather Research Program to speed up the transfer of tropical cyclone-related research into forecast operations. Since 2001, with its annual budget of between $1.0 and $1.5 million, the JHT has funded 62 initiatives, with most of them being implemented operationally. The projects have had varied success, ranging from minor to significant advances in the way the NHC operates. The Hurricane Forecast Improvement Program&#x27;s (HFIP) five-year goal is to lead to a 20 percent improvement within the numerical weather prediction models provided by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction to NHC by 2015 and a 50 percent improvement within tropical cyclone track forecasting and intensity guidance by 2020.

<doc id="255318" wikidata="Q3019313" url="?curid=255318" title="Day for Night (The Tragically Hip album)">
<text>Day for Night is the fourth studio album by the Canadian rock band The Tragically Hip. It is named for the film of the same name.

==Commercial performance==
The album was very successful in Canada, with domestic sales of 300,000 units within four days of its release, while not seeing a U.S. release until February 14, 1995. It was the band&#x27;s first album to debut at #1 on the Canadian Albums Chart. The album has been certified 6× platinum in Canada. Promotional tours for the album included stints touring with The Rolling Stones and Page and Plant. In the Netherlands, &quot;Day for Night&quot; peaked at #70.

==&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;==
The band appeared on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; in 1995, thanks in large part to the finagling of fellow Canadian and Kingston-area resident Dan Aykroyd. A fan of the band, Aykroyd appeared on the show just to introduce them, despite John Goodman being the host of the episode. The band performed two songs from &quot;Day for Night&quot;, &quot;Grace, Too&quot; and &quot;Nautical Disaster&quot;.

==Critical reception==

In &quot;Have Not Been the Same&quot;, the authors note that &quot;the initial response was mixed&quot; due to the &quot;darkness&quot; of the album and its stemming &quot;from the unconscious.&quot;. Although AllMusic.com&#x27;s rating is a lukewarm 3 out of 5, the review calls the album&#x27;s &quot;signature lyrical mysteries... lush, but much more dark-spirited&quot; than previous albums. &quot;&quot;Day for Night&quot; stands on the minimalism of Downie&#x27;s poignancy -- nothing is overproduced and the songs themselves are left alone to arrive on their own.&quot; In &quot;Chart&quot;, Jason Schneider wrote that this was the album that made The Tragically Hip more than &quot;just a rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll band... miraculously, the vast distances they had been absorbing for the previous five years merged with the equally limitless vistas of Gord Downie&#x27;s imagination via a Daniel Lanois-inspired sonic canvas. &quot;Day For Night&quot; got inside the Canadian psyche in a terrifying way that simple nationalistic tall tales never could. The songs remain gloriously impenetrable, but their landscapes feel like home.&quot;

In &quot;ChartAttack&#x27;s&quot; three Top 50 Canadian Albums of All Time polls, the album placed #37 in 1996, #13 in 2000 and #21 in 2005.

<doc id="255336" wikidata="Q5089480" url="?curid=255336" title="Cheez TV">
<text>Cheez TV is an Australian children&#x27;s cartoon show hosted by Ryan Lappin and Jade Gatt that aired on weekday mornings on Network Ten. It began broadcasting on 10 July 1995 and it ended on 31 December 2004 with the presenters leaving. After eight months of being without presenters, it officially ended on 20 August 2005, and was replaced with &quot;Toasted TV&quot;.

In January 2016, Lappin and Gatt launched the official Cheez TV Facebook page with the help of friend and podcaster Brendan Dando. The page features full episodes of the show from its original run, behind the scenes photos and competitions.

&quot;Cheez TV&quot; was the first show in Australia to have an internet address in 1995.

Gatt and Lappin reunited during 2017 and started a brief Twitch series called Cheez Live where they played video games, shared reviews of movies, read fan mail, or just had fun hanging out with their viewers. Despite it being popular, they reformatted it into a Youtube channel and podcast called The Jade and Ryan Show in 2018, which didn&#x27;t last for very long. Before the year ended, the pair announced the cancellation of the show and went their separate ways (similar to what happened to the end of the original TV show). It is unknown what the cause of the breakup was, and they have since deleted all of their social media websites, however the official Cheez TV Facebook Fan page still operates. Their last public appearance was hosting the Australian &#x27;SO POP&#x27; music festival in February 2019.

==History==
Initially competing against &quot;Agro&#x27;s Cartoon Connection&quot; on the Seven Network, the younger youth hosts, &#x27;edgier&#x27; feel, and larger focus on showing cartoons allowed Ten to take the early morning children&#x27;s TV crown off Seven.

During the show&#x27;s run, Ryan Lappin was once nominated for &quot;Cleo&quot; magazine&#x27;s Bachelor of the Year only to lose to Australian swimmer Geoff Huegill. Jade Gatt also hosted late night music show &quot;Ground Zero&quot;.

During the later years of the show, Lappin and Gatt&#x27;s editorials were quickly becoming notorious for their use of more adult-oriented humour.

On 20 August 2005, the last episode of &quot;Cheez TV&quot; was broadcast after 10 years on the air, although Lappin and Gatt&#x27;s final on-air appearance took place on 31 December 2004. In 2005, only cartoons showed during &quot;Cheez TV&quot;. It was later replaced with &quot;Toasted TV&quot; in the same time slot, which continues to screen series such as &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot; and &quot;Winx Club&quot;.

In 2010, a Facebook event scheduled for 7 October 2010 appeared, attempting to gain interest in a Cheez TV reunion show. It quickly attracted the attention of Cheez TV fans. Jade and Ryan both had an interview with the E Team from U20 Radio Station which aired on 7 August 2010, where they briefly spoke to Peter Styles about the Facebook group and the show. However, after the group sent hundreds of petitioned emails to the networks, third parties made complaints which led to Facebook closing the group. It is unknown whether any consideration has been taken in relation to a &quot;Cheez TV&quot; reunion by any network contacted.

On 28 June 2011, the Adelaide Anime and Videogame Convention AVCon announced Cheez TV presenters Ryan Lappin and Jade Gatt as special guests. The pair appeared in multiple guest panels throughout the weekend.

On 22 January 2016, Ryan and Jade launched the official Cheez TV Facebook page with the help of friend and podcaster Brendan Dando, co-host of the Simpsons podcast &#x27;Four Finger Discount&#x27;, after Lappin discovered all of the tapes containing the episodes in his garage. The page features old episodes of the show as well as some new programming from Lappin and Gatt. Throughout all of 2016, the pair made appearances during Supanova Expo events at all locations held. 
On 30 July 2017, Ryan and Jade started doing livestreams on Twitch, performing an impromptu version of the show called Cheez Live which involved chatting with fans, reviewing movies, reading fan-mail, talking about old Cheez TV memories and streaming video games. Despite being popular with its audience, it ended abruptly within the year and was changed to an episodic YouTube format called The Jade &amp; Ryan Show for unknown reasons. The duo also hosted the live concert event So Pop in Australia during the year 2019. When the Twitch version of the show ended the channel was deleted. However, for undisclosed reasons, the YouTube version of the show ended after Gatt and Lappin announced a hiatus, with the last video being uploaded to the channel on 24 March 2019, of their producer turning off the studio lights and shutting doors. The show has since ended. The YouTube show lasted a shorter time than the Twitch streams, although it was not a live broadcast. A podcast called The Jade And Ryan Podcast was also recorded and released during 2018. As of 2023 they have not done anything new since.
Plans for Ryan Lappin to return to Twitch was made but the show never materialized. They also deleted their entire social media presence, with their last posts respectively being in 2019.

==Programming==
&quot;Cheez TV&quot; had programming from a variety of different studios. Many of its shows were sourced from Saban Entertainment, before the company folded in the early 2000s. The two presenters, Jade Gatt and Ryan Lappin, editorialised and presented small variety segments in between cartoons. These short segments included parodies of &quot;Rove Live&quot;, &quot;Gardening Australia&quot;, &quot;Men in Black&quot; and numerous music video re-enactments. On occasion the hosts would interview special guests as well. For a period on &quot;The Big Cheez&quot; Gatt and Lappin were joined by another presenter, Lenka Kripac (member of Australian band Decoder Ring).

&quot;Cheez TV&quot; also aired during Saturday morning under the moniker of The Big Cheez.

<text>Sir Anerood Jugnauth, GCSK, PV, (29 March 1930 – 3 June 2021) was a Mauritian statesman, politician and barrister who served both as President and Prime Minister of Mauritius. He was Member of Parliament for Piton &amp; Riviere Du Rempart. The central figure of Mauritian politics in the 1980s and early 1990s, he was Leader of the Opposition from 1976 to 1982. He served four consecutive terms as prime minister from 1982 to 1995 and again from 2000 to 2003. He was then elected as President from 2003 to 2012. Following his party&#x27;s victory in the 2014 general elections, he served his sixth and final term as prime minister, becoming the nation&#x27;s longest serving prime minister with more than 18 years of tenure, overtaking Seewoosagur Ramgoolam, who held the office for 14 years.

Under Jugnauth&#x27;s leadership, his party/alliances won 5 general parliamentary elections in a row in 1976, 1982, 1983, 1987, and 1991. He then led the MMM in its first electoral campaign and was presented as prime minister in 1976. The MMM won but could not govern due to a hung parliament and Jugnauth became Leader of the Opposition up to 1982 where the MMM-PSM alliance won all the seats. He became prime minister up to 1995. He was appointed again as prime minister in 2000 and finally as President in 2003.

Jugnauth was a cabinet minister during the leadership of Sir Seewoosagur Ramgoolam from 1965 up to 1969. In 1970, he moved out and went to the newly created political party of the Mauritian Militant Movement, where he eventually became its leader in 1982. He created his own political party called Militant Socialist Movement in 1983 and was once more elected. His party remained in power up to 1995.

Jugnauth founded the Militant Socialist Movement party in 1983. He was honoured with Pravasi Bharatiya Samman Awards for his continued support for India&#x27;s causes and concerns and for strengthening India&#x27;s relationship with Mauritius. Following his tenure as President, Jugnauth led an alliance known as &quot;L&#x27;Alliance LEPEP&quot; which won the 2014 general elections. He resigned in January 2017 and was succeeded by his son Pravind Jugnauth as prime minister.

Jugnauth was made Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1980 and was made a member of the Privy Council in 1983. He was knighted by Queen Elizabeth II in 1988 when Mauritius was still one of the Queen&#x27;s realms.

==Early career and education==

Anerood Jugnauth was born in Palma, Mauritius in a Bhojpuri speaking Hindu Indo-Mauritian family belonging to the Ahir broader Yadav community and was brought up there. His grandfather had migrated to Mauritius from the Ballia District of Indian state of Uttar Pradesh in the 1870s. He had his primary education at Palma Primary School and his secondary education at Regent College. He taught for some time at New Eton College and later worked as a clerk in the Poor Law Department for some time before being transferred to the Judicial Department. In 1951, he left Mauritius for the UK to study law at the Lincoln&#x27;s Inn, and became a lawyer in 1954.

==Councillor==

In 1957, Jugnauth was elected President of Palma Village Council. Whilst serving as an IFB member of Legislative Council he was also elected as member of the Municipal Council of Vacoas-Phoenix.

==1963 elections==

Jugnauth was elected for the first time to the Legislative Council in Constituency No. 14 of Riviere du Rempart at a time when there were 40 Constituencies in the island in October 1963 and was candidate of the Independent Forward Bloc (IFB).

In 1964, he was one of the founders of All Mauritius Hindu Congress but continued to serve in Seewoosagur Ramgoolam&#x27;s government as State Minister for Development from 1965 to 1966. He was then promoted to Minister of Labour in November 1966. He took part in the London Constitutional Conference on Mauritius, also commonly known as the 1965 Lancaster Conference. He resigned from office in April 1967, joined the Civil Service as Magistrate, and did not take part in the August 1967 General Elections. In 1970 he joined the MMM and became the party&#x27;s president.

==1976 elections==

The main contenders of the 1976 elections were the Independence Party (alliance of Mauritian Labor Party and the CAM), PMSD, UDM, IFB and the relatively new MMM led by Paul Bérenger and Jugnauth himself. Despite receiving most of the votes (38.64%) the MMM only secured 34 seats, two short of an absolute majority. The Independence Party scored 37.90% of votes and 28 seats, whilst the PMSD received 16.20% of the votes and 8 seats. By re-establishing its former alliance, which it had since 1969 with the PMSD, Ramgoolam managed to stay in power. The Labour-PMSD-CAM alliance occupied 36 seats with a weak majority of only 2 seats, despite CAM&#x27;s leader Sir Abdool Razack Mohamed&#x27;s failure to be re-elected. Jugnauth thus served as Leader of the Opposition until the following general elections in 1982.

==1982-1995 Prime minister tenure==

From 1976 to 1982, the MLP had been weakened by the defection of part of its coalition partner, the PMSD, while the CAM declined to contest the election. The MMM had formed an alliance with Harish Boodhoo&#x27;s Parti Socialiste Mauricien known as PSM. The election resulted in a landslide victory for the MMM-PSM alliance (formed by Jugnauth and Berenger in early 1981), which won 64.16% of the vote and all 60 elected seats (42 by the MMM, 18 by the PSM, and two for the allied Organisation du Peuple Rodriguais) (for more detail see 1982 Legislative Assembly election results). Voter turn-out was 87.3%, with 471,196 out of an electorate of 540,000 casting their votes for the 34 parties contesting 62 seats. The LP, which had dominated Mauritian politics since 1948, won no seats and (together with the Muslim Action Committee) only 25.78% of the vote. The PMSD did even worse, receiving only 7.79% of the vote. The LP and the PMSD each did eventually receive two seats in parliament under the best-loser provisions.

Jugnauth became Prime Minister of Mauritius for the first time, Boodhoo Deputy Prime Minister, and Paul Bérenger Minister of Finance. Jugnauth being prime minister announced general elections in 1983 again. This time he was not a candidate for the MMM but he proposed to Boodhoo dissolving the PSM to make a new stronger Party called the MSM (Militant Socialist Movement). He created the MSM and in Alliance with the Mauritian Labour Party went to the general elections together trying to fight against Berenger and his MMM. In March 1983, the government collapsed when the dominant faction within the MMM [Mouvement Militant Mauricien], led by Bérenger, split from Jugnauth&#x27;s leadership and resigned from the cabinet.

In early April 1983, Jugnauth formed a new party, the Mouvement Socialiste Militant (MSM), which, in May, amalgamated with the PSM led by Harish Boodhoo. However, the new government lacked a majority in the legislative assembly, and Jugnauth dissolved the National assembly in June. New elections were held on 23 August 1983. Jugnauth was re-elected and returned as prime minister of the MSM-PMSD-Labour alliance, defeating the MMM.

The MMM received 209,845 votes (46.4%) – the highest proportion of the vote ever received by a single party in any Mauritian election. The Alliance received 236,146 votes (52.22%); independents and the Rodrigues parties got the remaining 1.38% and two seats. Of the 552,800 registered voters, 452,221 (81.8%) had voted. When seats were distributed, however, the Alliance held a majority – 46 to the 22 received by the MMM. The disproportionate weighting of seats reflects the fact that MMM votes were concentrated in urban constituencies where large numerical majorities won only three seats, whereas the Alliance swept the rural constituencies where Hindus predominated.

Within months of taking office, the Alliance began a process of fragmentation that by 1986 left the government without a working majority in parliament. When in February 1984, the MLP (Mauritius Labour Party) left the government, 11 of its MPs continued to support the government and formed a faction within the MLP called the &quot;Rassemblement des Travaillistes Mauriciens&quot; (RTM). Upon proroguing parliament in November 1986, Jugnauth agreed that an election was necessary.

Parliament was dissolved on 3 July, and the election date set for 30 August 1987, one year ahead of schedule. Campaigning started on 22 July 1987. Jugnauth&#x27;s Alliance fought the election with his MSM (Militant Socialist Movement), Duval&#x27;s MPSD (&quot;Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate&quot;), and both major factions of the MLP, the one led by Satcam Boolell and the RTM. The MMM allied itself with two small parties, the &quot;Mouvement Travailliste Démocrat&quot; (RTD) and the &quot;Front des Travailleurs Socialiste&quot; (FTS). A total of 639,488 voters were registered (approximately 60% of the total population) and of these, 546,623 (85.5%) cast their votes. A total of 359 candidates ran for the 62 elected seats. During the election campaign, the ruling MSM/MLP/PMSD alliance was known as the Sun (Soleil) and the opposing union (composed of MMM/MTD/FTS) as the Heart (Coeur) after their respective emblems.

While overall participation of voters in the polling amounted to 85.5%, it ran up to 93% in some constituencies. The average size of the multimember constituencies was around 30,000. As in previous elections, the MMM and its partners received the highest percentage of votes, 48.12%, of which a small percentage can be attributed to its two small partners (see 1987 Legislative Assembly election results for more detail). It won 21 seats, comprising 19 of the 30 urban seats, and only two of the 30 rural seats. The Alliance (MSM/PMSD/MLP) won a total of 49.86% and 39 seats. After the best-loser seats were allocated, the Alliance held 46 seats to the MMM&#x27;s 24. The two seats of the Organisation du Peuple Rodriguais helped to raise those of the Alliance to 46.

On 6 August 1991, Jugnauth dissolved the national assembly and announced that a general election would be held on 15 September, nearly a year early. Jugnauth led an alliance of his MSM (Militant Socialist Movement) with the MMM (Mauritian Militant Movement) and the RTD (&quot;Rassemblement des Travaillistes Mauriciens&quot;) against an alliance of the MLP (Mauritius Labour Party) and the PMSD (&quot;Parti Mauricien Social Démocrate&quot;). The MSM/MMM/RTD alliance was better prepared than the opposition. Before the election date had been announced, it had already drawn up its list of candidates for the 20 constituencies and published its election manifesto. The opposition lost valuable time with lengthy negotiations concerning candidates and manifesto. Some 25 parties and independents and 331 candidates were involved. According to official figures, 682,000 voters (about 63% of the total population of 1,083,000) were entitled to vote, and of these about 576,300 (84.5%) turned out. The government alliance&#x27;s 56.3% of the vote gave it 57 seats in parliament, while the opposition&#x27;s 39.9% of the vote gave it only three seats. Only four best-loser seats were allocated. Jugnauth once more ruled in Parliament House for a fourth term, and was once more elected prime minister.

==1995 and onwards==

When Jugnauth lost a vote of confidence over a language issue that required an amendment to the constitution, he dissolved parliament on 16 November 1995 and called a snap election for 20 December. Candidates had to be nominated by 4 December, and the campaign was officially opened on 5 December. A record 506 candidates entered the fray in which some 42 parties and independents participated. A landslide victory for the opposition ended Jugnauth&#x27;s rule as prime minister which had lasted since 1982. The Labour Party-Mauritian Militant Movement (MMM) alliance captured all 60 of the directly elected seats on the island of Mauritius with only 63.7% of the poll, representing a mere 51.1% of the total electorate. The two seats on the island of Rodrigues went to &quot;l&#x27;Organisation du Peuple de Rodrigues&quot; (OPR). The MSM-RMM alliance obtained 19.3% of the votes cast or the support of 15.4% of the total electorate, but even under the best-loser system it found itself without a single seat in the National Assembly. (&quot;Renouveau Militant Mauricien&quot; (RMM) was the name adopted by a substantial part of the MMM led by Dr. Prem Nababsing (after Bérenger had broken away from it in 1993 and retained the right to the name of MMM).

Only four best-loser seats were allocated and went to small parties with little national influence – two to the &quot;Mouvement Rodriguais&quot; in Rodrigues island and the other two respectively to the Hizbullah Party and the &quot;Parti Gaëtan Duval&quot; (PGD, formerly the PMSD). Jugnauth stood as a candidate at the by-election held in constituency No. 9 (Flacq/Bon Acceuil) in April 1998 but was defeated. He immediately initiated the idea of an MSM/MMM federation which eventually took shape in January 1999. The Federation was dissolved, however, after the defeat of its candidate at the by-election held on 19 September 1999.

Jugnauth founded the MSM/MMM Alliance with Bérenger, leader of the MMM, on 14 August 2000, based on equal sharing of power. At the general elections held on 11 September 2000, he was elected as first member of constituency No 7 (Piton/Rivière du Rempart) and was appointed prime minister.

==2000 tenure as Prime minister==

The outgoing prime minister, Navin Ramgoolam of the Mauritian Labor Party led a coalition with Xavier-Luc Duval, the leader of the &quot;Parti Mauricien Xavier Duval&quot; (PMXD). Duval was Minister of Finance in the previous government alliance formed in mid-1999. The other alliance was formed (for the fourth time) between Jugnauth (MSM) and Bérenger (MMM).

On 15 August 2000, the leaders of these two parties as well several other leaders from much smaller parties signed what they termed a &#x27;historical electoral accord&#x27;, which included a proposed sharing of the prime ministerial post between MSM leader Jugnauth and MMM leader Bérenger. Under this arrangement, Jugnauth would hold the post of prime minister for the first three years and Bérenger for the remaining two years. After surrendering the premiership to Paul Bérenger, Jugnauth would be called to assume the function of President of the Republic after reforms to strengthen the presidency, which was largely a symbolic post. The accord also provided for a reform of the electoral system to replace the &quot;best losers system&quot; gradually by proportional representation, and to end the Mauritius Broadcasting Corporation&#x27;s monopoly over the electronic media.

In addition to sharing the post of prime minister, what made the MSM/MMM electoral accord exceptional was the fact that it would allow, for the first time in the history of the island, a non-Hindu Mauritian to become the prime minister. The elections took place on 11 September 2000 with a total of 80.87% of registered voters casting their ballots. The MSM/MMM alliance won 54 of the directly elected seats.

Jugnauth agreed to step down and become president as from 2003. Former president Karl Offmann was also involved. He was put into the office of the president on the condition that he would remain president only for 19 months. Jugnauth became president under the transition with the so-called &quot;sudden&quot; resignation of President Offmann.

Jugnauth resigned as prime minister on 30 September 2003 at 13:30 and also as member of parliament at 15:00, giving his resignation letter to Speaker of the House on the same day. He announced his departure in a 20-minute speech given to the members of parliament stating that he was leaving the office to make room for a new prime minister.

He was sworn into the presidency on 7 October 2003 following the resignation of President Karl Offmann.

==Presidential mandates==

Jugnauth, along with Lady Jugnauth, took over the keys of the Chateau of Reduit on 7 October 2003. His election to the presidency was largely approved by the entire population as it was considered to be the new era of Mauritian politics, allowing Paul Berenger to become prime minister who was the first person of a non-Hindu religion to become head of government.

In 2003, he handed the leadership of his party to his son Pravind Jugnauth. He announced that he had &quot;reached the end of this road&quot;. During his first mandate, due to the constitution, he had to announce general elections, which eventually took place in July 2005.

Due to the end of the mandate of Jugnauth, two persons, Vice President (Angidi Chettiar) and himself were the two persons nominated to the Presidency. He was voted for by both governing members of parliament as well as opposition MPs. Jugnauth was elected to the ceremonial post of President in 2003. After five years in office, he was re-elected by the National Assembly in a unanimous vote on 19 September 2008, supported by both the government and the opposition.

==2008–2014==

Parliament voted for Jugnauth to remain as President for a second term in 2008. Shortly after, during the by-election of 2008 in constituency No 8, the Militant Socialist Movement won with the support of the Labour Party and Pravind Jugnauth returned as MP for that constituency.

In 2010, two days after his 80th birthday, the Labour-MSM-PMSD alliance was made and Navin Ramgoolam dissolved the parliament in respect of general elections. The alliance won the election and the MSM returned 13 MPs. However, in August 2011, the alliance broke and the MSM left the government leaving a very small majority for the prime minister. After having a private meeting with Berenger, the leader of the opposition, Jugnauth made a statement that he might resign as president if the situation got any worse concerning the Medpoint scandal which involved his son, Pravind, and who was summoned and arrested by the Independent Commission Against Corruption on conflict of interest. Eventually he resigned as president on 30 March 2012. He mentioned that he did not support government policies, many thought his disagreement stemmed from the fact that the government refused to help his son, accused of corruption, escape from the law. He stated that he resigned because of his disagreement with the members of the government.

Soon after his resignation from the Presidency in 2012, Berenger proposed a &#x27;remake&#x27; of the MSM/MMM coalition, which was approved by both parties&#x27; structures (political bureaus and central committees). Jugnauth became leader of the alliance with the same conditions. He would hold office of prime minister for three years before resigning to make way for Berenger. Following internal crisis between both parties in 2013 and early 2014, Berenger announced two &#x27;cooling off&#x27; periods to allow time to resolve these issues. Berenger announced the end of the MSM/MMM in April 2014. He was criticized as he had (on the eve) attended Jugnauth&#x27;s birthday party and gave a very flattering speech on his political career. After the party, he went in the same night to meet Ramgoolam at a nearby restaurant to discuss a forthcoming alliance. He further announced an alliance between his MMM and Ramgoolam&#x27;s Labour Party.

==General elections (2014)==

In April 2014, Paul Berenger announced the dissolution of the coalition due to major disagreement within both parties. Later Berenger announced a coalition between the Labour Party and the Mauritian Militant Movement. Jugnauth then led a coalition composed of the Militant Socialist Movement, PMSD and the ML which is a break-away group of individuals who resigned from the MMM due to the coalition with the Labour Party. Jugnauth&#x27;s alliance known as &quot;L&#x27;Alliance LEPEP&quot; won the 2014 general elections. When Ramgoolam dissolved parliament in end of November 2014, Jugnauth and the MSM conducted an alliance with the PMSD and Mouvement Liberateur (a dissident MMM party led by its former Deputy Leader, Ivan Collendaveloo). His alliance won 47 out of the 60 seats contested. Jugnauth became prime minister for the sixth time and made history as he led an alliance that won against a Labour Party-MMM alliance, which are considered as the two biggest parties (through their significant electorates) in the country. The MSM which lost much of its rural electorate was since Jugnauth&#x27;s retirement considered the third national party. It nevertheless got its core electorate (from the 1980s) back following its appeal to vote for Jugnauth for a last time as he announced it would be the last election he would contest due to his advanced age.

On 12 September 2016, Jugnauth announced that he would be resigning as prime minister very soon due to his advanced age. On 23 January 2017 he resigned and made his son the prime minister.

==Assassination attempts==

Overall, there have been 4 attempts on Sir Anerood Jugnauth&#x27;s life. Two of those attempts were whilst he held office. The first one during his tenure was on 6 November 1988 at an Arya Samaj gathering in the suburb of Trèfles, Rose Hill by Satanand Sembhoo who drew a pistol to Prime Minister Jugnauth&#x27;s head before being disarmed by bodyguards and onlookers. This was followed by a second attempt on 3 March 1989 at a temple in Ganga Talao when armed with a razor blade and disguised as a Hindu pilgrim, Iqbal Ghani assaulted Prime Minister Jugnauth. Both attempts were believed to be the result of drug cartels, against whom Jugnauth was leading a crack-down.

==Personal life==

Jugnauth was the owner of a building company on Mauritius, located at the Sun Trust Building situated at La Rue Edith Cavell, Port Louis. This building was the subject of controversies and critics as the owner leased its floor space at high prices which were achieved at the peak of the local property market&#x27;s cycle. The Government&#x27;s Ministry of Education department was a tenant of the Sun Trust Building until 1995 when newly elected Minister, James Burty-David, refused to use that building. The government then relocated the department into another building. The penalty paid to Jugnauth in terms of breach of contract amounted to Rs 45 million (US$1.5 million).

He was the patriarch of the Jugnauth family of Mauritius. Jugnauth married Sarojini Ballah on 18 December 1956 and he is the father of two children: Pravind and Shalini Jugnauth-Malhotra. Pravind has been Prime Minister of Mauritius since 2017 and was previously Minister of Finance as a Member of Parliament for the Constituency Moka &amp; Quartier Militaire. Pravind is also the leader of the Mouvement Socialiste Militant (MSM).

He was also the only Mauritian who served as an elected member on each level in the country as he first served as village &amp; town Councillor (being elected as a Councillor for Palma village in 1956 and again Councillor for the town of Vacoas-Phoenix in 1964). He then served as a Member of Parliament (elected in 1963), became Minister of State in 1965 which preceded his appointment as Minister of Labour in 1966 by Seewoosagur Ramgoolam. He was the only prime minister to have had a sibling and his son in his own cabinet from 2000 to 2003.

On 3 June 2021, Jugnauth died at Clinique Darné in Floréal, Mauritius, aged 91, due to illness.

==Controversies==

Jugnauth was subjected to various controversies over his 35 years of being on the front bench of Mauritian politics. In 1983, he was criticized for breaking the MMM-PSM coalition government and ousting the MMM from power. In 1984, he was criticized as head of government in the Amsterdam boys scandal which involved 4 government MPs who were arrested as they were carrying drugs from the Netherlands. He prorogued parliament in an objective to prevent any questions on the investigation. In 1988, he fired Satcam Boolell, then leader of the Labour Party, due to political disagreements.

In May 1992, a scandal erupted when the Bank of Mauritius issued a new Rs 20 note having the portrait of Sarojini Jugnauth. It was considered to be a birthday gift from Anerood to his wife. This was a major controversy whereby Jugnauth himself had to apologise in parliament to a private notice question from the opposition. He confirmed that he had reluctantly agreed to the proposal of the Bank of Mauritius to issue such a note. He expressed his sincere apologies and assured the population that he shall not commit such a mistake in the future.

In 1995, months before the general elections which Jugnauth would lose, the then government gave a contract to Sun Trust Building (owned by the Jugnauth family) for a period of 10 years. This was controversial as Jugnauth was the owner of the Building and at the same time was prime minister. The newly elected Labour Party-MMM government decided to rescind the contract. Jugnauth sued for damages and received Rs 45 million (US$1.5 million) as compensation. This was criticized in the press and among the Mauritian diaspora.

In 2007, Jugnauth threatened to have Mauritius leave the Commonwealth in protest at the UK&#x27;s &quot;barbarous&quot; treatment of the people of the Chagos Islands. Jugnauth stated that he might take the United Kingdom to the International Court of Justice over the islanders&#x27; plight. The Chagos Islands, a British colony in the Indian Ocean, were leased to the US in the 1960s to build a military base. The residents were forced out, and the government says they cannot return, but have been granted British citizenship and has donated around 40 million pounds to the people who numbered 2,000 at the time. Many of the residents now live in poverty in Mauritius as that state has left them destitute, or as refugees in Britain where they have their housing and costs paid for, and receive financial aid to take the British to court. The American base was built on the large island of Diego Garcia within the Chagos archipelago. Mauritius claims the islands as part of its territory, and Jugnauth claimed his country was forced by the British to accept the Chagossians as a condition of independence.

<text>Spin City is an American sitcom television series that aired from September 17, 1996, to April 30, 2002, on ABC. Created by Gary David Goldberg and Bill Lawrence, the show is set in a fictionalized version of the New York City mayor&#x27;s office, and originally starred Michael J. Fox as Mike Flaherty, the Deputy Mayor of New York. Fox departed in 2000 at the conclusion of the fourth season due to symptoms of Parkinson&#x27;s disease, and Charlie Sheen became the new lead as Charlie Crawford for the final two seasons.

==Premise==
The series presents a fictionalized version of the local government of New York City, and follows its mayor Randall Winston (Barry Bostwick) and his staff as they run the city, although the main person in charge is Deputy mayor Mike Flaherty (Fox). Mike is talented at his job, dealing with political spin and office chaos, but not so good managing his personal life, which he neglects. Other members of staff at City Hall include press secretary Paul Lassiter (Richard Kind), the office snitch and a manipulative coward, who has a habit of being a troublemaker and is often kept in the dark about things; chief of staff Stuart Bondek (Alan Ruck), who thinks of himself as a lothario and is highly sexist; and head of minority affairs Carter Heywood (Michael Boatman), a gay black man with a suicidal dog named Rags.

Also on the staff are speech writer James Hobert (Alexander Chaplin), who is weak-willed and gullible; Mike&#x27;s secretary Janelle Cooper (Victoria Dillard), who is no-nonsense, pragmatic, and slightly apathetic towards the general chaos of her work; and accountant Nikki Faber (Connie Britton), who has a comically healthy relationship with her mother and often talks to her openly about sex and other taboo subjects. Janelle later becomes the mayor&#x27;s secretary and Stacey Paterno (Jennifer Esposito) joins the show as Mike&#x27;s secretary and Paul&#x27;s nemesis. Together, this group helps run City Hall, improves the Mayor&#x27;s image, and covers for his frequent mistakes—while sorting out their own personal issues.

At one point in development, the show was simply called &quot;Spin&quot;, which was changed when ABC was unable to secure rights to the name from the similarly-named magazine. At the start of the series, Mike is dating reporter Ashley Schaeffer (Carla Gugino). In early promos for the series, the relationship was shown to be the main premise of the show. Midway through the first season, however, Mike and Ashley separated and her character was written out.

The nature of Carter and Stuart&#x27;s relationship became a running gag during the series. The two ended up becoming so close, their friendship was mocked by others, and their arguments sounded so much like husband and wife, a whole episode was dedicated to the notion that the two argued like a married couple. The two ended up meeting an older duo of best friends (one black and one white) who were virtual twins of Carter and Stuart in terms of personality; when it was discovered that the two older versions had become a couple, it ended up scaring Stuart quite a bit. For his part, Stuart tends to be very protective of his time with Carter, going so far as to be genuinely jealous when Carter spends more time with new campaign manager Caitlin (Heather Locklear). In spite of all the jokes and flirtations, they prove to be best friends willing to do anything for each other. This, too, was considered an important moment in television history, with essayist and poet Orville Lloyd Douglas noting, &quot;I love the fact that the writers of &quot;Spin City&quot; explored the fact that gay men and heterosexual men can be friends. The straight man doesn&#x27;t have to worry that the gay man might hit on him.&quot;

===Later years===
In 1998, Michael J. Fox announced he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease. As a result, a new character, Caitlin Moore (Locklear) was introduced at the start of the 1999–2000 season to help lessen Fox&#x27;s workload. Caitlin was Mayor Winston&#x27;s campaign manager as he decided to run for Senator, and much conflict occurred between Mike and Caitlin about who was in charge of the mayor. Their relationship was more complex than a simple feud, and hints were dropped that it would become romantic.

In 2000, as his symptoms got more severe, Fox announced he was leaving the show at the end of the season to spend more time with his family and to raise awareness of Parkinson&#x27;s. His character left City Hall at the end of the show&#x27;s fourth season, taking the blame for an alleged Mafia link the mayor unknowingly had. A brief coda to the fourth-season finale revealed that the character moved to Washington, D.C., becoming an environmental lobbyist and there meeting a young senator named Alex P. Keaton, the character Fox played on &quot;Family Ties&quot;. Executive producer and co-creator Bill Lawrence also left the show, along with a few cast members and writers/producers.

The remaining producers decided to carry on the series with a new lead. For the show&#x27;s fifth season, Charlie Sheen, as new Deputy Mayor Charlie Crawford, joined Caitlin, Paul, Stuart, Carter, and the mayor. The characters of Nikki, James, and Janelle were written out, to be replaced by assistant Angie Ordonez (Lana Parrilla), although she left without explanation before the show&#x27;s sixth and final season. With the change of the lead character, also came a change in its production location, from Fox&#x27;s home in the New York City area to Los Angeles. The show would carry on with Sheen for two seasons, with ABC canceling the series in May 2002.

==Characters==
*Michael J. Fox as Mike Flaherty. Deputy Mayor of New York and a playboy, Flaherty lives in a New York City bachelor pad and is constantly balancing his personal life and his job, trying to maintain a healthy distance between the two. Flaherty leaves the mayor&#x27;s office at the end of season four, after taking the blame for an unknown mob connection the Mayor had. (Fox left the series due to Parkinson&#x27;s disease, but returns during the first three episodes of the sixth season, culminating in his marriage.)
*Richard Kind as Paul Thomas Lassiter, press secretary at City Hall. A known troublemaker and childish member of the group, he is often the victim of practical jokes or mishaps at City Hall. In season 4 he made several comebacks by winning the top prize at Who Wants to Be a Millionaire, being interviewed by a hometown newspaper in disclosing he had gone to the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism and worked for Congressman Chuck Schumer. During the show he marries Claudia Sachs, who in season five leaves him to become a nun. By the end of the show, he moves into an apartment across the hall from Carter and Stuart.
*Alan Ruck as Stuart Bondek, chief of staff at City Hall. He is narcissistic and a love-rat, although he is unsuccessful at maintaining a relationship. Early on in the series, he moves into an apartment with Carter, which generates a rivalry as he is a homophobe and is generally uncomfortable around Carter&#x27;s dog and his uptight lifestyle, though they eventually become best friends.
*Michael Boatman as Carter Heywood, head of Minority Affairs at City Hall. His character was met with positive reaction because of his portrayal as a prominent gay black character in a TV series. Carter owns a suicidal old dog named Rags, who dies towards the end of the series. In the same season, Carter decides he will adopt a baby; in the final episode he welcomes a boy named Sam.
*Connie Britton as Nikki Faber, a co-worker at City Hall. She is confident and free-spirited, often dates dangerous men, and is repeatedly harassed by her family to get married. She develops an on/off relationship with Mike. She leaves after season four for unknown reasons.
*Alexander Chaplin as James Leonard Hobert III, a speech writer at City Hall. He is shown to be anxious and shy, and early in the show has a crush on Nikki. During season four, he is fired in favor of Caitlin being hired as marketing campaigner, and James is hired as Mike&#x27;s secretary, although he is led to believe his position is as &#x27;Deputy Deputy Mayor&#x27;. He also leaves after season four for unknown reasons.
*Barry Bostwick as Mayor Randall Winston, the inept Mayor of New York City. It is stated that he was a state assemblyman sometime prior to his election as mayor. At one point during the show he runs for the Senate, although between seasons he apparently changed his mind. He is married at the beginning of the show but gets divorced during its run and his ex-wife writes a tell-all book about life with the Mayor. He develops a relationship with his secretary Janelle during season three. During the final season, he develops a relationship with Judge Claire Simmons (Farrah Fawcett), but she dumps him when she reveals she does not want to live life in the public eye.
*Victoria Dillard as Janelle Cooper, Mike&#x27;s secretary during the first season, promoted to the Mayor&#x27;s secretary during the second. She develops a relationship with the Mayor during season three. She leaves after season four for unknown reasons.
*Jennifer Esposito as Stacey Paterno, who replaced Janelle as Mike&#x27;s secretary for seasons two and three after Janelle became the Mayor&#x27;s secretary. She is from Brooklyn and is shown to be very outgoing, much like Nikki. She leaves after season three for unknown reasons.
*Heather Locklear as Caitlin Moore, introduced into the show in season four to lessen Michael J. Fox&#x27;s screentime after he announced he had Parkinson&#x27;s disease. She is brought onto the staff as marketing campaigner, and takes James&#x27; old desk, while James becomes Mike&#x27;s secretary. She becomes romantically involved with both leads by the end of each of their respective tenures on the show.
*Charlie Sheen as Charlie Crawford, Mike&#x27;s replacement for the final two seasons. He, too, is a playboy and at first struggles to keep his troubled past from getting in the way of his new position. He eventually becomes romantically involved with Caitlin by the end of the series&#x27; run. He is also romantically involved with Jennifer Duncan, played by Sheen&#x27;s real-life partner at the time, Denise Richards; his father is also played by Sheen&#x27;s real-life father Martin Sheen.
*Carla Gugino as Ashley Schaeffer, a journalist and love interest for Mike during the first half of Season 1 (12 episodes). She was written out when the show started to focus more on the workplace, but returned for one episode in season three.
*Lana Parrilla as Angie Ordonez, Charlie&#x27;s secretary. She was only featured in season five, as Parrilla left following the season, thinking her character was underused. No secretary is shown during season six, and her desk is left empty. Some of the cast are shown using it, albeit not permanently, implying Charlie is no longer using a secretary.
*Taylor Stanley as Karen, a college intern who works as Mike&#x27;s assistant in the first season.
*Paula Marshall as Mike&#x27;s girlfriend and - briefly - fiancée, Laurie Parres, in Season 2.
*Beth Littleford as Stuart&#x27;s girlfriend, Deirdre West, in Seasons 3 &amp; 4.
*Heidi Klum as herself (or a version of herself) who dates Mike in Season 3 and also appears briefly in Season 4.

<text>The Labour Party (; , A or Ap; ), formerly The Norwegian Labour Party (, DNA), is a social democratic political party in Norway. It is positioned on the centre-left of the political spectrum, and is led by Jonas Gahr Støre. It was the senior party in a minority governing coalition with the Centre Party from 2021 until the Centre Party&#x27;s exit from government in 2025, with Støre serving as the current Prime Minister of Norway.

The Labour Party is officially committed to social-democratic ideals. Its slogan since the 1930s has been &quot;everyone shall be included&quot; () and the party traditionally seeks a strong welfare state, funded through taxes and duties. Since the 1980s, the party has included more of the principles of a social market economy in its policy, allowing for privatisation of state-owned assets and services and reducing income tax progressivity, following the wave of economic liberalisation during the 1980s. During the first Stoltenberg government, the party&#x27;s policies were inspired by Tony Blair&#x27;s New Labour agenda in the United Kingdom and saw the most widespread privatisation by any government in Norway to that date. The party has frequently been described as increasingly neoliberal since the 1980s, both by political scientists and opponents on the political left. The Labour Party profiles itself as a progressive party that subscribes to co-operation on a national as well as international level.

Its youth wing is the Workers&#x27; Youth League. The party is a member of the Party of European Socialists and the Progressive Alliance. It was formerly member of the Comintern (1919–1923), the International Revolutionary Marxist Centre (1932–1935), the Labour and Socialist International (1938–1940), and the Socialist International (1951–2016). The Labour Party has always been a strong supporter of Norwegian NATO membership and has supported Norway joining the European Union during two referendums. During the Cold War, when the party was in government most of the time, the party closely aligned Norway with the United States at the international level and followed an anti-communist policy at the domestic level in the aftermath of the 1948 Kråkerøy speech and culminating in Norway becoming a founding member of NATO in 1949.

Founded in 1887, the party steadily increased in support until it became the largest party in Norway at the 1927 parliamentary election, a position it has held ever since. That year also saw the consolidation of conflicts surrounding the party during the 1920s following its membership in the Comintern. It first formed a government in 1928 and has led the government for all but sixteen years since 1935. From 1945 to 1961, the party had an absolute majority in the Norwegian Parliament, to date the last time this has happened in the history of Norway. The electoral domination by the Labour Party during the 1960s and early 1970s was initially broken by competition from smaller left-wing parties, primarily from the Socialist People&#x27;s Party. From the late 1970s, the party started to lose voters due to a rise in right-wing parties, leading to a swing to the right for the Labour Party under Gro Harlem Brundtland during the 1980s. In 2001, the party achieved its worst result since 1924. Between 2005 and 2013, Labour returned to power after committing to a coalition agreement with other parties in order to form a majority government. Labour entered opposition again after losing nine seats in 2013. The party lost a further six seats in 2017, yielding the second-lowest number of seats since 1924. At the 2021 election, the party lost one seat but the left-wing opposition gained a majority over the political right, with Støre becoming the prime minister and heading a minority government along with the Centre Party.

== History ==
=== Founding and early years ===

The party was founded in 1887 in Arendal and first ran in elections to the Storting in 1894. It entered the parliament in 1903 and steadily increased its vote until 1927, when it became the largest party in Norway. The party were members of Communist International (Comintern), a communist organisation, between 1918 and 1923.

From the establishment of &quot;Vort Arbeide&quot; in 1884, the party had a growing and notable organisation of newspapers and other press outlets. The party press system eventually resulted in &quot;Norsk Arbeiderpresse&quot; (&quot;Norwegian Labour Press&quot;). In January 1913, the party had 24 newspapers and six more newspapers were founded in 1913. The party also had the periodical &quot;Det 20de Aarhundre&quot;. In 1920, the party had 33 newspapers and 6 semi-affiliated newspapers. The party had its own publishing house, Det norske Arbeiderpartis forlag, succeeded by Tiden Norsk Forlag. In addition to books and pamphlets, Det norske Arbeiderpartis forlag published &quot;Maidagen&quot; (annual May Day publication), &quot;Arbeidets Jul&quot; (annual Christmas publication) and &quot;Arbeiderkalenderen&quot; (calendar). The party also published a monthly political magazine, &quot;Kontakt&quot;, between 1947 and 1954 which was edited by Torolf Elster.

From its roots as a radical alternative to the political establishment, the party grew to its current dominance through several eras. The party experienced a split in 1921 caused by a decision made two years earlier to join the Comintern and the Social Democratic Labour Party of Norway was formed. In 1923, the party left the Comintern while a significant minority of its members left the party to form the Communist Party of Norway. In 1927, the Social Democrats were reunited with Labour. Some Communists also joined Labour whereas other Communists tried a failed merger endeavor which culminated in the formation of the &quot;Arbeiderklassens Samlingsparti&quot;. The same year, Helga Karlsen became the party&#x27;s first Member of Parliament.

In 1928, Christopher Hornsrud formed Labour&#x27;s first government, but it lasted only two weeks. During the early 1930s, Labour abandoned its revolutionary profile and set a reformist course. Labour then returned to government in 1935 and remained in power throughout the Second World War. The party was a member of the Labour and Socialist International between 1938 and 1940. When Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, the Labour-led government and the Norwegian royal family fled to London, whence it led a government-in-exile for the duration of the war.

=== Post-war period ===
Immediately following the end of the Second World War, the Labour Party emerged victorious from the 1945 Norwegian parliamentary election. For the first time, the party secured an absolute majority in the Storting, taking 76 of 150 seats. Einar Gerhardsen of the Labour Party subsequently formed his first government, and he went on to dominate the post-war political scene over the following years. Gerhardsen is commonly referred to as &quot;Landsfaderen&quot; (Father of the Nation) and is generally considered one of the principal architects behind the reconstruction of Norway after the Second World War. The period from 1945 has been described as the golden age of the Norwegian Labour Party, and the party retained its parliamentary majority until the 1961 election. In 1963, the Kings Bay Affair drove the opposition to table a motion of no-confidence against the Gerhardsen&#x27;s cabinet; the motion was ultimately successful, and Labour was forced to step down from government for the first time in 28 years. However, the incoming centre-right coalition proved short-lived, and Labour returned to government less than one month later, and remained in office until 1965.

The Labour Party later formed government in the periods of 1971–1972, 1973–1981, 1986–1989, and 1990–1997. Labour prime ministers in this period included party veterans Oscar Torp, Trygve Bratteli, and Gro Harlem Brundtland, and the party remained the largest in Norway throughout the remainder of the 20th century.

=== 21st century ===

In the year 2000, the centre-right coalition led by Kjell Magne Bondevik of the Christian Democrats was toppled in a confidence vote, and the Labour Party returned to power under Jens Stoltenberg, who became prime minister. However, after a period of intense infighting between Stoltenberg and former prime minister Thorbjørn Jagland, and a turbulent spell in government, the party collapsed to only 24.3% of the vote in the 2001 Norwegian parliamentary election, marking its worst result since 1924. The party returned to the opposition under Stoltenberg&#x27;s leadership, before later recovering to 32.7% in the 2005 Norwegian parliamentary election. The Labour Party subsequently formed its first ever peace-time coalition government along with the Socialist Left and Centre parties. Their cooperation was dubbed the Red-green coalition, in emulation of similar constellations in Germany.

In 2011, the party changed its official name from the Norwegian Labour Party (&quot;Det norske arbeiderparti&quot;) to the Labour Party (&quot;Arbeiderpartiet&quot;). The party claimed there had been confusion among voters at polling stations because of the difference between the official name and the common use name of Labour Party. The name change caused &quot;Arbeiderpartiet&quot; to appear on the ballot, eliminating any potential confusion. On 22 July 2011, terrorist Anders Behring Breivik opened fire at the Labour Party&#x27;s youth camp (ages 13–25), killing 69 people and killing eight more in Oslo with a bomb towards a government building (which was led by the Labour Party). Stoltenberg&#x27;s initial response to the 22 July attack was well received by the Norwegian public. As he reaffirmed his government&#x27;s commitment to the values of openness and tolerance in the face of adversity or intolerance his approval rating soared as high as 94%, only to decrease sharply after the 22 July Commission report highlighted the laggard response time of police cost dozens of lives.

In the 2013 Norwegian parliamentary election, the Red-green coalition lost its majority in the Storting, but the Labour Party remained the largest party in the Storting. Jens Stoltenberg, who had served as prime minister for 10 of the past 13 years, remained party leader until he stepped down in 2014 after being appointed Secretary General of NATO. Later, Jonas Gahr Støre, a prominent profile in the Stoltenberg government, was chosen as new party leader on 14 June 2014. In the 2017 Norwegian parliamentary election, he led the party to a surprise defeat, as Labour fell 3.4 percentage points to 27.4%, and from 55 to 49 seats in the Storting, while the Conservative Party managed to retain a majority along with its smaller centre-right partners. Erna Solberg, Conservative prime minister since 2013, remained in office throughout the 2017—2021 term. In the same year, the Labour Party was targeted by hackers suspected to be from Russia.
In 2021, the Labour Party returned to government after eight years in opposition, following the 2021 Norwegian parliamentary election. The party dropped to 48 seats from the 49 it had secured in 2017, but its centre-left coalition secured a landslide victory overall, taking 100 of the 169 seats in the Storting. The energy crisis was the most important issue for voters. Party leader Jonas Gahr Støre assumed the Norwegian premiership on 14 October 2021, at the helm of a minority coalition with the Centre Party. Soon after assuming power, the new coalition was faced with a series of crises, including the Russian invasion of Ukraine and subsequent energy price hikes. The government was criticized for its handling of these crises, and by August 2022, Støre had dropped to 31% in preferred prime minister polling, against 49% for Erna Solberg, the Conservative prime minister in the 2013—2021 period. Meanwhile, the Labour Party hit record-low ratings in voting intention polls in late 2022, with a number of polls placing it below the 20%-mark in September 2022.

== Organisation ==

The Labour Party organisation is divided into county- and municipality-level chapters, numbering approximately 2,500 associations in total. Historically, the party has maintained a close association with the Norwegian Confederation of Trade Unions (LO), and until the mid-1990s, a dual-membership agreement existed between the two organizations, with LO members automatically holding (indirect) membership in the Labour Party as well. The party had about 200,500 members at its peak in 1950. No records were kept about direct membership or indirect membership figures. The dual-membership clause was scrapped in 1995, and that year its membership level fell to just over 72,500 from 128,000 in 1990. In 1997, that figure dropped to 64,000 in 1997. In 2021, the party comprised 45,553 members according to its own official website. Since 2005, the party has maintained a policy requiring full gender parity at every level of organisation above ordinary membership.

The supreme body of the party is the Party Congress which is held every two years. The most senior body between these congresses is the National Delegate&#x27;s Meeting which is made up of the party&#x27;s Executive Board and two delegates from each of the 19 counties. The Executive Board itself consists of 16 elected members as well as the leadership of the party. The party is headed by a single leader, while the number of deputy leaders has fluctuated between one and two in different periods. As of 2022, the party leadership is made up of leader Jonas Gahr Støre, who has held the position since 2014, and deputy leader Bjørnar Selnes Skjæran, who was first elected to the position in 2021.

The party&#x27;s youth organisation is the Workers&#x27; Youth League, and it maintains a women&#x27;s wing known as the Labour Party Women&#x27;s Network. The party participates in elections to the Sami Parliament of Norway, and work related to this has its own organisational structure with seven local groups, a bi-yearly congress, a national council and the Labour group in the Sami parliament.

He was given to the custody of his music teacher and friend of his father, Jean-François Tiby (1772–1844). De Bériot began studying violin with Tiby, who trained him in the French style as exemplified by Giovanni Battista Viotti. In 1811 he performed for the first time in public, playing a concerto by Viotti. François-Joseph Fétis says that Tiby sent de Bériot to Paris at the age of 12 (1814), however de Bériot&#x27;s own correspondence confirms that he only arrived in Paris in 1821. This mistake is attributed to the advanced age at which Fétis wrote his final biographical note on de Bériot. While in Paris, de Bériot studied briefly at the Paris Conservatory under Pierre Baillot and played for Rodolphe Kreutzer and Viotti. The latter encouraged de Bériot to &quot;..listen a lot...and take what seems good to you, be like the bees and you will create a genre...&quot;

After being refused a subsidy by William I of the Netherlands, he returned briefly to Belgium in 1822. The following year he returned to Paris where he taught and performed. In 1824 he made a concert tour in England and was named violinist to Charles X of France in 1826 and in 1827, solo violinist at the court of William I of the Netherlands.

De Bériot and Niccolo Paganini&#x27;s careers ran parallel for many years even though de Bériot was 20 years younger than Paganini. In much of northern Europe the two virtuoso&#x27;s playing styles were often compared, including in a small publication which appeared in 1831.

De Bériot lived with the opera singer Maria Malibran and had a child (Charles-Wilfrid de Bériot, a piano professor who taught Maurice Ravel, Ricardo Viñes, Enrique Granados and others) with her in 1833. They were married in 1836 when Malibran obtained an annulment of her previous marriage. Felix Mendelssohn wrote an aria accompanied by a solo violin especially for the couple. However, Malibran died the same year from injuries sustained in a fall from a horse.

After Malibran&#x27;s death, de Bériot lived in Brussels and did not return to performance until 1838. In 1840 in Vienna he married Marie Huber, daughter of a local magistrate.

In 1842, Pierre Baillot died in Paris at the age of 71, and his position as instructor at the Paris Conservatoire was offered to de Bériot. He rejected the offer, however, and in 1843 became chief violin instructor at the Brussels Conservatory where he established the Franco-Belgian school of violin playing. On account of failing eyesight he retired in 1852, and in 1858 became totally blind.
Paralysis of the left arm ended his career in 1866. Surgeons amputated his left arm to relieve pain. Among his students were Hubert Léonard, Henri Vieuxtemps and Heinrich Wilhelm Ernst.

==Compositions==
De Bériot composed a great amount of violin music including ten concertos. Although these are now rarely heard, his pedagogical compositions are still of use for violin students. In style, however, he was greatly influenced by the works of Rudolphe Kreutzer.

De Bériot&#x27;s pioneering violin technique and Romantic style of composition make his concertos and etudes an important stepping stone for the serious violin student wishing to gain a firm foundation before studying the major concertos of the Romantic era. His most popular concertos are No. 9 in A minor Op. 104 and No. 7 in G major Op. 76.

Itzhak Perlman released a recording of Scene de Ballet, Op. 100 on his album, &quot;Concertos from My Childhood&quot;. This recording features the Juilliard Orchestra conducted by Lawrence Foster. Barbara Barber also released a recordings and sheet music with piano accompaniment of the first movement of de Beriot&#x27;s Concerto No. 9 in A minor Op. 104 and Scene de Ballet, Op. 100 with her series, &quot;Solos for Young Violinists&quot;.

Schirmer publishes his Violin Method Op. 102 and His &quot;First 30 Concert Studies&quot; Op. 123. Peters publishes the famous encore piece for violin and orchestra (in a reduced format for violin and piano) &quot;Scene de Ballet&quot; Op.100.

<text>The governor () or governor-general () of the Habsburg Netherlands was a representative appointed by the Holy Roman emperor (1504-1556), the king of Spain (1556-1598, 1621-1706), and the archduke of Austria (1716-1794), to administer the Burgundian inheritance of the House of Habsburg in the Low Countries when the monarch was absent from the territory. The role of the governors-general significantly changed over time: initially tutors and advisors of Emperor Charles V, who lived at the Palace of Coudenberg, they served as generals during the Eighty Years&#x27; War between the Kingdom of Spain and the Dutch Republic. Frequently, the governor-general was a close relative of the Austrian or Spanish monarchs, though at other times Spanish or German noblemen filled the role. The governor-general was usually based in Brussels.

== List of governors ==
Thereafter, the French revolutionaries occupied the Low Countries until 1815. The Emperor formally recognized the loss of these territories by the Treaty of Lunéville of 1801. At the Congress of Vienna, in 1815, the Low Countries were re-united in a personal union under the House of Orange-Nassau. In 1830, Belgium declared its independence.

<doc id="255347" wikidata="Q234069" url="?curid=255347" title="Mikoyan MiG-27">
<text>The Mikoyan MiG-27 (; NATO reporting name: Flogger-D/J) is a variable-sweep ground-attack aircraft, originally built by the Mikoyan-Gurevich design bureau in the Soviet Union and later licence-produced in India by Hindustan Aeronautics as the Bahadur (&quot;Valiant&quot;). It is based on the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23 fighter aircraft, but optimised for air-to-ground attack. Unlike the MiG-23, the MiG-27 did not have widespread use outside Russia, as most countries opted for the Mikoyan-Gurevich MiG-23BN and Sukhoi Su-22 instead. As of late 2023, all Russian, Indian, Sri Lankan, Ukrainian, and Kazakh MiG-27s have been retired, bringing the type&#x27;s service to an end.

==Design and development==
The MiG-27 shares the basic airframe of the MiG-23, but with a revised nose – nicknamed &quot;Utkonos&quot; (&quot;Platypus&quot;) or &quot;Krokodil Gena&quot; in Russian service, first introduced on the MiG-23B. Dissatisfaction with the MiG-23BN led to the further development of the basic airframe to accommodate a stronger undercarriage, simpler intakes and a shorter exhaust nozzle, without radar in favour of a downward-sloping profile for improved pilot visibility, a laser rangefinder and marked-target seeker. Among its test pilots, it was also called &quot;Balkon&quot; (&quot;Balcony&quot;) because of the increased frontal view from the cockpit. Additional cockpit armor was installed, along with a totally new nav/attack system.

Since the MiG-27 was intended to fly most of its missions at low altitude, the MiG-23&#x27;s variable intake ramps and exhaust nozzles were discarded in favor of a simpler fixed configuration, reducing weight and maintenance requirements. The aircraft also has larger, heavy-duty landing gear to facilitate operation from poorer-quality airfields. In accordance with the MiG-27&#x27;s strike and low-level attack requirements, provisions were made to mount missiles and precision-guided munitions, as well as retaining a nuclear capability in line with other Soviet combat aircraft by introducing specialized navigation systems.

The improved MiG-27M/D versions were introduced during the 1980s, followed by the -K version, which could carry a much larger range of weapons including tactical nuclear bombs.

Aircraft deployed to Afghanistan were upgraded with the installation of BVP-50-60 flare dispensers and the NAZ-7B emergency survival kit, as well as engine modifications for the hot and high conditions.

==Operational history==
The MiG-27 saw service with the Soviet Air Force in Afghanistan. Although several Western observers considered the MiG-27 widely exported, confusing it with the MiG-23BN, the aircraft type was only exported to India and Sri Lanka which also utilized the MiG-27 in regional conflicts.

=== Soviet Union ===
The MiG-27 entered frontline service with Soviet Air Force Tactical Aviation in 1975, with the 722nd Regiment. It replaced earlier MiG-23B/BN and outdated Sukhoi Su-7 attack aircraft and equipped 22 of the 40 Soviet fighter-bomber regiments, being deployed all over the Soviet Union and other Warsaw Pact countries. Soviet MiG-27s were permanently deployed to five foreign countries: East Germany, Hungary, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Mongolia until the 1990s.

Soviet forces used the MiG-27 during the later stages of the Afghanistan conflict in 1987–89, which was the only time the Soviets used this aircraft in action. During the initial stages of the war, MiG-27s were not deployed to support ground troops in combat, as the Sukhoi Su-17s of the Turkestan and Central Asian military districts together with DRAAF Su-7s were considered sufficient to support the 40th Army&#x27;s operations against the Afghan Mujahideen. However, in 1988 it was decided to deploy MiG-27s to support the existing forces in theatre. The 134th APIB, formed of three squadrons of MiG-27D/Ms and MiG-23UB trainers, was deployed to Shindand Air Base in October after extensive training in Kazakhstan. The most modern variant, the MiG-27K, was not deployed due to its lack of armour for the pilot. MiG-27s, in common with all other Soviet attack aircraft in the conflict, were limited in effectiveness by the 5,000 metre (16,400 ft) minimum altitude imposed due to the threat from MANPADs. As such they were only able to deploy unguided bombs and rockets against Afghan targets. Missions included bombing of supply convoys, night bombing of troop concentrations, scattering landmines with cluster munitions, and marking or illuminating targets for artillery with SAB-100 flare bombs. The 134th regiment remained in Afghanistan until the Soviet withdrawal, taking part in the siege of Kandahar. They were withdrawn on the 4th February 1989, flying to Kalay-Mor airbase in the Turkmen SSR where they waited in reserve until March of that year, when they returned to their home base in Kazakhstan.

Around the same time, MiG-27s started to be gradually replaced by more advanced Sukhoi Su-24 and Su-25 aircraft in the ground attack role at home. Other MiG-27 units, such as the 642nd GvAIP, re-equipped with MiG-29 fighters.

Additionally, between 1990 and 1994 a single regiment of MiG-27s (the 88th Separate Fighter Bomber Regiment) served with Soviet Naval Aviation as a way to save the unit from being dissolved under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe.

By the collapse of the Soviet Union, a number of MiG-27s remained in service. These would then be inherited by the air forces of the various former Soviet republics.

=== Russian Federation ===
The Air Force of the Russian Federation inherited most of the Soviet MiG-27s. However, on 1 July 1993 the Air Force decreed that single-engined attack aircraft such as the MiG-27 were to be phased out.

===Sri Lanka===
MiG-27 aircraft entered service with the Sri Lanka Air Force in 2000, with the purchase of four remanufactured MiG-27s from Ukrinmash in May 2000 at US$1.75 million each. This was followed by another ordered for two more in October 2000 at US$1.6 million and a MiG-23UB trainer aircraft for US$900,000. Initially piloted by Ukrainian pilots until local pilots could be trained and was attached to the No. 5 &quot;Jet&quot; Squadron SLAF. During the Eelam War III phase of the Sri Lankan Civil War, they saw considerable action bombing targets and providing close air support. In August 2000, a MiG-27 crashed near Colombo International Airport, killing its Ukrainian pilot. In July 2001, a second MiG-27 was destroyed and another damaged on the ground during an assault on the same air force base by the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. A MiG-27 crashed into the sea near the airport in June 2004. With the resumption of hostilities in 2006 as peace talks broke down and the Eelam War IV phase of the war starting, MiG-27 were once again flying combat sorties. In 2007, three MiG-27s and a MiG-23UB trainer were overhauled as part of a life-extension program. Four MiG-27s were purchased at US$10 million. This led to the MiG deal scandal. The MiG-27s and the MiG-23UB were reorganized into the newly formed No. 12 Squadron. Another MiG-27 fighter jet crashed on a routine training mission on 13 February 2012 near the Dummalasuriya area at around 1.35 pm. The pilot managed to eject from the jet without sustaining injuries.

===India===
On 27 May 1999, during the Kargil War, one Indian MiG-27L suffered an engine flameout while firing 80 mm rockets, possibly due to a MANPADS hit. Its pilot, Kambampati Nachiketa, ejected and was captured by Pakistani forces.

In mid-February 2010, India grounded its entire fleet of over 150 of the aircraft after a MiG-27 crashed on 16 February 2010 in Siliguri, West Bengal. The crash was attributed to defects in the R-29 engines of the aircraft, suspected to have occurred during the overhauling of the aircraft by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL). Another MiG-27 crashed in the Barmer area on 27 January 2015.

India retired the last MiG-27ML squadron on 27 December 2019, when the last two MiG-27 squadrons were retired with a ceremony at Jodhpur airbase.

===Kazakhstan===
12 MiG-27s remained in service with the Kazakh Air Force until 2023 or so. In October 2023, the aircraft were retired and put up for auction. In April 2024, the &quot;Kyiv Post&quot; reported that the US purchased 81 aircraft to transfer to Ukraine. The Kazakh state-owned weapons importer and exporter Kazspetexport denied such claims, saying that foreign companies were not allowed to bid.

==Variants==

;MiG-23B
The first Flogger attack variant was powered by the AL-21F. Only 24 were produced, due to a lack of engines (the AL-21F was destined for the Sukhoi Su-17/22 and the Su-24 Fencer). It was armed with the GSh-23L cannon, carrying 200 rounds.

;MiG-23BN
Derived from the MiG-23B, but powered by the R29B-300 engine. This gave the advantage of making this variant exportable (the AL-21F was a restricted engine at the time, unlike the R29B-300). The R29B-300 also offered commonality with the MiG-23MS and MiG-23MF fighter variants already sold to the rest of world. It was armed with the GSh-23L cannon, with 200 rounds.

;MiG-27 (MiG-23BM)
This was the first in the MiG-27 family to have a canopy without the central frame, suggesting that the ejection seat was designed to directly break through the transparency. The dielectric head above the pylon on the MiG-23 was used on the MiG-27 to house electro-optical and radio-frequency gear instead. It was also the first variant armed with a Gryazev-Shipunov GSh-6-30M Gatling gun. Its NATO reporting name was &quot;Flogger-D&quot;.

;MiG-27K

NATO reporting name: &quot;Flogger-J2&quot;. The MiG-27K was the most advanced Soviet variant, with a laser designator and compatibility with TV-guided electro-optical weapons. It carried the GSh-6-30 cannon. Around 200 were built.

;MiG-27M
NATO reporting name: &quot;Flogger-J&quot;. This model was a cheaper variant than the MiG-27K, but much better than the MiG-23B, MiG-23BN, and MiG-27 (MiG-23BM), with the electro-optical and radio-frequency heads above the glove pylons deleted. It was first armed with the GSh-6-23M Gatling gun, but this was later replaced by a new 30 mm GSh-6-30 six-barrel cannon with 260 rounds of ammunition in a fuselage gondola. It also received much-improved electronic countermeasure (ECM) systems, and a new PrNK-23K nav/attack system providing automatic flight control, gun firing, and weapons release. However, this modification was not very successful because of the heavy recoil from the new cannon, and bursts longer than two or three seconds often led to permanent damage to the airframe. Test pilot V. N. Kondaurov described the first firing of the GSh-6-30А: &quot;As I imposed the central mark on the air target and pressed the trigger to shoot, I heard such noise that I involuntarily drew my hand aside. The whole plane began to vibrate from the shooting and had almost stopped from the strong recoil of the gun. The pilotless target, which was just making a turn ahead of me, was literally disintegrating into pieces. I have hardly come to my senses from unexpectedness and admiration: This is a calibre! Such a beast! If you hit something — it will be plenty enough [to wipe it out]&quot;. A total of 200 MiG-27Ms were built from 1978 to 1983, plus 160 for India. Sri Lanka used second-hand Soviet MiG-27Ms.

;MiG-27D

All MiG-27Ds are MiG-23BMs upgraded to MiG-27M standard. It is very difficult to distinguish from the MiG-27M. 305 were upgraded.

;MiG-27ML

This was an export variant of the MiG-27M provided in 1986 to India in knock-down kits for licensed assembly. It was the same as the MiG-27M, except the undernose fairing for the infra-red search and track (IRST) sensor had a single window instead of several, like the one on the original MiG-27M. A total of 150 were assembled by India. India refers to this model as the MiG-27M &quot;Bahadur&quot;, while MiG-27L is the Mikoyan export designation.

;MiG-27H

This was a 1988 indigenous Indian upgrade of its license-assembled MiG-27Ls with French avionics, which provides the same level of performance, but with much reduced size and weight. The capabilities of the aircraft are being enhanced by the incorporation of modern avionics systems consisting primarily of two Multi-Function Displays (MFDs) Mission and Display Processor (MDP), Sextant Ring Laser Gyros (RLG INSI), combined GPS/GLONASS navigation, HUD with UFCP, Digital Map Generator (DMG), jam-resistant Secured Communication, stand-by UHF communication, data link and a comprehensive Electronic Warfare suite. A mission planning and retrieval facility, VTR and HUD Camera will also be fitted. The aircraft retains stand-by (conventional) instrumentation, including artificial horizon, altimeter and airspeed indicator, to cater for the failure of HUD and the MFDs. The MiG-27s are also being equipped with the French Agave or Russian Komar radar. The installation of the radar would give the MiG-27 anti-ship and some air-to-air capability. It is expected that at least 140 of the 180 aircraft will be converted from MiG-27MLs.

==Operators==

===Former operators===

<text>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language (AHD) is a dictionary of American English published by HarperCollins. It is currently in its fifth edition (since 2011).

Before HarperCollins acquired certain business lines from Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in 2022, the family of American Heritage dictionaries had long been published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt and its predecessor Houghton Mifflin. The first edition appeared in 1969, an outgrowth of the editorial effort for Houghton Mifflin&#x27;s &quot;American Heritage&quot; brand of history books and journals. The dictionary&#x27;s creation was spurred by the controversy during the 1960s over the perceived permissiveness of the &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; (1961). A college dictionary followed several years later. The main dictionary became the flagship title as the brand grew into a family of various dictionaries, a dictionary-thesaurus combination, and a usage guide.

== History ==
James Parton (1912–2001) was a grandson of the English-born American biographer James Parton (1822–1891). He was the founder, publisher and co-owner of the magazines &quot;American Heritage&quot; and &quot;Horizon&quot;, and was appalled by the perceived permissiveness of &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third&quot;, published in 1961. (Webster&#x27;s Third presented all entries without labeling any as nonstandard or informal, or so it was widely claimed. In fact, the dictionary did apply the labels slang, substandard and nonstandard, but in the view of critics, not often enough and with insufficient disapproval.) Parton tried to buy the G. and C. Merriam Company so that he could undo the changes. When that failed, he contracted with Houghton to publish a new dictionary. The &quot;AHD&quot; was edited by William Morris and relied on a usage panel of 105 writers, speakers, and eminent persons chosen for their well-known conservatism in the use of language. However, Morris made inconsistent use of the panels, often ignoring their advice and inserting his own opinions.

==Linguistics==
The &quot;AHD&quot; broke ground among dictionaries by using corpus linguistics for compiling word frequencies and other information.

Citations were based on a million-word, three-line citation database prepared by Brown University linguist Henry Kučera.

==Usage panel==
For expert consultation on words or constructions whose usage was controversial or problematic, the American Heritage Dictionary relied on the advice of a usage panel. In its final form, the panel comprised nearly 200 prominent members of professions whose work demanded sensitivity to language. Former members of the usage panel include novelists (Isaac Asimov, Barbara Kingsolver, David Foster Wallace and Eudora Welty), poets (Rita Dove, Galway Kinnell, Mary Oliver and Robert Pinsky), playwrights (Terrence McNally and Marsha Norman), journalists (Liane Hansen and Susan Stamberg), literary critics (Harold Bloom), columnists and commentators (William F. Buckley Jr. and Robert J. Samuelson), linguists and cognitive scientists (Anne Curzan, Steven Pinker and Calvert Watkins) and humorists (Garrison Keillor, David Sedaris and Alison Bechdel). Pinker, author of the style guide &quot;The Sense of Style&quot;, was its final chair.

The members of the panel were sent regular ballots asking about matters of usage; the completed ballots were returned and tabulated, and the results formed the basis for special usage notes appended to the relevant dictionary entries. In many cases, these notes not only reported the percentage of panelists who considered a given usage or construction to be acceptable, but would also report the results from balloting of the same question in past decades, to give a clearer sense of how the language changes over time.

Houghton Mifflin dissolved the usage panel on February 1, 2018, citing the decline in demand for print dictionaries.

==Illustrations==
The &quot;AHD&quot; is also somewhat innovative in its liberal use of photographic illustrations, which at the time was highly unusual for general reference dictionaries, many of which went largely or completely unillustrated. It also has an unusually large number of biographical entries for notable persons.

==First edition==
When the first edition appeared in 1969, it was praised for its Indo-European etymologies. In addition to the normally expected etymologies, which for instance trace the word &quot;ambiguous&quot; to a Proto-Indo-European root &quot;ag-&quot;, meaning &quot;to drive&quot;, the dictionary includes an &quot;Indo-European Roots Appendix&quot;, which begins with a seven-page article by Professor Calvert Watkins entitled &quot;Indo-European and the Indo-Europeans&quot;. The appendix also contains a 46-page listing of Indo-European roots, wherein each of the approximately one thousand entries presents the Modern English words that are understood to have evolved from that root. These entries might be called &quot;reverse etymologies&quot;: the &quot;ag-&quot; entry there, for instance, lists 49 terms derived from it, words as diverse as &quot;agent&quot;, &quot;essay&quot;, &quot;purge&quot;, &quot;stratagem&quot;, &quot;ambassador&quot;, &quot;axiom&quot;, and &quot;pellagra&quot;, along with information about varying routes through intermediate transformations on the way to the contemporary words.

The book included &quot;vulgar&quot; words, a decision that attracted not only criticism in the press, but some book bans as well.

A compacted &quot;American Heritage College Dictionary&quot; was first released in 1974.

==Later editions==
The first edition&#x27;s concise successor, &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary, Second College Edition&quot;, was published in 1982 (without a larger-format version). It omitted the Indo-European etymologies, but they were reintroduced in the third full edition, published in 1992. The third edition was also a departure for the publisher because it was developed in a database, which facilitated the use of the linguistic data for other applications, such as electronic dictionaries. The third edition included over 350,000 entries and meanings.

The fourth edition (2000, reissued in 2006) added an appendix of Semitic language etymological roots, and included color illustrations, and was also available with a CD-ROM edition in some versions. This revision was larger than a typical desk dictionary but smaller than &quot;Webster&#x27;s Third New International Dictionary&quot; or the unabridged &quot;Random House Dictionary of the English Language&quot;. A lower-priced college edition, also the fourth, was issued in black-and-white printing and with fewer illustrations, in 2002 (reprinted in 2007 and 2010).

The fifth and most recent full edition was published in November 2011, with new printings in 2012 and 2016 and a 50th Anniversary Printing in 2018, which the publisher states is a &quot;comprehensive update&quot; of the 2011 edition, containing &quot;... [t]housands of revisions to definitions and etymologies, 150 new words and senses, and new usage advice ...&quot;

The various printings of the 5th edition are available in hardcover and, with reduced print size and smaller page count, trade paperback form. The 5th edition dropped several of the supplementary features of the fourth edition, and is not available with a disc-based electronic version. The university-student version was renamed &quot;The American Heritage College Writer&#x27;s Dictionary&quot; in 2013, and stripped of biographical and geographical entries to make room for more vocabulary while simultaneously reducing the number of pages compared to the fourth college edition.

The &quot;AHD&quot; inserts minor revisions (such as a biographical entry, with photograph, for each newly elected U.S. president) in successive printings of any given edition.

Supporting volumes have been issued, including &quot;The American Heritage Book of English Usage&quot;, &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of Indo-European Roots&quot;, &quot;The American Heritage Abbreviations Dictionary&quot;, &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of Idioms&quot;, &quot;The American Heritage Thesaurus&quot; in various sizes; usage dictionaries of special vocabulary such as &quot;The American Heritage Science Dictionary&quot;, &quot;The American Heritage Medical Dictionary&quot; and &quot;The American Heritage Dictionary of Business Terms&quot;; plus special dictionary editions for children, high-school students, and English-language learners. The &quot;American Heritage&quot; brand is also used for a series of American history books.

<text>The Prince-Archbishopric of Salzburg (; ) was an ecclesiastical principality and state of the Holy Roman Empire. It comprised the secular territory ruled by the archbishops of Salzburg, as distinguished from the much larger Catholic diocese founded in 739 by Saint Boniface in the German stem duchy of Bavaria. The capital of the archbishopric was Salzburg, the former Roman city of &quot;.

From the late 13th century onwards, the archbishops gradually reached the status of Imperial immediacy and independence from the Bavarian dukes. Salzburg remained an ecclesiastical principality until its secularisation to the short-lived Electorate of Salzburg (later Duchy of Salzburg) in 1803. Members of the Bavarian Circle from 1500, the prince-archbishops bore the title of &quot;, though they never obtained electoral dignity; actually of the six German prince-archbishoprics (with Mainz, Cologne and Trier), Magdeburg, Bremen and Salzburg received nothing from the Golden Bull of 1356. The last prince-archbishop exercising secular authority was Count Hieronymus von Colloredo, who was a patron of the Salzburg-native composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.

The prince-archbishopric&#x27;s territory was roughly congruent with the present-day Austrian state of Salzburg. It stretched along the Salzach river from the High Tauern range—Mt. Großvenediger at —at the main chain of the Alps in the south down to the Alpine foothills in the north. Here it also comprised the present-day Rupertiwinkel on the western shore of the Salzach, which today is part of Bavaria. The former archepiscopal lands are traditionally subdivided into five historic parts (&quot;Gaue&quot;): Flachgau with the Salzburg capital and Tarus
Tennengau around Hallein are both located in the broad Salzach valley at the rim of the Northern Limestone Alps; the mountainous (&quot;Innergebirg&quot;) southern divisions are Pinzgau, Pongau around Bischofshofen, and southeastern Lungau beyond the Radstädter Tauern Pass.

In the north and east, the prince-archbishopric bordered on the Duchy of Austria, a former Bavarian margraviate, which had become independent in 1156 and, raised to an archduchy in 1457, developed as the nucleus of the Habsburg monarchy. The Salzkammergut border region, today a UNESCO World Heritage Site, as an important salt trade region was gradually seized by the mighty House of Habsburg and incorporated into the Upper Austrian lands. In the southeast, Salzburg adjoined the Duchy of Styria, also ruled by the Habsburg (arch-)dukes in personal union since 1192. By 1335, the Austrian regents had also acquired the old Duchy of Carinthia in the south, the Styrian and Carinthian territories were incorporated into Inner Austria in 1379. The Habsburg encirclement was nearly completed when in 1363 the archdukes also attained the County of Tyrol in the west. Only in the northwest did Salzburg border on the Duchy of Bavaria (raised to an Electorate in 1623), and the tiny Berchtesgaden Provostry, which was able to retain its independence until the Mediatisation in 1803.

==Previous history==
The &quot;Vita Sancti Severini&quot; biography by the Early Christian chronicler Eugippius, reported that during the Decline of the Roman Empire about 450 AD the local capital &quot;Iuvavum&quot; in the &quot;Noricum ripense&quot; province was already home to two churches and a monastery. Very little is known of the early bishopric during the Migration Period, and the legendary Saint Maximus of Salzburg is the only abbot-bishop known by name. A disciple of Saint Severinus, he was martyred in the retreat from Noricum, after the Germanic Western Roman officer Odoacer had deposed the last Emperor Romulus Augustulus and declared himself King of Italy in 476. In his conflict with the Rugii tribes, Odoacer had his brother Onoulphus evacuate the &quot;Noricum ripense&quot; province in 487/88, whereby &quot;Iuvavum&quot; was abandoned and with it the bishopric. Saint Severinus had already died in 482 in the &quot;castrum&quot; of &quot;Favianis&quot; (present-day Mautern in Lower Austria), six years before the departure of the Roman legions from the region.

===Bavarian bishopric (c. 543/698–798)===

From the sixth century onwards, the northern areas of the later archbishopric were resettled by Germanic Bavarii tribes, who established themselves among the remaining Romance population, while Slavic tribes moved into the southern Pongau and Lungau parts. About 696 Saint Rupert, then Bishop of Worms in Frankish Austrasia and later called the apostle of Bavaria and Carinthia, came to the region from the Bavarian town Regensburg and laid the foundations for the re-establishment of the Salzburg diocese. After erecting a church at nearby Seekirchen he discovered the ruins of &quot;Iuvavum&quot; overgrown with brambles and remnants of the Romance population, who had maintained Christian traditions. The former theory that he arrived already in c. 543 during the time of the unsourced early Bavarian dukes appears less likely than that he worked during the reign of the Agilolfing duke Theodo II (c. 680–717), when the Bavarian stem duchy came under Frankish supremacy. The bishops of Salzburg traditionally marked the foundation of their diocese as being the year 582, and struck coins commemorating the 1,200-year anniversary of the event in 1782. In any case, it was not until after 700 that Christian civilisation re-emerged in the region.

Rupert established a monastery dedicated to Saint Peter at the site of a Late Antique church in the former &quot;Iuvavum&quot;. St Peter&#x27;s Abbey received large estates in the Flachgau (Rupertiwinkel) and Tennengau regions from the hands of Duke Theodon II, including several brine wells and salt evaporation ponds which earned &quot;Iuvavum&quot; its German name &quot;Salzburg&quot;. In 711 Rupert also founded the &quot;Cella Maximiliana&quot; in the Pongau region, the later town of Bischofshofen. His niece Erentrude established a Benedictine nunnery at nearby Nonnberg about 713. In 739 Archbishop Boniface, with the blessing of Pope Gregory III, completed the work of Saint Rupert and raised Salzburg to a bishopric, placed under the primatial see of the Archdiocese of Mainz. St. Vergilius, abbot of St. Peter&#x27;s since about 749, had quarrelled with St. Boniface over the existence of antipodes. He nevertheless became bishop about 767.

===Early archbishopric (798–1060)===
Arno, bishop since 785, enjoyed the respect of the Frankish king Charlemagne who assigned to him the missionary territory between the rivers Danube in the north, the Rába &quot;(Raab)&quot; in the east and the Drava in the south, an area which had recently been conquered from the Avars. Monasteries were founded and all of Carinthia was slowly Christianised. While Arno was in Rome attending to some of Charlemagne&#x27;s business in 798, Pope Leo III appointed him Archbishop over the other bishops in Bavaria (Freising, Passau, Regensburg, and Säben). When the dispute over the ecclesiastical border between Salzburg and the Patriarchate of Aquileia broke out, Charlemagne declared the Drava to be the border.

Archbishop Adalwin (859–873) suffered great troubles when King Rastislav of Moravia attempted to remove his realm from the ecclesiastical influence of East Francia. In 870 Pope Adrian II appointed the &quot;Apostle of the Slavs&quot; St. Methodius the Archbishop of Pannonia and Moravia at Sirmium, entrusting him large territories under the overlordship of the Salzburg diocese. It was only when Rastislav and Methodius were captured by King Louis the German that Adalwin could adequately protest the invasion of his rights. Methodius appeared at the Synod of Salzburg where he was struck in the face and imprisoned in close confinement for two and a half years.

Soon after, the Magyars ravaged Great Moravia and not a church was left standing in Pannonia. Archbishop Dietmar I fell in battle in 907. It was not until the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 that the Magyars suffered a crushing defeat, and ecclesiastical life in Salzburg returned to normal. The following year after Archbishop Herhold allied with Liudolf, Duke of Swabia and Duke Conrad the Red of Lorraine, he was deposed, imprisoned, blinded, and banished. Archbishop Bruno of Cologne, called the Bishop-Maker, appointed Frederick I archbishop and declared the Abbacy of St. Peter independent.

===Investiture era (1060–1213)===
In the era beginning with Pope Gregory VII, the Latin Christendom entered a period of internal conflict. The first archbishop of the era was Gebhard, who during the Investiture Controversy remained on the side of the Pope. Gebhard thus suffered a nine-year exile, and was allowed to return shortly before his death and was buried in Admont. After King Henry IV abdicated and Conrad I of Abensberg was elected Archbishop. Conrad lived in exile until the Calistine Concordat of 1122. Conrad spent the remaining years of his episcopate improving the religious life in the archdiocese.

==Prince-archbishopric==
Archbishop Eberhard II of Regensberg was made a prince of the Empire in 1213, and created three new sees: Chiemsee (1216), Seckau (1218) and Lavant (1225). In 1241, at the Council of Regensburg he denounced Pope Gregory IX as &quot;that man of perdition, whom they call Antichrist, who in his extravagant boasting says, I am God, I cannot err.&quot; During the German Interregnum, Salzburg suffered confusion. Philip of Spanheim, heir to the Dukedom of Carinthia, refused to take priestly consecrations, and was replaced by Ulrich, Bishop of Seckau.

King Rudolph I of Habsburg quarrelled with the archbishops through the manipulations of Abbot Henry of Admont, and after his death the archbishops and the Habsburgs made peace in 1297. The people and archbishops of Salzburgs remained loyal to the Habsburgs in their struggles against the Wittelsbachs. When the Black Death reached Salzburg in 1347, the Jews were accused of poisoning the wells and suffered severe persecution.

In 1473, he summoned the first provincial diet in the history of the archbishopric, and eventually abdicated. It was only Leonard of Keutschach (reigned 1495–1519) who reversed the situation. He had all the burgomasters and town councillors (who were levying unfair taxes) arrested simultaneously and imprisoned in the castle. His last years were spent in bitter struggle against Matthäus Lang of Wellenburg, Bishop of Gurk, who succeeded him in 1519.

Matthäus Lang was largely unnoticed in official circles, although his influence was felt throughout the archbishopric. He brought in Saxon miners, which brought with them Protestant books and teachings. He then attempted to keep the populace Catholic, and during the Latin War was besieged in the Hohen-Salzburg, declared a &quot;monster&quot; by Martin Luther, and two later uprisings by the peasants lead to suffering to the entire archdiocese. Later bishops were wiser in the ruling and spared Salzburg the religious wars and devastation seen elsewhere in Germany. Archbishop Wolf Dietrich von Raitenau gave the Protestants the choice of converting to Catholicism or leaving Salzburg. The cathedral was rebuilt in such splendour that it was unrivalled by all others north of the Alps.

Archbishop Paris of Lodron led Salzburg to peace and prosperity during the Thirty Years&#x27; War in which the rest of Germany was thoroughly devastated. During the reign of Leopold Anthony of Firmian, the remaining Protestants in Salzburg were expelled in 1731. He invited the Jesuits to Salzburg and asked for help from the emperor, and finally ordered the Protestants to recant their beliefs or emigrate. Over 20,000 Salzburg Protestants were forced to leave their homes, most of whom accepted an offer of land by King Frederick William I of Prussia.

The last Prince-Archbishop, Hieronymus von Colloredo, is probably best known for his patronage of Mozart. His reforms of the church and education systems alienated him from the people.

==Secularisation==
In 1803, Salzburg was secularised as the Electorate of Salzburg for the former Grand Duke Ferdinand III of Tuscany (brother of Emperor Francis II), who had lost his throne. In 1805, it became part of Austria. In 1809, it became part of Bavaria which closed the University of Salzburg, banned monasteries from accepting novices, and banned pilgrimages and processions. The archdiocese was reestablished as the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Salzburg in 1818 without temporal power.

Up to today, the Archbishop of Salzburg has also borne the title &quot;Primas Germaniae&quot; (&quot;First Bishop of Germany&quot;). The powers of this title – non-jurisdictional – are limited to being the Pope&#x27;s first correspondent in the German-speaking world, but had once included the right to preside over the Princes of the Holy Roman Empire. The Archbishop also has the title of &quot;Legatus Natus&quot; (&quot;born legate&quot;) to the Pope, which, although not a cardinal, gives the Archbishop the privilege of wearing red vesture (which is much deeper than a cardinal&#x27;s scarlet), even in Rome.

<doc id="255372" wikidata="Q837128" url="?curid=255372" title="Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen">
<text>The Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen () was an ecclesiastical principality (787–1566/1648) of the Holy Roman Empire and the Catholic Church that after its definitive secularization in 1648 became the hereditary Duchy of Bremen (). The prince-archbishopric, which was under the secular rule of the archbishop, consisted of about a third of the diocesan territory. The city of Bremen was &quot;de facto&quot; (since 1186) and &quot;de jure&quot; (since 1646) not part of the prince-archbishopric. Most of the prince-archbishopric lay rather in the area to the north of the &quot;city of Bremen&quot;, between the Weser and Elbe rivers. Even more confusingly, parts of the prince-archbishopric belonged in religious respect to the neighbouring Diocese of Verden, making up 10% of its diocesan territory.

==History==
In the different historical struggles for expansion of territory or privileges and the concerned and disfavoured entity&#x27;s defence against such annexation or usurpation, plenty of documents have been completely forged or counterfeited or backdated, in order to corroborate one&#x27;s arguments. &quot;These forgeries have drawn a veil before the early history of the [archbishopric of] Hamburg-Bremen.&quot;

===The archdiocese before the creation of the prince-archbishopric===
The foundation of the diocese belongs to the period of the missionary activity of Willehad on the lower Weser. It was erected on 15 July 787 at Worms, on Charlemagne&#x27;s initiative, his jurisdiction being assigned to cover the Saxon territory on both sides of the &quot;Weser&quot; from the mouth of the Aller, northwards to the Elbe and westwards to the Hunte, and the Frisian territory for a certain distance from the mouth of the Weser.

&quot;Willehad&quot; fixed his headquarters at Bremen, though the formal constitution of the diocese took place only after the subjugation of the Saxons in 804 or 805, when &quot;Willehad&quot;&#x27;s disciple, Willerich, was consecrated bishop of Bremen, with the same territory. The diocese was conceivably at that time a suffragan of the archbishops of Cologne, this is at least how they later corroborated their claim to supremacy over the Bremian see. When, after the death of Bishop Leuderich (838–45), the see was given to Ansgar, it lost its independence, and from that time on was permanently united with the &quot;Archdiocese of Hamburg&quot;.

The new combined see was regarded as the headquarters for missionary work in the Nordic countries, and new sees to be erected were to be its suffragans, meaning subject to its jurisdiction. &quot;Ansgar&#x27;s&quot; successor, Rimbert, the &quot;second apostle of the north,&quot; was troubled by onslaughts first by Normans and then by Wends, and by &quot;Cologne&#x27;s&quot; renewed claims to supremacy.

At Archbishop Adalgar&#x27;s (888–909) instigation Pope Sergius III confirmed the amalgamation of the &quot;Diocese of Bremen&quot; with the &quot;Archdiocese of Hamburg&quot; to form the &quot;Archdiocese of Hamburg and Bremen&quot;, colloquially called &quot;Hamburg-Bremen&quot;, and by so doing he denied &quot;Cologne&#x27;s&quot; claim as metropolia over Bremen. Sergius prohibited the chapter at Hamburg&#x27;s Concathedral to found suffragan dioceses of its own.

After the Obodrite destruction of Hamburg in 983 the Hamburg chapter was dispersed. So Archbishop Unwan appointed a new chapter with twelve canons, with three each taken from Bremen Cathedral chapter, and the three colleges of Bücken, Harsefeld and Ramelsloh. In 1139 Archbishop Adalbero had fled the invasion of Count Rudolph II of Stade and Count Palatine Frederick II of Saxony, who destroyed Bremen, and established in Hamburg also appointing new capitular canons there by 1140.

===Bremen&#x27;s Diocesan Territory and its Suffragans===

&quot;Hamburg-Bremen&#x27;s&quot; diocesan territory covered about today&#x27;s following territories: The Bremian cities of Bremen and Bremerhaven, the Free and Hanseatic City of Hamburg (north of Elbe), the Lower Saxon counties of Aurich (northerly), Cuxhaven, Diepholz (northerly), Frisia, Nienburg (westerly), Oldenburg in Oldenburg (easterly), Osterholz, Rotenburg upon Wümme (northerly), Stade (except of an eastern tract of land), Wesermarsch, Wittmund, the Lower Saxon urban counties Delmenhorst and Wilhelmshaven, the Schleswig-Holsteinian counties of Ditmarsh, Pinneberg, Rendsburg-Eckernförde (southerly), Segeberg (easterly), Steinburg, Stormarn (easterly) as well as the Schleswig-Holsteinian urban counties of Kiel and Neumünster.

 The see of &quot;Hamburg-Bremen&quot; attained its greatest prosperity and later had its deepest troubles under Archbishop Adalbert of Hamburg (1043–1072). He was after &quot;Hamburg-Bremen&#x27;s&quot; upgrade to the rank of a &quot;Patriarchate of the North&quot; and failed completely. &quot;Hamburg&quot; stopped being used as part of the diocese&#x27;s name. The next two archbishops, Liemar and &quot;Humbert&quot;, were determined opponents of Pope Gregory VII.

Under the latter in 1104 &quot;Bremen&#x27;s&quot; suffragan Diocese of Lund (DK) was elevated to an archdiocese supervising all of &quot;Bremen&#x27;s&quot; other Nordic former suffragan sees, to wit Århus (DK), Faroe Islands (FO), Gardar (Greenland), Linköping (S), Odense (DK), Orkney (UK), Oslo (N), Ribe (DK), Roskilde (DK), Schleswig (D), Selje (N), Skálholt (IS), Skara (S), Strängnäs (S), Trondheim (N), Uppsala (S), Viborg (DK), Vestervig (DK), Västerås (S) and Växjö (S).

&quot;Bremen&#x27;s&quot; remaining suffragan sees at that time were only existing by name, since insurgent Wends had destroyed the so-called Wendish dioceses of Oldenburg-Lübeck, Ratzeburg and Schwerin and they were only to be reestablished later. At the stripping of the Duchy of Saxony (7th century - 1180) in 1180 all of these suffragan bishops achieved for parts of their diocesan territories the status of imperially immediate prince-bishoprics. The Bishopric of Livonia (first at Uexküll then Riga) was a suffragan of Bremen in the years 1186–1255.

===The &quot;Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen&quot; after 1180 as a territory of imperial immediacy===

====Gaining Grounds for a Prince-Archbishopric of Imperial Immediacy====

Holy Roman Emperor Frederick I Barbarossa and his allies, many of them vassals and former supporters of his paternal cousin Duke Henry III, &quot;the Lion&quot;, had defeated the Duke of Saxony and Bavaria. In 1180 &quot;Frederick I Barbarossa&quot; stripped &quot;Henry the Lion&quot; of his duchies. In 1182 he and his wife Matilda Plantagenêt, the daughter of Henry II of England and Eleanor of Aquitaine and sister of Richard Lionheart left from Stade to go into exile from the Holy Roman Empire in order to stay with &quot;Henry II of England&quot;.

&quot;Frederick I Barbarossa&quot; partitioned Saxony in some dozens of territories of Imperial Immediate status allotting each territory to that one of his allies who had conquered them before from &quot;Henry the Lion&quot; and his remaining supporters. In 1168 the Saxon clan of the Ascanians, allies of &quot;Frederick I Barbarossa&quot;, had failed to install their family member Count Siegfried of Anhalt, on the see of &quot;Bremen&quot;.

But in 1180 the &quot;Ascanians&quot; prevailed twofoldly. The chief of the &quot;House of Ascania&quot;, Margrave Otto I of Brandenburg, son of Albert the Bear, a maternal cousin of &quot;Henry the Lion&quot;, provided his sixth brother Bernhard, Count of Anhalt, from then on &quot;Bernhard III, Duke of Saxony&quot;, with the later on so-called &quot;younger&quot; &quot;Duchy of Saxony&quot; (1180 - 1296), a radically belittled territory consisting of three unconnected territories along the river Elbe, from north west to south east, (1) Hadeln around Otterndorf, (2) around Lauenburg upon Elbe and (3) around Wittenberg upon Elbe. Except of the title, &quot;Duke of Saxony, Angria and Westphalia&quot;, which this &quot;younger Duchy of Saxony&quot; granted its rulers, even after its dynastic partition in 1296, this territory, consisting only of territorial fringes of the &quot;old Duchy of Saxony&quot;, had little in common with the latter. In 1260, with effect from 1296 on, its rulers split the &quot;younger Duchy&quot; into the Duchies of Saxe-Wittenberg () and Saxe-Lauenburg (), the latter holding the unconnected two northern territories, belonging both to the &quot;archdiocese of Bremen&quot;.

&quot;Otto&quot; and &quot;Bernhard&quot; helped their second brother Siegfried, who since 1168 had called himself the &quot;Bishop Elect of Bremen&quot;, to gain the see of &quot;Bremen&quot;, with part of the diocesan territory being upgraded to form the &quot;Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen&quot; (). Thus the &quot;Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen&quot; became one of the successor states of the &quot;old Duchy of Saxony&quot;, holding only a small part of its former territory.

In 1186 &quot;Frederick I Barbarossa&quot; recognised the city of Bremen as a political body by the Gelnhausen Privilege. With the consent of Prince-Archbishop Hartwig II, of Uthlede the emperor declared the city to be governed by its burghers and the emperor, with the Prince-Archbishop waiving his say. The city of Bremen regarded and still regards this privilege to be constitutive for its status as a Free imperial city of imperial immediacy.

Through the history the respective rulers of the Prince-Archbishopric and its successor state &quot;Bremen-Verden&quot; often denied the city&#x27;s status. And also the city could and did not always cling to its claim of &quot;imperial immediacy&quot;, which made the city&#x27;s status somewhat ambiguous. Through most of the history the city participated in the Prince-Archbishopric&#x27;s &quot;Diets&quot; as part of the Estates (see below) and paid its share in the taxes, at least when it had consented to the levying before. Since the city was the major taxpayer, its consent was mostly searched for. Like this the city wielded fiscal and political power within the Prince-Archbishopric, while the city would rather not allow the Prince-Archbishop or his representatives to rule in the city against its consent.

After the Bremen Cathedral chapter, overlooking the three enfranchised Hamburg capitulars, had elected Valdemar of Denmark, the deposed Bishop of Schleswig, archbishop in 1207, Bremen&#x27;s cathedral dean Burchard of Stumpenhusen, who had opposed this election, fled to Hamburg, then under Danish influence. King Valdemar II of Denmark, in enmity with his father&#x27;s cousin Archbishop Valdemar, gained the Hamburg chapter to elect Burchard as anti-archbishop in early 1208. Lacking papal support, King Valdemar II himself invested him as Archbishop Burchard I, however, only accepted in North Elbia.

In 1219 the Bremen Chapter again ignored the Hamburg capitulars, fearing their Danish partisanship and elected Gebhard of Lippe archbishop. In 1223 Archbishop Gebhard reconciled the Hamburg chapter and confirmed that three of its capitulars were enfranchised to elect with the Bremen chapter, to wit the provost, presiding the chapter, the dean (Domdechant) and the scholaster, in charge of the education at the cathedral school. Pope Honorius III confirmed this settlement in 1224, also affirming the continued existence of both chapters.

The fortified city of Bremen held its own guards, not allowing prince-archiepiscopal soldiers to enter it. The city reserved an extra very narrow gate, the so-called &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Needle&quot; (Latin: &quot;Acus episcopi&quot;, first mentioned in 1274), for all clergy including the Prince-Archbishop. The narrowness of the gate made it technically impossible to come accompanied by knights. Therefore, the Prince-Archbishops rather preferred to reside outside of the city, first in Bücken and later in the Vörde Castle, which became the principal fortress of Prince-Archbishop &quot;Gerhard II, Edelherr zur Lippe&quot; in 1219.

The Chapters of Bremen Cathedral (see below) and part of the administration were located within the city boundary in a district of immunity and extraterritorial status (, literally: &quot;Cathedral Liberty&quot;) around the Cathedral of St. Peter, where the city council would refrain to interfere. The Hamburg Concathedral with chapterhouse and capitular residential courts formed a &quot;Cathedral Immunity District&quot; of the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen too.

 The key, the epithet symbol of the Saint Simon Petrus, has become the symbol of the city of Bremen (see Coat of arms of Bremen), the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen (two criss-crossed argent (silver) keys on a gules (red) background, see in the left part of the Bremen-Verden&#x27;s seal) and of the Bremian city of Stade.

The territory of the &quot;Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen&quot; consisted of a number of sub-entities. The only thing they all had in common was, that the prior &quot;archbishops&quot; or &quot;capitulars&quot; or the &quot;Chapter&quot; as a collective obtained some secular power in them by way of purchase, application of force, usurpation, commendation, pledge, donation etc. The prior archiepiscopal authorities didn&#x27;t have succeeded in almost any of the sub-entities to gain all the power, be it judicial, patrimonial, parochial, fiscal, feudal or else what. Almost everywhere the rule was to be shared with one or more competing bearers of authority, e.g. aristocrats, outside ecclesiastical dignitaries, autonomous &quot;corporations of free peasants&quot; () or &quot;chartered towns&quot; and the like. Therefore, the archiepiscopal authority used to refer to each sub-entity by different terms like county, parish, shire, bailiwick or patrimonial district, each according to the particular power, which the archiepiscopal authority had achieved in them.

The &quot;Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen&#x27;s&quot; former territory consists about of today&#x27;s following &quot;Lower Saxon&quot; counties (, or ) of Cuxhaven (southerly), Osterholz, Rotenburg upon Wümme and Stade as well as of the Bremian exclave of the city of Bremerhaven and from 1145 to 1526 today&#x27;s Schleswig-Holsteinian county of Ditmarsh. The city of Bremen was legally a part of the bishopric until 1646, but de facto ruled by its burghers and didn&#x27;t tolerate the prince-archbishop&#x27;s residence within its walls any more since 1313. Therefore, the prince-archbishop moved to Vörde (). &quot;Verden&#x27;s&quot; former prince-bishopric&#x27;s territory is represented about by the eastern part of the modern &quot;County of Verden&quot; and the southern part of today&#x27;s &quot;County of Rotenburg&quot;, both in &quot;Lower Saxony&quot;.

====Constitution and Politics within the Prince-Archbishopric====
In relation to the interior the archiepiscopal authority, consisting of Prince-Archbishop and cathedral chapter, had to find ways to interact with the other bearers of authority. These were gradually transforming into the Bishopric&#x27;s Estates (), a prevailingly advisory body, but decision-taking in fiscal and tax matters. The &quot;bishopric&#x27;s Estates&quot; again were by no means homogenous and therefore often quarreled for they consisted of the &quot;hereditary aristocracy&quot;, the service gentry, non-capitular &quot;clergy&quot;, &quot;free peasants&quot; and burghers of chartered towns. The &quot;modus vivendi&quot; of interplay of the &quot;Estates&quot; and the archiepiscopal authority, being in itself divided into the &quot;Prince-Archbishop&quot; and the &quot;Chapter&quot;, became the quasi constitution of the &quot;Prince-Archbishopric&quot;. However, the interplay was not determined by fixed standards of behaviour. While the consecutive &quot;Archbishops&quot; worked on discarding the &quot;bishopric&#x27;s Estates&quot; from the political landscape, the latter fought for the enforcement of the &quot;modus vivendi&quot; to become a real constitution. The &quot;Chapter&quot; often swung between increasing its influence by fighting the &quot;Estates&quot; jointly with the &quot;Prince-Archbishop&quot; and repelling his absolutist intentions by making common cause with the &quot;Estates&quot;. All parties made use of means like bluffing, threat, obstructionism, corruption, horse-trading and even violence.

In 1542/1547 - 1549 &quot;Chapter&quot; and &quot;Estates&quot; managed to dismiss the autocratic and prodigal Prince-Archbishop Christopher &quot;the Spendthrift&quot;, Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg-Wolfenbüttel. Especially the &quot;Chapter&quot; used its power to elect very old candidates, to minimise the time a ruler can be harmful, or to elect minors, which it hoped to dress and tame in time. Once in a while the &quot;Chapter&quot; took up time and protracted elections for years, being itself the ruler for the time of sede vacante. During the dismissal of Prince-Archbishop &quot;Christopher the Spendthrift&quot; the &quot;chapter&quot; ruled together with the &quot;Estates&quot; which had gained at that time substantial power.

In relation to the outside the &quot;Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen&quot; had the status of an imperial estate (, plural: &quot;Reichsstände&quot;) with a vote in the Diet () of the Holy Roman Empire. A prerequisite for being an &quot;imperial estate&quot; was &quot;imperial immediacy&quot; (, or &quot;Reichsfreiheit&quot;) of the rulers or ruling bodies, meaning that they had no other authority above them except of the &quot;Holy Roman Emperor&quot; himself. Furthermore, such rulers or ruling bodies (such as Chapters or city councils) possessed several important rights and privileges, including a degree of autonomy in the rule of their territories.

In their pastoral and religious capacity as Roman Catholic cleric the archbishops led their archdiocese as the hierarchical superior of all Roman Catholic clergy, including the suffragan bishops of Oldenburg-Lübeck, Ratzeburg and Schwerin.

====Decline of the Prince-Archbishopric&#x27;s Independence====
The Prince-Archbishopric often suffered from military supremacy of neighbouring powers. Having no dynasty, but prince-archbishops of different descent, the Prince-Archbishopric became a pawn in the hands of the powerful. The establishment of a constitution, which would bind the conflicting Estates, failed.

Schisms in Church and State marked the next two centuries, and in spite of the labours of the Windesheim and Bursfelde congregations, the way was prepared for the Reformation, which made rapid headway, partly because the last Roman Catholic prince-archbishop, &quot;Christopher the Spendthrift&quot;, was in permanent conflict with the &quot;Chapter&quot; and the &quot;Estates&quot;. Being simultaneously the Prince-Bishop of Verden, he preferred to reside in the city of Verden.

By the time he died (1558), in the Prince-Archbishopric nothing was left of the old denomination apart from a few monasteries – such as Harsefeld, Himmelpforten, Lilienthal, Neuenwalde, Osterholz as well as Zeven under the jurisdiction of the Bremian archdiocese and as well as Neukloster under the jurisdiction of Verden&#x27;s See – and the districts served by them. While between 1523 and 1551 the cities of Bremen and Stade had dissolved all the urban monasteries, except of St Mary&#x27;s in Stade, which transformed until 1568 into a Lutheran convent, and conveyed their buildings to uses by schools, hospitals, alms houses and senior homes.

====The Era of the Lutheran Administrators of the Prince-Archbishopric====
The constitution of the Holy Roman Empire provided, that the Emperor may only enfeoff a prince-bishop elect with the regalia, if the Pope would have confirmed his election to the respective See. In default thereof the Emperor could grant a &quot;liege indult&quot; (), often restricted to some years only, and then notwithstanding enfeoff the prince-bishop elect with the regalia of restricted legitimacy to the effect that the elect could rule with princely power within the prince-bishopric, bearing only title of Administrator, but would be banned from participating in the Diets. Lacking papal confirmation and imperial &quot;liege indult&quot; could bring a prince-bishop elect into the precarious situation to be dismissed by the Emperor or by any of his vassals powerful enough and keen to do so.

Once the inhabitants of the Prince-Archbishopric had adopted Lutheranism and partially Calvinism, as did the city of Bremen and the territories under its influence downstream the Weser and in the district of Bederkesa, also most capitulars, recruited from burghers of the city of Bremen and rural noble families, turned out to be Calvinists and Lutherans. Thus the capitulars preferred to elect Protestant candidates. The Bremian prince-archbishop elects could only occasionally gain the imperial &quot;liege indult&quot;.

Many princely houses, such as the House of Guelf (Brunswick and Lunenburg-Wolfenbüttel), the House of Nikloting (Mecklenburg-Schwerin), the House of Wettin (Electorate of Saxony), and the House of Ascania (Saxe-Lauenburg) applied for the See. Before electing a new prince-archbishop the Chapter took its time, ruling the Prince-Archbishopric in accordance with the Estates (1566–1568), and considered the opportunities.

In 1524 the Prince-Archbishopric had subjected the autonomous farmers&#x27; republic of the Land of Wursten, but the Wursteners still hoped for a liberation and support from the neighbouring Saxe-Lauenburgian exclave of the Land of Hadeln. Thus on 17 February 1567 the Chapter elected Duke Henry III of Saxe-Lauenburg (*1550-1585*, ruled from 1568 on) prince-archbishop. In return his father Francis I waived any Saxe-Lauenburgian claim to the &quot;Land of Wursten&quot; as well as to the district of Bederkesa and abandoned the lawsuit, which he had brought to the Imperial Chamber Court to this end.

In his election capitulations Henry III covenanted to accept the privileges of the Estates and the existing laws. Due to his minority he agreed, that Chapter and Estates would rule the Prince-Archbishopric. In this time he should work towards a papal confirmation. De facto he ascended the See in 1568, gained an imperial &quot;liege indult&quot; in 1570, while de jure still represented by the Chapter until 1580, in order not to complicate a papal confirmation, which never materialised.

While Maximilian II regarded Henry III a true Catholic, Pope Sixtus V remained a skeptic. Henry III was raised Lutheran, but educated Catholic and served before his election as Catholic canon of the cathedral in Cologne. The schism wasn&#x27;t so definite, as it looks in retrospect. The Holy See still hoped the Reformation would be a merely temporary phenomenon, while its protagonists still expected all the Roman church to reform, so that there would be no schism.

So Sixtus V tested Henry III once in a while, demanding the succession of Catholic candidates for vacancies in the Bremian Chapter - which it sometimes accepted, sometimes denied -, while Henry succeeded to be also elected by the Chapters of the prince-bishoprics of Osnabrück (1574–1585) and Paderborn (1577–1585), without ever gaining papal confirmation. In 1575 Henry III and Anna von Broich (Borch) married in Hagen im Bremischen.

As to the interior Henry III still had to repay debts from his pre-predecessor Christopher &quot;the Spendthrift&quot;. In 1580 Henry introduced a Lutheran church constitution for the Prince-Archbishopric. Thus Henry III would not exercise the pastoral functions of a Roman Catholic bishop any more. In 1584 the Holy See founded the Roman Catholic &quot;Nordic Missions&quot;, an endeavour for pastoral care and mission in the area of the de facto ceased &quot;archdioceses of Bremen&quot; and &quot;of Lund&quot;. In 1622 the &quot;Nordic Missions&quot; were subordinated to the Congregatio de Propaganda Fide in Rome. The Holy See conveyed to the Nuncio to Cologne, Pietro Francesco Montoro, the task to look after the &quot;Nordic Missions&quot; in - among others - the &quot;Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen&quot; and the &quot;Prince-Bishopric of Verden&quot;. In 1667 the &quot;Holy See&quot; further institutionalised the &quot;Nordic Missions&quot; by establishing the Vicariate Apostolic of the Nordic Missions.

On 22 April 1585 Henry III died in his residence in Beverstedtermühlen after a riding accident. After Henry&#x27;s early death, Duke Adolf of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp wielded influence at the Bremian Chapter to elect his son John Adolphus of Schleswig-Holstein at Gottorp (*1575-1616*) to the See. To this end, Adolf paid 20,000 rixdollars and promised to work towards the restitution of Ditmarsh to the Prince-Archbishopric.

In 1585 John Adolf covenanted at his election in the obligatory &quot;election capitulations&quot;, that he would accept the privileges of the Chapter as well as the existing laws and that he would work - at his own expense - towards gaining either papal confirmation or - in default thereof - an imperial &quot;liege indult&quot;. From 1585 to 1589 Chapter and Estates ruled the Prince-Archbishopsric in custodianship for the minor John Adolf.

====The Prince-Archbishopric during the Thirty-Years War (1618-1648)====

At the beginning of the Thirty Years&#x27; War the Prince-Archbishopric maintained neutrality, as did most of the territories in the Lower Saxon Circle. After 1613 King Christian IV of Denmark and Norway, being in personal union Duke of Holstein within the &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot;, turned his attention to gain grounds by acquiring the prince-bishoprics of Bremen, Verden, Minden and Halberstadt.

He skillfully took advantage of the alarm of the German Protestants after the Battle of White Mountain in 1620, to stipulate with Bremen&#x27;s Chapter and Administrator John Frederick, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein-Gottorp, his cousin of second degree, to grant coadjutorship of the See of Bremen for his son Frederick, later crown prince of Denmark (September 1621). Coadjutorship usually included the succession of a See. A similar arrangement was reached in November for the Prince-Bishopric of Verden with its Chapter and Administrator Philip Sigismund. In 1623 &quot;Christian&#x27;s&quot; son succeeded the late &quot;Philip Sigismund&quot; as Frederick II, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Verden, only to flee the troops of the Catholic League under Count Johan &#x27;t Serclaes of Tilly in 1626.

In November 1619 Christian IV of Denmark, Duke of Holstein stationed Danish troops in the Bremian city of Stade, officially on behalf of his son the provided to be Administrator successor, suppressing an unrest of its burghers.

In 1620 Christian, &quot;the Younger&quot;, titular duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg-Wolfenbüttel, the Lutheran Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric Halberstadt requested that the Lutheran &quot;Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen&quot; would join the war coalition of the Protestant Union. The Administrator and the Estates of the Prince-Archbishopric met in a Diet and declared for their territory their loyalty to Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, and their neutrality in the conflict.

With Danish troops within his territory and &quot;Christian the Younger&#x27;s&quot; request Administrator &quot;John Frederick&quot; tried desperately to keep his Prince-Archbishopric out of the war, being in complete agreement with the Estates and the city of Bremen. When in 1623 the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, fighting in the Eighty Years&#x27; War for its independence against Habsburg&#x27;s Spanish and imperial forces, requested its Calvinist co-religionist of the city of &quot;Bremen&quot; to join, the city refused, but started to enforce its fortifications.

In 1623 the territories comprising the Lower Saxon Circle decided to recruit an army in order to maintain an armed neutrality, with troops of the Catholic League already operating in the neighboured Lower Rhenish-Westphalian Circle and dangerously approaching their region. The concomitant effects of the war, debasements and dearness, had already caused an inflation also in the region. The population suffered from billeting and alimenting Baden-Durlachian, Danish, Halberstadtian, Leaguist, and Palatine troops, whose marching through the Prince-Archbishopric had to tolerate in order to prevent entering into armed conflict.

In 1623 the Republic of the Seven United Netherlands, diplomatically supported by James I, King of England and of Ireland and as James IV King of Scotland, the brother-in-law of Christian IV of Denmark, started a new anti-Habsburg campaign. Thus the troops of the Catholic League were bound and the Prince-Archbishopric seemed relieved. But soon after the imperial troops under Albrecht von Wallenstein headed for the North in an attempt to destroy the fading Hanseatic League, in order to subject the Hanseatic cities of Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck and to establish a Baltic trade monopoly, to be run by some imperial favourites including Spaniards and Poles. The idea was to win Sweden&#x27;s and Denmark&#x27;s support, both of which since long were after the destruction of the &quot;Hanseatic League&quot;.

In May 1625 Christian IV of Denmark, Duke of Holstein was elected – in the latter of his functions – by the Lower Saxon Circle&#x27;s member territories commander-in-chief of the Lower Saxon troops. More troops were recruited and to be billeted and alimented in the Lower Saxon territories, including the Prince-Archbishopric. In the same year &quot;Christian IV&quot; joined the Anglo-Dutch war coalition. In 1625 &quot;Tilly&quot; warned the Prince-Archbishop &quot;John Frederick&quot; to further accept the stationing of Danish troops and Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, demanded the immediate end of his and &quot;Verden&#x27;s&quot; alliance with Denmark, with &quot;Verden&quot; being already ruled by &quot;Christian&#x27;s&quot; son &quot;Frederick&quot;, being as well the provided successor of &quot;John Frederick&quot;. He declared again his loyalty to the Emperor and neutrality in the conflict. But all in vain.

Now &quot;Christian IV&quot; ordered his troops to capture all the important traffic hubs in the Prince-Archbishopric and entered into the Battle of Lutter am Barenberge, on 27 August 1626, where he was defeated by the Leaguist troops under &quot;Tilly&quot;. &quot;Christian IV&quot; and his surviving troops fled to the Prince-Archbishopric and took their headquarters in &quot;Stade&quot;. Administrator &quot;John Frederick&quot;, in personal union also Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Lübeck, fled to the latter and left the rule in the Prince-Archbishopric to the Chapter and the Estates.

In 1626 &quot;Tilly&quot; and his troops occupied the &quot;Prince-Bishopric of Verden&quot;, which caused a flight of Lutheran clergy from that territory. He demanded the Bremian Chapter to allow him to enter the Prince-Archbishopric. The Chapter, now holding the baby, declared again its loyalty to the Emperor and delayed an answer to the request, arguing that it had to consult with the Estates in a Diet first, which would be a lengthy procedure.

Meanwhile, &quot;Christian IV&quot; ordered Dutch, English and French troops for his support to land in the Prince-Archbishopric, while extorting from the latter high war contributions to finance his war. The Chapter&#x27;s pleas for a reduction of the contributions &quot;Christian IV&quot; commented by arguing once the Leaguists would take over, his extortions will seem little.

By 1627 &quot;Christian IV&quot; had de facto dismissed his cousin &quot;John Frederick&quot; from the Bremian See. In the same year &quot;Christian IV&quot; withdrew from the Prince-Archbishopric, in order to fight &quot;Wallenstein&#x27;s&quot; invasion of his Duchy of Holstein. &quot;Tilly&quot; then invaded the Prince-Archbishopric and captured its southern parts. The city of Bremen shut its city gates and entrenched behind its improved fortifications. In 1628 &quot;Tilly&quot; beleaguered &quot;Stade&quot; with its remaining garrison of 3,500 Danish and English soldiers. On 5 May 1628 &quot;Tilly&quot; granted them safe-conduct to England and Denmark and the whole Prince-Archbishopric was in his hands. Now &quot;Tilly&quot; turned to the city of Bremen, which paid him a ransom of 10,000 rixdollars in order to spare its siege. The city remained unoccupied.

&quot;Wallenstein&quot; had meanwhile conquered all the Jutish Peninsula, which made &quot;Christian IV&quot; to sign the Treaty of Lübeck, on 22 May 1629, in order to regain possession of all his feoffs on the peninsula, he in return agreed to formally end Denmark&#x27;s participation in the Thirty Years&#x27; War and waived for his son Frederick II, Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Verden, the administration of that prince-bishopric as well as the provided succession as Administrator of the Prince-Bishopric of Halberstadt.

Administrator &quot;John Frederick&quot;, exiled in the Imperial Free City of Lübeck, was in a markedly weak position. So in 1628 he consented that the Lutheran convent in the former Roman Catholic St. Mary&#x27;s monastery in &quot;Stade&quot; – under Leaguist occupation – was restituted to Catholic rite and manned with foreign monks, if the Chapter would also agree. Again passing the buck on to the Chapter.

The Leaguist takeover enabled Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor, to implement the Edict of Restitution, decreed on 6 March 1629 within the &quot;Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen&quot; and the &quot;Prince-Bishopric of Verden&quot;. The Bremian monasteries still maintaining Roman Catholic rite – Altkloster Convent, , Neukloster, and Zeven – became the local strongholds for a reCatholicisation within the scope of Counter-Reformation.

Under the threat of the &quot;Edict of Restitution&quot; &quot;John Frederick&quot; consented to Canonical Visitations of the remaining monasteries, those clinging to Roman Catholic rite and those converted to voluntary Lutheran convents alike. Nunneries had traditionally been institutions to provide unmarried daughters of the better off, who couldn&#x27;t be provided a husband befitting their social status or who didn&#x27;t want to marry, with a decent livelihood. So when an unmarried woman of that status joined a nunnery she would bestow earning assets (real estate) or – restricted to her lifetime – regular revenues paid by her male relatives, on the monastery, making up in the former case part of the nunnery&#x27;s estates (not to be confused with the political body of the Estates).

In many territories, where the majority of the population adopted Lutheranism, the nunneries&#x27; function to provide sustenance for unmarried women wasn&#x27;t to be given up. So it happened that the Prince-Archbishopric&#x27;s former Roman Catholic nunneries of Himmelpforten, Lilienthal, Neuenwalde, and Osterholz with all their estates had turned into such Lutheran women&#x27;s convents (German: das &quot;Stift&quot;, more particular: &quot;Damenstift&quot;, literally &quot;ladies&#x27; foundation&quot;), while the nunnery of Zeven was in the process of becoming one, with – among a majority of Catholic nuns – a number of &quot;nuns&quot; of Lutheran denomination, usually called conventuals. Other expressions like abbess, for the chairwoman, and prioress for conventuals of certain hierarchic function, were – and are partly – continued to be used in such Lutheran &quot;Stifte&quot;.

Within the scope of the visitations by the end of the year 1629 the Roman Catholic visitators issued an ultimatum to the Lutheran conventuals had been thrown out from the monasteries, with the estates of &quot;Himmelpforten&quot; and &quot;Neuenwalde&quot; then being bestowed to the Jesuites, in order to finance them and their missioning in the course of the &quot;Counter-Reformation&quot; in the Prince-Archbishopric. The expelled conventuals were denied to get the real estate restituted, which they bestowed on the monastery, when they entered it.

&quot;Ferdinand II&quot; suspended the capitulars from penalty, if they would dismiss the Lutheran coadjutor Frederick, later Crown Prince of Denmark from office. The Chapter refused, still backing &quot;Frederick&quot;, whom it had elected with full legal validity in 1621. So &quot;Ferdinand II&quot; himself dismissed him by way of using the &quot;Edict of Restitution&quot;, in favour of his youngest son, the Roman Catholic Archduke Leopold Wilhelm of Austria, already administrator of the prince-bishoprics of Halberstadt (1628–1648), Passau (1625–1662) and Strasbourg (1626–1662).

&quot;Ferdinand II&quot; left &quot;John Frederick&quot; in office, against Leaguist resistance, for he had always kept loyalty to him. The &quot;Catholic League&quot; wished the Roman Catholic Count Francis William of Wartenberg, Prince-Bishopric of Osnabrück (1625–1634 and again 1648–1661), onto the See. After all, the See included at those years an annual revenue of 60,000 rixdollars at the free disposal of its holder, making up half the Prince-Archbishopric&#x27;s budget.

&quot;Francis of Wartenberg&quot;, appointed by &quot;Ferdinand II&quot; as chairman of the imperial &quot;restitution commission&quot;, carrying out the provisions of the &quot;Edict of Restitution&quot; in the &quot;Lower Saxon Circle&quot;, dismissed &quot;John Frederick&quot; in 1629, who acquiesced.

In September 1629 the Chapter was ordered to render an account of all the capitular and prince-archiepiscopal estates (not to be confused with the Estates), which it refused, arguing first that the order was not authenticated and later that due to disputes with the city council of &quot;Bremen&quot;, they couldn&#x27;t freely travel to render an account let alone do the necessary research on the estates. The anti-Catholic attitudes of the burghers and the council of Bremen would make it completely impossible to prepare the restitution of estates from the Lutheran Chapter to the Roman Catholic Church. Even Lutheran capitulars were uneasy in Calvinistic &quot;Bremen&quot;. In October 1629 the capitular secretary finally rendered the ordered account in &quot;Verden&quot; and was informed that by the &quot;Edict of Restitution&quot; the Chapter is regarded to be illegitimate. Lutheran capitulars were interrogated, but the Chapter was left in office, with its decisions subjected to the consent of the &quot;restitution commission&quot;. Pope Urban VIII appointed additional Roman Catholic capitulars in 1630, including a new provost.

The estates within the boundaries of the unoccupied city of &quot;Bremen&quot; weren&#x27;t restituted by order of the city council. The council argued, that the city had long been Protestant, but the &quot;restitution commission&quot; argued that the city was de jure a part of the Prince-Archbishopric, so Protestantism had illegitimately alienated estates from the &quot;Roman Catholic Church&quot;. The city council answered under these circumstances it would rather separate from the &quot;Holy Roman Empire&quot; and join the quasi-independent &quot;Republic of the Seven Netherlands&quot; (Its independence was finally confirmed by the Treaty of Westphalia in 1648). The city was neither to be conquered nor to be successfully beleaguered due to its new fortifications and its access to the North Sea via the Weser river.

Within the occupied Prince-Archbishopric the Leaguist occupants carried out the restitution. In Stade, &quot;Tilly&#x27;s&quot; headquarters, all churches, except of St. Nicholas, were handed over to foreign Catholic clerics. But the burghers didn&#x27;t attend Catholic services. So in March 1630 &quot;Tilly&quot; expelled all Lutheran clergy, except the one of St. Nicholas. &quot;Tilly&quot; levied high war contributions from &quot;Stade&#x27;s&quot; burghers (e.g. 22,533 rixdollars in 1628 alone) and offered in 1630 to relieve every burgher, who would attend Catholic services, without success. In July 1630 &quot;Tilly&quot; left to head for the Duchy of Pomerania, where King Gustavus II Adolphus of Sweden had landed with his troops, opening a new front in the Thirty Years&#x27; War. He had been won by French diplomacy to join a new anti-imperial coalition, soon joined by the Netherlands.

In February 1631 &quot;John Frederick&quot; conferred with &quot;Gustavus II Adolphus&quot; and a number of Lower Saxon princes in Leipzig, all of them troubled by Habsburg&#x27;s growing influence wielded by virtue of the &quot;Edict of Restitution&quot; in a number of Northern German Lutheran prince-bishoprics. &quot;John Frederick&quot; speculated to regain the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen and therefore in June/July 1631 officially allied himself with Sweden. For the war being &quot;John Frederick&quot; accepted the supreme command of &quot;Gustavus II Adolphus&quot;, who promised to restitute the Prince-Archbishopric to its former Administrator. In October an Army, newly recruited by &quot;John Frederick&quot;, started to reconquer the Prince-Archbishopric and – supported by Swedish troops – to capture the neighboured Prince-Bishopric of Verden, de facto dismissing &quot;Verden&#x27;s&quot; Catholic Prince-Bishop Count Francis of Wartenberg (ruled 1630-1631), and causing the flight of the Catholic clergy wherever they arrived. The &quot;Prince-Bishopric of Verden&quot; became subject of a Swedish military administration, while &quot;John Frederick&quot; ascended its See in 1631.

The reconquest of the Prince-Archbishopric – helped by forces from Sweden and from the city of Bremen – was interrupted by Leaguist forces under Gottfried Heinrich Graf zu Pappenheim, coming as a relief to Stade, where they joined the Catholic imperial and Leaguist forces still holding out. On 10 May 1632 they were granted safe-conduct and left a desperately impoverished city of Stade after its siege by &quot;John Frederick&#x27;s&quot; forces. &quot;John Frederick&quot; was back in his office, only to realise the supremacy of Sweden, insisting on its supreme command until the war&#x27;s end. The Prince-Archbishopric continuously suffered from billeting and alimenting soldiers. The relation between the Estates, who had to maintain administration under Catholic occupation, and the returned Administrator were difficult. The Estates preferred to directly negotiate with the occupants, this time the Swedes. &quot;John Frederick&quot; wanted to secularise the monasteries in favour of his budget, but the opposing Estates prevented that.

After &quot;John Frederick&#x27;s&quot; death in 1634 Chapter and Estates regarded Frederick&#x27;s (later Danish Crown Prince) dismissal as coadjutor by Ferdinand II by virtue of the &quot;Edict of Restitution&quot; illegitimate. But the Swedish occupants had to be persuaded first, to accept &quot;Frederick&#x27;s&quot; succession. So Chapter and Estates ruled the Prince-Archbishopric until the conclusion of the negotiations with Sweden. In 1635 he succeeded as Lutheran Administrator Frederick II in the Sees of Bremen and of Verden. But he had to render homage to the minor Queen Christina of Sweden.

In the same year Pope Urban VIII provided the Catholic coadjutor Leopold Wilhelm, Archduke of Austria, imposed in 1629 by his father &quot;Ferdinand II&quot;, with the Archdiocese of Bremen, but due to its persisting occupation by the Swedes he never gained de facto pastoral influence let alone the power as administrator of the prince-archbishopric.

In 1635/1636 the Estates and &quot;Frederick II&quot; agreed with Sweden upon the prince-archbishopric&#x27;s neutrality. But this didn&#x27;t last long, because in the Danish-Swedish Torstenson War (1643–45) the Swedes seized de facto rule in both prince-bishoprics. Christian IV of Denmark had to sign the Second Peace of Brömsebro on 13 August 1645, a number of Danish territories, including the two prince-bishoprics, being ceded into Swedish hands. So &quot;Frederick II&quot; had to resign as Administrator in both prince-bishoprics. He succeeded his late father on the Danish throne as Frederick III of Denmark in 1648.

With Bremen sede vacante again, the new Pope Innocent X appointed Count Francis of Wartenberg, the expelled short-period Prince-Bishop of Verden (1630–1631) and officiating Prince-Bishop of Osnabrück (1625–1661), as Vicar Apostolic in 1645, i.e. provisional head of the See. &quot;Wartenberg&quot; never gained pastoral influence, let alone power as prince-bishop due to the persisting Swedish occupation of the Prince-Archbishopric until the end of the Thirty Years&#x27; War.

With the impending enfeoffment of the Prince-Archbisporic of Bremen to the political Great Power of Sweden, as under negotiation for the &quot;Treaty of Westphalia&quot;, the city of Bremen searched for an imperial confirmation of its status of &quot;imperial immediacy&quot; from 1186 (Gelnhausen Privilege), which Ferdinand III, Holy Roman Emperor, granted to the city in 1646 (Diploma of Linz).

===The further History of the Prince-Archbishopric after 1648===
For the further history see the article about the collectively ruled Duchy of Bremen and Principality of Verden (1648–1823). Then see Stade Region (1823–1978), which emerged by the establishment of the &quot;High-Bailiwick of Stade&quot; in 1823, comprising the territories of the former &quot;Duchies of Bremen and Verden&quot; and the &quot;Land Hadeln&quot;.

====Reorganisation of Roman Catholic Church in the former Territory of the Archdiocese and Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen====

In 1824 &quot;Bremen&#x27;s&quot; former diocesan territory was distributed among the still-existing neighbouring dioceses of Osnabrück, Münster and Hildesheim, the latter of which covers today the former territory of the &quot;Prince-Archbishopric&quot; proper. Except for the prevailingly Calvinist Free Hanseatic City of Bremen and its territory, which continued to be supervised by the Roman Catholic Vicariate Apostolic of the Nordic Missions. The &quot;Free Hanseatic City of Bremen&quot; became part of the &quot;Diocese of Osnabrück&quot; only in 1929, with the &quot;Vicariate Apostolic&quot; being dismantled in the same year.

<text>The Old World babblers or Timaliidae, are a family of mostly Old World passerine birds. They are rather diverse in size and coloration, but are characterised by soft, fluffy plumage. These are birds of tropical areas, with the greatest variety in Southeast Asia and the Indian subcontinent. The timaliids are one of two unrelated groups of birds known as babblers, the other being the Australasian babblers of the family Pomatostomidae (also known as pseudo-babblers).

Morphological diversity is rather high; most species resemble &quot;warblers&quot;, jays or thrushes. This group is among those Old World bird families with the highest number of species still being discovered.

==Characteristics==

Timaliids are small to medium birds. They have strong legs, and many are quite terrestrial. They typically have generalised bills, similar to those of a thrush or warbler, except for the scimitar babblers which, as their name implies, have strongly decurved bills. Most have predominantly brown plumage, with minimal difference between the sexes, but many more brightly coloured species also exist.

This group is not strongly migratory, and most species have short rounded wings, and a weak flight. They live in lightly wooded or scrubland environments, ranging from swamp to near-desert. They are primarily insectivorous, although many will also take berries, and the larger species will even eat small lizards and other vertebrates.

Typical babblers live in communities of around a dozen birds, jointly defending a territory. Many even breed communally, with a dominant pair building a nest, and the remainder helping to defend and rear their young. Young males remain with the group, while females move away to find a new group, and thus avoid inbreeding. They make nests from twigs, and hide them in dense vegetation.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The systematics of Old World babblers have long been contested. During much of the 20th century, the family was used as a &quot;wastebin taxon&quot; for numerous hard-to-place Old World songbirds (such as Picathartidae and Pnoepygidae, as well as the New World species the wrentit). The German ornithologist Ernst Hartert summarized this attitude with the statement that, in the passerines: &quot;Was man nicht unterbringen kann, sieht man als Timalien an.&quot; (What one can&#x27;t place systematically is considered an Old World babbler).

The most obviously misplaced taxa were removed piecemeal towards the end of the last century. Since then, with the aid of DNA sequence data, it has been confirmed that even the remaining group is not monophyletic. Analysis of mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and 12S/16S rRNA data (Cibois 2003a) spread the Timaliidae that were studied across what essentially was a badly resolved polytomy with Old World warblers and white-eyes. As the typical warblers (genus &quot;Sylvia&quot;) grouped with some presumed timaliids (such as the fulvettas), it was suggested that some Sylviidae should be moved to the Timaliidae.

The phylogenetic relationships between Timaliidae and other families was determined in a molecular phylogenetic study by Tianlong Cai and collaborators that was published in 2019. It is shown in the cladogram below:

The cladogram below shows the relationships between the genera. These were determined in the same study by Cai and collaborators.
===List of genera===
The family as currently constituted includes 58 species divided into the following ten genera:

<text>Robin Tunney (born June 19, 1972) is an American actress who made her film debut in &quot;Encino Man&quot; (1992), and later rose to prominence with headline parts in the cult films &quot;Empire Records&quot; (1995) and &quot;The Craft&quot; (1996).

<doc id="255382" wikidata="Q1402606" url="?curid=255382" title="BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir London">
<text>BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir (also commonly known as the Neasden Temple) is a Hindu temple in Neasden, London, England. Built entirely using traditional methods and materials, the Swaminarayan mandir has been described as being Britain&#x27;s first authentic Hindu temple. It was also Europe&#x27;s first traditional Hindu stone temple, as distinct from converted secular buildings. It is a part of the Bochasanwasi Shri Akshar Purushottam Swaminarayan Sanstha (BAPS) organisation and was inaugurated in 1995 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj. The temple complex also consists of a permanent exhibition entitled &quot;Understanding Hinduism&quot; and a cultural centre housing an assembly hall, gymnasium, bookshop, and offices.

==Mandir complex==

The BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Mandir is located on Pramukh Swami Road, Neasden, London NW10 8HW, United Kingdom. The mandir is close to the North Circular Road, and can be reached by bus or on foot from Wembley Park, Stonebridge Park, Harlesden, and Neasden Underground and Overground stations. The complex is 102,018 square feet and includes the first traditional stone mandir in Europe adjoined with a cultural center, and a 550-car parking lot. At the time of its completion, the mandir became the largest Hindu mandir built outside of India. The cultural center includes a foyer, a prayer hall, a conference hall, an exhibition hall, a marriage hall, a sports hall, a library, and a health clinic.

In August 2020, to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the mandir&#x27;s opening, King Charles III and Queen Camilla said that, &quot;the first of its kind outside India, Neasden Temple serves the local community as a place of worship, learning, celebration, peace and community service.&quot; The King and Queen had previously visited the temple in 2009 for the traditional festival of &quot;Holi.&quot;

=== Main structure ===
The mandir rises to a height of 21 meters (70 feet) and is 60 meters (195 feet) long. The exterior of the mandir covered with 990 cubic meters (35,000 cubic feet) of Bulgarian limestone, while the interior of the mandir is composed of 700 cubic meters (25,000 cubic feet) of Indian and Italian marble. The mandir covers 1.5 acres of land and is made up of over 1,699 cubic meters (60,000 cubic feet) of stone, without the use of ferrous materials like steel. The mandir includes 7 shikhars (pinnacles), 6 gummats (domes), 193 sthambhas (pillars), 32 gavakshas (windows), and 4 jharukhas (balconies). The central dome is 10 meters high and the design was inspired by the Delwara Jain Mandir in Mount Abu, Rajasthan. The mandir has over 500 unique designs, 26,300 carved stone pieces, and 55 different ceiling designs. In its September 2000 edition, the National Geographic referred to the mandir as &quot;A London Landmark.&quot;

=== Haveli ===

The haveli, built in a traditional haveli style, has a courtyard architectural style that was originally developed in 17th century western India, and serves as a cultural center for the mandir. The traditional haveli design highlights specific architectural components like the façade, open courtyards, carved columns, arches, doors, windows, and balconies.

Adjoining the mandir is BAPS Shri Swaminarayan Haveli, a multi-function cultural centre. Whereas the mandir is carved from stone, the haveli is constructed from wood. English oak and Burmese teak have been fashioned into panels, arches and screens, all carved by craftsmen in India with a cornucopia of geometric patterns, stylised animal heads, and flower garlands.

The Burmese teak used was harvested from sustainable forests. To compensate for the 226 English oak trees used, over 2,300 English oak saplings were planted in Devon. The haveli also incorporates energy-saving features such as light-wells.

Richly carved haveli-style woodwork from Gujarat is the most striking characteristic of the building&#x27;s façade and foyer. It has been designed according to traditional Indian haveli architecture, to evoke feelings of being in Gujarat, India, where such havelis were once commonplace. It required over 150 craftsmen from all over India three years to carve 1,579 m2 (17,000 square feet) of wood. Behind the traditional wooden façade, the cultural centre houses a vast pillarless prayer hall with space for 3,000 people, a gymnasium, medical centre, dining facilities, bookstall, conference facilities, and offices.

=== Garden ===
The mandir is surrounded by a garden featuring sculpted flowerbeds, lush lawns, evergreen yews, and a topiary. The garden displays two distinct styles to illustrate Hindu motifs. The parterre garden style is used on the front and sides of the mandir. The formal garden is planted behind the mandir and includes interconnected walkways and floral designs to symbolize the human relationship with nature and the universe.

The garden won first place in the &#x27;Brent in Bloom&#x27; competition in 2009, 2010, and 2012 and received a Certificate of Excellence in 2009 from &#x27;London in Bloom.&#x27;

=== Exhibition ===
The lower level of the mandir consists of a permanent exhibition open to visitors called &#x27;Understanding Hinduism.&#x27; The exhibition spans over 3,000 square feet and is designed to display Hindu values and wisdom through 3D dioramas, paintings, tableaux, and traditional artwork. The exhibition also includes an 11-minute documentary that explains the religious significance of the mandir and how it was created.

== Construction ==
Fifteen years prior to its construction, Pramukh Swami Maharaj envisioned that a traditional Hindu mandir would be built in the UK for its followers. The mandir was built in accordance with the principles of the &quot;Shilpa Shastras&quot;, a Vedic text on architecture that dates back to approximately 5,000 years ago. Pramukh Swami Maharaj appointed CB Sompura, an Indian architect, as the lead architect for creating the design for the mandir. Prior to being used in construction, all of the stones were tested for properties such as density, compression, flexibility, water absorption, and freezing before being chosen. Planning permissions were obtained in August 1992, and the construction of the mandir began in November 1992. The Italian marble used for the interior of the mandir was sent to Kandla, India, to be carved by craftsmen and then shipped to London, UK to be assembled, &quot;like a giant jigsaw to form the temple.&quot;

In December 1993, 169 craftsmen began working together across five different sites in India (Uttar Pradesh, Gujarat, Maharashtra, Rajasthan, and Bengal) to create the carved designs seen in the haveli. The haveli work of about 9,000 square feet was completed in 1 year and 8 months. The intricate designs in and around the haveli are carved on Burmese Teak wood and structurally supported by English Oak wood, both of which have been preserved in their natural colors.

Initially, while planning for the cultural center, architects proposed four architectural designs to Pramukh Swami Maharaj: the Jaipur palace style, the Jaisalmer arcade, the Raj Indo-British style, and the haveli style. The architects predominately favored the Raj or Jaipur styles, but Pramukh Swami Maharaj preferred the haveli style and approved the corresponding designs. Chief architect for the haveli, Nigel Lane, a recipient of the BBC TV Pride of Place, was a key British architect who assisted BAPS in tailoring the Haveli architectural style to suit the British climate.

Approximately 450 craftsmen, 100 full-time volunteers, and over 1,000 part-time volunteers dedicated time and effort toward the creation of the mandir. Volunteers often devoted time from their day jobs to help with the construction of the mandir and ensure its completion by 1995. Volunteer tasks varied and included cleaning the site, performing electrical work, cementing and concreting, plumbing and drainage work, fixing windows and transporting materials. In addition to construction efforts, volunteers also organized fundraising initiatives. The aluminum can recycle project was recognized with the 1995 Brent Green Leaf Award for recycling over 7 million aluminum cans. Construction of the mandir complex was completed in 1995.

==History==

The mandir and haveli were built and funded entirely by the Hindu community, and the entire project spanned five years, although the construction itself was completed in two-and-a-half years. Building work began in August 1992. On 24 November 1992, the temple recorded the biggest-ever concrete-pour in the UK, when 4,500 tons were laid in 24 hours to create a foundation mat 6 ft (1.8m) thick. The first stone was laid in June 1993; two years later, the building was complete.

The mandir was cited in &quot;Guinness World Records 2000&quot; as follows:
Since 2000, it has been surpassed in size by other BAPS mandirs elsewhere.

===Overview===

*June 1970: the first BAPS Swaminarayan Mandir in the UK was opened in a converted disused church in Islington, North London, by Yogiji Maharaj.
*1982: having outgrown the temple, the congregation moved from the Islington temple to a small, former warehouse in Neasden.
*1990: BAPS was again in search of a building that could cope with the growing congregation, and plans for the present temple were made.
*1995: they moved to their present temple, built on the site of a disused truck warehouse opposite the previous temple. The old temple building was retained and converted into Shayona, an Indian grocery shop and vegetarian restaurant.

==The Swaminarayan School==

Opposite the Mandir there used to be The Swaminarayan School, Europe&#x27;s first independent Hindu school. Founded in 1992 by Pramukh Swami Maharaj, it followed the National Curriculum, while promoting aspects of Hinduism and Hindu culture, such as dance, music and language.

<doc id="255393" wikidata="Q4595" url="?curid=255393" title="Seychellois rupee">
<text>The rupee is the currency of the Seychelles. It is subdivided into 100 &quot;cents&quot;. In the local Seychellois Creole (Seselwa) language, it is called the &quot;roupi&quot; and roupie in French. The ISO code is SCR. The abbreviation SR is sometimes used for distinction. By population, Seychelles is the smallest country to have an independent monetary policy. Several other currencies are also called rupee.

==Banknotes==

=== British colony ===

The British Legislative Council authorized the establishment of a Board of Commissioners of Currency through the Paper Currency Ordinance of 1914, which was enacted by C. R. M. O&#x27;Brien, the Governor of the Colony of the Seychelles on 10 August 1914. In 1914, the government produced emergency issues of notes for 50c, Re. 1/-, Rs. 5/- and Rs. 10/-.

Standard issue notes began to be issued in 1918, with notes for 50c and Re. 1/-, followed by Rs. 5/-, Rs. 10/- and Rs. 50/- in 1928. The 50c and Re. 1/- notes were issued until 1951 and phased out in favour of coins. Rs. 20/- and Rs. 100/- notes were first introduced in 1968, whilst the Rs. 5/- note was replaced by a coin in 1972.

=== Independent republic ===

In 1976, the Seychelles Monetary Authority took over the issuance of paper money, issuing notes for Rs. 10/-, Rs. 25/-, Rs. 50/- and Rs. 100/-. This series featured the first President of the Seychelles, Sir James Mancham and replaced all colonial notes issued prior to independence.

In 1979, there was a redesign, featuring a more socialist and modernized theme reminiscent of the René regime. This series was also issued by the Central Bank of Seychelles when it took over full responsibility in the same year.

In 1989, a new series was introduced with better security features and colours.

In 1998, another more high-tech series was introduced with a more practical, ergonomic design. This series later saw an additional ₨.500/- note first introduced in 2005.

====2011 update====

On June 7, 2011, the Central Bank of Seychelles issued updated Rs. 50/-, Rs. 100/- and Rs. 500/- notes with improved security features. Each of the three banknotes has a holographic patch instead of a foil sailfish which currently appears on the notes. 
*On the Rs. 50/- note, the silver holographic sailfish alternates between the number 50 and an image of the Aldabra rail, a flightless bird. 
*On the Rs. 100/- note, the gold holographic sailfish alternates between the number 100 and an image of the Seychelles giant tortoise. 
*On the Rs. 500/- note, the gold holographic sailfish alternates between the number 500 and an image of the Seychelles scops owl.

Additional security upgrades include a 2.5-mm wide fluorescent security thread on the Rs. 50/- note, a 2.5-mm wide colour-shifting security thread on the Rs. 100/- note, and a 3-mm wide colour-shifting security thread on the Rs. 500/- note. The notes are also protected by De La Rue&#x27;s unique Gemini technology that fluoresces under ultraviolet light but appears normal in daylight.

The colour schemes of the notes have been revised, with the notes being more green, red, and orange, respectively, than the notes currently in circulation. The new notes also carry the year of printing, as well as the signature of Pierre Frank Laporte, the bank&#x27;s governor. Existing notes remain legal tender and will be removed from circulation as they wear out.

====2016 changes====

In December 2016, the Central Bank of Seychelles issued a new series of banknotes to commemorate 40 years of Seychelles&#x27; independence. The theme of this series is &quot;Seychelles&#x27; Unique Biodiversity - the backbone of the economy&quot;.
