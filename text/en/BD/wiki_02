<text>Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow is a 1973 novel by the American writer Thomas Pynchon. The narrative is set primarily in Europe at the end of World War II and centers on the design, production and dispatch of V-2 rockets by the German military. In particular, it features the quest undertaken by several characters to uncover the secret of a mysterious device, the (&quot;black device&quot;), which is slated to be installed in a rocket with the serial number &quot;00000&quot;.

Traversing a wide range of knowledge, &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; crosses boundaries between high and low culture, between literary propriety and profanity, and between science and speculative metaphysics. It shared the 1974 US National Book Award for Fiction with &quot;A Crown of Feathers and Other Stories&quot; by Isaac Bashevis Singer. Although selected by the Pulitzer Prize jury on fiction for the 1974 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, the Pulitzer Advisory Board was offended by its content, some of which was described as &#x27;unreadable&#x27;, &#x27;turgid&#x27;, &#x27;overwritten&#x27;, and in parts &#x27;obscene&#x27;. No Pulitzer Prize was awarded for fiction that year. The novel was nominated for the 1973 Nebula Award for Best Novel.

&quot;Time&quot; named &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; one of its &quot;All-Time 100 Greatest Novels&quot;, a list of the best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005 and it is considered by many critics to be one of the greatest American novels ever written.

==Structure and chronology==
=== Dedication ===
&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; carries the dedication &quot;For Richard Fariña&quot;. Pynchon had been a good friend of Fariña, a folk singer and novelist, since they had attended Cornell University together. Fariña had died in a motorcycle accident in 1966.

===The title===
&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; is composed of four parts, each segmented into a number of episodes. In the original editions of the book, the episodes were separated by a row of seven small squares. Many readers, reviewers, and scholars, such as Richard Poirier, have suggested that the squares resemble the film perforations known as &quot;sprocket holes&quot; that engage with the teeth in a film camera or projector to advance the strip of film. The squares, however, were inserted by Edwin Kennebeck, an editor at the book&#x27;s original publisher, Viking Press. Kennebeck denied that the layout was intentional, and later editions of the novel separate the segments with only one square.

=== Part 1: &quot;Beyond the Zero&quot; (21 episodes) ===
The name &quot;Beyond the Zero&quot; refers to lack of total extinction of a conditioned stimulus. The events of this part occur primarily during the Christmas Advent season of 1944 from December 18–26, coinciding in part with the Battle of the Bulge. The epigraph is a quotation from a pamphlet written by the rocket scientist Wernher von Braun and first published in 1962: &quot;Nature does not know extinction; all it knows is transformation. Everything science has taught me, and continues to teach me, strengthens my belief in the continuity of our spiritual existence after death.&quot; The epigraph reflects themes of anticipated redemption and blurring of the sacred and secular, both of which pervade Part 1. The epigraph is also potentially ironic, given von Braun&#x27;s central role in the development of Nazi Germany&#x27;s V-2 rocket.

===Part 2: &quot;Une Perm au Casino Hermann Goering&quot; (8 episodes)===
&quot;&quot; is French for &quot;A Furlough at the Hermann Göring Casino&quot;. The events of this section span the five months from Christmas 1944 through to Whitsunday the following year, May 20, 1945. The misrepresentation or reinterpretation of identity is reflected in Slothrop&#x27;s journey as well as the epigraph, attributed to Merian C. Cooper, speaking to Fay Wray prior to her starring role in &quot;King Kong&quot;, as recounted by Wray in the September 21, 1969, issue of &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;You will have the tallest, darkest leading man in Hollywood.&quot;

=== Part 3: &quot;In the Zone&quot; (32 episodes) ===
Part 3 is set during the summer of 1945 with analepses (literary flashbacks) to the time period of Part 2 with most events taking place between May 18 and August 6; the day of the atomic bomb attack on Hiroshima and also the Feast of the Transfiguration. The epigraph is taken from &quot;The Wizard of Oz&quot;, spoken by Dorothy as she arrives in Oz and shows her disorientation with the new environment: &quot;Toto, I have a feeling we&#x27;re not in Kansas any more...&quot;.

===Part 4: &quot;The Counterforce&quot; (12 episodes)===
Part 4 begins shortly after August 6, 1945, and covers the period up to September 14 of that same year; the day of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, with extended analepses to Easter/April Fool&#x27;s weekend of 1945 and culminating in a prolepsis to 1970. The simple epigraphical quotation, &quot;What?&quot; is attributed to Richard M. Nixon, and was added after the galleys of the novel had been printed to insinuate the President&#x27;s involvement in the unfolding Watergate scandal. The original quotation for this section (in the advance reading copies of the book) was an excerpt from the lyrics to the Joni Mitchell song &quot;Cactus Tree&quot; (&quot;She has brought them to her senses/They have laughed inside her laughter/Now she rallies her defenses/For she fears that one will ask her/For eternity/And she&#x27;s so busy being free&quot;), so the change in quotation jumped a large cultural divide.

==Plot==
 Part One: &quot;Beyond the Zero&quot;: The opening pages of the novel follow Pirate Prentice, an employee of the Special Operations Executive (S.O.E.), first in his dreams, and later around the house in wartime London that he shares with several others in the S.O.E. He soon is driven to the site of a V-2 rocket strike. Pirate&#x27;s associate Teddy Bloat photographs a map depicting the sexual encounters of U.S. Army Lt. Tyrone Slothrop, an employee of a fictional technical intelligence unit, ACHTUNG. Slothrop and his background are detailed through discussions by some of his co-workers and through references to his family&#x27;s history, reaching back to early colonial times, in the Berkshire Mountains of western Massachusetts. (There are loose parallels to Pynchon&#x27;s own family history.) Slothrop&#x27;s (fictional) home town of Mingeborough is mentioned for the first time (although the town and a young boy named Hogan Slothrop had previously been featured in Pynchon&#x27;s short story, &quot;The Secret Integration&quot;). That family setting will be mentioned several times much later in the novel, following the family&#x27;s decline over time within a Puritan legacy of sterility and death.

Employees of a fictional top secret psychological warfare agency called PISCES, headquartered at a former insane asylum known as &quot;The White Visitation&quot;, investigate Slothrop&#x27;s map of his presumed sexual encounters in London, finding that each location appears to precede a V-2 rocket strike in the same place by several days. This coincidence intrigues Pavlovian behavioral psychologist Edward W. Pointsman, who thinks there may be a direct causal relationship between Slothrop&#x27;s erections and the missile strikes, and his associate, statistician Roger Mexico, who suggests that the relationship is only a random coincidence of probabilities, as seen in Poisson distributions, leading to further reflections in this section and later on topics as broad as the occult, Determinism, the reverse flow of time, and the sexuality of the rocket itself. Pointsman is all the more intrigued to find that as a baby, Slothrop had been subjected to behavioral experiments conducted by a Dr. Laszlo Jamf that involved the stimulation of his penis to erections.

Many characters not significant until later are introduced in &quot;Beyond the Zero&quot;, including one of Dr. Jamf&#x27;s former students, Franz Pökler, a German engineer who has worked on early German experiments in rocketry and later on the V-2 rocket, and Pökler&#x27;s wife Leni, a former student radical. Others who appear significant in Part One, such as Pointsman&#x27;s associate Thomas Gwenhidwy and Roger Mexico&#x27;s girlfriend Jessica Swanlake, vanish from the narrative and don&#x27;t re-appear until much later. Indeed, most of the 400 named characters make only single appearances, serving merely to demonstrate the sheer scope of Pynchon&#x27;s universe. Character names sometimes consist of outrageous puns (such as &quot;Joaquin Stick&quot;) but may also relate to particular traits of that character or to themes within the novel. Some names of historical characters also have thematic relevance. Under the influence of sodium amytal administered through Pointsman&#x27;s maneuvers, Slothrop has a hallucinatory flashback to a scene in Boston&#x27;s Roxbury district. References here include &quot;Red, the Negro shoeshine boy&quot;, who will much later be known as the Black Power leader Malcolm X, and jazz saxophonist Charlie &quot;Yardbird&quot; Parker, both of whom represent a threat to white racism. Another fictional character, Katje Borgesius, is contacted in this section by Pirate in order to bring her to safety from the Continent to England. Katje had been a Dutch double agent who infiltrated a V-2 rocket-launching battery commanded by a sadistic SS officer named Captain Blicero. Blicero had kept Katje and a young soldier named Gottfried as sex slaves in a perverse enactment of the Hansel and Gretel story. However, Blicero (a Teutonic name connoting Death) is also revealed to be the code name of a former Lieutenant Weissman (&quot;White Man&quot;) who earlier appeared in Pynchon&#x27;s first novel, &quot;V.&quot; He has had an ongoing but now-severed relationship with Enzian, a Herero he had brought to Germany from German South West Africa (now Namibia), and who is the leader of a group of Herero rocket technicians known as the Schwarzkommando, who had been helping Blicero in his own project to create and fire a rocket. Katje, on the other hand, will come under Pointsman&#x27;s control in England, while, as the Christmas season ends, Roger Mexico worries about losing Jessica Swanlake to her other, bureaucratic and sedate, boyfriend, Jeremy (also referred to as &quot;Beaver&quot; because of his beard).

Part Two: &quot;Une Perm au Casino Hermann Goering&quot;: Slothrop is sent away by his superiors under mysterious circumstances to a casino on the recently liberated French Riviera, in which almost the entirety of Part Two takes place. He is in fact being monitored by associates of Pointsman, including Katje and a linguist named Sir Stephen Dodson-Truck. One of the more bizarre Pavlovian episodes involves the conditioning of trained octopus Grigori to attack Katje. Early in part two, the octopus attacks Katje on the beach in France, and Slothrop is &quot;conveniently&quot; at hand to rescue her. Katje and Slothrop eventually have sex. At the Casino, he learns of a rocket with the irregular serial number 00000 (Slothrop comments that the numbering system doesn&#x27;t allow for four zeroes in one serial, let alone five), which features a mysterious component called the S-Gerät (short for Schwarzgerät, &#x27;black device&#x27;), made out of the hitherto unknown plastic Imipolex G. It is hinted that Slothrop&#x27;s prescience of rocket hits is due to being conditioned as an infant by the creator of Imipolex G, Laszlo Jamf. Later, the reality of this story is called into question, as is the very existence of Slothrop&#x27;s original sexual exploits.

Meanwhile, at The White Visitation, Pointsman brings the unit and its mission under his control. The unit&#x27;s nominal commander, Brigadier General Ernest Pudding, who is haunted by his traumatic memories of World War I, is brought to (literal) submission through sado-masochistic rituals with Katje, engineered by Pointsman.

Slothrop becomes increasingly paranoid as old associates disappear. He begins to suspect he is being monitored and adopts the persona (one of many) of &quot;Ian Scuffling&quot;, a British war correspondent. He escapes from the casino into &quot;The Zone&quot;, the coalescing post-war wasteland of Europe, first to Nice in France and then to Switzerland, searching for the 00000 and S-Gerät. In the closing of Part Two, Katje is revealed to be safe in England, enjoying a day at the beach with Roger Mexico and Jessica, as well as Pointsman, who is in charge of Slothrop&#x27;s furtive supervision. While unable to contact Slothrop (or prohibited from contacting him), Katje continues to follow his actions through Pointsman, who is showing greater signs of mental instability.

Part Three, &quot;In The Zone&quot;: Slothrop&#x27;s quest continues for some time as he meets or is chased by other characters, compared at various times to such characters as Orpheus and Wagner&#x27;s Tannhäuser. He learns more about his own past, Dr. Jamf&#x27;s experiments on him, and his father&#x27;s apparent complicity. In this section, Slothrop comes to doubt that his search for the S-Gerat is a Grail quest and finds his paranoia (&quot;the fear that everything is connected&quot;) succumbing to &quot;anti-paranoia&quot; (&quot;the fear that nothing is connected&quot;). On the way he meets Geli Tripping, a self-described witch in love with a Russian colonel, Vaslav Tchitcherine, who had previously worked for the Soviet state bringing the New Turkic Alphabet to central Asia, especially Soviet Kazakhstan, where he had sought a mystical experience referred to as the &quot;Kirghiz Light&quot;. Slothrop and Geli have a near-mystical experience at the summit of the Brocken, the German mountain that was the setting for Walpurgisnacht in Goethe&#x27;s &quot;Faust&quot;. Slothrop&#x27;s travels bring him to Nordhausen, in Germany, and the Mittelwerk, where V-2 rockets were assembled using slave labor from the Dora concentration camp. Confronted by the racist American Major Duane Marvy, he escapes in a slapstick chase.

Slothrop meets members of the Schwarzkommando, a fictional cadre of African rocket technicians, descended from survivors of the Herero genocide of 1904 who were brought to Europe by German colonials. An extensive subplot details a schism within the Schwarzkommando; one faction is bent on a program of racial suicide, while the other finds mystical, semi-religious meaning in the V-2 rocket. Another long subplot details Tchitcherine&#x27;s past and his quest to hunt and kill Enzian, leader of the latter group of Schwarzkommando and, it turns out, Tchitcherine&#x27;s half-brother.

With papers identifying him as former German film star Max Schlepzig in Berlin, Slothrop adopts an operatic Viking costume with the horns removed from the helmet, making it look like a rocket nose-cone and is given the name &quot;Rocketman&quot;. One of the people he meets is the American sailor Pig Bodine (who or whose ancestors appear in most of Pynchon&#x27;s other works). Bodine commissions Slothrop to retrieve a large stash of hashish from the centre of the Potsdam Conference. In the nearby abandoned movie studio that was once the center of the German film industry, Slothrop meets Margherita (Greta) Erdmann, a former silent film actress from the era of German Expressionist film, now in physical and mental decline. Slothrop also comes to meet Gerhardt von Göll, a megalomaniac German director who had previously been seen in Britain, directing a fake propaganda film featuring Black soldiers in Germany. Von Göll is now involved in black market activities. In the longest episode of the book, we learn more of the history of Franz Pökler, who fathered a child, Ilse, with his wife Leni after being aroused by Greta&#x27;s image in an erotic scene in &quot;Alpdrücken&quot;, von Göll&#x27;s &quot;masterpiece&quot;. Greta had also become pregnant in the filming of that scene, producing a daughter of her own, Bianca. While working on the V-2 project, Pökler had been coerced into working on the S-Gerät by Blicero, who was holding Ilse in a concentration camp, allowing her to visit Pökler only once a year. As Ilse ages over several years, however, Pökler becomes increasingly paranoid that she is really a series of impostors sent each year to mollify him. Pökler&#x27;s work for Blicero is tied to the history of organic chemistry, with its own outcomes in the production of dyes and plastics and the international cartels that would come to control them, such as I.G. Farben, and a culture of death-in-life.

Slothrop is led by Margherita to northern Germany and onto the &quot;Anubis&quot;, a private yacht (named for the Egyptian god of the dead) filled with uninhibited European aristocrats. Here, Slothrop has sex with Margherita&#x27;s teenage daughter, Bianca. Margherita, along with her partner, Thanatz, are revealed to know more about the 00000, S-Gerät, and Imipolex G than they let on. Ensign Morituri, a Japanese liaison officer, tells Slothrop about how Margherita and Thanatz had brought their traveling sado-masochistic act to Captain Blicero&#x27;s rocket battery, from which Rocket 00000 had apparently been fired in the spring of 1945, towards the end of the war. Margherita spent many days in a mysterious and ambiguously described factory, where she was clothed in an outfit made from the &quot;erotic&quot; plastic Imipolex G. Slothrop falls overboard and is rescued by black marketeers heading towards Peenemünde, the test site for the V-2 rocket, now occupied by Soviet forces.

Slothrop later returns to the &quot;Anubis&quot; to find Bianca dead, possibly hastening his already hinted-at decline. He continues his pilgrimage through northern Germany, having changed clothing with Tchitcherine, arriving at Lüneberg Heath and the town of Cuxhaven, also sites of tests and launches by Allied forces of captured V-2 rockets. On the way, he again meets Major Marvy, who fails to recognize him. At a village festival, he is invited by children to don the costume of a pre-Christian Pig Hero, &quot;Plechazunga&quot;. Meeting Franz Pökler at the abandoned amusement park where Ilse used to meet her father, Slothrop finds out more about his childhood and the 00000. It becomes steadily apparent that Slothrop is connected to Laszlo Jamf through Lyle Bland, a Slothrop family friend who apparently played a role in funding Jamf&#x27;s experiments on the infant Slothrop. Bland, in turn, is connected to many threads, including pinball machines and the Masons, that implicate him as part of an international conspiracy of industrial cartels.

Slothrop is introduced to and sleeps with Solange, a prostitute who is actually Leni Pökler, recently freed from a concentration camp herself. In the same building, Major Marvy has found Slothrop&#x27;s pig costume and dons it, only to be caught, sedated, and castrated by agents working for Pointsman, who believe that Slothrop is still in the suit. Major political and social realignments have been taking place throughout The Zone. Towards the end of this section, several characters not seen since early in the novel make a return, including Pointsman, who is now in official disgrace, as bureaucratic operatives consider how to deal with him. Other characters, including Pirate Prentice and Katje Borgesius, begin to coalesce as a group styling itself as the &quot;Counterforce&quot; in resistance to the emerging post-war military-industrial complex.

Part Four: The Counterforce: Elements in this section become increasingly fantastic and sometimes self-referential, the narrator at one point saying, &quot;You will want cause and effect. All right&quot; (page 663 in the Viking edition) before explaining how certain events in Part 3 tie in. Despite the efforts of some to save him, Slothrop is repeatedly sidetracked until his persona fragments totally, more than one hundred pages before the novel&#x27;s end. A flashback reveals how Roger Mexico, now in Germany, has come to join the Counterforce despite its inherent contradictions as a group organizing against international organizations. A long digression gives the story of &quot;Byron the Bulb&quot;, a sentient, seemingly immortal lightbulb whose existence links with Dr. Jamf and his experiments and to the integration of power companies and their Grid to the network of cartels. The Schwarzkommando become reunited and finish construction of their own version of the 00000 rocket.

There are several brief, hallucinatory stories of comic, fallible superheroes; silly Kamikaze pilots; and an &quot;Incident in the Transvestites&#x27; Toilet&quot; where Slothrop has been hiding in drag. Such incidents may be products of Slothrop&#x27;s finally collapsed mind; or of the increasingly chaotic state of affairs outside the realm of a rising technological class and society that comes to be labeled the &quot;Raketen-Stadt&quot; (Rocket-State) of the future. For Slothrop, these scenes more or less culminate with his finding, and failing to understand, a headline announcing the atomic bombing of Hiroshima.

Tchitcherine is told by his superior officer that he is to head back to the U.S.S.R. with some German rocket scientists, despite his own misgivings about Marxist dialectics. A conference is held by members of the Counterforce, which now includes some with questionable pasts, personalities, or motives, such as von Göll. Jessica tells Roger that she is going to marry Jeremy/Beaver. Invited to a dinner at the home of a German industrialist, Roger and Pig Bodine manage to escape with the help of some disgusting culinary repartee, but it becomes increasingly clear that the Counterforce does not have the capacity to counter the emerging Rocket State, in part because &quot;the Man has a branch office in each of our brains&quot;.

Some individuals, however, provide some hope. Earlier, Slothrop had encountered the young boy Ludwig on what seems to be a futile quest to find his lost pet lemming. Meeting once again, it turns out that the lemming has been found. Geli Tripping&#x27;s complete love for Tchitcherine and her connection with the natural organic world contrasts with a flashback in which Blicero explains to Gottfried his obsessive desire to transcend nature and &quot;its cycle of infection and death&quot;. Geli does cast a spell on Tchitcherine that (perhaps) keeps him from recognizing Enzian when they finally meet, averting a potentially fatal encounter.

The final identification of Slothrop of any certainty is his picture on the cover of an album by obscure English band &quot;The Fool&quot; (another allusion to Tarot, which becomes increasingly significant), where he is credited as playing the harmonica and kazoo. The hundred pages or so of the novel include titled vignettes that summarize events in Slothrop&#x27;s home town of Mingeborough; offer a (self-referential) reading of the Tarot cards for Weismann/Blicero, who also prepares for a final launch of the 00000 rocket with Gottfried in the nosecone; describe failed last-minute non-rescues by popular culture heroes; and allude to the Sacrifice of Isaac and the mythical figures of Apollo and Orpheus.

As the novel draws to an ambiguous close, the launch of the rocket with Gottfried is intercut with scenes contemporary to the novel&#x27;s publication, at the (fictional) Orpheus (movie) Theater in Los Angeles, managed by a character named &quot;Richard M. Zhlubb&quot;, a thinly-veiled parody of President Richard Nixon. Zhlubb is running a &quot;Bengt Ekerot / Maria Casares Film Festival&quot;. Both actors played personifications of Death, in Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;The Seventh Seal&quot; and Jean Cocteau&#x27;s &quot;Orpheus&quot;, respectively, overt examples of several possible references in the novel to European modernist cinema. The novel concludes as a rocket (perhaps Weissman&#x27;s) is frozen in its last moment of descent above the theater, where the film being projected has broken, and a hymn composed by Slothrop&#x27;s heretical colonial ancestor, William Slothrop, is offered.

==Style==
Poet L. E. Sissman, in his &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; review for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, said of Pynchon: &quot;He is almost a mathematician of prose, who calculates the least and the greatest stress each word and line, each pun and ambiguity, can bear, and applies his knowledge accordingly and virtually without lapses, though he takes many scary, bracing linguistic risks. Thus his remarkably supple diction can first treat a painful and delicate love scene and then roar, without pause, into the sounds and echoes of a drudged and drunken orgy.&quot;

The plot of the novel is complex, containing over 400 characters and involving many different threads of narrative which intersect and weave around one another. The recurring themes throughout the plot are the V-2 rocket, interplay between free will and Calvinistic predestination, breaking the cycle of nature, behavioral psychology, sexuality, paranoia and conspiracy theories such as the Phoebus cartel and the Illuminati. &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; also draws heavily on themes that Pynchon had probably encountered at his work as a technical writer for Boeing, where he edited a support newsletter for the Bomarc Missile Program support unit. The Boeing archives are known to house a vast library of historical V-2 rocket documents, which were probably accessible to Pynchon. The novel is narrated by many distinct voices, a technique further developed in Pynchon&#x27;s much later novel &quot;Against the Day&quot;. The style and tone of the voices vary widely: Some narrate the plot in a highly informal tone, some are more self-referential, and some might even break the fourth wall. Some voices narrate in drastically different formats, ranging from movie-script format to stream of consciousness prose.

The narrative contains numerous descriptions of illicit sexual encounters and drug use by the main characters and supporting cast, sandwiched between dense dialogues or reveries on historic, artistic, scientific, or philosophical subjects, interspersed with whimsical nonsense-poems and allusions to obscure facets of 1940s pop culture. Many of the recurring themes will be familiar to experienced Pynchon readers, including the singing of silly songs, recurring appearances of kazoos, and extensive discussion of paranoia. According to Richard Locke, megalomaniac paranoia is the &quot;operative emotion&quot; behind the novel, and an increasingly central motivator for the many main characters. In many cases, this paranoia proves to be vindicated, as the many plots of the novel become increasingly interconnected, revolving around the identity and purpose of the elusive 00000 Rocket and &quot;Schwarzgerät&quot;. The novel becomes increasingly preoccupied with themes of Tarot, Paranoia, and Sacrifice. All three themes culminate in the novel&#x27;s ending, and the epilogue of the many characters. The novel also features the character Pig Bodine, of Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;V.&quot; Bodine would later become a recurring avatar of Pynchon&#x27;s complex and interconnected fictional universe, making an appearance in nearly all of Pynchon&#x27;s novels thereafter.

Several characters and situations from Pynchon&#x27;s earlier works make at least brief appearances in the novel. Slothrop&#x27;s (fictional) home town of Mingeborough, Massachusetts was the setting for his short story &quot;The Secret Integration&quot;, which featured a young character named Hogan Slothrop, who in retrospect would seem to be Tyrone&#x27;s nephew. Weismann (aka Blicero) and the story of the Herero genocide appeared in the chapter &quot;Mondaugen&#x27;s Story&quot; in &quot;V.&quot; The eponymous character Kurt Mondaugen also reappears in &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. Some early reviewers even suggested that &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; was a sequel to Pynchon&#x27;s first novel, playing on the term &quot;V-2&quot;. In &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, Clayton &quot;Bloody&quot; Chiclitz is a toy manufacturer accompanying Major Marvy, but he appeared later as a defense contract magnate in &quot;The Crying of Lot 49&quot;, and his company, Yoyodyne, was introduced in &quot;V.&quot; Pig Bodine also appeared in &quot;V.&quot; but had his origin in Pynchon&#x27;s early short story &quot;Low-Lands&quot;. Bodine or variants on his name and character also appear in later Pynchon novels. A very minor character in &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, Ronald Cherrycoke, would seem to be a descendant of the Reverend Wicks Cherrycoke, who narrates Pynchon&#x27;s later novel &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot;.

==Publication and critical reception==
Viking Press published &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; on March 14, 1973. Owing to the book&#x27;s length, the hard-cover edition was priced expensively at $15 (equivalent to $ in ). Viking&#x27;s president, Thomas Guinzburg, worried that the novel&#x27;s high price was potentially &quot;inhibiting&quot;, leading the publisher to take the uncommon move of simultaneously publishing a soft-cover edition at $4.95 (equivalent to $ in ).

===Contemporary reception===
On the novel&#x27;s publication, it was reviewed in the &quot;New York Times&quot; by Richard Locke under the headline &quot;One of the Longest, Most Difficult, Most Ambitious Novels in Years&quot;. Locke compared Pynchon&#x27;s writing to that of Vladimir Nabokov, and wrote that &quot;its technical and verbal resources bring to mind Melville and Faulkner. Immersing himself in &#x27;the destructive element&#x27; and exploring paranoia, entropy and the love of death as primary forces in the history of our time, Pynchon establishes his imaginative continuity with the great modernist writers of the early years of this century.&quot; Locke noted that &quot;Pynchon is obviously capable of the most intricate literary structures—plots and counterplots and symbols that twist and tangle in time and space&quot;, but was less impressed by the novel&#x27;s form: &quot;the structure is strained beyond the breaking point. Reading it is often profoundly exasperating; the book is too long and dense; despite the cornucopia of brilliant details and grand themes, one&#x27;s dominant feelings in the last one to two hundred pages are a mounting restlessness, fatigue and frustration.&quot;

Reviewing the novel in the &quot;Saturday Review&quot; in March 1973, Richard Poirier stated that &quot;At thirty-six, Pynchon has established himself as a novelist of major importance.&quot; In the highly positive review, Poirier compared &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; to &quot;Moby Dick&quot; and &quot;Ulysses&quot;, and that it &quot;marks an advance beyond either book in its treatment of cultural inheritance&quot;. Poirier noted the wide range of Pynchon&#x27;s writing and said that &quot;Pynchon is willing and able, that is, to work from a range of perspectives infinitely wider, more difficult to manage, more learned than any to be found elsewhere in contemporary literature. His genius resides in his capacity to see, to see feelingly, how these various perspectives, apparently so diverse and chaotic, are begotten of the same technology, the same supportive structures that have foundations in the theology of the seventeenth century and the science of the nineteenth.&quot; (...) &quot;Pynchon is almost unbearably vulnerable to every aspect of contemporary experience, open to every form of sight and sound, democratically receptive to the most common and the most recondite signatures of things.&quot;

Reviewing the novel in a Swedish publication, author and critic Artur Lundkvist noted Pynchon&#x27;s rare talent but was critical about the wide range of the novel: &quot;Pynchon&#x27;s weakness appears to be criticlessness, a lack of values, indiscriminate inclusion. Nothing is too high or too low to put into his all consuming machinery. But that makes the meaning of his work ambivalent or undetermined, despite the enormous power of expression and energy in his writing.&quot; Lundkvist criticized the influences from popular culture in the novel and concluded &quot;How obvious the frequent transitions between shameless entertainment and ambitious novel art is he runs the risk of repelling two opposite types of readers. Where some find it irresistibly funny others will find it wearisome and boring... Pynchon&#x27;s uncommon flexible and at the same time consumedly schizoid talent runs the risk of drowning in the rampant excess.&quot;

===In retrospective===
Anthony Burgess included &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in his &quot;Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English Since 1939&quot; (1984), writing &quot;this work, not yet as widely understood [as V. or The Crying of Lot 49], has a gravity more compelling than the rainbow technique (high colour, symbolism, prose tricks) would seem to imply&quot;.

&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; lost its Nebula Award nomination to Arthur C. Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;. In 1998, Jonathan Lethem suggested that the novel&#x27;s failure to win the award stands as &quot;a hidden tombstone marking the death of the hope that [science fiction] was about to merge with the mainstream.&quot;

On the 50th anniversary of the publication in February 2023, John Semley positively reviewed &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in &quot;Wired&quot;, noting that: &quot;It is at once a busy almanac of its era and a sort of field guide for our own. It echoes eerily in the new-ish millennium. In a way, our own age&#x27;s greasy stew of absurdity and apocalypticism, creeping death tinged with clown-shoe idiocy, suggests a world that has finally, fatefully, caught up with Pynchon. We are still living under Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow.&quot;

Salman Rushdie has read the character name &quot;Tyrone Slothrop&quot; as an anagram of &quot;Sloth or Entropy&quot;.

==Cultural influence==

Italian scholar described it as the greatest American novel published after the end of the Second World War. Sascha Pöhlmann writing for &quot;The Literary Encyclopedia&quot; stated that it is &quot;often considered as &quot;the&quot; postmodern novel, redefining both postmodernism and the novel in general&quot;. Literary scholar Tony Tanner has hailed it as &quot;both one of the great historical novels of our time and arguably the most important literary text since &quot;Ulysses&quot;&quot;.

Though the book won the National Book Award for 1974, Pynchon chose neither to accept nor acknowledge this award. Thomas Guinzberg of the Viking Press suggested that the comedian &quot;Professor&quot; Irwin Corey accept the award on his behalf, to which Pynchon agreed. Corey&#x27;s comical address at the ceremony was also noteworthy for being interrupted by a streaker crossing the stage.

&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; has been translated to many languages, including French (as &quot;Rainbow&quot;, 1975), Spanish (as &quot;El arco iris de gravedad&quot;, 1978), German (as &quot;Die Enden der Parabel&quot;, 1981) and Serbian (as &quot;Duga gravitacije&quot;, 2019). Episodes of the novel have been translated to Japanese.

&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; was translated into German by Nobel laureate Elfriede Jelinek, and some critics think that it has had a large influence on Jelinek&#x27;s own writing.

===Adaptations===
According to Robert Bramkamp&#x27;s docudrama about the V2 and &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, entitled &quot;Prüfstand VII&quot;, the BBC initiated a project to produce a film adaptation of &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; between 1994 and 1997. Some unfinished footage is included in Bramkamp&#x27;s film. The Bramkamp movie includes other dramatized sequences from the novel as well, while the main focus is on Peenemünde and the V2. The 2011 film &quot;Impolex&quot; by Alex Ross Perry is loosely inspired by &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, the title referring to the fictional polymer Imipolex G used to condition Slothrop in the novel. To commemorate 75 years since the end of World War II, in 2019, German public radio broadcasters SWR 2 and Deutschlandfunk produced a 14-hour radio play in German language which was aired in April 2020.

===Music===

The lyrics of Devo&#x27;s song &quot;Whip It&quot; were inspired by &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; parodies of limericks and poems; Gerald Casale specified:

The lyrics were written by me as an imitation of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s parodies in his book &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;. He had parodied limericks and poems of kind of all-American, obsessive, cult of personality ideas like Horatio Alger and &quot;You&#x27;re #1, there&#x27;s nobody else like you&quot; kind of poems that were very funny and very clever. I thought, &quot;I&#x27;d like to do one like Thomas Pynchon,&quot; so I wrote down &quot;Whip It&quot; one night.

The novel inspired the 1984 song &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Angel&quot; by Laurie Anderson. In her 2004 autobiographical performance &quot;The End of the Moon&quot;, Anderson said she once contacted Pynchon asking permission to adapt &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; as an opera. Pynchon replied that he would allow her to do so only if the opera was written for a single instrument: the banjo. Anderson said she took that as a polite &quot;no&quot;.

German avant-rock group Cassiber incorporated text from the novel in their 1990 album &quot;A Face We All Know&quot;. The use of the text was cleared with Pynchon&#x27;s agent.

Pat Benatar released a 1993 album called &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; after reading Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel. 

&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; is a song by the British band Klaxons, from the album &quot;Myths of the Near Future&quot; (2007).

American progressive rock group Coheed and Cambria&#x27;s song &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Union&quot;, from their science fiction concept album &quot;The Afterman: Descension&quot; (2013), is named in honor of the novel.

Canadian experimental rock group Rei dos Leitoes&#x27;s song &quot;Silent on the Island&quot; (2010) incorporates themes from &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; in its second and fourth Verse passages.

David Lowery of the American alternative rock group Camper Van Beethoven cites &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; as an inspiration for the song &quot;All Her Favorite Fruit&quot; (1989).

The group TV Girl&#x27;s song &quot;Taking What&#x27;s Not Yours&quot;, from &quot;Who Really Cares&quot; references having left &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; at an ex-girlfriend&#x27;s apartment.

British punk/new wave band The Paranoids released &#x27;Theme From Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&#x27; as the &#x27;B&#x27; side to &#x27;The Love Job&#x27; (Hurricane Records (2) – FIRE 14 1980) with a lyric inspired by the novel. Produced by Roy Wood.

American Rock Band The Used released a song sharing the same title as part of their 2020 Album Heartwork. Bert McCracken, the band&#x27;s lead singer, said that &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; is one of his favorite books of all time.

===Art===
New York artist Zak Smith created a series of 760 drawings entitled, &quot;One Picture for Every Page of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s Novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;&quot;, also known by the title &quot;Pictures of What Happens on Each Page of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s Novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;&quot;. Occupying eleven rows and over eleven meters of wall space, the drawings attempt to illustrate, as literally as possible, every page of the book. The piece includes palm trees, shoes, stuffed toys, a lemon meringue pie, Richard Nixon, Sigmund Freud, an iron toad wired to an electric battery, a dominatrix, and other images from the novel. The series had a successful reception at New York&#x27;s 2004 Whitney Biennial event, and was described &quot;as a tour de force of sketching and concept&quot; (Abbe 2004). In November 2006, Tin House Books published, &quot;Pictures Showing What Happens on Each Page of Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s Novel &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;&quot;, the book of Smith&#x27;s &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; drawings .

In 1999 a painting by the American artist Fred Tomaselli, inspired by the novel and titled &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow (Large)&quot;, was added to the permanent collection at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York City.

===Film===
* Benoit Blanc, a character in the 2019 American film &quot;Knives Out&quot;, refers to &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; before admitting that he had not read it. In the standalone sequel, &quot;Glass Onion&quot;, the novel physically appears, being read by Serena Williams.
* An early scene in the 1988 American film &quot;Miracle Mile&quot; features a character played by Denise Crosby taking what appears to be a copy of a (fictional) study guide, &quot;Cliff&#x27;s Notes: Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;, out of a briefcase and studies it for a short time. The film deals with the reaction of characters to an impending nuclear missile attack.
* The novel appears in the film &quot;Interstellar&quot;.

===Video games===
Speaking about his video game &quot;The Witness&quot;, director Jonathan Blow said &quot;I want to make games for people who like to read &quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot;&quot;. He later elaborated:
&quot;Gravity&#x27;s Rainbow&quot; is a very free book in a certain way. It doesn&#x27;t care if you&#x27;re following along exactly. It has a certain freedom and joy to it while also being pretty dark a lot of the time. I can&#x27;t think of a game that has managed this emotional pan-spectrality of being very joyful and playful while simultaneously being bleak.

<text>Jacques Brault (29 March 1933 – 20 October 2022) was a French Canadian poet and translator who lived in Cowansville, Quebec, Canada. He was born to a poor family, but received an excellent education at the Université de Montréal and at the Sorbonne in Paris. He became a professor at the Université de Montréal, in the Département d&#x27;études françaises and the Institut des sciences médiévales, and made frequent appearances as a cultural commentator on Radio-Canada.

Jacques Brault&#x27;s extensive body of writings includes works of outstanding merit in most literary genres. He is the author of plays, novels and works of short fiction, translations and several seminal works of Canadian literary criticism. However, it is primarily for his work as a poet that Jacques Brault is admired by readers and known outside of Canada.

<text>Mount Dana is a mountain in the U.S. state of California. Its summit marks the eastern boundary of Yosemite National Park and the western boundary of the Ansel Adams Wilderness. At an elevation of , it is the second highest mountain in Yosemite (after Mount Lyell), and the northernmost summit in the Sierra Nevada which is over in elevation. Mount Dana is the highest peak in Yosemite that accessible to summit. The mountain is named in honor of James Dwight Dana, who was a professor of natural history and geology at Yale.

Mount Dana is composed of prebatholithic rock that is mostly reddish metamorphic rock, which was composed by metavolcanics of surfacing magma from the Mesozoic Era.

Mount Dana&#x27;s northern face includes a small, receding glacier known as the Dana Glacier. The Dana Meadows lie at the foot of the mountain. From the top, lakes throughout Dana Meadows, Mono Lake, Tioga Peak and many other mountains are in view.

==Hike==
From the Tioga Pass Road there are many easy routes. (), available that lead to the summit along the mountain&#x27;s western or southern slopes. These routes rise in elevation in , (a 20.3% average grade). The trail is not frequently maintained.
There is a clearly marked path leading just above tree line. After topping a ridge, a set of use-paths and ducked routes are present, with the main path running along the easterly ridgeline. Additionally, numerous alternate trail segments begin and end at various points on the southwestern face, making parts of this hike a difficult class 2. The path segments turn into scree toward the summit, where a shallow stone-walled shelter and register are found. Significant snow fields on the mountain slopes can exist late into the summer season. Total round trip hiking time can be anywhere between 3 and 12 hours depending many factors, such as acclimatization to elevation.

After reaching a plateau above the tree line, most vegetation disappears with the exception of lichen and a few high alpine plants such as Sky Pilot (Polemonium eximium). Fauna are largely limited to spiders and insects, such as black/brown grasshoppers. The only mammals other than humans are American Pikas (which are lagomorphs, related to rabbits) and marmots.

Thunderstorms are known to arise suddenly, making the rocks slippery, and the hiking dangerous year round.

Even experienced hikers can face altitude sickness, due to the high elevation.

In the summer of 2009, an NPS employee died after falling on a technical rock climbing route on the northeast face of Mount Dana.

<text>Religious art is a visual representation of religious ideologies and their relationship with humans. Sacred art directly relates to religious art in the sense that its purpose is for worship and religious practices. According to one set of definitions, artworks that are inspired by religion but are not considered traditionally sacred remain under the umbrella term of religious art, but not sacred art.

Other terms often used for art of various religions are cult image, usually for the main image in a place of worship, icon in its more general sense (not restricted to Eastern Orthodox images), and &quot;devotional image&quot; usually meaning a smaller image for private prayer or worship. Images can often be divided into &quot;iconic images&quot;, just showing one or more figures, and &quot;narrative images&quot; showing moments from an episode or story involving sacred figures.

The use of images has been controversial in many religions. The term for such opposition is aniconism, with iconoclasm being the deliberate destruction of images by people of the same religion.

==Buddhist art==


Buddhist art originated on the Indian subcontinent following the historical life of Siddhartha Gautama, 6th to 5th century BC, and thereafter evolved by contact with other cultures as it spread throughout Asia and the world.

Buddhist art followed believers as the dharma spread, adapted, and evolved in each new host country. It developed to the north through Central Asia and into Eastern Asia to form the Northern branch of Buddhist art.

Buddhist art followed to the east as far as Southeast Asia to form the Southern branch of Buddhist art.

In India, the Buddhist art flourished and even influenced the development of Hindu art, until Buddhism nearly disappeared in India around the 10th century due in part to the vigorous expansion of Islam alongside Hinduism.

===Tibetan Buddhist art===
Most Tibetan Buddhist artforms are related to the practice of Vajrayana or Buddhist tantra.
Tibetan art includes thangkas and mandalas, often including depictions of Buddhas and bodhisattvas. Creation of Buddhist art is usually done as a meditation as well as creating an object as aid to meditation. An example of this is the creation of a sand mandala by monks; before and after the construction prayers are recited, and the form of the mandala represents the pure surroundings (palace) of a Buddha on which is meditated to train the mind. The work is rarely, if ever, signed by the artist. Other Tibetan Buddhist art includes metal ritual objects, such as the vajra and the phurba.

===Indian Buddhist art===
Two places suggest more vividly than any others the vitality of Buddhist cave painting from about the 5th century AD. One is Ajanta, a site in India long forgotten until discovered in 1817. The other is Dunhuang, one of the great oasis staging posts on the Silk Road...The paintings range from calm devotional images of the Buddha to lively and crowded scenes, often featuring the seductively full-breasted and narrow-waisted women more familiar in Indian sculpture than in painting.

===Chinese Buddhist art===
==Christian art==

Christian sacred art is produced in an attempt to illustrate, supplement and portray in tangible form the principles of Christianity, though other definitions are possible. It is to make imagery of the different beliefs in the world and what it looks like. Most Christian groups use or have used art to some extent, although some have had strong objections to some forms of religious image, and there have been major periods of iconoclasm within Christianity.

Most Christian art is allusive, or built around themes familiar to the intended observer. Images of Jesus and narrative scenes from the Life of Christ are the most common subjects, especially the images of Christ on the Cross.

Scenes from the Old Testament play a part in the art of most Christian denominations. Images of the Virgin Mary, holding the infant Jesus, and images of saints are much rarer in Protestant art than that of Roman Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy.

For the benefit of the illiterate, an elaborate iconographic system developed to conclusively identify scenes. For example, Saint Agnes depicted with a lamb, Saint Peter with keys, Saint Patrick with a shamrock. Each saint holds or is associated with attributes and symbols in sacred art.

===History===

Early Christian art survives from dates near the origins of Christianity. The oldest surviving Christian paintings are from the site at Megiddo, dated to around the year 70, and the oldest Christian sculptures are from sarcophagi, dating to the beginning of the 2nd century. Until the adoption of Christianity by Constantine Christian art derived its style and much of its iconography from popular Roman art, but from this point grand Christian buildings built under imperial patronage brought a need for Christian versions of Roman elite and official art, of which mosaics in churches in Rome are the most prominent surviving examples. 
Christian art would soon become the foundation of churches across Europe. Stained glass windows often depict biblical scenes to be reflected across the inner workings of the building. Murals and altarpiece art also fill churches with intricate and expressive Christian images.

During the development of early Christian art in the Byzantine Empire (see Byzantine art), a more abstract aesthetic replaced the naturalism previously established in Hellenistic art. This new style was hieratic, meaning its primary purpose was to convey religious meaning rather than accurately render objects and people. Realistic perspective, proportions, light and colour were ignored in favour of geometric simplification of forms, reverse perspective and standardized conventions to portray individuals and events. The controversy over the use of &quot;graven images&quot;, the interpretation of the Second Commandment, and the crisis of Byzantine Iconoclasm led to a standardization of religious imagery within the Eastern Orthodoxy.

The Renaissance saw an increase in monumental secular works, but until the Protestant Reformation Christian art continued to be produced in great quantities, both for churches and clergy and for the laity. During this time, Michelangelo Buonarroti painted the Sistine Chapel and carved the famous &quot;Pietà&quot;, Gianlorenzo Bernini created the massive columns in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, and Leonardo da Vinci painted the &quot;Last Supper&quot;. The Reformation had a huge effect on Christian art, rapidly bringing the production of public Christian art to a virtual halt in Protestant countries, and causing the destruction of most of the art that already existed.

As a secular, non-sectarian, universal notion of art arose in 19th-century Western Europe, secular artists occasionally treated Christian themes (Bouguereau, Manet). Only rarely was a Christian artist included in the historical canon (such as Rouault or Stanley Spencer). However many modern artists such as Eric Gill, Marc Chagall, Henri Matisse, Jacob Epstein, Elisabeth Frink and Graham Sutherland have produced well-known works of art for churches. Through a social interpretation of Christianity, Fritz von Uhde also revived the interest in sacred art, through the depiction of Jesus in ordinary places in life.

Since the advent of printing, the sale of reproductions of pious works has been a major element of popular Christian culture. In the 19th century, this included genre painters such as Mihály Munkácsy. The invention of color lithography led to broad circulation of holy cards. In the modern era, companies specializing in modern commercial Christian artists such as Thomas Blackshear and Thomas Kinkade, although widely regarded in the fine art world as kitsch, have been very successful.

The last part of the 20th and the first part of the 21st century have seen a focused effort by artists who claim faith in Christ to re-establish art with themes that revolve around faith, Christ, God, the Church, the Bible and other classic Christian themes as worthy of respect by the secular art world. Art could then be used to cultivate the church to participate in Christianity once again. Artists such as Makoto Fujimura have had significant influence both in sacred and secular arts. Other notable artists include Larry D. Alexander, Gary P. Bergel, Carlos Cazares, Bruce Herman, Deborah Sokolove, and John August Swanson.

== Confucian art ==
Confucian art is inspired by Confucianism, coined after the Chinese philosopher and politician Confucius. Confucian art originated in China, then spread westwards on the Silk Road, southward down to southern China and then onto Southeast Asia, and eastwards through northern China on to Japan and Korea. While it still maintains a strong influence within Indonesia, Confucian influence on western art has been limited. While Confucian themes enjoyed representation in Chinese art centers, they are fewer in comparison to the number of artworks that are about or influenced by Daoism and Buddhism.

=== History ===
Prior to the Han dynasty, the Chinese art hierarchy considered music as the highest form of art and dismissed calligraphy, poetry, and painting as art forms and craft practiced by the lower class. Nevertheless, poetry was also popular during Confucius&#x27;s time, and poetry was both praised and ranked high in status with music. According to Confucius and his disciples, music strives to create and reflect harmony in the world; hence, education should begin with the foundations of poetry and moral behavior, and conclude with music. Over time, the development of the Chinese writing system promoted the growth of calligraphy and visual arts in terms of social status. Confucian aesthetics and values further contributed to the development of these visual art forms, with landscape paintings and calligraphy works centralizing on the written works and teachings of Confucianism.

==Hindu art==

Hinduism, with its 1 billion followers, it makes up about 15% of the world&#x27;s population and as such the culture that ensues it is full of different aspects of life that are effected by art. There are 64 traditional arts that are followed that start with the classics of music and range all the way to the application and adornment of jewellery. Since religion and culture are inseparable with Hinduism recurring symbols such as the gods and their reincarnations, the lotus flower, extra limbs, and even the traditional arts make their appearances in many sculptures, paintings, music, and dance.

==Islamic art==

A prohibition against depicting representational images in religious art, as well as the naturally decorative nature of Arabic script, led to the use of calligraphic decorations, which usually involved repeating geometrical patterns and vegetal forms (arabesques) that expressed ideals of order and nature. These were used on religious architecture, carpets, and handwritten documents. Islamic art has reflected this balanced, harmonious world-view. It focuses on spiritual essence rather than physical form.

While there has been an aversion to potential idol worship through Islamic history, this is a distinctly modern Sunni view. Persian miniatures, along with medieval depictions of Muhammad and angels in Islam, stand as prominent examples contrary to the modern Sunni tradition. Also, Shi&#x27;a Muslims are much less averse to the depiction of figures, including the Prophet&#x27;s as long as the depiction is respectful.

===Figure representation===
The Islamic resistance to the representation of living beings ultimately stems from the belief that the creation of living forms is unique to God. It is for this reason that the role of images and image makers has been controversial.

The strongest statements on the subject of figural depiction are made in the Hadith (Traditions of the Prophet), where painters are challenged to &quot;breathe life&quot; into their creations and threatened with punishment on the Day of Judgment. 

The Qur&#x27;an is less specific but condemns idolatry and uses the Arabic term musawwir (&quot;maker of forms&quot;, or artist) as an epithet for God. Partially as a result of this religious sentiment, figures in painting were often stylized and, in some cases, the destruction of figurative artworks occurred. Iconoclasm was previously known in the Byzantine period and aniconicism was a feature of the Judaic world, thus placing the Islamic objection to figurative representations within a larger context. As ornament, however, figures were largely devoid of any larger significance and perhaps therefore posed less challenge.
As with other forms of Islamic ornamentation, artists freely adapted and stylized basic human and animal forms, giving rise to a great variety of figural-based designs.

===Arabesque===
Arabesque is a decorative art style characterized by repetitive, intricate patterns of intertwined plants and abstract curvilinear motifs. 
It is believed to have originated in the Islamic world, and its use spread throughout the Middle East, Europe, and North Africa. It has played an important role in Islamic art, often serving as a form of religious expression. The term &quot;arabesque&quot; is a French term derived from the Italian word arabesco, meaning &quot;in the Arabic style&quot; 
Arabesque patterns can be found in various media, including ceramics, architecture, calligraphy, and textiles. Since the 19th century, Arabesque art has been highly influential in Western art and design, with many designers and artists incorporating patterns into their work.

===Calligraphy===
Calligraphy is a highly regarded element of Islamic art. The Qur&#x27;an was transmitted in Arabic, and inherent within the Arabic script is the potential for ornamental forms. The employment of calligraphy as ornament had a definite aesthetic appeal but often also included an underlying talismanic component. While most works of art had legible inscriptions, not all Muslims would have been able to read them. One should always keep in mind, however, that calligraphy is principally a means to transmit a text, albeit in a decorative form.
From its simple and primitive early examples of the 5th and 6th century AD, the Arabic alphabet developed rapidly after the rise of Islam in the 7th century into a beautiful form of art. The main two families of calligraphic styles were the dry styles, called generally the Kufic, and the soft cursive styles, which include Naskhi, Thuluth, Nastaliq and many others.

===Geometry===

Geometric patterns make up one of the three non-figural types of decoration in Islamic art. Whether isolated or used in combination with non-figural ornamentation or figural representation, geometric patterns are popularly associated with Islamic art, largely due to their aniconic quality. These abstract designs not only adorn the surfaces of monumental Islamic architecture but also function as the major decorative element on a vast array of objects of all types.

Types Of Geometric Styles
Geometric patterns are frequently associated with Islamic art, partly because of their iconic appeal, whether used alone or in conjunction with figural depiction or non-configurable adornment. These abstract patterns are used as the primary ornamental feature on various items of all kinds, in addition to adorning the surfaces of massive Islamic buildings. Although geometric ornamentation may have peaked in the Islamic world, the Greeks, Romans and Sasanians in Iran were the sources for geometric shapes and elaborate patterns. Islamic artists incorporated significant components of the classical past to invent a new form of decoration that highlighted the vitality of order and unity. Islamic astronomers, mathematicians and scientists contributed these forms, which were crucial for their type of art style.

History And Design

Geometric shapes resemble the arabesque design found in many vegetal designs in terms of its abstraction, repeated motifs and symmetry. Geometric designs frequently coexist with calligraphic decoration. Circles and interlaced circles, squares or four-sided polygons are the typical star pattern resulting from squares and triangles inscribed in a circle. Multi-sided polygons are the four fundamental shapes or “repeat units” from which the more complex patterns are built. It is evident, however, that the intricate designs found on several things come in various sizes and configurations, making them suitable for inclusion more than category.

The geometric shape of the circle is used in Islamic art to signify the fundamental symbol of oneness and the ultimate course of all diversity in creation. As the illustration below shows, many classic Islamic patterns have ritual beginnings in the circle&#x27;s raw partition into regular sections.

Four circle divisions resulted in the above pattern, created in Yazd, Iran, in the fifteenth century. From there, a regular grid of triangles is created, and then the design is added on top of it. See how the intricate pattern intertwines with the fundamental design, shown in the images above as a white outline.

Alhambra Palace Geometry

Geometric patterns, biomorphic design (arabesque) and calligraphy are expertly combined in the Alhambra in Spain from the 14th century. Islamic art is made up of these three separate but complementary fields. They are arranged in a three-tiered hierarchy, with geometry at the button. This is frequently indicated by its use on the lower portions of walls or floors, as in the example above.

The decorative features used use a variety of symmetries that are now recognized as belonging to separate mathematical groups, yet the patterns’ delicacy and elegance are unmatched in contemporary mathematical thought. Although it was once customary in Islam to use geometric shapes, these designs are works of architecture. Since the eighth century, Muslim calligraphers and geometric pattern designers have decorated mosques, castles and manuscripts. Most often, Islamic geometric designs are employed in places of worship as a way to exalt God. Grand structures made by divine geometry include buildings, gardens and floors.
The Blue Mosque Geometry

There are observable patterns spanning a thousand years of Islamic history and throughout the entire Islamic world since these geometric patterns are also connected to Islamic culture. In some pieces of architecture, Islamic architects follow the same guidelines, such as in the Blue Mosque and the Alhambra in Granada pictured above. The Alhambra palace in Spain and the Samarkand mosque in Uzbekistan are just two examples of the art of repeated geometric designs that can be seen worldwide.

== Jain art ==

Jain art refers to religious works of art associated with Jainism. Even though Jainism spread only in some parts of India, it has made a significant contribution to Indian art and architecture.

== Mandaean art ==
Mandaean art can be found in illustrated manuscript scrolls called &quot;diwan&quot;. Mandaean scroll illustrations, usually labeled with lengthy written explanations, typically contain abstract geometric drawings of uthras that are reminiscent of cubism or prehistoric rock art.

== Sikh art ==
The art, culture, identity, and societies of the Sikhs has been merged with different locality and ethnicity of different Sikhs into categories such as &#x27;Agrahari Sikhs&#x27;, &#x27;Dakhni Sikhs&#x27; and &#x27;Assamese Sikhs&#x27;; however there has emerged a niche cultural phenomenon that can be described as &#x27;Political Sikh&#x27;. The art of diaspora Sikhs such as Amarjeet Kaur Nandhra, and Amrit and Rabindra Kaur Singh (The Singh Twins), is partly informed by their Sikh spirituality and influence.

=== Images of the Sikh Gurus ===
Sikhism was founded in the 16th century by Guru Nanak, who was first painted more than 200 years after he lived. The widely popular portraits of the ten Sikh gurus only appeared in the first half of the 18th century. One of the first set of paintings of the Gurus were commissioned by Baba Ram Rai, the eldest son of the seventh Sikh guru, Guru Har Rai.

Most of the early portraits of the Sikh Gurus were painted in courtly Mughal style. Under the Mughal empire, Punjabi artists at the time became trained in the Mughal style of painting, resulting in their work being highly influenced by the Mughal style of art. The early portraits of the Sikh Gurus and the elements in them, like their outfits, turbans, and poses, looked similar to Mughal nobles and princes. The Gurus are identified in Devanagari, Gurmukhi, and Persian scripts, also composed in the Mughal style. In a painting from around 1750, the sixth Sikh guru is depicted in courtly Mughal dress and setting.

One of the first images of Guru Nanak depicts him as a pious, religious man with simple clothes and a rosary held in his hand, portraying his contemplative nature. The earlier of the ten Gurus have their images modeled on Guru Nanak&#x27;s piety and simplicity. A transformation can be noticed with the sixth Guru when elements of political resistance and power are added, showing Sikh political struggles at the time. Further, with Guru Gobind Singh, elements of grandeur were added, such as royal attire, precious jewels, elegant shoes, a grand turban, and a warrior-like sword.  

The Gurus are also extensively depicted in the Janamsakhis (hagiographies of the Guru). There are many paintings and depictions of Guru Nanak&#x27;s life, specifically in the B-40 Janamsakhi. He is shown growing up from a little boy to a teenager to a youth, and then into a middle-aged man and eventually an old, wise man. The images also depict many core Sikh values along with the Political and Cultural forces that influenced his life and religion.

=== Sikh Art and Architecture during Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s Reign ===
Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s reign (1801-1839) holds prime importance in Sikh history. He was a great patron of art and architecture and sponsored the construction of many magnificent forts, palaces, temples, gurdwaras, precious jewels, clothes, colorful paintings, minting of coins and luxury tents and canopies. The most significant of these were the golden throne built by Hafez Muhammad Multani and the bejewelled canopy for the Guru Granth Sahib.

Ranjit Singh&#x27;s most remarkable contribution was the refurbishment of the Harmandir Sahib. He invited skilled architects, artists, wood carvers and other craftsmen to Amritsar for the renovation. He also hired a technical expert for the gold plating of the Harmandir Sahib. The Harmandir Sahib is now embellished with semi-precious stones like lapis lazulli and onyx along with its marble walls on the exterior. The walls also boast Arabesque and kaleidoscopic designs. The interior is lined with mirrors and colorful glass and its upper part is covered with gilded copper plates.
Besides the Harmandir Sahib, Ranjit Singh also contributed to the embellishments many other gurdwaras, drawing spectacular imagery from the Guru Granth Sahib, the lives of the Gurus and the Janamsakhis. He also contributed to temples and mosques, with one of the most significant ones being expensive silver doors at a Hindu temple of Goddess Kali. Under Maharaja Ranjit Singh, cities like Lahore, Amritsar, Multan, Sialkot, Srinagar and Patiala thrived as centres of the arts.

==Taoist art==

Taoist art (also spelled as Daoist art) relates to the Taoist philosophy and narratives of Lao-tzu (also spelled as Laozi) that promote &quot;living simply and honestly and in harmony with nature.&quot;

==Religious Symbolism and Iconography==
Across many religions, symbols or icons are used to represent specific beliefs. These small pieces of art are summaries of religion which can and have been used by many to imply what their beliefs are. For example, Christianity being symbolized by the cross icon and Islam being symbolized by the image of the star and crescent.

<text>Warren Defever (first name often spelled Warn; born April 30, 1969) is a musician and producer, originally from Livonia, Michigan, and now based in Detroit. He is most known for his chameleonic project His Name Is Alive, though he is active in numerous other circles. He produced, engineered, and/or remixed recordings by Iggy and the Stooges, Easy Action, Low, Ida, Michael Hurley, Califone, Yoko Ono, Thurston Moore, the Gories, the Go, Nomo, Saturday Looks Good to Me, Ethan Daniel Davidson, Faruq Z. Bey, the Von Bondies, Reba Fritz, Destroy All Monsters, Jenny Toomey, Slumber Party, John Sinclair, Elizabeth Mitchell, and Lisa Loeb, as well as HNIA offshoot Velour 100.

Defever was raised in a strict religious household, along with his brothers, Johnny and Matt. He grew up a music fan. His grandfather was a musician from Saskatchewan and had taught Warren and his brothers how to play various musical instruments. 

Defever began recording while still in high school, and toured as the bassist of psychobilly rock band Elvis Hitler. 

For many years, Defever recorded in the basement of his parents&#x27; house, which he later bought from them. 

Around the same time His Name Is Alive was departing from 4AD Records, Defever opened his own recording studio, Brown Rice, in the Detroit area. Along with Davin Brainard, Defever runs a home record label, timeSTEREO.

In 2007, Defever opened The UFO Factory, a new studio in Detroit. Everything inside was painted silver, including the piano.

<text>LDraw is a system of freeware tools and a 3D graphics file format standard for modeling Lego creations.

== History ==
The LDraw file format and original program were written by James Jessiman, although the file format has since evolved and extended. He also modeled many of the original parts in the parts library, which is under continuous maintenance and extension by the LDraw community.

Following Jessiman&#x27;s death in 1997, a variety of programs have been written that use the LDraw parts library, and file format. LDraw models are frequently rendered in POV-Ray or Blender, free 3D ray tracers.

=== LDraw.org ===
In 2003, &quot;LDraw.org&quot; organization has been established, which main task is set to further develop LDraw file format and extend LDraw parts library. Organization is controlled by members of &quot;LDraw.org Steering Committee&quot; (&quot;LSC&quot; for short), elected by users of &quot;LDraw.org&quot; forum. Core members of LDraw.org are in close ties with James Jessiman&#x27;s family, which is the owner of the &quot;LDraw&quot;™ registered trademark.

=== James Jessiman Memorial Award ===
Since 2001, LDraw.org project org&#x27;s awards notable contributors with the James Jessiman Memorial Award.

Recipient is selected by LDraw.org Steering Committee, and approved after a consultation with Jessiman&#x27;s family.

==File format==

LDraw file format describes &quot;part&quot; (representation of Lego brick) as a set of geometric primitives (&quot;p&quot;) in a form of polygonal triangulated mesh.

LDraw &quot;models&quot; consists of LDraw &quot;parts&quot;, same way as Lego models consists of Lego bricks.

LDraw file format is plain text file format, and uses comma-separated syntax definition of values.

=== Units ===
LDU (LDraw Units) — is a base distance unit used in the LDraw format, equals to 1/20 of pin step (distance between centers of 2 closest pins on plate), which in turn almost equals to 0.4 millimetre.

Some editors (like, LeoCAD) displaying dimensions and coordinates using only LDU. For measuring and converting sizes from LDU to other units and vice versa, LDraw users created few parts in a form of ruler, that could be used directly in LDraw editors during visual modeling, that especially useful for scale model making.

=== Scale ===

LDraw, same as Lego, uses 1:42½ (Lego minifigure scale) as base for scaling real world object for scale modeling. Its may drift between 1:40 to 1:43, which are popular among other interests.

=== Specification ===

The LDraw format can divide a model into steps so that the building instructions can be incorporated into the design, and also allows for steps that rotate the camera and even move parts around in an elementary fashion. It also allows for models to be incorporated in the construction of larger models to make design easier. This also makes the file format space efficient: instead of specifying the polygons of every single stud of a specific brick for example, a shared stud file is included multiple times with transformation applied.

Parts, models, sub-models and polygons are all treated the same and are not specific to Lego models (only the parts library is). The format could be used to store any type of 3D model. Some have created bricks of other building systems for use with LDraw.

The following main three filename extensions are used by LDraw:
* files implementing a part, subpart or primitive use codice_1
* a Lego model consisting of 1 or more bricks use codice_2
* multiple codice_2 files can be aggregated into files of type codice_4

The file format uses plain text data, and uses the charset UTF-8 without BOM.

The above code defines the basic 2×2 brick. It consists of a five-sided box (&quot;box5.dat&quot;, outside) and an inverted five-sided box (inside), the connection between those two, consisting of four quads (the four lines starting with &quot;4&quot;), the four studs on top of it (&quot;stud.dat&quot;) and the long hollow stud in the inside (&quot;stud4.dat&quot;).

All lines in an LDraw file are either empty or start with a &quot;command number&quot;, where 0 means no command (though over time, some lines starting with 0 followed by specific text in capitals also got a meaning as meta commands). The command 1 for example includes a subfile. It specifies the file&#x27;s path and a transformation matrix that should be applied to it, as well as its color (where &quot;16&quot; means &quot;use the color that was used when including the current file&quot;). Command 4 specifies a four-sided polygon. There are also commands that define 2D lines. Such lines give the parts a clear contour even in non-shaded orthographic renderings.

<text>The piculets are a distinctive subfamily, Picumninae, of small woodpeckers which occur mainly in tropical South America, with just three Asian and one African species.

Like the true woodpeckers, piculets have large heads, long tongues which they use to extract their insect prey and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward, and two backwards. However, they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk.

Their bills are shorter and less dagger-like than the true woodpeckers, so they look for insects and grubs mainly in decaying wood. Similarly, they re-use woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.

Typically these birds have grey or dull green upperparts and dark-streaked white underparts.

==Systematics and evolution==
Although not well known from fossils, the evolution of piculets is now considered rather straightforward. The disjunct occurrence of the genera, with one African species of the Southeast Asian &quot;Sasia&quot; and one Southeast Asian species of the American &quot;Picumnus&quot; is of comparatively recent origin. Molecular dating, calibrated with geographic events in the absence of a good fossil record, points at the Late Miocene, c. 8 MYA, as the point where the two genera divided into their two respective lineages. At that time, there was a notable global cooling period. The molecular distances between piculets and woodpeckers are comparatively small for subfamilies, agreeing with the hypothesis that the split between the three groups of woodpecker-like picids subfamilies occurred only during the Miocene climatic optimum, around 15 MYA. The later radiation of South American piculets is probably due to changes in topology and climate fluctuations during the Pliocene and Pleistocene. The genus &quot;Verreauxia&quot; may be accepted because of pronounced morphological similarities, but the two &quot;Picumnus&quot; lineages, despite having diverged long ago, are virtually alike except for head coloration.

The Antillean piculet (&quot;Nesoctites micromegas&quot;) has proven to be a very distinct species evolutionarily between piculets and woodpeckers and thus is nowadays placed in a subfamily of its own.

The arrangement of species in the genera is as follows

<text>Doyle Frank Brunson (August 10, 1933 – May 14, 2023) was an American poker player who played professionally for over 60 years. He was a two-time World Series of Poker (WSOP) Main Event champion, a Poker Hall of Fame inductee, and the author of several books on poker.

Brunson was the first player to win $1 million in poker tournaments. He won ten WSOP bracelets throughout his career, tied with Johnny Chan and Erik Seidel for third all time, behind Phil Hellmuth&#x27;s seventeen and Phil Ivey&#x27;s eleven. He is also one of only four players to have won the Main Event at the World Series of Poker multiple times, which he did in 1976 and 1977. He is also one of only three players, along with Bill Boyd and Loren Klein, to have won WSOP tournaments in four consecutive years. In addition, he is the first of six players to win both the WSOP Main Event and a World Poker Tour title. In January 2006, &quot;Bluff&quot; magazine voted Brunson the most influential force in the world of poker.

On June 11, 2018, Brunson announced he was retiring from tournament poker that summer. That day, he entered the $10,000 2–7 Single Draw at the 2018 WSOP. He made the final table and finished in sixth place, earning $43,963.

==Early life==
Doyle Frank Brunson was born in Longworth, Texas, on August 10, 1933, as one of three children. He went to Sweetwater High School where he excelled at athletics. In the 1950 Texas Interscholastic Track Meet, he won the one-mile event with a time of 4:43. After receiving offers from many colleges, he attended Hardin–Simmons University in Abilene, Texas.

The Minneapolis Lakers of the NBA showed interest in Brunson, but a knee injury ended his hopes of becoming a professional basketball player. He occasionally required a crutch because of the injury and had said that breaking his leg ruined his lifetime dream of playing in the NBA. Brunson obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1954 and a master&#x27;s degree in administrative education the following year with plans to become a school principal.

Brunson had begun playing poker before his injury, playing five-card draw. He played more often after being injured, and his winnings paid for his expenses. After graduating, he took a job with Burroughs Corporation as a salesman for their business machines. On his first day, he was invited to play in a seven-card stud game and won more than a month&#x27;s salary. He soon left the company and became a professional poker player.

==Poker career==

Brunson started by playing in illegal games on Exchange Street in Fort Worth with friend Dwayne Hamilton. Eventually, they began traveling around Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana, playing in bigger games, and meeting fellow professionals Amarillo Slim and Sailor Roberts. The illegal games Brunson played in during this time were usually run by criminals who were often members of organized crime, so rules were not always enforced. Brunson had recounted the violence and criminality of that era, such as the time a player at another table was shot and killed during a game.

Hamilton moved back to Fort Worth while the others teamed up and traveled together, gambling on poker, golf, and, in Doyle&#x27;s words, &quot;just about everything&quot;. They pooled their money for gambling. After six years, they made their first serious trip to Las Vegas and lost all of it, almost six figures. They decided to stop playing as partners but remained friends.

Brunson finally settled in Las Vegas. He was a regular player at the World Series of Poker since its inception in 1970, playing in the Main Event nearly every year since then, in addition to many of the other preceding bracelet-awarding events. He made some WSOP championship event final tables before his back-to-back wins, but since this was when the event was winner-take-all, they are not counted as cashes. Besides his two championship wins in 1976 and 1977, Brunson&#x27;s other Main Event cashes are: 1972 (3rd), 1980 (runner-up to three-time Main Event winner Stu Ungar), 1982 (4th), 1983 (3rd), 1997 (16th), 2004 (53rd), and 2013 (409th).

Brunson authored &quot;Super/System&quot;, which is widely considered one of the most authoritative books on poker. Originally self-published in 1978, &quot;Super/System&quot; was the book credited with transforming poker by giving ordinary players insight into how professionals such as Brunson played and won, so much so that Brunson believed that it cost him a lot of money. An updated revision, &quot;Super/System 2&quot;, was published in 2004. Besides Brunson, several top poker players contributed chapters to &quot;Super/System&quot; including Bobby Baldwin, Mike Caro, David Sklansky, Chip Reese, and Joey Hawthorne. The book is subtitled &quot;How I made one million dollars playing poker&quot; by Doyle Brunson. Brunson is also the author of &quot;Poker Wisdom of a Champion&quot;, originally published as &quot;According to Doyle&quot; by Lyle Stuart in 1984.

Brunson continued to play in the biggest poker games in the world, including a $4,000/$8,000 limit mixed poker game in &quot;Bobby&#x27;s Room&quot; at the Bellagio. He also played in many of the biggest poker tournaments around the world. He won his ninth gold bracelet in a mixed games event in 2003, and in 2004, he finished 53rd (in a field of 2,576) in the No Limit Texas hold &#x27;em Championship event. He won the Legends of Poker World Poker Tour (WPT) event in 2004 (garnering him a $1.1 million prize). He finished fourth in the WPT&#x27;s first championship event.

Early in the morning on July 1, 2005, less than a week after Chan had won his 10th gold bracelet (presented to each WSOP tournament winner) – setting a new record – Brunson tied him at the 2005 WSOP by winning the $5,000 No Limit Shorthanded Texas Hold&#x27;em event. He was six bracelets behind Phil Hellmuth, who earned his 16th bracelet at the 2021 World Series of Poker. He cashed in the 2013 World Series of Poker $10,000 No Limit Hold&#x27;em Championship event, marking the fifth decade he had cashed in the event. Doyle temporarily came out of retirement from tournament play to participate in the 2021 WSOP No-Limit Hold-Em Master of Ceremonies Invitational, placing 5th behind Phil Hellmuth (4th), Norman Chad (3rd), Lon McEachern (2nd), and Vince Vaughn (1st).

As of 2023, his total live tournament winnings exceed $6,100,000. He totaled over $3,000,000 in earnings from his 37 cashes at the WSOP.

Brunson had two Texas hold&#x27;em hands named after him. The holding of ten-deuce bears his name because he won the No Limit Hold &#x27;Em event at the World Series of Poker two years in a row with a ten and a two (1976 and 1977), in both cases completing a full house as an underdog in the final hand. The other hand known as a &quot;Doyle Brunson&quot;, especially in Texas, is the ace and queen of any suit because, in his words, he &quot;[tries] never to play this hand&quot;.

==Personal life==
Brunson met his future wife, Louise, in 1959 and married her in August 1962. Louise became pregnant, but a tumor was discovered in Doyle&#x27;s neck later that year. The surgeons found that the cancer had spread when it was operated on. They felt that an operation would prolong his life enough for him to see the baby&#x27;s birth, so they went ahead. After the operation, no trace of the cancer could be found.

Brunson attributed his cure to the prayers of friends of his wife and their correspondence with Kathryn Kuhlman, a self-proclaimed Christian faith healer. Louise developed a tumor shortly afterward, and when she went for surgery, her tumor was also found to have disappeared. In 1975, their daughter Doyla was diagnosed with scoliosis, yet her spine straightened completely within three months. Doyla died at 18 of a heart-valve condition.

His son, Todd, also plays poker professionally. Todd won a bracelet in the $2,500 Omaha Hi-Lo at the 2005 World Series of Poker, making Doyle and Todd the first father–son combination to win World Series bracelets. His daughter Pamela played in the 2007 World Series of Poker, outlasting Todd.

Brunson died in Las Vegas on May 14, 2023, aged 89. A Celebration of Life was held at the 2023 WSOP. Daniel Negreanu and Phil Hellmuth were among the speakers.

==SEC investigation==
On December 14, 2005, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) filed an action to enforce subpoenas issued to the attorneys of Doyle Brunson regarding his unsolicited offer in July 2005 to buy WPT Enterprises, Inc., the publicly traded owner of the World Poker Tour, at a premium over its then-market value. Shortly after that, the Commission contended, a public relations firm Brunson hired, and a website he endorsed, publicly announced the offer. The Commission asserted that the publication of this offer, widely covered in the media, triggered a steep rise in WPT&#x27;s stock price on record trading volume. Brunson and his lawyers immediately stopped responding to the WPT and the media when pressed for details. Instead, after delivering the offer, Brunson withdrew from the engagement. When the WPT publicly disclosed Brunson and his law firm&#x27;s unresponsiveness, its stock price sharply declined, costing investors tens of millions of dollars in lost market value.

The SEC formally investigated whether Brunson&#x27;s offer and its publication violated federal securities laws, including the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Brunson invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and declined to testify in the investigation, directing his lawyers to withhold certain documents and, under the attorney–client privilege and work-product doctrine, not to testify on critical aspects of the offer. In December 2005, the SEC subpoenaed documents and testimony from Brunson&#x27;s lawyers seeking to set aside these privileges on various legal grounds, including the crime-fraud exception, in order to compel Brunson&#x27;s firm to provide the requested documents and testimony.

The case was eventually dropped by the SEC in 2007.

==Doyles Room==
Doyles Room was an online poker room established in 2004. Originally on the Tribeca Poker Network (now part of the Playtech iPoker network), Doyles Room moved to the Microgaming (Prima) Poker Network in 2007, then to the Cake Poker Network in January 2009, and most recently to the Yatahay Network in January 2011.

On May 26, 2011, Doyles Room was seized in accordance with an investigation into the violation of online gambling laws. Following the events of April 15, Brunson cut ties with Doyles Room. In October 2011, Doyles Room was acquired by Americas Cardroom.

<text>The Folger Shakespeare Library is an independent research library on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., United States. It has the world&#x27;s largest collection of the printed works of William Shakespeare, and is a primary repository for rare materials from the early modern period (1500–1750) in Britain and Europe. The library was established by Henry Clay Folger in association with his wife, Emily Jordan Folger. It opened in 1932, two years after his death.

The library offers advanced scholarly programs and national outreach to K–12 classroom teachers on Shakespeare education. Other performances and events at the Folger include the award-winning Folger Theatre, which produces Shakespeare-inspired theater; Folger Consort, the early-music ensemble-in-residence; the O.B. Hardison Poetry Series; the PEN/Faulkner Reading Series; and numerous other exhibits, seminars, talks and lectures, and family programs. It also has several publications, including the Folger Library editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, the journal &quot;Shakespeare Quarterly&quot;, the teacher resource books &quot;Shakespeare Set Free&quot;, and catalogs of exhibitions. The Folger is also a leader in methods of preserving rare materials.

The library is privately endowed and administered by the Trustees of Amherst College. The library building is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

==History==

Standard Oil of New York executive Henry Clay Folger, a graduate of Amherst College and Columbia University, was an avid collector of Shakespeareana, beginning in 1889 with the purchase of a 1685 Fourth Folio. Toward the end of World War I, he and his wife Emily Jordan Folger began searching for a location for a Shakespeare library based on their collection. They chose a location adjacent to the Library of Congress in Washington, D.C. The land was then occupied by townhouses, and Folger spent several years buying the separate lots. The site was designated for expansion by the Library of Congress, but in 1928, Congress passed a resolution allowing its use for Folger&#x27;s project.

The cornerstone of the library was laid in May 1930, but Folger died soon afterward. The bulk of Folger&#x27;s fortune was left in trust, with Amherst College as administrator, for the library. Early members of the board included Amherst graduate and former president Calvin Coolidge, second chairman of the Board of Trustees. Because of the stock market crash of 1929, Folger&#x27;s estate was smaller than he had planned, although still substantial. Emily Folger, who had worked with her husband on his collection, supplied the funds to complete the project. The library opened on April 23, 1932, the anniversary of what is believed to be Shakespeare&#x27;s date of birth. Emily Folger remained involved in its administration until shortly before her death in 1936. In 2005, the Folger Board of Governors undertook administration of the Folger under the auspices of the Amherst Board of Trustees, though the Amherst board continues to manage the Folger&#x27;s budget.

The Folger&#x27;s first official reader was B. Roland Lewis, who later published &quot;The Shakespeare Documents: Facsimiles, Transliterations, Translations, and Commentary&quot; based on his research. The first fellowships were distributed in 1936. Early Folger exhibitions featured enticing items in the collection, including Ralph Waldo Emerson&#x27;s copy of Shakespeare&#x27;s works, an Elizabethan lute, and Edwin Booth&#x27;s &quot;Richard III&quot; costume. Current practices for Folger exhibitions did not begin until 1964, when the first exhibition curated on site opened. During the Second World War, 30,000 items from the Folger collection were transported under guard to Amherst College&#x27;s Converse Library, where they were stored for the duration of the war in case of an enemy attack on Washington, D.C.

Many of the Folger&#x27;s current public events and programs began in the 1970s under the leadership of director O.B. Hardison. Under his direction, the Folger&#x27;s theater was brought up to Washington, D.C. fire code, permitting performances by the Folger Theatre Group, the library&#x27;s first professional company. The Folger Poetry Series also began in 1970. Hardison formed the Folger Institute, which coordinates academic programs and research at the Library. Folger Consort, the Library&#x27;s early music ensemble, began performances in 1977.

The first Director of the Library, from 1940 to 1946, was Joseph Quincy Adams Jr.

==Buildings and grounds==

The main Folger building was designed by architect Paul Philippe Cret. The white marble exterior includes nine street-level bas-reliefs of scenes from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays created by the sculptor John Gregory, an aluminum replica of a statue of Puck by Brenda Putnam, as well as many inscriptions personally selected by Henry Folger. The large Art Deco window and door grilles are aluminum.

Inside, the building is designed in a Tudor style with oak paneling and plaster ceilings. The Elizabethan Theatre lobby contains the original marble Puck statue (restored and moved indoors in 2001), and architectural painting by muralist Austin M. Purves Jr. The two reading rooms (one added in the early 1980s) are reserved for use by scholars who have obtained advance permission. Public spaces include the large exhibition gallery, a gift shop, and an Elizabethan theatre.

===Architecture===

Henry Folger&#x27;s search for an architect began with an acquaintance, Alexander B. Trowbridge, who had redesigned a home in Glen Cove, Long Island, in the old English style the Folgers were eager to feature in their Library. Folger contracted Trowbridge in 1928, but Trowbridge preferred to consult, rather than be the primary architect, and so recommended French émigré Paul Phillippe Cret. Trowbridge and Cret shared a similar vision for the design of the Library—a neoclassical building that stripped the facade of any decorative elements. Though the Folgers had initially desired an entirely Elizabethan building, they ultimately agreed that a neoclassical building would blend with other existing buildings on Capitol Hill. To retain an Elizabethan quality on the exterior of the building, Cret and Trowbridge proposed to decorate the facade with scenes from Shakespeare&#x27;s works. Currently, the relief sculptures includes scenes from &quot;Henry IV&quot;, &quot;Hamlet&quot;, &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot;, &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Richard III&quot;, and &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.

In 1959, the Folger contracted Harbeson, Hough, Livingston, and Larson, a Philadelphia firm that succeeded Cret&#x27;s, to design a new wing by building over a rear parking lot. The additions also yielded a roof garden on top of the new wing. A second Folger building, the Haskell Center, opened in 2000 across Third Street from the original building. The nineteenth-century office building was adapted by architect Andrew K. Stevenson to house the library&#x27;s education and public programs staffs.

The Folger currently maintains a row of townhouses on Third Street to provide housing for scholars, readers, fellows, participants in Folger Institute programs, and other visitors.

====Reading Room====
The Reading Room officially opened in January 1933 and today contains reference works for easy accessibility to readers. From 1977 to 1983, the Folger Shakespeare Library was renovated. Design was provided by Hartman-Cox Architects. During this renovation, it included the addition of new book stacks, renovation of office spaces, and an expansion to the Reading Room. A second, more modern reading room dedicated as the Theodora Sedgwick Bond-William Ross Bond Memorial Reading Room was completed in 1982. Upon Gail Kern Paster&#x27;s retirement as director of the Folger in 2011, the original reading room was renamed the Gail Kern Paster Reading Room.

Henry Folger wanted the Library&#x27;s reading room to feel at once like a private home and the Great Hall of an English college. It features stained-glass windows and a large stone fireplace which has never been used. The large stained-glass window overlooking what is now the Gail Kern Paster Reading Room was designed and created by Nicola D&#x27;Ascenzo, who depicted the familiar &quot;Seven Ages of Man&quot; soliloquy from &quot;As You Like It&quot;.

====Elizabethan Theatre====
Initially, the Elizabethan Theatre was not intended for theatrical performance. The original model was the Fortune Playhouse, and then the Globe Theatre; these models proved difficult to replicate exactly, and the Folgers ultimately decided to incorporate features from multiple theaters to give visitors a general picture of a theater during the Elizabethan era. Before Folger Theatre productions began, the Elizabethan Theatre was used for concert performances and academic lectures. The theater, which seats around 260, has no pit. Painted on the ceiling is a well-known quote from &quot;As You Like It&quot;: &quot;All the world&#x27;s a stage, and all the men and women merely players.&quot;

The first theatrical performance in the Elizabethan Theatre was a 1949 production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; by the Amherst Masquers. The Folger Theatre Group formed in 1970 when the Elizabethan Theatre became compliant with Washington, D.C. fire safety laws. Early productions included &quot;Dionysus Wants You!&quot;, which adapted &quot;The Bacchae&quot; into a rock musical, and &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;.

====Elizabethan Garden====
At the east end of the building is an Elizabethan Garden featuring plants from Shakespeare&#x27;s plays, opened in 1989 amid the four magnolias planted by Emily Jordan Folger in 1932. In 2003, several sculptures by Greg Wyatt based on Shakespeare&#x27;s plays joined the Elizabethan plants in the garden.

====West garden====
Sculptor Brenda Putnam was hired in May 1930 to design a sculpture of Puck for a garden on the west side of the building. Decades of exposure weakened the statue, and after Puck&#x27;s right hand was found across the street at the Library of Congress in 2000, the original piece was moved. It now sits above the entrance to the Elizabethan Theatre, and an aluminum statue replaced the original in the garden.

The west garden&#x27;s lawn shrank during the 1959 additions to the library, when part of its space was paved for a new staff parking area.

====Renovations====
The Folger Library and Theatre have undergone major renovations over the past six years, with the building being closed to daytime visitors since January 2020. The building reopened on June 21, 2024. The renovations added a new learning lab, new exhibits, outdoor gardens featuring a new Juliet balcony, and a reimagined great hall with a cafe (Quill &amp; Crumb).

==Library==

===Collection===
The Folger houses the world&#x27;s largest collection of Shakespeare-related material, from the 16th century to the present. The library is best known for its 82 copies of the 1623 First Folio (of which only 235 known copies survive) and over 200 quartos of Shakespeare&#x27;s individual plays. Not restricted to Shakespeare, the Folger owns the world&#x27;s third largest collection of English books printed before 1641, as well as substantial holdings of continental and later English imprints. The collection includes a wealth of items related to performance history: 250,000 playbills, 2,000 promptbooks, costumes, recordings and props. It also holds upwards of 90,000 paintings, prints, drawings, photographs, sculptures and other works of art.

The Folger&#x27;s first catalog of its collection began in 1935, when Edwin Willoughby, a scholar of library science and the First Folio, began to catalog the book collection based on Alfred W. Pollard and Gilbert Richard Redgrave&#x27;s &quot;Short-Title Catalogue&quot;. Though Willoughby developed a unique classification system based on the Folger&#x27;s needs, in the late 1940s the Folger adopted that of the Library of Congress. In 1996, Folger staff and readers were given access to Hamnet, the collection&#x27;s online catalog; the site became available to the public in 2000. Hamnet was retired in June 2022.

====Printed books====
In all, the library collection includes more than 250,000 books, from the mid 15th century—when the printing press was invented—to the present day. In addition to its 82 First Folios, 229 early modern quartos of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and poems and 119 copies of the Second, Third, and Fourth Folios, the Folger holds some 7,000 later editions of Shakespeare from the 18th century to present, in more than 70 different languages. Beyond its Shakespearean texts, the library&#x27;s collection includes over 18,000 early English books printed before 1640 and another 29,000 printed between 1641 and 1700. The library holds 35,000 early modern books printed on the European continent, about 450 of which are incunabula. The topics of these texts vary widely, ranging across literature, politics, religion, technology, military history and tactics, medicine, and over 2,000 volumes on the Protestant Reformation.

====Manuscripts====
The Folger holds some 60,000 manuscripts (from Elizabeth I and John Donne to Mark Twain and Walt Whitman). These handwritten documents date from the 15th to the 21st century and cover a variety of subjects: documents related to performance history and literature, personal correspondences, wills, love letters, and other materials of daily life. Notable manuscripts include the earliest known staging diagram in England, a list of quotations George Eliot compiled while writing &quot;Middlemarch&quot;, the 18th-century Shakespeare forgeries of William Henry Ireland, and the papers of legendary 18th-century actor David Garrick.

The Folger hosts Early Modern Manuscripts Online (EMMO), an IMLS-grant funded project to digitize and transcribe English manuscripts from the 16th and 17th centuries in a freely available digital collection. EMMO holds conferences, paleography classes, &quot;transcrib-athons&quot;, and other events at the Folger and elsewhere.

====Highlights of the collection====

Significant items in the Folger&#x27;s collection include:
* The only extant complete copy of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Titus Andronicus&quot; first quarto, published in 1594
* The False Folio
* The Macro Manuscript, a unique source for the three early morality plays: &quot;The Castle of Perseverance&quot;, &quot;Mankind&quot; and &quot;Wisdom&quot;. The manuscript also contains the earliest known staging diagram for any play in England.

* A large and significant collection of letters, mostly sent to the influential German Shakespeare scholar F. A. Leo (1820-1898), many of which related to the early history of the German Shakespeare Society, as well as a selection of German-language documents relating to Shakespeare. This collection was organized and edited by Werner Habicht.

==Research and education==
Programs for advanced scholars, faculty, graduate students, and undergraduates are provided by the Folger Institute. Programs for K–12 teachers and students are provided by the Education department.

===Folger Institute===
The Folger Institute has served as the focus of scholarly research at the Folger since 1970. The Folger offers long- and short-term fellowships for advanced researchers across all disciplines, and hosts the two-week Amherst-Folger Undergraduate Fellowship program every January. The Institute holds a variety of colloquia, courses, workshops, and conferences for faculty, graduate students, and secondary educators. Scholarly programs run by the Folger Institute include the Folger Institute Consortium, a group that shares research and other resources among over 40 universities, the Center for Shakespeare Studies, which seeks depth and diversity in Shakespeare scholarship, and the Center for the History of British Political Thought, which promotes continued scholarship of three hundred years of British politics.

===Education===
Educational outreach at the Folger began in the early 1970s; today, the Folger Education department continues those early efforts with a variety of programs for K–12 students and teachers that emphasize an active learning approach to Shakespeare. Teachers gather at the Folger for day-long and month-long programs to work to incorporate Shakespeare and performance in the classroom. The department also publishes a variety of materials for classroom use. Student programs include workshops, local residency initiatives, and a high school fellowship program during which students study Shakespeare at the Folger. The Emily Jordan Folger Children&#x27;s Shakespeare Festival, founded in 1980, allows elementary students to perform every spring. The Secondary School Shakespeare Festival, founded the following year, brings students from grades 7–12 to perform half-hour collections of Shakespeare scenes in the Folger theater.

The Teaching Shakespeare Institute (TSI) is an intensive four-week summer study program for middle- and high-school teachers hosted annually by the Folger Shakespeare Library&#x27;s Education Department, with funding from the National Endowment for the Humanities. TSI participants work with experts to study a small number of Shakespearean plays in terms of scholarship, performance, and the classroom. 50 teachers participated in the inaugural program in 1984, but the annual number is now capped at 25. By 2015, over 775 teachers had gone through the program.

==Performances and events==
The Folger Shakespeare Library&#x27;s cultural and arts programs include Folger Theatre, Folger Consort, the O.B. Hardison Poetry Series and the PEN/Faulkner Foundation, as well as additional talks, screenings, lectures and exhibitions.

===Folger Theatre===

Folger Theatre performs a season of Shakespeare-inspired theater, featuring the works of Shakespeare as well as contemporary plays inspired by his works. Since its inception in 1992, Folger Theatre has staged over half of the plays in Shakespeare&#x27;s First Folio. Productions have received 135 nominations for a Helen Hayes Award and won 23, including Outstanding Resident Play for its renditions of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; (2007), &quot;Hamlet&quot; (2011) and &quot;The Taming of the Shrew&quot; (2013). From 1982-2021, the Folger Theatre&#x27;s Artistic Producer was Janet Alexander Griffin. In 2021, Karen Ann Daniels was named Director of Programming and Artistic Director. Performances occur in the theater at the east end of the building.

===Folger Consort===
Folger Consort is the library&#x27;s resident early music ensemble, founded in 1977 by its artistic directors Robert Eisenstein and Christopher Kendall. The Consort performs medieval music, Renaissance music, and baroque music in its concert series. The Consort performs regularly at the Elizabethan Theatre, at the Washington National Cathedral and at the Music Center at Strathmore. The Consort also holds seminars, discussions, and radio broadcasts. Since 2006, Folger Consort has won Best Classical Chamber Ensemble five times at the Washington Area Music Awards.

===O.B. Hardison Poetry Series===
Since 1970, the Folger has hosted contemporary poets for readings, moderated conversation, and Q&amp;As in what is now called the O.B. Hardison Poetry series, after former director of the Folger, O.B. Hardison Jr. Past poets involved in the series include Octavio Paz, Gwendolyn Brooks, Allen Ginsberg, W. S. Merwin, Adrienne Rich, Yusef Komunyakaa, James Merrill, Frank Bidart, Robert Pinsky, Derek Walcott, Hayden Carruth, Rita Dove, Seamus Heaney, Sterling Brown, Denise Levertov, June Jordan, Lawrence Ferlinghetti, Sonia Sanchez, and James Dickey. Between 1991 and 2009, the series also awarded the O. B. Hardison Jr. Poetry Prize, which was awarded by the library to a U.S. poet who has published at least one book within the last five years, has made important contributions as a teacher, and is committed to furthering the understanding of poetry.

===PEN/Faulkner===
In conjunction with the PEN/Faulkner Foundation, the Folger hosts the PEN/Faulkner Reading Series, which brings contemporary authors to the Folger for public readings of fiction. The Folger also hosts the annual PEN/Faulkner Award for Fiction readings, which celebrate the year&#x27;s finalists and winners.

==Digital resources==
The Folger offers several online tools to assist in research and scholarship, including the following:
* The Digital Image Collection (also known as &quot;LUNA&quot;), which provides over 80,000 images of the collection, including manuscripts, books and art. The images in the collection are available under a Creative Commons license.
* Folgerpedia, the Folger&#x27;s in-house wiki; a collaboratively-edited encyclopedia providing information about the institution, the collection, and other relevant information
* &quot;All Shakespeare&#x27;s works&quot;, online editions of Shakespeare&#x27;s plays and poems
* Early Modern Manuscripts Online, images of manuscripts and promotes transcribing paleography

==Leadership==

<text>At the Feldberg () in the Black Forest is the highest mountain in Baden-Württemberg, and the highest in Germany outside of the Alps and Bavaria. The local municipality of Feldberg was named after the mountain.

== Environment ==
The Feldberg is situated southeast of Freiburg im Breisgau and is surrounded by the municipalities of Hinterzarten (northeast), Titisee (east), Menzenschwand (south), Bernau (also south) and Todtnau (southwest). About two kilometres southeast of the summit lies the village of Feldberg ().

Between the main peak (, also known as the &quot;Höchste&quot; or &quot;Highest&quot;, and its subpeak, the Seebuck (), just under away, is a saddle, the &quot;Grüble&quot;, from which a wide spur, the Baldenweger Buck () branches off. The saddle initially descends gently and then ever more steeply into the valleys on either side. From the Seebuck the Feldberg drops steeply away to the northeast into the Feldsee, a lake of glacial origin at about altitude. Deeply incised valleys run northwest towards Freiburg (the Zastler and St Wilhelmer valleys) and southwest towards Basel (Wiesental valley).

The main car park below the Seebuck can be reached from the B317 (federal highway) running from Titisee to Lörrach (near Basel) over the Feldberg Pass. A train service of the Three Lakes Railway serves the station of Feldberg-Bärental, at , the highest DB station on standard gauge track. A bus service connects with the station. The Seebuck, which is topped by an old transmission tower, the Feldberg Tower, once a radio tower, since 2013 a ham museum can be reached from the valley station in Feldberg-Ort on a short chairlift. From this point the summit of the Feldberg is about away. It is only accessible to the public on foot or by bicycle.

The numerous point-to-point radio systems of the Bundeswehr and the American and French armies dating from the Cold War period have been since taken down. Today Feldberg is marked by the old and new television towers and the Bismarck monument on the Seebuck.

Altogether there are more than 28 ski lifts and slopes around the Feldberg. The actual summit itself is situated outside the skiing areas. Several cross-country skiing trails around the peak and around Herzogenhorn opposite are popular with cross-country skiers. The whole area, with ski-runs of Alpine character, is popular for ski touring.

=== Nature reserves ===
Most of the Feldberg area has the status of a nature reserve due to its subalpine vegetation. The Feldberg Nature Reserve is the oldest and largest in Baden-Württemberg and has been under the charge of a full-time ranger since 1989. Since 2001 it has been the responsibility of the Southern Black Forest Nature Conservation Centre, based in the &quot;Haus der Natur&quot; (&quot;Nature House&quot;), to look after the reserve. They have a permanent, interactive exhibition and a comprehensive programme with events in the reserve. In 2005, a new nature trail was established immediately behind the house.

=== Views ===
The Feldberg offers one of the most extensive panoramic views in Germany – especially in winter when there is a temperature inversion. In the west, on the far side of the Upper Rhine Graben, can be seen the entire Vosges range, from the Ballon d&#x27;Alsace to Mont Donon and Mont Sainte-Odile. Beyond that the southern Palatinate Forest can sometimes be seen. To the north is the Hornisgrinde; to the northeast the entire chain of the Swabian Jura, including the Lemberg, and, to its right, the Hegau volcanoes.

To the south, the Alps can be seen from the Alpspitze and Zugspitze in the east to the Allgäu Alps, Verwall Alps, Silvretta, Säntis, Glarus Alps, Urner Alps, Bernese Alps and Mont Blanc in the west. In front of the Western Alps and, particularly right of Mont Blanc, can be seen the Swiss Jura, with their highest point, the Chasseral. Thus the view sweeps from the Italian Mont Blanc to southwest Germany and from Austria to France.

==Geology==

The mountain&#x27;s bedrock of gneiss is around one billion years old. The Feldberg region was uplifted three times and then eroded again. What exists today can be called the &quot;third Feldberg&quot;. The &quot;first Feldberg&quot; was formed in the Precambrian as part of an orogen and was then completely eroded away. The &quot;second Feldberg&quot; arose during the Devonian and Carboniferous, as part of the Variscan orogeny. It, too, was eroded away, and, during the Mesozoic and Early Triassic, beds of Bunter sandstone, Muschelkalk, Keuper, Lias, Dogger and were deposited in the resulting sedimentation space. Some of these sediments are maritime deposits from intercontinental oceans; the others are of continental origin. The &quot;third&quot; and current Feldberg was formed during the Alpine orogeny in the Tertiary. Since then these sediments have been steadily removed through water processes and aeolian erosion, and today little but the bedrock remains.

== Glacial morphology ==
During the height of the Würm glaciation a glacier, 1,000 km2 in area, covered the Black Forest. As a result, a lot of glacial influence can be seen in the region. There are several features that relate to the glacial morphology of the Feldberg. Firstly, there is the Feldsee. This tarn formed in the hollow that was scoured out by the ice pushing down the headwall of the cirque. Gradually the ice created a bowl that now holds the 33-metre-deep Feldsee. A moraine on the shores of the Feldsee testifies to this process.

The &quot;Feldseemoor&quot;, a few metres away, is also a remnant of the ice age. Here the terminal moraine of the &quot;mini glacier&quot; can be seen from the Feldsee. It has impounded water and formed a bog. The glacial history of the Würm stage, 10,000–11,000 years ago, at the Feldberg evolved as follows:
The emergence of the Feldsee happened as the &quot;Feldberg glacier&quot; spread out. The adjacent &quot;Feldseemoor&quot; was the next stage. The glaciers then formed a moraine at Waldhof. This was exceeded once more at the Falkau, which marks its maximum extent. After that, the glacier retreated again.

==Climate and vegetation==

===Climate===
Feldberg features a subalpine climate (Köppen: &quot;Dfc&quot;), for that its summers are mild enough to have less than four months with an average mean temperature above 10º Celsius. The annual mean temperature is around (30-year mean from 1981–2010), up 0.6 °C compared with the period from 1961–1990; their temperature gradients are lower than those in adjacent valleys. During winter, there are long periods of sunshine, due to the low condensation point. This also means that the Feldberg has relatively mild winters; the surrounding valleys having noticeably colder temperatures. The lowest temperature ever recorded was on 10 February 1956. The average rain/snowfall amount is per year which is very high compared with Germany as a whole. On 97% of the survey marks of the German Weather Service lower figures are reported. Over the years snowfall has been reported in every calendar month. On average the Feldberg is covered in snow for 157 days per year. Because of its exposed location, wind speeds of hurricane force – up to – are possible throughout the year.
===Vegetation===
As its name suggests, the Feldberg&#x27;s summit is not wooded. However, the sharp transition to forest illustrates it is no natural border. Even the top of the mountain does not reach the tree line which, in this region, would lie at around 1,650–1,700 metres.

Many of the open areas are habitats for specialised species of flora; these include bogs, moors, rock faces and snow fields. Below the summit the mountain is covered by mixed forest consisting of naturally growing European beech, European rowan, European spruce, European silver fir and cultivated North American species Douglas fir. Human activity has resulted in forest clearings, such as the large open areas around every hamlet.

That is attributable to the intensive cattle farming in this region, which limits forest growth. Today one comes across both pioneer species like European Rowans and different sorts of shrubs there. On many places there are primeval forests being left to its own resources. A characteristic of the vegetation represent the moors.

==Tourism==

===Summer===

Today tourism is the main source of income in the Feldberg region.

The mountain has several managed huts and inns – the &quot;Baldenweger Hut&quot;, &quot;Rinken Hut&quot;, &quot;Zastler Hut&quot;, &quot;St. Wilhelmer Hut&quot; and &quot;Todtnauer Hut&quot; – for the benefit of walkers that are linked by footpaths. These include the &quot;Felsenweg&quot; (&quot;Rock Way&quot;) and the &quot;Alpiner Pfad&quot; (&quot;Alpine Path&quot;) which run through some of the last landscapes in the Black Forest that still have an Alpine character. The 12-kilometre-long &quot;Feldberg Steig&quot; (&quot;Feldberg Path&quot;) runs around the summit and the Feldsee. In addition there are metalled roads to the inns and other facilities around the peak.

===Winter===

Feldberg is the biggest winter skiing resort in Germany outside of the Alps. The first ski lift was originally built in 1907 in the Feldberg area. Today, there are around 14 ski lifts (including five at the Seebuck, among them a six-seater chairlift) and over of downhill runs up to a &quot;black&quot; level of difficulty. When there is sufficient snow, even a terrain park may be created. At the valley station are several garages for piste bashers and other equipment. There is a mountain rescue post below the old TV tower.

There are also many Nordic ski trails around the peak; two of which are the highest ones of Baden-Württemberg. Part of the cross-country skiing trail from Schonach to Belchen runs between Feldberg and Seebuck.

== Alpine dangers ==
The Feldberg, like many low mountain ranges, is often underestimated in terms of its alpine dangers. Its easy accessibility by public transport, car and cable car suggests that it is not dangerous and, consequently, visitors may be inappropriately equipped or dressed.
The main dangers in the Feldberg region are sudden falls in temperature, storms or slipping on smooth, icy ground. Near tall structures such as the transmission masts there is the danger falling ice. 
In fog or mist, orientation is clearly much more difficult. Often visibility is reduced to just a few metres. Marked paths outside the wooded areas are lined with poles to assist navigation.

Every winter there are several large avalanches in the Feldberg region. The mountainsides of the Zastler valley are particularly prone, but they also occur on leeward slopes like the &quot;Feldseekessel&quot; at Seebuck, the Herzogenhorn and the Baldenweger Buck. Snowfall driven by western winds forms cornices on the downwind sides of ridges (e. g. the &quot;Zastler Wechte&quot;), which can break off. Several fatal avalanche burials have happened, the last in January 2015 which left two dead.
There are no special avalanche reports issued for the Black Forest.
==Television towers==
During the Cold War there were many antennas on a military tower at the summit, but these were removed some years ago. Today, there is a large TV / radio transmission mast, used by the regional broadcasting station, SWR (Southwest Broadcasting). In addition, the mountain is recognisable from its Bismarck Monument, in honour of the famous 19th-century chancellor of Germany, Otto von Bismarck.

==Meteorological station ==
At the top of the mountain (where weather has been surveyed since 1915) is a weather station that has been in operation since 1937, run by the German Meteorological Service (WMO code number: 10908). Next to the observatory is a weather radar.

<text>The wrynecks (genus Jynx) are a small but distinctive group of small Old World woodpeckers. &quot;Jynx&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;iunx&quot;, the Eurasian wryneck.

These birds get their English name from their ability to turn their heads almost 180°. When disturbed at the nest, they use this snake-like head twisting and hissing as a threat display. It has occasionally been called &quot;snake-bird&quot; for that reason.

Like the true woodpeckers, wrynecks have large heads, long tongues, which they use to extract their insect prey, and zygodactyl feet, with two toes pointing forward and two backwards, but they lack the stiff tail feathers that the true woodpeckers use when climbing trees, so they are more likely than their relatives to perch on a branch rather than an upright trunk. The sexes have a similar appearance.

Their bills are shorter and less dagger-like than in the true woodpeckers, but their chief prey is ants and other insects, which they find in decaying wood or almost bare soil. They reuse woodpecker holes for nesting, rather than making their own holes. The eggs are white, as with many hole nesters.

The two species have cryptic plumage, with intricate patterning of greys and browns. The adult moults rapidly between July and September, although some moult continues in its winter quarters.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The woodpeckers are an ancient bird family consisting of three subfamilies, the wrynecks, the piculets and the true woodpeckers, Picinae. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis show that the wrynecks are a sister clade to other woodpeckers including the Picinae and probably diverged early from the rest of the family.

The wryneck subfamily Jynginae has one genus, &quot;Jynx&quot;, introduced in 1758 by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Linnaeus placed a single species in the genus, the Eurasian wryneck (&quot;Jynx torquilla&quot;), which is therefore the type species. The genus name &quot;Jynx&quot; is from the Ancient Greek name for the Eurasian wryneck, &quot;ιυγξ&quot;, &quot;iunx&quot;, and &quot;ruficollis&quot; is from the Latin , &quot;rufous&quot; and &quot;neck&quot;. The English &quot;wryneck&quot; refers to the habit of birds in this genus of twisting and writhing their necks when agitated. It was first recorded in 1585.
The red-throated wryneck was first identified by German ornithologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1830. It is also known as the rufous-necked wryneck or red-breasted wryneck. 

The two wrynecks form a superspecies that probably separated early in their evolution from the piculets, although there has subsequently been only limited divergence between the &quot;Jynx&quot; species.

===Fossil record===
The woodpecker family appears to have diverged from other Piciformes about fifty million years ago, and a 2017 study considered that the split between &quot;Jynx&quot; and other woodpeckers occurred about 22.5million years ago. A fossil dating from the early Miocene, more than twenty million years ago, consisting of the distal end of a tarsometatarsus had some ‘’Jynx’’-like features, but was classed as an early piculet. By the Pliocene (five million years ago) woodpeckers were similar to those now extant. Fossil wrynecks are known from Europe in the Pleistocene, between 2.6million and 11,700 years ago.

===Species===
The two species in &quot;Jynx&quot; are restricted to the Palearctic biogeographic realm and Africa. The Eurasian wryneck breeds across temperate Europe and Asia, and one of only two Old World woodpeckers to undertake long-distance migration mainly wintering in sub-Saharan Africa and tropical Asia. The rufous-necked wryneck has a disjunct distribution confined to sub-Saharan Africa. It is resident, although there may be local movements and post-breeding dispersal. Both wrynecks have several geographical subspecies.

<text>Nicole Brossard (born November 27, 1943) is a French-Canadian formalist poet and novelist. Her work is known for exploration of feminist themes and for challenging masculine-oriented language and points of view in French literature.

She lives in Outremont, a suburb of Montreal, Canada.

==Early life==
Brossard was born in Montreal, Quebec. She attended Collège Marguerite Bourgeoys and the Université de Montréal.

==Career==
Brossard wrote her first collection in 1965, &quot;Aube à la saison&quot;. The collection &quot;L&#x27;Echo bouge beau&quot; marked a break in the evolution of her poetry that included an open and active participation in many literary and cultural events, including poetry recitals.

In 1975, she participated in a meeting of writers on women, after which she began to take an activist role in the feminist movement, and to write poetry with a more personal and subjective tone. Her writing includes sensual, aesthetic and feminist political content.

Brossard co-founded a feminist newspaper, &quot;Les têtes de pioches&quot;, with France Théoret. She wrote a play &quot;Le nef des sorcières&quot; (first performed in 1976).

In 1982, she founded a publishing house: L&#x27;Intégrale éditrice. Brossard&#x27;s poetry collection, &quot;Double Impression&quot;, won the 1984 Governor General&#x27;s Award. In 1987 her romance novel, &quot;Le désert mauve&quot;, was published.

The Nicole Brossard archives are located in downtown Montreal at the Bibliothèque et Archives nationales du Québec. and at Library and Archives Canada.

In April 2019, Brossard was announced as the 2019 Griffin Lifetime Recognition Award recipient.

<doc id="255531" wikidata="Q510143" url="?curid=255531" title="Ynglinga saga">
<text>Ynglinga saga ( ) is a Kings&#x27; saga, originally written in Old Norse by the Icelandic poet and historian Snorri Sturluson about 1225. It is the first section of his &quot;Heimskringla&quot;. It was first translated into English and published in 1844 by Samuel Laing.

Snorri Sturluson based his work on an earlier &quot;Ynglingatal&quot; which is attributed to the Norwegian 9th-century skald Þjóðólfr of Hvinir, and which also appears in &quot;Historia Norwegiae&quot;. It tells the most ancient part of the story of the House of Ynglings (&quot;Scylfings&quot; in &quot;Beowulf&quot;). Snorri described the descent of the kings of Norway from this royal house of Sweden.

&quot;Ynglinga saga&quot; is the first part of Snorri&#x27;s history of the ancient Norse kings, the &quot;Heimskringla.&quot; Interwoven in this narrative are references to important historical events.

The saga deals with the arrival of the Norse gods to Scandinavia and how Freyr founded the Swedish Yngling dynasty at Uppsala. Then the saga follows the line of Swedish kings until Ingjald (&quot;Ingjald illråde&quot;), after which the descendants settled in Norway and became the ancestors of the Norwegian King Harald Fairhair.

==Synopsis==
===Swithiod the Great===
The saga begins with a description of the &quot;earth&#x27;s circle&quot; inhabited by the human race and divided by great seas running into the land from the &quot;out-ocean&quot;. The Black Sea divides the earth into three parts: Asia in the east, Europe in the west and &quot;Swithiod the Great, or the Cold&quot; in the north. The saga distinguishes between Swithiod the Great (literally &quot;Sweden the Great&quot;), where the opening scenes are set, and Sweden proper, in Scandinavia, where the reign of the Ynglings begins. These lands differ in a metaphorical sense as well, since the former is also called Godheim or the home of gods, while the latter is called Mannheim or the place where people live.

Swithiod the Great is a vast territory populated by many &quot;races of men&quot;, and divided from other lands by a large mountain ridge going from northeast to southwest. This mountain ridge (probably referring to the Ural Mountains) lies &quot;outside of all inhabited lands&quot; but its southern part is not far from &quot;Turkland&quot; (probably Khazaria). On the southern side of the mountains runs the river Tanais, formerly known as Tanaquisl or Vanaquisl (the modern day Don), which flows into the Black Sea and marks the border between Europe and Asia.

===Vanaland and Asaland===
People on the Tanais live in a country called Vanaland or Vanaheim. East of the river, in Asia, stretches a country called Asaland or Asaheim. The main city of Asaland is Asgaard, where Odin is a chief. Twelve temple priests, called Diar, direct sacrifices in Asgaard and also judge the people, who serve and obey them. Odin is a great warrior, who conquers many kingdoms in all parts of the world, never losing a battle. His men are used to receive his blessing before going into battle, and to call upon his name when fighting, in order to inspire themselves.

Odin wages war against Vanaland people, but cannot win over them. After doing great damage to each other, both sides agree to a truce and exchange hostages. Thus the best people of Vanaland are sent to Asaland as hostages: Njord the Rich, with his son Frey and daughter Freya as well as the wisest man in Vanaland called Kvase. The people of Asaland, in their turn, send a wise man called Mime along with a stout handsome man called Hone, who is allegedly very suitable to become a chief, to Vanaland. Hone is immediately made a chief in Vanaland, but people there realize how bad he actually is at taking decisions when not advised by Mime. They decapitate Mime and send his head to Asaland, where Odin smears it with herbs and sings incantations over it giving it the power to speak and reveal many secrets to Odin.

===Arrival of Odin in Scandinavia===

Odin has a foresight about the new dwelling place in the north and goes there &quot;with all the gods and a great many other people&quot;, leaving his two brothers, Vilje and Ve, to rule in Asgaard. First, Odin and his companions wander westwards to Gardarike and from there - south to Saxland, where Odin&#x27;s sons start to rule. Odin goes towards the sea in the north, settles in an island called Odinsö in Fyen and sends Gefion to discover new lands to the north, in Scandinavia. When she reaches the possessions of king Gylve, he grants her a plowable field. After having four sons with a giant in Jotunheim, Gefion turns them into a yoke of oxen and makes them plow the field breaking out a piece of land into the ocean close to Odinsö. This land is called Sealand, where Gefion dwells and marries Skjold, an Odin&#x27;s son.

When Odin hears of how prosperous the lands to the east of Gylve&#x27;s possessions are, he goes there. Despite the opposition of Gylve, Asaland people take the upper hand, make piece with him and remain on those lands. Odin settles at the Maelare lake, in the Old Sigtun, builds a temple there and sets his men to rule in the neighboring places around.

===Odin&#x27;s personality===
Odin is described as a great sorcerer in the saga. He can shape-shift, speaks only in verse, and lies so well that everything he says seems true. He strikes enemies blind and deaf and when his own men fight they go berserk and cannot be harmed.

Odin has a ship named Skidbladnir, which can be folded together like a cloth. He relies on two talking ravens to gather intelligence, and he keeps Mime&#x27;s head with him, which tells him the news from other worlds. Odin teaches magic, runes and incantations. He can even awaken the dead from the earth and cause death or disease to anyone. People worship Odin and the other twelve chiefs from Asaland as their gods.

===Death of Odin===
Odin establishes the laws that have been previously observed in Asaland: dead men should be burned with their belongings, a mound should be raised to memorialize distinguished men, sacrifices should be held on special days in winter and in summer. Short before his death, Odin says he is going to Godheim (the other name of &quot;Swithiod the Great&quot; in the saga). He dies in his bed in Swithiod and is burned with honor. Snorri says: &quot;The Swedes believed that he was gone to the ancient Asgaard, and would live there eternally&quot;.

===Frey===
Njord starts to rule over the Swedes after Odin. During this time, marked by peace and prosperity, all the gods die. When Njord also dies, Frey takes the power and makes Upsal his capital. Frey has also another name, Yngvi, which begins to be used as an honorific title by his descendants. Thus they are called Ynglinger. When Frey dies of illness, his men keep it secret and place his body into a great mound with three windows. People think Frey is still alive and continue to pay tribute to him, putting gold through one window, silver through another and copper coins through the third one. The Swedes eventually discover the truth but do not burn Frey&#x27;s body, since they believe that peaceful times continue thanks to his presence in Sweden. They treat him as a god and sacrifice to him.

===Yngling dynasty===

====Fjolne====

Frey&#x27;s son Fjolne inherits the power and peacefully rules over the Swedes until he visits a great celebration in the house of Fredfrode, a ruler of Leidre. There Fjolne accidentally falls into a big vessel with mead and drowns himself.

====Swegde====
Swegde, Fjolne&#x27;s son, takes the kingdom, but decides to seek Godheim and Odin, so he sets out on a 5-year travel for that. Swegde comes to Turkland and then to the Great Swithiod. He does not find Odin, but gets a wife in Vanaland called Vana, who gives birth to their son Vanlande. When Swegde returns to Sweden with his family he is still determined to seek Godheim. During his second journey Swegde meets a dwarf, who tricks him into entering a big hollow stone, where Swegde is trapped forever.

====Vanlande====
Vanlande becomes a king in Upsal. As a great warrior, he ventures out to many lands and gets a wife in Finland called Driva. They have a son Visbur, but then Vanlande leaves his family for a long time. Driva sends Visbur to Sweden and asks the witch Huld to either force Vanlande to return to Finland or kill him with her witchcraft. Vanlande does not return, and thus is killed in his sleep by the Mara.

====Visbur====
Visbur succeeds his father and marries the daughter of Aude the Rich, who gives birth to their two sons Gisle and Ond. However, Visbur leaves his family and takes another wife, with whom he has a son Domald. Gisle and Ond grow up and demand their mother&#x27;s dower of Visbur, but he refuses to pay. They revenge by burning Visbur in his own house, assisted by the Huld&#x27;s sorcery.

====Domald====
After his fathers&#x27;s death, Domald becomes a king. His rule is marked by great famine and distress, and Swedes make many offerings of sacrifice in a hope to end the times of scarcity. When they see that nothing helps they sacrifice Domald himself to the gods.

====Domar and his son Dygve====
Then the Domald&#x27;s son, called Domar, reigns peacefully over the Swedes for a long time. When he dies in Upsal his body is moved to Fyrisvold and burned on the river bank. The power is taken by his son Dygve of whom &quot;nothing is said&quot;, according to the saga, except for that he dies then &quot;in his bed&quot;.

====Dag====
King Dygve is succeeded by his son Dag, who is so wise that he can understand the language of birds. To get news he uses a sparrow, which is killed with a stone one day, in a farm called Varva, in Reidgotaland. Infuriated Dag plunders Varva out of revenge and kills many people there. On his way back Dag crosses a river at a place called Skjotan&#x27;s Ford, where a slave worker throws a hayfork at the Dag&#x27;s troop, killing the king instantly.

====Agne====
The kingdom is taken by the Dag&#x27;s son Agne, a powerful warrior, who leads his army to Finland to subdue the land. After killing a Finnish chief Froste together with many of his men in a great battle, Agne marauds Finland and brings Froste&#x27;s daughter Skjalv with her brother Loge to Stoksund.

There he marries Skjalv, who begs him to make a funeral feast to commemorate her father. Agne gets very drunk during the feast and falls asleep in a tent under a high tree, while wearing a golden ornament around his neck - the legacy of king Visbur. Froste&#x27;s daughter fastens a noose under the ornament and lets her men hang Agne on a branch of that tree. Skjalv sails away after murdering her husband and Agne is buried at that place, which is called Agnefet afterwards.

====Brothers Alric and Eric====
Agne is succeeded by his sons Alric and Eric, who both become kings at the same time. Outstanding horsemen, they like to compete over who rides better. While riding out far away onto distant fields, the brothers seemingly crush each other&#x27;s heads with a headgear and die.

====Brothers Yngve and Alf====
Alric&#x27;s sons Yngve and Alf become kings of Sweden afterwards. Yngve, a renowned warrior, is handsome, cheerful and admired by everyone. In contrast to his brother, Alf is shy, unfriendly and never takes part in military expeditions. Alf&#x27;s wife Bera is attracted to Yngve and spends much time in his company, which makes Alf very jealous. Alf strikes his brother with a sword, before Bera&#x27;s eyes, but the dying Yngve manages to lethally wound Alf too. Both brothers fall dead and are buried in Fyrisvold.

====Hugleik====

Alf&#x27;s son Hugleik inherits the power and quietly rules in the kingdom of the Swedes, until a powerful sea-king Hake comes with many warriors to attack the country. King Hugleik gathers a great army to oppose him, but loses a battle at Fyrisvold. Hake kills Hugleik together with two of his sons in the battle and becomes king of Sweden. Hake remains in Sweden while his troops are going abroad on viking expeditions. Meanwhile the sons of Yngve, Jorund and Eric, are cruising in their warships, marauding Denmark. They capture Gudlog, a king from Halogaland, bring him to Stromones and hang him there, which makes them very famous and celebrated. After hearing that king Hake&#x27;s troops are abroad, Jorund and Eric gather a strong force to advance towards Upsal against Hake, who meets them at Fyrisvold and a great battle takes place there. In spite of having a smaller army, Hake fights bravely and kills Eric, forcing Jorund with his men flee to their ships. However, king Hake himself is mortally wounded in the battle and knows that his days are numbered. He orders a warship to be loaded with bodies of his warriors together with their weapons, and to be taken out to the sea. A pyre is made on the ship, where Hake is burned while not being quite dead.

====Jorund====
Jorund remains in Upsal and rules over the country. He leads his army to Denmark, plundering Jutland and Lymfjord, but in Oddesund he stumbles on Gylog, a son of the late king Gudlog, with a great force. Gylog, assisted by multitudes of local people, wins over Jorund in a battle, captures him and orders him to be hanged on a gallows. Thus Gylog revenges his father&#x27;s death on Jorund.

====On====
Jorund&#x27;s son On, a wise and quiet man, becomes a king of the Swedes and rules peacefully in Upsal until Halfdan, a son of the Danish king Frode Mikellati, comes to Sweden with his army. On flees to Gotland, yielding the kingdom to Halfdan, who remains there as a new king for 25 years.

When Halfdan dies, On returns to Upsal while being already 60 years old and sacrifices his own son to Odin, who tells him that he will live 60 years more. King On rules in Upsal for 25 years until Ole the Bold, a Halfdan&#x27;s nephew, attacks the kingdom. On flees to Gotland for the second time, losing the throne to Ole, who reigns over Sweden for 25 years. When Ole is killed by Starkad the Old, On comes back to Upsal and rules over the kingdom for another 25 years. Then he sacrifices his second son to Odin, who promises that On&#x27;s life will last as long as he gives one of his sons to Odin every tenth year. On keeps living and sacrificing his sons until only one of them remains, whom he also wants to give to Odin, but Swedes do not let it happen. Therefore On finally dies at an extremely old age.

====Egil====
Tunne, an On&#x27;s slave working as his counselor and treasurer, hides much of the On&#x27;s treasures in the earth. As soon as Egil, the only remaining son of On, inherits the throne he reduces Tunne to the rank of an ordinary slave. The deeply offended Tunne runs away with some other slaves, digs up the On&#x27;s treasures, shares it among his men and becomes their chief. Joined by gangs of local robbers they plunder the country and kill many people, compelling Egil to lead his army against the mutinous slave. However, Tunne suddenly attacks Egil&#x27;s field camp at night, forcing the king&#x27;s men to flee to the forest and causing even more damage to the country. Egil assembles an army again, but suffers a heavy defeat from the forces of Tunne. After losing a series of battles to Tunne, the king flees the country and comes to Sealand in Denmark, promising to pay to Frode the Bold in return for his help. Frode gives his army with some of the best warriors to Egil. King Egil, assisted by Danes, defeats Tunne and rules three years over Sweden, sending King Frode great presents every year in acknowledgement of his help, but does not pay scatt to the Danes. Egil dies of a mortal wound inflicted by a runaway bull and is buried in a mound at Upsal.

====Ottar====
Egil&#x27;s son Ottar succeeds to the kingdom after his father but does not continue to keep up a friendship with King Frode. Frode&#x27;s messengers come to demand the scatt promised by Egil, which Ottar refuses to pay. As a punishment, the Sweden is ravaged by the Danes who kill many people and take captives there. In revenge, King Ottar sails to Denmark with his warriors when Frode is away on an expedition, and desolates the country. When Ottar is plundering the Vend district of Lymfjord, Danish earls Vatt and Faste bring their army there to fight off the Swedes. As a result of a great battle, Ottar is defeated and killed, and the Danes leave his body on a mound for wild beasts and ravens to tear at it.

The remaining chapters of the saga describe the rule of Yngling dynasty down to the Rongvald the Mountain-High.

<doc id="255532" wikidata="Q15835307" url="?curid=255532" title="Miranda NG">
<text>Miranda NG is an open-source multiprotocol instant messaging application, designed for Microsoft Windows. Miranda NG is free software distributed under the GNU GPL-2.0-or-later.

==History==
In May 2012 Miranda IM was forked to Miranda NG (New Generation). The reasons were a shift in the development team and the slow-paced development of the original Miranda IM. The main differences between the original client and the fork are: a switch to Visual Studio 2010&#x27;s compiler, dropping support for Windows 95/98/ME and non-Unicode plugins, and the fact that the core and plugins development was combined and that they share a unified repository.

 the latest version of Miranda NG is 0.96.3, released on 9 June 2023.

==Architecture==
Miranda IM provides a basic client framework, GUI, and an advanced plugin architecture. Support for various IM protocols and additional features is implemented through optional plugins, some of which come bundled with Miranda IM by default; the rest (over 500) were in the past available on the official addons site. Unused protocols can be removed.

==Features==
* Customized look and function according to each individual&#x27;s needs.
* Management and organization of hundreds of IM buddies on many IM networks
** Contact renaming
* Full message archive database
** Simple recall or deletion with the DB Tool or History Sweeper plugin.
* Contact details or photos visible with mouseover. (Needs additional plugin)
* No advertising
* Compact and portable: with few plugins
* Security/Privacy: Saves history on hard disk
* Low memory footprint

==Connectivity==
The protocol plugins included with Miranda IM are AIM, Gadu-Gadu, ICQ, IRC, Microsoft Messenger service (a.k.a. MSN, .NET, Live, etc.), XMPP (&amp; Google Talk), and Yahoo! Messenger. Other protocols available via plugins include Bonjour Fetion, Facebook Messenger, Inter-Asterisk eXchange, Lotus Sametime, NetSend, Myspace, Tencent QQ, SIP, Skype (requires Skype), Tlen.pl, Xfire.

==History==
===Early days===
Miranda IM was first started by Roland Rabien (figbug) on 2 February 2000. At that time, it was a minimalist ICQ clone and officially called Miranda ICQ. The first public release, version 0.0.1, was released on 6 February 2000. This release used LibICQ, had no support for message history, database, and plugins, and had a distribution size of less than 100 KB.

A major new feature of version 0.0.4 was the MegaHAL chat bot, which enabled automatic chatting between Miranda and other ICQ users. Plugin support was added with version 0.0.6. &quot;Logger Plugin&quot; was the first plugin bundled with the official release.

===Version 0.1.x===
After the release of version 0.0.6.1 on 26 December 2000, the original developers left, and Richard &quot;cyreve&quot; Hughes took over the project. His first release, version 0.1.0.0 on 8 April 2001 was improved through a major rewrite. The split message dialog bundled with this release became the first messaging module to be put into a plugin. The .Net Messenger Service protocol plugin appeared around the time of version 0.1.1.0 release becoming the second messaging protocol to be supported by Miranda. This was also the first official release to support language pack translations. Miranda hence had multi-protocol, multi-language instant messenger features.

After v0.1.0.0, Miranda plugin development grew rapidly. With version 0.1.2.1 (28 February 2002), there were approximately 50 plugins available. At the time the new &quot;Lizard&quot; plugin enabled skinning support; the only time Miranda supported skins. &quot;Lizard&quot; development stopped soon after, due to the instability it caused.

===Version 0.2.x===
After the mysterious disappearance of cyreve in June 2002, the developers Martin Öberg (Strickz), Robert Rainwater (rainwater), Sam K (egoDust), and Lyon Lim (lynlimz) took over the project. The MSN protocol was taken over by Rako Shizuka who also developed the first version of Yahoo! Messenger protocol, which was the third protocol supported by Miranda. The &quot;Yahoo!&quot; plugin was closed source, and lost reliability as the official Yahoo! Messenger protocol changed over time – it was later re-written by new developer Gennady Feldman.

The first of the non-IM plugins, including &quot;RSS News&quot; and &quot;Weather&quot;, were released within this period. These added a contact to contact list for the purpose of displaying information to the user rather than chatting. 

Discussion about renaming of the program and removal of &quot;ICQ&quot; from the core began about this time. Due to the increase of protocol support, the project was officially renamed to Miranda IM on 17 December 2002.

The first release under the new name occurred on 1 February 2003, about three years after the beginning of the project, and a bug fix version came two weeks later.

===Version 0.3.x===
The major change in version 0.3, released on 23 June 2003, was the removal of &quot;ICQ&quot; from the core into a plugin. From now on, Miranda could run without the &quot;ICQ&quot; application being installed. The project moved to a new site at www.miranda-im.org, featuring a new discussion board and file listing.

Protocol plugins bundled in version 0.3 included &quot;ICQ&quot;, &quot;MSN&quot;, &quot;AIM&quot;, and &quot;XMPP&quot;. The &quot;Yahoo!&quot; protocol was not included in the package. IRC support was added later by Jörgen Persson (m8rix) to the official release of version 0.3.1, on August 8, 2003.

Another major change was the removal of the &quot;Send-Receive Messaging Module&quot; from the core into a plugin, &quot;SRMM&quot;. This reduced the size of the executable file and encouraged rapid development of messaging modules. During this period many variations (including &quot;SRAMM&quot;, &quot;SRMM_mod&quot;, etc.) offered different new features and improvements over the standard implementation.

ZDNet.be reviewed release 0.3, complimenting its &quot;effortless&quot; contact importing, low memory usage, and extensive variety of plugins, and stating, &quot;Miranda is a strong recommendation for people who have a system tray populated by several IM applications.&quot;

===Version 0.4.x===

Version 0.4 of Miranda IM was released on 7 April 2005. This was the first version to have &quot;Yahoo!&quot; protocol bundled with the official release. Other major changes included the removal of contact list and database module from the core into plugins. As a result, there were 4 variations of contact list modules: the original &quot;clist_classic&quot;, multi-window contact list &quot;clist_mw&quot;, modern contact list &quot;clist_modern&quot;, and nicer contact list with extensive UI customization &quot;clist_nicer&quot;. Other popular plugins released within this period included tabbed message window (&quot;tabsrmm&quot; and &quot;scriver&quot;), HTML based message log support &quot;IE view&quot;, scripting plugin &quot;mbot&quot;, and the meta contact plugin.

===Version 0.5.x===
Version 0.5 of Miranda IM was released on 28 July 2006. This is the first version to have Unicode support available as a download option for Windows NT, 2000 and XP users. Another new feature is the introduction of &quot;AIM Oscar&quot;, first released in early 2006, allowing users to transfer files and receive away messages. This version also provided more support for avatars among the various protocols.

===Version 0.6.x===

Version 0.6 of Miranda IM was released on December 29, 2006. This version introduced UPnP support to improve file transfer and direct connect reliability through routers. Other changes included improved support for UTF-8 strings, improved tabbed options support, and numerous bug fixes.

===Version 0.7.x===
Version 0.7 of Miranda IM was released on 1 October 2007. Key changes included integrated font and icon services, a rewritten menu engine, and a release notifier. One large change is a new way to uniquely identify plugins and the interfaces they implement which may break backward compatibility in the future.

A 2008 CNET review gave the program 4 out of 5 stars, noting that though the interface is &quot;plain&quot;, the program supports most IM protocols in one package. Features favored in the review included its centralized personal information management, &quot;numerous&quot; window behavior controls, and configurable hotkeys.

Techzine.nl reviewed this version, listing its positive attributes as &quot;support for many protocols; small and fast; a lot of plug-ins and skins; many settings&quot; and writing it &quot;will not look bad on your computer. Especially if you are looking for a simple client on a USB stick then Miranda IM is a good choice.&quot; On the other hand, &quot;if you are using WLM (Windows Live Messenger) and you find the settings of the program hard, [we] can not recommend Miranda IM. The typical things like WLM&#x27;s smilies, sounds, winks and games are not standard. You do get that functionality by the wide choice of skins and plug-ins, but for that you do some research and setting work.&quot;

Authors Lui and Chan in &quot;Software Development Rhythms&quot; describe using Miranda IM&#x27;s plugin architecture to copy, modify, and test existing plugins in order to develop &quot;NAMMIK&quot;, a scriptable ICQ chatting bot used to interview people; they refer to Miranda IM&#x27;s architecture as &quot;simple and flexible&quot;.

===Version 0.8.x===
Version 0.8 of Miranda IM was released on 17 June 2009. It included a new Account Manager which supports multiple accounts per protocol (doing away with DLL renaming), built-in SSL support, various enhancements and bugfixes for the core and plugins.

A PCWorld Magazine review of version 0.8.16 noted its addon capability, but stated, &quot;Miranda&#x27;s user interface leaves something to be desired&quot; while referring to its login status icons, wishing for easier management and grouping of contacts, easy blocking/reporting of spammers, and ultimately recommending it &quot;for those who use only surface capabilities of instant messengers.&quot;

===Version 0.9.x===
Version 0.9 of Miranda IM was released on 24 August 2010. It consists of many new features focused on improving Unicode support and overall protocol improvements. It is also the first Miranda IM version to feature an official 64-bit build.

===Version 0.10.x===
Version 0.10 of Miranda IM was released on 18 July 2012. It consists of enhancements to Miranda IM 0.9.x including improved language support and improved networking support.

After years of being self-hosted, version 0.10.80 was transferred to SourceForge on 25 April 2018.

<doc id="255534" wikidata="Q1866715" url="?curid=255534" title="Li'l Abner">
<text>Li&#x27;l Abner was a satirical American comic strip that appeared in multiple newspapers in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It featured a fictional clan of hillbillies living in the impoverished fictional mountain village of Dogpatch, USA. Written and illustrated by Al Capp (1909–1979), the strip ran for 43 years, from August 13, 1934, through November 13, 1977. The Sunday page debuted on February 24, 1935, six months after the daily. It was originally distributed by United Feature Syndicate and later by the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate.

Before Capp introduced Li&#x27;l Abner, his comic strips typically dealt with northern urban American experiences. However, Li&#x27;l Abner was his first strip based in the Southern United States. The comic strip had 60 million readers in over 900 American newspapers and 100 foreign papers across 28 countries.

==Characters==
===Main characters===

* Li&#x27;l Abner Yokum: Abner is portrayed as a simple-minded, gullible, and sweet-natured country bumpkin. He is tall and perpetually 19 years old. He lives in a ramshackle log cabin with his parents. Capp derived the surname &quot;Yokum&quot; as a combination of &quot;yokel&quot; and &quot;hokum&quot;. Abner represents the archetype of a Candide — a paragon of innocence in a sardonically dark and cynical world. Abner has no consistent profession but was a &quot;crescent cutter&quot; for the Little Wonder Privy Company and later a &quot;mattress tester&quot; for the Stunned Ox Mattress Company. In one post-World War II storyline, Abner became a US Air Force bodyguard of Steve Cantor (a parody of Steve Canyon) against the evil bald female spy Jewell Brynner (a parody of actor Yul Brynner). Early in the strip&#x27;s history, Abner&#x27;s primary goal was evading the marital designs of Daisy Mae, the virtuous, voluptuous, barefoot scion of the Yokums&#x27; blood feud enemies: the Scraggs. When Capp finally gave in to reader pressure after 18 years and allowed the couple to tie the knot, it was a major media event, even making the cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine on March 31, 1952 — with an article titled &quot;It&#x27;s Hideously True!! The Creator of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; Tells Why His Hero Is &quot;(SOB!)&quot; Wed!!&quot;
* Daisy Mae Yokum (née Scragg): Daisy Mae is hopelessly in love with Abner throughout the entire 43-year run of the comic strip. During most of the run, the dense Abner exhibited little romantic interest in her. She is curvaceous and sports a famous polka dot peasant blouse and cropped skirt. In 1952, Abner reluctantly proposes to Daisy to emulate the engagement of his comic strip ideal, &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;. Fosdick&#x27;s wedding to longtime fiancée Prudence Pimpleton turns out to be a dream — but Abner and Daisy&#x27;s ceremony, performed by Marryin&#x27; Sam, is binding. Abner and Daisy Mae&#x27;s nuptials were a major source of media attention, landing them on the aforementioned cover of &quot;Life&quot; magazine&#x27;s March 31, 1952, issue. Once married, Abner becomes relatively domesticated. Like Mammy Yokum and the other women in Dogpatch, Daisy Mae does all the work, domestic and otherwise — while the men generally do nothing whatsoever.
* Mammy Yokum: Born Pansy Hunks, Mammy, Abner&#x27;s mother, is the scrawny, highly principled society leader and bare-knuckle champion of the town of Dogpatch. She married Pappy Yokum in 1902; they produced two sons twice their own size. Mammy dominates the Yokum clan through the force of her personality and dominates everyone else with her fearsome right uppercut (sometimes known as her &quot;Goodnight, Irene&quot; punch), which helps her uphold law, order and decency. She is consistently the toughest character throughout &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner.&quot; Mammy does all the household chores and provides her charges with no fewer than eight meals a day of pork chops and turnips (as well as local Dogpatch delicacies like &quot;candied catfish eyeballs&quot; and &quot;trashbean soup&quot;). Her authority is unquestioned, and her characteristic phrase, &quot;Ah has &quot;spoken!&quot;&quot;, signaled the end of all discussion. Her most familiar phrase, however, is &quot;Good is better than evil becuz it&#x27;s &quot;nicer!&quot;&quot; Upon his retirement in 1977, Capp declared Mammy to be his personal favorite of all his characters. She is the only character capable of defeating Abner in hand-to-hand combat.
* Pappy Yokum: Born Lucifer Ornamental Yokum, Pappy is the patriarch of a family. Pappy is so lazy and ineffectual he doesn&#x27;t even bathe himself. Mammy is regularly seen scrubbing Pappy in an outdoor oak tub (&quot;Once a month, rain or shine&quot;). Ironing Pappy&#x27;s trousers falls under her purview as well, although she doesn&#x27;t bother to wait for Pappy to remove them first. Pappy is dull-witted and gullible (in one story he is conned by Marryin&#x27; Sam into buying vanishing cream because he thinks it makes him &quot;invisible&quot; and he picks a fight with his nemesis Earthquake McGoon), but not completely without guile. He had a predilection for snitching &quot;preserved turnips&quot; and smoking corn silk behind the woodshed — Mammy catches him doing so, much to his chagrin. After his lower wisdom teeth grow so long that they squeeze his cerebral Goodness Gland and emerge as forehead horns, he proves himself capable of evil. Mammy solves the problem with a tooth extraction.
* Honest Abe Yokum: Li&#x27;l Abner and Daisy Mae&#x27;s son is born in 1953 &quot;after a pregnancy that ambled on so long that readers began sending me medical books&quot;, wrote Capp. Initially known as &quot;Mysterious Yokum&quot; (there was even an Ideal doll marketed under this name) due to a debate regarding his gender (he is stuck in a pants-shaped stovepipe for the first six weeks), he is renamed &quot;Honest Abe&quot; (after President Abraham Lincoln) to thwart his early tendency to steal. His first words are &quot;po&#x27;k chop&quot;, and they remain his favorite food. Though his uncle Tiny is perpetually frozen at 15 years old, Honest Abe gradually grows from infant to grade school age and looks very much like Washable Jones — the star of Capp&#x27;s early &quot;topper&quot; strip. He eventually acquires a couple of supporting character friends for his own semi-regularly featured adventures in the strip. In one story, he lives up to his nickname when there is a nationwide search for a pair of socks sewn by Betsy Ross; after finding that his father is their current owner and is preparing to trade them for the reward (a handshake from the President of the United States), Abe confesses that they are not his to give.
* Tiny Yokum: &quot;Tiny&quot; is an ironic misnomer; Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s kid brother remains perpetually innocent and 15 years old — despite being tall. Tiny is unmentioned in the strip until September 1954, when a relative who has been raising him reminds Mammy that she&#x27;d given birth to a second child while visiting her 15 years earlier. (The relative explains that she would have dropped him off sooner, but waited until she happened to be in the neighborhood.) Capp introduced Tiny to fill the bachelor role played for nearly two decades by Li&#x27;l Abner, until his 1952 marriage threw the dynamic of the strip out of whack for a period. Pursued by local lovelies Hopeful Mudd and Boyless Bailey, Tiny is even dumber and more awkward than Abner. Tiny initially sports a bulbous nose like both of his parents, but eventually, (through a plot contrivance) he is given a nose job, and his shaggy blond hair is buzz cut to make him more appealing.
* Salomey: The Yokums&#x27; beloved pet pig. Her moniker is a pun on salami and Salome. Cute, lovable and intelligent (arguably smarter than Abner, Tiny or Pappy), she is accepted as part of the family (&quot;the youngest&quot;, as Mammy introduces her). Gourmet experts claim she is an insanely valuable 100% &quot;Hammus alabammus&quot; — a fictional species of pig, and the last female known in existence. A plump, juicy &quot;Hammus alabammus&quot; is the rarest and most vital ingredient of &quot;ecstasy sauce&quot;, an indescribably delicious gourmet delicacy. Consequently, Salomey is frequently targeted by unscrupulous sportsmen, hog breeders and gourmands (like J.R. Fangsley and Bounder J. Roundheels), as well as wild boars (such as Boar Scarloff and Porknoy).

===Supporting characters and villains===
* Marryin&#x27; Sam: A traveling preacher (by mule) who specializes in $2 weddings. He also offers the $8 &quot;ultra-deluxe&quot; special, a ceremony which he officiates while being drawn and quartered by four rampaging jackasses. He cleans up once a year — during Sadie Hawkins season when bachelors are dragged to the altar by their prospective brides. Sam, whose face and figure were reportedly modeled after New York City mayor Fiorello LaGuardia, starts out as a stock villain but gradually softens into a genial, opportunistic comic foil. He isn&#x27;t above chicanery to achieve his ends and is warily viewed by Dogpatch men as a traitor to his gender. Sam was prominently featured on the cover of &quot;Life&quot; in 1952 when he presided over the wedding of Li&#x27;l Abner and Daisy Mae. In the 1956 Li&#x27;l Abner Broadway musical and 1959 Li&#x27;l Abner film adaptation, Sam is played by actor Stubby Kaye.
* Moonbeam McSwine: The unwashed but curvy Moonbeam is one of the iconic hallmarks of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; — an unkempt, lazy, corncob pipe-smoking, flagrant (and &quot;fragrant)&quot;, raven-haired, earthly (and &quot;earthy)&quot; woman. Beautiful Moonbeam prefers the company of pigs to suitors — much to the frustration of her equally lazy father, Moonshine McSwine. She is usually showcased luxuriating among the hogs, somewhat removed from the main action of the story, in a deliberate parody of glamour magazines and pinup calendars of the day. Capp designed her in a caricature of his wife Catherine, who had also suggested Daisy Mae&#x27;s name. In one comic, it is revealed that she bears a striking resemblance to Gloria Van Welbuilt, a famous socialite. She is generally portrayed as good-natured and kind, as shown when she runs to Dogpatch carrying two shmoos under her arms to save them from going extinct, wondering if humanity would ever be good enough for them. She also tells Abner to stop worrying about being a father. Moonbeam seems to have an interest in romance as in some strips, she is seen flirting with and even kissing various male characters, including Abner. She once expresses the desire to have a family of her own and discusses the matter of trapping a husband with Abner. In one strip, it is revealed that Moonbeam was in love with Abner when they were children. In the same strip, it is shown that Moonbeam&#x27;s disposition for filth was born out of a failure to understand Abner&#x27;s interests when he was a child. She actually disliked hogs as a child, but after seeing Abner ignoring the openly romantic advances of a clean Daisy Mae, she dived headfirst into a mud hole where some hogs were wallowing to earn his love, believing that if Abner didn&#x27;t like clean girls, he must like them dirty. Much to her disappointment, this failed to capture his attention. Moonbeam is also unknowingly the star of a horror movie directed by Rock Pincus, head film director of a species called the Pincushions, from planet Pincus 7. This venture ends when Rock is unknowingly grilled, put into a hot dog bun and devoured while still alive.
* Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat: The inseparable, cave-dwelling purveyors of &quot;Kickapoo Joy Juice&quot; — a moonshine elixir of such potency that the fumes alone have been known to melt the rivets off battleships, possibly inspired by a real patent medicine named &quot;Kickapoo Indian Sagwa&quot; although it was produced in Connecticut. Concocted in a large wooden vat by Lonesome Polecat (of the &quot;Fried Dog&quot; Indian tribe, later known as the Polecats, &quot;the one tribe who have never been conquered&quot;) and Hairless Joe (a hirsute, club-wielding, modern Cro-Magnon who frequently makes good on his oft-repeated threat, &quot;Ah&#x27;ll &quot;bash&quot; yore &quot;haid&quot; in!&quot;) The ingredients of the brew are both mysterious and all-encompassing (much like the contents of their cave, which has been known to harbor prehistoric monsters). When a batch &quot;needs more body&quot;, the pair simply go out and club one (often a moose), and toss it in. Over the years, the &quot;recipe&quot; has called for live grizzly bears, panthers, kerosene, horseshoes, and anvils, among other ingredients. An officially licensed soft drink called Kickapoo Joy Juice is still produced by the Monarch Beverage Company of Atlanta, Georgia. Lonesome Polecat was also the official team mascot of the Sioux City Soos, a former Minor League baseball franchise of Sioux City, Iowa.
* Joe Btfsplk: The world&#x27;s worst jinx, Joe Btfsplk has a perpetually dark rain cloud over his head. Instantaneous bad luck befalls anyone in his vicinity. Though well-meaning and friendly, his reputation inevitably precedes him, so he is lonely and thus associates himself with the Scraggs, except in World War II when Joe decides to associate himself with Hirohito. He has an apparently unpronounceable name, but creator Al Capp &quot;pronounced&quot; Btfsplk by simply blowing a &quot;raspberry&quot;, or Bronx cheer. Joe&#x27;s personal storm cloud became one of the most iconic images from the strip.
* : His name is a variant of &quot;jackass&quot;, as made plain in his campaign slogan (see Dialogue and catchphrases). The senator was Al Capp&#x27;s parody of a blustering, self-serving Southern politician. Before 1947, Phogbound was known as Fogbound, but in that year Phogbound &quot;blackmails his fellow Washington senators to appropriate two million dollars to establish Phogbound University&quot; and its brass statue of Phogbound, both reminiscent of self-aggrandizements by Huey Long; the name change allowed Capp to call the university P.U. Phogbound is a corrupt, conspiratorial blowhard; he often wears a coonskin cap and carries an old fashioned flintlock rifle to impress his gullible constituents. In one sequence, Phogbound is unable to campaign in Dogpatch, so he sends his aides with an old, hot-air-filled gas bag that resembles him, and nobody notices the difference.
* Available Jones: An avaricious entrepreneur always available for a price. He has many side businesses, including minding babies (&quot;Dry&quot; for 5¢, &quot;Other kinds&quot; for 10¢). He provides anything from safety pins to battleships, but his most famous &quot;provision&quot; is his cousin, Stupefyin&#x27; Jones.
* Stupefyin&#x27; Jones: A walking aphrodisiac, Stupefyin&#x27; is so gorgeous that any man who glimpses her freezes in his tracks and is rooted to the spot. While she is generally favored by the men of Dogpatch, she is dangerous for a confirmed bachelor to encounter on Sadie Hawkins Day. Actress Julie Newmar became famous overnight for playing the role in the 1956 &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; Broadway musical (and the 1959 film adaptation) without a single line.
* : Created by Al Capp in June 1953, Bashington T. Bullmoose is a mercenary, cold-blooded, capitalist tyrant tycoon. Bullmoose&#x27;s motto (see Dialogue and catchphrases) was adapted by Capp from a statement made by Charles E. Wilson, the former head of General Motors when it was America&#x27;s largest corporation. In 1952, Wilson told a Senate subcommittee, &quot;What is good for the country is good for General Motors, and vice-versa.&quot; Wilson later served as United States Secretary of Defense under President Dwight D. Eisenhower. Bullmoose had a boyhood dream to possess all the money in the world – which he nearly achieved, as Bullmoose Industries owns or controls all businesses in Dogpatch. He has a son named Weakfish, and is sometimes accompanied by his &quot;secretary&quot;, Bim Bovak (whose name was a pun on the term &quot;bimbo&quot; and bombshell actress Kim Novak). Li&#x27;l Abner becomes embroiled in many globetrotting adventures with Bullmoose over the years. Despite his adamantine exterior, General Bullmoose is capable of a kind of capitalist gallantry. &quot;Those Slobbovians [q.v.] have done me out of a hundred thousand dollars!&quot; he once exclaimed, after falling victim to fraud. &quot;Nearly an hour&#x27;s income, bless &#x27;em!&quot;
* Wolf Gal: A feral Amazonian beauty who was raised by wolves and prefers to live among them; she lures unwary Dogpatchers to feed her ravenous pack. Wolf Gal is possibly a cannibal, but the point is never stressed since she considers herself an animal, as do the rest of Dogpatch. One of Capp&#x27;s more popular villains, Wolf Gal was briefly merchandised in the fifties with her own comic book, doll, hand puppet, and latex Halloween mask.
* Earthquake McGoon: Billing himself as &quot;the world&#x27;s dirtiest wrassler&quot;, the bearded, bloated McGoon first appears in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; as a traveling exhibition wrestler in the late 1930s, and was reportedly partially based on real-life grappler Man Mountain Dean. He has a look-alike cousin named Typhoon McGoon. McGoon became increasingly prominent in the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; Cream of Wheat print ads of the 1940s, and later, with the early television exposure of wrestlers such as Gorgeous George. Earthquake is the nastiest resident of neighboring Skonk Hollow — a notoriously lawless community where no Dogpatcher dares set foot. McGoon often attempts to walk Daisy Mae home &quot;Skonk Hollow style&quot;, the implications of which are never made specific.
* The Scraggs: Hulking, leering, gap-toothed twin miscreants Lem and Luke and their proud father, Romeo. Apelike and gleefully homicidal, the evil Scraggs were officially declared inhuman by an act of Congress, and pass the time by burning down orphanages just to have light to read by (although they quickly remember that they are illiterate). Distant kinfolk of Daisy Mae, they carry on a blood feud with the Yokums throughout the run of the strip; in their first introduction after being run out of a Kentucky county at gunpoint, they try to kill Li&#x27;l Abner but are beaten up by both Abner and Mammy Yokum. Mammy then banishes the Scraggs to Skonk Hollow with a dividing line between Skonk Hollow and Dogpatch, with the understanding that although the Scraggs can&#x27;t cross the line, any member of Dogpatch who does cross becomes their prey. A long-lost kid sister, named &quot;*@!!*!&quot;-Belle Scragg, briefly joins the clan in 1947. Attired in a prison-striped reform school miniskirt, &quot;*@!!*!&quot;-Belle is outwardly attractive but as rotten as her siblings on the inside. Her censored first name is an expletive, compelling everyone who addresses her to apologize profusely afterwards.
* Nightmare Alice: Dogpatch&#x27;s own &quot;conjurin&#x27; woman&quot;, a hideous, cackling crone who practices Louisiana Voodoo and black magic. Capp named her after the carnival-themed horror film, &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; (1947). She employs witchcraft to &quot;whomp up&quot; ghosts and monsters to do her bidding. She is occasionally assisted by Doctor Babaloo, a witch doctor of the Belgian Congo, as well as her demonic niece Scary Lou, who specializes in hexing voodoo dolls that resemble Li&#x27;l Abner.
* Ole Man Mose: The mysterious Mose is reportedly hundreds of years old, and lives like a hermit in a cave atop a mountain, refusing to &quot;kick the bucket&quot;, which is positioned just outside his cave door. His wisdom is absolute (&quot;Ole Man Mose — &quot;he knows!&quot;&quot;), and his sought-after annual Sadie Hawkins Day predictions — though cryptic and misleading — are 100% accurate.
* Evil Eye Fleagle: Fleagle has a unique skill: the evil eye. A &quot;whammy&quot;, as he calls it, can stop a charging bull in its tracks. A &quot;double whammy&quot; can fell a skyscraper, leaving Fleagle exhausted. His dreaded &quot;triple whammy&quot; can melt a battleship but would practically kill Fleagle in the process. The zoot suit-clad Fleagle is a native of Brooklyn, and his New York accent is unmistakable — especially when addressing his &quot;goil&quot;, the zaftig Shoiley. Fleagle was so popular, that licensed plastic replicas of Fleagle&#x27;s face were produced in the 1950s, to be worn as lapel pins. Battery-operated, the wearer could pull a string and produce a flashing light bulb &quot;whammy&quot;. Fleagle was reportedly based on a real-life person, a Runyonesque local boxing trainer and hanger-on named Benjamin &quot;Evil Eye&quot; Finkle. Finkle and his famous &quot;hex&quot; were a ringside fixture in New York boxing circles during the 1930s/40s. Fleagle was portrayed by character actor Al Nesor in the stage play and film.
* J. Roaringham Fatback: The bloated, self-styled &quot;Pork King&quot; is a greedy, unscrupulous business tycoon. Incensed to find that Dogpatch casts a shadow on his breakfast egg, he has the whole community moved for his convenience.
* Gat Garson: Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s &quot;doppelgänger&quot;, a murderous racketeer with an interest in Daisy Mae.
* Aunt Bessie: Mammy&#x27;s socialite kid sister, the Duchess of Bopshire, and the &quot;white sheep&quot; of the family. Bessie&#x27;s string of marriages into Boston and Park Avenue aristocracy leave her a classist, condescending snob. Her status-seeking crusades to make Abner over and marry him off into high society are always doomed to failure. Aunt Bessie virtually disappears from the strip after Abner and Daisy Mae&#x27;s marriage in 1952, having conceded defeat in her attempt to remake Abner in her own image as a social climber.
* Big Barnsmell: The lonely &quot;inside man&quot; at the &quot;Skonk Works&quot; — a dilapidated factory located on the remote outskirts of Dogpatch. Scores of locals are done in yearly by the toxic fumes of concentrated &quot;skonk oil&quot;, which is brewed and barreled daily by Barnsmell and his cousin (&quot;outside man&quot; Barney Barnsmell) by grinding dead skunks and worn shoes into a smoldering still, for some unspecified purpose. His job wreaks havoc on his social life (&quot;He has an air about him,&quot; as Dogpatchers put it), and the name of his facility entered the modern lexicon via the Lockheed Skunk Works project.
* Soft-Hearted John: Dogpatch&#x27;s mercenary, black-hearted grocer, the ironically named Soft-Hearted John gleefully swindles and starves his clientele and looks disturbingly satanic. He has an idiot nephew who sometimes runs the store in his stead, named Soft-Headed John.
* Smilin&#x27; Zack: A cadaverous, outwardly peaceable mountaineer with a menacing grin and shotgun, who prefers things &quot;quiet&quot; to the point of silence. Zack&#x27;s moniker is a reference to another comic strip, &quot;The Adventures of Smilin&#x27; Jack&quot; by Zack Mosley.
* Dr. Killmare: The local Dogpatch physician who is a horse doctor. His name is a pun on &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot;.
* Cap&#x27;n Eddie Ricketyback: Decrepit World War I aviator and proprietor/sole operator of the even more decrepit Dogpatch Airlines. Cap&#x27;n Eddie&#x27;s name is a spoof of decorated World War I flying ace, Eddie Rickenbacker. In 1970, Cap&#x27;n Eddie and his firm Trans-Dogpatch Airlines are awarded the West Berlin Route by his old rival Count Felix Von Holenhedt.
* Count Felix Von Holenhedt: German flying ace who in 1970 (age 89) is appointed as West German Civil Aviation Chief. He is never photographed without his World War I spiked helmet on his head. He wears it to cover the hole in his head from being shot &quot;clean through th&#x27; haid, in a dogfight over Flanders Field in 1918&quot; by Cap&#x27;n Eddie Ricketyback. Nonetheless, the two old enemies eventually patch things up; Cap&#x27;n Ricketyback persuades the Count to settle in the States. &quot;Jah!&quot; cries the Count. &quot;I got a cousin in Milvaukee!&quot; Von Holenhedt is the only person able to properly play the &quot;pfschlngg&quot;, a complexly-shaped brass instrument, part of whose tubing needs to pass &quot;through&quot; the player&#x27;s head.
* Weakeyes Yokum: Cousin Weakeyes mistakes grizzly bears for romantically inclined &quot;rich gals&quot; in fur coats, and ends sequences characteristically by walking off a cliff.
* Young Eddie McSkonk and U.S. Mule: The ancient, creaky, white-bearded Dogpatch postmaster and his hoary jackass mount. They are usually too feeble to handle the sacks of timeworn, cobweb-covered letters marked &quot;Rush&quot; at the Dogpatch Express Post Office.
* J. Colossal McGenius: The brilliant marketing consultant and &quot;idea man&quot; who charges $10,000 per word for his sought-after business advice which usually bankrupts his clients. McGenius is given to telling long-winded jokes with forgotten punch lines, as well as for spells of hiccups and belches (borne of a fondness for gassy soft drinks like &quot;Burpsi-Booma&quot; and &quot;Eleven Urp&quot;). He is aided by his lovely and meticulously efficient secretary, Miss Pennypacker.
* Silent Yokum: Prudent Cousin Silent never utters a word unless it&#x27;s vitally important. Consequently, he hasn&#x27;t spoken in 40 years. The arrival of Silent in Dogpatch signals earthshaking news on the horizon. Capp would milk readers&#x27; suspense by having Silent &quot;warm up&quot; his rusty, creaking jaw muscles for a few days, before the momentous pronouncement.
* Happy Vermin: The &quot;world&#x27;s smartest cartoonist&quot; — a caricature of Ham Fisher — who hires Li&#x27;l Abner to draw his comic strip for him in a dimly-lit closet. Instead of using Vermin&#x27;s tired characters, Abner peoples the strip with hillbillies. Vermin tells his assistant: &quot;I&#x27;m proud of having created these characters!! They&#x27;ll make millions for me!! And if they do — I&#x27;ll get &quot;you&quot; a new light bulb!!&quot;
* Big Stanislouse; aka Big Julius: Stanislouse is a brutal gangster with a childish fondness for TV superheroes (like &quot;Chickensouperman&quot; and &quot;Milton the Masked Martian&quot;). Part of a virtual goon squad of comic mobsters that inhabit &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; and &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;, the oafish Stanislouse alternates with other all-purpose underworld thugs, including &quot;the Boys from the Syndicate&quot; — Capp&#x27;s euphemism for The Mob.
* The Square-Eyes Family: Mammy&#x27;s encounter with these unpopular Dogpatch outcasts first appears in 1956 as a thinly-veiled appeal for racial tolerance. It was later issued as an educational comic book — called &quot;Mammy Yokum and the Great Dogpatch Mystery!&quot; — by the Anti-Defamation League of B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith.
* Appassionata Von Climax: One of a series of predatory, sexually aggressive sirens who pursue Li&#x27;l Abner prior to his marriage, and even afterward, much to the consternation of Daisy Mae. One of many femmes fatales and spoiled debutantes, including Gloria Van Welbilt, Moonlight Sonata, Mimi Van Pett and &quot;The Tigress&quot;; Appassionata was portrayed by Tina Louise (on stage) and Stella Stevens (on film). Capp was surprised he got her suggestive name past censors.
* Tenderleif Ericson: Discovered frozen in the mud where her Viking ship sank in 1047, Tenderleif is Leif Ericson&#x27;s beautiful seventeen-year-old sister (complete with breastplate, Viking helmet and Norwegian accent). As soon as she sees Li&#x27;l Abner, she starts to warm up and breathe hard, as she hasn&#x27;t had a date for nine hundred years.
* Princess Minihahaskirt: A Native American princess. One of the several Native women who try to seduce Lonesome Polecat, the including Minnie Mustache, Raving Dove, Little Turkey Wing, and Princess Two Feathers.
* Liddle Noodnik: A naked and miserable resident of perpetually frozen Lower Slobbovia, Liddle Noodnik usually recites a farcical poem to greet visiting dignitaries or sings the Slobbovian national anthem. Like many terms in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, Noodnik&#x27;s name was derived from Yiddish; &quot;Nudnik&quot; is a slang term for a bothersome person or pest.
* Pantless Perkins: A late addition to the strip, Pantless Perkins is Honest Abe&#x27;s brainy friend from a series of kid-friendly stories in the 1970s, probably created to compete with &quot;Peanuts&quot;. Pantless doesn&#x27;t own any trousers and wears an oversized turtleneck sweater to hide this fact. In one storyline, he helps Honest Abe find the long-lost lover of a millionaire in return for a pair of pants. Unfortunately, the prospective groom drops dead after tasting the terrible cooking of his bride-to-be, and Pantless remains without pants.
* Rotten Ralphie: The child version of Earthquake McGoon, Ralphie is Dogpatch&#x27;s neighborhood bully. Exceedingly large for his age, Ralphie always wears a cowboy outfit that is several sizes too small. In one storyline, after Ralphie beats up every boy in Dogpatch at the same time, Pantless Perkins and Honest Abe trick him into getting into a fight with the Scragg boys of Skonk Hollow, who beat him up.
* Marcia Perkins: An outwardly normal teenager whose lips give off 451°F of electromagnetic heat, frying the brain of any boy who kisses her. Declared a walking health hazard, Marcia wears a public warning sign (&quot;Do Not Kiss This Girl, by Order of the Dept. of Health, Education and Welfare&quot;). Her notoriety precedes her everywhere except in Dogpatch, where she meets and falls for Tiny Yokum.
* Bet-a-Million Bashby: Bashby amasses his colossal fortune by always betting on sure things and betting with fools. However, Abner always wins bets against him through foolish luck.
* The Widder Fruitful: A iconic Dogpatch regular often glimpsed in passing or featured in crowd scenes. The ample widow is always holding three or four naked newborns under each arm carried backside forward, with a large brood of children following behind her.
* Loverboynik: In 1954, Capp sent a letter to Liberace stating his intention to spoof him in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; as &quot;Liverachy&quot;. Liberace had his lawyers threaten to sue. Capp changed the name and went ahead anyway. Nicknamed the &quot;Sweetheart of the Piano&quot;, Loverboynik is a blonde, dimpled pianist and TV heartthrob. According to Capp, Liberace was &quot;cut to the quick&quot; when the parody appeared. Capp insisted that Loverboynik was not Liberace because Loverboynik &quot;could play the piano rather decently and rarely wore black lace underwear.&quot;
* Rock Hustler: An unscrupulous publicity agent turned marketing mogul. He masterminds an advertising campaign promoting the miracle diet food &quot;Mockaroni&quot;, not disclosing that it&#x27;s both addictive and lethal: &quot;The more you crave, the more you eat. The more you eat, the thinner you get — until you float away...&quot;
* Dumpington Van Lump: The bloated, almost catatonic heir to the Van Lump fortune, Dumpington can only utter one syllable (&quot;Urp!&quot;) until he sees Daisy Mae for the first time. His favorite book is called &quot;How to Make Lampshades Out of Your Friends&quot;. Capp chose the Dumpington storyline to illustrate his lesson on continuity in storytelling in the &quot;Famous Artists Cartoon Course&quot;.
* Sam the Centaur: A mythical creature with a chiselled profile and blonde mane. Sam is a Greek centaur who occasionally roams the mountains of Dogpatch instead of the mountains of Thessaly. Available Jones insists that he isn&#x27;t real.
* Jubilation T. Cornpone: Dogpatch&#x27;s founder and most famous resident, memorialized by a town statue. He was a Confederate known for &quot;Cornpone&#x27;s Retreat&quot;, &quot;Cornpone&#x27;s Disaster&quot;, &quot;Cornpone&#x27;s Stupidity&quot;, &quot;Cornpone&#x27;s Misjudgment&quot;, &quot;Cornpone&#x27;s Hoomiliation&quot;, and &quot;Cornpone&#x27;s Final Mistake&quot;. Cornpone was such an incompetent military leader that he came to be considered an important asset of the opposing side. According to the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; stage play, the statue was commissioned by Abraham Lincoln. In one storyline, the statue is filled with Kickapoo Joy juice, which brings it to life. It then goes on a rampage, beheading all the statues of Union Army generals. The U.S. Army can&#x27;t destroy it, since it&#x27;s a National Monument, so Kickapoo Joy Juice is poured into a Union statue, which results in both statues annihilating each other. At Mammy Yokum&#x27;s urging, the statue pieces are put back together with glue. The general is the namesake of a musical number in the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; musical, sung by Marryin&#x27; Sam and chorus.
* Jubilation T. Cornpone Jr: The son of General Cornpone. A former commander of army mules, he becomes Commander of all U.N. Forces against Invaders from Outer Space, despite being the most incompetent general of all time. He is given the job because no other general would take it. Cornpone falls in love with Princess Pocahauntingeyes and lives with her in the land above Dogpatch, connected by the &quot;Trashbean stalk&quot;.
* Romeo McHaystack: An aspiring Don Juan from Pineapple Junction, whose attempts at romancing women are frustrated because of the Civic Improvement League tattooing a warning about him on his forehead. He decides to go after Dogpatch women when he discovers that radioactive waste is suspended above the town, casting it permanently in darkness.
* Sadie Hawkins: Sadie Hawkins is considered the homeliest girl in Dogpatch. Her father Hekzebiah Hawkins, a prominent Dogpatch resident, does not want Sadie to live at home for the rest of his life, and establishes the first annual Sadie Hawkins Day, a foot race in which all the unmarried women pursued the town&#x27;s bachelors and get married if they catch them. A pseudo-holiday created in the strip, it&#x27;s still frequently observed today in the form of Sadie Hawkins dances, where it is customary for women to ask men to dance.
* Lena the Hyena: An ugly Lower Slobbovian girl, initially only glimpsed from the neck down&quot;.&quot; Lena is so ugly that anyone who sees her is immediately driven insane. After weeks of hiding Lena&#x27;s face behind &quot;censored&quot; stickers and strategically placed dialogue balloons, Capp invited fans to draw Lena in a nationwide contest in 1946. Lena was ultimately revealed in the winning entry (as judged by Frank Sinatra, Boris Karloff and Salvador Dalí) drawn by cartoonist Basil Wolverton.
* Joanie Phoanie: A communist agitator who sings revolutionary songs about class warfare (with titles like &quot;Molotov Cocktails for Two&quot;) while traveling via limousine and charging exorbitant concert fees to impoverished orphans. Joanie is Capp&#x27;s parody of singer/songwriter Joan Baez. The character caused controversy in 1966, and many newspapers only ran censored versions of the strips. In her autobiography, Baez said about it that &quot;Mr. Capp confused me considerably. I&#x27;m sorry he&#x27;s not alive to read this, it would make him chuckle.&quot;
* S.W.I.N.E.: Capp lived in Cambridge, Massachusetts, near Harvard, and satirized student political groups and hippies during the Vietnam war protest era, including the Youth International Party (YIP) and Students for a Democratic Society (SDS) in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; as S.W.I.N.E. (Students Wildly Indignant about Nearly Everything).
* Al Capp claimed that he tried to give minor characters in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; names that would render further description unnecessary. This includes recurring characters Tobacco Rhoda, Joan L. Sullivan, Hamfat Gooch, Global McBlimp, Concertino Constipato, Jinx Rasputinburg, J. Sweetbody Goodpants, Reactionary J. Repugnant, B. Fowler McNest, Fleabrain, Stubborn P. Tolliver, Idiot J. Tolliver, Battling McNoodnik, Mayor Dan&#x27;l Dawgmeat, Slobberlips McJab, One-Fault Jones, Swami Riva, Olman Riva, Sir Orble Gasse-Payne, Black Rufe, Mickey Looney, &quot;Ironpants&quot; Bailey, Henry Cabbage Cod, Flash Boredom, Priceless and Liceless, Hopeless and Soapless, Disgustin&#x27; Jones, Skelton McCloset, Hawg McCall, &quot;Good old&quot; Bedly Damp, and more.

===&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;===

&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; was a comic strip-within-the-strip parody of Chester Gould&#x27;s plainclothes detective, &quot;Dick Tracy&quot;. It first appeared in 1942 and ran intermittently in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; over the next 35 years. Gould was also personally parodied in the series as cartoonist Lester Gooch — the small and occasionally deranged creator of &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot;. The style of the &quot;Fosdick&quot; sequences closely mimicked &quot;Tracy&quot;, including the urban setting, outrageous villains, high mortality rate, hatched shadows, and lettering style — Gould&#x27;s signature was also parodied. Fosdick battles several archenemies with absurd names like Rattop, Anyface, Bombface, Boldfinger, the Atom Bum, the Chippendale Chair, and Sidney the Crooked Parrot, as well as his own criminal mastermind father, &quot;Fearful&quot; Fosdick (aka &quot;The Original&quot;). Fosdick is perpetually pierced by so many bullets that he resembles Swiss cheese. Fosdick seems impervious and considers the holes &quot;mere scratches&quot;, however, and always reports back to his corrupt superior &quot;The Chief&quot; for duty the next day.

Besides being fearless, Fosdick is &quot;pure, underpaid and purposeful,&quot; according to his creator. He has notoriously bad aim, often causing collateral damage to pedestrians. Fosdick sees his duty as destroying crime rather than maintaining safety. Fosdick lives in squalor at a dilapidated boarding house run by his mercenary landlord, Mrs. Flintnose. He never marries his fiancée Prudence Pimpleton (despite an engagement of 17 years). He became the star of his own NBC puppet show that same year. Fosdick was the long-running advertising spokesperson for Wildroot Cream-Oil, a popular men&#x27;s hair product of the period.

==Setting and fictitious locales==
Although apparently set in the Kentucky mountains, situations often took the characters to different destinations — including New York City, Washington, D.C., Hollywood, the South American Amazon, tropical islands, the Moon, and Mars — as well as some purely fictional locations:

===Dogpatch===
Including every stereotype of Appalachia, the impoverished Dogpatch consists mostly of ramshackle log cabins, turnip fields, pine trees, and hogwallows. Most Dogpatchers are shiftless, ignorant scoundrels and thieves. The men are too lazy to work, and Dogpatch girls are desperate enough to chase them. Those who farm their turnip fields watch turnip termites swarm by the billions every year to devour Dogpatch&#x27;s only crop (along with their homes, their livestock, and all their clothing).

The local geography is fluid and complex; Capp continually changes it to suit the current storyline. Natural landmarks include (at various times) Teeterin&#x27; Rock, Onneccessary Mountain, Bottomless Canyon, and Kissin&#x27; Rock. Local attractions include the West Po&#x27;k Chop Railroad; the &quot;Skonk Works&quot;, a dilapidated factory located on the remote outskirts of Dogpatch; and the General Jubilation T. Cornpone memorial statue.

In one storyline, Dogpatch&#x27;s Cannonball Express train, after 1,563 tries, finally delivers its cargo to Dogpatch citizens on October 12, 1946. Receiving a 13-year stack of newspapers, Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s family realizes that the Great Depression is happening and that banks will close; they race to take their money out of the bank before realizing they have no money to begin with. Other news from the stack includes the inauguration of Franklin Delano Roosevelt as president on March 4, 1933 (although Mammy Yokum thinks the President is Teddy Roosevelt), and a picture of Germany&#x27;s new leader Adolf Hitler (April 21, 1933).

Capp intended for suffering Americans in the midst of the Great Depression, to laugh at the residents of Dogpatch even worse off than themselves. In his words, Dogpatch was &quot;an average stone-age community nestled in a bleak valley, between two cheap and uninteresting hills somewhere.&quot; Early in the continuity, Capp referred to Dogpatch being in Kentucky, but he was careful afterward to keep its location generic, probably to avoid cancellations from Kentucky newspapers. He then referred to it as Dogpatch, USA, and did not give any specific location. Many states tried to claim ownership of the town (like Georgia, Tennessee, and Alabama), yet Capp did not confirm any of these. Dogpatch&#x27;s distinctive cartoon landscape became as identified with the strip as any of its characters. Later, Capp licensed and was co-owner of an , $35 million theme park called Dogpatch USA near Harrison, Arkansas.

===Lower Slobbovia===
Frigid, faraway Lower Slobbovia was a political satire of communist nations and foreign diplomacy. Its residents are perpetually waist-deep in several feet of snow, and icicles hang from their frostbitten noses. The favorite dish of the starving natives is raw polar bear. Lower Slobbovians speak with pidgin Russian accents.

Slobbovia is an iceberg, which continually capsizes as its lower portions melt. This dunks Upper Slobbovia into Lower Slobbovia, and raises the latter into the former.

Conceptually based on Siberia, or perhaps specifically on Birobidzhan, the region made its first appearance in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; in April 1946. Ruled by Good King Nogoodnik (sometimes known as King Stubbornovsky the Last), the Slobbovian politicians are even more corrupt than their Dogpatch counterparts. Their monetary unit is the &quot;rasbucknik&quot;,: one was worth nothing and a large quantity is worth even less, due to the trouble of carrying them around. The local children are read tales from &quot;Ice-sop&#x27;s Fables&quot;, parodies of Aesop&#x27;s Fables with a dark sardonic bent (and titles like &quot;Coldilocks and the Three Bares&quot;).

===Other fictional locales===
Other fictional locales included Skonk Hollow, El Passionato, Kigmyland, the Republic of Crumbumbo, Lo Kunning, Faminostan, Planets Pincus Number 2 and 7, Pineapple Junction and the Valley of the Shmoon.

== Mythic creatures ==
&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; features many allegorical animals, designed to satirize a disturbing aspect of human nature. They include:
* Shmoos — Creatures that breed exponentially, consume nothing, and eagerly provide everything that humankind wants. They produce milk (bottled) and eggs (packaged), and taste like pork when roasted, chicken when fried, and steak when broiled.
* Kigmies — Masochistic creatures who loved to be kicked up to a point, after which they go on a rampage of retaliation. (The Kigmy story was originally a metaphor for racial and religious oppression. Capp&#x27;s surviving preliminary sketches of the Kigmies make this apparent, as detailed in the introductory notes to &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner Dailies 1949: Volume 15&quot;, Kitchen Sink Press, 1992).
* The Bald Iggle — A cute, wide-eyed creature whose gaze compels everyone to involuntarily tell the truth. The Iggle is officially declared a public menace by the FBI and exterminated.
* Nogoodniks — Also known as bad Shmoos. Nogoodniks are sickly green, have small red eyes, sharp yellow teeth, and are the sworn enemies of humanity. Frequently sporting 5 o&#x27;clock shadow, eyepatches, scars, and fangs — they devour good Shmoos and wreak havoc on Dogpatch. When they are subjected to George Jessel&#x27;s recording of Paul Whiteman&#x27;s &quot;Wagon Wheels&quot;, it kills them instantly.
* Shminfants — Modified baby Shmoos, which look like human babies but are eternally young, come in a variety of colors, and never need changing.
* Shtoonks — Imported from the Slobbovian embassy, Shtoonks are sharp-toothed, hairy, flying creatures which are sneaky, smelly, surly, and inedible. Shtoonks love human misery so much that they enjoy bringing bad news. They temporarily replace postage stamps by delivering bills and other bad news for free.
* Mimikniks — Obsessive Slobbovian songbirds who mimic the singing of anyone they hear. (Those who have heard Maria Callas are valued. Those who have heard George Jessel are shot.) The only song they know the words to is &quot;Short&#x27;nin&#x27; Bread&quot;, due it being the only record in Lower Slobbovia.
* The Money Ha-Ha — An alien creature from &quot;Planet Pincus No. 2&quot;, with ears shaped like taxi horns. It lays U.S. currency in place of eggs.
* Turnip Termites — Looking like a cross between a locust and a piranha, billions of these insatiable pests swarm once a year to their ancient feeding ground, Dogpatch.
* Shminks — Valued for making coats. They can only be captured by hitting them in the head with a kitchen door.
* Pincushions — Alien beings from &quot;Planet Pincus No. 7&quot;. Like the earlier Moon Critters, they look like flying sausages with pinwheels on their posteriors.
* Abominable Snow-Hams — Delicious but intelligent and sensitive beings. They present Tiny Yokum with an ethical dilemma, if eating one constitutes cannibalism.
* The Slobbovian Amp-Eater — A luminous beast that consumes electric currents, creating an energy crisis.
* Bashful Bulganiks — Timid birds that are so skittish they can not be seen by human eyes, and are thus theoretical.
* Stunflowers — Murderous anthropomorphic houseplants; anyone trying to pick their seeds falls into the Bottomless Canyon.
* Fatoceroses — Bloated pachyderms against which the only defense is a plate of lethally addictive &quot;Mockaroni&quot;.
* Bitingales — Small, fiendish birds whose bite causes unbearable heat for 24 years.
* The Slobbovian King Crab — A huge crustacean that only eats Slobbovian kings. Later supplemented by a marsupial called the Kingaroo which only eats Slobbovian kings.
* The Flapaloo — A scrawny, prehistoric bird that lays 1,000 eggs per minute. The eggs, when dissolved, turn water into gasoline. The oil industry captures the last one in existence and kills it.
* Gobbleglops — Insatiable creatures that look like a cross between a hog and a teddy bear. They eat garbage and cannot be touched, as they are red-hot, living incinerators. Mammy leads them to America&#x27;s major polluted cities, where they devour all the garbage. When the garbage runs out, they begin to consume everything and everyone in sight.
* Shmeagles — The world&#x27;s most amorous creatures; the males pursue the females at the speed of light or faster.
* Hammus Alabammus — The Faux Latin designation for an adorable and delicious species of swine, with a &quot;zoot snoot&quot; and a &quot;drape shape&quot;. The only known female in existence resides with the Yokums as their beloved pet, Salomey.

==Dialogue and catchphrases==
Capp, a northeasterner, wrote all the dialogue in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; using his approximation of a mock-southern dialect (including phonetic sounds, eye dialect, incorrect spelling, and malapropisms). He interspersed boldface type and included prompt words in parentheses (&quot;chuckle!, sob!, gasp!, shudder!, smack!, drool!, cackle!, snort!, gulp!, blush!, ugh!,&quot; etc.) to bolster the effect of the speech balloons. Almost every line was followed by two exclamation marks for added emphasis.

Outside Dogpatch, characters use a variety of stock Vaudevillian dialects. Mobsters and criminals speak slangy Brooklynese, and residents of Lower Slobbovia speak pidgin-Russian, some Yinglish. British characters also have comical dialects — like H&#x27;Inspector Blugstone of Scotland Yard (who has a Cockney accent) and Sir Cecil Cesspool (whose speech is a clipped King&#x27;s English). Various Asian, Latin, Native American, and European characters speak in a wide range of caricatured dialects as well. Capp has credited his inspiration for vividly stylized language to early literary influences like Charles Dickens, Mark Twain and Damon Runyon, as well as old-time radio and the burlesque stage.

Comics historian Don Markstein has commented that Capp&#x27;s &quot;use of language was both unique and universally appealing; and his clean, bold cartooning style provided a perfect vehicle for his creations.&quot;

The following is a partial list of characteristic expressions that appear often in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner:&quot;
* &quot;Natcherly!&quot;
* &quot;Amoozin&#x27; but confoozin&#x27;!&quot;
* &quot;Yo&#x27; big, sloppy &quot;beast!!&quot;&quot; (also, &quot;Yo&#x27; mizzable &quot;skonk!!&quot;&quot;)
* &quot;Ef Ah had mah druthers, Ah&#x27;d druther...&quot;
* &quot;As any fool kin plainly see!&quot; (Response: &quot;&quot;Ah&quot; sees!&quot;)
* &quot;What&#x27;s good for General Bullmoose is good for &quot;everybody!&quot;&quot; (Variant from the movie: &quot;...good for the USA!&quot;)
* &quot;Thar&#x27;s no Jack S. like &quot;our&quot; Jack S!&quot;
* &quot;Oh, happy day!&quot;
* &quot;Th&#x27; ideel o&#x27; ev&#x27;ry one hunnerd percent, red-blooded American boy!&quot;
* &quot;Ah&#x27;ll &quot;bash&quot; yore &quot;haid&quot; in!!&quot;
* &quot;Wal, fry mah hide!&quot; (also, &quot;Wal, cuss mah bones!&quot;)
* &quot;Ah has &quot;spoken!&quot;&quot;
* &quot;Good is better than evil becuz it&#x27;s &quot;nicer!&quot;&quot;
* &quot;It hain&#x27;t &quot;hoomin&quot;, thass whut it hain&#x27;t!&quot;

==Toppers and alternate strips==
&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; had several toppers on the Sunday page, including

* &quot;Washable Jones&quot; (February 24 – June 9, 1935)
* &quot;Advice fo&#x27; Chillun&quot;, aka &quot;Advice fo&#x27; Gals&quot;, &quot;Advice fo&#x27; Parents&quot;, &quot;Advice fo&#x27; Yo&#x27; All&quot; and other titles (June 23, 1935 – Aug 15, 1943)
* &quot;Small Change&quot;, a.k.a. &quot;Small Fry&quot; (May 31, 1942 – 1944)

The Sunday page debuted six months into the run of the strip. The first topper was &quot;Washable Jones&quot;, a weekly continuity about a four-year-old hillbilly boy (Washable Jones) who goes fishing and accidentally hooks a ghost. Capp ended the strip with Washable&#x27;s mother waking him up, revealing that the story was a dream. After this, Capp expanded &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; by another row and filled the rest of the space with a page-wide title panel and a small panel called &quot;Advice fo&#x27; Chillun&quot;. Washable Jones appeared in the strip in 1949, and appeared with the Shmoos in two one-shot comics – &quot;Al Capp&#x27;s Shmoo in Washable Jones&#x27; Travels&quot; (1950, a premium for Oxydol laundry detergent) and &quot;Washable Jones and the Shmoo&quot; #1 (1953, published by the Capp-owned publisher Toby Press).

Al Capp also wrote two other daily comic strips:

* &quot;Abbie an&#x27; Slats&quot;, drawn by Raeburn Van Buren (Capp wrote the strip from July 12, 1937, through 1945: writing of the strip was continued by Capp&#x27;s brother Elliot Caplin until the strip&#x27;s end on January 30, 1971).
* &quot;Long Sam&quot;, drawn by Bob Lubbers (Capp wrote the strip from May 31, 1954 to sometime in 1955; writing of the strip was continued by Elliot Caplin for a time, and then by Lubbers until the strip ended on December 29, 1962).

==Licensing, advertising and promotion==
Capp devised several publicity campaigns to boost circulation and increase public visibility of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, often coordinating with national magazines, radio and television. In 1946, Capp persuaded six of the most popular radio personalities (Frank Sinatra, Kate Smith, Danny Kaye, Bob Hope, Fred Waring, and Smilin&#x27; Jack Smith) to broadcast a song he&#x27;d written for Daisy Mae: &quot;(Li&#x27;l Abner) Don&#x27;t Marry That Girl!!&quot; Other promotional tie-ins included the Lena the Hyena Contest (1946), the Name the Shmoo Contest (1949), the Nancy O. Contest (1951), and the Roger the Lodger Contest (1964).

&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; characters were often featured in mid-century American advertising campaigns including Grape-Nuts cereal, Kraft caramels, Ivory soap, Oxydol, Duz and Dreft detergents, Fruit of the Loom, Orange Crush, Nestlé cocoa, Cheney neckties, Pedigree pencils, Strunk chainsaws, U.S. Royal tires, Head &amp; Shoulders shampoo, and General Electric light bulbs. There were Dogpatch-themed family restaurants called &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s&quot; in Louisville, Kentucky, Morton Grove, Illinois, and Seattle, Washington.

Capp himself appeared in numerous print ads: Chesterfield cigarettes (he was a lifelong chainsmoker); Schaeffer fountain pen with his friends Milton Caniff and Walt Kelly; the Famous Artists School (in which he had a financial interest) along with Caniff, Rube Goldberg, Virgil Partch, Willard Mullin, and Whitney Darrow Jr.; and, though a teetotaler, Rheingold Beer.

* Cream of Wheat: Throughout the 1940s and 1950s, Li&#x27;l Abner was the spokesman for Cream of Wheat cereal in a long-running series of comic strip-format ads that appeared in national magazines including &quot;Life&quot;, &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, and &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;. The ads usually featured Daisy Mae calling for help against a threat — Earthquake McGoon, a gorilla, a grizzly bear, a rampaging moose, an attack from a Native American, or a natural disaster. Abner is dispatched to rescue her, but not before enjoying an enriched bowl of Cream of Wheat.
* Wildroot Cream-Oil: &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; was licensed for use in an advertising campaign for Wildroot Cream-Oil, a popular men&#x27;s hair tonic. Fosdick&#x27;s profile on advertising displays became a prominent fixture in barbershops across America — advising readers to &quot;Get Wildroot Cream-Oil, Charlie!&quot; A series of ads appeared in newspapers, magazines and comic books featuring Fosdick&#x27;s battles with Anyface, a murderous master of disguise. Anyface was always given away by his dandruff and messy hair.
* Toys and licensed merchandise: Dogpatch characters were heavily licensed throughout the 1940s and 1950s: the main cast was produced as a set of six hand puppets and dolls by Baby Barry Toys in 1957. A 10-figure set of carnival chalkware statues of Dogpatch characters was manufactured by Artrix Products in 1951, and Topstone introduced a line of 16 rubber Halloween masks prior to 1960. After the introduction of the Shmoos, they were licensed everywhere in 1948 and 1949. A garment factory in Baltimore made a line of Schmoo apparel — including &quot;Shmooveralls&quot;, Shmoo dolls, clocks, watches, jewelry, earmuffs, wallpaper, fishing lures, air fresheners, soap, ice cream, balloons, ashtrays, comic books, records, sheet music, toys, games, Halloween masks, salt and pepper shakers, decals, pinbacks, tumblers, coin banks, greeting cards, planters, neckties, suspenders, belts, curtains, and fountain pens. In one year, Shmoo merchandise generated over $25 million in sales. Close to a hundred licensed Shmoo products from 75 different manufacturers were produced, some of which sold five million units each. Dark Horse Comics issued figures of Abner, Daisy Mae, Fosdick, and the Shmoo in 2000 as part of their line of Classic Comic Characters — statues #8, 9, 17 and 31, respectively.
* Kickapoo Joy Juice: Kickapoo Joy Juice, featured in the strip and as lethal moonshine (it could also remove hair, paint, and tattoos) has been a licensed brand in real life since 1965. The National NuGrape Company first produced the beverage, which was acquired in 1968 by the Moxie Company, and eventually the Monarch Beverage Company of Atlanta, Georgia. The actual product is a soft drink. The label features Hairless Joe and Lonesome Polecat. Distribution currently includes the United States, Canada, Singapore, Bangladesh, China, Pakistan, Malaysia, Mongolia, Brunei, Indonesia, and Thailand.
* Dogpatch USA: In 1968, an , $35 million theme park called Dogpatch USA opened in Marble Falls, Arkansas, based on Capp&#x27;s work and with his support. The gift shops sold souvenirs like corncob pipes and moonshine jugs. In addition to the newly constructed rides and attractions, many of the buildings in the park were authentic 19th-century log structures purchased by general manager James H. Schermerhorn. The logs in each building were numbered, cataloged, disassembled and reassembled at the park. Dogpatch USA was a popular attraction during the 1970s, but was closed in 1993 due to mismanagement and financial difficulties. Several attempts have been made to reopen the park but it remains abandoned. As of late 2005, the area has been stripped by vandals and souvenir hunters, and is today slowly being reclaimed by the surrounding Arkansas wilderness. There were plans for it to reopen in 2018, but they fell through.

==Awards and recognition==
Fans of the strip include novelist John Steinbeck, who called Capp &quot;very possibly the best writer in the world today&quot; in 1953 and recommended him for the Nobel Prize in literature, and media critic and theorist Marshall McLuhan, who considered Capp &quot;the only robust satirical force in American life.&quot; John Updike, calling Li&#x27;l Abner a &quot;hillbilly Candide&quot;, said that the strip&#x27;s &quot;richness of social and philosophical commentary approached the Voltairean.&quot; Capp has been compared to Fyodor Dostoevsky, Jonathan Swift, Laurence Sterne, and François Rabelais. &quot;Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; called him &quot;the Mark Twain of cartoonists&quot;. Charlie Chaplin, William F. Buckley, Al Hirschfeld, Harpo Marx, Russ Meyer, John Kenneth Galbraith, Ralph Bakshi, Shel Silverstein, Hugh Downs, Gene Shalit, Frank Cho, Daniel Clowes, and Queen Elizabeth are all reportedly fans of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;.

In book &quot;Understanding Media&quot;, Marshall McLuhan called &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&#x27;s&quot; Dogpatch &quot;a paradigm of the human situation&quot;. Comparing Capp to other contemporary humorists, McLuhan wrote: &quot;Arno, Nash, and Thurber are brittle, wistful little &quot;précieux&quot; beside Capp!&quot; In his essay &quot;The Decline of the Comics&quot;, (&quot;Canadian Forum&quot;, January 1954) literary critic Hugh MacLean classified American comic strips into four types: daily gag, adventure, soap opera, and &quot;an almost lost comic ideal: the disinterested comment on life&#x27;s pattern and meaning.&quot; In the fourth type, according to MacLean, there were only two: &quot;Pogo&quot; and &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. In 2002, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, in a review of &quot;The Short Life and Happy Times of the Shmoo&quot;, noted: &quot;The wry, ornery, brilliantly perceptive satirist will go down as one of the Great American Humorists.&quot; In &quot;America&#x27;s Great Comic Strip Artists&quot; (1997), comics historian Richard Marschall analyzed the misanthropic subtext of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner:&quot;

&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was also the subject of the first book-length, scholarly assessment of a comic strip ever published&quot;; Li&#x27;l Abner: A Study in American Satire&quot; by Arthur Asa Berger (Twayne, 1969) contained serious analyses of Capp&#x27;s narrative technique, use of dialogue, self-caricature and grotesquerie, the strip&#x27;s overall place in American satire, and the significance of social criticism and the graphic image. &quot;One of the few strips ever taken seriously by students of American culture,&quot; wrote Berger, &quot;&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; is worth studying...because of Capp&#x27;s imagination and artistry, and because of the strip&#x27;s very obvious social relevance.&quot; The book was reprinted by the University Press of Mississippi in 1994.

Al Capp&#x27;s life and career are the subjects of a life-sized mural commemorating his 100th birthday, displayed in downtown Amesbury, Massachusetts. According to &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, the town renamed its amphitheatre in his honor.

* National Cartoonists Society Reuben Award (1947) for &quot;Cartoonist of the Year&quot;.
* Inkpot Award (1978) from Comic-Con International.
* National Cartoonists Society Elzie Segar Award (1979) for a &quot;unique and outstanding contribution to the profession of cartooning.&quot;
* Inductee into the National Cartoon Museum (formerly the International Museum of Cartoon Art) Hall of Fame (one of only 31 artists).
* Inductee into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame in 2004.
* &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was one of 20 American comic strips included in the Comic Strip Classics series of United States Postal Service commemorative stamps. 

==Influence and legacy==

===Sadie Hawkins Day===
Sadie Hawkins Day is a pseudo-holiday created in the strip. It first appeared in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; on November 15, 1937. Capp originally created it as a comedic plot device, but in 1939, two years after its debut, a double-page spread in &quot;Life&quot; proclaimed, &quot;On Sadie Hawkins Day Girls Chase Boys in 201 Colleges&quot;. By 1952, the event was reportedly celebrated at 40,000 venues. It became a rite of women&#x27;s empowerment at high schools and college campuses before second-wave feminism gained prominence.

Outside of the comic strip, a Sadie Hawkins dance is a gender role reversal. Women and girls take the initiative in inviting a man or boy out on a date — almost unheard of before 1937 — to a dance. When Capp created the event, it wasn&#x27;t his intention to have it occur annually on a specific date. However, due to its enormous popularity and the numerous fan letters he received, Capp made it a tradition in the strip every November, lasting four decades. In many localities, the tradition still continues.

Al Capp ended his comic strip by setting a date for Sadie Hawkins Day. In the strip on November 5, 1977, Li&#x27;l Abner and Daisy Mae make a final visit to Capp, and Daisy insists that Capp settle on a date. Capp suggests November 26, and Daisy rewarded him with a kiss.

===Language===
Sadie Hawkins Day and Sadie Hawkins dance are two of several terms attributed to Capp that have entered the English lexicon. Others include double whammy, skunkworks, and Lower Slobbovia. The term &quot;shmoo&quot; is used in defining technical concepts in four fields of science.

* In socioeconomics, a &quot;shmoo&quot; refers to any generic kind of good that reproduces itself (as opposed to widgets which require resources and active production).
* In microbiology, &quot;shmooing&quot; is the biological term used for the budding process in yeast reproduction. The cellular bulge produced by a haploid yeast cell towards a cell of the opposite mating type during the mating of yeast is referred to as a &quot;shmoo&quot;, due to its structural resemblance to the cartoon character.
* In particle physics, a &quot;shmoo&quot; refers to a high-energy survey instrument – as utilized at the Los Alamos National Laboratory for the Cygnus X-3 Sky Survey performed at the LAMPF (Los Alamos Meson Physics Facility) grounds. Over one hundred white &quot;shmoo&quot; detectors were sprinkled around the accelerator beamstop area and adjacent mesa to capture Subatomic cosmic ray particles emitted from the constellation Cygnus. The detectors housed scintillators and photomultipliers in an array that gave the detector its Shmoo-like shape.
* In electrical engineering, a shmoo plot is the technical term used for the graphic pattern of test circuits. (The term is also used as a verb: to &quot;shmoo&quot; means to run the test.)

Capp has been credited with popularizing terms such as &quot;natcherly&quot;, schmooze, druthers, nogoodnik, and neatnik. (In his book &quot;The American Language&quot;, H. L. Mencken credits the postwar trend of adding &quot;-nik&quot; to the ends of adjectives to create nouns as beginning in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;.)

===Franchise ownership and creators&#x27; rights===
In the late 1940s, newspaper syndicates typically owned the copyrights, trademarks, and licensing rights to comic strips. According to publisher Denis Kitchen, &quot;Nearly all comic strips, even today, are owned and controlled by syndicates, &quot;not&quot; the strips&#x27; creators. And virtually all cartoonists remain content with their diluted share of any merchandising revenue their syndicates arrange. When the starving and broke Capp first sold &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; in 1934, he gladly accepted the syndicate&#x27;s standard onerous contract. But in 1947 Capp sued United Feature Syndicate for $14 million, publicly embarrassed UFS in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, and wrested ownership and control of his creation the following year.&quot;

In an October 1947 strip, Li&#x27;l Abner met Rockwell P. Squeezeblood, head of the corrupt Squeezeblood Syndicate, a thinly veiled dig at the United Feature Syndicate. The resulting sequence, &quot;Jack Jawbreaker Fights Crime!!&quot;, was a satire of DC Comics&#x27;s notorious exploitation of Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster over &quot;Superman&quot;. It was later reprinted in &quot;The World of Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1953).

In 1964, Capp left United Features and took &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; to the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate.

===Integration of women in the NCS===
Capp was outspoken in favor of diversifying the National Cartoonists Society by admitting women cartoonists. The NCS had originally disallowed female members into its ranks. In 1949, when they refused membership to Hilda Terry, creator of the comic strip &quot;Teena&quot;, Capp temporarily resigned in protest. &quot;Capp had always advocated a more activist agenda for the Society, and he had begun in December 1949 to make his case in the Newsletter as well as at the meetings,&quot; wrote comics historian R. C. Harvey. According to Tom Roberts, author of &quot;Alex Raymond: His Life and Art&quot; (2007), Capp authored a monologue that was instrumental in changing the rules the following year. Hilda Terry was the first woman cartoonist admitted in 1950.

===Social commentary in comic strips===
Through &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, the American comic strip achieved unprecedented relevance in the postwar years, attracting new readers who were more intellectual and informed on current events (according to Coulton Waugh, author of &quot;The Comics&quot;, 1947). &quot;When &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; made its debut in 1934, the vast majority of comic strips were designed chiefly to amuse or thrill their readers. Capp turned that world upside-down by routinely injecting politics and social commentary into &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;,&quot; wrote comics historian Rick Marschall in &quot;America&#x27;s Great Comic Strip Artists&quot; (1989). With adult readers far outnumbering young ones, &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; cleared away the concept that humor strips were solely the domain of adolescents and children. &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; provided a new template for contemporary satire and personal expression in comics, paving the way for &quot;Pogo&quot;, &quot;Feiffer&quot;, &quot;Doonesbury&quot;, and &quot;MAD&quot;.

===&quot;Mad&quot;===
&quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; and other &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; comic strip parodies, such as &quot;Jack Jawbreaker!&quot; (1947) and &quot;Little Fanny Gooney&quot; (1952), were likely an inspiration to Harvey Kurtzman when he created &quot;Mad&quot;, which began in 1952 as a comic book that parodied other comics in the same manner. By the time EC Comics published &quot;Mad #1&quot;, Capp had been doing &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; for nearly a decade. Similarities between &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; and the early &quot;Mad&quot; include the incongruous use of mock-Yiddish slang terms, the disdain for pop culture icons, the black humor, the dearth of sentiment, and the broad visual styling. The trademark comic signs that clutter the backgrounds of Will Elder&#x27;s panels had a precedent in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, in the residence of Dogpatch entrepreneur Available Jones, though they&#x27;re also reminiscent of Bill Holman&#x27;s &quot;Smokey Stover&quot;. Kurtzman resisted doing feature parodies of either &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; or &quot;Dick Tracy&quot; in &quot;Mad&quot;, despite their prominence.

===Parodies and imitations===
Al Capp once told one of his assistants that he knew &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; had finally &quot;arrived&quot; when it was first pirated as a pornographic Tijuana bible parody in the mid-1930s. &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was also parodied in 1954 (as &quot;Li&#x27;l Melvin&quot; by &quot;Ol&#x27; Hatt&quot;) in the pages of EC Comics&#x27; humor comic, &quot;Panic&quot;, edited by Al Feldstein. Kurtzman eventually did spoof &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (as &quot;Li&#x27;l Ab&#x27;r&quot;) in 1957, in his short-lived humor magazine, &quot;Trump&quot;. Both the &quot;Trump&quot; and &quot;Panic&quot; parodies were drawn by Will Elder. In 1947, Will Eisner&#x27;s &quot;The Spirit&quot; satirized the comic strip business in general, as a denizen of Central City tries to murder cartoonist &quot;Al Slapp&quot;, creator of &quot;Li&#x27;l Adam&quot;. Capp was also caricatured as an ill-mannered, boozy cartoonist (Capp was a teetotaler in real life) named &quot;Hal Rapp&quot; in the comic strip &quot;Mary Worth&quot; by Allen Saunders and Ken Ernst. Supposedly done in retaliation for Capp&#x27;s &quot;Mary Worm&quot; parody in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; (1956), a media-fed &quot;feud&quot; commenced briefly between the rival strips. It turned out to be a collaborative hoax by Capp and his longtime friend Saunders as a publicity stunt.

&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;&#x27;s success also sparked some comic strip imitators. &quot;Jasper Jooks&quot; by Jess &quot;Baldy&quot; Benton (1948–&#x27;49), &quot;Ozark Ike&quot; (1945–&#x27;53), and &quot;Cotton Woods&quot; (1955–&#x27;58), both by Ray Gotto, were inspired by Capp&#x27;s strip. Boody Rogers&#x27; &quot;Babe&quot; was a series of comic books about a beautiful hillbilly girl who lives with her kin in the Ozarks, with many similarities to &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;. &quot;Looie Lazybones&quot;, an overt imitation (drawn by Frank Frazetta) ran in several issues of Standard&#x27;s &quot;Thrilling Comics&quot; in the late 1940s. Charlton Comics published the short-lived &quot;Hillbilly Comics&quot; by Art Gates in 1955, featuring &quot;Gumbo Galahad&quot;, who looked identical to Li&#x27;l Abner, similar to &quot;Pokey Oakey&quot; by Don Dean, which ran in MLJ&#x27;s &quot;Top-Notch Laugh&quot; and &quot;Pep Comics&quot;. Later, many fans and critics saw Paul Henning&#x27;s popular TV sitcom, &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; (1962–&#x27;71) as inspired by &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, prompting Alvin Toffler to ask Capp about the similarities in a 1965 &quot;Playboy&quot; interview.

==Popularity and production==

&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; made its debut on August 13, 1934, in eight North American newspapers, including the &quot;New-York Mirror.&quot; Initially owned and syndicated through United Feature Syndicate, a division of the E. W. Scripps Company, it was an immediate success. According to publisher Denis Kitchen, Capp&#x27;s &quot;hapless Dogpatchers hit a nerve in Depression-era America. Within three years &quot;Abner&#x27;s&quot; circulation climbed to 253 newspapers, reaching over 15,000,000 readers. Before long he was in hundreds more, with a total readership exceeding 60,000,000.&quot; At its peak, the strip was read daily by 70 million Americans with a circulation of more than 900 newspapers in North America and Europe.

During the peak of the strip, Capp&#x27;s workload grew to include advertising, merchandising, promotional work, comic book adaptations, and public service material in addition to the regular six dailies and one Sunday strip per week. Capp had a team of assistants in later years who worked under his direct supervision. They included Andy Amato, Harvey Curtis, Walter Johnson, and Frank Frazetta, who penciled the Sunday continuity from studio roughs from 1954 to the end of 1961 before his fame as a fantasy artist.

Due to his own experience working on &quot;Joe Palooka&quot;, Capp frequently drew attention to his assistants in interviews and publicity pieces. A 1950 cover story in &quot;Time&quot; included photos of two of his employees, whose roles in the production were detailed by Capp. This irregular policy has led to the misconception that his strip was ghostwritten by others. However, the production of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; has been well documented, and Capp maintained creative control over every stage of production for virtually the entire run of the strip. Capp originated the stories, wrote the dialogue, designed the major characters, rough penciled the preliminary staging and action of each panel, oversaw the finished pencils, and drew and inked the faces and hands of the characters. &quot;He had &quot;the touch,&quot;&quot; Frazetta said of Capp in 2008. &quot;He knew how to take an otherwise ordinary drawing and really make it &quot;pop&quot;. I&#x27;ll never knock his talent.&quot;

&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; ran until November 13, 1977, when Capp retired with an apology to his fans for the declining quality of the strip, which he said had been the best he could manage due to advancing illness. &quot;If you have any sense of humor about your strip — and I had a sense of humor about mine — you knew that for three- or four-years &quot;Abner&quot; was wrong. Oh hell, it&#x27;s like a fighter retiring. I stayed on longer than I should have,&quot; he admitted.&quot; When the strip retired, &quot;People&quot; magazine ran a substantial feature and &quot;The New York Times&quot; devoted nearly a full page to the event, according to publisher Denis Kitchen. Capp, a lifelong chain smoker, died from emphysema two years later at age 70, at his home in South Hampton, New Hampshire, on November 5, 1979.

In 1988 and 1989, many newspapers ran old of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; strips, mostly from the 1940s run, distributed by Newspaper Enterprise Association and Capp Enterprises. Following the 1989 revival of &quot;Pogo&quot;, a revival of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was also planned in 1990. Drawn by cartoonist Steve Stiles, the new &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was approved by Capp&#x27;s widow and his brother Elliott Caplin, but Al Capp&#x27;s daughter, Julie Capp, objected at the last minute and permission was withdrawn.

===Radio and recordings===
With John Hodiak in the title role, the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; radio drama ran weekdays on NBC from Chicago, from November 20, 1939, to December 6, 1940. The rest of the cast included Laurette Fillbrandt as Daisy Mae, Hazel Dopheide as Mammy Yokum, and Clarence Hartzell as Pappy. Durward Kirby was the announcer. The radio show was written by Charles Gussman, who consulted closely with Capp on the storylines.

Kitchen Sink Press began publishing the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner Dailies&quot; in hardcover and paperback, one year per volume, in 1988. The demise of KSP in 1999 stopped the reprint series at Volume 27 (1961). Dark Horse Comics reprinted the limited series &quot;Al Capp&#x27;s Li&#x27;l Abner: The Frazetta Years,&quot; in four full-color volumes covering the Sunday pages from 1954 to 1961. They also released an archive hardcover reprint of the complete &quot;Shmoo Comics&quot; in 2009, followed by a second Shmoo volume of complete newspaper strips in 2011.

At San Diego Comic-Con in July 2009, IDW Publishing and The Library of American Comics announced the publication of &quot;Al Capp&#x27;s Li&#x27;l Abner: The Complete Dailies and Color Sundays: Vol. 1 (1934–1936)&quot;. The comprehensive series titled &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner: The Complete Dailies &amp; Color Sundays&quot;, a reprinting of the complete 43-year history of &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; spanning a projected 20 volumes, began on April 7, 2010.

===Public service works===
Capp provided specialty artwork for civic groups, government agencies, and nonprofit organizations. The following titles are all single-issue, educational comic books and pamphlets produced for public services:

* &quot;Al Capp by Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; — public service giveaway issued by the Red Cross (1946)

Dogpatch characters were used in national campaigns for the United States Department of the Treasury, the Cancer Foundation, the March of Dimes, the National Heart Fund, the Sister Kenny Foundation, the Boy Scouts of America, Community Chest, the National Reading Council, Minnesota Tuberculosis and Health Association, the Christmas Seal &amp; Charity Stamp Society, the National Amputation Foundation, and Disabled American Veterans.

===Animation and puppetry===
Beginning in 1944, &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was adapted into a series of color theatrical cartoons by Screen Gems for Columbia Pictures, directed by Sid Marcus, Bob Wickersham, and Howard Swift. The five titles were: &quot;Amoozin But Confoozin&quot;, &quot;Sadie Hawkins Day&quot;, &quot;A Peekoolyar Sitcheeyshun&quot;, &quot;Porkuliar Piggy,&quot; and &quot;Kickapoo Juice&quot;. Capp was reportedly not pleased with the results, and the series was discontinued after five shorts. Li&#x27;l Abner was voiced by Frank Graham.

Evil-Eye Fleegle makes an animated cameo appearance in the United States Armed Forces Special Weapons Project training film, &quot;Self Preservation in an Atomic Attack&quot; (1950). Lena the Hyena makes a brief animated appearance in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988).

In 1952, &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; was incorporated into a short-lived TV series. The puppet show was created and directed by puppeteer Mary Chase, written by Everett Crosby, and voiced by John Griggs, Gilbert Mack, and Jean Carson. &quot;Fearless Fosdick&quot; premiered on Sunday afternoons on NBC; 13 episodes featuring the Mary Chase marionettes were produced. The storylines and villains were mostly unique to the show. Among the original TV characters were Mr. Ditto, Harris Tweed (a disembodied suit of clothes), Swenn Golly (a Svengali-like mesmerist), counterfeiters Max Millions and Minton Mooney, Frank N. Stein, Batula, Match Head (a pyromaniac), Sen-Sen O&#x27;Toole, Shmoozer, and Herman the Ape Man.

Shmoos were originally meant to be included in the 1956 Broadway &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; musical, employing stage puppetry. The idea was reportedly abandoned in the development stage by the producers for reasons of practicality. After Capp&#x27;s death, the Shmoo was used in two Hanna-Barbera produced Saturday morning cartoon series for TV. First in the 1979 &quot;The New Shmoo&quot; (later incorporated into &quot;Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo&quot;), and again from 1980 to 1981 in the &quot;Flintstone Comedy Show&quot;, in the &quot;Bedrock Cops&quot; segments.

===Stage, film and television===
The first &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; film was made at RKO Pictures in 1940, starring Jeff York (credited as Granville Owen), Martha O&#x27;Driscoll, Mona Ray, and Johnnie Morris. This film gives a fairly faithful portrayal of the Dogpatch characters up until that time. Buster Keaton appears as Lonesome Polecat, and the title song had lyrics by Milton Berle. Silent comedy veterans in the cast include Bud Jamison, Lucien Littlefield, Johnny Arthur, Mickey Daniels, Chester Conklin, Edgar Kennedy, and Al St. John. The story concerns Daisy Mae&#x27;s efforts to catch Li&#x27;l Abner on Sadie Hawkins Day. Since this movie predates their comic strip marriage, Abner makes a last-minute escape.

A much more successful musical comedy adaptation of the strip, also titled &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, opened on Broadway at the St. James Theatre on November 15, 1956, and had a run of 693 performances, followed by a nationwide tour. Among the actors originally considered for the title role were Dick Shawn and Andy Griffith. The stage musical, with music and lyrics by Gene de Paul and Johnny Mercer, was adapted into a Technicolor motion picture at Paramount Pictures in 1959 by producer Norman Panama and director Melvin Frank, with an original score by Nelson Riddle. Starring Peter Palmer, Leslie Parrish, Julie Newmar, Stella Stevens, Stubby Kaye, Billie Hayes, Howard St. John, Joe E. Marks, Carmen Alvarez, William Lanteau, and Bern Hoffman, with cameos by Jerry Lewis, Robert Strauss, Ted Thurston, Alan Carney, Valerie Harper, and Donna Douglas. Three members of the original Broadway cast did not appear in the film version: Charlotte Rae (who was replaced by Billie Hayes early in the stage production), Edie Adams (who was pregnant during the filming) and Tina Louise. The musical has since become a favorite of high school and amateur productions, due to its popular appeal and modest production requirements.

&quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; never sold as a TV series despite several attempts (including an unsold pilot that aired once on NBC on September 5, 1967). Capp appeared as a regular on &quot;Author Meets the Critics&quot;. He was also a periodic panelist on ABC and NBC&#x27;s &quot;Who Said That?&quot; Capp has appeared as himself on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;, Sid Caesar&#x27;s &quot;Your Show of Shows&quot;, &quot;The Today Show&quot;, &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot;, &quot;The Mike Douglas Show&quot;, as well as &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on February 12, 1961, with host Ralph Edwards and honoree Peter Palmer. He hosted five television programs between 1952 and 1972: three talk shows called &quot;The Al Capp Show&quot; (twice), and &quot;Al Capp&quot;, &quot;Al Capp&#x27;s America&quot; (a live &quot;chalk talk&quot;, with Capp providing commentary while sketching cartoons), and a game show called &quot;Anyone Can Win&quot;. Capp&#x27;s appearances on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; spanned three emcees; Steve Allen, Jack Paar, and Johnny Carson.

==Beyond the comic strip==
* &quot;ABNER&quot; was the name given to the first codebreaking computer used by the National Security Agency. According to longtime NSA computer expert Samuel Simon Snyder, &quot;We chose the name from Li&#x27;l Abner Yokum, the comic strip character who was a big brute, but not very smart, because we believed that computers, which can be big and do brute-force operations, aren&#x27;t very bright either. They can only follow simple instructions but can&#x27;t think for themselves.&quot; ABNER was originally given 15 simple computer programs, later doubled to 30. When it was secretly completed in April 1952, it was the &quot;most sophisticated computer of its time.&quot;
* The 1989 film &quot;I Want to Go Home&quot; (&quot;Je Veux Rentrer a la Maison,&quot; screenplay by Jules Feiffer) contains a scene in which the main character, a retired cartoonist played by Adolph Green, makes an emotional appeal for Al Capp and his legacy.
* The original Dogpatch is a historical part of San Francisco dating back to the 1860s that escaped the 1906 earthquake.
* Later in the 20th century, United States Army and Marine Corps units in Vietnam during the Vietnam War called their housing compounds &quot;Dogpatches&quot;, due to the primitive living conditions.
* Li&#x27;l Abner, Daisy Mae, Wolf Gal, Earthquake McGoon, Lonesome Polecat, Hairless Joe, Sadie Hawkins, Silent Yokum, and Fearless Fosdick were all painted on the noses of bombers during World War II and the Korean War, as did Kickapoo Joy Juice, Lena the Hyena, and the Shmoo. Moonbeam McSwine was on the P-51D Mustang United States Army Air Force escort fighter flown by William T. Whisner Jr., still operable and appearing in air shows as of 2008. During World War II, the Royal Canadian Air Force 418 Search and Rescue Operational Training Squadron obtained permission to put the Dogpatch characters on their de Havilland Mosquito fighter-bombers and after the war, their B-25 Mitchell bombers.
* Al Capp claimed to have created the miniskirt when he first put one on Daisy Mae in 1934.
* &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; was censored for the first time September 1947, and was pulled from papers by Scripps-Howard. The controversy, as reported in &quot;Time&quot;, centered on Capp&#x27;s portrayal of the United States Senate. Edward Leech of Scripps said, &quot;We don&#x27;t think it is good editing or sound citizenship to picture the Senate as an assemblage of freaks and crooks... boobs and undesirables.&quot;
* Li&#x27;l Abner hair part always faces the viewer, no matter which direction Abner is facing, and Capp answered questions by saying he parts his hair on both sides. Capp claimed that he found the look for Li&#x27;l Abner from Henry Fonda&#x27;s character Dave Tolliver in &quot;The Trail of the Lonesome Pine&quot; (1936). Fonda later commented, &quot;He&#x27;s never told me, but I was told he has said that.&quot;
* Joan Baez took Al Capp to court in 1967 over the character of Joanie Phoanie. She did not ask for damages, but instead wanted a public retraction. The judge decided in Capp&#x27;s favor. Declaring that satire was protected by freedom of speech, he refused to order Capp to cease and desist. In recent years, Baez has admitted to being amused by the parody, including an excerpt in her memoirs (&quot;And a Voice to Sing With: A Memoir&quot;, published in 1987). &quot;I wish I could have laughed at this at the time,&quot; she wrote in a caption under one of the strips.
* In &quot;The Honeymooners&quot; episode 2, &quot;Funny Money&quot;, Ralph Kramden tells his wife Alice, &quot;I didn&#x27;t start this, Mammy Yokum did&quot; in an argument concerning a comment made by Ralph&#x27;s mother in-law.
* In 1960, Dixieland jazz trombonist Turk Murphy christened his San Francisco jazz club &quot;Earthquake McGoon&#x27;s&quot;, in honor of the &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; villain.
* In 1968, its first year of operation, Dogpatch USA had 300,000 visitors. Admission was $1.50 for adults, and half price for children. Al Capp&#x27;s son Colin Capp worked at the park that year, and met and married Vicki Cox, the actress portraying Moonbeam McSwine. Capp had previously spoofed the idea of a theme park based on his characters in &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot;, in a 1955 Disneyland parody called &quot;Hal Yappland&quot;.
* Al Capp designed a statue of Josiah Flintabattey Flonatin (&quot;Flinty&quot;) for the city of Flin Flon. The town&#x27;s name is taken from the lead character in a 1905 dime novel &quot;The Sunless City&quot; by J. E. Preston Muddock. The character is of such importance to the identity of the city that the local chamber of commerce commissioned the minting of a $3.00 coin, which was considered legal tender within the city during the year following its issue. They had the fiberglass sculpture moved to its present location at the Flin Flon Tourist Park in 1962.
* &quot;Natcherly&quot;, Capp&#x27;s bastardization of the word &quot;naturally&quot;, turns up occasionally in popular culture; for example, in &quot;West Side Story&quot;, in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s original lyrics to &quot;Gee, Officer Krupke&quot; (1957).
* Mell Lazarus, creator of &quot;Miss Peach&quot; and &quot;Momma&quot;, wrote a comic novel in 1963 titled &quot;The Boss Is Crazy, Too.&quot; It was partly inspired by his apprenticeship working for Al Capp and his brother Elliot Caplin at Toby Press, which published &quot;Shmoo Comics&quot; in the late 1940s. In a seminar at the Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center on November 8, 2008, Lazarus called his experience at Toby &quot;the five funniest years of my life.&quot; Lazarus cited Capp as one of the &quot;four essentials&quot; in the field of newspaper cartoonists along with Walt Kelly, Charles M. Schulz, and Milton Caniff.
* Utah governor Gary Herbert referred to himself as Available Jones, the Dogpatch entrepreneur who does anything for a price, at a private meeting with lobbyists on April 27, 2016 to raise funds for his re-election campaign.
* Since his death in 1979, Al Capp and his work have been the subject of more than 40 books, including three biographies. Underground comix cartoonist and &quot;Li&#x27;l Abner&quot; expert Denis Kitchen has published, co-published, edited, or otherwise served as a consultant on nearly all of them.

<doc id="255539" wikidata="Q313436" url="?curid=255539" title="Olof Skötkonung">
<text>Olof Skötkonung (; – 1022), sometimes stylized as Olaf the Swede, was King of Sweden, son of Eric the Victorious and, according to Icelandic sources, Sigrid the Haughty. He succeeded his father in c. 995. He stands at the threshold of recorded history, since he is the first Swedish ruler about whom there is substantial knowledge. He is regarded as the first king known to have ruled both the Swedes and the Geats, and the first king in Sweden to have minted coins. In Sweden, the reign of Olof Skötkonung is considered to mark the transition from the Viking Age to the Middle Ages. He was the first Christian king in central Sweden. Norse beliefs persisted in parts of Sweden until the 12–13th century, with some keeping the tradition into modern times.

Olof and the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard formed an alliance and defeated the Norwegian king Olaf Tryggvason in the Battle of Svolder in 999 or 1000. After the battle, the victorious leaders split Norway into areas of control. Heimskringla gives a detailed account of the division. Olof received four districts in Trondheim as well as Møre, Romsdal and Rånrike.

==Etymology==
One of many explanations for the name &quot;Skötkonung&quot; is that it is derived from the Swedish word &quot;skatt&quot;, which can mean either &quot;taxes&quot; or &quot;treasure&quot;. The latter meaning has been interpreted as &quot;tributary king&quot; and one English scholar speculates about a tributary relationship to the Danish king Sweyn Forkbeard, who was his stepfather. That explanation, however, is not supported by evidence or historical sources. Another possible explanation of the name refers to the fact that he was the first Swedish king to mint coins. An ancient land ownership ceremony which placed a parcel of earth in someone&#x27;s &quot;lap&quot; (Swedish: &quot;sköte&quot;) was called &quot;scotting&quot; and may have been involved in this epithet.

The Old Norse &quot;Óláfr sœnski&quot; means &quot;Olaf the Swedish&quot;, an epithet used to distinguish him from the Norwegian kings Olaf Tryggvasson and Olaf Haraldsson.

==Life==
General knowledge of Olof&#x27;s life is mostly based on Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s and Adam of Bremen&#x27;s accounts, which have been subject to criticism from some scholars. The eldest account by the German ecclesiastic chronicler Adam of Bremen (c. 1075), relates that Sweyn Forkbeard was expelled from his Danish realm by the Swedish King Eric the Victorious in the late 10th century. When Eric died (c. 995), Sweyn returned and regained his kingdom, marrying Eric&#x27;s widow. Meanwhile, however, Olof had succeeded his father Eric, gathered an army, and launched a surprise attack against Sweyn. The Danish king was once again expelled while Olof occupied his lands. After this, however, the conflict was resolved. Since Sweyn had married Olof&#x27;s mother, he was reinstated on the Danish throne and the two kings were thereafter allies. Snorri Sturluson (c. 1230) and the other Icelandic saga writers likewise say that Sweyn married Olof&#x27;s mother after the death of Eric the Victorious, but without mentioning any conflict. Also, Snorri describes Sweyn and Olof as equal allies when they defeated the Norwegian king Olav Tryggvason in the battle of Svolder in 1000, and thereafter divided Norway between themselves (see below). It is commonly believed that Adam&#x27;s account about Sweyn&#x27;s defeats at the hands of Eric and Olof is partial and might have been misinterpreted; the marriage to Olof&#x27;s mother may in fact have sealed Sweyn&#x27;s senior position.
===Viking expedition to Wendland===
According to Snorri, Olof Skötkonung led a Viking expedition to Wendland early in his reign. He captured Edla, the daughter of a Wendish chieftain, and kept her as mistress. She gave him the son Emund (who was to become king of Sweden), and the daughters Astrid (later wife of Olaf II of Norway) and Holmfrid (married to Sven Jarl of Norway). He later married Estrid of the Obotrites, and they had a son, Anund Jacob, and a daughter, Ingegerd Olofsdotter.

===Alliance with Sweyn Forkbeard===
While Adam of Bremen praises Olof as a good Christian, Icelandic authors paint an unfavourable picture of the king as haughty and prickly. Olof is said to have preferred royal sports to war, which may explain the ease with which Sweyn Forkbeard retook the Danish lands Olof&#x27;s father Eric had conquered. Olof may also have lost the right to tribute which his predecessors had preserved in what is now Estonia and Latvia.

In 1000, he joined forces with Sweyn Forkbeard and with the Norwegian Jarls Eric and Sven, against the Norwegian King Olaf Tryggvason. The circumstances have been much debated in modern historical research, but a contemporary poem confirms that Eric Jarl gathered auxiliaries in Sweden: &quot;The belligerent jarl / gathered much manpower / in Svithiod, the chief went / southward to the battle.&quot; Olaf Tryggvason was attacked by the allied fleets in the Battle of Svolder, the location of which is uncertain. It may have been either in Øresund or Pomerania. Olaf Tryggvason disappeared during the battle and Norway was appropriated by the allied lords. The bulk of the conquests went to Sweyn Forkbeard while Olof gained a part of Trøndelag as well as modern Bohuslän. These lands were placed under Sven Jarl, son-in-law of the king.

===Norwegian-Swedish War===
When the Norwegian kingdom was reestablished by Olaf II of Norway (Olaf the Saint) in 1015, a new war erupted between Norway and Sweden. There is a circumstantial account of this in Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s work. As he writes, many men in both Sweden and Norway tried to reconcile the kings. In 1018, Olof&#x27;s cousin, the earl of Västergötland, Ragnvald Ulfsson and the Norwegian king&#x27;s emissaries Björn Stallare and Hjalti Skeggiason had arrived at the thing of Uppsala in an attempt to sway the Swedish king to accept peace and as a warrant marry his daughter Ingegerd Olofsdotter to the king of Norway. The Swedish king was greatly angered and threatened to banish Ragnvald from his kingdom, but Ragnvald was supported by his foster-father Thorgny the Lawspeaker.

Thorgny delivered a powerful speech in which he reminded the king of the great Viking expeditions in the East that predecessors such as Erik Anundsson and Björn had undertaken, without having the hubris not to listen to their men&#x27;s advice. Thorgny himself had taken part in many successful pillaging expeditions with Olof&#x27;s father Eric the Victorious and even Eric had listened to his men. The present king wanted nothing but Norway, which no Swedish king before him had desired. This displeased the Swedish people, who were eager to follow the king on new ventures in the East to win back the kingdoms that paid tribute to his ancestors, but it was the wish of the people that the king make peace with the king of Norway and give him his daughter Ingegerd as queen.

Thorgny finished his speech by saying: &quot;if you do not desire to do so, we shall assault you and kill you and not brook any more of your warmongering and obstinacy. Our ancestors have done so, who at Mula thing threw five kings in a well, kings who were too arrogant as you are against us.&quot; Upon hearing this, King Olof complied with the demands of the peasantry for the time being.

However, far from keeping his promise Olof married his daughter Ingegerd to Yaroslav I the Wise instead. When Olaf of Norway heard about the arrangement he was furious and intent on attacking Olof Skötkonung. However, the Geatish jarl Ragnvald Ulfsson, colluding with Olaf II&#x27;s skald Sigvat Thordarson, managed to avert the impending war. Olof&#x27;s other daughter Astrid stayed with Ragnvald at the time, and it was agreed that she would take Ingegerd&#x27;s place. Unbeknownst to Olof, she traveled to Norway and married Olaf II. That happened c. 1019. Olof Skötkonung was highly upset, but soon ran into trouble at home. Both the Swedes and Geats were displeased with the self-willed rule of the king. The lawspeaker of Västergötland, Emund, traveled to Gamla Uppsala and spoke to Olof&#x27;s councilors, and a settlement was made. Olof agreed to share his power with his son Anund Jacob who was 10 or 12 years at the time. Olof was also forced to accept a settlement with Olaf II of Norway at Kungahälla. The veracity of Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s account of Olof Skötkonung, written more than two centuries later, is difficult to assess; however, he quotes several probably genuine scaldic verses which allude to some of the related events.

One result of the hostilities between Olof Skötkonung and Olaf of Norway was, according to Snorri Sturluson, that the people of Jämtland and Hälsingland came under the Swedish rather than Norwegian king. Previously the Jämtlanders and part of the Hälsinglanders had adhered to Norway since the days of Hakon the Good. The veracity of this is not known, but the medieval provincial laws of Jämtland show Swedish influences, and there are indications that Christianity arrived from Central Sweden in the 11th century. Jämtland reverted to the Norwegian king in 1111, while Hälsingland was henceforth under Sweden.

===Diplomacy===
Olof&#x27;s ally Sweyn Forkbeard occupied England in 1013, but died shortly afterwards, and the Anglo-Saxon ruler Æthelred the Unready was able to return. According to Adam of Bremen, &quot;the son of the king, Cnut, returned home with the army and prepared a new war against the English. Olav [II], whom the Norwegians had chosen as their commander, now separated from the Danish kingdom. Cnut, who felt threatened from two directions, then entered an alliance with his brother Olof Eriksson who ruled in Sweden, and planned to take power in England, and then in Norway, with his assistance. Equipped with a thousand large ships, Cnut thus traversed the British Sea&quot;. From Swedish rune stones it also appears that many people joined the Danish Viking expeditions of the early 11th century. After Cnut the Great became King of England in 1016, he sent the two sons of the deceased King Edmund Ironside to Olof (who was either Canute&#x27;s half-brother or stepbrother), supposedly with instructions to have the children murdered. Instead of having them killed, the two boys were secretly sent either to Kiev, where Olof&#x27;s daughter Ingigerd was the Queen, or to Poland, where Canute&#x27;s uncle Bolesław I Chrobry was duke.

===Christian King===
Included in the Westrogothic law from c. 1240 is the first brief Swedish chronicle, which begins with Olof Skötkonung. It relates that Olof was baptized in Husaby in Västergötland by the missionary Sigfrid, and made generous donations on spot. At Husaby parish church, there is a sign commemorating his baptism; nearby is a well thought to be the same sacred spring where Olof was baptized.

He was the first Swedish king to remain a Christian until his death. However, the circumstances about his baptism are not clear. A document from 1008 says that a certain bishop, dispatched by Archbishop Bruno of Querfurt, visited the Suigi tribe and managed to baptize the king, whose queen was already Christian. One thousand people and seven communities followed his example. The Suigi have sometimes been identified as the Swedes, though this has been rejected by several other scholars. On the other hand, Olof&#x27;s coinage (see below) indicates that he was a Christian already at the time of his accession in c. 995.

According to Adam of Bremen, Olof planned to tear down the Uppsala temple, which was allegedly an important cult centre. The fact that a large part of the Swedes were still pagan forced him to abandon this aim. The pagans made an agreement with Olof to the effect that he, if he wished to be a Christian, must exercise his royal authority in a province of his choice. If he founded a church, he was not supposed to force anyone to convert. Olof was content with this and installed a bishopric in the province of Västergötland, closer to Denmark and Norway. On the wishes of Olof, the Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen anointed Thurgot as the first Bishop in Skara. This Thurgot was successful in disseminating Christianity among the West Geats and east Geats.

The legend of St. Sigfrid, known since the 13th century, relates that the still pagan Olof called in the English Archbishop of York, Sigfrid, to teach the new faith in his realm. On his way, Sigfrid and his three nephews came to Värend in southern Småland where the twelve local tribes endorsed Christianity at a Thing. Sigfrid left his nephews to tend matters in Värend and proceeded to Olof&#x27;s court where the king and his family were baptised. Meanwhile, a heathen reaction in Värend cost the lives of the nephews, whose heads were sunk in the Växjö Lake. Hearing about this, Sigfrid returned to Värend where the heads were discovered through a miracle. King Olof then appeared in Värend with a force, punished the murderers, and forced the locals to yield properties to the Church. Whether the legend reflects the expansion of Olof&#x27;s realm to the south is unsure. The account seems to incorporate various elements in order to legitimise the establishment of the Bishopric of Växjö in c. 1170. It is nevertheless known from Adam of Bremen that an English missionary called Sigfrid preached among the Swedes and Geats in the first half of the 11th century.

==Coinage and extent of the realm==

Olof Skötkonung is the first king in Sweden known to have minted coins, of which a few hundred are extant and serve as contemporary source material about his reign. His son and successor Anund Jacob also minted coins, but after him the practice stopped, and the next coins minted in Sweden are by Knut Eriksson in late 12th century. 

When he stamped coins in Sigtuna in the province of Uppland Olof used the word &quot;rex&quot; for &quot;king&quot;&quot;OLUF REX&quot; as in the coin displayed above or &quot;OLAF REX&quot;. The use of Latin seems to suggest that he was already baptised at this time but on the other hand the coins were imitating English pennies in type and style. Sigtuna is written &quot;SITUN&quot;, &quot;ZINT&quot; (in the coin above), &quot;ZTNETEI&quot;, or &quot;SIDEI&quot;. The two last have been deciphered as &quot;Si(gtuna) Dei&quot; meaning &quot;God&#x27;s Sigtuna&quot;. The earliest of Olof&#x27;s coins merely depict him as &quot;King in Sigtuna&quot;, while the later ones have &quot;King of the Swedes&quot;. 

It has been suggested that this change in nomenclature relates to a widening of Olof&#x27;s base of power around 1000. Sigtuna may be understood as the area in Uppland ruled from the town of this name, while rulership over the Swedes may indicate a more extensive realm. Contemporary scaldic poetry indicates Olof as the ruler of the Swedes as well as the Geats (Götar), and the same goes for the account of Adam of Bremen. The exact nature of the relation between the Swedes and Geats, and the process by which a unified kingdom was created, has been intensively debated. While the unification has traditionally been thought to depart from the provinces around lake Mälaren some scholars hold that the Geatic provinces were leading the process, and that the construction of a Swedish kingdom was a long process that was only concluded in the 13th century.

== &quot;Yngvars saga víðförla&quot; ==
According to &quot;Yngvars saga víðförla&quot; (Ingvar&#x27;s saga) the Semigallians are also described as a tributary of Sweden and Olof. That the people of Semigallia paid taxes to Sweden and Olof. But that due to rebellion payment had ceased. Olof sent a Swedish force led by Ingvar and subdued the rebellious Semigallian chieftains in war.
According to Snorri Sturlasson, several countries in the East paid tribute to the Swedes. In the Olaf saga Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and all the countries longer inland paid tribute to Sweden as tributaries or client state. Several of these client states in the Baltic rose up after the regular Swedish military expedition in the Baltics stopped due to the war with Norway. Which could be connected to the uprising of the Semigallians in the Ingvars saga. Whatever dominion or tributary system Sweden had in the east Olaf seem to have lost due to uprisings. In the early 11 century whatever dominion the Swedish king seemed to have had over Aldeigjuborg seemed to have been lost. Even though Olaf received Aldeigjuborg as a dowry by Yaroslav. Several attempts were made to reclaim Swedish glory in the east receiving Aldegjuborg might have been one of those Swedish efforts. Aldeigjuborg in current Sankt Petersburg seem to have burned in 870s. Which coincides with a much larger presence of Swedish goods all over eastern Europe. The grains cultivated in Sankt Petersburg have the same DNA structure as Swedish grain in Birka indicating a strong Swedish presence in Western Russia. In the 10 century Swedish presence is found in all of Russia and Ukraine. In the late 10 century Aldeigjuborg seemed to have been burned again and the Swedish presence removed as described by Heimskringla indicating that the Slavic and Finnic peoples under Swedish control had rebelled.

==Óláfsdrápa sænska==
The Icelandic skald Óttarr svarti spent some time at Olof&#x27;s court and composed the poem &quot;Óláfsdrápa sænska&quot; describing Olof&#x27;s war expeditions in the east. The poem is interesting, since it gives a view of the reign of Olof: &quot;The warrior guards his land, few kings are as mighty as him; Olof pleases the eagle, the Swedish king is outstanding&quot;. Other skalds who served Olof were Gunnlaugr ormstunga, Hrafn Önundarson and Gizurr svarti.

==Death==

Judging from Snorri Sturluson&#x27;s chronology of events, Olof died a natural death in the winter of 1021–1022. Adam of Bremen asserts that he died at approximately the same time as Cnut the Great (1035), which is certainly too late.

Claims that he was martyred after refusing to sacrifice to pagan gods are likely due to a mix-up with the king Olof from &quot;Vita Ansgari&quot; and Olof Trätälja from Norse sources.

Since the 1740s, it has been claimed that he was buried in Husaby in the Christian part of his kingdom, but such identifications are controversial.

==Family==

Olof was the son of Eric the Victorious (Erik Segersäll) and a woman whose identity is debated. According to Adam of Bremen she was the sister or daughter of Boleslaw I Chrobry of Poland, but, according to Icelandic sources, she was Sigrid the Haughty (Sigrid Storråda), a daughter of the Viking chief Skoglar Toste. Certain sources say that Olof had a brother called Emunde.

With his mistress Edla, daughter of a Slavic chief, he first had three children:
* Emund the Old, King of Sweden in c. 1050–1060
* Astrid, d. after 1035, married to Olaf II of Norway (Olaf the Saint)
* Holmfrid (possibly sister of Olof), married to Sven Jarl of Norway

With his spouse Queen Estrid he had two children:
* Anund Jacob, King of Sweden in 1022–c. 1050
* Ingegerd, d. 1050, married to Yaroslav the Wise

<text>The Eurasian wryneck or northern wryneck (Jynx torquilla) is a species of wryneck in the woodpecker family. They mainly breed in temperate regions of Europe and Asia. Most populations are migratory, wintering in tropical Africa and in southern Asia from Iran to the Indian subcontinent, but some are resident in northwestern Africa. It is a bird of open countryside, woodland and orchards.

Eurasian wrynecks measure about in length and have bills shorter and less dagger-like than those of other woodpeckers. Their upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. Their underparts are cream speckled and spotted with brown. Their chief prey is ants and other insects, which they find in decaying wood or on the ground. The eggs are white as is the case with many birds that nest in holes and a clutch of seven to ten eggs is laid during May and June.

These birds get their English name from their ability to turn their heads through almost 180 degrees. When disturbed at the nest, they use this snake-like head twisting and hissing as a threat display. This odd behaviour led to their use in witchcraft, hence to put a &quot;jinx&quot; on someone.

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The Eurasian wryneck was first described by Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; in 1758. The type species came from Sweden.

The genus name &quot;Jynx&quot; is from the Ancient Greek name for this bird, &quot;iunx&quot;. The specific &quot;torquilla&quot; is Medieval Latin derived from &quot;torquere&quot;, to twist, referring to the strange snake-head movements. The bird was used as a charm to bring back an errant lover, the bird being tied to a piece of string and whirled around. The English &quot;wryneck&quot; refers to the same twisting movement and was first recorded in 1585.

The family Picidae has four subfamilies, the Picinae (woodpeckers), the Picumninae (piculets), the Jynginae (wrynecks) and the monotypic Nesoctitinae (Antillean piculet). Based on morphology and behaviour, the Picumninae was considered to be the sister clade of the Picinae. This has now been confirmed by phylogenetic analysis and the Jynginae are placed basal to the Picinae, Nesoctitinae and Picumninae.

Jynginae includes one genus (&quot;Jynx&quot;) and two species, the Eurasian wryneck and the red-throated wryneck (&quot;Jynx ruficollis&quot;), resident in sub-Saharan Africa. There are six subspecies of &quot;Jynx torquilla&quot;:

* &quot;Jynx torquilla chinensis&quot; Hesse, 1911
* &quot;Jynx torquilla himalayana&quot; Vaurie, 1959
* &quot;Jynx torquilla mauretanica&quot; Rothschild, 1909
* &quot;Jynx torquilla sarudnyi&quot; Loudon, 1912
* &quot;Jynx torquilla torquilla&quot; Linnaeus, 1758
* &quot;Jynx torquilla tschusii&quot; O. Kleinschmidt, 1907

==Description==

The Eurasian wryneck grows to about in length. The subspecies &quot;Jynx torquilla tschusii&quot; weighs . It is a slim, elongated-looking bird with a body shape more like a thrush than a woodpecker. The upperparts are barred and mottled in shades of pale brown with rufous and blackish bars and wider black streaks. The rump and upper tail coverts are grey with speckles and irregular bands of brown. The rounded tail is grey, speckled with brown, with faint bands of greyish-brown and a few more clearly defined bands of brownish-black. The cheeks and throat are buff barred with brown. The underparts are creamy white with brown markings shaped like arrow-heads which are reduced to spots on the lower breast and belly. The flanks are buff with similar markings and the under-tail coverts are buff with narrow brown bars. The primaries and secondaries are brown with rufous-buff markings. The beak is brown, long and slender with a broad base and sharp tip. The irises are hazel and the slender legs and feet are pale brown. The first and second toes are shorter than the others. The first and fourth toes point backwards and the second and third point forwards, a good arrangement for clinging to vertical surfaces. The juvenile has a livery much similar to the adults but with a milder and less distinct coloration.

The call of the Eurasian wryneck is a series of repeated harsh, shrill notes &quot;quee-quee-quee-quee&quot; lasting for several seconds and is reminiscent of the voice of the lesser spotted woodpecker. Its alarm call is a short series of staccato &quot;tuck&quot;s and when disturbed on the nest it hisses.

==Distribution and habitat==

The Eurasian wryneck has a palearctic distribution. The breeding range of the nominate subspecies includes all of Europe to the Urals, except the British Isles, where it was extirpated in the 20th century, and Iceland. In the north it reaches the Arctic Circle and the range includes Spain in the southwest. In the south and east it intergrades with &quot;J. t. tschusii&quot; (smaller and more reddish brown) which is found in Corsica, Italy, Dalmatia and parts of the Balkans. &quot;J. t. mauretanica&quot; (also smaller than the nominate form, light, with whitish throat and breast) is resident in Algeria and Morocco and possibly also the Balearic Islands, Sardinia and parts of Sicily. &quot;J. t. sarudnyi&quot; (considerably paler than the nominate with fainter markings) occurs in the Urals and then in a wide strip of Asia through southern Siberia, Central Asia, including the north-western Himalayas to the Pacific coast. &quot;J. t. chinensis&quot; breeds in eastern Siberia and northeastern and central China while &quot;J. t. himalayana&quot; breeds in Pakistan and the northwestern Himalayas. Eurasian wrynecks also inhabit the island of Sakhalin, Japan and the coastal areas of southern China.

The Eurasian wryneck is the only European woodpecker to undertake long-distance migrations. The wintering area of European species is located south of the Sahara, in a wide strip across Africa extending from Senegal, Gambia and Sierra Leone in the west to Ethiopia in the east. Its southern limit extends to the Democratic Republic of Congo and Cameroon. The populations from West Asia use the same wintering areas. The Central and East Asian breeding birds winter in the Indian subcontinent or southern East Asia including southern Japan.

During the summer the bird is found in open countryside, parkland, gardens, orchards, heaths and hedgerows, especially where there are some old trees. It may also inhabit deciduous woodland and in Scandinavia it also occurs in coniferous forests.

==Behaviour==
The Eurasian wryneck sometimes forms small groups during migration and in its winter quarters but in the summer is usually found in pairs. It characteristically holds its head high with its beak pointing slightly upwards. A mutual display that occurs at any time of year involves two birds perched facing each other with their heads far back and beaks wide open, bobbing their heads up and down. Sometimes the head is allowed to slump sideways and hang limply. On other occasions, when excited, the head is shaken and twisted about violently. When disturbed on the nest or held in the hand, the neck contorts and twists in all directions. The bird sometimes feigns death and hangs limply with eyes closed.

On returning to the breeding area after migration, the birds set up territories. On farmland in Switzerland it has been found that old pear orchards with large numbers of ant nests are preferentially selected over other habitats. Areas used for vegetable cultivation provided useful habitat when they include areas of bare ground on which the birds can forage. Territories are not chosen at random as arriving birds favoured certain areas over others with the same territories being colonised first year after year. The presence of other Eurasian wrynecks in the vicinity is also a positive influence. Orchards in general, and older ones in particular, provide favoured territories, probably because the dense foliage is more likely to support high numbers of aphids and the ground beneath has scant vegetation cover, both of which factors increase the availability of ants, the birds&#x27; main prey. Despite some territories being consistently chosen over others, reproductive success in these territories was no higher than in others. Limiting factors for such crevice-nesting species as Eurasian wrynecks are both the availability of nesting sites and the number of ants and their ease of discovery. Modern farming practices such as the removal of hedges, forest patches and isolated trees and the increasing use of fertilisers and pesticides are disadvantageous to such birds.

The diet of the Eurasian wryneck consists chiefly of ants but beetles and their larvae, moths, spiders and woodlice are also eaten. Although much time is spent in the upper branches of trees, the bird sometimes perches in low bushes and mostly forages on the ground, moving around with short hops with its tail held in a raised position. It can cling to tree trunks, often moving obliquely, and sometimes pressing its tail against the surface as a prop. It does not make holes in bark with its beak but picks up prey with a rapid extension and retraction of its tongue and it sometimes catches insects while on the wing. Its flight is rather slow and undulating.

==Breeding==

The nesting site is variable and may be in a pre-existing hole in a tree trunk, a crevice in a wall, a hole in a bank, a sand martin&#x27;s burrow or a nesting box. In its search for a safe, protected site out of reach of predators, it sometimes evicts a previous occupant, its eggs and nestlings. It uses no nesting material, and a clutch of normally seven to ten eggs is laid (occasionally five, six, eleven or twelve). The eggs average and weigh about . They are a dull white colour and partially opaque. Both sexes are involved in incubation, which takes twelve days, but the female plays the greater part. Both parents feed the chicks for about twenty days before they fledge. There is usually a single brood.

==Status==
The International Union for Conservation of Nature lists the Eurasian wryneck as being of &quot;least concern&quot; in its Red List of Threatened Species. This is because it has a world population estimated at up to fifteen million individual birds and a very wide geographical range. The population may be decreasing to a certain extent but not at such a rate as to make the bird reach the threshold for a more threatened category. In continental Europe, the largest populations are in Spain, Italy, Germany, Poland, Romania, Hungary, Belarus and Ukraine, and only in Romania is the population trend believed to be upward. In Russia, where there are believed to be 300,000 to 800,000 individuals, the population trend is unknown. In the United Kingdom the numbers of bird are on the decrease and it is protected under Schedule 1 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and is listed on Appendix II of the Bern Convention. It is protected as a migratory species under the Birds Directive in the European Union. In Switzerland, the population has also been decreasing, but the species has reacted positively to conservation measures such as the addition of nestboxes in suitable habitats.

<text>The red-throated wryneck (Jynx ruficollis), also known as the rufous-necked wryneck or red-breasted wryneck, is a species of wryneck in the woodpecker family closely related to the Eurasian wryneck. Its three subspecies are resident in much of sub-Saharan Africa in open habitats with some trees. It is a slim, elongated bird about in length, with a small head, fine bill, long fan-shaped tail and cryptic plumage intricately patterned in greys and browns. The sexes look similar, although males are slightly larger. The diet of the adults and young is almost entirely ants at all stages of their life cycles. The call of the red-throated wryneck is a series of repeated harsh, shrill notes. When threatened, a bird will twist its neck and head in a snake-like manner while making a hissing sound, presumably to deter predators.

The red-throated wryneck nests in pre-existing holes, usually in trees, preferring old barbet or woodpecker nests. The unlined nest cavity is usually above the ground, and the clutch is typically three or four white eggs, laid at one-day intervals. Both sexes incubate the eggs for 12–15 days until the blind, naked chicks hatch. The chicks are fed by both adults for 25–26 days until they fledge. There are usually two broods. The red-throated wryneck has a very extensive range, and its population is large and increasing. For this reason, it is evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

==Taxonomy and etymology==
The woodpeckers are an ancient bird family consisting of three subfamilies, the wrynecks, the piculets and the true woodpeckers, Picinae. DNA sequencing and phylogenetic analysis show that the wrynecks are a sister clade to other woodpeckers including the Picinae and probably diverged early from the rest of the family.

The wryneck subfamily Jynginae has one genus, &quot;Jynx&quot;, introduced in 1758 by Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. It contains two species, the Eurasian wryneck, &quot;J. torquilla&quot;, and the red-throated wryneck, &quot;J. ruficollis&quot;. The two wrynecks form a superspecies that probably separated early in their evolution from the piculets, although there has subsequently been only limited divergence between the &quot;Jynx&quot; species.

The red-throated wryneck was first identified by German ornithologist Johann Georg Wagler in 1830. It is also known as the rufous-necked wryneck or red-breasted wryneck.
The genus name &quot;Jynx&quot; is from the Ancient Greek name for the Eurasian wryneck, &quot;ιυγξ&quot;, &quot;iunx&quot;, and &quot;ruficollis&quot; is from the Latin , &quot;rufous&quot; and &quot;neck&quot;. The English &quot;wryneck&quot; refers to the habit of birds in this genus of twisting and writhing their necks when agitated. It was first recorded in 1585.

The red-throated wryneck has three subspecies:
* Jynx ruficollis ruficollis (Wagler, 1830), the nominate subspecies found in southeastern Gabon, southwest to eastern Uganda, southwestern Kenya, northern Tanzania, northern Angola, northwestern Zambia, Mozambique, Eswatini and eastern South Africa.
* J. r. aequatorialis (Ruppell, 1842), the highlands of Ethiopia. Also known as the Ethiopian wryneck.
* J. r. pulchricollis (Hartlaub, 1884), in Nigeria, Cameroon, South Sudan and northwestern Uganda. Also known as the bar-throated wryneck.

===Fossil record===
The woodpecker family appears to have diverged from other Piciformes about fifty million years ago, and a 2017 study considered that the split between &quot;Jynx&quot; and other woodpeckers occurred about 22.5million years ago. A fossil dating from the early Miocene, more than twenty million years ago, consisting of the distal end of a tarsometatarsus had some ‘’Jynx’’-like features, but was classed as an early piculet. By the (Pliocene five million years ago) woodpeckers were similar to those now extant. Fossil wrynecks are known from Europe in the Pleistocene, between 2.6million and 11,700 years ago.

==Description==
The red-throated wryneck grows to about in length. The sexes are very similar in appearance, and cannot be distinguished in the field, but the male averages 2–3% larger than the female, has a shorter tail, and is heavier at against her . It is a slim, elongated bird with a small head, fine bill, long fan-shaped tail and a body shape unlike that of a typical woodpecker.

The overall impression is of cryptic plumage patterned with greys, browns and black. The upperparts and head are brown, barred and mottled in dark shades, and the rump and upper tail coverts are grey with speckles of brown and black. The chin, throat and breast of the subspecies &quot;Jynx ruficollis ruficollis&quot; are red, and the lower breast and belly are white with some dark streaks; there is a cinnamon tint to the flanks and the underneath of the tail. The wings are brown above and more buff-toned below. The grey bill is long and thin, the irides are chestnut, and the legs are grey. As with all woodpeckers, the first and fourth toes point backwards and the second and third point forwards, a good arrangement for clinging to vertical surfaces. Young birds resemble adults after 20 days, but are darker and more barred above, and lightly barred below with a smaller and darker red patch.

The three subspecies differ in appearance, mainly in the extent of red on the breast. In &quot;Jynx ruficollis ruficollis&quot; the red extends from the chin to the chest, whereas in &quot;J. r. aequatorialis&quot; it extends further down the breast, and there is a more cinnamon tinge to the flanks. &quot;J. r. pulchricollis&quot; has a brown-barred white chin and upper throat, and its red patch is darker and confined to its lower throat and upper breast. This race also has more rufous upperparts.

The two wrynecks cannot be confused with any other species, but some Eurasian birds may winter within the range of red-throated wryneck. The African species, compared to its migratory cousin, differs in its usually obvious red throat, larger size, overall browner appearance and the lack of a dark streak through the eye.

===Moult===
Most woodpeckers have only one moult as soon as breeding has finished, but wrynecks have a partial moult prior to breeding, and also replace their tail feathers in a different sequence from true woodpeckers since they have no need to retain central tail feathers for support, as is required by their arboreal relatives. Details of the moult can be complex and variable, and ageing wrynecks from their plumage appearance can be challenging.

===Vocalisations===
The call of the red-throated wryneck is a series of repeated harsh, shrill notes &quot;kweek-kwik-kwee-quee&quot;, usually slower than the call of the Eurasian wryneck. It is a far-carrying territorial call given from a prominent perch. There is also a &quot;peegh&quot; alarm call followed by a repeated harsh &quot;krok&quot;. Young in the nest make wheezing squeaks initially, later a repeated buzzing &quot;tsch&quot;. There is a quiet &quot;click&quot; call given as an alarm or pre-roosting. All calls are given by both sexes, but the male&#x27;s &quot;kweek&quot; call is lower pitched than that of the female.

Wrynecks do not drum like woodpeckers, but may tap near the nest hole or on branches, apparently as a displaced aggression activity during interactions between two birds.

==Distribution and habitat==
The rufous-necked wryneck has a distribution confined to sub-Saharan Africa. It occurs in about 20 countries in disjunct areas ranging from Nigeria, Cameroon, Central African Republic and Ethiopia in the north down to South Africa and Eswatini in the south. It is not truly migratory, although there may be local movements and post-breeding dispersal. It is a vagrant to Sudan, South Sudan and Zimbabwe, and an occasional non-breeding visitor to Lesotho.

The typical habitat is open grassland with trees, particularly acacia and also miombo woodlands, but it is also found in other semi-open woodland, such as forest edges and clearing. It will use man-made habitats such as farmland, parks and gardens as long as there are trees present, which can include introduced eucalyptus and conifers.

It occurs at altitudes from to . It is found up to in South Africa and mainly between in Kenya.

==Behaviour==
The red-throated wryneck normally perches upright on a branch with its tail and wings pointing vertically down and its head pulled into its shoulders, although when it calls it raises its head and stretches its neck out. When displaying at another wryneck, it leans forward with its tail pointing vertically upright and its bill raised while it calls loudly and sways from side to side. Like its Eurasian cousin, when threatened the red-throated wryneck will twist its neck and head in a snake-like manner while making a hissing sound, presumably to deter predators.

Wrynecks fly by alternating powered flaps with glides on closed wings, giving the bouncing flight appearance typical of woodpeckers.

Pairs of wrynecks are territorial, particularly in the breeding season, one study showing territory sizes from , mean . All territories included clumps of trees. Territories are advertised throughout the year by calling from prominent perches, mainly by the male.

The red-throated wryneck feeds almost entirely on ants, their larvae, pupae and eggs, although termites and other small invertebrates are occasionally taken, prey items being gleaned with its long sticky tongue. The young are fed the same mostly ant-based diet. This wryneck is a solitary feeder, and 90% of its foraging is on the ground, probing into ant hills. When birds feed in trees, they pick prey off the vegetation but do not excavate.

==Breeding==
As with the Eurasian species, the red-throated wryneck nests in pre-existing holes, usually in trees. They do not excavate cavities themselves, but they may enlarge a hole if the wood is soft enough; no nesting material is added. Old barbet and woodpecker nests are preferred, although holes in fence posts and nest boxes are also used. The wryneck competes with other species for suitable sites, notably the crested barbet. The nest is usually above the ground, with a cavity that is typically deep, and at least from neighbouring nests. Nests may be reused in subsequent years, in one case in alternation with a pair of violet-backed starlings, and also as winter roosts.

The clutch is between one and five, usually three or four, cream-white eggs, laid at one-day intervals. They measure and weigh about . Both sexes incubate the eggs for 12–15 days until hatching. The chicks are initially pink, naked and blind, but after about eight days their eyes open, and their feathers are growing. The chicks are fed by both adults for 25–26 days until they fledge; they hiss and make snake-like head movements if intruders visit the nest. There are usually two broods, although up to four have been recorded. The young become independent about two weeks after fledging. The timing of breeding varies across Africa, nesting taking place somewhere in every month except June and July. In South Africa, 57% of nests were successful and 40% of eggs produced fledged young.

A single claim of hybridisation between the two &quot;Jynx&quot; wrynecks reported from Cameroon was subsequently considered to be an aberrant red-throated wryneck.

==Parasites and predators==
The red-throated wryneck is a host of at least two Ischnoceran lice, &quot;Penenirmus serrilimbus&quot; and &quot;Brueelia straminea&quot;, and the &quot;Leucocytozoon&quot; &quot;L. sqamatus&quot;.

The wryneck&#x27;s nests are visited by brood parasitic honeyguides, especially the lesser honeyguide. The adult honeyguide does not remove the host&#x27;s eggs or chicks, but its monitoring of active nests may attract other predators. Once it has hatched, the honeyguide nestling will kill the host chicks. Chicks may also be killed if a crested barbet pair take over a wryneck nest for their own use.

Although the two wrynecks breed or winter over much of Europe, Asia and Africa, their predators have been little studied outside the European breeding range of &quot;Jynx torquilla&quot;, where nests may be raided by snakes for eggs and young, and the main avian threat to adult wrynecks is &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks.

==Status==
The red-throated wryneck has an extremely large range, and its population is large and increasing. For this reason, it is evaluated as a species of least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. In South Africa it is locally common, and the range has expanded due to introduction of non-native trees to formerly unwooded grassland areas.

<text>Paignton ( ) is a seaside town on the coast of Tor Bay in Devon, England. Together with Torquay and Brixham it forms the borough of Torbay which was created in 1968. The Torbay area is a holiday destination known as the English Riviera. Paignton has origins as a Celtic settlement and was first mentioned in 1086. It grew as a small fishing village and a new harbour was built in 1847. A railway line was opened to passengers in 1859 creating links to Torquay and London. As its population increased, it merged with the villages of Goodrington and Preston. Paignton is around north east of Plymouth and south of Exeter.

==History==
A Roman burial was discovered in 1993 on the Hookhills estate by a householder digging a patio. At first thought to be Neolithic, it was later radiocarbon dated to be between 230 and 390 CE. The burial is of a young woman aged between 15 and 25 years. The burial included oysters and her teeth and bone reveal a diet rich in carbohydrates and proteins. Despite living near the sea marine food only accounted for 10% of her diet. The skeleton is the most complete yet found in Devon and is on display in the Torquay Museum.

Paignton is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Peintone&quot; in the ancient hundred of Kerswell. Formerly written &quot;Peynton&quot;, &quot;Payngton&quot; and &quot;Paington&quot;, the name is derived from &quot;Pæga&quot;, an Anglo-Saxon personal name, &quot;-ing&quot; meaning &quot;the people of&quot; and &quot;tun&quot; an enclosure, estate or homestead, the original Anglo-Saxon settlement. Originally, the beach was backed by low sand dunes with marshes behind on the flat land between the sea and the hills behind. The settlement grew up on the dry ground at the foot of the hills, and also as a separate hamlet in the shelter of Roundham Head, which was a fishing settlement. The first church was probably built using wood in the eighth century.

In late Saxon times, the manor was owned by Leofric, the Bishop of Exeter. Later bishops built the Bishop&#x27;s Palace adjoining the parish church, some remains of which, including the Coverdale Tower are still standing. Winner Street owes its name to a corruption of the word &quot;Wynerde&quot;, referring to vineyards or, at least to traders in wine in the medieval period. The bishops secured a charter from Edward I in 1294 giving the right to hold a weekly market and an annual fair, making Paignton a market town. The market declined following the English Reformation in the 16th century.

Paignton then remained a small fishing and farming village (noted for grapes, cabbages and cider) until the 19th century, when in 1837 the &quot;Paington Harbour Act&quot; led to the construction of a new harbour. Around the same time, the modern spelling, &quot;Paignton&quot;, first appeared. The historic part of Paignton is centred on Church Street, Winner Street and Palace Avenue which contain fine examples of Victorian architecture. Kirkham House is a late medieval stone house which is open to the public at certain times of the year. The Coverdale Tower adjacent to Paignton Parish Church is named after Bishop Miles Coverdale, who published an English translation of the Bible in 1536. Coverdale was Bishop of Exeter between 1551 and 1553 and is reputed to have lived in the tower although this is doubted by modern historians.

The railway line to Paignton was built by the Dartmouth and Torbay Railway, and opened to passengers on 2 August 1859, providing Torquay and Paignton with a link to London.

The Paignton Pudding, first made in the 13th century, is the origin of the nickname &quot;pudden eaters&quot; for the people of Paignton. The puddings were made infrequently and were of great size. When thousands turned up hoping to obtain a piece of a huge pudding that had been baked to celebrate the arrival of the railway in 1859 chaos occurred and the event became notorious. A Paignton Pudding was baked in 1995 to celebrate the 700th anniversary of the town&#x27;s market charter, and another baked in 2006 to mark the 200th anniversary of the birth of the engineer, Isambard Kingdom Brunel.

Oldway Mansion is a large house and gardens constructed in the 1870s for Isaac Merritt Singer, who had amassed a considerable fortune with his improvements to the sewing machine. The building was occupied by Torbay Council until an agreement was signed in September 2012 to develop the site into a hotel and retirement apartments. Other Singer legacies in Paignton include the Palace Hotel and the Inn on the Green, which were built as homes for Singer&#x27;s sons Washington and Mortimer.

Torquay Tramways were extended into Paignton in 1911, but the network was closed in 1934.

== Governance ==
There is only one tier of local government covering Paignton, being the unitary authority of Torbay, which covers a larger area than just Paignton, also including Brixham and Torquay. Torbay Council is based at Torquay Town Hall.
Paignton was an ancient parish. The parish included the hamlets of Goodrington and Preston, which were gradually absorbed into Paignton&#x27;s urban area as it grew. Until 1863 the parish was administered by its vestry in the same way as most rural areas. Paignton was made a local government district in 1863, governed by a local board. The local board built itself what is now the Old Town Hall, Paignton, at the corner of New Street and Totnes Road, being completed in 1870.

Local boards were reconstituted as urban district councils in 1894. In 1946, the council bought Oldway Mansion to serve as its headquarters, having outgrown the old Town Hall.

In 1968, the urban districts of Paignton and Brixham, the municipal borough of Torquay and the parish of Churston Ferrers were all abolished. A county borough called Torbay was created to cover the whole area (with some adjustments of the boundaries to neighbouring parishes at the same time). As a county borough, Torbay was administratively independent from Devon County Council. Six years later, in 1974, local government was reformed again, with Torbay becoming a non-metropolitan district and Devon County Council providing county-level services to the area again. Torbay regained its independence from the county council in 1998 when it was made a unitary authority. Torbay remains part of the ceremonial county of Devon for the purposes of lieutenancy.

Most of Paignton is in the Torbay constituency. At the 2015 general election, Kevin Foster became the Conservative MP with a majority of 3,286. He retained it with a majority of 14,283 in 2017. Some areas in the southern and western parts of the town are in the South Devon constituency. In 2015, Sarah Wollaston retained the seat for the Conservative Party with a majority of 18,385, reduced to 13,477 in 2017. Wollaston resigned from the Conservative Party in February 2019, moving between various political parties and sitting as an independent MP, before standing for the Liberal Democrats at the December 2019 general election. She was defeated by the Conservative candidate, Anthony Mangnall, with a majority of 12,724.

At the 2024 General Election, Kevin Foster was replaced by Liberal Democrat Steve Darling and Anthony Mangall by Liberal Democrat Caroline Voaden.

==Economy==
Paignton&#x27;s economy relies extensively on tourism and the town is marketed as a location for family holidays. The main seafront area is dominated by Paignton Pier, a long structure opened in 1879. It was designed by George Soudon Bridgman, the local architect who also designed the original Oldway Mansion.

The Festival Theatre, opened in 1967, was once a seafront theatre capable of staging large summer shows. In 1999 it was converted into a multiscreen cinema. The Torbay Air Show, launched in 2016, is held over the Bay in front of Paignton Sands in early June annually. The Paignton Festival (formerly known as the &quot;Torbay Carnival&quot;) is over 100 years old and is held annually in late July. It features a Carnival Procession together with various entertainments and charity stalls on The Green.

Regatta Week during early August is the peak holiday season. During this period there is a funfair on Paignton Green, along with a large fireworks display. Later in August is Children&#x27;s Week, which includes a wide range of events and competitions. Paignton has a variety of holiday accommodation, complemented by numerous pubs, nightclubs and restaurants.

Tourist attractions include Paignton Zoo and the Dartmouth Steam Railway, which operates steam trains from Paignton to Kingswear, from where a ferry can be taken across the River Dart to Dartmouth. The line was sold in 1972 without cessation of services by British Rail in the aftermath of the cutbacks of the Beeching era in the 1960s, and is operated today as a heritage railway line. The 630 mile South West Coast Path National Trail runs along the coast.

Suttons Seeds, a supplier of seeds, bulbs and horticultural products, is based in Paignton.

==Places of interest==

The Paignton Picture House (now closed) is believed to have been Europe&#x27;s oldest purpose-built cinema and was built in 1907. Seat 2 Row 2 of the circle was the favourite seat of Torquay-born crime novelist Agatha Christie, who lived in neighbouring Galmpton. The cinemas and theatres in her books are all said to be based on the Paignton Picture House. It was also used as a location for the 1984 Donald Sutherland film &quot;Ordeal by Innocence&quot; and the 1981 film &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; (which was filmed mainly at Lyme Regis in Dorset).

The Royal Bijou Theatre is now demolished, but a blue plaque marking its former location can be found next to the Thomas Cook travel agency in Hyde Road. The theatre was the venue for the premiere of &quot;The Pirates of Penzance&quot; by Gilbert and Sullivan on 30 December 1879. The performance was given at short notice to secure the British copyright on the work after problems had arisen with unauthorised performances of &quot;HMS Pinafore&quot; in the USA. The Palace Theatre in Palace Avenue has been the main theatre in the town since the conversion of the Festival Theatre to a cinema in 1998.

The department store Rossiters was a centrepiece of the town until its closure in January 2009. The store is said to have been the inspiration for the sitcom &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; In 2010, it reopened as a discount store.

From 1889 to 1897 the mathematician Oliver Heaviside lived in Palace Avenue, in the building now occupied by Barclays Bank. A commemorative blue plaque can be seen on the wall. Heaviside is buried in Paignton Cemetery.

==Beaches==

Paignton beach and the nearby Preston Sands, which are continuous at low tide, are used for water sports including kite surfing and dinghy sailing. Both are sandy and gently shelving and have no strong currents, making them popular with swimmers and families. Both have green spaces immediately inland. Paignton Green has a pirate-themed Adventure Golf course and the Paignton Geoplay Park, a children&#x27;s play area, which has the area&#x27;s geology as its theme, inspired by the UNESCO Global Geopark of which Paignton is a part. Immediately to the east of Paignton Harbour is Fairy Cove, which has no facilities, but features good exposures of the Torbay Breccia, a red sandstone with pieces of rock which washed into it when the area was a desert. Also within the former Urban District of Paignton lies Goodrington which has another popular beach backed by Young&#x27;s Park, with its boating lake, and a large outdoor waterpark, Splashdown Quaywest. Beyond Goodrington are Waterside and Saltern Coves, which have no facilities and are accessed through fields, followed by Broadsands, on the Brixham border.
The reed beds found behind Broadsands beach are a haunt of the rare cirl bunting. Hollicombe beach, situated at Paignton&#x27;s northern boundary with Torquay, features a geological stratotype at its northern end, known as the &quot;Corbyn&#x27;s Head Member&quot; Elberry Cove is used by jetski enthusiasts, while Saltern Cove is a Site of Special Scientific Interest due to its distinctive geology and its marine biology.

==Transport==
===Railway===
Paignton railway station is situated close to the town centre and is a short walk from the beach along Torbay Road. Train services are provided mainly by Great Western Railway; these consist of approximately half-hourly services to Torquay, Newton Abbot, Exeter and Exmouth along the Riviera Line, with some longer distance services to Taunton, Bristol, Cardiff and London Paddington. CrossCountry provides two services per day currently to Manchester Piccadilly station via Bristol.

====Heritage====
Queen&#x27;s Park station, for services on the Dartmouth Steam Railway, is adjacent to the main railway station on the beachside of the level crossing. A service of steam trains is provided from February to December, although it is daily only between April and October.

The other railway station in Paignton is Goodrington Sands (opened in 1928), which is now part of the Dartmouth Steam Railway.

===Buses and coaches===
The bus and coach station faces the main entrance to the railway station. Bus services are provided by Stagecoach South West, Torbay Minibuses, Country Bus (Newton Abbot) and the Dartmouth Steam Railway &amp; Riverboat Company. Principal services lead to Totnes and Plymouth; Torquay and Newton Abbot; Torquay, Teignmouth and Dawlish Warren; Brixham; and Kingswear, for the ferry to Dartmouth. A range of long-distance coach services is operated by National Express.

===Ferries===
Ferry services are provided seasonally by Paignton Pleasure Cruises and We Ferry to Torquay and Brixham from Paignton Harbour.

<text>&quot;War Pigs&quot; is an anti-war protest song by English heavy metal band Black Sabbath, released in 1970. It is the opening track from the band&#x27;s second studio album &quot;Paranoid&quot; (1970).

==Overview==
The original title of &quot;War Pigs&quot; was &quot;Walpurgis&quot;, dealing with the witches&#x27; sabbath. &quot;Walpurgis is sort of like Christmas for Satanists. And to me, war was the big Satan&quot;, said bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler. &quot;It wasn&#x27;t about politics or government or anything. It was Evil itself. So I was saying &#x27;generals gathered in the masses / just like witches at black masses&#x27; to make an analogy. But when we brought it to the record company, they thought &#x27;Walpurgis&#x27; sounded too Satanic. And that&#x27;s when we turned it into &#x27;War Pigs&#x27;. But we didn&#x27;t change the lyrics, because they were already finished.&quot;

During this time period, national service had recently ended in the United Kingdom but with the Vietnam War still ongoing, many young men feared they&#x27;d be conscripted to fight in it. &quot;That&#x27;s what started this whole rebellion thing about not going to war for anybody&quot;, said Butler. &quot;I was dreading being called up&quot;, the lyricist recalled.

Prior to its official release, the band often altered the lyrics significantly when performing it live. An example of this can be found on Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s compilation &quot;The Ozzman Cometh&quot;, which features an early version recorded by Black Sabbath for BBC Radio 1 on 26 April 1970. While Butler has said that &quot;War Pigs&quot; is &quot;totally against the Vietnam War, about how these rich politicians and rich people start all the wars for their benefit and get all the poor people to die for them&quot;, vocalist Osbourne has stated that the group &quot;knew nothing about Vietnam. It&#x27;s just an anti-war song.&quot; The song&#x27;s instrumental outro is entitled &quot;Luke&#x27;s Wall&quot; on US releases of the album, formatted as &quot;War Pigs/Luke&#x27;s Wall&quot;.

Drummer Bill Ward&#x27;s first memory of performing the song was at The Beat Club in Switzerland in 1968. The band was required to play multiple sets every night and had little material in their repertoire at that point, so they would perform lengthy jam sessions to fill in the sets. Co-writer and lead guitarist Tony Iommi has said that &quot;War Pigs&quot; originated from one of those jam sessions.

The addition of the air-raid siren and the speeding up of the song&#x27;s end were done by producer Rodger Bain and engineer Tom Allom. The band had no input in these decisions, though they were pleased with the results.

==Legacy==
Music journalist Martin Popoff has called the song an &quot;ugly, antiwar classic now considered one of Sabbath&#x27;s top two or three most enduring compositions&quot;. &quot;Guitar World&quot; described the song as &quot;the greatest HM song ever.&quot; The magazine also included the song on their list of the &quot;100 Greatest Guitar Solos&quot; and ranked it in 56th place. Steve Huey of AllMusic called the song a &quot;standard&quot;.

Kelefa Sanneh wrote, &quot;What is memorable is the way Osbourne evokes not merely war&#x27;s cost but its seductive appeal. Part of what made Black Sabbath seem new was a disinclination to uplifting, or hopeful, or self-righteous.&quot;

&quot;War Pigs&quot; is widely considered one of Black Sabbath&#x27;s greatest songs. In 2020, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; ranked the song number four on their list of the 20 greatest Black Sabbath songs, and in 2021, &quot;Louder Sound&quot; ranked the song number one on their list of the 40 greatest Black Sabbath songs.

&quot;War Pigs&quot; was ranked the best Black Sabbath song by .

The song is notable for its publication in the American folk music magazine &quot;Broadside&quot;, which normally did not feature rock songs.

The song&#x27;s iconic guitar riff largely inspired that of Arctic Monkeys&#x27; 2014 single &quot;Arabella&quot;, to the extent that the band often perform an interlude of the song, to enable front man Alex Turner to pick up his guitar in time for his solo. In more recent times, when performing a live rendition of Arabella, the Arctic Monkeys often end the live performance of the song with a tease of the songs riff.

&quot;War Pigs&quot; was featured in the credits of the 2014 film &quot;300: Rise of an Empire&quot;, a sequel to the 2007 film &quot;300&quot;.

&quot;War Pigs&quot; was one of the 40 songs featured in the Music Monday series of the Newseum, and thus part of the &quot;Reporting Vietnam&quot; exhibit as a major musical reflection of the time.

WWE has used the song for their NXT TakeOver: WarGames events, as well as their Survivor Series WarGames event since the 2022 edition.

Several of the University of Arkansas&#x27; sports teams, nicknamed the Razorbacks, use &quot;War Pigs&quot; as their run-out/tunnel walk music. The song is also part of the regular repertoire of the Razorback Marching Band.

In 2023, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song number five on their list of the 100 greatest heavy metal songs.

Judas Priest has used &quot;War Pigs&quot; as their walk on music since late 2011.

==Personnel==

* Ozzy Osbourne – vocals
* Tony Iommi – guitar
* Geezer Butler – bass
* Bill Ward – drums

== Covers ==
Faith No More released a cover of the song on their 1989 album &quot;The Real Thing&quot; (non-vinyl bonus number). On 9 November 1990, Ozzy Osbourne performed the song together with Faith No More and James Hetfield of Metallica on guitar at the Hollywood Palladium. The song was also covered by different other artists.

T-Pain covered the song on his 2023 album &quot;On Top of the Covers&quot;. Geezer Butler approved of the song and Ozzy Osbourne described it as &quot;the best cover of &#x27;War Pigs&#x27; ever&quot;.

<text>Benjamin Burwell Johnston Jr. (March 15, 1926 – July 21, 2019) was an American contemporary music composer, known for his use of just intonation. He was called &quot;one of the foremost composers of microtonal music&quot; by Philip Bush and &quot;one of the best non-famous composers this country has to offer&quot; by John Rockwell.

== Biography ==
Johnston was born in Macon, Georgia, and taught composition and theory at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign from 1951 to 1986, before retiring to North Carolina. During his time teaching, he was in contact with avant-garde figures such as John Cage, La Monte Young, and Iannis Xenakis. Johnston&#x27;s students included Stuart Saunders Smith, Neely Bruce, Thomas Albert, Michael Pisaro, Manfred Stahnke, and Kyle Gann. He also considered his practice of just intonation to have influenced other composers, including Larry Polansky. In 1946 he married dance band singer Dorothy Haines, but they soon divorced. In 1950 he married artist Betty Hall, who died in 2007.

Johnston began as a traditional composer of art music before working with Harry Partch. He helped the senior musician to build instruments and use them in the performance and recording of new compositions. Partch then arranged for Johnston to study with Darius Milhaud at Mills College. In 1952, Johnston met Cage, who invited him to come to New York to study with him in the summer. Though Johnston decided he did not have sufficient time to prepare for such studies, he did go to New York for several weeks and assisted, along with Earle Brown, in the production of Cage&#x27;s eight-track tape composition, &quot;Williams Mix&quot;.

Later, in 1957 and 1959, he studied with Cage, who encouraged him to follow his desires and use traditional instruments rather than electronics or newly built instruments. Unskilled in carpentry and finding electronics unreliable, Johnston struggled with how to integrate microtonality and conventional instruments for ten years. He also struggled with how to integrate microtones into his compositional language through a slow process of many stages. However, since 1960 Johnston had almost exclusively used a system of microtonal notation based on the rational intervals of just intonation, what Gann describes as a &quot;lifelong allegiance&quot; to microtonality. Johnston also studied with Burrill Phillips and Robert Palmer.

Johnston composed music for multiple productions by the E.T.C. Company of La MaMa, Wilford Leach and John Braswell&#x27;s company-in-residence at La MaMa Experimental Theatre Club in the East Village of Manhattan. His most significant work was &quot;Carmilla&quot;, which the company performed as part of their repertory throughout the 1970s. He also composed music for the company&#x27;s production of &quot;Gertrude&quot;, a musical about the life of Gertrude Stein.

His other works included the orchestral work &quot;Quintet for Groups&quot; (commissioned by the St. Louis Symphony Orchestra), &quot;Sonnets of Desolation&quot; (commissioned by the Swingle Singers), the &quot;Sonata for Microtonal Piano&quot; (1964), and the &quot;Suite for Microtonal Piano&quot; (1977). Johnston completed ten string quartets. The Kepler Quartet recorded all ten of his string quartets for New World Records, finishing in April 2016 just after the composer&#x27;s 90th birthday.

Johnston said:
He received many honors, including a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1959, a grant from the National Council on the Arts and the Humanities in 1966, two commissions from the Smithsonian Institution, and the Deems Taylor Award. In 2007, the American Academy of Arts and Letters honored Johnston for his lifetime of work. His &quot;Quintet for Groups&quot; won the SWR Sinfonieorchester prize at the 2008 Donaueschinger Musiktage.

Heidi Von Gunden wrote a monograph on the composer, and Bob Gilmore edited the composer&#x27;s complete writings, which were published as &quot;&quot;Maximum Clarity&quot; and Other Writings on Music&quot; by the University of Illinois Press. A three-part oral history covering all stages of his career is housed at the Oral History of American Music through Yale University.

Johnston died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in Deerfield, Wisconsin, on July 21, 2019.

== Music ==
He is best known for extending Harry Partch&#x27;s experiments in just intonation tuning to traditional instruments through his system of notation.

Johnston&#x27;s compositional style was eclectic. He used serial processes, folk song idioms (string quartets 4, 5, and 10), repetitive processes, traditional forms like fugue and variations, and intuitive processes. His main goal was &quot;to reestablish just intonation as a viable part of our musical tradition.&quot; According to Mark Swed, &quot;ultimately, what Johnston has done, more than any other composer with roots in the great American musical experiments of the &#x27;50s and &#x27;60s, is to translate those radical approaches to the nature of music into a music that is immediately apprehensible&quot;.

Most of Johnston&#x27;s later works use a large number of pitches, generated through just-intonation procedures. In these works he formed melodies based on an &quot;otonal&quot; eight-note just-intonation scale made from the 8th through 15th partials of the harmonic series, or its &quot;utonal&quot; inversion. He then gained new pitches by using common-tone transpositions or inversions. Many of his works also feature an expansive use of just intonation, using high prime limits. His String Quartet No. 9 uses intervals of the harmonic series as high as the 31st partial. He used &quot;potentially hundreds of pitches per octave,&quot; in a way that was &quot;radical without being avant-garde&quot;; in contrast with much twentieth-century music, he used microtones not for the creation of dissonance but in order to &quot;return […] to a kind of musical beauty,&quot; which he perceived as diminished in Western music since the adoption of equal-temperament. &quot;By the beginning of the 1980s he could say of his elaborately microtonal &quot;String Quartet no. 5&quot;... &#x27;I have no idea as to how many different pitches it used per octave&#x27;&quot;.

Johnston&#x27;s early efforts in just composition drew heavily on the accomplishments of post-Webern serialism. His 7-limit String Quartet no. 4 &quot;Amazing Grace&quot;, was commissioned by the Fine Arts Music Foundation of Chicago, and was first recorded by the Fine Arts Quartet on Nonesuch Records in 1980 (then reissued on Gasparo as GS205). His String Quartet no. 4, perhaps Johnston&#x27;s best-known composition, has also been recorded by the Kronos Quartet. The Kepler Quartet (Sharan Leventhal, Eric Segnitz, Brek Renzelman, and Karl Lavine) also recorded the piece for New World Records, as part of a complete 10-quartet series documenting Johnston&#x27;s entire cycle of string quartets. The Third Quartet was premiered as part of this series by the Concord String Quartet at Alice Tully Hall at Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts, on March 15, 1976, the composer&#x27;s fiftieth birthday.

===Staff notation===
Beginning in the 1960s, Johnston proposed an approach to notating music in just intonation (JI), redefining the understanding of conventional symbols (the seven &quot;white&quot; notes, along with the sharps and flats) and adding further accidentals, each designed to extend the notation into higher prime limits. Johnston&#x27;s method is based on a diatonic C major scale tuned in JI, in which the interval between D (9/8 above C) and A (5/3 above C) is one Syntonic comma less than a Pythagorean perfect fifth 3:2. To write a perfect fifth, Johnston introduces a pair of symbols representing this comma, + and −. Thus, a series of perfect fifths beginning with F would proceed C G D A+ E+ B+. The three conventional white notes A E B are tuned as Ptolemaic major thirds (5:4, Ptolemy&#x27;s intense diatonic scale) above F C G respectively. Johnston introduces new symbols for the septimal ( &amp; ), undecimal ( &amp; ), tridecimal ( &amp; ), and further prime extensions to create an accidental-based exact JI notation for what he has named &quot;extended just intonation&quot;.

Though &quot;this notation is not tied to any particular diapason&quot; and the ratios between pitches remain constant, most of Johnston’s works used A = 440 as the tuning note, making C 264 hertz. In Johnston’s notation a string quartet is tuned C−, G−, D−, A, E.

<text>The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia is one of the largest encyclopedic dictionaries of the English language. It was compared favorably with the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary,&quot; and frequently consulted for more factual information than would normally be the case for a dictionary.

== History ==
The &quot;Century Dictionary&quot; is based on &quot;The Imperial Dictionary of the English Language&quot;, edited by Rev. John Ogilvie (1797–1867) and published by W. G. Blackie and Co. of Scotland, 1847–1850, which in turn is an expansion of the 1841 second edition of Noah Webster&#x27;s &quot;American Dictionary&quot;. In 1882 The Century Company of New York bought the American rights to &quot;The Imperial Dictionary&quot; from Blackie and Son.

The first edition of the &quot;Century Dictionary&quot; was published from 1889 to 1891 by The Century Company, and was described as &quot;six volumes in twenty four&quot;. The first edition runs to 7,046 pages and features some 10,000 wood-engraved illustrations. It was edited by Sanskrit scholar and linguist William Dwight Whitney, with Benjamin Eli Smith&#x27;s assistance.

In 1895 a 10-volume edition was published, with the first eight volumes containing the dictionary proper, and the last two containing a biographical dictionary and a world atlas. Editions in either the 10 or 8 volume format were published in 1899, 1901, 1902, 1903 and 1904. In 1901 the title and subtitle changed slightly from &quot;The Century Dictionary; an encyclopedic lexicon of the English language&quot; to &quot;The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia; a work of universal reference in all departments of knowledge, with a new atlas of the world.&quot; Further editions were published in 1906, 1909 and 1911, this time in 12 volumes each.

After Whitney&#x27;s death in 1894, supplementary volumes were published under Smith&#x27;s supervision, including &quot;The Century Cyclopedia of Names&quot; (1894) and &quot;The Century Atlas&quot; (1897). A two-volume &quot;Supplement&quot; of new vocabulary, published in 1909, completed the dictionary. A reformatted edition, &quot;The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia,&quot; was published in 1911 in twelve quarto volumes: ten of vocabulary, plus the volume of names and the atlas. This set went through several printings, the last in 1914. The same year, the ten vocabulary volumes were published as one giant volume, about 8,500 pages in a very thin paper. The now much coveted India paper edition also appeared around this time, usually in five double volumes (rarely, in 10 single volumes) plus one additional for the Cyclopedia.

The completed dictionary contained over 500,000 entries, more than &quot;Webster&#x27;s New International&quot; or &quot;Funk and Wagnalls New Standard&quot;, the largest other dictionaries of the period. Each form of a word was treated separately, and liberal numbers of quotations and additional information were included to support the definitions. In its etymologies, Greek words were not transliterated.

Although no revised edition of the dictionary was ever again published, an abridged edition with new words and other features, &quot;The New Century Dictionary&quot; (edited by H.G. Emery and K.G. Brewster; revision editor, Catherine B. Avery,) was published by Appleton-Century-Crofts of New York in 1927, and reprinted in various forms for over thirty-five years. The &quot;New Century&quot; became the basis for the &quot;American College Dictionary&quot;, the first &quot;Random House Dictionary&quot;, in 1947. The three-volume &quot;New Century Cyclopedia of Names&quot;, an expansion of the 1894 volume, was published in 1954, edited by Clarence Barnhart.

The &quot;Century Dictionary&quot; was admired for the quality of its entries, the craftsmanship in its design, typography, and binding, and its excellent illustrations. It has been used as an information source for the makers of many later dictionaries, including editors of the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, who cited it over 2,000 times in the first edition. In 1913, a Ph.D. dissertation on &quot;American Dictionaries&quot; concluded its 14-page chapter on the &quot;Century Dictionary&quot; with the assessment that the work &quot;far surpasses anything in American lexicography&quot;.

==Typography and typesetting==

The &quot;Century Dictionary&quot; was typeset and printed by Theodore Low De Vinne, who gave it a typographic aesthetic that foreshadowed a norm of 20th century book printing. Prefigured in De Vinne&#x27;s work on the Century Magazine from its origins as &quot;Scribner&#x27;s Monthly&quot; in 1870, the printer eschewed the thin hairlines and reduced legibility of the &#x27;modern&#x27; serif typefaces that were predominantly used in the mid-eighteen-hundreds, favouring Caslon as a sturdier and more legible &#x27;old style&#x27; face instead. Due to the complexity of typesetting a large dictionary, De Vinne also devised an elaborate composition stand that gave compositors access to more than seven hundred boxes of type and special sorts within easy reach.

<text>Tropicália (), also known as tropicalismo (), was a Brazilian artistic movement that arose in the late 1960s. It was characterized by the amalgamation of Brazilian genres—notably the union of the popular and the avant-garde, as well as the melding of Brazilian tradition and foreign traditions and styles. Today, tropicália is chiefly associated with the musical faction of the movement, which merged Brazilian and African rhythms with British and American psychedelia and pop rock. The movement also included works of film, theatre, and poetry.

The term tropicália (tropicalismo) has multiple connotations in that it played on images of Brazil being that of a &quot;tropical paradise&quot;. Tropicalia was presented as a &quot;field for reflection on social history&quot;. 
The movement was begun by a group of musicians from Bahia notably Caetano Veloso, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa, Tom Zé, and the poet-lyricist Torquato Neto. Later the group moved from Salvador (the capital of Bahia) to São Paulo where they met with collaborators Os Mutantes and Rogério Duprat among others. They went on to produce the 1968 album &quot;Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis&quot;, which served as the movement&#x27;s manifesto.

Tropicália was not only an expression in analyzing and manipulating culture but also a mode of political expression. The tropicália movement came to fruition at a time when Brazil&#x27;s military dictatorship and left-wing ideas held distinct but prominent amounts of power simultaneously. The tropicalists&#x27; rejection of both sides&#x27; version of nationalism (the military&#x27;s conservative patriotism and the ineffectual bourgeois anti-imperialism) was met with criticism and harassment.

The dissolution of the movement by the early 1970s gave rise to a new wave of soloists and groups identifying as “post-tropicalist”. The movement has inspired many artists nationally and internationally. Additionally, tropicalia continues to be a main feature in the original Bahian group and their fellows’ work.

==Background==
A dominant principle of tropicália was antropofagia, a type of cultural &quot;cannibalism&quot; that encouraged the consumption of disparate influences, both temporal and geographic, as well as categorical, out of which could be created something uniquely Brazilian. It was a blurring of lines and preexisting conceptions of high and low art forms, as well as prestigious and marginalized artistic and political expressions. The idea was originally put forth by poet Oswald de Andrade in his &quot;Manifesto Antropófago&quot;, published in 1928, and was developed further by the tropicalistas in the 1960s.

While concrete poets were not an initial influence upon the group&#x27;s works, the two groups, particularly Veloso, Gil, and Augusto de Campos, would go on to share an intellectual partnership in São Paulo. This partnership would help the tropicalistas to form connections with other artists around the city, most notably Rogério Duprat.

Helio Oiticica’s 1967 work “Tropicalia” shares its name and aesthetic with the movement. The movement also utilized Carmen Miranda, a Brazilian/Portuguese international star, who in Brazil had come to be viewed as inauthentic. The use of Carmen Miranda&#x27;s image and motifs became synonymous with the movement. Veloso in particular would imitate the icons gestures and mannerisms during performances. This usage was intentionally done as a means to address the concept of &quot;authenticity&quot;. Miranda was seen as presenting a caricature of what true Brazilian-ness was by Brazilians while international audiences saw her as a representative of Brazil and its culture. This dichotomy provided the means by which the tropicalistas could address the concept of authenticity in such a fashion that it was striking to their audiences.

==Musical movement==

The 1968 album &quot;Tropicália: ou Panis et Circencis&quot; is regarded as the musical manifesto of the tropicália movement. Although it was a collaborative project, the main creative forces behind the album were Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil. The album experimented with unusual time signatures and unorthodox song structures, and also mixed tradition with innovation. Politically, the album expressed criticism of the coup d&#x27;état of 1964. Key artists of the movement include Os Mutantes, Gilberto Gil, Gal Costa and Caetano Veloso. According to Maya Jaggi, &quot;Gil was partly inspired by Jorge Ben Jor, a Rio musician on the fringes of the movement, who mixed urban samba and bossa nova with rhythm and blues, soul and funk.&quot;

The anarchistic, anti-authoritarian musical and lyrical expressions of the &quot;tropicalistas&quot; soon made them a target of censorship and repression by the military junta that ruled Brazil in this period, as did the fact some of the collective, including Veloso and Gil, also actively participated in anti-government demonstrations. The tropicalistas&#x27; passionate interest in the new wave of American and British psychedelic music of the period - most notably the work of the Beatles - also put them at odds with Marxist-influenced students on Brazil&#x27;s left, whose aesthetic agenda was strongly nationalistic, and oriented towards &#x27;traditional&#x27; Brazilian musical forms. This leftist faction vigorously rejected anything - especially tropicalismo - which they perceived as being tainted by the corrupting influences of Western capitalist popular culture. The politico-artistic tensions between leftist students and the tropicalistas reached a climax in September 1968, with Caetano Veloso&#x27;s watershed performances at the third International Song Festival, held in the auditorium of Rio&#x27;s Catholic University, where the audience not surprisingly included a large contingent of left-wing students.
Veloso had won a major song prize at the previous year&#x27;s festival, when he was backed by an Argentinian rock band, and although his unconventional performance caused some initial consternation, he managed to win over the crowd and was feted as a new star of Brazilian popular music. By late 1968, however, Veloso was fully immersed in the tropicalia experiment, and his performances, which were expressly intended as provocative art &quot;happenings&quot;, caused a near-riot. In the first round of the competition on 12 September, Veloso was initially greeted by enthusiastic applause, but the mood quickly changed when the music started. Veloso came on dressed in a bright green plastic tunic, festooned with electrical wires and necklaces strung with animal teeth, and his backing band Os Mutantes were also dressed in similarly outlandish attire. The ensemble launched into a barrage of psychedelic music, played at high volume, and Veloso further outraged the students with his overtly sexual stage movements. The crowd reacted angrily, shouting abuse at the performers and booing loudly, and their fury was only exacerbated by the surprise appearance of an American pop singer, John Dandurand, who joined Veloso on stage and grunted incoherently into the microphone.
After such a powerful negative reaction, Veloso was unsure whether to appear in the second round on 15 September, but his manager convinced him to go on, and this chaotic performance was recorded live and later released as a single. The students in the audience began hissing as soon as Veloso&#x27;s name was announced, even before he had even taken the stage. Wearing the same green costume (minus the wires and necklaces), Veloso came on with Os Mutantes amid a storm of catcalls, and the group launched into a provocative new song Veloso had written for the occasion, &quot;É Proibido Proibir&quot; (&quot;It is Forbidden to Forbid&quot;), the title of which he had taken from a photo of a Parisian protest poster, which he had seen reproduced in a local magazine. The booing and jeering was soon so loud that Veloso struggled to be heard over the din, and he again deliberately taunted the leftists with his sexualised stage actions. Within a short time the performers were being pelted with fruit, vegetables, eggs and a rain of paper balls, and a section of the audience expressed their disapproval by standing up and turning their backs to the performers, prompting Os Mutantes to respond in kind by turning their backs on the audience. Infuriated by the students&#x27; reaction, Veloso stopped singing and launched into a furious improvised monologue, haranguing the students for their behaviour and denouncing what he saw as their cultural conservatism. He was then joined by Gilberto Gil, who came on stage to show his support for Veloso, and as the tumult reached a crescendo, Veloso announced he was withdrawing from the competition, and after deliberately finishing the song out of tune, the tropicalistas defiantly walked offstage, arm-in-arm.

On December 27, 1968, Veloso and Gil were arrested and imprisoned by the military government over the political content of their work. After two months, the two were released and subsequently forced to seek exile in London, where they lived and resumed their musical careers until they were able to return to Brazil in 1972.

In 1993, Veloso and Gil released the album &quot;Tropicália 2&quot;, celebrating 25 years of the movement and commemorating their earlier musical experiments.

==Critiques==
Tropicália&#x27;s controversy can be traced to the uncertain and unfriendly relationship the members of the movement had with the mass media. The movement&#x27;s emphasis on art clashed with the media&#x27;s need for mass appeal and marketability. Tropicália additionally had an image of sensuality and flamboyance. This was a protest to the reinstated oppression of Brazil&#x27;s military rule in the 1960s, and an additional cause for media pushback. In 1968, tropicália events at clubs, music festivals, and television shows attracted media attention and aroused tension between Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil and their critics. This widespread attention attracted the attention and suspicion of the military, who feared tropicália&#x27;s influence of protest in the cultural realm.

Near the end of 1968, tropicália experienced a shift to a more overt association with international countercultures and movements, most notably that of African-American Black Power in the United States. The movement was becoming increasingly leftist, and pushed for artistic output. At a later tropicália concert in the same year, during a performance by Caetano Veloso, a riot erupted in the auditorium between tropicalists and supporters of nationalist-participant music. The nationalists were primarily college students, and the uproar culminated with screams and hurling garbage at Veloso. The nationalist-participant group&#x27;s resistance of the movement was nothing new, but this incident was the tipping point of their opposition. At the nightclub Sucata, tropicália shows became increasingly resistant to Brazil&#x27;s military-run society. Due to Veloso&#x27;s refusal to censor the shows to government wishes, the military began to monitor tropicália events. On December 27, 1968, at the peak of government repression, Caetano Veloso and Gilberto Gil were arrested, detained, and exiled to London for two and a half years.

Modern critic Roberto Schwarz addresses tropicália&#x27;s hand in solidifying the idea of the absurd as a permanent evil of Brazil, and its issues with an ideological mentality. However, the approaches of the movement were ever-shifting and did not stick to one central idea.

==Influence==
Throughout the 1940s until her death in 1955, the singer and actress Carmen Miranda made Hollywood musicals and performed live. Before first appearing on Broadway in 1939, she had a successful career in Brazil throughout the 1930s and was known as the &quot;Queen of Samba&quot;. Yet after she gained international success in the United States, many Brazilians regarded her elaborate costume and performance as a caricature of Brazilian culture. In Caetano Veloso&#x27;s 1968 song &quot;Tropicália&quot;, the musician references Carmen Miranda whose vulgar iconography were an inspiration. Caetano Veloso has said Carmen Miranda was a &quot;culturally repulsive object&quot; for his generation. Scholar Christopher Dunn says that by embracing Carmen, Veloso treats her as &quot;an allegory of Brazilian culture and its reception abroad&quot;.

Many tropicalistas have maintained a presence in Brazilian popular culture, specifically through MPB (Brazilian pop music). Gilberto Gil and Caetano Veloso are both respectively popular nationally and around the globe. Tom Zé, a tropicalista who had largely faded into obscurity at the end of the movement, saw a resurgence of critical and commercial interest in the 1990s.

Tropicalismo has been cited as an influence by rock musicians such as David Byrne, Beck, the Bird and the Bee, Arto Lindsay, Devendra Banhart, El Guincho, Of Montreal, and Nelly Furtado. In 1998, Beck released &quot;Mutations&quot;, the title of which is a tribute to Os Mutantes. Its hit single, &quot;Tropicalia&quot;, reached number 21 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock singles chart.

Tropicália has morphed not only the Brazilian music scene itself but, the way Brazilian music is viewed. Tropicália expanded what Brazilians view as properly “authentic” and since the &#x27;90s broadened the way international audiences experienced and understood Brazilian music. Tropicália created a new precedent for artistic hybridization allowing for a diversity of sounds and styles in those who were inspired by the movement. 
In 2021, scientists named a species of Brazilian tree frog, &quot;Scinax tropicalia&quot; after this movement.

==Post Tropicália==
Tropicalia introduced two very unusual movements to modern Brazil – antropofagia and . In addition to this was pop music from abroad that helped inaugurate postmodernism in Brazil. In spite of the falling-outs and violence, there is a permanence of tradition in Oswald&#x27;s antropofagia, who at one point of time conflicted with the idea of Romantic Indianism of the nineteenth century. These ideas were and still are seen in theaters and people&#x27;s notions that involved a relationship that tied back to a longer history of poetic creations.

Moreover, members of tropicalia who were not arrested or tortured, voluntarily escaped into exile in order to get away from the strict and repressing authorities. Many continuously went back and forth between different countries and cities. Some were never able to settle down. People like Caetano, Gil, and Torquato Neto, spent time in places like London, New York, or Paris. Some, but not all, were allowed to return to Brazil after years had passed. Others, still could only stay for short periods of time.

At the same time, underground magazines were expanding and this gave those who were overseas a chance to speak up about their experiences. Oiticica, for example, was one who moved to New York and published a magazine article titled, “Mario Montez, Tropicamp”. The names for the titles that were used related to the risky and systematic aims during the times of tropicalia. These magazines also told the stories of others who were in the United States and home in Brazil. By tropicalia going underground, there was a unity of the members within the group because people like Oiticica sent these writing to Brazil so that the articles could circulate locally.

In 2002, Caetano Veloso published an account of the tropicália movement, &quot;Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil&quot;. The 1999 compilation &quot;Tropicália Essentials&quot;, featuring songs by Gilberto Gil, Caetano Veloso, Gal Costa, Tom Zé, and Os Mutantes, is an introduction to the style. Other compilations include &quot;The Tropicalia Style&quot; (1996), &quot;Tropicália 30 Anos&quot; (1997), &quot;Tropicalia: Millennium&quot; (1999), &quot;Tropicalia: Gold&quot; (2002), and &quot;Novo Millennium: Tropicalia&quot; (2005). Yet another compilation, &quot;Tropicalia: A Brazilian Revolution in Sound&quot;, was released to acclaim in 2006.

A 2012 documentary film, &quot;Tropicália&quot;, was made on the subject and artists in general; directed by Brazilian filmmaker Marcelo Machado, where Fernando Meirelles served as one of its executive producers.

<doc id="255571" wikidata="Q6796657" url="?curid=255571" title="Maya (American TV series)">
<text>Maya is an American hour-long adventure television series that aired on NBC, Saturdays from 7:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m., from September 16, 1967 until February 10, 1968. The series is a follow-up to the 1966 film of the same name, with Jay North and Sajid Khan reprising their roles. Set in the Indian jungle, the series centered on an American boy searching for his missing father, a big game hunter.

==Synopsis==

The series starred teenage Jay North (famous for starring as &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; as a child) as Terry Bowen, and Indian actor Sajid Khan (also prominent in his homeland from his child-acting background) as Raji, a native boy who joined up with the lead. Raji&#x27;s elephant, Maya, gave the series its name. Maya was Terry and Raji&#x27;s source of transportation, as well as providing help when flight or rescue was needed.

In the first episode teenage Terry Bowen arrives in India to reunite with his father, who he soon learns is missing, presumed killed by a tiger. Facing deportation back to the United States, Terry escapes the authorities, and meets up by chance with orphaned runaway Raji and his pet elephant, Maya; and the two boys decide to team up to go in search of Terry&#x27;s father, as Terry is hopeful his father is actually still alive. Over the course of the series the duo and the elephant continue their search while facing many side-plots, but never succeed in their quest in the episodes made during the series&#x27; short run.

<text>Väinämöinen () is a demigod, hero and the central character in Finnish folklore and the main character in the national epic &quot;Kalevala&quot; by Elias Lönnrot. Väinämöinen was described as an old and wise man, and he possessed a potent, magical singing voice.

==In Finnish mythology==
The first extant mention of Väinämöinen in literature is in a list of Tavastian gods by Mikael Agricola in 1551, where it says: &quot;Aeinemöinen wirdhet tacoi.&quot; () He and other writers described Väinämöinen as the god of chants, songs and poetry; in many stories Väinämöinen was the central figure at the birth of the world. The Karelian and Finnish national epic, the &quot;Kalevala&quot;, tells of his birth in the course of a creation story in its opening sections. This myth has elements of creation from chaos and from a cosmic egg, as well as of earth diver creation.

At first there were only primal waters and Sky. But Sky also had a daughter named Ilmatar. One day, Ilmatar descended to the waters and became pregnant. She gestated for a very long time in the waters not being able to give birth. One day a goldeneye was seeking a resting place and flew to the knee of Ilmatar, where it laid its eggs. As the bird incubated its eggs Ilmatar&#x27;s knee grew warmer and warmer. Eventually she was burned by the heat and responded by moving her leg, dislodging the eggs that then fell and shattered in the waters. Land was formed from the lower part of one of the eggshells, while sky formed from the top. The egg whites turned into the moon and stars, and the yolk became the sun.

Ilmatar continued to float in the waters. Her footprints became pools for fish, and by pointing she created contours in the land. In this way she made all that is. Then one day she gave birth to Väinämöinen, the first man. Väinämöinen swam until he found land, but the land was barren. With Sampsa Pellervoinen he spread life over the land.

In the eighteenth century folk tale collected by Cristfried Ganander, Väinämöinen is said to be son of Kaleva and thus brother of Ilmarinen. His name is believed to come from the Finnish word &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;stream pool&quot;.

==In the &quot;Kalevala&quot;==

In the nineteenth century, some folklorists, most notably Elias Lönnrot, the writer of &quot;Kalevala&quot;, disputed Väinämöinen&#x27;s mythological background, claiming that he was an ancient hero, or an influential shaman who lived perhaps in the ninth century. Stripping Väinämöinen from his direct godlike characteristics, Lönnrot turned Väinämöinen into the son of the primal goddess Ilmatar, whom Lönnrot had invented himself. In this story, it was she who was floating in the sea when a duck laid eggs on her knee.
He possessed the wisdom of the ages from birth, for he was in his mother&#x27;s womb for seven hundred and thirty years, while she was floating in the sea and while the earth was formed. It is after praying to the sun, the moon, and the great bear (the stars, referring to Ursa Major) that he is able to leave his mother&#x27;s womb and dive into the sea.

Väinämöinen is presented as the &#x27;eternal bard&#x27;, who exerts order over chaos and established the land of Kaleva, and around whom revolve so many of the events in &quot;Kalevala&quot;. His search for a wife brings the land of Kaleva into, at first friendly, but later hostile contact with its dark and threatening neighbour in the north, Pohjola. This conflict culminates in the creation and theft of the Sampo, a magical artifact made by Ilmarinen, the subsequent mission to recapture it, and a battle which ends up splintering the Sampo and dispersing its parts around the world to parts unknown.

Väinämöinen also demonstrated his magical voice by sinking the impetuous Joukahainen into a bog by singing. Väinämöinen also slays a great pike and makes a magical kantele from its jawbones.

Väinämöinen&#x27;s end is a hubristic one. The 50th and final poem of the &quot;Kalevala&quot; tells the story of the maiden Marjatta, who becomes pregnant after eating a berry, giving birth to a baby boy. This child is brought to Väinämöinen to examine and judge. His verdict is that such a strangely born infant needs to be put to death. In reply, the newborn child, mere two weeks old, chides the old sage for his sins and transgressions, such as allowing the maiden Aino, sister of Joukahainen, to drown herself. Following this, the baby is baptized and named king of &quot;Kalevala&quot;. Defeated, Väinämöinen goes to the shores of the sea, where he sings for himself a boat of copper, with which he sails away from the mortal realms. In his final words, he promises that there shall be a time when he shall return, when his crafts and might shall once again be needed. Thematically, the 50th poem thus echoes the arrival of Christianity to Finland and the subsequent fading into history of the old pagan beliefs. This is a common theme among epics, for in the tale of King Arthur, Arthur declares a similar promise before departing for Avalon.

In the original 1888 translation of &quot;Kalevala&quot; into English by John Martin Crawford, Väinämöinen&#x27;s name was anglicised as Wainamoinen.

==In other cultures==
In the Estonian national epic Kalevipoeg, a similar hero is called Vanemuine. In neighbouring Scandinavia, Odin shares many attributes with Väinämöinen, such as connections to magic and poetry.

==Popular culture==
The Kalevala has been translated into English and many other languages, in both verse and prose, in complete and abridged forms. For more details see list of Kalevala translations.

===J. R. R. Tolkien===
Väinämöinen has been identified as a source for Gandalf, the wizard in J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s novel &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. Another Tolkienian character with great similarities to Väinämöinen is Tom Bombadil. Like Väinämöinen, he is one of the most powerful beings in his world, and both are ancient and natural beings in their setting. Both Tom Bombadil and Väinämöinen rely on the power of song and lore. Likewise, Treebeard and the Ents in general have been compared to Väinämöinen.

===Akseli Gallen-Kallela===
In art (such as the accompanying picture by Akseli Gallen-Kallela), Väinämöinen is described as an old man with a long white beard, which is also a popular appearance for wizards in fantasy literature.

===Music===
In music, Finnish folk metal band Ensiferum wrote three songs based on/about Väinämöinen, called &quot;Old Man&quot;, &quot;Little Dreamer&quot; and &quot;Cold Northland&quot;. There is also a direct reference to him in their song &quot;One More Magic Potion&quot;, where they have written &quot;Who can shape a kantele from a pike&#x27;s jaw, like the great One once did?&quot;. The band&#x27;s mascot, who appears on all their albums, also bears a similarity to traditional depictions of Väinämöinen.
Another Finnish metal band named Amorphis released their tenth album The Beginning of Times in 2011. It is a concept album based on the myths and stories of Väinämöinen.
Yet another well-known Finnish metal band, Korpiklaani has released a song about the death of Väinämöinen, Tuonelan Tuvilla, as well as an English version named &quot;At The Huts of the Underworld&quot;.
A song on the album &quot;Archipelago&quot; by Scottish electronic jazz collective Hidden Orchestra is also named &quot;Vainamoinen&quot;.
Philadelphia based Black metal band Nihilistinen Barbaarisuus released a song about Väinämöinen simply called &quot;Väinämöinen&quot; on their second studio album &quot;The Child Must Die&quot; in 2015.
In classical music, Väinämöinen appears as the main character in the first movement of Jean Sibelius&#x27; original music for the &quot;Days of the Press&quot; celebrations of 1899. The first tableaux in this music known as Väinämöinen&#x27;s Song later became the first movement of Sibelius&#x27; 1911 orchestral suite Scènes Historiques. Väinämöinen is also the theme of a composition for choir and harp by Zoltán Kodály, &quot;Wainamoinen makes music&quot;, premiered by David Watkins.

===Science fiction and fantasy===
Joan D. Vinge&#x27;s &quot;The Summer Queen&quot; contains characters named Vanamoinen, Ilmarinen, and Kullervo. They are not the characters from the legend though but may have been inspired by them. That book is the sequel to her Hugo Award-winning novel &quot;The Snow Queen&quot;.

Väinämöinen is also a major character in The Iron Druid Chronicles novel, &quot;Hammered&quot; by Kevin Hearne. The series follows the Tempe, Arizona-based 2,100 year-old Irish Druid, Atticus O&#x27;Sullivan. This book&#x27;s main plot is the ingress of several characters - the Slavic thunder god Perun, O&#x27;Sullivan, a werewolf, a vampire, Finnish folk legend Väinämöinen, and Taoist fangshi Zhang Guolao - into Asgard to kill Norse thunder god Thor, all for their own varied reasons.

===Comic books===
There is a Finnish comic strip called &quot;Väinämöisen paluu&quot; (The Return of Väinämöinen) by Petri Hiltunen, where Väinämöinen returns from thousand-year exile to modern Finland to comment on the modern lifestyle with humor.

In the storyline &quot;Love her to Death&quot; of the web-comic Nukees, Gav, having died, arrives to an afterlife populated by gods. Among them is Väinämöinen, who, among other things, complains that one only gets women by playing the electric kantele.

In the Uncle Scrooge comic &quot;The Quest for Kalevala&quot;, drawn by Don Rosa, Väinämöinen helps Scrooge and company to reassemble the Sampo (mythical mill that could produce gold from thin air) and then leaves with it back to Kalevala, but not before giving Scrooge its handle as a souvenir.

In the webcomic &quot;Axis Powers Hetalia&quot;, the character of Finland was given the human name Tino Väinämöinen.

<text>Dobruja or Dobrudja (; or &quot;Dobrudža&quot;; , ; ; Dobrujan Tatar: &quot;Tomrîğa&quot;) is a geographical and historical region in Southeastern Europe that has been divided since the 19th century between the territories of Bulgaria and Romania. It is situated between the lower Danube River and the Black Sea, and includes the Danube Delta, the Romanian coast, and the northernmost part of the Bulgarian coast. The territory of Dobruja is made up of Northern Dobruja, which is a part of Romania, and Southern Dobruja, which is a part of Bulgaria.

The territory of the Romanian region Dobrogea is organised as the counties of Constanța and Tulcea, with a combined area of and, , a population of slightly less than 850,000. Its main cities are Constanța, Tulcea, Medgidia, and Mangalia. Dobrogea is represented by dolphins in the coat of arms of Romania.

The Bulgarian region Dobrudzha is divided among the provinces of Dobrich and Silistra; the following villages of Razgrad Province: Konevo, Rainino, Terter and Madrevo; and the village General Kantardzhievo (Varna). The region has a total area of , with a combined population of some 250,000 people. The main towns are Dobrich and Silistra, the administrative centers of the two provinces.

== Geography ==


Except for the Danube Delta, a marshy region located in its northeastern corner, Dobruja is hilly, with an average altitude of about 200–300  metres. The highest point is the Țuțuiatu (Greci) Peak in the Măcin Mountains, having a height of 467 m. The Dobruja Plateau covers most of the Romanian part of Dobruja. The Ludogorie Plateau is found in Bulgaria. Lake Razelm is one of the most important lakes in Northern Dobruja.

Dobruja lies in the temperate continental climatic area; the local climate is determined by the influx of oceanic air from the northwest and northeast and continental air from the East European Plain. Dobruja&#x27;s relatively level terrain and its bare location facilitate the influx of humid, warm air in the spring, summer, and autumn from the northwest, as well as that of northern and northeastern polar air in the winter. The Black Sea also exerts an influence over the region&#x27;s climate, particularly within 40–60  kilometres from the coast. The average annual temperatures range from 11 °C inland and along the Danube, to 11.8 °C on the coast and less than 10 °C in the higher parts of the plateau. The coastal region of Southern Dobruja is the most arid part of Bulgaria, with an annual precipitation of 450  millimetres.

Dobruja is a windy region once known for its windmills. There is wind during about 85–90% of all days; it usually comes from the north or northeast. The average wind speed is about twice higher than the average in Bulgaria. Due to the limited precipitation and the proximity to the sea, rivers in Dobruja are usually short and with low discharge. The region has several shallow seaside lakes with brackish water.

== Etymology ==
The most widespread opinion among scholars is that the origin of the term &quot;Dobruja&quot; is to be found in the Turkish rendition of the name of a 14th‑century Bulgarian ruler, despot Dobrotitsa. It was common for the Turks to name countries after one of their early rulers (for example, nearby Moldavia was known as &quot;Bogdan Iflak&quot; by the Turks, named after Bogdan I). Other etymologies have been considered, but never gained widespread acceptance.

Abdolonyme Ubicini believed the name meant &quot;good lands&quot;, derived from Slavic &quot;dobro&quot; (&quot;good&quot;), an opinion that was adopted by several 19th‑century scholars. This derivation appears to contrast with the usual 19th‑century description of Dobruja as a dry barren land; it has been explained as expressing the point of view of Ruthenes, who considered the Danube delta in the northern Dobruja as a significant improvement over the steppes to the North. I. A. Nazarettean combines the Slavic word with the Tatar &quot;budjak&quot; (&quot;corner&quot;), thus proposing the etymology &quot;good corner&quot;.

A version matching contemporaneous descriptions was suggested by Kanitz, who associated the name with the Bulgarian &quot;dobrice&quot; (&quot;rocky and unproductive terrain&quot;). According to Gheorghe I. Brătianu, the name is a Slavic derivation from the Turkic word &quot;Bordjan&quot; or &quot;Brudjars&quot;, which referred to the Turkic Proto-Bulgarians; this term was also used by Arabic writers.

One of the earliest documented uses of the name can be found in the Turkish &quot;Oghuz-name&quot; narrative, dated to the 15th century, where it appears as &quot;Dobruja-éli&quot;. The possessive suffix &quot;el-i&quot; indicated that the land was considered as belonging to Dobrotitsa (&quot;&quot; in the original Ottoman Turkish). The loss of the final particle is not unusual in the Turkish world, a similar evolution being observed in the name of Aydın, originally &quot;Aydın-éli&quot;. Another early use is in the 16th‑century Latin translation of Laonicus Chalcondyles&#x27; &quot;Histories&quot;, where the term &quot;Dobroditia&quot; is used for the original Greek &quot;Dobrotitsa&#x27;s country&quot; (). In the 17th century, the region was referred to in more accounts, with renditions such as &quot;Dobrucia&quot;, &quot;Dobrutcha&quot;, &quot;Dobrus&quot;, &quot;Dobruccia&quot;, &quot;Dobroudja&quot;, &quot;Dobrudscha&quot;, and others being used by foreign authors.

Initially, the name meant just the steppe of the southern region, between the forests around Babadag in the north and the Silistra–Dobrich–Balchik line in the south. Eventually, the term was extended to include the northern part and the Danube Delta. In the 19th century, some authors used the name to refer just to the territory between the southernmost branch of the Danube (St. George) in the north and the Karasu Valley (nowadays the Danube-Black Sea Canal) in the south.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
The territory of Dobruja has been inhabited by humans since Middle and Upper Palaeolithic, as the remains at Babadag, Slava Rusă and Enisala demonstrate. Paleolithic people made tools of silex and ate fruits, fish, and other hunted animals. In this period fire was discovered, and at its end, the bow with arrows and the boat sculpted from a trunk tree was invented. There were found tools in caves, inclusive Gura Dobrogei. In the Neolithic, the territory was occupied by members of the Hamangia culture (named after a village on the Dobrujan coast), Boian culture, and Karanovo V culture. At the end of the fifth millennium BC, the Gumelniţa culture appeared in the region under the influence of Aegeo-Mediterranean tribes and cultures. In the Eneolithic, populations migrating from the north of the Black Sea, of the Kurgan culture, mixed with the previous population, creating the Cernavodă I culture. Under the influence of Kurgan II , the Cernavodă II culture emerged. Through the combination of the Cernavodă I and Ezero culture, the Cernavodă III culture developed. The region had commercial contact with the Mediterranean world by the 14th century BC, as proven by a Mycenaean sword discovered at Medgidia, but under the reserve demanded by lack of hard evidence in what concerns the provenience/manufacturer of such armours. 

=== Ancient history ===


During the early Iron Age (8th–6th centuries BC), there was increased differentiation of the local Getic tribes from the Thracian mass. In the second part of the 8th century BC, the first signs of commercial relations between the indigenous population and the Greeks appeared on the shore of the Halmyris Gulf (now the Sinoe Lake).

In 657/656 BC ancient Greek colonists from Miletus founded a colony in the region: Histria. In the 7th and 6th centuries BC, more Greek colonies were founded on the Dobrujan coast (Callatis, Tomis, Dionysopolis, Parthenopolis, Aphrodisias, Eumenia etc.). In the 5th century BC these colonies were under the influence of the Delian League, passing in this period from oligarchy to democracy. In the 6th century BC, the first Scythian groups began to enter the region. Two Getic tribes, the &quot;Crobyzi&quot; and &quot;Terizi&quot;, and the town of Orgame (Argamum) were mentioned on the territory of present Dobruja by Hekataios of Miletus (540–470 BC).

In 514/512 BC King Darius I of Persia subdued the Getae living in the region during his expedition against Scythians living north of the Danube. At about 430 BC, the Odrysian kingdom under Sitalkes extended its rule to the mouths of the Danube. In 429 BC, Getae from the region participated in an Odrysian campaign in Macedonia. In the 4th century BC, the Scythians brought Dobruja under their sway. In 341–339 BC, one of their kings, Atheas, fought against Histria, which was supported by a &quot;Histrianorum rex&quot; (probably a local Getic ruler). In 339 BC, King Atheas was defeated by the Macedonians under King Philip II, who afterwards extended his rule over Dobruja.

In 313  BC and again in 310–309  BC, the Greek colonies led by Callatis, supported by Antigonus I Monophthalmus, revolted against Macedonian rule. The revolts were suppressed by Lysimachus, the diadochus of Thrace, who also began a military expedition against Dromichaetes, the ruler of the Getae north of the Danube, in 300 BC. In the 3rd century BC, colonies on the Dobrujan coast paid tribute to the basilei Zalmodegikos and Moskon, who probably also ruled northern Dobruja. In the same century, Celts settled in the north of the region. In 260  BC, Byzantion lost the war with Callatis and Histria for the control of Tomis. At the end of the 3rd century BC and the beginning of the 2nd century BC, the Bastarnae settled in the area of the Danube Delta. Around 200  BC, the Thracian king Zoltes invaded the province several times, but was defeated by Rhemaxos, who became the protector of the Greek colonies.

Early Greek scholars such as Herodotus appear to have regarded the region as the south-western extension of Scythia – a practice also followed in a 2nd-century BC inscription, recording a decree made in Histria, which refers to the region surrounding the Greek city as &quot;Scythia&quot;. However, the toponym Μικρά Σκυθία (&quot;Mikra Skythia&quot;), usually translated as Scythia Minor appears to have become the name for the region later known as Dobruja. The earliest known usage of &quot;Mikra Skythia&quot; is found in Strabo&#x27;s early &quot;Geography&quot; (1st century AD). The Greeks thus apparently distinguished it from &quot;Scythia Major&quot;, which lay north of the Danube delta.

Around 100 BC King Mithridates VI of Pontus extended his authority over the Greek cities in Dobruja. However, in 72–71 BC, during the Third Mithridatic War, these cities were occupied by the forces of Marcus Terentius Varro Lucullus, the Roman proconsul of Macedonia. A foedus was signed between the Greek colonies and the Roman Republic, but in 62–61 BC the colonies revolted. Gaius Antonius Hybrida intervened, but was defeated by Getae and Bastarnae at the Battle of Histria. After 55 BC the Dacian Kingdom under King Burebista conquered Dobruja and all the Greek colonies on the coast.

=== Roman rule ===
In 28/29 BC Rholes, a Getic ruler from Southern Dobruja, supported the proconsul of Macedonia, Marcus Licinius Crassus, in his action against the Bastarnae. Declared &quot;friend and ally of the Roman people&quot; by Octavian, Rholes helped Crassus in conquering the states of Dapyx (in central Dobruja) and Zyraxes (in the north of the region). Dobruja became part of the client kingdom of the Odrysians, while the Greek cities on the coast came under direct rule of the governor of Macedonia.

In 6 AD the Roman province of Moesia was created when mention is made of its governor, Caecina Severus., but Dobruja, under the name &quot;Ripa Thraciae&quot;, remained part of the Odrysian kingdom. The Greek cities on the coast formed a &quot;praefectura orae maritimae&quot;.

In 12 AD and 15 AD, Getic armies succeeded in conquering the cities of Aegyssus and Troesmis for a short time, but Odrysian king Rhoemetalces I defeated them with the help of the Roman army.

In 46 AD Thracia became a Roman province and the territories of present Dobruja were absorbed into the province of Moesia. The Geto–Dacians invaded the region several times in the 1st century AD, especially between 62 and 70. In the same period, the base of the Roman Danube fleet (&quot;classis Flavia Moesica&quot;) was moved to Noviodunum. The &quot;praefectura&quot; was annexed to Moesia in 86  AD. In the same year Domitian divided Moesia, Dobruja being included in the eastern part, &quot;Moesia Inferior&quot;.

In the winter of 101–102 the Dacian king Decebalus led a coalition of Dacians, Carpians, Sarmatians and Burs in an attack against Moesia Inferior. The invading army was defeated by the Roman legions under Emperor Trajan on the Yantra river. (Later Nicopolis ad Istrum was founded there to commemorate the victory.) The invaders were also defeated near the modern village of Adamclisi, in the southern part of Dobruja. The latter victory was commemorated by the Tropaeum Traiani monument built in 109 at the site and the founding of the city of the same name. After 105, Legio XI Claudia and Legio V Macedonica were moved to Durostorum and Troesmis, respectively.

In 118 Hadrian intervened in the region to calm a Sarmatian rebellion. In 170 Costoboci invaded Dobruja, attacking Libida, Ulmetum and Tropaeum. The province was generally stable and prosperous until the crisis of the Third Century, which led to the weakening of defences and numerous barbarian invasions. In the Gothic War (248-253) a coalition of Goths under King Cniva devastated Dobruja. Barbarian attacks followed in 258, 263 and 267. In 269 a fleet of allied Goths, Heruli, Bastarnae and Sarmatians attacked the cities on the coast, including Tomis. In 272 Aurelian defeated the Carpians north of the Danube and settled a part of them near Carsium. The same emperor put an end to the crisis in the Roman Empire, thus helping the reconstruction of the province.

During the reign of Diocletian, Dobruja was organized administratively as a separate province, called Scythia, part of the Diocese of Thracia. Its capital city was Tomis. Diocletian created Legio II Herculia and Legio I Iovia and installed them at Troesmis and Noviodunum respectively. In 331–332 Constantine the Great defeated the Goths who attacked the province. But Dobruja was devastated again by Ostrogoths in 384–386. Under the Roman emperors Licinius, Julian the Apostate, and Valens, the cities of the region were repaired or rebuilt.

==== Byzantine rule ====
After the division of the Roman Empire, Dobruja was absorbed into the Eastern Roman Empire. Between 513 and 520, the region participated in a revolt against Anastasius I. Its leader, Vitalian, native of Zaldapa in Southern Dobruja, defeated the Byzantine general Hypatius near Kaliakra. During Justin I&#x27;s rule, Antes and Slavs invaded the region, but Germanus Justinus defeated them. In 529, the Gepid commander Mundus repelled a new invasion by Bulgars and Antes. Kutrigurs and Avars invaded the region several times, until 561–562, when the Avars under Bayan I were settled south of the Danube as foederati. During the rule of Mauricius Tiberius, the Slavs devastated Dobruja, destroying the cities of Dorostolon, Zaldapa, and Tropaeum. In 591/593, Byzantine general Priscus tried to stop invasions, attacking and defeating the Slavs under Ardagast in the north of the province. In 602 during the mutiny of the Byzantine army in the Balkans under Phocas, a large mass of Slavs crossed the Danube, settling south of the Danube. Dobruja remained under loose Byzantine control, and was reorganised during the reign of Constantine IV as &quot;Thema Scythia&quot;.

=== First Bulgarian Empire rule ===
The results of archaeological research indicate that the Byzantine presence on Dobruja&#x27;s mainland and the banks of the Danube were reduced at the end of the 6th century, under the pressure of the Migration Period. In the coastal fortifications on the southern bank of the Danube, the latest Byzantine coin found dates from the time of the emperors Tiberius II Constantine (574–582) and Heraclius (610–641). After that period, all inland Byzantine cities were demolished by the invaders and abandoned.

Some of the earliest Slavic settlements to the south of Danube have been discovered in Dobruja, near the villages of Popina, Garvăn and Nova Cherna. They have been dated to the end of the 6th and the beginning of the 7th centuries. These lands became the main zone of compact Bulgar settlement in the end of the 7th century.

According to the peace treaty of 681, signed after the Bulgarian victory over Byzantines in the Battle of Ongala, Dobruja became part of the First Bulgarian Empire. Shortly after, the Bulgar founded the city of Pliska, which became the first Bulgarian capital, near the southern border of Dobruja. They rebuilt Madara as a major Bulgar pagan religious centre. According to the &quot;Bulgarian Apocryphal Chronicle&quot;, from the 11th century, Bulgarian Tsar Ispor &quot;accepted the Bulgarian tsardom&quot;, created &quot;great cities, Drastar on the Danube&quot;, a &quot;great wall from Danube to the sea&quot;, &quot;the city of Pliska&quot; and &quot;populated the lands of Karvuna&quot; (nowadays Balchik).

According to Bulgarian historians, during the 7th–10th centuries, the region was fortified by construction of a large network of earthen and wooden strongholds and ramparts. Around the end of the 8th century, widespread building of new stone fortresses and defensive walls began. The Bulgarians also reconstructed some of the ruined Byzantine fortresses (Kaliakra and Silistra in the 8th century, Madara and Varna in the 9th). According to Barnea, among other historians, during the following three centuries of Bulgarian domination, Byzantines still controlled the Black Sea coast and the mouths of Danube, and for short periods, even some cities. But Bulgarian archaeologists note that the last Byzantine coins found, which are considered a proof of Byzantine presence, date in Kaliakra from the time of Emperor Justin II (565–578), in Varna from the time of Emperor Heraclius (610–641), and in Tomis from Constantine IV&#x27;s rule (668–685).

At the beginning of the 8th century, Justinian II visited Dobruja to ask Bulgarian Khan Tervel for military help. Khan Omurtag (815–831) built a &quot;glorious home on the Danube&quot; and erected a mound in the middle of the distance between Pliska and his new building, according to his inscription kept in SS. Forty Martyrs Church in Veliko Tarnovo. The location of this edifice is unclear; the main theories place it at Silistra or at Păcuiul lui Soare. Many early medieval Bulgar stone inscriptions were found in Dobruja, including historical narratives, inventories of armament or buildings, and commemorative texts. During this period Silistra became an important Bulgarian ecclesiastical centre—an episcopate after 865 and seat of the Bulgarian Patriarch at the end of the 10th century. In 895, Magyar tribes from Budjak invaded Dobruja and northeastern Bulgaria. An old Slavic inscription, found at Mircea Vodă, mentions Zhupan Dimitri (Дѣимитрѣ жѹпанѣ), a local feudal landlord prominent in the south of the region in 943.

=== Return of Byzantine rule and late migrations ===
With financial encouragement from the Byzantine emperor, Nikephoros II Phocas, Sviatoslav I of Kiev agreed to assist the Byzantines in their war with the Bulgarians. Sviatoslav defeated the Bulgarians (led by Boris II) and proceeded to occupy the whole of northern Bulgaria. He occupied Dobruja in 968 and moved the capital of Kievan Rus&#x27; to Pereyaslavets, in the north of the region. Sviatoslav refused to turn his Balkan conquests over to the Byzantines, and the parties fell out as a result. So the Byzantines under John I Tzimisces reconquered Dobruja in 971 and included it in the theme &#x27;Mesopotamia of the West&#x27; (Μεσοποταμια της Δυσεον).

According to some historians, soon after 976 or in 986, the southern part of Dobruja was included in the Bulgarian state then ruled by Samuel. The northern part remained under Byzantine rule, being reorganised in an autonomous &quot;klimata&quot;. Other historians are of the view that Northern Dobruja was reconquered by Bulgarians as well. In 1000, a Byzantine army commanded by Theodorokanos reconquered the whole of Dobruja, organizing the region as the Strategia of Dorostolon and, after 1020, as &quot;Paristrion&quot; (Paradounavon).

To prevent mounted attacks from the north, the Byzantines constructed three ramparts from the Black Sea down to the Danube, in the 10th–11th centuries. According to Bulgarian archaeologists and historians, these fortifications may have been built much earlier and were erected by the First Bulgarian Empire in response to the threat of Khazars&#x27; raids.

From the 10th century, Byzantines accepted small groups of Pechenegs settling in Dobruja. In the spring of 1036, an invasion of the Pecheneg devastated large parts of the region, destroying the forts at Capidava and Dervent, and burning the settlement of Dinogeţia. In 1046 the Byzantines accepted the Pecheneg under Kegen settling in Paristrion as foederati. The Pecheneg dominated the region until 1059, when Isaac I Komnenos reconquered Dobruja.

In 1064, an invasion by the Oghuz Turks affected the region. During 1072 to 1074, when Nestor (the new strategos of Paristrion) was in Dristra, he found that the Pecheneg ruler, Tatrys, was leading a rebellion. In 1091, three autonomous, probably Pecheneg, rulers were mentioned in the Alexiad: Tatos (&quot;Τατοῦ&quot;) or Chalis (&quot;χαλῆ&quot;), in the area of Dristra (probably the same person as Tatrys), and Sesthlav (&quot;Σεσθλάβου&quot;) and Satza (&quot;Σατζά&quot;) in the area of Vicina. The Cumans moved into Dobruja in 1094 and were influential in the region until the advent of the Ottoman Empire.

=== Second Bulgarian Empire and Mongol domination ===

In 1187 the Byzantines lost control of Dobruja to the restored Bulgarian Empire. In 1241, the first Tatar groups, under Kadan, invaded Dobruja starting a century long history of turmoil in the region. Around 1263–64, Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaeologus gave permission to Sultan Kaykaus II to settle in the area with a group of Seljuk Turks from Anatolia. A missionary Turkish mystic, Sarı Saltuk, was the spiritual leader of this group. His tomb in Babadag (which was named after him) is still a place of pilgrimage for Muslims.
Arab chronicles of the 13th century mentioned Dobrogea under the name &quot;Şakji&quot; and the Vlachs inhabitants under the names &quot;al-Awalak&quot; and &quot;ulaqut&quot;.
In 1265, the Bulgarian Emperor Constantine Tikh Asen hired 20,000 Tatars to cross the Danube and attack Byzantine Thrace. On their way back, the Tatars forced most of the Seljuk Turks, including their chief Sarı Saltuk, to resettle in Kipchak (Cumania).

In the second part of the 13th century, the Turco–Mongolian Golden Horde Empire continuously raided and plundered Dobruja. The inability of the Bulgarian authorities to cope with the numerous raids became the main reason for the uprising, led by Ivailo (1277–1280), that broke out in eastern Bulgaria. Ivailo&#x27;s army defeated the Tatars, who were forced to leave the Bulgarian territory; he next outed Constantine Tikh&#x27;s army, and Ivailo has crowned Emperor of Bulgaria.

The war with the Tatars continued. In 1278, after a new Tatar invasion in Dobruja, Ivailo was forced to retreat to the strong fortress of Silistra, where he withstood a three-month siege. In 1280 the Bulgarian nobility, which feared the growing influence of the peasant emperor, organised a coup. Ivailo had to flee to his enemy the Tatar Nogai Khan, who later killed him. In 1300 Toqta, the new Khan of the Golden Horde, ceded Bessarabia to Emperor Theodore Svetoslav.

=== Autonomous Dobruja ===

In 1325, the Ecumenical Patriarch nominated Methodius as Metropolitan of Varna and Carvona. After this date, Balik/Balica is mentioned as a local ruler in Southern Dobruja. In 1346, he supported John V Palaeologus in his dispute for the Byzantine throne with John VI Cantacuzenus. He sent an army corps under his son Dobrotitsa/Dobrotici and his brother, Theodore, to help the mother of John Palaeologus, Anna of Savoy. For his bravery, Dobrotitsa received the title of &quot;strategos&quot; and married the daughter of megadux Apokaukos. After the reconciliation of the two pretenders, a territorial dispute broke out between the Dobrujan polity and the Byzantine Empire for the port of Midia. In 1347, at John V Palaeologus&#x27; request, Emir Bahud-din Umur, Bey of Aydın, led a naval expedition against Balik, destroying Dobruja&#x27;s seaports. Balik and Theodore died during the confrontation, and Dobrotitsa became the new ruler.

Between 1352 and 1359, with the collapse of Golden Horde rule in Northern Dobruja, a new state appeared. It was controlled by Tatar prince Demetrius, who claimed to be the protector of the river mouths of the Danube.

In 1357 Dobrotitsa was mentioned as a &quot;despot&quot; ruling over a large territory, including the fortresses of Varna, Kozeakos (near Obzor), and Emona. In 1366, John V Palaeologus visited Rome and Buda, trying to gather military support for his campaigns. On his return, he was captured at Vidin by Ivan Alexander, Tsar of Tarnovo, who believed that the new alliances were directed against his realm. An anti-Ottoman crusade under Amadeus VI of Savoy, supported by the republics of Venice and Genoa, was diverted to free the Byzantine emperor. Dobrotitsa collaborated with the crusaders, and after the allies conquered several Bulgarian forts on the Black Sea, Ivan Alexander freed John and negotiated a peace agreement. Dobrotitsa&#x27;s role in this conflict brought him numerous political advantages: his daughter married one of John V&#x27;s sons, Michael, and his principality extended its control over some of the forts lost by the Bulgarians (Anchialos and Mesembria).

In 1368, after the death of prince Demetrius, Dobrotitsa was recognised as ruler by Pangalia and other cities on the right bank of the Danube. In 1369, together with Vladislav I of Wallachia, Dobrotitsa helped Prince Stratsimir to win back the throne of Vidin.

Between 1370 and 1375, allied with Venice, Dobritsia challenged Genoese power in the Black Sea. In 1376, he tried to impose his son-in-law, Michael, as Emperor of Trebizond, but was unsuccessful. Dobrotitsa supported John V Palaeologus against his son Andronicus IV Palaeologus. In 1379, the Dobrujan fleet participated in the blockade of Constantinople, fighting with the Genoese fleet.

In 1386, Dobrotitsa died and was succeeded by Ivanko. That same year he accepted a peace agreement with Murad I and in 1387 signed a commercial treaty with Genoa. Ivanko was killed in 1388 during the expedition of Ottoman Grand Vizier Çandarli Ali Pasha against Tarnovo and Dristra. The expedition brought most of the Dobrujan forts under Turkish rule.

=== Wallachian rule ===
In 1388/1389 Dobruja (&quot;Terrae Dobrodicii&quot;—as mentioned in a document from 1390) and Dristra (&quot;Dârstor&quot;) came under the control of Mircea the Elder, ruler of Wallachia, who defeated the Ottoman Grand Vizier.

Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I conquered the southern part of the territory in 1393, attacking Mircea one year later, but without success. In the spring of 1395 Mircea regained the lost Dobrujan territories, with the help of his Hungarian allies.

The Ottomans recaptured Dobruja in 1397 and ruled it to 1404, although in 1401 Mircea strongly defeated an Ottoman army.

The defeat of Sultan Beyezid I by Tamerlane at Ankara in 1402 opened a period of anarchy in the Ottoman Empire. Mircea took advantage of it to organise a new anti-Ottoman campaign: in 1403, he occupied the Genoese fort of Kilia at the mouths of the Danube. Thus in 1404, he could impose his authority on Dobruja. In 1416, Mircea supported the revolt against Sultan Mehmed I, led by Sheikh Bedreddin in the area of Deliorman, in Southern Dobruja.

After Mircea died in 1418, his son Mihail I fought against the amplified Ottoman attacks, eventually being killed in a battle in 1420. That year, Sultan Mehmed I conducted the definitive conquest of Dobruja by the Turks. Wallachia kept only the mouths of the Danube, but not for a long duration.

In the late 14th century, German traveller Johann Schiltberger described these lands as follows:

=== Ottoman rule ===

Annexed by the Ottoman Empire in 1420, the region remained under Ottoman control until the late 19th century. Initially, it was organised as an &quot;udj&quot; (border province), included in the sanjak of Silistra, part of the Eyalet of Rumelia. Later, under Murad II or Suleiman I, the sanjak of Silistra and surrounding territories were organised as a separate eyalet. In 1555, a revolt led by the &quot;false&quot; (&quot;düzme&quot;) Mustafa, a pretender to the Turkish throne, broke out against Ottoman administration in Rumelia and rapidly spread to Dobruja, but was repressed by the beylerbey of Nigbolu. In 1603 and 1612, the region suffered from the forays of Cossacks, who burnt down Isaķči and plundered Küstendje.

The Russian Empire occupied Dobruja several times during the Russo-Turkish wars — in 1771–1774, 1790–1791, 1809–1810, 1829, and 1853. The most violent invasion was that of 1829, which resulted in the depopulation of numerous villages and towns. The Treaty of Adrianople of 1829 ceded the Danube Delta to the Russian Empire. However, Russia was forced to return it to the Ottomans in 1856, after the Crimean War. In 1864 Dobruja was included in the Vilayet of Danube.

=== Russo-Turkish War of 1878 and aftermath ===
After the 1878 war, the Treaty of San Stefano awarded Dobruja to Russia and the newly established Principality of Bulgaria. The northern portion, held by Russia, was ceded to Romania in exchange for Russia obtaining territories in Southern Bessarabia, thereby securing direct access to the mouths of the Danube. The population included a Bulgarian ethnic enclave in the northeast (around Babadag), as well as an important Muslim majority (mostly Turks and Tatars) scattered around the region.

The southern portion, held by Bulgaria, was reduced the same year by the Treaty of Berlin. At the advice of the French envoy, a strip of land extended inland from the port of Mangalia (shown orange on the map) was ceded to Romania, since its southwestern corner contained a compact area of ethnic Romanians. The town of Silistra, located at the area&#x27;s most southwestern point, remained Bulgarian due to its large Bulgarian population. Romania subsequently tried to occupy the town as well, but in 1879 a new international commission allowed Romania to occupy only the fort &quot;Arab Tabia&quot;, which overlooked Silistra, but not the town itself.
At the beginning of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, most of Dobruja&#x27;s population was composed of ethnic Tatars, and Turks, with minorities of Romanians, and Bulgarians. During the war, a large part of the Muslim population was evacuated to Bulgaria and Turkey. After 1878, the Romanian government encouraged Romanians from other regions to settle in Northern Dobruja and accepted the return of some Muslim population displaced by the war.

According to Bulgarian historians, after 1878 the Romanian church authorities took control over all local churches, with the exception of two in the towns of Tulcea and Constanţa, which managed to retain use of their Bulgarian Slavonic liturgy. Between 1879 and 1900, Bulgarians built 15 new churches in Northern Dobruja. After 1880, Italians from Friuli and Veneto settled in Greci, Cataloi and Măcin in Northern Dobruja. Most of them worked in the granite quarries in the Măcin Mountains, while some became farmers. The Bulgarian authorities encouraged the settling of ethnic Bulgarians in the territory of Southern Dobruja.

=== Balkan Wars and World War I ===
In May 1913, the Great Powers awarded Silistra and the area in a 3  km radius around it to Romania, at the Saint Petersburg Conference. In August 1913, after the Second Balkan War, Bulgaria lost Southern Dobruja (&quot;Cadrilater&quot;) to Romania (See Treaty of Bucharest, 1913). With Romania&#x27;s entry in World War I on the side of France and Russia, the Central Powers occupied all of Dobruja and gave the Cadrilater, as well as the southern portion of Northern Dobruja, to Bulgaria in the Treaty of Bucharest of 1918. This situation lasted for a short period. As the Allied Powers emerged victorious at the end of the war, Romania regained the lost territories in the Treaty of Neuilly of 1919. Between 1926 and 1938, about 30,000 Aromanians from Bulgaria, Macedonia, and Greece, were resettled in Southern Dobruja. Some Megleno-Romanians also emigrated to the region.

In 1923 the Internal Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation (IDRO), a Bulgarian nationalist organisation, was established. Active in Southern Dobruja under different forms until 1940, the IDRO detachments fought against the widespread brigandage in the region, as well as the Romanian administration. Thus, while considered &quot;a terrorist organisation&quot; by the Romanian authorities, the IDRO was regarded by ethnic Bulgarians as a liberation movement. In 1925, part of the Bulgarian revolutionary committees formed the Dobrujan Revolutionary Organisation (DRO), which later became subordinated to the Communist Party of Romania. In contrast with the IDRO, which fought for the inclusion of the region in the Bulgarian state, the DRO requested the independence of Dobruja and its inclusion in a projected Federative Republic of the Balkans. The means used by DRO to attain its goals were also more peaceful.

=== World War II and aftermath===
During World War II, Bulgaria regained Southern Dobruja in the September 1940 Axis-sponsored Treaty of Craiova, despite Romanian negotiators&#x27; insistence that Balchik and other towns should remain in Romania. As part of the treaty, the Romanian inhabitants (Aromanian and Megleno-Romanian refugee-settlers, settlers from other regions of Romania, and the Romanians indigenous to the region) were forced to leave the regained territory, while the Bulgarian minority in the north was expelled to go to Bulgaria in a population exchange. The post-war Paris Peace Treaties of 1947 reaffirmed the 1940 border.

In 1948 and again in 1961–1962, Bulgaria proposed a border rectification in the area of Silistra, consisting mainly of the transfer of a Romanian territory containing the water source of that city. Romania made an alternative proposal that did not involve a territorial change and, ultimately, no rectification took place.

In Romania, 14 November is a holiday observed as Dobruja Day.

== Demographic history ==
=== Ottoman era ===

During Ottoman rule, groups of Turk, Arab, Muslim Romani people and Crimean Tatars settled in the region, the latter, especially between 1512 and 1514. During the reign of Peter I of Russia and Catherine the Great, Lipovans immigrated to the region of the Danube Delta. On account of the Russo-Turkish War (1768–1774), one of the greatest migration events of the region occurred where an estimated 200,000 Tatars emigrated to the Dobruja region between 1770 and 1784. Whereas, a large group of Christians (likely Greeks and Slavs) moved the other direction into the Tatars&#x27; recently-loss region of Azov in 1778. After the destruction of Zaporozhian Sich in 1775, Cossacks were settled in the area north of Lake Razim by the Turkish authorities (where they founded the Danubian Sich). They were forced to leave Dobruja in 1828.

In the second part of the nineteenth century, Ruthenians from the Austrian Empire also settled in the Danube Delta. After the Crimean War, a large number of Tatars were forcibly driven away from Crimea, immigrating to then-Ottoman Dobruja and settling mainly in the Karasu Valley in the centre of the region and around Bābā Dāgh. In 1864, Circassians fleeing from the Russian invasion and genocide of the Caucasus were settled in the wooded region near Babadag, forming a community there. Germans from Bessarabia also founded colonies in Dobruja between 1840 and 1892.
According to Bulgarian historian Lyubomir Miletich, most Bulgarians living in Dobruja in 1900 were nineteenth-century settlers or their descendants. In 1850, the scholar Ion Ionescu de la Brad, wrote in a study on Dobruja, ordered by the Ottoman government, that Bulgarians came to the region &quot;in the last twenty years or so&quot;. According to his study, there were 2,285 Bulgarian families (out of 8,194 Christian families) in the region, 1,194 of them in Northern Dobruja. Lyubomir Miletich puts the number of Bulgarian families in Northern Dobruja in the same year at 2,097. According to the statistics of the Bulgarian Exarchate, before 1877 there were 9,324 Bulgarian families out of a total 12,364 Christian families in the Northern Dobruja. According to Russian knyaz Vladimir Cherkassky, chief of the Provisional Russian government in Bulgaria in 1877–1878, the Bulgarian population in Dobruja was larger than the Romanian one. However, count Shuvalov, the Russian representative to the Congress of Berlin, stated that Romania deserved Dobruja &quot;more than anybody else, because of its population&quot;. In 1878, the statistics of the Russian governor of Dobruja, Bieloserkovitsch, showed a number of 4,750 Bulgarian &quot;family chiefs&quot; (out of 14,612 Christian family chiefs) in the northern half of the region.

The Christian religious organisation of the region was put under the authority of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church by a firman of the Sultan, promulgated on February 28, 1870. However, the ethnic Greeks and most Romanians in Northern Dobruja remained under the authority of the Greek Archdiocese of Tulça (founded in 1829).

=== 20th century ===
In 1913, Dobruja was all made part of Romania in the aftermath of the 1913 Treaty of Bucharest which ended the Second Balkan War. Romania acquired Southern Dobruja from Bulgaria, a territory with a population of 300,000 from which only 6,000 (2%) were Romanians. In 1913, Romanian-held Northern Dobruja had a population of 380,430, from which 216,425 (56.8%) were Romanians. Thus, when Dobruja was unified within Romania in 1913, there were over 222,000 Romanians in the region out of a total population of 680,000, or nearly 33% of the population. By 1930, the Romanian population within Dobruja had increased to 44.2%.

=== Northern Dobruja ===

== Area, population and cities ==
The entire region of Dobruja has an area of around and a population of around 1.2 million, of which just over two-thirds of the former and nearly three-quarters of the latter lie in the Romanian part.

Major cities are Constanța, Tulcea, Medgidia and Mangalia in Romania, and Dobrich and Silistra in Bulgaria.

<text>Nabopolassar (, meaning &quot;Nabu, protect the son&quot;) was the founder and first king of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, ruling from his coronation as king of Babylon in 626 BC to his death in 605 BC. Though initially only aimed at restoring and securing the independence of Babylonia, Nabopolassar&#x27;s uprising against the Neo-Assyrian Empire, which had ruled Babylonia for more than a century, eventually led to the complete destruction of the Assyrian Empire and the rise of the Neo-Babylonian Empire in its place.

Of unclear, possibly Chaldean, origin and potentially connected to a powerful political family in the southern city of Uruk, Nabopolassar revolted against the Neo-Assyrian king Sinsharishkun at an opportune moment when Babylonia was already plagued by political instability. Though the advantage shifted back and forth dramatically several times, Nabopolassar managed to decisively push the Assyrians out of Babylonia after nearly ten years of fighting. Subsequent campaigns were intended to hinder the possibility of an Assyrian campaign directed at Babylonia through securing the border, but the intervention of the eastern Median Empire under Cyaxares in Nabopolassar&#x27;s favor shifted the goals and the possibilities of the war.

In 614 BC, the Medes brutally sacked the city of Assur, the religious and ceremonial heart of Assyria, and in 612 BC the Medes and Babylonians assaulted Nineveh, Assyria&#x27;s capital. As with Assur before it, Nineveh was brutally sacked, with its inhabitants, including children, slaughtered en masse and the entire city being burned to the ground. Sinsharishkun probably died in its defense. Other Assyrian cities, such as Nimrud, were also assaulted and sacked much in the same way. The brutality of the Medes, including their habit of sacking even the religious temples, was so excessive that it shocked the Babylonians; contemporary Babylonian chronicles, otherwise hostile to the Assyrians, lament the sackings with sorrow and remorse. Nabopolassar&#x27;s own attitude towards Assyria is unclear; in some inscriptions he is careful to ascribe his victory and its aftermath to divine intervention to rid himself of the blame, while in others he openly boasts of the destruction.

The Neo-Babylonian Empire&#x27;s claim to succeed the Neo-Assyrian Empire was immediately challenged by Egypt under Pharaoh Necho II, who fought for several years to restore the Assyrians, whom he was allied to, until he was defeated at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC. Upon his death that same year, Nabopolassar was succeeded by his son Nebuchadnezzar II. As the founder of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Nabopolassar was long remembered by the Babylonians after his death, even beyond the fall of his empire less than a century later. In the Hellenistic period, several centuries later, Nabopolassar&#x27;s legend was still remembered, with Babylonian authors casting him as a champion ordered by Marduk, Babylon&#x27;s chief deity, to avenge their homeland, and as a symbol against the domination of foreign empires over Babylon.

== Background ==

=== Origin and ancestry ===

Nabopolassar&#x27;s origins are unclear. In his own inscriptions, he refers to himself as a &quot;mâr lā mammâna&quot; (&quot;son of a nobody&quot;), a striking descriptor that is not known from any other Mesopotamian king. The two other Neo-Babylonian kings who had no blood connection to previous royalty; Neriglissar (560–556 BC) and Nabonidus (556–539 BC), nevertheless mentioned the names of their fathers and wrote about them with pride in their inscriptions. On account of a lack of sources in regards to his true origins, subsequent historians have variously identified Nabopolassar as a Chaldean, an Assyrian or a Babylonian. Although no evidence conclusively confirms him as being of Chaldean origin, the term &quot;Chaldean dynasty&quot; is frequently used by modern historians for the royal family he founded, and the term &quot;Chaldean Empire&quot; remains in use as an alternate historiographical name for the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Several near-contemporary texts, such as the Uruk prophecy, describe Nabopolassar as a &quot;king of the sea&quot;, i.e. of southernmost Babylonia, suggesting that his origin was south of Babylon itself. The Assyrians also ascribed him a southern origin; a letter from the Neo-Assyrian king Sinsharishkun (627–612 BC) describes Nabopolassar as &quot;of the lower sea&quot;, i.e. southernmost Mesopotamia.

==== Connection to Uruk ====

Regardless of his ethnic origin, Nabopolassar appears to have been strongly connected to the city of Uruk, located south of Babylon, possibly having been a member of its ruling elite prior to becoming Babylon&#x27;s king. In a 1998 paper, the Assyriologist Paul-Alain Beaulieu mentioned that there was a growing body of evidence that Nabopolassar&#x27;s family originated in Uruk, and also presented evidence that several of Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s (Nabopolassar&#x27;s son and successor) daughters lived in the city. In 2007, the Assyriologist Michael Jursa advanced the theory that Nabopolassar was a member of a prominent political family in Uruk, whose members are attested since the reign of Esarhaddon (681–669 BC). To support his theory, Jursa points to a letter from the time of Sinsharishkun, ABL 469, which discusses how the grave and body of Kudurru, a deceased governor of Uruk, was desecrated due to the anti-Assyrian activities of Kudurru&#x27;s two sons, Nabu-shumu-ukin and a son whose name is mostly missing. The desecration went so far as to drag Kudurru&#x27;s body through the streets of Uruk. Kudurru can be identified with Nebuchadnezzar (&quot;Nabû-kudurri-uṣur&quot;, &quot;Kudurru&quot; simply being a common and shortened nickname), a prominent official in Uruk who served as its governor under Ashurbanipal (669–631 BC) in the 640s BC.

In Assyrian tradition, the desecration of a dead body showed that the deceased individual and their surviving family were traitors and enemies of the state, and that they had to be completely eradicated. The desecration of the body itself functioned as a means to punish an enemy even after their death. The name of the son whose name is unpreserved in the letter ended with either &quot;ahi&quot;, &quot;nâsir&quot; or &quot;uṣur&quot;, and the remaining traces can fit with the name &quot;Nabû-apla-uṣur&quot;, meaning that Nabopolassar could be the other son mentioned in the letter and thus a son of Kudurru. Strengthening the case that Kudurru was Nabopolassar&#x27;s father is the name of Nabopolassar&#x27;s son, also Nebuchadnezzar. At this time, Nebuchadnezzar was a very rare name in Babylonia. Since the Babylonians employed patronymics, it is possible that Nabopolassar would have named his son after his father. Before becoming king after Nabopolassar&#x27;s death, Nebuchadnezzar II served as the high priest of the Eanna temple in Uruk, often attested there under the nickname Kudurru, further linking Nabopolassar&#x27;s dynasty both to Uruk and to Kudurru. Additionally, the name of Kudurru&#x27;s second son, Nabu-shumu-ukin, is also the name of a prominent general under Nabopolassar (a role not unlikely to be filled by a family member) and the name of one of Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s sons (possibly another example of a name honoring a relative).

The ancient author Berossus, a native Babylonian historian active in Hellenistic times, centuries after Nabopolassar, described Nabopolassar as a general of Sinsharishkun, who betrayed the Assyrian king. Berossus is not typically considered reliable, but there was ample Assyrian influence within the Neo-Babylonian Empire, with there being considerable continuity within military and court administration. Jursa does not consider this surprising; Nabopolassar&#x27;s ancestors, such as Kudurru, had been pro-Assyrian in their policies (Kudurru even having been appointed by Ashurbanipal himself); Kudurru even fought in Ashurbanipal&#x27;s civil war against his brother Shamash-shum-ukin (designated by their father Esarhaddon as king of Babylon), aiding in the defeat of the latter. Kudurru&#x27;s support for Assyria could explain Nabopolassar&#x27;s unwillingness to mention his father in his inscriptions, and the desecration of his father&#x27;s body additionally meant that Nabopolassar in a literal sense no longer had a father.

=== The Babylonian problem ===
In the middle of the seventh century BC, the Neo-Assyrian Empire ruled the entire Near East. Due to their powerful standing army and their sophisticated administration, the Assyrians had managed to create the best organized and largest empire that the world had yet seen. Though Babylonia in the south had also once been a large kingdom, it had typically been weaker than its northern neighbor due to internal divisions and the lack of a well-organized army. The population of Babylonia was divided into various ethnic groups with different priorities and ideals. Though old native Babylonians ruled most of the cities, such as Kish, Ur, Uruk, Borsippa, Nippur, and Babylon itself, the Chaldean tribes, led by chieftains who often squabbled with each other, dominated most of the southernmost land. The Arameans lived on the fringes of settled land and were notorious for plundering surrounding territories. Because of the infighting of these three major groups, Babylonia often represented an appealing target for Assyrian campaigns. The two kingdoms had competed since the rise of the Middle Assyrian Empire in the 14th century BC, and in the 8th century BC, the Assyrians consistently gained the upper hand. Babylon&#x27;s internal and external weakness led to its conquest by the Assyrian king Tiglath-Pileser III in 729 BC.

During the expansion of Assyria into a major empire, the Assyrians had conquered various neighboring kingdoms, either annexing them as Assyrian provinces or turning them into vassal states. Because the Assyrians venerated the long history and culture of Babylon, it was preserved as a full kingdom, either ruled by an appointed client king, or by the Assyrian king in a personal union. The relationship between Assyria and Babylonia was similar to the relationship between Greece and Rome in later centuries; much of Assyria&#x27;s culture, texts and traditions had been imported from the south. Assyria and Babylonia also shared the same language (Akkadian). The relationship between Assyria and Babylon was emotional in a sense; Neo-Assyrian inscriptions implicitly gender the two countries, calling Assyria the metaphorical &quot;husband&quot; and Babylon its &quot;wife&quot;. In the words of the Assyriologist Eckart Frahm, &quot;the Assyrians were in love with Babylon, but also wished to dominate her&quot;. Though Babylon was respected as the well-spring of civilization, it was expected to remain passive in political matters, something that Assyria&#x27;s &quot;Babylonian bride&quot; repeatedly refused to be.

The Assyrians attempted various strategies to appease their Babylonian subjects throughout the eighth and seventh centuries BC; ranging from violent subjugation through war to direct rule either by the Assyrian king or by a representative (sometimes a relative such as a son or brother). Though there was some success in pacifying the urban population of Babylonians, the Arameans and Chaldeans remained unconvinced and repeatedly rebelled whenever they saw an opportunity. Despite the enormous effort spent in keeping the region, Babylonia was seen as too important economically and strategically to allow to secede, but no matter what the Assyrians attempted, rebellion and civil war was the inevitable result each time. Prolonged Assyrian control of Babylonia proved so impossible that modern researchers have dubbed it the &quot;Babylonian problem&quot;.

In 631 BC, the long-ruling Assyrian king Ashurbanipal died and in 627 BC, he was followed in death by his appointed vassal ruler of Babylonia, Kandalanu. Their deaths ended an about 20-year long period of relative peace and stability. Ashurbanipal was first succeeded by his son Ashur-etil-ilani, but he died in 627 BC at around the same time as Kandalanu, leading to Ashurbanipal&#x27;s other son, Sinsharishkun, assuming the kingship of Assyria. Although it has been suggested by several historians, there is no evidence to prove the idea that Ashur-etil-ilani was deposed in a coup by his brother. Sinsharishkun&#x27;s inscriptions state that he was selected for the kingship from among several of &quot;his equals&quot; (i.e., his brothers) by the gods. Almost immediately after Sinsharishkun&#x27;s rise to the throne, the general Sin-shumu-lishir rebelled. Sin-shumu-lishir took some cities in northern Babylonia, including Nippur and Babylon and ruled there for three months before Sinsharishkun defeated him. Though both of them exercised control there, it is unclear if Sinsharishkun and Sin-shumu-lishir actually claimed the title &quot;king of Babylon&quot; (or only used &quot;king of Assyria&quot;), meaning that Babylonia could have experienced an interregnum of sorts. Modern historians typically include both Sin-shumu-lishir and Sinsharishkun in lists of Babylonian kings, as did some ancient Babylonian king lists.

== Sources ==

As a consequence of the turbulent times in which he reigned, and the violent downfall of Assyria, comparatively few sources survive from Nabopolassar&#x27;s reign. The near-contemporary sources that do survive include two Babylonian chronicles (written from the point of view of the victorious Babylonians); the &quot;Nabopolassar Chronicle&quot; and the &quot;Fall of Nineveh Chronicle&quot;, as well as royal inscriptions and economic and administrative texts. In terms of reconstructing the succession of events in the period of Assyria&#x27;s downfall, the Babylonian chronicles are the most important source, though they do not cover all of Nabopolassar&#x27;s reign, only reveal select facts and are written in a terse and objective style. Around 1,500 administrative and economical texts are known from Nabopolassar&#x27;s reign, most recovered from excavated temple archives in Uruk and Sippar, but they do not record much of events on a geopolitical scale. Inscriptions that record Nabopolassar&#x27;s building projects or his piety, recovered at several sites throughout Babylonia, do not mention much about geopolitical events either.

Later works, such as the works of Berossus, the Bible, and the works of ancient Greek historians such as Ctesias, Herodotus and Xenophon, corroborate details mentioned in the earlier Babylonian sources, but do not offer any meaningful additional commentary or insight.

In terms of dating, several sources can be used to confidently determine the timespan in which Nabopolassar ruled as king of Babylon, chiefly the Uruk King List (also known as King List 5) and the Ptolemaic Canon of Kings. In the Uruk list, the length of the reigns of each Babylonian king, from the 7th to the 3rd century BC, are recorded. The Ptolemaic Canon lists rulers of Babylonia, followed by the Achaemenid Persian kings and the Ptolemaic dynasty of Egypt. As the Canon lists and documents astronomical phenomena, it is an important document for dating events in the entire chronology of the ancient Near East. Contemporary Babylonian astronomical texts can also be used to a certain extent as they record astronomical phenomena and sometimes also political events.

== Reign ==

=== War for Babylonia ===
It is probable that Nabopolassar held some high office in Uruk before his rebellion against Assyria, possibly following the family tradition and serving as the city&#x27;s governor. In early 626 BC, he rose in rebellion against Sinsharishkun. Fighting for the control of Babylonia would drag on for about ten years, and which side had the advantage shifted dramatically back and forth several times.

The timing of the revolt was opportune. Nabopolassar might have used the political instability caused by the revolt of Sin-shumu-lishir a few months prior, as well as the unrest caused by the potentially ongoing interregnum in the south, to his advantage. He began by assaulting both Babylon and Nippur, taking the cities from the garrisons left there by Sinsharishkun. The Assyrian response was swift and in October 626 BC, the Assyrian army recaptured Nippur and laid siege to both Nabopolassar at Uruk and to Babylon itself. Both sieges were repulsed by Nabopolassar&#x27;s forces; the siege of Babylon would be the last time an Assyrian army attempted to take the city.

In the aftermath of the failed Assyrian counterattack, Nabopolassar was formally crowned king of Babylon on 22/23 November 626 BC, restoring Babylonia as an independent kingdom. In 625–623 BC, Sinsharishkun&#x27;s forces again attempted to defeat Nabopolassar, campaigning in northern Babylonia. Initially, these campaigns were successful; in 625 BC the Assyrians took the city of Sippar and Nabopolassar&#x27;s attempted reconquest of Nippur failed. Another of Assyria&#x27;s vassals, Elam, also stopped paying tribute to Assyria during this time and several Babylonian cities, such as Der, revolted and joined Nabopolassar. Realizing the threat this posed, Sinsharishkun led a massive counterattack himself which saw the successful recapture of Uruk in 623 BC.

Sinsharishkun might have ultimately been victorious had it not been for another revolt, led by an Assyrian general in the empire&#x27;s western provinces in 622 BC. This general, whose name remains unknown, took advantage of the absence of Sinsharishkun and the Assyrian army to march on Nineveh, the Assyrian capital, where he met a hastily organized army which surrendered without fighting. The usurper then successfully seized the Assyrian throne. The surrender of the army indicates that the usurper was an Assyrian and possibly even a member of the royal family, or at least a person that would be acceptable as king. Understandably alarmed by this development, Sinsharishkun abandoned his Babylonian campaign and though he successfully defeated the usurper after a hundred days of civil war, the absence of the Assyrian army saw the Babylonians conquer the last remaining Assyrian outposts in Babylonia in 622–620 BC. The Babylonian siege of Uruk had begun by October 622 BC and though control of the ancient city would shift between Assyria and Babylon, it was firmly in Nabopolassar&#x27;s hands by 620 BC. Nippur was also conquered in 620 BC and Nabopolassar pushed the Assyrians out of Babylonia. Though he had successfully driven out the Assyrian army, pro-Assyrian factions still existed in some Babylonian cities, for instance Ur and Nippur, by 617 BC, making Nabopolassar&#x27;s full consolidation of control in the south slow. The fighting in Babylonia in the last stages of the localized conflict turned conditions so desperate in some places that parents sold their children into slavery to avoid them starving to death.

=== Early campaigns into Assyria ===

While unlikely to have been received positively, the end of Assyrian rule in Babylonia would probably not have been regarded as significant to the Assyrians at the time. All fighting had happened in Babylonia and the outcome was not yet decisive, characteristic of previous Assyro-Babylonian conflicts in the Neo-Assyrian period. In previous uprisings, the Babylonians had sometimes temporarily gained the upper hand as well and there was no reason to believe that Nabopolassar&#x27;s success would be anything but a temporary inconvenience.

In 616 BC, Nabopolassar entered Assyrian territory for the first time, leading his armies along the Euphrates river into lands in present-day Syria. As he marched on, he took the Assyrian city Hindanu and reached the Balikh River, where he defeated an Assyrian force near the city Gablinu. Nabpolassar then pushed north, reaching as far as the Khabur River. The Assyrians swiftly regrouped in order to deal with the threat. Realizing that the situation was dire, Assyria&#x27;s ally, Pharaoh Psamtik I of Egypt, marched his troops to aid Sinsharishkun. Psamtik had over the last few years campaigned to establish dominance over the small city-states of the Levant and it was in his interests that Assyria survived as a buffer state between his own empire and those of the Babylonians and Medes in the east. A joint Egyptian-Assyrian campaign to capture the city of Gablinu was undertaken in October of 616 BC, but ended in failure after which the Egyptian allies kept to the west of the Euphrates, only offering limited support. Both the Assyrians and the Babylonians then withdrew, though the Babylonians retained Hindanu and now controlled the middle Euphrates, a major strategical victory and probably the first step in Nabopolassar&#x27;s plan to counteract the possibility of an Assyrian invasion of Babylonia. That Nabopolassar withdrew at the same time as the Assyrians did suggests that the Babylonians were not yet ready to conduct a full invasion of Assyria and that their plans were at this time just to secure Babylonian independence, not to conquer and destroy Assyria.

In March 615 BC, Nabopolassar inflicted a crushing defeat on the Assyrian army at the banks of the Tigris, pushing them back to the Little Zab. This victory weakened Assyrian control of the buffer zone that had been established around the middle of the Tigris river between the two kingdoms, meaning that the Babylonians now controlled lands directly bordering the Assyrian heartland itself.

=== Fall of Assyria ===
In May 615 BC, Nabopolassar and the Babylonians assaulted Assur, the ceremonial and religious center of Assyria and the Assyrian Empire&#x27;s southernmost remaining city. Sinsharishkun swiftly rallied his army and counterattacked, lifting the siege of Assur and forcing Nabopolassar to retreat to the city of Takrit. There, Sinsharishkun besieged Nabopolassar, but he was eventually forced to abandon the siege. Though the conflict had shifted to Assyria becoming the defender, the war was at this point still being fought according to standard Mesopotamian practice, with attacks, counterattacks and retreats and neither side having the confidence or means to force a decisive confrontation. Despite constant defeats and setbacks, the Assyrian army remained powerful and capable of being deployed rapidly.

In late 615 BC or in 614 BC, the Medes under their king Cyaxares entered Assyria and conquered the region around the city of Arrapha in preparation for a campaign against Sinsharishkun. Although there are plenty of earlier sources discussing Assyro-Median relations, none are preserved from the period leading up to Cyaxares&#x27;s invasion and as such, the political context and reasons for the sudden attack are not known. Perhaps, the war between Babylonia and Assyria had disrupted the economy of the Medes and inspired a direct intervention.

In July or August of 614 BC, the Medes mounted attacks on the cities of Nimrud and Nineveh and successfully conquered the city of Tarbisu. They then besieged Assur. This siege was successful and the Medes captured the ancient heart of Assyria, plundering it and killing many of its inhabitants. The brutal sack of Assur came as a shock to people throughout the Near East. Even the Babylonian chronicles, hostile to Assyria, speak of the Medes as unnecessarily brutal, stating that they &quot;inflicted a terrible defeat on a great people, pillaged and looted them and robbed them&quot;. Nabopolassar only arrived at Assur after the plunder had already begun and met with Cyaxares, allying with him and signing an anti-Assyrian pact. The treaty between the Babylonians and Medes was sealed through the marriage of Nabopolassar&#x27;s son and heir, Nebuchadnezzar, and Cyaxares&#x27;s daughter, Amytis. The onset of winter after the fall of Assur meant that both the Medes and Babylonians then returned to their homelands, preparing for further campaigns in the next year. The Assyrians appear to have not recognized the severity of their situation as they did not use the pause in the fighting to fall back into, and prepare, defensive positions. Instead of repairing the damage in Nimrud, the populace there dismantled the walls further to prepare for future renovation work (which would never happen).

In an attempt to keep the enemies out of Assyria, Sinsharishkun went on the offensive in 613 BC, attacking Nabopolassar&#x27;s forces in the middle Euphrates, occupied at the time with suppressing an Assyrian-supported rebellion of a local tribe. Sinshariskun successfully rescued the tribe&#x27;s besieged city of Rahilu, but Nabopolassar&#x27;s army retreated before a battle could take place. Around this time, Sinsharishkun, apparently finally recognizing the disaster that was about to befall his kingdom, sent a letter to Nabopolassar, attempting to broker peace. Sinsharishkun pleaded with Nabopolassar to avoid any more bloodshed and wrote that he should &quot;quiet his fiery heart&quot;. Nabopolassar was not interested; Sinsharishkun had waited too long and there was no longer anything he could offer that the Babylonians and Medes would not be able to take for themselves in battle. A harsh response was sent, in which Nabopolassar declared that &quot;[Nineveh&#x27;s] roots I shall pluck out and the foundations of the land I shall obliterate&quot;. The original tablets containing these letters have not been preserved, with the known text instead having been derived from tablets made during Seleucid times, centuries later. Whether the letters are copies of authentic, more ancient, originals, or fabrications entirely is a matter of debate.

In April or May 612 BC, at the start of Nabopolassar&#x27;s fourteenth year as king of Babylon, the combined Medo-Babylonian army marched on Nineveh. Sinsharishkun rallied his forces to make a final stand at the capital but stood little chance at defending it on account of the city&#x27;s massive size. From June to August 612 BC, the Medo-Babylonian army besieged the Assyrian capital and in August the walls were breached, leading to a lengthy and brutal sack. The city was looted, depictions of the Assyrian kings were mutilated and inhabitants as young as the age of ten were slaughtered en masse before the entire city was razed and burned to the ground. Sinsharishkun&#x27;s fate is not entirely certain but it is commonly accepted that he died in the defense of Nineveh.

The brutal sack of Nineveh was only the beginning; in the aftermath of their victory, the Medes swept through the Assyrian heartland. Cities such as Nimrud, Dur-Sharrukin, Tarbisu, Imgur-Enlil and Khirbet Khatuniyeh were completely destroyed, with only a handful of sites, such as Assur and Arbela, continuing to be populated under later Babylonian and Median rule. The level of the destruction, including the destruction and desecration of Assyria&#x27;s temples, shocked the Babylonians and Nabopolassar. In some inscriptions, Nabopolassar was careful to attribute his victory and its aftermath to divine intervention in attempt to absolve himself of the blame, though other inscriptions were less remorseful, with one reading &quot;I slaughtered the land of Assyria, I turned the hostile land into heaps and ruins&quot;. Later Neo-Babylonian rulers, such as Nabonidus (556–539 BC), blamed the destruction solely on the Medes and Cyaxares, maintaining that Nabopolassar had not destroyed any temples and described him as remorseful of the fate that befell Assyria. Though ultimately victorious, the Babylonians and Medes had violated the normal practices of warfare in the Near East. The destruction of the Assyrian heartland had been so extensive that the region did not even begin to recover until a century later, when it came under the rule of the Achaemenid Empire. Although Nabopolassar did not take the title &quot;king of Assyria&quot;, he first extracted tribute while encamped at the ruins of Nineveh. In 2003, Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley wrote that two of the modern interpretations in regards to the reason for briefly &quot;ruling&quot; from Nineveh are that Nabopolassar either might have wanted to cement himself as the successor of the Assyrian kings, or that taking residence there was an attempt to save what remained of the city from further sacking by the Medes.

=== Ashur-uballit II and the Egyptians ===

The survivors of Nineveh&#x27;s fall followed a new Assyrian ruler, Ashur-uballit II, possibly Sinsharishkun&#x27;s son, to the city of Harran, where they continued to hold out. Although Babylonian sources refer to him as Assyria&#x27;s new king, Ashur-uballit ruled with the title of crown prince (&quot;mar šarri&quot;, literally meaning &quot;son of the king&quot;). In Assyrian tradition, the king was appointed to his position by the Assyrian national deity, Ashur, during the New Year festivals in Assur. The last king to be crowned at the temple of Ashur at Assur had been Sinsharishkun and with the city&#x27;s destruction in 614 BC, the traditional Assyrian coronation ritual was now impossible. Ashur-uballit did have a coronation ceremony in late 612 BC, but instead of conducting it in Assur, it was conducted in the temple of the moon god Sin, another important deity in the empire, at Harran. That he was not formally king does not mean that his claim was challenged by his subjects; like the coronation of a king, the appointment of a crown prince required the formal recognition of all subjects and of the gods. Should the king be unable to exercise his duties, the crown prince was a competent substitute, exercising similar legal and political power. Ashur-uballit was the recognized legitimate ruler, and his title was only a provisional arrangement until he could undergo the proper coronation.

In 611 BC, Nabopolassar&#x27;s army consolidated his rule throughout northern Mesopotamia, going as far as to the border of Harran itself. After Nabopolassar himself had travelled the recently conquered Assyrian heartland in 610 BC in order to ensure stability, the Medo-Babylonian army embarked on a campaign against Harran in November of 610 BC. Intimidated by the approach of the Medo-Babylonian army, Ashur-uballit and a contingent of Egyptian reinforcements fled the city into the deserts of Syria. The siege of Harran lasted from the winter of 610 BC to the beginning of 609 BC and the city eventually capitulated. Ashur-uballit&#x27;s failure at Harran marks the end for the ancient Assyrian monarchy, which would never be restored. After the Babylonians had ruled Harran for three months, Ashur-uballit and a large force of Egyptian soldiers attempted to retake the city, but this campaign failed disastrously. Beginning in July or June 609 BC, Ashur-uballit&#x27;s siege lasted for two months, until August or September, but he and the Egyptians retreated when Nabopolassar again led his army against them. It is possible that they had retreated even earlier. The failed retaking of Harran is the last time Ashur-uballit is mentioned in Babylonian records; his ultimate fate is unknown.

After his victory at Harran, Nabopolassar resumed his campaign against the remainder of the Assyrian army in the beginning of the year 608 or 607 BC. In 608 BC the Egyptian Pharaoh Necho II, Psamtik I&#x27;s successor, personally led a large Egyptian army into former Assyrian territory to rescue what remained of the Assyrians and turn the tide of the war. Though Necho would spend the better part of three years attempting to defeat the Babylonians, the Assyrian Empire had already collapsed and he was fighting for a lost cause.

At Megiddo, Necho easily defeated the king of Judah, Josiah, who had attempted to block his advance into Syria and Mesopotamia. The reason for Josiah deciding to attempt to halt the Egyptian campaign is not known, but he might have been inspired by the Egyptian failure to aid the Assyrians in holding and then recapturing Harran for the Assyrians. According to the Biblical Books of Chronicles, Necho had not intended to do battle with the Judeans and was confused by Josiah&#x27;s decision to attack him, supposedly sending a letter to him which included the passage &quot;what have we done to each other, king of Judah? I am not coming against you this day.&quot;

For much of the period between 609 and 607 BC, Nabopolassar was occupied by a war against the northern Kingdom of Urartu, and in the meantime, the Egyptians took the city of Carchemish in Syria, which Necho established as his base of operations for the course of the campaign. In 606 BC, the Egyptians won several victories at various sites in Syria, such as at the city of Kimuhu, located near Carchemish. The Egyptian war continued until Necho suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Carchemish in 605 BC. According to the Babylonian records of the battle and its aftermath, &quot;not a single man escaped to his country&quot;; Necho&#x27;s forces were completely annihilated. The Babylonian forces at the battle were led by Nabopolassar&#x27;s son and crown prince, Nebuchadnezzar, as Nabopolassar had chosen to stay in Babylon, possibly on account of illness.

=== Nabopolassar victorious ===

With the war against Egypt over, and twenty years of near-constant warfare concluded, Nabopolassar stood victorious, having achieved all of his objectives. Nineveh no longer existed and Assyria would never rise again. The Egyptians no longer represented a threat and the only other major power in the Near East, the Medes, were Nabopolassar&#x27;s allies. Through the defeat of all of Nabopolassar&#x27;s rivals, his Neo-Babylonian Empire had become the uncontested successor of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. For the first time since the Assyrian conquest more than a century prior, tribute flowed into Babylonia rather than being drained from it.

Because Nabopolassar had spent virtually his entire reign at war, pressing affairs in his capital, Babylon, had been more or less neglected. The city had been destroyed by the Neo-Assyrian king Sennacherib in 689 BC, and though it was rebuilt by Sennacherib&#x27;s successor Esarhaddon, it was not rebuilt as the capital of an empire, lacking the necessary headquarters for efficient imperial administration and with religious institutions not as elaborate of those that existed in Assyria. Though early work had been begun by Nabopolassar, much work still lay ahead; a new wall had to be built around the city and the great temples of Babylon, most importantly the Esagila, had to be restored.

It was with this work still ahead of him, on the eve of his final victory, that Nabopolassar died. As he had managed to secure universal recognition for his rule, Nabopolassar was succeeded without any issues by his son and crown prince Nebuchadnezzar, who would finish the building projects left at the time of Nabopolassar&#x27;s death and, in time, surpass his father. At the time of Nabopolassar&#x27;s death, Nebuchadnezzar was still away on campaign and upon hearing the news, he quickly arranged affairs with the Egyptians and rushed back to Babylon. The speed in which Nebuchadnezzar returned to Babylon might be because of the threat of one of his brothers (two are known by name: Nabu-shum-lishir and Nabu-zer-ushabshi) potentially attempting to claim the throne. Though Nebuchadnezzar had been recognized as the eldest son and heir by Nabopolassar, Nabu-shum-lishir had been recognized as &quot;his equal brother&quot;, a dangerously vague title. No attempts at usurpation were made. One of Nebuchadnezzar&#x27;s first acts as king was to bury his father. Nabopolassar was laid in a huge coffin, adorned with ornamented gold plates and fine dresses with golden beads, which was then placed within a small palace he had constructed in Babylon.

== Legacy ==
With the rise of Nabopolassar and the foundation of the Neo-Babylonian Empire, Babylonia entered into a new age of political stability and economic prosperity. In terms of his legacy, archaeologist and historian Rocío Da Riva wrote in 2017 that Nabopolassar&#x27;s exploits and figure are &quot;inextricably linked to the overthrow of the Neo-Assyrian Empire and to the formation and configuration of the Chaldean kingdom&quot;.

Nabopolassar&#x27;s legend survived for centuries and he was long remembered by the Babylonians as the &quot;avenger of Akkad&quot; (i. e. Babylonia) and as a symbol of resistance to domination of foreign empires. Several later texts hold that Nabopolassar was even divinely ordered by Marduk, Babylon&#x27;s chief deity, to avenge Babylonia. During the Hellenistic period, centuries after Nabopolassar&#x27;s death and the eventual collapse of his empire, Babylonian authors used historical royal figures as the subjects of epics and stories to avoid explicit commentary on their contemporary politics. Typically, these historical figures were ancient, and more recent, Assyrian and Babylonian kings, including those of the Neo-Babylonian Empire. Nabopolassar, called Belesys or Bupolasaros by the Hellenistic-era authors, is used in some and is generally cast in a very positive light, described as a pious and just king who, partly through reverence of Marduk, managed to liberate his homeland from the rule of the Assyrian Empire. The antagonist of the Nabopolassar epics is typically Sinsharishkun or Sin-shumu-lishir (who was actually defeated by Sinsharishkun, not Nabopolassar). Texts and chronicles describing Nabopolassar&#x27;s military career were being spread throughout Babylonia in the 5th, and probably also 4th, century BC.

A rare negative portrayal of Nabopolassar has been recovered in a Seleucid-era colophon, which erroneously identifies Nabopolassar as a &quot;king of the Sealand&quot; (the Sealand being the southernmost part of Babylonia, often politically independent or autonomous) and accuses the king of having stolen wooden tablets from temples in Uruk. The contemporary priest of Uruk, Kidin-Ani, alleged that he had seen these tablets on a visit to Elam in the reign of either Seleucus I (305–281 BC) or Antiochus I (281–261 BC). Though the entire story has to be seen as unreliable, it is possible that this particular tale can be related to a passage in the Babylonian chronicles that mention Nabopolassar returning statues of gods to that the Assyrians had stolen from Elam and put in Uruk.

== Titles ==

Some aspects of Nabopolassar&#x27;s royal titulature suggest that he wished to distance himself from the Neo-Assyrian kings, while others suggest the opposite and a wish to establish clear continuity with them. Some prominent Assyrian titles, such as &quot;king of the Four Corners of the World&quot;, were dropped, whereas Nabopolassar assumed others, such as &quot;šarru dannu&quot; (&quot;mighty king&quot;) and the much older Sumerian &quot;king of Sumer and Akkad&quot;. The title of &quot;mighty king&quot; in particular was strongly associated with Assyria, previously only ever having been used by Assyrian rulers. Though the title was not used in any royal inscriptions, i. e. not &quot;officially&quot;, both Nabopolassar and his heir Nebuchadnezzar used the ancient title &quot;king of the Universe&quot; in economical documents.

Nabopolassar not fully being disconnected from his Assyrian predecessors in his titulature is also reflected in his empire&#x27;s administrative structure, which essentially was the same as that of the Neo-Assyrian Empire. That titulature and administration did not change much from Sinsharishkun to Nabopolassar is hardly surprising as virtually the entirety of Nabopolassar&#x27;s reign was spent fighting wars, with little time to devote to other matters. With Nabopolassar&#x27;s use of titles in mind, and the fact that little changed administratively from the Neo-Assyrians to the Neo-Babylonians, it is possible that Nabopolassar represented himself as the legitimate heir to the throne of the Assyrians. Later Babylonian king lists do not clearly separate the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian dynasties in the same way that modern scholars do.

In one of his clay cylinders, Nabopolassar used the titulature presented below. The use of &quot;governor of Babylon&quot; (&quot;šakkanakki Bābili&quot;) rather than &quot;king of Babylon&quot; (&quot;šar Bābili&quot;) was an ancient practice of the Babylonian monarchs and an act of reverence to Marduk, who was formally considered the true king of Babylon. In Nabopolassar&#x27;s inscriptions the usage varied and there are examples where he used &quot;king of Babylon&quot; instead.

<text>The Harlem Globetrotters are an American exhibition basketball team. They combine athleticism, theater, entertainment, and comedy in their style of play. Over the years, they have played more than 26,000 exhibition games in 124 countries and territories, mostly against deliberately ineffective opponents, such as the Washington Generals (1953–1995, since 2015) and the New York Nationals (1995–2015). The team&#x27;s signature song is Brother Bones&#x27; whistled version of &quot;Sweet Georgia Brown&quot;, and their mascot is an anthropomorphized globe named &quot;Globie&quot;. The team is owned by Herschend Family Entertainment.

==History==
The Globetrotters originated in 1926, on the South Side of Chicago, where all the original players were raised. They began as the Savoy Big Five, one of the premier attractions of the Savoy Ballroom; starting in January 1928, a basketball team of Black American players played exhibitions before dances to prop up the ballroom&#x27;s cratering attendance numbers. In 1928, several players left the team in a dispute. That autumn, those players formed a team called the &quot;Globe Trotters&quot; and toured southern Illinois that spring. Abe Saperstein became involved with the team as its manager and promoter. By 1929, Saperstein was touring Illinois and Iowa with his basketball team called the &quot;New York Harlem Globe Trotters&quot;. Saperstein selected the name Harlem because it was then considered the center of Black American culture and the name to mythologize the team&#x27;s international venues.
The Globetrotters were perennial participants in the World Professional Basketball Tournament, winning it in 1940. In a heavily attended matchup a few years later, the 1948 Globetrotters–Lakers game, the Globetrotters made headlines when they beat one of the best white basketball teams in the country, the Minneapolis Lakers. The Globetrotters continued to easily win games due to Harlem monopolizing the entire talent pool of the best black basketball players in the country. Once one of the most famous teams in the country, the Globetrotters were eventually eclipsed by the rise of the National Basketball Association, particularly when NBA teams began recruiting black players in the 1950s. In 1950, Harlem Globetrotter Chuck Cooper became the first black player to be drafted in the NBA by Boston and teammate Nat &quot;Sweetwater&quot; Clifton became the first black player to sign an NBA contract when the New York Knicks purchased his contract from the Globetrotters for $12,500 ().

The Globetrotters gradually worked comic routines into their act—a direction the team has credited to Reece &quot;Goose&quot; Tatum, who joined in 1941—and eventually became known more for entertainment than sports. The Globetrotters&#x27; acts often feature incredible coordination and skillful handling of one or more basketballs, such as passing or juggling balls between players, balancing or spinning balls on their fingertips, and making unusually difficult shots.

In 1952, the Globetrotters invited Louis &quot;Red&quot; Klotz to create a team to accompany them on their tours. This team, the Washington Generals (who also played under various other names), became the Globetrotters&#x27; primary opponents. The Generals are effectively stooges for the Globetrotters, with the Globetrotters handily defeating them in thousands of games.

In 1959, the Globetrotters played nine games in Moscow after Saperstein received an invitation from Vasily Grigoryevich, the director of Lenin Central Stadium. The team, which included Wilt Chamberlain, was welcomed enthusiastically by spectators and authorities, and they met Premier Nikita Khrushchev and collectively received the Athletic Order of Lenin medal.

According to one report titled &quot;Russians Baffled by Harlem Fun&quot;, however, spectators were initially confused: &quot;A Soviet audience of 14,000 sat almost silently, as if in awe, through the first half of the game. It warmed up slightly in the second half when it realized the Trotters are more show than competition.&quot; The Globetrotters brought their own opponent—not the Washington Generals, but the San Francisco Chinese Basketeers. A review in state-run &quot;Pravda&quot; stated, &quot;This is not basketball; it is too full of tricks&quot; but praised the Globetrotters&#x27; skills and suggested that &quot;they have some techniques to show us&quot;.

The American press—particularly Drew Pearson—made note of the fact that the Globetrotters were paid (per game) the equivalent of $4,000 () by the Soviet government, which could be spent only in Moscow. The games were used as evidence that U.S.–Russian relations were improving, that Moscow was backing off its propaganda campaign aimed at American race relations, and that the Russian society was becoming more capitalist (Pearson suggested that the games were held because Lenin Stadium needed money).

In May 1967, New York City–based Metromedia announced that it would acquire the Globetrotters for $1 million, but the deal was never completed and the team was later sold to George N. Gillett Jr., who soon formed a new company called Globetrotter Communications in 1968.

Nine years after the company&#x27;s attempted acquisition in 1976, Metromedia announced that it would re-acquire the Globetrotters for $11 million from Globetrotter Communications.

Many famous basketball players have played for the Globetrotters. Greats such as &quot;Wee&quot; Willie Gardner, Connie &quot;the Hawk&quot; Hawkins, Wilt &quot;the Stilt&quot; Chamberlain, and Nat &quot;Sweetwater&quot; Clifton later joined the NBA. The Globetrotters signed their first female player, Olympic gold medalist Lynette Woodard, in 1985.

Because nearly all of the team&#x27;s players have been black, and as a result of the buffoonery involved in many of the Globetrotters&#x27; skits, they drew some criticism during the Civil Rights era. The players were accused by some civil-rights advocates of &quot;Tomming for Abe,&quot; a reference to Uncle Tom and owner Abe Saperstein. However, prominent civil rights activist Jesse Jackson (who would later be named an honorary Globetrotter) came to their defense by stating, &quot;I think they&#x27;ve been a positive influence... They did not show blacks as stupid. On the contrary, they were shown as superior.&quot;

In 1986, as part of the spin-off of Metromedia&#x27;s television stations to News Corporation and the 20th Century Fox film studio, the company sold the Globetrotters and the Ice Capades to the Minneapolis-based International Broadcasting Corporation (owners of KTAB-TV in Abilene, Texas and controlled by Thomas Scallen) for $30 million.

In 1993, former Globetrotters player Mannie Jackson purchased the team from the International Broadcasting Corporation, which was on the verge of bankruptcy.

In 1995, Orlando Antigua became the first Hispanic player on the team. He was the first non-black player on the Globetrotters&#x27; roster since Bob Karstens played with the squad in 1942–43.

While parts of a modern exhibition game are pre-planned, the games themselves are not fixed. While their opponents do not interfere with the Globetrotters&#x27; hijinks while on defense, they play a serious game when in possession of the ball and about 20 to 30 percent of a game is &quot;real.&quot; This once led to an infamous defeat at the hands of the Washington Generals in 1971, to the distress of the watching crowd, after the Globetrotters lost track of a big lead with their tricks and the Generals hit a game-winning buzzer-beater.

In September 2005, Shamrock Holdings purchased 80% stake in the Globetrotters.

In October 2013, Herschend Family Entertainment announced that it would acquire the Globetrotters from Shamrock Holdings.

In June 2021, the Globetrotters filed a petition to join the National Basketball Association (NBA) as an expansion franchise.

==Draft==
Starting in 2007, the Globetrotters have conducted an annual &quot;draft&quot; a few days before the NBA draft, in which they select players they feel fit the mold of a Globetrotter. Being drafted by the Globetrotters does not guarantee a spot on the team, although several drafted players have gone on to become Globetrotters: Anthony &quot;Ant&quot; Atkinson (2007), Brent Petway (2007), William &quot;Bull&quot; Bullard (2008), Tay &quot;Firefly&quot; Fisher (2008), Charlie Coley III (2009), Paul &quot;Tiny&quot; Sturgess (2011), Jacob &quot;Hops&quot; Tucker (2011), Darnell &quot;Spider&quot; Wilks (2011), Bryan &quot;B-Nice&quot; Narcisse (2012), Tyrone Davis (2013), Corey &quot;Thunder&quot; Law (2013), Tyler &quot;Iceman&quot; Inman (2014) Devan &quot;Beast&quot; Douglas (2016), and AJ &quot;Money&quot; Merriweather.

Other notable draft picks by the Globetrotters include: Sun Mingming (2007), Patrick Ewing Jr. (2008), Sonny Weems (2008), Taylor Griffin (2009), Tim Howard (2009), Mark Titus (2010), Lionel Messi (2011), Jordan McCabe, then 12 years old (2011), Andrew Goudelock (2011), Usain Bolt (2012), Mariano Rivera (2013), Brittney Griner (2013), Johnny Manziel (2014), Landon Donovan (2014), Mo&#x27;ne Davis (2015), Dude Perfect (2015), Kevin Hart (2016), Neymar (2016), Missy Franklin (2016), Jordan Spieth (2016), Craig Sager (2016), Gal Gadot (2017), Aaron Judge (2017), Tim Tebow (2017), Paul Pogba (2018), Joseph Kilgore (2018), Hafþór Júlíus Björnsson (2018), Mahershala Ali (2019), Mookie Betts (2020), and Chadwick Boseman (2020).

==Retired numbers==
The Globetrotters have honored eight players by retiring their numbers:


==Honorary members==

Ten people have been officially named as honorary members of the team:
*Henry Kissinger (1976)
*Bob Hope (1977)
*Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (1989)
*Whoopi Goldberg (1990)
*Nelson Mandela (1996)
*Jackie Joyner-Kersee (1999)
*Pope John Paul II (2000) – Press agent Lee Solters arranged a ceremony orchestrated in front of a crowd of 50,000 in Saint Peter&#x27;s Square in which the Pope was recognized as an honorary Globetrotter.
*Jesse Jackson (2001) 
*Pope Francis (2015)

*Robin Roberts (2015)
In addition, Bill Cosby (1972) and Magic Johnson (2003) were each signed to honorary $1-a-year lifetime contracts with the Globetrotters. When Cosby&#x27;s nominal association with the team was the subject of criticism following sexual assault allegations, the Globetrotters stated that they have had no association with him for decades.

<text>Herb Curtis (born 1949) is a Canadian novelist and humorist who writes about and has long lived in New Brunswick. He is best known for writing the Brennen Siding Trilogy, three connected novels set in the fictional community of Brennen Siding, New Brunswick (loosely based on Kennan Siding, New Brunswick). The trilogy consists of the novels &quot;The Americans are Coming&quot;, &quot;The Last Tasmanian&quot; and &quot;The Lone Angler&quot;. The most critically acclaimed of the series is &quot;The Last Tasmanian&quot; which won the 1992 Thomas Head Raddall Award and was nominated for the Commonwealth Prize. In 1999, Curtis was nominated for the Stephen Leacock Memorial Medal for Humour for his collection of humorous stories, &quot;Luther Corhern&#x27;s Salmon Camp Chronicles&quot; and in January 2018 he was presented with the prestigious Sesquicentennial Medal in recognition of his valuable service to the nation. 

Curtis grew up near Blackville, New Brunswick, and currently resides in Fredericton. His novels &quot;The Americans are Coming&quot; and &quot;The Last Tasmanian&quot; have both been adapted for the stage, and the former has also become and a standard text in schools throughout Atlantic Canada and Quebec. In 2006, Curtis was a contributing author to &quot;The Penguin Anthology of Canadian Humour&quot;.

<doc id="255591" wikidata="Q207650" url="?curid=255591" title="Autodidacticism">
<text>Autodidacticism (also autodidactism) or self-education (also self-learning, self-study and self-teaching) is the practice of education without the guidance of schoolmasters (i.e., teachers, professors, institutions).

== Overview ==


Autodidacts are &quot;self-taught&quot; humans who learn a subject-of-study&#x27;s aboutness through self-study. This educative praxis (process) may involve, complement, or be an alternative to formal education. Formal education itself may have a hidden curriculum that requires self-study for the uninitiated.

Generally, autodidacts are individuals who choose the subject they will study, their studying material, and the studying rhythm and time. Autodidacts may or may not have formal education, and their study may be either a complement or an alternative to formal education. Many notable contributions have been made by autodidacts.

The self-learning curriculum is infinite. One may seek out alternative pathways in education and use these to gain competency; self-study may meet some prerequisite-curricula criteria for experiential education or apprenticeship.

Self-education techniques used in self-study can include reading educational books or websites, watching educational videos and listening to educational audio recordings, or by visiting infoshops. One uses some space as a learning space, where one uses critical thinking to develop study skills within the broader learning environment until they&#x27;ve reached an academic comfort zone.

== Etymology ==
The term has its roots in the Ancient Greek words (, ) and (, ). The related term &quot;didacticism&quot; defines an artistic philosophy of education.

== Terminology ==

Various terms are used to describe self-education. One such is heutagogy, coined in 2000 by Stewart Hase and Chris Kenyon of Southern Cross University in Australia; others are self-directed learning and self-determined learning. In the heutagogy paradigm, a learner should be at the centre of their own learning. A truly self-determined learning approach also sees the heutagogic learner exploring different approaches to knowledge in order to learn; there is an element of experimentation underpinned by a personal curiosity.

&quot;Andragogy&quot; &quot;strive[s] for autonomy and self-direction in learning&quot;, while &quot;Heutagogy&quot; &quot;identif[ies] the potential to learn from novel experiences as a matter of course [...] manage their own learning&quot;. &quot;Ubuntugogy&quot; is a type of cosmopolitanism that has a collectivist ethics of awareness concerning the African diaspora.

==Modern era==

Autodidacticism is sometimes a complement of modern formal education. As a complement to formal education, students would be encouraged to do more independent work. The Industrial Revolution created a new situation for self-directed learners.

Before the twentieth century, only a small minority of people received an advanced academic education. As stated by Joseph Whitworth in his influential report on industry dated from 1853, literacy rates were higher in the United States. However, even in the U.S., most children were not completing high school. High school education was necessary to become a teacher. In modern times, a larger percentage of those completing high school also attended college, usually to pursue a professional degree, such as law or medicine, or a divinity degree.

Collegiate teaching was based on the classics (Latin, philosophy, ancient history, theology) until the early nineteenth century. There were few if any institutions of higher learning offering studies in engineering or science before 1800. Institutions such as the Royal Society did much to promote scientific learning, including public lectures. In England, there were also itinerant lecturers offering their service, typically for a fee.

Prior to the nineteenth century, there were many important inventors working as millwrights or mechanics who, typically, had received an elementary education and served an apprenticeship. Mechanics, instrument makers and surveyors had various mathematics training. James Watt was a surveyor and instrument maker and is described as being &quot;largely self-educated&quot;. Watt, like some other autodidacts of the time, became a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the Lunar Society. In the eighteenth century these societies often gave public lectures and were instrumental in teaching chemistry and other sciences with industrial applications which were neglected by traditional universities. Academies also arose to provide scientific and technical training.

Years of schooling in the United States began to increase sharply in the early twentieth century. This phenomenon was seemingly related to increasing mechanization displacing child labor. The automated glass bottle-making machine is said to have done more for education than child labor laws because boys were no longer needed to assist. However, the number of boys employed in this particular industry was not that large; it was mechanization in several sectors of industry that displaced child labor toward education. For males in the U.S. born 1886–90, years of school averaged 7.86, while for those born in 1926–30, years of school averaged 11.46.

One of the most recent trends in education is that the classroom environment should cater towards students&#x27; individual needs, goals, and interests. This model adopts the idea of inquiry-based learning where students are presented with scenarios to identify their own research, questions and knowledge regarding the area. As a form of discovery learning, students in today&#x27;s classrooms are being provided with more opportunity to &quot;experience and interact&quot; with knowledge, which has its roots in autodidacticism.

Successful self-teaching can require self-discipline and reflective capability. Some research suggests that the ability to regulate one&#x27;s own learning may need to be modeled to some students so that they become active learners, while others learn dynamically via a process outside conscious control. To interact with the environment, a framework has been identified to determine the components of any learning system: a reward function, incremental action value functions and action selection methods. Rewards work best in motivating learning when they are specifically chosen on an individual student basis. New knowledge must be incorporated into previously existing information as its value is to be assessed. Ultimately, these scaffolding techniques, as described by Vygotsky (1978) and problem solving methods are a result of dynamic decision making.

In his book &quot;Deschooling Society&quot;, philosopher Ivan Illich strongly criticized 20th-century educational culture and the institutionalization of knowledge and learning - arguing that institutional schooling as such is an irretrievably flawed model of education - advocating instead ad-hoc co-operative networks through which autodidacts could find others interested in teaching themselves a given skill or about a given topic, supporting one another by pooling resources, materials, and knowledge.

Secular and modern societies have given foundations for new systems of education and new kinds of autodidacts. As Internet access has become more widespread the World Wide Web (explored using search engines such as Google) in general, and websites such as Wikipedia (including parts of it that were included in a book or referenced in a reading list), YouTube, Udemy, Udacity and Khan Academy in particular, have developed as learning centers for many people to actively and freely learn together. Organizations like The Alliance for Self-Directed Education (ASDE) have been formed to publicize and provide guidance for self-directed education. Entrepreneurs like Henry Ford, Steve Jobs, and Bill Gates are considered influential self-teachers.

==History==


The first philosophical claim supporting an autodidactic program to the study of nature and God was in the philosophical novel &quot;Hayy ibn Yaqdhan&quot; (Alive son of the Vigilant), whose titular hero is considered the archetypal autodidact. The story is a medieval autodidactic utopia, a philosophical treatise in a literary form, which was written by the Andalusian philosopher Ibn Tufail in the 1160s in Marrakesh. It is a story about a feral boy, an autodidact prodigy who masters nature through instruments and reason, discovers laws of nature by practical exploration and experiments, and gains &quot;summum bonum&quot; through a mystical mediation and communion with God. The hero rises from his initial state of &quot;tabula rasa&quot; to a mystical or direct experience of God after passing through the necessary natural experiences. The focal point of the story is that human reason, unaided by society and its conventions or by religion, can achieve scientific knowledge, preparing the way to the mystical or highest form of human knowledge.

Commonly translated as &quot;The Self-Taught Philosopher&quot; or &quot;The Improvement of Human Reason&quot;, Ibn-Tufayl&#x27;s story &quot;Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan&quot; inspired debates about autodidacticism in a range of historical fields from classical Islamic philosophy through Renaissance humanism and the European Enlightenment. In his book &quot;Reading Hayy Ibn-Yaqzan: a Cross-Cultural History of Autodidacticism,&quot; Avner Ben-Zaken showed how the text traveled from late medieval Andalusia to early modern Europe and demonstrated the intricate ways in which autodidacticism was contested in and adapted to diverse cultural settings.

Autodidacticism apparently intertwined with struggles over Sufism in twelfth-century Marrakesh; controversies about the role of philosophy in pedagogy in fourteenth-century Barcelona; quarrels concerning astrology in Renaissance Florence in which Pico della Mirandola pleads for autodidacticism against the strong authority of intellectual establishment notions of predestination; and debates pertaining to experimentalism in seventeenth-century Oxford. Pleas for autodidacticism echoed not only within close philosophical discussions; they surfaced in struggles for control between individuals and establishments.

In the story of Black American self-education, Heather Andrea Williams presents a historical account to examine Black American&#x27;s relationship to literacy during slavery, the Civil War and the first decades of freedom. Many of the personal accounts tell of individuals who have had to teach themselves due to racial discrimination in education.
==In architecture==
Many successful and influential architects, such as Mies van der Rohe, Frank Lloyd Wright, Violet-Le-Duc, Tadao Ando were self-taught.

There are very few countries allowing autodidacticism in architecture today. The practice of architecture or the use of the title &quot;architect&quot;, are now protected in most countries.

Self-taught architects have generally studied and qualified in other fields such as engineering or arts and crafts. Jean Prouvé was first a structural engineer. Le Corbusier had an academic qualification in decorative arts. Tadao Ando started his career as a draftsman, and Eileen Gray studied fine arts.

When a political state starts to implement restrictions on the profession, there are issues related to the rights of established self-taught architects. In most countries the legislation includes a grandfather clause, authorising established self-taught architects to continue practicing. In the UK, the legislation allowed self-trained architects with two years of experience to register. In France, it allowed self-trained architects with five years of experience to register. In Belgium, the law allowed experienced self-trained architects in practice to register. In Italy, it allowed self-trained architects with 10 years of experience to register. In The Netherlands, the &quot;&quot; along with additional procedures, allowed architects with 10 years of experience and architects aged 40 years old or over, with 5 years of experience, to access the register.

However, other sovereign states chose to omit such a clause, and many established and competent practitioners were stripped of their professional rights. In the Republic of Ireland, a group named &quot;Architects&#x27; Alliance of Ireland&quot; is defending the interests of long-established self-trained architects who were deprived of their rights to practice as per Part 3 of the Irish Building Control Act 2007.

Theoretical research such as &quot;Architecture of Change, Sustainability and Humanity in the Built Environment&quot; or older studies such as &quot;Vers une Architecture&quot; from Le Corbusier describe the practice of architecture as an environment changing with new technologies, sciences, and legislation. All architects must be autodidacts to keep up to date with new standards, regulations, or methods.

Self-taught architects such as Eileen Gray, Luis Barragán, and many others, created a system where working is also learning, where self-education is associated with creativity and productivity within a working environment.

While he was primarily interested in naval architecture, William Francis Gibbs learned his profession through his own study of battleships and ocean liners. Through his life he could be seen examining and changing the designs of ships that were already built, that is, until he started his firm Gibbs and Cox.
== Predictors ==
Openness is the largest predictor of self-directed learning out of the Big Five personality traits, though, in a study, personality only explained 10% of the variance in self-directed learning.

==Future role==
The role of self-directed learning continues to be investigated in learning approaches, along with other important goals of education, such as content knowledge, epistemic practices and collaboration. As colleges and universities offer distance learning degree programs and secondary schools provide cyber school options for K–12 students, technology provides numerous resources that enable individuals to have a self-directed learning experience. Several studies show these programs function most effectively when the &quot;teacher&quot; or facilitator is a full owner of virtual space to encourage a broad range of experiences to come together in an online format. This allows self-directed learning to encompass both a chosen path of information inquiry, self-regulation methods and reflective discussion among experts as well as novices in a given area. Furthermore, massive open online courses (MOOCs) make autodidacticism easier and thus more common.

A 2016 Stack Overflow poll reported that due to the rise of autodidacticism, 69.1% of software developers appear to be self-taught.

==Notable individuals==
Some notable autodidacts can be broadly grouped in the following interdisciplinary areas:
* Artists and authors
* Actors, musicians, and other artists
* Architects
* Engineers and inventors
* Scientists, historians, and educators

<doc id="255594" wikidata="Q7302789" url="?curid=255594" title="Reconstruction conjecture">
<text>Informally, the reconstruction conjecture in graph theory says that graphs are determined uniquely by their subgraphs. It is due to Kelly and Ulam.

== Formal statements ==

Given a graph formula_1, a vertex-deleted subgraph of formula_2 is a subgraph formed by deleting exactly one vertex from formula_2. By definition, it is an induced subgraph of formula_2.

For a graph formula_2, the deck of G, denoted formula_6, is the multiset of isomorphism classes of all vertex-deleted subgraphs of formula_2. Each graph in formula_6 is called a card. Two graphs that have the same deck are said to be hypomorphic.

With these definitions, the conjecture can be stated as:

* Reconstruction Conjecture: Any two hypomorphic graphs on at least three vertices are isomorphic.

: (The requirement that the graphs have at least three vertices is necessary because both graphs on two vertices have the same decks.)

Harary suggested a stronger version of the conjecture:

* Set Reconstruction Conjecture: Any two graphs on at least four vertices with the same sets of vertex-deleted subgraphs are isomorphic.

Given a graph formula_1, an edge-deleted subgraph of formula_2 is a subgraph formed by deleting exactly one edge from formula_2.

For a graph formula_2, the edge-deck of G, denoted formula_13, is the multiset of all isomorphism classes of edge-deleted subgraphs of formula_2. Each graph in formula_13 is called an edge-card.

* Edge Reconstruction Conjecture: (Harary, 1964) Any two graphs with at least four edges and having the same edge-decks are isomorphic.

==Recognizable properties==

In context of the reconstruction conjecture, a graph property is called recognizable if one can determine the property from the deck of a graph. The following properties of graphs are recognizable:

*Order of the graph – The order of a graph formula_2, formula_17 is recognizable from formula_6 as the multiset formula_6 contains each subgraph of formula_2 created by deleting one vertex of formula_2. Hence formula_22 
*Number of edges of the graph – The number of edges in a graph formula_2 with formula_24 vertices, formula_25 is recognizable. First note that each edge of formula_2 occurs in formula_27 members of formula_6. This is true by the definition of formula_6 which ensures that each edge is included every time that each of the vertices it is incident with is included in a member of formula_6, so an edge will occur in every member of formula_6 except for the two in which its endpoints are deleted. Hence, formula_32 where formula_33 is the number of edges in the &quot;i&quot;th member of formula_6.
*Degree sequence – The degree sequence of a graph formula_2 is recognizable because the degree of every vertex is recognizable. To find the degree of a vertex formula_36—the vertex absent from the &quot;i&quot;th member of formula_6—, we will examine the graph created by deleting it, formula_38. This graph contains all of the edges not incident with formula_36, so if formula_33 is the number of edges in formula_38, then formula_42. If we can tell the degree of every vertex in the graph, we can tell the degree sequence of the graph.
*(Vertex-)Connectivity – By definition, a graph is formula_24-vertex-connected when deleting any vertex creates a formula_44-vertex-connected graph; thus, if every card is a formula_44-vertex-connected graph, we know the original graph was formula_24-vertex-connected. We can also determine if the original graph was connected, as this is equivalent to having any two of the formula_38 being connected.

==Verification==

Both the reconstruction and set reconstruction conjectures have been verified for all graphs with at most 13 vertices by Brendan McKay.

In a probabilistic sense, it has been shown by Béla Bollobás that almost all graphs are reconstructible. This means that the probability that a randomly chosen graph on formula_24 vertices is not reconstructible goes to 0 as formula_24 goes to infinity. In fact, it was shown that not only are almost all graphs reconstructible, but in fact that the entire deck is not necessary to reconstruct them — almost all graphs have the property that there exist three cards in their deck that uniquely determine the graph.

===Reconstructible graph families===

The conjecture has been verified for a number of infinite classes of graphs (and, trivially, their complements).

*Regular graphs - Regular Graphs are reconstructible by direct application of some of the facts that can be recognized from the deck of a graph. Given an formula_24-regular graph formula_2 and its deck formula_6, we can recognize that the deck is of a regular graph by recognizing its degree sequence. Let us now examine one member of the deck formula_6, formula_38. This graph contains some number of vertices with a degree of formula_24 and formula_24 vertices with a degree of formula_44. We can add a vertex to this graph and then connect it to the formula_24 vertices of degree formula_44 to create an formula_24-regular graph which is isomorphic to the graph which we started with. Therefore, all regular graphs are reconstructible from their decks. A particular type of regular graph which is interesting is the complete graph. 
*Trees
*Disconnected graphs
*Unit interval graphs 
*Separable graphs without end vertices
*Maximal planar graphs
*Maximal outerplanar graphs
*Outerplanar graphs
*Critical blocks

==Reduction==
The reconstruction conjecture is true if all 2-connected graphs are reconstructible.

==Duality==

The vertex reconstruction conjecture obeys the duality that if formula_2 can be reconstructed from its vertex deck formula_6, then its complement formula_63 can be reconstructed from formula_64 as follows: Start with formula_64, take the complement of every card in it to get formula_6, use this to reconstruct formula_2, then take the complement again to get formula_63.

Edge reconstruction does not obey any such duality: Indeed, for some classes of edge-reconstructible graphs it is not known if their complements are edge reconstructible.

==Other structures==

It has been shown that the following are not in general reconstructible:

* Digraphs: Infinite families of non-reconstructible digraphs are known, including tournaments (Stockmeyer) and non-tournaments (Stockmeyer). A tournament is reconstructible if it is not strongly connected. A weaker version of the reconstruction conjecture has been conjectured for digraphs, see new digraph reconstruction conjecture.
* Hypergraphs (Kocay).
* Infinite graphs. If &quot;T&quot; is the tree where every vertex has countably infinite degree, then the union of two disjoint copies of &quot;T&quot; is hypomorphic, but not isomorphic, to &quot;T&quot;.
* Locally finite graphs, which are graphs where every vertex has finite degree. The question of reconstructibility for locally finite infinite trees (the Harary-Schwenk-Scott conjecture from 1972) was a longstanding open problem until 2017, when a non-reconstructible tree of maximum degree 3 was found by Bowler et al.

<doc id="255597" wikidata="Q1251403" url="?curid=255597" title="Alley">
<text>An alley or alleyway is a narrow lane, path, or passageway, often reserved for pedestrians, which usually runs between, behind, or within buildings in towns and cities. It is also a rear access or service road (back lane), or a path, walk, or avenue (French allée) in a park or garden.

A covered alley or passageway, often with shops, may be called an arcade. The origin of the word alley is late Middle English, from &quot;walking or passage&quot;, from &quot;&quot; &quot;to go&quot;, from &quot;to walk&quot;.

== Definition ==

The word alley is used in two main ways:
# It can refer to a narrow, usually paved, pedestrian path, often between the walls of buildings in towns and cities. This type is usually short and straight, and on steep ground can consist partially or entirely of steps.
# It also describes a very narrow, urban street, or lane, usually paved, which may be used by slow-moving local traffic, though more pedestrian-friendly than a regular street. There are two versions of this kind of alley:
#* A rear access or service road (back lane), which can also sometimes act as part a secondary vehicular network. Many Americans and Canadians think of an alley in these terms first.
#* A narrow street running between houses or businesses. This type of alley is found in the older parts of many cities, including American cities like Philadelphia and Boston (see Elfreth&#x27;s Alley, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania). Many are open to local traffic.

In landscaping, an &quot;allée&quot; or &quot;avenue&quot; is traditionally a straight route with a line of trees or large shrubs running along each side. In most cases, the trees planted in an avenue will be all of the same species or cultivar, so as to give uniform appearance along the full length of the avenue. The French term &quot;allée&quot; is used for avenues planted in parks and landscape gardens, as well as boulevards such as the &quot;Grand Allée&quot; in Quebec City, Canada, and &quot;Karl-Marx-Allee&quot; in Berlin.

In older cities and towns in Europe, alleys are often what is left of a medieval street network, or a right of way or ancient footpath. Similar paths also exist in some older North American towns and cities. In some older urban development in North America lanes at the rear of houses, to allow for deliveries and garbage collection, are called alleys. Alleys and ginnels were also the product of the 1875 Public Health Act in the United Kingdom, where usually alleys run along the back of streets of terraced houses, with ginnels connecting them to the street every fifth house. Alleys may be paved, or unpaved, and a blind alley is a cul-de-sac. Modern urban developments may also provide a service road to allow for waste collection, or rear access for fire engines and parking.

=== Steps and stairs ===
Because of geography, steps (stairs) are the predominant form of alley in hilly cities and towns. This includes Quebec City in Canada and in the United States Pittsburgh (see Steps of Pittsburgh), Cincinnati (see Steps of Cincinnati), Minneapolis, Seattle, and San Francisco as well as Hong Kong, Genoa and Rome.

=== Covered passages ===
Arcades are another kind of covered passageway and the simplest kind are no more than alleys to which a glass roof was added later. Early examples of a shopping arcades include: Palais Royal in Paris (opened in 1784); Passage de Feydeau in Paris (opened in 1791). Most arcades differ from alleys in that they are architectural structures built with a commercial purpose and are a form of shopping mall. All the same alleys have for long been associated with various types of businesses, especially pubs and coffee houses. Bazaars and Souqs are an early form of arcade found in Asia and North Africa.

Some alleys are roofed because they are within buildings, such as the traboules of Lyon, or when they are a pedestrian passage through railway embankments in Britain. The latter follow the line of rights-of way that existed before the railway was built.

The Burlington Arcade (1819) was one of London&#x27;s earliest covered shopping arcades. It was the successful prototype for larger glazed shopping arcades, beginning with the Saint-Hubert Gallery (1847) in Brussels and The Passage (1848) in St Petersburg, the first of Europe&#x27;s grand arcades, to the Galleria Umberto I (1891) in Naples, the Galleria Vittorio Emanuele II in Milan (1867), and the Block Arcade, Melbourne, Australia (1893).

== By country ==
=== Asia ===

Alleyways are an understudied urban form historically shared by most Asian cities. They provide a setting for much everyday urban life and place-based identity, the examination of which can shed new light on the traditional idea of a global city and contributes to a renewed conception of metropolization as a highly localized process.

==== China ====
Hutongs () are a type of narrow streets or alleys, commonly associated with northern Chinese cities, most prominently Beijing.

In Beijing, hutongs are alleys formed by lines of &quot;siheyuan&quot;, traditional courtyard residences. Many neighbourhoods were formed by joining one &quot;siheyuan&quot; to another to form a hutong, and then joining one hutong to another. The word hutong is also used to refer to such neighbourhoods.
During China&#x27;s dynastic period, emperors planned the city of Beijing and arranged the residential areas according to the social classes of the Zhou dynasty (1027–256 BC). The term &quot;hutong&quot; appeared first during the Yuan dynasty, and is a term of Mongolian origin meaning &quot;town&quot;.

At the turn of the 20th century, the Qing court was disintegrating as China&#x27;s dynastic era came to an end. The traditional arrangement of hutongs was also affected. Many new hutongs, built haphazardly and with no apparent plan, began to appear on the outskirts of the old city, while the old ones lost their former neat appearance.

Following the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949, many of the old hutongs of Beijing disappeared, replaced by wide boulevards and high rises. Many residents left the lanes where their families lived for generations for apartment buildings with modern amenities. In Xicheng District, for example, nearly 200 hutongs out of the 820 it held in 1949 have disappeared. However, many of Beijing&#x27;s ancient hutongs still stand, and a number of them have been designated protected areas. Many hutongs, some several hundred years old, in the vicinity of the Bell Tower and Drum Tower and Shichahai Lake are preserved amongst recreated contemporary two- and three-storey versions.
Hutongs represent an important cultural element of the city of Beijing and the hutongs are residential neighborhoods which still form the heart of Old Beijing. While most Beijing hutongs are straight, Jiudaowan (九道弯, literally &quot;Nine Turns&quot;) Hutong turns nineteen times. At its narrowest section, Qianshi Hutong near Qianmen (Front Gate) is only 40 centimeters (16 inches) wide.

The Shanghai longtang is loosely equivalent to the hutong of Beijing. A longtang (弄堂 &quot;lòngtáng&quot;, Shanghainese: &quot;longdang&quot;) is a laneway in Shanghai and, by extension, a community centred on a laneway or several interconnected laneways. On its own long (traditional Chinese 衖 or 弄, simplified Chinese 弄) is a Chinese term for &quot;alley&quot; or &quot;lane&quot;, which is often left untranslated in Chinese addresses, but may also be translated as &quot;lane&quot;, and &quot;tang&quot; is a parlor or hallway. It is sometimes called lilong (里弄); the latter name incorporates the &quot;-li&quot; suffix often used in the name of residential developments in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. As with the term hutong, the Shanghai longdang can either refers to the lanes that the houses face onto, or a group of houses connected by the lane.

==== Japan ====
 is a small area of Shinjuku, Tokyo, Japan, famous both as an area of architectural interest and for its nightlife. It is composed of a network of six narrow alleys, connected by even narrower passageways which are just about wide enough for a single person to pass through. Over 200 tiny shanty-style bars, clubs and eateries are squeezed into this area.

Its architectural importance is that it provides a view into the relatively recent past of Tokyo, when large parts of the city resembled present-day Golden Gai, particularly in terms of the extremely narrow lanes and the tiny two-storey buildings. Nowadays, most of the surrounding area has been redeveloped. Typically, the buildings are just a few feet wide and are built so close to the ones next door that they nearly touch. Most are two-storey, having a small bar at street level and either another bar or a tiny flat upstairs, reached by a steep set of stairs. None of the bars are very large; some are so small that they can only fit five or so customers at one time. The buildings are generally ramshackle, and the alleys are dimly lit, giving the area a very scruffy and run-down appearance. However, Golden Gai is not a cheap place to drink, and the clientele that it attracts is generally well off.

Golden Gai is well known yokocho and meeting place for musicians, artists, directors, writers, academics and actors, including many celebrities. Many of the bars only welcome regular customers, who initially should be introduced by an existing patron, although many others welcome non-regulars, some even making efforts to attract overseas tourists by displaying signs and price lists in English. Golden Gai was known for prostitution before 1958, when prostitution became illegal. Since then it has developed as a drinking area, and at least some of the bars can trace their origins back to the 1960s.

Apart from drinking alleys (drinking yokocho), shotengai and yokocho shotengais, there are the ordinary alleyways, the rojis which seem exist in all parts of the Japanese urban landscape. The roji which was once part of people&#x27;s personal spatial sphere and everyday life has been transformed by diverse and competing interests. Marginalised through the emergence of new forms of housing and public spaces, re-appropriated by different fields, and re-invented by the contemporary urban design discourse, the social meaning attached to the roji is being re-interpreted by individuals, subcultures and new social movements. Thus, their existence is in danger.

==== Vietnam ====
Hẻm/Ngõ alleyways are a Vietnamese vernacular urban planning typology, common in Ho Chi Minh City and Hanoi.

=== Australia ===
Sydney features a series of laneways in its central business district that have been used to provide off-street vehicular access to city buildings and alternative pedestrian routes through city blocks, in addition to featuring street art, cafes, restaurants, bars and retail outlets. The Rocks has the most prominent and historical laneways in Sydney, which date to the 19th century. &quot;Forgotten Songs&quot; is a popular attraction situated in Angel Place. Chinatown features a number of lanes and alleyways. In suburban Sydney, several alleyways or laneways exist between residential lots that provide pedestrians a shortcut passage to nearby facilities on adjacent roads.

The Melbourne central business district in is home to many lanes and arcades. These laneways date mostly from the Victorian era, and are a popular cultural attraction for their cafes, bars and street art. The city&#x27;s oldest laneways are a result of Melbourne&#x27;s original urban plan, the 1837 Hoddle Grid, and were designed as access routes to service properties fronting the CBD&#x27;s major thoroughfares. St Jerome&#x27;s Laneway Festival, often referred to simply as Laneway, is a popular music festival that began in 2004 in Melbourne&#x27;s laneways.

The lanes and arcades of Perth, Western Australia are together becoming culturally significant to the city. In 2007 modification to Liquor Licensing Regulations in Western Australia opened up the opportunities for small bars. This was followed in August 2008 by the City of Perth formally adopting a laneways enhancement strategy, &quot;Forgotten Spaces – Revitalising Perth&#x27;s Laneways&quot;.

=== Europe ===
==== Belgium ====
In Belgium the equivalent term is &quot;gang&quot; (Dutch) or &quot;impasse&quot; (French). Brussels had over 100 &quot;gangen/impasses&quot;, built to provide pedestrian access to cheap housing in the middle of blocks of buildings, and often containing a communal water tap. Several lead off Rue Haute/Hoogstraat. Since 1858, many have been demolished as part of slum clearance programmes, but about 70 still exist. Some have been gentrified, for example the Rue de la Cigogne/Ooievaarstraat.

==== Germany ====

The old town of Lübeck has over 100 &quot;Gänge&quot;, particularly leading off the streets Engelswisch, Engelsgrube and Glockengießerstraße, as well as around the cathedral. Some are very low as well as narrow, and others open into more spacious courtyards (&quot;Höfe&quot;).
&quot;Spreuerhofstraße&quot; is the world&#x27;s narrowest street, found in the city of Reutlingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It ranges from at its narrowest to at its widest. The lane was built in 1727 during the reconstruction efforts after the area was completely destroyed in the massive citywide fire of 1726 and is officially listed in the Land-Registry Office as City Street Number 77.
Lintgasse is an alley () in the Old town of Cologne, Germany between the two squares of &quot;Alter Markt&quot; and &quot;Fischmarkt&quot;. It is a pedestrian zone and though only some 130 metres long, is nevertheless famous for its medieval history. The Lintgasse was first mentioned in the 12th century as &quot;in Lintgazzin&quot;, which may be derived from basketmakers who wove fish baskets out of Linden tree barks. These craftsmen were called &quot;Lindslizer&quot;, meaning &quot;Linden splitter&quot;. During the Middle Ages, the area was also known as &quot;platēa subri&quot; or &quot;platēa suberis&quot;, meaning street of &quot;Quercus suber&quot;, the cork oak tree. Lintgasse 8 to 14 used to be homes of medieval knights as still can be seen by signs like &quot;Zum Huynen&quot;, &quot;Zum Ritter&quot; or &quot;Zum Gir&quot;. During the 19th-century the Lintgasse was called &quot;Stink-Linkgaß&quot;, a because of its poor air quality.

==== France ====
===== Lyon&#x27;s traboules =====

The &quot;traboules&quot; of Lyon are passageways that cut through a house or, in some cases, a whole city block, linking one street with another. They are distinct from most other alleys in that they are mainly enclosed within buildings and may include staircases. While they are found in other French cities including Villefranche-sur-Saône, Mâcon, Chambéry, Saint-Étienne, Louhans, Chalon sur Saône and Vienne (Isère), Lyon has many more; in all there are about 500.

The word &quot;traboule&quot; comes from the Latin &quot;trans ambulare&quot;, meaning &quot;to cross&quot;, and the first of them were possibly built as early as the 4th century. As the Roman Empire disintegrated, the residents of early Lyon—Lugdunum, the capital of Roman Gaul—were forced to move from the Fourvière hill to the banks of the river Saône when their aqueducts began to fail. The traboules grew up alongside their new homes, linking the streets that run parallel to the river Saône and going down to the river itself. For centuries they were used by people to fetch water from the river and then by craftsmen and traders to transport their goods. By the 18th century they were invaluable to what had become the city&#x27;s defining industry, textiles, especially silk.

Nowadays, traboules are tourist attractions, and many are free and open to the public. Most traboules are on private property, serving as entrances to local apartments.

==== Italy ====
The common Italian word for an alley is &quot;vicolo&quot;.

===== Venice =====

Venice is largely a traffic free city and there is, in addition to the canals, a maze of around 3000 lanes and alleys called &quot;calli&quot; (which means narrow). Smaller ones are &quot;callètte&quot; or &quot;callesèlle&quot;, while larger ones are &quot;calli large&quot;. Their width varies from just over to . The narrowest is Calletta Varisco, which just ; Calle Stretta is wide and Calle Ca&#x27; Zusto . The main ones are also called &quot;salizada&quot; and wider &quot;calli&quot;, where trade proliferates, are called &quot;riga&quot;, while blind &quot;calli&quot;, used only by residents to reach their homes, are &quot;ramo&quot;.

==== Netherlands ====
Cities such as Amsterdam and Groningen have numerous &quot;gangen&quot; or &quot;stegen&quot;. They often run between the major streets, roughly parallel to each other but not at right angles to the streets, following the old field boundaries and ditches.

==== Sweden ====

&quot;Gränd&quot; is Swedish for an alley and there are numerous &quot;gränder&quot;, or alleys in Gamla stan, The Old Town, of Stockholm, Sweden. The town dates back to the 13th century, with medieval alleyways, cobbled streets, and historic buildings. North German architecture has had a strong influence in the Old Town&#x27;s buildings. Some of Stockholm&#x27;s alleys are very narrow pedestrian footpaths, while others are very narrow, cobbled streets, or lanes open to slow moving traffic.
Mårten Trotzigs gränd (&quot;Alley of Mårten Trotzig&quot;) runs from Västerlånggatan and Järntorget up to Prästgatan and Tyska Stallplan, and part of it consists of 36 steps. At its narrowest the alley is a mere 90 cm (35 inches) wide, making it the narrowest street in Stockholm.
The alley is named after the merchant and burgher Mårten Trotzig (1559–1617), who, born in Wittenberg, emigrated to Stockholm in 1581, and bought properties in the alley in 1597 and 1599, also opening a shop there. According to sources from the late 16th century, he was dealing in first iron and later copper, by 1595 had sworn his burgher oath, and was later to become one of the richest merchants in Stockholm.

Possibly referred to as Trångsund (&quot;Narrow strait&quot;) before Mårten Trotzig gave his name to the alley, it is mentioned in 1544 as &quot;Tronge trappe grenden&quot; (&quot;Narrow Alley Stairs&quot;). In 1608 it is referred to &quot;Trappegrenden&quot; (&quot;The Stairs Alley&quot;), but a map dated 1733 calls it &quot;Trotz gränd&quot;. Closed off in the mid 19th century, not to be reopened until 1945, its present name was officially sanctioned by the city in 1949.

The &quot;List of streets and squares in Gamla stan&quot; provides links to many pages that describe other alleys in the oldest part of Stockholm; e.g. Kolmätargränd (Coal Meter&#x27;s Alley); Skeppar Karls Gränd (Skipper Karl&#x27;s Alley); Skeppar Olofs Gränd (Skipper Olof&#x27;s Alley); and Helga Lekamens Gränd (Alley of the Holy Body).

==== United Kingdom ====

===== London =====

London has numerous historical alleys, especially, but not exclusively, in its centre; this includes The City, Covent Garden, Holborn, Clerkenwell, Westminster and Bloomsbury amongst others.

An alley in London can also be called a passage, court, place, lane, and less commonly path, arcade, walk, steps, yard, terrace, and close. While both a court and close are usually defined as blind alleys, or &quot;cul-de-sacs&quot;, several in London are throughways, for example Cavendish Court, a narrow passage leading from Houndsditch into Devonshire Square, and Angel Court, which links King Street and Pall Mall. Bartholomew Close is a narrow winding lane which can be called an alley by virtue of its narrowness, and because through-access requires the use of passages and courts between Little Britain, and Long Lane and Aldersgate Street.

In an old neighbourhood of the City of London, Exchange Alley or Change Alley is a narrow alleyway connecting shops and coffeehouses. It served as a convenient shortcut from the Royal Exchange on Cornhill to the Post Office on Lombard Street and remains as one of a number of alleys linking the two streets. The coffeehouses of Exchange Alley, especially Jonathan&#x27;s and Garraway&#x27;s, became an early venue for the lively trading of shares and commodities. These activities were the progenitor of the modern London Stock Exchange.
Lombard Street and Change Alley had been the open-air meeting place of London&#x27;s mercantile community before Thomas Gresham founded the Royal Exchange in 1565. In 1698, John Castaing began publishing the prices of stocks and commodities in Jonathan&#x27;s Coffeehouse, providing the first evidence of systematic exchange of securities in London.

Change Alley was the site of some noteworthy events in England&#x27;s financial history, including the South Sea Bubble from 1711 to 1720 and the panic of 1745.

In 1761 a club of 150 brokers and jobbers was formed to trade stocks. The club built its own building in nearby Sweeting&#x27;s Alley in 1773, dubbed the &quot;New Jonathan&#x27;s&quot;, later renamed the Stock Exchange.

West of the City there are a number of alleys just north of Trafalgar Square, including Brydges Place which is situated right next to the Coliseum Theatre and just 15 inches wide at its narrowest point, only one person can walk down it at a time. It is the narrowest alley in London and runs for , connecting St Martin&#x27;s Lane with Bedfordbury in Covent Garden.

Close by is another very narrow passage, Lazenby Court, which runs from Rose Street to Floral Street down the side of the Lamb and Flag pub; in order to pass people must turn slightly sideways. The Lamb &amp; Flag in Rose Street has a reputation as the oldest pub in the area, though records are not clear. The first mention of a pub on the site is 1772. The Lazenby Court was the scene of an attack on the famous poet and playwright John Dryden in 1679 by thugs hired by John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester, with whom he had a long-standing conflict.
In the same neighbourhood Cecil Court has an entirely different character than the two previous alleys, and is a spacious pedestrian street with Victorian shop-frontages that links Charing Cross Road with St Martin&#x27;s Lane, and it is sometimes used as a location by film companies.

One of the older thoroughfares in Covent Garden, Cecil Court dates back to the end of the 17th century. A tradesman&#x27;s route at its inception, it later acquired the nickname Flicker Alley because of the concentration of early film companies in the Court. The first film-related company arrived in Cecil Court in 1897, a year after the first demonstration of moving pictures in the United Kingdom and a decade before London&#x27;s first purpose-built cinema opened its doors. Since the 1930s it has been known as the new Booksellers&#x27; Row as it is home to nearly twenty antiquarian and second-hand independent bookshops.

It was the temporary home of an eight-year-old Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart while he was touring Europe in 1764. For almost four months the Mozart family lodged with barber John Couzin. According to some modern authorities, Mozart composed his first symphony while a resident of Cecil Court.

North of the centre of London, Camden Passage is a pedestrian passage off Upper Street in the London Borough of Islington, famous because of its many antiques shops, and an antique market on Wednesdays and Saturday mornings. It was built, as an alley, along the backs of houses on Upper Street, then Islington High Street, in 1767.

===== Southern England =====
* In East Sussex, West Sussex and Surrey, twitten is used, for &quot;a narrow path between two walls or hedges&quot;. It is still in official use in some towns including Lewes, Brighton, and Cuckfield. &quot;Loughton also has twittens, the only Essex example of use of the word and an indication of a very old street pattern&quot;; Loughton also has a track known locally as &quot;The Widden&quot;, a variant of twitten. In north-west Essex and east Hertfordshire &quot;twichell&quot; is common. In other parts of Essex, alley or path is used.
* In the city of Brighton and Hove (in East Sussex), The Lanes is a collection of narrow lanes famous for their small shops (including several antique shops) and narrow alleyways. The area was part of the original settlement of Brighthelmstone, but The Lanes were built up during the late 18th century and were fully laid out by 1792.

===== West of England =====
* In Plymouth, Devon an alley is an ope.
* More generally in Devon any narrow public way which is less commodious than a lane may be called a drangway (from &quot;drang&quot;, as a dialectal variation of throng); typically it will be used on horseback or on foot with or without animals, but may also be for occasional use with vehicles. The word, according to David Crystal, is also used throughout the West of England, Wiltshire, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight, as well as Wales.

===== Midlands and East Anglia =====
* In Birmingham an entry runs between houses or through terraced houses, while a gully runs behind houses.
* In Derbyshire and Leicestershire the word jitty or &quot;gitties&quot; is often found and gulley is a term used in the Black Country.
* In Nottinghamshire, twichell is common (See East Midlands English).
* In Shropshire (especially Shrewsbury) they are called &quot;shuts&quot;.

===== Northern England =====

* The Snickelways of York, in York, Yorkshire, often misspelt &quot;snickleways&quot;, are a collection of small streets, footpaths, or lanes between buildings, not wide enough for a vehicle to pass down, and usually public rights of way. York has many such paths, mostly mediaeval, though there are some modern paths as well. They have names like any other city street, often quirky names such as Mad Alice Lane, Nether Hornpot Lane and even Finkle Street (formerly Mucky Peg Lane). The word &quot;snickelway&quot; was coined by local author Mark W. Jones in 1983 in his book &quot;A Walk Around the Snickelways of York&quot;, and is a portmanteau, a blend of the words &quot;snicket&quot;, meaning a passageway between walls or fences, &quot;ginnel&quot;, a narrow passageway between or through buildings, and &quot;alleyway&quot;, a narrow street or lane. Although a neologism, the word quickly became part of the local vocabulary, and has even been used in official council documents.
* In Whitby, North Yorkshire &quot;ghauts&quot;.
* In Scunthorpe, Lincolnshire, Goole and Hull, East Riding of Yorkshire other terms in use are &quot;cuttings&quot;, &quot;8-foots&quot;, &quot;10-foots&quot;, and &quot;snicket&quot;.
* In North Yorkshire and County Durham, as in Scotland, an alley can be a &quot;wynd&quot;. There is a &quot;Bull Wynd&quot; in Darlington, County Durham and Lombards Wynd in Richmond, North Yorkshire.
* In Durham City narrow passages are also known as &quot;vennels&quot;. Several of these still exist and provide steep shortcuts between the major streets.
* In north-east England, including Bishop Auckland, County Durham; Durham; Hexham, Northumberland; Morpeth, Northumberland; Whitburn, South Tyneside; and Newcastle upon Tyne, Northumberland, alleys can be called &quot;chares&quot;. The chares and much of the layout of Newcastle&#x27;s Quayside date from medieval times. At one point, there were 20 chares in Newcastle. After the great fire of Newcastle and Gateshead in 1854, a number of the chares were permanently removed although many remain in existence today. Chares also are still present in the higher parts of the city centre. According to &quot;Quayside and the Chares&quot; by Jack and John Leslie, chares reflected their name or residents. &quot;Names might change over the years, including Armourer&#x27;s Chare which become Colvin&#x27;s Chare&quot;. Originally inhabited by wealthy merchants, the chares became slums as they were deserted due to their &quot;dark, cramped conditions&quot;. The chares were infamous for their insanitary conditions – typhus was &quot;epidemic&quot; and there were three cholera outbreaks in 1831–2, 1848–9 and finally in 1853 (which killed over 1,500 people).
* In Manchester and Oldham, Greater Manchester, as well as Sheffield, Leeds, Preston and other parts of Yorkshire, jennel, which may be spelt &quot;gennel&quot; or &quot;ginnel&quot;, is common. In some cases, &quot;ginnel&quot; may be used to describe a covered or roofed passage, as distinct from an open alley. In the &quot;Yorkshire Historical Dictionary&quot;, the entry for the word &quot;ginnel&quot; begins, &quot;Many dialect words have been lost in recent times but &#x27;ginnel&#x27; survives in good health, acceptable in polite conversation and even in newspaper articles.&quot;
* In Liverpool, Merseyside, the terms &quot;entry&quot;, &quot;jigger&quot; or &quot;snicket&quot; are more common. &quot;Entry&quot; is also used in some parts of Lancashire and Manchester, though not in South Manchester. This usually refers to a walkway between two adjoining terraced houses, which leads from the street to the rear yard or garden. The term entry is used for an alley in Belfast, Northern Ireland (see The Belfast Entries).

===== Scotland and Northern Ireland =====
In Scotland and Northern Ireland the Scots terms close, wynd, pend and vennel are general in most towns and cities. The term close has an unvoiced &quot;s&quot; as in &quot;sad&quot;. The Scottish author Ian Rankin&#x27;s novel &quot;Fleshmarket Close&quot; was retitled &quot;Fleshmarket Alley&quot; for the American market. Close is the generic Scots term for alleyways, although they may be individually named closes, entries, courts and wynds. Originally, a close was private property, hence gated and closed to the public.

A wynd is typically a narrow lane between houses, an open throughway, usually wide enough for a horse and cart. The word derives from Old Norse &quot;venda&quot;, implying a turning off a main street, without implying that it is curved. In fact, most wynds are straight. In many places wynds link streets at different heights and thus are mostly thought of as being ways up or down hills.

A pend is a passageway that passes through a building, often from a street through to a courtyard, and typically designed for vehicular rather than exclusively pedestrian access. A pend is distinct from a vennel or a close, as it has rooms directly above it, whereas vennels and closes are not covered over.

A vennel is a passageway between the gables of two buildings which can in effect be a minor street in Scotland and the north east of England, particularly in the old centre of Durham. In Scotland, the term originated in royal burghs created in the twelfth century, the word deriving from the Old French word &quot;venelle&quot; meaning &quot;alley&quot; or &quot;lane&quot;. Unlike a tenement entry to private property, known as a &quot;close&quot;, a vennel was a public way leading from a typical high street to the open ground beyond the burgage plots. The Latin form is &quot;venella&quot;.

=== North Africa ===

A medina quarter ( &quot;the old city&quot;) is a distinct city section found in many North African cities. The medina is typically walled, contains many narrow and maze-like streets. The word &quot;&quot; ( ) itself simply means &quot;city&quot; or &quot;town&quot; in modern Arabic.

Because of the very narrow streets, medinas are generally free from car traffic, and in some cases even motorcycle and bicycle traffic. The streets can be less than a metre wide. This makes them unique among highly populated urban centres. The Medina of Fes, Morocco or Fes el Bali, is considered one of the largest car-free urban areas in the world.

=== North America ===

Alleys in North America are primarily used as service lanes. They provide a space for utility poles, fire escapes, garage access, delivery loading zones, and garbage bin pickup.

Some historic alleys are found in older American and Canadian cities, like New York City, Philadelphia, Charleston, South Carolina, Boston, Annapolis, New Castle, Delaware, Quebec City, St John&#x27;s, Newfoundland, and Victoria, British Columbia.

==== Canada ====
===== Quebec City =====

Québec City was originally built on the riverside bluff Cap Diamant in the 17th century, and throughout Quebec City there are strategically placed public stairways that link the bluff to the lower parts of the city. The Upper City is the site of Old Québec&#x27;s most significant historical sites, including 17th- and 18th-century chapels, the Citadel and the city ramparts. The Breakneck Stairs or Breakneck Steps (French: &quot;Escalier casse-cou&quot;), Quebec City&#x27;s oldest stairway, were built in 1635. Originally called &quot;escalier Champlain&quot; &quot;Champlain Stairs&quot;, &quot;escalier du Quêteux&quot; &quot;Beggars&#x27; Stairs&quot;, or &quot;escalier de la Basse-Ville&quot; &quot;Lower Town Stairs&quot;, they were given their current name in the mid-19th century, because of their steepness. The stairs have been restored several times, including an 1889 renovation by Charles Baillargé.

===== Victoria =====
Fan Tan Alley is an alley in Victoria, British Columbia&#x27;s Chinatown. It was originally a gambling district with restaurants, shops, and opium dens. Today it is a tourist destination with many small shops including a barber shop, art gallery, Chinese cafe and apartments. It may well be the narrowest street in Canada. At its narrowest point it is only wide. Waddington Alley is another interesting alley in Victoria and the only street in that city still paved with wood blocks, an early pavement common in the downtown core. Other heritage features are buildings more than a century old lining the alley and a rare metal carriage curb that edges the sidewalk on the southern end.

===== Vancouver =====
Nearly all blocks in Vancouver were designed with an alleyway, as the majority of homes do not have front driveways. Alleyways are, therefore, the way for home owners to access their garage and to also place their garbage for collection. Commercial laneway typically prohibit stopping except for delivery vehicles.

==== United States ====

In the United States alleys exist in both older commercial and residential areas, for both service purposes and automobile access. In residential areas, particularly in those that were built before 1950, alleys provide rear access to property where a garage was located, or where waste could be collected by service vehicles. A benefit of this was the location of these activities to the rear, less public side of a dwelling. Such alleys are generally roughly paved, but some may be dirt. Beginning in the late 20th century, they were seldom included in plans for new housing developments.

===== Annapolis, Maryland =====
When Annapolis, Maryland, was established as a city at the beginning of the 18th century, the streets were established in circles. That encouraged the creation of shortcuts, which over time became paved alleys. Some ten of these survive, and the city has recently worked on making them more attractive.

===== Austin, Texas =====
Several residential neighborhoods in Austin, Texas, have comprehensive alley systems. These include Hyde Park, Rosedale, and areas northwest of the Austin State Hospital. There are also numerous alleys downtown, particularly in the 6th Street district, where bars and restaurants place their garbage for collection.

===== Boston =====

In the Beacon Hill district of Boston, Massachusetts, Acorn Street, a narrow cobbled lane with row houses, is one of Boston&#x27;s more attractive and historic alleys. Many of the alleys in the Back Bay and South End area are numbered (e.g. &quot;Public Alley 438&quot;).

===== Charleston, South Carolina =====
In the French Quarter of Charleston&#x27;s historic district, Philadelphia Alley (c. 1766), originally named &quot;Cow Alley&quot;, is one of several picturesque alleys. In 1810 William Johnson gave it the name of &quot;Philadelphia Alley&quot;, although locals call the &quot;elegantly landscaped thoroughfare&quot; &quot;Dueler&#x27;s Alley&quot;. Starting on East Bay Street, Stolls Alley is just seventeen bricks wide at its start, and named for Justinus Stoll, an 18th-century blacksmith. For three hundred years, another of Charleston&#x27;s narrow lanes, Lodge Alley, served a commercial purpose. Originally, French Huguenot merchants built homes on it, along with warehouses to store supplies for their ships. Just wide, this alley was a useful means of access to Charleston&#x27;s waterways. Today it leads to East Bay Street&#x27;s many restaurants.

===== Chicago, Illinois =====

Chicago has the largest network of alleys in the United States, with more than 1,900 miles of alleyways within city limits, also ranking as one of the largest systems in the world. Alleys have been an integral part of Chicago&#x27;s urban landscape since the city was first incorporated, and have grown in complexity since the 1830s, with many of the city&#x27;s elevated &quot;L&quot; transit rail lines still running overhead today. Although initially considered seedy and uncivilized, the utilitarian nature of alleys has afforded Chicago the ability to keep main roads and thoroughfares clear of trash, unlike other large cities in the country, while also providing additional space for residential and commercial car parking, as well as maintaining accessible electrical and plumbing utilities, both above and below ground. In 2006, the Chicago Department of Transportation began implementing the &quot;Green Alley&quot; program, an ongoing effort to replace hardtop alley surfaces with permeable pavers and better grading to more quickly absorb storm water runoff into the groundwater below, reducing stress on the city&#x27;s infrastructure, as well as introducing lighter colored &quot;high albedo&quot; pavement to reflect sunlight and reduce urban heat island effect.

===== Cincinnati, Ohio =====

Cincinnati is a city of hills. Before the advent of the automobile a system of stairway alleys provided pedestrians important and convenient access to and from their hill top homes. At the height of their use in the 19th century, over of hill side steps once connected the neighborhoods of Cincinnati to each other. The first steps were installed by residents of Mount Auburn in the 1830s in order to gain easier access to Findlay Market in Over-the-Rhine. In recent years many steps have fallen into disrepair but there is a movement now to rehabilitate them.

===== New Castle, Delaware =====
Another early settled American city, New Castle has a number of interesting alleys, some of which are footpaths and others narrow, sometimes cobbled, lanes open to traffic.

===== New York City =====

New York City&#x27;s Manhattan is unusual in that it has very few alleys, since the Commissioner&#x27;s Plan of 1811 did not include rear service alleys when it created Manhattan&#x27;s grid. The exclusion of alleys has been criticized as a flaw in the plan, since services such as garbage pickup cannot be provided out of sight of the public, although other commentators feel that the lack of alleys is a benefit to the quality of life of the city. Since there are so few alleys in New York, film location shooting requiring alleys tend to be concentrated in Cortlandt Alley, located between Canal and Franklin Streets in the blocks between Broadway and Lafayette Street in the TriBeCa neighborhood of lower Manhattan.

Two notable alleys in the Greenwich Village neighborhood in Manhattan are MacDougal Alley and Washington Mews. The latter is a blind alley or &quot;cul-de-sac&quot;. Greenwich Village also has a number of private alleys that lead to back houses, which can only be accessed by residents, including Grove Court, Patchin Place and Milligan Place, all blind alleys. Patchin Place is notable for the writers who lived there. In the Brooklyn Heights neighborhood of Brooklyn, Grace Court Alley is another converted mews, as is Dennett Place in the Carroll Gardens neighborhood. The former is a &quot;cul-de-sac&quot;.

Shubert Alley is a long pedestrian alley at the heart of the Broadway theater district of New York City. The alley was originally created as a fire exit between the Shubert Theatre on West 45th Street and the Booth Theatre on West 44th Street, and the Astor Hotel to their east. Actors once gathered in the alley, hoping to attract the attention of the Shubert Brothers and get employment in their theatrical productions. When the hotel was torn down, and replaced with One Astor Plaza (1515 Broadway), the apparent width of the alley increased, as the new building did not go all the way to the westernmost edge of the building lot. However, officially, Shubert Alley consists only of the space between the two theatres and the lot line.

===== Philadelphia =====

The Old City and Society Hill neighborhoods of Philadelphia, the oldest parts of the city, include a number of alleys, notably Elfreth&#x27;s Alley, which is called &quot;Our nation&#x27;s oldest residential street&quot;, dating from 1702. , there were 32 houses on the street, which were built between 1728 and 1836.

There are numerous cobblestoned residential passages in Philadelphia, many no wider than a truck, and typically flanked with brick houses. A typical house on these alleys or lanes is called a Philadelphia &quot;Trinity&quot;, named because it has three rooms, one to each floor, alluding to the Christian Trinity. These alleys include Willings Alley, between S. 3rd and S. 4th Streets and Walnut and Spruce Streets. Other streets in Philadelphia which fit the general description of an alley, but are not named &quot;alley&quot;, include Cuthbert Street, Filbert Street, Phillips Street, South American Street, Sansom Walk, St. James Place, and numerous others.

===== Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania =====

Steps, Pittsburgh&#x27;s equivalent for an alley, have defined it for many visitors. Writing in 1937, war correspondent Ernie Pyle wrote of the steps of Pittsburgh:

And then the steps. Oh Lord, the steps! I was told they actually had a Department of Steps. That isn&#x27;t exactly true, although they do have an Inspector of Steps. But there are nearly of city-owned steps, going up mountainsides.

The City of Pittsburgh maintains 712 sets of city-owned steps, some of which are shown as streets on maps.

===== San Francisco, California =====
In hilly San Francisco, California alleys often take the form of steps and it has several hundred public stairways. Among the most famous is the stairway known as the Filbert steps, a continuation of Filbert Street. The Filbert Street Steps descend the east slope of Telegraph Hill along the line where Filbert Street would be if the hill was not so steep. The stairway is bordered by greenery, that consists both backyards, and a border garden tended to and paid for by the residents of the &quot;street&quot;, and runs down to an eastern stub of Filbert Street and the walkway through the plaza to The Embarcadero. Many houses in this residential neighborhood are accessible only from the steps.

Also in San Francisco, Belden Place is a narrow pedestrian alley, bordered by restaurants, in the Financial District, referred to as San Francisco&#x27;s French Quarter for its historic ties to early French immigrants, and its popular contemporary French restaurants and institutions. The area was home to San Francisco&#x27;s first French settlers. Approximately 3,000, sponsored by the French government, arrived near the end of the Gold Rush in 1851.

===== San Luis Obispo =====
Bubblegum Alley is a tourist attraction where people have left their finished bubblegum on the walls of an alley for decades. The walls have been cleaned multiple times only to have the gum rapidly reappear.

===== Seattle =====
There are over 600 publicly accessible stairways within Seattle, a city of hills, bluffs, and canyons. For an example see Howe Street Stairs.

==== Green and revitalized alleys ====

Numerous cities in the United States and Canada, such as Chicago, Seattle, Los Angeles, Phoenix, Washington, D.C., and Montréal, have started reclaiming their alleys from garbage and crime by greening the service lanes, or back ways, that run behind some houses. Chicago, Illinois has about of alleyways. In 2006, the Chicago Department of Transportation started converting conventional alleys which were paved with asphalt into so called Green Alleys. This program, called the Green Alley Program, is supposed to enable easier water runoff, as the alleyways in Chicago are not connected directly to the sewer system. With this program, the water will be able to seep through semi-permeable concrete or asphalt in which a colony of fungi and bacteria will establish itself. The bacteria will help breakup oils before the water is absorbed into the ground. The lighter color of the pavement will also reflect more light, making the area next to the alley cooler. The greening of such alleys or laneways can also involve the planting of native plants to further absorb rain water and moderate temperature.
In 2002, a group of Baltimore residents from the Patterson Park neighborhood approached the Patterson Park Community Development Corporation (CDC) looking for a way to improve the dirty, crime-ridden alley that ran behind their homes. Simultaneously, Community Greens also approached the Patterson Park CDC looking for an alley they could use as a pilot project in Baltimore. This led The Luzerne-Glover block being granted a temporary permit from the city to gate their alleyway, despite the fact that it was not yet legal to gate a right-of-way. Eventually the law was changed so that Baltimore residents could legally gate and green the alleys behind their homes.

New life has also come to other alleys within downtown commercial districts of various cities throughout the world with the opening of businesses, such as coffee houses, shops, restaurants and bars.

Another way that alleys and laneways are being revitalized is through laneway housing. A laneway house is a form of housing that has been proposed on the west coast of Canada, especially in the Metro Vancouver area. These homes are typically built into pre-existing lots, usually in the backyard and opening onto the back lane. This form of housing already exists in Vancouver, and revised regulations now encourage new developments as part of a plan to increase urban density in pre-existing neighbourhoods while retaining a single-family feel to the area. Vancouver&#x27;s average laneway house is one and a half stories, with one or two bedrooms. Typical regulations require that the laneway home is built on the back half of a traditional lot in the space normally reserved for a garage.

Toronto also has a tradition of laneway housing and changed regulations to encourage new development. However this was discontinued in 2006 after staff reviewed the impact on services and safety.

<text>John Hugh MacLennan (March 20, 1907 – November 9, 1990) was a Canadian writer and professor of English at McGill University. He won five Governor General&#x27;s Awards and a Royal Bank Award.

==Family and childhood==
MacLennan was born in Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, on March 20, 1907. His parents were Samuel MacLennan, a colliery physician, and Katherine MacQuarrie; Hugh also had an older sister named Frances. Samuel was a stern Calvinist, while Katherine was creative, warm and dreamy, and both parents would be large influences on Hugh&#x27;s character. In 1913, the family spent several months in London while Samuel took on further study to become a medical specialist. On returning to Canada, they briefly lived in Sydney, Nova Scotia, before settling in Halifax. In December 1917, young Hugh experienced the Halifax Explosion, which he would later write about in his first published novel, &quot;Barometer Rising&quot;. From the ages of twelve to twenty-one, he slept in a tent in the family&#x27;s backyard, even in the cold winter, possibly as an escape from his strict father. Hugh grew up believing in the importance of religion; he and Frances regularly went to Sunday school, and the family attended Presbyterian church services twice each Sunday. He was also active in sports, and became especially good at tennis, eventually winning the Nova Scotia men&#x27;s double championship in 1927.

==Education==
MacLennan and his sister were pushed extremely hard by their father to spend long hours learning the classics. While this was very difficult for Frances, who had no interest in Greek, Hugh grew to enjoy this field of study. Their father had an ambitious educational path planned for Hugh: studying the classics at Dalhousie University, getting a Rhodes Scholarship, and then continuing his studies in England.

While at Dalhousie, he realized that his inner wish was to pursue an artistic career, the influence of his creative mother. At Oxford, he struggled with balancing his passion for Greek and Latin studies with these artistic instincts. In his first year at the university&#x27;s Oriel College, MacLennan worked incredibly hard at his classics courses, but was only able to achieve second-class honours. By his second year, he had resigned himself to such results, and while still working diligently, decided not to overwork himself as before. In his fourth year, he was finding it increasingly difficult to concentrate on his studies and spent more and more time at tennis and writing poetry. In letters to his family from around this time are hints that he hoped to be a successful writer. In late 1931, MacLennan sent some of his poetry to three publishers, including the firms of John Lane and Elkin Mathews, but it was turned down.

MacLennan&#x27;s four years in Oxford gave him the opportunity to travel throughout Europe, and he visited countries such as Switzerland, France, Greece, and Italy. He spent some of his holidays lodging with a family in Germany, through which he acquired a very good proficiency in German. His travels and his exposure to different political ideas caused MacLennan to begin to question his father&#x27;s puritanical, conservative attitudes that he had until then taken for granted.

MacLennan won a $400 scholarship to continue his studies at Princeton University, and despite his growing disinclination to keep studying the classics, he decided to go there. This was partly to appease his father, and partly because the Great Depression meant that there were few jobs available. In June 1932, while sailing home from England, he met his future wife, American Dorothy Duncan. Falling in love with her made him change his mind about Princeton. For one thing, his father insisted he should not get married before becoming financially independent, which would mean delaying marriage at least until his graduation. In addition, MacLennan was already unhappy about having to accept money from his father for the part of his Princeton studies that would not be covered by his scholarship. However, his applications were rejected from both of the Canadian universities he applied to that had classics department positions opening; thus, he grudgingly agreed to go to Princeton after all.

His three years at Princeton were unhappy. The style of classical study there was very different from what he was used to at Oxford, with Princeton&#x27;s scholarship &quot;consist[ing] of extremely detailed analyses of classical texts and sources—thorough, but unoriginal.&quot; He began to rebel against his father&#x27;s ideals: he stopped going to church and put increasing energy into his writing at the expense of his studies; furthermore, in addition to resenting his financial dependence on his father, he continued his relationship with Dorothy even though he knew his father would not approve of her American, Lowland Scottish, Christian Science, business-world background.

==Unpublished novels==
At Princeton, MacLennan wrote his first novel, &quot;So All Their Praises&quot;. He found one publisher who was willing to take the manuscript, as long as he made certain changes; however, this company went out of business before the book could be published. In spring 1935, he finished his PhD thesis, &quot;Oxyrhynchus: An Economic and Social Study&quot;, about the decline of a Roman colony in Egypt, which was published by Princeton University Press and reprinted in 1968 by A.M. Hakkert.

In 1935, there were very few teaching jobs available as a result of the Depression, and MacLennan&#x27;s field of study, the classics, was in particular becoming less significant in North American education. He took a position at Lower Canada College in Montreal, Quebec, even though he felt it was beneath him, as just his Dalhousie BA would have been a sufficient qualification for the job. He generally did not enjoy working there, and resented the long hours required of him for low pay, but was nonetheless a stimulating teacher, at least for the brighter students. MacLennan would later poke fun at Lower Canada College in his depiction of Waterloo School in &quot;The Watch That Ends the Night&quot;. On June 22, 1936, he and Dorothy were wed near her home in Wilmette, Illinois, and settled in Montreal.

Meanwhile, in 1934–1938, MacLennan was working on his second novel, &quot;A Man Should Rejoice&quot;. Longman, Green and Company and Duell, Sloan and Pearce both showed strong interest in the novel, but in the end neither published it.

In February 1939, MacLennan&#x27;s father died after suffering from high blood pressure. It was a huge surprise to MacLennan, as in the previous year they had just begun to become closer and to reconcile their opposing views. For several months after his father&#x27;s death MacLennan continued to write letters to him, in which he discussed his thoughts on the possibility and implications of a war in Europe.

==&quot;Barometer Rising&quot;==

Dorothy convinced MacLennan that the failure of his first two novels was due to his having set one in Europe and the other in the United States; she persuaded him to write about Canada, the country he knew best. She told him that &quot;Nobody&#x27;s going to understand Canada until she evolves a literature of her own, and you&#x27;re the fellow to start bringing Canadian novels up to date.&quot; Until then there had been a sporadic tradition of Anglo-Canadian literature, with such writers as Thomas Chandler Haliburton (1796–1865), Susanna Moodie (1803-1885), L. M. Montgomery (1874-1942), Stephen Leacock (1869-1944), Morley Callaghan (1903 – 1990), and W. O. Mitchell (1914-1998). MacLennan set out to define Canada for Canadians through a national novel.

&quot;Barometer Rising&quot;, his novel about the social class structure of Nova Scotia and the Halifax Explosion of 1917, was published in 1941.

==Later novels==
His most famous novel, &quot;Two Solitudes&quot;, a literary allegory for the tensions between English and French Canada, followed in 1945. That year, he left Lower Canada College. &quot;Two Solitudes&quot; won MacLennan his first Governor General&#x27;s Award for Fiction. In 1948, MacLennan published &quot;The Precipice&quot;, which again won the Governor General&#x27;s Award. The following year, he published a collection of essays, &quot;Cross Country&quot;, which won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Non-Fiction.

In 1951, MacLennan returned to teaching, accepting a position at McGill University. In 1952, he was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and awarded the society&#x27;s Lorne Pierce Medal. In 1954, he published another essay collection, &quot;Thirty and Three&quot;, which again won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for Non-Fiction. In 1956, he was made a fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

One of MacLennan&#x27;s students at McGill was Marian Engel, who became a noted Canadian novelist in the 1970s. He served as her master&#x27;s supervisor in . Another notable student was Leonard Cohen, the popular songwriter, poet and novelist.

Dorothy Duncan died in 1957. MacLennan married his second wife, Aline Walker, in 1959. That same year, he published &quot;The Watch That Ends the Night&quot;, which won his final Governor General&#x27;s Award.

In 1967 he was made a Companion of the Order of Canada. In 1985 he was made a Knight of the National Order of Quebec.

MacLennan continued to write and publish work, with his final novel &quot;Voices in Time&quot; appearing in 1980. He died on November 9, 1990, in Montreal, Quebec.

The Canadian band The Tragically Hip, on their album &quot;Fully Completely&quot;, have a song called &quot;Courage (for Hugh MacLennan)&quot;. A passage from &quot;The Watch That Ends the Night&quot; is adapted for use in the song.
