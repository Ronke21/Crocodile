<text>Joseph Eggleston Johnston (February 3, 1807 – March 21, 1891) was an American military officer who served in the United States Army during the Mexican–American War (1846–1848) and the Seminole Wars. After Virginia declared secession from the United States, he entered the Confederate States Army as one of its most senior general officers during the American Civil War. From 1888 to 1889 he was a vice president, from 1889 to 1890 president, of the Aztec Club of 1847.

Johnston was trained as a civil engineer at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York, graduating in the same class as Robert E. Lee. He served in Florida, Texas, and Kansas. By 1860 he achieved the rank of brigadier general as Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army.

Johnston&#x27;s effectiveness in the American Civil War was undercut by tensions with Confederate president Jefferson Davis. Victory eluded him in most campaigns he personally commanded. He was the senior Confederate commander at the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861, but the victory is usually credited to his subordinate, P. G. T. Beauregard. Johnston defended the Confederate capital of Richmond, Virginia, during the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, withdrawing under the pressure of U.S. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan&#x27;s superior force. He suffered a severe wound at the Battle of Seven Pines and was replaced by Robert E. Lee.

In 1863, Johnston was placed in command of the Department of the West. In 1864, he commanded the Army of Tennessee against U.S. Maj. Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman in the Atlanta Campaign. In the war&#x27;s final days, Johnston was returned to command of the few remaining forces in the Carolinas Campaign. U.S. Army generals Ulysses S. Grant and Sherman praised his actions in the war and became friends with Johnston afterward.

After the war, Johnston served as an executive in the railroad and insurance businesses. He was elected as a Democrat in the United States House of Representatives, serving a single term. He was appointed as commissioner of railroads under Grover Cleveland. Johnston died of pneumonia one month after attending Sherman&#x27;s funeral.

==Early years==
Johnston was born at Longwood House in &quot;Cherry Grove&quot;, near Farmville, Virginia, on February 3, 1807. (Longwood House later burned down. The rebuilt house was the birthplace in 1827 of Charles S. Venable, an officer on the staff of Robert E. Lee. It is now used as the residence of the president of Longwood University.) His grandfather, Peter Johnston, emigrated to Virginia from Scotland in 1726. Joseph was the seventh son of Judge Peter Johnston Jr. (1763–1831) and Mary Valentine Wood (1769–1825), a daughter of Patrick Henry&#x27;s sister, Lucy Wood. He was named for Major Joseph Eggleston, under whom his father served in the American Revolutionary War, in the command of Henry Lee III. His brother Charles Clement Johnston served as a U.S. congressman, and his nephew John Warfield Johnston was a U.S. senator; both represented Virginia. In 1811, the Johnston family moved to Abingdon, Virginia, a town near the Tennessee border, where his father Peter built a home he named Panecillo.

Johnston attended the United States Military Academy, nominated by John C. Calhoun in 1825 while he was Secretary of War. He was moderately successful in academics and received only a small number of disciplinary demerits. He graduated in 1829, ranking 13th of 46 cadets, and was appointed a second lieutenant in the 4th U.S. Artillery. He would become the first West Point graduate to be promoted to a general officer in the regular army, reaching a higher rank in the U.S. Army than did his 1829 classmate, Robert E. Lee (2nd of 46).

==U.S. Army service==
Johnston resigned from the Army in March 1837 and studied civil engineering. During the Second Seminole War, he was a civilian topographic engineer aboard a ship led by William Pope McArthur. On January 12, 1838, at Jupiter, Florida, the sailors who had gone ashore were attacked. Johnston said there were &quot;no less than 30 bullet holes&quot; in his clothing, and one bullet creased his scalp, leaving a scar he had for the rest of his life. Having encountered more combat activities in Florida as a civilian than he had previously as an artillery officer, Johnston decided to rejoin the Army. He departed for Washington, D.C., in April 1838 and was appointed a first lieutenant of topographic engineers on July 7; on that same day, he received a brevet promotion to captain for the actions at Jupiter Inlet and his explorations of the Florida Everglades.

On July 10, 1845, in Baltimore, Johnston married Lydia Mulligan Sims McLane (1822–1887), the daughter of Louis McLane and his wife. Her father was the president of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, a prominent politician (congressman and senator from Delaware, minister to London, and a member of President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s cabinet). They had no children.

Johnston was enthusiastic about the outbreak of the Mexican–American War. He served on the staff of Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott in the Siege of Veracruz, having been chosen by Scott to be the officer carrying the demand for surrender beforehand to the provincial governor. He was in the vanguard of the movement inland under Brig. Gen. David E. Twiggs and was severely wounded by grapeshot performing reconnaissance before the Battle of Cerro Gordo. He was appointed a brevet lieutenant colonel for his actions at Cerro Gordo. After recovering in a field hospital, he rejoined the army at Puebla. During the advance toward Mexico City, he was second in command of the &quot;U.S. Regiment of Voltigeurs&quot;, a unit composed of light infantry or skirmishers. He distinguished himself at Contreras and Churubusco, was wounded again at Chapultepec, and received two brevet promotions for the latter two engagements, ending the war as a brevet colonel of volunteers. (After the end of hostilities, he reverted to his peacetime rank of captain in the topographical engineers.) Winfield Scott humorously remarked, &quot;Johnston is a great soldier, but he had an unfortunate knack of getting himself shot in nearly every engagement.&quot; Johnston&#x27;s greatest anguish during the war was the death of his nephew, Preston Johnston. When Robert E. Lee informed Johnston that a Mexican artillery shell had killed Preston at Contreras, both officers wept, and Johnston grieved for the remainder of his life.
Johnston was an engineer on the Texas-United States boundary survey in 1841; he returned to the area, was appointed chief topographical engineer of the Department of Texas and served from 1848 to 1853.

During the 1850s, he sought his previous rank, sending letters to the War Department suggesting that he should be returned to a combat regiment with his wartime rank of colonel. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, an acquaintance of Johnston&#x27;s from West Point, rebuffed these suggestions, as he did later during the Civil War, much to Johnston&#x27;s irritation. Despite this disagreement, Davis thought enough of Johnston to appoint him lieutenant colonel in one of the newly formed regiments, the 1st U.S. Cavalry at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, under Col. Edwin V. &quot;Bull&quot; Sumner, on March 1, 1855. At this same time, Robert E. Lee was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 2nd U.S. Cavalry under Col. Albert Sidney Johnston (no relation). In this role, Johnston participated in actions against the Sioux in the Wyoming Territory and in the violence over slavery in the future state, known as Bleeding Kansas. He developed a mentor relationship and close friendship with one of his junior officers, Capt. George B. McClellan, who would later command the U.S. Army against Johnston.

In the fall of 1856, Johnston was transferred to a depot for recruits at Jefferson Barracks, Missouri. In 1857 he led surveying expeditions to determine the Kansas border, including a corner monument that would later lead to a Supreme Court case. Later that year, Davis was replaced as Secretary of War by John B. Floyd, a native of Abingdon and a cousin of Johnston&#x27;s by marriage. He had been a former guardian of Preston Johnston. Floyd made Johnston a brevet colonel for his actions at Cerro Gordo, a promotion that caused grumbling within the Army about favoritism. In 1859, President James Buchanan named Johnston&#x27;s brother-in-law, Robert Milligan McLane, as minister to Mexico, and Johnston accompanied him on a journey to visit Benito Juárez&#x27;s government in Veracruz. He was also ordered to inspect possible military routes across the country in case of further hostilities.

Brig. Gen. Thomas Jesup, the Quartermaster General of the U.S. Army, died on June 10, 1860. Winfield Scott was responsible for naming a replacement, but instead of one name, he offered four possibilities: Joseph E. Johnston, Albert Sidney Johnston (no relation), Robert E. Lee, and Charles F. Smith. Although Jefferson Davis, now a member of the Senate Military Affairs Committee, favored Albert Sidney Johnston, Secretary of War Floyd chose Joseph E. Johnston for the position.

Johnston was promoted to brigadier general on June 28, 1860. Johnston did not enjoy the position, preferring field command to administration in Washington. In addition, he suffered from the pressures of the imminent sectional crisis and the ethical dilemma of administering war matériel that might prove useful to his native South. He did not yield to temptation, however, as Secretary of War Floyd was accused of doing.

==Civil War==

===Manassas and first friction with President Davis===
When his native state, Virginia, declared secession from the United States in 1861, Johnston resigned his commission as a brigadier general in the regular army, the highest-ranking U.S. Army officer to do so. He would go on to state, &quot;I believed like most others, that the division of the country would be permanent; and that ... the revolution begun was justified by the maxims so often repeated by Americans, that Free government is founded on the consent of the governed, and that every community strong enough to establish and maintain its independence, has a right to assert it. Having been educated in such opinions, I naturally determined to return to the State of which I was a native, join the people among whom I was born, and live with my kindred, and if necessary, fight in their defense.&quot;

He was initially commissioned as a major general in the Virginia militia on May 4, but the Virginia Convention decided two weeks later that only one major general was required in the state army and Robert E. Lee was their choice. Johnston was then offered a state commission as a brigadier general, which he declined, accepting instead a commission as a brigadier general in the Confederate States Army on May 14. Johnston relieved Colonel Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson of command at Harpers Ferry in May and organized the Army of the Shenandoah in July.

In the First Battle of Bull Run (First Manassas), July 21, 1861, Johnston rapidly moved his small army from the Shenandoah Valley to reinforce that of Brig. Gen. P. G. T. Beauregard, but he lacked familiarity with the terrain and ceded tactical planning of the battle to the more junior Beauregard as a professional courtesy. At midday, while Beauregard was still unclear about his U.S. opponent&#x27;s direction in the battle, Johnston decided that the critical point was to the north of his headquarters (the Lewis house, &quot;Portici&quot;), at Henry House Hill. He abruptly announced, &quot;The battle is there. I am going.&quot; Beauregard and the staffs of both generals followed his lead and rode off. Johnston encountered a scattered unit, the 4th Alabama, whose field-grade officers had all been killed, and personally rallied the men to reinforce the Confederate line. He consoled the despairing Brig. Gen. Barnard Bee and urged him to lead his men back into the fight. (General Bee&#x27;s exhortation to his men inspired Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s nickname.) Beauregard then convinced Johnston that he would be more valuable in organizing the arrival of reinforcements for the remainder of the battle than in providing at-the-front tactical leadership. Although Beauregard claimed the majority of public credit, Johnston&#x27;s behind-the-scenes role was critical to the Confederate victory. After Bull Run, Johnston assisted Beauregard and William Porcher Miles in the design and production of the Confederate Battle Flag. It was Johnston&#x27;s idea to make the flag square.

In August, Johnston was promoted to full general—what is called a four-star general in the modern U.S. Army—but was not pleased that three other men he had outranked in the &quot;old Army&quot; now outranked him, even though Davis backdated his promotion to July 4. Johnston felt that, since he was the senior officer to leave the U.S. Army and join the Confederacy, he should not be ranked behind Samuel Cooper, Albert Sidney Johnston, and Robert E. Lee. Only Beauregard was placed behind Johnston on the list of five new generals. This led to much bad blood between Johnston and Jefferson Davis, lasting throughout the war. The crux of Davis&#x27;s counterargument was that Johnston&#x27;s U.S. commission as a brigadier general was as a staff officer and that his highest line commission was as a lieutenant colonel; both Sidney Johnston and Lee had been full colonels. Johnston sent an intemperately worded letter to Davis, who was offended enough to discuss its tone with his cabinet.

Johnston was placed in command of the Department of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of the Potomac on July 21, 1861, and the Department of Northern Virginia on October 22. From July to November 1861, he was headquartered at the Conner House in Manassas. The winter of 1861–62 was relatively quiet for Johnston in his Centreville headquarters, concerned primarily with organization and equipment issues, as the principal Northern army, also named Army of the Potomac, was being organized by George B. McClellan. McClellan perceived Johnston&#x27;s army as overwhelmingly strong in its fortifications, prompting him to plan an amphibious movement around Johnston&#x27;s flank. In early March, learning of U.S. offensive preparations, Johnston withdrew his army to Culpeper Court House. This movement had repercussions on both sides. President Davis was surprised and disappointed by the unannounced move, which he considered a &quot;precipitate retreat.&quot; At about this time, Davis moved to restrict Johnston&#x27;s authority by bringing Robert E. Lee to Richmond as his military adviser. He began issuing direct orders to some of the forces under Johnston&#x27;s ostensible command. On the Northern side, McClellan was publicly embarrassed when it was revealed that the Confederate position had not been nearly as strong as he had portrayed. But more importantly, it required him to replan his spring offensive, and instead of an amphibious landing at his preferred target of Urbanna, he chose the Virginia Peninsula, between the James and York Rivers, as his avenue of approach toward Richmond.

===Peninsula Campaign===

In early April 1862, McClellan, having landed his troops at Fort Monroe at the tip of the Virginia Peninsula, began to move slowly toward Yorktown. Johnston&#x27;s plan for the defense of the Confederate capital was controversial. Knowing that his army was half the size of McClellan&#x27;s and that the U.S. Navy could directly support McClellan from either river, Johnston attempted to convince Davis and Lee that the best course would be to concentrate on fortifications around Richmond. He was unsuccessful in persuading them and deployed most of his force on the Peninsula. Following lengthy siege preparations by McClellan at Yorktown, Johnston withdrew and fought a sharp defensive fight at Williamsburg (May 5) and turned back an attempt at an amphibious turning movement at Eltham&#x27;s Landing (May 7). By late May, the U.S. Army was within six miles of Richmond.

Realizing that he could not defend Richmond forever from the U.S. Army&#x27;s overwhelming numbers and heavy siege artillery and that McClellan&#x27;s army was divided by the rain-swollen Chickahominy River, Johnston attacked south of the river on May 31 in the Battle of Seven Pines or Fair Oaks. His plan was aggressive but too complicated for his subordinates to execute correctly, and he failed to ensure they understood his orders in detail or to supervise them closely. The battle was tactically inconclusive, but it stopped McClellan&#x27;s advance on the city and would be the high-water mark of his invasion. More significant, however, was that Johnston was wounded in his shoulder and chest by an artillery shell fragment near the end of the first day of the battle. G.W. Smith commanded the army during the second day of the battle before Davis quickly turned over command to the more aggressive Robert E. Lee, who would lead the Army of Northern Virginia for the rest of the war. Lee began by driving McClellan from the Peninsula during the Seven Days Battles of late June and beating a U.S. army a second time near Bull Run in August.

===Appointment to the Western Theater and Vicksburg===
Johnston was prematurely discharged from the hospital on November 24, 1862, and appointed to command the Department of the West, the principal command of the Western Theater, which gave him titular control of Gen. Braxton Bragg&#x27;s Army of Tennessee and Lt. Gen. John C. Pemberton&#x27;s Department of Mississippi and East Louisiana. (The other major force in this area was the Trans-Mississippi Department, commanded by Lt. Gen. Theophilus H. Holmes, stationed principally in Arkansas. Johnston argued throughout his tenure that Holmes&#x27;s command should be combined with Pemberton&#x27;s under Johnston&#x27;s control, or at least to reinforce Pemberton with troops from Holmes&#x27;s command, but he was unable to convince the government to take either of these steps.)

The first issue facing Johnston in the west was the fate of Braxton Bragg. The Confederate government was displeased with Bragg&#x27;s performance at the Battle of Stones River, as were many of Bragg&#x27;s senior subordinates. Jefferson Davis ordered Johnston to visit Bragg and determine whether he should be replaced. Johnston realized that if he recommended Bragg&#x27;s replacement, he would be the logical choice to succeed him. He considered a field army command more desirable than his current, mostly administrative post. Still, his sense of honor prevented him from achieving this personal gain at Bragg&#x27;s expense. After interviewing Bragg and several of his subordinates, he produced a generally positive report and refused to relieve the army commander. Davis ordered Bragg to a meeting in Richmond and designated Johnston to take command in the field, but Bragg&#x27;s wife was ill, and he was unable to travel. Furthermore, in early April, Johnston was forced to bed with lingering problems from his Peninsula wound, and the attention of the Confederates shifted from Tennessee to Mississippi, leaving Bragg in place.
The major crisis facing Johnston was defending Confederate control of Vicksburg, Mississippi, which was threatened by U.S. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant, first in a series of unsuccessful maneuvers during the winter of 1862–63 to the north of the fortress city, but followed in April 1863 with an ambitious campaign that began with Grant&#x27;s army crossing the Mississippi River southwest of Vicksburg. Catching Lt. Gen. Pemberton by surprise, the U.S. army waged a series of successful battles as it moved northeast toward the state capital of Jackson. On May 9, the Confederate Secretary of War directed Johnston to &quot;proceed at once to Mississippi and take chief command of the forces in the field.&quot; Johnston informed Richmond that he was still medically unfit but would obey the order. When he arrived in Jackson on May 13 from Middle Tennessee, he learned that two U.S. Army corps were advancing on the city and that only 6,000 Confederate troops were available to hold it. Johnston ordered a fighting evacuation (the Battle of Jackson, May 14) and retreated with his force north. Grant captured the city and then faced to the west to approach Vicksburg.

Johnston began to move his force west to join Pemberton when he heard of that general&#x27;s defeat at Champion Hill (May 16) and Big Black River Bridge (May 17). The survivors retreated to the fortifications of Vicksburg. Johnston urged Pemberton to avoid being surrounded by abandoning the city and to join forces with Johnston&#x27;s troops, outnumbering Grant. Still, Davis had ordered Pemberton to defend the city as his highest priority. Grant launched two unsuccessful assaults against the fortifications and settled in for a siege. The soldiers and civilians in the surrounded city waited in vain for Johnston&#x27;s small force to rescue them. By late May, Johnston had accumulated about 24,000 men but wanted additional reinforcements before moving forward. He considered ordering Bragg to send these reinforcements but was concerned that this could result in the loss of Tennessee. He also bickered with President Davis about whether the order sending him to Mississippi could be construed as removing him from theater command; historian Steven E. Woodworth judges that Johnston &quot;willfully misconstrued&quot; his orders out of resentment of Davis&#x27;s interference. Pemberton&#x27;s army surrendered on July 4, 1863. Along with the capture of Port Hudson a week later, the loss of Vicksburg gave the United States complete control of the Mississippi River and cut the Confederacy in two. President Davis wryly ascribed the strategic defeat to a &quot;want of provisions inside and a general outside [Johnston] who would not fight.&quot;

The relationship between Johnston and Davis, difficult since the early days of the war, became bitter as recriminations were traded publicly about who was to blame for Vicksburg. That Johnston never wanted this theater command in the first place, difficulty in effectively moving troops due to lack of direct rail lines and the vast distances involved, lack of assistance from subordinate commanders, Pemberton&#x27;s refusal to abandon Vicksburg as suggested, and President Davis&#x27; habit of communicating directly to Johnston&#x27;s subordinates (which meant Johnston was often not aware of what was going on) all contributed to this defeat. Davis considered firing Johnston, but he remained a popular officer and had many political allies in Richmond, most notably Sen. Louis Wigfall. Instead, Bragg&#x27;s army was removed from Johnston&#x27;s command, leaving him in control of only Alabama and Mississippi.

While Vicksburg was falling, U.S. Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans was advancing against Bragg in Tennessee, forcing him to evacuate Chattanooga. Bragg achieved a significant victory against Rosecrans in the Battle of Chickamauga (September 19–20), but Ulysses S. Grant defeated him in the Battles for Chattanooga in November. Bragg resigned from his command of the Army of Tennessee and returned to Richmond as military adviser to the president. Davis offered the position to William J. Hardee, the senior corps commander, who refused. He considered P.G.T. Beauregard, another general with whom he had poor personal relations, and Robert E. Lee. Lee, reluctant to leave Virginia, first recommended Beauregard, but sensing Davis&#x27;s discomfort, he changed his recommendation to Johnston. After much agonizing, Davis appointed Johnston to command the Army of Tennessee in Dalton, Georgia, on December 27, 1863.

===Atlanta Campaign===

Faced with Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman&#x27;s advance from Chattanooga to Atlanta in the spring of 1864, Johnston conducted a series of withdrawals that appeared similar to his Peninsula Campaign strategy. He repeatedly prepared strong defensive positions, only to see Sherman maneuver around them in expert turning movements, causing him to fall back in the general direction of Atlanta. Johnston saw the preservation of his army as the most crucial consideration and conducted a very cautious campaign. He handled his army well, slowing the U.S. advance and inflicting heavier losses than he sustained.

Sherman began his Atlanta Campaign on May 4. Johnston&#x27;s Army of Tennessee fought defensive battles against the Federals at the approaches to Dalton, which was evacuated on May 13, then retreated 12 miles south to Resaca and constructed defensive positions. However, after a brief battle, Johnston again yielded to Sherman and retreated from Resaca on May 15. Johnston assembled the Confederate forces for an attack at Cassville. As his troops advanced, an enemy force of unknown strength appeared unexpectedly on his right flank. A skirmish ensued, forcing the corps commander, Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood, to halt his advance and reposition his troops to face the threat. Faced with this unexpected threat, Johnston abandoned his attack and renewed his retreat. On May 20, they again retreated 8 miles further south to Cartersville. The month of May 1864 ended with Sherman&#x27;s forces attempting to move away from their railroad supply line with another turning movement, but became bogged down by the Confederates&#x27; fierce defenses at the Battle of New Hope Church on May 25, the Battle of Pickett&#x27;s Mill on May 27, and the Battle of Dallas on May 28.

In June, Sherman&#x27;s forces continued maneuvers around the northern approaches to Atlanta. The Battle of Kolb&#x27;s Farm ensued on June 22, followed by Sherman&#x27;s first (and only) attempt at a massive frontal assault in the Battle of Kennesaw Mountain on June 27, which Johnston vigorously repulsed. However, U.S. forces were within 17 miles of Atlanta by this time, threatening the city from the west and north. Johnston had yielded over 110 miles of mountainous, and thus more easily defensible, territory in just two months, while the Confederate government became increasingly frustrated and alarmed. When Johnston retreated across the Chattahoochee River, the final significant barrier before Atlanta, President Davis lost his patience.

In early July, Davis sent Gen. Braxton Bragg to Atlanta to assess the situation. After several meetings with local civilian leaders and Johnston&#x27;s subordinates, Bragg returned to Richmond and urged President Davis to replace Johnston. Davis removed Johnston from command on July 17, 1864, just outside Atlanta. &quot;The fate of Atlanta, from the Confederate standpoint, was all but decided by Johnston.&quot; His replacement, Lt. Gen. Hood, was left with the &quot;virtually impossible situation&quot; of defending Atlanta, which he was forced to abandon in September. Davis&#x27;s decision to remove Johnston was one of the most controversial of the war.

===North Carolina and surrender at Bennett Place===
After his relief, Johnston remained near Macon, Georgia, to recover from a stress-induced case of shingles. Between bouts, Johnston wrote his campaign report, which he shared privately with his allies in Richmond. In mid-November 1864, Johnson moved his wife closer to family at Columbia, South Carolina where he lingered in a state of virtual retirement. However, as the Confederacy became increasingly concerned about Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea across Georgia and then north through the Carolinas, the public clamored for Johnston&#x27;s return. The general in charge of the Western Theater, P.G.T. Beauregard, was making little progress against the advancing U.S. force. Political opponents of Jefferson Davis, such as Sen. Louis Wigfall, added to the pressure in Congress. Diarist Mary Chesnut wrote, &quot;We thought this was a struggle for independence. Now it seems it is only a fight between Joe Johnston and Jeff Davis.&quot; In January 1865, the Congress passed a law authorizing Robert E. Lee the powers of general in chief, and recommending that Johnston be reinstated as the commander of the Army of Tennessee. Davis immediately appointed Lee to the position, but refused to restore Johnston. In a lengthy unpublished memo, Davis wrote, &quot;My opinion of General Johnston&#x27;s unfitness for command has ripened slowly and against my inclinations into a conviction so settled that it would be impossible for me again to feel confidence in him as the commander of an army in the field.&quot; Vice President Alexander H. Stephens and 17 senators petitioned Lee to use his new authority to appoint Johnston, bypassing Davis, but the general in chief declined. Instead, he recommended the appointment to Davis.

Despite his serious misgivings, Davis restored Johnston to active duty on February 25, 1865. His new command comprised two military departments: the Department of South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida, and the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia; he assumed command of the latter department on March 6. These commands included three Confederate field armies, including the remnants of the once formidable Army of Tennessee, but they were armies in name only. The Tennessee army had been severely depleted at Franklin and Nashville, lacked sufficient supplies and ammunition, and the men had not been paid for months; only about 6,600 traveled to South Carolina. Johnston also had available 12,000 men under William J. Hardee, who had been unsuccessfully attempting to resist Sherman&#x27;s advance, Braxton Bragg&#x27;s force in Wilmington, North Carolina, and 6,000 cavalrymen under Wade Hampton.

Johnston, severely outnumbered, hoped to combine his force with a detachment of Robert E. Lee&#x27;s army from Virginia, jointly defeat Sherman, and then return to Virginia for an attack on Ulysses S. Grant. Lee initially refused to cooperate with this plan. (Following the fall of Richmond in April, Lee attempted to escape to North Carolina to join Johnston, but it was too late.) Recognizing that Sherman was moving quickly, Johnston planned to consolidate his small armies to land a blow against an isolated portion of Sherman&#x27;s army, advancing in two separate columns. On March 19, 1865, Johnston was able to catch the left wing of Sherman&#x27;s army by surprise at the Battle of Bentonville and briefly gained some tactical successes before superior numbers forced him to retreat to Raleigh, North Carolina. Unable to secure the capital, Johnston&#x27;s army withdrew to Greensboro.

After learning of Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Court House on April 9, Johnston agreed to meet with General Sherman between the lines at a small farm known as Bennett Place near present-day Durham, North Carolina. After three separate days (April 17, 18, and 26, 1865) of negotiations, Johnston surrendered the Army of Tennessee and all remaining Confederate forces still active in North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Florida. It was the largest surrender of the war, totaling 89,270 soldiers. President Davis considered that Johnston, surrendering so many troops that had not been explicitly defeated in battle, had committed an act of treason. Johnston was paroled on May 2 at Greensboro.

After the surrender, Sherman issued ten days&#x27; rations to the hungry Confederate soldiers as well as horses and mules to &quot;insure a crop.&quot; He also ordered the distribution of corn meal and flour to civilians throughout the South. This was an act of generosity that Johnston would never forget; he wrote to Sherman that his attitude &quot;reconciles me to what I have previously regarded as the misfortune of my life, that of having you to encounter in the field.&quot;

==Post-war years==
Johnston began to make a living for himself and his ailing wife. He became president of a small railroad, the Alabama and Tennessee River Railroad Company, which during his tenure of May 1866 to November 1867, was renamed the Selma, Rome and Dalton Railroad. Johnston was bored with the position, and the company failed for a lack of capital. He established Joseph E. Johnston &amp; Company, an insurance agency for New York Life Insurance Co. and a British insurance company, which Johnston operated out of Savannah (Ga.) from 1868 to 1877. The British company was Liverpool and London and Globe Insurance Company, and within four years had a network of more than 120 agents across the deep South.

The income from this venture allowed him to devote time to his great post-war activity, writing his memoirs, as did several fellow officers. His &quot;Narrative of Military Operations&quot; (1874) was highly critical of Davis and many of his fellow generals. He repeated his grievance about his ranking as a general in the Confederate Army and attempted to justify his career as a cautious campaigner. The book sold poorly, and its publisher failed to make a profit.

Although many Confederate generals criticized Johnston, Sherman and Grant portrayed him favorably in their memoirs. Sherman described him as a &quot;dangerous and wily opponent&quot; and criticized Johnston&#x27;s nemeses, Hood and Davis. Grant supported his decisions in the Vicksburg Campaign: &quot;Johnston evidently took in the situation, and wisely, I think, abstained from making an assault on us because it would simply have inflicted losses on both sides without accomplishing any result.&quot; Commenting on the Atlanta Campaign, Grant wrote, 
For my own part, I think that Johnston&#x27;s tactics were right. Anything that could have prolonged the war a year beyond the time that it finally did close, would probably have exhausted the North to such an extent that they might then have abandoned the contest and agreed to a settlement.

Johnston was a part owner of the Atlantic and Mexican Gulf Canal Company, a canal project approved in 1876. It was intended to construct a canal westward from the St. Marys River in Georgia to connect with the Gulf of Mexico on the coast of Florida.

Johnston moved from Savannah to Richmond in the winter of 1876–77. The former Confederate general was considered for service in President Rutherford B. Hayes&#x27;s Cabinet, particularly for the post of Secretary of War, but was ultimately not chosen. He served in the 46th Congress from 1879 to 1881 as a Democratic congressman, having been elected with 58.11% of the vote over Greenback candidate William W. Newman. He did not run for reelection in 1880. He was appointed as a commissioner of railroads in the administration of President Grover Cleveland. After his wife died in 1887, Johnston frequently traveled to veterans&#x27; gatherings, where he was universally cheered. In September 1890, a few months before he died, he was elected as an honorary member of the District of Columbia Society of the Sons of the American Revolution and was assigned national membership number 1963.

Johnston, like Lee, never forgot the magnanimity of the man to whom he surrendered. He would not allow criticism of Sherman in his presence. Sherman and Johnston corresponded frequently, and they met for friendly dinners in Washington, D.C. whenever Johnston traveled there. When Sherman died, Johnston served as an honorary pallbearer at his funeral. During the procession in New York City on February 19, 1891, he kept his hat off as a sign of respect, although the weather was cold and rainy. Someone concerned for his health asked him to put on his hat, to which Johnston replied, &quot;If I were in his place, and he were standing here in mine, he would not put on his hat.&quot; He did catch a cold that day, which developed into pneumonia, and Johnston died one month later in Washington, D.C. He was buried next to his wife in Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.

<text>Edward Porter Alexander (May 26, 1835 – April 28, 1910) was an American military engineer, railroad executive, planter, and author. He served first as an officer in the United States Army and later, during the American Civil War (1861–1865), in the Confederate Army, rising to the rank of brigadier general.

Alexander was the officer in charge of the massive artillery bombardment preceding Pickett&#x27;s Charge, on the third day of the Battle of Gettysburg, and is also noted for his early use of signals and observation balloons during combat. After the Civil War, he taught mathematics at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, spent time in Nicaragua, and wrote extensive memoirs and analyses of the war, which have received much praise for their insight and objectivity. His &quot;Military Memoirs of a Confederate&quot; were published in 1907. An extensive personal account of his military training and his participation in the Civil War was rediscovered long after his death and published in 1989 as &quot;Fighting for the Confederacy&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Alexander, known to his friends as Porter, was born in Washington, Georgia, into a wealthy and distinguished family of planters from the Antebellum South. He was the sixth of ten children of Adam Leopold Alexander and Sarah Hillhouse Gilbert Alexander. His mother was the granddaughter of Sarah Porter Hillhouse, the first female editor and printer in the United States. He became the brother-in-law of Alexander R. Lawton and Jeremy F. Gilmer. He graduated from the United States Military Academy at West Point in 1857, third in his class of 38 cadets, and was brevetted a second lieutenant of engineers. He briefly taught engineering and fencing at the academy before he was ordered to report for the Utah War expedition to Brig. Gen. Albert Sidney Johnston. That mission ended before he could reach Johnston, and Alexander returned to West Point. He participated in a number of weapon experiments and worked as an assistant to Major Albert J. Myer, the first officer assigned to the Signal Corps and the inventor of the code for &quot;wig-wag&quot; signal flags, or &quot;aerial telegraphy&quot;. Alexander was promoted to second lieutenant on October 10, 1858.

Alexander met Bettie Mason of Virginia in 1859 and married her on April 3, 1860. They would eventually have six children: Bessie Mason (born 1861), Edward Porter II and Lucy Roy (twins, born 1863), an unnamed girl (1865, died in infancy prior to naming), Adam Leopold (1867), and William Mason (1868). Lt. Alexander&#x27;s final assignments for the U.S. Army were at Fort Steilacoom, in the Washington Territory, and at Alcatraz Island, near San Francisco, California.

==Civil War service==
===Beginning of war===
After learning of the secession of his home state of Georgia, Alexander resigned his U.S. Army commission on May 1, 1861, to join the Confederate Army as a captain of engineers. While organizing and training new recruits to form a Confederate signal service, he was ordered to report to Brig. Gen. P.G.T. Beauregard at Manassas Junction, Virginia. He became the chief engineer and signal officer of the Confederate Army of the Potomac on June 3.

At the First Battle of Bull Run, Alexander made history by being the first to use signal flags to transmit a message during combat over a long distance. Stationed atop &quot;Signal Hill&quot; in Manassas, Alexander saw Union troop movements and signaled to the brigade under Col. Nathan &quot;Shanks&quot; Evans, &quot;Look out for your left, your position is turned&quot;. Upon receiving a similar message, Beauregard and Gen. Joseph E. Johnston sent timely reinforcements that turned the tide of battle in the Confederates&#x27; favor.

Alexander was promoted to major on July 1 and lieutenant colonel on December 31, 1861. During much of this period he was chief of ordnance, under Johnston&#x27;s command, managing supplies and ammunition in what later became the Army of Northern Virginia. He was also active in signal work and intelligence gathering, dealing extensively with spies operating around Washington, D.C.

During the early days of the Peninsula Campaign of 1862, Alexander continued as chief of ordnance under Johnston, but he also fought at the Battle of Williamsburg, under Maj. Gen. James Longstreet. When Gen. Robert E. Lee assumed command of the army, Alexander was in charge of pre-positioned ordnance for Lee&#x27;s offensive in the Seven Days Battles. Alexander continued his intelligence gathering by volunteering to go up in an observation balloon at Gaines&#x27; Mill on June 27, ascending several times and returning with valuable intelligence regarding the position of the Union Army.

Alexander continued in charge of ordnance for the Northern Virginia Campaign (Second Bull Run) and the Maryland Campaign (Antietam). He barely missed capture by Federal cavalry, under Col. Benjamin F. &quot;Grimes&quot; Davis, that had escaped from Harpers Ferry during the Maryland Campaign; over 40 of Longstreet&#x27;s 80 ammunition wagons were captured.

Porter Alexander is best known as an artilleryman who played a prominent role in many of the important battles of the war. He served in different artillery capacities for Longstreet&#x27;s First Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia, starting that role on November 7, 1862, after leaving Lee&#x27;s staff to command the battalion that was the corps&#x27; artillery reserve. He was promoted to colonel on December 5. He was instrumental in arranging the artillery in defense of Marye&#x27;s Heights at the Battle of Fredericksburg in December 1862, which proved to be the decisive factor in the Confederate victory. While the rest of Longstreet&#x27;s corps was located around Suffolk, Virginia, Alexander accompanied Stonewall Jackson on his flanking march at the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, and his artillery placements in Hazel Grove at Chancellorsville proved decisive.

===Gettysburg cannonade===
At the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederate artillery was outmatched in number of pieces, gunnery training, and especially quality and quantity of ammunition. The then 28 year old Alexander was in charge of artillery preparation for Pickett&#x27;s Charge, and given responsibility for assessing its success. The two hours&#x27; bombardment was the largest of the war, and explosions in the rear of the Union line caused by overshooting, in combination with Union guns deceptively ceasing to fire, made it seem to have destroyed enemy artillery. However, when the charge began, Union cannon opened up and inflicted severe casualties on the attackers. In his memoir, Alexander bemoaned that an artillery duel earlier in the multi-day battle had already wasted a lot of ammunition from the limited amount the Confederates had available, and that he lacked the authority to concentrate all Confederate artillery present for the bombardment. In his later writings, Alexander accused Lee of making fundamental errors at Gettysburg, as the Union position on high ground was too strong for an attack to be advisable, and Lee had ordered the assault on the center, which entailed Confederates advancing for three quarters of a mile while under fire and then being enfiladed as they closed with the Union line. Writing in 1901 Alexander said &quot;Never, never, never did Gen. Lee himself bollox a fight as he did this.&quot;

===Longstreet&#x27;s chief of artillery===
Alexander accompanied the First Corps to northern Georgia in the fall of 1863 to reinforce Gen. Braxton Bragg for the Battle of Chickamauga. He personally arrived too late to participate in the battle but served as Longstreet&#x27;s chief of artillery in the subsequent Knoxville Campaign and in the Department of East Tennessee in early 1864. He returned with the corps to Virginia for the remainder of the war, now with the rank of brigadier general (as of February 26, 1864). He served in all the battles of the Overland Campaign, and when Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant slipped around Lee&#x27;s army to cross the James River and assault Petersburg, Alexander was able to move his guns quickly through the lines, emplacing them to repel the main attack.

During the Siege of Petersburg, Alexander had to adapt his artillery tactics to trench warfare, including experimentation with various types of mortars. He became convinced that the Union forces were attempting to tunnel under the Confederate lines, but before he was able to act on this, on June 30, 1864, he was wounded in the shoulder by a sharpshooter. As he departed on medical leave to Georgia, he informed Lee of his suspicion. After unsuccessful attempts were made to locate the tunneling activity, the Battle of the Crater caught the Confederates by surprise although it ended in a significant Union defeat. Alexander returned to the Army in February 1865 and supervised the defenses of Richmond along the James River. He retreated along with Lee&#x27;s army in the Appomattox Campaign.

At Appomattox Court House, it was Alexander who made the famous proposal to Lee for the army to disperse, rather than surrender. Lee rebuked him, and Alexander later wrote about regretting his suggestion. Although the incident is sometimes described as a proposal for &quot;guerrilla war&quot;, Alexander describes his proposal in his memoir, &quot;Fighting for the Confederacy&quot;, as one in which &quot;the army may be ordered to scatter in the woods &amp; bushes &amp; either to rally upon Gen. Johnston in North Carolina, or to make their way, each man to his own state, with his arms, &amp; to report to his governor.&quot;

===Confederate gold===
Since the end of the Civil War, stories of the Confederate gold and its vast wealth have been told and retold. One of these stories involves Alexander. He helped organize search parties in Lincoln and Wilkes Counties. Alexander and bank officials soon located some of the gold through Alexander&#x27;s neighbors in Wilkes County and persuaded them that the money belonged to wives and children of Confederate veterans. With Alexander&#x27;s help, bank officials eventually recovered some $111,000 of the stolen money. Former Confederate cabinet official Robert Toombs also turned over $5,000 that, intentionally or accidentally, had been thrown into his yard in Washington.

==Later life==


After the surrender, Alexander briefly considered joining the Imperial Brazilian Army. Finding that he no longer desired the Georgia plantation life of his youth, he taught mathematics at the University of South Carolina in Columbia, and then served in executive positions with the Charlotte, Columbia, and Augusta Railroad (executive superintendent), the Savannah and Memphis Railroad (president), the Louisville and Nashville Railroad (president), and in the late 1880s the Central Rail Road and Banking Company of Georgia until 1891. During his employment at the Savannah and Memphis Railroad, the decision was made to route the railroad through Youngsville, Alabama. Youngsville was later renamed Alexander City in his honor.

Alexander was a member of the boards on the navigation of the Columbia River, Oregon, and on the ship canal between Chesapeake and Delaware bays, from 1892 to 1894. He became friends with Grover Cleveland and the two spent many hours hunting for ducks on Alexander&#x27;s estate. In May 1897, President Cleveland appointed Alexander as the arbiter of the commission tasked with fixing and demarcating the boundary between the Republics of Nicaragua and Costa Rica, with a view towards the possible construction of an interoceanic canal to be dug across Central America. Alexander spent two years at the head of that commission, headquartered in the coastal village of Greytown (now San Juan de Nicaragua). He completed the work to the satisfaction of the two governments and returned to the U.S. in October 1899. His wife Bettie became ill while he was in Nicaragua and she died shortly after his return, on November 20, 1899. In October 1901, Alexander married Mary Mason, his first wife&#x27;s niece.

Alexander was selected to give the Confederate veteran&#x27;s speech on Alumni Day during the centennial celebration at the United States Military Academy on June 9, 1902. The speech was so well received that it was reprinted in &quot;The New York Times&quot; in its entirety in the 15 June 1902 edition. The &quot;Times&quot; referred to the speech as &quot;decidedly the feature of Alumni Day.&quot; The audience included President Theodore Roosevelt as well as Alexander&#x27;s former commander, General Longstreet.
After the war, Alexander became a well-respected author. He wrote many magazine articles and published his &quot;Military Memoirs of a Confederate: A Critical Narrative&quot; (1907), praised by Douglas Southall Freeman as &quot;altogether the best critique of the operations of the Army of Northern Virginia.&quot; Long after his death, it was realized that Alexander had produced the &quot;Military Memoirs&quot;, which sought to be a professional work of military history and analysis, after a long effort of editing a collection of much more personal memoirs that he had started compiling during his time in Greytown, Nicaragua, at the behest of his family. Those earlier memoirs were edited and published posthumously in 1989 as &quot;Fighting for the Confederacy: The Personal Recollections of General Edward Porter Alexander&quot;, edited by Gary W. Gallagher.

Unlike such Confederate officers as Jubal Early and William Pendleton, Alexander eschewed the bitter Lost Cause theories of why the South was doomed to fail, given the overwhelming superiority of the North. He was willing to express in writing his criticisms of prominent Confederate officers, including General Lee himself. Many historians regard Alexander&#x27;s memoirs as among the most objective and sharpest sources produced by a Civil War combatant. David Eicher called &quot;Fighting for the Confederacy&quot; &quot;a superb personal narrative with a good deal of analysis of Lee&#x27;s operations ... Dramatic and revealing, an important source on the general, his fellow officers, and the Army of Northern Virginia.&quot; Alexander&#x27;s other books include &quot;Railway Practice&quot; (1887) and &quot;Catterel, Ratterel (Doggerel)&quot; (1888). Alexander died in Savannah, Georgia and is buried in Magnolia Cemetery, Augusta, Georgia. In 2006 he was inducted into the Georgia Aviation Hall of Fame.

==In popular culture==
Alexander was portrayed by James Patrick Stuart in the 1993 film &quot;Gettysburg&quot; and its 2003 prequel &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;.

In the alternate history novel &quot;How Few Remain&quot;, Alexander continues his career as a brigadier general in a victorious Confederacy.

Alexander is a character in the alternate history novels &quot;&quot; (2003), &quot;Grant Comes East&quot; (2004), and &quot;Never Call Retreat: Lee and Grant: The Final Victory&quot; (2005) by Newt Gingrich and William Forstchen.

Alexander is featured as a point of view character in &quot;Cain at Gettysburg&quot; by Ralph Peters.

Alexander is the protagonist of the 2023 playlet &quot;Alas, Confederates&quot; by James F. Bruns.

<text>Electronic business (also known as online business or e-business) is any kind of business or commercial activity that includes sharing information across the internet. Commerce constitutes the exchange of products and services between businesses, groups, and individuals; and can be seen as one of the essential activities of any business. 

E-commerce focuses on the use of ICT to enable the external activities and relationships of the business with individuals, groups, and other organizations, while e-business does not only deal with online commercial operations of enterprises, but also deals with their other organizational matters such as human resource management and production. The term &quot;e-business&quot; was coined by IBM&#x27;s marketing and Internet team in 1996.

==Market participants in electronic business==

Electronic business can take place between a very large number of market participants; it can be between business and consumer, private individuals, public administrations, or any other organizations such as non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
These various market participants can be divided into three main groups:
#Business (B)
#Consumer (C)
#Administration (A)
All of them can be either buyers or service providers within the market. There are nine possible combinations for electronic business relationships. B2C and B2B belong to E-commerce, while A2B and A2A belong to the E-government sector which is also a part of the electronic business.

== History ==
One of the founding pillars of electronic business was the development of the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) electronic data interchange. This system replaced traditional mailing and faxing of documents with a digital transfer of data from one computer to another, without any human intervention. 
Michael Aldrich is considered the developer of the predecessor to online shopping. In 1979, the entrepreneur connected a television set to a transaction processing computer with a telephone line and called it &quot;teleshopping&quot;, meaning shopping at distance.
From the mid-nineties, major advancements were made in the commercial use of the Internet. Amazon, which launched in 1995, started as an online bookstore and grew to become nowadays the largest online retailer worldwide, selling food, toys, electronics, apparel and more. Other successful stories of online marketplaces include eBay or Etsy. 
In 1994, IBM, with its agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather, began to use its foundation in IT solutions and expertise to market itself as a leader of conducting business on the Internet through the term &quot;e-business.&quot; Then CEO Louis V. Gerstner, Jr. was prepared to invest $1 billion to market this new brand.

After conducting worldwide market research in October 1997, IBM began with an eight-page piece in &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; that would introduce the concept of &quot;e-business&quot; and advertise IBM&#x27;s expertise in the new field. IBM decided &quot;not&quot; to trademark the term &quot;e-business&quot; in the hopes that other companies would use the term and create an entirely new industry. However, this proved to be too successful and by 2000, to differentiate itself, IBM launched a $300 million campaign about its &quot;e-business infrastructure&quot; capabilities. Since that time, the terms, &quot;e-business&quot; and &quot;e-commerce&quot; have been loosely interchangeable and have become a part of the common vernacular.

According to the U.S. Department Of Commerce, the estimated retail e-commerce sales in Q1 2020 were representing almost 12% of total U.S. retail sales, against 4% for Q1 2010.

==Business model==
The transformation toward e-business is complex and in order for it to succeed, there is a need to balance between strategy, an adapted business model (e-intermediary, marketplaces), right processes (sales, marketing) and technology (Supply Chain Management, Customer Relationship Management).
When organizations go online, they have to decide which e-business models best suit their goals. A business model is defined as the organization of product, service and information flows, and the source of revenues and benefits for suppliers and customers. The concept of the e-business model is the same but used in online presence.

=== Revenue model ===
A key component of the business model is the revenue model or profit model, which is a framework for generating revenues. It identifies which revenue source to pursue, what value to offer, how to price the value, and who pays for the value. It is a key component of a company&#x27;s business model. It primarily identifies what product or service will be created in order to generate revenues and the ways in which the product or service will be sold.

Without a well-defined revenue model, that is, a clear plan of how to generate revenues, new businesses will more likely struggle due to costs that they will not be able to sustain. By having a revenue model, a business can focus on a target audience, fund development plans for a product or service, establish marketing plans, begin a line of credit and raise capital.

==== E-commerce ====
E-commerce (short for &quot;electronic commerce&quot;) is trading in products or services using computer networks, such as the Internet. Electronic commerce draws on technologies such as mobile commerce, electronic funds transfer, supply chain management, Internet marketing, online transaction processing, electronic data interchange (EDI), inventory management systems, and automated data collection. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the World Wide Web for at least one part of the transaction&#x27;s life cycle, although it may also use other technologies such as e-mail.

==Concerns==
While much has been written of the economic advantages of Internet-enabled commerce, there is also evidence that some aspects of the internet such as maps and location-aware services may serve to reinforce economic inequality and the digital divide. Electronic commerce may be responsible for consolidation and the decline of mom-and-pop, brick and mortar businesses resulting in increases in income inequality. 

===Security===
E-business systems naturally have greater security risks than traditional business systems, therefore it is important for e-business systems to be fully protected against these risks. A far greater number of people have access to e-businesses through the internet than would have access to a traditional business. Customers, suppliers, employees, and numerous other people use any particular e-business system daily and expect their confidential information to stay secure. Hackers are one of the great threats to the security of e-businesses. Some common security concerns for e-Businesses include keeping business and customer information private and confidential, the authenticity of data, and data integrity. Some of the methods of protecting e-business security and keeping information secure include physical security measures as well as data storage, data transmission, anti-virus software, firewalls, and encryption to list a few.

====Privacy and confidentiality====
Confidentiality is the extent to which businesses makes personal information available to other businesses and individuals. With any business, confidential information must remain secure and only be accessible to the intended recipient. However, this becomes even more difficult when dealing with e-businesses specifically. To keep such information secure means protecting any electronic records and files from unauthorized access, as well as ensuring safe transmission and data storage of such information. Tools such as encryption and firewalls manage this specific concern within e-business.

====Authenticity====
E-business transactions pose greater challenges for establishing authenticity due to the ease with which electronic information may be altered and copied. Both parties in an e-business transaction want to have the assurance that the other party is who they claim to be, especially when a customer places an order and then submits a payment electronically. One common way to ensure this is to limit access to a network or trusted parties by using a virtual private network (VPN) technology. The establishment of authenticity is even greater when a combination of techniques are used, and such techniques involve checking &quot;something you know&quot; (i.e. password or PIN), &quot;something you need&quot; (i.e. credit card), or &quot;something you are&quot; (i.e. digital signatures or voice recognition methods). Many times in e-business, however, &quot;something you are&quot; is pretty strongly verified by checking the purchaser&#x27;s &quot;something you have&quot; (i.e. credit card) and &quot;something you know&quot; (i.e. card number).

====Data integrity====
Data integrity answers the question &quot;Can the information be changed or corrupted in any way?&quot; This leads to the assurance that the message received is identical to the message sent. A business needs to be confident that data is not changed in transit, whether deliberately or by accident. To help with data integrity, firewalls protect stored data against unauthorized access, while simply backing up data allows recovery should the data or equipment be damaged.

====Non-repudiation====
This concern deals with the existence of proof in a transaction. A business must have the assurance that the receiving party or purchaser cannot deny that a transaction has occurred, and this means having sufficient evidence to prove the transaction. One way to address non-repudiation is using digital signatures. A digital signature not only ensures that a message or document has been electronically signed by the person, but since a digital signature can only be created by one person, it also ensures that this person cannot later deny that they provided their signature.

====Access control====
When certain electronic resources and information is limited to only a few authorized individuals, a business and its customers must have the assurance that no one else can access the systems or information. There are a variety of techniques to address this concern including firewalls, access privileges, user identification and authentication techniques (such as passwords and digital certificates), Virtual Private Networks (VPN), and much more.

====Availability====
This concern is specifically pertinent to a business&#x27;s customers as certain information must be available when customers need it. Messages must be delivered in a reliable and timely fashion, and information must be stored and retrieved as required. Because the availability of service is important for all e-business websites, steps must be taken to prevent disruption of service by events such as power outages and damage to physical infrastructure. Examples to address this include data backup, fire-suppression systems, Uninterrupted Power Supply (UPS) systems, virus protection, as well as making sure that there is sufficient capacity to handle the demands posed by heavy network traffic.

====Cost structure====
The business internet which supports e-business has a cost to maintain of about $2 trillion in outsourced IT dollars just in the United States alone. With each website custom crafted and maintained in code, the maintenance burden is enormous. In the twenty-first century, look for new businesses that will help standardize the look and feel of the internet presence of a business to be more uniform in nature to help reduce the cost of maintenance.

The cost structure for e-businesses varies a lot from the industry they operate in. There are two major categories that have commune characteristics. The first group is fully digital businesses that do not provide any products or services outside of the digital world. This includes for example software companies, social networks, etc. For those, the most significant operational cost is the maintenance of the platform. Those costs are almost unrelated to every additional customer the business acquires, making the marginal cost almost equal to zero. This is one of the major advantages of that kind of business. The second group are businesses that provide services or products outside of the digital world, like online shops, for those costs are much harder to determine. Some common advantages over traditional businesses are lower marketing cost, lower inventory cost, lower payroll, lower rent, etc.

===Security solutions===

When it comes to security solutions, sustainable electronic business requires support for data integrity, strong authentication, and privacy. Numerous things can be done in order to protect our E-Business. Starting off with basic things like switch to HTTPS from old outdated HTTP protocol which is more vulnerable to attacks. Furthermore, the other things that require full attention are securing servers and admin panels, payment gateway security, antivirus and anti-malware software, using firewalls is also a must, regular updates, and back up our data.

====Access and data integrity====
There are several different ways to prevent access to the data that is kept online. One way is to use anti-virus software. This is something that most people use to protect their networks regardless of the data they have. E-businesses should use this because they can then be sure that the information sent and received to their system is clean.
A second way to protect the data is to use firewalls and network protection. A firewall is used to restrict access to private networks, as well as public networks that a company may use. The firewall also has the ability to log attempts into the network and provide warnings as it is happening. They are very beneficial to keep third parties out of the network. Businesses that use Wi-Fi need to consider different forms of protection because these networks are easier for someone to access. They should look into protected access, virtual private networks, or internet protocol security.
Another option they have is an intrusion detection system. This system alerts when there are possible intrusions. Some companies set up traps or &quot;hot spots&quot; to attract people and are then able to know when someone is trying to hack into that area.

====Encryption====
Encryption, which is actually a part of cryptography, involves transforming texts or messages into a code that is unreadable. These messages have to be decrypted in order to be understandable or usable for someone. There is a key that identifies the data to a certain person or company. With public-key encryption, there are actually two keys used. One is public and one is private. The public one is used for encryption and the private one for decryption. The level of the actual encryption can be adjusted and should be based on the information. The key can be just a simple slide of letters or a completely random mix-up of letters. This is relatively easy to implement because there is software that a company can purchase. A company needs to be sure that its keys are registered with a certificate authority.

====Digital certificates====
The point of a digital certificate is to identify the owner of a document. This way the receiver knows that it is an authentic document. Companies can use these certificates in several different ways. They can be used as a replacement for user names and passwords. Each employee can be given these to access the documents that they need from wherever they are.
These certificates also use encryption. They are a little more complicated than normal encryption, however. They actually used important information within the code. They do this in order to assure the authenticity of the documents as well as confidentiality and data integrity which always accompany encryption.
Digital certificates are not commonly used because they are confusing for people to implement. There can be complications when using different browsers, which means they need to use multiple certificates. The process is being adjusted so that it is easier to use.

====Digital signatures====
A final way to secure information online would be to use a digital signature. If a document has a digital signature on it, no one else is able to edit the information without being detected. That way if it is edited, it may be adjusted for reliability after the fact. In order to use a digital signature, one must use a combination of cryptography and a message digest. A message digest is used to give the document a unique value. That value is then encrypted with the sender&#x27;s private key.

==Advantages and disadvantages==

=== Advantages ===
When looking at e-business we have many advantages, which are mostly connected to making doing business easier. The benefits of implementing e-business tools are in the streamlining of business processes and not so much in the use of technology. Here are some:

* Easy to set up: electronic business is easy to set up even from home, the only requirements are software, a device and an internet connection.
* Flexible business hours: There are no time barriers that a location-based business can encounter since the internet is available to everyone all the time. Your products and services can be accessed by everyone with an internet connection.
* Cheaper than traditional business: Electronic business is less costly than a traditional business, but it is more expensive to set up. Transactions cost are also cheaper.
* No geographical boundaries: The greatest benefit is the possibility of geographical dispersion. Anyone can order anything from anywhere at any time.   
* Government subsidies: Digitalisation is very encouraged by the government and they provide the necessary support.
* Newmarket entry: It has a great potential to enable an entry to a previously unknown market that a traditional business could not.
*Lower levels of inventory: Electronic business enables companies to lower their level of inventory by digitalizing their assets. (i.e.: Netflix does not sell anymore physical DVDs but proposes online streaming content instead).
*Lower costs of marketing and sales: E-commerce allows the actors of the industry to advertise for their product/service offer (i.e.: house rental) at generally lower costs than by promoting physically their business.

=== Disadvantages ===
Despite all the limits, there are also some disadvantages that we need to address. The most common limitations of electronic business are:

* Lack of personal touch: The products cannot be examined or felt before the final purchase.  In the traditional model, we have a more personal customer experience, while in the electronic business that is mostly not the case. Another missing factor of personal touch could also be in online transactions.
* Delivery time: Traditional business enables instant satisfaction as you obtain the product the moment you purchase it, while in electronic business that is not possible. There will always be a waiting period before you receive the product. For example, Amazon assures one-day delivery. This does not resolve the issue completely, but it is an improvement.
* Security issues: Scams could be mentioned as a factor for people&#x27;s distrust in electronic business. Hackers can easily get customers&#x27; financial and personal details. Some customer still finds it hard to trust electronic businesses because of the lack of security, reliability and integrity issues.

<doc id="264467" wikidata="Q380562" url="?curid=264467" title="Braxton Bragg">
<text>Braxton Bragg (March 22, 1817 – September 27, 1876) was an American army officer during the Second Seminole War and Mexican–American War and Confederate general in the Confederate Army during the American Civil War, serving in the Western Theater. His most important role was as commander of the Army of Mississippi, later renamed the Army of Tennessee, from June 1862 until December 1863.

Bragg, a native of Warrenton, North Carolina, was educated at West Point and became an artillery officer. He served in Florida and then received three brevet promotions for distinguished service in the Mexican–American War, most notably the Battle of Buena Vista. He resigned from the U.S. Army in 1856 to become a sugar plantation owner in Louisiana. At the start of the Civil War, Bragg trained soldiers in the Gulf Coast region. He was a corps commander at the Battle of Shiloh, where he launched several costly and unsuccessful frontal assaults but nonetheless was commended for his conduct and bravery.

In June 1862, Bragg was elevated to command the Army of Mississippi (later known as the Army of Tennessee). He and Brigadier General Edmund Kirby Smith attempted an invasion of Kentucky in 1862, but Bragg retreated following a minor tactical victory at the Battle of Perryville in October. In December, he fought another battle at Murfreesboro, Tennessee, the Battle of Stones River, against the Army of the Cumberland under Major General William Rosecrans. After a bloody and inconclusive battle, it ended with his retreat. After months without significant fighting, Bragg was outmaneuvered by Rosecrans in the Tullahoma Campaign in June 1863, causing him to surrender Middle Tennessee to the Union. Bragg retreated to Chattanooga but evacuated it in September as Rosecrans&#x27; troops entered Georgia. Later that month, with the assistance of Confederate forces from the Eastern Theater under James Longstreet, Bragg was able to defeat Rosecrans at the Battle of Chickamauga, the bloodiest battle in the Western Theater, and the only significant Confederate victory therein. Bragg forced Rosecrans back into Tennessee, but was criticized for the heavy casualties his army suffered and for not mounting an effective pursuit. In November, Bragg&#x27;s army was routed by Major General Ulysses S. Grant in the Battles for Chattanooga and pushed back to Georgia. Confederate President Jefferson Davis subsequently relieved Bragg of command, recalling him to Richmond as his chief military advisor. Bragg briefly returned to the field as a corps commander near the war&#x27;s end during the Campaign of the Carolinas.

Bragg is generally considered among the worst generals of the Civil War. Most of the battles he engaged in ended in defeat. Bragg was extremely unpopular with both the officers and ordinary men under his command, who criticized him for numerous perceived faults, including poor battlefield strategy, a quick temper, and overzealous discipline. Bragg has a generally poor reputation with historians, though some point towards the failures of Bragg&#x27;s subordinates, especially Major General and former Bishop Leonidas Polk—a close ally of Davis and known enemy of Bragg—as more significant factors in the many Confederate defeats under Bragg&#x27;s command. The losses suffered by Bragg&#x27;s forces are cited as highly consequential to the ultimate defeat of the Confederate States of America.

== Early life and education ==
Braxton Bragg was born in Warrenton, North Carolina, one of the six sons of Thomas and Margaret Crosland Bragg. One of his older brothers was future Confederate Attorney General Thomas Bragg. Bragg was also a cousin of Edward S. Bragg, who would become a Union general in the Civil War. He was often ridiculed as a child because of rumors about his mother&#x27;s prison sentence for allegedly murdering an African American freeman, and some of those rumors stated that he was born in prison. Grady McWhiney, the principal biographer of Bragg&#x27;s early life and career, states that the Bragg family was law-abiding despite these rumors. Although considered by his neighbors to be from the lower class, Thomas Bragg was a carpenter and contractor who became wealthy enough to send Braxton to the Warrenton Male Academy, one of the best schools in the state. He was descended from Captain Christopher Newport of Jamestown, Virginia, and his son-in-law Thomas Bragg (1579–1665), who was born in England and settled in the Colony of Virginia. In the thousands of letters that Bragg wrote during his lifetime, he spoke fondly of his father, but never mentioned his mother.

== West Point ==
When Bragg was only ten years old, his father decided on a military career for him and sought ways to obtain a nomination to the United States Military Academy. Eventually, the oldest Bragg son, John, who had recently been elected as a state legislator, obtained the support of U.S. Senator for North Carolina Willie P. Mangum. With Mangum as his sponsor, West Point admitted Braxton at the age of 16. His classmates included notable future Civil War Union generals Joseph Hooker and John Sedgwick, and future Confederate generals John C. Pemberton, Jubal Early, and William H. T. Walker. Bragg did well in academic pursuits because of his superior memory rather than diligent study and received fewer disciplinary demerits than most of his contemporaries. He graduated fifth of fifty cadets from the West Point Class of 1837 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery.

== Military service ==

=== Early career ===
Bragg served in the Second Seminole War in Florida, initially as an assistant commissary officer and regimental adjutant, seeing no actual combat. He soon began to suffer from a series of illnesses that he blamed on the tropical climate. He sought a medical transfer and was briefly assigned to recruiting duty in Philadelphia, but in October 1840, he was ordered back to Florida. He became a company commander in the 3rd Artillery and commanded Fort Marion, near St. Augustine. In this assignment, he stayed relatively healthy but tended toward overwork, laboring administratively to improve the living conditions of his men. He launched a series of argumentative letters with senior Army officials, including the adjutant general and Army paymaster, that established his reputation as &quot;disputatious&quot;.

Bragg had a reputation for being a disciplinarian who strictly adhered to regulations. There is a famous apocryphal story, included in Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s memoirs, about Bragg as a company commander at a frontier post where he also served as quartermaster. He submitted a requisition for supplies for his company, then, as quartermaster, declined to fill it. As company commander, he resubmitted the requisition, giving additional reasons for his requirements, but as the quartermaster, he denied the request again. Realizing that he was at a personal impasse, he referred the matter to the post commandant, who exclaimed, &quot;My God, Mr. Bragg, you have quarreled with every officer in the army, and now you are quarreling with yourself!&quot; While Grant did circulate the story, he admitted that he knew nothing of its truthfulness and no one else came forward to attest to its veracity.

It is alleged that some of Bragg&#x27;s troops attempted to assassinate him on two occasions in August and September 1847, but he was not injured either time. In the more serious of the two incidents, one of his soldiers detonated a 12-pound artillery shell underneath his cot. Although the cot was destroyed, Bragg himself somehow emerged without a scratch. Bragg had suspicions about the perpetrator&#x27;s identity but had insufficient evidence to bring charges. Later, an Army deserter named Samuel R. Church claimed responsibility for the attack.

The 3rd Artillery relocated to Fort Moultrie, Charleston, South Carolina, in 1843. Here, Bragg was stationed with three future Union Army generals that he came to consider close friends: George H. Thomas, John F. Reynolds (both of whom were lieutenants who reported to Bragg) and William T. Sherman. Bragg continued his controversial writing, this time a series of nine articles published 1844–45 in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot;. The series, &quot;Notes on Our Army,&quot; published anonymously (as &quot;A Subaltern&quot;), included specific attacks on the policies of general in chief Winfield Scott, whom he called a &quot;vain, petty, conniving man.&quot; There were also numerous attacks on Army administrative policies and officers. He included thoughtful recommendations on a proposed structure for the Army general staff that were ignored at the time but echoed in reorganizations that occurred in the early 20th century.

Bragg&#x27;s articles came to the attention of Representative James G. Clinton, a New York Democrat and political opponent of Scott&#x27;s. While Bragg was on leave in Washington, D.C., in March 1844, Clinton called him to testify before his House Committee on Public Expenditures. Scott ordered him not to testify, in defiance of the Congressional subpoena. Bragg was arrested and sent to Fort Monroe, Virginia, where he was court-martialed for disobeying orders and disrespecting his superior officers. Bragg conducted his own defense and attempted to turn the trial into a condemnation of Scott. He was found guilty, but an official reprimand from the Secretary of War and suspension at half pay for two months were relatively mild punishments, and Bragg was not deterred from future criticisms of his superiors.

=== Mexican–American War ===

In the summer of 1845, Bragg and his artillery company were ordered to join Gen. Zachary Taylor in the defense of Texas from Mexico. He won promotions for bravery and distinguished conduct in the Mexican–American War, including a brevet promotion to captain for the Battle of Fort Brown (May 1846), to major for the Battle of Monterrey (September 1846), and to lieutenant colonel for the Battle of Buena Vista (February 1847). Bragg was also promoted to captain within the regular army in June 1846. He became widely admired in Taylor&#x27;s army for the discipline and drill of his men and the newly tried tactics of light artillery that proved decisive in most of his engagements against the Mexican Army. But it was Buena Vista that brought him national fame. His timely placement of artillery into a gap in the line helped repulse a numerically superior Mexican attack. He fought in support of Col. Jefferson Davis and the Mississippi Rifles, which earned him the admiration of the future U.S. Secretary of War and president of the Confederacy.

An anecdote circulated about Gen. Taylor commanding, &quot;A little more of the grape, Capt. Bragg,&quot; which caused him to redouble his efforts and save the day. The stories are probably apocryphal and, according to the diary of Ethan Allen Hitchcock, Taylor&#x27;s Chief of Staff (and recent son-in-law) Maj. William Bliss confirmed that &quot;the stories of the General in connection with Bragg are all false. He never said, &#x27;A little more grape, Captain Bragg,&#x27; nor did he say, &#x27;Major Bliss and I will support you.&#x27;&quot; Nevertheless, Bragg returned to the United States as a popular hero. A northwestern outpost, Fort Bragg, California, was named in his honor. The citizens of Warrenton presented him with a ceremonial sword. Congressman David Outlaw wrote about the honor: &quot;Col. Bragg having, no thanks to them, won for himself a brilliant reputation, is now the object of the most fulsome adulation. Those who formerly sneered at the Braggs as plebeians, as unfit associates for them, they are glad to honor. With what scorn must Col. Bragg, in his secret heart regard them.&quot; Bragg traveled to New York, Washington, Mobile, and New Orleans, and in each place, he was honored.

On December 31, 1855, Bragg submitted his resignation from the Army, which became effective on January 3, 1856. He and his wife purchased a sugar plantation of north of Thibodaux, Louisiana. Never one to oppose slavery in concept—his father and wife were slave owners—he used 105 enslaved African-Americans on his property. He continued to uphold his reputation as a stern disciplinarian and an advocate of military efficiency. His methods resulted in almost immediate profitability, despite a large mortgage on the property. He became active in local politics and was elected to the Board of Public Works in 1860. Throughout the 1850s, Bragg had been disturbed by the accelerating sectional crisis. He opposed the concept of secession, believing that no majority could set aside a written constitution in a republic, but this belief would soon be tested.

=== American Civil War ===
Before the start of the Civil War, Bragg was a colonel in the Louisiana Militia. On December 12, 1860, Governor Thomas O. Moore appointed him to the state military board, an organization charged with creating a 5,000-man army. He took the assignment even though he had been opposed to secession. On January 11, 1861, Bragg led a group of 500 volunteers to Baton Rouge, where they persuaded the commander of the federal arsenal there to surrender. The state convention on secession also established a state army, and Moore appointed Bragg its commander, with the rank of major general, on February 20, 1861. He commanded the forces around New Orleans until April 16, but his commission was transferred to be a brigadier general of the Confederate States Army on March 7, 1861. He commanded forces in Pensacola, Florida, Alabama, and the Department of West Florida and was promoted to major general on September 12, 1861. His tenure was successful, and he trained his men to be some of the best-disciplined troops in the Confederate Army, such as the 5th Georgia and the 6th Florida Regiments.

In December, President Davis asked Bragg to take command of the Trans-Mississippi Department, but Bragg declined. He was concerned about the prospects of victory west of the Mississippi River and the poorly supplied and ill-disciplined troops there. He was also experiencing one of the periodic episodes of ill health that plagued him throughout the war. For years he had suffered from rheumatism, dyspepsia, nerves, and severe migraine headaches, which undoubtedly contributed to his disagreeable personal style. The command went to Earl Van Dorn. Bragg proposed to Davis that he change his strategy of attempting to defend every square mile of Confederate territory, recommending that his troops were of less value on the Gulf Coast than they would be farther to the north, concentrated with other forces for an attack against the Union Army in Tennessee. Bragg transported about 10,000 men to Corinth, Mississippi, in February 1862 and was charged with improving the poor discipline of the Confederate troops already assembled under General Albert Sidney Johnston.

==== Battle of Shiloh ====

Bragg commanded a corps (and was also chief of staff) under Johnston at the Battle of Shiloh, April 6–7, 1862. In the initial surprise Confederate advance, Bragg&#x27;s corps was ordered to attack in a line almost long, but he soon began directing activities of the units that found themselves around the center of the battlefield. His men became bogged down against a Union salient called the Hornet&#x27;s Nest, which he attacked for hours with piecemeal frontal assaults. After Johnston was killed in the battle, General P. G. T. Beauregard assumed command and appointed Bragg his second in command. Bragg was dismayed when Beauregard called off a late afternoon assault against the Union&#x27;s final position, which was vigorously defended, calling it their last opportunity for victory. On the second day of battle, the Union army counterattacked, and the Confederates retreated to Corinth.

Bragg received public praise for his conduct in the battle. On April 12, 1862, Jefferson Davis appointed Bragg a full general, the sixth man to achieve that rank and one of only seven in the history of the Confederacy. His date of rank was April 6, 1862, coinciding with the first day at Shiloh. After the Siege of Corinth, Beauregard departed on sick leave, leaving Bragg in temporary command of the army in Tupelo, Mississippi. Still, Beauregard failed to inform President Davis of his departure and spent two weeks absent without leave. Davis was looking for someone to replace Beauregard because of his perceived poor performance at Corinth, and the opportunity presented itself when Beauregard left without permission. Bragg was then appointed his successor as commander of the Western Department (known formally as Department Number Two), including the Army of Mississippi, on June 17, 1862.

==== Battle of Perryville ====

In August 1862, Confederate Maj. Gen. Edmund Kirby Smith decided to invade Kentucky from Eastern Tennessee, hoping that he could arouse supporters of the Confederate cause in the border state and draw the Union forces under Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, beyond the Ohio River. Bragg considered various options, including an attempt to retake Corinth or to advance against Buell&#x27;s army through Middle Tennessee. He eventually heeded Kirby Smith&#x27;s calls for reinforcement and decided to relocate his Army of Mississippi to join him. He moved 30,000 soldiers in a tortuous railroad journey from Tupelo through Mobile and Montgomery to Chattanooga, while his cavalry and artillery moved by road. Although Bragg was the senior general in the theater, President Davis had established Kirby Smith&#x27;s Department of East Tennessee as an independent command, reporting directly to Richmond. This decision caused Bragg difficulty during the campaign.

Smith and Bragg met in Chattanooga on 31 July 1862. They devised a plan for the campaign: Kirby Smith&#x27;s Army of Kentucky would first march into Kentucky to dispose of the Union defenders of Cumberland Gap. (Bragg&#x27;s army was too exhausted from its long journey to begin immediate offensive operations.) Smith would return to join Bragg, and their combined forces would attempt to maneuver into Buell&#x27;s rear and force a battle to protect his supply lines. Once the armies were combined, Bragg&#x27;s seniority would apply, and Smith would be under his direct command. Assuming that Buell&#x27;s army could be destroyed, Bragg and Smith would march farther north into Kentucky, a movement they assumed would be welcomed by the local populace. Any remaining Federal force would be defeated in a grand battle in Kentucky, establishing the Confederate frontier at the Ohio River.

On August 9, Smith informed Bragg that he was breaking the agreement and intended to bypass Cumberland Gap, leaving a small holding force to neutralize the Union garrison and move north. Unable to command Smith to honor their plan, Bragg focused on a movement to Lexington instead of Nashville. He cautioned Smith that Buell could pursue and defeat his smaller army before Bragg&#x27;s army could join them.

Bragg departed from Chattanooga on August 27, just before Smith reached Lexington. On the way, he was distracted by the capture of a Union fort at Munfordville. He had to decide whether to continue toward a fight with Buell (over Louisville) or rejoin Smith, who had gained control of the center of the state by capturing Richmond and Lexington and threatened to move on Cincinnati. Bragg chose to rejoin Smith. He left his army and met Smith in Frankfort, where they attended the inauguration of Confederate Governor Richard Hawes on October 4. The inauguration ceremony was disrupted by the sound of approaching Union cannon fire, and the organizers canceled the inaugural ball scheduled for that evening.

On October 8, the armies met unexpectedly at the Battle of Perryville; they had skirmished the previous day as they were searching for nearby water sources. Bragg ordered the wing of his army under Maj. Gen. Leonidas Polk to attack what he thought was an isolated portion of Buell&#x27;s command but had difficulty motivating Polk to begin the fight until Bragg arrived in person. Eventually, Polk attacked the corps of Maj. Gen. Alexander M. McCook on the Union army&#x27;s left flank and forced it to fall back. By the end of the day, McCook had been driven back about a mile, but reinforcements had arrived to stabilize the line, and Bragg only then began to realize that his limited tactical victory in the bloody battle had been against less than half of Buell&#x27;s army and the remainder was arriving quickly.

Kirby Smith pleaded with Bragg to follow up on his success: &quot;For God&#x27;s sake, General, let us fight Buell here.&quot; Bragg replied, &quot;I will do it, sir,&quot; but then displayed what one observer called &quot;a perplexity and vacillation which had now become simply appalling to Smith, to Hardee, and to Polk,&quot; he ordered his army to retreat through the Cumberland Gap to Knoxville. Bragg referred to his retreat as a withdrawal, the successful culmination of a giant raid. He had multiple reasons for withdrawing. Disheartening news had arrived from northern Mississippi that Earl Van Dorn and Sterling Price had been defeated at Corinth, just as Robert E. Lee had failed in his Maryland Campaign. He saw that his army had little to gain from a further, isolated victory, whereas a defeat might cost not only the bountiful food and supplies yet collected but also his army. He wrote to his wife, &quot;With the whole southwest thus in the enemy&#x27;s possession, my crime would have been unpardonable had I kept my noble little army to be ice-bound in the northern clime, without tents or shoes, and obliged to forage daily for bread, etc.&quot; He was quickly called to Richmond to explain to Jefferson Davis the charges brought by his officers about how he had conducted his campaign, demanding that he be replaced as head of the army. Although Davis decided to leave the general in command, Bragg&#x27;s relationship with his subordinates would be severely damaged. Upon rejoining the army, he ordered a movement to Murfreesboro, Tennessee.

==== Battle of Stones River ====
Bragg renamed his force the Army of Tennessee on November 20, 1862. Meanwhile, on October 24, Don Carlos Buell was replaced as commander of the Union Army of the Ohio by Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans, who immediately renamed it the Army of the Cumberland. In late December, Rosecrans advanced from Nashville against Bragg&#x27;s position at Murfreesboro. Before Rosecrans could attack, Bragg launched a strong surprise attack against Rosecrans&#x27;s right flank on December 31, 1862, the start of the Battle of Stones River. The Confederates drove the Union army back to a small defensive position. Still, they could not destroy it or break its supply line to Nashville, as Bragg intended. Despite this, Bragg considered the first day of battle a victory and assumed that Rosecrans would soon retreat. By January 2, 1863, however, the Union troops remained in place, and the battle resumed as Bragg launched an unsuccessful attack by the troops of Maj. Gen. John C. Breckinridge against the well-defended Union left flank. Recognizing his lack of progress, the severe winter weather, the arrival of supplies and reinforcements for Rosecrans, and heeding the recommendations of corps commanders Hardee and Polk, Bragg withdrew his army from the field to Tullahoma, Tennessee.

Bragg&#x27;s generals were vocal in their dissatisfaction with his command during the Kentucky campaign and Stones River. He reacted to the rumors of criticism by circulating a letter to his corps and division commanders that asked them to confirm in writing that they had recommended withdrawing after the latter battle, stating that if he had misunderstood them and withdrawn mistakenly, he would willingly step down. Unfortunately, he wrote the letter when several of his most faithful supporters were on leave for illness or wounds. Bragg&#x27;s critics, including William J. Hardee, interpreted the letter as having an implied secondary question—had Bragg lost the confidence of his senior commanders? Leonidas Polk did not reply to the implied question but wrote directly to his friend, Jefferson Davis, recommending that Bragg be replaced.

Davis responded to the complaints by dispatching Gen. Joseph E. Johnston to investigate the army&#x27;s condition. Davis assumed that Johnston, Bragg&#x27;s superior, would find the situation wanting and take command of the army in the field, easing Bragg aside. However, Johnston arrived on the scene and found the men of the Army of Tennessee in relatively good condition. He told Bragg he had &quot;the best organized, armed, equipped, and disciplined army in the Confederacy.&quot; Johnston explicitly refused any suggestion that he take command, concerned that people would think he had taken advantage of the situation for his own personal gain. When Davis ordered Johnston to send Bragg to Richmond, Johnston delayed because of Elise Bragg&#x27;s illness; when her health improved, Johnston could not assume command because of lingering medical problems from his wound at the Battle of Seven Pines in 1862.

==== Tullahoma Campaign ====

As Bragg&#x27;s army fortified Tullahoma, Rosecrans spent the next six months in Murfreesboro, resupplying and retraining his army to resume its advance. Rosecrans&#x27;s initial movements on June 23, 1863, surprised Bragg. While keeping Polk&#x27;s corps occupied with small actions in the center of the Confederate line, Rosecrans sent the majority of his army around Bragg&#x27;s right flank. Bragg was slow to react, and his subordinates were typically uncooperative: the mistrust among the Army of Tennessee general officers for the past months led to little direct communication about strategy, and neither Polk nor Hardee had a firm understanding of Bragg&#x27;s plans. As the Union army outmaneuvered the Confederates, Bragg was forced to abandon Tullahoma and, on July 4, retreated behind the Tennessee River. Tullahoma is recognized as a &quot;brilliant&quot; campaign for Rosecrans, achieving his goal of driving Bragg from Middle Tennessee with minimal losses. Judith Hallock wrote that Bragg was &quot;outfoxed&quot; and that his ill health may have been partially to blame for his performance. Still, her overall assessment was that he performed credibly during the retreat from Tullahoma, keeping his army intact under difficult circumstances.

Although the Army of Tennessee had about 52,000 men at the end of July, the Confederate government merged the Department of East Tennessee, under Maj. Gen. Simon B. Buckner, into Bragg&#x27;s Department of Tennessee, which added 17,800 men to Bragg&#x27;s army, but also extended his command responsibilities northward to the Knoxville area. This brought a third subordinate into Bragg&#x27;s command who had little or no respect for him. Buckner&#x27;s attitude was colored by Bragg&#x27;s unsuccessful invasion of Buckner&#x27;s native Kentucky in 1862 and by the loss of his command through the merger. A positive aspect for Bragg was Hardee&#x27;s request to be transferred to Mississippi in July, but he was replaced by Lt. Gen. Daniel Harvey Hill, a general who had not gotten along with Robert E. Lee in Virginia.

In early August, the Confederate War Department asked Bragg if he could assume the offensive against Rosecrans if he were given reinforcements from Mississippi. He demurred, concerned about the daunting geographical obstacles and logistical challenges, preferring to wait for Rosecrans to solve those same problems and attack him. An opposed crossing of the Tennessee River was not feasible, so Rosecrans devised a deception to distract Bragg above Chattanooga while the army crossed downstream. Bragg was rightly concerned about a sizable Union force under Maj. Gen. Ambrose E. Burnside that was threatening Knoxville to the northeast, and Rosecrans reinforced this concern by feinting to his left and shelling the city of Chattanooga from the heights north of the river. The bulk of the Union army crossed the Tennessee southeast of Chattanooga by September 4, and Bragg realized that his position there was no longer tenable. He evacuated the city on September 8.

==== Battle of Chickamauga ====
After Rosecrans had consolidated his gains and secured his hold in Chattanooga, he began moving his army into northern Georgia in pursuit of Bragg. Bragg continued to suffer from the conduct of his subordinates, who were not attentive to his orders. On September 10, Maj. Gens. Thomas C. Hindman and Daniel Harvey Hill refused to attack, as ordered, an outnumbered Federal column at McLemore&#x27;s Cove (the Battle of Davis&#x27;s Cross Roads). On September 13, Bragg ordered Leonidas Polk to attack Maj. Gen. Thomas L. Crittenden&#x27;s corps, but Polk ignored the orders and demanded more troops, insisting that it was he who was about to be attacked. Rosecrans used the time lost in these delays to concentrate his scattered forces. Finally, on September 19–20, 1863, Bragg, reinforced by two divisions from Mississippi, one division and several brigades from the Department of East Tennessee, and two divisions under Lt. Gen. James Longstreet from Robert E. Lee&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia, turned on the pursuing Rosecrans in northeastern Georgia and at high cost defeated him at the Battle of Chickamauga, the greatest Confederate victory in the Western Theater during the war. It was not a complete victory, however. Bragg aimed to cut off Rosecrans from Chattanooga and destroy his army. Instead, following a partial rout of the Union army by Longstreet&#x27;s wing, a stout defense by Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas allowed Rosecrans and almost all of his army to escape. The success also came with an enormous cost. Bragg&#x27;s army suffered 18,450 casualties, making this the costliest Confederate victory of the entire war.

After the battle, Rosecrans&#x27;s Army of the Cumberland retreated to Chattanooga, where Bragg laid siege to the city. He began to wage a battle against the subordinates he resented for failing him in the campaign—Hindman for his lack of action in McLemore&#x27;s Cove and Polk for delaying the morning attack Bragg ordered on September 20. On September 29, Bragg suspended both officers from their commands. In early October, an attempted mutiny of Bragg&#x27;s subordinates resulted in D. H. Hill being relieved from his command. Longstreet was dispatched with his corps to the Knoxville Campaign against Ambrose Burnside, seriously weakening Bragg&#x27;s army at Chattanooga.

Some of Bragg&#x27;s subordinate generals were frustrated at what they perceived to be his lack of willingness to exploit the victory by pursuing the Union army toward Chattanooga and destroying it. Polk, in particular, was outraged at being relieved of command. The dissidents, including many division and corps commanders, met secretly and prepared a petition to President Jefferson Davis. Although the petition&#x27;s author is unknown, historians suspect it was Simon Buckner, whose signature was first on the list. Lt. Gen. James Longstreet wrote to the Secretary of War with the prediction that &quot;nothing but the hand of God can save us or help us as long as we have our present commander.&quot; With the Army of Tennessee literally on the verge of mutiny, Jefferson Davis reluctantly traveled to Chattanooga to assess the situation and try to stem the tide of dissent in the army. Although Bragg offered to resign to resolve the crisis, Davis eventually decided to leave Bragg in command, denounced the other generals, and termed their complaints &quot;shafts of malice&quot;.

==== Battles for Chattanooga ====
While Bragg fought with his subordinates and reduced his force by dispatching Longstreet to Knoxville, the besieged Union army received a new commander—Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant—and significant reinforcements from Mississippi and Virginia. The Battles for Chattanooga marked Bragg&#x27;s final days as an army commander. His weakened left flank (previously manned by Longstreet&#x27;s troops) fell on November 24 during the Battle of Lookout Mountain. The following day in the Battle of Missionary Ridge, his primary defensive line successfully resisted an attack on its right flank. Still, the center was overwhelmed in a frontal assault by George Thomas&#x27;s army. The Army of Tennessee was routed and retreated to Dalton, Georgia. Bragg offered his resignation on November 29 and was chagrined when Davis accepted it immediately. He turned over temporary command to Hardee on December 2 and was replaced with Joseph E. Johnston, who commanded the army in the 1864 Atlanta Campaign against William T. Sherman.

==== Advisor to the President ====

In February 1864, Bragg was summoned to Richmond for consultation with Davis. The orders for his new assignment on February 24 read that he was &quot;charged with the conduct of military operations of the Confederate States&quot;, but he was essentially Davis&#x27;s military adviser or chief of staff without a direct command, a post once held by Robert E. Lee. Bragg used his organizational abilities to reduce corruption and improve the supply system. He took over responsibility for administrating the military prison system and its hospitals. He reshaped the Confederacy&#x27;s conscription process by streamlining the chain of command and reducing conscripts&#x27; avenues of appeal. During his tenure in Richmond, he had numerous quarrels with significant figures, including the Secretary of War, the Commissary General, members of Congress, the press, and many of his fellow generals; the exception to the latter was Robert E. Lee, who treated Bragg politely and with deference and who had, Bragg knew, an exceptionally close relationship with the president.

In May, while Lee was defending against Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Overland Campaign in Virginia, Bragg focused on defending areas south and west of Richmond. He convinced Jefferson Davis to appoint P.G.T. Beauregard to an important role in defense of Richmond and Petersburg. Meanwhile, Davis was concerned that Joseph Johnston, Bragg&#x27;s successor in the Army of Tennessee, was defending too timidly against Sherman&#x27;s Atlanta Campaign. He sent Bragg to Georgia on July 9, charged with investigating the tactical situation and evaluating the replacement of Johnston in command. Bragg harbored the hope that he might be chosen to return to command of the army but was willing to support Davis&#x27;s choice. Davis had hinted to Bragg that he thought Hardee would be an appropriate successor. Still, Bragg was reluctant to promote an old enemy and reported that Hardee would provide no change in strategy from Johnston&#x27;s. Bragg had extensive conversations with a more junior corps commander, Lt. Gen. John Bell Hood, and was impressed with his plans for taking offensive action, about which Hood had also been confidentially corresponding to Richmond for weeks behind Johnston&#x27;s back. Davis chose Hood to replace Johnston.

==== Operations in North Carolina ====
In October 1864, President Davis sent Bragg to assume temporary command of the defenses of Wilmington, North Carolina. His responsibility was soon increased at the recommendation of Robert E. Lee to include all of the Department of North Carolina and Southern Virginia. In November, with William T. Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea underway, Davis ordered him to the defenses of Augusta, Georgia, and then to Savannah, Georgia, Charleston, South Carolina, and in January 1865, the defenses of Wilmington again. The Confederates successfully repulsed the first Union attempt to capture Fort Fisher, which dominated the seaborne supply line to Wilmington. However, Bragg&#x27;s performance in the Second Battle of Fort Fisher was poor when the Union returned in January. He assumed that the first failed siege meant the fort was invulnerable, but poor communication and planning from the U.S. forces had played a large role. Thus, he did not come to the fort&#x27;s assistance after it was attacked the second time. In February, the Confederates were forced to evacuate Wilmington, their last remaining seaport on the Atlantic coast.

Bragg&#x27;s now-fragile military career began to crumble around him. To his disgust, Joseph E. Johnston returned to service to command the remnants of the Army of Tennessee and other forces defending against Sherman in North Carolina. At about the same time, Bragg lost his position as military adviser to Davis when Robert E. Lee was promoted to be general in chief of all the Confederate armies in February, and John C. Breckinridge, who had hated Bragg since the debacle at Perryville, was named Secretary of War. Davis was sympathetic to Bragg&#x27;s discomfort and discussed transferring him to command the Trans-Mississippi Department, replacing Edmund Kirby Smith, but the politicians from that region were vehemently opposed. Bragg became, in effect, a corps commander (although his command was less than a division in size) under Johnston for the remainder of the Carolinas Campaign. His men were able to win a minor victory at the Second Battle of Kinston, March 7–10, and fought unsuccessfully at the Battle of Bentonville, March 19–21. After the fall of Richmond on April 2, Jefferson Davis and remnants of the Confederate government fled to the southwest. Bragg, who had been headquartered at Raleigh, North Carolina, caught up with Davis near Abbeville, South Carolina, on May 1. He attended the final cabinet meeting and convinced Davis that the cause was lost. Bragg and a small party of his staff rode to the west and were captured and paroled in Monticello, Georgia, on May 9.

==Later life and death==
Bragg and his wife Eliza had lost their home in late 1862 when the United States Army confiscated the plantation in Thibodaux. It briefly served as a shelter, the Bragg Home Colony, for freed people under the control of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. The couple moved in with his brother, a plantation owner in Lowndesboro, Alabama, but they found the life of seclusion there intolerable. In 1867 Bragg became the superintendent of the New Orleans waterworks, but a formerly enslaved African-American man soon replaced him as the Reconstructionists came to power. In late 1869 Jefferson Davis offered Bragg a job as an agent for the Carolina Life Insurance Company. He worked there for four months before becoming dissatisfied with the profession and its low pay. He considered but rejected a position in the Egyptian Army. In August 1871, he was employed by the city of Mobile, Alabama, to improve the river, harbor, and bay, leaving after quarreling with a &quot;combination of capitalists.&quot; Moving to Texas, he was appointed the chief engineer of the Gulf, Colorado and Santa Fe Railway in July 1874. Still, within a year, disagreements with the board of directors over his compensation caused him to resign. He remained in Texas as an inspector of railroads.

On September 27, 1876, at the age of 59, Bragg was walking down a street with a friend in Galveston, Texas, when he suddenly fell over unconscious. Dragged into a drugstore, he was dead within 10 to 15 minutes. A physician familiar with his history believed that he &quot;died by the brain&quot; (or of &quot;paralysis of the brain&quot;), suffering from the degeneration of cerebral blood vessels. An inquest ruled that his death was due to &quot;fatal syncope&quot; possibly induced by organic disease of the heart. He is buried in Magnolia Cemetery, Mobile, Alabama.

== Personal life ==
On his celebratory tour, Bragg visited Evergreen Plantation in Wallace, Louisiana, where he met 23-year-old Eliza Brooks Ellis, known to her friends as Elise, a wealthy sugar heiress. They were married on June 7, 1849, in the drawing room of Magnolia Manor, the Ellis plantation. The newlyweds relocated to Jefferson Barracks, Missouri, on September 10. They were forced to leave this relatively comfortable assignment in October 1853 when they were transferred to Fort Gibson in the Indian Territory (present-day Oklahoma). Eight months later, they were transferred to Fort Washita, near the Texas border. The primitive conditions at these forts were unsuitable for the married couple, and after another six months, Bragg requested leave, and the couple returned to Thibodaux. Bragg traveled to Washington to implore Secretary of War Jefferson Davis to reassign his artillery battery away from frontier duty, but was unsuccessful.

In June 1863, Bragg received religious instruction and was baptized into the Episcopal Church in Shelbyville, Tennessee.

==Historical reputation==
James M. McPherson&#x27;s reference to &quot;the bumblers like Bragg and Pemberton and Hood who lost the West&quot; sums up the judgment of many modern historians. Bragg&#x27;s shortcomings as an army commander included his unimaginative tactics, mostly his reliance on frontal assault (such as the Hornet&#x27;s Nest at Shiloh, Breckinridge&#x27;s assault at Stones River, and numerous instances at Chickamauga), and his lack of post-battle follow-up that turned tactical victories or draws into strategic disappointments (Perryville and Chickamauga). His sour disposition, a penchant for blaming others for defeat, and poor interpersonal skills undoubtedly caused him to be criticized more directly than many of his unsuccessful contemporaries. Peter Cozzens wrote about his relationship with subordinates:

One private, Sam Watkins, who later became a professional writer, said in his memoirs that &quot;None of Bragg&#x27;s men soldiers ever loved him. They had no faith in his ability as a general. He was looked upon as a merciless tyrant ... He loved to crush the spirit of the men.&quot; Historian Ty Seidule says that Bragg&#x27;s battles often ended in defeat because of his insistence on direct frontal assaults and his &quot;uncanny ability to turn minor wins and losses into strategic defeats.&quot;

Some counterarguments have emerged in recent years. Judith Lee Hallock called the blaming of Bragg for Confederate defeats in the west the &quot;Bragg syndrome.&quot; While most agree he was not a particularly good army commander, historians such as Hallock and Steven E. Woodworth cite his skills as an organizer and argue that his defeat in several battles can also be partially blamed upon bad luck and incompetent subordinates, notably Polk. Of his troublesome subordinates, Hardee was considered a solid soldier even by Bragg. Although personally brave and charismatic, Polk was simply an average tactician known for piecemeal attacks and was seriously insubordinate. However, he was a close friend of Davis, who was unwilling to relieve him. Woodworth claims that Bragg also never received the support Davis gave to Robert E. Lee and Sidney Johnston.

Historians Grady McWhiney and Woodworth have stated that, contrary to popular belief, Davis and Bragg were not friends, having bitterly quarreled during the antebellum years. Davis was impressed with Bragg&#x27;s qualifications for high command early in the war but was willing to relieve him by 1863. Judith Hallock noted mutual admiration between Davis and Bragg during his assignment in Richmond, perhaps because Bragg respected the president. Post-Civil War, Bragg&#x27;s relationship with Davis grew stronger. He regularly addressed his letters to Davis as &quot;Your Friend&quot; and worked with Davis in the Carolina Insurance Company.

<doc id="264470" wikidata="Q5058916" url="?curid=264470" title="Censorship in Australia">
<text>Certain subject-matter in Australia is subject to various forms of government censorship. These include matters of national security, judicial non-publication or suppression orders, defamation law, the federal &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot; (Cth), film and literature (including video game) classification, and advertising restrictions.

Some forms of censorship are not administered directly by the government or courts. For example, some foreign websites have on occasion been blocked by Australian internet service providers. More recently, concerns have been raised as to the level of academic freedom enjoyed at Australia&#x27;s public universities. Outside of these matters, standards for television, radio, recorded music, the press and most commercial advertising are enforced, in the first instance, by means of industry self-regulation.

== Legal protections ==
Australia does not have explicit freedom of speech in any constitutional or statutory declaration of rights, with the exception of political speech which is protected from criminal prosecution at common law per &quot;Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth&quot;. There is however an &quot;implied freedom of political communication&quot; that was recognised in &quot;Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation&quot;.

In 1992 the High Court of Australia judged in the case of &quot;Australian Capital Television Pty Ltd v Commonwealth&quot; that the Australian Constitution, by providing for a system of representative and responsible government, implied the protection of political communication as an essential element of that system. This freedom of political communication is not a broad freedom of speech as in other countries, but rather a freedom that only protects political free speech. This freedom of political free speech is a shield against government prosecution, not a shield against private prosecution (civil law). It is also less a causal mechanism in itself, rather than simply a boundary which can be adjudged to be breached. Despite the court&#x27;s ruling, however, not all political speech appears to be protected in Australia and several laws criminalise forms of speech that would be protected in republic countries such as the United States.

In 1996, Albert Langer was imprisoned for advocating that voters fill out their ballot papers in a way that was invalid. Amnesty International declared Langer to be a prisoner of conscience. The section which outlawed Langer from encouraging people to vote this way has since been repealed and the law now says only that it is an offence to print or publish material which may deceive or mislead a voter.

The Howard government expanded sedition law as part of the war on terror. &quot;Media Watch&quot; ran a series on the amendments on ABC television.

In 2003, CSIRO senior scientist Graeme Pearman was reprimanded and encouraged to resign after he spoke out on global warming. The Howard government was accused of limiting the speech of Pearman and other scientists.

In 2010, journalist Andrew Bolt was sued in the Federal Court over two posts on his &quot;Herald Sun&quot; blog in 2009. Bolt was found to have contravened the &quot;Racial Discrimination Act 1975&quot; (RDA) in 2011 following comments regarded to be representative of a &quot;eugenic&quot; approach to aboriginal identity. This prompted the federal government to propose changes to the Racial Discrimination Act but this has been met with stiff resistance.

In 2014 the Supreme Court of Victoria issued a blanket media gag order on the reporting of a high-profile international corruption case. The gag order prevented the publishing of articles regarding bribes presented to high-ranking officials of Malaysia, Indonesia and Vietnam by senior executives of the Reserve Bank of Australia in order to secure the adoption of the Australian invented and produced polymer banknote technology.

==Australian Classification Board==

Certain films, books and video games have, in effect, been banned from sale in Australia because they have been “refused classification” by the Australian Classification Board which was founded in 1970. Materials are generally refused classification because of explicit violent or sexual content.

Although the Australian Classification Board Guidelines state that &quot;adults should be able to read, hear and see what they want&quot;, many books are apparently banned or given a restricted classification simply because they may offend certain segments of the population. Under particularly frequent attacks are books containing erotica, those concerning illegal drugs, and those discussing end-of-life issues (particularly those discussing or condoning assisted suicide). For example, in December 2006 the voluntary euthanasia book &quot;The Peaceful Pill Handbook&quot; was classified by the OFLC as X18+ and approved for publication. A month later, on appeal from the Australian Attorney General Philip Ruddock and Right to Life NSW, the book&#x27;s classification was reviewed by the Literature Classification Board and rated RC (refused classification).

In 2000, Liberal Party of Australia Prime Minister John Howard had the Australian Classification Board prohibit depictions of certain sexual fetishes including candle wax, bondage, spanking, fisting, and golden showers. Sexually explicit depictions of adults who appeared to look under 18 years of age were also prohibited by the Board. The Australian Sex Party accused these actions of censoring depictions of female ejaculation and censoring adult women with small breasts.

== Banned publications ==
===Imports===
In Australia, the importation of certain books, video games, and media are prohibited based on its non-fictional or fictional contents. It was reported on in 2021, that the Australian Border Force stated that any depictions of sex, drug misuse or addiction, crime cruelty, violence, terrorist acts, or revolting content that offends moral standards and decency, are prohibited. 

===Book censorship until 1970===
Book censorship has existed in Australia since the 19th century. Each state had its own legislation, including:
*&quot;Obscene and Indecent Publications Act 1901&quot; (later &quot;Indecent Articles and Publications Act 1975&quot;)
*&quot;Police Offences Act 1958 &quot; (Victoria)
*&quot;Indecent Publications and Articles Act 1902-1983&quot; (Western Australia)

Norman Lindsay&#x27;s &quot;Redheap&quot; was the first book to be banned from import into Australia, in May 1930, under the Commonwealth &quot;Customs Act 1901&quot;. This was before the establishment of the Commonwealth Book Censorship Board in 1933 by Prime Minister Joseph Lyons&#x27; United Australia Party, which was renamed the Literature Censorship Board in 1937. The novel &quot;Upsurge&quot;, written by J. M. Harcourt and published in 1934, became the first Australian book to be officially banned under the guidelines of the Commonwealth Book Censorship Board It was initially banned as seditious, later reviewed and the ban confirmed, ostensibly on grounds of indecency and explicit depictions of sex under the Indecent Publications Act. However the main cause of its ban was its socialist tone and subversive agenda which criticised capitalism, featuring Communist characters in its portrayal of life in the relief camps of the Depression.

In the 1960s, censorship laws came under pressure when &quot;three intrepid Sydney activists,&quot; Alexander William Sheppard, Leon Fink and Ken Buckley, locally published D. H. Lawrence&#x27;s &quot;The Trial of Lady Chatterley&quot; (Sydney, 1965), which was at that time banned in Australia, and Sheppard then published James Baldwin&#x27;s &quot;Another Country&quot; (1966). In 1970, Penguin Books had three copies of &quot;Portnoy&#x27;s Complaint&quot; smuggled into Australia and then secretly printed 75,000 copies of the book. In the early 1970s Don Chipp, the federal Minister of Customs and Excise, largely ended censorship of printed material in the country, with Australians being able to read such books as &quot;Portnoy’s Complaint&quot; and Henry Miller&#x27;s &quot;Tropic of Cancer&quot;.

== Press freedom ==
Freedom House reported in 2021 that although Australia&#x27;s &quot;constitution does not explicitly protect press freedom, journalists scrutinise lawmakers and the government, covering controversial topics generally without serious obstacles or risk of harassment or violence.&quot; However, it expressed concern about two police raids conducted in 2019, and the widespread use of judicial suppression orders. Press freedom may also be affected by the provisions of defamation law and the Commonwealth RDA, which are discussed in the following sections.

Australia has been on a decline on the Press Freedom Index curated by the Reporters Without Borders, in reflection of rising media censorship and intimidation of journalists in the country, including media companies maintaining close ties to political leaders, fueling doubts about editorial independence. Two giant firms dominate mass media in Australia – Nine Entertainment and News Corp Australia, a subsidiary of American-based News Corp. The country was ranked 19th out of 180 countries in 2018, before subsequently dropping to 26th out of 180 countries for 2020 and 39th in 2022. 

=== National security ===
The Australian Government has occasionally acted against media outlets for reasons of national security. In June 2019, federal police raided the Sydney offices of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation and the home of &quot;Sunday Telegraph&quot; political editor Annika Smethurst, seeking evidence against officials who may have leaked sensitive government information to journalists. Both raids were widely condemned in media and legal circles, and led to a review.

=== Suppression and non-publication orders ===
Commonwealth, State and territory law provides for the suppression or non-publication of certain information regarding legal proceedings. This can be to avoid contaminating the jury pool, or to protect the identities of children and sexual assault victims. While these orders are generally targeted at journalists, in the past the transmission of television crime dramas has been delayed as a result.

The case of Cardinal George Pell is one cited by Freedom House. The conviction of one of the Vatican&#x27;s most senior officials made headlines around the world, yet a suppression order banned all Australian media outlets from reporting the story. The order was intended to avoid the verdict influencing a future trial involving separate charges (these were later dropped). Australians could, however, readily find the news on foreign websites. Melbourne&#x27;s &quot;Herald Sun&quot; newspaper posted on its front page &quot;CENSORED&quot; in large print in protest of the ban, noting that international sources were reporting on a &quot;very important story that is relevant to Victorians&quot;. Victorian authorities later charged 36 individual journalists and news organisations with breaching suppression orders related to the verdict.

== Defamation ==

Australian law of defamation developed primarily out of the English law of defamation and its cases, though now there are differences introduced by statute and by the implied constitutional limitation on governmental powers to limit speech of a political nature established in &quot;Lange v Australian Broadcasting Corporation (1997)&quot;.

On 10 December 2002, the High Court of Australia delivered judgment in the Internet defamation case of &quot;Dow Jones v Gutnick&quot;. The judgment established that internet-published foreign publications that defamed an Australian in their Australian reputation could be held accountable under Australian defamation law. The case gained worldwide attention and is often said, inaccurately, to be the first of its kind. A similar case that predates &quot;Dow Jones v Gutnick&quot; is &quot;Berezovsky v Forbes&quot; in England.

Among the various common law jurisdictions, some Americans have presented a visceral and vocal reaction to the &quot;Gutnick&quot; decision. On the other hand, the decision mirrors similar decisions in many other jurisdictions such as England, Scotland, France, Canada and Italy.

In 2006, uniform defamation laws came into effect across Australia. In addition to fixing the problematic inconsistencies in law between individual States and Territories, the laws made a number of changes to the common law position, including:

* Abolishing the distinction between libel and slander.
* Providing new defenses including that of triviality, where it is a defense to the publication of a defamatory matter if the defendant proves that the circumstances of publication were such that the plaintiff was unlikely to sustain any harm.
* The defenses against defamation may be negated if there is proof the publication was actuated by malice.
* Greatly restricting the right of corporations to sue for defamation (see e.g. &quot;Defamation Act 2005&quot; (Vic), s 9). Corporations may, however, still sue for the tort of injurious falsehood, where the burden of proof is greater than in defamation, because the plaintiff must show that the defamation was made with malice and resulted in economic loss.

The 2006 reforms also established across all Australian states the availability of truth as an unqualified defense; previously a number of states only allowed a defense of truth with the condition that a public interest or benefit existed. The defendant however still needs to prove that the defamatory imputations are substantially true.

== Racial Discrimination Act ==
== Advertising bans ==
Commonwealth and State governments ban or restrict certain types of advertising in order to maintain the integrity of elections, personal injury law and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.

=== Personal injury lawyers ===
Lawyers in most Australian states are censored in respect of public statements they are allowed to publish concerning personal injury compensation law. Non-lawyers are also prohibited from publishing statements on the subject in some states. The laws are described as a ban on advertising of personal injury compensation but go much further.

The censorship must be self-administered, and breaches render a lawyer liable to prosecution, disbarment and, potentially, even jail. These laws coincided with the Insurance Crisis, the Ipp report and Civil Liability laws.

In New South Wales all lawyer public statements concerning personal injury compensation are prohibited.

====Queensland====
In Queensland television and radio advertising is banned and lawyer statements concerning personal injury compensation law must be censored so as to contain only:

* The lawyer&#x27;s name, contact details and area of speciality (print and other &quot;allowed publications&quot; only);
* The operation of the law of negligence and a person&#x27;s rights under that law (lawyers&#x27; websites only);
* The lawyer&#x27;s terms of service (lawyers&#x27; websites only).

The Queensland censorship provisions were originally intended to ban distasteful advertisements by some personal injury law firms that promoted &quot;cash for injuries&quot;. The Queensland Attorney-General stated in his Second Reading speech when introducing the legislation in 2002 as follows:
The bill also better regulates provocative advertising by lawyers in relation to personal injury services ... the sort of advertising currently broadcast on radio and television does not enhance clients&#x27; rights or portray the profession in a particularly positive light.

Section 4 (2) (f) of the Queensland Act refers to &quot;&quot;regulating inappropriate advertising&quot;...&quot;

However the Queensland government has since given the censorship provisions the strictest possible interpretation and threatened hundreds of lawyers with prosecution.

One of the many outcomes that impact on freedom of expression and free speech is that concerning lawyers&#x27; web sites. A lawyer must not even list &quot;personal injury&quot; even merely as a link on a webpage that has no relation to the prohibited subject matter.

In practice, lawyers are prohibited from listing even on their website homepage some of the areas of law they practise in. Photos, images, slogans are prohibited. All references to personal injury compensation law must be censored out of website staff profiles containing anything more than the person&#x27;s name, contact details and area of expertise.

Some other subject matter that must be censored out of web sites and other publications includes: winning verdicts and settlements; mention of the law firms reputation, expertise and history; testimonials; case histories; the standard of service and many other things that would allow consumers to differentiate among competitors.

The Queensland censorship provisions have not yet been judicially interpreted. It is unknown whether the ultra-strict interpretation contended for by the Queensland government will be upheld by a court.

====New South Wales====
In New South Wales, all statements by lawyers concerning personal injury compensation including on websites are banned and strict penalties apply. One lawyer has already been professionally punished and fined $20,000 for making a website statement.

The New South Wales version of the censorship law which is stricter than that of Queensland was considered by the High Court of Australia in 2005. The plaintiffs argued that the law was invalid because it infringed the implied constitutional freedom of political communication and secondly that it infringed Chapter III of the Constitution and the rule of law.

In a majority decision the court held that the New South Wales censorship law was valid. It did not accept that statements merely about personal injury compensation law were of a political nature. It implied however that any statements criticising the censorship itself and tort &quot;reform&quot; would be in the nature of political communication that was protected. The majority also ruled against the plaintiffs on the second argument (but the minority were strongly of the view) that the law unreasonably interfered with lawyers going about their constitutionally protected vocation.

On 20 June 2008, Justice Adams of the Supreme Court of NSW held that clause 34 of the Legal Profession Regulation 2005 which bans personal injury advertising in NSW by non-lawyers, was void because it was Ultra Vires the Legal Profession Act 2004.

====Victoria====
No censorship applies in Victoria.

====Western Australia====
The Western Australian censorship rules are similar to those in Queensland. However, television advertising is permitted by ACMA.

====Consumer opposition====
The Australian Lawyers Alliance opposes the censorship and believes that &quot;content-rich statements&quot; concerning the availability of all legal services are in the public interest.

Consumer groups (e.g. Tort Reform Institute, Insurance Reform) argue that any restriction on lawyer communication is adverse to the public interest. They argue that the public should be fully informed about their rights particularly under consumer protection laws that generate compensation payments, and that censorship that keeps the public under-informed cannot be justified. In their view, the protection of insurance company profits is not a sufficient &quot;public purpose&quot; to warrant the interference in personal freedoms by way of censorship. The ultimate aim of the government and insurers, according to such consumer groups, is to eliminate the expression &quot;personal injury compensation&quot; from the Australian vocabulary and to dissuade citizens from exercising compensation rights by making it &quot;distasteful&quot; to do so.

Exceptions to the censorship provision apply to:

*Insurance companies, who are permitted to advertise that personal injury claims can be made directly with them; or
*Statements concerning the defence of personal injury claims as opposed to the pursuit of those claims (except in New South Wales)

== Internet censorship ==
Some activists consider Australia&#x27;s laws on Internet censorship to be amongst the most restrictive in the western world. However, the restrictive nature of the laws has been combined with almost complete lack of interest in enforcement from the agencies responsible.

Some of the interesting exceptions include an attempt by then NSW Police Minister Michael Costa to shut down Melbourne Indymedia, a case in 2001 involving the US Secret Service that was eventually pleaded out, and an attempt by the FBI using the Australian Federal Police to censor a Victorian they alleged was posting threats to the US.

A collection of both federal and state laws apply, but the most important is the federal legislation which came into effect on 1 January 2000.

If a complaint is issued about material on the Internet, the ACMA is empowered to examine the material under the guidelines for film and video. If it is found that a) the material would be classified X18+, or b) the material would classified R18+ and the site does not have an adult verification system, or c) the material would be refused classification:

* If the site is hosted in Australia, the ACMA is empowered to issue a &quot;takedown notice&quot; under which the material must be removed from the site.
* If the site is hosted outside Australia, the site is added to a list of banned sites.

This list of banned sites is then added to filtering software, which must be offered to all consumers by Internet Service Providers and the Australian Government.

On 31 December 2007 the Telecommunications Minister of the newly elected Labor government, Stephen Conroy, announced that Australia would introduce mandatory internet filtering. Once more the reason given is that mandatory filtering is required to &quot;provide greater protection to children from online pornography and violent websites&quot;.

As of November 2008, the plan includes two blacklists, one of which will filter illegal content according to internet content laws as well as other &quot;unwanted&quot; content, and the other will also filter content unsuitable for children. Internet users will be able to opt out of the secondary blacklist for children, but will not be able to opt out of the primary filter, sparking free speech concerns. No statement has been made about what content will be considered &quot;illegal&quot;, or what Stephen Conroy means by &quot;unwanted&quot;.

Slated for blocking, should the &quot;Clean Feed&quot; Act be passed by Australia&#x27;s Federal Parliament, is the website of Dr Philip Nitschke&#x27;s banned book, &quot;The Peaceful Pill Handbook&quot;. The inclusion of Nitschke&#x27;s euthanasia book&#x27;s website came to light after the Government&#x27;s list of would-be banned websites was leaked to wikileaks.org. &quot;The Peaceful Pill Handbook&quot; was listed on the leaked internet website blacklist, wedged in alphabetical order between the porn sites panty-ass.com and pickyourperversion.com.

This produced a huge backlash from the community, including the Get Up advertisement Censordyne. Conroy eventually abandoned the proposal, saying that the relevant authority was already invested in ACMA, which didn&#x27;t take any action in accordance.

Since the election of the Coalition government in 2013, there has been one act passed, that allows the blocking of websites that host pirated content, if the content provider has contacted the Australian government about it and they&#x27;ve gone through the procedures set out through the act, then the website will be blocked under s.115a of the &quot;Copyright Amendment (Online Infringement) Bill 2015.&quot;

There has been two applications to Section.115a, one by Foxtel and another by Village Roadshow, which would prohibit an Australian pirate site from functioning and block The Pirate Bay respectively. The Federal Court has recently ruled that ISP&#x27;s must block a range of Torrent sites including The Pirate Bay using either DNS Hijacking, URL blocking or some other mutually agreed method by ISPs and rights holders.

There are some reports said Australia has also been collaborating with Chinese Great Firewall security officials and other officials from Cyberspace Administration of China in implementing its data retention and filtering infrastructure and possibly obtained surveillance technology from China.

On 20 March 2019 Australian telecom company Telstra denied access to millions of Australians to the websites 4chan, 8chan, Zero Hedge, Voat, Archive.today, and Liveleak as a reaction to the Christchurch mosque shootings.

== Non-government forms of censorship ==
=== Universities ===

Concerns have been expressed by Freedom House and others about protections for freedom of speech and academic freedom at Australia&#x27;s universities. In 2018, the Australian Government asked former Chief Justice Robert French to conduct an independent review of freedom of speech and academic freedom in Australian higher education. While French disagreed that there was a &quot;freedom of speech crisis&quot; on campuses, he nonetheless noted the risks to freedom posed by the various and vaguely-worded protections then in place. Concerns include the influence of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on university administrations; &#x27;deplatforming&#x27; of controversial speakers and viewpoints; and demands that academics refrain from contesting one another&#x27;s conclusions.

==== Deplatforming ====
Many Australian university campuses have seen protests by students and faculty against unorthodox or controversial viewpoints. Several universities refused to host Copenhagen Consensus or Ramsay research centres following left-wing protests.

==== Internal criticism ====
Another threat is action by universities to silence internal criticism. In 2016, James Cook University sacked marine scientist Peter Ridd for publishing an article questioning the reproducibility of his colleagues&#x27; work on the Great Barrier Reef. The Federal Court later ruled the University had acted unlawfully, awarding Ridd more than $1 million in damages.

=== Advertising boycotts ===
Campaigners including the anonymous American group Sleeping Giants have attempted to force certain conservative and libertarian commentators off Australian radio and television by threatening to boycott broadcasters&#x27; advertisers. Targets of this approach have included both hosts, such as radio presenter Alan Jones and former Northern Territory Chief Minister Adam Giles, and guests, such as former senator David Leyonhjelm.

=== Advertising standards ===
Standards for commercial advertising in Australia are enforced via industry self-regulation.

<doc id="264477" wikidata="Q318531" url="?curid=264477" title="Westfalia">
<text>Westfalia is the designation of various specially converted Volkswagen camper vans. Westfalia is named after the company, Westfalia-Werke, the contractor that built the vans, headquartered in the town of Rheda-Wiedenbrück, located in the Westphalia region of Germany.

==Products==
Westfalia-Werke also converted non-Volkswagen vans and produced camping trailers and other products, but they were best known for their Volkswagen camper conversions. Westfalia began converting Volkswagen buses in 1951. Their famous &quot;pop-top&quot; package was added later and became very popular on the second-generation VW Bus from 1968 to 1979, and its successor the Vanagon (also calle &quot;Westy&quot; and &quot;Campmobile&quot;), the Sven Hedin and Florida conversions on the Volkswagen LT, and then the T4 EuroVan, which was discontinued in 2003. This design also inspired many imitators, with dozens of other companies worldwide offering pop-top van conversions. Therefore, not all pop-top Volkswagens are Westfalia conversions, although in the United States, the Westfalia conversion was by far the most common. Conversely, not all Volkswagen Westfalia conversions had pop-tops or cooking facilities. Volkswagen offered a &quot;Weekender&quot; package in the 1970s with a Westfalia interior, but no pop-top. Later, some Vanagon conversions were offered with a pop-top and interior table, but lacked cooking facilities and instead included a luggable 12-volt refrigerator.

In 1999, DaimlerChrysler purchased a 49% stake in Westfalia-Werke&#x27;s van conversion division, and in 2001 absorbed the remaining 51%. Of course, since DaimlerChrysler is a Volkswagen competitor, this spelled the end of the Volkswagen-Westfalia partnership. Volkswagen still offers pop-top camper conversions in Europe, which are made in-house since 2005. Vans leave the Transporter/Multivan assembly line and are moved to a dedicated facility to be converted into Californias, in Ocean, Coast, or Beach versions. Meanwhile, Westfalia now makes Mercedes Marco Polo pop-top vans, as well as larger Sprinter high-roof — factory camper conversions for Mercedes vans, distributed in the United States by Airstream and badged as Dodge Sprinters. They also provide automotive accessories to BMW, including trailer hitches.

In 2008, a management buyout occurred and Westfalia Van Conversion is now an independent entity. It still converts some vehicles for major car manufacturers to sell through their own networks, such as the Ford Nugget, but also markets conversions through its own network of recreational vehicle dealers. These models include the Ford-based Big Nugget, Volkswagen Crafter-based Sven Hedin, and the Michelangelo. The Michelangelo vehicle uses a Fiat Scudo chassis and is designed to be a major competitor to the Volkswagen California. Westfalia has recently returned to making their own conversions of Volkswagen Transporter vans, in direct competition with the Volkswagen California.

On 28 January 2010, Westfalia-Werke filed for bankruptcy, citing a 40 percent drop in sales. According to the filing, they would like to keep doing business while they restructure. Westfalia was acquired by the Rapido group in 2011.

<text>Kensington Gore is the name of a U-shaped thoroughfare on the south side of Hyde Park in the City of Westminster, England. The streets connect the Royal Albert Hall with the Royal College of Art, the Royal Geographical Society, and in Kensington Gardens the Albert Memorial. The area is named after the Gore estate which occupied the site until it was developed by Victorian planners in the mid 19th century. A &quot;gore&quot; is a narrow, triangular piece of land.
 The street replaces part of Kensington Road, connecting what would otherwise be two separate streets.

== History ==
Gore House was the residence of political reformer William Wilberforce between 1808 and 1821. The three-acre (12,000 m2) estate was subsequently occupied by the Countess of Blessington and the Count D&#x27;Orsay from 1836 to 1849. 

In May 1851, the house opened as a restaurant by the chef Alexis Soyer, who planned to cater for the 1851 Great Exhibition in Hyde Park. After the exhibition and on the advice of Prince Albert, Gore House and its grounds were bought by the Exhibition&#x27;s Royal Commission to create the cultural quarter known as Albertopolis. In 1871, the Royal Albert Hall was completed on the site of the former house. It was opened by Queen Victoria in 1892, The Gore Hotel was opened by sisters Miss Ada and Ms Cooke, who it hasbeen said were descendants of Captain James Cook. However, they cannot have been as none of Captain Cook&#x27;s children had any children of trheir own. The 50-bedroom luxury hotel has featured in many music videos and photo shoots, such as for &quot;Beggars Banquet&quot; by The Rolling Stones.

The streets are bounded to the north by Kensington Road (the A315). The nearest tube station is South Kensington to the south.

<doc id="264498" wikidata="Q848584" url="?curid=264498" title="Heaven or Las Vegas">
<text>Heaven or Las Vegas is the sixth studio album by Scottish alternative rock band Cocteau Twins. It was released on 17 September 1990 by 4AD. It is the band&#x27;s second major-label release in the US, following &quot;Blue Bell Knoll&quot; in 1988.

&quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart and number 99 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, becoming the band&#x27;s most commercially successful release. It eventually sold 235,000 copies by 1996, according to &quot;Billboard&quot;. The album was included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and was voted number 218 in the third edition of Colin Larkin&#x27;s &quot;All Time Top 1000 Albums&quot;. In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed it at No. 245 in its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

The album was voted 18th of &quot;Scotland’s 100 Best Rock and Pop Albums&quot; in 2003 and was the focus of a BBC Scotland programme, &quot;Classic Scottish Albums&quot; in 2007. Despite 4AD president Ivo Watts-Russell proclaiming it one of the best-ever releases on his label, he released the group from their contract at the end of 1990 because his relationship with the band had soured.

==Background and development==
Cocteau Twins released their fifth album, &quot;Blue Bell Knoll&quot;, in 1988. Despite signing a major label deal with Capitol Records, the band declined to promote it extensively but nevertheless shot a video for &quot;Carolyn&#x27;s Fingers&quot; which was issued as a single only in the US. The album was not supported by a tour. The band brought on a manager for the first time as they had run into tax trouble previously. Watts-Russell, 4AD president at the time, reportedly &quot;didn&#x27;t care&quot; for the new manager and his relationship with the band began to sour.

The band took on new familial responsibilities as bassist Simon Raymonde married his first wife, Karen, and vocalist Elizabeth Fraser was expecting her first child with guitarist and co-founder Robin Guthrie. The latter&#x27;s cocaine habit previously &quot;escalated&quot; during the recording process for &quot;Blue Bell Knoll&quot;; Fraser and Raymonde believed that the new baby would prove a diversion from Guthrie&#x27;s dependency and allow the pair to &quot;play happy families.&quot; Their wishes did not pan out, with Guthrie relying heavily on drugs as the band developed &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas,&quot; causing him to experience &quot;deep&quot; paranoia and mood swings. His relationship with Fraser grew increasingly strained as a result.

In September 1989, Fraser and Guthrie&#x27;s child, Lucy Belle was born; &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; was released on her first birthday. Of her pregnancy, Fraser said that she gained clarity about what mattered to her most: &quot;Suddenly I had confidence which I&#x27;d never ever had in my life, which I consequently lost after I had the baby, because it&#x27;s such a frightening experience you lose it again and you have to start over again. But it does change you.&quot; Raymonde&#x27;s father, Ivor Raymonde, died shortly after Lucy Belle&#x27;s birth, as the band were in the middle of recording. He recounted: &quot;I was only 27, I was still quite young and he was a very influential guy for me so that was a big blow but, looking back on it, having a major life event happening probably helped the record have that edge to it.&quot;

== Recording and composition ==
&quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; displays musical evolution, with the music becoming more accessible. Fraser&#x27;s lyrics were more intelligible; many concerned her newborn child Lucy Belle, particularly &quot;Pitch the Baby&quot;, which is about her experience in giving birth and welcoming a child. Despite most of Fraser&#x27;s lyrics &quot;[emerging] in alien tongues&quot;, which she sums up as &quot;laziness&quot; and &quot;bad diction&quot;, she attributed the album&#x27;s more identifiable words to Lucy Belle&#x27;s influence.There was salvation in [Fraser&#x27;s vocals and lyrics] too, in terms of helping save her relationship with [Guthrie], the joy of bringing a baby into the world that they could love. It did give them a new lease of life, and it gave the album an energy and vibrancy. It was very easy to make the music.Raymonde wrote &quot;Frou-Frou Foxes in Midsummer Fires&quot; the day after his father&#x27;s death, and &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; straddled the two themes: &quot;writing songs about birth, and also death, gave the record a darker side that I hear in songs like &#x27;Cherry-Coloured Funk&#x27; and &#x27;Fotzepolitic&#x27;&quot;. Despite being in a &quot;very good space musically&quot; and describing the recording process as an &quot;inspirational time&quot;, Raymonde said: &quot;It was trying to mask all the other shit that was going on that we didn&#x27;t want to stop and think about for too long&quot;. In a retrospective of 4AD by music journalist Martin Aston, he noted that Fraser named the album &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; as &quot;a suggestion of truth versus artifice, of music versus commerce, or perhaps a gamble, one last throw of the dice&quot;.

The album&#x27;s drum programming was done by Guthrie, the first step in every Cocteau Twins recording session. Guthrie and Raymonde constructed the music before Fraser recorded her vocals. Raymonde likened Guthrie&#x27;s rhythms on the album to hip hop beats–despite their music being far removed from it, he acknowledged that it came from a &quot;dance-y&quot; place. Much of &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot;&#x27; &quot;mysterious&quot; instrumental effects were achieved by accident, with guitars as opposed to &quot;omnipresent&quot; synthesizers. As a result of Guthrie&#x27;s decreased time in the studio, Raymonde&#x27;s playing was more prominent and he became more involved in the recording process. Raymonde recounted that he would record Fraser&#x27;s vocals alone for days at a time, during which he first &quot;fully appreciated how amazing she was&quot;: &quot;She&#x27;d come into the control room and say, &#x27;What was that like?&#x27; and I&#x27;d scrape the tears away and say, &#x27;That was alright, Liz&#x27;. She didn&#x27;t get off on praise. If I said. &#x27;That was fucking amazing&#x27;, she&#x27;d say &#x27;I thought it was shit.&#x27; I learnt not to be too effusive, which was difficult because I was so blown away with what I was hearing.&quot;

&quot;We&#x27;ve had it in the back of our mind that we wanted to play live again&quot;, said Guthrie at the time of the album&#x27;s release, &quot;so we thought we&#x27;d make some of the pieces more like songs we could actually play live [...] We like it better than all our last records. That&#x27;s why we continue to make more–because if we made the perfect record we&#x27;d sit back and say, &#x27;We can&#x27;t do any better than that&#x27;. We think all our other ones are fucking crap. I&#x27;m slightly proud of a couple of tracks on a couple of them, but essentially I&#x27;m really embarrassed about what we&#x27;ve done in the past&quot;.

==Artwork and release==
The band wanted a visual representation that would capture &quot;the ethereal&quot;, according to Guthrie. Paul West, of the design studio Form, previously worked with Cocteau Twins on the cover for &quot;Blue Bell Knoll&quot;. West recruited photographer Andy Rumball, and the pair experimented with various materials to generate a &quot;textural and otherworldly&quot; effect. The final artwork is a long exposure of Christmas tree lights against a colour backdrop, with its typography produced by hand on an acetate overlay. Much of the original artwork was later destroyed in a flood.

&quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; was released on 17 September 1990 by 4AD in the United Kingdom, and in conjunction with Capitol Records in the United States. 4AD later reacquired American distribution rights for much of its back catalogue, resulting in a 2003 reissue solely on 4AD, which was remastered by Guthrie. A vinyl edition of the reissue was released in July 2014, which was repressed on 180g in 2020, remastered from high definition audio files.

The album was voted &quot;Album of the Week&quot; by German radio broadcaster Südwestrundfunk, and in France by radio broadcasters RMC and Radio Nantes.

==Critical reception and legacy==
The album has received critical acclaim. &quot;&quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; is their finest hour yet,&quot; enthused Martin Aston in &quot;Q&quot;. &quot;Ten exquisite moments that make Kate Bush – their only possible comparison – sound as airborne as Motörhead&quot;. The album subsequently featured in the magazine&#x27;s &quot;best of the year&quot; roundup: &quot;It&#x27;s wonderfully comforting how the Cocteaus continue on their inimitable course, blissfully regardless of what&#x27;s going on in the world outside their surreal reality&quot;.

Andrew Perry of &quot;Select&quot; wrote that, &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; is the Cocteau Twins in their &quot;usual, spectacular and enigmatic context&quot;. &quot;Vox&quot;″s Roger Morton wrote, &quot;In times when every other pop group is dragging on board whatever chemicals, &#x27;60s techniques and hypno-rhythms they can grab in order to achieve the desirable blissed-out condition. It&#x27;s a good joke that the Cocteaus can get there with such apparent effortlessness&quot;.

&quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; was listed as the 90th best album of the 1990s by &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, who complimented Fraser&#x27;s more direct vocals and the album&#x27;s complex songwriting. It was also included in the 2008 edition of &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;, and in &quot;The Guardian&quot;&#x27;s online edition of a similar list. It was considered the band&#x27;s strongest work since &quot;Treasure&quot; by AllMusic reviewer Ned Raggett, who called it &quot;simply fantastic&quot; and successful in creating &quot;more accessibility&quot;.

&quot;NME&quot; named &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; the 28th best album of 1990. Retrospectively, &quot;The Observer&quot; listed the album as the 97th-greatest British album ever made. In 2017, NPR listed &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; 138th of the 150 Greatest Albums Made By Women. In 2018, &quot;Pitchfork&quot; ranked it first on its list of the 30 best dream pop albums. According to another article in &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, the song &quot;Love... Thy Will Be Done&quot; by Martika &quot;almost certainly&quot; contains a sample of &quot;Fifty-Fifty Clown&quot;.

In 2020, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; listed the album 245th on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time. In 2024, &quot;Paste&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Heaven or Las Vegas&quot; number 43 on its list of the 300 greatest albums of all time, and number one on their Top 25 Dream Pop Albums of All Time list.

<text>Vicia faba, commonly known as the broad bean, fava bean, or faba bean, is a species of vetch, a flowering plant in the pea and bean family Fabaceae. It is widely cultivated as a crop for human consumption, and also as a cover crop. Varieties with smaller, harder seeds that are fed to horses or other animals are called field bean, tic bean or tick bean. This legume is very common in Southern European, Northern European, East Asian, Latin American and North African cuisines.

Some people suffer from favism, a hemolytic response to the consumption of broad beans, a condition linked to a metabolic disorder known as G6PDD. Otherwise the beans, with the outer seed coat removed, can be eaten raw or cooked. With young seed pods, the outer seed coat can be eaten, and in very young pods, the entire seed pod can be eaten.

==Description==
&quot;Vicia faba&quot; is a stiffly erect, annual plant tall, with two to four stems that are square in cross-section. The leaves are long, pinnate with 2–7 leaflets, and glaucous (grey-green). Unlike most other vetches, the leaves do not have tendrils for climbing over other vegetation.

The flowers are long with five petals; the standard petals are white, the wing petals are white with a black spot (true black, not deep purple or blue as is the case in many &quot;black&quot; markings) and the keel petals are white. Crimson-flowered broad beans also exist, which were recently saved from extinction. The flowers have a strong sweet scent which is attractive to bees and other pollinators.

The fruit is a broad, leathery pod that is green, but matures to a dark blackish-brown, with a densely downy surface; the wild species has pods that are long and 1 cm diameter, but many modern cultivars developed for food use have pods long and 2–3 cm thick. Each bean pod contains 3–8 seeds. They are round to oval and have a 5–10 mm diameter in the wild plant, but are usually flattened and up to 20–25 mm long, 15 mm broad and 5–10 mm thick in food cultivars. &quot;V. faba&quot; has a diploid (2n) chromosome number of 12 (six homologous pairs). Five pairs are acrocentric chromosomes and one pair is metacentric.

=== Genome ===
The diploid genome of &quot;Vicia faba&quot; contains 13 GB of DNA, mostly obtained through amplification of retrotransposons and satellite repeats. The genome is one of the largest diploid field crops and contains a predicted 34,221 protein-coding genes.

==Cultivation==
Broad beans have a long tradition of cultivation in Old World agriculture, being among the most ancient plants in cultivation and also among the easiest to grow. While their wild ancestor has not been identified and their origin is unknown, charred legumes of a possible wild-type progenitor have been identified at the Natufian site of the el-Wad Terrace. Carbonised domestic faba bean remains were discovered at three adjacent Neolithic sites in Israel&#x27;s Lower Galilee (Yiftah&#x27;el, Ahi&#x27;hud and Nahal Zippori). Based on the radiocarbon dating of these remains, scientists now believe that the domestication of the crop may have begun as early as 8,250 BCE.

Broad beans are still often grown as a cover crop to prevent erosion because they can overwinter and, as a legume, they fix nitrogen in the soil. The broad bean has high plant hardiness; it can withstand harsh and cold climates. Unlike most legumes, the broad bean can be grown in soils with high salinity, as well as in clay soil. However, it prefers rich loams.

In much of the English-speaking world, the name &quot;broad bean&quot; is used for the large-seeded cultivars grown for human food, while &quot;horse bean&quot; and &quot;field bean&quot; refer to cultivars with smaller, harder seeds that are more like the wild species and used for animal feed, though their stronger flavour is preferred in some human food recipes, such as falafel. The name &quot;broad bean&quot; is the most common name in Commonwealth countries like the UK, Canada, Australia and New Zealand, while the term &quot;fava bean&quot; (from for the bean) is used in the United States.

==Pests and diseases ==
Many diseases appear at a higher rate in higher humidity. Therefore, cultivars being bred for higher density should be evaluated for disease problems. This can be mitigated by west–east rows for more sun drying effect.

Disease tolerance is an important part of breeding &quot;V. faba&quot;.

If transplanted instead of direct seeded there is a lower risk of some diseases including &quot;Botrytis fabae&quot;.

===Parasites===
In mainland Europe and North Africa, the plant parasite &quot;Orobanche crenata&quot; (carnation-scented broomrape) can cause severe impacts on fields of broad beans, devastating their yields.

===Fungal diseases===
====&quot;Botrytis fabae&quot;====
&quot;Vicia faba&quot; is attacked by &quot;Botrytis fabae&quot;, the chocolate spot fungus, which can have a severe impact on yield. It is one of the worst diseases in 
broad beans, as it results in foliar damage, reduced photosynthesis, and reduced bean productivity. The fungus switches from non-aggressive growth to aggressive pathogenicity under the combination of increased temperature and humidity, which is worsened by low soil potassium and phosphorus content and by the higher humidity caused by higher seeding rates. The non-aggressive phase is marked by small red-brown leaf lesions, and sometimes the same on stems and pods. Treatment is less effective than prevention. Early planting avoids the problematic combination of high temperature and humidity in late spring into early summer. Decreasing seeding rate or thinning after emergence is also effective. Foliar fungicide is effective. If broad beans flower during the height of summer temperatures there is an increased risk of this disease. If transplanted instead of direct seeded there is a lower risk of &quot;Botrytis fabae&quot; outbreaks.

====&quot;Erysiphe cichoracearum&quot;====
&quot;Erysiphe cichoracearum&quot; overwinters on residue and has alternate hosts. Resistant cultivars and overhead irrigation are preventative. Sulfur fungicides are recommended in severe outbreak.

====&quot;Fusarium solani&quot;====
This soil borne pathogen is mitigated by lower temperature, aeration, drainage, and sufficient nutrition. Symptoms include stunting, yellowing, necrotic basal leaves, and brown or red or black streak-shaped root lesions that grow together and may show above the soil as the disease progresses.

====&quot;Uromyces viciae-fabae&quot; var. &quot;viciae-fabae&quot;====
Faba bean rust is a fungal pathogen commonly affecting broad bean plants at maturity, causing small orange dots with yellow halos on the leaves, which may merge to form an orange lawn on both leaf surfaces.

====&quot;Sclerotinia&quot; stem rot====
Both &quot;Sclerotinia sclerotiorum&quot; and &quot;S. trifoliorum&quot; are pathogens of interest. Lithourgidis et al. have done extensive work over the years, including in 2007 for &quot;S. t.&quot;, 2005 for &quot;S. s.&quot;, and 1989 regarding procedures for field testing with &quot;S. s.&quot;

===Bacterial diseases===
====&quot;Xanthomonas campestris&quot; and &quot;X. axonopodis&quot;====
&quot;Xanthomonas campestris&quot; and &quot;X. axonopodis&quot; can be inoculated by seed contamination and by overwintering in crop residue. Increased incidence with higher temperatures, rainfall, and humidity. Produces deliquescent, necrotic lesions, sometimes with a wider yellow lesion around them, and in advanced disease the plant will look burned. Can be prevented or treated by use of uninfected seed, resistant cultivars, seed treatments, and copper bactericides.

====&quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot;====
&quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot; overwinters on residue. Uninfected seed, rotation, and removal of residue are preventative.

===Viral diseases===
&quot;Faba bean necrotic yellows virus&quot; which it shares with other &quot;Vicia&quot;. Timchenko et al. 2006 find Clink is not obviously necessary but highly conserved nonetheless, suggesting it is maintained by necessity for infection of other &quot;Vicia&quot;.

===Insect pests===
====&quot;Aphis fabae&quot;====
Broad bean plants are highly susceptible to early summer infestations of the black bean aphid, which can cover large sections of growing plants with infestations, typically starting at the tip of the plant. Severe infestations can significantly reduce yields, and can also cause discolouration of pods and reduction in their saleable values.

&quot;Aphis fabae&quot; is a major pest. May infest transplants. Reflective plastic mulch may be preventative. May be mechanically removed by high pressure water once plant is established. &quot;V. fabae&quot; is tolerant to low and medium degrees of infestation, so insecticide application is only required under high infestation.

== Toxicity ==
Beans generally contain phytohaemagglutinin, a lectin that occurs naturally in plants, animals, and humans. Most of the relatively low toxin concentrations found in &quot;V. faba&quot; can be destroyed by boiling the beans for 10 minutes.

Broad beans are rich in levodopa, and should thus be avoided by those taking irreversible monoamine oxidase inhibitors to prevent a pressor response.

===Genetic predisposition===
Sufferers of favism must avoid broad beans, as they contain the alkaloid glycoside vicine which may initiate a hemolytic crisis. A low-content vicine-convicine faba bean line was identified in the 1980s and the trait has been introduced into several modern cultivars. Low vicine-convicine faba beans are safe for consumption by G6PD-deficient individuals. As of 2019, a molecular marker may be used for marker-assisted breeding to reduce levels of vicine-convicine in broad beans.

==Uses==
===Culinary===

Raw mature broad beans are 11% water, 58% carbohydrates, 26% protein, and 2% fat. A 100-gram reference amount supplies of food energy and numerous essential nutrients in high content (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV). Folate (26% DV), and dietary minerals, such as manganese, phosphorus, magnesium, and iron (range of 52 to 77% DV), have considerable content. B vitamins have moderate to rich content (19 to 48% DV). Broad beans present the highest protein-to-carbohydrate ratio among other popular pulse crops, such as chickpea, pea and lentil. Moreover, their consumption is recommended along with cereals as both foods are complementary in supplying all essential amino acids.

Broad beans are generally eaten while still young and tender, enabling harvesting to begin as early as the middle of spring for plants started under glass or overwintered in a protected location, but even the main crop sown in early spring will be ready from mid to late summer. Horse beans, left to mature fully, are usually harvested in the late autumn, and are then eaten as a pulse. The immature pods are also cooked and eaten, and the young leaves of the plant can also be eaten, either raw or cooked as a pot herb (like spinach).

Preparing broad beans involves first removing the beans from their pods, then steaming or boiling the beans, either whole or after parboiling them to loosen their exterior coating, which is then removed. The beans can be fried, causing the skin to split open, and then salted and/or spiced to produce a savory, crunchy snack.

====Algeria====
In south Algerian cuisine, broad beans are used to make besarah and doubara. Doubara is popular in the city of Biskra.

====China====
In the Sichuan cuisine of China, broad beans are combined with soybeans and chili peppers to produce a spicy fermented bean paste called &quot;doubanjiang&quot;.

====Colombia====
Broad beans (Colombia: Haba(s)) are a common food in most regions of Colombia, mostly in Bogota and Boyacá.

==== Ecuador ====
Steamed broad beans (known as &quot;habitas&quot;) with cheese is common in the cold-weather regions of Ecuador, especially around the Andes mountains and surroundings of Ambato.

====Egypt====
Broad beans (Egyptian Masri: &quot;&quot; ) are a common staple food in the Egyptian diet, eaten by rich and poor alike. Egyptians eat broad beans in various ways: they may be shelled and then dried, or bought dried and then cooked in water on very low heat for several hours. They are the primary ingredient in Egyptian-style falafel (unlike the Levantine style, where the primary ingredient is chickpeas). The most popular way of preparing them in Egypt is by taking the cooked and partially mashed beans and adding oil, salt, and cumin to them. The dish, known as &quot;ful medames&quot;, is traditionally eaten with bread (generally at breakfast) and is considered one of Egypt&#x27;s national dishes.

====Ethiopia====
Broad beans () are one of the most popular legumes in Ethiopia. They are tightly coupled with every aspect of Ethiopian life. They are mainly used as an alternative to peas to prepare a flour called &quot;shiro&quot;, which is used to make &quot;shiro wot&quot; (a stew used widely in Ethiopian dishes). During the fasting period in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church tradition called &quot;Tsome Filliseta, Tsome arbeå, Tsome Tahsas&quot;, and &quot;Tsome Hawaria&quot; (which are in August, end of February, April, mid-November, beginning of January, and June–July), two uncooked spicy vegetable dishes are made using broad beans. The first is &quot;hilibet&quot;, a thin, white paste of broad bean flour mixed with pieces of onion, green pepper, garlic, and other spices. The second is &quot;siljo&quot;, a fermented, sour, spicy thin yellow paste of broad bean flour. Both are served with other stews and &quot;injera&quot; (a pancake-like bread) during lunch and dinner.

&quot;Baqella nifro&quot; (boiled broad beans) are eaten as a snack during some holidays and during a time of mourning. This tradition goes well into religious holidays, too. On the Thursday before Good Friday (in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church tradition, &quot;tselote hamus&quot; (the Prayer of Thursday)), people eat a different kind of &quot;nifro&quot; called &quot;gulban&quot;. &quot;Gulban&quot; is made of peeled half-beans collected and well-cooked with other grains such as wheat, peas, and chickpeas.

====England====
In England, broad beans are usually boiled.

There is a project aimed at increasing broad bean consumption, particularly by use of broad bean flour in bread.

====Finland====

In Finnish, the word for &quot;broad bean&quot; is (literally &quot;ox bean&quot;). Broad beans are used to make a meat substitute called Härkis.

====Greece====
The Greek word &quot;fáva&quot; (φάβα) does &quot;not&quot; refer to broad beans, but to the yellow split pea and also to another legume, &quot;Lathyrus clymenum&quot;. Broad beans are known instead as &quot;koukiá&quot; (), and are eaten in a stew combined with artichokes, while they are still fresh in their pods. Dried broad beans are eaten boiled, sometimes combined with garlic sauce (&quot;skordalia&quot;).

In Crete, fresh broad beans are shelled and eaten as a companion to &quot;tsikoudia&quot;, the local alcoholic drink.

Favism is quite common in Greece because of malaria endemicity in previous centuries, and people afflicted by it do not eat broad beans.

====India====
In India, broad beans are eaten in the Northeastern state of Manipur. They are locally known as &quot;hawai-amubi&quot; and are ingredients in the dish eromba.

====Iran====
Broad beans, or &quot;Baghalee&quot; () are primarily cultivated in the central and north parts of Iran. The city of Kashan has the highest production of broad beans with high quality in terms of the taste, cooking periods and colour. However, broad beans have a very short season (roughly two weeks). The season is usually in the middle of spring. When people have access to fresh beans in season, they cook them in brine and then add vinegar and &quot;Heracleum persicum&quot; depending on taste. They also make an extra amount to dry to be used year-round. The dried beans can be cooked with rice, which forms one of the most famous dishes in north of Iran (Gilan) called &quot;baghalee polo&quot; () which means &quot;rice with broad beans&quot;. In Iran, broad beans are cooked, served with Golpar-origan and salt and sold on streets in the winter. This food is also available preserved in metal cans.

====Iraq====
Broad beans which are called Bagilla (باگله/باقله) in the Iraqi dialect of Arabic are a common ingredient in many Iraqi foods. One of the most popular Iraqi dishes that uses the broad bean is Bagilla Bil-Dihin () also called Tishreeb Bagilla (). This dish is a common breakfast dish in Iraq and consists of bread soaked in boiled broad beans’ water then topped with broad beans, melted Ghee, and often also a boiled or fried egg. Fool () is another common breakfast dish in Iraq as well as many other Arab countries and consists of mashed broad beans. Another famous Iraqi dish is Timmen Bagilla (), which is Arabic for &#x27;broad bean rice&#x27;. This classic Iraqi dish consists of rice cooked with broad bean and dill.

====Italy====
In Sardinia, broad beans are traditionally cooked with lard, often substituted or paired with bacon or minced pork.

In Rome, broad beans are popular either cooked with &quot;guanciale&quot; or with globe artichokes, as side dish together with lamb or kid, or raw with &quot;pecorino romano&quot;. &quot;Fave e pecorino&quot; is the traditional dish for 1 May picnic in Liguria, Tuscany, Marche, Umbria and Latium.

In Sicily, &quot;maccu&quot; is a Sicilian soup prepared with broad beans as a primary ingredient.

In Apulia, broad bean purée with wild chicory is a typical dish.

====Japan====
Broad beans, called soramame (Japanese: ) lit: &quot;sky bean&quot;, are consumed in a variety of ways in Japan. Most commonly, the beans are boiled and are eaten straight or added to rice. It is also consumed as a popular snack called &quot;ikarimame&quot; (Japanese: ) lit: &quot;anchor bean&quot;, in which the beans are roasted or fried.

====Luxembourg====
&quot;Judd mat Gaardebounen&quot;, or smoked collar of pork with broad beans, is the national dish of Luxembourg.

====Malta====

They are a primary ingredient of the Maltese kusksu, a vegetable soup primarily containing broad beans and pasta beads. They are also used in an appetizer called &quot;bigilla&quot; where they are served as a pureé mixed with olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, parsley and mint. It is served with bread or crackers.

====Mexico====
In Mexico, broad beans are often eaten in a soup called , meaning &quot;broad bean soup&quot;. They are also eaten fried, salted, and dried, as a snack, either by themselves or in combination with other salted, dried beans and nuts.

====Morocco====
In Morocco, broad beans are cooked, steamed or made into tabiṣart, a dip sold as a street food and commonly eaten in winter.

====Nepal====
In Nepal, broad beans are called &quot;bakulla&quot;. They are eaten as a green vegetable when the pods are young, generally stir-fried with garlic. When dried, broad beans are eaten roasted, or mixed with other legumes, such as moong beans, chick peas, and peas, and called &quot;qwati&quot;. The mixture, soaked and germinated, is cooked as soup and consumed with rice or beaten rice on the occasion of &quot;Janai Purnima&quot; also known as &quot;Rakshya Bandhan&quot;, a festival celebrated by the Hindus. The dry and stir-fried version of &quot;qwati&quot; is called &quot;biraula&quot;. The &quot;qwati&quot; soup is believed to reinvigorate the body affected by monsoon paddy season.

====Netherlands====
In the Netherlands, they are traditionally eaten with fresh savory and some melted butter. The combination of the beans tossed with crispy fried bacon is also common. When rubbed, the velvet insides of the pods are a folk remedy against warts.

====Peru====
Broad beans (Peruvian Spanish: &quot;haba(s)&quot;) are eaten fresh or dry-toasted, boiled, roasted, stewed or in soup. Habas are one of the essential ingredients of pachamanca in the Andes of Peru, and are also an additive for panetela, a homemade remedy to keep children fed and hydrated in cases of diarrhea or stomach infection and for cholera treatment.

Peruvian dishes with broad beans include:
* Aji de habas
* Saltado de habas
* El chupe de habas
* Ajiaco de papas y habas
* Pachamanca
* Guiso de habas
* Shambar (heavy soup, traditional in Trujillo)

====Portugal====

Broad beans () are widely cultivated in Portugal and are very popular throughout the country. The most popular dish cooked with favas is &quot;favada&quot;, a stew with onion and pork—depending on the region of the country the pork may be chorizo, bacon, pork shoulder, ribs or the mixture of many of these. In Alentejo a lot of coriander will be added in the end. Besides favada, broad beans may be served dry and fried as an appetiser.

====Serbia====
Broad bean aspic (Serbian: ) is a Serbian winter dish in which the pureed cooked beans are combined with crushed garlic and set in a mould, topped with ground paprika in hot oil.

====Spain====
Broad beans () are widely cultivated in Spain. Culinary uses vary among regions, but they can be used as the main pulse in a stew (&quot;Habas estofadas, michirones&quot;) or as an addition to other dishes (&quot;menestra, paella&quot;). In certain regions they can be eaten while unripe or fried and packaged as a snack.

====Sudan====
Broad beans are one of the most widely consumed foods in Sudan. For most Sudanese they form the main dish during breakfast time (fatoor), especially more so for city and urban dwellers. The beans are cooked by steadily boiling over a sustained period of time. Similar to Egypt, the cooked beans are mashed, and prepared by adding salt and pepper. For additional flavour, sesame oil is added along with a sprinkling of jibna (&quot;feta&quot; cheese) on top. The dish is then eaten with bread, sometimes mix all in one dish this called (fatta or boash).

====Sweden====
Broad beans (), which in Sweden were traditionally eaten as soaked brown, and boiled, dried broad beans fried in lard, were for a very long time popular to add to other foods as a filling side, specially with fried pork. The green, raw, and lightly boiled broad beans were used seasonally as a side green.

====Syria====
In Syria, broad beans are prepared in multiple ways for breakfast, lunch or dinner. &quot;Ful medames&quot; is the same as the Egyptian dish (it is not mashed though) but with the addition of tomato, parsley and onion and with olive oil. Another version of it includes the addition of tahini (sesame paste), olive oil, garlic and lemon. For lunch, broad beans are cooked with a mix of minced and big chunks of meat and is topped on white rice and eaten with cold yogurt and cucumber salad. Bulgur is sometimes used in preparing this recipe instead of rice. Broad beans are cooked with pieces of garlic, meat and meat stock with the addition of lemon juice and cilantro. This dish is called &quot;foulieh&quot; and is eaten on the side with rice. The same recipe is prepared without meat as a vegan dish eaten on Lent by Christians in Syria.

====Turkey====
In Turkey, broad beans are called &#x27;. This is also the name of a &quot;zeytinyağlı&quot; dish made by simmering young and tender broad bean pods with chopped onions in olive oil. It is traditionally garnished with dill and served cool, together with yoghurt. Another dish is &#x27;, a meze prepared by pureeing beans with olive oil. Broad beans are also cooked with artichoke (&quot;&quot;), which is another &quot;zeytinyağlı&quot; dish.

====Vietnam====
In Southern Vietnam, broad beans () are usually stir fried with rice noodles, durians, shrimps, Thai basil, quail eggs and pig intestines in a dry stew called &quot;hủ tiếu lòng heo&quot;.

===Other uses===
* In ancient Greece and Rome, beans were used in voting; a white bean was used to cast a &quot;yes&quot; vote, and a black bean for &quot;no&quot;. Even today, the word&quot; koukia&quot; (κουκιά) is used unofficially, referring to the votes. Beans were used as a food for the dead, such as during the annual Lemuria festival.
* The ancient Roman family name Fabius and the modern political term &quot;Fabian&quot; derive from this particular bean.
* Both Porphyry and Iamblichus report that Pythagoras once persuaded a bull not to eat beans
* In Ubykh culture, throwing beans on the ground and interpreting the pattern in which they fall was a common method of divination (favomancy), and the word for &quot;bean-thrower&quot; in that language has become a generic term for seers and soothsayers in general.
* The colloquial expression &#x27;not worth a hill of beans&#x27; alludes to their widespread economy and association with the peasant diet.
* In Italy, broad beans are traditionally sown on 2 November, All Souls Day. Small cakes made in the shape of broad beans (though not out of them) are known as &quot;fave dei morti&quot; or &quot;beans of the dead&quot;. According to tradition, Sicily once experienced a failure of all crops other than the beans; the beans kept the population from starvation, and thanks were given to Saint Joseph. Broad beans subsequently became traditional on Saint Joseph&#x27;s Day altars in many Italian communities. Some people carry a broad bean for good luck; some believe that if one carries a broad bean, one will never be without the essentials of life. In Rome, on the first of May, Roman families traditionally eat fresh broad beans with Pecorino Romano cheese during a daily excursion in the Campagna. In northern Italy, on the contrary, broad beans are traditionally fed to animals—and so some people, especially the elderly, might frown on human consumption. But in Liguria, a maritime region near northern Italy, broad beans are loved raw, and consumed fresh in early spring as the first product of the garden, alone or with fresh Pecorino Sardo or with local salami from Sant&#x27;Olcese. In some Central Italian regions, a once-popular and recently rediscovered fancy food is the &quot;bagiana&quot;, a soup of fresh or dried broad beans seasoned with onions and beet leaves stir-fried, before being added to the soup, in olive oil and lard (or bacon or cured ham fat).
* In Portugal and Spain a Christmas cake called &quot;bolo Rei&quot; in Portuguese and &quot;roscón de reyes&quot; in Spanish (King&#x27;s cake) is baked with a broad bean inside. Whoever eats the slice containing it, is supposed to buy next year&#x27;s cake.
* A similar tradition exists in France, where the &quot;fève&quot; (originally a dried bean, but often now a small china or metal trinket) is placed in the &quot;galette des rois&quot;; the person who finds it in their slice becomes the king or queen of the meal, and is often expected to serve the other guests to drink.
* Pliny claimed they acted as a laxative.
* European folklore also claims that planting beans on Good Friday or during the night brings good luck.
*&quot;Frederick E Rose (London) Ltd v William H Pim Junior &amp; Co Ltd&quot; [1953] 2 QB 450, is an English contract law case where the two litigants had both mistaken feveroles for ordinary horse beans.
* Can be used as a green manure, due to nitrogen fixation it produces.
* In the Netherlands, roasted or fried broad beans are regarded as a local delicacy of the city of Groningen, and is locally called &quot;molleboon&quot;. Until the 1800s, the city council used &quot;mollebonen&quot; for the voting process, sometimes real beans, sometimes made of stone or clay. The word &quot;Molleboon&quot; became a nickname for the inhabitants of the city.

<text>A shed is typically a simple, single-storey roofed structure, often used for storage, for hobbies, or as a workshop, and typically serving as outbuilding, such as in a back garden or on an allotment. Sheds vary considerably in their size and complexity of construction, from simple open-sided ones designed to cover bicycles or garden items to large wood-framed structures with shingled roofs, windows, and electrical outlets. Sheds used on farms or in the industry can be large structures. The main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (the roof may be asphalt shingled or sheathed in tin), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Small sheds may include a wooden or plastic floor, while more permanent ones may be built on a concrete pad or foundation. Sheds may be lockable to deter theft or entry by children, domestic animals, wildlife, etc.

== Etymology ==
The word is recorded in English since 1481, as , possibly a variant of shade. The word shade comes from the Old English word &quot;sceadu&quot;, which means &quot;shade, shadow, darkness&quot;. The term&#x27;s P.Gmc. cognate, &quot;skadwo&quot; also means &quot;shady place, protection from glare or heat&quot;.

The Old English word is spelled in different ways, such as , &quot;shad&quot; or &quot;shedde&quot;, all of which come from an Old Teutonic/Anglo-Saxon root word for separation or division. The first attested usage of the word, in 1481, was in the sentence, .

The Anglo Saxon word &quot;shud&quot;, which means &quot;cover&quot; may also have been part of the development of the word. In 1440, a shud was defined as a .

==Terminology==
Depending on the region and type of use, a shed may also be called a shack, outhouse, or &quot;outbuilding&quot;. Sheds may be classified as &quot;accessory buildings&quot; in municipal bylaws which may regulate their size, appearance, and distance from the principal building and boundary lines.

== Uses ==
===Agricultural sheds===
Arena sheds may have a simple open roof structure, or be partially walled or fully enclosed. They are typically used as horse-riding equestrian venues, providing all-year usage of the facility with protection from the weather.

Farm sheds and other outbuildings are used to store farm equipment, tractors, tools, hay, and supplies, or to house horses, cattle, poultry or other farm animals. Run-in sheds are three-sided structures with an open face used for horses and cattle.

Shearing sheds can be large sheds found on sheep stations to accommodate large-scale sheep shearing.

===Bike sheds===
Bicycle sheds usually contain a bicycle parking rack on which bikes can be supported and locked and a roof to keep rain and/or snow off the bikes and their riders while mounting and dismounting. Bike sheds range from little more than a supported roof to more complex structures with walls and locking doors or gates.

===Boatsheds===

Boatsheds (or boat sheds) are typically lockable wooden sheds built near a body of water to store small private boats, bathing suits, life vests and related items. Boat sheds used for rowing clubs are generally larger structures for storing rowing skiffs.

===Garden sheds===

Garden tool sheds, including allotment sheds, are used to store seeds, soil, hoses, portable sprinklers, or garden tools such as hand rakes, shovels, lawnmowers, etc.

===Railway sheds===

Engine sheds are structures used for the maintenance or storage of railway locomotives. In Britain, these are also called motive power depots.

Goods sheds are railway buildings designed for storing goods before or after carriage in a train.

Train sheds are buildings adjacent to a railway station where the tracks and platforms are covered by a roof. The first train shed was built in 1830 at Liverpool&#x27;s Crown Street Station.

Snow sheds are strongly built timber or reinforced-concrete tunnels that protect railroad tracks (or roads) from avalanches.

===Storage sheds===
These may contain any items any person wishes to store and to organise and/or protect from the weather and theft.

===Tool sheds===

These may contain hand tools and/or power tools used to repair automobiles or for construction.

===Wood sheds===
These sheds are used for the storage of large quantities of firewood. Woodsheds help protect firewood from adverse weather and moisture, especially in snowy or wet climates. Woodsheds are commonly in close proximity to buildings heated by a wood-burning stove, such as a log cabin. 

In the United States, &quot;the woodshed&quot; was the traditional location for parents to administer corporal punishment to children.

===Miscellaneous===
In the 19th century military barracks, sheds were used as auxiliary buildings for various purposes. The Royal Artillery park barracks in Halifax used sheds as gun sheds, carriage sheds, repair sheds, wheel sheds, wagon sheds and storage sheds.

== Construction ==
=== Small domestic ===
The simplest and least-expensive sheds are available in kit form. These kits are designed for regular people to be able to assemble themselves using commonly available tools (e.g., screwdriver). Both shed kits and DIY (do-it-yourself) plans are available for wooden and plastic sheds. Sheds are used to store home and garden tools and equipment such as lawn tractors, and gardening supplies. In addition, sheds can be used to store items that are not suitable for indoor storage, such as petrol (gasoline), pesticides, or herbicides. For homes with small gardens or modest storage needs, there are several types of very small sheds. The sheds not only use less ground area but also have a low profile less likely to obstruct the view or clash with the landscaping.
These small sheds include corner sheds, which fit into a corner (—tall, wide, deep), vertical sheds (), horizontal sheds (), and tool sheds. When a shed is used for tool storage, shelves and hooks are often used to maximise the storage space. Gambrel-style roofed sheds (sometimes called baby barns), which resemble a Dutch-style barn, have a high sloping roofline which increases storage space in the &quot;loft&quot; area. Some Gambrel-styles have no loft and offer the advantage of reduced overall height. Another style of small shed is the saltbox-style shed.

Many sheds have either a pent or apex roof shape. A pent shed features a single roof section that is angled downwards to let rainwater run off, with more headroom at the front than the back. This is a simple, practical design that will fit particularly well next to a wall or fence. It is also usually lower than the typical apex shed, so could be a better choice if there are any height restrictions. A pent shed may be free-standing or attached to a wall (when it is known, unsurprisingly, as a wall shed).

An apex shed has a pointed roof in an inverted V shape similar to the roofline of many houses. Two roof sections meet at a ridge in the middle, providing more headroom in the centre than at the sides. This type is generally regarded as a more attractive and traditional design and may be preferable if the shed is going to be visible from the house.

A twist on the standard apex shape is the reverse apex shed. In this design, the door is set in a side wall instead of the front. The main advantage of the reverse apex design is that the door opens into the widest part of the shed instead of the narrowest, so it is easier to reach into all areas to retrieve or store equipment.

=== Larger domestic ===

Larger, more-expensive sheds are typically constructed of wood and include features typically found in house construction, such as windows, a shingled roof, and electrical outlets. Larger sheds provide more space for engaging in hobbies such as gardening, small engine repair, or tinkering. Some sheds have small porches or include furniture, which allows them to be used for relaxation purposes. In some cases, remote workers who live in mild climates use small to medium-sized wooden garden sheds as outdoor offices. There is a growing industry in providing &quot;off the peg&quot; garden offices to cater to this demand, particularly in the UK but also in the US.
Shed owners can customise wooden sheds to match the features (e.g., siding, trim, etc.) of the main house. A number of decorative options can be added to sheds, such as dormers, shutters, flower boxes, finials, and weathervanes. As well, practical options can be added such as benches, ramps, ventilation systems (e.g., in cases where a swimming pool heater is installed in a shed), and electric lighting. Sheds designed for gardening, called &quot;potting sheds&quot;, often feature windows or skylights for illumination, ventilation grilles, and a potter&#x27;s bench for mixing soil and re-potting plants.
===Materials===
The main types of shed construction are metal sheathing over a metal frame, plastic sheathing and frame, all-wood construction (wood frame, wood siding and wood roof), and vinyl-sided sheds built over a wooden frame. Each type has various advantages and disadvantages that a homeowner has to consider. For example, while metal sheds are fire and termite-resistant, they can rust over time, or be severely damaged by high winds or heavy snow loads. Wood sheds are easier to modify or customise than plastic or metal because carpentry tools and basic carpentry skills are more readily available. Vinyl-sided, wood-framed sheds blend the strength of a wood frame with the maintenance-free aspect of vinyl siding (it does not need to be painted or varnished). The International Building Code (IBC) defines a shed as a building or structure of an accessory character; it classifies them under utility and miscellaneous group U (Chapter 3 Section 312).

====Metal====

Metal sheds are made from thin sheet metal sheathing (galvanised steel, aluminium, or corrugated iron) attached to a metal frame. Metal sheds are a good choice when long-term strength and resistance to fire, rot, or termites are desired. However, metal sheds may rust over time, particularly if they are constructed from steel that is not galvanised. Be aware that concrete is highly corrosive so care needs to be taken when assembling your shed to avoid contact with the outside panels.

As well, some types of metal sheds that have thin walls are easily dented, which may make some types of thin metal sheds a poor choice for vandal-prone areas or for high-traffic activities such as small businesses. In cold climates, metal sheds with thin walls need to have snow and ice cleared from the roof, because the thin metal may be damaged by a heavy accumulation. Since thin metal sheds weigh much less than wood or PVC plastic sheds, thin metal sheds are more at risk of being damaged by heavy winds. To prevent wind damage, thin metal sheds should be attached to a concrete foundation with screws. In countries where the climate is generally mild, such as Australia, very large metal sheds are used for many types of industry. Corrugated metal sheds may be better able to withstand wind and snow loads, as the corrugated shape makes the metal stronger than flat tin.

====Plastic====

Plastic shed kits utilising heavy moulded plastics such as PVC and polyethylene may be less expensive than sheet-metal sheds. PVC resins and high-impact, UV light-resistant polyethylene make plastic outdoor sheds stronger, lighter, more durable, and more resistant to denting and chipping than wood, and tend to be more stable. Plastic shed kits sided with vinyl are typically among the least-expensive types of shed construction. Higher-quality sheds use UV-resistant plastic and powder-coated metal frames. Many plastic sheds are modular to allow for easy extensions, peg-boards, shelving, attic-storage, windows, skylights, and other accessories to be added later if these additions are purchased from the manufacturer.

Plastic sheds are not susceptible to termite or wood-boring insect damage, and they require little maintenance. Being rot-proof they do not need to have preservatives applied. This makes them preferable in climates where the weather can be changeable, such as the United Kingdom. Unlike wooden or metal sheds, which often require a permit to build, in many areas, plastic sheds do not. However, this is something property owners will need to verify. A call to your council/town&#x27;s planning or building code office can provide information on permits.

====Wood====

Wooden sheds have a natural look that can blend in well with garden environments. Despite the strength of wood, over time, untreated and neglected wood can rot, split, warp or become susceptible to mold and mildew, so wood sheds should be treated for protection with stain and varnish. Wood sheds need regular maintenance. This includes keeping plant matter and debris from piling up beside the walls and on the roof, and occasional rot-proofing with preservatives. Sheds are sometimes also re-stained or varnished at times for aesthetic and wood protection reasons. Fire and, in some regions, termite attack are also potential problems.

Stains and preservatives can be applied to wood sheds to prevent damage to the wood caused by exposure to rain, damp ground, UV light, harsh climatic conditions, fungal attack and wood-boring insects. If a coloured preservative oil or stain is used, a wooden shed can either be made to stand out as a feature within a garden, or to blend in with its surroundings. Red cedar coloured stain is popular. Legislation such as the European Biocidal Products Regulation has reduced the number of effective active ingredients available for wood preservative formulations. For this reason, in recent years, there has been a greater emphasis on preserving wood by keeping it dry, for example through the application of water-repellent &quot;wood protection creams.&quot;

Some types of wood, such as cedar, are more naturally resistant to water damage.

When looking for a wooden shed, it is important to understand the difference between the two types of preservative used in their manufacture. The timber will have been treated in one of two ways: dip treatment or pressure treatment. Dip-treated sheds are made from components that are lowered into a tank of preservatives before the panels are assembled. This is a quick and simple process that keeps costs down and encourages manufacturers to produce a wide variety, making dip-treated sheds the most popular and affordable type on the market. They are easily recognisable by their golden brown colour, which is due to a dye added to the preservative. Most manufacturers offer a 10-year anti-rot guarantee on dip-treated sheds, but they have to be re-coated every year or two.

Pressure-treated sheds are made from timber planks that have had the moisture sucked out of them under vacuum conditions in a special cylinder. A powerful preservative is then forced into the wood at high pressure until it is absorbed deep into the grain, becoming an integral part of the timber. This provides excellent protection against the weather—so much so that manufacturers generally give a 15-year anti-rot guarantee. These sheds are usually distinguished by a pale green tinge which will fade eventually to a silvery grey. Although pressure-treated sheds tend to be more expensive than dip-treated ones, their big advantage is that they will not need any further preservative treatment during the guarantee period, saving owners time and money.

One advantage of using wood sheds over metal versions is that it is easier to modify them by adding windows, doors, shelving, or exterior trim (etc.) because wood can be cut and drilled using commonly available tools, whereas a plastic or metal shed requires specialised tools. Some homeowners may prefer wood sheds because wood is a renewable resource.

====Vinyl-sided====

Vinyl-sided sheds are typically built with standard wood framing construction and oriented strand board (OSB) on the walls covered with standard vinyl siding. The vinyl siding protects the OSB wood and the frame from moisture from rain and snow. Vinyl-sided sheds never need to be painted, and are maintenance-free. They are stronger than plastic or metal sheds, and are usually built to conform with the local building codes. They offer good value for money because they hold up in all weather, including winters with heavy snowfall, as they use a strong wooden frame and the OSB panels have stronger structural support than thin metal or PVC siding or roofs. Metal, plastic and resin sheds are cheaper, but they cannot handle the weight of snow in winter (roofs may cave in). Vinyl sheds also offer more colour options.

====Asbestos====
In the early and middle years of the 20th century, many garden sheds and domestic garages were made of asbestos-cement sheets supported on a very light angle-iron frame. Concerns about safety led to the practice being discontinued, but they were cheap and long-lasting, and many can still be seen in British gardens. Advice on continued use or disposal is available.

==Culture==


In Australia and New Zealand the term &quot;shed&quot; can be used to refer to any building that is not a residence and which may be open at the ends or sides, or both. Australia&#x27;s passion for sheds is documented in Mark Thomson&#x27;s &quot;Blokes and Sheds&quot; (1998). Jim Hopkins&#x27; similarly titled &quot;Blokes &amp; Sheds&quot; (1998), with photographer Julie Riley Hopkins, profiles amateur inventors from across New Zealand. Hopkins and Riley followed up that book with &quot;Inventions from the Shed&quot; (1999) and a 5-part film documentary series with the same name. Gordon Thorburn also examined the shed proclivity in his book &quot;Men and Sheds&quot; (2002), as did Gareth Jones in &quot;Shed Men&quot; (2004).

Recently, &quot;Men&#x27;s Sheds&quot; have become common in Australia. In New Zealand, the bi-monthly magazine &quot;The Shed&quot; appeals to the culture of &quot;blokes&quot; who do woodwork or metalwork DIY projects in their sheds. The Australian Men&#x27;s Shed Association is one organisation that has been set up involving sheds.

Another magazine called &quot;The Shed&quot;, a bi-monthly PDF magazine produced in the UK, but with a global audience, targets people who work (usually in creative industries) in garden offices, sheds and other shed-like atmospheres. In the UK, people have long enjoyed working in their potting sheds; the slang term &quot;sheddie&quot;, refers to a person enamoured of shed-building, testifies to the place of sheds in the UK popular culture. The Usenet newsgroup &quot;uk.rec.sheds&quot; has long championed this subculture.

Since 2007 there has been a UK competition called &quot;Shed of the Year&quot;. Each year British sheddies enter their shed builds and after a short list is produced (including Pub Sheds, Eco Sheds, Workshops &amp; unexpected categories), a public vote helps to decide the ultimate Shed, it also featured on Channel 4 television as &quot;George Clarke&#x27;s Amazing Spaces: Shed of the Year&quot;, for four series (with host George Clarke)

In the United States, &quot;Shed Builder Magazine&quot; is a bimonthly magazine dedicated to the builders, dealers, and manufacturers within the shed industry. The magazine owns and manages Shed Builder Expo, a yearly, two-day conference for the shed industry. 

Author Gordon Thorburn examined the shed proclivity in his book &quot;Men and Sheds&quot;, which argues that a &quot;place of retreat&quot; is a &quot;male necessity&quot; which provides men with solace, especially during their retirement. In contrast, in the novel &quot;Cold Comfort Farm&quot; by Stella Gibbons, Aunt Ada Doom saw &quot;something nasty in the woodshed&quot; and retreated to her bed for half a century.

To woodshed, or &#x27;shed, in jazz jargon, is &quot;to shut oneself up, away from the world, and practice long and hard, as in &#x27;going to the woodshed&#x27;.&quot;

A shed built onto the chassis of an old car, and called Fastest Shed, is legally roadworthy in the UK, and holds the world speed record for sheds.

<doc id="264504" wikidata="Q662063" url="?curid=264504" title="John Lydgate">
<text>John Lydgate of Bury () was an English monk and poet, born in Lidgate, near Haverhill, Suffolk, England.

Lydgate&#x27;s poetic output is prodigious, amounting, at a conservative count, to about 145,000 lines. He explored and established every major Chaucerian genre, except such as were manifestly unsuited to his profession, like the &quot;fabliau&quot;. In the &quot;Troy Book&quot; (30,117 lines), an amplified translation of the Trojan history of the thirteenth-century Latin writer Guido delle Colonne, commissioned by Prince Henry (later Henry V), he moved deliberately beyond Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; and his &quot;Troilus&quot;, to provide a full-scale epic.

The &quot;Siege of Thebes&quot; (4716 lines) is a shorter excursion in the same field of chivalric epic. Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Monk&#x27;s Tale&quot;, a brief catalog of the vicissitudes of Fortune, gives a hint of what is to come in Lydgate&#x27;s massive &quot;Fall of Princes&quot; (36,365 lines), which is also derived, though not directly, from Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;De Casibus Virorum Illustrium&quot;.

&quot;The Man of Law&#x27;s Tale&quot;, with its rhetorical elaboration of apostrophe, invocation, and digression in what is essentially a saint&#x27;s legend, is the model for Lydgate&#x27;s legends of St Edmund (3693 lines) and St Alban (4734 lines), both local monastic patrons, as well as for many shorter saints&#x27; lives, though not for the richer and more genuinely devout &quot;Life of Our Lady&quot; (5932 lines).

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
In a graffito written towards the end of his life, Lydgate admitted to all manner of childhood sins: &quot;I lied to excuse myself. I stole apples … I made mouths at people like a wanton ape. I gambled at cherry stones. I was late to rise and dirty at meals. I was chief shammer of illness&quot;. He was admitted to the Benedictine monastery of Bury St Edmunds Abbey in 1382, took novice vows soon after and was ordained as a subdeacon in 1389. Based on a letter from Henry V, Lydgate was a student at Oxford University, probably Gloucester College (now Worcester College), between 1406 and 1408. It was during this period that Lydgate wrote his early work, &quot;Isopes Fabules&quot;, with its broad range of scholastic references.

=== Career ===

Having literary ambitions (he was an admirer of Geoffrey Chaucer and a friend to his son, Thomas) he sought and obtained patronage for his literary work at the courts of Henry IV of England, Henry V of England and Henry VI of England. His patrons included, amongst many others, the mayor and aldermen of London, the chapter of St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, Richard de Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick and Henry V and VI. His main supporter from 1422 was Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester.

In 1423 Lydgate was made prior of Hatfield Broad Oak, Essex. He soon resigned the office to concentrate on his travels and writing. He was a prolific writer of poems, allegories, fables and romances. His most famous works were his longer and more moralistic &quot;Troy Book&quot; (1412–20), a 30,000 line translation of the Latin prose narrative by Guido delle Colonne, &quot;Historia destructionis Troiae&quot;, the &quot;Siege of Thebes&quot; which was translated from a French prose redaction of the &quot;Roman de Thebes&quot; and the &quot;Fall of Princes&quot;. The &quot;Fall of Princes&quot; (1431–8), is the last and longest of Lydgate&#x27;s works.

Of his more accessible poems, most were written in the first decade of the fifteenth century in a Chaucerian vein: &quot;The Complaint of the Black Knight&quot; (originally called &quot;A Complaynt of a Loveres Lyfe&quot; and modelled on Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Book of the Duchess&quot;); &quot;The Temple of Glas&quot; (indebted to &quot;The House of Fame&quot;); &quot;The Floure of Curtesy&quot; (like the &quot;Parlement of Foules&quot;, a Valentine&#x27;s Day Poem); and the allegorical &quot;Reason and Sensuality&quot;.

As he grew older, his poems grew progressively longer, and it is regarding Lydgate&#x27;s later poetry that Joseph Ritson&#x27;s harsh characterisation of him is based: &#x27;A voluminous, prosaick and drivelling monk&#x27;. Similarly, one twentieth-century historian has described Lydgate&#x27;s verse as &quot;banal&quot;.

At one time, the long allegorical poem &quot;The Assembly of Gods&quot; was attributed to him, but the work is now considered anonymous. Lydgate was also believed to have written &quot;London Lickpenny,&quot; a well-known satirical work; however, his authorship of this piece has been thoroughly discredited. He also translated the poems of Guillaume de Deguileville into English.

In his later years he lived and probably died at Bury St Edmunds Abbey. At some point in his life he returned to the village of his birth and added his signature and a coded message in a graffito onto a wall at St Mary&#x27;s Church, Lidgate, discovered in 2014.

<doc id="264507" wikidata="Q381405" url="?curid=264507" title="Gareth Gates">
<text>Gareth Paul Gates (born 12 July 1984) is an English singer-songwriter and actor. He was the runner-up in the first series of the ITV talent show &quot;Pop Idol&quot; in 2002. As of 2008, Gates had sold over 3.5 million records in the UK. He is also known for having a stutter, and has talked about his speech impediment publicly.

In 2009, Gates moved into musical theatre, playing the title role in the West End production of &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre. From 2009 to 2011, Gates completed an 18-month stint as Marius in &quot;Les Misérables&quot;, initially in the touring production, and then in the West End production of the show. He also took the roles of Eddie in the musical &quot;Loserville&quot;, Warner in &quot;Legally Blonde&quot; in 2012 and Dean in &quot;Boogie Nights the Musical in Concert&quot; in 2013. He was part of the pop group 5th Story, set up for &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;.

==Early life==
Gates was born in West Bowling, Bradford, to Paul Gates and Wendy Gates (née Broadbent Farry). He has three sisters, and grew up with a cousin who was fostered by the family. His parents regularly foster other children. Gates and his sisters attended Dixons City Technology College in West Bowling, Bradford, where Gates studied art and music at GCSE level.

He joined Bradford Cathedral choir at the age of nine. He was head chorister by the age of eleven, singing solo for Queen Elizabeth II when she visited in 1997. Gates achieved Grade 8 in piano, classical guitar and singing. He became a Christian through Bradford&#x27;s Abundant Life church, where he played his guitar. Gates gained a reserve place at the Royal Northern College of Music in Manchester before the finals of &quot;Pop Idol&quot;.

==Career==

===2002–2003: &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, &quot;What My Heart Wants to Say&quot; and &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;===
Gates was the runner-up to Will Young on the first series of &quot;Pop Idol&quot; in February 2002. Gates auditioned with Flying Without Wings and was put through to the next round of the show. Despite not winning the competition, he was soon signed up by Simon Cowell to the BMG label.

Gates&#x27; first single, a cover of &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, entered the UK Singles Chart at number one. The single went double-platinum in the UK, and was voted 2002&#x27;s The Record of the Year by ITV viewers. This was followed by another number-one single, &quot;Anyone of Us (Stupid Mistake)&quot;. His third single, a double A-side &quot;Suspicious Minds&quot;/&quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot;, a duet with &quot;Pop Idol&quot; winner Will Young, also reached number one. His fourth, &quot;What My Heart Wants to Say&quot;, reached number five. Gates&#x27;s debut album &quot;What My Heart Wants to Say&quot; achieved first week sales of 100,000 copies, peaking at number two in the UK Albums Chart, and eventually earned double platinum status in the UK.

&quot;Smash Hits&quot; magazine dedicated 7 October 2002 as International Gareth Gates Day. In 2003, Gates sang the 2003 Comic Relief charity single, &quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;, with The Kumars. The single was a UK number-one for two weeks. He also appeared in Comic Relief&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Driving School&quot;. Through Comic Relief, he became involved with Body and Soul, a charity that helps people affected by HIV and AIDS.

His next single, &quot;Sunshine&quot;, reached number three and was taken from his second album &quot;Go Your Own Way&quot;, which was released in October 2003. However, the album was far less successful than his debut album. It peaked at number eleven in the UK before dropping to No. 32 the following week, and only spent four weeks on the album chart altogether. The album enjoyed slightly more success in a number of Asian countries however, and Gates won MTV Asia&#x27;s award for Best International Male in 2003/04. He was awarded the same title by MTV China and MTV Taiwan.

His next single, &quot;Say it Isn&#x27;t So&quot;, reached number four in late 2003, but proved to be Gates&#x27; last single release in the UK until April 2007. At the start of 2004 he did an arena tour of the UK, then continued to promote his album throughout Europe and Asia, before taking a break and training as a speech coach and course instructor with the McGuire Programme.

By this point, Gates had sold just over three million music singles in the UK, including the second and sixth best selling singles in 2002 (&quot;Unchained Melody&quot;, which sold 1.4 million, and &quot;Anyone of Us (Stupid Mistake)&quot;, which sold 581,000) and the second-best-selling single in 2003 (&quot;Spirit in the Sky&quot;, 561,000 copies). All three of these singles were listed in the Top 100 singles of the decade (2000–2009) as announced on Radio 1 with Spirit in the Sky at no. 62, Anyone of Us (no. 56), and Unchained Melody (no. 2). The biggest-selling single of the decade was &quot;Anything is Possible&quot;/&quot;Evergreen&quot; by Will Young, whom Gates had lost the &quot;Pop Idol&quot; contest to. In the 2003 film &quot;Seeing Double&quot;, alongside pop group S Club, Gates played a clone version of himself. He also promoted AIDS awareness through a charity concert to 50,000 people with MTV in Indonesia.

===2004–2009: &quot;Pictures of the Other Side&quot; and &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;===
In 2003 and 2004, it was reported that Gates was being dropped by his record company BMG. The reports, which also cited low sales of his second album and low concert ticket sales as reasons, were denied by both Gates and the record company at the time. Gates was later dropped from the label in April 2006 before the release of any new material.

In 2006, Gates appeared in a television documentary for ITV1 called &quot;Whatever Happened To Gareth Gates?&quot;, which dealt with his experiences in the music industry and his life outside it. The documentary was screened in December 2006, and confirmed a new record deal with UMTV (part of Universal) and a new album as well as showcasing snippets of the new material. An early preview of his new album was given at a secret gig on 29 November 2006. Gates had been working with writers such as Sacha Skarbek (who has worked with James Blunt), Ricky Ross (of Deacon Blue), Gary Clark and Pete Gordeno, and new the album was produced by Martin Terefe, Jon Hall and Nick Whitecross.

Since 2004 Gates had also been working with singer-songwriter Judie Tzuke. Initial contact was apparently made through Lucie Silvas. Gates&#x27; regular acoustic guitarist, Graham Kearns, also worked with Tzuke and has writing credits with Gates on both albums. Appearing at the Limelight venue in Crewe during Tzuke&#x27;s October 2004 tour, Gates sang backing vocals to a surprised audience on Tzuke&#x27;s track &quot;Bully&quot; (from her album &quot;Secret Agent&quot;). A song Gates co-wrote with Tzuke, &quot;Dark Days&quot;, appeared on Tzuke&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Songs 1&quot;.

On 30 March 2007, Gates appeared on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;, the first time he had participated in an interview for a mainstream television chat-show since his speech improvement.

The first single from Gates&#x27; third album was &quot;Changes&quot; which was released on 9 April 2007. The single peaked at Number 14. A second single, &quot;Angel on My Shoulder&quot;, was released on 18 June 2007, peaking at Number 22. Both singles remained in the UK Top 40 for only one week. Gates&#x27; third album, &quot;Pictures of the Other Side&quot;, was released on 25 June 2007. It proved to be Gates&#x27; lowest selling album to date and spent only two weeks on the UK album chart, entering at Number 23 before falling to Number 66 the following week, then dropping out of the chart altogether.

On 6 July 2008, Gates starred in the line-up for &quot;A Spoonful of Stiles &amp; Drewe&quot;, a charity fundraiser to celebrate 25 years of musical theatre composers George Stiles and Anthony Drewe. Gates played the part of Robbie in a preview of a new musical &quot;Soho Cinders&quot; and features on the album.

In 2008, Gates appeared on ITV1&#x27;s &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; with skating partner Maria Filippov, finishing fourth, losing a place in the final to Zaraah Abrahams and dancing partner Fred Palascak. 

During his time working with Judie Tzuke, Gates also co-wrote the song &quot;Christmas and I&#x27;m Home&quot; with her. It was first premiered live by Gates in 2004 in Bradford, and Tzuke recorded the song with pianist Haim Cotton. Tzuke&#x27;s version was released commercially in November 2008, as a charity single download and as a physical CD single sold exclusively through the CD Baby website.

In 2009, Gates was cast in the lead role in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; at the Adelphi Theatre, London. Taking over the role from Lee Mead, Gates began the role on 7 February 2009 and continued to play the part until the final performance on 30 May 2009.

Gates performed at the charity event &quot;Broadway To West End by Special Arrangement&quot; on 4 October 2009 at the Drury Lane Theatre, singing &quot;Why God, Why?&quot; as a solo and &quot;The Last Night of the World&quot; as a duet with Ima Castro. Both songs come from the musical &quot;Miss Saigon&quot;. The event was to honour the work of orchestrator William David Brohm and raised funds for CLIC Sargent Cancer care.

In June 2009, it was announced that Gates was joining the cast of the International 25th Anniversary World Tour production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; in the role of Marius. Gates had been offered the choice of playing Marius in London&#x27;s West End or in the anniversary tour, but opted for the tour as it was a new production and there was the opportunity to make the part his own. A live cast recording, &quot;Les Misérables Live&quot;, was recorded in Manchester and released as a double album in September 2010 on the label First Night Records.

In December 2009, Gates took part in ITV&#x27;s &quot;All Star Family Fortunes&quot;, along with his then wife Suzanne, mum Wendy, sister Nicola and best friend Matt, and won £30,000 for The Bobby Moore Fund for bowel cancer. Other TV and sporting activities for charity have included an appearance on Sky&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Lyrics!&quot; and ITV&#x27;s &quot;Mr. and Mrs.&quot; again for the Bobby Moore Fund and various events for the Rhys Daniels Trust.

=== 2010–2012: &quot;Les Miserables&quot;, documentary, and &quot;Loserville&quot; ===
Following the final performance of the anniversary tour at The Barbican, London, in October 2010, Gates joined the West End production of &quot;Les Misérables&quot; at Queen&#x27;s Theatre where he continued to play the part of Marius until June 2011.

Gates took a break from musical theatre to work on other projects, including writing a new album, but planned to return in March 2012, taking the part of Claude in the UK touring production of &quot;Hair&quot; It was later announced that the musical would not proceed as efforts to rescue the tour following the bankruptcy of the original production company had failed.

In January 2012, Gates featured in a one night only charity production of &quot;Children of Eden&quot; playing the part of Cain/Japeth in aid of Crohn&#x27;s disease.

A documentary, &quot;Stop My Stutter&quot;, was broadcast on BBC Three in February 2012. In the documentary, Gates worked with five young men and women who&#x27;ve stammered since childhood. Speaking of the documentary, he said &quot;Hopefully this documentary will give people an insight into something that most take for granted – speaking!&quot;

Instead, Gates played Eddie in the new musical &quot;Loserville&quot; at the West Yorkshire Playhouse in 2012. The musical was written by Busted&#x27;s James Bourne and Elliot Davis. Along with Gates, the cast also included &quot;EastEnders&quot; Aaron Sidwell and Lil&#x27; Chris.

In July 2012, Gates took over the role of Warner in the UK tour of the musical &quot;Legally Blonde&quot;.

===2013–2017: &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;, Greatest Hits, and &quot;Footloose&quot;===
In early 2013 he toured in the musical &quot;Boogie Nights&quot;, with members of The Osmonds, Louise Lytton, Shane Ritchie, Chico &amp; Andy Abraham.

On 27 December 2013, it was announced that Gates, along with Dane Bowers (from Another Level), Kenzie (from Blazin&#x27; Squad), Adam Rickitt, and Kavana would be forming a &quot;supergroup&quot; called 5th Story for the ITV2 documentary &quot;The Big Reunion&quot;. Following the programme, the newly formed group toured in October 2014 as part of the Big Reunion Boyband Tour.

In January 2014, Gates again took part in &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; for the final series, partnered this time by Brianne Delcourt. That year&#x27;s show consisted of former series champions and public favourites. He finished in 7th place, and went on to appear in the very last &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot; tour in March and April 2014.

A compilation album, &quot;The Very Best of Gareth Gates&quot;, was released by Sony Music in March 2014. It includes the hit singles from his first two albums and two other tracks from his first album (all of which are owned by Sony Music), plus three brand new acoustic tracks which he recorded with his guitarist Pete Rinaldi. The album failed to chart.

In 2016, Gates starred as Willard in a national tour of &quot;Footloose&quot;. He took several breaks during the tour, and during his absences his part was played by Lee Brennan.

During spring 2017, Gates appeared in Robin Hood Easter Panto at various locations within the United Kingdom.

===2022–present: Festival headlining and &quot;Celebrity SAS&quot;===
In June 2022, Gates hosted a Bradford-based Jubilee party, &quot;Big 80s Festival&quot;, in celebration of the Queen&#x27;s seventieth year on the throne. Gates said, &quot;I speak to people in Bradford. To see a huge act, they often have to go to a different city. Whether that’s over to Manchester, Leeds or even Birmingham. To bring all these acts to Bradford, we are trying to do something where we are now their go-to events company to see world class acts. Our main aim is make sure the people of Bradford don’t have to travel and they can get all these shows on their doorstep.&quot;

On 2 July 2022, Gates headlined &quot;Dartford Pride&quot;.

Gates won the 2023 edition of British reality TV show &quot;&quot;, beating Member of Parliament Matt Hancock and model Danielle Lloyd in the final.

==Personal life==
Gates lived in Chiswick, West London, with wife Suzanne Gates (née Mole) until their split in 2012. The couple met when she was a dancer at the Record of the Year awards in 2002, which Gates won for &quot;Unchained Melody&quot;. In October 2006, &quot;The People&quot; newspaper incorrectly reported that they had secretly married. However, Gates and Mole got engaged on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2007 and were married on 18 July 2008 in a private ceremony for family and friends. The couple had a daughter on 6 April 2009.

Gates met Faye Brookes in 2012 when they starred together in &quot;Legally Blonde: The Musical&quot;, shortly before he split from his wife. Gates and Brookes ended their relationship in 2019. As of 2023, Gates is in a relationship with stage actress Allana Taylor.

In 2009, it was reported that Gates had made an estimated £6.5 million during his career to date. The &quot;Irish Independent&quot; newspaper reported that Gates was one of a number of celebrities with investments in the company Ingenious Media, which backed a number of films, including &quot;Avatar&quot; and &quot;X-Men Origins: Wolverine&quot;.

===Charitable causes===
On 7 September 2008, Gates played for England against The Rest of the World in Soccer Aid 2008 at Wembley in aid of UNICEF.

Gates qualified as a speech coach and latterly as a course instructor with the McGuire Programme where he helps those with stammers similar to his own. He co-led his first full course in February 2005 and in August 2006 he instructed his first course single-handedly in Galway, Ireland. He led his second at Bournemouth in November 2006.
Gates spoke to MPs including David Amess, Robert Buckland, and Steve Brine at the Palace of Westminster as part of a briefing on communication disability hosted by the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and the Centre for Social Justice. Gates said, &quot;By speaking today I hope to shed light on the issues that surround speech and language difficulties. In particular, through my own experiences, I want to explain how the inability to converse and communicate drastically shapes and moulds people&#x27;s lives. It determines the sort of people they become and the paths they follow.&quot; On 18 October 2011, his work as an ambassador, raising awareness of the issues surrounding speech difficulties, was recognised at the Giving Voice Awards Ceremony.

In 2012, Gates, alongside Jonathan Wilkes, then-wife Suzanne and Wilkes&#x27; wife Nikki, set up the Gates and Wilkes Academy of Performing Arts for people from the ages 5–18, in his home town of Bradford. Gates and Wilkes opened a second academy in Milton Keynes. During an interview with BBC Radio Leeds on 16 June 2012, Gates announced plans to open a further academy in Leeds. After the separation from his wife, the partnership was broken up, though Gates now has three performing arts academies of his own in Yorkshire.

Gates is a patron of the HIV/AIDS charity Body and Soul and of The Bobby Moore Fund, which supports research into bowel cancer. He took part in the 2009 Cosmo Everyman campaign to raise awareness of prostate and testicular cancer.

In 2020, Gates presented the BBC Lifeline Appeal for the British Stammering Association.

<doc id="264508" wikidata="Q6196281" url="?curid=264508" title="Jim Lampley">
<text>James Lampley (born April 8, 1949) is an American sportscaster, news anchor, film producer, and restaurant owner. He is best known as a blow-by-blow announcer on &quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot; for 30 years. He covered a record 14 Olympic Games on U.S. television, most recently the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China.

==Early life and career==
Lampley was born in Hendersonville, North Carolina, and after the sixth grade was raised in Miami, Florida. His father died when he was five, and his mother immersed him in sports to make up for what she felt his father would have done. In 1971, he graduated from the University of North Carolina where he majored in English and earned a master’s degree from UNC’s Department of Radio, Television and Motion Pictures.

==Broadcast network television==

===ABC Sports===
In 1974, while in graduate school, he was chosen along with Don Tollefson in what ABC called a &quot;talent hunt&quot;. ABC executives thought that Lampley&#x27;s youthful looks would make him endearing to the college crowds they looked to attract for their college football games. At ABC, he covered such events as Major League Baseball and college basketball games, the 1986 and 1987 Indianapolis 500, the 1977 Monon Bell game between DePauw University and Wabash College, five Olympics, as well as the program &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot;.

From 1983 to 1985, he was the studio host of ABC broadcasts of the United States Football League (USFL), a spring league that featured stars such as Herschel Walker, Jim Kelly, Steve Young and Reggie White.

On July 4, 1984, with Sam Posey alongside, he called the NASCAR Firecracker 400, and interviewed President Ronald Reagan during the winner&#x27;s interview with race winner Richard Petty.

In 1985, Lampley along with Al Michaels served as anchors for ABC&#x27;s coverage of Super Bowl XIX, the first Super Bowl that ABC televised. After the game, Lampley presided over the presentation ceremony for the trophy.

===KCBS===
In 1987, Lampley moved to CBS. At CBS, he took over duties as co-anchor on the daily news show in Los Angeles, and also was a correspondent. That same year, he began working for HBO, covering boxing and HBO&#x27;s annual telecast of the Wimbledon Championships. He also attended the Albertville Olympics in 1992, as a news anchor for KCBS-TV.

===NBC Sports===
In 1992, Lampley moved to NBC, where he helped cover the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, 1993 Ryder Cup, and the 1996 Atlanta Olympics. In 1993, Lampley took over studio hosting duties for Bob Costas on &quot;The NFL on NBC&quot;. Lampley moved to play-by-play duties for NBC&#x27;s NFL telecasts the following year and was later replaced by Greg Gumbel. While with &quot;NFL on NBC&quot;, he was slated to join Jim Laslavic as the #8 announcing team in 1997 during Week 9&#x27;s Tennessee Oilers-Arizona Cardinals game; however, he was not placed in the lineup at all. In 1995, he began working at the &quot;Real Sports with Bryant Gumbel&quot; HBO series. In 1998, he covered the Nagano Olympics and the Goodwill Games for Turner, and in 2000, he covered the Sydney Olympics, again for NBC.

In 2004, Lampley was the daytime anchor for NBC&#x27;s Olympics coverage for the 2004 Summer Olympics, as well as anchoring the USA Network&#x27;s coverage of the Games. In 2006, Lampley served as a central correspondent for the 2006 Winter Olympics which aired on the networks of NBC Universal. Torino 2006 was the 13th Olympics Lampley covered, surpassing the record set by America&#x27;s original voice of the Olympics, Jim McKay. Lampley was again called upon to anchor for the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing, China, Lampley&#x27;s 14th Games. The 2010 Winter Olympics was the first time since the 1980 Summer Olympics that he didn&#x27;t cover. Al Michaels served as the daytime host of the 2010 Olympics on NBC. Lampley also did not cover the 2012 Summer Olympics either in which Michaels also served as the daytime host.

==&quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot;==
Fans may best know Lampley for his work on &quot;HBO World Championship Boxing&quot;, &quot;Boxing After Dark&quot;, and on the HBO pay-per-view telecasts from March 1988 until December 2018, when HBO announced that they would drop the boxing program. As blow by blow announcer, he called some of boxing&#x27;s most famous moments, such as Thunder Meets Lightning, when Julio César Chávez saved himself from a decision defeat by knocking out Meldrick Taylor (who was leading the fight on two of the three official scorecards) with only two seconds to go in the last round, and James &quot;Buster&quot; Douglas&#x27;s upset of Mike Tyson for the world heavyweight championship. Other highlights in his career were the first Riddick Bowe-Andrew Golota fight at Madison Square Garden, where a riot occurred following the &quot;Foul Pole&#x27;s&quot; disqualification for low blows, and the famous &quot;It happened...IT HAPPENED!&quot; call of George Foreman&#x27;s miracle comeback against then heavyweight champion Michael Moorer when a straight right ended Moorer&#x27;s reign.

Lampley also hosted a series called &quot;Legendary Nights&quot; in 12 installments in honor of HBO&#x27;s three decades covering boxing in 2004, recounting 12 memorable fights broadcast on HBO in that timespan.

Lampley later wrote, hosted, and executive produced his own studio boxing news show, &quot;The Fight Game with Jim Lampley&quot; on HBO.

<text>Ian Watkins (born 8 May 1976), known by his stage name H, is a Welsh singer and actor. He is a member of the British pop group Steps.

In 2020 he competed in the twelfth series of the British television series &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;.

==Career==

===Steps===

Before he joined Steps, Watkins worked as a Bluecoat at Pontins, then later as a Redcoat at Butlin&#x27;s.

In May 1997, Watkins became a member of the British pop group Steps. Steps achieved a series of charting singles between 1997 and 2001 including two number-one singles in the UK, two number-one albums in the UK, 14 consecutive top 5 singles in the UK, and a string of hits throughout Europe. The group has sold over 20 million records worldwide, in addition to acquiring a BRIT Award nomination in 1999.

Steps reformed in May 2011 for a four-part documentary series on Sky Living titled &quot;Steps: Reunion&quot;. The series started airing on 28 September, following an announcement of a second greatest hits album, &quot;The Ultimate Collection&quot;, that was released on 10 October 2011. The album entered the charts at number one, becoming the band&#x27;s third album to achieve this feat. The second series of &quot;Steps: Reunion&quot; titled &quot;Steps: On the Road Again&quot; aired on Sky Living in April 2012; the series followed the band as they embarked on their sellout 22-date UK tour. On 24 September 2012, the group confirmed they would release their fourth studio album &quot;Light Up The World&quot; on 12 November 2012, alongside a six-date Christmas tour, starting from 30 November and ending on 5 December. The group reformed for a second time on 1 January 2017 in celebration of their 20th anniversary, and later announced their fifth studio album &quot;Tears on the Dancefloor&quot;, which was released in April 2017 and entered the charts at number 2. On 5 March 2017, the group confirmed the release of the new album, alongside its lead single, &quot;Scared of the Dark&quot;, and a 22-date tour, Party on the Dancefloor. A deluxe edition of the album, titled &quot;Tears on the Dancefloor: Crying at the Disco&quot;, was released on 27 October.

In November 2017, Faye Tozer announced that the reunion was no longer just a 20th-anniversary celebration and that the group intended to continue after their 2018 Summer of Steps tour. In April 2018, Claire Richards announced that following their summer tour, they would begin work on their sixth studio album. In February 2019, Richards announced the group would begin recording their next album during the summer months.

On 7 September 2020, via their social media accounts, Steps announced the release date of their album entitled &quot;What the Future Holds&quot;. The album was released on 27 November of the same year, with pre-orders available from 8 September. The next day, they confirmed a new 14-date UK tour (with special guest Sophie Ellis-Bextor) starting in November 2021. The first single from the album was &quot;What the Future Holds&quot;, written by Greg Kurstin and Sia and released on 9 September 2020. It was followed by &quot;Something in Your Eyes&quot; on 27 October 2020. &quot;To the Beat of My Heart&quot; was released as the album&#x27;s third single in January 2021.

The first single of &quot;What the Future Holds Pt. 2&quot; was confirmed as a reworked version of &quot;Heartbreak in This City&quot; featuring Michelle Visage.

===H and Claire===

After Steps split in 2001, Watkins formed a duo, H &amp; Claire, with fellow ex-Steps member Claire Richards. They released three singles and an album.

===Musical theatre===
After departing from H &amp; Claire, he then decided to take a musical theatre course at the Royal Academy of Music. While taking the course he also appeared in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; and was filmed for a reality TV series, &quot;H-side Story&quot;, which followed him as he tried to make a new career as an actor. Watkins performed at Preston&#x27;s Charter Theatre in the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; in the role of Buttons. In summer 2007, he performed in the West End version of &quot;Fame&quot;. During Christmas 2007, he reprised his role as Buttons in the pantomime &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the Grimsby Auditorium. In July 2008, he played the Child Catcher in the UK tour of the musical &quot;Chitty Chitty Bang Bang&quot; at the Wales Millennium Centre in Cardiff Bay. He also played the role of &#x27;Silly Billy&#x27; in pantomime &quot;Jack &amp; The Beanstalk&quot; at the Southport Theatre from 10 December 2009 to 3 January 2010. Christmas 2010 saw his return to Grimsby as he performed in the pantomime &quot;Beauty and the Beast&quot;, playing the part of Muddles. In 2013, Watkins announced that he was returning to his role as Joseph in &quot;Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat&quot; in June on the UK National Tour. The following year he played Prince Charming in the panto Snow White and the Seven Dwarves at the Hazlitt Theatre, Maidstone.

===Television===
In June 2006, Watkins appeared in a special week of episodes of the BBC Radio Drama &quot;Silver Street&quot; on the BBC Asian Network. He played the character of former soldier Dave in episodes set in the Welsh countryside. In November 2006, Watkins featured on the BBC Children in Need &quot;Celebrity Scissorhands&quot; show, where Michelle cut his hair. Watkins was the ninth housemate to enter the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house on 3 January 2007. He finished in fourth place. In April 2007, Watkins starred as the hidden celebrity in an episode of the CBBC series &quot;Hider in the House&quot;. On 11 March 2008, Watkins presented a documentary about growing up gay in Wales, shown on BBC Wales. While filming for this, Watkins interviewed Christian Voice leader Stephen Green. During the interview, Green compared him to Jeffrey Dahmer.

In December 2008, Watkins was a contestant in &quot;Bargain Hunt Famous Finds&quot; and partnered with Connie Fisher. Watkins appeared on &quot;Skins&quot;, episode 2 of series 4. He also appeared in the Living TV series &quot;Party Wars&quot; in 2010. In February 2013, along with three other celebrities, Watkins was a contestant in the celebrity special of the ITV quiz show &quot;The Chase&quot;. In 2014, he appeared as one of the celebrities challenged to learn Welsh in a week on the S4C series &quot;Cariad@Iaith&quot;.

In 2019 he played a fictional version of himself in the comedy murder mystery &quot;Dial M for Middlesbrough&quot;.

In 2020, Watkins competed in the twelfth series of the ITV series &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;. He was the first celebrity in the history of the series to compete within a same sex couple, with professional partner Matt Evers.

In 2024, comedian and television presenter Joe Lycett created a fake news story about Watkins being due to be honoured with an 8-foot statue in Cowbridge, as part of his Channel 4 variety show &quot;Late Night Lycett&quot;.

===Steps reunion===

In 2009, Lee Latchford-Evans hinted that a future reunion was possible, but that &quot;it isn&#x27;t the right time right now&quot;. In 2011, it was announced that Steps would be reuniting for a four-part Sky Living documentary, depicting their split and the intermittent years. The band would also release their &quot;Ultimate Collection&quot;, as well as potential new material.

In an interview with Digital Spy on 20 September 2011, Steps said that they believed there might still be a gap in the market for their brand of &quot;happy pop&quot;. Lisa Scott-Lee said: &quot;Times have changed, but we are in a recession and Steps&#x27; music was very light-hearted and fun, so there could be a place for that in today&#x27;s society ... What else is interesting is that there aren&#x27;t any boy/girl pop groups out there at the moment&quot;.

==Local politics==
In May 2023, Watkins was elected as an Independent town councillor in Cowbridge with Llanblethian Town Council.

==Personal life==
Watkins was born in Llwynypia, Mid Glamorgan, Wales, on 8 May 1976. From 1994 to 1995 he attended Pontypridd College and took a foundation course in Fine Art &amp; Design.

On 3 January 2007, Watkins came out as gay in an interview with &quot;The Sun&quot; newspaper. His interview was published on the day he entered the &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; house. During his tenure with Steps, Watkins was involved in a relationship with the group&#x27;s manager, Tim Byrne. Watkins was in a relationship with Craig Ryder from 2007 until November 2017. In 2016, they became fathers to twin sons, born via a surrogate. Watkins has been in a relationship with dancer-turned-tour-manager Tom Hope. Watkins was named on the &quot;Wales Online&quot; 2017 Pinc List of leading Welsh LGBT figures. In December 2024 Watkins and Hope were featured on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Escape to the Country&quot;.

===Misidentification===
In November 2013, it was reported that Watkins had been receiving hate mail through Twitter from people confusing him with Lostprophets singer of the same name Ian Watkins who had recently pleaded guilty to sex offences involving children. H received a public apology in court from E! Entertainment Television for having used his photo to illustrate a story about the Lostprophets singer. After the misidentification, H was said to be pursuing legal action after his image appeared next to stories about the other Ian Watkins&#x27; crimes through searches on Google News.

<text>Trial by ordeal was an ancient judicial practice by which the guilt or innocence of the accused (called a &quot;proband&quot;) was determined by subjecting them to a painful, or at least an unpleasant, usually dangerous experience. 
In medieval Europe, like trial by combat, trial by ordeal, such as cruentation, was sometimes considered a &quot;judgement of God&quot; (, ): a procedure based on the premise that God would help the innocent by performing a miracle on their behalf. The practice has much earlier roots, attested to as far back as the Code of Hammurabi and the Code of Ur-Nammu.

In pre-industrial society, the ordeal typically ranked along with the oath and witness accounts as the central means by which to reach a judicial verdict. Indeed, the term &quot;ordeal&quot;, Old English &quot;ordǣl&quot;, has the meaning of &quot;judgment, verdict&quot; from Proto-West Germanic uʀdailī (see , ), ultimately from Proto-Germanic &quot;*uzdailiją&quot; &quot;that which is dealt out&quot;.

Priestly cooperation in trials by fire and water was forbidden by Pope Innocent III at the Fourth Council of the Lateran of 1215 and replaced by compurgation. Trials by ordeal became rarer over the Late Middle Ages, but the practice was not discontinued until the 16th century. Certain trials by ordeal would continue to be used into the 17th century in witch-hunts.

==Types of ordeals==

===By combat===

Ordeal by combat took place between two parties in a dispute, either two individuals, or between an individual and a government or other organization. They, or, under certain conditions, a designated &quot;champion&quot; acting on their behalf, would fight, and the loser of the fight or the party represented by the losing champion was deemed guilty or liable. Champions could be used by one or both parties in an individual versus individual dispute, and could represent the individual in a trial by an organization; an organization or state government by its nature had to be represented by a single combatant selected as champion, although there are numerous cases of high-ranking nobility, state officials and even monarchs volunteering to serve as champion. Combat between groups of representatives was less common but still occurred.

A notable case was that of Gero, Count of Alsleben, whose daughter married Siegfried II, Count of Stade.

===By fire===

Ordeal by fire was one form of torture. The ordeal by fire has been recorded as having been conducted throughout Europe, as well as in Eastern societies, such as ancient India and Iran. In Europe, the ordeal typically required that the accused walk a certain distance, usually or a certain number of paces, usually three, over red-hot plowshares or holding a red-hot iron. Innocence was sometimes established by a complete lack of injury, but it was more common for the wound to be bandaged and re-examined three days later by a priest. It would either be pronounced that God had intervened to heal the wound, or that it was festering, in which case the suspect would be exiled or put to death. Ordeal by fire could also include methods where the accused was made to pass through flames, with evidence of such methods being mainly found outside Western Europe.

==== In Europe ====
One famous story about the ordeal of plowshares concerns the English King Edward the Confessor&#x27;s mother, Emma of Normandy. According to a legend, she was accused of adultery with Bishop Ælfwine of Winchester but proved her innocence by walking barefoot unharmed over red-hot plowshares.

During the First Crusade, the French mystic Peter Bartholomew allegedly went through the ordeal by fire in 1099 by his own choice to disprove a charge that his claimed discovery of the Holy Lance was fraudulent. He died as a result of his injuries.

Trial by ordeal was adopted in the 13th century by the Byzantine successor states the Empire of Nicaea and the Despotate of Epirus; Michael Angold speculates this legal innovation was most likely through &quot;the numerous western mercenaries in Byzantine service both before and after 1204.&quot; It was used to prove the innocence of the accused in cases of treason and use of magic to affect the health of the emperor. The most famous case where this was employed was when Michael Palaiologos was accused of treason: he avoided enduring the red-iron by saying he would only hold it if the Metropolitan Phokas of Philadelphia could take the iron from the altar with his own hands and hand it to him. However, the Byzantines viewed trial by ordeal with disgust and considered it a barbarian innovation at odds with Byzantine law and ecclesiastical canons. Angold notes, &quot;Its abolition by Michael Palaiologos was universally acclaimed.&quot;

In 1498, Dominican friar Girolamo Savonarola, the leader of a reform movement in Florence who claimed apocalyptic prophetic visions, attempted to prove the divine sanction of his mission by undergoing a trial by fire. The first of its kind in over 400 years, the trial was a fiasco for Savonarola, since a sudden rain doused the flames, canceling the event and taken by onlookers as a sign from God against him. The Inquisition arrested him shortly thereafter, with Savonarola convicted of heresy and hanged at the Piazza della Signoria in Florence.

==== In Persia ====
Ordeal by fire () was also used for judiciary purposes in ancient Iran. Persons accused of cheating in contracts or lying might be asked to prove their innocence by ordeal of fire as an ultimate test. Two examples of such an ordeal include the accused having to pass through fire, or having molten metal poured on their chest. There were about 30 of these kinds of fiery tests in all. If the accused died, they were held to have been guilty; if survived, they were innocent, having been protected by Mithra and the other gods. The most simple form of such ordeals required the accused to take an oath, then drink a potion of sulfur (, , ). It was believed that fire had an association with truth and hence with asha.

==== In India ====
In ancient India, the trial by fire was known as &quot;agnipariksha&quot;, in which Agni, the Fire God, would be invoked by a priest using mantras. After the invocation, a pyre would be built and lit, and the accused would be asked to sit on it. According to Hindu mythology, the Fire God would preserve the accused if they were innocent, if not, they would be burned to ashes.

==== In Cambodia ====
In 13th-century Angkor, according to a book written by a visiting Chinese official, trial by ordeal was a common solution to disputes. Members of two feuding families were ordered to sit in separate stone pagodas for up to four days, and it was believed that only the family in the wrong would get sick. Suspected thieves were tried by boiling oil. 

===By boiling oil===
Trial by boiling oil has also been practiced in villages in certain parts of West Africa, such as Togo. There are two primary versions of this trial. In one, the accused parties are ordered to retrieve an item from a container of boiling oil, with those who refuse the task being found guilty. In the other, both the accused and the accuser have to retrieve an item from boiling oil, with the person or persons whose hand remains unscathed being declared innocent.

===By water===
There were different types of trials by water: trial by hot water and trial by cold water.

====Hot water including trial by combat ====
First mentioned in the 6th-century &quot;Salic law&quot;, the ordeal of hot water required the accused to dip their hand into a kettle or pot of boiling water (sometimes oil or lead was used instead) and retrieve a stone. Assessment of the injury was similar to that of the fire ordeal. An early (non-judicial) example of the test was described by Bishop Gregory of Tours in the late 6th century. He describes how a Catholic saint, Hyacinth, bested an Arian rival by plucking a stone from a boiling cauldron. Gregory said that it took Hyacinth about an hour to complete the task (because the waters were bubbling so ferociously), but he was pleased to record that when the heretic tried, he had the skin boiled off up to his elbow.

Legal texts from the reign of King Athelstan (Lived: – 27 October 939, Ruled: 924 – 939) provide some of the most elaborate royal regulations for the use of the ordeal in Anglo-Saxon England, though the period&#x27;s fullest account of ordeal practices is found in an anonymous legal text written sometime in the 10th century. According to this text, usually given the title &quot;Ordal&quot;, the water had to be close to boiling temperature, and the depth from which the stone had to be retrieved was up to the wrist for a &#x27;one-fold&#x27; ordeal and up to the elbow for a &#x27;three-fold&#x27; ordeal. The distinction between the one-fold and three-fold ordeal appears to be based on the severity of the crime, with the threefold ordeal being prescribed for more severe offences such as treachery or for notorious criminals. The ordeal would take place in a church, with several in attendance, purified and praying to God to reveal the truth. Afterwards, the hand was bound and examined after three days to see whether it was healing or festering.

This was still an isolated practice in remote 12th-century Catholic churches. A suspect would place their hand in the boiling water. If after three days God had not healed their wounds, the suspect was guilty of the crime.

====Cold water====
The ordeal of cold water has a precedent in the 13th law of the Code of Ur-Nammu (the oldest known surviving code of laws) and the second law of the Code of Hammurabi. Under the Code of Ur-Nammu, a man who was accused of what some scholars have translated as &quot;sorcery&quot; was to undergo ordeal by water. If the man were proven innocent through this ordeal, the accuser was obligated to pay three shekels to the man who underwent judgment. The Code of Hammurabi dictated that, if a man was accused of a matter by another, the accused was to leap into a river. If the accused man survived this ordeal, the accused was to be acquitted. If the accused was found innocent by this ordeal, the accuser was to be put to death and the accused man was to take possession of the then-deceased accuser&#x27;s house. The Code of Hammurabi also stated that if a woman is accused of adultery she &quot;will leap into the river-god for her husband.&quot; However, it is unclear if innocence is proved by drowning or surviving.

An ordeal by cold water is mentioned in the Vishnu Smrti, which is one of the texts of the Dharmaśāstra.

The practice was also set out in Salic law but was abolished by Emperor Louis the Pious in 829. The practice reappeared in the Late Middle Ages: in the &quot;Dreieicher Wildbann&quot; of 1338, a man accused of poaching was to be submerged in a barrel three times and to be considered innocent if he sank, and guilty if he floated.

====Witch-hunts in Europe====
Ordeal by water was associated with the witch-hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries, although an inverse of most trials by ordeal; if the accused sank, they were considered innocent, whereas if they floated, this indicated witchcraft. The ordeal would be conducted with a rope holding the subject so that the person being tested could be retrieved following the trial. A witch trial including this ordeal took place in Szeged, Hungary as late as 1728.

Demonologists varied in their explanations as to why trial by water would be effective, although spiritual explanations were most common. Some argued that witches floated because they had renounced baptism when entering the Devil&#x27;s service. King James VI of Scotland claimed in his &quot;Daemonologie&quot; that water was so pure an element that it repelled the guilty. Jacob Rickius claimed that witches were supernaturally light and recommended weighing them as an alternative to dunking them; this procedure and its status as an alternative to dunking were parodied in the 1975 British film &quot;Monty Python and the Holy Grail&quot;.

===By cross===
The ordeal of the cross was apparently introduced in the Early Middle Ages in an attempt to discourage judicial duels among Germanic peoples. As with judicial duels, and unlike most other ordeals, the accuser had to undergo the ordeal together with the accused. They stood on either side of a cross and stretched out their hands horizontally. The first one to lower their arms lost. This ordeal was prescribed by Charlemagne in 779 and again in 806. A capitulary of Louis the Pious in 819 and a decree of Lothar I, recorded in 876, abolished the ordeal so as to avoid the mockery of Christ.

===By ingestion===

Franconian law prescribed that an accused was to be given dry bread and cheese blessed by a priest. If the accused choked on the food, they were considered guilty. This was transformed into the ordeal of the Eucharist (trial by sacrament) mentioned by Regino of Prüm ca. 900:AD; the accused was to take the oath of innocence. It was believed that if the oath had been false, the person would die within the same year.

Numbers 5:12–27 prescribes that a woman suspected of adultery should be made to swallow &quot;the bitter water that causeth the curse&quot; by the priest in order to determine her guilt. The accused would be condemned only if &#x27;her belly shall swell and her thigh shall rot&#x27;. One writer has recently argued that the procedure has a rational basis, envisioning punishment only upon clear proof of pregnancy (a swelling belly) or venereal disease (a rotting thigh). Other scholars think an abortifacient a more likely explanation; if the holy water causes miscarriage, it is proof of guilt). The descriptor “bitter” in the original Hebrew is written as “mārîm” which can also be understood as “poison”. However, it is unclear if the water actually contains any actual poison.
Some cultures, such as the Efik Uburutu people of present-day Nigeria, would administer the poisonous Calabar bean (&quot;Physostigma venenosum&quot;, known as &quot;esere&quot; in Efik), which contains physostigmine, in an attempt to detect guilt. A defendant who vomited up the bean was innocent. A defendant who became ill or died was considered guilty.

Residents of Madagascar could accuse one another of various crimes, including theft, Christianity, and especially witchcraft, for which the ordeal of tangena (&quot;Cerbera manghas&quot;) was routinely obligatory. In the 1820s, ingestion of the poisonous nut caused about 1000 deaths annually. This average rose to around 3000 annual deaths between 1828 and 1861.

Ancient Liberian cultures practiced a tradition known as sassywood. In it, a poisonous brew of erythrophleine, extracted from the bark of the &quot;Ordeal Tree&quot; (erythrophleum suaveolens), was administered to the defendant. While it has largely been outlawed, the practice is still in sporadic use by local communities.

In Africa Cassaine has been, and is still, used as an ordeal poison. 

The &quot;penalty of the peach&quot; was an ancient ordeal that involved peach pits or their extracts. The pits contain amygdalin, which is metabolized into cyanide.

In early modern Europe, the Mass was used as a form of ordeal by ingestion: a suspected party was forced to take the Eucharist because they would be eternally damned if they were guilty, and thus their unwillingness to take the test would give an indication of their guilt.

===By turf===
An Icelandic ordeal tradition involves the accused walking under a piece of turf. If the turf falls on the accused&#x27;s head, the accused person is pronounced guilty.

=== The ordeal of bleeding (Bier-Right) (Cruentation) ===

This ordeal took place when there was a murder. The person who was charged with the murder is to approach the dead body from the murder. If the corpse starts to bleed then the case is proven. in other cases the wounds of the victim would start to bleed “...the blood cry as a divinely revealed piece of legal evidence, extracted through irrepressible force and expressed through the active demonstration of the corpse ‘bleeding afresh.’”

==English common law==
The ordeals of fire and water in England likely have their origin in Frankish tradition, as the earliest mention of the ordeal of the cauldron is in the first recension of the Salic Law in 510. Trial by cauldron was an ancient Frankish custom used against both freedmen and slaves in cases of theft, false witness and contempt of court, where the accused was made to plunge their right hand into a boiling cauldron and pull out a ring. As Frankish influence spread throughout Europe, ordeal by cauldron spread to neighboring societies.

The earliest references of ordeal by cauldron in the British Isles occurs in Irish law in the seventh century, but it is unlikely that this tradition shares roots with the Frankish tradition that is likely the source of trial by fire and water among the Anglo-Saxons and later the Normans in England. The laws of Ine, King of the West Saxons, produced around 690, contains the earliest reference to ordeal in Anglo-Saxon law; however, this is the last and only mention of ordeal in Anglo-Saxon England until the 10th century.

After the Conquest of 1066, the Old English customs of proof were repeated anew and in more detailed fashion by the Normans, but the only notable innovation of the ordeal by the conquerors was the introduction of the trial by battle. There were, however, minor conflicts between the customs of the Anglo-Saxons and the customs of the Normans that were typically resolved in ways that favored the Normans. In a famous story from Eadmer&#x27;s &quot;Historia novorum in Anglia&quot;, William Rufus expresses skepticism about the ordeal after 50 men accused of forest offenses were exonerated by the ordeal of hot iron. In this story, Rufus states that he will take judgment from God&#x27;s hands into his own. However, this skepticism was not universally shared by the intellectuals of the day, and Eadmer depicts Rufus as irreligious for rejecting the legitimacy of the ordeal.

The use of the ordeal in medieval England was very sensitive to status and reputation in the community. The laws of Canute distinguish between &quot;men of good repute&quot; who were able to clear themselves by their own oath, &quot;untrustworthy men&quot; who required compurgators, and untrustworthy men who cannot find compurgators who must go to the ordeal. One of the laws of Ethelred the Unready declared that untrustworthy men were to be sent to the triple ordeal, that is, an ordeal of hot iron where the iron is three times heavier than that used in the simple ordeal, unless his lord and two other knights swear that he has not been accused of a crime recently, in which case he would be sent to an ordinary ordeal of hot iron.

Unlike other European societies, the English rarely employed the ordeal in non-criminal proceedings. The mandatory use of the ordeal in certain criminal proceedings appears to date from the Assize of Clarendon in 1166. Prior to then, compurgation was the most usual method of proof, and the ordeal was used in cases where there was some presumption of guilt against the accused or when the accused was bound to fail in compurgation. A distinction was made between those accused &quot;fama publica&quot; (by public outcry) and those accused on the basis of specific facts. Those accused &quot;fama publica&quot; were able to exculpate themselves by means of compurgation, whereas those accused on the basis of specific facts and those who were thought to have bad character were made to undergo the ordeal.

The Assize of Clarendon declared that all those said by a jury of presentment to be &quot;accused or notoriously suspect&quot; of robbery, thievery, or murder or of receiving anyone who had committed such a wrong were to be put to the ordeal of water. These juries of presentment were the hundred juries and vills, and these groups, in effect, made the intermediate decision of whether an accused person would face the more final judgment of the ordeal. These bodies rendered &quot;verdicts&quot; of either suspected or not suspected. In cases where the defendant was accused on the basis of one or more specific facts, the defendant was sent to the ordeal upon the verdict of the hundred jury alone. In cases where the defendant was accused &quot;fama publica&quot;, the agreement of the hundred jurors and the vills as to the defendant&#x27;s suspicion was required to send him to the ordeal. However, the intermediate accusation of the juries could still be considered final in some sense as any person who was accused of murder by the juries was required to leave the realm even if he was exonerated by the ordeal.

In 1215, clergy were forbidden to participate in ordeals by the Fourth Lateran Council. The English plea rolls contain no cases of trial by ordeal after 1219, when Henry III recognized its abolition.

== Suppression ==

Popes were generally opposed to ordeals, although there are some apocryphal accounts describing their cooperation with the practice. At first there was no general decree against ordeals, and they were only declared unlawful in individual cases. Eventually Pope Innocent III in Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215) promulgated a canon forbidding blessing of participants before ordeals. This decision was followed by further prohibitions by synods in thirteenth and fourteenth centuries. The Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II (1194–1250) was the first king who explicitly outlawed trials by ordeal as they were considered &quot;irrational&quot; (Constitutions of Melfi). In England, things started to change with King Henry III (1220).

From the twelfth century, the ordeals started to be generally disapproved and they were discontinued during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Although papal authority had stood against ordeals generally since Innocent III, the interplay of canon and common law was such that a clear anathema on the practice given in 1215 would have unintended consequences and overstepped the bounds of ecclesiastical authority. Secular authorities might deem someone guilty if they relied on clerical authority to avoid an ordeal, and certain &quot;occult&quot; crimes (those to which there would not normally be witnesses) could not be effectively prosecuted in the legal system of the time by any other means than ordeal. Innocent III&#x27;s prohibition of clerical participation in trial by ordeal was essentially a call to action for secular authorities to move away from it, a process which took centuries to complete.

In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries some kinds of ordeals were once again used in witch-hunts, although these were actually intended more as a physical test of whether the accused would float, rather than an ordeal invoking divine intervention to prove or disprove guilt, i.e., a witch floated by the nature of a witch, not because God intervened and caused her to float, demonstrating her guilt.

==Modern theories==

According to a theory put forward by economics professor Peter Leeson, trial by ordeal may have been effective at sorting the guilty from the innocent. On the assumption that defendants were believers in divine intervention for the innocent, then only the truly innocent would choose to endure a trial; guilty defendants would confess or settle cases instead. Therefore, the theory goes, church and judicial authorities could routinely rig ordeals so that the participants—presumably innocent—could pass them. To support this theory, Leeson points to the great latitude given to the priests in administering the ordeal and interpreting the results of the ordeal. He also points to the overall high exoneration rate of accused persons undergoing the ordeal, when intuitively one would expect a very high proportion of people carrying a red hot iron to be badly burned and thus fail the ordeal. Peter Brown explains the persistence and eventual withering of the ordeal by stating that it helped promote consensus in a society where people lived in close quarters and there was little centralized power. In a world where &quot;the sacred penetrated into the chinks of the profane and vice-versa&quot; the ordeal was a &quot;controlled miracle&quot; that served as a point of consensus when one of the greatest dangers to the community was feud. From this analysis, Brown argues that the increasing authoritativeness of the state lessened the need and desire for the ordeal as an instrument of consensus, which ultimately led to its disappearance.

<doc id="264514" wikidata="Q48505" url="?curid=264514" title="Luxor AB">
<text>Luxor was a Swedish home electronics and computer manufacturer located in Motala, established in 1923 and acquired by Nokia in 1985. The brand name is now owned by Turkish company Vestel and is used for televisions sold in the Swedish market.

Originally a manufacturer of tape recorders, radios, television sets, stereo systems, and other home electronics, it launched its first home computer, the ABC 80 in 1978. The succeeding ABC 800 series was introduced in 1981 with new releases in 1983 being produced until the ABC line was terminated in 1986.

==History==
The company was established in 1923 by Axel Holstensson (full name Axel Harald Holstensson; 1889–1979). He was the son of an ore loader and had no training other than a few years of elementary school. He worked as an electrician and eventually as a travel fitter and foreman at ASEA for years, from 1907 to 1918. In his spare time, he studied electrical engineering. In 1918, he moved to Motala and started an electronics store and installation company Motala Electric Agency (). The post-war depression, however, almost led to bankruptcy, the situation was critical and the resort was to start building radios. Components were procured from Germany and it was shown to be possible to sell a number of devices at a profit, so Axel Holstensson registered the Luxor Radio Factory Company () in 1923. The name Luxor was apposite and then very topical as the Tomb of Tutankhamun had just been discovered near the city of Luxor in Egypt.

Finnish company Nokia became a principal owner in the company in 1984. Computer production was discontinued in 1986, followed by television production in Motala in 1992, when the production moved to Finland. Instead, it produced receivers for cable and satellite television. But Nokia wanted to streamline its business to mobile telephony and therefore sold the satellite receiver business in 1998 to American company Space Craft Inc. The company continued to manufacture satellite receivers in Motala until 2002, when it was transferred to low-cost countries.

In October 1997, Nokia sold its car speaker and audio amplifier business to Harman International Industries. A collaboration with the then Electrolux-owned Autoliv AB led to the company first becoming a partner for Luxor Electronics since 1998, then buying the entire business. In Motala, there still remains manufacturing of various types of electronic products for the automotive industry but not under the Luxor brand.

The brand name was later sold to the Norwegian retailer Elkjøp ASA, as when British company Dixons Retail bought Elkjøp in November 1999, they also acquired the Luxor brand. In 2006 Turkish company Vestel acquired the Luxor brand.

<doc id="264515" wikidata="Q752797" url="?curid=264515" title="ISO 9362">
<text>ISO 9362 is an international standard for Business Identifier Codes (BIC), a unique identifier for business institutions, approved by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). BIC is also known as SWIFT-BIC, SWIFT ID, or SWIFT code, after the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), which is designated by ISO as the BIC registration authority. BIC was defined originally as Bank Identifier Code and is most often assigned to financial organizations; when it is assigned to non-financial organization, the code may also be known as Business Entity Identifier (BEI). These codes are used when transferring money between banks, particularly for international wire transfers, and also for the exchange of other messages between banks. The codes can sometimes be found on account statements.

The overlapping issue between ISO 9362 and ISO 13616 is discussed in the article International Bank Account Number (also called IBAN). The SWIFT network does not require a specific format for the transaction so the identification of accounts and transaction types is left to agreements of the transaction partners. In the process of the Single Euro Payments Area the European central banks have agreed on a common format based on IBAN and BIC including an XML-based transmission format for standardized transactions. T2 (RTGS) is a joint gross clearing system in the European Union that does not require the SWIFT network for transmission (see EBICS). The TARGET directory lists all the BICs of the banks that are attached to the TARGET2-network being a subset of the SWIFT-directory of BICs.

== History ==
There are five versions.
* ISO 9362:1987, from year 1987, withdrawn
* ISO 9362:1994, from year 1994, withdrawn
* ISO 9362:2009, from year 2009, withdrawn
* ISO 9362:2014, from year 2014, withdrawn
* ISO 9362:2022, from year 2022, valid
ISO 9362 is based on the industry standard created by SWIFT around 1975.

== Structure ==
The SWIFT code is 8 or 11 characters, made up of:
* 4 letters: institution code or bank code.
* 2 letters: ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 country code (exceptionally, SWIFT has assigned the code XK to Republic of Kosovo, which does not have an ISO 3166-1 country code)
* 2 letters or digits: location code
** if the second character is &quot;0&quot;, then it is typically a test BIC as opposed to a BIC used on the live network.
** if the second character is &quot;1&quot;, then it denotes a passive participant in the SWIFT network
** if the second character is &quot;2&quot;, then it typically indicates a reverse billing BIC, where the recipient pays for the message as opposed to the more usual mode whereby the sender pays for the message.
* 3 letters or digits: branch code, optional (&#x27;XXX&#x27; for primary office)

Where an eight digit code is given, it may be assumed that it refers to the primary office.

SWIFT Standards, a division of The Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT), handles the registration of these codes. Because SWIFT originally introduced what was later standardized as Business Identifier Codes (BICs), they are still often called SWIFT addresses or codes.

The 2009 update of ISO 9362 broadened the scope to include non-financial institutions; before then BIC was commonly understood to be an acronym for &quot;Bank Identifier Code&quot;.

There are over 7,500 &quot;live&quot; codes (for partners actively connected to the SWIFT network) and an estimated 10,000 additional BIC codes which can be used for manual transactions.

==Examples==
Deutsche Bank is an international bank, with its head office in Frankfurt, Germany. The SWIFT code for its primary office is DEUTDEFF:
* DEUT identifies Deutsche Bank
* DE is the country code for Germany
* FF is the code for Frankfurt
Deutsche Bank uses an extended code of 11 characters and has assigned branches or processing areas individual extended codes. This allows the payment to be directed to a specific office. For example, DEUTDEFF500 would direct the payment to an office of Deutsche Bank in Bad Homburg.

Nedbank is a primarily South African bank, with its head office in Johannesburg. The SWIFT code for its primary office is NEDSZAJJ:
* NEDS identifies Nedbank
* ZA is the country code for South Africa
* JJ is the code for Johannesburg
Nedbank has not implemented the extended code of 11 characters and all SWIFT transfers to its accounts are directed to the primary office for processing. Those transfer interfaces that require an 11 digit code would enter NEDSZAJJXXX.

Danske Bank is a primarily Danish bank, with its head office in Copenhagen. The SWIFT code for its primary office is DABADKKK:
* DABA identifies Danske Bank
* DK is the country code for Denmark
* KK (for &quot;København&quot; in Danish) is the code for Copenhagen.

UniCredit Banca is a primarily Italian bank with its head office in Milan.
The SWIFT code for its primary office is UNCRITMM:
* UNCR identifies Unicredit Banca
* IT is the country code for Italy
* MM is the code for Milan.

Dah Sing Bank is a bank based in Hong Kong that has five branches in mainland China (primary mainland China branch in Shenzhen).
The SWIFT code for the branch in Shanghai is DSBACNBXSHA.
* DSBA identifies Dah Sing Bank
* CN is the country code for China
* BXSHA is the code for Shanghai.
It uses the 11-digit extended code, and SHA identifies the Shanghai branch.

BDO Unibank is the biggest bank in the Philippines, with its head office in Makati. The SWIFT Code for BDO is BNORPHMM. All BDO branches have the same SWIFT Code.

*BNOR identifies BDO Unibank
*PH is the country code for the Philippines
*MM is the code for Metro Manila of which Makati is a part.

Note that one bank can seem to have more than one bank identifier in a given country for separation purposes. Bank of East Asia separates its representative branch in the US and its US-based operations for local customers into BEASUS33xxx (following the code used in its home country) and BEAKUS33xxx respectively. This differs from its local mainland China operations which are also BEASCNxxxxx following Hong Kong rather than having a separate identifier code.

* An example of this is Bank of America in the United States. For US Dollar denominated wires, its SWIFT code is BOFAUS3N. The SWIFT code for wires sent in foreign currency (non-U.S. dollars) to Bank of America in the United States is BOFAUS6S.

In the past, SEPA payments required both BIC and IBAN. Since 2016-02-01 only the IBAN is needed inside the SEPA (European Union and some more countries).

==Twelve-character SWIFTNet FIN address based on BIC==
To identify endpoints on its network, SWIFT also uses twelve-character codes that are derived from the BIC of the institution. Such a code consists of the &#x27;BIC8&#x27;, followed by a one-character code that identifies the Logical Terminal (LT), (also referred to as &quot;local destination&quot; or &quot;Logical Terminal address&quot;), and the three-character branch code. While &#x27;BIC12&#x27;s are not part of the ISO standard, and are only relevant in the context of the messaging platform, they play a role in FIN system messaging. According to SWIFT, Logical Terminals are the &quot;entity through which users send and receive FIN messages.&quot;, thus, may play a role within routing of the message.

== Usage ==
Business Identifier Codes are primarily used for identifying financial and non-financial institutions involving day-to-day business transactions among one or more institutions in transaction lifecycle.

Example: In SWIFT messages these BICs are embedded within the messages. Consider the message type for cash transfer MT103, here we can find BIC under different tags like 50a (ordering customer), 56a (intermediary), 57a (account with institution), etc.

<doc id="264517" wikidata="Q7198545" url="?curid=264517" title="Pit (game)">
<text>Pit is a fast-paced card game for three to eight players, designed to simulate open outcry bidding for commodities. The game first went on sale in 1904 by the American games company Parker Brothers.

The inspirations were the Chicago Board of Trade (known as the Pit) and the US Corn Exchange. The game itself was likely based on the very successful game &quot;Gavitt&#x27;s Stock Exchange&quot;, invented in 1903 by Harry E. Gavitt of Topeka, Kansas.

While the name &quot;Pit&quot; remains trademarked in many countries by Hasbro, versions of the game have been marketed under names, including Billionaire, Business, Cambio, Deluxe Pit, Quick 7, Zaster. As early as 1904, the attributed clairvoyant Edgar Cayce claimed he had developed the game and sent it to Parker Brothers. 

==Contents==
Different versions of the game contain different numbers of cards. The original edition has 63 cards, with nine cards each of the seven different commodities. Later editions added an eighth commodity, along with a Bear card and a Bull card, for 74 cards total.

Originally, the commodities and values were the following:
Newer versions include seven or eight commodities, with Flax, Hay and Rye removed from the list of commodities:
The 100th anniversary edition, released in 2004, included a reproduction of the original edition as well as a brand new edition that featured 8 &quot;modernized&quot; commodities:

Versions of the game starting in the 1970s contained a bell used to start trading. The first player to hold all nine cards of a commodity would ring the bell.

==Play==

The number of commodities included in each round is equal to the number of players. Each player is dealt nine cards; two players get ten if the Bear and the Bull are included in play.

&quot;Pit&quot; has no turns and everyone plays at once. Players trade commodities among one another by each blindly exchanging one to four cards of the same commodity. The trading process involves calling out the number of cards one wishes to trade until another player holds out an equal number of commodity cards. The two parties then exchange the cards face down.

=== Winning ===
As soon as a player has nine cards of the same commodity in hand, they must reveal their entire hand (e.g., by throwing the cards onto the middle, or the corner board if available) and call out &quot;Corner on (the name of the commodity they are holding)!&quot;, ending the round. That player then earns points equal to the number value of the commodity they were holding. In deluxe editions of the game, the player with a full set of nine has to ring the bell before revealing their hand.

The first player to reach an agreed-upon point total wins the game.

=== The Bear and the Bull ===
The Bear card serves as a hazard for all players, as its holder may not declare a Corner even while holding all cards of the same commodity.

The Bull card is considered wild and can be used to complete any set. When it is in play, a player can win a round in any of the following ways:
* Holding all nine cards of the same commodity, as described above, with or without a tenth card in hand
* Holding eight cards of one commodity and the Bull (&quot;Bull Corner&quot;)
* Holding all nine cards of the same commodity and the Bull (&quot;Double Bull Corner&quot;), which awards double value

At the end of a round, the Bear and the Bull each impose a 20-point penalty on any non-winning player holding them. It is possible for a player&#x27;s score to go below zero. The Bull and Bear may be traded individually or with any number of cards of one commodity. However, the four-card limit for a single trade still applies.

<doc id="264521" wikidata="Q753867" url="?curid=264521" title="The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway">
<text>The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway is the sixth studio album by the English progressive rock band Genesis. A double album, it was released on 22 November 1974 by Charisma Records and is their last to feature lead vocalist Peter Gabriel. It reached No. 10 on the UK Albums Chart and No. 41 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

After deciding to produce a concept album with a story devised by Gabriel about Rael, a Puerto Rican youth from New York City who is taken on a journey of self-discovery, Genesis worked on new material at Headley Grange for three months. The album was marked by increased tensions within the band as Gabriel, who insisted on writing all of the lyrics, temporarily left to work with filmmaker William Friedkin and needed time to be with his family. Most of the songs were developed by the rest of the band through jam sessions and were put down at Manor in Wales using a mobile studio.

&quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; echoed the format of Genesis&#x27;s debut album &quot;From Genesis to Revelation&quot;: a concept album with Christian themes which interweaves concise pop tunes centered around Gabriel&#x27;s vocals and brief instrumental interludes, with most of the instrumental pieces not being acknowledged in the track list. The music and lyrics also make references to Genesis&#x27;s early works and early influences. 

The album received mixed reviews at first, and was the first Genesis album that failed to outsell its predecessors, but gained acclaim in subsequent years and has a cult following. &quot;Counting Out Time&quot; and &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; were released as singles in the UK in 1974 and 1975; both failed to chart. A single of &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; was released in the US. Genesis promoted the album with their 1974–75 tour across North America and Europe, playing the album in its entirety. The album reached Gold certification in the UK and the US. The album was remastered in 1994 and 2007, the latter as part of the &quot;Genesis 1970–1975&quot; box set which contains a 5.1 surround sound mix and bonus material.

== Background ==
In May 1974, the Genesis line-up of frontman and singer Peter Gabriel, keyboardist Tony Banks, bassist and guitarist Mike Rutherford, drummer Phil Collins and guitarist Steve Hackett finished their 1973–1974 tour of Europe and North America to support their fifth studio album, &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; (1973). That album was a critical and commercial success for the group, earning them their highest-charting release in the United Kingdom and the United States. That June they booked three months at Headley Grange, a large former workhouse in Headley, East Hampshire, in order to write and rehearse new material for their next studio album. The building had been left in a very poor state by the previous band to use it, with excrement on the floor and rat infestations. By this time the personal lives of some members had begun to affect the mood in the band, causing complications for their work. Hackett explained: &quot;Everybody had their own agenda. Some of us were married, some of us had children, some of us were getting divorced, and we were still trying to get it together in the country&quot;.

== Production ==

=== Writing === 
The band decided to produce a double album before they had agreed on its contents or direction, for the extended format presented the opportunity for them to put down more of their musical ideas. A single album of songs telling segments of a story did not appeal to them, and Banks thought they had gained a strong enough following by this point to put out two albums&#x27; worth of material that their fans would be willing to listen to. They had wanted to produce a concept album that told a story for some time, and Rutherford pitched an idea based on the fantasy novel &quot;The Little Prince&quot; by Antoine de Saint-Exupéry, but Gabriel considered it &quot;too twee&quot; and believed &quot;prancing around in fairyland was rapidly becoming obsolete&quot;.

Gabriel presented a surreal story about a Puerto Rican youth named Rael who is taken on a spiritual journey of self-discovery and identity as he encounters bizarre incidents and characters. He first thought of the story while touring North America in the previous year, and pitched a synopsis to the group until they agreed to go ahead with it. It was more detailed and obscure in its initial form until Gabriel refined it and made Rael the central character. Gabriel chose the name Rael as it was one without a particular ethnic origin, but he later realised The Who used the same name on &quot;The Who Sell Out&quot; (1967); this annoyed him at first, but he stuck to the choice. The band also found that &quot;Ra&quot; was common in male names in various nationalities. Gabriel was inspired by a variety of sources for the story including &quot;West Side Story&quot;, &quot;a kind of punk&quot; twist to the Christian allegory &quot;The Pilgrim&#x27;s Progress&quot;, the works of Swiss psychologist Carl Jung, and the surreal Western film &quot;El Topo&quot; (1971) by Alejandro Jodorowsky. In contrast to &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot;, which contained strong English themes, Gabriel made a conscious effort to avoid repetition and instead portray American imagery in his lyrics. He had the story begin on Broadway in New York City, and makes references to Caryl Chessman, Lenny Bruce, Groucho Marx, Marshall McLuhan, Howard Hughes, Evel Knievel and the Ku Klux Klan. Gabriel expressed some concern over the album&#x27;s title shortly after its release, but clarified that the lamb itself is purely symbolic and a catalyst for the peculiar events that occur.

During the writing sessions at Headley Grange, Gabriel insisted that having devised the concept he should write the lyrics, leaving the majority of the music in the charge of his bandmates. This was a departure from the band&#x27;s usual method of songwriting, as lyrical contributions on previous albums had always been divided among the members. Gabriel explained that &quot;I maintained then (and still do) that not many stories are written by committee&quot;, while Banks said that the rest of the group &quot;felt it would give the album a bit of a one-dimensional quality and, for me, lyrically speaking, that is what happened.&quot; This situation left Gabriel often secluded in one room writing the lyrics, and the remaining four rehearsing in another, since Gabriel could not write lyrics as fast as the others could write music, and so had to catch up on writing lyrics for music that had already been composed. Gabriel ultimately fell so far behind that he relented and agreed to allow Rutherford and Banks to write the words for one song, &quot;The Light Dies Down on Broadway&quot;. Banks and Hackett suggested lyrics they thought would fit &quot;The Lamia&quot; and &quot;Here Comes the Supernatural Anaesthetist&quot; respectively, which Gabriel rebuffed.

Further disagreements arose during the writing period when Gabriel left the group for a short period having accepted an invitation from film producer William Friedkin to collaborate on a screenplay, after he took a liking to Gabriel&#x27;s surreal story printed on the sleeve of &quot;Genesis Live&quot; (1973). Gabriel believed that he could collaborate with Friedkin as a side project. However, the other members maintained that this was an encroachment on the band&#x27;s time and that Gabriel had to choose between them and Friedkin; he chose Friedkin. In Gabriel&#x27;s absence Collins suggested having the new studio album be purely instrumental, but the idea was rejected by the rest of the group. Friedkin, however, was not prepared to split the band over a mere idea and Gabriel resumed work on the album. Banks said he believes Charisma Records president Tony Stratton Smith had a key role in negotiating Gabriel&#x27;s return to Genesis.

=== Recording ===
After their allocated time at Headley Grange came to an end, Genesis relocated to Manor in , Carmarthenshire, Wales to record the album. The remote location required them to use the mobile studio owned by Island Studios that was parked outside. The Island mobile featured two 3M 24-track recorders, a Helios Electronics 30-input mixing console, Altec monitors, and two A62 Studer tape machines for mastering. The album is the band&#x27;s last with John Burns as co-producer, who had assumed the role since &quot;Genesis Live&quot;, recorded the previous year. Engineering duties were carried out by David Hutchins. Burns and Gabriel experimented with different vocal effects by recording takes in a bathroom and in a cowshed two miles away. Rutherford thought the album&#x27;s sound was an improvement to past Genesis albums since it was not recorded in a professional studio, which benefited the sound of Collins&#x27; drums. Collins compared the sound of the album to that of Neil Young&#x27;s recordings made in his barn, &quot;not studio, not soundproof, but a woody quality&quot;. Gabriel said one track was recorded directly onto a cassette which was used on the album.

Gabriel spent additional time in London after his wife, Jill, underwent the difficult birth of their first child on 26 July 1974, leaving Gabriel often travelling back and forth. Gabriel recounted, &quot;the band were recording but instead of being somewhere reasonably close to where we were, in St Mary&#x27;s Hospital, Paddington, they were out in Wales, so I was making these long pilgrimages. I was based in London and whenever things looked better I&#x27;d try and zoom back to Wales for the recording. This is something I think that the band would accept now, but back then they weren&#x27;t very understanding. And I just lost it in a lot of ways because this was a life and death situation and so obviously much more important than an album or anything else.&quot; Rutherford later admitted that he and Banks were &quot;horribly unsupportive&quot; of Gabriel during this time, and Gabriel saw this as the beginning of his eventual departure from Genesis.

The backing tracks were put down in roughly two weeks. Gabriel was still working on the lyrics a month later, and asked the band to produce additional music for &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; and &quot;The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging&quot; so he could fit in words that had no designated section for them. Thinking the extra material was to be instrumental, the band later found that Gabriel had sung over their new parts, something that he also had done on &quot;Foxtrot&quot; and &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; and caused songs to be musically dense. Gabriel recorded his remaining vocals at Island&#x27;s main studio in Notting Hill, London, where the album was mixed over a series of shifts as they were pressured to finish the album in time for its release date. Collins recalled: &quot;I&#x27;d be mixing and dubbing all night and then Tony and Mike would come in and remix what I&#x27;d done because I&#x27;d lost all sense of normality by that point&quot;.

== Story ==

Gabriel used New York City as a tool to make Rael &quot;more real, more extrovert and violent&quot;, choosing to develop a character that is the least likely person to &quot;fall into all this pansy claptrap&quot;, and aiming for a story that contrasted between fantasy and character. He explained that as the story progresses Rael finds he is not as &quot;butch&quot; as he hoped, and his experiences eventually bring out a more romantic side to his personality. Gabriel deliberately kept the ending ambiguous but clarified that Rael does not die, although he compared the ending to the buildup of suspense and drama in a film in which &quot;you never see what&#x27;s so terrifying because they leave it up in the air without ... labelling it&quot;. Several of the story&#x27;s occurrences and settings derived from Gabriel&#x27;s own dreams. Collins remarked that the entire concept was about split personality. The individual songs also make satirical allusions to mythology, the sexual revolution, advertising, and consumerism. Gabriel felt the songs alone were not enough to detail all of the action in his story, so he wrote the full plot on the album&#x27;s sleeve.

=== Plot summary ===
One morning in New York City, Rael is holding a can of spray paint, hating everyone around him. He witnesses a lamb lying down on Broadway which has a profound effect on him (&quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;). As he walks along the street, he sees a dark cloud take the shape of a movie screen and move towards him, absorbing him (&quot;Fly on a Windshield&quot;). He sees an explosion of images of the current day (&quot;Broadway Melody of 1974&quot;) before he wakes up in a cave and falls asleep once again (&quot;Cuckoo Cocoon&quot;). Rael wakes up and finds himself trapped in a cage of stalactites and stalagmites which close in towards him. As he tries to escape, he sees many other people in many other cages, before spotting his brother John outside. Rael calls to him, but John walks away and the cage suddenly disappears (&quot;In the Cage&quot;).

Rael now finds himself on the floor of a factory and is given a tour of the area by a woman, where he watches people being processed like packages. He spots old members of his New York City gang, and also John with the number 9 stamped on his forehead. Fearing for his life, Rael escapes into a corridor (&quot;The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging&quot;) and has an extended flashback of returning from a gang raid in New York City, a dream where his hairy heart is removed and shaved with a razor, (&quot;Back in N.Y.C.&quot;) and his first sexual encounter (&quot;Counting Out Time&quot;). Rael&#x27;s flashback ends, and he finds himself in a long, red-carpeted corridor of people crawling towards a wooden door. Rael runs past them and exits via a spiral staircase (&quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot;). At the top, he enters a chamber with 32 doors, surrounded by people and unable to concentrate (&quot;The Chamber of 32 Doors&quot;).

Rael finds a blind woman who leads him out of the chamber (&quot;Lilywhite Lilith&quot;) and into another cave, where he becomes trapped by falling rocks (&quot;Anyway&quot;). Death arrives and gasses Rael with his supernatural anesthetic (&quot;Here Comes the Supernatural Anaesthetist&quot;). However, Rael believes himself to still be alive and escapes the cave, dismissing Death as a hallucination. Rael ends up in a pool with three Lamia, beautiful snake-like creatures, and has sex with them, but they die after drinking some of his blood. He eats their corpses (&quot;The Lamia&quot;). Leaving by the same door he came in through, he finds himself in a group of Slippermen, distorted, grotesque men who have all had the same experience with the Lamia, and say he has become one of them (&quot;The Arrival&quot;). Rael finds John among the Slippermen, who reveals that the only way to become human again is to visit Doktor Dyper and be castrated (&quot;A Visit to the Doktor&quot;). Both are castrated and keep their removed penises in containers around their necks. Rael&#x27;s container is taken by a raven and he chases after it, leaving John behind. The raven drops the container in a ravine and into a rushing underground river (&quot;The Raven&quot;).

As Rael walks alongside it, he sees a window in the bank above his head which reveals his home amidst the streets. Faced with the option of returning home, he sees John in the river below him, struggling to stay afloat. Rael dives in to save him and the gateway to New York vanishes (&quot;The Light Dies Down on Broadway&quot;). Rael rescues John and drags his body to the bank of the river and turns him over to look at his face, only to see his own face instead (&quot;In the Rapids&quot;). His consciousness then drifts between both bodies, and he sees the surrounding scenery melting away into a haze. Both bodies dissolve, and Rael&#x27;s spirit becomes one with everything around him (&quot;it.&quot;).

== Songs ==
Much of the music developed through band improvisations and mood-inspired jams, often after one member set a single idea. Examples of this are what Banks described as a &quot;Chinese jam&quot; which ended up sharing a track with &quot;The Colony of Slippermen&quot;, one named &quot;Victory at Sea&quot; which was worked into &quot;Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats&quot;, and another known as &quot;Evil Jam&quot; which became &quot;The Waiting Room&quot;. Though the album is written to a story concept, Gabriel described its format as being split into &quot;self-contained song units&quot;. He thought the album contained some of the group&#x27;s best material that he was most proud of during his time in Genesis.

===Sides one and two===
Opener &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; was the last song that schoolfriends Banks and Gabriel wrote together while Gabriel was in the group, although Gabriel maintained that he only wrote the lyrics. Banks had to cross his hands over to play the piano introduction which has unusual sequences of notes. The song borrows music and lyrics from &quot;On Broadway&quot; by The Drifters at the end. &quot;Fly on a Windshield&quot; came from a group improvisation sparked by Rutherford&#x27;s idea of Egyptian pharaohs going down the Nile, which Hackett compared to Maurice Ravel&#x27;s &quot;Boléro&quot;. Banks described the part where the entire band comes in, signifying the moment a fly hits the windshield of a car, as &quot;probably the single best moment in Genesis&#x27;s history.&quot; The track segues into &quot;Broadway Melody of 1974&quot;, although the two pieces were written independently and only connected later on. Hackett and his brother John wrote the two opening chords of &quot;Cuckoo Cocoon&quot; at home several years prior, but John is uncredited. Hackett wrote the vocal melody. The music for &quot;In the Cage&quot; was almost entirely written by Banks, who presented it to the band only when it was nearly complete.
&quot;The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging&quot; is one of the few songs on the album where the lyrics were written first, and the music was then composed to fit the theme. According to Banks, &quot;I just started playing these two chords, a dopey kind of riff really ... I just keep one note going through the whole thing and just change the chords underneath it, letting it build. Then what Pete did on top was kind of wild and he didn&#x27;t really make any use of the melodic content of the piece, but I think it works very well.&quot; While mixing at Island Gabriel asked Brian Eno, who was working on his album &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot;, to add synthesized effects on his vocals on several tracks, including &quot;The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging&quot;. Eno&#x27;s work is credited on the liner notes for &quot;Enossification&quot;. Gabriel was a fan of Eno and believed he could enhance the adventurous aspect of the sound. Genesis had little money to pay Eno, so Eno negotiated for Collins to play drums on his track &quot;Mother Whale Eyeless&quot;.

&quot;Back in N.Y.C.&quot; saw Genesis adopt a more aggressive sound than before. with Rutherford playing a 6-string Micro-Frets bass. Rutherford described &quot;Back in N.Y.C.&quot; as a group composition which emerged from improvisations, while Banks said it was written entirely by Rutherford and himself, with Rutherford writing &quot;the main parts&quot;. Banks also credited Rutherford as the sole composer of &quot;In the Rapids&quot;. &quot;Hairless Heart&quot; originated from a guitar melody from Hackett, for which Banks composed the other parts as a backing. Banks was fond of the piece and was dismayed when it was titled &quot;Hairless Heart&quot; in reference to a lyric from &quot;Back in N.Y.C.&quot;, commenting, &quot;shaving hair off the heart, it&#x27;s a horrible concept!&quot; A rare instance of a Genesis song not written collaboratively, &quot;Counting Out Time&quot; was written entirely by Gabriel before the album was conceived. Hackett&#x27;s guitar solo was filtered through an EMS Synthi Hi-Fli guitar synthesizer. &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; developed at a time when Gabriel had written some lyrics, but no music had been written for them. Banks and Rutherford put together a chord sequence in D, E minor and F-sharp minor with a roll from the drums flowing through it. Gabriel spent &quot;hours and hours&quot; on an out-of-tune piano at home developing the song, and his wife recalled his fondness for the track. The beginning of the song reprises &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot;.

===Sides three and four===
&quot;Lilywhite Lilith&quot; was built on two song fragments, both of them written by Collins–a section from the unrecorded early Genesis song &quot;The Light&quot;, and a piece that he wrote later on. &quot;The Waiting Room&quot; developed as a &quot;basic good to bad soundscaping&quot; jam while it was raining outside Headley Grange. When the band stopped, a rainbow had formed. Collins remembered Hackett playing &quot;these dark chords, then Peter blows into his oboe reeds, then there was a loud clap of thunder and we really thought we were entering another world or something. It was moments like that when we were still very much a unified five-piece.&quot; Banks regretted not recording the improvisation as it took place, as he felt the band were unable to recreate the tone of the original in their later renditions. &quot;Anyway&quot; developed from a song named &quot;Frustration&quot;, which Banks wrote before Genesis was formed. The music for &quot;The Lamia&quot; was primarily written by Banks. After he brought it to the band, Gabriel wrote the lyrics, and Banks brought it home to write the vocal melody.

&quot;The Colony of Slippermen&quot; is divided into three parts, but also shares a track with the &quot;Chinese jam&quot; which was never given a proper title. The synthesizer solo was developed as a joke, parodying traditional rock forms, but when played back the band found it sounded stronger than they had intended. The riffs which precede &quot;The Raven&quot; were another element recycled from &quot;The Light&quot;. &quot;Ravine&quot; was another piece improvised by the band, with Hackett using a fuzz box and wah-wah pedal to emulate the sound of wind. &quot;The Light Dies Down on Broadway&quot; is a reprise of &quot;The Lamia&quot; (the verses) and &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; (chorus), but the latter arranged at a slower tempo. Rutherford and Banks wrote the lyrics, the only one on the album with lyrics by someone other than Gabriel, but were told by Gabriel what action had to take place in them. &quot;Riding the Scree&quot; was played entirely by Banks, Collins, and Rutherford (apart from a brief vocal by Gabriel), with Rutherford playing both bass and guitar. It was a particularly difficult track for Banks to play on stage due to its irregular meter with multiple time signature changes, so he played the solo in 4/4 time and hoped to end up with the rest of the band at the end.

Genesis were unable to come up with ideas that they liked for a finale, so they settled for a piece Banks and Hackett wrote as an instrumental as the music for the closing track, &quot;It&quot;. The concluding lyric–&quot;It&#x27;s only knock and knowall, but I like it&quot;–is a play on the contemporary song &quot;It&#x27;s Only Rock &#x27;n Roll (But I Like It)&quot; by The Rolling Stones.

== Sleeve design ==

The group&#x27;s change in musical and artistic direction is also reflected visually, bringing in Hipgnosis to design the cover artwork. In contrast to previous Genesis album covers, which were colourful and more pastoral in nature, Hipgnosis conceived a monochrome design of a storyboard made of photographs depicting Rael in various settings from the story. The bottom left image depicts Rael in the area where &quot;In the Rapids&quot; and &quot;Riding the Scree&quot; are set. Storm Thorgerson said the focal point of the design was having Rael step outside of it and looking back on the events, &quot;a step considered necessary in the process of self-realisation.&quot; The photographs were shot on black-and-white negative, of which the prints were cut, adjusted, and touched up with several artistic processes by Richard Manning to produce a final composite. The band were adamant that they did not want to be photographed for the cover, and conducted a search for a model to portray Rael. They went with an unnamed person who is credited as &quot;Omar&quot; on the liner notes. The cover features a new band logo in an Art Deco style produced by George Hardie.

The band members had varying opinions of the album cover. Hackett considered it inferior to many of Hipgnosis&#x27;s other covers and felt the style reflected an unwillingness by Hipgnosis to take the band&#x27;s preferences into consideration. By contrast, Banks and Gabriel felt the cover was well-suited to the album, effectively highlighting that the music was in a much more stark and realistic style than their previous albums, though Gabriel said he was not fully satisfied with the model who portrays Rael. Collins called the cover &quot;a little bit confused, just like the story. It&#x27;s a distinct package and at least it evokes something.&quot;

== Release ==
The band considered releasing the album as two single albums released six months apart. Gabriel later thought this idea would have been more suitable, for a double album contained too much new material, and the extra time would have given him more time to work on the lyrics. Nevertheless, &quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; was released as a double album on 22 November 1974, days after the start of its supporting tour. It peaked at No. 10 on the UK Albums Chart in December 1974 during its six-week stay on the chart, and became the band&#x27;s highest-charting album yet in the US, peaking at No. 41 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in February 1975. Elsewhere, the album reached No. 15 in Canada and No. 34 in New Zealand. Two singles were released; &quot;Counting Out Time&quot; with &quot;Riding the Scree&quot; as its B-side, was released on 1 November 1974. The second, &quot;The Carpet Crawlers&quot; backed with a live performance of &quot;The Waiting Room (Evil Jam)&quot; at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles, followed in April 1975. The album continued to sell, and reached Gold certification by the British Phonographic Industry on 1 February 1975, and Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America for sales in excess of 500,000 copies on 20 April 1990.

== Critical reception ==
Members of the group expressed some concern about the album&#x27;s critical reception, and expected to receive some negative responses over its concept and extended format. Banks hoped the album would end people&#x27;s comparisons of Genesis to Yes and Emerson, Lake &amp; Palmer, two other popular progressive rock bands of the time. Gabriel knew the album&#x27;s concept was ideal for critics &quot;to get their teeth into&quot;.

In giving an interview to &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in October 1974, shortly before the album&#x27;s release, Gabriel played several tracks from &quot;The Lamb&quot; to reporter Chris Welch, including &quot;In the Cage&quot;, &quot;Hairless Heart&quot;, &quot;Carpet Crawlers&quot;, and &quot;Counting Out Time&quot;. Welch wrote, &quot;It sounded superb. Beautiful songs, fascinating lyrics, and sensitive, subtle playing, mixed with humour and harmonies. What more could a Genesis fan desire?&quot; He singled out Collins&#x27; playing as &quot;outstanding&quot;. Welch&#x27;s review for &quot;Melody Maker&quot; published a month later included his thoughts on such long concept albums–&quot;A few golden miraculous notes and some choice pithy words are worth all the clutter and verbiage&quot;–and he called the album a &quot;white elephant&quot;. For &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, Barbara Charone wrote highly of the collection. She summarised &quot;The Lamb&quot; as a combination of the &quot;musical proficiency&quot; on &quot;Selling England by the Pound&quot; (1973) with the &quot;grandiose illusions&quot; on &quot;Foxtrot&quot; (1972) and &quot;a culmination of past elements injected with present abilities and future directions&quot;. Charone thought it had more high points than any previous Genesis album, apart from some &quot;few awkward instrumental moments on side three&quot;. All members received praise for their performances, including Hackett coming across as a more dominant member of the group with his &quot;frenetic, choppy style&quot;, Collins&#x27; backup harmony vocals and Rutherford&#x27;s &quot;thick, foreboding bass chords and gentle acoustics&quot;. Colin Irwin wrote a negative review of the &quot;Counting Out Time&quot; single, with its &quot;weary, tepid approach&quot; and a &quot;woeful, dreary three and a half minutes&quot;.

== Legacy ==
In later years, the album received acclaim. In 1978, Nick Kent wrote for &quot;New Musical Express&quot; that it &quot;had a compelling appeal that often transcended the hoary weightiness of the mammoth concept that held the equally mammoth four sides of vinyl together&quot;. In a special edition of &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Mojo&quot; magazines titled &quot;Pink Floyd &amp; The Story of Prog Rock&quot;, &quot;The Lamb&quot; ranked at No. 14 in its 40 Cosmic Rock Albums list. The album came third in a list of the ten best concept albums by &quot;Uncut&quot; magazine, where it was described as an &quot;impressionistic, intense album&quot; and &quot;pure theatre (in a good way) and still Gabriel&#x27;s best work&quot;. AllMusic reviewer Stephen Thomas Erlewine gave a retrospective rating of five stars out of five. He says that despite Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;lengthy libretto&quot; on the sleeve &quot;the story never makes sense&quot;, though its music is &quot;forceful, imaginative piece of work that showcases the original Genesis lineup at a peak ... it&#x27;s a considerable, lasting achievement and it&#x27;s little wonder that Peter Gabriel had to leave ... they had gone as far as they could go together&quot;.

A &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; poll to rank readers&#x27; favourite progressive rock albums of all time placed &quot;The Lamb&quot; fifth in the list. In 2014, readers of &quot;Rhythm&quot; voted it the album with the fourth-greatest drumming in the history of progressive rock. In 2015, &quot;NME&quot; included the album in its &quot;23 Maddest and Most Memorable Concept Albums&quot; list for &quot;taking in themes of split personalities, heaven and hell and truth and fantasy&quot;. It was one of two albums by Genesis included in the top ten of the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; list of the 50 Greatest Prog Rock Albums of All Time. The magazine described it as &quot;one of rock&#x27;s more elaborate, beguiling and strangely rewarding concept albums&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

Banks later thought the album&#x27;s concept the weakest thing about it, though the lyrics to some of the individual songs are &quot;wonderful&quot;. Rutherford said that, while &quot;The Lamb&quot; is a fan favorite, it was a gruelling album to work on and had a lot of highs, but also a lot of lows. Hackett remarked how his guitar was underutilized in comparison to past albums, but thought the album had a lot of beautiful moments and has grown on him over time. In &quot;&quot;, Gabriel said &quot;The Lamb&quot; and the song &quot;Supper&#x27;s Ready&quot; were his high points with Genesis. Collins said it was Genesis&#x27;s best music and his favourite Genesis album.

=== Reissues ===
&quot;The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway&quot; was first remastered for CD in 1994, and released on Virgin Records in Europe and Atlantic Records in North America. The included booklet features the lyrics and story printed on the original LP, though some of the inner sleeve artwork was not reproduced. A remastered edition for Super Audio CD and DVD with new stereo and 5.1 surround sound mixes by Nick Davis was released in 2008 as part of the &quot;Genesis 1970–1975&quot; box set.

In 2024, Genesis announced the 50th Anniversary Super Deluxe Edition. This edition will include a new remaster of the album, a full live concert from the Shrine Auditorium (previously released on &quot;Genesis Archive 1967–75&quot;), a Blu-ray version of the album in Dolby Atmos and &quot;three previously unreleased demos&quot; from the Headley Grange sessions included on a digital download card. Also included is a 60-page book, featuring notes by Alexis Petridis, a band member commentary and &quot;rare images&quot;, and a 1975 tour programme, poster and replica ticket. This reissue is set to be released on 28 March 2025.

== Tour ==

Genesis supported the album with a 102-date concert tour across North America and Europe, playing the album in its entirety with one or two older songs (&quot;The Musical Box&quot;, sometimes followed by &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot;) as encores. Rutherford said he was weary of this format by the end of the tour, preferring to play songs from a variety of eras and have the freedom to change up the setlist mid-tour. In addition, most of the audience were not yet familiar with the large amount of new material; in particular, the North American leg of the tour was conducted before the album had been released there. 29 October 1974 was to begin an 11-date tour of the UK that sold out within four hours, but after Hackett crushed a wine glass in his left hand which severed a tendon, and needed time to recover, these dates were rescheduled for 1975. The group lost money, for they were unable to recoup deposits they had paid to the venues. The tour began on 20 November in Chicago, and ended on 22 May 1975 in Besançon, France. The last scheduled concert, on 24 May in Toulouse, was cancelled due to low ticket sales. All but one date of an extensive tour of Italy was also cancelled, due to political turmoil. Hackett estimated the band&#x27;s debts at £220,000 at the tour&#x27;s end.
The tour featured at the time some of the biggest instruments used by the band, including Rutherford&#x27;s double-neck Rickenbacker and the largest drum kit ever used by Collins. The tour&#x27;s stage show involved three backdrop screens that displayed 1,450 slides, designed by Geoffrey Shaw, from eight projectors and a laser lighting display. Banks and Collins recalled the slides only came close to working perfectly on four or five occasions. Gabriel changed his appearance with a short haircut and styled facial hair and dressed as Rael in a leather jacket, T-shirt and jeans. During &quot;The Lamia&quot;, he surrounded himself with a spinning cone-like structure decorated with images of snakes. In the last verse, the cone would collapse to reveal Gabriel wearing a body suit that glowed from lights placed under the stage. &quot;The Colony of Slippermen&quot; featured Gabriel as one of the Slippermen, covered in lumps with inflatable genitalia that emerged onto the stage by crawling out of a penis-shaped tube. Gabriel had difficulty placing his microphone near his mouth whilst he was in the costume. Even on those occasions when Gabriel&#x27;s mouth reached the microphone, and he did not get stuck coming out of the tube or trip and fall due to the poor visibility, he was too out of breath from his struggles with the costume to sing properly. Between the end of &quot;In the Rapids&quot; and the start of &quot;It&quot;, an explosion set off twin strobe lights that revealed Gabriel and a dummy figure dressed identically on each side of the stage, leaving the audience clueless as to which was real. The performance ended with Gabriel vanishing from the stage in a flash of light and a puff of smoke. At the final concert, roadie Geoff Banks acted as the dummy on stage, wearing nothing but a leather jacket. Tony Banks felt this prank was in poor taste.

In one concert review, the theatrics for &quot;The Musical Box&quot;, the show&#x27;s encore and once the band&#x27;s stage highlight, was seen as &quot;crude and elementary&quot; compared to the &quot;sublime grandeur&quot; of &quot;The Lamb...&quot; set. Music critics often focused their reviews on Gabriel&#x27;s theatrics and took the band&#x27;s musical performance as secondary, which irritated the rest of the band. Collins later said, &quot;People would steam straight past Tony, Mike, Steve and I, go straight up to Peter and say, &quot;You&#x27;re fantastic, we really enjoyed the show.&quot; It was becoming a one-man show to the audience.&quot; The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame called the tour &quot;a spectacle on par with anything attempted in the world of rock to that point&quot;.

=== Gabriel&#x27;s departure ===
During their stop in Cleveland in November 1974, Gabriel told the band he would leave at the conclusion of the tour. The decision was kept a secret from outsiders and media all through the tour, and Gabriel promised the band to stay silent about it for a while after its end in June 1975, to give them some time to prepare for a future without him. By August, the news had leaked to the media anyway, and Gabriel wrote a personal statement to the English music press to explain his reasons and his view of his career up to this point; the piece, titled &quot;Out, Angels Out&quot;, was printed in several of the major rock music magazines. In his open letter, he explained his disillusion with the music industry and his wish to spend extended time with his family. Banks later stated, &quot;Pete was also getting too big for the group. He was being portrayed as if he was &#x27;the man&#x27; and it really wasn&#x27;t like that. It was a very difficult thing to accommodate. So it was actually a bit of a relief.&quot;

=== Recordings ===
No complete live performance of the album has been officially released, though the majority of the band&#x27;s live performance from 24 January 1975 at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles appears on the &quot;Genesis Archive 1967–75&quot; box set. Some tracks feature re-recorded vocals from Gabriel and guitar parts from Hackett, while the rendition of &quot;It&quot; was replaced with a remixed studio version with re-recorded vocals. 

The upcoming 50th anniversary box set of the album, to be released on 28 March 2025, will include a complete recording of the Shrine Auditorium show, including the previously-unreleased encore performances of &quot;Watcher of the Skies&quot; and &quot;The Musical Box&quot;. The box set will also include a new remaster of the album from the original 1974 mix, a Dolby ATMOS mix which was supervised by Peter Gabriel and Tony Banks, and several demos from the recording sessions.

Canadian tribute band The Musical Box has performed the album in its entirety on several tours using the slides from the original performances.

<text>Anthony Kenneth Blackburn (born 29 January 1943) is an English disc jockey, singer and television presenter, whose career spans 60 years. 

Blackburn first achieved fame broadcasting on the pirate stations Radio Caroline and Radio London in the 1960s, before joining the BBC, initially broadcasting on the BBC Light Programme. 

Blackburn was the first disc jockey to broadcast on BBC Radio 1 at its launch, on 30 September 1967, and has had several stints working for the corporation. He has also worked for Capital London, Classic Gold Digital and BBC Local Radio, and currently BBC Radio 2 and British Forces Broadcasting Service. He has also had a singing career. As a DJ, Blackburn is known for his championing of Motown and soul music as well as his popular presenting style.

In 2002, Blackburn was the first king of the jungle (winner) of the British reality TV series &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

==Early life==
Blackburn was born in Guildford, Surrey, on 29 January 1943, but in 1946 his family moved to Poole, Dorset, where his youngest sister, Jacqueline, was born. His sister was born suffering from polio and was unable to walk from birth. Blackburn&#x27;s father, Kenneth Fleming Blackburn, was a GP and his mother, Pauline Cubitt (née Stone), was a nurse. He was educated at Castle Court School in Corfe Mullen, near Poole in Dorset. He gained entry to Millfield in Somerset on a sports scholarship and captained the school&#x27;s cricket team.

Blackburn left before taking any examinations, but gained O-levels following private tuition, and enrolled for an HND course in business studies at Bournemouth Technical College.

==Career==
===Early career as disc jockey===
After beginning his career as a singer, Blackburn then worked as a DJ for the offshore pirate radio stations Radio Caroline and Radio London (1964–1967), before joining the BBC in the summer of 1967, initially broadcasting on the BBC Light Programme.

After a simulcast with BBC Radio 2 hosted by Paul Hollingdale, Blackburn was the first DJ to be heard on BBC Radio 1 when it officially launched at 7 am on 30 September 1967, with his first words on the new station being: &quot;And good morning everyone! Welcome to the exciting new sound of Radio 1!&quot; The Move&#x27;s &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot; was the first complete record he played. In a 2024 interview with Vernon Kay, Blackburn revealed that film of this scene had actually been recorded the previous day. Blackburn recalled in 2014: &quot;My job was to entertain and tell corny jokes, not have opinions or talk politics. If I wanted to wish the Queen a happy birthday, I had to get clearance from above.&quot; In the early years of his Radio 1 career Blackburn often employed an audio clip of a barking dog, &quot;Arnold&quot;, over an extract of Johnny Dankworth&#x27;s 1964 tune &quot;Beefeaters&quot;, which he had previously used at Radio Caroline and Radio London.

At first he was associated mainly with mainstream pop, but he later championed soul music. It was largely due to him that &quot;I&#x27;m Still Waiting&quot; by Diana Ross, which was initially just an album track, was released as a single in the UK in 1971 and reached number one. He was a regular host of &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; for more than a decade and he appeared with fellow DJs Noel Edmonds and Kenny Everett on the 500th show special where he performed the spoken part of &quot;Won&#x27;t Somebody Dance with Me&quot; and then danced with singer Lynsey de Paul.

In 1968, he fronted his own show, &quot;Time For Blackburn&quot;, produced by Southern Television for the ITV network. &quot;The Radio 1 DJs were a massive attraction. We were mobbed everywhere we went&quot;, Blackburn told Simon Hattenstone, referring to personal appearances. &quot;It was all a bit mad, but great fun&quot;, he told Judith Woods in 2014. &quot;The DJs were built up to be stars in our own right, and as a result we were as famous as the artists we played.&quot;

In 1973, when his pantomime performance was interrupted by a power cut, he said the miners should &quot;go back to work&quot;. He was admonished by management and taken off-air for two weeks. In an interview for the Radio Academy&#x27;s &quot;Radio Talk&quot; podcast in 2013, Blackburn said that it is &quot;not advisable&quot; for a broadcaster to reveal their political allegiances. In this interview, he said that he is &quot;not a great lover of the TUC or of unions ... but I keep it to myself now.&quot;

===Singing career===
He was in a group called Tony Blackburn and the Rovers which at one point included Al Stewart; they performed in Bournemouth and the surrounding areas. His singing career failed to take off, although three studio albums and fourteen singles were released, of which two, &quot;So Much Love&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Only Love&quot;, made the UK Top 40 in 1968 and 1969 respectively. &quot;So Much Love&quot; suffered from a shortage of copies because &quot;the pressing plant went on strike, so nobody could get the record&quot;, he once recalled. &quot;I don&#x27;t think the strike was anything to do with the record, though it might have been... quality control or something.&quot; 

In 1972, he released a self-titled album on the RCA label. Two of the tracks were released as singles: &quot;Chop Chop&quot;, written by Nicky Chinn and Mike Chapman, and &quot;House of Cards&quot;, written by Lynsey de Paul and Barry Green. His version of Doris Troy&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; was recorded in 1969 for his second album, &quot;Tony Blackburn&quot;, which was released on the Polydor label. This version of the Gamble and Huff song was re-discovered by Northern soul fans when it was pressed up as a white label and became a hit on the scene&#x27;s dancefloors. The single was re-released as a single under the pseudonym Lenny Gamble on Casino Classics in June 1978, with the pseudonym being a portmanteau of songwriters Leon Huff and Kenny Gamble. 

All of Blackburn&#x27;s singles, including &quot;I&#x27;ll Do Anything&quot; and &quot;House of Cards&quot; were released in 2012 on a CD compilation album &quot;The Singles Collection 1965–1980&quot; on the Cherry Red label.

===From 1973 to 1984===
In June 1973, he took over Jimmy Young&#x27;s mid-morning slot when Young moved across to Radio 2, where he introduced &quot;The Golden Hour&quot;. The feature was to prove durable, being carried on by Simon Bates, Simon Mayo, and Chris Moyles when they subsequently took over that time slot.

Over several years of the 1970s, Blackburn was a co-presenter on the BBC&#x27;s summer programme &quot;Seaside Special&quot;, alongside other well-known names from BBC Radio, such as Dave Lee Travis and David Hamilton. On 16 August 1975 he appeared singing &quot;Tie a Yellow Ribbon Round the Ole Oak Tree&quot;, with a lion tamer, in a cage of lions.
At the start of 1980 he took over from Ed Stewart as the presenter of &quot;Junior Choice&quot;, broadcast on Saturday and Sunday mornings from 8am to 10am, while continuing to present the Sunday chart show until the end of 1981. He was succeeded by Tommy Vance. During 1982, BBC Radio 1 dropped the name &quot;Junior Choice&quot; and the show became the &quot;Tony Blackburn&#x27;s Saturday Show&quot; and &quot;Tony Blackburn&#x27;s Sunday Show.&quot; Blackburn hosted both shows until his final show on 23 September 1984.

In addition to his Radio 1 weekend show, he joined BBC Radio London in 1981, where he presented the afternoon show. It was here that he showed his appreciation of soul music. &quot;Soul music is sexy music, raunchy music. I didn&#x27;t want it to be a niche thing, I wanted to bring it to a mass audience. I wanted cab drivers to listen to it because I think pop soul is fabulous, I do, really&quot;, he told Simon Hattenstone. He left the station after over 40 years in December 2023.

From the mid to late 1980s, Blackburn presented the show &quot;Soul Station&quot; on BFBS Radio.

Blackburn had a difficult relationship with fellow DJ John Peel, whom he recalled saying: &quot;&#x27;People don’t realise how much you’ve done for soul music&#x27;, and I said: &#x27;I bet you’d never say that publicly&#x27;, and he said: &#x27;Oh no!&#x27;&quot;

Having left Radio 1 after seventeen years of broadcasting, he took over Radio London&#x27;s weekday mid-morning show in 1984, playing a pure soul format.

===Later career===
He joined Capital London in 1988, and was involved in the launch of Capital Gold London station, presenting programmes such as the Breakfast show, Weekends, Drivetime then the Weekday evening show playing his own choice of music, where he remained until 2002. He hosted similar shows on Jazz FM in London and Smooth FM Smooth, and the Real Radio Network.

In 1987, Blackburn made an extended appearance on the second ever edition of &quot;After Dark&quot; on Channel 4. In 1989 Blackburn co-presented the morning TV show &quot;Sky by Day&quot; on Sky One. The show aired weekdays at 11:00 and was broadcast live.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 1992, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel while broadcasting his Capital Gold radio show at the company&#x27;s studios in London.

In 2002, Blackburn was the winner of the first series of the British reality TV show &quot;I&#x27;m a Celebrity...Get Me Out of Here!&quot;

In 2004, Blackburn re-joined BBC Radio London, originally taking over a two-hour timeslot on Monday evening from 20:00 to 22:00. Here he would be given free rein on his choice of music. In addition to this he also took over the station&#x27;s Saturday Lunchtime show, broadcasting from 12:00 to 14:00.

Blackburn began presenting the Breakfast show for Bedfordshire-based Classic Gold Digital in late 2003. He was suspended in June 2004 for playing too many Cliff Richard records as the singer was not on the station&#x27;s playlist. Noel Edmonds, whose company owned a majority shareholding, thought Blackburn would soon return to broadcasting for the station. The suspension was short-lived. Blackburn won his dispute with management over the playlist a few days later, and Cliff Richard was added to it. &quot;We should be playing him as much as The Beatles&quot;, said the station head. Whilst doing the Breakfast show, he left his Monday evening show on Radio London but continued to present Saturday Lunchtime.

&quot;I’m still a part of the disco generation,&quot; Blackburn told &quot;The Times&quot; in December 2004. &quot;There is no pretence there and it never seems to date. I think disco did much more as a contribution to music than Bob Dylan or Neil Young. People get snobbish about music. Disco never takes itself too seriously.&quot;

In early 2008, Blackburn took over Weekend Breakfast on Smooth Radio, originally broadcasting to London audiences only, but a couple of months later the show was networked across the Smooth Radio network.

On 6 November 2010, Blackburn replaced Dale Winton as the regular host of BBC Radio 2&#x27;s &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; programme. One of his remaining ambitions was to present a programme on Radio 2. &quot;I was 37 when I left Radio 1, and 2 seemed a natural progression. So it&#x27;s only taken 30 years&quot;, Blackburn said in 2010. Blackburn presented the show every Saturday from 13:00 to 15:00. He also presented shows on BBC Radio Berkshire from 22:00 to 01:00 on Fridays and Sundays, and BBC London 94.9 on Sundays from 12:00 to 15:00.

Between 2 July 2016 and June 2017, Blackburn presented a weekly four-hour soul music show, the &quot;Soul and Motown Show&quot;, every Saturday from 18:00 to 22:00 on London&#x27;s DAB station Thames Radio.

From 2007 to 2020, he presented a weekly three-hour show, &quot;Tony&#x27;s Blackburn&#x27;s Playlist&quot; every Sunday from 16:00 to 19:00 on KMFM in Kent. This included a retro chart feature for many years.

Blackburn has won two lifetime achievement awards from the Radio Academy, the second of which was to mark his 50 years of broadcasting.

In 2023, Blackburn launched the digital music channel That&#x27;s 60s, focusing on 1960s music. He chose &quot;Flowers in the Rain&quot; as the first song to be played, similar to Radio 1.

In October 2024 he was featured in BBC&#x27;s &quot;Mortimer &amp; Whitehouse: Gone Fishing&quot;.

===BBC dismissal and return===
On 24 February 2016, Blackburn was dismissed by the BBC in an announcement from Lord Hall, the corporation&#x27;s Director General, stating that the contents of documents from the early 1970s were in conflict with evidence Blackburn had given to Dame Janet Smith&#x27;s inquiry into Jimmy Savile&#x27;s sexual abuse at BBC premises. Blackburn said he repeatedly told Smith and the BBC that he had never been interviewed about an alleged incident in the 1970s and that Smith&#x27;s report made no suggestion that he was guilty of any misconduct whatsoever. Smith found Blackburn&#x27;s denial that he was interviewed by light entertainment head Bill Cotton and Sir Brian Neill QC unsatisfactory. Neill had been appointed by the BBC to look into unrelated matters concerning &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. Cotton&#x27;s colleague, Tony Preston, had written a memo at the time concerning the interviews. Neill, the only one of the three men still alive, initially declined to comment, but later said he had interviewed Blackburn and in 1972, had cleared him of wrongdoing.

Blackburn complained that the BBC was dismissing him and damaging his career based on the discrepancy. He said that like Smith&#x27;s report, a coroner&#x27;s inquest and a police inquiry had made no suggestion that he was guilty of any misconduct, adding that the report was a &quot;whitewash&quot; and that he had been &quot;scapegoated&quot; for giving his best recollections of events 45 years before. He asked: &quot;Given Dame Janet Smith&#x27;s concerns of a culture of fear in coming forward at the BBC, what whistle-blower at the BBC would ever come forward when they see the way they have hung me out to dry?&quot; He said he intended to take legal action against the BBC.

Nina Myskow commented on Radio 2: &quot;It should be a sad black day for the BBC because of the revelations about the whole Savile episode, but in fact that&#x27;s been buried very cleverly by the BBC as usual by sacking Tony Blackburn.&quot;

Blackburn continued to present a show on KMFM. A spokesman for the station said, &quot;He is a great asset, a fantastic broadcaster and someone we are proud to work with.&quot;

In October 2016, it was reported that Blackburn would again be working for the BBC, presenting an hour-long programme on BBC Radio 2 on Friday evenings, and additionally returning to BBC Local Radio. He returned to BBC Radio 2 on New Year&#x27;s Eve 2016, and to BBC Local Radio on both New Year&#x27;s Day and 6 January 2017, opening with Gloria Gaynor&#x27;s &quot;I Will Survive&quot;.

Blackburn now presents &quot;Sounds of the 60s&quot; on Radio 2, having taken over on 4 March 2017 from Brian Matthew, who hosted it for 27 years. The show is now broadcast live on Saturday mornings between 06:00 and 08:00, and he now also presents his Golden Hour music programme on Sunday nights.

On 30 September 2017, Blackburn recreated his first Radio 1 breakfast show on BBC Radio 2, playing the songs from vinyl, and he later joined Nick Grimshaw, and guests Mike Read, Simon Mayo and Sara Cox for a special show to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the launches of Radio 1 and Radio 2.

In 2020, Blackburn teamed up with Kaiser Chiefs frontman Ricky Wilson to present a new series of podcasts entitled &quot;Ricky and Tony&#x27;s Pop Detectives&quot;. The shows centre around Blackburn and Wilson trying to unravel long-held myths and rumours about pop stars&#x27; lives and their music. The first episode centred around whether Debbie Harry had really been in a car with serial killer Ted Bundy, as she had previously claimed. The series was released to positive reviews and a further series was released in the summer of 2020.

On 2 January 2023, in the month in which he celebrated his 80th birthday, Blackburn presented a two-hour slot, &quot;Your Soul Mate&quot; for BBC Radio 2, sharing his favourite genre of music and his personal memories associated with the playlist.

==Personal life==
In 1972, Blackburn married actress Tessa Wyatt. The couple had a son, who was born on 8 April 1973, but they divorced in November 1977 after separating the previous year. In June 1992, he married Debbie, a theatrical agent. They have a daughter, who was born in 1997. He has two grandsons.

Blackburn has been a vegetarian since he was four. He lives in Arkley, London Borough of Barnet.

In April 2023, Blackburn took a leave of absence from his radio work and other work commitments. Whilst working in Milton Keynes he felt unwell and on returning home, he collapsed and was admitted to hospital with a chest infection; he fully recovered and resumed his radio work.

==Honours==
Blackburn was appointed Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2024 New Year Honours for services to broadcasting and charity.

<text>Georg Michaelis (8 September 1857 – 24 July 1936) was the imperial chancellor of the German Empire for a few months in 1917. He was the first (and, in the German Empire, the only) commoner to hold the post. With an economic background in business, Michaelis&#x27; main achievement was to encourage the ruling classes to open peace talks with Russia. Contemplating that the end of the war was near, he encouraged infrastructure development to facilitate recovery at war&#x27;s end through the media of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot;. A somewhat humourless character, known for process engineering, Michaelis was faced with insurmountable problems of logistics and supply in his brief period as chancellor.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Michaelis, born in Haynau in the Prussian Province of Silesia, grew up in Frankfurt (Oder). He studied jurisprudence at the University of Breslau, the University of Leipzig and the University of Würzburg from 1876 to 1884, becoming a Doctor of Laws.

From 1885-89, he lived and worked in Tokyo, Japan as a law professor of the Law School of the Society for German Sciences.

After his return to Germany, he became a member of the Prussian administration. In 1909 he was appointed as undersecretary of state to the Prussian Treasury in Berlin. From 1915 onward, he headed the Imperial Grain Office, which was responsible for the administration of Prussian corn and wheat during World War I.

===Chancellor===
After the Reichstag and the High Command (OHL) forced the resignation of Theobald von Bethmann Hollweg on 10 or 13 July 1917, Michaelis emerged as the surprise candidate for both chancellor of Germany and Minister President of Prussia. Army commander Paul von Hindenburg agreed because Michaelis was the army&#x27;s man.

He had visited the OHL on several occasions in his position as Undersecretary of State in the Prussian Ministry of Finance and Commissioner of Food Supplies, when his brusque manner had made a good impression on staff officers present. “The truth was that anyone more radical than Bethmann would have been unacceptable to the High Command as Chancellor, while anyone more reactionary would have been unacceptable to the Reichstag; the only way out was to choose a nonentity.”

Michaelis was described as &quot;Germany&#x27;s first bourgeois chancellor&quot;, as he was the only non-titled person to serve as chief minister during the Hohenzollern monarchy&#x27;s 400-year rule over Prussia and Germany.
But the forces of the German General Staff remained in control behind the scenes.

On 19 July, the Reichstag passed Erzberger&#x27;s Peace Resolution for &quot;a peace without annexations or indemnities&quot;, after the Chancellor&#x27;s speech had &quot;devalued&quot; the resolution. The inability of the government to impose controls on rising prices, demands for wage increases, strikes, and mounting economic chaos, drove the &quot;political fixers&quot; towards a military takeover of the reins of power. The Kaiser wanted a chancellor who could manage the Reichstag, and the army wanted a chancellor who would bring about a &quot;German Peace&quot;. 

On 25 July 1917, Michaelis told the crown prince that the devil was in the detail; &quot;I have deprived it of its most dangerous features by my interpretation of it. One can make any peace one likes with this resolution&quot;, he reassured the heir to the throne. But it was a feint, and Michaelis’ role in the discreditable episode was designed to facilitate a permanent closure of the Reichstag. 

The army perceived the majority parties as posing a threat to stability in Germany in the wake of the Bolshevik Revolution had brought an end to the Russian war effort. But this had left him very &quot;uncertain&quot; as to the place of the Central Powers. Knowing Austro-Hungary was bankrupted by the fighting, he understood their demand to sue for peace; but the military was unwilling to relinquish any power to the civilian authorities. The OHL hoped to destabilize Ukraine and the Baltic States so as to bring Russia&#x27;s ailing Tsarist regime to the negotiations, while guaranteeing Germanic frontiers, in more than Michaelis&#x27; &quot;status quo ante bellum&quot;. 

But Michaelis was a pragmatist and a realist, whatever the Kaiser might have believed about military victory.

The Chancellor chaired the Second Kreuznach Conference discussing the fate of Alsace-Lorraine on 14 August 1917.

The proposal included one for an integrated Federal State coupled to socio-economic changes connecting the Prussian-Hessian railways across Germany. Alsace&#x27;s connectivity was an extension of a war aims policy via Aachen into the Belgian occupied zones and across neutral Netherlands, as had already been achieved in Luxembourg. Longwiy was the centre of German Steel Association&#x27;s industry. Located on the border of Belgium and Lorraine, it was at the contractual nexus of the Low Countries adjacent to the Dutch treaty town of Maastricht. German industrialists, including Thyssen and Krupp, wanted a guaranteed supply of coal from France and return to an answer to the Belgian Question, which monopolised the thinkers on the Western Front.

On 29 August, it was in light of the Longwy-Briey Plan railway carriage meeting near Aachen that he was given &quot;an impossible task&quot; of perpetuating the war for &quot;another ten years&quot;. But the economic plan &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; depended on the Quadruple Alliance which was in trouble. The brains behind the second conference was the new Secretary of State, Max von Kuhlmann, with Czernin and Hohenlohe (Austria) chaired in chamber by Michaelis. But he underestimated Britain&#x27;s economic determination to stay the course until the bitter end.

The unenviable task to spell out the myth of a German victory fell to Michaelis, still obliged to the Kaiser and OHL in a report to the Conference.

In the end the government won over the Reichstag with only one small party outstanding in its continual opposition to the plan. The Fatherland Party and the OHL, now under Ludendorff, demanded a rigorous pro-Kaiser pursuance of a Rumanian-Germany. Bessarabia, a rich and fertile agricultural basin, was ripe for the Central Powers to pick. Michaelis was sceptical of OHL&#x27;s avowal of the closest relationship with Austria when another conference was called for 7 October. Still dominated by the obsession with seaports for the Reich, Michaelis demanded access in Dalmatia from the Austrians, as well as those on the Belgian coast. Through the vehicle of &quot;Mitteleuropa&quot; he sought to enable the Austrian economy to withstand the peace conditions he knew would be imposed on the German customs union.

But the candidate chosen as the new Chancellor was the Army&#x27;s and not that of the Reichstag. &quot;We have lost a statesman and secured a functionary in his place&quot;, remarked Conrad Haussmann, a member of the Reichstag from the Progressive People&#x27;s Party.

===Decline===
In August, the naval mutinies at Wilhelmshaven led to executions. Michaelis blamed the socialists in the Reichstag hoping to split the coalition. But the Reichstag demanded his resignation. On 24 October 1917 the National Liberals three socialist parties in the coalition made representations to the Kaiser. In his autobiography he laid the blame on his own refusal to bend to pressure for liberal electoral reforms. The deputies hoped to replace him with a Centre Party aristocrat, Georg von Hertling.

He remained in this position until 1 November 1917, when he was forced to resign after coming under fire for refusing to commit himself by endorsing a resolution passed by the Reichstag favouring peace without annexation or indemnities. Michaelis attempted to retain his role as Prussian Minister President, but without success as Count Hertling was determined that the two posts could not be separated. 

===Late life and death===
From 1 April 1918 to 31 March 1919 he served as &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; of the Prussian province of Pomerania. After the end of World War I, he cooperated with the local workers&#x27; and soldiers&#x27; council. Nevertheless, the socialist-dominated government of Prussia soon replaced him.

Michaelis worked in the fields of economic lobbying, in student organizations, in the synod of the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union and became a member of the monarchist/national conservative German National People&#x27;s Party (DNVP). In 1921, he published his memoirs, &quot;Für Staat und Volk. Eine Lebensgeschichte&quot; (For State and People. A Life Story).

Georg Michaelis died on 24 July 1936 in Bad Saarow-Pieskow (Brandenburg) at the age of 78.

<doc id="264535" wikidata="Q7267779" url="?curid=264535" title="QinetiQ 1">
<text>QinetiQ 1 was a balloon designed to set a new world altitude record for manned balloon flight of around 40 km (25 miles, 132,000 feet). The balloon was named after the main sponsor, QinetiQ (formerly part of DERA, the British Defence Evaluation and Research Agency).

The immense 381 m high zero-pressure balloon was constructed from 5,000 kg of polyethylene. The lift gas used for the balloon was helium. At the anticipated flight ceiling, the balloon&#x27;s volume would have been 1.25 million m3 (40 million ft3). The two pilots, Andy Elson and Colin Prescot, were to occupy an open deck, relying on Zvezda-manufactured Sokol space suits to keep them alive during the anticipated twelve-hour flight.

The attempt was originally planned for 2002, but adverse high altitude conditions halted attempts in that year. The launch site for the twelve-hour flight was decided to be off the coast of Cornwall.

In 2003 the launch was initially set to take place on 2 September from the deck of RV Triton off the coast of St Ives. Early that morning, it was decided to postpone the launch for 24 hours due to cloud cover at high altitude. The following morning an attempt was made to inflate the balloon. At around 6.55 with the balloon inflated to a height of 15 metres, helium began to escape from the envelope. An irreparable tear was discovered along one of the seams of the balloon, and all efforts for a flight in 2003 were abandoned.

== Other record attempts ==
The current balloon flight record was set by Malcolm Ross (USNR) and Victor Prather (USN), who took the &quot;Strato-Lab V&quot; balloon to 34,668 m (113,740 ft) on 4 May 1961 above the Gulf of Mexico. The balloonists landed successfully, but Victor Prather slipped from the helicopter lift harness while being transferred to a waiting aircraft carrier, and he drowned before US Navy divers could rescue him. Nicholas Piantanida, while attempting to set a new skydiving jump record, is claimed to have reached 123,800 feet (37.73 km) on 2 February 1966. Piantanida was unable to disconnect his breathing apparatus from the gondola, so the ground crew jettisoned the balloon at the flight ceiling. Piantanida&#x27;s attempt did not set a flight record because he descended without the balloon.

<doc id="264540" wikidata="Q1195374" url="?curid=264540" title="Syntax error">
<text>In computer science, a syntax error is an error in the syntax of a sequence of characters that is intended to be written in a particular programming language.

For compiled languages, syntax errors are detected at compile-time. A program will not compile until all syntax errors are corrected. For interpreted languages, a syntax error may be detected during program execution, and an interpreter&#x27;s error messages might not differentiate syntax errors from errors of other kinds.

There is some disagreement as to just what errors are &quot;syntax errors&quot;. For example, some would say that the use of an uninitialized variable&#x27;s value in Java code is a syntax error, but many others would disagree and would classify this as a (static) semantic error.

In 8-bit home computers that used BASIC interpreter as their primary user interface, the error message became somewhat notorious, as this was the response to any command or user input the interpreter could not parse.
A syntax error can occur or take place, when an invalid equation is being typed on a calculator. This can be caused, for instance, by opening brackets without closing them, or less commonly, entering several decimal points in one number.

In Java the following is a syntactically correct statement:
:System.out.println(&quot;Hello World&quot;);

while the following is not:

The second example would theoretically print the variable codice_1 instead of the words &quot;Hello World&quot;. A variable in Java cannot have a space in between, so the syntactically correct line would be codice_2.

A compiler will flag a syntax error when given source code that does not meet the requirements of the language&#x27;s grammar.

Type errors (such as an attempt to apply the ++ increment operator to a Boolean variable in Java) and undeclared variable errors are sometimes considered to be syntax errors when they are detected at compile-time. It is common to classify such errors as (static) semantic errors instead.

==Syntax errors on calculators==

A syntax error is one of several types of errors on calculators (most commonly found on scientific calculators and graphing calculators), representing that the equation that has been input has incorrect syntax of numbers, operations and so on. It can result in various ways, including but not limited to:
*An open bracket without closing parenthesis (unless missing closing parenthesis is at very end of equation)
*Using minus sign instead of negative symbol (or vice versa), which are distinct on most scientific calculators. Note that while some scientific calculators allow a minus sign to stand in for a negative symbol, the reverse is less common.

<text>Joseph Boniface de La Môle (c. 1526 – 30 April 1574) was a French nobleman. He was the son of Jacques Boniface, seigneur de la Môle et de Colobrières, of Marseille.

==Life==
La Môle was the Provençal lover of Marguerite de Valois, among others, during the early part of her marriage to King Henry III of Navarre, the future king of France (Henry IV).

He served François, Duke of Anjou and Alençon, Marguerite&#x27;s brother and youngest son of King Henry II of France and Catherine de&#x27; Medici. He represented the Duc d&#x27;Alençon during marriage negotiations with Queen Elizabeth I of England in 1572. In 1574 he was implicated in a Malcontent conspiracy against the reigning king, Charles IX, who was gravely ill, supported by the duke of Alençon. He was accused of making an attempt on the king&#x27;s life when a wax figurine pricked with needles, which he had obtained from the astrologer Cosimo Ruggeri, was found in his possession. After being subjected to questioning and torture, he was condemned to death. He was quartered and beheaded at the Place de Grève in Paris with his co-conspirator, . It has been rumoured that Marguerite embalmed la Môle&#x27;s head and kept it in a jewelled casket.

==In popular culture==
William Shakespeare seems to have heard of the incident. In Act IV, scene I of 2 Henry VI, the character William de la Pole, Duke of Suffolk and lover of Queen Margaret, is beheaded. In scene iv, Margaret brings his head to a conference at the palace, where she weeps over and embraces it.

A major character of Alexandre Dumas&#x27;s novel &quot;La Reine Margot&quot;, la Môle is transformed into Joseph-Hyacinthe Boniface de Lerac de la Mole, a Protestant nobleman saved by Queen Marguerite during the St. Bartholomew&#x27;s Day massacre. The figure who was saved after stumbling into the Queen&#x27;s bed chamber was not, in fact, la Môle, who took part in the Massacre, but rather was a gentleman named M. de Teian.

Fictional descendants of La Môle also feature prominently in Stendhal&#x27;s novel &quot;The Red and the Black&quot;.

He is portrayed by Swiss actor Vincent Pérez in the film &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; and Dmitry Kharatyan in the Russian miniseries &quot;La Reine Margot&quot; (&quot;Королева Марго&quot; (1996)).

<doc id="264545" wikidata="Q706029" url="?curid=264545" title="Whyalla">
<text>Whyalla is a city in South Australia. It was founded as Hummock&#x27;s Hill, and was known by that name until 1916. It is the fourth most populous city in the Australian state of South Australia after Adelaide, Mount Gambier, and Gawler, and along with Port Pirie and Port Augusta is one of the three towns to make up the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot;. It is a seaport located on the east coast of the Eyre Peninsula and is known as the &quot;Steel City&quot; due to its integrated steelworks and shipbuilding heritage. The Whyalla Steelworks is the major employer in the town, and has in February 2025 been put into voluntary administration by the Government of South Australia. The port of Whyalla has been exporting iron ore since 1903.

==Description==
The city consists of an urban area bounded to the north by the railway to the mining town of Iron Knob, to the east by Spencer Gulf, and to the south by the Lincoln Highway. The urban area consists of the following suburbs laid from east to west extending from a natural hill known as Hummock Hill: Whyalla, Whyalla Playford, Whyalla Norrie, Whyalla Stuart, and Whyalla Jenkins. A port facility, a rail yard serving the railway line to Iron Knob, and an industrial complex are located to the immediate north of Hummock Hill. Whyalla Barson and the Whyalla Conservation Park are located about north of the city. It is an iron-rich exporting town that supplies China.

== Nomenclature ==
The origin of the name Whyalla is disputed. In 1916 it was referred to as the &quot;native&quot; name, having been ascribed during a survey conducted a few years beforehand. During the 1940s, Norman Tindale, the ethnologist at the South Australian Museum believed that the name could have been derived from aboriginal words &quot;Wajala&quot;, meaning &quot;west&quot; in a language common to Port Pirie, or &quot;Waiala&quot;, meaning &quot;I don&#x27;t know&quot; in a language more common to Port Augusta. In 1945, BHP advised that the name had been taken from nearby Mount Whyalla, which lies northwest of Whyalla, roughly midway between the town and Iron Knob. Other meanings ascribed to the word Whyalla include &quot;dingo&quot;, &quot;by the water&quot;, and &quot;a place of water&quot;. Another hypothesis is that the name was brought by European settlers and was derived from a place called Whyalla in Durham, England.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Whyalla is part of the Barngarla Aboriginal country.

A mariner named William Morgan Burgoyne purportedly recommended the site for the establishment of a port on False Bay to Harry Morgan of BHP. Burgoyne had spent several weeks there on a trip out from Port Augusta hunting kangaroo with his brother and another man called Alf Rowarth. At that time there was no settlement between Middleback Station and the Point Lowly Lighthouse, and kangaroos were plentiful there.

Burgoyne recalled that the tug &quot;Florrie&quot; ferried a crew there a week later and pegged out the settlement first known as Hummocky. 

=== 20th century ===
Whyalla was founded as &quot;Hummock&#x27;s Hill&quot;, and was known by that name until 1916. It was officially founded as Hummock&#x27;s Hill in 1901 by the BHP Whyalla Tramway, which transported iron ore from Iron Knob in the Middleback Range to the sea. Its first shipment was transported across Spencer Gulf to Port Pirie, where it was used in lead smelters as a flux. A jetty was built to transfer the ore and the first shipment was sent in 1903. The early settlement consisted of small cottages and tents clustered around the base of the hill. The post office opened in 1901 as Hummock&#x27;s Hill.

In 1905 the town&#x27;s first school opened. It was originally called Hummock Hill School but was subsequently renamed to Whyalla Primary School and Whyalla Higher Primary School. The school&#x27;s current name is Whyalla Town Primary School.

The arid environment and lack of natural fresh water resources made it necessary to import water in barges from Port Pirie.

The Post Office was renamed Whyalla on 1 November 1919, and on 16 April 1920 the town was officially proclaimed with its new name. The ore conveyor on the jetty was improved, and the shipping of ore to the newly built Newcastle Steelworks commenced. The town grew slowly prior to the development of steelmaking and shipbuilding facilities in the late 1930s.

The &quot;BHP Indenture Act&quot; was proclaimed in 1937 and provided the impetus for the construction of a blast furnace and harbour. In 1939 the blast furnace and harbour began to be constructed and a commitment for a water supply pipeline from the Murray River was made. A shipyard was built to provide ships for the Royal Australian Navy during World War II. The population began to rise rapidly and many new facilities, including a hospital and abattoirs, were built.

In 1941 the first ship from the new shipyard, , was launched and the blast furnace became operational. By 1943 the population was more than 5,000. On 31 March 1943, the Morgan - Whyalla pipeline became operational. In 1945 the city came under combined company and public administration and the shipyard began producing commercial ships. In 1948, displaced persons began arriving from Europe increasing the cultural diversity of Whyalla.

In 1958 BHP decided to build an integrated steelworks at Whyalla and it was completed in 1965. In the following year, salt harvesting began and coke ovens were built. The population grew extremely rapidly, and the South Australian Housing Trust was building 500 houses each year to cope with the demand. Plans for a city of 100,000 were produced by the Department of Lands. A second water supply pipeline from Morgan was built to cope with the demand.

In 1970 the city adopted full local government status. Fierce competition from Japanese ship builders resulted in the closing of the shipyards in 1978, which were at the time the largest in Australia. From a peak population of 38,130 in 1976, the population dropped rapidly. A decline in the BHP iron and steel industry since 1981 also impacted employment.

=== 21st century ===
The BHP long products division was divested in 2000 to form OneSteel, which is the sole producer of rail and steel sleepers in Australia. On 2 July 2012, OneSteel changed its name to Arrium. After going into administration in 2016 Arrium was purchased by UK entity GFG Alliance with the steelworks placed under Liberty Steel Group and called Liberty Primary Steel and Mining. 

From 2004 onward, northern South Australia enjoyed a mineral exploration boom, and Whyalla found itself well placed to benefit from new ventures, being situated on the edge of the Gawler Craton. The city experienced an economic upturn with the population slowly increasing and the unemployment rate falling to a more typical level.

===Heritage listings===

Whyalla has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:

* Broadbent Terrace: Whyalla High School
* 13 Forsyth Street: Hotel Bay View, Whyalla
* 5 Forsyth Street: Spencer Hotel, Whyalla
* Gay Street: World War Two Gun Emplacements, Hummock Hill
* 3 Whitehead Street: Whyalla Court House

== Port ==

Since its beginnings as Hummock Hill, the town has served as a port for the shipment of iron ore from deposits along the Middleback Range.

The port&#x27;s first conveyor-belt loading system was installed in 1915 and was capable of loading 1,000 tonnes of ore per hour. In 1943, it took 5½-to-6 hours to load a single 5,000-ton freighter.

In 2007, new transshipment handling processes were implemented, which allowed Arrium (formerly Onesteel) to load iron ore onto larger capesize bulk carrier vessels in deeper water. The transshipment process involves filling barges with ore that is then transferred into the receiving vessels at one of three transshipment anchorages.

In the financial year 2014–15, 12.5 million tonnes of haematite ore was exported from Whyalla using the transshipment process.

In October 2015 Arrium loaded its largest capesize cargo via transshipment. The FPMCB Nature was loaded with approximately 205,698 wet metric tonnes (wmt) of iron ore – significantly more than the average load of about 170,000 wmt.

The port&#x27;s inner harbour receives shipments of coal that is used to produce coke for the Whyalla steelworks and exports smaller cargoes of finished steel products.

==Economy and energy==
===Whyalla Steelworks===

Much of the town&#x27;s economy is centred around the Whyalla Steelworks.

After changes of ownership from BHP to its spin-off Arrium, which went into voluntary administration in 2017, the steelworks were bought by Liberty Steel Group, a subsidiary of the British-based international company GFG Alliance. On 20 February 2025, the federal government under Anthony Albanese announced a $2.4 billion joint state-federal support package for Whyalla and its steelworks, after GFG had got into financial difficulties and own tens of millions of dollars to its suppliers.

===Energy===
Santos has supplied gas to the steelworks for several years, and in February 2024 signed an MoU with GFG Alliance to start discussions to reduce emissions from the steelworks.

The Whyalla Hydrogen Facility (WHF, aka Hydrogen Jobs Plan) is a proposed 250MWe hydrogen electrolyser (producing green hydrogen), a 200MW combined cycle gas turbine generator, and 3600-tonne hydrogen storage facility. A South Australian Government company called Hydrogen Power South Australia was established to own and operate the plant, which is expected to be completed in 2025 and begin operations in 2026. ATCO Australia, BOC, and Epic Energy will deliver the plan. in which the government has invested million. In February 2024, the government signed an agreement with GFG Alliance reaching &quot;to explore opportunities for hydrogen offtake&quot; from the WHF.

Once it is up and running, it will supply power to the steelworks, which will then produce green steel.

== Geography ==

== Transport==

===Road=== 
The Lincoln Highway passes directly through Whyalla. The city is served by a coach bus service operated by Stateliner which operates four services to and from Adelaide (via Port Augusta) each week day (less on weekends) and one service each way to Port Lincoln. There are however occasional exceptions to the week day route due to lack of demand to travel through Whyalla.

===Rail===
The BHP Whyalla Tramway was built to Iron Knob to supply iron ore originally used as flux when smelting copper ore. This ore became the basis of the steelworks. As the Iron Knob deposits were worked out, the railway was diverted to other sources of ore at Iron Monarch, Iron Prince, Iron Duke and Iron Baron.

To enable interchange between the BHP&#x27;s other steelworks in Newcastle and Port Kembla of specialised rollingstock, the railway system within the Whyalla steelworks was converted to standard gauge in the 1960s.

Although the steelworks produced railway rail, for several decades there was no railway connection to the mainland system. Finally in 1972, the standard gauge Whyalla line to Port Augusta was completed and Whyalla railway station opened. The station was served daily from Adelaide until 1975, then again from 1986 to 1990 by the &quot;Iron Triangle Limited&quot;. The station was demolished in 2012.

Some iron ore is exported from Whyalla. In 2007, steps were being taken to export iron ore mined at Peculiar Knob near Coober Pedy, 600 km away. To meet this increased demand, a balloon loop was installed in 2012 at the port for both gauges.

===Air===
Whyalla Airport is southwest of the city. It was served by Rex Airlines flying into Whyalla from Adelaide it served the airport several times a day however due to passenger security screening charges Rex Airlines ceased flying into Whyalla on 1 July 2023, and QantasLink which operates twice daily services from Adelaide.

===Sea=== 
There is a small boat marina (populated by a number of dolphins), a sailing club, and a boat ramp on the coastline below Hummock Hill, where there is a fish-cleaning station situated nearby. Iron ore is exported through an off-shore facility.

==Media==
Whyalla is served by several radio and TV stations. Radio stations include 5YYY FM (Local community station), Magic FM (Commercial station based in Port Augusta), and 5AU/5CS (Commercial station based in Port Pirie). The local TV stations are Southern Cross Seven, Southern Cross Nine, and Southern Cross 10.

The local newspaper, &quot;The&quot; &quot;Whyalla News&quot;&quot;,&quot; was first published on 5 April 1940, and is currently owned by Australian Community Media. Historically, another short-lived monthly newspaper called the &quot;Whyalla Times&quot; (January - October 1960) was also printed for the town by E.J. McAllister and Co., from its premises in Blythe Street, Adelaide. Another publication called &quot;Scope&quot; (May 1973–November 1982) was also printed in the town. According to the State Library, &quot;Scope was a monthly regional magazine in newspaper format published by the Willson family of the Whyalla News. It was issued as an insert to six local newspapers: the Recorder (Port Pirie), Transcontinental (Port Augusta), Eyre Peninsula Tribune (Cleve), Port Lincoln Times, West Coast Sentinel (Streaky Bay) and Northern Argus (Clare).&quot;

==Tourism==
The industrial and cultural history of Whyalla is accessible to tourists via several museums and public tours.

Visitors can view the ex-HMAS &quot;Whyalla&quot; from the Lincoln Highway and take a guided tour of it via the Whyalla Maritime Museum. The ship is a retired World War II-era corvette and was the first ship built in the city of Whyalla during the war. It was relocated to the highway in 1987. The Whyalla Maritime Museum features various displays commemorating the town&#x27;s ship building and mining history, including miniature replicas of various ships and a model railway diorama. Further displays introduce visitors to the region&#x27;s natural and indigenous cultural histories.

Tours of the Whyalla Steelworks allow visitors to view the production of long products at the working plant. Tours depart from the Whyalla Visitors Centre.

The town&#x27;s development and social history is presented at the volunteer-run Mount Laura Homestead National Trust Museum, which is located near the Westlands shopping centre.

One of the main tourist attractions of Whyalla is the world-renowned beach, and the many attractions based around it. Especially the shops and pop-ups in the car park.

=== Ecotourism ===
In the late 1990s the annual migration of the Australian giant cuttlefish &quot;Sepia apama&quot; to shallow, inshore rocky reef areas in Spencer Gulf north of Whyalla became recognised by divers and marine scientists. Divers and snorkellers can see the aggregation of animals from May through August each year, in water one to six metres deep. The most popular places to view the aggregation are Black Point, Stony Point and Point Lowly. Car parking and boardwalks or stairs to the waters edge are present at each location, making access easy.

Dolphins frequent the Whyalla marina, but concerns have been raised that their confidence around humans may increase their vulnerability.

The Whyalla Conservation Park provides an example of the natural semi-arid environment accessible via walking trails. A gentle climb to the top of Wild Dog Hill provides a view of the surrounding landscape and information on native vegetation via a series of interpretive signs.

=== Fishing ===

Boat launching facilities exist at Whyalla and Point Lowly North marinas. The Whyalla Marina also has a jetty which is illuminated at night for the convenience of fishers.

Whyalla was home to an annual Snapper Fishing Competition. The largest of its kind and renowned for attracting tourists and fisherman from all over Australia, if not the world. However, due to major over fishing, a blanket ban was put in place to help population growth until 30 June 2026. Subsequently, the annual fishing competition was closed.

==Politics==

==Sister cities==
Whyalla&#x27;s sister city is Texas City, Texas. It was proclaimed in 1984, during the sesquicentennials of both Texas and South Australia.

Ties with a former sister city, Ezhou in China, were cut in the 1990s. In 1997, both cities signed an agreement reestablishing their sister city relationship.

<text>The bufflehead (Bucephala albeola) is a small sea duck of the genus &quot;Bucephala&quot;, the goldeneyes. It breeds in Alaska and Canada and migrates in winter to southern North America. This species was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Anas albeola&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The bufflehead was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas albeola&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;little black and white duck&quot; that had been described in 1747 by the English naturalist George Edwards in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. Edwards examined a specimen from Newfoundland provided by the archivist George Holmes (archivist), the deputy Keeper of Records in the Tower of London. Linnaeus specified the type locality as America, but this has been restricted to Newfoundland following Edwards. The bufflehead is now placed with two goldeneye species in the genus &quot;Bucephala&quot; that was introduced in 1858 by the American naturalist Spencer Baird. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name is derived from Ancient Greek , , from , and , , a reference to the oddly bulbous head shape of the species. The species name &quot;albeola&quot; is a diminutive of Latin meaning .

==Description==
The bufflehead ranges from long and weighs , with the drakes larger than the females. Averaging and , it rivals the green-winged teal as the smallest American duck. The bufflehead has a wingspan of 21.6 in (55 cm).

Adult males are striking black and white, with iridescent green and purple heads and a large white patch behind the eye. Females are grey-toned with a smaller white patch behind the eye and a light underside.

==Distribution and habitat==
They are migratory and most of them winter in protected coastal waters, or open inland waters, on the east and west coasts of North America and the southern United States. They can also be observed wintering on the Great Lakes. The bufflehead is an extremely rare vagrant to western Europe. Their breeding habitat is wooded lakes and ponds in Alaska and Canada, almost entirely included in the boreal forest or taiga habitat. From 1966 – 2015, the bufflehead experienced a &gt;1.5% yearly population increase throughout its breeding range.

==Behavior==

Buffleheads have evolved their small size to fit the nesting cavity of their &quot;metabiotic&quot; host, a woodpecker, the northern flicker. Due to their small size, they are highly active, undertaking dives almost continuously while sustained by their high metabolism. They do not tend to collect in large flocks; groups are usually limited to small numbers. One duck serves as a sentry, watching for predators as the others in the group dive in search of food. Buffleheads are amongst the last waterfowl to leave their breeding grounds and one of the world&#x27;s most punctual migrants, arriving on their wintering grounds within a narrow margin of time.

===Breeding===
Buffleheads are monogamous, and the females may return to the same nest site, year after year. They nest in cavities in trees, primarily aspens or poplars, using mostly old flicker nests, close (usually &lt; ) to water. Nest competitors include mountain bluebird (&quot;Sialia currucoides&quot;), tree swallow (&quot;Tachycineta bicolor&quot;), and European starling. There was one recorded instance of a female Barrow&#x27;s goldeneye killing a bufflehead adult female and her brood. Smaller cavities are preferred because of less competition with the larger goldeneyes. Females may be killed on the nest by mammals, such as foxes (&quot;Vulpes&quot; and &quot;Urocyon&quot; sp.), weasels (&quot;Mustela&quot; and &quot;Neogale&quot; sp.) or mink (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), and by goldeneyes over nest competition.

Average clutch size is nine (range six to 11), and eggs average . Incubation averages 30 days, and nest success is high (79% in one study) compared to ground-nesting species like the teal. A day after the last duckling hatches, the brood leaps from the nest cavity. The young fledge at 50–55 days of age. Predators of adults include the peregrine falcon (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), snowy owl (&quot;Bubo scandiacus&quot;), bald eagle (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), golden eagle (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;), red-tailed hawk (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), and Cooper&#x27;s hawk (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;).

===Diet===
These diving birds forage underwater. They prefer water depths of . In freshwater habitats, they eat primarily insects, and in saltwater, they feed predominantly on crustaceans and mollusks. Aquatic plants and fish eggs can often become locally important food items, as well.

==Relationship with humans==
Because of their striking plumage, highly active nature, and proximity to humans on waterfront properties, buffleheads are one of the most popular birds amongst bird watchers. The bufflehead, also known as the spirit duck, was added to the coat of arms of the town of Sidney, British Columbia, in 1995. Buffleheads are hunted and are considered a gamebird. In contrast to many other seaducks that have declined in recent decades, bufflehead numbers have remained relatively constant. Habitat degradation is the major threat to this bird, since they depend on very limited coastal habitat on their wintering grounds, and very specific habitat in their boreal breeding grounds. Although buffleheads do use man-made nest boxes, they still need the forest habitat to thrive.

<text>Bruce Wayne Campbell (December 14, 1946 – August 3, 1983), known by his stage name Jobriath, was an American rock musician and actor. He was the first openly gay rock musician to be signed to a major record label and one of the first internationally famous musicians to die of AIDS.

==Biography==
===Early life and career===
Born Bruce Wayne Campbell in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania, Jobriath showed early musical talent for playing the piano, and soon played organ in his local church. It was during this time his talents led him to being introduced to Eugene Ormandy as a child prodigy. While he was a high school student, he became further interested in classical music, and favored composers such as Sergei Prokofiev. He wrote the first two movements of his first symphony by his senior year in high school, but for reasons unknown chose not to complete it.

After graduating from Upper Merion High School (in King of Prussia, Pennsylvania) in 1964, Jobriath took an interest in folk music, partly inspired by seeing Peter, Paul and Mary in concert several times. He briefly formed a folk group with the help of his music teacher who arranged for identical twins Marty and Grace to join him. As a trio they named themselves &quot;The Last Three&quot;, and played several regional shows in the PA area before Marty and Grace departed for college. While Jobriath attended Temple University for one semester in the music program, he soon dropped out. He was drafted into the U.S. Army in the mid-1960s and went AWOL within months. Renaming himself Jobriath Salisbury, he relocated to Los Angeles.

=== Casting in &quot;Hair&quot; and early recordings with Pidgeon ===
After accompanying a friend to the audition for the musical &quot;Hair&quot; as a piano player, he impressed the producer and director with his singing and talents on the piano. He was soon cast by the director Tom O&#x27;Horgan into the leading role of Woof, a character implied to be gay. He appeared in the legendary West Coast production at the Aquarius Theater on Sunset Boulevard. Despite receiving positive reviews for his performances, he was fired from the production for &quot;upstaging&quot; the other actors. After leaving the production in 1969, he joined the folk-rock band Pidgeon, which was then signed to Decca Records, as their lead singer, pianist and guitarist. The band recorded a debut album originally titled &quot;First Flight From the Forest&quot; which was re-titled by their label as the self-titled &quot;Pidgeon&quot;, and—shortly after the album&#x27;s release—the band released the single &quot;Rubber Bricks&quot; b/w &quot;Prison Walls&quot; before disbanding. Both were produced by Stan Farber. At this time he was traced by the Military Police and arrested, spending nearly six months in a military psychiatric hospital after suffering a breakdown. During this period he began writing the songs that would lead to his next musical incarnation.

===Jerry Brandt, the hype and Jobriath Boone===
In mid-December 1972, Jerry Brandt, Carly Simon&#x27;s former manager, overheard a demo tape being played by Clive Davis at Columbia Records. Davis rejected the tape as &quot;mad, unstructured and destructive to melody&quot;, but Brandt was quick to step in. Jobriath later remarked &quot;that coming from a man who discovered both Patti Smith and Barry Manilow...so much for sanity and structure!&quot; Brandt located Jobriath in California, where he was living in an unfurnished apartment and working as a prostitute. &quot;In walked this beautiful creature dressed in white. I said, Why don&#x27;t you come out to Malibu and hang out?&quot; This became a feature of the mythology used to promote Jobriath, and helps to explain the acrimony that followed the dissolution of their professional and personal relationship.

Brandt signed Jobriath, now calling himself &quot;Jobriath Boone&quot;, to Elektra Records for a reported $500,000, in what was allegedly the most lucrative recording contract of its time. Jobriath was signed to a two-album deal. A huge marketing campaign and media blitz ensued, including full-page advertisements in &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Penthouse&quot;, and &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazines, full-length posters on over 250 New York City buses and a huge 41&#x27; by 43&#x27; billboard in Times Square. All featured the forthcoming debut album sleeve design by noted photographer Shig Ikeda, which featured a nude Jobriath, made to resemble an ancient Roman statue. Plans were announced for a lavish three night live debut at the Paris Opera that December, at a cost of $200,000 and a subsequent tour of European opera houses. Jobriath informed the press that the show would feature him dressed as &quot;King Kong being projected upwards on a mini Empire State Building. This will turn into a giant spurting penis and I will have transformed into Marlene Dietrich.&quot; Elektra, concerned about spiraling production costs, postponed the Paris Opera shows until February, later canceling them due to expense.

Amidst this barrage of promotion, the debut album &quot;Jobriath&quot; was released on June 15, 1973, garnering mostly positive reviews. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; stated that Jobriath had &quot;talent to burn&quot;, &quot;Cashbox&quot; called it &quot;truly one of the most interesting albums of the year&quot;, and &quot;Record World&quot; hailed it as &quot;brilliantly incisive&quot;, referring to Jobriath as &quot;a true Renaissance man who will gain a tremendous following&quot;. &quot;Esquire&quot; disagreed, calling it &quot;the hype of the year&quot;. The album was co-produced by Eddie Kramer and Jobriath, featuring string arrangements by Jobriath, recorded at Olympic Studios with the London Symphony Orchestra. Kramer described Jobriath in &quot;Mojo&quot; as &quot;a romantic soul, really. He wanted orchestrations like old film music, though he knew nothing about scoring. So he bought a book on orchestration and within a week he&#x27;d come up with scores of a haunting quality&quot;. Peter Frampton is also credited on the album, though his contribution is unclear.

During this period, Brandt continued making extravagant statements such as &quot;Elvis, the Beatles, and Jobriath&quot; and declaring that both he and Jobriath had booked flights on Pan American&#x27;s first passenger flight to the Moon. Meanwhile, Jobriath declared himself &quot;rock&#x27;s truest fairy&quot;, a comment that did little to increase his popularity at the time but has since confirmed his status as the first openly gay rock singer to be signed to a major record label.

Jobriath&#x27;s debut public performance was made on television, when Brandt secured him an appearance on the popular show &quot;The Midnight Special&quot;. The costumes were designed by Jobriath and the choreography was by Joyce Trisler, of the Joffrey Ballet. Two songs were performed: &quot;I&#x27;maman&quot; and &quot;Rock of Ages&quot;, the latter substituting for &quot;Take Me I&#x27;m Yours&quot; which was pulled after the producer objected to its overtly sado-masochistic theme. The long-awaited live performance finally came in July 1974 with two sold-out shows at New York&#x27;s The Bottom Line club. Sales for the album, however, were poor, and it failed to secure a chart placing.

Six months after the release of the debut album, &quot;Creatures of the Street&quot; was released, again featuring Peter Frampton, as well as John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin. The costumes were by Stephen Sprouse. The photography was by Gered Mankowitz. Compiled from the extensive sessions for its predecessor, it was launched without any fanfare or media promotion and failed commercially. A US tour followed, where Jobriath and his backing-band (called &#x27;The Creatures&#x27;) did several residencies around the US (in Philadelphia, Boston, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles &amp; Memphis) during which recordings took place at local studios for a projected third album. Despite the tour having several well-attended shows and/or several sold-out nights, both Brandt and Elektra stopped financing the tour midway through. Despite this, Jobriath and the band completed the tour, continuing to bill Elektra for expenses. A final show, at the University of Alabama, ended in five encores and the fire department being summoned when the excited audience set off the alarm.

===Cole Berlin, cabaret and The Chelsea Hotel===
In January 1975, Jobriath announced his retirement from the music industry and moved into a pyramid-topped rooftop apartment at the Chelsea Hotel in New York City. He attempted to resume his acting career, and was invited to audition for the role of Al Pacino&#x27;s lover in the film &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot;. According to keyboard player Hayden Wayne, Jobriath had the script for &quot;Dog Day Afternoon&quot; backstage at a concert at Nassau Coliseum, and claimed he did not want to do the film due to the character&#x27;s wearing of a dress. Calling himself &quot;Cole Berlin&quot; (a play on both Cole Porter and Irving Berlin), he worked as a cabaret singer at a restaurant called the Covent Garden, as well as clubs and cabarets, augmenting his income with occasional prostitution. In a 1979 interview, he said the Jobriath persona had &quot;committed suicide in a drug, alcohol and publicity overdose&quot;.

===Death===
By the time his 10-year contract with Brandt was finally up, Jobriath was sick with AIDS. He began to feel ill in late 1981 but still contributed to the Chelsea Hotel&#x27;s 100th birthday celebrations in November 1982 and continued to perform cabaret until shortly before his death. He died at his residence at The Chelsea in 1983.

==Legacy==
In November 2004, long-time fan Morrissey oversaw Jobriath&#x27;s first CD re-issue, a compilation called &quot;Lonely Planet Boy&quot;. It was produced by Eddie Kramer. Morrissey had previously attempted to secure Jobriath as a support act for the tour in support of his &quot;Your Arsenal&quot; album, having been unaware that the singer had died some years previously. Both Jobriath&#x27;s original studio albums were officially reissued on CD in Japan in late 2007, remastered and issued in mini-vinyl replica sleeves. They were released in the U.S. in standard jewel-box packaging in 2008 by Collectors&#x27; Choice Music.

The group Balcony released a semi-tribute track entitled &quot;Jobriath&quot; as a free MP3 anonymously on the internet in 2000 that was later included on their second album &quot;Before Needs&quot;. He is referenced using his legal name by the indie-folk band Okkervil River on the final song of their 2008 album &quot;The Stand Ins&quot;, entitled &quot;Bruce Wayne Campbell Interviewed on the Roof of the Chelsea Hotel, 1979&quot;. Def Leppard released a cover of &quot;Heartbeat&quot; on some versions of their 2006 album &quot;Yeah!&quot;. &quot;Morning Starship&quot; was sampled by hip-hop artist Ill Bill on the title track to his 2007 mixtape album &quot;Black Metal&quot;.

Filmmaker Kieran Turner (&quot;24 Nights&quot;) created a feature documentary about the late singer called &quot;Jobriath A.D.&quot; On March 28, 2012, English singer Marc Almond said of Jobriath on his retrospective, &quot;For me, above all else, he was a sexual hero: truly the first gay pop star. How extreme that was to the US at the time. His outrageous appearances on the hallowed US rock show &quot;The Midnight Special&quot; prompted shock, bewilderment and disgust. Everyone hated Jobriath – even, and especially, gay people. He was embarrassingly effeminate in an era of leather and handlebar moustaches.&quot; On July 11, 2012, Ann Magnuson released an EP featuring four Jobriath songs and a spoken-word narrative. On October 29, 2013, Eschatone Records released three 1971 Jobriath tracks digitally and on 10&quot; vinyl as the EP &quot;Amazing Dope Tales.&quot; On May 6, 2014, Eschatone Records released &quot;As the River Flows&quot;, a full-length album of never-before released Jobriath recordings from 1971 to 1972 on CD, limited edition vinyl and in digital format. On December 5, 2018, Morrissey released a statement that his next album, &quot;California Son&quot;, would open with a cover of Jobriath&#x27;s &quot;Morning Starship&quot;.

<doc id="264569" wikidata="Q656011" url="?curid=264569" title="List of home computers">
<text>Home computers were a class of microcomputer that existed from 1977 to about 1995. During this time it made economic sense for manufacturers to make microcomputers aimed at the home user. By simplifying the machines, and making use of household items such as television sets and cassette recorders instead of dedicated computer peripherals, the home computer allowed the consumer to own a computer at a fraction of the price of computers oriented to small business. Today, the price of microcomputers has dropped to the point where there&#x27;s no advantage to building a separate, incompatible series just for home users.

While many office-type personal computers were used in homes, in this list a &quot;home computer&quot; is a factory-assembled mass-marketed consumer product, usually at significantly lower cost than contemporary business computers. It would have an alphabetic keyboard and a multi-line alphanumeric display, the ability to run both games software as well as commercial and user-written application software, and some removable mass storage device (such as cassette tape or floppy disk).

This list excludes smartphones, personal digital assistants, pocket computers, laptop computers, programmable calculators and pure video game consoles. Single-board development or evaluation boards, intended to demonstrate a microprocessor, are excluded since these were not marketed to general consumers.

Pioneering kit and assembled hobby microcomputers which generally required electronics skills to build or operate are listed separately, as are computers intended primarily for use in schools. A hobby-type computer often would have required significant expansion of memory and peripherals to make it useful for the usual role of a factory-made home computer. School computers usually had facilities to share expensive peripherals such as disk drives and printers, and often had provision for central administration.

==Attributes==
Attributes are as typically advertised by the original manufacturer. Popular machines inspired third-party sources for adapters, add-on processors, mass storage, and other peripherals.

&quot;Processor&quot; indicates the microprocessor chip that ran the system. A few home computers had multiple processors, generally used for input/output devices. Processor speeds were not a competitive point among home computer manufacturers, and typically the processor ran either at its maximum rated speed ( between 1 and 4 MHz for most processor types here), or at some fraction of the television color subcarrier signal, for economy of design. Since a crystal oscillator was necessary for stable color, it was often also used as the microprocessor clock source. Many processors were second-sourced, with different manufacturers making the same device under different part numbers. Variations of a basic part number might have been used to indicate minor variations in speed or transistor type, or might indicate fairly significant alterations to the prototype&#x27;s capabilities. In the Eastern Bloc countries, manufacturers made functional duplicates of Western microprocessors under different part number series.

&quot;TV&quot; indicates the factory configuration produces composite video compatible with a home TV receiver. Some computers came with a built-in RF modulator to allow connection to the TV receiver antenna terminals; others output composite video for use with a free-standing monitor or external RF modulator. Still others had built-in or proprietary monitors. Often a composite video monitor (monochrome or color) would be substituted for the family TV. Some standard types of video controller ICs were popular, but see the very detailed List of home computers by video hardware for a discussion of video capabilities of different models. Memory and TV bandwidth restrictions meant that typical home computers had only a few color choices and perhaps 20 lines of 40 characters of text as an upper limit to their video capabilities. Where the same model was sold in countries using PAL or NTSC television standards, sometimes there would be minor variations in the speed of the processor, because NTSC and PAL use different frequencies for the color information and the crystal for the video system was often also used for the processor clock.

Base mass storage was whatever came in the basic configuration. Some machines had built-in cassette drives or optional external drives, others relied on the consumer to provide a cassette recorder. Cassette recorders had the primary virtue of being widely available as a consumer product at the time. Typically a home computer would generate audio tones to encode data, that could be stored on audio tape through a direct connection to the recorder. Re-loading the data required re-winding the tape. The home computer would contain some circuit such as a phase-locked loop to convert audio tones back into digital data. Since consumer cassette recorders were not made for remote control, the user would have to manually operate the recorder in response to prompts from the computer. Random access to data on a cassette was impossible, since the entire tape would have to be searched to retrieve any particular item. A few manufacturers integrated a cassette tape drive or cassette-like tape mechanism into the console, but these variants were made obsolete by the reduction in cost of floppy diskette drives.

Floppy disk drives were initially very costly compared to the system purchase price. Plug-in ROM cartridges containing game or application software were popular in earlier home computers since they were easier to use, faster, and more reliable than cassette tapes. Once diskette drives became available at low cost, cartridges declined in popularity since they were more expensive to manufacture than reproducing a diskette, and had comparatively small capacity compared to diskettes. A few cartridges contained battery-backed memory that allowed users to save data (for example, game high scores) between uses of the cartridge.

Typically there were several models or variants within a product line, especially to account for different international video standards and power supplies; see the linked articles for variants and consequences of variations. &quot;Compatibility&quot; indicates some measure of compatibility with a parent type, however, sometimes incompatibility existed even within a product family. A &quot;clone&quot; system has identical hardware and is functionally interchangeable with its prototype; a few clone systems relied on illicit copies of system ROMs to make them functional.

==Manufacturers and models==
==List of hobby, kit, or trainer computers==

This type of microcomputer required significant electronics skills to assemble or operate. They were sometimes sold in kit form that required the user to insert and solder components in a printed circuit board. They may have had just blinking lights and toggle switches, or a hexadecimal display and a numeric keypad. While some units were possibly expandable to the &quot;checkbook balancing/homework typing&quot; stage, most were intended more for education on the use and application of microprocessors.

==School computers==
These were aimed at the class room, not the living room. Some types were popular in the centrally planned economies of eastern Europe where Western computers were scarce, or in the early days of computer education in Western schools. Popular home computers of the period were fitted with various types of network interfaces to allow sharing of files, large disk drives, and printers, and often allowed a teacher to interact with a student, supervise the system usage, and carry out administrative tasks from a host computer.

==Cardboard and demonstrator &quot;computers&quot;==
Logic demonstrators illustrated some of the logical principles of computer circuits, but were incapable of automatic operation or non-trivial calculations. Some were literally cardboard, others used combinations of switches and lamps to show how logical operations worked. Some products demonstrated logical operations purely mechanically.

<doc id="264570" wikidata="Q664132" url="?curid=264570" title="Artful Dodger (duo)">
<text>Artful Dodger were a UK garage duo initially featuring songwriters and producers Mark Hill and Pete Devereux. They achieved success in the 1990s and early 2000s, releasing seven consecutive singles all of which charted in the United Kingdom top 20. What began as a handle for the release of underground bootleg recordings became a musical project creating original material for mainstream release and culminated in the release of &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Stragglers&quot;, after the duo went on to work with an array of up-and-coming vocalists. In 2001, Hill and Devereux parted ways due to creative differences and the trademark, name and usage rights of &#x27;Artful Dodger&#x27; were purchased by Blessed Records. Having reunited in 2017, Hill and Devereux found themselves unable to release new music or perform under their own name.

Hill and Devereux won numerous accolades, including the 2000 UK Producers of the Year and Ivor Novello recognition for their songwriting. 

==History==
=== Early history ===
==== Mark Hill ====
Mark Hill was admitted to the school of music at the University of Southampton as a percussionist as a teenager. Prior to Artful Dodger, he had performed with the Welsh Philharmonic Orchestra as a percussionist, and played in jazz bands. He had also worked as a session musician.

During the second year of his three-year program at the University of Southampton, Hill joined a jazz-funk band. Few contact hours meant that he had plenty of time on his hands, so he started a recording studio with fellow student and bandmate from the jazz-funk band, Neil Kerr. Kerr&#x27;s father provided seed capital, and in addition to this, the two business partners were able to secure a £20,000 bank loan, for which Kerr&#x27;s father was listed as guarantor. After a few years of trading, the business attracted further capital investment from 3MV. This studio was described by &quot;The Guardian&quot; as being a &quot;soundproofed room next to a radio station in Southampton&quot;; a location which that masthead credits as having influenced the &quot;commercial vibe&quot; of their musical output.

==== Pete Devereux ====
Pete Devereux holds a Grade 8 in piano. Prior to Artful Dodger, he had played in grunge rock bands, performed classical violin, and DJ-ed. Devereux first found his way towards Hill when he booked time at his and Neil Kerrs&#x27; studio, after discovering it in the YellowPages.

==== As Artful Dodger ====
The origins of Artful Dodger lie in an R&amp;B remix crew of producers, which included Mark Hill and Pete Devereux, known as Back to the Future. This group disbanded due to a lack of financial success. In 1997, Hill and Devereux joined forces to create bootleg editions of tracks including &quot;Dreams&quot; by Gabrielle, &quot;You&#x27;re Not Alone&quot; by Olive, and &quot;If You Love Me&quot; by Brownstone, releasing these under the Artful Dodger moniker, under Fagin Records.

Both Artful Dodger and Fagin were intended to be disposable aliases adopted to protect their identities and shield them from potential lawsuits from record companies, which might be inclined to pursue them for their unauthorised sampling of other artists&#x27; work. The name Artful Dodger was decided on over coffee, at a meeting between Hill and Devereux in Southampton. Names such as Dick Turpin and Robin Hood were under consideration, but Artful Dodger held greater appeal due its association with the city of London; regarded by many as the capital of the garage sound.
Speaking of their use of 2-step rhythms, Hill commented that it emerged from the fact that he was bored with the four to the floor structure of house music, while also being influenced by R&amp;B, and the work of Ramsey &amp; Fen, as well as Tina Moore&#x27;s &quot;Never Gonna Let You Go&quot;. He described the sound as one that &#x27;wasn&#x27;t trying to be house music, wasn&#x27;t trying to be R&amp;B...was just a...natural blend of the two&#x27;. Devereux commented that he was excited by the emergence of the garage sound, citing that he was particularly inspired by Double 99&#x27;s &quot;RipGroove&quot;, which had helped to bring the sound to mainstream audiences.

==== Association with Craig David ====
Hill was introduced to Craig David when a friend was working on a project associated with a youth centre linked to the Southampton football club, using Hill and business associate, Neil Kerrs&#x27; studio. David was a soloist on the project, and Hill noted him for his talent. Hill next encountered David in a club &#x27;years later&#x27;; finding that he was already familiar with the bootleg vinyl releases he had completed with Devereux as Artful Dodger, and with Artful Dodger being in need of a vocalist to contribute to their original instrumental tracks, Hill invited David to return to his studio. This led to a series of vinyl releases, via Artful Dodger&#x27;s own label for the release of their original tracks, Centric Records, including &quot;Something&quot;, &quot;What Ya Gonna Do&quot; and, most notably, &quot;Re-Rewind&quot;. Following an initial &#x27;white label&#x27; release, these were then licensed on to any interested record labels. The original plan was for David to be the frontman for Artful Dodger. Plans changed once David signed to a different record label and hired professional artist management; David was to use Artful Dodger to launch his solo career, thus leaving Hill and Devereux to become &quot;unwitting popstars&quot; as the frontmen of Artful Dodger. At some stage in 2002, after David&#x27;s departure, Andy Sherman sang with the outfit and toured with them.

In 2013, Devereux appeared alongside many other garage pioneers in a documentary exploring the legacy of UK garage, &quot;Rewind 4Ever: The History of UK Garage&quot;, talking about his career with Hill as Artful Dodger and working with David.

===&quot;It&#x27;s All About the Stragglers&quot;===
On 20 November 2000 Artful Dodger released an album, &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Stragglers&quot;, on FFRR Records. With tracks featuring mostly unknown vocalists, the album was largely a compilation of their previous vinyl releases and CD singles. FFRR had acquired the rights to a large number of Artful Dodger tracks that had previously been released via other labels. FFRR were therefore in the advantageous position of being able to present the duo with a &quot;fait accompli&quot;, whereby they did not genuinely have the choice to release the album under any other label.

===Personnel changes, transfer of name and associated confusion===
It was announced on 10 July 2001 that Pete Devereux was leaving Artful Dodger. The official statement emphasised that the parting of ways was &#x27;amicable&#x27;. This news came immediately prior to the release of the single &quot;TwentyFourSeven&quot;, featuring Melanie Blatt [different version to that which appears on &quot;It&#x27;s All About the Stragglers&quot;]. Hill alone represented Artful Dodger in the cover art for the single and the video clip. Fatigued from an onerous tour schedule, having &#x27;strained&#x27; relationships with certain colleagues, wanting to focus more on a behind-the-scenes music industry role as producer, and with a view towards doing more work with Craig David, Mark Hill left Artful Dodger, and Devereux returned, before leaving once again. It was in the midst of all of this that the Artful Dodger name was sold, or otherwise changed hands.

The transfer of the &#x27;Artful Dodger&#x27; moniker has been the source of a great deal of speculation and critical commentary, expressed on social media sites including Facebook, Twitter and YouTube, and has been explained by Hill and Devereux variously across numerous interviews. The common theme articulated in these interviews is that the duo express their anger and frustration over the fact that two different people, only one of which had any, albeit limited and &#x27;guest status&#x27; involvement in the creation of the Artful Dodger music, were seemingly able to achieve exclusive control over the Artful Dodger name, play at events, participate in interviews with journalists who were apparently unaware that the constitution of the group had changed, and most disconcertingly, appeared to take credit for the music that had made the original duo famous. That promoters would at times use photos of the original duo to advertise events featuring the new duo heightened the prevailing confusion. Whenever the opportunity presented itself in the natural course of the conversation however, DJ Dave Low has been known to pay homage to Mark Hill when being interviewed. In a 2011 interview with iFILM London, DJ Dave Low named Mark Hill as a current, but apparently dormant member of Artful Dodger. According to public records provided by the Intellectual Property Office - UK [IPO], there was no trademark of the terms &#x27;The Artful Dodger&#x27; under the stipulated classes 9, 16, 25, 28, 41 prior to it being assigned to Mark Hill, as a consequence of a process initiated on 7 July 2001.

In a 2019 interview, Mark Hill described complex details regarding the transfer of the Artful Dodger name, consisting of the claim that as part of his departure from Artful Dodger, he had entered into a pact with Pete Devereux, part of which involved Devereux acquiring ownership of the Artful Dodger name; Public Demand subsequently acquired the name from Pete Devereux and have retained it to the present day. This version of events is somewhat substantiated by public records provided by the Intellectual Property Office - UK, which show that the &#x27;Artful Dodger&#x27; name was transferred from Mark Hill to Pete Devereux on 27 January 2003. Pete Devereux transferred it to Public Demand Records on 1 May 2003. The trademark was transferred once again on 22 May 2008, from Public Demand Records to Blessed Records. Discogs lists Blessed Records as a &#x27;sublabel&#x27; of Public Demand Records.

The Wayback Machine internet archive offers some evidence that Artful Dodger may have been a trio at some stage, with Pete Devereux appearing alongside DJ Dave Low and an unknown man on the main page of the group&#x27;s website. It is unclear whether this had any practical significance that extended beyond the online marketing of the group. This representation of Artful Dodger as a trio is archived by the Wayback Machine as having been displayed from 25 October 2001 to 8 October 2010.

Once the Artful Dodger name came under the direct control of Public Demand Records, the duo which ultimately emerged and stands as the current incarnation of Artful Dodger has come to consist of MC Alistair, who had been a featured artist on tracks by the original Artful Dodger, and was now upgraded to the status of being a permanent member of the group; in addition to newcomer, DJ Dave Low. Both have toured the brand extensively and internationally over subsequent years as a DJ and MC duo; frequently being billed to appear alongside period genre peers including DJ Luck and MC Neat, and successors such as So Solid Crew. In addition to playing garage tracks, their repertoire has expanded to include tracks from the dubstep, deep funky house, soulful house, bassline, electro, jungle, drum and bass, and rare groove genres, curated to fit with the atmosphere at the event. Mark Hill has emphasised that he does not endorse this incarnation of Artful Dodger, and has communicated that he is sceptical of the inclusion of MC Alistair, dismissing it as an attempt by &#x27;the label&#x27; to &#x27;add legitimacy&#x27;.

===Potential second album===
In the immediate aftermath of the departure of Pete Devereux in July 2001, &quot;Billboard&quot; reported that it was anticipated that Mark Hill would complete a sophomore Artful Dodger album for release in the summer of 2002; this however never eventuated. 

In a 2009 interview with TimeOut Dubai, DJ Dave Low mentioned that he was involved in the recording of a second Artful Dodger album. He stated that this upcoming album would cover an array of genres, including down-tempo, R&amp;B, broken beat, funky house and bassline, in addition to garage. This alleged album has not been released to date, yet a track titled &quot;One More Chance&quot;, featuring Mark Asare, surfaced on a Ministry of Sound compilation album around this time.

===Original Dodger===
In August 2016, a &#x27;selfie&#x27; entered circulation on Facebook showing Mark Hill and Pete Devereux, fingers to their lips, with the hashtag #mumstheword. The pair were &#x27;convening&#x27; for the purpose of thinking of solutions to problems stemming from the fact that they had lost control of the Artful Dodger name, including the issue that those who had established themselves in their stead were answering interview questions as though they were responsible for the creation of the Artful Dodger music, which was making it difficult for them to get bookings. As a consequence of the unexpected positive response to the possibility of a reunion of the original duo, in 2017, Mark Hill and Pete Devereux formally announced the reestablishment of their creative partnership, reuniting as Original Dodger. Leading the charge was the 2017 single, &quot;Millionaire&quot;. News indicated that an &#x27;11 track release&#x27; was due to emerge, titled &quot;Soundtrack&quot;, and a tracklist was published. &quot;Soundtrack&quot; was to take the form of a &#x27;mixtape&#x27;, and was to serve as the precursor to an album release. Later in 2017, the single &quot;Find Space&quot;, featuring Shakka, was released, which was followed in 2018 by a 4-track EP titled &quot;Momentum&quot;, led by the single &quot;Bubblin&quot;, featuring Daniel Bedingfield. Disappointing sales of these early releases meant that a record deal with Warner Music Group was terminated in late 2018. Mark Hill indicated that as a consequence of this, any further Original Dodger material would be released independently.

<text>The University of Oregon (UO, U of O or Oregon) is a public research university in Eugene, Oregon, United States. Founded in 1876, the university is organized into nine colleges and schools and offers 420 undergraduate and graduate degree programs. The university also operates the Ballmer Institute for Children&#x27;s Behavioral Health in Portland, Oregon; the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology in Charleston, Oregon; and Pine Mountain Observatory in Central Oregon.

UO&#x27;s 295-acre campus is situated along the Willamette River. Most academic programs follow the 10-week quarter system. The university is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot; and is a member of the Association of American Universities. Since July 2014, UO has been governed by its own board of trustees.

UO student-athletes compete as the Oregon Ducks and are part of the Big Ten Conference in the NCAA Division I. With eighteen varsity teams, the Oregon Ducks are best known for their football team and track and field program. These two teams are even incorporated into the design of the school&#x27;s &quot;O&quot; logo. In the summer of 2022, UO hosted the 2022 World Athletics Championships. It was the first time the event was held in the United States.

The university has a long and complex relationship with Nike, Inc., and the firm&#x27;s co-founder Phil Knight. As a consequence of state higher-education disinvestment starting in the 1990s, UO has embraced a &quot;University of Nike&quot; image. Fueled by large investments in athletic infrastructure, this trend has accelerated in recent years. Knight, an alumnus, has advocated for both athletic prominence and increased privatisation of the university, and has donated over $1 billion to UO since the late-1980s, much of it going towards athletics. The school&#x27;s &quot;O&quot; logo was designed by Nike in 1998 and sports facility projects on campus typically involve both Knight and Nike.

==History==
=== The land ===
The University of Oregon is located on Kalapuya ilihi, the traditional indigenous homeland of the Kalapuya people. Following treaties between 1851 and 1855, Kalapuya people were dispossessed of their indigenous homeland by the United States government and forcibly removed to the Coast Indian Reservation in Western Oregon. Today, Kalapuya descendants are primarily citizens of the Confederated Tribes of Grand Ronde and the Confederated Tribes of Siletz Indians.

=== Motto ===
The university&#x27;s motto, translates from Latin as &quot;mind moves mass&quot;, or poetically as &quot;minds move mountains&quot;. The line comes from the Aeneid by Virgil, Book VI, line 727.

The motto is now shared with the Eindhoven University of Technology, the Military Academy of the German Armed Forces, and the University of Warwick.

===Early years===

The Oregon State Legislature established the university in 1872 and named it Oregon State University. The residents of Eugene raised $27,500 to buy eighteen acres of land at a cost of $2,500. The doors opened in 1876 with the name of &quot;Oregon State University&quot; and University Hall as its sole building. The first year of enrollment contained 155 students taught by five faculty members. The first graduating class was in 1878, graduating five students. In 1881, the university was nearly closed; it was $8,000 in debt before Henry Villard donated $7,000 to help pay it. In 1913 and 1932, there were proposals to merge the university with what is now Oregon State University. Both proposals were defeated.

===Maturity as a university===
During Prince Lucien Campbell&#x27;s tenure as president from 1902 to 1925, the university experienced tremendous growth. The budget, enrollment, facilities, and faculty members all grew several times its amount prior to his presidency. Numerous schools were also established during his tenure, including the School of Music in 1902, the School of Education in 1910, the School of Architecture, the College of Business in 1914, the School of Law in 1915, the School of Journalism in 1916, and the School of Health and Physical Education in 1920. However, the University of Oregon lost its School of Engineering to Oregon Agricultural College, now known as Oregon State University.

In 1917, a &quot;three term&quot; (quarter system) calendar was adopted by the university faculty as a war-time measure. This academic calendar has remained ever since then. However, it is now referred to as the Quarter System.

The Zorn-MacPherson Bill in 1932 proposed the University of Oregon and Oregon State College (now &quot;University&quot;) merge. The bill lost in a landslide vote of over 6 to 1. The University of Oregon Medical School was founded in 1887 in Portland and merged with Willamette University&#x27;s program in 1913. However, in 1974 it became an independent institution known as Oregon Health Sciences University.

The Institute of Molecular Biology was established at the university in 1959.

UO served as the filming location for the 1978 cult classic &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;.

====Golden age====

The 60s and 70s were somewhat of a golden age for the university. In 1964, the university ranked 25th nationally in National Science Foundation basic research grants, ahead of the University of Rochester, Northwestern University, the University of Colorado and the University of Pittsburgh.

In 1969, the UO was admitted into the Association of American Universities, along with Case Western Reserve University, the University of Maryland, and the University of Southern California.

Graduate enrollment peaked during the 1978-79 academic year at 4,568. From 1970 to 1979, 2,614 doctoral degrees were awarded at UO cumulatively.

From 1970 to 1979, 817 UO undergraduate students would go on to earn doctoral degrees at UO or another institution. Despite increases in total undergraduate enrollment since the 60s and 70s, fewer UO undergraduate students would go on to earn doctorates in the 80s, 90s, 2000s and 2010s.

Prominent UO researchers of this era include Michael Posner, Frank Stahl, George Streisinger and Aaron Novick.

UO experienced state disinvestment in the 1980s during the tenure of president Paul Olum. Further state disinvestment occurred during the 1990s and during the Great Recession. Many programs have been scaled back or eliminated.

===Recent history===
In recent years UO&#x27;s administration and Board of Trustees have approved hundreds of millions of dollars in construction projects. These facilities include Matthew Knight Arena, the Ford Alumni Center, the EMU renovation (student union building), and dormitories. This has occurred in tandem with state budget reductions, tuition increases, and increases in out-of-state enrollment.

In 2016, the university removed the name of Frederic Stanley Dunn, head of the Classics department in the 1920s and 30s, from the dormitory Dunn Hall, because of his leading role in the Ku Klux Klan.

====Declining state support====
Measure 5 established limits on property taxes in Oregon. This impacted the state budget, and led to budget and programmatic cuts at UO starting the 1990s. The College of Human Performance and Development was closed. Furthermore, many of the school&#x27;s primary and secondary teacher training programs were eliminated. By 1997, more than 20 other programs were closed or significantly reduced in size.

UO has initiated three capital campaigns in the last 30 years. The first campaign of this era was launched with a goal of $150 million. It ended up raising a total of $255.3 million between 1992 and 1998.

With financial support from the state dwindling from 40% to 13% of the university budget, in January 2001, University President Dave Frohnmayer began Campaign Oregon with the goal of raising $600 million by December 2008, the most ambitious philanthropic fundraising campaign in the state&#x27;s history at the time. With contributions exceeding $100 million from benefactors such as Phil Knight and Lorry I. Lokey, the campaign goal was exceeded by over $253 million.

In the fall of 2014, the institution announced that it would attempt to raise $2 billion from donors. In the fall of 2018, the campaign revised its goal to $3 billion. Substantial gifts were donated by Phil Knight and his wife. In October 2016, it was announced Phil Knight and his wife Penny will contribute $500 million to establish the Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact. At the time it was the largest donation to a public research university. Knight gave an additional $500 million to the Knight Campus in 2021.

In 2022, Steve Ballmer made a large gift of $425 million to fund a new institute for children&#x27;s behavioral health.

Despite the recent influx in private gifts given by mega-donors, as of 2020, UO&#x27;s state subsidy per resident student is one of the lowest in both the Association of American Universities and Pac-12 Conference.

====&quot;University of Nike&quot;====

The school&#x27;s &quot;O&quot; logo was officially adopted by the university as a whole in 2002. Designed by Nike, it was first adopted by the athletic program in late-1998. The inside of the logo is said to depict Hayward Field, the institution&#x27;s track and field venue. The outside of the logo is said to represent Autzen Stadium, which is UO&#x27;s football stadium.
Phil Knight has financed hundreds of millions of dollars worth of construction projects on UO&#x27;s campus going back to the late-1980s. Knight contributed to the renovation and expansion of the Main Library, now called the Knight Library, and the construction of the William W. Knight Law Center. Knight did not make a major contribution to academics between 1996 and 2016.

Knight is an athletic booster. He has contributed to, and managed, the construction of various athletic department facilities. Knight&#x27;s involvement in said projects usually does not involve any university oversight, making them controversial. Knight also financed the majority of the Hayward Field renovation project.

Major publications including the &quot;New York Times&quot; and &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; have described the university as the &quot;University of Nike&quot;. A book titled &quot;The University of Nike&quot;, written by Joshua Hunt, describes Nike and Phil Knight&#x27;s influence on the university.

 16.5% of UO&#x27;s gross square footage is purpose-built for the university&#x27;s sports programs.

====Push for independence====
In 2010, the newly installed UO president, Richard Lariviere, proposed establishing a new governance and funding model for UO. The New Partnership, as it became known, sought to establish an independent board and large endowment to fund the university into the future. Funding had become too low and unpredictable for UO officials, and the new model would provide the university with a consistent stream of funding and the legal freedom to borrow money for large capital projects. Lariviere&#x27;s proposal called for $800 million in state bonds and &quot;an equal amount&quot; of private gifts. The new funds would provide a large boost to UO&#x27;s then modest endowment.

In a 2010 interview, UO booster Phil Knight discussed the New Partnership. Knight explained that Lariviere&#x27;s plan would allow UO greater control and possibly allow it to set its own tuition for in-state students.

On March 31, 2012, a Political Action Committee called Oregonians For Higher Education Excellence was formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle. As of May 23, 2012, the organization has raised over $320,000. Notable contributors to the PAC include, Phil Knight, Patrick Kilkenny, and Tim Boyle. According to Boyle, the PAC&#x27;s stated goal was to help facilitate an increase in autonomy at the University of Oregon.

In reaction to a growing movement to establish an independent university board, the Oregon Legislature in 2013 passed SB 270, requiring local governing boards for the state&#x27;s three largest institutions. In 2014, the University of Oregon became an independent public body governed by the Board of Trustees of the University of Oregon. Proponents of local governing boards claimed that an independent board would give the university more autonomy and free it from inadequate state funding. This change of the board structure that eventually allowed the University of Oregon to leave the Pac12 and move to the Big10 without consideration for other state-funded universities in the state, i.e. Oregon State.

Michael H. Schill became the university&#x27;s president in the summer of 2015. In June 2015, UO&#x27;s endowment surpassed the $700 million mark. In 2022, Schill became president at Northwestern University. Karl Scholz has been president since July 1, 2023.

==Campus==


The campus is spread over and includes eighty buildings. Additionally, the campus is an arboretum consisting of 500 species of trees. In total there are over 3,000 trees on campus. It is adjacent to the West University neighborhood and Pioneer Cemetery. Eugene is near many prominent geographic features such as the Willamette River, the Cascade Mountain Range, and the Pacific Ocean. Also, within a two-hour drive is the Portland metropolitan area.

The campus is occupied by approximately 80 buildings. However, there are several ongoing construction projects, as well as plans to build new facilities. The campus is the home of the Oregon Bach Festival.

Based on Ellis F. Lawrence&#x27;s vision, many of the university&#x27;s buildings are planned around several major quadrangles, many of which abut the 13th Avenue pedestrian mall. The university is known for being the site of a pioneering participatory planning experiment known as the Oregon Experiment, which is also the subject of a book of the same name that evolved into the well known book &quot;A Pattern Language&quot; by Christopher Alexander. The project&#x27;s two major principles are buildings should be designed, in part, by the people who will use them with the help of an &quot;architect facilitator&quot;, and construction should occur over many small projects as opposed to a few large ones. 

Although academic buildings are spread throughout the campus, most are along East 13th Avenue, with heavy pedestrian traffic at the intersection with Kincaid Street. Student recreation and union centers are toward the center of the campus, with residence halls on the east side. Sports facilities are grouped in the southern-central part of campus with the Autzen Stadium and PK Park complexes across the Willamette River. The university also owns and operates several satellite facilities, including a large facility in the White Stag Block of downtown Portland and the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology in Charleston, Oregon.

The University of Oregon is home to the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art and the Museum of Natural and Cultural History.

The campus has been smoke and tobacco free since 2012.

===Old campus and memorial quad===
The oldest section of campus is in the northwest area of the current campus. The university&#x27;s first building, University Hall, opened on October 16, 1876, when the university had an enrollment of 177 students. It was known as &quot;the building&quot; before being named after Judge Matthew Deady in 1893. In June 2020, Deady&#x27;s name was removed from the building in and it was temporarily renamed University Hall. The second building on campus is known as Villard Hall and is home to the Theater Arts and Comparative Literature Departments. Completed in 1886, the hall was named after railroad magnate Henry Villard, who provided financial aid to the university in 1881. Before its naming, it was known as &quot;the new building&quot;. Both University and Villard Halls were designated National Historic Landmarks in 1977.

Just south of Old Campus is the Memorial Quad, which runs north and south along Kincaid Street, capped at both ends by the main campus library, Knight Library, on the south side, and the Lillis Business Complex on the north. It is flanked on the west by the tallest building on campus, Prince Lucien Campbell Hall, also known as &quot;PLC&quot;, Condon Hall on the west, housing the Geography department, and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art on the east, which was remodeled and reopened on January 23, 2005. Also adjacent to Memorial Quad is Chapman Hall, which houses the Robert D. Clark Honors College.
===Central campus===
The center of campus houses a mixture of academic buildings, an administration building, and student recreation buildings. Just to the east of Memorial Quad, facing 13th Avenue is Johnson Hall where offices for higher administration and trustee offices are found, including the offices of the university president. Directly across 13th Avenue, facing Johnson Hall is &quot;The Pioneer&quot; a statue of a bearded, buckskin-clad pioneer cast in bronze by sculptor Alexander Phimister Proctor in 1919. In 1932, Proctor&#x27;s &quot;Pioneer Mother&quot; statue was dedicated in the Women&#x27;s Memorial Quadrangle on the other side of Johnson Hall; the two statues are aligned so they can &quot;see&quot; one another through the large windows of the hall&#x27;s main floor.

Lawrence Hall is at the end of hardscape walkway, directly north of the intersection of 13th Avenue and University Street. It houses the School of Architecture and Allied Arts and is named after its first dean, Ellis F. Lawrence, in 1957. Allen Hall, opened in 1954, is adjacent to Lawrence Hall and houses the School of Journalism and Communication.

Additionally, Erb Memorial Union and the recreation center are in this part of campus.

===Lorry I. Lokey Science Complex and east campus===
The Lorry I. Lokey Science Complex comprises multiple science buildings to the east of Lawrence Hall, on the north side of 13th Avenue. Willamette Hall&#x27;s Paul Olum Atrium is the center of the university&#x27;s hard sciences complex. The construction of Willamette Hall, home of the physics department; Cascade Hall, home of the geology department; Deschutes Hall, home of the Computer and Information Science Department; and Streisinger Hall to the complex were completed in 1989.

Within the Lokey Science Complex are two facilities focused on integrative science. One is the Lokey Laboratories, which is a shared-use facility with state-of-the-art characterization instrumentation. Lokey Laboratories is associated with the Oregon Nanoscience and Microtechnologies Institute (ONAMI) and was dedicated to Lorry I. Lokey in 2008, for his $25 million donation toward the project.

The Allan Price Science Commons and Research Library is also within the Lokey Science Complex. It underwent a major renovation and expansion with the new building reopening in 2016.
The northeast corner of campus is home to the Ford Alumni Center and Matthew Knight Arena. Most of the rest of the eastern part of campus is dedicated to residence halls. Carson Hall, near the Erb Memorial Union, provides dining services along with dormitories. Just south is the Living-Learning Center, opened in 2006. It is a collection of functions including dormitories, classrooms, study areas, dining rooms, and recreational rooms to provide a single location for many student activities. The newest residence hall, the Global Scholars Hall, opened in the fall of 2012. It primarily houses returning students and students enrolled in the Robert D. Clark Honors College, College Scholars, and the global scholars language programs.

===South campus===
The center of south campus is where much of the on-campus athletic facilities reside. Hayward Field, home to the Ducks track and field program, sits in the eastern area of the athletic facilities. It has hosted a number of prominent track and field events such as the US Track and Field Olympic Trials, the NCAA Track and Field Championships, and USATF Championships.

To the west of the athletic facilities lies Pioneer Cemetery and further west is where the current facilities for the College of Education exists, in the southwest corner of campus. The HEDCO Education building and the Frohnmayer Music Center are in the vicinity. The Knight Law Center is just opposite of Hayward Field in the southeast corner of campus. The Many Nations Longhouse and the Museum of Natural and Cultural History are East of Knight Law.

===Knight campus===
The Phil and Penny Knight Campus for Accelerating Scientific Impact is a billion dollar applied science campus. The campus is on the north side of Franklin Boulevard.

Phil and Penny Knight contributed two $500 million gifts to the campus. The rest of the funding is expected to come from state bonds and private support.

It is hoped that Knight Campus will help grow Oregon&#x27;s biotechnology sector and generate economic growth for the state. However, professors at other institutions caution that nothing is guaranteed, and that creating a new economic hub from scratch is a tricky process.

===Other areas and satellites===
The controversial Riverfront Research Park is a small facility maintained by the university. It is used for creating new technologies, such as research about artificial intelligence at the Computational Intelligence Research Lab, and it is the home of the Zebrafish Information Network (ZFIN), the zebrafish model organism database. Controversy stems from the lack of citizen involvement in the planning process for the use of public lands, and the potential for multi-story office buildings and parking lots to replace open space, civic space, and wildlife habitat along the Willamette River. The university and student senates have each passed resolutions against construction on the banks of the Willamette River under the current development plan, yet plans for development persist. In March 2010, the issue of a conditional use permit extension for the Research Park was appealed to the Land Use Board of Appeals by a group of citizens, students, and faculty.

In 2022, UO purchased the campus of the now-closed Concordia University in Portland and converted it to the main campus of UO Portland. The university leases space in Old Town Portland in the White Stag Block as UO Portland Downtown, which was the main Portland campus until the Concordia campus purchase. 

===Sustainability===
The undergraduate architecture program is consistently ranked among the highest in the country, and is currently ranked as the #1 public program for &quot;Sustainable Design Practice and Principles&quot; by DesignIntelligence magazine.

The University of Oregon received a grade of &quot;B+&quot; from the Sustainable Endowments Institute on its last published College Sustainability Report Card in 2011.

There has also been a push for sustainable buildings on campus with a development plan that requires any new building or renovation to incorporate sustainable design. The Lillis Business Complex was the catalyst for the policy. The building, completed in 2003 has earned a LEED Silver rating, the highest rating of any college business building in the United States. , there were 15 different buildings on campus that have been awarded LEED Silver or above ratings.

==Organization and administration==
The university is accredited by the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities, which is recognized by the United States Department of Education.

===Governance===
The university&#x27;s internal governance is conducted in accordance with &quot;The Constitution of the University of Oregon&quot;. The UO Constitution provides a collaborative process that ensures a strong voice for the faculty, acting through the University Senate. The representation of students, civil servants, and administrative employees in the senate ensures this predominantly faculty body operates in the best interests of the entire university community.

UO Board of Trustees assumed control in 2014. The trustees have the broad authority to supervise and manage the university and may exercise all the powers, rights, duties and privileges expressly granted by law or that are implied by law or are incident to the board&#x27;s powers, rights, duties and privileges.

Former provost Scott Coltrane served as interim president, from August 6, 2014, through June 30, 2015, following the resignation of Michael Gottfredson. This resignation occurred with less than 24 hours notice amidst a number of controversies, including allegations of mishandling of sexual violence, a decline of $100 million in university donations, and the alienation of faculty members around unionization and academic freedom. Including one interim president, Gottfredson was the university&#x27;s fourth president in six years, a situation that led Chronicle of Higher Education to label the position a &quot;revolving door&quot;.

Michael H. Schill was president from 2015 to 2022. John Karl Scholz entered office as the 19th president in 2023.

===Budget===
UO&#x27;s FY14 operating revenue total $905 million. , the estimated economic impact of the University of Oregon is $2.6 billion annually. Despite a large increase in undergraduate enrollment, state appropriations are less than what they were 10 years prior. The university also receives less state support than many of its peers. According to FY13-14 data from the AAU, UO ranks last in state funding and receives approximately $47.8 million from the state.

===Campus safety and security===
Campus security is enforced by the University of Oregon Police Department.

The University of Oregon appeared in the documentary &quot;The Hunting Ground&quot; after allowing three basketball players accused of sexual assault to play in an NCAA Tournament. The documentary focuses on campus rape in higher education institutions in the United States.

In 2018 there were 8 rapes reported on campus. In 2018 there were 364 drug abuse violations and 894 liquor law violations on campus.

==Academics==


As of 2024, UO offered 420 degree programs. The UO student body is composed of students from all 50 of the United States, the District of Columbia, four U.S. territories, and 91 countries around the world. As of Fall 2023, Pre-Business Administration was the most popular undergraduate major at UO (9.8% of all majors), followed by Psychology (9.3%), Pre-Business Administration (8.4%), Human Physiology (5.2%), Economics (4.8%) and Political Science (3.5%).

The University of Oregon is organized into nine colleges and schools. UO&#x27;s College of Arts and Sciences covers a large array of departments in the arts and sciences. The School of Global Studies and Languages is embedded within CAS. The Charles H. Lundquist College of Business was founded in 1884 and offers courses in fields such as accounting, decision sciences, entrepreneurship, finance, management, and marketing. The School of Accounting was established in 2017 to oversee the accounting program. 

The College of Design was founded by Ellis F. Lawrence in 1914. The college offers undergraduate and graduate degrees in design and policy related fields. The college was known as the School of Allied Arts and Architecture and was renamed in 2017. The college is divided into three schools: School of Architecture &amp; Environment, School of Art + Design, and the School of Planning, Public Policy and Management. 

The College of Education was established in 1910 as the School of Education. The Robert D. Clark Honors College is a small honors college intended to complement the majors in place at the university by joining select students and faculty for a low student-to-teacher ratio (25:1 maximum). The School of Journalism and Communication is one of the oldest journalism schools in the United States; it began as a department in 1912 and became a professional school in 1916. The SOJC is located in Allen Hall on the University of Oregon&#x27;s Eugene campus. The School of Law was formed in 1884 in Portland and moved to Eugene in early 1915. The School of Music and Dance was initially just the Department of Music in 1886, and developed into the School of Music in 1900.

The University of Oregon Medical School was founded in 1887 in Portland and merged with Willamette University&#x27;s program in 1913. However, in 1974 it became an independent institution. It is now known as Oregon Health &amp; Science University.

===Undergraduate admissions===
The University of Oregon&#x27;s undergraduate admissions process is &quot;selective&quot; according to &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;. For students entering Fall 2019, 22,329 freshmen were accepted out of 27,358 applicants, an 81.6% acceptance rate, and 4,525 enrolled for a yield of 20.3%.

Among freshman students who enrolled in fall 2019, SAT scores for the middle 50% ranged from 560 to 660 for evidence based reading and writing, and 540–650 for math. ACT composite scores for the middle 50% ranged from 22 to 28. The average high school GPA for incoming freshmen was 3.65. Of the 10% of entering freshmen who submitted high school class rank, 26% were in the top tenth of their graduating class, 57% in the top quarter, and 86% in the top half.

===Faculty===
As of May 2022, at least 19 UO faculty (living or deceased) have been elected to the National Academy of Sciences.

As of the fall of 2023, the university has 2,097 faculty members. Among this group there are 782 tenure and tenure-track (ladder) faculty members. Among US doctoral universities UO is ranked 80th when it come to full professor salaries. However, when other compensation measures are factored in, UO ranks 58th.

===Research===
The university is a member of the Association of American Universities. It is also classified as a &quot;Very High Research Activity&quot; university, according to the Carnegie Classification of Institutions of Higher Education. UO has comparatively small research spending totals for an AAU level university. According to the National Science Foundation, Oregon spent $111 million on research and development in 2018, ranking it 151st in the nation.

The university has 13 research centers and institutes. The university also maintains nine &quot;research core facilities&quot;.

===Libraries===

The multi-branch University of Oregon Libraries serves the campus with library collections, instruction and reference, and a wide variety of educational technology and media services. The UO is Oregon&#x27;s only member of the Association of Research Libraries. The main branch, the Knight Library, houses humanities and social sciences, Learning Commons, Music Services, Government Publications, Maps and Aerial Photos, Special Collections &amp; University Archives, Media Services, the Center for Educational Technologies, and a Cinema Studies lab to be available in Winter 2010. Other branch locations are:
* The Design Library in Lawrence Hall
* The John E. Jaqua Law Library in the Knight Law Center
* The Loyd &amp; Dorothy Rippey Library at the Oregon Institute of Marine Biology in Charleston, Oregon.
* The Mathematics Library in Fenton Hall
* The Portland Library &amp; Learning Commons in the White Stag Block in Portland, Oregon
* The Science Library in the Price Science Commons

The UO Libraries hosts Scholars&#x27; Bank, an open access (OA) digital repository created to capture, distribute and preserve the intellectual output of the University of Oregon. Scholars&#x27; Bank uses open-source DSpace software developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Hewlett-Packard.

The Special Collections &amp; University Archives house a collection of Gardner Fox&#x27;s literary manuscripts, comic books, and other materials, including over 200 letters from fans. It is also the home to a rare collection of thousands of Japanese senjafuda (votive slips), part of the Gertrude Bass Warner Collection.

==Student life==
===Special events===
UO is home to various special events. One of the most popular and well-known events held on campus is the Oregon Bach Festival. The festival is a donor-sponsored program of the university and the only major music festival affiliated with an American university. Founded in 1970 by German conductor Helmuth Rilling and UO professor (and past president of the American Choral Directors Association) Royce Saltzman, the festival has grown into an international program that draws hundreds of musicians and over 40,000 attendees annually.

The festival has presented such artists as Frederica von Stade, Bobby McFerrin, Garrison Keillor, and Thomas Quasthoff, who made his American debut in Eugene in 1995. The festival actively commissions and premieres new choral-orchestra works, including pieces by Arvo Pärt, Osvaldo Golijov, and Tan Dun. A Bach Festival recording of the world-premiere performance of Krzyztof Penderecki&#x27;s &quot;Credo&quot; won the 2001 Grammy Award for best choral performance.

===Clubs and groups===
There are more than 250 student groups at the University of Oregon, most of which are headquartered in the Erb Memorial Union.

The University of Oregon is home to three student-run a cappella groups: Divisi, a treble ensemble; On the Rocks, a TTBB ensemble; and Mind the Gap, a mixed ensemble.

====Media====

The University of Oregon has a diverse array of student-run and student-created media, including the &quot;Daily Emerald&quot;, the &quot;Oregon Commentator&quot;, and &quot;Ethos Magazine&quot;, among others.

The university is also home of two radio stations: KWAX (classical music) and KWVA (campus radio).

===Government===

There are two major governing bodies at the University of Oregon. The largest is the Associated Students of the University of Oregon. Its purpose is to provide for the social, cultural, educational and physical development of its members, and for the advancement of their individual and collective interests both within and without the university.

Student participation in governance of the university extends to membership in the University Senate, which has five student members with full voting rights plus the ASUO president as a nonvoting member. Students are also represented on the university&#x27;s board of trustees by a voting member appointed by the Governor of Oregon.

The total FY2014-15 ASUO budget was $15.24 million.

The second-largest governing body is the Residence Hall Association (RHA), who advocate for all students living on-campus. Its purpose is to relay ideas and feedback as a way of communication with University Housing. RHA advocates for residence hall students; stimulates an environment of growth, learning, and development for all students in the residence halls through programming; submits recommendations and ideas regarding policy to University Housing.

====Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation====
The University of Oregon Graduate Teaching Fellows Federation (GTFF) was established in 1976 to represent graduate student workers and it is one of the oldest graduate student unions in the U.S. The UO administration objected to the establishment of the union, citing that graduate workers were &quot;students, not employees&quot;. The Oregon Employment Relations Board (ERB) ruled in favor of the graduate students and supported their right to organize. The GTFF began organizing its first contract in April 1977 and reached a negotiation with the university administration after two strike votes. In 1993, the GTFF successfully bargained for employer-paid health insurance.

In 2014, the GTFF went on strike for the first time. In October, GTFF members voted to authorize a strike over two issues not yet included in the GTF contract: a pay raise to the minimum GTF salary and a form of paid sick leave. The strike lasted a week and overlapped with the university&#x27;s administration of final examinations. Although the union members accused the university administration of strike breaking activities, intimidation of international students, and unlawful demands, a compromise was reached and the strike ended.

===Facilities and housing===
The Erb Memorial Union (EMU) is the student union, which functions as a center for student life. It sits on the southeast corner of 13th and University St. The EMU underwent a major renovation and expansion project from 2013 to 2016. The wing, built in 1973 was demolished in 2014 to make way for a new wing. Opened in the fall of 2016, the new facility includes improved dining options, faculty and group offices, and meeting spaces.

South of the Erb Memorial Union across a small quad is the Student Recreational Center (SRC). The Lyllye Reynolds-Parker Black Cultural Center, named in honor of Lyllye-Reynolds Parker, opened in 2019.

There are several other residence halls. Kalapuya Ilihi opened next to Global Scholars Hall, and hosts 531 students, as well as includes an open-space for students and faculty on the ground floor. Unthank Hall completed construction in 2019 and opened to student use in 2021.

==Athletics==
The University of Oregon is a member of the Big Ten Conference and the Division I Football Bowl Subdivision of the NCAA. The athletic programs have garnered 28 NCAA team championships, as well as 60 NCAA individual champions in various track and field events. The strength of the track program, as well as its connection to Nike, has made Eugene known as &quot;Track Town, USA&quot;. The two primary rivals of the Oregon Ducks football team are the Washington Huskies and the Oregon State Beavers, though they also have a strong rivalry with the Washington State Cougars. The football rivalry with Oregon State University is one of the nation&#x27;s oldest. Every year, the two teams face off in the last game of the regular season. The two teams have faced each other nearly every year since 1894 except for five years. Games were not held in 1900, 1901, 1911, 1943, and 1944. 
The university competes in 14 sports: football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball, cross country, track and field, baseball, softball, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s tennis, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s golf, women&#x27;s soccer, women&#x27;s lacrosse, women&#x27;s volleyball, and acrobatics &amp; tumbling. This does not include club sports which competes at the Division I level in Rugby, Soccer, Rowing, and Waterpolo. As well as women&#x27;s Division I club athletics in Rowing, Rugby, and Waterpolo.

With 20 NCAA championships between them, cross country and track and field are the two programs at the university that have enjoyed the most success. The programs have produced many world-class athletes including Steve Prefontaine and Alberto Salazar, the latter of whom was also a coach until he was banned for life. Nike had been formed by the former track and field head coach Bill Bowerman and former University of Oregon track runner Phil Knight. The successes of the programs have given the name of Track Town, USA to Eugene.
Created in 1893, the football team played its first game in 1894 and won its first Rose Bowl in 1917 against the University of Pennsylvania. The 1938–39 men&#x27;s basketball team, nicknamed the &quot;Tall Firs&quot;, won the first-ever NCAA basketball tournament by defeating Ohio State in the March 28, 1939, championship game.

Originally recognized as an official sport at the university in 1908, baseball was disbanded in 1981 due to concerns with Title IX. In 2007, the athletic director Patrick Kilkenny announced plans to reinstate baseball and to drop wrestling while adding women&#x27;s acrobatics &amp; tumbling.

===Relationship with Nike===

The Athletic Department (AD) and university (UO) have a long and complex relationship with Nike Inc., as the corporation was founded by two UO alumni. Nike founder Phil Knight is also one of the largest benefactors in the history of UO. In recent years he has invested heavily in developing and maintaining the athletic apparatus. The University emphasized that this would not mean an end to the annual Oregon–Oregon State football rivalry game.

===Mascot===

The mascot of the University of Oregon is the fighting duck. The popular Disney character Donald Duck has been the mascot for decades, thanks to an agreement between then-Athletic Director Leo Harris and Walt Disney in 1947. The mascot was challenged in 1966, when Disney died and the company realized there was no formal contract written for the use of Donald&#x27;s image. A contract was written up in 1973. Potential heirs &quot;Mallard Drake&quot; and &quot;Mandrake&quot; challenged Donald&#x27;s position in 1978 and 2003 respectively, but both were unpopular and discontinued.

===Song===

The fight song is &quot;Mighty Oregon&quot;, written by professor Albert Perfect and student John DeWitt Gilbert in 1916. It has undergone several changes since its original performance.

== In fiction and popular culture ==

===Onscreen===
The film &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot; (1978) was filmed on the university campus and the surrounding area. The building used as the exterior of the Delta House (which belonged to the University of Oregon Pi Kappa Alpha chapter) was demolished in 1986, but the interior scenes were shot in the Sigma Nu house, which still stands. The Omega house belongs to the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity and still stands. The sorority house where Bluto climbs the ladder to peek in on the female students was actually the exterior of the Sigma Nu fraternity. Other buildings used during filming include Johnson Hall, Gerlinger Hall, Fenton Hall, Carson Hall, and the Erb Memorial Union (EMU). The EMU dining facility known as &quot;The Fishbowl&quot; was the site of the famous food-fight scene. The Knight Library and the Jordan Schnitzer Museum of Art can also be seen in the movie.

Other films shot at the university include
* &quot;Ed&#x27;s Co-Ed&quot; (1929)

<doc id="264582" wikidata="Q4150950" url="?curid=264582" title="Remanence">
<text>Remanence or remanent magnetization or residual magnetism is the magnetization left behind in a ferromagnetic material (such as iron) after an external magnetic field is removed. Colloquially, when a magnet is &quot;magnetized&quot;, it has remanence. The remanence of magnetic materials provides the magnetic memory in magnetic storage devices, and is used as a source of information on the past Earth&#x27;s magnetic field in paleomagnetism. The word remanence is from remanent + -ence, meaning &quot;that which remains&quot;.

The equivalent term residual magnetization is generally used in engineering applications. In transformers, electric motors and generators a large residual magnetization is not desirable (see also electrical steel) as it is an unwanted contamination, for example, a magnetization remaining in an electromagnet after the current in the coil is turned off. Where it is unwanted, it can be removed by degaussing.

Sometimes the term retentivity is used for remanence measured in units of magnetic flux density.

==Types==

===Saturation remanence===

The default definition of magnetic remanence is the magnetization remaining in zero field after a large magnetic field is applied (enough to achieve saturation). The effect of a magnetic hysteresis loop is measured using instruments such as a vibrating sample magnetometer; and the zero-field intercept is a measure of the remanence. In physics this measure is converted to an average magnetization (the total magnetic moment divided by the volume of the sample) and denoted in equations as Mr. If it must be distinguished from other kinds of remanence, then it is called the &quot;saturation remanence&quot; or &quot;saturation isothermal remanence (SIRM)&quot; and denoted by Mrs.

In engineering applications the residual magnetization is often measured using a B-H analyzer, which measures the response to an AC magnetic field (as in Fig. 1). This is represented by a flux density Br. This value of remanence is one of the most important parameters characterizing permanent magnets; it measures the strongest magnetic field they can produce. Neodymium magnets, for example, have a remanence approximately equal to 1.3 Tesla.

=== Isothermal remanence ===
Often a single measure of remanence does not provide adequate information on a magnet. For example, magnetic tapes contain a large number of small magnetic particles (see magnetic storage), and these particles are not identical. Magnetic minerals in rocks may have a wide range of magnetic properties (see rock magnetism). One way to look inside these materials is to add or subtract small increments of remanence. One way of doing this is first demagnetizing the magnet in an AC field, and then applying a field H and removing it. This remanence, denoted by Mr(H), depends on the field. It is called the &quot;initial remanence&quot; or the &quot;isothermal remanent magnetization (IRM)&quot;.

Another kind of IRM can be obtained by first giving the magnet a saturation remanence in one direction and then applying and removing a magnetic field in the opposite direction. This is called &quot;demagnetization remanence&quot; or &quot;DC demagnetization remanence&quot; and is denoted by symbols like Md(H), where H is the &quot;magnitude&quot; of the field. Yet another kind of remanence can be obtained by demagnetizing the saturation remanence in an ac field. This is called &quot;AC demagnetization remanence&quot; or &quot;alternating field demagnetization remanence&quot; and is denoted by symbols like Maf(H).

If the particles are noninteracting single-domain particles with uniaxial anisotropy, there are simple linear relations between the remanences.

=== Anhysteretic remanence ===
Another kind of laboratory remanence is &quot;anhysteretic remanence&quot; or &quot;anhysteretic remanent magnetization (ARM)&quot;. This is induced by exposing a magnet to a large alternating field plus a small DC bias field. The amplitude of the alternating field is gradually reduced to zero to get an &quot;anhysteretic magnetization&quot;, and then the bias field is removed to get the remanence. The anhysteretic magnetization curve is often close to an average of the two branches of the hysteresis loop, and is assumed in some models to represent the lowest-energy state for a given field. There are several ways for experimental measurement of the anhysteretic magnetization curve, based on fluxmeters and DC biased demagnetization. ARM has also been studied because of its similarity to the write process in some magnetic recording technology and to the acquisition of natural remanent magnetization in rocks.

<doc id="264583" wikidata="Q207877" url="?curid=264583" title="Phosphine">
<text>Phosphine (IUPAC name: phosphane) is a colorless, flammable, highly toxic compound with the chemical formula PH3, classed as a pnictogen hydride. Pure phosphine is odorless, but technical grade samples have a highly unpleasant odor like rotting fish, due to the presence of substituted phosphine and diphosphane (). With traces of present, is spontaneously flammable in air (pyrophoric), burning with a luminous flame. Phosphine is a highly toxic respiratory poison, and is immediately dangerous to life or health at 50 ppm. Phosphine has a trigonal pyramidal structure.

Phosphines are compounds that include and the organophosphines, which are derived from by substituting one or more hydrogen atoms with organic groups. They have the general formula . Phosphanes are saturated phosphorus hydrides of the form , such as triphosphane. Phosphine, PH3, is the smallest of the phosphines and the smallest of the phosphanes.

==History==
Philippe Gengembre (1764–1838), a student of Lavoisier, first obtained phosphine in 1783 by heating white phosphorus in an aqueous solution of potash (potassium carbonate).

Perhaps because of its strong association with elemental phosphorus, phosphine was once regarded as a gaseous form of the element, but Lavoisier (1789) recognised it as a combination of phosphorus with hydrogen and described it as &quot;phosphure d&#x27;hydrogène&quot; (phosphide of hydrogen).

In 1844, Paul Thénard, son of the French chemist Louis Jacques Thénard, used a cold trap to separate diphosphine from phosphine that had been generated from calcium phosphide, thereby demonstrating that is responsible for spontaneous flammability associated with , and also for the characteristic orange/brown color that can form on surfaces, which is a polymerisation product. He considered diphosphine&#x27;s formula to be , and thus an intermediate between elemental phosphorus, the higher polymers, and phosphine. Calcium phosphide (nominally ) produces more than other phosphides because of the preponderance of P-P bonds in the starting material.

The name &quot;phosphine&quot; was first used for organophosphorus compounds in 1857, being analogous to organic amines (). The gas was named &quot;phosphine&quot; by 1865 (or earlier).

==Structure and reactions==
 is a trigonal pyramidal molecule with &quot;C&quot;3&quot;v&quot; molecular symmetry. The length of the P−H bond is 1.42 Å, the H−P−H bond angles are 93.5°. The dipole moment is 0.58 D, which increases with substitution of methyl groups in the series: , 1.10 D; , 1.23 D; , 1.19 D. In contrast, the dipole moments of amines decrease with substitution, starting with ammonia, which has a dipole moment of 1.47 D. The low dipole moment and almost orthogonal bond angles lead to the conclusion that in the P−H bonds are almost entirely and phosphorus 3s orbital contributes little to the P-H bonding. For this reason, the lone pair on phosphorus is predominantly formed by the 3s orbital of phosphorus. The upfield chemical shift of it 31P NMR signal accords with the conclusion that the lone pair electrons occupy the 3s orbital (Fluck, 1973). This electronic structure leads to a lack of nucleophilicity in general and lack of basicity in particular (p&quot;K&quot;aH = –14), as well as an ability to form only weak hydrogen bonds.

The aqueous solubility of is slight: 0.22 cm3 of gas dissolves in 1 cm3 of water. Phosphine dissolves more readily in non-polar solvents than in water because of the non-polar P−H bonds. It is technically amphoteric in water, but acid and base activity is poor. Proton exchange proceeds via a phosphonium () ion in acidic solutions and via phosphanide () at high pH, with equilibrium constants &quot;K&quot;b = and &quot;K&quot;a = . Phosphine reacts with water only at high pressure and temperature, producing phosphoric acid and hydrogen:

Burning phosphine in the air produces phosphoric acid:

==Preparation and occurrence==
Phosphine may be prepared in a variety of ways. Industrially it can be made by the reaction of white phosphorus with sodium or potassium hydroxide, producing potassium or sodium hypophosphite as a by-product. 


Alternatively, the acid-catalyzed disproportionation of white phosphorus yields phosphoric acid and phosphine. Both routes have industrial significance; the acid route is the preferred method if further reaction of the phosphine to substituted phosphines is needed. The acid route requires purification and pressurizing. 

===Laboratory routes===
It is prepared in the laboratory by disproportionation of phosphorous acid:

Alternative methods are the hydrolysis zinc phosphide:
Some other metal phosphides could be used including aluminium phosphide, or calcium phosphide. Pure samples of phosphine, free from , may be prepared using the action of potassium hydroxide on phosphonium iodide:
===Occurrence===
Phosphine is a worldwide constituent of the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere at very low and highly variable concentrations. It may contribute significantly to the global phosphorus biochemical cycle. The most likely source is reduction of phosphate in decaying organic matter, possibly via partial reductions and disproportionations, since environmental systems do not have known reducing agents of sufficient strength to directly convert phosphate to phosphine.

It is also found in Jupiter&#x27;s atmosphere.

====Possible extraterrestrial biosignature====

In 2020 a spectroscopic analysis was reported to show signs of phosphine in the atmosphere of Venus in quantities that could not be explained by known abiotic processes. Later re-analysis of this work showed interpolation errors had been made, and re-analysis of data with the fixed algorithm do not result in the detection of phosphine. The authors of the original study then claimed to detect it with a much lower concentration of 1 ppb.

==Applications==
===Organophosphorus chemistry===
Phosphine is a precursor to many organophosphorus compounds. It reacts with formaldehyde in the presence of hydrogen chloride to give tetrakis(hydroxymethyl)phosphonium chloride, which is used in textiles. The hydrophosphination of alkenes is versatile route to a variety of phosphines. For example, in the presence of basic catalysts adds of Michael acceptors. Thus with acrylonitrile, it reacts to give tris(cyanoethyl)phosphine:

Acid catalysis is applicable to hydrophosphination with isobutylene and related analogues:

where R is , alkyl, etc.

===Microelectronics===
Phosphine is used as a dopant in the semiconductor industry, and a precursor for the deposition of compound semiconductors. Commercially significant products include gallium phosphide and indium phosphide.

===Fumigant (pest control)===

Phosphine is an attractive fumigant because it is lethal to insects and rodents, but degrades to phosphoric acid, which is non-toxic. As sources of phosphine, for farm use, pellets of aluminium phosphide (AlP), calcium phosphide (), or zinc phosphide () are used. These phosphides release phosphine upon contact with atmospheric water or rodents&#x27; stomach acid. These pellets also contain reagents to reduce the potential for ignition or explosion of the released phosphine. 

An alternative is the use of phosphine gas itself which requires dilution with either or or even air to bring it below the flammability point. Use of the gas avoids the issues related with the solid residues left by metal phosphide and results in faster, more efficient control of the target pests. 

One problem with phosphine fumigants is the increased resistance by insects.
==Toxicity and safety==
Deaths have resulted from accidental exposure to fumigation materials containing aluminium phosphide or phosphine. It can be absorbed either by inhalation or transdermally. As a respiratory poison, it affects the transport of oxygen or interferes with the utilization of oxygen by various cells in the body. Exposure results in pulmonary edema (the lungs fill with fluid). Phosphine gas is heavier than air so it stays near the floor.

Phosphine appears to be mainly a redox toxin, causing cell damage by inducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction. Resistance in insects is caused by a mutation in a mitochondrial metabolic gene.

Phosphine can be absorbed into the body by inhalation. The main target organ of phosphine gas is the respiratory tract. According to the 2009 U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) pocket guide, and U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) regulation, the 8 hour average respiratory exposure should not exceed 0.3 ppm. NIOSH recommends that the short term respiratory exposure to phosphine gas should not exceed 1 ppm. The Immediately Dangerous to Life or Health level is 50 ppm. Overexposure to phosphine gas causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, diarrhea, thirst, chest tightness, dyspnea (breathing difficulty), muscle pain, chills, stupor or syncope, and pulmonary edema. Phosphine has been reported to have the odor of decaying fish or garlic at concentrations below 0.3 ppm. The smell is normally restricted to laboratory areas or phosphine processing since the smell comes from the way the phosphine is extracted from the environment. However, it may occur elsewhere, such as in industrial waste landfills. Exposure to higher concentrations may cause olfactory fatigue.

===Fumigation hazards===
Phosphine is used for pest control, but its usage is strictly regulated due to high toxicity. Gas from phosphine has high mortality rate and has caused deaths in Sweden and other countries.

Because the previously popular fumigant methyl bromide has been phased out in some countries under the Montreal Protocol, phosphine is the only widely used, cost-effective, rapidly acting fumigant that does not leave residues on the stored product. Pests with high levels of resistance toward phosphine have become common in Asia, Australia and Brazil. High level resistance is also likely to occur in other regions, but has not been as closely monitored. Genetic variants that contribute to high level resistance to phosphine have been identified in the dihydrolipoamide dehydrogenase gene. Identification of this gene now allows rapid molecular identification of resistant insects.

=== Explosiveness ===
Phosphine gas is denser than air and hence may collect in low-lying areas. It can form explosive mixtures with air, and may also self-ignite.

==In fiction==
Anne McCaffrey&#x27;s Dragonriders of Pern series features genetically engineered dragons that breathe fire by producing phosphine by extracting it from minerals of their native planet.

In the 2008 pilot of the crime drama television series &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;, Walter White poisons two rival gangsters by adding red phosphorus to boiling water to produce phosphine gas. However, this reaction in reality would require white phosphorus instead, and for the water to contain sodium hydroxide.

<text>Mircea the Elder (, ; 1355 – 31 January 1418) was the Voivode of Wallachia from 1386 until his death in 1418. He was the son of Radu I of Wallachia and brother of Dan I of Wallachia, after whose death he inherited the throne.

After the death of his step-brother Dan I, Mircea takes over the throne in 1386, as Wallachia, on one side, was going through a process of economic, administrative, religious development, but also of strengthening the army, and on the other side it was confronted with the expansion tendencies of the Hungarian Kingdom and Poland, which were aiming at controlling the mouths of the Danube, but also those of the Ottoman Empire in the Balkans.

During the reign of Mircea the Elder, Wallachia controlled the largest area in its history, gaining Dobruja in 1388, the Banate of Severin in 1388/9 and Podunavia (which is suspected to be the Timok Valley, or the name of the Danube river valley in Slavonic as stated in Mircea&#x27;s letter &quot;both sides of Danube&quot;). In addition, he was also granted the fiefdoms of Amlaș () and Făgăraș () in Transylvania.

The byname &quot;elder&quot; was given to him after his death in order to distinguish him from his grandson Mircea II (&quot;Mircea the Younger&quot;), although some historians believe the epithet was given to him as a sign of respect by later generations. He is considered the most important Wallachian ruler during the Middle Ages and one of the great rulers of his era, starting in the 19th century, Romanian historiography has also referred to him as Mircea the Great (&quot;Mircea cel Mare&quot;).

==Family==
Mircea was the son of voivode Radu I of Wallachia and his wife, Doamna Calinichia, thus being a descendant of the House of Basarab. He was the father of Michael I of Wallachia, Radu II of Wallachia, Alexander I Aldea and Vlad II Dracul, and grandfather of Mircea II, Vlad Țepeș (Dracula), Vlad Călugărul and Radu cel Frumos, all of whom became rulers of Wallachia. Mircea II and Vlad Țepeș were both able military commanders (Vlad Țepeș became one of the most famous leaders in history, and is commonly believed to be the inspiration for the novel &quot;Dracula&quot; by Bram Stoker). His daughter Arina married the Ottoman prince Musa Çelebi in 1403.

==Reign==

Mircea&#x27;s reign is often considered to have brought stability to Wallachia. Found in a volatile region of the world, this principality&#x27;s borders constantly shifted, but during Mircea&#x27;s rule, Wallachia controlled the largest area in its history: from the Southern Carpathians in the north to the Danube in the south, and from today&#x27;s Iron Gates on the Danube in the west to the Black Sea in the east. Also Mircea&#x27;s titles show his lands: 
&quot;I, in Christ God, the faithful and charitable God and the loving and self-sacrificing Christ, &quot;Io&quot; Mircea, the great ruler and lord of God&#x27;s mercy and the gift of God, ruling and reigning over all the land of Ungrovlahia [Wallachia] and the parts above the mountains, duke of the Tartar parts and of Amlaș and Făgăraș, and the ruler of the Banat of Severin, and on both sides throughout Podunavia, even to the great sea and ruler of Dârstor&#x27;s fortress.&quot;
Mircea strengthened the power of the state and organized the different high offices, promoted economic development, increased the state&#x27;s revenue, and minted silver money that enjoyed wide circulation not only inside the country but also in neighboring countries. He gave the merchants of Poland and Lithuania trade privileges and renewed those his predecessors had given to the people of Brașov. As a result, Mircea was able to afford to increase his military power. He fortified the Danube citadels and strengthened &quot;the great army&quot; made up of townspeople and of free and dependent peasants. He also proved to be a great supporter for the Eastern Orthodox Church. Mircea the Elder is the first in the region to deal with slaves giving 300 gypsy dwellings to a monastery in 1388.

While organizing the country and its institutions, Mircea also formed a system of lasting alliances which enabled him to defend the independence of the country. Through the intermediary of Petru Mușat, the prince of Moldavia, he concluded a treaty of alliance with Władysław II Jagiełło, king of Poland in 1389. The treaty was renewed in 1404 and 1410. He maintained close relations with Sigismund of Luxembourg, the king of Hungary, relying on their common interest in the struggle against Ottoman expansion.

===Conflicts with the Ottoman Empire===

His interventions in support of the Bulgarians south of the Danube who were fighting against the Turks brought him into conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In 1394, Bayezid I crossed the Danube river, leading 40,000 men, an impressive force at the time. Mircea had only about 10,000 men so he could not survive an open fight. He chose to fight what would now be called a guerrilla war, by starving the opposing army and using small, localized attacks and retreats (a typical form of asymmetric warfare). On October 10, 1394, the two armies finally clashed at the Battle of Rovine, which featured a forested and swampy terrain, thus preventing the Ottomans from properly spreading their army; Mircea finally won the fierce battle and threw the Ottomans out of the country. This famous battle was later epically described by the poet Mihai Eminescu in his &quot;Third Epistle&quot;. However, Mircea had to retreat to Hungary, while the Turks installed Vlad Uzurpatorul on the throne of Wallachia.

In 1396, Mircea participated in an anti-Ottoman crusade started by Hungary&#x27;s monarch. The crusade ended with the Ottoman victory at the Battle of Nicopolis on September 25. In the next year, 1397, Mircea, having defeated Vlad the Usurper with help from the Voivode of Transylvania, Stibor, stopped another Ottoman expedition that crossed the Danube, and in 1400 he defeated yet another expedition of Turks crossing the country.

The defeat of Sultan Beyazid I by Timur Lenk (Tamerlane) at Ankara in the summer of 1402 opened a period of anarchy in the Ottoman Empire and Mircea took advantage of it to organize together with the Hungarian king a campaign against the Turks. In 1404 Mircea was thus able to impose his rule on Dobruja again. Moreover, Mircea took part in the struggles for the throne of the Ottoman Empire and enabled Musa to ascend that throne (for a brief reign). It was at this time that the prince reached the height of his power.

Towards the end of his reign, Mircea signed a treaty with the Ottomans; in return for a tribute of 3,000 gold pieces per year, the Ottomans desisted from making Wallachia a province (&quot;pashalik&quot;).

==Legacy==
The &quot;bravest and ablest of the Christian princes&quot;, as he was described by German historian Leunclavius, ruled Wallachia for 32 years. Mircea was a ktetor, building among other monuments, the Cozia Monastery near Călimănești in ca. 1390. He had churches built after Serbian architectural styles, after the models of the Lazarica Church, Veluće, Naupara, and Kalenić monastery.

==In popular culture==
Mircea was played by Sergiu Nicolaescu in the 1989 film &quot;Mircea&quot;, which was also directed by Nicolaescu.

<text>Lapwings (subfamily Vanellinae) are any of various ground-nesting birds (family Charadriidae) akin to plovers and dotterels. They range from in length, and are noted for their slow, irregular wingbeats in flight and a shrill, wailing cry.

The traditional terms &quot;plover&quot;, &quot;lapwing&quot;, and &quot;dotterel&quot; do not correspond exactly to current taxonomic models; thus, several of the Vanellinae are often called plovers, and one a dotterel, while a few of the &quot;true&quot; plovers (subfamily Charadriinae) are known colloquially as lapwings. In general, a lapwing can be thought of as a larger plover.

In Europe&#x27;s Anglophone countries, &quot;lapwing&quot; refers specifically to the northern lapwing, the only member of this group to occur in most of the continent and thus the first bird to go by the English name &quot;lapwing&quot; (also known as &quot;peewit&quot; or &quot;pyewipe&quot;).

In the fanciful taxonomy promoted by medieval courtesy books, a group of lapwings was called a &quot;deceit&quot;.

==Systematics==

While authorities generally agree that there are approximately 25 species of Vanellinae, classifications within the subfamily remain confused. Some workers have gone so far as to group all the &quot;true&quot; lapwings (except the red-kneed dotterel) into the single genus &quot;Vanellus&quot;. Current consensus favors a more moderate position, but it is unclear which genera to split. The &quot;Handbook of Birds of the World&quot; provisionally places all Vanellinae in &quot;Vanellus&quot; except the red-kneed dotterel, which is in the monotypic &quot;Erythrogonys&quot;. Its plesiomorphic habitus resembles that of plovers, but details like the missing hallux (hind toe) are like those of lapwings: it is still not entirely clear whether it is better considered the most basal plover or lapwing. The IOC also recognizes a monotypic genus &quot;Hoploxypterus&quot; for the pied plover.

Many coloration details of the red-kneed dotterel also occur here and there among the living members of the main lapwing clade. Its position as the most basal of the living Vanellinae or just immediately outside it thus means that their last common ancestor – or even the last common ancestor of plovers and lapwings – almost certainly was a plover-sized bird with a black crown and breast-band, a white feather patch at the wrist, no hallux, and a lipochromic (probably red) bill with a black tip. Its legs were most likely black or the color of the bill&#x27;s base.

===Evolution===

The fossil record of the Vanellinae is scant and mostly recent in origin; no Neogene lapwings seem to be known. On the other hand, it appears as if early in their evolutionary history the plovers, lapwings and dotterels must have been almost one and the same, and they are hard to distinguish osteologically even today. Thus, since the Red-kneed Dotterel is so distinct that it might arguably be considered a monotypic subfamily, reliably dating its divergence from a selection of true lapwings and plovers would also give a good idea of charadriid wader evolution altogether.

A mid-Oligocene – c.28 mya (million years ago) – fossil from Rupelmonde in Belgium has been assigned to &quot;Vanellus&quot;, but even if the genus were broadly defined, it is entirely unclear if the placement is correct. Its age ties in with the appearance of the first seemingly distinct Charadriinae at about the same time, and with the presence of more basal Charadriidae a few million years earlier. However, the assignment of fragmentary fossils to Charadriinae or Vanellinae is not easy. Thus, it is very likely that the charadriid waders originate around the Eocene-Oligocene boundary – roughly 40–30 mya – but nothing more can be said at present. If the Belgian fossil is not a true lapwing, there are actually no Vanellinae fossils known before the Quaternary.

The Early Oligocene fossil &quot;Dolicopterus&quot; from Ronzon, France may be such an ancestral member of the Charadriidae or even the Vanellinae, but it has not been studied in recent decades and is in dire need of review.

Apart from the prehistoric &quot;Vanellus&quot;, the extinct lapwing genus &quot;Viator&quot; has been described from fossils. Its remains were found in the tar pits of Talara in Peru and it lived in the Late Pleistocene. Little is known of this rather large lapwing; it may actually belong in &quot;Vanellus&quot;.

The remaining Charadrii are highset and/or chunky birds, even decidedly larger than a lot of the scolopacid waders. The evolutionary trend regarding the Charadriidae – which make up most of the diversity of the Charadrii – thus runs contrary to Cope&#x27;s Rule.

<doc id="264593" wikidata="Q831522" url="?curid=264593" title="First Council of Lyon">
<text>The First Council of Lyon (Lyon I) was the thirteenth ecumenical council, as numbered by the Catholic Church, taking place in 1245. This was the first ecumenical council to be held outside Rome&#x27;s Lateran Palace after the Great Schism of 1054. 

The First General Council of Lyon was presided over by Pope Innocent IV. Innocent IV, threatened by Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, arrived at Lyon on 2 December 1244, and early the following year he summoned the Church&#x27;s bishops to the council later that same year. Some two hundred and fifty prelates responded including the Latin Patriarchs of Constantinople, Antioch, and Aquileia (Venice) and 140 bishops. The Latin emperor Baldwin II of Constantinople, Raymond VII, Count of Toulouse, and Raymond Bérenger IV, Count of Provence were among those who participated. With Rome under siege by Emperor Frederick II, the pope used the council to excommunicate and depose the emperor with &quot;Ad Apostolicae Dignitatis Apicem&quot;, as well as the Portuguese King Sancho II. The council also directed a new crusade (the Seventh Crusade), under the command of Louis IX of France, to reconquer the Holy Land.

At the opening, on 28 June, after the singing of the &quot;Veni Creator Spiritus&quot;, Innocent IV preached on the subject of the five wounds of the Church and compared them to his own five sorrows: (1) the poor behaviour of both clergy and laity; (2) the insolence of the Saracens who occupied the Holy Land; (3) the Great East-West Schism; (4) the cruelties of the Tatars in Hungary; and (5) the persecution of the Church by the Emperor Frederick.

The council of Lyon was rather poorly attended. Since the great majority of those bishops and archbishops present came from France, Italy and Spain, while the Byzantine Greeks and the other countries, especially Germany, were but weakly represented, the ambassador of Frederick, Thaddaeus of Suessa, contested its ecumenicity in the assembly itself. In a letter, Innocent IV had urged Kaliman I of Bulgaria to send representatives. In the bull &quot;Cum simus super&quot; (25 March 1245), he also urged the Vlachs, Serbs, Alans, Georgians, Nubians, the Church of the East and all the other Eastern Christians not in union with Rome to send representatives. In the end, the only known non-Latin cleric present was Peter, the bishop of Belgorod and vicar of the metropolitanate of Kiev, who provided Innocent with intelligence on the Mongols prior to the council. His information, in the form of the &quot;Tractatus de ortu Tartarorum&quot;, circulated among attendees.

The condemnation of the emperor was a foregone conclusion. The objections of the ambassador, that the accused had not been regularly cited, that the pope was plaintiff and judge in one, and that therefore the whole process was anomalous, achieved as little success as his appeal to the future pontiff and to a truly ecumenical council.

At the second session on 5 July, the bishop of Calvi and a Spanish archbishop attacked the emperor&#x27;s behaviour, and in a subsequent session on 17 July, Innocent pronounced the deposition of Frederick. The deposition was signed by one hundred and fifty bishops and the Dominicans and Franciscans were given the responsibility for its publication. However, Innocent IV did not possess the material means to enforce the decree.

The Council of Lyon promulgated several other purely disciplinary measures:

* It obliged the Cistercians to pay tithes
* It approved the Rule of the Grandmontines
* It decided the institution of the Octave of the Nativity of the Blessed Virgin
* It prescribed that cardinals were to wear a red hat
* It prepared thirty-eight constitutions which were later inserted by Boniface VIII in his Decretals, the most important of which decreed a levy of a twentieth on every benefice for three years for the relief of the Holy Land.

Among those attending was Thomas Cantilupe who was made a papal chaplain and given a dispensation to hold his benefices in plurality.

<text>The Kristiansund Mainland Connection ( or abbreviated &quot;Krifast&quot;) is a road system consisting of the European route E39 highway and Norwegian National Road 70 that connects Kristiansund Municipality to the neighboring islands of Frei, Bergsøya, and Aspøya and then to the mainland of Norway. Krifast opened in 1992 and consists of of road and of bicycle paths. The three main structures are the undersea Freifjord Tunnel, the Gjemnessund Bridge, and the Bergsøysund Bridge.

A total of seven bridges are part of the &quot;Krifast&quot; system, the most famous one being the suspension bridge Gjemnessund Bridge from the island of Bergsøya to the mainland of Gjemnes Municipality, with high towers and a span between them of . There is also the long pontoon bridge called the Bergsøysund Bridge which goes between the islands of Bergsøya and Aspøya, which is the only bridge of its kind where nothing but the ends are anchored to solid rock. The bridge is supported by 7 pontoons, floating on a deep fjord.

The long underwater Freifjord Tunnel goes under the Freifjorden. It is reaches a depth of below sea level at its deepest point, though the bottom of the tunnel is in solid rock. A drive through the tunnel takes about 5 minutes. Because of the relatively steep climb, there are three lanes at each end, but only two at the bottom.

Krifast was authorized by the Norwegian Parliament and construction began in October 1988. The government pledged to finance 39% of the expenses, the rest were to be taken in as toll on road traffic and car ferry fares (on the ferries to be discontinued due to the new tunnel and bridges). As of July 1991, the project employed 427 people, and spent daily on construction. Four years and NOK 1.1 billion later, in August 1992, Krifast was opened for regular traffic.

<doc id="264602" wikidata="Q1814759" url="?curid=264602" title="Cadborosaurus">
<text>Cadborosaurus, nicknamed Caddy by journalist Archie Wills, is a sea serpent in the folklore of regions of the Pacific Coast of North America. Its name is derived from Cadboro Bay in Greater Victoria, British Columbia, and the Greek root word &quot;saurus&quot; meaning lizard or reptile.

==Description==

&quot;Cadborosaurus willsi&quot; is said by witnesses to resemble a serpent with vertical coils or humps in tandem behind the horse-like head and long neck, with a pair of small elevating front flippers, and either a pair of hind flippers, or a pair of large webbed hind flippers fused to form a large fan-like tail region that provides forward propulsion.

Dr. Paul LeBlond, director of Earth and Ocean Sciences at UBC, and Dr. Edward Blousfield, retired chief zoologist of the Canadian Museum of Nature, state every elongated animal has been put forward as an explanation for Caddy. These animals include Conger eels, humpback whales, elephant seals, ribbon or oarfish, basking sharks, and sea lions. LeBlond and Blousfield state no known creature matches the characteristics found in over 200 sightings collected over a century, noting that Caddy is described as having flippers both anteriorly and posteriorly. Darren Naish contends that LeBlond and Blousfield are engaging in &quot;bad science&quot; and have incorrectly assumed that different, conflicting eyewitness reports are all descriptions of one species when various accounts &quot;are most parsimoniously interpreted as descriptions of many things.&quot;

==Creatures identified as &quot;Cadborosaurus&quot;==

===Sea lion===
In 1943, two police officers, Inspector Robert Owens, and Staff Sergeant Jack Russell, saw a &quot;huge sea serpent with a horse-like head&quot; in Georgia Strait. Later, &quot;with a pair of binoculars, Sgt. Russell saw that the strange apparition was a huge bull sea lion leading a herd of six sea lions... Their undulations as they swam appeared to form a continuous body, with parts showing at intervals as they surfaced and dived. To the naked eye, the sight perfectly impersonated a sea monster.&quot;

===Giant oarfish===
Some suggestions have been made that Caddy could be an example of the king of herrings or giant oarfish (&quot;Regalecus glesne&quot;). This species can reach in length and weigh up to . &quot;They&#x27;re long and silvery and they undulate like a serpent would as they swim through the water,&quot; said H. J. Walker, a senior museum scientist at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, which has several oarfish in its collection.

===Basking shark===
The carcass of a decomposing basking shark is often mistaken for Caddy and has fooled experts and laymen. A rotting basking shark may also resemble a decomposing plesiosaur.

==First Nations accounts==
A native image that fits Caddy&#x27;s description has been traditionally used throughout Alaska. The image indicates that Caddy or a Caddy-like creature moves north to Vancouver when the waters warm. The Inuit of Alaska have even put the picture on their canoes to keep the creature away. The &quot;Cadborosaurus&quot; is called &quot;hiyitl&#x27;iik&quot; by the Manhousat people who live on Sidney Inlet, &quot;t&#x27;chain-ko&quot; in Sechelt mythology, and &quot;numkse lee kwala&quot; by the Comox band of Vancouver Island. However, it has also been argued that these Native stories reflect a diversity of different animals. Some mythical, some real, and to just lump them into the Cadborosaurus category ignores their diverse origins and often independent backgrounds.

==Sightings==
There have been more than 300 claimed sightings during the past 200 years, including Deep Cove in Saanich Inlet, and Island View Beach, both of which are also on the Saanich Peninsula, and at San Francisco Bay, California.

===Kelly Nash video===
In 2009, fisherman Kelly Nash purportedly filmed several minutes of footage featuring ten to fifteen (including young) creatures in Nushagak Bay. In 2011, a very short segment of the footage was shown on the Discovery TV show &quot;Hilstranded&quot;, where the Hilstrand brothers (from &quot;Deadliest Catch&quot;) apparently saw Nash&#x27;s footage and unsuccessfully attempted to find one of the creatures.

==Carcasses associated with &quot;Cadborosaurus&quot;==

*1930: On 10 November at Glacier Island near Valdez a skeleton was found in ice. The skeleton was long with flippers. Some of the remains were preserved in Cordova for scientific study. The creature is thought to be a whale.
*1934: In November on Henry Island near Prince Rupert, badly decomposed remains about long were found. Dr. Neal Carter examined the remains. The creature was identified as a basking shark.
*1937: In October a purported &quot;Cadborosaurus&quot; carcass was retrieved from the stomach of a sperm whale in Naden Harbour and photographed. A sample of this carcass was sent to the BC Provincial Museum, where it was tentatively identified as a fetal baleen whale by museum director Francis Kermode.
*1941: A carcass called &quot;Sarah the sea hag&quot; was found on Kitsilano Beach. W.A. Clemens and Ian McTaggart-Cowan identified it as a shark.
*1947: In December at Vernon Bay, Barkley Sound, Vancouver Island a creature was found. It was identified as a shark.
*1950: In Delake, Oregon a creature was found with 4 tails and thick hair. It was identified as a whale shark.
*1956: Somewhere near Dry Harbour south of Yakutat, Alaska a long carcass was found with long hair. Trevor Kincaid is quoted as saying &quot;description fits no known creature.&quot; W.A. Clemens identified the carcass as a Baird&#x27;s beaked whale.
*1962: In April near Ucluelet a long carcass was found with elephant like head. The carcass was dragged ashore by Simon Peter and later thought to be an elephant seal.
*1963: In September near Oak Harbor, Whidbey Island a carcass was found with a head resembling a horse. A. D. Welander of Fisheries thought it was a basking shark.

==Purported live capture==

*1968: In August, W. Hagelund claims to have caught a baby Caddy near De Courcy Island only to return it to the water.
*1991: In July, on Johns Island (San Juan Islands), Phyllis Harsh claims to have caught a small, baby Caddy and returned it to the water.

<doc id="264604" wikidata="Q839859" url="?curid=264604" title="Ovenbird (family)">
<text>Ovenbirds or furnariids are a large family of small suboscine passerine birds found from Mexico and Central to southern South America. They form the family Furnariidae. This is a large family containing around 321 species and 71 genera. The ovenbird (&quot;Seiurus aurocapilla&quot;), which breeds in North America, is not a furnariid – rather it is a distantly related bird of the wood warbler family, Parulidae.

The ovenbirds are a diverse group of insectivores which get their name from the elaborate, vaguely &quot;oven-like&quot; clay nests built by the horneros, although most other ovenbirds build stick nests or nest in tunnels or clefts in rock. The Spanish word for &quot;oven&quot; &quot;(horno)&quot; gives the horneros their name. Furnariid nests are always constructed with a cover, and up to six pale blue, greenish or white eggs are laid. The eggs hatch after 15 to 22 days, and the young fledge after a further 13 to 20 days.

They are small to medium-sized birds, ranging from 9 to 35 cm in length. While individual species often are habitat specialists, species of this family can be found in virtually any Neotropical habitat, ranging from city parks inhabited by rufous horneros, to tropical Amazonian lowlands by many species of foliage-gleaners, to temperate barren Andean highlands inhabited by several species of miners. Two species, the seaside and the surf cinclodes, are associated with rocky coasts.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The woodcreepers (formerly Dendrocolaptidae) were merged into this family, following analysis of sequences. While confirming the overall phylogenetic pattern, other scientists instead opted for maintaining the woodcreepers as a separate family, while splitting the ovenbirds (as traditionally defined) into two families, Furnariidae and Scleruridae.

The cladogram below showing the subfamilies of the ovenbirds is based on a molecular genetic studies that revealed that Sclerurinae was the first group to diverge The species numbers are from the list maintained by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC).

The phylogeny of the Furnariidae is now well understood thanks to multiple analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial DNA. Among other discoveries, the classification of several genera had to be revised. The taxonomic arrangement presented below is based on molecular genetic studies of ovenbird relationships. However, because ovenbirds and woodcreepers are treated here as a single family some taxonomic ranks were modified. For more detail see &quot;List of ovenbird species&quot;.

The phylogenetic tree shown below is based on a large-scale genetic 2020 study of the suboscines by Michael Harvey and collaborators. The tawny tit-spinetail (&quot;Leptasthenura yanacencis&quot;) has been moved to the genus &quot;Sylviorthorhynchus&quot;, the sulphur-bearded spinetail (&quot;Cranioleuca sulphurifera&quot;) has been moved to the genus &quot;Limnoctites&quot; and its English name changed to the sulphur-bearded reedhaunter, and the white-bellied spinetail (&quot;Synallaxis propinqua&quot;) has been placed in the monotypic genus &quot;Mazaria&quot;. These changes are included in the tree shown below. The remaining paraphyletic genera are flagged in the tree by an asterisk.

In 2009, the large ovenbird family was divided into tribes by Robert Moyle and collaborators. The tribes as defined in the 2009 article do not fit well with the revised taxonomy of Harvey and are not included here. For example, the tribe Furnariini as defined in the 2009 article is not monophyletic in the Harvey phylogeny. The species numbers in the cladogram are from the list maintained by the International Ornithologists&#x27; Union (IOC).

==Fossil record==
Furnariids boast a notable fossil record for a passerine family. Numerous fossils comprising multiple skeletal elements, including cranial remains, have facilitated the identification and description of five distinct fossil species. Among these, two have been classified within the extant genera &quot;Cinclodes&quot; and &quot;Pseudoseisura&quot;, while the remaining three belong into the extinct genus &quot;Pseudoseisuropsis&quot;. All fossil are of Pleistocene age.

* †&quot;Pseudoseisuropsis nehuen&quot; Noriega 1991, early Pleistocene of Argentina.
* †&quot;Pseudoseisuropsis cuelloi&quot; Claramunt &amp; Rinderknecht 2005, late Pleistocene of Uruguay.
* †&quot;Pseudoseisuropsis wintu&quot; Stefanini &quot;et al.&quot; 2016, Early Pleistocene of Argentina.
* †&quot;Cinclodes major&quot; Toni 1977, Pleistocene of Argentina.

<doc id="264606" wikidata="Q742969" url="?curid=264606" title="Schwarzschild metric">
<text>In Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, the Schwarzschild metric (also known as the Schwarzschild solution) is an exact solution to the Einstein field equations that describes the gravitational field outside a spherical mass, on the assumption that the electric charge of the mass, angular momentum of the mass, and universal cosmological constant are all zero. The solution is a useful approximation for describing slowly rotating astronomical objects such as many stars and planets, including Earth and the Sun. It was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916.

According to Birkhoff&#x27;s theorem, the Schwarzschild metric is the most general spherically symmetric vacuum solution of the Einstein field equations. A Schwarzschild black hole or static black hole is a black hole that has neither electric charge nor angular momentum (non-rotating). A Schwarzschild black hole is described by the Schwarzschild metric, and cannot be distinguished from any other Schwarzschild black hole except by its mass.

The Schwarzschild black hole is characterized by a surrounding spherical boundary, called the event horizon, which is situated at the Schwarzschild radius (formula_1), often called the radius of a black hole. The boundary is not a physical surface, and a person who fell through the event horizon (before being torn apart by tidal forces) would not notice any physical surface at that position; it is a mathematical surface which is significant in determining the black hole&#x27;s properties. Any non-rotating and non-charged mass that is smaller than its Schwarzschild radius forms a black hole. The solution of the Einstein field equations is valid for any mass , so in principle (within the theory of general relativity) a Schwarzschild black hole of any mass could exist if conditions became sufficiently favorable to allow for its formation.

In the vicinity of a Schwarzschild black hole, space curves so much that even light rays are deflected, and very nearby light can be deflected so much that it travels several times around the black hole.

== Formulation ==
The Schwarzschild metric is a spherically symmetric Lorentzian metric (here, with signature convention ), defined on (a subset of) 
formula_2 
where formula_3 is 3 dimensional Euclidean space, and formula_4 is the two sphere. The rotation group formula_5 acts on the formula_6 or formula_7 factor as rotations around the center formula_8, while leaving the first formula_9 factor unchanged. The Schwarzschild metric is a solution of Einstein&#x27;s field equations in empty space, meaning that it is valid only &quot;outside&quot; the gravitating body. That is, for a spherical body of radius formula_10 the solution is valid for formula_11. To describe the gravitational field both inside and outside the gravitating body the Schwarzschild solution must be matched with some suitable interior solution at , such as the interior Schwarzschild metric.

In Schwarzschild coordinates formula_12 the Schwarzschild metric (or equivalently, the line element for proper time) has the form
formula_13
where formula_14 is the metric on the two sphere, i.e. . Furthermore, 
* formula_15 is positive for timelike curves, in which case formula_16 is the proper time (time measured by a clock moving along the same world line with a test particle),
* formula_17 is the speed of light,
* formula_18 is, for , the time coordinate (measured by a clock located infinitely far from the massive body and stationary with respect to it),

The Schwarzschild metric has a singularity for , which is an intrinsic curvature singularity. It also seems to have a singularity on the event horizon . Depending on the point of view, the metric is therefore defined only on the exterior region formula_28, only on the interior region formula_29 or their disjoint union. However, the metric is actually non-singular across the event horizon, as one sees in suitable coordinates (see below). For , the Schwarzschild metric is asymptotic to the standard Lorentz metric on Minkowski space. For almost all astrophysical objects, the ratio formula_30 is extremely small. For example, the Schwarzschild radius formula_31 of the Earth is roughly , while the Sun, which is times as massive has a Schwarzschild radius formula_32 of approximately 3.0 km. The ratio becomes large only in close proximity to black holes and other ultra-dense objects such as neutron stars.

The radial coordinate turns out to have physical significance as the &quot;proper distance between two events that occur simultaneously relative to the radially moving geodesic clocks, the two events lying on the same radial coordinate line&quot;.

The Schwarzschild solution is analogous to a classical Newtonian theory of gravity that corresponds to the gravitational field around a point particle.
Even at the surface of the Earth, the corrections to Newtonian gravity are only one part in a billion.

== History ==
The Schwarzschild solution is named in honour of Karl Schwarzschild, who found the exact solution in 1915 and published it in January 1916, a little more than a month after the publication of Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity.
It was the first exact solution of the Einstein field equations other than the trivial flat space solution. Schwarzschild died shortly after his paper was published, as a result of a disease (thought to be pemphigus) he developed while serving in the German army during World War I.

Johannes Droste in 1916
independently produced the same solution as Schwarzschild, using a simpler, more direct derivation.

In the early years of general relativity there was a lot of confusion about the nature of the singularities found in the Schwarzschild and other solutions of the Einstein field equations. In Schwarzschild&#x27;s original paper, he put what we now call the event horizon at the origin of his coordinate system. In this paper he also introduced what is now known as the Schwarzschild radial coordinate ( in the equations above), as an auxiliary variable. In his equations, Schwarzschild was using a different radial coordinate that was zero at the Schwarzschild radius.

A more complete analysis of the singularity structure was given by David Hilbert in the following year, identifying the singularities both at and . Although there was general consensus that the singularity at was a &#x27;genuine&#x27; physical singularity, the nature of the singularity at remained unclear.

In 1921, Paul Painlevé and in 1922 Allvar Gullstrand independently produced a metric, a spherically symmetric solution of Einstein&#x27;s equations, which we now know is coordinate transformation of the Schwarzschild metric, Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates, in which there was no singularity at . They, however, did not recognize that their solutions were just coordinate transforms, and in fact used their solution to argue that Einstein&#x27;s theory was wrong. In 1924 Arthur Eddington produced the first coordinate transformation (Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates) that showed that the singularity at was a coordinate artifact, although he also seems to have been unaware of the significance of this discovery. Later, in 1932, Georges Lemaître gave a different coordinate transformation (Lemaître coordinates) to the same effect and was the first to recognize that this implied that the singularity at was not physical. In 1939 Howard Robertson showed that a free falling observer descending in the Schwarzschild metric would cross the singularity in a finite amount of proper time even though this would take an infinite amount of time in terms of coordinate time .

In 1950, John Synge produced a paper that showed the maximal analytic extension of the Schwarzschild metric, again showing that the singularity at was a coordinate artifact and that it represented two horizons. A similar result was later rediscovered by George Szekeres, and independently Martin Kruskal. The new coordinates nowadays known as Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates were much simpler than Synge&#x27;s but both provided a single set of coordinates that covered the entire spacetime. However, perhaps due to the obscurity of the journals in which the papers of Lemaître and Synge were published their conclusions went unnoticed, with many of the major players in the field including Einstein believing that the singularity at the Schwarzschild radius was physical. Synge&#x27;s later derivation of the Kruskal–Szekeres metric solution, which was motivated by a desire to avoid &quot;using &#x27;bad&#x27; [Schwarzschild] coordinates to obtain &#x27;good&#x27; [Kruskal–Szekeres] coordinates&quot;, has been generally under-appreciated in the literature, but was adopted by Chandrasekhar in his black hole monograph.

Real progress was made in the 1960s when the mathematically rigorous formulation cast in terms of differential geometry entered the field of general relativity, allowing more exact definitions of what it means for a Lorentzian manifold to be singular. This led to definitive identification of the singularity in the Schwarzschild metric as an event horizon, i.e., a hypersurface in spacetime that can be crossed in only one direction.

== Singularities and black holes ==
The Schwarzschild solution appears to have singularities at and ; some of the metric components &quot;blow up&quot; (entail division by zero or multiplication by infinity) at these radii. Since the Schwarzschild metric is expected to be valid only for those radii larger than the radius of the gravitating body, there is no problem as long as . For ordinary stars and planets this is always the case. For example, the radius of the Sun is approximately , while its Schwarzschild radius is only .

The singularity at divides the Schwarzschild coordinates in two disconnected patches. The &quot;exterior Schwarzschild solution&quot; with is the one that is related to the gravitational fields of stars and planets. The &quot;interior Schwarzschild solution&quot; with , which contains the singularity at , is completely separated from the outer patch by the singularity at . The Schwarzschild coordinates therefore give no physical connection between the two patches, which may be viewed as separate solutions. The singularity at is an illusion however; it is an instance of what is called a &quot;coordinate singularity&quot;. As the name implies, the singularity arises from a bad choice of coordinates or coordinate conditions. When changing to a different coordinate system (for example Lemaître coordinates, Eddington–Finkelstein coordinates, Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates, Novikov coordinates, or Gullstrand–Painlevé coordinates) the metric becomes regular at and can extend the external patch to values of smaller than . Using a different coordinate transformation one can then relate the extended external patch to the inner patch.

The case is different, however. If one asks that the solution be valid for all one runs into a true physical singularity, or &quot;gravitational singularity&quot;, at the origin. To see that this is a true singularity one must look at quantities that are independent of the choice of coordinates. One such important quantity is the Kretschmann invariant, which is given by
: formula_33

At the curvature becomes infinite, indicating the presence of a singularity. At this point the metric cannot be extended in a smooth manner (the Kretschmann invariant involves second derivatives of the metric), spacetime itself is then no longer well-defined. Furthermore, Sbierski showed the metric cannot be extended even in a continuous manner. For a long time it was thought that such a solution was non-physical. However, a greater understanding of general relativity led to the realization that such singularities were a generic feature of the theory and not just an exotic special case.

The Schwarzschild solution, taken to be valid for all , is called a Schwarzschild black hole. It is a perfectly valid solution of the Einstein field equations, although (like other black holes) it has rather bizarre properties. For the Schwarzschild radial coordinate becomes timelike and the time coordinate becomes spacelike. A curve at constant is no longer a possible worldline of a particle or observer, not even if a force is exerted to try to keep it there; this occurs because spacetime has been curved so much that the direction of cause and effect (the particle&#x27;s future light cone) points into the singularity. The surface demarcates what is called the &quot;event horizon&quot; of the black hole. It represents the point past which light can no longer escape the gravitational field. Any physical object whose radius becomes less than or equal to the Schwarzschild radius has undergone gravitational collapse and become a black hole.

== Alternative coordinates ==
The Schwarzschild solution can be expressed in a range of different choices of coordinates besides the Schwarzschild coordinates used above. Different choices tend to highlight different features of the solution. The table below shows some popular choices.
In table above, some shorthand has been introduced for brevity. The speed of light has been set to one. The notation
: formula_34
is used for the metric of a unit radius 2-dimensional sphere. Moreover, in each entry and denote alternative choices of radial and time coordinate for the particular coordinates. Note, the or may vary from entry to entry.

The Kruskal–Szekeres coordinates have the form to which the Belinski–Zakharov transform can be applied. This implies that the Schwarzschild black hole is a form of gravitational soliton.

== Flamm&#x27;s paraboloid ==
The spatial curvature of the Schwarzschild solution for can be visualized as the graphic shows. Consider a constant time equatorial slice through the Schwarzschild solution by fixing , = constant, and letting the remaining Schwarzschild coordinates vary. Imagine now that there is an additional Euclidean dimension , which has no physical reality (it is not part of spacetime). Then replace the plane with a surface dimpled in the direction according to the equation (&quot;Flamm&#x27;s paraboloid&quot;)
: formula_35

This surface has the property that distances measured within it match distances in the Schwarzschild metric, because with the definition of &quot;w&quot; above,
: formula_36

Thus, Flamm&#x27;s paraboloid is useful for visualizing the spatial curvature of the Schwarzschild metric. It should not, however, be confused with a gravity well. No ordinary (massive or massless) particle can have a worldline lying on the paraboloid, since all distances on it are spacelike (this is a cross-section at one moment of time, so any particle moving on it would have an infinite velocity). A tachyon could have a spacelike worldline that lies entirely on a single paraboloid. However, even in that case its geodesic path is not the trajectory one gets through a &quot;rubber sheet&quot; analogy of gravitational well: in particular, if the dimple is drawn pointing upward rather than downward, the tachyon&#x27;s geodesic path still curves toward the central mass, not away. See the gravity well article for more information.

Flamm&#x27;s paraboloid may be derived as follows. The Euclidean metric in the cylindrical coordinates is written
: formula_37

Letting the surface be described by the function , the Euclidean metric can be written as
: formula_38

Comparing this with the Schwarzschild metric in the equatorial plane () at a fixed time ( = constant, ),
: formula_39
yields an integral expression for :
: formula_40
whose solution is Flamm&#x27;s paraboloid.

== Orbital motion ==
A particle orbiting in the Schwarzschild metric can have a stable circular orbit with . Circular orbits with between and are unstable, and no circular orbits exist for . The circular orbit of minimum radius corresponds to an orbital velocity approaching the speed of light. It is possible for a particle to have a constant value of between and , but only if some force acts to keep it there.

Noncircular orbits, such as Mercury&#x27;s, dwell longer at small radii than would be expected in Newtonian gravity. This can be seen as a less extreme version of the more dramatic case in which a particle passes through the event horizon and dwells inside it forever. Intermediate between the case of Mercury and the case of an object falling past the event horizon, there are exotic possibilities such as knife-edge orbits, in which the satellite can be made to execute an arbitrarily large number of nearly circular orbits, after which it flies back outward.

== Symmetries ==
The isometry group of the Schwarzchild metric is , where formula_41 is the orthogonal group of rotations and reflections in three dimensions, formula_42 comprises the time translations, and formula_43 is the group generated by time reversal.

This is thus the subgroup of the ten-dimensional Poincaré group which takes the time axis (trajectory of the star) to itself. It omits the spatial translations (three dimensions) and boosts (three dimensions). It retains the time translations (one dimension) and rotations (three dimensions). Thus it has four dimensions. Like the Poincaré group, it has four connected components: the component of the identity; the time reversed component; the spatial inversion component; and the component which is both time reversed and spatially inverted.

== Curvatures ==
The Ricci curvature scalar and the Ricci curvature tensor are both zero. Non-zero components of the Riemann curvature tensor are given by
: formula_44
: formula_45
: formula_46
: formula_47
from which one can see that formula_48.
Six of these formulas are Eq. 5.13 in Carroll and imply the other 6 by formula_49.
Components which are obtainable by other symmetries of the Riemann tensor are not displayed.

To understand the physical meaning of these quantities, it is useful to express the curvature tensor in an orthonormal basis. In an orthonormal basis of an observer the non-zero components in geometric units are
: formula_50
: formula_51
Again, components which are obtainable by the symmetries of the Riemann tensor are not displayed. These results are invariant to any Lorentz boost, thus the components do not change for non-static observers. The geodesic deviation equation shows that the tidal acceleration between two observers separated by formula_52 is formula_53, so a body of length formula_54 is stretched in the radial direction by an apparent acceleration formula_55 and squeezed in the perpendicular directions by formula_56.
