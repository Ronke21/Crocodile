<text>Sparta is a city in and the county seat of Monroe County, Wisconsin, United States, along the La Crosse River. The population was 10,025 at the 2020 census.

==History==
Sparta is located on former Ho-Chunk territory acquired by the United States in 1837. White settlement began after the government surveyed the land in 1849 and created a crossroads by building early state roads from Prairie du Chien to Hudson in 1849 and from Portage to La Crosse in 1851. The first recorded settlers were brothers Frank and William Petit, who opened a tavern near the crossroads in 1851. Their mother, recorded only as Mrs. Petit, named the settlement after the ancient Greek city-state of Sparta. A post office has been in operation at Sparta since 1852.

In 1854, the Wisconsin Legislature named Sparta the county seat for the newly organized Monroe County. The settlement grew with the arrival of the La Crosse and Milwaukee Railroad in 1858 and the Chicago and North Western Railroad in 1873. The La Crosse River and area creeks provided water power for early sawmills and gristmills, and the town attracted a variety of small manufacturers in the late nineteenth century. Residents also promoted Sparta as a health resort after drilling artesian wells for mineral water in the 1860s. The current Monroe County Courthouse was built in Sparta in 1895, replacing an 1863 structure.

The United States Army began to acquire land for training grounds near Sparta in 1905 and 1909. The training camp developed into Fort McCoy, named for Sparta resident Robert Bruce McCoy, and became a significant contributor to the city&#x27;s economy.

In 1967, the former route of the Chicago and North Western Railroad into Sparta was converted into the Elroy-Sparta State Trail, considered the nation&#x27;s first rail trail conversion.

The city is served by several major highways, including Interstate 90, Wisconsin State Highway 16, Wisconsin State Highway 21, Wisconsin State Highway 27, and Wisconsin State Highway 71.

Sparta is at one end of the Elroy-Sparta State Trail. Opened in 1967, this is considered to be the first rail trail conversion. It is a 32-mile (51 km) bike trail that was redeveloped from an abandoned railway and passes through rural scenery and three tunnels. It is part of the larger Wisconsin bike trail system operated by the state of Wisconsin. Based on this, Sparta dubs itself the &quot;Bicycling Capital of America&quot;; the entrance to the town is marked by an oversized sculpture of a bicyclist on an old-fashioned penny farthing high-wheel bicycle. The statue, named &quot;Ben Bikin&#x27;,&quot; has been given the title of &quot;World&#x27;s Largest Bicyclist.&quot; An annual bike ride held annually in October and called the &quot;Will to Ben&quot; runs between the &quot;Ben Bikin″&quot; statue with another from the same mold, named &quot;Will B. Rolling,&quot; which is located in Port Byron, Illinois.

<text>Tomah is a city in Monroe County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 9,570 as of the 2020 census. The city is surrounded by the Town of Tomah and the Town of La Grange.

==History==

Tomah was founded by Robert E. Gillett in 1855 and incorporated as a city in 1883, but the charter was not issued until 1894. It is named after Thomas Carron (ca. 1752–1817), a trader at Green Bay who had integrated into the Menominee tribe. The Menominees pronounced the name &quot;Tomah&quot; or &quot;Tomau&quot; and he became known as Chief Tomah. &quot;Tomah&quot; was adopted as the name for the settlement in Monroe County on the unsubstantiated belief that Chief Tomah had once held a tribal gathering in the area.

In 1891, construction began in Tomah for a Native American residential school funded by the federal government. The Tomah Indian Industrial School opened in 1893 with six Ho-Chunk children as its first students and would become the most significant residential school in Wisconsin. The curriculum was designed to assimilate students into white American culture by replacing their indigenous education with Christian, English-language education.

<doc id="260578" wikidata="Q1225289" url="?curid=260578" title="Muscle relaxant">
<text>A muscle relaxant is a drug that affects skeletal muscle function and decreases the muscle tone. It may be used to alleviate symptoms such as muscle spasms, pain, and hyperreflexia. The term &quot;muscle relaxant&quot; is used to refer to two major therapeutic groups: neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics. Neuromuscular blockers act by interfering with transmission at the neuromuscular end plate and have no central nervous system (CNS) activity. They are often used during surgical procedures and in intensive care and emergency medicine to cause temporary paralysis. Spasmolytics, also known as &quot;centrally acting&quot; muscle relaxant, are used to alleviate musculoskeletal pain and spasms and to reduce spasticity in a variety of neurological conditions. While both neuromuscular blockers and spasmolytics are often grouped together as muscle relaxant, the term is commonly used to refer to spasmolytics only.

==History==
The earliest known use of muscle relaxant drugs was by natives of the Amazon Basin in South America who used poison-tipped arrows that produced death by skeletal muscle paralysis. This was first documented in the 16th century, when European explorers encountered it. This poison, known today as curare, led to some of the earliest scientific studies in pharmacology. Its active ingredient, tubocurarine, as well as many synthetic derivatives, played a significant role in scientific experiments to determine the function of acetylcholine in neuromuscular transmission. By 1943, neuromuscular blocking drugs became established as muscle relaxants in the practice of anesthesia and surgery.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of carisoprodol in 1959, metaxalone in August 1962, and cyclobenzaprine in August 1977.

Other skeletal muscle relaxants of that type used around the world come from a number of drug categories and other drugs used primarily for this indication include orphenadrine (anticholinergic), chlorzoxazone, tizanidine (clonidine relative), diazepam, tetrazepam and other benzodiazepines, mephenoxalone, methocarbamol, dantrolene, baclofen. Drugs once but no longer or very rarely used to relax skeletal muscles include meprobamate, barbiturates, methaqualone, glutethimide and the like; some subcategories of opioids have muscle relaxant properties, and some are marketed in combination drugs with skeletal and/or smooth muscle relaxants such as whole opium products, some ketobemidone, piritramide and fentanyl preparations and Equagesic.

==Neuromuscular blockers==

Muscle relaxation and paralysis can theoretically occur by interrupting function at several sites, including the central nervous system, myelinated somatic nerves, unmyelinated motor nerve terminals, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, the motor end plate, and the muscle membrane or contractile apparatus. Most neuromuscular blockers function by blocking transmission at the end plate of the neuromuscular junction. Normally, a nerve impulse arrives at the motor nerve terminal, initiating an influx of calcium ions, which causes the exocytosis of synaptic vesicles containing acetylcholine. Acetylcholine then diffuses across the synaptic cleft. It may be hydrolysed by acetylcholine esterase (AchE) or bind to the nicotinic receptors located on the motor end plate. The binding of two acetylcholine molecules results in a conformational change in the receptor that opens the sodium-potassium channel of the nicotinic receptor. This allows and ions to enter the cell and ions to leave the cell, causing a depolarization of the end plate, resulting in muscle contraction. Following depolarization, the acetylcholine molecules are then removed from the end plate region and enzymatically hydrolysed by acetylcholinesterase.

Normal end plate function can be blocked by two mechanisms. Nondepolarizing agents, such as tubocurarine, block the agonist, acetylcholine, from binding to nicotinic receptors and activating them, thereby preventing depolarization. Alternatively, depolarizing agents, such as succinylcholine, are nicotinic receptor agonists which mimic Ach, block muscle contraction by depolarizing to such an extent that it desensitizes the receptor and it can no longer initiate an action potential and cause muscle contraction. Both of these classes of neuromuscular blocking drugs are structurally similar to acetylcholine, the endogenous ligand, in many cases containing two acetylcholine molecules linked end-to-end by a rigid carbon ring system, as in pancuronium (a nondepolarizing agent).

==Spasmolytics==
The generation of the neuronal signals in motor neurons that cause muscle contractions is dependent on the balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition the motor neuron receives. Spasmolytic agents generally work by either enhancing the level of inhibition or reducing the level of excitation. Inhibition is enhanced by mimicking or enhancing the actions of endogenous inhibitory substances, such as GABA.

===Terminology===
Because they may act at the level of the cortex, brain stem, or spinal cord, or all three areas, they have traditionally been referred to as &quot;centrally acting&quot; muscle relaxants. However, it is now known not every agent in this class has CNS activity (e.g., dantrolene), so this name is inaccurate.

Most sources still use the term &quot;centrally acting muscle relaxant&quot;. According to MeSH, dantrolene is usually classified as a centrally acting muscle relaxant. The World Health Organization, in its ATC, uses the term &quot;centrally acting agents&quot;, but adds a distinct category of &quot;directly acting agents&quot;, for dantrolene. Use of this terminology dates back to at least 1973.

The term &quot;spasmolytic&quot; is also considered a synonym for antispasmodic.

===Clinical use===
Spasmolytics such as carisoprodol, cyclobenzaprine, metaxalone, and methocarbamol are commonly prescribed for low back pain or neck pain, fibromyalgia, tension headaches and myofascial pain syndrome. However, they are not recommended as first-line agents; in acute low back pain, they are not more effective than paracetamol or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and in fibromyalgia they are not more effective than antidepressants. Nevertheless, some (low-quality) evidence suggests muscle relaxants can add benefit to treatment with NSAIDs. In general, no high-quality evidence supports their use. No drug has been shown to be better than another, and all of them have adverse effects, particularly dizziness and drowsiness. Concerns about possible abuse and interaction with other drugs, especially if increased sedation is a risk, further limit their use. A muscle relaxant is chosen based on its adverse-effect profile, tolerability, and cost.

Muscle relaxants (according to one study) were not advised for orthopedic conditions, but rather for neurological conditions such as spasticity in cerebral palsy and multiple sclerosis. Dantrolene, although thought of primarily as a peripherally acting agent, is associated with CNS effects, whereas baclofen activity is strictly associated with the CNS.

Muscle relaxants are thought to be useful in painful disorders based on the theory that pain induces spasm and spasm causes pain. However, considerable evidence contradicts this theory.

In general, muscle relaxants are not approved by FDA for long-term use. However, rheumatologists often prescribe cyclobenzaprine nightly on a daily basis to increase stage 4 sleep. By increasing this sleep stage, patients feel more refreshed in the morning. Improving sleep is also beneficial for patients who have fibromyalgia.

Muscle relaxants such as tizanidine are prescribed in the treatment of tension headaches.

Diazepam and carisoprodol are not recommended for older adults, pregnant women, or people who have depression or for those with a history of drug or alcohol addiction.

===Mechanism===
Because of the enhancement of inhibition in the CNS, most spasmolytic agents have the side effects of sedation and drowsiness and may cause dependence with long-term use. Several of these agents also have abuse potential, and their prescription is strictly controlled.

The benzodiazepines, such as diazepam, interact with the GABAA receptor in the central nervous system. While it can be used in patients with muscle spasm of almost any origin, it produces sedation in most individuals at the doses required to reduce muscle tone.

Baclofen is considered to be at least as effective as diazepam in reducing spasticity, and causes much less sedation. It acts as a GABA agonist at GABAB receptors in the brain and spinal cord, resulting in hyperpolarization of neurons expressing this receptor, most likely due to increased potassium ion conductance. Baclofen also inhibits neural function presynaptically, by reducing calcium ion influx, and thereby reducing the release of excitatory neurotransmitters in both the brain and spinal cord. It may also reduce pain in patients by inhibiting the release of substance P in the spinal cord, as well.

Clonidine and other imidazoline compounds have also been shown to reduce muscle spasms by their central nervous system activity. Tizanidine is perhaps the most thoroughly studied clonidine analog, and is an agonist at α2-adrenergic receptors, but reduces spasticity at doses that result in significantly less hypotension than clonidine. Neurophysiologic studies show that it depresses excitatory feedback from muscles that would normally increase muscle tone, therefore minimizing spasticity. Furthermore, several clinical trials indicate that tizanidine has a similar efficacy to other spasmolytic agents, such as diazepam and baclofen, with a different spectrum of adverse effects.

The hydantoin derivative dantrolene is a spasmolytic agent with a unique mechanism of action outside of the CNS. It reduces skeletal muscle strength by inhibiting the excitation-contraction coupling in the muscle fiber. In normal muscle contraction, calcium is released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through the ryanodine receptor channel, which causes the tension-generating interaction of actin and myosin. Dantrolene interferes with the release of calcium by binding to the ryanodine receptor and blocking the endogenous ligand ryanodine by competitive inhibition. Muscle that contracts more rapidly is more sensitive to dantrolene than muscle that contracts slowly, although cardiac muscle and smooth muscle are depressed only slightly, most likely because the release of calcium by their sarcoplasmic reticulum involves a slightly different process. Major adverse effects of dantrolene include general muscle weakness, sedation, and occasionally hepatitis.

Other common spasmolytic agents include: methocarbamol, carisoprodol, chlorzoxazone, cyclobenzaprine, gabapentin, metaxalone, and orphenadrine.

Thiocolchicoside is a muscle relaxant with anti-inflammatory and analgesic effects and an unknown mechanism of action. It acts as a competitive antagonist at GABAA and glycine receptors with similar potencies, as well as at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors, albeit to a much lesser extent. It has powerful proconvulsant activity and should not be used in seizure-prone individuals.

==Side effects==
Patients most commonly report sedation as the main adverse effect of muscle relaxants. Usually, people become less alert when they are under the effects of these drugs. People are normally advised not to drive vehicles or operate heavy machinery while under muscle relaxants&#x27; effects.

Cyclobenzaprine produces confusion and lethargy, as well as anticholinergic side effects. When taken in excess or in combination with other substances, it may also be toxic. While the body adjusts to this medication, it is possible for patients to experience dry mouth, fatigue, lightheadedness, constipation or blurred vision. Some serious but unlikely side effects may be experienced, including mental or mood changes, possible confusion and hallucinations, and difficulty urinating. In a very few cases, very serious but rare side effects may be experienced: irregular heartbeat, yellowing of eyes or skin, fainting, abdominal pain including stomach ache, nausea or vomiting, lack of appetite, seizures, dark urine or loss of coordination.

Patients taking carisoprodol for a prolonged time have reported dependence, withdrawal and abuse, although most of these cases were reported by patients with addiction history. These effects were also reported by patients who took it in combination with other drugs with abuse potential, and in fewer cases, reports of carisoprodol-associated abuse appeared when used without other drugs with abuse potential.

Common side effects eventually caused by metaxalone include dizziness, headache, drowsiness, nausea, irritability, nervousness, upset stomach and vomiting. Severe side effects may be experienced when consuming metaxalone, such as severe allergic reactions (rash, hives, itching, difficulty breathing, tightness in the chest, swelling of the mouth, face, lips, or tongue), chills, fever, and sore throat, may require medical attention. Other severe side effects include unusual or severe tiredness or weakness, as well as yellowing of the skin or the eyes. When baclofen is administered intrathecally, it may cause CNS depression accompanied with cardiovascular collapse and respiratory failure. Tizanidine may lower blood pressure. This effect can be controlled by administering a low dose at the beginning and increasing it gradually.

<text>Lena is a village in Oconto County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 564 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Green Bay Metropolitan Statistical Area. The village is located within the Town of Lena.

==History==

Originally known as Maple Valley, Lena owes its location to the railroads. The first white family at the site that became Lena was the French-Swiss immigrant Étienne Clement Roserens together with his French-Canadian wife Vitaline née Tessier, who established a homestead in October 1872. Their daughter Anna Rosera Hendricks was the first white child born in the settlement. Rosera Street in Lena is named after the family. Other early white settlers in this vicinity arrived in the late 1870s and consisted primarily of French Canadian immigrants. One French Canadian immigrant was Samuel LeRoy, also known as Samuel or Sam King. King homesteaded land in 1872 and donated land for the first schoolhouse. As was common in other areas populated by French-Canadians during this era, most of the Maple Valley residents engaged in small-scale logging, concentrating their work and their homes along Jones Creek, a tributary of the Little River. By 1879 the community had become large enough to support a post office and, since the name &quot;Maple Valley&quot; had already been assigned to another Wisconsin post office, the recommendation of a new name fell to Oconto Postmaster George R. Hall. Hall submitted the first name of his future wife (Helena &quot;Lena&quot; Louisa McCartney) to the federal postmaster, and the choice was approved. Lena was incorporated as a village in 1921.

==Geography==
Lena is located at (44.950453, -88.051066).

<text>Oconto is a city and county seat of Oconto County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 4,609 at the 2020 census. It is part of the Green Bay metropolitan area. The city is located partially within the town of Oconto.

==History==
Oconto is home to Copper Culture State Park, which has remains dated to around 5000-6000 B.C. It is a burial ground of the Copper Culture Indians. This burial ground is considered to be the oldest cemetery in Wisconsin and one of the oldest in the nation. Their descendants include the Menominee, who have lived here for thousands of years.

The first Europeans to come to the area were the French, who considered it to be part of New France. The French Jesuit, Roman Catholic priest, and missionary, Father Claude-Jean Allouez said the first Mass in Oconto on December 3, 1669. The Menominee living here began participating in the fur trade network and converting to Christianity. This area was included in the land ceded by the Menominee to the United States government in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars. In this treaty, the Menominee ceded over four million acres of land after years of negotiations about how to accommodate the Oneida, Stockbridge-Munsee, and Brothertown peoples who were being removed from New York to Wisconsin.

Following the treaty, the land became officially available for American settlement, although soldiers and lumberers had already been here for some time. The same year the Treaty of the Cedars was signed, George Lurwick bought a home and sawmill along the Oconto River, becoming the town&#x27;s first private land owner now that the land had been sold to the United States.

The city of Oconto was incorporated in 1869. The city took its name from the nearby Oconto River. The name &quot;Okāqtow&quot; is a Menominee name meaning &quot;the place of the pike&quot;, one of several pike-related place-names in the area.

The first Christian Science church in the world was erected in 1886 in Oconto and still stands at the corner of Main Street and Chicago Street. The land was donated by Henry (1837–1904) and Victoria Sargent (1848–1930).

In 1891, the city hosted minor league baseball when the Oconto Log Drivers became charter members of the Wisconsin State League. The league began play on May 14, 1891 and the Log Drivers did not return after the first league season.

In the summer of 1952, during a two-day period, an estimated 175,000,000 leopard frogs emerged from nearby marshes and enveloped the town. The water level of Lake Michigan rose in the spring, flooding the wetlands. The frogs laid their eggs, and when the lake level receded with the heat of summer, most of the eggs would die. However, in 1952, Lake Michigan remained high, and a huge number of frog eggs grew into live amphibians.

<text>Black Creek is a village in north-central Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,357 at the 2020 census. The village is located within the Town of Black Creek, but is governed independently.
Origins of the community trace back to 1862 when it was settled by American Civil War veteran, Thomas J. Burdick and his son, Abraham. Initially, the village had been referred to as Middleburg, due to its geographical proximity to Green Bay, Shawano, and Appleton. However, the name was later changed to &quot;Black Creek&quot; to reflect the dark-colored creek along the outskirts of the community with village incorporation in 1904. 
Today, Black Creek hosts a variety of community events including the annual Family Daze celebration.

==History==
In the Menominee language, Black Creek is known as &quot;Enāēnohnyah&quot;, &quot;Little Walks Plainly&quot;, which is a man&#x27;s name. The territory where Black Creek is today was originally occupied by several different Native American nations. The Menominee ceded the territory in the 1836 Treaty of the Cedars, while the Ho-Chunk were pressured into selling their land and illegally removed from the area before the eight year grace period guaranteed in their 1837 treaty.

The village of Black Creek was then settled by American Civil War veteran, Thomas J. Burdick and his son, Abraham L. Burdick, in 1862. The community had been known as Middleburg, due to its geographical proximity to the larger communities of Green Bay, Shawano, and Appleton. With village incorporation in 1904, the settlement was renamed &quot;Black Creek&quot; to reflect the dark-colored creek along the northern edge of the community. Black Creek&#x27;s first village president was, politician and businessman, Charles J. Hagen.

In 1869, the country&#x27;s first organized baseball team was formed in Black Creek by L.J. Cook. Thus, the village is known as the birthplace of Wisconsin baseball. At the time, the team played at the village&#x27;s North Park. It was a part of the Dairyland League before the team disbanded in the mid-1990s. Black Creek&#x27;s major rivalries were with the Navarino Rangers and the Nichols Nitros. To commemorate the village&#x27;s baseball history, a &quot;Grudge Match&quot; softball game is played annually.

After the arrival of the Green Bay and Lake Pepin Railroad in 1871, the small lumbering settlement soon developed into a trade and shipping center for local farm and dairy products with the establishment of Black Creek Creamery in 1894 and Borden&#x27;s Condensery in 1917.

The village library was formed in 1901. The following year, 1902, a large fire destroyed part of the community, leading to the construction of the village fire department in 1904. In 1910, telephone service was made available to residents, with electricity making its debut in 1915. A north-south route of the Soo Line Railroad was constructed through the community in 1917.

The Black Creek area was formerly the nation&#x27;s leader in sauerkraut production. Thus, the village has supported multiple sauerkraut production facilities since the late 1880s until Frank Pure Food Company and Wolf River Kraut ceased operations in the village during the mid-1990s.

Additionally, a desire from residents to restore and preserve historic buildings is present throughout the study. It was suggested that the community utilize an empty lot adjacent to the state trail for a new community center that would host indoor and outdoor events.

Together, with a UW-Extension consultant, the board devised an eight-step plan for recruiting new businesses.

<text>Kaukauna is a town in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,238 at the 2010 census. The unincorporated community of Sniderville is located partially in the town.

==History==
The Town of Kaukauna, originally named Kaukaulan (though other sources have more rarely referred to it in its earliest days as Grand Kaukalan or [Grand] Cacalin) organized as a town on April 7, 1842. At the time of its formation, it was wholly a part of Brown County; Outagamie County would not be formed until 1851. The town originally comprised all of future Outagamie County, and parts of Brown County around Wrightstown.

As settlers arrived, the Towns of Grand Chute and Lansing were split off from Kaukauna in 1849. The 1849 split left Kaukauna to administer its present-day Town area, all of the area comprising the Town of Vandenbroek, and portions of the present-day Town of Buchanan. The portion which went to the Town of Buchanan was portioned off in 1858. In 1885, the adjacent City of Kaukauna was removed from the town when it incorporated. The last major change was the Town of Vandenbroek divided off in 1902 into a new township, giving the Town of Kaukauna its rough size as it exists today. On February 28, 2002, further parts of the town were annexed by Wrightstown, Wisconsin.

<text>Kaukauna () is a city in Outagamie and Calumet counties, Wisconsin, United States. It is situated on the Fox River, approximately north of Milwaukee. The population was 17,089 at the 2020 census. It is a part of the Appleton, Wisconsin Metropolitan Statistical Area.

==History==
Kaukauna is a Native American word and in various languages means &quot;portage&quot;, &quot;long portage&quot;, &quot;place where pickerel are caught&quot;, and &quot;place of pike&quot;. This area was traditionally home to the Ho-Chunk and Menominee peoples. The first Europeans in the area were the French. The first Catholic missionary in the area, Fr. Claude Allouez, commented on the &quot;apple trees and vine stalks in abundance&quot; that he found the people of Kaukauna cultivating. Kaukauna became an outpost of trade in Green Bay and saw much intermarriage between French and Menominee people, leading to a Métis culture which produced local leaders such as Augustin Grignon.

The first recorded land deed in Wisconsin was assigned to Dominique Ducharme in 1793. He obtained from the Menominee Indians for two barrels of rum and other gifts. These acres are the original site of the town of Kaukauna. The property was purchased by Charles A. Grignon (and recorded Dec. 18, 1828), who built a mansion on the river on Kaukauna&#x27;s north side. The home, which bears Grignon&#x27;s name, is operated as a museum by the Outagamie County Historical Society.

In 1836, following years of negotiations about how to accommodate the Oneida, Stockbridge-Munsee, and Brothertown peoples who were removed from New York, the Menominee ceded over four million acres of land to the United States in the Treaty of the Cedars. Grignon of Kaukauna was one of the signatories of the treaty.

Prior to 1880, and shortly afterwards, Kaukauna was known as &quot;The Lion on the Fox&quot;. This nickname was changed to &quot;The Electric City&quot; upon the completion of the hydroelectric plant. When the city was incorporated in 1885, it was separated from the adjacent rural parts of the town.

<text>Seymour is a city in Outagamie County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,546 at the 2020 census. The city is located within the Town of Seymour and the Town of Osborn.

==History==

Seymour was founded in 1868 and named after Governor Horatio Seymour of New York.

William and John Ausbourne were the first settlers in Seymour. They had traveled from western Outagamie County on the Wolf River during the summer of 1857, making their way to the mouth of the Shioc River and moving to a spot where the Black Creek flows into the Shioc. After finding no more roads to follow, the Ausbournes settled in the present location of Seymour, which was occupied by Native Americans at the time. There they built a log house, the only residence in Seymour for two years. Their closest neighbors lived in Osborn.

Over the years more settlers came to Seymour. Henry Becker and Herman Husmann came in 1859, and Willis and Dan Mungers arrived later that year. They built a house on what is now Main Street and their daughter Sally lived in a frame house on what is now South Main Street. Erastus C. Buttles came during the spring and established a farm in the western part of the county. Leaonard and Avery Carter arrived in Seymour in 1876, along with Charles Eichler, the first German settler in the area.

As more settlements were established in the area, the population grew. On March 1, 1877 Seymour became a recognized town, along with the towns of Osborn and Freedom.

During the early 1880s, construction of the Green Bay and Lake Pepin Railroad was completed. In 1883 a station was built in Seymour, and soon Seymour was recognized as the smallest incorporated city in the nation.

When the settlers had built their houses, they turned to education, electing a school superintendent and an establishing a school tax. The schoolhouse was a simple one-room building with no floor and a shake roof.

Between 1887 and 1889 George E. Mendell published the first newspaper, &quot;The Aurora&quot;, which lasted only three years. On July 8, 1886 the &quot;Seymour Press&quot; made its first appearance, and was published by the Van Vuren family for over 80 years. It was then sold to the Shellman Publishing Company of Oconto Falls, and is still published today.

&quot;Hamburger&quot; Charlie Nagreen served the world&#x27;s first hamburger at the Seymour Fair of 1885 when he decided to flatten a meatball and place it between slices of bread to increase portability.

The Seymour Community Historical Society was officially incorporated on October 11, 1975. A dedicated group of local historians led by Tom Duffey, Rita Gosse, and Bill Collar established the society with the assistance of the State Historical Society of Wisconsin. Since its inception, SCHS members have been active in collecting and preserving records and physical objects relating to the city of Seymour and the surrounding area.

On July 21, 2012 the new Seymour Community Museum opened. The new facility was built for $1.2 million, which was entirely funded by private donors.

<doc id="260593" wikidata="Q1658699" url="?curid=260593" title="Belgium (town), Wisconsin">
<text>Belgium is a town in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 1,513 at the 2000 census. The Village of Belgium is surrounded on all sides by the town, and the unincorporated communities of Decker, Holy Cross, Lake Church, and Sauk Trail Beach are located in the town, as is the ghost town of Stonehaven. The unincorporated community of Dacada is also partially located in the town.

Beginning in the 1840s, immigrant farmers from Luxembourg settled in the towns of Northern Ozaukee County, including Belgium. Their centers of settlement in the Town of Belgium included the hamlets of Dacada, Holy Cross, and Lake Church, as well as the settlement that would eventually become the Village of Belgium, which incorporated from some of the town&#x27;s land in 1922. The Town of Belgium is a primarily agricultural community with over 18,000 acres of farmland—the largest amount in any Ozaukee County community.

==History==

Northeastern Ozaukee County, including the town and village Belgium, was inhabited by several Native American tribes, including the Menominee. The Menominee surrendered the land that would become Belgium to the United States Federal Government through the 1832 &quot;Treaty of Washington&quot;.

In the late 1840s, immigrants from Luxembourg began to settle in what would become northeastern Ozaukee County. In 1848, the Town of Belgium was created out of the Town of Port Washington.

The Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway began running through the community in 1872, spurring population growth. In the early 20th Century, Belgium was a stop on the Milwaukee Interurban Line, which ran between Milwaukee and Sheboygan from 1908 until 1948. The population began to concentrate around the railroad station, and the Village of Belgium was incorporated out of some of the town&#x27;s land in 1922.

From 1901 to 1925, the Lake Shore Stone Company operated a dolomite quarry at the present location of Harrington Beach State Park in the Town of Belgium. There was a company town called Stonehaven at the site. Most of the workers were immigrants from Luxembourg, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and Italy. When the quarry closed, some of the residential buildings were moved to the Village of Belgium. The foundations of some of the building remain in the state park.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 36.8 square miles (95.3 km2), of which, 35.7 square miles (92.6 km2) of it is land and 1.1 square miles (2.7 km2) of it (2.88%) is water. The Village of Belgium is located in what was formerly the central part of the Town of Belgium. The town borders the Town of Holland to the north, Lake Michigan to the east, the Town of Port Washington to the south, and the Town of Fredonia to the west. The unincorporated communities of Dacada, Decker, Holy Cross, Lake Church, and Sauk Trail Beach are located in the town as is the former company town of Stonehaven.

The town is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources considers the town to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape. The Lake Michigan coastline in the town is lined with sand and gravel beaches.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, much of the Belgium area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also lowland conifer forests and swamps dominated by white cedar and tamarack along the Onion River, Sauk Creek, and Sucker Creek, all of which flow through the town. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture. Much of the town remains agricultural; as of 2000 there were over 18,000 acres of agricultural land in the town—the largest amount of farmland in any Ozaukee County community. However, as of 2002, the Town of Belgium also had the largest share of restored wetlands in the county with over 126 acres spread across 105 restoration sites.

Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, and red foxes can be seen in the town. The community is also home to several bird habitats, including the United States Fish and Wildlife Service&#x27;s Belgium Waterfowl Production Area and the Cedar Grove Waterfowl Production Area as well as Harrington Beach State Park which is located on the shore of Lake Michigan and is one of two Wisconsin Important Bird Areas in Ozaukee County. The open fields in the western part of Harrington Beach are a breeding ground for upland sandpipers.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles. Some of the wetlands in the Town of Belgium are especially affected by reed canary grass, with the invasive species accounting for more than 50% of plant coverage along some stretches of Sucker Creek and the Onion River.

==Demographics==

As of the census of 2009, there were 2,008 people, 547 households, and 421 families residing in the town. The population density was 42.3 people per square mile (16.3/km2). There were 631 housing units at an average density of 17.7 per square mile (6.8/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 98.02% White, 0.07% Native American, 0.53% Asian, 0.40% from other races, and 0.99% from two or more races. 1.06% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 547 households, out of which 33.1% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 66.7% were married couples living together, 6.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 22.9% were non-families. 18.3% of all households were made up of individuals, and 6.4% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.77 and the average family size was 3.19.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 27.0% under the age of 18, 6.4% from 18 to 24, 28.5% from 25 to 44, 25.0% from 45 to 64, and 13.2% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 39 years. For every 100 females, there were 109.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 110.1 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $57,865, and the median income for a family was $62,500. Males had a median income of $42,083 versus $26,875 for females. The per capita income for the town was $24,746. About 1.6% of families and 2.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 0.5% of those under age 18 and 2.3% of those age 65 or over.

==Culture==

Northern Ozaukee County—including the Belgium community—was a center of Luxembourgian-American settlement in the United States in the 19th century, and the town and village of Belgium continue to have strong cultural ties to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Since 1977, the village has been home to the Luxembourg American Cultural Society &amp; Center, which is sponsored by the Luxembourg Government Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Economy. The society facilitates a program to help Americans of Luxembourgish ancestry get dual citizenship, organizes guided tours of the Grand Duchy, and maintains a museum devoted to the history of Luxembourg and Luxembourgish immigration to the United States. Since 1987, the society has also organized an annual Luxembourg Fest featuring tradition cuisine such as träipen.

Many of the Luxembourgers who settled in northern Ozaukee County were Catholic and established Catholic parishes in rural parts of the county. The hamlets of Dacada, Holy Cross, and Lake Church formed around the Catholic parishes of St. Nicholas, Holy Cross, and St. Mary, respectively. The Divine Savior Catholic Congregation, based out of Fredonia, administers the Catholic churches and chapels in the Town of Belgium as well as the St. Rose of Lima Chapel in Fredonia, St. Mary Mother of Sorrows Church in the hamlet of Little Kohler, and Our Lady of the Lakes in Random Lake. The parish also operates a parochial school for kindergarten through sixth grades in Fredonia.

==Law and government==

Belgium is organized as a town governed by an elected board, comprising a chairman and two supervisors. The current chairman is Thomas Winker. The town hall is located on Main Street in the Village of Belgium.

As part of Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district, Belgium is represented by Glenn Grothman (R) in the United States House of Representatives, and by Ron Johnson (R) and Tammy Baldwin (D) in the United States Senate. Duey Stroebel (R) represents Belgium in the Wisconsin State Senate, and Robert Brooks (R) represents Belgium in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

==Education==

The Town of Belgium is served by three school districts: the Cedar Grove-Belgium School District, the Northern Ozaukee School District, and the Random Lake School District. Students in the Cedar Grove-Belgium School District attend Cedar Grove-Belgium Elementary School for kindergarten through fourth grade, Cedar Grove-Belgium Middle School for fifth through eighth grades, and Cedar Grove-Belgium High School for ninth through twelfth grades. All of the district&#x27;s schools are located in Cedar Grove, Sheboygan County, north of the Town of Belgium. Students in the Northern Ozaukee School District, which also serves the villages of Fredonia and Newburg as well as parts of the towns of Fredonia and Saukville, attend Ozaukee Elementary School for kindergarten through fifth grade, Ozaukee Middle School for sixth through eighth grades, and Ozaukee High School for grades nine through twelve. Students in the Random Lake School District attend Random Lake Elementary School for kindergarten through fourth grade, Random Lake Middle School for fifth through eighth grades, and Random Lake High School for ninth through twelfth grades.

==Transportation==

Interstate 43 runs north–south through the eastern part of the town with access via Exit 107.

Ozaukee County Transit Services&#x27; Shared Ride Taxi provides a public transit option for Belgium residents. The taxis operate seven days a week and make connections to Washington County Transit and Milwaukee County Routes 12, 49 and 42u. Unlike a typical taxi, however, the rider must contact the service ahead of time to schedule their pick-up date and time, more closely resembling an Uber or Lyft ride. The taxi service plans their routes based on the number of riders, pick-up/drop-off time and destination then plans the routes accordingly.

The Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which is for pedestrian and bicycle use, passes through Belgium and connects the town to the neighboring communities of Port Washington and Cedar Grove, and continues north to Oostburg and south to Milwaukee County.

The Union Pacific Railroad operates a freight rail line running parallel to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, but Belgium currently does not have a passenger train station.

==Parks and recreation==

Harrington Beach State Park, the only Wisconsin State Park in Ozaukee County, is located on Lake Michigan&#x27;s shore in the Town of Belgium. The 715-acre park includes a white cedar and hardwood swamp, grasslands with restored wetland ponds and a flooded limestone quarry which is now a 26-acre lake stocked with fish. The park also contains hiking trails, a nature center, picnic facilities, a beach, and a 69-unit campground with bathing facilities.

The Ozaukee Washington Land Trust maintains the Forest Beach Migratory Preserve, a 116-acre nature preserve along Lake Michigan in the southern part of the town. The former site of a golf course, the preserve contains hardwood forests, grasslands, and restored wetlands as well as a nature center, and is a habitat for birds that migrate along the Great Lakes shores.

The Ozaukee Interurban Trail runs through the town, following the former route of the Milwaukee Interurban Rail Line. The southern end of the trail is at Bradley Road in Brown Deer which connects to the Oak Leaf Trail (), and its northern end is at DeMaster Road in the Village of Oostburg, Sheboygan County (). The trail connects the community to neighboring Port Washington and Cedar Grove.

<doc id="260594" wikidata="Q2025327" url="?curid=260594" title="Belgium, Wisconsin">
<text>Belgium is a village in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. Located along Interstate 43, the village is one of the northernmost communities in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The population was 2,245 at the 2020 census.

Beginning in the 1840s, immigrant farmers from Luxembourg settled in Northern Ozaukee County and formed several rural communities, including Belgium as well as the neighboring hamlets of Dacada, Holy Cross, and Lake Church. Although Belgium grew after a railroad was constructed through the community and incorporated as a village in 1922, the community remained primarily agricultural in the 20th century. As recently as 2015, the local cannery, which processes fruits and vegetables harvested at area farms, was by far the village&#x27;s largest employer.

The village continues to have strong cultural ties to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Members of the Grand Ducal Family of Luxembourg have visited, and the Luxembourg Government sponsors the Luxembourg American Cultural Society and Museum in the community. Among other programs, the center assists Americans of Luxembourgish ancestry in applying for dual citizenship, and since 1987 the village has hosted an annual festival devoted to Luxembourgish food and culture.

==Toponymy==
Since its beginning, Belgium has had a large population of Luxembourgish Americans. In 1857, the immigrant settlers submitted the name &quot;Luxembourg&quot; to the U.S. Postal Service for review. At the same time, a group of Belgian-American settlers in Kewaunee County, Wisconsin, submitted the name &quot;Belgium&quot; as the name for their majority Belgian-American town. Due to a clerical error, the names were switched with the result that Belgium, Wisconsin, is a center of Luxembourgish-American settlement, and Luxemburg, Wisconsin, is a center of Belgian-American settlement.

==History==
Northeastern Ozaukee County, including the town and village Belgium, was inhabited by several Native American tribes, including the Menominee. The Menominee surrendered the land that would become Belgium to the United States Federal Government through the 1832 &quot;Treaty of Washington&quot;.

In the late 1840s, immigrants from Luxembourg began to settle in what would become northeastern Ozaukee County. In 1848, the town of Belgium was created out of the town of Port Washington.

The Northwestern Railway Company set up a station in 1864. The Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway began running through the community in 1872, spurring population growth. In the early 20th Century, Belgium was a stop on the Milwaukee Interurban Line, which ran between Milwaukee and Sheboygan from 1908 until 1948. The population began to concentrate around the railroad station, and the community incorporated as the Village of Belgium in 1922.

In 1945, sixty German prisoners of war from Camp Fredonia in Little Kohler, Wisconsin were contracted to work at Krier Preserving Company in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in World War II. The camp was under the command of Captain Ray Thill, a native of the Village of Belgium.

The Ozaukee County line of the Interurban declined and ceased operation following World War II, but the village continued to grow in the mid-20th Century after the construction of Interstate 43, connecting Milwaukee to Green Bay.

Since 1977, Belgium has been home to the Luxembourg American Cultural Society &amp; Center, including the Roots and Leaves Museum, which is devoted to telling &quot;the story of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, past and present, as well as Luxembourg immigration to America the impact of Luxembourg immigrants and their descendants on life in America.&quot; In 1987, Prince Henri, then-heir-apparent to the crown of Luxembourg, and Princess Maria Teresa visited the village. In 2016, Guillaume, Hereditary Grand Duke of Luxembourg and Stéphanie, Hereditary Grand Duchess of Luxembourg visited Belgium on a trip to the United States.

==Geography==
The Village of Belgium is located at (43.500735, -87.846897). According to the United States Census Bureau, Belgium has a total area of , all of it land. The village is surrounded by the Town of Belgium and is located two miles (3 km) west of Lake Michigan and adjacent to conjoined Interstate 43-State Highway 32.

The village is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources considers the village to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Belgium area was a mixture of upland and lowland forests. The upland forests were dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees, while the lowland conifer forests and swamps were dominated by white cedar and tamarack. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Belgium. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, and red foxes can be seen in the village. The rural areas surrounding the village are also home to several bird habitats, including Harrington Beach State Park which is located on the shore of Lake Michigan and is one of two Wisconsin Important Bird Areas in Ozaukee County. The open fields in the western part of the park are a breeding ground for upland sandpipers.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles. Some of the wetlands in the Town of Belgium are especially affected by reed canary grass, with the invasive species accounting for more than 50% of plant coverage along some stretches of Sucker Creek and the Onion River.

==Culture==
Northern Ozaukee County — including the Belgium community — was a center of Luxembourgish-American settlement in the United States in the 19th century, and the Village of Belgium continues to have strong cultural ties to the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg. Banners along Main Street read &quot;Wëllkomm,&quot; which means &quot;Welcome&quot; in Luxembourgish. Since 1977, Belgium has been home to the Luxembourg American Cultural Society &amp; Center, which is sponsored by the Luxembourg Government Ministry of Culture and Ministry of Economy. The society facilitates a program to help Americans of Luxembourgish ancestry get dual citizenship, organizes guided tours of the Grand Duchy, and maintains a museum devoted to the history of Luxembourg and Luxembourgish immigration to the United States. Since 1987, the society has also organized an annual Luxembourg Fest featuring tradition cuisine such as träipen.

Many of the Luxembourgers who settled in northern Ozaukee County were Catholic and established Catholic parishes in rural parts of the county. The hamlets of Dacada, Holy Cross, and Lake Church in the Town of Belgium formed around Catholic parishes that primarily served Luxembourger farmers. The Village of Belgium is also home to two evangelical churches — Belgium Community Church and Christian Life Church — as well as St. Mark Lutheran Church, which is affiliated with the Missouri Synod.

==Economy==
==Law and government==
Belgium is organized as a village governed by an elected village board, comprising a village president and six trustees who are elected to three-year terms. The current president is Pete Anzia, who was elected to his first term in April 2014.

As part of Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district, Belgium is represented by Glenn Grothman (R) in the United States House of Representatives, and by Ron Johnson (R) and Tammy Baldwin (D) in the United States Senate. Duey Stroebel (R) represents Belgium in the Wisconsin State Senate, and Robert Brooks (R) represents Belgium in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

The village is served by the Belgium Volunteer Fire Department, which operates one fire station in the village. The department does not have its own ambulances an relies upon the neighboring Village of Fredonia&#x27;s fire department for ambulance service.

Belgium&#x27;s law enforcement officer is the village marshal. Unlike a municipality with a police department, the village marshal does not provide 24-hour law enforcement, and the village is served by the Ozaukee County Sheriff&#x27;s Department when the marshal is off duty and in emergency situations.

==Education==
The village is served by the joint Cedar Grove-Belgium School District. Students attend Cedar Grove-Belgium Elementary School for kindergarten through fourth grade, Cedar Grove-Belgium Middle School for fifth through eighth grades, and Cedar Grove-Belgium High School for ninth through twelfth grades. All of the district&#x27;s schools are located in Cedar Grove, Sheboygan County, north of the Village of Belgium. The district is governed by a seven-member elected board of education.

The Cedar Grove-Belgium School District made national headlines in April 2024 when the desired characteristics listed by the Board of Education in its official search for a new Superintendent of Schools cited &quot;Christian Values&quot; as well as &quot;conservative politics&quot; as those characteristics sought in a successful candidate. Questions were raised in many quarters about the legality of a &quot;religious test&quot; for the position in light of the provisions of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as well as the propriety of insisting on specific political views. Subsequent to publication of the District&#x27;s Search Document, a public meeting concerning the Search was abruptly cancelled. 

==Transportation==
Interstate 43 runs parallel to the village&#x27;s eastern municipal boundary with access via Exit 107.

Ozaukee County Transit Services&#x27; Shared Ride Taxi provides a public transit option for Belgium residents. The taxis operate seven days a week and make connections to Washington County Transit and Milwaukee County Routes 12, 49 and 42u. Unlike a typical taxi, however, the rider must contact the service ahead of time to schedule their pick-up date and time. The taxi service plans their routes based on the number of riders, pick-up/drop-off time and destination then plans the routes accordingly.

The Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which is for pedestrian and bicycle use, passes through Belgium and connects the village to the neighboring communities of Port Washington and Cedar Grove, and continues north to Oostburg and south to Milwaukee County.

The Union Pacific Railroad operates a freight rail line running parallel to the Ozaukee Interurban Trail in the village, but Belgium currently does not have a passenger train station.

==Parks and recreation==
The Village of Belgium maintains six public parks with amenities including baseball and softball diamonds; basketball, tennis, and volleyball courts; an ice-skating rink; picnic shelters; playgrounds; soccer fields; a splash pad; a three-acre fenced dog park; and walking trails. Grand Duke Henri Plaza, located between the village hall and the Luxembourg American Cultural Center, contains the &quot;Wisconsin&#x27;s Luxembourgers&quot; State Historical Marker as well as a statue of Henri, Grand Duke of Luxembourg, who visited the village in 1987.

Harrington Beach State Park, the only Wisconsin State Park in Ozaukee County, is located directly east of the village on the shore of Lake Michigan.

The Ozaukee Interurban Trail runs through the village, following the former route of the Milwaukee Interurban Rail Line. The southern end of the trail is at Bradley Road in Brown Deer which connects to the Oak Leaf Trail (), and its northern end is at DeMaster Road in the Village of Oostburg Sheboygan County (). The trail connects the community to neighboring Port Washington and Cedar Grove.

The Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary was established in 2021 in the waters of Lake Michigan off Belgium.

<text>Cedarburg is a town in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States, and is in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The town was created in 1849 and at the time of the 2020 census had a population of 6,162.

German and Irish immigrants first settled in Cedarburg in the 1840s. Their centers of settlement became the unincorporated communities of Decker Corner, Hamilton, and Horns Corners, as well as the City of Cedarburg, which is located partially within the town.

The town contains three sites listed on the National Register of Historic Places: the Cedarburg covered bridge, the Concordia Mill, and the Hamilton Historic District. The bridge is the last historic covered bridge in the state and is featured on the town logo.

== History ==

The earliest evidence of humans in the Cedarburg area is the Hilgen Spring Mound Site, located in the eastern part of the city of Cedarburg, near Cedar Creek. The site consists of three conical burial mounds constructed by early Woodland period Mound Builders. In 1968, archaeologists from the Milwaukee Public Museum found human burials and artifacts, including stone altars, arrowheads, and pottery shards, during an excavation of one of the mounds. Radiocarbon samples from the excavation date the mounds&#x27; construction to approximately 480 BCE, making it one of the oldest mound groups in the state.

In the early 19th century, the land was inhabited by Native Americans, including the Potawatomi and Sauk tribes. The Potawatomi surrendered the land the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

The first white settlement in the Cedarburg area was a community called &quot;New Dublin,&quot; which later became Hamilton. The first resident was Joseph Gardenier, who built a log shanty on Cedar Creek as his headquarters for surveying for the construction of the Green Bay Road. In 1848, Hamilton became the first stop on the stagecoach route between Milwaukee and Green Bay.

Most of Cedarburg&#x27;s early settlers were German immigrants. Ludwig Wilhelm Groth is usually credited with being the first settler of Cedarburg. He purchased land from the government on October 22, 1842, and began platting the banks of Cedar Creek. The Wisconsin state legislature created the Town of Cedarburg on March 2, 1849.

The first train line, which eventually became part of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway, began running through Cedarburg in 1870. Cedarburg continued to grow and prosper due to its rail connections, while the surrounding communities of Hamilton, Decker Corner and Horns Corners remained more characteristically rural. The City of Cedarburg incorporated from some of the town&#x27;s land in 1885.

The Excelsior Mill was built on Cedar Creek in the town in 1871 for $21,000. The mill produced both flour and lumber. In 1885, a large fire gutted the stone mill and destroyed the wooden outbuildings, causing the business to close. In 1890, John Weber, who owned the Columbia Mill upstream in the City of Cedarburg, bought the property and retooled the mill as a wire and nail factory.

Cedarburg grew rapidly during the post-war suburbanization and economic prosperity, and the City of Cedarburg began to annex land from the town for residential subdivisions.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the Town of Cedarburg has a total area of 25.8 square miles (66.9 km2), of which, 25.6 square miles (66.3 km2) of it is land and 0.2 square miles (0.6 km2) of it (0.93%) is water.

The City of Cedarburg is mostly located in what was formerly the town&#x27;s southeastern quadrant. The town is also bordered by the Town of Saukville and the Town of Trenton to the north, the Village of Grafton and the Town of Grafton to the east, the City of Mequon to the south, and the Town of Jackson to the west.

The unincorporated communities of Decker Corner, Hamilton, and Horns Corners are also located in the town.

The town is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The soil in area is a mixture of well-draining material, loess, and loam, which all overlie a layer of glacial till. The town has some Silurian limestone deposits, including land around the City of Cedarburg. The early settlers utilized the area&#x27;s limestone as a building material, and some mid-19th-century limestone structures still stand today.

Cedar Creek runs through the town from the Town of Jackson. It joins the Milwaukee River downstream in Grafton. The creek&#x27;s lower reaches in the City of Cedarburg have high levels of PCB contamination, and in 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources believed that Cedar Creek had the highest PCB contamination level in the state. Despite cleanup efforts, the Wisconsin DNR advises against eating any fish caught in the creek downstream from the Bridge Road dam. Mole Creek, a tributary of the Milwaukee River, flows through the Town of Cedarburg&#x27;s Pleasant Valley Nature Park.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, much of the Cedarburg area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also white cedars growing along Cedar Creek. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture, and in the 21st century much of the town&#x27;s land continues to be used for agriculture.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Cedarburg. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, and red foxes can be seen in the town. There have been infrequent sightings of black bears in Ozaukee County communities, including a 2005 report of a bear in a Cedarburg city park. Many birds, including sandhill cranes and wild turkeys are found in and around the town. The Wisconsin Bird Conservation Initiative considers the Cedarburg Bog, located north of the town in the Town of Saukville, to be a Wisconsin Important Bird Area. The rare Goldenseal plant grows in a woodland on the northern boundary between the town and the City of Cedarburg.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

Duey Stroebel (R) represents Cedarburg in the Wisconsin State Senate, and Robert Brooks (R) represents Cedarburg in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

===Cedarburg Fire Department===
Cedarburg&#x27;s volunteer fire department was founded in 1866. There are two active fire stations in the community: one on Mequon Avenue in the City of Cedarburg, and the other on Covered Bridge Road in the Town of Cedarburg. Jeffrey Vahsholtz has served as fire chief since 2014.

Since 1966, the fire department has organized &quot;Maxwell Street Days&quot; flea markets each summer as a fundraiser.

==Education==
Most of the Town of Cedarburg&#x27;s public school students are served by the Cedarburg School District. The district has three elementary schools, serving grades kindergarten through fifth grade: Parkview Elementary, Thorson Elementary, and Westlawn Elementary. Each elementary school serves areas of the town and the city. Webster Middle School serves the entire district for grades six through eight, and Cedarburg High School serves grades nine through twelve. Some residents living in the northeastern part of the town are served by the Grafton School District.

The district is governed by a seven-member elected school board, which meets on the third Thursday of each month at Cedarburg High School. The district also a superintendent. Todd Bugnacki, the current superintendent, has held the position since 2015.

The district frequently appears on lists of the best schools in the state.

<doc id="260596" wikidata="Q1052560" url="?curid=260596" title="Cedarburg, Wisconsin">
<text>Cedarburg ( ) is a city in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. Located about north of Milwaukee and in close proximity to Interstate 43, it is a suburb in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The city incorporated in 1885, and at the time of the 2020 census the population was 12,121.

Like many of Ozaukee County&#x27;s cities and villages, the City of Cedarburg began as a mill town. German immigrants began building hydropowered gristmills and woolen mills along Cedar Creek in the 1840s. The community that sprang up around the mills is now downtown Cedarburg. The city was distinctly German into the early 20th century, with several Lutheran churches, a brewery, a European-style spa resort called Hilgen Spring Park, and many German cultural associations, including two Turner societies.

Cedarburg changed significantly during the period of post-World War II suburbanization. While the mills had all closed by the 1960s, the city experienced rapid population growth and the development of new commercial properties and housing subdivisions. In spite of the changes, more than 200 of Cedarburg&#x27;s historic buildings have been preserved, and the city is home to eight listings on the National Register of Historic Places. The community profits from a vibrant tourist industry and hosts festivals and events throughout the year that attract visitors from other areas.

==Toponymy==
When the first settlers—many of whom were German speakers—arrived in the area, they found white cedar trees growing on the banks of Cedar Creek. Early German-American settler Frederick Leuning built a cabin near the creek&#x27;s eastern bank in 1843 and referred to his home as the &quot;Cedarburg,&quot; meaning the &quot;cedar castle&quot; or the &quot;fortress of the cedars.&quot; In December 1844, the early residents agreed to name the community Cedarburg.

== History ==
The earliest evidence of humans in the Cedarburg area is the Hilgen Spring Mound Site, located in the eastern part of the city of Cedarburg, near Cedar Creek. The site consists of three conical burial mounds constructed by early Woodland period Mound Builders. In 1968, archaeologists from the Milwaukee Public Museum found human burials and artifacts, including stone altars, arrowheads, and pottery shards, during an excavation of one of the mounds. Radiocarbon samples from the excavation date the mounds&#x27; construction to approximately 480 BCE, making it one of the oldest mound groups in the state.

In the early 19th century, the land was inhabited by Native Americans, including the Potawatomi and Sauk tribes. The Potawatomi surrendered the land the United States Federal Government in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago, which (after being ratified in 1835) required them to leave Wisconsin by 1838. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands which were now owned by white settlers. Eventually the Native people who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

The first white settlement in the Cedarburg area was a community called &quot;New Dublin,&quot; which later became Hamilton in the town of Cedarburg. The first resident was Joseph Gardenier, who built a log shanty on Cedar Creek as his headquarters for surveying for the construction of the Green Bay Road. In 1848, Hamilton became the first stop on the stagecoach route between Milwaukee and Green Bay.

Most of Cedarburg&#x27;s early settlers were German immigrants. Ludwig Wilhelm Groth is usually credited with being the first settler of Cedarburg. He purchased land from the government on October 22, 1842, and began platting the banks of Cedar Creek. In 1845, Frederick Hilgen and William Schroeder built a wooden gristmill on Cedar Creek. After eleven years of operation, they replaced the original structure with the five-story, stone Cedarburg Mill, which became the focal point of the new community. Five dams and mills were eventually built along the creek in what are now the city and town of Cedarburg, including the 1864 Hilgen and Wittenberg Woolen Mill, which was the largest woolen mill west of Philadelphia.

In 1870, the Milwaukee and Northern Railway connected Cedarburg to Milwaukee. By 1873 the rail line extended from Milwaukee to Green Bay, connecting Cedarburg and other small communities to larger markets. Cedarburg continued to grow and prosper due to its rail connections, while the surrounding communities of Hamilton, Decker Corner and Horns Corners remained more characteristically rural. Cedarburg incorporated in 1885. At the time, the population was approximately 1,000 people.

In 1897, the woolen mill purchased an electrical generator, which produced the first electric light in the town. In 1901, the city contracted an electric plant with steam engines running two 75 kW generators, and in 1909 the Cedarburg Electric Light Commission was formed to run the utility. In 1923, responsibility for water and sewerage was given to the utility, and it was renamed the Light &amp; Water Commission. The utility is still in business today, and is one of 82 municipally owned electric utilities in Wisconsin.

In 1907, Cedarburg became a stop on the Milwaukee-Northern interurban passenger line. The company operated an office and shop in Cedarburg into the 1920s, when it was purchased by The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company. The company continued passenger rail service to Cedarburg until 1948, when the Ozaukee County line declined due to increased use of personal automobiles and better roads.

Cedarburg grew rapidly during the post-war suburbanization and economic prosperity. The population increased by more than 84% between 1950 and 1960, from 2,810 to 5,191. This period of population growth witnessed the growth of new industries and housing developments.

== Geography ==

Cedarburg is located at 43°17&#x27;56&quot; North, 87°59&#x27;13&quot; West (43.29896, −87.987209). According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, of it is land and is water. The City of Cedarburg is bordered by the Village of Grafton to the east, the City of Mequon to the south, and the Town of Cedarburg to the north and west.

The city is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The soil in area is a mixture of well-draining material, loess, and loam, which all overlie a layer of glacial till. Most of the City of Cedarburg is located on top of a Silurian limestone deposit. There were several quarries active in the area, including the now-defunct Groth Quarry in Zeunert Park where excavators discovered fossils from a prehistoric reef. The early settlers utilized the area&#x27;s limestone as a building material, and some mid-19th-century limestone structures still stand today.

Cedar Creek runs through the city parallel to the Washington Avenue historic and commercial district. In 1993, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources believed that Cedar Creek had the PCB contamination in the state. The creek is now part of an Environmental Protection Agency Superfund site in the city. Despite cleanup efforts, the Wisconsin DNR advises against eating any fish caught in the creek downstream from the Bridge Road dam.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Cedarburg area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also white cedars growing along Cedar Creek. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture. In the 21st century, the City of Cedarburg plants and maintains over 8,000 trees in public spaces, and the Arbor Day Foundation has recognized Cedarburg through its Tree City USA program.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Cedarburg. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, and red foxes can be seen within the city limits. There have been infrequent sightings of black bears in Ozaukee County communities, including a 2005 report of a bear in a Cedarburg city park. Many birds, including great blue herons and wild turkeys are found in and around the City of Cedarburg. The Wisconsin Bird Conservation Initiative considers the Cedarburg Bog, located north of the city in the Town of Saukville, to be a Wisconsin Important Bird Area. The rare Goldenseal plant grows in a woodland on the northern boundary between the city and the Town of Cedarburg.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

===Early industry===
As is the case in many of the cities and villages in Ozaukee County, Cedarburg&#x27;s earliest businesses were hydropowered mills. In 1843, Frederick Luening built the Columbia Mill, a gristmill, which was the first mill on Cedar Creek. Following the Columbia Mill in 1845, Frederick Hilgen and William Schroeder built another gristmill further upstream. Neither of these structures remain, but other 19th century mills do survive, including the 1853 Concordia Mill; the 1855 Cedarburg Mill, which replaced Hilgen and Schroeder&#x27;s earlier grist mill; the 1864 Hilgen and Wittenberg Woolen Mill; and the 1871 Excelsior Mill, which was later retooled as the Cedarburg Wire and Nail Factory. Other early structures near the creek that survive include an 1848 brewery.

===20th century industry===
In the 20th century, Cedarburg had some manufacturing firms. Carl Kiekhaefer founded Mercury Marine in Cedarburg in 1939, and the company operated a plant on St. John Avenue until 1982. The building was demolished in 2005. Amcast operated an aluminum die-casting plant on Hamilton Road until 2005. Both companies polluted the soil and waters of Cedar Creek with PCBs, and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is using Superfund money to clean up the sites.

===21st century industry===
PartsBadger, an online machining company based in Cedarburg was founded in 2016.

=== Tourism ===
The Hilgen and Wittenberg Woolen Mill closed in 1968 and sat vacant for several years, until an offer was made to buy the buildings. The prospective owner intended to tear them down and build a gas station and a mini-mart. Then mayor, Stephan Fischer, told him he would need a demolition permit. There was no such thing, but it bought enough time that the buildings could be saved. William Welty bought the buildings on the corner and street, opening a restaurant. Jim Pape then bought the mill buildings on the creekside, opening a winery. Known as the Cedar Creek Settlement, the rest of the space was rented out to shops, studios and restaurants.

This began a tourism boom in Cedarburg. More galleries and studios opened, as well as souvenir shops and other attractions. Business associations started weekend festivals, which attracted even more people to the city. As of 2020, the city hosts Winter Festival in February, Strawberry Festival in June, Wine and Harvest Festival in September, and German-themed Oktoberfest in October, as well as Christmas events in November and December. In the summer months, local companies sponsor a concert series called Summer Sounds which takes place at Cedar Creek Park.

Many Cedarburg residents who do not work in the tourist industry commute for work, reflecting the larger trend of Ozaukee County as a majority-commuter community.

==Culture==
Cedarburg&#x27;s first German settlers&#x27; influence is still visible in the 21st century. There are six Lutheran congregations in the community; Trinity Lutheran Church on Columbia Road is the oldest, having been founded in 1843 by a group of Old Lutheran immigrants from the Prussian Province of Pomerania. Many 19th-century buildings have German inscriptions on their capstones, and the oldest gravestones in city cemeteries are in German. The Zur Ruhe Cemetery on Bridge Street takes its name from a German phrase meaning &quot;to rest.&quot;

===Cedarburg Public Library===
The Cedarburg Women&#x27;s Club established the city&#x27;s public library in 1911. In addition to its collection of approximately 72,000 items, the library provides patrons with digital resources, study rooms and a community meeting room in its 25,500 square foot facility. Cedarburg Public Library is a member of the Monarch Library System, comprising thirty-one libraries in Ozaukee, Sheboygan, Washington, and Dodge counties.

===Events and festivals===
Cedarburg hosts the Ozaukee County Fair at Firemen&#x27;s Park, on Washington Avenue, north of downtown. The fair has been held annually since 1859. The event is free, and includes live music, truck and tractor pulls, rides, a demolition derby, and 4-H and livestock exhibitions.

Firemen&#x27;s Park also hosts four &quot;Maxwell Street Days&quot; flea markets each summer as a fundraiser for the Cedarburg Fire Department. Up 600 vendors can have tables at one of the flea markets.

As of 2020, the city hosts five weekend festivals, including Winter Festival in February, Strawberry Festival in June, Wine and Harvest Festival in September, and German-themed Oktoberfest in October, as well as Christmas events in November and December. In the summer months, local companies sponsor a concert series called Summer Sounds which takes place at Cedar Creek Park.

First Immanuel Lutheran is part of the Missouri Synod, and Redeemer Evangelical Lutheran Church is part of the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod.

The city also has the Methodist Community United Methodist Church; the Christian Scientist First Church of Christ, Scientist of Cedarburg; the Heritage Baptist Church, a Regular Baptist congregation affiliated with the Wisconsin Association of Regular Baptist Churches; the Roman Catholic St. Francis Borgia parish; and the St. Nicholas Orthodox Church of the Antiochian Orthodox tradition. The evangelical Alliance Bible Church is located adjacent to the Cedarburg city limit in the City of Mequon.

==Law and government==
Cedarburg is organized under a mayor–council government. The current mayor is Mike O&#x27;Keefe, who was elected to his first four-year term on April 3, 2018. Seven aldermen sit on the Cedarburg common council in addition to the mayor. The council meets on the second and last Monday of each month at 7 p.m. The city&#x27;s day-to-day operations are managed by a full-time city administrator.

Duey Stroebel (R) represents Cedarburg in the Wisconsin State Senate, and Robert Brooks (R) represents Cedarburg in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

===Cedarburg Fire Department===
Cedarburg&#x27;s volunteer fire department was founded in 1866.

Since 1966, the fire department has organized &quot;Maxwell Street Days&quot; flea markets each summer as a fundraiser.

===Cedarburg Police Department===
The Cedarburg Police Department was established in 1885 when the city incorporated.

===Utilities===
The Cedarburg Light &amp; Water Utility is one of approximately 2,200 publicly owned utilities in the United States. It was formed in 1909 to operate the city&#x27;s first power plant, which had been built eight years earlier. The utility is responsible for both electricity and water supply in the city, and is run by a commission of seven residents appointed by the mayor, one of whom must be a member of city council.

==Education==
Cedarburg&#x27;s public schools are operated by the Cedarburg School District. The district has three elementary schools, serving grades kindergarten through fifth grade: Parkview Elementary, Thorson Elementary, and Westlawn Elementary. Each elementary school serves a different neighborhoods of the city. Webster Middle School serves the entire district for grades six through eight, and Cedarburg High School serves grades nine through twelve.

The district serves the City of Cedarburg, the Town of Cedarburg, and some neighboring parts of the City of Mequon and the Village of Grafton. The district is governed by a seven-member elected school board, which meets on the third Thursday of each month at Cedarburg High School. The district also a superintendent. Todd Bugnacki, the current superintendent, has held the position since 2015.

The district frequently appears on lists of the best schools in the state.

The city also has two parochial schools that serve students from kindergarten through eight grade: First Immanuel Lutheran School and St. Francis Borgia Catholic School.

==Transportation==
Cedarburg is located approximately three miles west of Interstate 43 exit 89. The city is also located south of the intersection of Wisconsin Highway 60 and Washington Avenue.

Cedarburg has limited public transit compared with larger cities. Ozaukee County and the Milwaukee County Transit System run the Route 143 commuter bus, also known as the &quot;Ozaukee County Express,&quot; to Milwaukee via Interstate 43. The bus stops at the park-and-ride lot by Cedarburg&#x27;s interstate on- and offramps. The bus operates eight trips to Milwaukee on weekday mornings and nine trips from Milwaukee on weekday evenings, corresponding to peak commute times. Ozaukee County Transit Services&#x27; Shared Ride Taxi is the public transit option for traveling to sites not directly accessible from the interstate. The taxis operate seven days a week and make connections to Washington County Transit and Milwaukee County Routes 12, 49 and 42u.

The City of Cedarburg has sidewalks in most areas, as well as the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which is for pedestrian and bicycle use, and connects the city to the neighboring communities of Grafton and Mequon, and continues north to Sheboygan County and south to Milwaukee County.

Cedarburg grew from a rural hamlet into an incorporated city in part because of its 19th century rail connections. From 1907 to 1948, Cedarburg was connected to Milwaukee and Sheboygan by an interurban passenger rail line, which fell into disuse following World War II and was converted into a bicycle and pedestrian trail in the 1990s. The Wisconsin Central Ltd. railroad provides freight rail service to Cedarburg as part of its Saukville subdivision. While Cedarburg has not had passenger rail in many decades, passenger rail is offered by Amtrak in nearby Milwaukee at the Milwaukee Intermodal Station.

==Parks and recreation==
The City of Cedarburg maintains thirty-four parks, encompassing a total of 146 acres. These range from as small as the .1 acre Doctor&#x27;s Park on the corner of Washington Avenue and Mill Street and the .25 acre Skateboard Park on Johnson Avenue to the twenty-three acre Centennial Park, which includes a public pool, two ponds, a sledding hill, and a playground designed to accommodate children with disabilities.

The Ozaukee Interurban Trail runs through the City of Cedarburg, following the former route of the Milwaukee Interurban Rail Line. The southern end of the trail is at Bradley Road in Brown Deer which connects to the Oak Leaf Trail (), and its northern end is at DeMaster Road in the Village of Oostburg Sheboygan County (). The Cedarburg segment of the trail was completed in 1996, and connects the community to neighboring Grafton and Mequon.

Cedarburg is also home to several private recreational facilities, including a golf course, two bowling alleys, several workout gyms, the Milwaukee Curling Club, a gymnastics facility, a roller rink, and the Ozaukee Ice Center, a year-round hockey and skating rink.

<text>Fredonia is a village in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. Located on the Milwaukee River, the village is in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The population was 2,279 at the 2020 census.

The community was the site of a Potawatomi village until at least the 1840s. The first white settlers in the area were Yankees, Germans and Luxembourgers who arrived in the 1840s, but the community was rural until the 1870s when the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway built a station in the area and businesses began to cluster it, laying the foundation for the village. Fredonia grew, incorporating in 1922.

The village is located east of the unincorporated census-designated place of Waubeka, the location of the National Register of Historic Places-listed Stony Hill School where the first United States Flag Day was observed in 1885. Today, Waubeka is home to the National Flag Day Foundation headquarters and its Americanism Center Museum, which has an extensive collection of patriotic memorabilia.

==History==
The land that became the village of Fredonia was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the Potawatomi tribe, who surrendered the land to the United States government in 1833 through the &quot;1833 Treaty of Chicago&quot;. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. One such group was led by Chief Waubeka, who maintained a winter camp in the Ozaukee County community that bears his name as late as 1845. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

Fredonia was part of the Town of Port Washington until 1847, when the Town of Fredonia was created and named after Fredonia, New York. A post office called Fredonia has been in operation since 1850.

The Village of Fredonia had its origins in 1873 when the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway constructed Fredonia Station. At the time, the community of Waubeka was the center of the Town of Fredonia, but after the station was built businesses, granaries, and houses sprouted up around the station. The Village of Fredonia was incorporated in 1922 with a population of 272.

Camp Fredonia, an Allied prisoner of war camp that held 330 German prisoners of war, was located in nearby Little Kohler. In 1945, sixty of the prisoners were contracted to work at Fredonia Can Goods, Inc. in the village.

==Geography==

Fredonia is located at (43.468471, -87.95183). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of land and of water. The Village of Fredonia is located in what was formerly the southwestern quadrant of the Town of Fredonia. The village&#x27;s industrial park in the southern part of the village borders the Town of Saukville to the south. The unincorporated census-designated place of Waubeka is west of the village.

The village is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The area has some subterranean Silurian limestone formations that are part of the Racine Dolomite that stretches through eastern Wisconsin and Illinois. The rocks are visible at two 19th-century quarries west of the village.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Village of Fredonia area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also white cedars growing along the Milwaukee River, which flows along the village&#x27;s western boundary. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture, but there&#x27;s a two-mile stretch of forest along the river around Waubedonia Park.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Fredonia. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, North American river otters and red foxes can be seen in the village. Many birds, including great blue herons and wild turkeys are found in the village.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

==Economy==
==Law and government==

Fredonia is organized as a village governed by an elected village board, comprising a village president and six trustees. The current President is Dan Gehrke. In 2022, the Village adopted a Village Administrator-form of government, hiring a full-time Administrator who works for the Board of Trustees and manages the day-to-day operations. The current Administrator is Christophe E. Jenkins - who was formerly the Mayor of the City of West Bend, WI. 

As part of Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district, Fredonia is represented by Glenn Grothman (R) in the United States House of Representatives, and by Ron Johnson (R) and Tammy Baldwin (D) in the United States Senate. Duey Stroebel (R) represents Fredonia in the Wisconsin State Senate, and Robert Brooks (R) represents Fredonia in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

The Fredonia Fire Department was formed in 1923, and has a staff of seventeen firefighters and eight EMTs. Brian Weyker serves as fire chief. The department is the first-responder for the Town of Fredonia and the Village of Fredonia, collaborating with the volunteer fire department in the neighboring unincorporated community of Waubeka. The department also provides ambulance service for the Village of Belgium.

Fredonia&#x27;s law enforcement officer is the village marshal. Unlike a municipality with a police department, the village marshal does not provide 24-hour law enforcement, and when the marshal is off-duty, the village is served by the Ozaukee County Sheriff&#x27;s Department. Eric Leet currently holds the office.

==Education==
The Village of Fredonia is served by the Northern Ozaukee School District, which also covers Newburg, and parts of the towns of Belgium, Fredonia and Saukville. Students attend Ozaukee Elementary School for kindergarten through fifth grade, Ozaukee Middle School for sixth through eighth grades, and Ozaukee High School for grades nine through twelve. Additionally, the Riveredge School is a tuition-free, public elementary charter school authorized by the district. Located at the Riveredge Nature Center in the northwestern Town of Saukville near the municipal boundary with the Village of Newburg, the school serves children from kindergarten through fifth grade.

The district is governed by an eight-member elected school board, which meets on the third Monday of each month at 6:30 p.m. in the high school and middle school&#x27;s shared library.

Divine Savior Congregation operates a Catholic parochial school in the village offering kindergarten- through eighth grade education.

==Transportation==
Wisconsin Highway 57 passes through the village.

Ozaukee County Transit Services&#x27; Shared Ride Taxi provides a public transit option for Fredonia residents. The taxis operate seven days a week and make connections to Washington County Transit and Milwaukee County Routes 12, 49 and 42u. Unlike a typical taxi, however, the rider must contact the service ahead of time to schedule their pick-up date and time. The taxi service plans their routes based on the number of riders, pick-up/drop-off time and destination then plans the routes accordingly.

The Wisconsin and Southern Railroad operates a freight line that passes through the village. Fredonia currently does not have a passenger train station.

==Parks and recreation==
The Village of Fredonia maintains seven public parks with amenities including playgrounds, baseball diamonds, soccer fields, picnic shelters, and ice-skating rink, and an eighteen-hole disc golf course. Additionally, Ozaukee County maintains Waubedonia County Park on the east bank of the Milwaukee River. The only county-maintained park to offer overnight campsites, Waubedonia also offers baseball diamonds, tennis courts, and boat launches.

<text>Fredonia is a town in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,903 at the 2000 census. The Village of Fredonia is surrounded by the town. The unincorporated communities of Little Kohler and Waubeka are also located in the town.

==History==
The land that became the Fredonia was originally inhabited by Native Americans, including the Potawatomi tribe, who surrendered the land to the United States government in 1833 through the 1833 Treaty of Chicago. While many Native people moved west of the Mississippi River to Kansas, some chose to remain, and were referred to as &quot;strolling Potawatomi&quot; in contemporary documents because many of them were migrants who subsisted by squatting on their ancestral lands, which were now owned by white settlers. One such group was led by Chief Waubeka, who maintained a winter camp in the Ozaukee County community that bears his name as late as 1845. Eventually the Potawatomi who evaded forced removal gathered in northern Wisconsin, where they formed the Forest County Potawatomi Community.

Fredonia was part of the Town of Port Washington until 1847, when the Town of Fredonia was created and named after Fredonia, New York. A post office called Fredonia has been in operation since 1850.

Waubeka was the town&#x27;s population center until the 1870s. In 1873, the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway construction Fredonia Station, which laid the foundation for the Village of Fredonia, which incorporated from some of the town&#x27;s land in 1922.

Camp Fredonia, an Allied prisoner of war camp that held 330 German prisoners of war, was located in the unincorporated community of Little Kohler in the town. Forty-six U.S. combat veterans guarded the camp under the command of Captain Ray Thill, a native of Belgium, Wisconsin. The camp opened on June 15, 1945, and closed in January 1946. The headquarters was located in the Louis Glunz Hall on Fredonia-Kohler Road, while the prisoners slept in tents in a fenced enclosure. Most of the prisoners worked on local farms harvesting peas and sugar beets. Some were contracted to work at canneries in West Bend, Thiensville, Saukville and Belgium.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 35.0 square miles (90.5 km2), of which, 34.7 square miles (89.8 km2) of it is land and 0.3 square miles (0.8 km2) of it (0.86%) is water. The Village of Fredonia is located in what was formerly the southwestern quadrant of the Town of Fredonia. The town borders the Town of Sherman to the north, the Town of Belgium to the east, the Town of Saukville to the south, and the Town of Farmington to the west. The unincorporated communities of Little Kohler and Waubeka are in the western part of the town.

The town is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The area has some subterranean Silurian limestone formations that are part of the Racine Dolomite that stretches through eastern Wisconsin and Illinois. The rocks are visible at several quarries along the Milwaukee River, including one site where the only known Silurian phyllocarid fossils in Wisconsin were discovered.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, much of the Fredonia area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture, although some of the town&#x27;s nature preserves have characteristically pre-settlement forests. The area also has many bogs and swamps in the kettles left behind by the glaciers. The areas include the wetlands around Spring Lake and the bog in the Huiras Lake Woods and Bog State Natural Area. Fredonia&#x27;s wetlands have extensive stands of white cedar and tamarack as well as shrub carrs and sedge meadows.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Fredonia. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, North American river otters and red foxes can be seen in the town. Many birds, including great blue herons and wild turkeys are found in the town, with the Huiras Lake Woods and Bog State Natural Area providing a habitat for many bird species.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

<text>The Town of Grafton is a town located in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States, and is in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The town was created in 1846 and at the time of the 2020 Census had a population of 4,157.

Grafton is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. German and Irish immigrants first settled in Grafton in the 1840s. Their centers of settlement became the unincorporated communities of Lakefield and Ulao, as well as the Village of Grafton, which is partially located in the town.

==History==

The first Europeans to visit the area were the Jesuit missionaries Claude-Jean Allouez and Claude Bablon, who visited a Native American village on the Milwaukee River near the future site of Grafton around the year 1670.

Timothy Wooden, who arrived in 1839 from the eastern United States, is considered Grafton&#x27;s first permanent resident. The majority of the early residents were immigrants from Germany and Ireland. The Wisconsin territorial legislature officially created the Town of Grafton in 1846.

James T. Gifford, an investor who founded Elgin, Illinois, developed the community of Ulao in 1847 as a port on Lake Michigan. At the time, steamships were common on the Great Lakes and burned massive amounts of wood for fuel. A steamship could consume wood equivalent to several acres worth of forest on single journey. Much of Grafton was primeval beech-maple forest, which settlers were clearing for agriculture, and Gifford saw an opportunity for Ulao to prosper as a steamship refueling station. He built a sawmill, a warehouse, and a one-thousand-foot-long pier on the lake where ships docked to buy wood. The community prospered in the 1850s and 1860s, but by the end of the American Civil War, Ozaukee County&#x27;s forests had been largely depleted, and Ulao declined, with most of the land being converted to agriculture.

The Village of Grafton was incorporated from some of the town&#x27;s land in 1896.

In the late 1930s, a group of pro-Nazi German-Americans affiliated with the German American Bund purchased land on the Milwaukee River in the Town of Grafton. They ran a private camp called Camp Hindenburg, and hosted a speech by Nazi-supporter Fritz Julius Kuhn in 1939. The camp closed with the outbreak of World War II in 1941. George Froboese, a prominent member of the camp, committed suicide in 1942 while being escorted to New York to answer a Federal subpoena. Paul Knauer, another member of the camp, was stripped of his U.S. citizenship for having falsely taken the oath of allegiance and was deported back to Germany after the war.

In 1940, the pro-American, anti-Bund Wisconsin Federation of German-American Societies opened Camp Carl Schurz in the Town of Grafton to compete with the Nazi-sympathizers.

Grafton experienced significant population growth during the suburbanization that followed World War II, and the village annexed more farm land from the town of Grafton for residential subdivisions and commercial developments. The construction of Interstate 43 in the mid-1960s connected Grafton to other communities, such as Milwaukee and Sheboygan.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, of it is land and of it (7.47%) is water.

The Village of Grafton is mostly located in what was formerly the town&#x27;s western half. The town is also bordered by the City of Port Washington, Town of Port Washington, and Town of Saukville to the north; the City of Mequon to the south; the City of Cedarburg and the City of Cedarburg to the west; and Lake Michigan to the east. The unincorporated communities of Lakefield and Ulao are also located in the town.

The town is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan, and the coastline is characterized by clay bluffs ranging from in height with deep ravines where streams flow into the lake. Clay bluffs are a geological formation are characteristic of the Lake Michigan shoreline, and are found in few other areas of the world. Much of the coast has mixed gravel and sand beaches. The Kevich Light, a privately owned lighthouse on the lake, is located in the town.

The town is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The soil is clayey glacial till with a thin layer of loess on the surface. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources considers the eastern part of the town along the lake to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape, while the western part of the town is in the Southeast Glacial Plains ecological landscape.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Grafton area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also white cedars growing along the Milwaukee River, which flows through Grafton. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture. The Bratt Woods nature preserve and the Kurtz Woods State Natural Area, which are both maintained by the Ozaukee Washington Land Trust, have old growth endemic trees and retain the character of the pre-settlement beech-maple forests.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Grafton. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, and red foxes can be seen in the town. Many birds, including great blue herons and wild turkeys are found in the town, and waterfowl including green herons and American bitterns breed in the town&#x27;s wetlands. The Bratt Woods nature preserve is a habitat for the American gromwell, a State-designated special concern plant species.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

<text>Grafton is a village in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. Located about north of Milwaukee and in close proximity to Interstate 43, it is a suburban community in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The village incorporated in 1896, and at the time of the 2020 census the population was 12,094.

Like many of Ozaukee County&#x27;s cities and villages, the Village of Grafton has rural roots and began as a mill town. The German and Irish immigrants who settled in Grafton in the 1840s utilized the Milwaukee River as a source of hydropower for gristmills and woolen mills. Manufacturing grew and prospered in the village in the 20th century, including the Paramount Records studio and plant, which was in Grafton from 1929 to 1935. Paramount was one of the first and largest producers of blues and jazz records marketed to African-American consumers. Paramount&#x27;s role in Grafton&#x27;s history and Blues music history earned the village a spot on the historic Mississippi Blues Trail.

Grafton changed significantly during the period of post-World War II suburbanization. Even though the last woolen mill closed in 1980, the village experienced rapid population growth and the development of new commercial properties and housing subdivisions. The construction of Interstate 43 in the mid-1960s eased travel to neighboring communities. In the 21st century, Grafton is home to many big-box stores as well as an Aurora hospital.

==History==
The first Europeans to visit the area were the Jesuit missionaries Claude-Jean Allouez and Claude Bablon, who visited a Native American village on the Milwaukee River near the future site of Grafton around 1670.

Timothy Wooden, who arrived in 1839 from the eastern United States, is considered Grafton&#x27;s first permanent white resident. The majority of the early residents were immigrants from Germany and Ireland. In the early 1840s, the village was called Hamburg, because Jacob Eichler, one of the village founders, was an immigrant from Hamburg, Germany. A post office for &quot;Hamburgh&quot; was established in 1844.

The Wisconsin territorial legislature officially created the town of Grafton in 1846. The village of Grafton was officially incorporated from some of the town&#x27;s land on March 30, 1896.

The village&#x27;s early settlers utilized the Milwaukee River as a source of power for milling. In 1846, a group farmers built the Grafton Flour Mill. In 1880, the owner of Cedarburg&#x27;s woolen mill opened a mill in Grafton to make worsted yarn. At its height, Grafton&#x27;s woolen mill employed 100 people.

Grafton was also the site of the Milwaukee Falls Lime Company, which quarried limestone in the village and operated lime kilns to manufacture slaked lime. The kilns are preserved in Grafton&#x27;s Lime Kiln Park, on the west bank of the Milwaukee River. Lime production played an important part in the village economy until the 1920s.

In the early 20th century, the Wisconsin Chair Company of Port Washington operated a furniture factory in the village, which manufactured phonographs among other things. The company originally manufactured phonographs exclusively for Edison Records, but in 1917 it started its own Paramount Records subsidiary, which became famous for producing some of the first blues and jazz records, called race records because they were by African-American artists and were marketed to African-American consumers. It is estimated that a quarter of all race records released between 1922 and 1932 were on the Paramount label. Music was originally recorded in Chicago, until the Paramount headquarters and studio moved to the Grafton factory in 1929. Artists including Charley Patton, Son House, Willie Brown, and Louise Johnson journeyed from the American South to record in Grafton. The studio stopped recording music in 1932, due to the Great Depression, and Paramount Records closed in 1935 and the building was razed in 1938. Today, Grafton is one of the few sites on the Mississippi Blues Trail outside of the American South.

In the late 1930s, a group of pro-Nazi German-Americans affiliated with the German American Bund purchased land on the Milwaukee River in the Town of Grafton. They ran a private camp called Camp Hindenburg and came into the village to march with Nazi flags and meet at the Grafton Hotel. The group hosted a speech by Nazi-supporter Fritz Julius Kuhn in 1939. The camp closed during World War II in 1941.

Grafton experienced significant population growth during the suburbanization that followed World War II. Between 1950 and 1980, the village population increased five-times over, from 1,489 to 8,381. As the population grew, the village annexed more farm land from the town of Grafton for residential subdivisions and commercial developments. The construction of Interstate 43 in the mid-1960s connected Grafton to other communities, such as Milwaukee and Sheboygan.

In 1988 and 1989, the village was the center of a controversy that gained national media attention. In 1987, the Grafton Organization for Library Donations began a campaign to construct a new library facility and announced that the individual or group that gave the largest donation would have right to choose the building&#x27;s name. Local industrialists Benjamin and Theodore Grob gave $250,000 to the campaign on that condition that the facility be named the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; Memorial Public Library in honor of thirty-four U.S. citizens killed by Israel during the Six-Day War. Milwaukee-based Jewish organizations protested that the name was antisemitic; although Israel claimed that the attack on the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; was an accident—a claim confirmed by a U.S. congressional inquiry—some right-wing groups such as the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; Veterans Association and the Liberty Lobby used the incident as a political lightning rod to promote anti-Zionist and antisemitic positions. However, the Grob brothers claimed that their intentions were patriotic and they wanted to honor victims who had received little official recognition. Media outlets including the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported on the story and made public the Grob brothers&#x27; ties to right-wing groups, including the Liberty Lobby, and an investigation by the &quot;Milwaukee Journal&quot; also found that Benjamin Grob had given money to the Ku Klux Klan, including a $500 contribution to David Duke&#x27;s 1988 presidential campaign. In spite of the controversy and protests in the community, village president James Grant dismissed the allegations and proceeded to dedicate the library in June 1989, marking the twenty-second anniversary of the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident. Sixty survivors of the &quot;Liberty&quot; attended the dedication ceremony.

In December 2020 a pharmacist at a local hospital was arrested for allegedly tampering with vials of COVID-19 vaccine.

==Geography==

Grafton is located at (43.317904, −87.954113). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The village is bordered by the City of Cedarburg and the Town of Cedarburg to the west and by the Town of Grafton to the north, east, and south.

The village is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The soil in area is a mixture of well-draining material, loess, and loam, which all overlie a layer of glacial till. The village contains 40-foot high Silurian dolomite outcrops in Lime Kiln Park, which were used for quarrying in the 19th century and have since been used for geological studies.

The Milwaukee River flows south through downtown Grafton. Early industry utilized the river by constructing three dams for mechanical hydropower: one at the Grafton Flour Mill and Badger Worsted Mill, another at the Wisconsin Chair Company factory, and a third near the Milwaukee Falls Lime Company&#x27;s lime kilns in present-day Lime Kiln Park. The chair factory and lime kiln dams have since been removed.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Grafton area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also white cedars growing along the river. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture. The Bratt Woods, a nature preserve maintained by the Ozaukee Washington Land Trust on the eastern bank of the Milwaukee River, has old growth endemic trees and retains the character of the pre-settlement beech-maple forests.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Grafton. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, and red foxes can be seen within the village limits. Many birds, including great blue herons and wild turkeys are found in and around the village. The Bratt Woods nature preserve is a habitat for the American gromwell, a State-designated special concern plant species.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

==Economy==

As is the case in many of the cities and villages in Ozaukee County, Grafton&#x27;s early economy was primarily agricultural and the first major businesses were hydropowered mills on the Milwaukee River. One of the first was the Grafton Flour Mill, which opened in 1846. The village also had sawmills and a chair-and-bedstead factory. In 1880, the owner of Cedarburg&#x27;s woolen mill opened a mill in Grafton to make worsted yarn. At its height, Grafton&#x27;s woolen mill employed 100 people and remained in operation until 1980.

In the early 20th century, the Wisconsin Chair Company of Port Washington operated a chair factory in the village. At the time, the company was the largest business in Ozaukee County, employing one-sixth of all workers. Among other the wooden furniture, the company manufactured phonographs for Edison Records. In 1917, the company decided to start its own subsidiary record label: Paramount Records. In the 1920s, Paramount produced records for African-American consumers, and from 1929 to 1935, Paramount recorded and manufactured records in-house at the Grafton chair factory before closing during the Great Depression.

In the 21st century, Grafton&#x27;s largest employers are in retail, health care, and manufacturing. In the early 2000s, a commercial district with big-box stores developed in eastern Grafton. Many of the village&#x27;s largest retailers are located in the eastern Grafton commercial district near the intersection of Interstate 43 and Wisconsin Highway 60. Aurora Medical Center Grafton, which opened in 2010, is the largest employer in the village and is also located in the eastern commercial district. Many residents commute for work, reflecting the larger trend of Ozaukee County as a majority-commuter community.

The library is a member of the Monarch Library System, comprising 31 libraries in Ozaukee, Sheboygan, Washington, and Dodge counties. The library maintains a display dedicated to the USS &quot;Liberty&quot; incident, which includes documents as well as a piece of the ship.

===Religion===

Industry experts estimated that the acquisition and construction of the Grafton hospital cost $250 million. Aurora also operates an urgent care center and walk-in clinic in the village.

The village provides sewage disposal and water supply services.

==Transportation==
Interstate 43 passes through the eastern part of the village with access via Exit 92 and Exit 93. Wisconsin Highway 60 also passes through the downtown area.

Grafton has limited public transit compared with larger cities. Ozaukee County and the Milwaukee County Transit System run the Route 143 commuter bus, also known as the &quot;Ozaukee County Express,&quot; to Milwaukee via Interstate 43. The bus makes two stops at park-and-ride lots in the village off of Exit 92: one at the Grafton Commons shopping center and the other in the Target parking lot. The bus operates Monday through Friday with limited hours corresponding to peak commute times. Ozaukee County Transit Services&#x27; Shared Ride Taxi is the public transit option for traveling to sites not directly accessible from the interstate. The taxis operate seven days a week and make connections to Washington County Transit and Milwaukee County Routes 12, 49 and 42u.

The Village of Grafton has sidewalks in most areas, as well as the Ozaukee Interurban Trail, which is for pedestrian and bicycle use, and connects the village to the neighboring communities of Cedarburg and Port Washington, and continues north to Sheboygan County and south to Milwaukee County.

The Wisconsin Central Ltd. (Canadian National) railroad operates a freight rail line which passes through the village and the Union Pacific Railroad (formerly the Chicago &amp; Northwestern Railway) has a line which borders the eastern municipal limits in the Town of Grafton. While Grafton has not had passenger rail in many decades, passenger rail is offered by Amtrak in nearby Milwaukee at the Milwaukee Intermodal Station.

==Parks and recreation==
Grafton maintains 17 parks, encompassing over 120 acres of the land. Parks range from as small as the 1-acre Acorn Park to the 27-acre Centennial Park and the 28-acre Lime Kiln Park. The village has picnic shelters, two baseball fields, a municipal golf course, a soccer practice field, a disc golf course, a public pool, and canoe launches on the Milwaukee River. The parks and recreation department offers over thirty recreation programs for residents.

The Ozaukee Interurban Trail runs through the Village of Grafton, following the former route of the Milwaukee Interurban Rail Line. The southern end of the trail is at Bradley Road in Brown Deer which connects to the Oak Leaf Trail (), and its northern end is at DeMaster Road in the Village of Oostburg Sheboygan County (). The trail connects the community to neighboring Cedarburg and Port Washington.

There are also two commercial golf courses in the Town of Grafton north of the village.

<text>Port Washington is a town in Ozaukee County in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. It surrounds the northern and western side of the city of Port Washington. As of the 2020 census, the town population was 1,538. The unincorporated communities of Druecker and Knellsville are also located in the town.

==History==
The area that became Port Washington was originally inhabited by the Menominee, Potawatomi, and Sauk Native Americans. The 1830s saw the forced removal of Wisconsin&#x27;s Native American population, followed by land speculation by merchants and investors. One of these land speculators was General Wooster Harrison, who purchased the land that would become the Town of Port Washington in 1835. Harrison&#x27;s wife, Rhoda, died in 1837 and was the first white settler to be buried in the town. The settlement was abandoned that same year.

In 1843, Harrison returned with a party of settlers. The Town of Port Washington was formed in January 1846 and until 1847 included the surrounding areas of what is currently Fredonia, Saukville, and Belgium. At the time, the land was part of Washington County, and in the late 1840s, Port Washington was a candidate for the county seat. However, the community was far from the county&#x27;s other early settlements, including Mequon, Grafton and Germantown. In 1850, the Wisconsin legislature voted to bisected Washington County into northern and southern counties, with Port Washington and Cedarburg as the county seats, respectively. County residents failed to ratify the bill, and in 1853 the legislature instead bisected the county into eastern and western sections, creating Ozaukee County. Port Washington became the seat of the new county, and the Washington County seat moved to West Bend. The bisection was controversial. When Washington County officials from West Bend arrived in Port Washington to correct relevant county records, they were run out of town, and Ozaukee County officials refused to hand over the records for several months.

The town population reached 2,500 in 1853 and continued to increase, with an influx of immigrants from Germany and Luxembourg between 1853 and 1865.

In the 1860s, William Knell developed the Knellsville community in the northern part of the town as a stagecoach stop on the Green Bay Road. In the 1870s, dairy farming became increasingly popular among Port Washington&#x27;s farmers, and the Pauly Cheese Factory opened in Knellsville in 1878. In the 20th century, Pauly&#x27;s Cheese became a nationally distributed brand. Knellsville grew to serve the town&#x27;s farmers with a feed mill, a cannery, and a foundry.

The City of Port Washington incorporated out of some of the town&#x27;s land in 1882.

While dairy farming dominated the local economy in the 20th century, accounting for 80% percent of agriculture in the early 1940s, the Town of Port Washington was also one of several Ozaukee County communities to have prosperous fur farms in the 20th century. The 10-acre Johannes Mink Ranch north of Knellsville opened in 1926, and annually produced 6,000 mink pelts at its height.

Knellsville declined in the mid-20th century for several reasons. The Knellsville Canning Co. closed in 1955, and the Johannes Mink Ranch sold its last pelts in 1969. Additionally, as the City of Port Washington grew and suburbanized, annexing more land from the town, demand for access to the Interstate Highway System grew. Knellsville was close to the city outskirts, and in the mid-1960s, the southern part of Knellsville was demolished to construct Interstate 43&#x27;s Exit 100.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and (11.63%) is water. The City of Port Washington is located in what was formerly the southeastern part of the town. The Town of Port Washington is bordered by the Town of Belgium to the north, Lake Michigan to the east, the Town of Grafton to the south, and the Town of Saukville and Village of Saukville to the west. The unincorporated communities of Druecker and Knellsville are located in the town.

The town is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. The coastline is characterized by clay bluffs ranging from in height with deep ravines where streams flow into the lake. Clay bluffs are a geological formation characteristic of the Lake Michigan shoreline and are found in few other areas of the world. Much of the coastline adjacent to the bluffs has mixed gravel and sand beaches. There are valleys lower than the surrounding bluffs in the City of Port Washington&#x27;s historic downtown where Sauk Creek flows into the lake and in the Town of Port Washington where Sucker Creek flows into the lake.

The town is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The soil is clayey glacial till with a thin layer of loess on the surface. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources considers the town to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Port Washington area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also white cedars growing in the lowlands along the streams. Early surveyors also noted swamps in the area containing birch, ash, elm, oak, and sugar bush. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Port Washington. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, and red foxes can be seen in the town. There have been infrequent sightings of black bears in Ozaukee County communities, including a 2010 sighting of a bear in a City of Port Washington residential neighborhood.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

==Demographics==
As of the census of 2000, there were 1,631 people, 636 households, and 447 families residing in the town. The population density was 87.7 people per square mile (33.9/km2). There were 678 housing units at an average density of 36.4 per square mile (14.1/km2). The racial makeup of the town was 97.30% White, 1.10% Black or African American, 0.43% Asian, 0.25% Native American, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 0.31% from other races, and 0.55% from two or more races. 0.61% of the population were Hispanic or Latino of any race.

There were 636 households, out of which 32.4% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 62.6% were married couples living together, 4.6% had a female householder with no husband present, and 29.7% were non-families. 26.6% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.56 and the average family size was 3.11.

In the town, the population was spread out, with 26.3% under the age of 18, 6.1% from 18 to 24, 28.1% from 25 to 44, 23.7% from 45 to 64, and 15.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 40 years. For every 100 females, there were 97.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 93.9 males.

The median income for a household in the town was $56,875, and the median income for a family was $62,765. Males had a median income of $41,742 versus $25,645 for females. The per capita income for the town was $22,781. About 2.3% of families and 3.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.6% of those under age 18 and none of those age 65 or over.

==Law and government==
Port Washington is organized as a town governed by an elected board, comprising a chairman and two supervisors. The current chairman is Mike Didier. The board meets on the first Monday of each month at 7:30 p.m. in the town hall which is located at 3715 Highland Drive in the unincorporated Knellsville community.

As part of Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district, Port Washington is represented by Glenn Grothman (R) in the United States House of Representatives, and by Ron Johnson (R) and Tammy Baldwin (D) in the United States Senate. Duey Stroebel (R) represents Port Washington in the Wisconsin State Senate, and Robert Brooks (R) represents Port Washington in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

==Education==
Port Washington is served by the joint Port Washington-Saukville School District. The district has three elementary schools for kindergarten through fourth grade. Students in the northern and eastern parts of the town attend Lincoln Elementary. Saukville Elementary serves students in the western parts of the Town of Port Washington and the Town and Village of Saukville. Students in the far southern parts of the town attend Dunwiddie Elementary. All students in the district attend Thomas Jefferson Middle School for fifth through eighth grades, and Port Washington High School for ninth through twelfth grades.

The district is governed by a nine-member elected school board, which meets on Mondays at 6 p.m. in the District Office Board Room, 100 W. Monroe Street, Port Washington. The district also has a full-time superintendent: Michael R. Weber.

==Transportation==
Interstate 43 passes through the town with access to Knellsville and the City of Port Washington via Exit 100. A small stretch of Wisconsin Highway 33 passes through the southwestern part of the town between the City of Port Washington and the Village of Saukville.

Port Washington has limited public transit compared with larger cities. Ozaukee County and the Milwaukee County Transit System run the Route 143 commuter bus, also known as the &quot;Ozaukee County Express,&quot; to Milwaukee via Interstate 43. The closest stop is the route&#x27;s northern terminus at the Saukville Walmart parking lot, near Interstate 43 Exit 96. The bus operates Monday through Friday with limited hours corresponding to peak commute times. Ozaukee County Transit Services&#x27; Shared Ride Taxi is the public transit option for traveling to sites not directly accessible from the interstate. The taxis operate seven days a week and make connections to Washington County Transit and Milwaukee County Routes 12, 49 and 42u. Unlike a typical taxi, however, the rider must contact the service ahead of time to schedule their pick-up date and time. The taxi service plans their routes based on the number of riders, pick-up/drop-off time and destination then plans the routes accordingly.

The town does not have sidewalks in many areas, but the Ozaukee Interurban Trail for pedestrian and bicycle use runs north–south through the town and connects Port Washington to the neighboring communities of Grafton in the south and Belgium in the north. The trail continues north to Oostburg in Sheboygan County and south to Brown Deer where it connects with the Oak Leaf Trail. The trail was formerly an interurban passenger rail line that ran from Milwaukee to Sheboygan with a stop in the City of Port Washington, which was the halfway point between the northern and southern terminuses. The train was in operation from 1907 to 1948, when it fell into disuse following World War II. The old rail line was converted into the present recreational trail in the 1990s.

The town does not have passenger rail service, but the Union Pacific Railroad operates freight trains in the community.

<text>Port Washington is the county seat of Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. Located on Lake Michigan&#x27;s western shore east of Interstate 43, the community is a suburb in the Milwaukee metropolitan area north of Milwaukee. The city&#x27;s artificial harbor at the mouth of Sauk Creek was dredged in the 1870s and was a commercial port until the early 2000s. The population was 12,353 at the 2020 census.

When French explorers arrived in the area in the 17th century, they found a Native American village at the mouth of Sauk Creek—the present location of historic downtown Port Washington. The United States Federal Government forcibly expelled the Native Americans in the 1830s, and the first settlers arrived in 1835, calling their settlement &quot;Wisconsin City&quot; before renaming it &quot;Port Washington&quot; in honor of President George Washington. In the late 1840s and early 1850s, the community was a candidate to be the Washington County seat. Disagreements between municipalities and election fraud prevented Washington County from having a permanent seat of government until the Wisconsin State Legislature intervened, creating Ozaukee County out of the eastern third of Washington County and making Port Washington the seat of the new county.

For much of its history, Port Washington has been tied to the Great Lakes. Early settlers used boats to transport goods including lumber, fish, and grains, although the community&#x27;s early years were marred by shipwrecks, which led the U.S. Federal Government to construct Port Washington Harbor in 1871. Commercial fishing prospered in Port Washington until the mid-20th century, and beginning in the 1930s, the Port Washington Generating Station used the harbor to receive large shipments of coal to burn for electricity. The commercial harbor closed in 2004 when the power station switched to natural gas for fuel, but the community maintains an active marina for recreational boaters. In the 21st century, Port Washington celebrates its lacustrine heritage with museums, public fish fries, sport fishing derbies, and sailboat races.

==History==

===Early history and settlement===

The area that became Port Washington was originally inhabited by the Menominee, Potawatomi, and Sauk Native Americans. In 1679, the French explorers Louis Hennepin and René-Robert Cavelier, Sieur de La Salle described stopping at the first landing north of the Milwaukee River to procure provisions at a Potawatomi village at the mouth of a small river, which may have been Sauk Creek, a stream that empties into the present-day Port Washington&#x27;s artificial harbor.

The 1830s saw the forced removal of Wisconsin&#x27;s Native American population, followed by land speculation by merchants and investors. One of these land speculators was General Wooster Harrison, who purchased the land that would become Port Washington in 1835, which he originally named &quot;Wisconsin City.&quot; Harrison&#x27;s wife, Rhoda, died in 1837 and was the first white settler to be buried in the town. The settlement was abandoned that same year.

In 1843, Harrison returned with a party of settlers. The Town of Port Washington was formed in January 1846 and until 1847 included the surrounding areas of Fredonia, Saukville, and Belgium. At the time, the land was part of Washington County, and in the late 1840s, Port Washington was a candidate for the county seat. However, the community was far from the county&#x27;s other early settlements, including Mequon, Grafton and Germantown. In 1850, the Wisconsin legislature voted to bisect Washington County into northern and southern counties, with Port Washington and Cedarburg as the respective county seats. County residents failed to ratify the bill, and in 1853, the legislature instead bisected the county into eastern and western sections, creating Ozaukee County. Port Washington became the seat of the new county, and the Washington County seat moved to West Bend. The bisection was controversial. When Washington County officials from West Bend arrived in Port Washington to correct relevant county records, they were run out of town, and Ozaukee County officials refused to hand over the records for several months.

===19th century growth and industrialization===

The early settlers saw potential in the community&#x27;s lakeside location and built piers to make their city into a port on Lake Michigan. The city exported cord wood, wheat and rye flour, bricks, fish, and hides, among other things. However, Port Washington did not have a natural harbor and its first decades were marred by shipwrecks, including the 1856 &quot;Toledo&quot; disaster, in which between 30 and 80 people died.

In 1843, the first Christian religious services were held by the Methodist Episcopal Church in private homes. The first Catholic Church services were held in a similar manner in 1847. &quot;The Washington Democrat&quot;, the town&#x27;s first newspaper, was started in 1847 by Flavius J. Mills.

The population reached 2,500 in 1853 and continued to increase, with an influx of immigrants from Germany and Luxembourg between 1853 and 1865. When the American Civil War started, some of these immigrants found themselves in opposition to the federal government. The United States Congress implemented the draft in 1862, and Port Washington&#x27;s immigrants, particularly those from Prussia and Luxembourg, were unpleasantly reminded of mandatory conscription in the countries they had left behind. On November 10, 1862, several hundred Port Washington residents marched on the courthouse, attacked the official in charge of implementing the draft, burned draft records, and vandalized the homes of Union supporters. The riot ended when eight detachments of Union troops from Milwaukee were deployed.

The early 1870s saw improvements to the community&#x27;s transportation infrastructure. In 1870, Port Washington became a stop on the Lake Shore Railroad, which was later incorporated into the Chicago and North Western Railway. In response to the numerous shipwrecks in the area, local officials also petitioned the federal government for assistance to dredge and create an artificial harbor. When the project was completed in 1871, the harbor was a channel deep and long in which ships could dock to unload as well as shelter during storms.

The City of Port Washington was incorporated in 1882. In the 1880s and 1890s, a large number of French and Belgian immigrants arrived in Port Washington. Between 1900 and 1910, two relatively large groups of English immigrants also arrived in Port Washington. One group came directly from England and the other group had previously been residents of Canada.

The last years of the 19th century saw Port Washington&#x27;s economy become more industrial. In September 1888, J. M. Bostwick opened the Wisconsin Chair Company in the city. At its height, the company employed 30% of the county&#x27;s population and accounted for roughly half of Port Washington&#x27;s jobs. Between 1890 and 1900, Port Washington&#x27;s population nearly doubled due to the company&#x27;s success. Additionally, the Bolens tractor company built its main factory in the city in 1894, and in 1896, Delos and Herbert Smith brought their commercial fishing business to Port Washington. The Smith Bros. company grew to a fleet of gillnetting fishing tugs, and they sold fish, whitefish caviar, and burbot oil in addition to operating restaurants and a hotel.

On February 19, 1899, the Wisconsin Chair Company&#x27;s factory caught fire. The building was destroyed and the conflagration spread, burning nearly half of Port Washington. The damages were covered by fire insurance, and the company built an even bigger factory on the waterfront with direct rail access.

===20th century industrial decline and suburbanization===

In the early 20th Century, the Wisconsin Chair Company opened additional factories in neighboring communities and bought tracts of forest in Green Bay, Chambers Island, Harbor Springs, Michigan, and the Upper Peninsula of Michigan to supply wood. During the Panic of 1907 when there were currency shortages, the company&#x27;s checks were treated as an informal currency in the community. Among its products, the company manufactured phonographs for Thomas Edison. In an effort to boost sales, the company also started its Paramount Records subsidiary, which was one of the first record labels devoted to African-American music. Paramount operated in neighboring Grafton until it closed in 1935 during the Great Depression. The Wisconsin Chair Company closed in 1954.

In November 1907, Port Washington became a stop on the Milwaukee-Northern interurban passenger line, and a power station on the lakefront provided electricity for the trains. The community was the halfway point between Milwaukee and the line&#x27;s northern terminus in Sheboygan. In the 1920s, The Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company purchased the line and continued to operate it until March 28, 1948, when the Ozaukee County line declined due to increased use of personal automobiles and better roads.

Wisconsin Electric Power Company, now known as We Energies, built the Port Washington power plant in 1931. The project included an expansion of Port Washington&#x27;s harbor and the construction of a large coal dock to accommodate the daily coal shipments the station received.

The mid-20th century saw a decline in commercial fishing on the Great Lakes. Populations of fish including herring, lake trout, lake whitefish, and yellow perch declined due to decades of overfishing, pollution, and the arrival of invasive species, such as the alewife, the parasitic sea lamprey, and the zebra mussel. The Smith Bros. fishing company closed in 1988, and when the Port Washington power station took its coal-fired boilers out of service in 2004 and converted to natural gas, Port Washington&#x27;s harbor closed as a commercial port.

Despite the decline of decades-old industries, Port Washington experienced significant population growth during the suburbanization that followed World War II. Between 1940 and 1970, the population more than doubled, from 4,046 to 8,752, and the City of Port Washington annexed rural land from the surrounding Town of Port Washington and Town of Grafton for residential subdivisions. The construction of Interstate 43 west of Port Washington in the mid-1960s connected the city to neighboring communities and allowed more residents to commute for work.

On August 22, 1964, an F4 tornado touched down in Port Washington, totally destroying twenty houses and causing severe damage to thirty-four others in a newly constructed subdivision. No one died, but thirty people were reported to have been injured. There were approximately $2 million in damages, which would have been over $16 million as of November 2019, if adjusted for inflation.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is bordered by the Town of Port Washington to the north and west, the Town of Grafton to the south, and Lake Michigan to the east.

The city is located on the western shore of Lake Michigan. In northern and southern parts of the city, the coastline is characterized by clay bluffs ranging from to in height with deep ravines where streams flow into the lake. Clay bluffs are a geological formation characteristic of the Lake Michigan shoreline, and are found in few other areas of the world. Much of the coastline adjacent to the bluffs has mixed gravel and sand beaches. Port Washington&#x27;s historic downtown in the central part of the city is in the Sauk Creek valley, at a lower elevation than the rest of the city. The valley is a break in the bluffs, providing easy access to the lakeshore, which attracted early settlers to the area. Port Washington&#x27;s artificial harbor, dredged in 1871 with subsequently constructed breakwaters, is located at the mouth of Sauk Creek, adjacent to downtown.

The city is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The soil is clayey glacial till with a thin layer of loess on the surface. The Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources considers the city to be in the Central Lake Michigan Coastal ecological landscape.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Grafton. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, and red foxes can be seen in the city. There have been infrequent sightings of black bears in Ozaukee County communities, including a 2010 sighting of a bear in a Port Washington residential neighborhood.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

==Economy==

Port Washington&#x27;s early economy was heavily based on harvesting and shipping raw materials from natural resources, including lumber, fish, fur, wheat and rye, and beginning in the 1870s, dairy farming played an increasingly important role in the Town of Port Washington&#x27;s economy with creameries and cheese factories in rural hamlets like Knellsville. By the mid-20th century, dairy farming accounted for 80% of agriculture in the Port Washington area.

In the 1880s and 1890s, Port Washington became increasingly industrial, with the Wisconsin Chair Company being the largest employer. In the 20th century, other manufacturers in the community included Allen Edmonds, Bolens Corporation, Koering Co., Simplicity Manufacturing Company, and Trak International. While Allen Edmonds continues to manufacture high-end shoes in the city, many of the other manufacturers closed or were purchased by larger companies between the 1970s and 2000s. In 2001, MTD Products acquired the Bolens Corporation. In 2004, Briggs &amp; Stratton purchased Simplicity Manufacturing and closed the Port Washington plant in October 2008. As of 2015, manufacturing accounted for approximately 25% of Port Washington&#x27;s jobs, a significant decrease from the early 20th century when the Wisconsin Chair Company alone accounted for 50% of the city&#x27;s jobs.

In the early 21st century, public administration plays a significant role in Port Washington&#x27;s economy, accounting for approximately 20% of jobs. Port Washington is the Ozaukee County seat, and the county government is the largest employer in the city. The Port Washington city administration is also a major employer.

==Culture==

===Events===

Port Washington hosts many annual events tied to the community&#x27;s maritime heritage. Each year on January 1, the city is the site of a polar bear plunge in which over 100 people jump into Lake Michigan. Fish Day, billed as the &quot;world&#x27;s largest one-day outdoor fish fry,&quot; has been held annually since 1964 on the third Saturday in July. Hosted by several area philanthropic organizations, the event is a charity fundraiser. In the summer, Port Washington hosts a Festival of the Arts, as well as several yacht races and sport fishing competitions, one of which is part of the festival hosted by the area Lions Club.

The city also hosts public celebrations for Independence Day, Labor Day, Halloween, and Christmas.

===Museums===

*Judge Eghart House: Built in 1872, the Judge Eghart House museum is furnished with Victorian era artifacts to provide a snapshot of what life was like in late 19th century Port Washington.

*Port Washington Light: Port Washington&#x27;s light station was constructed in 1860 to replace and earlier structure and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The government of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg paid to restore the lighthouse in 2000, because of the cultural ties between northern Ozaukee County and Luxembourg. The building is a museum of 19th-century lighthouse keeping, and the Port Washington Historical Society runs tours on summer weekends.

===Religion===

The Port Washington area has three Lutheran congregations: Christ the King Lutheran Church, which is affiliated with the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America; St. John&#x27;s Lutheran Church, which is affiliated with the Missouri Synod; and St. Matthew Evangelical Lutheran Church, which is affiliated with the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. In addition to Christ the King Lutheran Church, other mainline Protestant congregations include the First Congregational Church of Port Washington, Grand Avenue United Methodist Church, and St. Simon the Fisherman Episcopal Church. Faith Baptist Church is a denominational Protestant church in the community in the Continental Baptist tradition.

St. John XXIII Catholic Parish formed in 2016 from the merger of Port Washington&#x27;s two historic Catholic churches—St. Mary&#x27;s Church and St. Peter of Alcantara Church—with Immaculate Conception Catholic Church in neighboring Saukville. While the parish is one financial entity, the three church buildings remain in use, and the parish operates a parochial school for students from kindergarten through eighth grade.

There are two evangelical churches in the area: the Evangelical Free Church of America-affiliated Friedens Church and Portview Church. Open Door Bible Church is a Christian fundamentalist congregation in the community affiliated with IFCA International.

Port Washington also has a Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and a Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses Kingdom Hall.

===W. J. Niederkorn Library===

The Port Washington Woman’s Club established the city&#x27;s first public library in 1899, which got its own building in 1961, when area resident W. J. Niederkorn paid to construct it on Grand Avenue. It provides books, magazines, computers, printers, study rooms, databases, audiobooks, e-books, and language-learning software. It is a member of the Monarch Library System, comprising thirty-one libraries in Ozaukee, Sheboygan, Washington, and Dodge counties.

==Law and government==

As part of Wisconsin&#x27;s 6th congressional district, Port Washington is represented by Glenn Grothman (R) in the United States House of Representatives, and by Ron Johnson (R) and Tammy Baldwin (D) in the United States Senate. Duey Stroebel (R) represents Port Washington in the Wisconsin State Senate, and Robert Brooks (R) represents Port Washington in the Wisconsin State Assembly.

===Mayoral Election Results===




===Fire department===

The Port Washington Fire Department formed in 1852. The department operates one fire station on Washington Street and had fifty-nine personnel as of December 31, 2018. Mark Mitchell serves as fire chief. The department has four divisions: fire, emergency medical services, dive team, and rescue task force. The rescue task force was formed in 2016 as a collaboration between law enforcement and paramedics to prepare for a mass-casualty active shooter situation. It was the first such task force in Ozaukee County.

The department operates three ambulances, four fire engines, a water tanker, a Pierce heavy rescue truck, a Pierce ladder truck, a dive rescue boat, and a fireboat.

===Police department===

The Port Washington Police Department was established in 1882 when the city incorporated. The police station is located on Wisconsin Street in Downtown Port Washington. The department employs twenty sworn officers, including police chief Kevin Hingiss who has served with the department since 1984 and was appointed chief in 2012. Additionally, the department has a civilian support staff of three full-time records management employees, one municipal court clerk, one administrative assistant, one parking enforcement officer and one custodian.

==Education==

Port Washington is served by the joint Port Washington-Saukville School District. The district has three elementary schools for kindergarten through fourth grade. Students in northern and eastern Port Washington attend Lincoln Elementary, while students southern and western neighborhoods attend Dunwiddie Elementary. Saukville Elementary serves students in the western parts of the Town of Port Washington and the Town and Village of Saukville. All students in the district attend Thomas Jefferson Middle School for fifth through eighth grades, and Port Washington High School for ninth through twelfth grades.

The district is governed by a nine-member elected school board, which meets on Mondays at 6 p.m. in the District Office Board Room, 100 W. Monroe Street, Port Washington. The district also has a full-time superintendent: Michael R. Weber.

Additionally, St. John XXIII Catholic Parish (of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Milwaukee) operates a parochial school in the city for students from kindergarten through eighth grade.

==Transportation==

Interstate 43 passes around Port Washington to the city&#x27;s west and north with access via Exit 100. Wisconsin Highway 32 passes north to south through the city while Wisconsin Highway 33 travels from the west before it terminates downtown. Wisconsin Highway 57 runs several miles west of Port Washington with a junction with Interstate 43 in the Village of Saukville.

Port Washington Harbor was constructed by the U.S. Federal Government in the early 1870s as a commercial port. Because Port Washington does not have a natural harbor, the government must dredge the harbor every few decades to prevent the twelve-foot-deep channels from filling with sediment. The Port Washington Generating Station on the southern shore received daily shipments of coal through the harbor until 2004, when it became a natural gas power plant. When the coal shipments stopped, the commercial port closed, but the community continues to operate a marina for recreational boaters from April 1 through November 1.

Port Washington has limited public transit compared with larger cities. Ozaukee County and the Milwaukee County Transit System run the Route 143 commuter bus, also known as the &quot;Ozaukee County Express,&quot; to Milwaukee via Interstate 43. The closest stop is the route&#x27;s northern terminus at the Saukville Walmart parking lot, near Interstate 43 Exit 96. The bus operates Monday through Friday with limited hours corresponding to peak commute times. Ozaukee County Transit Services&#x27; Shared Ride Taxi is the public transit option for traveling to sites not directly accessible from the interstate. The taxis operate seven days a week and make connections to Washington County Transit and Milwaukee County Routes 12, 49 and 42u. Unlike a typical taxi, however, the rider must contact the service ahead of time to schedule their pick-up date and time. The taxi service plans their routes based on the number of riders, pick-up/drop-off time and destination then plans the routes accordingly.

The City of Port Washington has sidewalks in most areas for pedestrian traffic. Additionally, the Ozaukee Interurban Trail for pedestrian and bicycle use runs north-south through the city and connects Port Washington to the neighboring communities of Grafton in the south and Belgium in the north. The trail continues north to Oostburg in Sheboygan County and south to Brown Deer where it connects with the Oak Leaf Trail. The trail was formerly an interurban passenger rail line that ran from Milwaukee to Sheboygan with a stop in Port Washington, which was the halfway point between the northern and southern terminuses. The train was in operation from 1907 to 1948, when it fell into disuse following World War II. The old rail line was converted into the present recreational trail in the 1990s.

The city does not have passenger rail service, but the Union Pacific Railroad operates freight trains in the community.

==Parks and recreation==
The City of Port Washington maintains twenty-nine public parks with amenities including picnic shelters, baseball and softball fields, tennis courts, nature preserves, and a public pool. The parks and recreation department offers recreation programs for residents and facilitates men&#x27;s basketball and softball leagues as well as women&#x27;s volleyball and fastpitch leagues. The City also has Possibility Playground, an accessible playground designed to be used by children with special needs. 

The Port Washington marina is open for recreational boaters from April through November. Fishers can also use the breakwaters to catch lake trout and Chinook salmon. Each summer the Port Washington Yacht Club hosts a double-handed (two-person crew) sailboat race in late June and the across-the-lake &quot;Clipper Club&quot; sailboat race on the second Friday in August. The Great Lakes Sport Fishermen—Ozaukee Chapter hosts the Great Lakes Sport Fishing Derby in Port Washington from July 1 through July 3, and the local chapter of the Lions Club hosts a fishing contest on the last weekend in July.

The Ozaukee Interurban Trail runs through the City of Port Washington, following the former route of the Milwaukee Interurban Rail Line. The southern end of the trail is at Bradley Road in Brown Deer which connects to the Oak Leaf Trail (), and its northern end is at DeMaster Road in the Village of Oostburg Sheboygan County (). The trail connects the community to neighboring Grafton and Belgium.

The Wisconsin Shipwreck Coast National Marine Sanctuary, established in 2021 and the site of a large number of historically significant shipwrecks, lies in the waters of Lake Michigan off Port Washington.

==In popular culture==

The television sitcom &quot;Step by Step&quot; was set in a fictionalized version of Port Washington. The show was filmed at Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, California, and the establishing shots of the main characters&#x27; home were actually of a house in South Pasadena, California, not Port Washington.

<doc id="260604" wikidata="Q7427266" url="?curid=260604" title="Saukville (town), Wisconsin">
<text>Saukville is a town in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. The Village of Saukville is located in the town&#x27;s southeast quadrant. The population was 1,755 at the 2000 census.

Menominee and Sauk Native Americans lived in the area until the 1830s when the U.S. Federal Government forced them to leave Wisconsin. The first white settlers in the mid-1840s, and the Town of Saukville was organized in 1848. The early settlers were farmers, and dairy farming became the primary economic activity by the early 1900s. The Village of Saukville incorporated from some of the town&#x27;s land in 1915, and while the village has become increasingly industrial, agriculture still plays a major role in the Town of Saukville&#x27;s economy.

The town has thousands of acres of undeveloped, biodiverse bogs, coniferous swamps, and primeval beech-maple forests. The largest of the community&#x27;s natural areas is the 2,200-acre Cedarburg Bog State Natural Area. The town&#x27;s bogs are a habitat for many endangered species, birds, and carnivorous plants. Among other landforms, the Cedarburg Bog contains a string bog—a geographic feature that seldom occurs as far south as Wisconsin—which contains many plant species rarely seen outside remote parts of Canada.

==History==

Saukville was the site of a Native American village at the crossroads of two trails, one of which became the north-south Green Bay Road and the other the east-west Dekora Road. Also located on the banks of the Milwaukee River, the village&#x27;s inhabitants were probably Menominee and Sauk people. The Native Americans were forced to leave Wisconsin in the 1830s, and white settlers arrived in the area around 1845 and began to build along Green Bay Road.

Saukville was part of the town of Port Washington until 1848 when the Town of Saukville was established. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Saukville was a rural community with many dairy farmers. In 1871, a rail line was constructed through Saukville. It would eventually become part of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway.

The Village of Saukville incorporated out of some of the Town of Saukville&#x27;s land in 1915. In 1973, the Village of Newburg incorporated from some of the Town of Saukville&#x27;s land as well as land from the neighboring Town of Trenton in Washington County.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of 33.3 square miles (86.4 km2), of which, 32.7 square miles (84.6 km2) of it is land and 0.7 square miles (1.8 km2) of it (2.04%) is water. The Village of Saukville is located in what was formerly the town&#x27;s southeast quadrant. The town borders Waubeka, the Town of Fredonia, and the Village of Fredonia to the north; the Town of Port Washington to the east; the Town of Grafton and the Cedarburg (town), Wisconsin to the south; and the Town of Trenton and the Village of Newburg to the west.

The town is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. The town has many glacial landforms, including kames, kettles, and moraines. Much of the community is located on the Racine Dolomite formation that stretches through eastern Wisconsin and Illinois. The formation contains Silurian marine fossils, and while much of the rock lies between 25 and 50 feet below the surface, the fossils of a prehistoric reef can be seen in some old quarries in the northern part of the Village of Saukville as well as in the 50-foot-high bluff along the Milwaukee River at Riveredge Nature Center.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Saukville area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also white cedars growing along the Milwaukee River and several thousand acres of coniferous swamp in Saukville&#x27;s southwest quadrant. Much of the original forest—with the exception of the coniferous swamps—was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture. The Cedarburg Beech Woods State Natural Area in the western part of the town has old growth endemic trees with minimal damage from logging and retains the character of the pre-settlement beech-maple forests.

The town has many nature preserves and other undisturbed natural areas, the largest of which is the Cedarburg Bog State Natural Area, a 2,200-acre National Natural Landmark with high biodiversity, which is home to many endangered plant and animal species. The largest and best preserved bog in eastern Wisconsin, it contains two lakes, extensive white cedar and tamarack coniferous swamps, and the southernmost string bog on Earth. The bog is a habitat for several carnivorous plant species, including bladderworts, pitcher plants, and round-leafed sundews. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service also considers the Cedarburg Bog to be an important habitat for the endangered Hine&#x27;s emerald dragonfly.

Other bogs in the town include black spruce swamps, which rarely occur at such southerly latitudes. Other bog plants that occur in Saukville include leatherleaf, snakemouth orchids, grass-pink orchids, bog-rosemary, winterberry, blueberry, and cranberry. The town is also a habitat for the threatened forked aster plant and the American gromwell, which is a state-designated special concern plant species.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Saukville. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, North American river otters and red foxes can be seen in the town. Many birds, including great blue herons and wild turkeys are found in the town with the many swamps and bogs providing a habit birds such as the osprey.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

==Nature preserves, parks and recreation==

===State natural areas===

*Cedarburg Beech Woods: The Cedarburg Beech Woods is a 74-acre nature preserve owned by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, containing tamarack swamps and old-growth beech-maple forests dating to the time before white settlers cleared much of Ozaukee County&#x27;s forests for agriculture. 
*Cedarburg Bog: The Cedarburg Bog State Natural Area is a 2,200-acre National Natural Landmark with high biodiversity. The area has hiking trails with views of the largest and best preserved bog in eastern Wisconsin and a boardwalk and birdwatching platform on Mud Lake in the center of the preserve.
*Riveredge Creek and Ephemeral Pond: The Riveredge Nature Center—a private, nonprofit education facility—maintains a 61-acre nature preserve rich in plant and insect life near the confluence of Riveredge Creek and the Milwaukee River. The nature center contains glacial landforms typical of the Kettle Moraine region and 50-foot-high Silurian dolomite bluffs along the river.
*Sapa Spruce Bog: The Sapa Spruce Bog is a 24-acre nature preserve owned by the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee. Located in a flooded glacially formed kettle, the bog occurs farther south than other black spruce-tamarack bogs typically do. The Sapa Spruce Bog is more acidic than other bogs in the region, creating a unique ecosystem of flora and fauna—including six species of Sphagnum moss—not typically seen so far south.

===Ozaukee County Parks===

*Ehlers Park: A narrow seven-acre park on the east bank of the Milwaukee River, Ehlers Park has 2,200 feet of river front with canoe launches and fishing spots.
*Hawthorne Hills Park, H. H. Peters Youth Camp, and Ozaukee County Pioneer Village: Located on the Milwaukee River in northeastern Saukville, these three, sandwiched-together county parks offer a wide range of activities. Hawthorne Hills Park features 57 acres of undeveloped forest with hiking trails on the river as well as an 18-hole golf course. The adjacent H. H. Peters Youth Camp is an additional 40 acres with hiking trails liked to Hawthorne Hills and a camp hall with showers and restrooms. Pioneer Village is directly north of the Hawthorne Hills Golf Course and is an open-air museum that preserves twenty-four buildings from the 1840s through the early 1900s, providing a snapshot of village life in early Ozaukee County.
*Tendick Nature Park: The 122-acre Tendick Nature Park has a boardwalk through wetlands, a canoe launch on the Milwaukee River, an archery range, and picnic facilities.

===Ozaukee Washington Land Trust===

*Shannon Preserve: A 34-acre nature preserve with hardwood forests, cattail swamps, and a lake, the Shannon Preserve has hiking trails and opportunities for birdwatching.

Additionally, the Blue Heron Wildlife Sanctuary on the Milwaukee River is a private, nonprofit nature center with 92-acres of land, hiking trails, and wildlife rehabilitation facilities. North American river otters have been spotted from the sanctuary&#x27;s trails.

The Town of Saukville is also home to The Bog, a private, 18-hole golf course located east of the Cedarburg Bog.

<text>Saukville is a village in Ozaukee County, Wisconsin, United States. Located on the Milwaukee River with a district along Interstate 43, the community is a suburb in the Milwaukee metropolitan area. The population was 4,258 at the 2020 census.

Downtown Saukville was the site of a Native American village at the crossroads of two trails before white settlers arrived in the mid-1840s. In its early years, the community was a stagecoach stop on the road from Milwaukee to Green Bay and also grew as a mill and market town serving the dairy farmers of northwestern Ozaukee County. The village incorporated in 1915 and later in the 20th century grew into a suburban community with a manufacturing-based economy. As of 2019, more than 40% of the village&#x27;s jobs were in manufacturing, with the largest employers being a steel mill as well as several foundries and metal fabricators.

The village and the neighboring Town of Saukville are rich in biodiverse bogs and coniferous swamps, the largest of which is the 2,200-acre Cedarburg Bog State Natural Area. The area&#x27;s bogs are a habitat for endangered species, many types of birds, and carnivorous plants. Among other landforms, the Cedarburg Bog contains a string bog—a geographic feature that seldom occurs as far south as Wisconsin—which contains many plant species rarely seen outside remote parts of Canada.

== History ==
Saukville was the site of a Native American village at the crossroads of the Milwaukee River and two trails, one of which became the north–south Green Bay Road and the other the east–west Dekora Road. The area was populated centuries before the first European settlers arrived. In the mid-19th century, Increase A. Lapham identified a group of circular mounds near Saukville and found a stone ax. Lapham did not speculate about the age of the artifact or the mounds. An additional artifact of the early Native American presence in the area is the Ozaukee County Birdstone, discovered by a six-year-old farm boy in 1891. While the exact age of the Ozaukee County Birdstone remains uncertain, many birdstones date from a period ranging from 3000 BCE to 500 BCE.

By the early 1800s, the Native Americans in the Saukville area were probably Menominee and Sauk people, who were forced to leave Wisconsin in the 1830s. White settlers arrived in the area around 1845 and began to build along Green Bay Road.

Saukville was part of the town of Port Washington until 1848 when the town of Saukville was established. In that year, William Payne opened a stagecoach inn for travelers on the route from Milwaukee to Green Bay. The Payne Hotel still stands today and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. In 1848, several residents constructed a dam on the Milwaukee River and later built a saw mill and a grist mill. Throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries, Saukville was a rural community with many dairy farmers.

In 1871, a rail line was constructed in the community. It would eventually become part of the Chicago, Milwaukee &amp; St. Paul Railway.

In 1915, the village of Saukville officially incorporated with a vote of 66 in favor and 40 opposed. At that time, the village had a population of 376 people.

In 1945, sixty German prisoners of war from Camp Fredonia in Little Kohler, Wisconsin were contracted to work at Canned Goods, Inc. in the village to make up for the loss of labor due to local men fighting in World War II.

Saukville experienced significant population growth following World War II. Between 1950 and 1980, the village population increased five-times over, from 699 to 3,494. The construction of Interstate 43 in the mid-1960s connected Saukville to other communities, such as Milwaukee and Sheboygan.

==Geography==
Saukville is located at (43.38137, −87.944578). According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which, of it is land and is water. The village perimeter is bordered by the Town of Saukville to the north and west, the Town of Port Washington to the east and southeast and by the Town of Grafton to the south and southwest.

The village is located in the Southeastern Wisconsin glacial till plains that were created by the Wisconsin glaciation during the most recent ice age. Much of the community is located on the Saukville Reef formation, which is part of the Racine Dolomite that stretches through eastern Wisconsin and Illinois. The formation contains Silurian marine fossils, and while much of the rock lies between 25 and 50 feet below the surface, it&#x27;s exposed at some old quarries in the northern part of the village.

Before white settlers arrived in the area, the Saukville area was an upland forest dominated by American beech and sugar maple trees. There were also white cedars growing along the Milwaukee River, which flows north–south through Saukville. Much of the original forest was cleared to prepare the land for agriculture. The Kurtz Woods State Natural Area in the village, maintained by the Ozaukee Washington Land Trust, has old growth endemic trees and retains the character of the pre-settlement beech-maple forests.

The village is east of the Cedarburg Bog, a 2,200 acre state natural area, which is home to many endangered plant and animal species. Located in the Town of Saukville, the bog contains two lakes, extensive white cedar and tamarack swamps, and the southernmost string bog on Earth. The bog is a habitat for several carnivorous plant species, including bladderworts, pitcher plants, and sundews.

As land development continues to reduce wild areas, wildlife is forced into closer proximity with human communities like Saukville. Large mammals, including white-tailed deer, coyotes, North American river otters and red foxes can be seen in the village. Many birds, including great blue herons and wild turkeys are found in the village.

The region struggles with many invasive species, including the emerald ash borer, common carp, reed canary grass, the common reed, purple loosestrife, garlic mustard, Eurasian buckthorns, and honeysuckles.

<text>Stockholm is a town in Pepin County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 218 at the 2020 census. The Village of Stockholm is located within the town.

==History==
In 1854, this site at the foot of the Mississippi bluffs was the destination of more than 200 emigrants from the impoverished Bjurtjärn socken, in Värmland, Sweden. The area was surveyed and a plat lay out for a community the Swedish immigrant settlers called Stockholm, the same name as the capital of Sweden. Early industries included fishing and clamming. Commercial fish provided thousands of barrels of Lake Pepin fish for the eastern markets. Clamming provided the raw material for button factories. Twenty years of harvesting diminished the supply, signaling the end of this business. The ice industry began as soon as the Burlington Railroad was completed through Stockholm. It was the only place on Lake Pepin where ice was shipped to the large cities.

<text>Ellsworth is a village in and the county seat of Pierce County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 3,348 at the 2020 census. The village is adjacent to the Town of Ellsworth and now incorporates the formerly separate district known as East Ellsworth. The municipality of Ellsworth and its surroundings are slowly becoming incorporated into the Twin Cities Metro Area.

==History==
Settlement in the area that now comprises the village of Ellsworth began with the arrival of several families in 1857. The village was officially platted in 1862, then incorporated in 1887. The village was initially called Perry, in honor of the War of 1812 hero, Oliver Hazard Perry, but was renamed in 1866 in honor of Col. Elmer E. Ellsworth, the first Union officer to die in the Civil War. A close friend of Pres. Abraham Lincoln, Ellsworth died while removing a highly visible Confederate flag from the roof of a hotel overlooking the Potomac River in Alexandria, Virginia. The incident received national attention, and at least one other town, Ellsworth, Michigan, was named in his honor.

Downtown Ellsworth&#x27;s location atop a steep hill is the result of an 1861 dispute between Pierce County&#x27;s two major towns, Prescott and River Falls, over which should be county seat. The compromise reached was to draw lines on a map connecting the corners of the county, northwest to southeast and northeast to southwest. The intersection of these lines at a densely forested site at the top of a ridge determined the placement of the new town. A log building was hastily erected to serve as a courthouse, then replaced by a wood-frame structure about two years later. The current Pierce County Courthouse, built 1905, was designed by the noted St. Paul firm of Buechner &amp; Orth. The structure exhibits characteristics of both the neoclassical and Beaux-Arts styles, topped by a large dome above a five-story hexagonal rotunda.

==Geography==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

Ellsworth is located at (44.73261, -92.480177).

Ellsworth is along U.S. Highways 10 and 63, and Wisconsin Highways 65 and 72.

==East Ellsworth==
The steep grades approaching Ellsworth&#x27;s hilltop location proved an insurmountable challenge to railroad construction. When the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway (&quot;Omaha Road&quot;) surveyed a branch line to the locale in 1885, it bypassed the village and constructed a depot about one mile away at the foot of the grade. The businesses that grew up by the station coalesced into the independent village of East Ellsworth. Although they are now administered as one municipal entity, Ellsworth and East Ellsworth retain separate ZIP codes. The Isabelle River runs through East Ellsworth.

<text>St. Croix Falls is a city in Polk County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 2,208 at the 2020 census. The city is located within the Town of St. Croix Falls along the St. Croix River, from which it takes its name. U.S. Route 8, Wisconsin Highway 35, and Wisconsin Highway 87 are three of the main arterial routes in the city.

==History==
In the 1840s, the land that would become St. Croix Falls was indirectly settled by Nordic and Scandinavian Americans and German Americans. After the increase of logging and the founding of the Cushing Land Company, St. Croix Falls became incorporated in 1887. The logging industry became important in St. Croix Falls, attracting New England immigrants which started a chain reaction of cutting down vast amounts of white pine. They were sent down the St. Croix River and the Mississippi River. From the late 1890s on, the logging industry died down; the last log cut at the Saint Croix log mill was in 1914. This made St. Croix Falls a more agricultural town. 

The Saint Croix Falls Dam was completed in the town in 1907 to generate hydroelectricity for Minneapolis, impounding the river&#x27;s natural falls. St. Croix Falls became a city in 1958.

<text>Plover is a village in Portage County, Wisconsin, United States. A suburb of Stevens Point, it is part of the Stevens Point Micropolitan Statistical Area. The population was 13,519 at the 2020 United States census.

==History==
An 1825 treaty establishes a &quot;Plover Portage of the Ouisconsin&quot; as a boundary point between the Chippewa and Winnebago

The area that later became Plover was selected as the county seat of Portage in 1844. The election for the county seat only noted the general location of an unsettled area around present-day Plover. Until the area was settled, county business was actually conducted in the community of Rushville. The Plover area was platted in 1845, and received a post office at the same time under the name &quot;Plover Portage&quot;. The name of the post office was changed to &quot;Plover&quot; in 1850.

In 1857, State Senator Luther Hanchett of Plover introduced a bill to incorporate the Village of Clayton in the community; he later amended the bill to make the name the Village of Algernon. That bill passed the Wisconsin Legislature, incorporating the Village of Algernon on March 6, 1857. (Algernon was probably named for Algernon B. Crosby, a postmaster in Portage County.) On May 4, 1858, the name of the village was again changed, this time to the Village of Stanton. And in 1864, the name of the village was finally changed to Plover.

In 1868, the county seat was moved to Stevens Point, following an energetic battle in newspapers and the state legislature. The village of Plover was dissolved, and government of the area fell to the Town of Plover.

Plover was again incorporated as a village on March 8, 1912, after area residents&#x27; approval in an election. This incorporation was not long lived, as Plover was again dissolved on October 7, 1931, after another election. An attempt at re-incorporation failed in 1965.

Plover re-incorporated, for the third time, on September 28, 1971. The vote for incorporation was narrow: 311 for and 289 against. The population of the village at that time was 2618. It incorporated about of territory, and increased to about in 1981, after annexation. Annexations continued nearly every year until the present.

The village president is Tom Davies, who was first elected in 2015.

<text>Catawba is a village in Price County, Wisconsin, United States. The population was 110 at the 2010 census. The village is located within the Town of Catawba.

==Geography==
Catawba is located at (45.535969, -90.530445).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , all of it land.

==History==
Before the railroad was built around 1884, the area that would become Catawba was a forested wilderness cut only by rivers and Indian trails. The federal government surveyed that wilderness in 1847 and 1855. In the final years before the railroad, a little pine was logged along the river and some Swedish immigrants settled near where highway 86 crosses the south fork of the Jump River.

The name &quot;Catawba&quot; is said to come from the wine - perhaps from a crew of railroad gandy dancers who overindulged on the stuff, or perhaps from local lumberjacks who partook at a saloon in Kennan.

With the railroad came more lumber camps, more settlers, and a sawmill. The first school was operating by 1892, expanded to two rooms in 1902. By 1902 Peter Hammer&#x27;s Red Birch Lumber Company had a sawmill running. He and his wife Isabelle also operated the Commercial Hotel, which largely served men working in the lumber business. Hammer also operated a company store called the ACA store. Other early businesses included a lath mill, the Bendixon butcher shop, the Hamm&#x27;s Brewing Company saloon and pool hall, Stevens&#x27; barber shop, Swanson&#x27;s soda fountain, and Gruber&#x27;s store and opera house. A Lutheran congregation was organized in 1903 - the cemetery around 1909. The Catholic church was built around 1908. The Catawba State Bank started in 1916.

The town hall was built in 1921 and the village incorporated in 1922. At some point Wisconsin Highway 14 joined the railroad passing through town. It was eventually upgraded to U.S. Route 8, and paved in 1949.

<text>Prentice is a village in Price County, Wisconsin, United States, near where Highway 13 crosses the Jump River. The population was 660 at the 2010 census. The village is located within the Town of Prentice.

==History==
The area that would become Prentice was big woods until 1873, when the Wisconsin Central Railroad built its rail line up through the forest, heading from Stevens Point for Ashland. The railroad built stations at regular intervals and the crossing of the Jump River was the right distance from the previous station at Ogema. The railroad initially named its station at that crossing &quot;Malden&quot;.

In 1881 Alexander Prentice and George Greenman came north from Portage, scouting for a good place to build a lumber mill. They found plenty of timber around Malden station, and chose a mill site just south of where the railroad crossed the river. They were soon joined by workers who began building a sawmill and an 8-foot dam across the Jump. In 1882 they incorporated the Jump River Lumber Company and in September began sawing. Soon they were sawing 50,000 feet of lumber per day, which grew to 100,000 feet. The lumber company added a planing mill and drying shed soon after.

The lumber company considered calling their mill-town &quot;Jump River&quot;, but railroad officials pushed to call it &quot;Prentice&quot;, to honor the founder of the company. In 1882 the lumber company built the Jump River House - a 50-room hotel mainly for its employees which charged $2 per day. The company also built the Jump River Store, which was touted as the &quot;finest in Price County&quot; at the time, with 12 clerks selling staples, clothes, hats, shoes, furniture and stoves. The store also housed a dance hall for the community.

In 1884 a forest fire approaching from the west threatened the little settlement. The situation was so dire that some people buried their valuables and shuttled women and children to safety on the train to Ogema. That same year a village was platted near the depot and the mill, and a school was started - a two-room grade school. By 1887 the school had 50 students.

By 1889 the closest pine timber was running out, so Jump River Lumber built its own logging railroad spur to some prime timber called the Ward Tract about 5 miles southeast of town. The mill ran its own locomotive with 30 cars to haul logs from that tract. By this time the mill employed 450 men.

The deeds in the original town plat carried a restriction that the buyers could not operate businesses in town until 1890, so they would not compete with Jump River Lumber&#x27;s store and hotel. In 1890 that restriction expired, and A.P. Morner opened a general store in town. The first newspaper, &quot;The Prentice Journal&quot;, started in 1891.

In the early 1890s Fayette Shaw opened a tannery on the west side of town. His family ran tanneries in Medford, Perkinstown, Rib Lake, Phillips, and other places. Hemlock bark was then used in the tanning process, and it was cheaper to transport hides to places near hemlock forests, even if remote, than to transport carloads of bark to the hides. With this addition, the population of Prentice swelled to 1,050. The Prentice tannery was considered the second largest of its kind in the U.S. - producing 200,000 hides of sole leather at its peak. It was a good thing it came along because the prime pine timber within reach was running out.

Around 1893 the Minneapolis, St. Paul and Sault Ste. Marie Railroad, heading from Minneapolis to Sault St. Marie, built a line across the south end of Prentice, connecting with the Wisconsin Central.

Prentice incorporated as a village in 1899. At the first meeting of the village board of directors, only one topic was discussed: sidewalks for the village. A volunteer fire department was in place by 1905, with two hose companies and one hook and ladder company.

In 1906 the tannery burned. The United States Leather Company had bought the operation from the Shaws at some point. In February a fire started in the dry loft. The alarm was sounded and the fire department rushed in and saved everything except the dry loft and the hide house. U.S. Leather quickly rebuilt, but four months later on the night before operation was to resume, another fire broke out, destroying more of the complex. U.S. Leather declined to rebuild again and the tannery closed permanently. Some who lost their jobs left, and others turned to farming.

As timber ran out, more and more settlers scratched farms out of the stump-lands left by logging in the surrounding country. Price County had 380 farms in 1890; by 1910 the number had grown to 1352. In 1903 the privately-owned Prentice Creamery began buying milk from nearby farmers and selling butter. In 1915 a new Prentice Co-operative Creamery was formed owned by the farmers.

A fire in 1911 destroyed the post office, Kreuger&#x27;s saloon, Lundberg&#x27;s store, the Odd Fellows block, the Jump River Hotel, and other buildings. In early days some streets were lit in the evening by kerosene lamps. In 1912 the Ziegler brothers tried lighting with an electric plant powered by the Jump River, but it worked for only one night. In 1915 the Feeleys installed two electric generators, which powered lights - at night only, except when they blinked out.

==Geography==
Prentice is located at (45.545499, -90.289413).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the village has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.

<text>Burlington is a city in Racine and Walworth counties in the U.S. state of Wisconsin, with the majority of the city located in Racine County. The population of the city was 11,047 as of the 2020 census.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans in the area, Native American mounds were constructed near the present location of Burlington. For example, around 1830, a small Potawatomi village stood in what is now the Town of Burlington, though it wasn&#x27;t larger than the present-day city.

The earliest certain European presence in what is now Burlington was in the fall of 1799, when a group of French explorers and missionaries led by Francis Morgan de Vereceones made a portage from the Root River to the Fox River, reaching the Fox at approximately Burlington&#x27;s present location.

The first European settlers in Burlington were Moses Smith (the son of a Revolutionary War veteran) and William Whiting. Smith and Whiting had been in the area previously, making a so-called &quot;jackknife claim&quot; to the land (carving their names and the date on trees in the vicinity) on December 15, 1835. The men then left the encampment and returned with Lemuel Smith (Moses&#x27; brother) as well as Benjamin Perce, another member of the group. The four men searched for arable land and built a cabin on the east side of the Fox River (on what is now Wehmhoff-Jucker Park.) Other settlers arrived in the spring and summer of 1836, mostly from New England; they named their settlement Foxville. That year, the residents of Foxville unanimously decided to change their settlement&#x27;s name to &quot;Burlington&quot; after the city Burlington, Vermont; the Foxville name continued to be used, however, until that name was officially changed on July 15, 1839.

Since its establishment, Foxville had been in Michigan Territory. On July 3, 1836, however, an act of Congress organizing the Wisconsin Territory went into effect, and Foxville fell within the borders of Milwaukee County, Wisconsin Territory, which at that time included the present-day county of Racine. The two counties separated on December 7, 1836, and Foxville ended up in Racine County. The first post office in Foxville was created on March 21, 1837, with Moses Smith, one of the four founders of the city, as the first postmaster. In May 1837, a sawmill (the first frame building in the settlement) and a dam on the Fox River were completed.

On January 2, 1838, Rochester township, which included Foxville as well as all of Racine County west of Mount Pleasant, was established. On March 9, 1839, Burlington township (including at the time what is now the Town of Dover) and much of Brighton were separated from Rochester.

Burlington was a major New England settlement. The original founders of Burlington consisted entirely of settlers from New England, and inherited &quot;Yankee&quot; culture, that is, they were descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. They were part of a wave of New England farmers who headed west into what was then the wilds of the Northwest Territory during the early 1800s. Most of them arrived as a result of the completion of the Erie Canal. When they originally arrived in the area, there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. The settlers laid out farms, constructed roads, erected government buildings and established post routes. They brought with them many of their &quot;Yankee&quot; New England values, such as staunch support for abolitionism as well as a passion for education and the subsequent construction of many schools. They were mostly members of the Congregationalist Church, though some were Episcopalian. Due to the second Great Awakening some of them had converted to Methodism before moving to what is now Burlington. Burlington, like much of Wisconsin, would be culturally similar to early New England for most of its early history.

From 1844 to 1850, the town of Voree, just to the west of Burlington, was the headquarters of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite), one of many sects founded during the LDS succession crisis following the death of Latter Day Saint movement founder Joseph Smith. Although James Strang&#x27;s group relocated to Beaver Island, Michigan in 1850, his parents remained in Voree. After Strang was shot by two disgruntled members in 1856, he was taken to Voree where he died. He is buried in a cemetery in Burlington. Strang&#x27;s church still maintains a congregation in Voree to this day, and the local historical society has erected a monument to the Mormon settlement there.

Burlington was incorporated as a village in 1886; in 1900 it became a city.

==Government==

Burlington has a mayor-council form of government, with a city administrator. The mayor is the city&#x27;s chief executive, responsible for seeing that state law and city ordinances are enforced. Mayors are elected to two-year terms; the current mayor is Jon Schultz.

The Common Council is composed of eight aldermen, two in each of Burlington&#x27;s four districts. In every year&#x27;s spring election, one alderman is elected from each district. Aldermen serve two-year terms.

The city administrator is appointed by the Common Council to oversee the routine operations of the city.

, the Burlington Police Department employed 17 full-time officers; Starting 2020, the Fire Department employs EMT/Firefighters to staff the station full-time, and also has over 30 volunteer Firefighter/EMT&#x27;s.

==Education==
The first school classes in Burlington were taught in 1838. One of the first teachers was William P. Lyon, later a Justice of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin. The settlement&#x27;s first schoolhouse was built in 1839, and classes were taught there irregularly for the next 15 years. An act of the Wisconsin Legislature in 1857 incorporated the Burlington Union School District of Racine County. In 1858 and 1859, a schoolhouse was built for the district&#x27;s use. Now called Lincoln School (Burlington, Wisconsin), the building is now used as the headquarters for the Burlington Area School District. Early quarrels about the management and costs of the school led to the creation of two rival school boards, each claiming to be legal; a new board gained control in 1861, and lasting stability came to the system in 1872.

Burlington is now served by the Burlington Area School District. The district has eight schools, six in Burlington. Elementary schools include:

==Media==
=== Newspapers ===
The first newspaper in the Burlington area was the &quot;Voree Herald&quot;, published in Voree in January 1846 by James Strang, the leader of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite). Its primary purpose was to inform his congregation about events in the wider Latter Day Saint movement. The paper was renamed the &quot;Gospel Herald&quot; in September 1847, and continued to be published until 1850, when most of the church relocated to Beaver Island in Lake Michigan.

The first newspaper published in Burlington intended for a general audience was the &quot;Weekly Burlington Gazette&quot;, first published on April 8, 1858. The newspaper was strongly Republican and continued until December 11, 1860, when its owner moved to Houston, Texas.

From 1860 until 1863, no newspaper was published in Burlington. On October 14, 1863, the &quot;Burlington Standard&quot;, another Republican newspaper, was founded. In 1881, the paper became largely nonpartisan, but in April 1886, with a new owner, the paper was renamed the &quot;Standard Democrat&quot; and became strongly pro-Democrat. From 1896 to 1911, the &quot;Standard Democrat&quot; was also published in German under the name &quot;Der Standard Demokrat&quot;.

The &quot;Burlington Democrat&quot;, a newspaper with Democratic leanings, was first published in 1880 as a counter to the Republican &quot;Burlington Standard&quot;. Its name was soon changed to the &quot;Burlington Free Press&quot;, and its leanings changed to Republican at about the same time the &quot;Standard&quot; became the &quot;Standard Democrat&quot;.

The weekly &quot;Burlington Standard Press&quot; is currently published in Burlington; the daily &quot;Racine Journal Times&quot;, &quot;Kenosha News&quot;, and &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; are also available in the area.

=== Radio ===

=== Television ===
Around 1989 Win-TV (now WIN Media, Inc. - ) was created by current owner and President Shad Branen. According to their web site they began as a producer of local news and sports programming televised throughout Southeastern Wisconsin on CNN Headline News. Since then their services have expanded to include an array of multimedia services for their clients.

===Railroads===
The first railroad to pass through Burlington was built in 1855 by the Racine, Janesville and Mississippi Railroad Company. Its construction nearly bankrupted Racine. The line was later reorganized as the Western Union Railroad and eventually incorporated into the Chicago, Milwaukee and St. Paul Railroad Company. (better known as the Milwaukee Road) On the Milwaukee Road, this line was referred to as the &quot;Racine &amp; Southwestern&quot; Division and is often referred to as the &quot;Southwestern&quot; Line.

In 1856, Burlington invested in the Fox River Valley Railroad of Wisconsin, a planned railroad that would have started in Milwaukee, connected to the railroad already in Burlington, and continued on to the Fox River Valley Railroad of Illinois. The roadbed was built, but because of the failure of the company, rails were never laid. The roadbed was later used by the Milwaukee Electric Railway and Light Company.

The railroad currently operating through Burlington was constructed in 1885–1886 by the Wisconsin Central Railroad. The Wisconsin Central was acquired by the Minneapolis St. Paul &amp; Sault Ste. Marie Railway in 1908, and later merged with the Duluth, South Shore and Atlantic Railway in 1961 to create the Soo Line Railroad.

The Milwaukee Road operated its last train west of Burlington in 1982. In 1985 the Soo Line purchased what remained of the Milwaukee Road, and reorganized their existing line through Burlington as a part of a new subsidiary known as Lakes States Transportation Division in 1986. Lakes States did not achieve the cost savings that the Soo Line had envisioned and was sold to the new Wisconsin Central Transportation, which commenced operations on October 11, 1987. The Wisconsin Central Limited was acquired by the Canadian National Railway in 2001. The Canadian National Railway remains the operator of the rail line through Burlington.

The first non-Native American settlers in Rochester were a group of five farming families, who all hailed from the town of Rochester, Vermont after which they gave their new settlement its name.

When they arrived in what is now Rochester there was nothing but dense virgin forest and wild prairie. They laid out post routes, built roads, constructed farms and government buildings all within the first few months of settling in what is now Rochester. Due to the Second Great Awakening many of them had become Baptists or converted to either Presbyterianism or Methodism before coming to what is now Walworth County, Wisconsin.

In 1856 the two companies raced to lay tracks so the other would have the expense of crossing the already established tracks.

The Old Clinton Water Tower built in 1895 is another historical site close to The Crossing.

<text>Janesville is a city in and the county seat of Rock County, Wisconsin, United States. As of the 2020 census, the city had a population of 65,615, making it the tenth-most populous city in Wisconsin. It is a principal municipality of the Janesville–Beloit metropolitan statistical area, which consists of all of Rock County and is included in the greater Madison–Janesville–Beloit combined statistical area.

==History==
The area that became Janesville was the site of a Ho-Chunk village named (Round Rock) up to the time of Euro-American settlement. In the 1825 Treaty of Prairie du Chien, the United States recognized the portion of the present city that lies west of the Rock River as Ho-Chunk territory, while the area east of the river was recognized as Potawatomi land. Following the Indian Removal Act of 1830 and the Black Hawk War of 1832, both nations were forced to surrender this land to the United States.

American settlers John Inman, George Follmer, Joshua Holmes, and William Holmes Jr. built a crude log cabin in the region in 1835. Later that year, one key settler, Henry F. Janes, a native of Virginia who was a self-proclaimed woodsman and early city planner, arrived in what is now Rock County. Janes initially wanted to name the budding village &quot;Blackhawk,&quot; after the famous Sauk leader, Chief Black Hawk, but was turned down by Post Office officials. After some discussion, it was settled that the town would be named after Janes himself and thus, in 1835, Janesville was founded. 
Despite being named after a Virginian, Janesville was founded by old stock Yankee immigrants, descended from the English Puritans who settled New England in the 1600s. The completion of the Erie Canal caused a surge in New Englander immigration to what was then the Northwest Territory. Some of them were from upstate New York, and had parents who had moved to that region from New England shortly after the Revolutionary War. New Englanders, and New England transplants from upstate New York, were the vast majority of Janesville&#x27;s inhabitants during the first several decades of its history. Land surveys encouraged pioneers to settle in the area among the abundance of fertile farmland and woodlands. Many of these early settlers established farms and began cultivating wheat and other grains.

Some of the key settlers hailed from the burned-over district of western New York State, (an area notable for being a part of the Christian revival movement known as the Second Great Awakening). Some of those in that revival movement were also active in the abolitionist and women&#x27;s rights movements. One of the settlers in Janesville was William Tallman, who hailed from Rome, New York. Tallman came to the area in 1850 and bought up large tracts of land in hopes of inspiring his fellow New Yorkers to settle in the fertile Rock County. He established himself as one of the most influential and affluent members of the budding Janesville populace. He was passionate about the call for abolition and became a supporter of the Republican Party. One of the crowning moments in Tallman&#x27;s life was when he convinced the up-and-coming Illinois Republican, Abraham Lincoln, to speak in Janesville in 1859. The Tallman house is now a historical landmark, and best known as &quot;The place where Abraham Lincoln slept.&quot;
As the population grew in the Janesville area, several new industries began cropping up along the Rock River, including flour and lumber mills. The first dam was built in 1844.

Janesville was very active during the Civil War. Local farms sold grains to the Union army, and Rock County was one of the counties in Wisconsin with the highest number of men enlisted. Thomas H. Ruger, of Janesville, served in the war, along with his brothers, Edward, William, and Henry, and he rose to the rank of brigadier general. Ruger later served as military governor of Georgia, and commandant of West Point. He is memorialized at Fort Ruger in Diamond Head, Hawaii.

After the Civil War, Janesville&#x27;s agriculture continued to surge and a greater demand for new farming technology led to the development of several foundries and farm machine manufacturers in the area, including the Janesville Machine Company, and the Rock River Iron Works. With the boom in the farm service sector and establishment of a rail system, Janesville soon began to ship goods to and from prominent eastern cities, including New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. After decades of rigorous grain farming, the soil quality around Janesville began to degrade. Farmers responded to this by planting tobacco, which became one of the most profitable and prolific crops grown in Wisconsin during the late 19th century.

Another development during the mid-19th century was the establishment of a women&#x27;s rights movement in Janesville. The movement was founded in the 1850s and continued after the Civil War. One of the key focuses of the group during the 1870s was the Temperance movement.

In the late 1880s, German immigrants began to arrive in Janesville in large numbers (making up less than 5% of the town before this time). They were the largest non-English-speaking group to settle there. Unlike in some other areas, in Janesville, they experienced virtually no hostility or xenophobia. Janesville&#x27;s founding English-Puritan-descended Yankee population welcomed them with open arms, with many writing back to relatives in Germany enthusiastically. This led to chain migration which increased the German population of the town. Only one German-language newspaper was founded in the town; it was known as &quot;The Janesville Journal&quot;, and began in 1889, printing for only a few years.

In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the Milwaukee Road and Chicago and North Western railroads had freight and passenger rail connections to the city. Passenger rail service continued until 1971.

One of the key developments in Janesville&#x27;s history was the establishment of a General Motors plant in 1919. The plant was initially established to produce Samson tractors, a company acquired by GM co-founder William C. Durant. Durant was encouraged by Joseph Craig, the president of Janesville Machine, to build a plant to produce the Samson tractors in Janesville, to which Durant agreed. In the years following World War I, the demand for tractors plummeted and the plant shifted its focus to the production of automobiles.

One of the most prominent turns of the century figures in Janesville was George Parker, who developed new pen technologies and styles and eventually established the Parker Pen Company. His developments included the &quot;lucky curve&quot; ink feed system and the &quot;trench pen&quot;—a pen commissioned by the U.S. Army for use in World War I. Parker designed and established a headquarters and factory in downtown Janesville. The Parker Pen Company was handed down to George&#x27;s son, Ken, who developed the revolutionary &quot;Parker 51&quot; in the 1940s. A Parker pen was used by Dwight D. Eisenhower to sign Germany&#x27;s Armistice agreement to end World War II in Europe, and subsequently General Douglas MacArthur used his 20-year-old Parker Duofold in the signing of Japan&#x27;s surrender at the end of the War in the Pacific. The Parker Pen Company was one of the top employers in the area for over 70 years. The company was eventually sold off in a leveraged buyout in the 1980s.

Another important figure in Janesville&#x27;s history was John Nolen, who was hired by the city in 1919. Nolen was a city planner who saw the Rock River as a focal point for community and park development. His park planning established Janesville as the &quot;City of Parks.&quot;

Janesville was the site of the first Wisconsin State Fair in 1851, attended by approximately 10,000 people.

A tree that once stood in downtown Courthouse Park was the site of a lynch mob that, on their second attempt, having been rebuffed by an opposing crowd the day before, hanged a convicted murderer in 1859. Janesville had a &quot;Peace Park&quot; with a playground and a peace pole, which when constructed was the tallest in the world and is now the second tallest.

Janesville developed its first flag in 2015 in a design contest held in Janesville&#x27;s schools. The flag represents the community&#x27;s past, present, and future, with 1853 representing the year Janesville was incorporated, four stars symbolizing the city&#x27;s four original wards, a green background standing for the community&#x27;s agricultural industry, and black representing both the rich soil for which Janesville is known, and the smoke that billowed from smokestacks as the community developed a manufacturing economy. The tree in the center is the city&#x27;s logo, representing Janesville&#x27;s slogan, &quot;Wisconsin’s Park Place.&quot;

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water. The city is divided by the Rock River. Elevation is 837 ft, or 255 m.

===Climate===

Like the rest of Wisconsin, the climate is humid continental, but its location is in the transition from warm to warm summers in the eastern and northern part of the state. Nowadays the city is the first choice, i.e. &quot;Dfa&quot; for Köppen classification where the hot season may not be so comfortable at times, although surges in the outskirts without UHI are in the &quot;Dfb&quot; zone. The city is at 5a / 5b in the USDA Plant Hardiness Zone.

===Religion===

There are four Roman Catholic parishes in Janesville, all part of the Diocese of Madison. The oldest is St. Patrick&#x27;s, established in a log chapel in 1844 when there were only six Catholic families in Janesville. A priest arrived in March 1845 and celebrated Mass. St. Patrick&#x27;s present church was built of cream-colored brick in 1863 and is located at 315 Cherry Street. Located on a hill near the center of town, the architecturally prominent Nativity of Mary church (St. Mary&#x27;s) was organized in 1876 by German immigrants who wanted a parish of their own. The present red brick structure was completed in 1902. The remaining two Janesville parishes are St. John Vianney, located on East Racine Street, and St. William on the near west side.

The city is also home to other Christian churches including Lutheran, Methodist, Episcopalian, Baptist, and others. The First Baptist Church of Janesville was organized October 13, 1844, and founded by the Rev. Jeremiah Murphy. The Seventh Day Baptist General Conference has its offices in Janesville; the denomination&#x27;s nearest church is in nearby Milton. All Saints Anglican Catholic Church a part of the continuing Anglican movement, is located in a historic church near downtown that was built by German Lutherans in the 1880s.

There are four cemeteries in Janesville: Oakhill, a municipal cemetery, Mount Olivet, a Roman Catholic cemetery, Dillenbeck Cemetery, and Milton Lawns, a non-demominational private cemetery.

The Gideon Bible organization was founded at the Janesville YMCA in 1899 by Janesville resident John H. Nicholson and a Beloit man after they had shared a Boscobel hotel room.

In 1976, the Lappin-Hayes Block, once the site of the cabin belonging to Henry Janes, was added. The Lovejoy and Merrill-Nowlan Houses, the residences of two Janesville Mayors, including Allen P. Lovejoy, were added in 1980. During the following year, the Janesville Public Library building became part of the list. The Frances Willard Schoolhouse, partially built by Josiah Willard and named after his daughter, Frances, was added in 1977. The South Main Street Historic District joined the list in 1990 and the Jefferson Avenue Historic District was included in 2006. In 2008, the John H. Jones House was listed.

===Hedberg Public Library===
The library began in 1865 as a privately supported reading room for the Young Men&#x27;s Library Association. It became a public library in 1884, and was housed in rented quarters. In 1903, a new building was constructed with $30,000 from Andrew Carnegie and other donors, and $3,000 from the city. In 1968, a new library was built. In 1996, the library was renovated and renamed Hedberg Public Library. The library is part of the Arrowhead Library System.

==Sports==

In fall 2009, Janesville became home to the Janesville Jets, an expansion team in the North American Hockey League, with games played at the Janesville Ice Arena. The Janesville Cubs, a minor league baseball team affiliated with the Chicago Cubs, was based in Janesville from 1941 to 1942 and 1946 to 1953. They were called the Bears in 1946.

==Parks and recreation==
Janesville is known as &quot;Wisconsin&#x27;s Park Place&quot;. Its park system includes 64 improved parks, as well as boat launches, golf courses, and nature trails. This is one of the highest acreages &quot;per capita&quot; in Wisconsin.

Janesville has a public, internationally themed botanical garden, Rotary Gardens, that was created from an abandoned sand pit.

Other major parks include Riverside Park, a recreational park along the Rock River including a golf course and a segment of the Ice Age Trail; Rockport Park, largely undeveloped, including the municipal swimming pool and Peace Park; Monterey Park, including the Big Rock, an early natural landmark signaling a good ford of the Rock River (and the namesake of the county, but not the river), as well as a sports stadium used by the school system; Lustig Park, used for a disc golf course; and Palmer Park, which includes a 9-hole golf course and CAMDEN Playground (an accessible play area, considered the largest accessible/integrated playground in the world and the most accessible/integrated playground). Most of the hiking and biking trails in the city are connected to the Ice Age Trail, which will eventually connect to the west with the Sugar River State Trail, north to Milton and Fort Atkinson and east to the Kettle Moraine State Forest.

Janesville also has a nearly 500-acre greenbelt system to provide areas for surface water runoff and habitat for a diversity of plants and animals.
