<text>Peter Guthrie Tait (28 April 18314 July 1901) was a Scottish mathematical physicist and early pioneer in thermodynamics. He is best known for the mathematical physics textbook &quot;Treatise on Natural Philosophy&quot;, which he co-wrote with Lord Kelvin, and his early investigations into knot theory.

His work on knot theory contributed to the eventual formation of topology as a mathematical discipline. His name is known in graph theory mainly for Tait&#x27;s conjecture on cubic graphs. He is also one of the namesakes of the Tait–Kneser theorem on osculating circles.

== Early life ==
Tait was born in Dalkeith on 28 April 1831 the only son of Mary Ronaldson and John Tait, secretary to the 5th Duke of Buccleuch.

He was educated at Dalkeith Grammar School then Edinburgh Academy, where he began his lifelong friendship with James Clerk Maxwell. He studied mathematics and physics at the University of Edinburgh, and then went to Peterhouse, Cambridge, graduating as senior wrangler and first Smith&#x27;s prizeman in 1852.

As a fellow and lecturer of his college he remained at the University for a further two years, before leaving to take up the professorship of mathematics at Queen&#x27;s College, Belfast; there he made the acquaintance of Thomas Andrews, whom he joined in researches on the density of ozone and the action of the electric discharge on oxygen and other gases. Andrews also introduced him to Sir William Rowan Hamilton and quaternions.

== Middle years ==
In 1860, Tait succeeded his old master, James D. Forbes, as professor of natural philosophy at the University of Edinburgh. He occupied the Chair until shortly before his death. The first scientific paper under Tait&#x27;s name only was published in 1860. His earliest work dealt mainly with mathematical subjects, and especially with quaternions, of which he was the leading exponent after their originator, William Rowan Hamilton. He was the author of two text-books on them - one an &quot;Elementary Treatise on Quaternions&quot; (1867), written with the advice of Hamilton, though not published till after his death, and the other an &quot;Introduction to Quaternions&quot; (1873), in which he was aided by Philip Kelland (1808–1879). Kelland was one of his teachers and colleagues at the University of Edinburgh. Quaternions was also one of the themes of his address as president of the mathematical and physical section of the British Association for the Advancement of Science in 1871. Tait also collaborated with Lord Kelvin on ‘’Treatise on Natural Philosophy’’ in 1867.

Tait also produced original work in mathematical and experimental physics. In 1864, he published a short paper on thermodynamics, and from that time his contributions to that and kindred departments of science became frequent and important. In 1871, he emphasised the significance and future importance of the &quot;principle of the dissipation of energy&quot; (second law of thermodynamics). In 1873 he took thermoelectricity for the subject of his discourse as Rede lecturer at Cambridge, and in the same year he presented the first sketch of his well-known thermoelectric diagram before the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

Two years later, researches on &quot;Charcoal Vacua&quot; with James Dewar led him to see the true dynamical explanation of the Crookes radiometer in the large mean free path of the molecule of the highly rarefied air. From 1879 to 1888, he engaged in difficult experimental investigations. These began with an inquiry into what corrections were required for thermometers operating at great pressure. This was for the benefit of thermometers employed by the &quot;Challenger&quot; expedition for observing deep-sea temperatures, and were extended to include the compressibility of water, glass, and mercury. This work led to the first formulation of the Tait equation, which is widely used to fit liquid density to pressure. Between 1886 and 1892 he published a series of papers on the foundations of the kinetic theory of gases, the fourth of which contained what was, according to Lord Kelvin, the first proof ever given of the Waterston-Maxwell theorem (equipartition theorem) of the average equal partition of energy in a mixture of two gases./ About the same time he carried out investigations into impact and its duration.

Many other inquiries conducted by him might be mentioned, and some idea may be gained of his scientific activity from the fact that a selection only from his papers, published by the Cambridge University Press, fills three large volumes. This mass of work was done in the time he could spare from his professorial teaching in the university. For example, in 1880 he worked on the Four color theorem and proved that it was true if and only if no snarks were planar.

== Later years ==

In addition, he was the author of a number of books and articles. Of the former, the first, published in 1856, was on the dynamics of a particle; and afterwards there followed a number of concise treatises on thermodynamics, heat, light, properties of matter and dynamics, together with an admirably lucid volume of popular lectures on Recent Advances in Physical Science.

With Lord Kelvin, he collaborated in writing the well-known &quot;Treatise on Natural Philosophy&quot;. &quot;Thomson and Tait&quot;, as it is familiarly called (&quot; T and T&#x27; &quot; was the authors&#x27; own formula), was planned soon after Lord Kelvin became acquainted with Tait, on the latter&#x27;s appointment to his professorship in Edinburgh, and it was intended to be an all-comprehensive treatise on physical science, the foundations being laid in kinematics and dynamics, and the structure completed with the properties of matter, heat, light, electricity and magnetism. But the literary partnership ceased in about eighteen years, when only the first portion of the plan had been completed, because each of the members felt he could work to better advantage separately than jointly. The friendship, however, endured for the remaining twenty-three years of Tait&#x27;s life.

Tait collaborated with Balfour Stewart in the &quot;Unseen Universe&quot;, which was followed by &quot;Paradoxical Philosophy&quot;. It was in his 1875 review of &quot;The Unseen Universe&quot;, that William James first put forth his Will to Believe Doctrine. Tait&#x27;s articles include those he wrote for the ninth edition of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; on light, mechanics, quaternions, radiation, and thermodynamics, and the biographical notices of Hamilton and James Clerk Maxwell.
==Death==
He died in Edinburgh on 4 July 1901, aged 70. He is buried in the second terrace down from Princes Street in the burial ground of St John&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Edinburgh.

==Topology==
The Tait conjectures are three conjectures made by Tait in his study of knots. The Tait conjectures involve concepts in knot theory such as alternating knots, chirality, and writhe. All of the Tait conjectures have been solved, the most recent being the Flyping conjecture, proved by Morwen Thistlethwaite and William Menasco in 1991.

== Private life ==
In 1857 Tait married Margaret Archer Porter (1839–1926). She was the sister of (1) William Archer Porter, a lawyer and educationist who served as the Principal of Government Arts College, Kumbakonam and tutor and secretary to the Maharaja of Mysore, (2) James Porter (Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge), and (3) Jane Bailie Porter, who married Alexander Crum Brown, the Scottish organic chemist.

Tait was an enthusiastic golfer and, of his seven children, two, Frederick Guthrie Tait (1870–1900) and John Guthrie Tait (1861–1945) went on to become gifted amateur golf champions. (In 1891, Tait invoked the Magnus effect to explain the influence of spin on the flight of a golf ball.) He was an all-round sportsman and represented Scotland at international level in rugby union. His daughter, Edith, married Rev. Harry Reid, who later became Bishop of Edinburgh. Another son, William, was a civil engineer.

==Recognition==

Tait was a lifelong friend of James Clerk Maxwell, and a portrait of Tait by Harrington Mann is held in the James Clerk Maxwell Foundation museum in Edinburgh.

There are several portraits of Tait by Sir George Reid. One, painted about 1883, is owned by the National Galleries of Scotland, to which it was given by the artist in 1902. Another portrait was unveiled at Peterhouse, Cambridge in October 1902, paid for by the Master and Fellows of Peterhouse, where Tait had been an Honorary Fellow.

One of the chairs in the Department of Physics at the University of Edinburgh is the Tait professorship.

Peter Guthrie Tait Road at the University of Edinburgh King&#x27;s Buildings complex is named in his honour.

He was also given the following honours;
* Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 
* General Secretary of the Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1879 until 1901
* Gunning Victoria Jubilee Prize
* Keith prize (twice)
* Royal Medal from the Royal Society of London, in 1886
* Honorary degrees by the University of Glasgow and the University of Ireland

<doc id="256323" wikidata="Q189233" url="?curid=256323" title="Throne">
<text>A throne is the seat of state of a potentate or dignitary, especially the seat occupied by a sovereign (or viceroy) on state occasions; or the seat occupied by a pope or bishop on ceremonial occasions. &quot;Throne&quot; in an abstract sense can also refer to the monarchy itself, an instance of metonymy, and is also used in many expressions such as &quot;the power behind the throne&quot;. 

A throne is a symbol of divine and secular rule and the establishment of a throne as a defining sign of the claim to power and authority. It can be with a high backrest and feature heraldic animals or other decorations as adornment and as a sign of power and strength. A throne can be placed underneath a canopy or baldachin. The throne can stand on steps or a dais and is thus always elevated. The expression &quot;ascend (mount) the throne&quot; takes its meaning from the steps leading up to the dais or platform, on which the throne is placed, being formerly comprised in the word&#x27;s significance. Coats of arms or insignia can feature on throne or canopy and represent the dynasty. Even in the physical absence of the ruler an empty throne can symbolise the everlasting presence of the monarchical authority.

When used in a political or governmental sense, a throne typically exists in a civilization, nation, tribe, or other politically designated group that is organized or governed under a monarchical system. Throughout much of human history societies have been governed under monarchical systems, in the beginning as autocratic systems and later evolved in most cases as constitutional monarchies within liberal democratic systems, resulting in a wide variety of thrones that have been used by given heads of state. These have ranged from stools in places such as in Africa to ornate chairs and bench-like designs in Europe and Asia, respectively. Often, but not always, a throne is tied to a philosophical or religious ideology held by the nation or people in question, which serves a dual role in unifying the people under the reigning monarch and connecting the monarch upon the throne to his or her predecessors, who sat upon the throne previously. Accordingly, many thrones are typically held to have been constructed or fabricated out of rare or hard to find materials that may be valuable or important to the land in question. Depending on the size of the throne in question it may be large and ornately designed as an emplaced instrument of a nation&#x27;s power, or it may be a symbolic chair with little or no precious materials incorporated into the design.

When used in a religious sense, throne can refer to one of two distinct uses. The first use derives from the practice in churches of having a bishop or higher-ranking religious official (archbishop, pope, etc.) sit on a special chair which in church referred to by written sources as a &quot;throne&quot;, or “cathedra” (Latin for &#x27;chair&#x27;) and is intended to allow such high-ranking religious officials a place to sit in their place of worship. The other use for throne refers to a belief among many of the world&#x27;s monotheistic and polytheistic religions that the deity or deities that they worship are seated on a throne. Such beliefs go back to ancient times, and can be seen in surviving artwork and texts which discuss the idea of ancient gods (such as the Twelve Olympians) seated on thrones. In the major Abrahamic religions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, the Throne of Yahweh is attested to in religious scriptures and teachings, although the origin, nature, and idea of the Throne of Yahweh in these religions differs according to the given religious ideology practiced.

In the west, a throne is most identified as the seat upon which a person holding the title &quot;King&quot;, &quot;Queen&quot;, &quot;Emperor&quot;, or &quot;Empress&quot; sits in a nation using a monarchy political system, although there are a few exceptions, notably with regards to religious officials such as the pope and bishops of various sects of the Christian faith. Changing geo-political tides have resulted in the collapse of several dictatorial and autocratic governments, which in turn have left a number of throne chairs empty. Many of these thrones—such as China&#x27;s Dragon Throne—survive today as historic examples of nation&#x27;s previous government.

==Antiquity==

Thrones were found throughout the canon of ancient furniture. The depiction of monarchs and deities as seated on chairs is a common topos in the iconography of the Ancient Near East.

The word &quot;throne&quot; itself is from Greek θρόνος (&quot;thronos&quot;), &quot;seat, chair&quot;, in origin a derivation from the PIE root &quot;&quot; &quot;to support&quot; (also in &quot;dharma&quot; &quot;post, sacrificial pole&quot;). Early Greek Διὸς θρόνους (&quot;Dios thronous&quot;) was a term for the &quot;support of the heavens&quot;, i.e. the axis mundi, which term when Zeus became an anthropomorphic god was imagined as the &quot;seat of Zeus&quot;. In Ancient Greek, a &quot;thronos&quot; was a specific but ordinary type of chair with a footstool, a high status object but not necessarily with any connotations of power. The Achaeans (according to Homer) were known to place additional, empty thrones in the royal palaces and temples so that the gods could be seated when they wished to be. The most famous of these thrones was the throne of Apollo in Amyclae.

The Romans also had two types of thrones—one for the emperor and one for the goddess Roma whose statues were seated upon thrones, which became centers of worship.

===Persia===

In Persia, the traditional name of the throne is the &quot;Takht-e Padeshah&quot;. From the Achaemenid era to the last Iranian dynasty Pahlavi, the throne was used for sitting shahs.

===Hebrew Bible===
The word &quot;throne&quot; in English translations of the Bible renders Hebrew &quot;&quot;. The pharaoh of the Exodus is described as sitting on a throne (Exodus 11:5, 12:29), but mostly the term refers to the throne of the kingdom of Israel, often called the &quot;throne of David&quot; or &quot;throne of Solomon&quot;. The literal throne of Solomon is described in : &quot;Moreover the king made a great throne of ivory, and overlaid it with the best gold.. The throne had six steps, and the top of the throne was round behind: and there were stays on either side on the place of the seat, and two lions stood beside the stays. And twelve lions stood there on the one side and on the other upon the six steps: there was not the like made in any kingdom.&quot; In the Book of Esther (5:3), the same word refers to the throne of the king of Persia.

The God of Israel himself is frequently described as sitting on a throne, referred to outside of the Bible as the Throne of God, in the Psalms, and in a vision Isaiah (6:1), and notably in Isaiah 66:1, YHWH says of himself &quot;The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool&quot; (this verse is alluded to by Matthew 5:34-35).

==Christian==
===Biblical===

In the Old Testament, Book of Kings I explicits the throne of Solomon: &quot;Then the king made a great throne covered with ivory and overlaid with fine gold. The throne had six steps, and its back had a rounded top. On both sides of the seat were armrests, with a lion standing beside each of them. Twelve lions stood on the six steps, one at either end of each step&quot; in Chapter 10 18-20.

In the New Testament, the angel Gabriel also refers to this throne in the Gospel of Luke (): &quot;He will be great, and will be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God will give Him the throne of His father David. And He will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom there will be no end.&quot;

Jesus promised his apostles that they would sit upon &quot;twelve thrones&quot;, judging the twelve tribes of Israel (). John&#x27;s Revelation states: &quot;And I saw a great white throne, and him that sat on it, from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away&quot; ().

The Apostle Paul speaks of &quot;thrones&quot; in . Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite, in his work &quot;De Coelesti Hierarchia&quot; (VI.7), interprets this as referring to one of the ranks of angels (corresponding to the Hebrew &quot;Arelim&quot; or &quot;Ophanim&quot;). This concept was expanded upon by Thomas Aquinas in his &quot;Summa Theologica&quot; (I.108), wherein the thrones are concerned with carrying out divine justice.

In Medieval times the &quot;Throne of Solomon&quot; was associated with the Virgin Mary, who was depicted as the throne upon which Jesus sat. The ivory in the biblical description of the Throne of Solomon was interpreted as representing purity, the gold representing divinity, and the six steps of the throne stood for the six virtues. Psalm 45:9 was also interpreted as referring to the Virgin Mary, with the entire Psalm describing a royal throne room.

===Ecclesiastical===
From ancient times, bishops of the Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, Anglican and other churches where episcopal offices exist, have been formally seated on a throne, called a &quot;cathedra&quot; (). Traditionally located in the sanctuary, the cathedra symbolizes the bishop&#x27;s authority to teach the faith (hence the expression &quot;ex cathedra&quot;) and to govern his flock.

&quot;Ex cathedra&quot; refers to the explicative authority, notably the extremely rarely used procedure required for a papal declaration to be &#x27;infallible&#x27; under Roman Catholic canon law. In several languages the word deriving from &quot;cathedra&quot; is commonly used for an academic teaching mandate, the professorial chair.

From the presence of this cathedra (throne), which can be as elaborate and precious as fits a secular prince (even if the prelate is not a prince of the church in the secular sense), a bishop&#x27;s primary church is called a &quot;cathedral&quot;. In the Roman Catholic Church, a basilica—from the Greek &quot;basilikos&quot; &#x27;royal&#x27;—now refers to the presence there of a papal canopy (&quot;ombrellino&quot;), part of his regalia, and applies mainly to many cathedrals and Catholic churches of similar importance or splendor. In Roman Antiquity a basilica was secular public hall. Thus, the term basilica may also refer to a church designed after the manner of the ancient Roman basilica. Many of the churches built by the emperor Constantine the Great and Justinian are of the basilica style.

Some other prelates besides bishops are permitted the use of thrones, such as abbots and abbesses. These are often simpler than the thrones used by bishops and there may be restrictions on the style and ornamentation used on them, according to the regulations and traditions of the particular denomination.

As a mark of distinction, Roman Catholic bishops and higher prelates have a right to a canopy above their thrones at certain ecclesiastical functions. It is sometimes granted by special privilege to prelates inferior to bishops, but always with limitations as to the days on which it may be used and the character of its ornamentation. The liturgical color of the canopy should correspond with that of the other vestments. When ruling monarchs attend services, they are also allowed to be seated on a throne that is covered by a canopy, but their seats must be outside the sanctuary.

In the Greek Orthodox Church, the bishop&#x27;s throne will often combine features of the monastic choir stall (&quot;kathisma&quot;) with appurtenances inherited from the Byzantine court, such as a pair of lions seated at the foot of the throne.

The term &quot;throne&quot; is often used in reference to patriarchs to designate their ecclesiastical authority; for instance, &quot;the Ecumenical Throne&quot; refers to the authority of the ecumenical patriarch of Constantinople.

Western bishops may also use a faldstool to fulfill the liturgical purpose of the cathedra when not in their own cathedral.

===Papal===

In the Roman Catholic Church, the pope is an elected monarch, both under canon law as supreme head of the church, and under international law as the head of state—styled &quot;sovereign pontiff&quot;—of the Vatican City State (the sovereign state within the city of Rome established by the 1929 Lateran Treaty). Until 1870, the pope was the elected monarch of the Papal States, which for centuries constituted one of the largest political powers on the divided Italian peninsula. To this day, the Holy See maintains officially recognised diplomatic status, and papal nuncios and legates are deputed on diplomatic missions throughout the world.

The pope&#x27;s throne (&quot;Cathedra Romana&quot;) is located in the apse of the Archbasilica of St. John Lateran, his cathedral as Bishop of Rome.

In the apse of Saint Peter&#x27;s Basilica, above the &quot;Altar of the Chair&quot; lies the &quot;Cathedra Petri&quot;, a throne believed to have been used by St Peter himself and other earlier popes; this relic is enclosed in a gilt bronze casting and forms part of a huge monument designed by Gian Lorenzo Bernini.

Unlike at his cathedral (Archbasilica of St. John Lateran), there is no permanent &quot;cathedra&quot; for the pope in St Peter&#x27;s Basilica, so a removable throne is placed in the basilica for the pope&#x27;s use whenever he presides over a liturgical ceremony. Prior to the liturgical reforms that occurred in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, a huge removable canopied throne was placed above an equally removable dais in the choir side of the &quot;Altar of the Confession&quot; (the high altar above the tomb of St Peter and beneath the monumental bronze baldachin); this throne stood between the apse and the Altar of the Confession.

This practice has fallen out of use with the 1960s and 1970s reform of Papal liturgy and, whenever the pope celebrates Mass in St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, a simpler portable throne is now placed on platform in front of the Altar of the Confession. Whenever Pope Benedict XVI celebrated the Liturgy of the Hours at St Peter&#x27;s, a more elaborate removable throne was placed on a dais to the side of the Altar of the Chair. When the pope celebrates Mass on the basilica steps facing St. Peter&#x27;s Square, portable thrones are also used.
In the past, the pope was also carried on occasions in a portable throne, called the &quot;sedia gestatoria&quot;. Originally, the &quot;sedia&quot; was used as part of the elaborate procession surrounding papal ceremonies that was believed to be the most direct heir of pharaonic splendor, and included a pair of flabella (fans made from ostrich feathers) to either side. Pope John Paul I at first abandoned the use of these implements, but later in his brief reign began to use the &quot;sedia&quot; so that he could be seen more easily by the crowds. The use of the &quot;sedia&quot; was abandoned by Pope John Paul II in favor of the so-called &quot;popemobile&quot; when outside. Near the end of his pontificate, Pope John Paul II had a specially constructed throne on wheels that could be used inside.

Prior to 1978, at the papal conclave, each cardinal was seated on a throne in the Sistine Chapel during the balloting. Each throne had a canopy over it. After a successful election, once the new pope accepted election and decided by what name he would be known, the cardinals would all lower their canopies, leaving only the canopy over the newly elected pope. This was the new pope&#x27;s first throne. This tradition was dramatically portrayed in the 1968 film &quot;The Shoes of the Fisherman&quot;.

==Medieval and early modern periods==
In European feudal countries, monarchs often were seated on thrones, based in all likelihood on the Roman magisterial chair. These thrones were originally quite simple, especially when compared to their Asian counterparts. In practice, any chair the monarch occupied in a formal setting served as a &quot;throne&quot;, though there were often special chairs used only for this purpose, kept in places the monarch often went to. Thrones began to be made in pairs, for the king and queen, which remained common in later periods. Sometimes they are identical, or the queen&#x27;s throne may be slightly less grand.

The 10th-century throne of the Byzantine emperor, placed in a dedicated throne hall, the Magnaura, included elaborate automatons of singing birds and moving animals.

The 10th-century throne of Ivan &quot;the Terrible&quot; (r. 1533-1584), dating from the mid-16th century, it is a product of West European Renaissance. It is shaped as a high-backed chair with arm rests, and adorned with ivory and walrus bone plaques intricately carved with mythological, heraldic and life scenes. Some carvings, depicting scenes from the biblical account of King David&#x27;s life, are of particular relevance, as David was seen as the ideal for Christian monarchs.

Although medieval examples tended to be retained in the early modern period, having acquired the aura of tradition, when new thrones were made they either continued medieval styles or were just very grand and elaborate versions of contemporary chairs or armchairs.

==South Asia==

In the Indian subcontinent, the traditional Sanskrit name for the throne was &quot;siṃhāsana&quot; (lit., seat of a lion). In the Mughal times the throne was called &quot;Shāhī takht&quot; (). The term &quot;gadi&quot; or &quot;gaddi&quot; (, also called &quot;rājgaddī&quot;) referred to a seat with a cushion used as a throne by Indian princes. That term was usually used for the throne of a Hindu princely state&#x27;s ruler, while among Muslim princes or Nawabs, save exceptions such as the Travancore State royal family, the term &quot;musnad&quot; (), also spelt as &quot;musnud&quot;, was more common, even though both seats were similar.

The Throne of Jahangir was built by Mughal emperor Jahangir in 1602 and is located at the &quot;Diwan-i-Khas&quot; (hall of private audience) at the Agra Fort.

The Peacock Throne was the seat of the Mughal emperors of India. It was commissioned in the early 17th century by Emperor Shah Jahan and was located in the Red Fort of Delhi. The original throne was subsequently captured and taken as a war trophy in 1739 by the Persian king Nadir Shah and has been lost ever since. A replacement throne based on the original was commissioned afterwards and existed until the Indian Rebellion of 1857.

Maharaja Ranjit Singh&#x27;s throne was made by the goldsmith Hafez Muhammad Multani about 1820 to 1830. Made of wood and resin core, covered with sheets of repoussé, chased and engraved gold.

The Golden Throne or Chinnada Simhasana or Ratna Simahasana in Kannada is the royal seat of the rulers of the Kingdom of Mysore. The Golden Throne is kept at Mysore Palace.

== Southeast Asia ==
In Burma, the traditional name for a throne is &quot;palin,&quot; from the Pali term &quot;pallaṅka&quot;, which means &quot;couch&quot; or &quot;sofa.&quot; The Burmese &quot;palin&quot; in pre-colonial times was used to seat the sovereign and his main consort, and is today used to seat religious leaders such as sayadaws, and images of the Buddha. Royal thrones are called &quot;yazapalin&quot; (ရာဇပလ္လင်), while thrones seating images or statues of the Buddha are called &quot;gaw pallin&quot; (ဂေါ့ပလ္လင်) or &quot;samakhan&quot; (စမ္မခဏ်), from the Pali term &quot;sammakhaṇḍa&quot;.

== East Asia ==

The Dragon Throne is the term used to identify the throne of the emperor of China. As the dragon was the emblem of divine imperial power, the throne of the emperor, who was considered a living god, was known as the Dragon Throne. The term can refer to very specific seating, as in the special seating in various structures in the Forbidden City of Beijing or in the palaces of the Old Summer Palace. In an abstract sense, the &quot;Dragon Throne&quot; also refers rhetorically to the head of state and to the monarchy itself. The Daoguang Emperor is said to have referred to his throne as &quot;the divine .&quot;

The throne of the emperors of Vietnam are often referred to as &quot;ngai vàng&quot; (&quot;golden throne&quot;) or &quot;ngôi báu&quot; (大寳/寶座) literally &quot;great precious&quot; (seat/position). The throne is always adorned with the pattern and motif of the Vietnamese dragon, which is the exclusive and privileged symbol of the Vietnamese emperors. The last existing imperial throne in Vietnam is the throne of the Nguyễn emperors placed in the Hall of Supreme Harmony at the Imperial City of Huế. It is designated as a national treasure of Vietnam. In Vietnamese folk religion, the gods, deities and ancestral spirits are believed to seat figuratively on thrones at places of worship. Therefore, on Vietnamese altars, there are various types of liturgical &quot;throne&quot; often decorated with red paint and golden gilding. 

The Phoenix Throne (御座/어좌 &quot;eojwa&quot;) is the term used to identify the throne of the king of Korea. In an abstract sense, the Phoenix Throne also refers rhetorically to the head of state of the Joseon dynasty (1392–1897) and the Empire of Korea (1897–1910). The throne is located at Gyeongbok Palace in Seoul.

The is the term used to identify the throne of the emperor of Japan. The term also can refer to very specific seating, such as the &quot;takamikura&quot; (高御座) throne in the Shishin-den at Kyoto Imperial Palace.

The throne of the Ryukyu Kingdom is located in Shuri Castle, Naha.

==Modern period==

During the Russian Empire, the throne in St. George&#x27;s Hall (the &quot;Greater Throne Room&quot;) in the Winter Palace was regarded as &quot;the&quot; throne of Russia. It sits atop a seven-stepped dais with a proscenium arch above and the symbol of the imperial family behind (the two-headed eagle). Peter I&#x27;s Room (the &quot;Smaller Throne Room&quot;) is modest in comparison to the former. The throne was made for Empress Anna Ivanovna in London. There is also a throne in the Grand Throne Room of the Peterhof Palace.

In some countries with a monarchy, thrones are still used and have important symbolic and ceremonial meaning. Among the most famous thrones still in usage are St Edward&#x27;s Chair, on which the British monarch is crowned, and the thrones used by monarchs during the state opening of parliaments in the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Canada, Australia, and Japan (see above) among others.

Some republics use distinctive throne-like chairs in some state ceremonial. The president of Ireland sits on a former viceregal throne during his or her inauguration ceremony, while lords mayor and lords provost of many British and Irish cities often preside over local councils from throne-like chairs.

Owing to its symbolic nature, a toilet is often jokingly referred to as &quot;a throne&quot; (namely, the &quot;porcelain throne&quot;).

<text>Henry Dreyfuss Brant (September 15, 1913 – April 26, 2008) was a Canadian-born American composer. An expert orchestrator with a flair for experimentation, many of Brant&#x27;s works featured spatialization techniques.

== Biography ==

Brant was born in Montreal, to American parents (his father was a violinist), in 1913. Something of a child prodigy, he began composing at the age of eight, and studied first at the McGill Conservatorium (1926–29) and then in New York City (1929–34). He played violin, flute, tin whistle, piano, organ, and percussion at a professional level and was fluent with the playing techniques for all of the standard orchestral instruments.

As a 19-year-old, Brant was the youngest composer included in Henry Cowell&#x27;s landmark book from 1933, &quot;American Composers on American Music&quot;; and Cowell realized that Brant had already demonstrated an early identification with the American experimental musical tradition. He was represented in Cowell&#x27;s anthology by an essay on &quot;oblique harmony&quot;, an idea which presaged some of the techniques used in his mature spatial compositions.

Thereafter Brant composed, orchestrated, and conducted for radio, film, ballet, and jazz groups. The stylistic diversity of these early professional experiences would also eventually contribute to the manner of his mature output. Starting in the late 1940s, he taught at Columbia University, the Juilliard School and, for 24 years, Bennington College. His students included American composer Patsy Rogers.

During the mid-1950s Brant came to the conclusion that (as he himself put it) &quot;single-style music … could no longer evoke the new stresses, layered insanities, and multi-directional assaults of contemporary life on the spirit.&quot; In pursuit of an optimal framework for the presentation of a music which embraced such a simultaneity of musical textures and styles, Brant made a series of experiments and compositions exploring the potential for the physical position of sounds in space to be used as an essential compositional element.

As well as producing works for the concert hall, Brant worked as an orchestrator for many Hollywood productions, including the Elizabeth Taylor movie &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), one of many collaborations with composer Alex North. Brant helped with the orchestration of North&#x27;s score for &quot;2001&quot;, and due to North&#x27;s stress-induced muscle spasms, Brant had to conduct the recording session for the film score. Other composers whom he assisted as orchestrator included Virgil Thomson, Aaron Copland, George Antheil, Douglas Moore, and Gordon Parks. Brant&#x27;s work as an orchestrator was not limited to film and stage: his long-term affinity for the music of Charles Ives — whose The Unanswered Question was an acknowledged inspiration for Brant&#x27;s spatial music — was ultimately found in the premiere of Brant&#x27;s arrangement of Ives&#x27; Second Piano Sonata, &quot;Concord, Mass 1840–60&quot; as &quot;A Concord Symphony&quot; in 1996. &quot;A Concord Symphony&quot; was recorded by the San Francisco Symphony on its SFS Media label.

From 1981, Brant made his home in Santa Barbara, California. There he died on April 26, 2008, at the age of 94.

==Music==
Beginning with the 1953 score &quot;Rural Antiphonies&quot; (predating Stockhausen&#x27;s Gruppen of 1955–57 but coming thirty-five years after Charles Ives&#x27;s Fourth Symphony of 1912–18 and Rued Langgaard&#x27;s &quot;Music of the Spheres&quot; of 1916–18), Brant developed the concept of spatial music, in which the location of instruments and/or voices in physical space is a significant compositional element. He identified the origins of the concept in the antiphonal music of the late renaissance and early baroque, in the antiphonal use of four brass ensembles placed in the corners of the stage in the Requiem of Hector Berlioz and, most importantly, in works of Charles Ives, in particular &quot;The Unanswered Question&quot;. Henry Brant was America&#x27;s foremost composer of acoustic spatial music. The planned positioning of performers throughout the hall, as well as on stage, was an essential factor in his composing scheme and a point of departure for a radically expanded range and intensity of musical expression. Brant&#x27;s mastery of spatial composing technique enabled him to write textures of unprecedented polyphonic and/or polystylistic complexity while providing maximum resonance in the hall and increased clarity of musical detail for the listener. His catalogue comprises over 100 spatial works.
In keeping with Brant&#x27;s belief that music can be as complex and contradictory as everyday life, his larger works often employ multiple, contrasting performing forces, as in &quot;Meteor Farm&quot; (1982) for symphony orchestra, large jazz band, two choruses, West African drum ensemble and chorus, South Indian soloists, large Javanese Gamelan ensemble, percussion orchestra and two Western solo sopranos. Brant&#x27;s spatial experiments convinced him that space exerts specific influences on harmony, polyphony, texture and timbre. He regarded space as music&#x27;s &quot;fourth dimension,&quot; (after pitch, time and timbre). Brant experimented with new combinations of acoustic timbres, even creating entire works for instrumental family groups of a single timbre: &quot;Orbits&quot; for 80 trombones, organ and sopranino voice, &quot;Ghosts &amp; Gargoyles&quot; for 9 flutes, and others for multiple trumpets and guitars. This predilection for ensembles of a single tone quality dates from &quot;Angels and Devils&quot; (1932) for an ensemble of 11 flutes. His experimentation was not always successful however. His 1972 piece Immortal Combat staged outside Lincoln Center was drowned out by traffic noise and a thunderstorm. With the exception of pieces composed for recorded media (in which he used over-dubbing or acoustical sound sources), Brant did not use electronic materials or permit amplification in his music.

He is perhaps best known for his compositions &quot;Verticals Ascending&quot; (conceptually based on the architecture of the Watts Towers in Los Angeles) and &quot;Horizontals Extending&quot;. A &quot;spatial opera&quot;, &quot;The Grand Universal Circus&quot; (Libretto: Patricia Gorman Brant) was premiered in 1956. Brant won the Pulitzer Prize for Music in 2002 for his composition &quot;Ice Field&quot;. In addition to composing, he played the violin, flute, tin whistle, percussion, piano, and organ and frequently included soloistic parts in his large works for himself to play.

Later premieres included &quot;Wind, Water, Clouds &amp; Fire&quot;, for 4 choirs and instrumentalists, commissioned by Present Music and premiered on November 19, 2004, at The Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist, Milwaukee, Wisconsin. &quot;Tremors&quot;, for 4 singers and 16 instrumentalists, commissioned by the Getty Research Institute, premiered on June 4, 2004, at the Getty Center in Los Angeles. &quot;Tremors&quot; was repeated in a Green Umbrella concert at LA&#x27;s Walt Disney Concert Hall on November 1, 2004. &quot;Ghosts &amp; Gargoyles&quot;, a concerto for flute solo with flute orchestra, for New Music Concerts, Toronto had its premiere on May 26, 2002. &quot;Ice Field&quot;, for large orchestral groups and organ, was commissioned by Other Minds for a December 2001 premiere by the San Francisco Symphony.

Brant&#x27;s handbook for orchestration, &quot;Textures and Timbres&quot;, was published posthumously.

<text>Ivor Bertie Gurney (28 August 1890 – 26 December 1937) was an English poet and composer, particularly of songs. He was born and raised in Gloucester. He suffered from bipolar disorder through much of his life and spent his last 15 years in psychiatric hospitals. Critical evaluation of Gurney has been complicated by this, and also by the need to assess both his poetry and his music. Gurney himself thought of music as his true vocation: &quot;The brighter visions brought music; the fainter verse&quot;.

==Life==
Ivor Gurney was born at 3 Queen Street, Gloucester, in 1890, as the second of four surviving children of David Gurney, a tailor, and his wife Florence, a seamstress.

He showed musical ability at an early age. He sang as a chorister at Gloucester Cathedral from 1900 to 1906, when he became an articled pupil of Herbert Brewer at the cathedral. There he met a fellow composer, Herbert Howells, who became a lifelong friend. Alongside Gurney and Howells, Brewer&#x27;s third pupil at this time was Ivor Novello, then known as Ivor Davies. He also enjoyed an enduring friendship with the poet F. W. Harvey, whom he met in 1908.

The adults of most significance in Gurney&#x27;s early life were the Rev. Alfred H. Cheesman, and two sisters, Emily and Margaret Hunt, who nurtured Gurney&#x27;s interests in music and literature. Gurney began composing music at the age of 14, and won a scholarship to the Royal College of Music in 1911. He studied there with Charles Villiers Stanford, who also taught Ralph Vaughan Williams, John Ireland, Marion Scott, Rebecca Clarke, Frank Bridge, Arthur Bliss, Herbert Howells and many others. Stanford told Howells that Gurney was potentially &quot;the biggest of them all&quot;, but he was &quot;unteachable&quot;.

Gurney possessed a dynamic personality, but he had been troubled by mood swings that became apparent during his teenage years. He had a difficult time focusing on his work at college and suffered his first breakdown in 1913. After taking a rest, he seemed to recover and returned to college.

Gurney&#x27;s studies were interrupted by World War I, when he enlisted as a private soldier in the Gloucestershire Regiment in February 1915. At the front, he began writing poetry seriously, sending his efforts to his friend, the musicologist and critic Marion Scott, who worked with Gurney as his editor and business manager. He was in the midst of writing the poems for what would become his first book, &quot;Severn and Somme&quot;, when he was wounded in the shoulder in April 1917. He recovered and returned to battle, still working on his book and composing music, including the songs &quot;In Flanders&quot; and &quot;By A Bierside&quot;. Sidgwick &amp; Jackson accepted &quot;Severn and Somme&quot; in July, with publication set for the autumn. In the meantime, Gurney was gassed in September the same year and sent to the Edinburgh War Hospital, where he met and fell in love with a VAD nurse, Annie Nelson Drummond, but the relationship later broke down.

There remains some controversy about the possible effects of the gas on his mental health, even though Gurney had clearly shown signs and symptoms of a bipolar disorder since his teens. &quot;Being gassed (mildly) [his parenthesis] with the new gas is no worse than catarrh or a bad cold,&quot; Gurney wrote in a letter to Marion Scott on 17 September 1917. After his release from hospital, he was posted to Seaton Delaval, a mining village in Northumberland, where he wrote poems, including &quot;Lying Awake in the Ward&quot;. His volume &quot;Severn and Somme&quot; was published in November 1917.

==Mental illness==
In March 1918, Gurney suffered a serious mental breakdown, triggered at least in part by the sudden ending of his relationship with Drummond. He was hospitalised in the Gallery Ward at Brancepeth Castle, County Durham, where he wrote several songs, despite the piano sounding, he said, like &quot;a boiler factory in full swing because of the stone walls&quot;. In June he threatened suicide, but he did not attempt it.

Gurney slowly regained some of his emotional stability and in October was honourably discharged from the army. Gurney received an unconventional diagnosis of nervous breakdown from &quot;deferred&quot; shell shock. The notion that Gurney&#x27;s instability should primarily be attributed to &quot;shell shock&quot; was perpetuated by Marion Scott, who used this term in the initial press releases after Gurney&#x27;s death, as well as in his entry for &quot;Grove&#x27;s Dictionary of Music and Musicians&quot;.

Gurney seemed to thrive after the war and was regarded as one of the most promising men of his generation, but his mental distress continued to worsen. He studied for a brief time with Ralph Vaughan Williams upon returning to the Royal College of Music, but he withdrew from the college before completing his studies. His second volume of poetry, &quot;War&#x27;s Embers&quot;, appeared in May 1919 to mixed reviews. He continued to compose, producing a large number of songs, instrumental pieces, chamber music, and two works for orchestra: &quot;War Elegy&quot; (1920) and &quot;A Gloucestershire Rhapsody&quot; (1919–1921). His music was being performed and published. However, by 1922, his condition had deteriorated to the point where his family had him declared insane.

It has been speculated that Gurney&#x27;s mental problems may have resulted from syphilis, contracted either while he was a music student before the war, or perhaps while serving as a soldier in France. Blevins, Gurney&#x27;s biographer, however, concludes that he did not suffer from syphilis. The issue has also been discussed, more recently, by Cambridge academic and broadcaster Kate Kennedy.

Gurney spent the last 15 years of his life in psychiatric hospitals, first for a short period at Barnwood House in Gloucester, and then at the City of London Mental Hospital, Dartford, where he was diagnosed as suffering from &quot;delusional insanity (systematised)&quot;. Gurney wrote prolifically during the asylum years, producing some eight collections of verse. His output included two plays in Shakespearean style – &quot;Gloucester Play&quot; (1926) and &quot;The Tewkesbury Trial&quot; (1926). During this time he appeared to believe himself to be William Shakespeare in person. He continued also to compose music but to a far lesser degree. An examination of his archive suggests that up to two-thirds of his musical output remains unpublished and unrecorded.

By the 1930s Gurney wrote little of anything, although he was described by Scott as being &quot;so sane in his insanity&quot;.

==Death and legacy==
Gurney died of tuberculosis while still a patient at the City of London Mental Hospital, shortly before dawn on 26 December 1937, aged 47. He was buried in Twigworth, near Gloucester. The service was conducted by his godfather, Rev. Alfred Cheesman. Gurney was &quot;a lover and maker of beauty&quot;, it was stated on his gravestone. (The stone was replaced after it was damaged – the original is now stored inside Twigworth church.) Marion Scott preserved Gurney&#x27;s manuscripts and letters and worked with composer Gerald Finzi to ensure that his legacy should not be forgotten.

On 11 November 1985, Gurney was among 16 Great War Poets commemorated on a slate stone unveiled in Westminster Abbey&#x27;s Poet&#x27;s Corner. The inscription on the stone was taken from Wilfred Owen&#x27;s &quot;Preface&quot; to his poems and reads: &quot;My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity.&quot;

In 2000, a stained-glass window was installed in St Mary de Lode Church, Gloucester and dedicated to the memory of Ivor Gurney. A memorial to Gurney was erected in 2009 Sint-Juliaan, near Ypres, close to the spot where he was the victim of a mustard gas attack in 1917.

A sculpture by Wolfgang Buttress entitled &quot;The Candle&quot; was unveiled in 2011 in Victoria Dock, Gloucester Docks; it is inscribed with lines from Gurney&#x27;s poem &quot;Requiem&quot; around the base. There is also a blue plaque memorial to Gurney in Eastgate Street, Gloucester.

In April 2014, BBC Four broadcast a documentary about Gurney, entitled &quot;The Poet Who Loved the War&quot;, presented by Tim Kendall, which focused on how the First World War had in some ways helped Gurney through the periods of depression he suffered and helped him become one of the war&#x27;s foremost poets.

In June and July 2014 Gurney was the subject of BBC Radio 3&#x27;s &quot;Composer of the Week&quot;, with contributions by Kate Kennedy and featuring a number of first recordings made by the BBC especially for the programme. In 2021 Kennedy published &quot;Ivor Gurney: Dweller in Shadows&quot;, claimed to be &quot;the first comprehensive biography&quot; of Gurney.
The first comprehensive biography of Gurney to appear after Michael Hurd&#x27;s 1978 biography was &quot;Ivor Gurney and Marion Scott: Song of Pain and Beauty&quot; by Pamela Blevins, The Boydell Press, 2008.

==Works==
===Compositions===

Gurney wrote hundreds of poems and more than 300 songs but only set a handful of his own poems to music, the best-known of those being &quot;Severn Meadows&quot;. The &quot;Five Elizabethan Songs&quot; (or &#x27;The Elizas&#x27; as he called them) were written in 1913-14 while he was still a student at the Royal College of Music, and published in 1920 by Winthrop Rogers. The song cycles &quot;Ludlow and Teme&quot; (published 1923) and &quot;The Western Playland&quot;, (published 1926), both settings of poetry by A. E. Housman, were prepared for publication with the help of admirers and friends, including Gerald Finzi and his wife Joy, Howard Ferguson and Marion Scott. Oxford University Press issued two sets of ten songs in 1938, a year after his death, selected and edited by Finzi and Ferguson. Three further sets of ten songs came out in 1952, 1959 and 1979.

Gurney set to music many of the poems of his contemporaries, including at least nineteen poems written by Edward Thomas (six of them collected in the orchestral song cycle &quot;Lights Out&quot; published in 1926), at least seven by W. H. Davies and five by Rupert Brooke. All of Gurney&#x27;s settings from the Canadian poet Bliss Carman&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1904) were gathered in &quot;Seven Sappho Songs&quot; by Richard Carder in 1998.

It has been suggested that there is something of Schubert and Schumann, but considerably less of the prevailing folk idiom of the time, in the intensity of Gurney&#x27;s musical language. He had a preference for setting dark ballads, as Schubert, Loewe and Brahms had before him, and &quot;knew his Brahms and Schumann backwards, as his piano pieces testify&quot;. But where he does lean towards folksong, as in his setting of Belloc&#x27;s &quot;Ha’nacker Mill&quot;, it is often hard to tell whether the melody is original or traditional.

Gurney&#x27;s instrumental and chamber music is only now coming to light. An exception are the &quot;Five Preludes&quot; for piano, which were written in 1919-20 and published the following year. But he also wrote four piano sonatas and as many as 20 string quartets, most of which have been lost. Three of the piano sonatas (No. 2 incomplete) have been recorded by George Rowley. The String Quartet in D minor, composed in 1924, received its premiere recording in 2020. There are also two violin sonatas, in E-flat major and in D major, both dating from 1918/19 and both now recorded.

===War poet/local poet===
Edmund Blunden, at the urging of Gerald Finzi, assembled the first collection of Gurney&#x27;s poetry which was published in 1954. This was followed by P. J. Kavanagh&#x27;s &quot;Collected Poems&quot;, first published in 1982 and reissued in 2004. It remains the most comprehensive edition of Gurney&#x27;s poetry. Gurney is regarded as one of the great World War I poets, and like others of them, such as Edward Thomas, whom he admired, he often contrasted the horrors of the front line with the beauty and tranquillity of his native English landscape – these themes were explored in the 2012 musical play &quot;A Soldier and a Maker&quot;.

Deliberately unrhetorical in his poetic tone, and writing as a ranker, not an officer, Gurney offered a complex, wry, unheroic view of the soldierly world of the Western Front: presenting not a large statement (for or against war), but an individual experience. Without diminishing the horrors of the front line, Gurney&#x27;s poems often emphasise the moments of relief. &quot;On Rest&quot; was above all what he called &quot;the relief of knowing mere being&quot;. By detailing the &quot;small trifles&quot; of trench life – moments of comradeship, letters from home, singsongs, bread and Fray Bentos corned beef, wine, chocolate and café-au-lait Gurney was able (in Blunden&#x27;s words) to &quot;express part of the Western Front secret... with distinctive, intimate and imaginative quickness.&quot; In so far as he had a &quot;manifesto&quot;, it was to present &quot;the protest of the physical against the exalted spiritual; of the cumulative weight of small facts against the one large&quot;.

At the same time, Gurney was something of a local poet, rooted in Gloucester and its surroundings, which remained a touchstone of reality for him, in the front line and later in the asylum. In the preface to his first book, he wrote of &quot;my county, Gloucester, that whether I live or die stays always with me.&quot; His tribute poem &quot;Crickley Hill&quot; was described by Edna Longley as &quot;perhaps Gurney&#x27;s most rapturous expression of local patriotism&quot;.

<doc id="256329" wikidata="Q7101074" url="?curid=256329" title="1990 Oregon Ballot Measure 5">
<text>Ballot Measure 5 was a landmark piece of direct legislation in the U.S. state of Oregon in 1990. Measure 5, an amendment to the Oregon Constitution (Article XI, Section 11), established limits on Oregon&#x27;s property taxes on real estate. Its primary champion and spokesman was Don McIntire, a politically-active Gresham health club owner who would go on to lead the Taxpayers Association of Oregon.

Property taxes dedicated for school funding were capped at $15 per $1,000 of real market value per year and gradually lowered to $5 per $1,000 per year. Property taxes for other purposes were capped at $10 per $1,000 per year. Thus, the total property tax rate would be 1.5% at the end of the five-year phase in period. The measure transferred the responsibility for school funding from local government to the state, to equalize funding.

The measure was passed in the November 6, 1990 general election with 574,833 votes in favor, 522,022 votes against. It was one of the most contentious measures in Oregon election history.

Results by county:

== Historical significance ==
Although measure numbers are reused, the effect of this measure on the state was significant enough that when Oregonians speak of &quot;Measure 5&quot;, they are usually referring to the specific measure passed in 1990. Measure 5 is often seen as the beginning of the Oregon tax revolt. One effect of the measure was that funding for local schools was shifted from primarily local property tax funds to state funds. With this, it led to a general equalization of funding between districts as funds are now given to districts based on the number of students in each district. Schools with higher value property in their districts previously could fund local schools at a higher rate than more economically depressed areas.

Passage of the measure and the limits led to some discussion of eliminating county services in Multnomah County by combining them with Portland city services or Metro, as well as talks of combining Multnomah, Washington, and Clackamas counties into one large urban county for the Portland metro area.

== Lasting effects and subsequent legislation ==
The measure has remained controversial since its passage. Oregon remains one of only five states without a sales tax, the others being Alaska, Delaware, Montana, and New Hampshire. Furthermore, the measure is blamed for cuts in school programs, the budget crises of 2002 and 2003 and cuts to statewide public safety programs, including deep cuts to the Oregon State Police which never fully recovered from 50% staffing reductions. Many critics say that then-Governor Barbara Roberts&#x27; warning that Measure 5&#x27;s passage would lead to massive chaos has been borne out. Supporters defend the measure as necessary to curb government spending excesses.

Measure 5 was followed up with Measure 47 in 1996 and Measure 50 in 1997. Measure 47 limited the growth of a property&#x27;s assessed value to 3% maximum per year to combat local governments&#x27; raising assessed values to make up the difference in the rate they could charge. Measure 50 clarified that measure.

<doc id="256332" wikidata="Q146617" url="?curid=256332" title="Achillea">
<text>Achillea is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. The plants typically have frilly leaves and are known colloquially as yarrows, although this common name usually refers to &quot;A. millefolium&quot;. The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles, whose soldiers were said to have used yarrow to treat their wounds; this is reflected by common names such as allheal and bloodwort. The genus is native primarily to Eurasia and North America.

==Description==
These plants typically have frilly, hairy, aromatic leaves. The plants show large, flat clusters of small flowers at the top of the stem. The flowers can be white, yellow, orange, pink or red and are generally visited by many insects, and are thus characterised by a generalised pollination system.

== Taxonomy ==
Carl Linnaeus described the genus in 1753. The common name &quot;yarrow&quot; is usually applied to &quot;Achillea millefolium&quot;, but may also be used for other species within the genus.

=== Selected species ===
Nearly 1,000 names have been published within the genus &quot;Achillea&quot;, at or below the level of species. Sources differ widely as to which should be recognized as species, which merit subspecies or variety status, and which ones are merely synonyms of better-established names. For convenience, the Plant List maintained by the Kew Botanic Gardens is followed.

=== Cultivars ===
The following cultivars are recipients of the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:
*&quot;Achillea ageratifolia&quot; 
*&quot;Achillea&quot; &#x27;Coronation Gold&#x27; 
*&quot;Achillea&quot; &#x27;Credo&#x27;

*&quot;Achillea&quot; &#x27;Moonshine&#x27; 
*&quot;Achillea&quot; &#x27;Summerwine&#x27;

=== Etymology ===
The genus was named after the Greek mythological character Achilles. According to legend, Achilles&#x27; soldiers used yarrow to treat their wounds, hence some of its common names such as allheal and bloodwort.

==Distribution and habitat==
The genus is primarily native to Europe, temperate areas of Asia, and North America. 

==Ecology==
&quot;Achillea&quot; species are used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species.

==Uses==
&quot;Achillea&quot; species and cultivars are popular garden plants.

<text>Mercury was a brand of medium-priced automobiles that was produced by American manufacturer Ford Motor Company between the 1939 and 2011 motor years. Created by Edsel Ford in 1938, Mercury was established to bridge the gap between the Ford and Lincoln model lines within Ford Motor Company. From 1945 until its closure, it formed half of the Lincoln-Mercury Division of the company.

In addition to serving as a combined sales network for Ford&#x27;s two premium automotive brands, Lincoln-Mercury also represented the Continental (1956–1960), Edsel (1958–1960, formally designated Mercury-Edsel-Lincoln Division), Comet (1960–1961), Capri (1970-1978), De Tomaso (1972-1975), and Merkur (1985–1989, forming Lincoln-Mercury-Merkur). Through the use of platform sharing and manufacturing commonality, Mercury vehicles often shared components and engineering with Ford or Lincoln (or both concurrently), serving as counterparts for vehicles from both divisions.

Following an extended decline in sales and market share for Mercury, Ford announced the closure of the division at the end of 2010.

==History==
During the mid-1930s, under the leadership of Henry Ford (1863–1947)&#x27;s son Edsel Ford (1893–1943), the Ford Motor Company discovered that it needed to expand its brand footprint to match its largest competitors. In 1935, Ford offered only its namesake brand and the cars of its more expensive luxury vehicles of its Lincoln Motor Company division. In contrast to the comprehensive line of brands available from General Motors (seven) and the Chrysler Corporation (four), Ford offered its Ford Standard/DeLuxe V8 range and the Lincoln Model K. In contrast to the Ford V8, the Model K was among the most expensive vehicles built and sold then in the United States, rivaled in price by the Cadillac V-12 (and V-16), Duesenberg Model J, and the flagship lines of the Germans&#x27; Mercedes-Benz and the British of Rolls-Royce.

To address the gap between Ford and Lincoln, Ford Motor Company launched its own version of the late 1920s General Motors Companion Make Program, leading the company to expand from two nameplates to five by the end of the decade. For 1936, Lincoln-Zephyr was introduced as a sub-marque of Lincoln, giving the line a V12 car competing against the LaSalle and Buick, plus the notable revolutionary streamlining style of the Chrysler Airstream and the Airflow, along with the Packard One-Twenty. For 1938, De Luxe Ford became a sub-marque of Ford, offering a higher-price V8 car with a model-specific interior and exterior trim.

In 1937, Edsel Ford began work on Mercury as a completely new brand, personally selecting the Roman god&#x27;s name from over 100 options – in spite of the name having been used just four years earlier for the Chevrolet Mercury and no fewer than seven separate failed automobile companies from 1903 to 1923.

In November 1938, Edsel Ford introduced four body styles of the Mercury Eight at the New York Auto Show. Along with a two-door sedan and a four-door sedan, the Mercury was also introduced as a two-door convertible and a two-door trunked sedan; the body design was overseen by E.T. &#x27;Bob&#x27; Gregorie. While similar in concept to the modestly restyled De Luxe Ford, the V8-powered Mercury was an all-new car sized between the V8 Ford and the V12 Lincoln-Zephyr.

=== 1939–1940s ===
For 1939, the Mercury was launched at a starting price of US$916 ($ in dollars); over 65,800 vehicles were sold in the inaugural model year. In response to the popularity of the model line, Ford revised its branding structure after 1940; De Luxe Ford was discontinued as a sub-marque (returning to its previous use as a Ford trim line), and all Lincolns became derived from the Lincoln-Zephyr (including the Continental) as Lincoln retired the Model K.

For 1941, the Mercury underwent its first redesign; in another change, the model line adopted the Mercury Eight nameplate used in sales literature. To consolidate development and production, the Mercury Eight shared much of its bodyshell with Ford, distinguished by its longer wheelbase. To further separate the two model lines, the Eight was given a model-specific grille, exterior and interior trim, and taillamps. For the first time, a decorative wood-bodied station wagon (later nicknamed as a &quot;woodie&quot;) was offered by the brand.

Unlike Ford products where components originated from the Ford River Rouge Complex outside Detroit, Michigan and shipped in knock-down kits to dozens of cities across the United States, all Mercury vehicles only originated completely assembled from River Rouge until 1952 when Wayne Stamping &amp; Assembly Company started production and was the only location that created Mercury components which were sent to only three cities that had dedicated assembly branch factories that completed Mercury vehicles until 1960. This approach was also used for Lincoln vehicles which only originated from the Lincoln Motor Company Plant until 1958 when Wixom Assembly Plant replaced the old Lincoln plant and completed assembly and became the component location for all Lincoln vehicles and the Ford Thunderbird and sent knock-down kits to selected branch locations in the United States.

For 1942, Mercury implemented several changes to the Eight. As part of an interior redesign, the Eight received a dashboard configured similar to the Lincoln Zephyr. For the first time, the Flathead V8 was offered with in standard form. To compete with Fluid Drive (Chrysler) and Hydramatic (General Motors), the 1942 Mercury offered Liquamatic, the first semi-automatic transmission offered by Ford Motor Company. Shared with Lincoln, Liquamatic proved complex and unreliable, with many systems replaced by conventional manual transmissions. As production was suspended following the outbreak of World War II, Ford produced only 24,704 1942 Mercury vehicles.

Following the rise of Henry Ford II at Ford Motor Company in September 1945, the divisional structure of the company underwent further change. On October 22, 1945, Ford merged Mercury with Lincoln Motor Company, creating the combined Lincoln-Mercury Division. While functioning as a single entity, Lincoln-Mercury would continue to market both namesake model line. The Lincoln-Zephyr reentered production following the war, dropping the Zephyr nameplate; the Continental (and the V12 engine) ended production after 1948.

On November 1, 1945, the first 1946 Mercury vehicles rolled off the assembly line. In line with Lincoln and Ford (and virtually all American-manufactured vehicles), 1946 production was functionally unchanged from 1942. The Eight underwent several minor revisions, including the return of vertically oriented grille trim. As few were installed before the 1942 suspension of production, Mercury did not return the Liquamatic transmission option. Alongside the wood-paneled station wagon, Mercury introduced a wood-bodied Sportsman convertible. For 1947 and 1948, few major changes were made. The rare Sportsman convertible was dropped for 1947 and the hubcaps were restyled; 1948 Mercurys were effectively carryover.

In 1949, Ford Motor Company launched its first all-new post-war designs for all three of its model lines. In contrast to the 1941-1948 Mercury, the 1949 redesign placed Mercury and Lincoln within a common bodyshell. Largely distinguished by headlight and grille designs, Mercury and Lincoln would also feature separately-trimmed interiors. Mechanically, Ford, Lincoln, and Mercury each offered a separate version of the Ford Flathead V8.

For many years after its production, the 1949–1951 Mercury Eight (most commonly in two-door form) would develop a following as a street rod, making an appearance in several films.

===1950s===
The 1949 redesign of the Mercury model line proved successful, with the division increasing its sales six-fold over 1948, becoming the sixth-most popular brand in the United States. In contrast to competing medium-price brands from Chrysler and General Motors (and independents including Nash, Hudson, or Packard), Mercury continued to offer the Eight as its sole model line.

For 1950, the Monterey name made its first appearance, denoting a special edition of two-door coupes (alongside the Lincoln Lido and Ford Crestliner). Intended to compete against the hardtop coupes from General Motors, the Monterey simulated the appearance of a convertible through the use of a canvas or vinyl roof (though with a pillared roofline). During the year, the one-millionth Mercury vehicle was produced. In 1951, Mercury regained an automatic transmission option (for the first time since the 1942 Liquamatic), with the &quot;Merc-O-Matic&quot; 3-speed automatic (a rebranding of Ford Cruise-O-Matic).

For 1952, Mercury redesigned its model line, with two nameplates replacing the Eight. The Monterey returned as a distinct model line, slotted above the base-trim Custom; both shared bodies with Lincoln. In 1953, the expansion of the model line proved successful; after emerging from a war-depressed market, Mercury nearly doubled in sales, ranking eighth. While Mercury would have subsequently higher yearly sales, at 5%, this is the largest market share ever held by the division. For 1954, Ford replaced the long-running Flathead V8 (dating from 1932) with an overhead-valve Y-block V8, with Ford and Mercury receiving their own versions of the engine. As a submodel of the standard Monterey hardtop, the Monterey Sun Valley was introduced, featuring a fixed-panel acrylic glass sunroof. While offering an open-air interior, the Sun Valley was difficult to market in warm-weather climates (as the glass panel warmed the interior to uncomfortable temperatures).

In 1955, Mercury underwent a redesign of its model line. While again sharing much of its bodyshell with Lincoln, the division adopted the three-model range of Ford. As its premium model range, the Montclair was introduced above the Monterey (including the Sun Valley glass-top hardtop, for its final year). The revision proved successful, as Mercury reached its then-highest sales. The divisional structure of Ford was revised; Lincoln-Mercury was split (largely to accommodate the formation of the Continental division) In 1956, Mercury renamed the Custom the Medalist (to avoid confusion with the Ford Custom).

For 1957, Mercury redesigned its model range, with a wheelbase sized between Ford and Lincoln. In a move upmarket, the slow-selling Medalist was discontinued, with the Monterey becoming the base model Mercury. Previewed by the 1956 XM-800 concept car, the Turnpike Cruiser (the pace car of the 1957 Indianapolis 500) was slotted above the Montclair, distinguished by its quad headlamps and retractable rear window. In line with Ford, Mercury station wagons became a distinct model line, with the Commuter, Voyager, and Colony Park; all Mercury station wagons were hardtops.

In 1958, to accommodate the introduction of Edsel, Ford revised its divisional structure, with Mercury, Edsel, and Lincoln forming a combined division (M-E-L). The Edsel Citation and Edsel Corsair shared their chassis (and roofline) with Mercury, with the entire division overlapping Mercury in price (a key reason behind its failure). The Park Lane was introduced as a flagship model line on a wheelbase (with the Turnpike Cruiser becoming part of the Montclair line). Shared with Lincoln (and the Ford Thunderbird), Mercury introduced a &quot;Marauder&quot; V8; optional on all Mercurys, a &quot;Super Marauder&quot; version became the first mass-produced engine to be rated at .

For 1959, Mercury underwent a revision of its body, expanding to a wheelbase. Coinciding with the discontinuation of the Edsel Corsair and Citation, Mercury produced its own body and chassis (for the first time since 1940). The division pared several slow-selling model lines, including the Turnpike Cruiser and Voyager; the two-door Commuter was in its final year. Mercury was one of the first American full size cars to adopt parallel-action windshield wipers.

As with many medium-price brands, the Mercury brand was hit hard by the economy of the late 1950s. While remaining eighth in sales from 1957 to the end of the decade, Mercury saw a 60 percent drop in sales in 1958, outranked by Rambler. While outselling the heavily marketed Edsel by over a two-to-one margin; it would take nearly 1958 and 1959 combined to match the 1957 sales total.

===1960s===
While affecting the American automotive industry as a whole, the economic recession of the late 1950s had the harshest impact upon medium-priced brands. Though Edsel was quietly discontinued early in the 1960 model year (before the end of 1959), the future of Lincoln-Mercury remained at risk, as Lincoln had lost over $60 million from 1958 to 1960 ($ in dollars). To end the financial losses, several Ford executives (led by Ford President Robert McNamara) proposed restructuring Ford down to its namesake division. McNamara (prior to leaving Ford to become Secretary of Defense) allowed the Lincoln-Mercury division to remain, under several conditions. Lincoln reduced its model line from three to one, with the all-new Lincoln Continental offering a much smaller exterior footprint; to establish model continuity, the brand shifted to a nine-year model cycle (the longest for an American brand). With the closure of Edsel, Mercury was to share its body with Ford (on its own wheelbase). In place of the five divisional bodies produced in 1958 (Ford, Lincoln/Continental, Mercury, large Edsel, small Edsel), Ford produced two for 1961 (Ford/Mercury, Lincoln).

For 1960, the division released the Comet brand, its first compact car line. Originally developed for Edsel, the Comet was a divisional counterpart of the Ford Falcon (stretched to a 114-inch wheelbase); styled with four headlights (instead of two), the Comet was also fitted with wide tailfins. Coinciding with its Edsel origins and concerns about potential negative impacts of compact cars on the Mercury brand, the Comet was sold as a standalone product until the brands merged for the 1962 model year(similar to the first-generation Plymouth Valiant). Vehicle Identification plaques of 1960 and 1961 models read &#x27;Made in U.S.A. by Comet.&#x27;

For 1961, Mercury released an all-new full-size range, dropping the Mercury-exclusive chassis in favor of sharing a chassis with the Ford Galaxie (extended to a 120-inch wheelbase). Though visibly sharing front doors with the Galaxie, the Mercury derived multiple elements of its styling from its 1960 predecessor. The Montclair and Park Lane were dropped in favor of the wider-selling Monterey; the Commuter and Colony Park station wagons returned. Slotted below the Monterey, the Mercury Meteor (as with the Comet) was a model line inherited from the closure of Edsel; as the Monterey matched the Ford Galaxie, the Meteor was a counterpart of the Fairlane.

1961 also brought the first 6-cylinder engine to the brand. The 1961 Meteor 600 featured a standard Mileage Maker Inline-6.

For 1962, Mercury brought its model range closer in line with Ford. The Meteor (after only one year of sale) was reintroduced as an all-new intermediate range (again following the design of the Ford Fairlane). For non-station wagons, Mercury introduced &quot;S&quot; sub-models to market sportier content. Along with higher-performance powertrains, the option packages included full-length floor consoles, floor shifters, and bucket seats with the S-22 (Comet), S-33 (Meteor), and S-55 (Monterey).

For 1963, the Monterey was designed with two different rooflines for each body configuration. The standard design was a &quot;breezeway&quot; reverse-slant rear window (similar to the 1958-1960 Continental), offered on all versions (except for the convertible). Introduced as a mid-year option, the &quot;Marauder&quot; fastback roofline was introduced for two-door sedans and hardtops (four-doors were added in 1964). Shared with the Ford Galaxie 500XL, the aerodynamically sleeker roofline helped Mercury gain ground in stock-car racing.

By the middle of the decade, the fate of Mercury was no longer entangled with the failure of Edsel, with a secure future competing against Buick and Oldsmobile, the middle of the Chrysler range, and the top of the American Motors range. For 1964, the Montclair and Park Lane were reintroduced while the S-models were dropped. For 1965, the full-size line underwent a complete redesign. Though again derived from the Ford Galaxie, the Monterey/Montclair/Park Lane adopted many styling elements from Lincoln, with Mercury marketing the line as &quot;built in the Lincoln tradition&quot;.

For 1966, the Comet became the counterpart of the Ford Fairlane (effectively replacing the discontinued Meteor). After a two-year hiatus, the S-55 returned as a distinct higher-performance variant of the Monterey. In a design change, the fastback Marauder roofline was discontinued; the Breezeway design was dropped in 1967 (the latter, following the increasing availability of air conditioning units integrated within the ventilation system).

In 1967, Mercury debuted its two most successful and longest-running nameplates: the Mercury Cougar and Mercury Marquis. The Cougar was developed to bridge the gap between the Ford Mustang and the Ford Thunderbird, while the Marquis offered the division a competitor towards sedan lines such as the Buick Electra, Oldsmobile Ninety Eight, and Chrysler New Yorker. For 1967, the Marquis was available as a formal-roof 2-door hardtop (derived from the Ford LTD, but with its own roofline); the Mercury Park Lane Brougham was offered as flagship Mercury four-door sedan/hardtop. In various forms, the Marquis nameplate would be used by Mercury until its 2011 closure.

For 1968, the Mercury model range underwent two revisions to its intermediate range. The Mercury Montego (based on the Ford Torino) was gradually phased in to replace the Comet (dropped after 1969); the performance-oriented Mercury Cyclone became a stand-alone model range, slotted above the Cougar. To further establish the brand in motorsport, the aerodynamically optimized Cyclone Spoiler II was homologated as the 1969 Mercury entry for NASCAR.

For 1969, the full-size Mercury line was given an all-new body and chassis (again shared with Ford, on its own 124-inch wheelbase). The nameplates were again revised, with the Marquis becoming a full model range (replacing the Montclair and Park Lane outright) and the Colony Park as the only Mercury full-size station wagon. To differentiate the Marquis from the Monterey, Mercury introduced hidden headlights for the former. Replacing the S-55, the Mercury Marauder became a stand-alone full-size two-door, competing against the Oldsmobile Toronado and Buick Riviera; an optional 429 cubic-inch V8 was offered. Though still sharing its chassis with the Mustang, the Cougar was configurable as either a pony car, personal luxury coupe, or a muscle car, with an &quot;Eliminator&quot; performance package featuring an available 428 Cobra Jet V8. 

===1970s===
During the 1970s, the product line of the Mercury division was influenced by several factors that affected all American nameplates. While sporty cars would not disappear from the division, Mercury refocused itself further on its original purpose: building vehicles upmarket from Ford.

1970 marked the introduction of the Capri, the first subcompact car sold by the division. In place of marketing a counterpart of the Ford Pinto economy car, Mercury commenced captive imports of European Ford Capri from Cologne, Germany; the model line was among the first compact sports cars sold in the United States. The first Ford Motor Company vehicle in North America offered with (an optional) V6 engine, the Capri was sold through Lincoln-Mercury, but carried no divisional branding until 1979.

For 1971, Mercury gradually distanced itself away from performance vehicles. The Marauder was discontinued along with the Marquis convertible; the Brougham name made its return. The Cougar was updated alongside the Mustang, but was repackaged to compete more closely with the A-body coupes (Chevrolet Monte Carlo, Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme, Pontiac Grand Prix) of General Motors. The Comet made its return as the smallest Mercury line, becoming a counterpart of Ford Maverick (and sharing its underpinnings with its 1960 namesake). At the other end of the performance spectrum from the Capri, Lincoln-Mercury began imports of the De Tomaso Pantera in 1971. Assembled in Modena, Italy, the Pantera was a two-door, mid-engine coupe powered by a 330 hp Ford 5.8L Cleveland V8.

For 1972, the intermediate Montego line (based on the Ford Gran Torino) was redesigned with a body-on-frame chassis, creeping into full-size dimensions. After years of losing market share to the Cougar, the Cyclone was quietly discontinued, with Mercury moving largely to the Cougar for racing.

The 1973 model year brought major functional changes to the Mercury line, the fuel crisis notwithstanding; in various forms, all Mercury cars were given 5-mph bumpers. The Marquis and Monterey were given an exterior update, adopting a &quot;pillared hardtop&quot; roofline (frameless door glass supported by a thin B-pillar). As American manufacturers shifted away from convertibles, the final convertible produced by Ford Motor Company during the 1970s was a 1973 Mercury Cougar.

1974 marked several changes, geared primarily towards the Mercury intermediate line. The Cougar underwent a redesign, growing in size to share the body of the Montego two-door hardtop and becoming the counterpart of the Ford (Gran Torino) Elite. The Montego saw its GT two-door fastback body discontinued. Lincoln-Mercury ended distribution of the DeTomaso Pantera after 1974, as American production of its 5.8L engine ended.

For 1975, the Mercury model range underwent a series of transitions. The long-running Monterey nameplate was discontinued, leaving the Marquis as the sole full-size Mercury. To expand its full-size offerings, a new Mercury Grand Marquis was introduced between the Marquis Brougham and the Lincoln Continental. Developed as the intended successor for the Comet, the Mercury Monarch led to a completely new market segment: the luxury compact car. Both the Grand Marquis and the Monarch were met with success, with the latter used as personal cars among Ford leadership (including Henry Ford II).

1976 saw the expansion of the smallest end of the Mercury model line. Introduced in Canada for 1975, the Mercury Bobcat gave the division its own version of the Ford Pinto subcompact. The Capri (devoid of devisional branding) became the Capri II, following its redesign in Europe. Following its update, the Capri II became the second most-imported car in the United States (behind the Volkswagen Beetle).

For 1977, Mercury made significant revisions to improve sales to its intermediate model range (its slowest-selling models). While technically a mid-cycle model update, the Montego was renamed the Cougar, as the model line (a counterpart of the renamed Ford LTD II) added two-door and four-door sedans and a station wagon for the first time. The previous Cougar XR-7 also was updated and now paired with the redesigned Ford Thunderbird; for the next two decades, the two model lines would share a common design. The change from Montego to Cougar was well-received, as sales of the model line nearly tripled. While V8 engines were now optional on some Buick and Oldsmobile model lines, the Grand Marquis remained with a standard 460 cubic-inch V8 (the second-largest displacement engine used in an American automobile).

1978 began a transition of the Mercury line that would lead into the 1980s. The Mercury Zephyr compact replaced the outdated Comet as a version of the Ford Fairmont. The Zephyr was an inaugural model line of the Fox platform, a chassis architecture that would underpin multiple vehicles from all three Ford divisions from the 1970s into the early 2000s. Lincoln-Mercury ended importations of the Capri II in late 1977 (shortly before the introduction of the Ford Capri Mk III), with leftover stock sold as 1978 vehicles. Of the 580,000 vehicles sold, one out of every 10 1978 Mercurys were Cougars.

For 1979, Ford Motor Company released its downsized full-size model lines. As American brands had shifted away from muscle cars at the beginning of the decade, the fuel crises of 1973 and 1979 had also sparked the decline of the landyacht. Introduced two years after the redesign of the General Motors B-body and C-body lines, Ford introduced the all-new Panther platform for a smaller Marquis/Grand Marquis. Though smaller than the Cougar sedan in its exterior footprint (except for width), the 1979 Marquis gained interior space over its 1978 predecessor. The Capri made its return, becoming a Mercury-brand vehicle; instead of a captive import, the model line was now a version of the Ford Mustang hatchback (both adopting the 1978 Fox platform). Bolstered by the redesign of the Marquis and the popularity of Cougar XR7, the Mercury brand reached its all-time sales peak, with nearly 670,000 vehicles sold.

===1980s===
As Lincoln-Mercury entered the 1980s, Mercury continued the renewal of its model line, redesigning its entire lineup between 1978 and 1982. Since the early 1960s, the continued use of platform sharing had left Ford and Mercury model lines move towards exteriors that held little visible brand differentiation between certain vehicles; some model lines were distinguished primarily by grilles, wheels, badging, and other minor trim. Though the practice maximized production resources, it had largely removed much previous identity held by the nameplate. Through the 1980s, designers sought to change course by reestablishing a brand identity for Mercury while continuing to maximize production resources through platform sharing. Initially associated with full-size sedans and personal luxury cars, Mercury began to diversify its model offerings.

For 1980, Mercury downsized the Cougar, erasing the previous size overlap between it and the Marquis. Pared down to the XR7 coupe, the Cougar was redesigned alongside the Ford Thunderbird as a long-wheelbase version of the Zephyr. Poorly received by critics and buyers, sales of the model line collapsed (to less than one-third of 1979 levels). Struggling to compete against newer competitors, the aging Bobcat and Monarch were both discontinued at the end of the model year.

1981 saw several model changes, largely in response to falling sales. To replace the Monarch, Mercury introduced a Cougar two-door and four-door sedan as its version of the redesigned Ford Granada; the non-XR7 Cougar was largely a Zephyr with a formal roofline and Marquis-influenced fascias. As in 1977, the rebranding nearly doubled Cougar sales (though far below its previous rate). The first front-wheel drive Mercury, the Mercury Lynx was a version of the Ford Escort &quot;world car&quot;. Offering the first (and only) diesel engine for a Mercury, the Lynx was produced as a three-door and five-door hatchback and as a five-door station wagon. For the first time, Mercury used its &quot;GS&quot; and &quot;LS&quot; trim nomenclature; in various forms, it would be used through the 2011 model year.

In 1982, Mercury introduced the Mercury LN7; the first two-seat Mercury, the LN7 was derived from the Ford EXP. To distinguish the model line, the LN7 was fitted with a compound-curve window for its hatchback. The Zephyr wagon was discontinued, replaced by a Cougar station wagon (last seen in 1977), as Mercury sought to shift the wagon upward in price. In place of the previous 4.2L V8, the Capri RS received the 5.0L V8 of the Mustang GT.

1983 saw a major model revision within Ford and Mercury, involving both full-size and mid-size model lines. The mid-size Fox-platform lines underwent a mid-cycle model revisions (largely to improve exterior aerodynamics), with Cougar sedans and wagons taking on the Marquis nameplate (as the Ford Granada became the LTD); the Grand Marquis became a distinct model line (having become the most popular full-size Mercury since 1979) alongside the Ford LTD Crown Victoria. The Cougar XR7 underwent a complete redesign of the exterior, adopting a far sleeker body than its 1980 predecessor; while the Thunderbird was styled with a fastback roofline, the Cougar received a formal notchback roofline. The Capri underwent a visible change to its rear roofline, as it adopted a compound-curve window for its liftgate (requiring a redesigned rear fascia). Selling far under sales projections (less than 5,000 were sold for 1983), the two-seat LN7 was withdrawn in favor of its Ford counterpart. Buoyed by Cougar sales, Mercury was the fifth-highest selling brand in the United States for 1983 (the highest it would ever finish).

For 1984, Mercury further updated its model range. Replacing the Zephyr, the front-wheel drive Mercury Topaz compact was introduced alongside the Ford Tempo, competing against the GM J-cars introduced for 1982. Sharing chassis underpinnings with the Escort/Lynx (on a longer wheelbase), the Topaz was developed as a sedan. As with the Thunderbird/Cougar, the Tempo/Topaz advanced the use of aerodynamically enhanced exterior design; the 1984 Topaz became the first Lincoln-Mercury vehicle to offer a driver-side airbag (as an option). The new model line also marked the debut of the Mercury &quot;stacked angle&quot; emblem; in various forms, it would be used through the 2011 model year. The change from Zephyr to Topaz proved successful, with all of Mercury selling nearly 500,000 vehicles.

1985 saw few revisions to the Mercury model line, largely in preparation for 1986. For the first time since 1980, the Cougar received a complete redesign of its interior, including an (optional) electronic instrument panel. As a 1985½ model, the Lynx underwent a mid-cycle update, adopting flush headlamps and a black-painted grille (in line with the Topaz). The Marquis (which shared much of its interior with the 1980 Cougar XR-7) underwent minor exterior and badging revisions. Intending to repeat the success of the 1970s Capri, Lincoln-Mercury began sales of the Merkur (see below), a captive import from West Germany aimed at European entry-level luxury cars.

In 1986, Mercury made a substantial change to its mid-size lines, as the Mercury Sable was phased in to replace the Marquis. Along with introducing its first 6-passenger front-wheel drive car, Mercury was replacing its conservative Marquis with one of the most aerodynamic sedans in the world (even sleeker than its Ford Taurus counterpart). Though sharing most of its body with the Taurus (including its doors, roof, hood, and front fenders), the Sable adopted a number of its own visible design elements, with blacked-out C-pillars (for a floating-style roof), vertically slotted taillamps, semi-skirted rear fenders, and the introduction of a low-wattage &quot;lightbar&quot; grille (a design adopted by several Mercury car lines during the late 1980s and early 1990s). Additionally, the Sable served as the design basis of the Taurus/Sable station wagon. To match the Sable, the 1986 Topaz underwent a minor exterior update, receiving composite headlamps and a lightbar grille. The Marquis remained in production through the end of the 1985 calendar year, with Mercury marketing both mid-size lines concurrently.

1987 saw Mercury revise its model lines in a move upmarket. The Cougar underwent an extensive mid-cycle revision (sharing only the doors with the 1986 body); in a break from the Thunderbird Turbo Coupe, the Cougar XR7 was fitted with a standard 5.0L V8 engine. The Capri was discontinued; though more popular than the 1980 XR7, the 1986 model line was outsold nearly 10 to one by the Ford Mustang. The Mercury Tracer was released to replace the Lynx for 1988, becoming the first Mercury assembled outside of North America. The first Mercury since 1960 with no Ford equivalent in North America, the Tracer was derived from the Ford Laser (itself, a variant of the Mazda 323); American production was sourced from Japan and Mexico while Canadian production was imported from Taiwan.

For 1988, Mercury underwent multiple product revisions and updates. For the first time since 1979, the Grand Marquis underwent an externally substantial update (to slightly improve its aerodynamics); the rarely-produced two-door sedan was withdrawn. The Topaz sedan was redesigned, adopting a more &quot;notchback&quot; rear roofline than the Tempo; a grille (initially) replaced the lightbar. The Tracer line was expanded in the United States by the addition of a station wagon.

1989 saw the 50th anniversary of the Mercury division, producing various commemorative editions of the Cougar, Sable, and Grand Marquis. For the third time since 1980, the Cougar underwent a ground-up redesign, with the model line adopting an all-new chassis alongside the Thunderbird (with the notchback roofline returning). Growing significantly in wheelbase (to improve interior room and handling), the Cougar was benchmarked in design against European premium luxury coupes. The Sable saw a minor update (a revision to the bumper and lightbar to aid grille ventilation; the front parking lamps became clear). Far under sales projections, Lincoln-Mercury ended sales of the Merkur brand (see below).

During the 1980s, Mercury had largely succeeded in modernizing its model line and gradually separating its brand identity between Ford and Lincoln. While Mercury was among the last brands to downsize and would have disastrous results downsizing its mid-size model lines (with the 1980-1982 Cougar), Mercury was among the first brands to integrate aerodynamic body design into its model lines and downsized its compact model lines (replacing the Zephyr with the Topaz). In contrast to other American automobile manufacturers, as the 1980s progressed, elements of Mercury design shifted further from divisional (Ford) counterparts. Originally intended for replacement, the Grand Marquis (the most profitable model line) saw little change in contrast to its smaller counterparts.

====Merkur====
For the 1985 model year, Ford chose to revisit the success of the 1970s Mercury Capri, with participating Lincoln-Mercury dealers launching the Merkur brand. Drawing its name from the German word for Mercury, Merkur sold German-produced captive imports designed by Ford of Europe, competing against European executive cars sold in North America from Audi, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Saab, and Volvo (along with the launch of Acura).

The initial Merkur product line included the Merkur XR4Ti sports coupe, a federalized version of the Ford Sierra XR4i (renamed by Ford in deference the GMC Sierra pickup truck). For the 1988 model year, the brand doubled its product range with the introduction of the Merkur Scorpio, sharing nearly its entire specification with the Ford Scorpio flagship sedan of Ford of Europe.

Following the 1989 model year, Ford discontinued the Merkur brand. In addition to the combined model line falling far under sales projections, the cancellation resulted from several additional factors. At the time, the German assembly of the vehicles led to unstable pricing of the vehicles (partially due to an unstable exchange rate between the US dollar and the West German mark at the time). As many examples of the Scorpio sold for over US$26,400 at the time (approximately $ in current dollars), despite its close appearance to the Mercury Sable, the Scorpio bore a price closer to the Lincoln Town Car and the Mark VII of the time. In addition, for the 1990 model year, cars sold in the United States were required to meet updated passive safety regulations, requiring the fitment of airbags or motorized seatbelts; neither the XR4Ti nor the Scorpio were designed with such features nor were they due for a redesign by Ford of Europe). At only five years, Merkur remains one of the shortest-lived brands in the modern American automotive industry.

===1990s===
Following the closure of the Merkur sub-brand after 1989, the Mercury division itself began its own major transformation during the 1990s. While Ford still intended to keep the division as part of the paired Lincoln-Mercury division, distinguishing its model lines from Ford and Lincoln counterparts became increasingly imperative, along with marketing a model line in touch with consumers. During the decade, Mercury would bring to market redesigns of its best-selling model lines and would diversify its product line, expanding into the minivan and SUV segments.

For 1990, in response to passive-restraint regulations, the Sable and Grand Marquis both adopted standard driver-side airbags (requiring a redesign of the dashboards). The Topaz also offered a driver-side airbag as an option (as it had since 1984).

For 1991, the division strengthened its presence in the compact segment through the return of two previously used model nameplates. For the second time, the Mercury Capri made its return, developed as a competitor for the Mazda MX-5. Assembled by Ford of Australia (which sold a Ford-branded version), the revived Capri was a front-wheel drive four-seat convertible mechanically derived from the Mazda 323 (as was the MX-5, though the Capri and MX-5 were unrelated to each other). After skipping the 1990 model year, the Mercury Tracer made its return. While again based on the Mazda 323, the Tracer also now served as a clone of the Ford Escort (with both model lines now becoming near-twins of the Mazda Protegé). Alongside the body and chassis redesign, the Tracer model range underwent revision, now offered as a four-door sedan and five-door station wagon; the Tracer hatchbacks were discontinued (a body style still offered on the Escort). At the larger end of the size scale, the Mercury Cougar regained its V8 engine (dropping the manual transmission). Fundamentally unchanged since its 1979 downsizing redesign, the Colony Park wood-trim station wagon was discontinued after a short 1991 model year, as large station wagons had lost ground to minivans, full-size vans, and large SUVs.

For 1992, Mercury would undergo another extensive update, releasing new generations of its best-selling model lines. Though retaining much of the style from the successful previous generation (and its chassis), the 1992 Sable actually carried over only the doors, roof, and powertrain from its 1991 predecessor. The 1992 Grand Marquis underwent a larger-scale redesign, sharing no body commonality with the previous generation. While the chassis was carried over, it underwent major handling upgrades; its all-new 4.6L V8 was the first overhead-cam V8 engine used in an American-brand car. Far more aerodynamic than its predecessor, the exterior of the Grand Marquis was styled more conservatively than its Ford Crown Victoria counterpart (with the two model lines only sharing front doors). Better-received in the marketplace than the Chevrolet Caprice and Buick Roadmaster (and the Crown Victoria), sales of the Grand Marquis doubled from 1991 to 1992, leading it to become the best-selling Mercury sedan through much of the 1990s and beyond.

Lincoln-Mercury gained its first minivan for 1993, introducing the Mercury Villager (see below). The first front-wheel drive van marketed by Ford Motor Company, the Villager was slotted between the two sizes of Chrysler minivans. With the exception of the Topaz compact and Cougar coupe, the entire Mercury line was renewed between 1991 and 1992, leading for sales to increase to over 480,000 (their highest level since the 1978 all-time high).

1994 saw the end of two long-running Mercury model lines. The Capri was discontinued for the third and final time; along with declining sales, its Mazda donor platform ended production. The Topaz (the oldest Mercury line) was also retired, remaining in production nearly unchanged since 1988 (1984 for the coupe).

For 1995, the Mercury Mystique was introduced to replace the long-running Topaz sedan (the Topaz coupe was not replaced). A counterpart of the Ford Contour, the Mystique was developed from the Ford Mondeo &quot;world car&quot; introduced in 1992. While the Mondeo was developed as a mid-size car in Europe, in North America, the Contour/Mystique fell closer in size to compact-size sedans, leading to negative receptions for small interior dimensions (in comparison to competitive vehicles). The Grand Marquis underwent a mid-cycle revision; along with minor updates to the exterior, the interior was redesigned.

For 1996, the Sable underwent its second redesign. Though again derived from the Ford Taurus, the Sable grew further apart in design from its counterpart (with the two model lines sharing little more externally besides the front doors). The heavily rounded exterior was poorly received by both critics and buyers, leading for sales of the Sable to fall by one-third from 1996 to 2000.

For 1997, Mercury debuted a new generation of the Tracer. Though using the Mazda-designed chassis of the previous generation, the 1997 Tracer sedan adopted an all-new body. In contrast to the Sable, the Tracer differed from its Ford Escort counterpart only through its grille, wheels, and badging. The Mercury Mountaineer mid-size SUV (see below) was introduced as the first Lincoln-Mercury SUV. Following the GM retirement of the Buick Roadmaster and Chevrolet Caprice, sales of the Grand Marquis increased nearly 20 percent over 1996 (as the model line competed largely against the Ford Crown Victoria, itself supported primarily through sales of fleet vehicles). At the end of the model year, the Cougar coupe was retired (alongside its Ford Thunderbird counterpart) as sales of large two-door coupes continued to decline.

For 1998, the Grand Marquis received a second mid-cycle update, restyled with a larger grille and taillamps. In response to the 1992-1997 Grand Marquis receiving a better marketplace reception over its Crown Victoria counterpart, both model lines adopted the formal roofline design used by the Mercury. The Mountaineer underwent a minor revision to its front grille to further differentiate it from the Ford Explorer.

For 1999, the Mercury line saw multiple major product changes. Discontinued the year before, the Cougar (see below) made its return in a far smaller and sportier form; for the first time since 1976, the Cougar was not produced alongside the Thunderbird (which remained discontinued). A second generation of the Villager was released, growing in size over its predecessor; in contrast to the Ford Windstar, a driver-side sliding door was standard equipment. The Tracer and Mystique were discontinued at the end of the model year (the latter was sold under a short run of 2000 production).

==== New market segments ====
For 1993, the Mercury Villager was launched as the first Lincoln-Mercury minivan. Completely different from the Ford Aerostar, the front-wheel drive Villager derived its name used for wood-trim Mercury station wagons. The product of a joint venture with Nissan, the Villager was produced by Ford alongside the Nissan Quest; both model lines derived their chassis and drivetrain from the Nissan Maxima. Sized between the two sizes of Chrysler minivans, the Villager was developed as a competitor for the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Oldsmobile Silhouette. While more successful than its Nissan counterpart, the Villager would later decline in sales, primarily in response to newer competitors (including the Ford Windstar, Honda Odyssey, and redesigns of Chrysler and GM minivans).

For 1997. Mercury introduced its first SUV with the Mercury Mountaineer. A segment once nearly exclusive to the Jeep Grand Wagoneer, the Mountaineer was developed in response to the Oldsmobile Bravada. Sharing its body and chassis with the Ford Explorer (itself derived from the Ford Ranger at the time), the Mountaineer differed from the Explorer in its use of all-wheel drive (rather than four-wheel drive); a V8 engine was standard (initially). In a styling theme adopted on nearly all succeeding Mercury vehicles, the Mountaineer used a silver &quot;waterfall&quot; grille with a large central Mercury emblem.

After skipping the 1998 model year, the Cougar made its return for 1999 under a completely new identity. After serving as a personal luxury car since 1971, the model line was repackaged as a compact sports coupe (originally developed as the third generation of the Ford Probe). The first generation produced with front-wheel drive, the 1999 Cougar adopted the chassis of the Mystique sedan, bodied as a three-door hatchback. Alongside the loss of the V8 engine, the 1999 Cougar was the first version of the model line offered solely as a Mercury (though badged as a Ford Cougar for export markets).

===2000–2011===
At the turn of the 21st century, Mercury began to struggle in keeping its brand image in touch with premium-brand buyers. At the time, its best-selling model line was the Grand Marquis (trading that distinction back and forth with the Sable since 1992). Though its flagship sedan was among the most profitable vehicles of Ford Motor Company, the average age of its buyer was in their mid-60s – nearly two decades higher than what Lincoln-Mercury sought to attract into its showrooms. At the beginning of the decade, Lincoln-Mercury was made part of Premier Automotive Group (PAG), which combined all Ford Motor Company subsidiary brands (outside the namesake Ford brand) under a single organizational structure.

Following the 1999 revival of the Cougar as a sports coupe, Mercury underwent an extensive revision of its model line in the early 2000s. The Tracer and Mystique were discontinued during the 2000 model year; alongside the Villager and Mountaineer, Mercury sold only the Cougar, Sable and Grand Marquis; each vehicle line was marketed to widely different buyers, with no common brand styling.

For 2002, Ford reinstated Lincoln-Mercury as a distinct Ford division, ending its status within the PAG (which concentrated towards European Ford brands). The Mountaineer underwent its first complete redesign; while again a counterpart of the Ford Explorer, the redesign brought substantial functional upgrades. Sharing only its roofline and doors with the Explorer, the 2002 Mountaineer launched a design identity used by Mercury through the end of the 2000s, including a rectangular waterfall grille and clear-lens headlamps extending into the hood; interior chrome was largely replaced by silver and satin trim. For the final time, Mercury retired the Cougar and Villager nameplates.

After the loss of the Cougar from its model lineup, Mercury launched multiple models to expand its line beyond the Sable, Grand Marquis, and Mountaineer. For 2003, the Mercury Marauder made its return (for the first time since 1970) as a high-performance variant of the Grand Marquis, serving as a 2000s rendition of the 1994–1996 Chevrolet Impala SS (as with the Chevrolet, the Marauder was styled with a nearly monochromatic exterior, with most examples produced in black). Alongside the Marauder, the Grand Marquis underwent its largest model update since 1992; while the exterior and interior underwent a modest facelift, the chassis underwent a near-complete redesign to upgrade its road handling and durability. Mercury returned to the minivan segment for 2004, as it replaced the Villager with the Mercury Monterey (a nameplate last seen in 1975), the first Mercury minivan produced by Ford. A counterpart of the Ford Freestar, the Monterey directly challenged the Chrysler Town &amp; Country and Oldsmobile Silhouette (and its Buick Terraza successor) directly in size for the first time; in a segment first, the Monterey introduced heated/cooled front seats.

During the 2005 and 2006 model years, Mercury underwent a near-complete transformation of its model line. For 2005, the Mountaineer was joined by the Mercury Mariner; a counterpart of the Ford Escape and Mazda Tribute, the Mariner was the first Mercury with a four-cylinder engine since the 2002 Cougar. The Mountaineer underwent a redesign for 2006; while largely evolutionary in exterior changes, the new generation was upgraded with many features from the discontinued Lincoln Aviator. The smaller Mariner Hybrid was introduced, serving as the first Mercury hybrid-electric vehicle. The replacement of the Sable after 2005 commenced the launch of two model lines over two years. The 2005 Mercury Montego (dormant since 1976) was the larger of the two, serving as a counterpart of the Ford Five Hundred; while only slightly larger than the Sable, the interior of the Montego more closely matched the Grand Marquis in size (though only offered with 5-passenger seating). The 2006 Mercury Milan was a counterpart of the Ford Fusion, sized closely to the original 1986 Sable. As Mercury did not market a version of the Ford Freestyle, the division no longer offered a station wagon of any kind (for the first time since 1940). In what would be its final exterior revision, the 2006 Grand Marquis underwent its fourth update since 1992 (adopting the rectangular-style grille seen in smaller Mercury vehicles). Though sharing common rooflines with their Ford counterparts, Mercury vehicles had transitioned into a design theme consistent across the entire model line.

After 2007, Mercury ended sales of the Monterey, exiting the minivan segment for the final time. Both the Monterey and its Ford counterpart had struggled to gain market share against more established vehicles in the segment; after 21 years, Ford ended production of minivans in North America.

For 2008, Mercury underwent significant revisions to its full-size sedan line. The Montego underwent a model update, becoming a revived Mercury Sable (alongside the return of the Ford Taurus); the update included a more powerful drivetrain and greater styling distinction from its Ford counterpart. Alongside poor sales of the Montego in the marketplace (outsold by the Grand Marquis nearly five-to-one for 2007), new company management insisted upon a nameplate with greater brand recognition. A second-generation Mariner was released, with Mercury increasing brand-specific exterior and interior design. In contrast to the rest of the Mercury line, the Grand Marquis had outsold its Ford Crown Victoria counterpart for over a decade (with production of the latter supported nearly entirely by fleet sales); after 2007, Ford ended retail sales of the latter model line. During 2008, the Grand Marquis was overtaken in annual sales by the Milan as the best-selling Mercury line (a position held since 1996).

In 2009, Ford began to make the final revisions to the Mercury model line, phasing out nameplates at the end of their model cycles. At the end of the model year, Mercury retired the Sable permanently, as it remained the slowest-selling Mercury sedan by a wide margin; the 2010 Ford Taurus was developed with no Mercury counterpart. The Mountaineer was retired at the end of 2010; along with its status as the slowest-selling Mercury line, the Mountaineer was not included with the release of the 2011 Ford Explorer. For 2010, Mercury released its final model update, releasing a mid-cycle revision for the Milan. Alongside a substantially revised front fascia, a Milan Hybrid was introduced as the first Mercury hybrid sedan.

As part of the announced closure of Mercury in 2010, the division released a model line for a shortened 2011 model year, offering the Mariner, Milan, and Grand Marquis. Regardless of the fate of the brand, the Grand Marquis (last redesigned for 1992) had already been slated for retirement after 2011, as Ford had announced the closure of its St. Thomas Assembly facility that produced the model line (alongside the Crown Victoria, Crown Victoria Police Interceptor, and Lincoln Town Car). After 2011, the model line was no longer legal for sale in North America, as federally-mandated electronic stability control was unable to be integrated with the Ford Panther chassis that had underpinned the model line and its Ford/Lincoln counterparts since 1979. 

==== Discontinuation ====
In 2008, Ford introduced an advertising campaign starring actress Jill Wagner that focused exclusively on attracting female drivers to the Mercury brand in hopes of making it more relevant and profitable (standing in stark contrast to its late 1960s &quot;The Man&#x27;s Car&quot; ad slogan). The campaign was a failure, narrowing the brand image and buyer appeal of the division even deeper, and sales continued to fall.

After 2000, Ford began to phase out its practice of releasing direct Mercury counterparts of its Ford car lines. Following the retirement of the Tracer and Mystique, no version of the Ford Focus was developed as a Mercury. Later on in the decade, Ford did not develop Mercury counterparts of the Ford Freestyle/Taurus X (previewed as the Mercury Meta One concept car), Ford Edge, or the Ford Flex (the latter two would enter production as the Lincoln MKX and MKT, respectively). With the exception of the Grand Marquis (which had largely overtaken and replaced the Crown Victoria in retail markets since 1992, with Ford restricting the latter to fleet sales in 2008), following the 1999 Cougar (which began life as a 1999 Ford Probe), each Mercury sedan/wagon and SUV was developed with a direct Ford divisional counterpart.

On June 2, 2010, Ford announced the closure of the Mercury line effective at the end of 2010; the company intended to concentrate its marketing and engineering efforts on the Ford and Lincoln model lines. In terms of overall sales in North America, the Mercury brand held a 1 percent share (compared to the 16 percent share of Ford). After selling under 93,000 vehicles for 2009, Mercury had sold fewer vehicles than either Oldsmobile or Plymouth prior to their discontinuation.

For its two slowest-selling model lines, Mercury retired the Sable and the Mountaineer after the 2009 and 2010 model years; the two vehicles completed their model cycles without replacement. The Mariner, Milan, and Grand Marquis were produced through the end of 2010 for a shortened 2011 model year.

At the time, Mercury vehicles were sold in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Middle East. For 2010, 93,165 Mercury vehicles were sold, nearly 265,000 fewer than in 2000. As Ford announced the closure of the Mercury brand, signage related to the brand began to disappear from Lincoln-Mercury dealers. To reflect the change completely, in December 2012, Ford renamed the Lincoln Division as the Lincoln Motor Company (its name before World War II).

The final Mercury automobile, a 2011 Grand Marquis, was manufactured by Ford of Canada at St. Thomas Assembly on January 4, 2011. With nearly 2.8 million Marquis built, the longest-produced Mercury model line was second only to the Cougar in overall sales.
 As of 2019, Mercury remains an active, registered trademark of Ford.

====Sales figures====
==Mercury in Canada==

During the middle of the 20th century, the small dealership network of Ford Motor Company in Canada necessitated some branding changes to attract buyers into showrooms. This was especially the case in smaller, rural communities in need of trucks, as these areas were served by either a Ford or a Lincoln-Mercury dealer, but rarely both. Mirroring General Motors in Canada, Monarch competed against Oldsmobile while Meteor competed against Pontiac; Mercury trucks competed against GMC.

Following the demise of Edsel and its effects on the Lincoln-Mercury division as well as the Canada–United States Automotive Products Agreement, Ford largely integrated its model lines across the United States and Canada by the end of the 1960s.

===Mercury 114===

After World War II, Ford of Canada split their dealer network into two divisions. Existing dealers sold Ford and Monarch models whilst the new Mercury-Lincoln dealers sold Mercurys and Lincolns.

The Mercury 114 was introduced in 1946 to give Mercury-Lincoln dealers a lower-priced car to sell. The 114 was essentially a Ford with a Mercury-style grille, taillights and trim. Its name was a reference to its 114-inch Ford wheelbase with the larger Mercury models sold in Canada as the Mercury 118 due to its longer wheelbase.

The 114 was marketed in DeLuxe and Super DeLuxe versions and was offered in Fordor Sedan, Tudor Sedan, and Business Coupe, 6-passenger Sedan Coupe, Convertible and Station Wagon body styles. A Sedan Delivery model was also offered. The 114 was initially powered by a 221 cubic inch Ford V8 engine however after June 1946 it was enlarged to 239.4 cu. in. displacement.

The appearance of the 1947 114 differed from that of the 1946 model in that the chrome strip surrounding the side windows was lacking and the hubcaps were of a different design. There were virtually no changes made for 1948. There was no 114 offered for 1949 however it was succeeded by a similar model, the Meteor.

Production of the 114 totaled 4,573 for the 1946 calendar year, 10,393 for 1947 and 2,716 for 1948.

===Monarch===
From 1946 to 1957, to attract buyers of medium-price vehicles, Ford of Canada marketed the Monarch brand in their dealership network. Using much of the body and trim of the Mercury, Monarch was a three-model line with the Richelieu, Lucerne and Sceptre matching the Mercury Monterey, Montclair, and Park Lane, respectively. It was sold at Ford dealerships, offering an upgraded car from the standard Ford line.

Ford of Canada replaced Monarch with the Edsel brand for 1958; a poor reception to Edsel in Canada led to the return of Monarch for 1959. The same year, the Ford Galaxie was introduced, shifting the Ford brand upward in price and content; fearing brand overlap with the Galaxie, Ford of Canada ended the Monarch brand after the 1961 model year.

In 1975, the Monarch nameplate would again become associated with Mercury (in both the United States and Canada), becoming the counterpart of the Ford Granada.

===Meteor===
From 1949 to 1976, Lincoln-Mercury of Canada marketed the Meteor nameplate as its lowest-price brand to compete in lower-price markets (most closely against Pontiac). In contrast to the Monarch which utilised a Mercury body, the early Meteor models combined a Ford body with a Mercury grille and trim. The brand was marketed as a four-model counterpart of the Ford line (Meteor, Niagara, and Rideau; the Montcalm was added in 1959 to match the Galaxie).

For 1962 and 1963, Lincoln-Mercury of Canada dropped the Meteor brand, coinciding with the introduction of the namesake Mercury product line and as Mercury distanced itself from Lincoln in price at the beginning of the 1960s. In 1964, Meteor was revived in Canada (replacing the Mercury Monterey in the same market). Unlike previous Meteors, the 1964 model used a Mercury body rather than a Ford body. For 1965, Meteors used revived Rideau and Montcalm model names on Mercury bodies with Ford-style roofs. For 1967, its equivalent of the LTD was named the Montego, renamed the LeMoyne for 1968 (as Mercury themselves adopted the Montego name).

In 1968, Lincoln-Mercury of Canada added Mercury badging to Meteor vehicles, gradually beginning to integrate Meteor into its model line. After 1976, the Rideau and Montcalm were discontinued, combined as a base Meteor trim level for the Mercury Marquis in Canada; Lincoln-Mercury of Canada dropped the Marquis Meteor after the 1981 model year.

===Trucks===
To increase the availability of its truck lineup in Canada, Ford introduced Mercury-badged trucks in Lincoln-Mercury dealerships in 1946. Initially rebadging the Ford F-Series light trucks as the Mercury M-series, the product range was expanded to include Mercury-badged versions of the medium-duty Ford F-series (and its school bus chassis variant), the C-Series COE truck, and a Mercury version of the Econoline. Sharing nearly identical bodywork with Ford trucks, Mercury-badged trucks were largely distinguished by a division-specific grille and exterior trim and badging.

Sold only in Canada, Ford ended sales of Mercury-badged trucks after 1968 (sales of the Mercury version of the C-Series COE continued through 1972); during the 1960s, the M-series shifted closer in appearance to its Ford counterpart. Following the withdrawal of the M-series, Mercury permanently ended pickup truck production, not marketing another light truck until the 1993 Villager minivan.

==Brand identity==
=== Logo ===
The first logo of the Mercury brand was its namesake, the Roman god Mercury. Towards the early years of the brand, Mercury used its Roman namesake in a silhouette profile (with signature bowl hat with wings, as shown in the image). This logo was briefly revived for 2003–2004, used in the alloy wheel centers of the Mercury Marauder.

In the mid-1950s, Mercury introduced &quot;The Big M&quot;, the namesake letter with horizontal extensions at its bottom; at the time, Mercury was a prime sponsor of &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show.&quot; After 1959, the &quot;Big M&quot; was replaced by a crest emblem. In various forms, Mercury would use a crest emblem on its vehicles through the end of the 1980s. While upper-trim models (such as the Grand Monarch Ghia or Marquis) would feature a crest on the hood or grille, lower-trim models (such as the Monterey or Montego) featured a crest in places such as the wheels. For a time, the Marquis (later Grand Marquis) used a modified version of the Lincoln star emblem.

Following the 1967 introduction of the Mercury Cougar, the branding of Mercury vehicles changed; similar to the Ford Mustang pony emblem, the Cougar adopted its own &quot;prowling cat&quot; logo. During the 1970s, the Cougar became the most popular Mercury vehicle, with a &quot;Sign of the Cat&quot; advertising campaign launched by the division; commercials for all Mercury vehicles during this era ended with a shot of a growling cougar seated atop a Lincoln-Mercury sign (like the then-current outdoor signage at the dealerships, which also featured the Ford &quot;blue oval&quot; logo) and the voiceover announcer intoning &quot;at the sign of the cat&quot;. For 1977, the Cougar logo was revised from a &quot;prowling cat&quot; to a &quot;cat-head&quot; emblem, later adapted by the Mercury Lynx, Mercury LN7 and the Mercury Capri.

In 1984, Mercury introduced what would become its final brand emblem (pictured in the article information box). Centered in the grille, the silver Mercury emblem is a set of three stacked obtuse angles (also in silver). Introduced with the Mercury Topaz, the emblem was adopted by the Lynx and Sable, with the Grand Marquis/Colony Park adopting it in 1988 (on hood ornaments and wheels). In 1999, the emblem saw a minor revision, with the word &quot;Mercury&quot; added to the top half of the emblem. The emblem became the final design featured for a hood ornament of an American-brand automobile, offered as an option for the Grand Marquis for 2005 (for a single year).

=== Grille design ===
The Mercury styling of the brand is most commonly associated with a waterfall-style grille. First making an appearance in the 1946 Mercury Eight, the design was revived in the 1961–1964 Monterey/Colony Park. The design would reappear in the debut of the Mercury Cougar, as designers sought to differentiate the model from the Ford Mustang. During the 1970s, the vertical waterfall grille design was adapted by nearly all Mercury vehicles (except for the Capri and Comet).

In 1986, as part of the introduction of the Mercury Sable and a revision of the Mercury Topaz, the division introduced a &quot;lightbar&quot; front grille. Using low-power light bulbs, the grille between the headlights was illuminated. By 1992, the feature was adapted by all Mercury vehicles (except for the Cougar and Grand Marquis).

In 1997, as part of the introduction of the Mercury Mountaineer SUV, Mercury reintroduced the chrome vertical &quot;waterfall&quot; grille. In place of the radiator-style grille of Lincoln, several grille shapes were initially used, before the division adapted a rectangular grille opening in the mid-2000s.

=== &quot;Breezeway&quot; roof ===
In 1957, Mercury introduced the Mercury Turnpike Cruiser, featuring a roofline with a retractable rear window. From 1958 to 1960, the feature made its return on the Continental Mark-series line, with a reverse-slant rear window (on both hardtops and convertibles). For 1963, Mercury reintroduced the feature as an option for the Monterey; to streamline production, elements of the window design were shared with Ford station wagons. From 1963 to 1966, the optional reverse-slant roofline with retracting rear window was unique to Mercury, featured by no other American brand.

=== Branding ===
Following the replacement of the Mercury Eight by the Mercury Monterey in 1952, the division adopted a nameplate nomenclature for its model lines. For the next six decades, the later Montclair, Medalist, Meteor, Marauder, Montego, (Grand) Marquis, Monarch, Mystique, Mountaineer, Milan, and Mariner all used nameplates starting with &quot;&quot;M&quot;.&quot; Beginning the 1967 debut of the Mercury Cougar, several nameplates were derived from big cats, including the Bobcat and Lynx (with the Sable also adopting an animal name).

Mercury woodgrain-trim station wagons used the &quot;Villager&quot; nameplate, in line with the Ford &quot;Squire&quot; name. Reviving a nameplate used by Edsel wagons, Mercury used the nameplate for all station wagons from the 1960s to the 1980s (except for the Colony Park). After becoming dormant in the early 1980s, the Villager name returned in 1993 (as the Mercury Villager minivan).

From the 1980s to the 2000s, Mercury adopted a common trim nomenclature across its model lines, with &quot;GS&quot; standing for a base-trim model and &quot;LS&quot; as a high-trim version. For performance-oriented trims, XR was used (Cougar XR7, Topaz XR5, and Capri XR3). From the mid to late-2000s, Mercury shifted its trim nomenclature in line with Lincoln, with full words replacing letter-based designations.

While the introduction of &quot;F&quot; nameplates by Ford was met with controversy in the mid-2000s, the reaction to &quot;M&quot; nameplates by Mercury for its product range was much less extreme. Before the 1980s, the division had used the practice for many of its product lines; several recognized nameplates were revived by the brand (Marauder, Montego, Monterey). While the Milan was outsold by its Ford Fusion counterpart (by a significant margin), the product line met with relative success, overtaking the Grand Marquis as the best-selling Mercury sedan in 2008. The Montego struggled to gain market share against competitive sedans, partly due to model overlap with the Grand Marquis (in contrast, Ford had long ended marketing for the Crown Victoria and ended retail of the model line after 2007).

<text>Callistephus is a monotypic genus of flowering plants in the aster family, Asteraceae, containing the single species Callistephus chinensis. Its common names include China aster and annual aster. It is native to China and Korea. and it is cultivated worldwide as an ornamental plant in cottage gardens and as a cut flower.

==Description==
This is an annual or biennial plant with one erect, mostly unbranched stem growing tall. The alternately arranged leaves vary in shape or size. The basal leaves usually fall away before flowering. Leaves around the middle of the stem are a few centimeters long and are borne on winged petioles. The blades have serrated edges. Leaves toward the top may have smooth edges. The large solitary flower head grows at the top of the stem and sometimes on branches. The head is lined with layers of phyllaries, those in the outer layer large and leaflike, measuring up to 3 centimeters long. The inner layer can be purple-tinged. The head contains one or two rings of ray florets, most often in shades of reddish purple. The flowering period is from August to October in the northern hemisphere.

==Cultivation==
This species has been grown and bred extensively in cultivation. Cultivars are available with flowers of many colors, varying heights, and single and double heads. In the wild, they are purple in color. There are several cultivars with flowers of different colors. Cultivars with flowers of other colors were obtained in particular by hybridization. Cultivated varieties can have ray florets in most any color, including red, pink, blue, purple, and white. They are up to 3.5 centimeters long. There are many yellow disc florets in the center. The fruit is a rough-textured, glandular, purple-mottled cypsela that turns gray with age. It has a pappus composed of one outer layer of reddish scales and two inner layers of white bristles.

It has been in cultivation in Europe since 1728 at the latest. In China, it has been cultivated for 2000 years.

==Distribution==
This plant is a naturalized species in some areas outside of its native range (Indochina, Europe, North America, Australia, New Zealand, etc.) and can be found on the edges of deciduous forests. It grows at altitudes from 300 to 2700 above mean sea level. As an ornamental plant it thrives on fresh, nutrient-rich, easy-humus rich soils in warm humid air conditioning.

==Pests and diseases==
The plants are susceptible to fusarium wilt, a fungal disease. Some cultivars are more resistant to this than others. Pest insects can include leafhoppers, aphids, blister beetles, and the tarnished plant bug. The plant is also susceptible to mites.

<doc id="256343" wikidata="Q7090846" url="?curid=256343" title="On-to-Ottawa Trek">
<text>The On-to-Ottawa Trek was a mass protest movement in Canada in 1935 sparked by unrest among unemployed single men in federal relief camps principally in Western Canada. The trek started in Vancouver and, picking up reinforcements along the way, was conducted by riding traincars eastward. The trek was stopped in Regina where on July 1, 1935, police dispersed it with loss of life and mass arrests.

Federal relief camps were brought in under Prime Minister R. B. Bennett&#x27;s government as a result of the Great Depression. The Great Depression crippled the Canadian economy and left one in nine citizens on relief. The relief, however, did not come free; the Bennett government ordered the Department of National Defence to organize work camps where single unemployed men were used to construct roads and other public works at a rate of twenty cents per day. The men in the relief camps were living in poor conditions with very low wages. The men decided to unite in 1933, led by Arthur &quot;Slim&quot; Evans, an officer of the Workers&#x27; Unity League (WUL). The Workers&#x27; Unity League helped the men organize the Relief Camp Workers&#x27; Union.

A strike was held in December 1934 with the men leaving the various camps and protesting in Vancouver, British Columbia. After a two-month protest, they returned to the camps after a promise of a government commission to look into their complaints. When a commission was not appointed a second strike was approved by the members and a walkout was called on April 4, 1935.

About 1,000 strikers headed for Ottawa. The strikers&#x27; demands were: 
“(1) that work with wages be instituted at a minimum of 50cents per hour for unskilled workers and trade union rates for skilled labour on the basis of a six-hour day, a five-day week with a minimum of twenty work days per month; 
(2) that all workers in the camps be covered by the Workmen&#x27;s Compensation Act and that adequate first aid supplies be carried on the jobs at all times; 
(3) that the National Defence and all military control with the system of blacklisting be abolished; 
(4) that democratically elected committees be recognized in every camp; 
(5) that there be instituted a system of noncontributory unemployment insurance; 
(6) that all workers be given their democratic right to vote; 
(7) that Section 98 of the Criminal Code, Sections 41 and 42 of the Immigration Act and all vagrancy laws and anti-working class laws be repealed”. 

Public support for the men was enormous, but the municipal, provincial and federal governments passed responsibility between themselves. They then decided to take their grievances to the federal government. On June 3, 1935, hundreds of men began boarding boxcars headed east in what became known as the &quot;On-to-Ottawa Trek&quot;.

==Meeting in Ottawa==
The protesters reached Regina, Saskatchewan, on June 14. Three days later, on June 17, the protesters met with two federal cabinet ministers in the government of Prime Minister R. B. Bennett, Robert Manion and Robert Weir. Robert Manion and Robert Weir invited eight elected representatives of the protest (with Arthur &quot;Slim&quot; Evans as their leader) to Ottawa to meet Bennett on the condition the rest of the protesters stay in Regina, where a large contingent of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police was located. The remaining trekkers continued remain in the stadium located on Regina Exhibition Grounds, &quot;with food and shelter supplied by townspeople and the Saskatchewan government.&quot;

The June 22nd Ottawa meeting turned into a shouting match, with Bennett accusing Trek leader Arthur &quot;Slim&quot; Evans of being an &quot;embezzler.&quot; Evans, in turn, called the Prime Minister &quot;a liar&quot; before the delegation was finally escorted out of the building and on to the street.

==Regina riot==


The eight delegates arrived back in Regina on June 26. Attempts of the Trekkers to travel east by car or truck or train were thwarted by RCMP. A public meeting was called for July 1, 1935, in Market Square in Germantown (now the site of the Regina City Police station) to update the public on the progress of the movement. It was attended by 1,500 to 2,000 people, of whom only 300 were Trekkers. Most Trekkers decided to stay at the exhibition grounds in Saskatchewan.

Three large moving trucks were parked on three sides of the square concealing RCMP riot squads. Regina police were in the garage of the police station which was in Market Square. At 8:17 p.m. a whistle was blown, and the police charged the crowd with batons from all four sides. The attack caught the people off guard before their anger took over. They fought back with sticks, stones, and anything at hand. Mounted RCMP officers then started to use tear gas and fired guns. Driven from the Square, and with the RCMP blocking the roadway back to the Stadium grounds, the battle continued in the surrounding streets for six hours.

Police fired revolvers above and into groups of people. Tear gas bombs were thrown at any groups that gathered together. Plate glass windows in stores and offices were smashed, but with one exception, these stores were not looted, they were burned. People covered their faces with wet handkerchiefs to counter the effects of the tear gas and barricaded streets with cars. Finally, the Trekkers who had attended the meeting made their way individually or in small groups back to the exhibition stadium where the main body of Trekkers were quartered.

When it was over, 140 Trekkers and citizens had been arrested. Charles Miller, a plainclothes policeman, died, and Nick Schaack, a Trekker, later died in the hospital from injuries sustained in the riot. There were hundreds of injured residents and Trekkers were taken to hospitals or private homes. Those taken to a hospital were also arrested. Property damage was considerable. The police claimed 39 injuries in addition to the dead police officer, but denied that any protesters had been killed in the melee; the hospital records were subsequently altered to conceal the actual cause of death.

Trekkers Arthur Evans and George Black who were on the speakers&#x27; platform were arrested by plainclothes police at the beginning of the melee.

The city&#x27;s exhibition grounds were surrounded by constables armed with revolvers as well as automatic fire-arms. The next day a barbed wire stockade was erected around the area. News of the police-instigated riot was front-page news across Canada. About midnight one of the Trek leaders telephoned Saskatchewan Premier Gardiner, who agreed to meet their delegation the next morning. The RCMP were livid when they heard of this and apprehended the delegates for interrogation but eventually released them in time to see the premier.

Premier Gardiner sent a wire to the Prime Minister, accusing the police of &quot;precipitating a riot&quot; while he had been negotiating a settlement with the Trekkers. He also told the prime minister the &quot;men should be fed where they are and sent back to camp and homes as they request&quot; and stated his government was prepared to &quot;undertake this work of disbanding the men.&quot; An agreement to this effect was subsequently negotiated. Bennett was satisfied that he had smashed what he believed was a communist revolt and Gardiner was glad to rid his province of the strikers.

The Federal Minister of Justice Hugh Guthrie made the false statement in the House of Commons on July 2 that &quot;shots were fired by the strikers, and the fire was replied to with shots from the city police.&quot; During the lengthy trials that followed, no evidence was ever produced to show that strikers fired shots during the riot. For his part, Bennett characterized the On-to-Ottawa Trek as &quot;not a mere uprising against law and order but a definite revolutionary effort on the part of a group of men to usurp authority and destroy government.&quot;

==Effects==
The Bennett government swiftly came into action regarding &quot;the prosecution of the trek leaders and those who had been charged with rioting and assault.&quot; The events helped to discredit Bennett&#x27;s Conservative government, and in the 1935 federal election, his party went from holding 135 seats to just 39. After the Trek, the Saskatchewan government provided free transportation as a peace sign back to the west. The camps were soon dismantled and replaced by seasonal relief camps run by the provinces, and that paid the men slightly more for their labor than the earlier camps. Even these camps were soon closed down. Although the Trek did not reach Ottawa, its reverberations certainly did. Several demands of the Trekkers were eventually met, and the public support that galvanized behind the Trek set the tone for the social and welfare provisions of the postwar era.

<text>Sir Trevor Lawson McDonald (born George McDonald; 16 August 1939) is a Trinidadian-British newsreader and journalist, best known for his career as a news presenter with Independent Television News (ITN).

McDonald began his career working as a print and broadcast journalist for Naparima College&#x27;s Blue Circle Network. He began his professional career with Radio Trinidad as a reporter and worked as a news reader and sports journalist for Trinidad Television. McDonald was employed by BBC Radio in 1969 as a producer, based in London but still broadcasting to the Caribbean. In 1973, he began his long association with ITN as a general reporter and was also ITN&#x27;s first black reporter. McDonald was promoted in 1992 as the sole presenter of &quot;News at Ten&quot; and became a well-known face on British television screens. He was the presenter of the current affairs programme &quot;Tonight with Trevor McDonald&quot; and a series of documentaries for ITV.

McDonald was knighted in 1999 for his services to journalism and was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Greater London in 2006. He is a recipient of the National Television Award for Special Recognition and the BAFTA Fellowship.

==Career==
===Early career===
Trevor McDonald was born to a working-class family on 16 August 1939 in San Fernando, Trinidad, an island in the West Indies that was a British colony at the time. He is the son of Josephine and Lawson McDonald, a self-taught engineer from Grenada who moved to Trinidad to work on an oil refinery. McDonald is of Dougla heritage, his mother being of African descent and his father being of Indian descent. He grew up in a poor household in the fishing village of St. Margaret in the south of Trinidad, and is the oldest of four children in his family. McDonald did not receive much of an education at school, going against his parents&#x27; wishes, but they ensured his English was of high standard by learning the speech of the announcers working at the BBC World Service. His father supplemented the small income by mending shoes and keeping pigs in his spare time to fund the family&#x27;s education.

Although his mother wanted him to become a lawyer, he began working in broadcasting through Naparima College&#x27;s Blue Circle Network in San Fernando. McDonald&#x27;s professional work started when he was a radio reporter for Radio Trinidad, news presenter and sports journalist for Trinidad Television as well as newspapers and radio in the early 1960s. He became a producer for both the BBC World Service and the BBC Caribbean Service in 1962. In 1969, McDonald moved to London and was employed by the BBC World Service as a producer at Bush House, but still broadcast to the Caribbean.

Finding he was slow-moving at progressing and eager to advance his career, in 1973, he was employed by Independent Television News (ITN) editor Nigel Ryan to work at the news organisation as a general reporter and was also ITN&#x27;s first black reporter. Aware of this fact, he requested that, as part of his employment with ITN, that he was not &quot;to do token black stories&quot; in Brixton. McDonald had been approached by BBC Television after they claimed they heard of his work in television in Trinidad. He was told the corporation was under pressure from the Race Relations Board to employ more black reporters but declined because he wanted to be employed on merit and not because of his race. McDonald worked as a Northern Ireland correspondent reporting on The Troubles, and later became a sports correspondent from 1978 to 1980, reporting on events such as the 1978 FIFA World Cup matches involving Scotland.

He ultimately concentrated on international politics between January 1980 and 1982 as diplomatic correspondent and newsreader. This came after Ryan suggested that McDonald &quot;be like Sandy Gall&quot; and travel the world as a reporter, combining that role with reading the news on occasion. From 1982 to 1987 he was employed as a diplomatic correspondent and newsreader of the ITN-produced &quot;Channel 4 News&quot; evening bulletin, but returned to ITV in early 1989, presenting the &quot;Early Evening News&quot; and rotated that bulletin along with the weekend news duties with Fiona Armstrong. He conducted the first interview with Nelson Mandela after his release from prison and interviewed Saddam Hussein just after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait.

===&quot;News at Ten&quot;===
McDonald was promoted on 9 November 1992 as the main presenter of &quot;News at Ten&quot; when the bulletin was revamped from its two-presenter format to a one-newsreader format after market research determined that audiences preferred him over younger colleagues. He became a well-known face on British television screens as a result. McDonald remained with ITN when &quot;News at Ten&quot; was axed by ITV on 5 March 1999 in order to broadcast more films and drama. He went on to present the new &quot;ITV Evening News&quot; from 1999 to 2001. &quot;News at Ten&quot; was briefly relaunched for three nights a week on 22 January 2001, to which McDonald returned as a presenter. He presented the &quot;ITV News at 10.30&quot; following &quot;News at Ten&quot;″s second axing in January 2004.

===&quot;Tonight&quot;===

From 1999 to 2007, McDonald hosted ITV&#x27;s flagship current affairs magazine programme &quot;Tonight with Trevor McDonald&quot; that was named after him. The show was revived in 2010 with presenter Julie Etchingham.

===First retirement===

McDonald presented his last &quot;ITV News&quot; bulletin on 15 December 2005. He stepped down from his role as anchor after more than 30 years at ITN, but said he had no plans to retire completely from television. McDonald told his ITN colleagues that he wanted a low-key departure after having observed the departures of Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather in the United States. At the end of the final programme, he signed off with the words:

===Return to &quot;News at Ten&quot;===

On 31 October 2007, ITV announced that, early in 2008, McDonald would come out of retirement to present the relaunched &quot;News at Ten&quot; together with Etchingham after being asked.

===Second retirement===

It was announced on 30 October 2008 that McDonald would step down from &quot;News at Ten&quot; once the 2008 United States presidential election was over, to be replaced by Mark Austin. His last bulletin was on 20 November 2008. It was reported at the time that he would continue to present links for &quot;Tonight&quot;.

McDonald has presented a series of documentaries for ITV. In 2009, McDonald travelled to the Caribbean for the three-part series &quot;The Secret Caribbean with Trevor McDonald&quot;. Two years later, McDonald travelled around the Mediterranean for the four-part series &quot;The Secret Mediterranean with Trevor McDonald&quot;. and along the route of the Mississippi River for the three-part series &quot;The Mighty Mississippi with Trevor McDonald&quot; in 2012&quot;.&quot;

McDonald performed live in Hyde Park in June 1996 with the Who, as the newsreader in the group&#x27;s staging of their rock opera, &quot;Quadrophenia&quot;. In 1997, he was made chairman of the Better English Campaign steering group to encourage the improved use of English in both verbal and written communication in school, and assisted in the launch of its campaign Better English, Better Job to help school leavers improve their communication skills, job applications and practising job interviews with employers. McDonald was the presenter of the Classic Brit Awards in 2000. Five years later, he was appointed an honorary vice president of Vision Aid Overseas. McDonald has appeared in advertising campaigns for Vision Express and McVitie&#x27;s.

In June 2007, McDonald hosted the new ITV version of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;, Simon Cowell being the programme&#x27;s &quot;victim&quot;. From June to August 2007, McDonald presented the satirical panel show &quot;News Knight with Sir Trevor McDonald&quot; on ITV1. In August 2010, McDonald conducted a live on-stage interview with Archbishop Desmond Tutu at Fairfield Halls in Croydon at an event entitled &quot;An Audience with Desmond Tutu&quot;.

In 2014, McDonald presented a media training course entitled &quot;Deal with the Media with Sir Trevor McDonald&quot;.

In March 2024, McDonald was the walking partner in the second episode of &quot;Perfect Pub Walks with Bill Bailey&quot;.

In June 2024, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that McDonald had been featured in an advertisement to promote the planned UK government sale of shares in NatWest to the public (which had been announced in the March budget). Because one of McDonald&#x27;s conditions was that he did not want to directly tell people to buy shares, the strapline for the advert was &quot;Are you in?&quot;. The campaign had to be suspended after the announcement of the 2024 general election.

<text>In Modern English, we is a plural, first-person pronoun.

== Morphology == 
In Standard Modern English, &quot;we&quot; has six distinct shapes for five word forms:

* &quot;we&quot;: the nominative (subjective) form
* &quot;us&quot; and &quot;&quot;: the accusative (objective; also called the &#x27;oblique&#x27;.) form
* &quot;our:&quot; the dependent genitive (possessive) form
*&quot;ours:&quot; the independent genitive (possessive) form
* &quot;ourselves&quot;: the reflexive form
There is also a distinct determiner &quot;we&quot; as in &quot;we humans aren&#x27;t perfect&quot;, which some people consider to be just an extended use of the pronoun.

==History==
&quot;We&quot; has been part of English since Old English, having come from Proto-Germanic *&quot;wejes&quot;, from PIE *&quot;we&quot;-. Similarly, &quot;us&quot; was used in Old English as the accusative and dative plural of &quot;we&quot;, from PIE *&quot;nes&quot;-. The following table shows the old English first-person plural and dual pronouns:

By late Middle English, the dual form was lost, and the dative and accusative had merged. The &quot;ours&quot; genitive can be seen as early as the 12th century. &quot;Ourselves&quot; replaced original construction &quot;we selfe&quot;, &quot;us selfum&quot; in the 15th century, so that, by the century&#x27;s end, the Middle English forms of &quot;we&quot; had solidified into those we use today.

== Gender ==
&quot;We&quot; is not generally seen as participating in the system of gender. In Old English, it did not. Only third-person pronouns had distinct masculine, feminine, and neuter gender forms. But by the 17th century, that old gender system, which also marked gender on common nouns and adjectives, had disappeared, leaving only pronoun marking. At the same time, a new relative pronoun system was developing that eventually split between personal relative &quot;who&quot; and impersonal relative &quot;which&quot;. This is seen as a new personal / non-personal (or impersonal) gender system. As a result, 

== Syntax ==

=== Functions ===
&quot;We&quot; can appear as a subject, object, determiner or predicative complement. The reflexive form also appears as an adjunct.

* Subject: &quot;We&#x27;re there; us being there; our being there; we planned for ourselves to be there.&quot;
* Object: &quot;They saw us&quot;; &quot;She pointed them to us; We thought about ourselves.&quot;
* Predicative complement: &quot;They have become us&quot;; &quot;We eventually felt we had become ourselves.&quot;
* Dependent determiner: &quot;We reached our goals&quot;; &quot;We humans aren&#x27;t perfect&quot;; &quot;Give it to us students&quot;.
* Independent determiner: &quot;This is ours.&quot;
* Adjunct: &quot;We did it ourselves.&quot;

The contracted object form &quot;&quot; is only possible after the special &quot;let&quot; of &quot;let&#x27;s do that&quot;.

=== Dependents ===
Pronouns rarely take dependents, but it is possible for &quot;we&quot; to have many of the same kind of dependents as other noun phrases.

* Relative clause modifier: &quot;we who arrived late&quot;
* Determiner: &quot;Not a lot of people know the real us.&quot;
* Adjective phrase modifier: &quot;Not a lot of people know the real us&quot;.
* Adverb phrase external modifier: &quot;not even us&quot;

== Semantics ==
&quot;We&quot; referents generally must include the speaker, along with other persons. A few exceptional cases, which include nosism, are presented below. &quot;We&quot; is always definite and specific.

=== Royal &quot;we&quot; ===

The royal &quot;we&quot;, or majestic plural (&quot;pluralis majestatis&quot;), is sometimes used by a person of high office, such as a monarch, earl, or pope. It has singular semantics.

=== Editorial &quot;we&quot; ===
The editorial &quot;we&quot; is a similar phenomenon, in which an editorial columnist in a newspaper or a similar commentator in another medium refers to themselves as &quot;we&quot; when giving their opinion. Here, the writer casts themselves as spokesperson: either for the media institution who employs them or on behalf of the party or body of citizens who agree with the commentary. The reference is not explicit but is generally consistent with a first-person plural.

=== Author&#x27;s &quot;we&quot; ===
The author&#x27;s &quot;we&quot;, or &quot;pluralism modesties&quot;, is a practice referring to a generic third person as &quot;we&quot; (instead of &quot;one&quot; or the informal &quot;you&quot;):
*&quot; By adding four and five, we obtain nine.&quot;
*&quot; We are led also to a definition of &quot;time&quot; in physics.&quot; — Albert Einstein

&quot;We&quot; in this sense often refers to &quot;the reader and the author&quot; because the author often assumes that the reader knows and agrees with certain principles or previous theorems for the sake of brevity (or, if not, the reader is prompted to look them up). This practice is discouraged by some academic style guides because it fails to distinguish between sole authorship and co-authorship. Again, the reference is not explicit, but is generally consistent with first-person plural.

=== Inclusive and exclusive &quot;we&quot; ===

Some languages distinguish between inclusive &quot;we&quot;, which includes both the speaker and the addressee(s), and exclusive &quot;we&quot;, which excludes the addressee(s). English does not make this distinction grammatically, though &quot;we&quot; can have both inclusive and exclusive semantics.

Imperative &quot;let&#x27;s&quot; or &quot;let us&quot; allows imperatives to be inclusive. Compare:

* &quot;Take this outside&quot;. (exclusive, 2nd person)
* &quot;Let&#x27;s take this outside.&quot; (inclusive, 1st person)

=== Second-person &quot;we&quot; ===

&quot;We&quot; is used sometimes in place of &quot;you&quot; to address a second party: A doctor may ask a patient: &quot;And how are we feeling today?&quot;. A waiter may ask a client: &quot;What are we in the mood for?&quot;

=== Membership &quot;we&quot; ===

The membership &quot;we&quot; is a simultaneous reference to the individual, and to the collective of which the individual is a member. If ants or hive bees could use English, they might use the pronoun &quot;we&quot; almost exclusively. Human cultures can be categorized as communal or individualist; the membership &quot;we&quot; aligns more with a communal culture. The speaker, or thinker, expresses ideas with awareness of both themselves and the collective of other members. If language constrains or liberates thinking, then using the membership &quot;we&quot; may impact our ability to understand, empathize, and bond with others. The extent of inclusion when using the membership &quot;we&quot; is loosely definite; the group may be others of the same village, nation, species, or planet. The following two examples show how meaning changes subtly depending on whether &quot;I&quot; or &quot;we&quot; is used. When using the membership &quot;we&quot;, the reader or speaker is automatically drawn into the collective, and the change in viewpoint is significant:
*&quot;If I consume too much, I will run out of resources.&quot; &quot;If we consume too much, we will run out of resources.&quot;
*&quot;The more I learn, the more I should question.&quot; &quot;The more we learn, the more we should question.&quot;

<doc id="256350" wikidata="Q7101048" url="?curid=256350" title="2003 Oregon Ballot Measure 28">
<text>Measure 28 was a ballot measure, referred by the legislature of the U.S. state of Oregon in 2003. It would have created a temporary one-percent increase in Oregon&#x27;s income tax. The tax was proposed as a way to overcome deficits to the state budget. The measure was defeated in the January 28, 2003 special election with 575,846 votes in favor, 676,312 votes against.

Budget problems, caused by minorities, high unemployment, and problems with Oregon&#x27;s public pension system, dominated Oregon&#x27;s 2002–2003 biennium. To make up for lost revenue, the legislature approved a mixture of budget cuts and referred Measure 28 to a vote of the people. The referral was marred by controversy as Democratic governor John Kitzhaber objected to the Republican-controlled legislature&#x27;s omission of the cuts that would result from the measure&#x27;s failure in the ballot title (the summary of the measure provided to voters). Supporters of the measure blamed the ballot title omission for the defeat of the measure.

Proponents of the measure felt it was the only way to avoid proposed spending cuts to programs such as education and help for the elderly and mentally ill. Opponents, many part of the Oregon tax revolt, felt that increasing taxes would prolong the recession, and that the state should live within its means.

Cuts in the wake of Measure 28&#x27;s defeat seemed to vindicate proponents&#x27; arguments. The day after Measure 28&#x27;s defeat, Multnomah County released 144 inmates from the county jail and laid off 175 Sheriff&#x27;s deputies. Some fiscal conservatives felt that wasteful spending was more to blame than the tax defeat.

Nonetheless, the high percentage of &quot;yes&quot; votes in the Portland metro area inspired local governments in that region to bring their own temporary tax increases to the ballot.

A year later, voters defeated a similar measure, Measure 30.

<doc id="256354" wikidata="Q268418" url="?curid=256354" title="IBM System/34">
<text>The IBM System/34 was an IBM midrange computer introduced in 1977. It was withdrawn from marketing in February 1985. It was a multi-user, multi-tasking successor to the single-user System/32. It included two processors, one based on the System/32 and the second based on the System/3. Like the System/32 and the System/3, the System/34 was primarily programmed in the RPG II language.

==Hardware==
The 5340 System Unit contained the processing unit, the disk storage and the diskette drive. It had several access doors on both sides. Inside, were swing-out assemblies where the circuit boards and memory cards were mounted. It weighed and used 220V power. The IBM 5250 series of terminals were the primary interface to the System/34.

===Processors===
S/34s had two processors, the Control Storage Processor (CSP), and the Main Storage Processor (MSP). The MSP was the workhorse, based on System/3 architecture; it performed the instructions in the computer programs. The CSP was the governor, a different processor with different RISC-like instruction set, based on System/32 architecture; it performed system functions in the background. The CSP also executed the optional &quot;Scientific Macroinstructions&quot;, which were a set of emulated floating point operations used by the System/34 Fortran compiler and optionally in assembly code. The clock speed of the CPUs inside a System/34 was fixed at 1 MHz for the MSP and 4 MHz for the CSP. Special utility programs were able to make direct calls to the CSP to perform certain functions; these are usually system programs like $CNFIG which was used to configure the computer system.
===Memory and storage===
The smallest S/34 had 48K of RAM and an 8.6 MB hard drive. The largest configured S/34 could support 256K of RAM and 256MB of disk space. S/34 hard drives contained a feature called &quot;the extra cylinder,&quot; so that bad spots on the drive were detected and dynamically mapped out to good spots on the extra cylinder. Disk space on the System/34 was organized by blocks of 2560 bytes.

The System/34 supported memory paging, referring to as &quot;swapping&quot;. The System/34 could either swap out entire programs, or individual segments of a program in order to free up memory for other programs to run.

One of the machine&#x27;s most distinctive features was an off-line storage mechanism that utilized &quot;&quot;—boxes of 8-inch floppies that the machine could load and eject in a nonsequential fashion.

==Software==

===Operating System===
The System Support Program (SSP) was the only operating system of the S/34. It contained support for multiprogramming, multiple processors, 36 devices, job queues, printer queues, security, indexed file support. Fully installed, it was about 5 MB. The Operational Control Language (OCL) was the control language of SSP.

===Programming===
The System/34&#x27;s initial programming languages were limited to RPG II and Basic Assembler when introduced in 1977. FORTRAN was fully available six months after the 34&#x27;s introduction, and COBOL was available as a PRPQ. BASIC was introduced later.

==Successor systems==

The IBM System/38 was intended to be the successor of the System/34 and the earlier System/3x systems. However, due to the delays in the development of the System/38 and the high cost of the hardware once complete, IBM developed the simpler and cheaper System/36 platform which was more widely adopted than the System/38. The System/36 was an evolution of the System/34 design, but the two machines were not object-code compatible. Instead, the System/36 offered source code compatibility, allowing System/34 applications to be recompiled on a System/36 with little to no changes. Some System/34 hardware was incompatible with the System/36.

A third-party product from &quot;California Software Products, Inc.&quot; named BABY/34 allowed System/34 applications to be ported to IBM PC compatible hardware running MS-DOS.

<text>The Crusader states, or Outremer, were four Catholic polities that existed in the Levant from 1098 to 1291. Following the principles of feudalism, the foundation for these polities was laid by the First Crusade, which was proclaimed by the Latin Church in 1095 in order to reclaim the Holy Land after it was lost to the 7th-century Muslim conquest. Situated on the Eastern Mediterranean, the four states were, in order from north to south: the County of Edessa (10981150), the Principality of Antioch (10981268), the County of Tripoli (11021289), and the Kingdom of Jerusalem (10991291).

The three northern states covered an area in what is now southeastern Turkey, northwestern Syria, and northern Lebanon; and the Kingdom of Jerusalem, the southernmost and most prominent state, covered an area in what is now Israel, Palestine, southern Lebanon, and western Jordan. The description &quot;Crusader states&quot; can be misleading, as from 1130 onwards, very few people among the Franks were Crusaders. Medieval and modern writers use the term &quot;Outremer&quot; as a synonym, derived from the French word for &quot;overseas&quot;.

By 1098, the Crusaders&#x27; armed pilgrimage to Jerusalem was passing through the Syria region. Edessa, under the rule of Greek Orthodoxy, was subject to a coup d&#x27;état in which the leadership was taken over by Baldwin of Boulogne, and Bohemond of Taranto remained as the ruling prince in the captured city of Antioch. The siege of Jerusalem in 1099 resulted in a decisive Crusader victory over the Fatimid Caliphate, after which territorial consolidation followed, including the taking of Tripoli. In 1144, Edessa fell to the Zengid Turks, but the other three realms endured until the final years of the 13thcentury, when they fell to the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. The Mamluks captured Antioch in 1268 and Tripoli in 1289, leaving only the Kingdom of Jerusalem, which had been severely weakened by the Ayyubid Sultanate after the siege of Jerusalem in 1244. The Crusader presence in the Levant collapsed shortly thereafter, when the Mamluks captured Acre in 1291, ending the Kingdom of Jerusalem nearly 200 years after it was founded. With all four of the states defeated and annexed, the survivors fled to the Kingdom of Cyprus, which had been established by the Third Crusade.

The study of the Crusader states in their own right, as opposed to being a sub-topic of the Crusades, began in 19th-century France as an analogy to the French colonial experience in the Levant, though this was rejected by 20th-century historians. Their consensus was that the Frankish population, as the Western Europeans were known at the time, lived as a minority society that was largely urban and isolated from the indigenous Levantine peoples, having separate legal and religious systems. The ancient Jewish communities that had survived and remained in the holy cities of Jerusalem, Tiberias, Hebron, and Safed since the Jewish–Roman wars and the destruction of the Second Temple were heavily persecuted in a pattern of rampant Christian antisemitism accompanying the Crusades.

==Outremer==
The terms Crusader states and Outremer () describe the four feudal states established after the First Crusade in the Levant in around 1100: (from north to south) the County of Edessa, the Principality of Antioch, the County of Tripoli, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. The term Outremer is of medieval origin, whilst modern historians use Crusader states, and the term Franks for the European incomers. However, relatively few of the incoming Europeans took a crusader oath. The Latin chronicles of the First Crusade, written in the early 11th century, called the Western Christians who came from Europe irrespective of their ethnicity. Byzantine Greek sources use &quot;Frangi&quot; and Arabic &quot;al-Ifranji&quot;. Alternatively, the chronicles used , or Latins. These medieval ethnonyms reflect that the settlers could be differentiated from the indigenous population by language and faith. The Franks were mainly French-speaking Roman Catholics, while the natives were mostly Arabic- or Greek-speaking Muslims, Christians of other denominations, and Jews.
The Kingdom of Jerusalem extended over historical Palestine and at its greatest extent included some territory east of the Jordan River. The northern states covered what is now part of Syria, south-eastern Turkey, and Lebanon. These areas were historically called Syria (known to the Arabs as &quot;al-Sham&quot;) and Upper Mesopotamia. Edessa extended east beyond the Euphrates. In the Middle Ages the Crusader states were also called or . From around 1115, the ruler of Jerusalem was styled &#x27;king of the Latins in Jerusalem&#x27;. Historian Hans Eberhard Mayer believes this reflected that only Latins held complete political and legal rights in the kingdom, and that the major division in the society was not between the nobility and the common people but between the Franks and the indigenous peoples. Despite sometimes receiving homage from, and acting as regent for, the rulers of the other states; the king held no formalised overlord status, and those states remained legally outside the kingdom.

Jews, Christians, and Muslims respected Palestine, known as the Holy Land, as an exceptionally sacred place. They all associated the region with the lives of the prophets of the Hebrew Bible. All of the holy sites in Judaism were found there, including the remains of the Second Temple, destroyed by the Romans in 70AD. The New Testament presented Palestine as the venue of the acts of Jesus and his Apostles. Islamic tradition described the region&#x27;s principal city, Jerusalem, as the site of the Isra&#x27; and Mi&#x27;raj, Muhammad&#x27;s miraculous night travel and ascension to Heaven. Places associated with holy people developed into shrines visited by pilgrims coming from faraway lands, often as an act of penance. The surge in Christian pilgrimage also inspired many Jews to return to the Holy Land. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was built to commemorate Christ&#x27;s crucifixion and resurrection in Jerusalem. The Church of the Nativity was thought to enclose his birthplace in Bethlehem. The Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque commemorated Muhammad&#x27;s night journey. Although the most sacred places of devotion were in Palestine, there were also shrines in neighbouring Syria. As a borderland of the Muslim world, Syria was an important theatre of jihad, though enthusiasm for pursuing it had faded by the end of the 11thcentury. In contrast, the Catholic ideology of religious war quickly developed, culminating in the idea of crusades for lands claimed for Christianity.

==Background==

===Catholic Europe===

Most crusades came from what had been the Carolingian Empire around 800. The empire had disintegrated, and two loosely unified successor states had taken its place: the Holy Roman Empire, which encompassed Germany, part of northern Italy, and the neighbouring lands; and France. Germany was divided into duchies, such as Lower Lorraine and Saxony, and their dukes did not always obey the emperors. Northern Italy was even less united, divided into numerous de facto independent states, and the authority of the emperor was barely felt. Carolingian&#x27;s western successor state, France, was not united either; the French kings only controlled a small central region directly. Counts and dukes ruled other regions, and some of them were remarkably wealthy and powerful—in particular, the dukes of Aquitaine and Normandy, and the counts of Anjou, Champagne, Flanders, and Toulouse.

Western Christians and Muslims interacted mainly through warring or commerce. During the 8th and 9th centuries, the Muslims were on the offensive, and commercial contacts primarily enriched the Islamic world. Europe was rural and underdeveloped, offering little more than raw materials and slaves in return for spices, cloth, and other luxuries from the Middle East. Climate change during the Medieval Warm Period affected the Middle East and western Europe differently. In the east, it caused droughts, while in the west, it improved conditions for agriculture. Higher agricultural yields led to population growth and the expansion of commerce, and to the development of prosperous new military and mercantile elites.

In Catholic Europe, state and society were organised along feudal lines. Landed estates were customarily granted in fief—that is, in return for services that the grantee, or vassal, was to perform for the grantor, or lord. A vassal owed fealty to the lord and was expected to provide military aid and advice to him. Violence was endemic, and a new class of mounted warriors, the knights, emerged. Many built castles, and their feuds brought much suffering to the unarmed population. The development of the knightly class coincided with the subjection of the formerly free peasantry into serfdom, but the connection between the two processes is unclear. As feudal lordships could be established by the acquiring land, western aristocrats willingly launched offensive military campaigns, even against faraway territories. Catholic Europe&#x27;s expansion in the Mediterranean began in the second half of the 11th century. Norman warlords conquered southern Italy from the Byzantines and ousted the Muslim rulers from Sicily; French aristocrats hastened to the Iberian Peninsula to fight the Moors of Al-Andalus; and Italian fleets launched pillaging raids against the north African ports. This shift of power especially benefited merchants from the Italian city-states of Amalfi, Genoa, Pisa, and Venice. They replaced the Muslim and Jewish middlemen in the lucrative trans-Mediterranean commerce, and their fleets became the dominant naval forces in the region.

On the eve of the Crusades, after a thousand years of reputedly uninterrupted succession of popes, the Papacy was Catholic Europe&#x27;s oldest institution. The popes were seen as the Apostle Saint Peter&#x27;s successors, and their prestige was high. In the west, the Gregorian Reform reduced lay influence on church life and strengthened papal authority over the clergy. Eastern Christians continued to consider the popes as no more than one of the five highest ranking church leaders, titled patriarchs, and rejected the idea of papal supremacy. This opposition, together with differences in theology and liturgy, caused acrimonious disputes which escalated when a papal legate excommunicated the Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople in 1054. The patriarchs of Alexandria, Antioch, and Jerusalem sided with the Ecumenical Patriarch against the Papacy, but the East–West Schism was not yet inevitable, and the Catholic and Orthodox Churches remained in full communion. The Gregorian Reform enhanced the popes&#x27; influence on secular matters. To achieve political goals, popes excommunicated their opponents, placed entire realms under interdict and promised spiritual rewards to those who took up arms for their cause. In 1074 Pope Gregory VII even considered leading a military campaign against the Turks who had attacked Byzantine territories in Anatolia.

===Levant===

Turkic migration permeated the Middle East from the 9thcentury. Muslim border raiders captured unconverted Turkic nomads in the Central Asian borderlands and sold them to Islamic leaders who used them as slave soldiers. These were known as or and were emancipated when converted to Islam. were valued primarily because the link of their prospects to a single master generated extreme loyalty. In the context of Middle Eastern politics this made them more trustworthy than relatives. Eventually, some descendants climbed the Muslim hierarchy to become king makers or even dynastic founders.
In the mid-11thcentury, a minor clan of Oghuz Turks named Seljuks, after the warlord Saljūq from Transoxiana, had expanded through Khurasan, Iran, and on to Baghdad. There, Saljūq&#x27;s grandson Tughril was granted the title —&#x27;power&#x27; in Arabic—by the Abbasid Caliph. The caliphs kept their legitimacy and prestige, but the held political power. Seljuk success was achieved by extreme violence. It brought disruptive nomadism to the sedentary society of the Levant, and set a pattern followed by other nomadic Turkic clans such as the Danishmendids and the Artuqids. The Great Seljuk Empire was decentralised, polyglot, and multi-national. A junior Seljuk ruling a province as an appanage was titled , Arabic for king.

 military commanders acting as tutors and guardians for young Seljuk princes held the position of (&#x27;father-commander&#x27;). If his ward held a province in appanage, the ruled it as regent for the underage . On occasion, the kept power after his ward reached the age of majority or died. The Seljuks adopted and strengthened the traditional system of the administration of state revenues. This system secured the payment of military commanders through granting them the right to collect the land tax in a well-defined territory, but it exposed the taxpayers to an absent lord&#x27;s greed and to his officials&#x27; arbitrary actions. Although the Seljuk state worked when family ties and personal loyalty overlapped the leaders&#x27; personal ambitions, the lavish grants combined with rivalries between , , and military commanders could lead to disintegration in critical moments.

The region&#x27;s ethnic and religious diversity led to alienation among the ruled populations. In Syria, the Seljuk Sunnis ruled indigenous Shias. In Cilicia and northern Syria, the Byzantines, Arabs, and Turks squeezed populations of Armenians. The Seljuks contested control of southern Palestine with Egypt, where Shia rulers ruled a majority Sunni populace through powerful viziers who were mainly Turkic or Armenian, rather than Egyptian or Arab. The Seljuks and the Fatimid Caliphate of Egypt hated each other, as the Seljuk saw themselves as defenders of the Sunni Abbasid Caliphate and Fatimid Egypt was the chief Shi&#x27;ite power in Islam. The root of this was beyond cultural and racial conflict but originated in the splits within Islam following Muhammad&#x27;s death. Sunnis supported a caliphal succession that began with one of his associates, Abu Bakr, while Shi&#x27;ites supported an alternative succession from his cousin and son-in-law, Ali.

Islamic law granted the status of , or protected peoples, to the People of the Book, like Christians and Jews. The were second-class citizens, obliged to pay a special poll tax, the , but they could practise their religion and maintain their own law courts. Theological, liturgical, and cultural differences had given rise to the development of competing Christian denominations in the Levant before the 7th-century Muslim conquest. The Greek Orthodox natives, or Melkites, remained in full communion with the Byzantine imperial church, and their religious leaders often came from the Byzantine capital, Constantinople. In the 5thcentury, the Nestorians, and the Monophysite Jacobites, Armenians, and Copts, broke with the Byzantine state church. The Maronites&#x27; separate church organisation emerged under Muslim rule.

During the late 10th and early 11thcenturies, the Byzantine Empire had been on the offensive, recapturing Antioch in 969, after three centuries of Arab rule, and invading Syria. Turkic brigands and their Byzantine, also often ethnically Turkic, counterparts called indulged in cross-border raiding. In 1071, while securing his northern borders during a break in his campaigns against the Fatimid Caliphate, Sultan Alp Arslan defeated Byzantine Emperor Romanos IV Diogenes at Manzikert. Romanos&#x27; capture and Byzantine factionalism that followed broke Byzantine border control. This enabled large numbers of Turkic warbands and nomadic herders to enter Anatolia. Alp Arslan&#x27;s cousin Suleiman ibn Qutulmish seized Cilicia and entered Antioch in 1084. Two years later, he was killed in a conflict with the Great Seljuk Empire. Between 1092 and 1094, Nizam al-Mulk, the Sultan Malik-Shah, the Fatimid Caliph, Al-Mustansir Billah and the vizier Badr al-Jamali all died. Malik-Shah&#x27;s brother Tutush and the of Aleppo and Edessa were killed in the succession conflict, and Suleiman&#x27;s son Kilij Arslan I revived his father&#x27;s Sultanate of Rum in Anatolia. The Egyptian succession resulted in a split in the Ismā&#x27;īlist branch of Shia Islam. The Persian missionary Hassan-i Sabbah led a breakaway group, creating the Nizari branch of Isma&#x27;ilism. This was known as the New Preaching in Syria and the Order of Assassins in western historiography. The Order used targeted murder to compensate for their lack of military power.

The Seljuk invasions, the subsequent eclipse of the Byzantines and Fatimids, and the disintegration of the Seljuk Empire revived the old Levantine system of city-states. The region had always been highly urbanised, and the local societies were organised into networks of interdependent settlements, each centred around a city or a major town. These networks developed into autonomous lordships under the rule of a Turkic, Arab or Armenian warlord or town magistrate in the late 11thcentury. The local took control of Tyre and Tripoli, the Arab Banu Munqidh seized Shaizar, and Tutush&#x27;s sons Duqaq and Ridwan succeeded in Damascus and Aleppo respectively, but their , Janah ad-Dawla and Toghtekin were in control. Ridwan&#x27;s retainer Sokman ben Artuq held Jerusalem; Ridwan&#x27;s father-in-law, Yağısıyan, ruled Antioch; and a warlord representing Byzantine interests, called Thoros, seized Edessa. During this period the old Islamic conflict between Sunni and Shia made the Muslim peoples more likely to wage war on each other than on Christians.

==History==

===Foundation===
The Byzantines augmented their armies with mercenaries from the Turks and Europe. This compensated for a shortfall caused by lost territory, especially in Anatolia. In 1095 at the Council of Piacenza, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos requested support from Pope Urban II against the Seljuk threat. What the Emperor probably had in mind was a relatively modest force, and Urban far exceeded his expectations by calling for the First Crusade at the later Council of Clermont. He developed a doctrine of &quot;bellum sacrum&quot; (Christian holy war) and, based mainly on Old Testament passages in which God leads the Hebrews to victory in war, reconciled this with Church teachings. Urban&#x27;s call for an armed pilgrimage for the liberation of the Eastern Christians and the recovery of the Holy Land aroused unprecedented enthusiasm in Catholic Europe. Within a year, tens of thousands of people, both commoners and aristocrats, departed for the military campaign. Individual crusaders&#x27; motivations to join the crusade varied, but some of them probably left Europe to make a new permanent home in the Levant.

Alexios cautiously welcomed the feudal armies commanded by western nobles. By dazzling them with wealth and charming them with flattery, Alexios extracted oaths of fealty from most of the Crusader commanders. As his vassals, Godfrey of Bouillon, nominally duke of Lower Lorraine; the Italo-Norman Bohemond of Taranto; Bohemond&#x27;s nephew Tancred of Hauteville; and Godfrey&#x27;s brother Baldwin of Bologne all swore that any territory gained which the Roman Empire had previously held, would be handed to Alexios&#x27; Byzantine representatives. Only Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse refused this oath, instead promising non-aggression towards Alexios.

The Byzantine Tatikios guided the crusade on the arduous three-month march to besiege Antioch, during which the Franks made alliances with local Armenians. Before reaching Antioch, Baldwin and his men left the main army and headed to the Euphrates river, engaging in local politics and seizing the fortifications of Turbessel and Rawandan, where the Armenian populace welcomed him. Thoros, then ruler of this territory, could barely control or defend Edessa, so he tried to hire the Franks as mercenaries. Later, he went further and adopted Baldwin as his son in a power-share arrangement. In March 1098, a month after Baldwin&#x27;s arrival, a Christian mob killed Thoros and acclaimed Baldwin as , the Byzantine title Thoros had used. Baldwin&#x27;s position was personal rather than institutional, and the Armenian governance of the city remained in place. Baldwin&#x27;s nascent County of Edessa consisted of pockets separated from his other holdings of Turbessel, Rawandan and Samosata by the territory of Turkic and Armenian warlords and the Euphrates. 

As the crusaders marched towards Antioch, Syrian Muslims asked Sultan Barkiyaruq for help, but he was engaged in a power struggle with his brother Muhammad Tapar. At Antioch, Bohemond persuaded the other leaders the city should be his if he could capture it, and Alexios did not come to claim it. Alexios withdrew, rather than join the siege, after Stephen, Count of Blois (who was deserting) told him defeat was imminent. In June 1098, Bohemond persuaded a renegade Armenian tower commander to let the crusaders into the city. They slaughtered the Muslim inhabitants and, by mistake, some local Christians. The crusade leaders decided to return Antioch to Alexios as they had sworn to at Constantinople, but when they learnt of Alexios&#x27; withdrawal, Bohemond claimed the city for himself. The other leaders agreed, apart from Raymond, who supported the Byzantine alliance.

This dispute resulted in the march stalling in north Syria. The crusaders were becoming aware of the chaotic state of Muslim politics through frequent diplomatic relations with the Muslim powers. Raymond indulged in a small expedition. He bypassed Shaizar and laid siege to Arqa to enforce the payment of a tribute. In Raymond&#x27;s absence, Bohemond expelled Raymond&#x27;s last troops from Antioch and consolidated his rule in the developing Principality of Antioch.

Under pressure from the poorer Franks, Godfrey and Robert II, Count of Flanders reluctantly joined the eventually unsuccessful siege of Arqa. Alexios asked the crusade to delay the march to Jerusalem, so the Byzantines could assist. Raymond&#x27;s support for this strategy increased division among the crusade leaders and damaged his reputation among ordinary crusaders.

The crusaders marched along the Mediterranean coast to Jerusalem. On 15 July 1099, crusaders took the city after a siege lasting barely longer than a month. Thousands of Muslims and Jews were killed, and the survivors sold into slavery. Proposals to govern the city as an ecclesiastical state were rejected. Raymond refused the royal title, claiming only Christ could wear a crown in Jerusalem. This may have been to dissuade the more popular Godfrey from assuming the throne, but Godfrey adopted the title &quot;Advocatus Sancti Sepulchri&quot; (&#x27;Defender of the Holy Sepulchre&#x27;) when he was proclaimed the first Frankish ruler of Jerusalem. In Western Europe an was a layman responsible for the protection and administration of church estates.

The foundation of these three crusader states did not change the political situation in the Levant profoundly. Frankish rulers replaced local warlords in the cities, but large-scale colonisation did not follow, and the new conquerors did not change the traditional organisation of settlements and property in the countryside. The Muslim leaders were massacred or forced into exile, and the natives, accustomed to the rule of well-organised warbands, offered little resistance to their new lords. Western Christianity&#x27;s canon law recognised that peace treaties and armistices between Christians and Muslims were valid. The Frankish knights regarded the Turkic mounted warlords as their peers with familiar moral values, and this familiarity facilitated their negotiations with the Muslim leaders. The conquest of a city was often accompanied by a treaty with the neighbouring Muslim rulers who were customarily forced to pay a tribute for the peace. The crusader states had a special position in Western Christianity&#x27;s consciousness: many Catholic aristocrats were ready to fight for the Holy Land, although in the decades following the destruction of the large Crusade of 1101 in Anatolia, only smaller groups of armed pilgrims departed for Outremer.

===Consolidation (1099 to 1130)===
The Fatimids&#x27; feud with the Seljuks hindered Muslim actions for more than a decade. Outnumbered by their enemies, the Franks remained in a vulnerable position, but they could forge temporary alliances with their Armenian, Arab, and Turkic neighbours. Each crusader state had its own strategic purpose during the first years of its existence. Jerusalem needed undisturbed access to the Mediterranean; Antioch wanted to seize Cilicia and the territory along the upper course of the Orontes River; and Edessa aspired to control the Upper Euphrates valley. The most powerful Syrian Muslim ruler, Toghtekin of Damascus, took a practical approach to dealing with the Franks. His treaties establishing Damascene–Jerusalemite condominiums (shared rule) in debated territories created precedents for other Muslim leaders.

In August 1099, Godfrey defeated the Fatimid vizier, Al-Afdal Shahanshah at Ascalon. When Daimbert of Pisa, the papal legate, arrived in the Levant with 120 Pisan ships, Godfrey gained much-needed naval support by backing him for the Patriarchate of Jerusalem, as well as granting him parts of Jerusalem and the Pisans a section of the port of Jaffa. Daimbert revived the idea of creating an ecclesiastic principality and extracted oaths of fealty from Godfrey and Bohemond.

When Godfrey died in 1100, his retainers occupied the Tower of David to secure his inheritance for his brother Baldwin. Daimbert and Tancred sought Bohemond&#x27;s help against the Lotharingians, but the Danishmends captured Bohemond under Gazi Gümüshtigin while securing Antioch&#x27;s northern marches. Before departing for Jerusalem, Baldwin ceded Edessa to his cousin, Baldwin of Bourcq. His arrival thwarted Daimbert, who crowned Baldwin as Jerusalem&#x27;s first Latin king on Christmas Day 1100. By performing the ceremony, the Patriarch abandoned his claim to rule the Holy Land.

Tancred remained defiant to Baldwin until an Antiochene delegation offered him the regency in March 1101. He ceded his Principality of Galilee to the king, but reserved the right to reclaim it as a fief if he returned from Antioch within fifteen months. For the next two years, Tancred ruled Antioch. He conquered Byzantine Cilicia and parts of Syria. The Fatimid Caliphate attacked Jerusalem in 1101, 1102 and 1105, on the last occasion in alliance with Toghtekin. BaldwinI repulsed these attacks and with Genoese, Venetian, and Norwegian fleets conquered all the towns on the Palestinian coast except Tyre and Ascalon.

Raymond laid the foundations of the fourth crusader state, the County of Tripoli. He captured Tartus and Gibelet and besieged Tripoli. His cousin William II Jordan continued the siege after Raymond&#x27;s death in 1105. It was completed in 1109 when Raymond&#x27;s son Bertrand arrived. Baldwin brokered a deal, sharing the territory between them, until William Jordan&#x27;s death united the county. Bertrand acknowledged Baldwin&#x27;s suzerainty, although William Jordan had been Tancred&#x27;s vassal.

When Bohemond was released for a ransom in 1103, he compensated Tancred with lands and gifts. Baldwin of Bourcq and his cousin and vassal, Joscelin of Courtenay, were captured while attacking Ridwan of Aleppo at Harran with Bohemond. Tancred assumed the regency of Edessa. The Byzantines took the opportunity to reconquer Cilicia. They took the port but not the citadel of Laodikeia.

Bohemond returned to Italy to recruit allies and gather supplies. Tancred assumed leadership in Antioch, and his cousin Richard of Salerno did the same in Edessa. In 1107, Bohemond crossed the Adriatic Sea and failed in besieging Dyrrachion in the Balkan Peninsula. The resulting Treaty of Devol forced Bohemond to restore Laodikeia and Cilicia to Alexios, become his vassal and reinstate the Greek patriarch of Antioch. Bohemond never returned. He died, leaving an underage son Bohemond II. Tancred continued as regent of Antioch and ignored the treaty. Richard&#x27;s son, Roger of Salerno, succeeded as regent on Tancred&#x27;s death in 1112.

The fall of Tripoli prompted Sultan Muhammad Tapar to appoint the of Mosul, Mawdud, to wage jihad against the Franks. Between 1110 and 1113, Mawdud mounted four campaigns in Mesopotamia and Syria, but rivalry among his heterogeneous armies&#x27; commanders forced him to abandon the offensive on each occasion. As Edessa was Mosul&#x27;s chief rival, Mawdud directed two campaigns against the city. They caused havoc, and the county&#x27;s eastern region could never recover. The Syrian Muslim rulers saw the Sultan&#x27;s intervention as a threat to their autonomy and collaborated with the Franks. After an assassin, likely a Nizari, murdered Mawdud, Muhammad Tapar dispatched two armies to Syria, but both campaigns failed.

As Aleppo remained vulnerable to Frankish attacks, the city leaders sought external protection. They allied with the adventurous Artuqid princes, Ilghazi and Balak, who inflicted crucial defeats on the Franks between 1119 and 1124, but could rarely prevent Frankish counter-invasions.

In 1118 Baldwin of Bourcq succeeded BaldwinI as King of Jerusalem, naming Joscelin his successor in Edessa. After Roger was killed at (&#x27;Field of Blood&#x27;), BaldwinII assumed the regency of Antioch for the absent BohemondII. Public opinion attributed a series of disasters affecting the Outremer—defeats by enemy forces and plagues of locusts—as punishments for the Franks&#x27; sins. To improve moral standards, the Jerusalemite ecclesiastic and secular leaders assembled a council at Nablus and issued decrees against adultery, sodomy, bigamy, and sexual relations between Catholics and Muslims.

A proposal by a group of pious knights about a monastic order for deeply religious warriors was likely first discussed at the council of Nablus. Church leaders quickly espoused the idea of armed monks, and within a decade, two military orders, the Knights Templar and Hospitaller, were formed. As the Fatimid Caliphate no longer posed a major threat to Jerusalem, but Antioch and Edessa were vulnerable to invasion, the defence of the northern crusader states took much of BaldwinII&#x27;s time. His absence, its impact on government, and his placement of relatives and their vassals in positions of power created opposition in Jerusalem. Baldwin&#x27;s sixteen-month captivity led to a failed deposition attempt by some of the nobility, with the Flemish count, Charles the Good, considered as a possible replacement. Charles declined the offer.

Baldwin had four daughters. In 1126, Bohemond reached the age of majority and married the second-oldest, Alice, in Antioch. Aleppo had plunged into anarchy, but Bohemond II could not exploit this because of a conflict with Joscelin. The new of Mosul Imad al-Din Zengi seized Aleppo in 1128. The two major Muslim centres&#x27; union was especially dangerous for the neighbouring Edessa, but it also worried Damascus&#x27;s new ruler, Taj al-Muluk Buri. Baldwin&#x27;s eldest daughter Melisende was his heir. He married her to Fulk of Anjou, who had widespread western connections useful to the kingdom. After Fulk&#x27;s arrival, Baldwin raised a large force for an attack on Damascus. This force included the leaders of the other crusader states, and a significant Angevin contingent provided by Fulk. The campaign was abandoned when the Franks&#x27; foraging parties were destroyed, and bad weather made the roads impassable. In 1130 Bohemond II was killed raiding in Cilicia, leaving Alice with their infant daughter, Constance. Baldwin II denied Alice control, instead resuming the regency until his death in 1131.

=== Muslim revival (1131 to 1174) ===
On his deathbed Baldwin named Fulk, Melisende, and their infant son BaldwinIII joint heirs. Fulk intended to revoke the arrangement, but his favouritism toward his compatriots roused strong discontent in the kingdom. In 1134, he repressed a revolt by Hugh II of Jaffa, a relative of Melisende, but was still compelled to accept the shared inheritance. He also thwarted frequent attempts by his sister-in-law Alice to assume the regency in Antioch, including alliances with Pons of Tripoli and JoscelinII of Edessa. Taking advantage of Antioch&#x27;s weakened position, Leo, a Cilician Armenian ruler, seized the Cilician plain. In 1133, the Antiochene nobility asked Fulk to propose a husband for Constance, and he selected Raymond of Poitiers, a younger son of William IX of Aquitaine. Raymond finally arrived in Antioch three years later and married Constance. He reconquered parts of Cilicia from the Armenians. In 1137, Pons was killed battling the Damascenes, and Zengi invaded Tripoli. Fulk intervened, but Zengi&#x27;s troops captured Pons&#x27; successor RaymondII, and besieged Fulk in the border castle of Montferrand. Fulk surrendered the castle and paid Zengi 50,000dinars for his and Raymond&#x27;s freedom. Emperor Alexios&#x27; son and successor, John II Komnenos, reasserted Byzantine claims to Cilicia and Antioch. His military campaign compelled Raymond of Poitiers to give homage and agree that he would surrender Antioch by way of compensation if the Byzantines ever captured Aleppo, Homs, and Shaizar for him. The following year the Byzantines and Franks jointly besieged Aleppo and Shaizar but could not take the towns. Zengi soon seized Homs from the Damascenes, but a Damascene–Jerusalemite coalition prevented his southward expansion.

Joscelin made an alliance with the Artuqid Kara Arslan, who was Zengi&#x27;s principal Muslim rival in Upper Mesopotamia. While Joscelin was staying west of the Euphrates at Turbessel, Zengi invaded the Frankish lands east of the river in late 1144. Before the end of the year, he captured the region, including the city of Edessa. Losing Edessa strategically threatened Antioch and limited opportunities for a Jerusalemite expansion in the south. In September 1146, Zengi was assassinated, possibly on orders from Damascus. His empire was divided between his two sons, with the younger Nur ad-Din succeeding him in Aleppo. A power vacuum in Edessa allowed Joscelin to return to the city, but he was unable to take the citadel. When Nur ad-Din arrived, the Franks were trapped, Joscelin fled and the subsequent sack left the city deserted.

The fall of Edessa shocked Western opinion, prompting the largest military response since the First Crusade. The new crusade consisted of two great armies led overland by Louis VII of France and Conrad III of Germany, arriving in Acre in 1148. The arduous march had greatly reduced the two rulers&#x27; forces. At a leadership conference, including the widowed Melisende and her son BaldwinIII, they agreed to attack Damascus rather than attempt to recover distant Edessa. The attack on Damascus ended in a humiliating defeat and retreat. Scapegoating followed the unexpected failure, with many westerners blaming the Franks. Fewer crusaders came from Europe to fight for the Holy Land in the next decades. Raymond of Poitiers joined forces with the Nizari and Joscelin with the Rum Seljuks against Aleppo. Nur ad-Din invaded Antioch and Raymond was defeated and killed at Inab in 1149. The next year Joscelin was captured and tortured and later died. Beatrice of Saone, his wife, sold the remains of the County of Edessa to the Byzantines with Baldwin&#x27;s consent. Already 21 and eager to rule alone, Baldwin forced Melisende&#x27;s retirement in 1152. In Antioch, Constance resisted pressure to remarry until 1153 when she chose the French nobleman Raynald of Châtillon as her second husband.

From 1149, all Fatimid caliphs were children, and military commanders were competing for power. Ascalon, the Fatimids&#x27; last Palestinian bridgehead, hindered Frankish raids against Egypt, but Baldwin captured the town in 1153. The Damascenes feared further Frankish expansion, and Nur ad-Din seized the city with ease a year later. He continued to remit the tribute that Damascus&#x27; former rulers had offered to the Jerusalemite kings. Baldwin extracted tribute from the Egyptians as well. Raynald lacked financial resources. He tortured the Latin Patriarch of Antioch, Aimery of Limoges, to appropriate his wealth and attacked the Byzantine&#x27;s Cilician Armenians. When Emperor Manuel I Komnenos delayed the payment he had been promised, Raynald pillaged Byzantine Cyprus. Thierry, Count of Flanders, brought military strength from the West for campaigning. Thierry, Baldwin, Raynald and Raymond III of Tripoli attacked Shaizar. Baldwin offered the city to Thierry, who refused Raynald&#x27;s demands he become his vassal, and the siege was abandoned. After Nur ad-Din seized Shaizar in 1157, the Nizari remained the last independent Muslim power in Syria. As prospects for a new crusade from the West were poor, the Franks of Jerusalem sought a marriage alliance with the Byzantines. Baldwin married Manuel&#x27;s niece, Theodora, and received a significant dowry. With his consent, Manuel forced Raynald into accepting Byzantine overlordship.
The childless BaldwinIII died in 1163. His younger brother Amalric had to repudiate his wife Agnes of Courtenay on grounds of consanguinity before his coronation, but the right of their two children, Baldwin IV and Sibylla, to inherit the kingdom was confirmed. The Fatimid Caliphate had rival viziers, Shawar and Dirgham, both eager to seek external support. This gave Amalric and Nur ad-Din the opportunity to intervene. Amalric launched five invasions of Egypt between 1163 and 1169, on the last occasion cooperating with a Byzantine fleet, but he could not establish a bridgehead. Nur ad-Din appointed his Kurdish general Shirkuh to direct the military operations in Egypt. Weeks before Shirkuh died in 1169, the Fatimid caliph Al-Adid made him vizier. His nephew Saladin, who ended the Shi&#x27;ite caliphate when Al-Adid died in September 1171, succeeded Shirkuh. In March 1171, Amalric undertook a visit to Manuel in Constantinople to get Byzantine military support for yet another attack on Egypt. To this end, he swore fealty to the Emperor before his return to Jerusalem, but conflicts with Venice and Sicily prevented the Byzantines from campaigning in the Levant. In theory, Saladin was Nur ad-Din&#x27;s lieutenant, but mutual distrust hindered their cooperation against the crusader states. As Saladin remitted suspiciously small revenue payments to him, Nur ad-Din began gathering troops for an attack on Egypt, but he died in May 1174. He left an 11-year-old son, As-Salih Ismail al-Malik. Within two months, Amalric died. His son and successor, BaldwinIV, was 13 and a leper.

=== Decline and survival (1174 to 1188) ===

The accession of underage rulers led to disunity both in Jerusalem and in Muslim Syria. In Jerusalem, the seneschal Miles of Plancy took control, but unknown assailants murdered him on the streets of Acre. With the baronage&#x27;s consent, Amalric&#x27;s cousin, RaymondIII of Tripoli, assumed the regency for BaldwinIV as . He became the most powerful baron by marrying Eschiva of Bures, the richest heiress of the kingdom, and gaining Galilee. Nur ad-Din&#x27;s empire quickly disintegrated. His eunuch confidant Gümüshtekin took As-Salih from Damascus to Aleppo. Gümüshtekin&#x27;s rival, Ibn al-Muqaddam, seized Damascus but soon surrendered it to Saladin. By 1176, Saladin reunited much of Muslim Syria through warring against Gümüshtekin and As-Salih&#x27;s relatives, the Zengids. That same year, Emperor Manuel invaded the Sultanate of Rum to reopen the Anatolian pilgrimage route towards the Holy Land. His defeat at Myriokephalon weakened the Byzantines&#x27; hold on Cilicia.
Upholding the balance of power in Syria was apparently Raymond&#x27;s main concern during his regency. When Saladin besieged Aleppo in 1174, Raymond led a relief army to the city; next year, when a united Zengid army invaded Saladin&#x27;s realm, he signed a truce with Saladin. Gümüshtekin released Raynald of Châtillon and Baldwin&#x27;s maternal uncle, Joscelin III of Courtenay, for a large ransom. They hastened to Jerusalem, and Raynald seized Oultrejourdain by marrying Stephanie of Milly. As Baldwin, a leper, was not expected to father children, his sister&#x27;s marriage was to be arranged before his inevitable premature death from the disease. His regent, Raymond, chose William of Montferrat for Sybilla&#x27;s husband. William was the cousin of both Holy Roman Emperor Frederick Barbarossa and LouisVII of France. In 1176, Baldwin reached the age of 15 and majority, ending Raymond&#x27;s regency. He revisited plans for an invasion of Egypt and renewed his father&#x27;s pact with the Byzantines. Manuel dispatched a fleet of 70 galleys plus support ships to Outremer. As William had died, and Baldwin&#x27;s health was deteriorating, the Franks offered the regency and the Egyptian invasion&#x27;s command to Baldwin&#x27;s crusader cousin Philip I, Count of Flanders. He wanted to be free to return to Flanders and rejected both offers. The plan for the invasion was abandoned, and the Byzantine fleet sailed for Constantinople.

Baldwin negotiated a marriage between Hugh III, Duke of Burgundy, and Sibylla, but the succession crisis in France prevented him from sailing. Tension between Baldwin&#x27;s maternal and paternal relatives grew. When Raymond and Bohemond, both related to him on his father&#x27;s side, came to Jerusalem unexpectedly before Easter in 1180, Baldwin panicked, fearing they had arrived to depose him and elevate Sibylla to the throne under their control. To thwart their coup, he sanctioned her marriage to Guy of Lusignan, a young aristocrat from Poitou. Guy&#x27;s brother Aimery held the office of constable of Jerusalem, and their family had close links to the House of Plantagenet. Baldwin&#x27;s mother and her clique marginalised Raymond, Bohemond and the influential Ibelin family. To prepare for a military campaign against the Seljuks of Rum, Saladin concluded a two-year truce with Baldwin and, after launching a short but devastating campaign along the coast of Tripoli, with Raymond. For the first time in the history of Frankish–Muslim relations, the Franks could not set conditions for the peace. Between 1180 and 1183, Saladin asserted his suzerainty over the Artuqids, concluded a peace treaty with the Rum Seljuks, seized Aleppo from the Zengids and re-established the Egyptian navy. Meanwhile, after the truce expired in 1182, Saladin demonstrated the strategic advantage he had by holding both Cairo and Damascus. While he faced Baldwin in Oultrejordain, his troops from Syria pillaged Galilee. The Franks adopted a defensive tactic and strengthened their fortresses. In February 1183, a Jerusalemite assembly levied an extraordinary tax for defence funding. Raynald was the sole Frankish ruler to pursue an offensive policy. He attacked an Egyptian caravan and built a fleet for a naval raid into the Red Sea.

Byzantine influence declined after Manuel died in 1180. Bohemond repulsed his Byzantine wife Theodora and married Sybil, an Antiochene noblewoman with a bad reputation. Patriarch Aimery excommunicated him and the Antiochene nobles who opposed the marriage fled to the Cilician Armenian prince, RubenIII. Saladin granted a truce to Bohemond and made preparations for an invasion of Jerusalem where Guy took command of the defence. When Saladin invaded Galilee, the Franks responded with what William of Tyre described in his contemporaneous chronicle as their largest army in living memory but avoided fighting a battle. After days of fierce skirmishing, Saladin withdrew towards Damascus. Baldwin dismissed Guy from his position as , apparently because Guy had proved unable to overcome factionalism in the army. In November 1183, Baldwin made Guy&#x27;s five-year-old stepson, also called Baldwin, co-ruler, and had him crowned king while attempting to annul the marriage of Guy and Sibylla. Guy and Sibylla fled to Ascalon, and his supporters vainly intervened on their behalf at a general council. An embassy to Europe was met with offers of money but not of military support. Already dying, BaldwinIV appointed Raymond for 10years, but charged Joscelin with the ailing BaldwinV&#x27;s guardianship. As there was no consensus on what should happen if the boy king died, it would be for the pope, the Holy Roman Emperor, the kings of France and England to decide whether his mother Sibylla or her half-sister Isabella had stronger claim to the throne. Bohemond was staying at Acre around this time, allegedly because BaldwinIV wanted to secure Bohemond&#x27;s support for his decisions on the succession. Back in Antioch, Bohemond kidnapped Ruben of Cilicia and forced him into becoming his vassal.

Saladin signed a four-year truce with Jerusalem and attacked Mosul. He could not capture the city but extracted an oath of fealty from Mosul&#x27;s Zengid ruler, Izz al-Din Mas&#x27;ud, in March 1186. A few months later, BaldwinV died, and a power struggle began in Jerusalem. Raymond summoned the barons to Nablus to a general council. In his absence, Sybilla&#x27;s supporters, led by Joscelin and Raynald, took full control of Jerusalem, Acre and Beirut. Patriarch Heraclius of Jerusalem crowned her queen and appointed Guy her co-ruler. The barons assembling at Nablus offered the crown to Isabella&#x27;s husband Humphrey IV of Toron, but he submitted to Sybilla to avoid a civil war. After his desertion, all the barons but Baldwin of Ibelin and Raymond swore fealty to the royal couple. Baldwin went into exile, and Raymond forged an alliance with Saladin. Raynald seized another caravan, which violated the truce and prompted Saladin to assemble his forces for the jihād. Raymond allowed Muslim troops to pass through Galilee to raid around Acre. His shock at the Frankish defeat in the resulting Battle of Cresson brought him to reconciliation with Guy.

Guy now gathered a large force, committing all of his kingdom&#x27;s available resources. The leadership divided on tactics. Raynald urged an offensive, while Raymond proposed defensive caution, although Saladin was besieging his castle at Tiberias. Guy decided to deal with the siege. The march towards Tiberias was arduous, and Saladin&#x27;s troops overwhelmed the exhausted Frankish army at the Horns of Hattin on 4July 1187. Hattin was a massive defeat for the Franks. Nearly all the major Frankish leaders were taken prisoner, but only Raynald and the armed monks of the military orders were executed. Raymond was among the few Frankish leaders who escaped captivity. He fell seriously ill after reaching Tripoli. Within months after Hattin, Saladin conquered almost the entire kingdom. The city of Jerusalem surrendered on 2October 1187. There were no massacres following the conquest, but tens of thousands of Franks were enslaved. Those who could negotiate a free passage or were ransomed swarmed to Tyre, Tripoli, or Antioch. Conrad of Montferrat commanded the defences of Tyre. He was William&#x27;s brother and arrived only days after Hattin. The childless Raymond died, and Bohemond&#x27;s younger son, also called Bohemond, assumed power in Tripoli. After news of the Franks&#x27; devastating defeat at Hattin reached Italy, Pope Gregory VIII called for a new crusade. Passionate sermons raised religious fervour, and it is likely that more people took the crusader oath than during recruitment for the previous crusades.

Bad weather and growing discontent among his troops forced Saladin to abandon the siege of Tyre and allow his men to return to Iraq, Syria, and Egypt early in 1188. In May, Saladin turned his attention to Tripoli and Antioch. The arrival of William II of Sicily&#x27;s fleet saved Tripoli. Saladin released Guy on the condition that he go overseas and never bear arms against him. Historian Thomas Asbridge proposes that Saladin likely anticipated that a power struggle between Guy and Conrad was inevitable and it could weaken the Franks. Indeed, Guy failed to depart for Europe. In October, Bohemond asked Saladin for a seven-month truce, offering to surrender the city of Antioch if help did not arrive. Saladin&#x27;s biographer Ali ibn al-Athir wrote, after the Frankish castles were starved into submission, that &quot;the Muslims acquired everything from as far as Ayla to the furthest districts of Beirut with only the interruption of Tyre and also all the dependencies of Antioch, apart from al-Qusayr&quot;.

===Recovery and civil war (1189 to 1243)===
Guy of Lusignan, his brother Aimery, and Gerard de Ridefort, grand master of the Templars, gathered about 600 knights in Antioch. They approached Tyre, but Conrad of Montferrat refused them entry, convinced Guy had forfeited his claim to rule when Saladin conquered his kingdom. Guy and his comrades knew western crusaders would arrive soon and risked a token move on Acre in August 1189. Crusader groups from many parts of Europe joined them. Their tactic surprised Saladin and prevented him from resuming the invasion of Antioch. Three major crusader armies departed for the Holy Land in 1189–1190. Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s crusade ended abruptly in June 1190 when he drowned in the Saleph River in Anatolia. Only fragments of his army reached Outremer. Philip II of France landed at Acre in April 1191, and Richard I of England arrived in May. During his voyage, Richard had seized Cyprus from the island&#x27;s self-declared emperor Isaac Komnenos. Guy and Conrad had reconciled, but their conflict returned when Sybilla of Jerusalem and her two daughters by Guy died. Conrad married the reluctant Isabella, Sybilla&#x27;s half-sister and heir, despite her marriage to Humphrey of Toron, and gossip about his two living wives.

After an attritional siege, the Muslim garrison surrendered Acre, and Philip and most of the French army returned to Europe. Richard led the crusade to victory at Arsuf, capturing Jaffa, Ascalon and Darum. Internal dissension forced Richard to abandon Guy and accept Conrad&#x27;s kingship. Guy was compensated with possession of Cyprus. In April 1192, Conrad was assassinated in Tyre. Within a week, the widowed Isabella was married to Henry, Count of Champagne. Saladin did not risk a defeat in a pitched battle, and Richard feared the exhausting march across arid lands towards Jerusalem. As he fell ill and needed to return home to attend to his affairs, a three-year truce was agreed in September 1192. The Franks kept land between Tyre and Jaffa, but dismantled Ascalon; Christian pilgrimages to Jerusalem were allowed. Frankish confidence in the truce was not high. In April 1193, Geoffroy de Donjon, head of the Knights Hospitaller, wrote in a letter, &#x27;We know for certain that since the loss of the land the inheritance of Christ cannot easily be regained. The land held by the Christians during the truces remains virtually uninhabited.&#x27; The Franks&#x27; strategic position was not necessarily detrimental: they kept the coastal towns and their frontiers shortened. Their enclaves represented a minor threat to the Ayyubids&#x27; empire in comparison with the Artuqids, Zengids, Seljuks of Rum, Cilician Armenians or Georgians in the north. After Saladin died in March 1193, none of his sons could assume authority over his Ayyubid relatives, and the dynastic feud lasted for almost a decade. The Ayyubids agreed near-constant truces with the Franks and offered territorial concessions to keep the peace.
BohemondIII of Antioch did not include his recalcitrant Cilician Armenian vassal Leo in his truce with Saladin in 1192. Leo was RubenIII&#x27;s brother. When Ruben died, Leo replaced his daughter and heir, Alice. In 1191, Saladin abandoned a three-year occupation of the northern Syrian castle of Bagras, and Leo seized it, ignoring claims of the Templars and Bohemond. In 1194, Bohemond accepted Leo&#x27;s invitation to discuss Bagras&#x27; return, but Leo imprisoned him, demanding Antioch for his release. The Greek population and the Italian community rejected the Armenians, and formed a commune under Bohemond&#x27;s eldest son, Raymond. Bohemond was released when he abandoned his claims on Cilicia, forfeiting Bagras and marrying Raymond to Alice. Any male heir of this marriage was expected to be the heir to both Antioch and Armenia. When Raymond died in 1197, Bohemond sent Alice and Raymond&#x27;s posthumous son Raymond-Roupen to Cilicia. Raymond&#x27;s younger brother BohemondIV came to Antioch, and the commune recognised him as their father&#x27;s heir. In September 1197, Henry of Champagne died after falling out a palace window in the kingdom&#x27;s new capital Acre. The widowed Isabella married Aimery of Lusignan who had succeeded Guy in Cyprus. Saladin&#x27;s ambitious brother Al-Adil I, reunited Egypt and Damascus under his rule by 1200. He expanded the truces with the Franks and enhanced commercial contacts with Venice and Pisa. Bohemond III died in 1201. The commune of Antioch renewed its allegiance to BohemondIV, although several nobles felt compelled to support Raymond-Roupen and joined him in Cilicia. Leo of Cilicia launched a series of military campaigns to assert Raymond-Roupen&#x27;s claim to Antioch. Bohemond made alliances with Saladin&#x27;s son, Az-Zahir Ghazi of Aleppo, and with SuleimanII, the Sultan of Rum. As neither Bohemond nor Leo could muster enough troops to defend their Tripolitan or Cilician hinterland against enemy invasions or rebellious aristocrats and to garrison Antioch simultaneously, the War of the Antiochene Succession lasted for more than a decade.

The Franks knew they could not regain the Holy Land without conquering Egypt. The leaders of the Fourth Crusade planned an invasion of Egypt but sacked Constantinople instead. Aimery and Isabella died in 1205. Isabella&#x27;s daughter by Conrad, Maria of Montferrat, succeeded, and Isabella&#x27;s half-brother, John of Ibelin, became regent. The regency ended with Maria&#x27;s marriage in 1210 to John of Brienne, a French aristocrat and experienced soldier. After her death two years later, John ruled as regent for their infant daughter, IsabellaII. He participated in a military campaign against Cilicia, but it did not damage Leo&#x27;s power. Leo and Raymond-Roupen had exhausted Antioch with destructive raids and occupied the city in 1216. Raymond-Roupen was installed as prince and Leo restored Bagras to the Templars. Raymond-Roupen could not pay for the aristocrats&#x27; loyalty in his impoverished principality and Bohemond regained Antioch with local support in 1219. The personal union between Antioch and Tripoli proved lasting, but in fact both crusader states disintegrated into small city-states. Raymond-Roupen fled to Cilicia, seeking Leo&#x27;s support, and when Leo died in May, attempted to gain the throne against Leo&#x27;s infant daughter Isabella.

John of Brienne was leader of a gathering crusade but FrederickII, the ruler of Germany and Sicily, was expected to assume control on his arrival; the papal legate, Cardinal Pelagius, controlled the finances from the west. The crusaders invaded Egypt and captured Damietta in November 1219. The new sultan of Egypt Al-Kamil repeatedly offered the return of Jerusalem and the Holy Land in exchange for the crusaders&#x27; withdrawal. His ability to implement his truce proposals was questionable for his brother Al-Mu&#x27;azzam Isa ruled the Holy Land. The crusaders knew that their hold on the territory would not be secure as long as the castles in Oultrejourdain remained in Muslim hands. Prophecies about their inevitable victory spread in their camp, and Al-Adil&#x27;s offer was rejected. After twenty-one months of stalemate, the crusaders marched on Cairo before being trapped between the Nile floods and the Egyptian army. The crusaders surrendered Damietta in return for safe conduct, ending the crusade. While staying in Damietta, Cardinal Pelagius sent reinforcements to Raymond-Roupen in Cilicia, but Constantine of Baberon, who was regent for the Cilician queen, acted quickly. He captured Raymond-Roupen, who died in prison. The queen was married to Bohemond&#x27;s son, Philip to cement an alliance between Cilicia and Antioch. A feud between the two nations broke out again after neglected Armenian aristocrats murdered Philip in late 1224. An alliance between the Armenians and his former Ayyubid allies in Aleppo foiled Bohemond&#x27;s attempts at revenge.


Frederick renewed his crusader oath on his imperial coronation in Rome in 1220. He did not join the Egyptian crusade but reopened the negotiations with Al-Adil over the city of Jerusalem. In 1225, Frederick married IsabellaII and assumed the title of king of Jerusalem. Two years later, Al-Adil promised to abandon all lands conquered by Saladin in return for Frankish support against Al-Mu&#x27;azzam. An epidemic prevented Frederick&#x27;s departure for a crusade, and Pope Gregory IX excommunicated him for repeatedly breaking his oath. In April 1228, Isabella died after giving birth to Conrad. Without seeking a reconciliation with the Pope, Frederick sailed for the crusade. His attempts to confiscate baronial fiefs brought him into conflict with the Frankish aristocrats. As Al-Mua&#x27;zzam had died, Frederick made the most of his diplomatic skills to achieve the partial implementation of Al-Adil&#x27;s previous promise. They signed a truce for ten years, ten months, and ten days (the maximum period for a peace treaty between Muslims and Christians, according to Muslim custom). It restored Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Nazareth and Sidon to the Franks while granting Temple Mount to the Muslims. The native Franks were unenthusiastic about the treaty because it was questionable whether it could be defended. Frederick left for Italy in May 1229, and never returned. He sent Richard Filangieri, with an army, to rule the kingdom of Jerusalem as his . The Ibelins denied Frederick&#x27;s right to appoint his lieutenant without consulting the barons, and Outremer plunged into a civil war, known as the War of the Lombards. Filangieri occupied Beirut and Tyre, but the Ibelins and their allies firmly kept Acre and established a commune to protect their interest. Pope Gregory IX called for a new crusade in preparation for the expiry of the truce. Between 1239 and 1241, wealthy French and English nobles like Theobald I of Navarre and Richard of Cornwall led separate military campaigns to the Holy Land. They followed Frederick&#x27;s tactics of forceful diplomacy and played rival factions off against each other in the succession disputes that followed Al-Kamil&#x27;s death. Richard&#x27;s treaty with Al-Kamil&#x27;s son, As-Salih Ayyub, restored most land west of the Jordan River to the Franks. Conrad reached the age of majority in 1243 but failed to visit Outremer. Arguing that Conrad&#x27;s heir presumptive was entitled to rule in his absence, the Jerusalemite barons elected his mother&#x27;s maternal aunt, Alice of Champagne, as regent. The same year, they captured Tyre, the last centre of Frederick&#x27;s authority in the kingdom.

===Destruction by the Mamluks (1244 to 1291)===
The Mongol Empire&#x27;s westward expansion reached the Middle East when the Mongols conquered the Khwarazmian Empire in Central Asia in 1227. Part of the Khwarazmian army fled to eastern Anatolia and these masterless Turkic soldiers offered their services to the neighbouring rulers for pay. Western Christians regarded the Mongols as potential allies against the Muslims because some Mongol tribes adhered to Nestorian Christianity. In fact, most Mongols were pagans with a strong belief in their Great Khan&#x27;s divine right to universal rule, and they demanded unconditional submission from both Christians and Muslims. As-Salih Ayyub hired the Khwarazmians and garrisoned new troops in Egypt, alarming his uncle As-Salih Ismail, Emir of Damascus. Ismail bought the Franks&#x27; alliance by a promise to restore &#x27;all the lands that Saladin had reconquered&#x27;. Catholic priests took possession of the Dome of the Rock, but in July 1244 Khwarazmians marching towards Egypt sacked Jerusalem unexpectedly. The Franks gathered all available troops and joined Ismail near Gaza, but the Khwarazmians and Egyptians defeated the Frankish and Damascene coalition at La Forbie on 18 October. Few Franks escaped from the battlefield. As-Salah captured most of the crusaders&#x27; mainland territory, restricting the Franks to a few coastal towns. Louis IX of France launched a failed crusade against Egypt in 1249. He was captured near Damietta with the remnants of his army, and ransomed days after the Bahri Mamluks assumed power in Egypt through murdering As-Salih&#x27;s son Al-Muazzam Turanshah in May 1250. Louis spent four more years in Outremer. As the kingdom&#x27;s effective ruler, he conducted negotiations with both the Syrian Ayyubids and the Egyptian Mamluks and refortified the coastal towns. He sent an embassy from Acre to the Great Khan Güyük, offering an anti-Muslim alliance to the Mongols.
Feuds between rival candidates to the regency and commercial conflicts between Venice and Genoa resulted in a new civil war in 1256 known as the War of Saint Sabas. The pro-Venetian Bohemond VI&#x27;s conflict with his Genoese vassals the Embriaci brought the war to Tripoli and Antioch. In 1258, the Hulagu, younger brother of the Great Khan Möngke, sacked Baghdad and ended the Abbasid Caliphate. Two years later, Hethum I of Cilicia and Bohemond VI joined forces with the Mongols in the sack of Aleppo, when Bohemond set fire to its mosque, and in the conquest of northern Syria. The Mongols emancipated the Christians from their status, and the local Christian population cooperated with the conquerors. Jerusalem remained neutral when the Mamluks of Egypt moved to confront the Mongols after Hulagu, and much of his force moved east on the death of Möngke to address the Mongol succession. The Mamluks defeated the greatly reduced Mongol army at Ain Jalut. On their return, the Mamluk sultan Qutuz was assassinated and replaced by the general Baibars. Baibars revived Saladin&#x27;s empire by uniting Egypt and Syria and held Hulagu in check through an alliance with the Mongols of the Golden Horde. He reformed governance in Egypt, giving power to the elite . The Franks did not have the military capability to resist this new threat. A Mongol garrison was stationed at Antioch, and individual Frankish barons concluded separate truces with Baibars. Determined to conquer the crusader states, he captured Caesarea and Arsuf in 1265 and Safed in 1266, and sacked Antioch in 1268. Jaffa surrendered and Baibers weakened the military orders by capturing the castles of Krak des Chevaliers and Montfort before returning his attention to the Mongols of the Ilkhanate for the rest of his life. Massacres of the Franks and native Christians regularly followed a Mamluk conquest.
In 1268, the new Sicilian king Charles I of Anjou executed Conradin, the titular king of Jerusalem, in Naples after his victory at Tagliacozzo. Isabella I&#x27;s great-grandson Hugh III of Cyprus and her granddaughter Maria of Antioch disputed the succession. The barons preferred Hugh, but in 1277 Maria sold her claim to Charles. He sent Roger of San Severino to act as . With the support of the Templars, he blocked Hugh&#x27;s access to Acre, forcing him to retreat to Cyprus, again leaving the kingdom without a resident monarch. The Mongols of the Ilkhanate sent embassies to Europe proposing anti-Mamluk alliances, but the major western rulers were reluctant to launch a new crusade for the Holy Land. The War of the Sicilian Vespers weakened Charles&#x27;s position in the west. After his death in 1285, Henry II of Cyprus was acknowledged as Jerusalem&#x27;s nominal king, but the rump kingdom was in fact a mosaic of autonomous lordships, some under Mamluk suzerainty. In 1285, the death of the warlike Abaqa, combined with the Pisan and Venetian wars with the Genoese, finally gave the Mamluk sultan, Al-Mansur Qalawun, the opportunity to expel the Franks. In 1289 he destroyed Genoese-held Tripoli, enslaving or killing its residents. In 1290, Italian crusaders broke his truce with Jerusalem by killing Muslim traders in Acre. Qalawun&#x27;s death did not hinder the successful Mamluk siege of the city in 1291. Those who could fled to Cyprus, while those who could not were slaughtered or sold into slavery. Without hope of support from the West, Tyre, Beirut, and Sidon all surrendered without a fight. The Mamluk policy was to destroy all physical evidence of the Franks; the destruction of the ports and fortified towns ruptured the history of a coastal city civilisation rooted in antiquity.

==Government and institutions==
Modern historiography has focused on the kingdom of Jerusalem. Possibly this is related to it being the objective of the First Crusade, as well as the perception of the city being the centre and chief city of medieval Christendom. However, research into the kingdom does not provide a comprehensive common template for the development of the other Latin settlements. Jerusalem&#x27;s royal administration was based in the city until it was lost, and then in Acre. It featured the typical household officers of most European rulers: a cleric-led chancery, constable, marshal, chamberlain, chancellor, seneschal and butler. Royal territory was directly administered by Viscounts. All tangible evidence of the written law was lost in 1187 when the Franks lost the city of Jerusalem to the Muslims. The courts of the princes of Antioch were similar and created the Italo-Norman laws that were also later adopted by Cilician Armenia, known as the Assizes of Antioch. These have survived in 13th-century Armenian translations. Relationships among Antioch&#x27;s various Frankish, Syrian, Greek, Jewish, Armenian, and Muslim inhabitants were generally good. The brief existence of the uniquely-landlocked Edessa means it is the least studied, but its history is traceable to Armenian and Syriac chronicles in addition to Latin sources. Like Jerusalem the political institutions appear to have reflected the northern French roots of the founders, although the membership of city councils included indigenous Christians. The population was diverse, including Armenian Orthodox, Greeks known as Melkites, Syrian Orthodox known as Jacobites, and Muslims. In Tripoli, the fourth Frankish state, Raymond of Saint-Gilles and his successors ruled directly over several towns, granting the rest as fiefs to lords originating in Languedoc and Provence, and Gibelet was given to the Genoese in return for naval support. In the 12thcentury this system provided a total of 300 knights, a much smaller army than Antioch or Jerusalem. Architectural and artistic activity in Lebanese churches provide evidence that the indigenous populations prospered under Frankish rule, in part due to its remoteness from the worst impacts of Saladin&#x27;s conquests in 1187–1188. These were Arabic-speaking Melkites, Monophysites, Nestorians, Syrians, and large numbers of Syriac-speaking Maronites with their own clerical hierarchies. The Greek Orthodox Church was restricted, as in Jerusalem. There were similar self-governing Muslim communities of Druze and Alawites, including Isma&#x27;ili, in the frontier areas to the north. The multi-ethnic structure may well have been more pronounced in Tripoli and in the 12thcentury there may have been a southern French culture, although this characteristic faded over time.

The king of Jerusalem&#x27;s foremost role was as leader of the feudal host during the near-constant warfare in the early decades of the 12thcentury. The kings rarely awarded land or lordships, and those they did frequently became vacant and reverted to the crown because of the high mortality rate. Their followers&#x27; loyalty was rewarded with city incomes. Through this, the domain of the first five rulers was larger than the combined holdings of the nobility. These kings of Jerusalem had greater internal power than comparative western monarchs, but they lacked the personnel and administrative systems necessary to govern such a large realm.
In the second quarter of the century, magnates like Raynald of Châtillon, Lord of Oultrejordain, and Raymond III, Count of Tripoli, Prince of Galilee, established baronial dynasties and often acted as autonomous rulers. Royal powers were done away with, and governance was undertaken within the feudatories. The remaining central control was exercised at the High Court or , which was also known in Latin as and , or in vernacular French as . These meetings were between king and tenants in chief. The duty of the vassal to give counsel developed into a privilege and then the monarch&#x27;s legitimacy depended on the court&#x27;s agreement. The High Court was the great barons&#x27; and the king&#x27;s direct vassals. It had a quorum of the king and three tenants-in-chief. In 1162, the (roughly, &#x27;Assize on liege-homage&#x27;) expanded the court&#x27;s membership to all 600 or more fief-holders. Those paying direct homage to the king became members of the . By the end of the 12thcentury, they were joined by the leaders of the military orders and in the 13thcentury the Italian communes. The leaders of the Third Crusade ignored the monarchy. The kings of England and France agreed on the division of future conquests, as if there was no need to consider the local nobility. Prawer felt the weakness of the crown of Jerusalem was demonstrated by the rapid offering of the throne to Conrad of Montferrat in 1190 and then Henry II, Count of Champagne, in 1192 although this was given legal effect by Baldwin IV&#x27;s will stipulating if Baldwin V died a minor, the pope, the kings of England and France, and the Holy Roman Emperor would decide the succession.
Prior to the 1187 defeat at Hattin, laws developed by the court were recorded as in &quot;Letters of the Holy Sepulchre&quot;. All written law was lost in the fall of Jerusalem. The legal system was now largely based on custom and the memory of the lost legislation. The renowned jurist Philip of Novara lamented, &#x27;We know [the laws] rather poorly, for they are known by hearsay and usage...and we think an assize is something we have seen as an assize...in the kingdom of Jerusalem [the barons] made much better use of the laws and acted on them more surely before the land was lost.&#x27; An idyllic view of the early 12thcentury legal system was created. The barons reinterpreted the —which Almalric I intended to strengthen the crown—to constrain the monarch instead, particularly regarding the monarch&#x27;s right to confiscate feudal fiefs without trial. The loss of the vast majority of rural fiefs led the baronage to evolve into an urban mercantile class where knowledge of the law was a valuable, well-regarded skill and a career path to higher status.
After Hattin, the Franks lost their cities, lands, and churches. Barons fled to Cyprus and intermarried with leading new emigres from the Lusignan, Montbéliard, Brienne and Montfort families. This created a separate class—the remnants of the old nobility with a limited understanding of the Latin East. This included the king-consorts Guy, Conrad, Henry, Aimery, John, and the absent Hohenstaufen dynasty that followed. The barons of Jerusalem in the 13thcentury have been poorly regarded by both contemporary and modern commentators: their superficial rhetoric disgusted Jacques de Vitry; Riley-Smith writes of their pedantry and the use of spurious legal justification for political action. The barons valued this ability to articulate the law. This is evidenced by the elaborate and impressive treatises of the baronial jurists from the second half of the 13thcentury.
From May 1229, when Frederick II left the Holy Land to defend his Italian and German lands, monarchs were absent. Conrad was titular king from 1225 until 1254, and his son Conradin until 1268 when Charles of Anjou executed him. The monarchy of Jerusalem had limited power in comparison with the West, where rulers developed bureaucratic machinery for administration, jurisdiction, and legislation through which they exercised control. In 1242 the Barons prevailed and appointed a succession of Ibelin and Cypriot regents. Centralised government collapsed in the face of independence exercised by the nobility, military orders, and Italian communes. The three Cypriot Lusignan kings who succeeded lacked the resources to recover the lost territory. One claimant sold the title of king to Charles of Anjou. He gained power for a short while but never visited the kingdom.

==Military==

===Size and recruitment===

All estimates of the size of Frankish and Muslim armies are uncertain; existing accounts indicate that it is probable that the Franks of Outremer raised the largest armies in the Catholic world. As early as 1111, the four crusader states fielded 16,000 troops to launch a joint military campaign against Shaizar. Edessa and Tripoli raised armies numbering 1,000–3,000 troops, Antioch and Jerusalem deployed 4,000–6,000 soldiers. In comparison, William the Conqueror commanded 5,000–7,000 troops at Hastings and 12,000 crusaders fought against the Moors at Las Navas de Tolosa in Iberia. Among the Franks&#x27; early enemies, the Fatimids possessed 10,000–12,000 troops, the rulers of Aleppo had 7,000–8,000 soldiers, and the Damascene commanded 2,000–5,000 troops. The Artuqids could hire as many as 30,000 Turks, but these nomadic warriors were unfit for lengthy sieges. After uniting Egypt, Syria, and much of Iraq, Saladin raised armies around 20,000 strong. Egyptian money and Syrian manpower represented the two critical factors underpinning Saladin&#x27;s military might during the period. In response, the Franks quickly increased their military force up to around 18,000 troops by 1183, but not without implementing austerity measures. In the 13th century, the control of Acre&#x27;s lucrative commerce provided the resources to maintain sizeable armies. At La Forbie, 16,000 Frankish warriors perished in the battlefield, but this was the last occasion when a united Jerusalemite army fought a pitched battle. During the 1291 siege of Acre, about 15,000 Frankish troops defended the city against more than 60,000 Mamluk warriors.

The crusader states&#x27; military power depended mainly on four major categories of soldiery: vassals, mercenaries, visitors from the west, and troops provided by the military orders. Vassals were expected to perform their military duties in person as fully armed knights, or more lightly armoured . Unmarried female fief holders had to hire mercenaries; their wards represented underage vassals. Disabled men and men over sixty were required to cede their horses and arms to their lords. Vassals who owed the service of more than one soldier had to mobilise their own vassals or employ mercenaries. A feudal lord&#x27;s army could be sizeable. For example, 60 cavalrymen and 100 footmen accompanied Richard of Salerno, then lord of Marash, during a joint Antiochene–Edessene campaign against Mawdud in 1111. Complaints about Frankish rulers&#x27; difficulties in paying off their troops abound, showing the importance of mercenary troops in Levantine warfare. Mercenaries were hired regularly for military campaigns, for garrisoning forts and particularly in Antioch, for serving in the prince&#x27;s armed retinue. The crusader states could have hardly survived without constant support from the west. Armed pilgrims arriving at moments of crisis could save the day, like those who landed just after Baldwin I&#x27;s defeat at Ramla in 1102. Westerners were unwilling to accept the Frankish leaders&#x27; authority.

===Military orders===
The military orders emerged as a new form of religious organisation in response to the unstable conditions at western Christendom&#x27;s borderlands. The first of them, the Knights Templar, developed from a knightly brotherhood attached to the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. Around 1119, the knights took the monastic vows of chastity, poverty, and obedience and committed themselves to the armed protection of pilgrims visiting Jerusalem. This unusual combination of monastic and knightly ideas did not meet with general approval, but the Templars found an influential protector in the prominent Cistercian abbot Bernard of Clairvaux. Their monastic rule was confirmed at the Council of Troyes in France in 1129. The name derives from Solomon&#x27;s Temple, the Frankish name for the Al-Aqsa Mosque where they established their first headquarters. The Templars&#x27; commitment to the defence of fellow Christians proved an attractive idea, stimulating the establishment of new military orders, in Outremer always by the militarisation of charitable organisations. The Hospitallers represents the earliest example. Originally a nursing confraternity at a Jerusalemite hospital founded by merchants from Amalfi, they assumed military functions in the 1130s. Three further military orders followed in the Levant: the Order of Saint Lazarus mainly for leper knights in the 1130s, the German Order of Teutonic Knights in 1198, and the English Order of St Thomas of Acre in 1228.

As frequent beneficiaries of pious donations across Europe and the Levant, the Hospitallers, Templars, and to a lesser extent the Teutonic Knights accumulated considerable wealth. They administered their scattered estates through an extensive network of branch houses, each required to transfer a part—generally one-third—of its revenues to the Jerusalemite headquarters. As the regular transfer of goods and money required the development of complex logistical and financial systems, the three orders operated as early forms of supranational trading houses and credit institutions. Their networks facilitated international money transfers, because funds deposited in a branch could be paid out in another, and loans granted in one country could be repaid in another. The Hospitallers never abandoned charitable work. In Jerusalem, their hospital served hundreds of patients of all religions and genders. Pilgrims, pregnant women, abandoned children, and impoverished people could also enlist their aid. However, waging war against infidels remained the military orders&#x27; prime obligation. As an early example of a standing army, they had a pivotal role in the crusader states&#x27; defence. The knight-brothers and their armed servants were professional soldiers under monastic vows. They wore a habit, always with a cross on it, and showing its wearer&#x27;s rank. As lay rulers and aristocrats seldom had the funds to cover all costs of border defence, they eagerly ceded their border forts to the military orders. The earliest examples include Beth Gibelin in Jerusalem, and Krak des Chevaliers in Tripoli, both seized by the Hospitallers.

===Combat arms and tactics===

Companies of highly trained mounted knights made up the central element of Frankish armies. Their military expertise and outstanding unit cohesion distinguished them from the Byzantine and Muslim heavy cavalry. Frankish foot soldiers were disciplined to cooperate closely with the knights and to defend them against attacks by the Turkic light cavalry. The Frankish armies&#x27; distinctive feature was the extensive deployment of foot soldiers equipped with crossbows; Muslim commanders employed crossbowmen almost exclusively in a siege situation. Native Christians and converted Turks along with some Franks served as lightly armoured cavalrymen, called turcopoles. They were positioned to fight against the Turkic light cavalry and were well suited for raids.

The Frankish knights fought in close order formation and applied tactics to enhance the impact of a cavalry charge. Examples include surprise attacks at dawn and chasing herds of cattle towards an enemy camp. During a Frankish cavalry charge, the Muslim troops attempted to avoid a direct clash until the knights were separated from the infantry and their horses became exhausted. Frankish foot soldiers could create a &#x27;shield-roof&#x27; against the rain of Turkish arrows. Feigned retreat was a tactic used by both Muslim and Frankish troops, although Christian chroniclers considered it shameful. In a siege situation, the Franks avoided direct assaults. Instead, they imposed a blockade on the besieged town and starved the defenders into submission. By contrast, Muslim commanders preferred direct attacks as they could easily muster new troops to replace those who had perished. Both sides employed similar siege engines, including wooden siege towers, battering rams, mangonels, and from the 1150s large trebuchets. The extensive use of carrier pigeons and signal fires was an important element of Muslim warfare. As Muslim commanders were informed of the Franks&#x27; movements in time, they could intercept Frankish invaders unexpectedly. In comparison with contemporaneous Europe, battles were not uncommon in Outremer. The Franks fought battles mainly in defensive situations. They adopted delaying tactics only when they obviously had no chance to defeat a large invading force, like during Saladin&#x27;s invasion of Antioch in 1187 and Mamluk attacks against Outremer in the 1260s. While on the offensive, the Franks typically risked pitched battles if they could gain substantial territory and a local faction supported their campaign.

===Weakness and decline===

As the Franks were unable to absorb casualties as effectively as their enemies, a defeat in a major battle could put the very existence of a crusader state at risk. Examples include the shrinking of Antiochene territory after the defeat of an Antiochene–Edessene coalition at the Battle of Harran in 1104 and the territorial consequences of Saladin&#x27;s triumph at Hattin. From the 1150s, observers like the chroniclers Michael the Syrian and Ali ibn al-Athir concluded that the Franks&#x27; military skills had weakened. In fact, the Franks could still launch long-distance campaigns against Egypt and resist enemy attacks without adequate provisions for days. Consequently, as historian Nicholas Morton proposes, their defeats could more likely be attributed to their enemies&#x27; flexibility. The Muslims had learnt how to solve their own shortcomings and take advantage of the Franks&#x27; weaknesses. Muslim rulers intensified jihād propaganda to curb ethnic tensions, while disputes between Frankish and western commanders prevented their effective cooperation. The Muslim commanders adopted new tactics against the heavily armoured knights, like the sudden division of their ranks during a cavalry charge. In contrast, the Franks could not compete with their enemies&#x27; swiftness. In a siege situation, they insisted on the deployment of siege towers, although a tower&#x27;s construction lasted for four to six weeks, and during this period, relief forces could reach the besieged town or fortress. By contrast, the Muslims preferred quick mining operations like digging under ramparts or burning walls.

==Demography==

Without solid documentary basis modern calculations about the size of the crusader states&#x27; population are only guesswork. Medieval chronicles contain demographic data, but they mostly present exaggerated numbers, without differentiating Franks and native Christians. Calculations about the population of a town are based on reports of a siege when refugees from nearby villages had multiplied it. Estimations of the number of Franks in Outremer range between 120,000 and 300,000. If these numbers are credible, Franks made up at least 15% of the crusader states&#x27; total population.

In context, Josiah Russell estimates the population of what he calls &#x27;Islamic territory&#x27; as roughly 12.5 million in 1000—Anatolia 8 million, Syria 2 million, Egypt 1.5  million and North Africa 1 million—with the European areas that provided crusaders having a population of 23.7 million. He estimates that by 1200 these figures had risen to 13.7 million in Islamic territory—Anatolia 7 million, Syria 2.7 million, Egypt 2.5 million and North Africa 1.5 million—while the crusaders&#x27; home countries&#x27; population was 35.6 million. Russell also acknowledges that much of Anatolia was Christian or under the Byzantines and that some purportedly Islamic areas such as Mosul and Baghdad also had significant Christian populations.

Immigration from Catholic Europe was continuous till the end of the crusader states. Although most colonists settled in the coastal cities, the Franks&#x27; presence is documented in more than 200 villages (about 15% of all rural settlements) in the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Some Frankish rural settlements were planned villages, established to encourage settlers from the West; some were shared with native Christians. The native Jewish population was concentrated in the four holy cities of Jerusalem, Hebron, Safed and Tiberias. From the late 12th century refugees from territories lost to the Muslims increased the Christian population of the coastal cities, but emigration to Cyprus or Frankish Greece can also be detected. The expansion of the urban population is most obvious at Acre where a new suburb developed following the Third Crusade. Emigration from Outremer intensified from the 1240s as prospects of the crusader states&#x27; survival darkened. In this period, a massive influx of Frankish and native Christian refugees to Cyprus is well documented. Franks who did not flee could survive the Mamluk conquest as slaves or renegades: a Franciscan friar met with Frankish prisoners of war and converts to Islam at Acre more than a decade after the fall of the city.

Immigration from Jewish communities in Europe also increased from this period due to the travel routes having been opened up by Christian pilgrims. For example, in 1211 hundreds of Rabbis immigrated to the Crusader state.

==Society==

Modern research indicates that Jews, Muslims and local Christian populations were less integrated than previously thought. Christians lived around Jerusalem and in an arc stretching from Jericho and the Jordan River to Hebron in the south. Comparisons of archaeological evidence of Byzantine churches built prior to the Muslim conquest and 16thcentury Ottoman census records shows some Greek Orthodox communities disappeared before the crusades, but most continued during and for centuries after. Maronites were concentrated in Tripoli; Jacobites in Antioch and Edessa. Armenians were concentrated in the north, but communities existed in all major towns. Central areas had a predominantly Sunni Muslim population, but Shi&#x27;ite communities existed in Galilee. Muslim Druze lived in the mountains of Tripoli. Jews lived in coastal towns and some Galilean towns and in the holy cities Jerusalem, Safed, Hebron and Tiberias. . Little research has been done on Islamic conversion, but the available evidence led Ellenblum to believe that around Nablus and Jerusalem Christians remained a majority.
Most of the indigenous population were peasants living off the land. Charters from the early 12thcentury show evidence of the donation of local villeins (free serfs) to nobles and religious institutions. This may have been a method of denoting the revenues from these villeins or land where the boundaries were unclear. These are described as , for Christians or for Muslims. The term was reserved for the many urban domestic slaves the Franks held. The use of is thought to reflect the higher status that villagers or serfs held in the near East; indigenous men were considered to have servile land tenures rather than lacking personal freedom. Villeins&#x27; status differed from Western serfs as they could marry outside their lords&#x27; domain, were not obliged to perform unpaid labour, could hold land and inherit property. However, Franks needed to maintain productivity, so the villagers were tied to the land. Charters show landholders agreeing to return any villeins from other landholders they found on their property. Peasants were required to pay the lord one quarter to a half of crop yields. The Muslim pilgrim Ibn Jubayr reported there was a poll tax of one dinar and five qirat per head and a tax on produce from trees. 13thcentury charters indicate this increased after the loss of the first kingdom to redress the Franks&#x27; lost income. Historian Christopher MacEvitt cites these as reasons that the term &quot;indentured peasant&quot; is a more accurate description for the villagers in the Latin East than serf.
Linguistic differences remained a key differentiator between the Franks&#x27; lords and the local population. The Franks typically spoke Old French and wrote in Latin. While some learnt Arabic, Greek, Armenian, Syriac and Hebrew, this was unusual. Society was politically and legally stratified. Ethnically based communities were self-governing with relations between communities controlled by the Franks. Research has focused on the role of the , Arabic for leader, chief or mayor. Riley-Smith divided these into the urban freemen and rural workers tied to the land; &quot;ruʾasāʾ&quot; administered the Frankish estates, governed the native communities, and were often respected local landowners. If communities were segregated, as indicated by the written evidence and identified by Riley-Smith and Prawer, inter-communal conflict was avoided and interaction between the landed and the peasants limited. McEvitt identifies possible tension between competing groups. According to the 13thcentury jurists, in the towns the presided over the &quot;Cour des Syriens&quot; and there is other evidence they led local troops occasionally. The courts of the indigenous communities administered civil disputes and minor criminality. The Frankish —courts of the burgesses, which is the name given to non-noble Franks, dealt with more serious offences and cases involving Franks. The level of assimilation is difficult to identify, as there is little material evidence. The archaeology is culturally exclusive and written evidence indicates deep religious divisions. Some historians assume the states&#x27; heterogeneity eroded formal apartheid. The key differentiator in status and economic position was between urban and rural dwellers. Indigenous Christians could gain higher status and acquire wealth through commerce and industry in towns, but few Muslims lived in urban areas except those in servitude.
Frankish royalty reflected the region&#x27;s diversity. Queen Melisende was part Armenian and married Fulk from Anjou. Their son Amalric married a Frank from the Levant before marrying a Byzantine Greek. The nobility&#x27;s use of Jewish, Syrian, and Muslim physicians appalled William of Tyre. Antioch became a centre of cultural interchange through Greek- and Arabic-speaking Christians. The indigenous peoples showed the Frankish nobility traditional deference and in return Franks adopted their dress, food, housing, and military techniques. However, Frankish society was not a cultural melting pot. Inter-communal relations were shallow, identities separate, and the other communities considered alien.

==Economy==
The crusader states were economic centres obstructing Muslim trade by sea with the west Europe, and by land with Mesopotamia, Syria and the urban economies of the Nile. Commerce continued with the coastal cities providing maritime outlets for the Islamic hinterland, and unprecedented volumes of eastern wares were exported to Europe. Byzantine-Muslim mercantile growth may well have occurred in the 12thand13thcenturies, but it is likely that the Crusades hastened this. Western European populations and economies were booming, creating a growing social class that wanted artisanal products and eastern imports. European fleets expanded with better ships, navigation improved, and fare-paying pilgrims subsidised voyages. Largely indigenous agricultural production flourished before the fall of the First Kingdom in 1187 but was negligible afterwards. Franks, Muslims, Jews and indigenous Christians traded crafts in the souks—teeming oriental bazaars of the cities.
Olives, grapes, wheat, and barley were the important agricultural products before Saladin&#x27;s conquests. Glass making and soap production were major industries in towns. Italians, Provençals, and Catalans monopolised shipping, imports, exports, transportation, and banking. Taxes on trade, markets, pilgrims, and industry combined with estate revenue to provide the Frankish nobles and church with income. Seigniorial monopolies, or &quot;bans&quot;, compelled the use of landowners&#x27; mills, ovens and other facilities. The presence of hand-mills in most households is evidence of the serfs&#x27; circumvention of some monopolies. The centres of production were Antioch, Tripoli, Tyre, and Beirut. Textiles, with silk particularly prized, glass, dyestuffs, olives, wine, sesame oil, and sugar were exported.
The Franks provided an import market for clothing and finished goods. They adopted the more monetised indigenous economic system using a hybrid coinage of northern Italian and southern French silver European coins; Frankish copper coins minted in Arabic and Byzantine styles; and silver and gold dirhams and dinars. After 1124, the Franks copied Egyptian dinars, creating Jerusalem&#x27;s gold bezant. Following the collapse of the first kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187, trade replaced agriculture in the economy, and the circulation of Western European coins predominated. Although Tyre, Sidon and Beirut minted silver pennies and copper coins, there is little evidence of systematic attempts to create a unified currency.
The Italian maritime republics of Pisa, Venice, and Genoa were enthusiastic crusaders whose commercial wealth provided the Franks with financial foundations and naval resources. In return, these cities and others, like Amalfi, Barcelona, and Marseilles, received commercial rights and access to Eastern markets. Over time, this developed into colonial communities with property and jurisdiction. Largely located in the ports of Acre, Tyre, Tripoli, and Sidon, communes of Italians, Provençals, and Catalans had distinct cultures and exerted autonomous political power separate from the Franks. They remained intricately linked to their towns of origin, giving them monopolies over foreign trade, banking, and shipping. Opportunities to extend trade privileges were taken. In 1124, for example, the Venetians received one-third of Tyre and its territories with exemption from taxes in return for Venetian participation in the siege. These ports were unable to replace Alexandria and Constantinople as the major commercial centres of commerce but competed with monarchs and each other to maintain economic advantage. The number of communes never reached more than the hundreds. Their power derived from the support of home cities. By the mid-13thcentury, the rulers of the communes barely recognised the authority of the Franks and divided Acre into several fortified miniature republics.

==Art and architecture==

Prawer argued no major Western European cultural figure settled in the states, but that others were encouraged East by the expression of imagery in Western European poetry. Historians believe that military architecture demonstrates a synthesis of the European, Byzantine and Muslim traditions providing the original and impressive artistic achievement of the crusades. Castles were a symbol of the dominance of the Frankish minority over a hostile majority population that acted as administrative centres. 

Modern historiography rejects the 19th-century consensus that Westerner Europeans learnt the basis of military architecture from the Near East. Europe had already experienced growth in defensive technology. Contact with Arab fortifications originally constructed by the Byzantines influenced developments in the east, but there is little evidence for differentiation between design cultures and the constraints of situation. Castles included oriental design features like large water reservoirs and they excluded occidental features like moats. 

Church design was in the French Romanesque style seen in the 12th-century rebuilding of the Holy Sepulchre. The Franks retained earlier Byzantine detail, but added northern French, Aquitanian, and Provençal style arches and chapels. The column capitals of the south facade follow classical Syrian patterns, but there is little evidence of indigenous influence in sculpture.
Visual culture shows the assimilated nature of the society. The decoration of shrines, painting, and the production of manuscripts demonstrated the influence of indigenous artists. Frankish practitioners borrowed methods from Byzantine and indigenous artists in iconographical practice. Monumental and panel painting, mosaics and illuminations in manuscripts adopted an indigenous style, leading to a cultural synthesis shown in the Church of the Nativity. Wall mosaics were unknown in the west but widespread in the crusader states. It is unknown whether the mosaic work was done by indigenous craftsmen or learnt by Frankish ones, but it shows the evolution of a distinctive and original artistic style. 

Workshops housed Italian, French, English, and indigenous craftsmen producing illustrated manuscripts showing a cross-fertilisation of ideas and techniques. One example is the Melisende Psalter. This style either reflected or influenced the taste of patrons of the arts in increasingly stylised Byzantine-influenced content. Icons were previously unknown to the Franks. This continued, occasionally in a Frankish style, and of Western European saints leading to Italian panel painting. It is difficult to track illustration and castle design to their sources. It is simpler for textual sources where translations made in Antioch are notable but of secondary importance to the works from Muslim Spain and the hybrid culture of Sicily.

==Religion==
There is no written evidence that the Franks or local Christians recognised significant religious differences until the 13thcentury when the jurists used phrases like &quot;men not of the rule of Rome&quot;. The crusaders filled Greek Orthodox ecclesiastical positions that became vacant, such as on the death of Simeon II when the Frank Arnulf of Chocques succeeded him as patriarch of Jerusalem. The appointment of Latin bishops had little effect on the Arabic-speaking Orthodox Christians.

The previous bishops were foreign Byzantine Greeks. Greeks were used as coadjutor bishops to administer indigenous populations without clergy and in Latin, and Orthodox Christians often shared churches. In Antioch, Greeks occasionally replaced Latin patriarchs. In the town of Gaza, which was under control of the Templars but had previously been a bishopric, the Greek and Syrian population was given to the care of Meletos, bishop of Eleutheropolis. Thus, Meletos also acted as the recognised bishop of Gaza without the ecclesiastic complications that could have occurred had a bishop been assigned to a town ruled by a religious order. 

Toleration continued, but there was an interventionist papist response from Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Acre. Armenians, Copts, Jacobites, Nestorians and Maronites had greater religious autonomy independently appointing bishops, as they were considered outside the Catholic Church. The Franks had discriminatory laws against Jews and Muslims that prevented assimilation; overall their legal status was a Latin Christian adaptation of the dhimmi system. They were prevented from inhabiting Jerusalem, there were sumptuary laws that prevented them from wearing Frankish clothing, and the &quot;de jure&quot; punishment for sexual relations between Muslims and Christians was mutilation. Jews and Muslims retained autonomous systems of religious law. They were discriminated in civil and intercommunal law and had to pay a poll tax (&quot;capitātiō&quot;). Muslims were marginalised from townlife, but Muslim villagers under crusader dominion seem to have fared equally well as or perhaps better than their counterparts in Muslim lands and Bedouins had a privileged status. 

Some mosques were converted into Latin Christian churches, especially larger ones, but most remained in Muslim possession and sometimes Muslims could pray in portions of erstwhile mosques in certain places; one such personally experienced episode is described by Usama ibn Munqidh in the early 1140s. There was no forced conversion of Muslims as this would end peasants&#x27; servile status, moreover crusaders generally showed no interest in converting Jews, Muslims or Miaphysites to Latin Christianity. Followers of different religions also could engage in shared forms of folk religion, like at the Cave of the Patriarchs where the cultic site had however been divided.

==Legacy==
The Franks&#x27; habitual following of the customs of their Western European homeland meant that they made few lasting innovations. Three notable exceptions were the military orders, warfare innovations, and fortification developments. No major European poet, theologian, scholar, or historian settled in the region though new imagery and ideas in Western European poetry can be traced to some who visited as pilgrims. Although they did not migrate east themselves, their output often encouraged others to journey there on pilgrimage. Historians believe the crusader military architecture demonstrates a synthesis of the European, Byzantine, and Muslim traditions and that it is the most impressive artistic achievement of the crusades.

After Acre fell, the Hospitallers relocated first to Cyprus, then conquered and ruled Rhodes (13091522) and Malta (15301798). The Sovereign Military Order of Malta survives to the present-day. Philip IV of France probably had financial and political reasons to oppose the Knights Templar. He exerted pressure on Pope Clement V, who responded in 1312 by dissolving the order on probably false grounds of sodomy, magic, and heresy. The raising, transportation, and supply of armies led to flourishing trade between Europe and the crusader states. The Italian city-states of Genoa and Venice flourished through profitable trading communes. 

Many historians argue that the interaction between western Christian and Islamic cultures was a significant and ultimately positive influence on the development of European civilisation and the Renaissance. Relations between Europeans and the Islamic world stretched across the length of the Mediterranean Sea, making it difficult for historians to identify what proportion of cultural cross-fertilisation originated in the crusader states, Sicily and Spain.

==Historiography==
In the 19thcentury, the crusader states became a subject of study, distinct from the crusades, particularly in France. Joseph François Michaud&#x27;s influential narratives concentrated on topics of war, conquest, and settlement while France&#x27;s colonial ambitions in the Levant were linked explicitly. Emmanuel Guillaume-Rey&#x27;s described Frankish settlements in the Levant as colonies where the offspring of mixed marriages adopted local traditions.

The first American crusade historian, Dana Carleton Munro, described the care the Franks took to &quot;win the goodwill of the natives&quot;. Historians rejected this approach in the 20thcentury. R. C. Smail argued it identified an integrated society which did not exist to justify French colonialism. The new consensus was the society was segregated with limited social and cultural interchange. Focusing on evidence of social, legal, and political frameworks in Jerusalem, Joshua Prawer and Jonathan Riley-Smith presented the widely accepted view of a society that was predominantly urban, isolated from the indigenous peoples, with separate legal and religious systems.

Prawer&#x27;s 1972 work, &quot;The Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem: European Colonialism in the Middle Ages&quot;, extended this analysis: the lack of integration was based on economics with the Franks&#x27; position depending on a subjugated, disenfranchised local population. The Franks&#x27; primary motivations were economic. Islamic historian Carole Hillenbrand argued that the Islamic population responded with resentment, suspicion, and rejection of the Franks. 

This has been challenged by historians such as Ronnie Ellenblum using archaeological research, but no alternative model has been accepted. Christopher Tyerman points out this is not a return to older theories as the same sources are used and the archaeology is unprovable. Specialist Denys Pringle notes that it does not contradict the earlier view. Hans Eberhard Mayer had already advised that the number of Franks living in rural settlements should not be underestimated. 

These theories support the idea that the crusader states formed part of the wider expansion of Western Europe: driven by religious reform and growing papal power. However, historians argue there was no vigorous church reform in the East or resulting persecution of Jews and heretics. Some consider regulations from the 1120 Council of Nablus as exceptional and Benjamin Z. Kedar believed they followed Byzantine, rather than western reformist, precedent. The debate has led historians like Claude Cahen, Jean Richard, and Christopher MacEvitt to argue the history of the crusader states is distinct from the crusades, allowing the application of other analytical techniques that place the crusader states in the context of Near Eastern politics. These ideas are still in the process of articulation by modern historians.

<text>Ballot Measure 27 of 2002 would have required the mandatory labelling of all genetically modified food sold in the U.S. state of Oregon. The measure was defeated in the November 5, 2002 general election with 371,851 votes in favor, 886,806 votes against. The measure was placed on the ballot as a result of initiative petition.

Proponents of the measure argued that &quot;Oregonians should have the right to know what they are eating.&quot; They repeated the belief of some activists that genetic engineering of food poses a potential threat to health and safety. (See genetically modified food.) Proponents also ridiculed the cost estimates of the law brought by the measure&#x27;s opponents. Proponents hoped that an Oregon labeling law would spark debate about the use of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) in food and eventually a nationwide labelling system.

Opponents argued that Oregon&#x27;s agricultural industry would be burdened by excessive costs if the measure were to pass, given the lack of such a requirement throughout the rest of the United States. In addition, opponents claimed there was little evidence that GMO foods posed a danger to human health. Monsanto Company, an agricultural company whose products account for 70% of the GMO market, donated $1.5 million to the effort against the measure. Overall, opponents spent $5.5 million, tying an Oregon spending record.

<doc id="256362" wikidata="Q2158012" url="?curid=256362" title="Camille Lemonnier">
<text>Antoine Louis Camille Lemonnier (; 24 March 1844 – 13 June 1913) was a Belgian writer, poet and journalist. He was a member of the Symbolist &quot;La Jeune Belgique&quot; group, but his best known works are realist. His first work was &quot;Salon de Bruxelles&quot; (1863), a collection of art criticism. His best known novel is &quot;Un Mâle&quot; (1881).

==Biography==
Lemonnier was born in Ixelles, Brussels.

He studied law, and then took a clerkship in a government office, which he resigned after three years. He published a &quot;Salon de Bruxelles&quot; in 1863, and again in 1866. His early friendships were chiefly with artists; and he wrote art criticisms with recognized discernment. In 1868 he was a founding member of the Société Libre des Beaux-Arts, an avant-gardist group whose ideals he championed. Taking a house in the hills near Namur, he devoted himself to sport, and developed the intimate sympathy with nature which informs his best work. &quot;Nos Flamands&quot; (1869) and &quot;Croquis d&#x27;automne&quot; (1870) date from this time. &quot;Paris-Berlin&quot; (1870), a pamphlet pleading the cause of France, and full of the author&#x27;s horror of war, had a great success.

His capacity as a novelist, in the fresh, humorous description of peasant life, was revealed in &quot;Un Coin de village&quot; (1879). In &quot;Un Mâle&quot; (1881) he achieved a different kind of success. It deals with the amours of a poacher and a farmer&#x27;s daughter, with the forest as a background. Cachaprès, the poacher, seems the very embodiment of the wild life around him. The rejection of &quot;Un Mâle&quot; by the judges for the quinquennial prize of literature in 1883 made Lemonnier the centre of a school, inaugurated at a banquet given in his honour on 27 May 1883. &quot;Le Mort&quot; (1882), which describes the remorse of two peasants for a murder they have committed, provides a vivid representation of terror. It was remodelled as a tragedy in five acts (1899) by its author. &quot;Ceux de la glèbe&quot; (1889), dedicated to the &quot;children of the soil&quot;, was written in 1885.

He turned aside from local subjects for some time to produce a series of psychological novels, books of art criticism, etc., of considerable value, but assimilating more closely to French contemporary literature. The most striking of his later novels include &quot;Happe-chair&quot; (1886), often compared with Zola&#x27;s &quot;Germinal&quot;, &quot;L&#x27;Arche, journal d&#x27;une maman&quot; (1894) and &quot;Le Vent dans les moulins&quot; (1901), which returns to Flemish subjects.

In 1888 Lemonnier was prosecuted in Paris for offending against public morals by a story in &quot;Gil Blas&quot;, and was condemned to a fine. In a later prosecution at Brussels he was defended by Edmond Picard, and acquitted; and he was arraigned for a third time, at Bruges, for his &quot;L&#x27;Homme en amour&quot;, but again acquitted. He represented his own case in &quot;Les Deux consciences&quot; (1902). &quot;L&#x27;Ile vierge&quot; (1897) was the first of a trilogy to be called &quot;La Légende de la vie&quot;, which was to trace, under the fortunes of the hero, the pilgrimage of man through sorrow and sacrifice to the conception of the divinity within him. In &quot;Adam et Eve&quot; (1899) and &quot;Au Cœur frais de la forêt&quot; (1900), he preached the return to nature as the salvation not only of the individual but of the community. Among his other more important works are &quot;G. Courbet, et ses œuvres&quot; (1878); &quot;L&#x27;Histoire des Beaux-Arts en Belgique 1830–1887&quot; (1887); &quot;En Allemagne&quot; (1888), dealing especially with the Pinakothek at Munich; &quot;La Belgique&quot; (1888), an elaborate descriptive work with many illustrations; &quot;La Vie belge&quot; (1905); and &quot;Alfred Stevens et son œuvre&quot; (1906).

Lemonnier spent much time in Paris, and was one of the early contributors to the &quot;Mercure de France&quot;. He began to write at a time when Belgian letters lacked style; and with much toil, and some initial extravagances, he created a medium for the expression of his ideas. He explained something of the process in a preface contributed to Gustave Abel&#x27;s &quot;Labeur de la prose&quot; (1902). His prose is magnificent and sonorous, but abounds in neologisms and strange metaphors.

Rue Camille Lemonnier/Camille Lemonnierstraat in western Ixelles, is named in his honor.

<doc id="256363" wikidata="Q923592" url="?curid=256363" title="Experimental mathematics">
<text>Experimental mathematics is an approach to mathematics in which computation is used to investigate mathematical objects and identify properties and patterns. It has been defined as &quot;that branch of mathematics that concerns itself ultimately with the codification and transmission of insights within the mathematical community through the use of experimental (in either the Galilean, Baconian, Aristotelian or Kantian sense) exploration of conjectures and more informal beliefs and a careful analysis of the data acquired in this pursuit.&quot;

As expressed by Paul Halmos: &quot;Mathematics is not a deductive science—that&#x27;s a cliché. When you try to prove a theorem, you don&#x27;t just list the hypotheses, and then start to reason. What you do is trial and error, experimentation, guesswork. You want to find out what the facts are, and what you do is in that respect similar to what a laboratory technician does.&quot;

==History==
Mathematicians have always practiced experimental mathematics. Existing records of early mathematics, such as Babylonian mathematics, typically consist of lists of numerical examples illustrating algebraic identities. However, modern mathematics, beginning in the 17th century, developed a tradition of publishing results in a final, formal and abstract presentation. The numerical examples that may have led a mathematician to originally formulate a general theorem were not published, and were generally forgotten.

Experimental mathematics as a separate area of study re-emerged in the twentieth century, when the invention of the electronic computer vastly increased the range of feasible calculations, with a speed and precision far greater than anything available to previous generations of mathematicians. A significant milestone and achievement of experimental mathematics was the discovery in 1995 of the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula for the binary digits of π. This formula was discovered not by formal reasoning, but instead
by numerical searches on a computer; only afterwards was a rigorous proof found.

==Objectives and uses==
The objectives of experimental mathematics are &quot;to generate understanding and insight; to generate and confirm or confront conjectures; and generally to make mathematics more tangible, lively and fun for both the professional researcher and the novice&quot;.

The uses of experimental mathematics have been defined as follows:

#Gaining insight and intuition.
#Discovering new patterns and relationships.
#Using graphical displays to suggest underlying mathematical principles.
#Testing and especially falsifying conjectures.
#Exploring a possible result to see if it is worth formal proof.
#Suggesting approaches for formal proof.
#Replacing lengthy hand derivations with computer-based derivations.
#Confirming analytically derived results.

==Tools and techniques==
Experimental mathematics makes use of numerical methods to calculate approximate values for integrals and infinite series. Arbitrary precision arithmetic is often used to establish these values to a high degree of precision – typically 100 significant figures or more. Integer relation algorithms are then used to search for relations between these values and mathematical constants. Working with high precision values reduces the possibility of mistaking a mathematical coincidence for a true relation. A formal proof of a conjectured relation will then be sought – it is often easier to find a formal proof once the form of a conjectured relation is known.

If a counterexample is being sought or a large-scale proof by exhaustion is being attempted, distributed computing techniques may be used to divide the calculations between multiple computers.

Frequent use is made of general mathematical software or domain-specific software written for attacks on problems that require high efficiency. Experimental mathematics software usually includes error detection and correction mechanisms, integrity checks and redundant calculations designed to minimise the possibility of results being invalidated by a hardware or software error.

==Applications and examples==
Applications and examples of experimental mathematics include:

**Various proofs of the four colour theorem.
**Clement Lam&#x27;s proof of the non-existence of a finite projective plane of order 10.
**Gary McGuire proved a minimum uniquely solvable Sudoku requires 17 clues.
*Symbolic validation (via computer algebra) of conjectures to motivate the search for an analytical proof
**Solutions to a special case of the quantum three-body problem known as the hydrogen molecule-ion were found standard quantum chemistry basis sets before realizing they all lead to the same unique analytical solution in terms of a &quot;generalization&quot; of the Lambert W function. Related to this work is the isolation of a previously unknown link between gravity theory and quantum mechanics in lower dimensions (see quantum gravity and references therein).
**In the realm of relativistic many-bodied mechanics, namely the time-symmetric Wheeler–Feynman absorber theory: the equivalence between an advanced Liénard–Wiechert potential of particle &quot;j&quot; acting on particle &quot;i&quot; and the corresponding potential for particle &quot;i&quot; acting on particle &quot;j&quot; was demonstrated exhaustively to order formula_1 before being proved mathematically. The Wheeler-Feynman theory has regained interest because of quantum nonlocality.
**In the realm of linear optics, verification of the series expansion of the envelope of the electric field for ultrashort light pulses travelling in non isotropic media. Previous expansions had been incomplete: the outcome revealed an extra term vindicated by experiment.
*Evaluation of infinite series, infinite products and integrals (also see symbolic integration), typically by carrying out a high precision numerical calculation, and then using an integer relation algorithm (such as the Inverse Symbolic Calculator) to find a linear combination of mathematical constants that matches this value. For example, the following identity was rediscovered by Enrico Au-Yeung, a student of Jonathan Borwein using computer search and PSLQ algorithm in 1993:

::formula_2

*Visual investigations
**In Indra&#x27;s Pearls, David Mumford and others investigated various properties of Möbius transformation and the Schottky group using computer generated images of the groups which: &quot;furnished convincing evidence for many conjectures and lures to further exploration&quot;.

== Plausible but false examples ==
Some plausible relations hold to a high degree of accuracy, but are still not true. One example is:

:formula_3

The two sides of this expression actually differ after the 42nd decimal place.

Another example is that the maximum height (maximum absolute value of coefficients) of all the factors of &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; − 1 appears to be the same as the height of the &quot;n&quot;th cyclotomic polynomial. This was shown by computer to be true for &quot;n&quot; &lt; 10000 and was expected to be true for all &quot;n&quot;. However, a larger computer search showed that this equality fails to hold for &quot;n&quot; = 14235, when the height of the &quot;n&quot;th cyclotomic polynomial is 2, but maximum height of the factors is 3.

<doc id="256369" wikidata="Q273256" url="?curid=256369" title="Hakeem Olajuwon">
<text>Hakeem Abdul Olajuwon ( ; ; born January 21, 1963), nicknamed &quot;the Dream&quot;, is a Nigerian-American former professional basketball player. From 1984 to 2002, he played center in the National Basketball Association (NBA) for the Houston Rockets, and in his last season, the Toronto Raptors. He led the Rockets to back-to-back NBA championships in 1994 and 1995. Olajuwon was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame in 2008 and the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016. He is widely considered to be one of the greatest centers, as well as one of the greatest basketball players of all time.

Born in Lagos, Nigeria, Olajuwon traveled from his home country to play for the University of Houston under head coach Guy Lewis. His college career for the Cougars included three trips to the Final Four. Olajuwon was drafted by the Houston Rockets with the first overall selection of the 1984 NBA draft, a draft well known for its immense talent, which also included players such as Michael Jordan, Charles Barkley, and John Stockton. He combined with the Ralph Sampson to form a duo dubbed the &quot;Twin Towers&quot;. The two led the Rockets to the 1986 NBA Finals, where they lost in six games to the Boston Celtics. After Sampson was traded to the Golden State Warriors in 1988, Olajuwon became the Rockets&#x27; undisputed leader. He led the league in rebounding twice (1989, 1990) and blocks three times (1990, 1991, 1993).

Despite very nearly being traded during a bitter contract dispute before the 1992–93 season, he remained in Houston. He became the first non-American to be an NBA All-Star and start in an NBA All-Star Game, the first non-American to win the NBA MVP, the first non-American to win NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and, in the 1993–94 season, became the first player in NBA history to win the NBA&#x27;s MVP, Defensive Player of the Year, and Finals MVP awards in the same season. His Rockets won back-to-back championships. The Rockets&#x27; 1994 championship against the New York Knicks was the first in franchise history, with Olajuwon avenging his college championship loss to Patrick Ewing. The following year, after a lackluster regular season, Olajuwon&#x27;s Rockets swept Shaquille O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s Orlando Magic in 4 games in the NBA Finals. In 1996, Olajuwon was a member of the Olympic gold medal-winning United States national basketball team, and he was selected as one of the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History. In October 2021, Olajuwon was honored as one of the league&#x27;s greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team. He ended his career as the league&#x27;s all-time leader in blocks (3,830) and is one of four NBA players to record a quadruple-double.

==Early life==
Olajuwon was born to Salim and Abike Olajuwon, working-class Yoruba owners of a cement business in Lagos, Nigeria. He was the third of eight children. He credits his parents with instilling virtues of hard work and discipline into him and his siblings: &quot;They taught us to be honest, work hard, respect our elders, and believe in ourselves.&quot; Olajuwon has expressed displeasure at his childhood in Nigeria being characterized as backward. &quot;Lagos is a very cosmopolitan city ... There are many ethnic groups. I grew up in an environment at schools where there were all different types of people.&quot;

During his youth, Olajuwon was a soccer goalkeeper which helped give him the footwork and agility to balance his size and strength in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball until the age of 15 in high school, when he entered a local tournament while at the Muslim Teachers College in Lagos, Nigeria. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, he could initially not dunk the basketball.

Despite early struggles, Olajuwon said, &quot;Basketball is something that is so unique. That immediately I pick up the game and, you know, realize that this is the life for me. All the other sports just become obsolete.&quot;

==College career==
Olajuwon emigrated from Nigeria to play basketball at the University of Houston under Cougars coach Guy Lewis. Olajuwon was not highly recruited and was merely offered a visit to the university to work out for the coaching staff, based on a recommendation from a friend of Lewis who had seen Olajuwon play. He later recalled that when he originally arrived at the airport in 1980 for the visit, no representative of the school was there to greet him. When he called the staff, they told him to take a taxi out to the university.
After redshirting his freshman year in 1980–81 because he could not yet get clearance from the NCAA to play, Olajuwon came mostly off the bench and served as the Cougars&#x27; sixth man as a redshirt freshman in 1981–82, averaging 8.3 points, 6.2 rebounds and 2.5 blocks, shooting 60% from the field in 18 minutes per game as Houston was eliminated in the Final Four by the eventual NCAA champion, North Carolina. Olajuwon sought advice from the coaching staff about how to increase his playing time, and they advised him to work out with local Houston resident and multiple NBA MVP winner, Moses Malone. Malone, who was then a center on the NBA&#x27;s Houston Rockets, played games every off-season with several NBA players at the Fonde Recreation Center. Olajuwon joined the workouts and went head to head with Malone in several games throughout the summer. Olajuwon credited this experience with rapidly improving his game: &quot;The way Moses helped me is by being out there playing and allowing me to go against that level of competition. He was the best center in the NBA at the time, so I was trying to improve my game against the best.&quot;

Olajuwon returned from that summer a different player. He was nicknamed &quot;the Dream&quot; during his basketball career after he dunked so effortlessly that his college coach said it &quot;looked like a dream.&quot; He and his teammates (including Clyde Drexler) formed what was dubbed &quot;Phi Slama Jama&quot;, the first slam-dunking &quot;fraternity&quot;, so named because of its above-the-rim prowess. In his sophomore and junior years he helped the Cougars advance to consecutive NCAA championship games, where they lost to North Carolina State on a last-second tip-in in 1983 and a Patrick Ewing-led Georgetown team in 1984. He averaged 13.9 points, 11.4 rebounds, and 5.1 blocks in 1982–83 and 16.8 points, 13.5 rebounds, and 5.6 blocks in 1983–84. Olajuwon was voted the NCAA Tournament Most Outstanding Player in 1983, when he was also named the Helms Foundation Player of the Year.

After the 1983–84 season, when he was named a consensus first-team All-American, Olajuwon debated whether to stay in college or declare early for the NBA draft. At that time, before the NBA draft lottery was introduced in 1985, the first pick was awarded by coin flip. Olajuwon recalled: &quot;I really believed that Houston was going to win the coin flip and pick the first draft choice, and I really wanted to play in Houston so I had to make that decision (to leave early).&quot; His intuition proved correct, and the toss placed Houston ahead of the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon was selected first overall by the Rockets in the 1984 NBA draft.

In his autobiography &quot;Living the Dream&quot;, Olajuwon mentions an intriguing draft trade offered to the Rockets that would have sent Clyde Drexler and the number two pick in the 1984 NBA draft from Portland in exchange for Ralph Sampson. Had the Rockets made the deal, Olajuwon states the Rockets could have selected Jordan with the number two pick to play alongside Olajuwon and Drexler, who had established chemistry playing together during their Phi Slama Jama days in college. Sportswriter Sam Smith speculates that such a trade &quot;would have changed league history and maybe the entire Michael Jordan legend.&quot; From 1991 to 1998, every NBA championship team included either Jordan or Olajuwon; furthermore, at least one of Drexler, Jordan, and Olajuwon was involved in every NBA Finals from 1990 to 1998.

==Professional career==

=== Houston Rockets (1984–2001) ===

==== Early years (1984–1987) ====
The Rockets had immediate success during Olajuwon&#x27;s rookie season, as their win–loss record improved from a 29–53 record in 1983–84 to 48–34 in 1984–85. He teamed with the 1984 Rookie of the Year, 7 ft 4 in (2.24 m) Ralph Sampson to form the original NBA &quot;Twin Towers&quot; duo. Olajuwon averaged 20.6 points, 11.9 rebounds and 2.68 blocks in his rookie season. He finished as runner-up to Michael Jordan in the 1985 Rookie of the Year voting, and was the only other rookie to receive any votes.

Olajuwon averaged 23.5 points, 11.5 rebounds, and 3.4 blocks per game during his second pro season (1985–86). The Rockets finished 51–31, and advanced all the way to the Western Conference Finals where they faced the defending champion Los Angeles Lakers. The Rockets won the series fairly easily, four games to one, shocking the sports world and landing Olajuwon on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. Olajuwon scored 75 points in victories in games three and four, and after the series Lakers coach Pat Riley remarked &quot;We tried everything. We put four bodies on him. We helped from different angles. He&#x27;s just a great player.&quot; The Rockets advanced to the 1986 NBA Finals where they lost in six games to the Boston Celtics, whose 1986 team is often considered one of the best teams in NBA history.

==== Mid-career years (1987–1993) ====

During the 1987–88 season, Sampson (who was struggling with knee injuries that would eventually end his career prematurely) was traded to the Golden State Warriors. The 1988–89 season was Olajuwon&#x27;s first full season as the Rockets&#x27; undisputed leader. This change also coincided with the hiring of new coach Don Chaney. The Rockets ended the regular season with a record of 45–37, and Olajuwon finished the season as the league leader in rebounds (13.5 per game) by a full rebound per game over Charles Barkley. This performance was consistent with his averages of 24.8 points and 3.4 blocks. Olajuwon posted exceptional playoff numbers of 37.5 ppg and 16.8 rpg, plus a record for points in a four-game playoff series (150). Nevertheless, the Rockets were eliminated in the first round by the Seattle SuperSonics, 3 games to 1.

The 1989–90 season was a disappointment for the Rockets. They finished the season with a 41–41 record, and though they made the playoffs, were eliminated in four games by Los Angeles. Olajuwon put up one of the most productive defensive seasons by an interior player in the history of the NBA. He won the NBA rebounding crown (14.0 per game) again, this time by an even larger margin; a full two rebounds per game over David Robinson, and led the league in blocks by averaging 4.6 per game. He is the only player since the NBA started recording blocked shots in 1973–74 to average 14+ rebounds and 4.5+ blocked shots per game in the same season. In doing so he joined Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Bill Walton as the only players in NBA history (at that point) to lead the league in rebounding and shot-blocking in the same season. Olajuwon also recorded a quadruple-double during the season, becoming only the third player in NBA history to do so.

The Rockets finished the 1990–91 season with a record of 52–30 under NBA Coach of the Year Chaney. Olajuwon averaged 21.8 points per game in 1990–91, but due to an injury to his eyesocket caused by an elbow from Bill Cartwright, did not play in enough games (56) to qualify for the rebounding title. Otherwise, he would have won it for a third consecutive year, averaging 13.8 a game (league leader Robinson averaged 13.0 rpg). He also averaged a league-leading 3.95 blocks per game. However, the Rockets were swept in the playoffs by the LA Lakers.

The following season was a low point for the Rockets during Olajuwon&#x27;s tenure. They finished 42–40, and missed the playoffs for the first time in Olajuwon&#x27;s career. He missed two weeks early in the season due to an accelerated heartbeat. Despite his usual strong numbers, he could not lift his team out of mediocrity. Since making the Finals in 1986, the Rockets had made the playoffs five times, but their record in those playoff series was 1–5 and they were eliminated in the first round four times. Following the season, Olajuwon requested a trade in part because of his bad contract; his salary was considerably low for a top center, and his contract specifically forbade re-negotiation. He also expressed displeasure with the organization&#x27;s efforts to surround him with quality players. He felt the Rockets had cut corners at every turn, and were more concerned with the bottom line than winning. Management had also infuriated Olajuwon during the season when they accused him of faking a hamstring injury because of his unhappiness over his contract situation. His agent cited his differences with the organization as being &quot;irreconcilable&quot;, and Olajuwon publicly insulted owner Charlie Thomas and the team&#x27;s front office. With the 1992–93 season approaching, a reporter for the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that Olajuwon being dealt was &quot;as close to a sure thing as there is.&quot;

Nonetheless, he was not traded and the Rockets began the season with a new coach, Rudy Tomjanovich. Olajuwon improved his passing in 1992–93, setting a new career-high of 3.5 assists per game. This willingness to pass the ball increased his scoring, making it more difficult for opposing teams to double and triple-team him. Olajuwon set a new career-high with 26.1 points per game. The Rockets set a new franchise record with 55 wins, and advanced to the second round of the playoffs, pushing the Seattle SuperSonics to a seventh game before losing in overtime, 103–100. He finished second in the MVP race to Charles Barkley with 22 votes to Barkley&#x27;s 59. The team rewarded him with a four-year contract extension toward the end of the regular season.

====MVP and championship years (1993–1995) ====
Olajuwon gained a reputation as a clutch performer and as one of the top centers in history based on his performances in the 1993–94 and 1994–95 seasons. He outplayed centers such as Patrick Ewing, David Robinson, Shaquille O&#x27;Neal, and Dikembe Mutombo, and other defensive stalwarts such as Dennis Rodman and Karl Malone. Many of his battles were with his fellow Texas-based rival David Robinson of the San Antonio Spurs. In the 30 head–to–head match-ups during the seven seasons from the 1989 to 1996, when both Olajuwon and Robinson were in their prime, Olajuwon averaged 26.3 points per game, shooting 47.6% from the field, while Robinson averaged 22.1 and 46.8%.

Olajuwon led the Rockets to a championship in the 1994 NBA Finals in a seven-game series against the New York Knicks, the team of one of Olajuwon&#x27;s perennial rivals since his collegiate days, Patrick Ewing. After being down 2–1, the Knicks took a 3–2 lead into Game 6. The Rockets were defending an 86–84 lead when in the last second, Knicks guard John Starks (who had already scored 27 points) went up for what would have been a Finals-winning three. Olajuwon pulled off a clutch play by blocking the shot as time expired. In Game 7, Olajuwon posted a game–high 25 points and 10 rebounds, which helped defeat the Knicks, bringing the first professional sports championship to Houston since the Houston Oilers won the American Football League championship in 1961. Olajuwon dominated Ewing in their head–to–head match-up, outscoring him in every game of the series and averaging 26.9 points per game on 50% shooting, compared to Ewing&#x27;s 18.9 and 36.3%. For his efforts Olajuwon was named NBA Finals Most Valuable Player.

Olajuwon was at the pinnacle of his career. In 1994, he became the only player in NBA history to win the MVP, the Championship, the Finals MVP and Defensive Player of the Year awards in the same season. He was also the first foreign-born player to win the league&#x27;s MVP award.

On December 1, 1994, Olajuwon recorded a triple-double 37 points, 13 rebounds and 12 assists in a 113–109 win over the Golden State Warriors. But despite a slow start by the team, and Olajuwon missing eight games toward the end of the season with anemia, the Rockets repeated as champions in 1995. They were bolstered in part by the acquisition of Clyde Drexler, Olajuwon&#x27;s former University of Houston &quot;Phi Slama Jama&quot; teammate, in a mid-season trade from the Portland Trail Blazers. Olajuwon averaged 27.8 points, 10.8 rebounds, and 3.4 blocks per game during the regular season. Olajuwon displayed perhaps the most impressive moments of his career during the playoffs. San Antonio Spurs center David Robinson, recently crowned league MVP, was outplayed by Olajuwon in the Conference Finals: Olajuwon averaged 35.3 points on .560 shooting (Robinson&#x27;s numbers were 23.8 and .449) and outscored Robinson 81–41 in the final two games. In the series-clinching game, Olajuwon recorded 39 points, 17 rebounds and 5 blocks. When asked later what a team could do to &quot;solve&quot; Olajuwon, Robinson told &quot;LIFE&quot; magazine: &quot;Hakeem? You don&#x27;t solve Hakeem.&quot; The Rockets won every road game that series. In the NBA Finals, the Rockets swept the Orlando Magic, who were led by a young Shaquille O&#x27;Neal. Olajuwon outscored O&#x27;Neal in every game, scoring more than 30 points in each and raising his regular-season rate by five while O&#x27;Neal&#x27;s production dropped by one. Olajuwon was again named Finals MVP. He averaged 33.0 points on .531 shooting, 10.3 rebounds, and 2.81 blocks in the 1995 Playoffs. As in 1994, Olajuwon was the only Rockets All-Star.

==== Post-championship period (1995–2001) ====

The Rockets&#x27; two-year championship run ended when they were eliminated in the second round of the 1996 NBA Playoffs by the eventual Western Conference Champion Seattle SuperSonics. Michael Jordan had returned from an 18-month hiatus in March 1995, and his Chicago Bulls dominated the league for the next three years (1996–98). The Bulls and Rockets never met in the NBA Playoffs. The Rockets posted a 57–win season in 1996–97 season when they added Charles Barkley to their roster. They started the season 21–2, but lost the Western Conference Finals in six games to the Utah Jazz. After averaging 26.9 and 23.2 points in 1995–96 and 1996–97 respectively, Olajuwon&#x27;s point production dipped to 16.4 in 1997–98. After the Rockets lost in the first round in five games to the Jazz in 1998, Drexler retired. In 1998–99 the Rockets acquired veteran All-Star Scottie Pippen and finished 31–19 in the lockout-shortened regular season. Olajuwon&#x27;s scoring production rose to 18.9 points per game, and he made his twelfth and final All-NBA Team. However, they lost in the first round again, this time to the Lakers. After the season, Pippen was traded to the Portland Trail Blazers.

=== Toronto Raptors (2001–2002) ===
Houston began to rebuild, bringing in young guards Cuttino Mobley and 2000 NBA co-Rookie of the Year Steve Francis. On August 2, 2001, after refusing a $13 million deal with the Rockets, Olajuwon was traded to the Toronto Raptors for draft picks (the highest of which was used by Houston to draft Boštjan Nachbar at #15 in the 2002 NBA draft), with the player having a three-year contract that would give him $18 million. In his first game with the Raptors, he scored 11 points in just 22 minutes of playing time against the Magic. Olajuwon averaged career lows of 7.1 points and 6.0 rebounds per game in what would be his final season in the NBA, as he decided to retire in the fall of 2002, due to a back injury. Olajuwon retired as the all–time league leader in total blocked shots with 3,830, although shot-blocking did not become an official statistic until the 1973–74 NBA season.

Shortly after his retirement, his No. 34 jersey was retired by the Rockets. For his NBA career, Olajuwon averaged 21.8 points on 51% shooting, 11.1 rebounds, 2.5 assists, and 3.1 blocks in 1,238 career games.

==National team career==
In 1980, before arriving in the US, Olajuwon played for a Nigerian junior team in the All-Africa Games. This created some problems when he tried to play for the United States men&#x27;s national basketball team initially. FIBA rules prohibit players from representing more than one country in international competition, and players must go through a three-year waiting period for any nationality change. Olajuwon was ineligible for selection to the &quot;Dream Team&quot; as he hadn&#x27;t become a US citizen.

Olajuwon became a naturalized American citizen on April 2, 1993. For the 1996 Olympics, he received a FIBA exemption and was eligible to play for Dream Team III. The team went on to win the gold medal in Atlanta. During the tournament, he shared his minutes with Shaquille O&#x27;Neal and David Robinson. He played 7 out of the 8 games and started 2. He averaged 5 points and 3.1 rebounds and had 8 assists and 6 steals in seven games.

==Player profile==

Olajuwon was highly skilled as both an offensive and defensive player. On defense, his rare combination of quickness and strength allowed him to guard a wide range of players effectively. He was noted for both his outstanding shot-blocking ability and his unique talent (for a frontcourt player) for stealing the ball. Olajuwon is the only player in NBA history to record more than 200 blocks and 200 steals in the same season. He averaged 3.09 blocks and 1.75 steals per game for his career. He is the only center to rank among the top ten all-time in steals. Olajuwon was also an outstanding rebounder, with a career average of 11.1 rebounds per game. He led the NBA in rebounding twice, during the 1989 and 1990 seasons. He was twice named the NBA Defensive Player of the Year, and was a five-time NBA All-Defensive First Team selection. In 2022, the NBA renamed its Defensive Player of the Year award as The Hakeem Olajuwon Trophy.

On offense, Olajuwon was famous for his deft shooting touch around the basket and his nimble footwork in the low post. With the ball, Hakeem displayed a vast array of fakes and spin moves, highlighted in his signature &quot;Dream Shake&quot; (see below). He was a prolific scorer, averaging 21.8 points per game for his career, and an above-average offensive rebounder, averaging 3.3 offensive rebounds per game. Additionally, Olajuwon became a skilled dribbler with an ability to score in &quot;face-up&quot; situations like a perimeter player. He is one of only four players to have recorded a quadruple-double in the NBA, which have only been possible since the 1973–74 season, when blocked shots and steals were first kept as statistics in the NBA. In 2022, to commemorate the NBA&#x27;s 75th Anniversary &quot;The Athletic&quot; ranked their top 75 players of all time, and named Olajuwon as the 11th greatest player in NBA history.

===&quot;Dream Shake&quot;===
Olajuwon established himself as an unusually skilled offensive player for a big man, perfecting a set of fakes and spin moves that became known as his trademark &quot;Dream Shake&quot;. Executed with uncanny speed and power, they are still regarded as the pinnacle of &quot;big man&quot; footwork. Shaquille O&#x27;Neal stated: &quot;Hakeem has five moves, then four countermoves – that gives him 20 moves.&quot; Olajuwon himself traced the move back to the soccer-playing days of his youth. &quot;The Dream Shake was actually one of my soccer moves which I translated to basketball. It would accomplish one of three things: one, to misdirect the opponent and make him go the opposite way; two, to freeze the opponent and leave him devastated in his tracks; three, to shake off the opponent and giving him no chance to contest the shot.&quot; The Dream Shake was very difficult to defend, much like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar&#x27;s sky-hook.

One notable Dream Shake happened in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, drove to the basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, kept up with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.

Olajuwon has referred to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: &quot;When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the &#x27;touch landing.&#x27; The defender is waiting for me to come down because I jumped but I&#x27;m gone before I land. Defenders say &#x27;Wow, he&#x27;s quick,&#x27; but they don&#x27;t know that where I&#x27;m going is predetermined. He&#x27;s basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can&#x27;t react because he&#x27;s waiting for you to come down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All this is part of the Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don&#x27;t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don&#x27;t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he&#x27;s frozen, he doesn&#x27;t know which way I&#x27;m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn&#x27;t know where you&#x27;re gonna turn and when.&quot;

==Personal life==
Olajuwon married Dalia Asafi on August 8, 1996, in Houston.&lt;ref name=&quot;nba.com/rockets&quot;&gt;Hakeem Tribute , nba.com/rockets, accessed January 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple have four children together. Olajuwon also has an older daughter, Abisola from a previous relationship with Lita Spencer, whom he met in college. Abisola represented the West Girls in the McDonald&#x27;s All-American Game and played in the WNBA.

In addition to English, Olajuwon is fluent in French, Arabic, and Yoruba. He wrote his autobiography, &quot;Living the Dream&quot;, with co-author Peter Knobler in 1996. During his 18-year NBA career, Olajuwon earned more than $110 million in salary.

After Olajuwon&#x27;s rookie year he signed a 5-year agreement for $2.5 million, to endorse Etonic Shoes with a Signature line, the Dream Shoe. Later in his career, he signed a shoe endorsement deal with LA Gear, and became the face of Spalding&#x27;s athletic shoe line and endorsed a sneaker that retailed in various outlets (such as Payless ShoeSource) for $34.99. This made him one of the very few well-known players in any professional sport to endorse a sneaker not from Nike, Reebok, Adidas, or other high-visibility retail brands. As Olajuwon declared: &quot;How can a poor working mother with three boys buy Nikes or Reeboks that cost $120? ... She can&#x27;t. So kids steal these shoes from stores and from other kids. Sometimes they kill for them.&quot;

===Higher education===
Attending college was also an important priority for Olajuwon. At the University of Houston, Olajuwon was a physical education major.

===Muslim faith===
In Olajuwon&#x27;s college career and early years in the NBA, he was often undisciplined, talking back to officials, getting in minor fights with other players and amassing technical fouls. Later, Olajuwon took an active interest in spirituality, becoming a more devout Muslim. On March 9, 1991, he altered his name from Akeem to the more conventional spelling of Hakeem, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not changing the spelling of my name, I&#x27;m correcting it&quot;. He later recalled, &quot;I studied the Qur&#x27;an every day. At home, at the mosque ... I would read it in airplanes, before games and after them. I was soaking up the faith and learning new meanings each time I turned a page. I didn&#x27;t dabble in the faith, I gave myself over to it.&quot; &quot;His religion dominates his life&quot;, Drexler said in 1995. Olajuwon was recognized as one of the league&#x27;s elite centers even while observing Ramadan (i.e., abstaining from food and drink from dawn to sunset during the lunar month of Ramadan on the Islamic calendar), which occurred during the playing season throughout his career. Olajuwon was noted as sometimes playing better during the month of Ramadan, and in 1995 he was named NBA Player of the Month in February, even though Ramadan began on February 1 of that year.

==Post-NBA life==
Olajuwon played for 20 consecutive seasons in Houston, first collegiately for the University of Houston Cougars and then professionally with the Houston Rockets. He is considered a Houston icon and one of the city&#x27;s most beloved citizens. Olajuwon has had great success in the Houston real estate market, with his estimated profits exceeding $100 million. He buys in cash-only purchases, as it is against Islamic law to pay interest. Olajuwon splits his time between Jordan, where he moved with his family to pursue Islamic studies, and his ranch near Houston.

In the 2006 NBA offseason, Olajuwon opened his first Big Man Camp, where he teaches young frontcourt players the finer points of playing in the post. While Olajuwon never expressed an interest in coaching a team, he wishes to give back to the game by helping younger players. When asked whether the league was becoming more guard-oriented and big men were being de-emphasized, Olajuwon responded, &quot;For a big man who is just big, maybe. But not if you play with speed, with agility. It will always be a big man&#x27;s game if the big man plays the right way. On defense, the big man can rebound and block shots. On offense, he draws double-teams and creates opportunities. He can add so much, make it easier for the entire team.&quot; He runs the camp for free. Olajuwon has worked with several NBA players, including power forward Emeka Okafor, and center Yao Ming. In September 2009, he also worked with Kobe Bryant on the post moves and the Dream Shake. In 2010, Olajuwon worked with Dwight Howard, helping him diversify his post moves and encouraging more mental focus. In the 2011 offseason, LeBron James flew to Houston and spent time working with Olajuwon. Olajuwon has also worked with Ömer Aşık, Donatas Motiejūnas, Amar&#x27;e Stoudemire, Carmelo Anthony, JaVale McGee and Kenneth Faried. In an interview with the Sporting News in April 2016, Olajuwon said that Kobe Bryant was his best low-post student. He stated, &quot;I’ve worked with a lot of players, but the one who really capitalized on it the most is Kobe Bryant. When I watch him play, he’ll go down in the post comfortably, naturally, and he’ll execute it perfectly.&quot;

Olajuwon was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame as a member of the class of 2008. On April 10, 2008, the Rockets unveiled a sculpture in honor of him outside the Toyota Center.

Olajuwon attended the 2013 NBA draft to bid farewell to retiring commissioner David Stern as Stern made his announcement for the final pick of the first round. Olajuwon was the first pick announced by Stern back in 1984.

On August 1, 2015, Olajuwon made a special appearance for Team Africa at the 2015 NBA Africa exhibition game. He became a member of the FIBA Hall of Fame in 2016.

<text>Sandy Area Metro (called SAM) is a public transit system operated by the city government of Sandy, Oregon. SAM was created after the city successfully petitioned to be removed from the TriMet district in the late 1990s. The name was chosen in July 1999, and service began operating on January 4, 2000. The local transit provider gave its one-millionth ride on November 21, 2006 and began its twentieth year in January 2019. SAM maintains three routes, a dial-a-ride service called Sandy Transit Area Rides (STAR), and an Elderly and Disabled (ED) medical rides program. 

The SAM-Gresham route provides service seven days a week, to the Gresham Transit Center, where riders can use TriMet to travel to the Portland metropolitan area. SAM-Estacada, a Monday-Saturday service, runs four times a day to and from Estacada. These routes also connect to the Mount Hood Express bus service from Sandy to Government Camp and Timberline. The in-town Shopping Shuttle operates Monday-Friday circulating the business corridor enabling citizens greater access to goods and services. STAR operates Monday-Saturday and ED is available weekdays. To reduce congestion and increase access to city events special routes are occasionally added. All vehicles are ADA accessible with low floors, ramps and wheelchair lifts. 
All SAM service within the city limits is free and out of town rides are $1.00 each way. Rides on the STAR on-demand route are $1.00 each way. ED rides are $2.00 each way and one caregiver may ride free. 24-Trip passes may be purchased for $20.00 and monthly passes, providing unlimited rides, can be purchased for $30.00. SAM and Mt. Hood Express have a combination all day pass for $5.00. SAM bus services are funded by state and federal grants as well as a modest business tax. HB217 has provided an additional source of revenue that will allow for expansion of service. 

SAM has a Transit Advisory Board that meets quarterly and is open to the public. Residents of Sandy are encouraged to attend meetings as participate as members of the board. The board directs staff on the plans and goals to ensure accountability and transparency. Information on becoming a board member is available on the website along with historical minutes. As of September 2019 all meetings will be broadcast via YouTube.

<doc id="256384" wikidata="Q1141238" url="?curid=256384" title="The Guess Who">
<text>The Guess Who was a Canadian rock band formed in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1965. The band found their greatest success in the late 1960s and early 1970s, under the leadership of singer/keyboardist Burton Cummings and guitarist Randy Bachman, with hit songs including &quot;American Woman&quot;, &quot;These Eyes&quot;, and &quot;No Time&quot;.

During their most successful period, The Guess Who released eleven studio albums, all of which reached the charts in Canada and the United States. Their 1970 album &quot;American Woman&quot; reached no. 1 in Canada and no. 9 in the United States, while five other albums reached the top ten in Canada. The Guess Who charted fourteen Top 40 singles in the United States and more than thirty in Canada. The band was the first Canadian rock band to have widespread success in the United States and, unlike several other Canadian acts of the time, did not move to the US to achieve fame, become American citizens, or downplay their Canadian identity.

The Guess Who officially broke up in 1975, with a major reunion tour in the early 2000s. A separate band organized by former bassist Jim Kale also toured and recorded under The Guess Who name for several decades, often performing without any original band members on stage. After a long legal dispute, Bachman and Cummings regained control of the Guess Who name in a 2024 settlement.

==History==

===Predecessor groups (1958–1965)===
In 1958, Winnipeg singer/guitarist Chad Allan formed a local rock band called Al and the Silvertones. After several lineup changes, the band stabilized in 1962 under the name Chad Allan and the Reflections, which included Allan and keyboardist Bob Ashley, plus future Guess Who mainstays Randy Bachman on guitar, Jim Kale on bass, and Garry Peterson on drums.

Chad Allan and the Reflections released their first single, &quot;Tribute To Buddy Holly&quot;, on Canadian-American Records in 1962. They then signed with Quality Records and released several singles in 1963–64, which gained some regional notice around Winnipeg but made little impact in the rest of Canada. One single was credited, perhaps mistakenly, to Bob Ashley and the Reflections.

In 1965, the group changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions after an American group called The Reflections released the hit single &quot;(Just Like) Romeo and Juliet&quot;. Chad Allan and the Expressions released the garage rock album &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot; in January 1965. That album&#x27;s single, &quot;Shakin&#x27; All Over&quot;, earlier recorded by Johnny Kidd &amp; the Pirates, was the band&#x27;s first major hit, reaching no. 1 in Canada, no. 22 in the United States, and no. 27 in Australia. Their Canadian label, Quality Records, disguised the single by crediting it to Guess Who?, as a publicity stunt to generate speculation that it was by a more famous British Invasion band working incognito.

After Quality Records revealed the band to be Chad Allan and the Expressions, disc jockeys continued to announce the group as Guess Who?, effectively forcing the band to accept the new name. They released their second album, &quot;Hey Ho (What You Do to Me!)&quot; in late 1965; it was credited to Chad Allan and the Expressions with &quot;Guess Who?&quot; displayed prominently on the cover.

===Early years (1965–1968)===
Keyboardist Bob Ashley left the band in January 1966 because of the rigors of touring. He was replaced by 18-year-old Burton Cummings (formerly of Winnipeg group the Deverons) who also took on lead vocal duties in conjunction with Chad Allan on the band&#x27;s first album, released under the band name The Guess Who? (The question mark would be dropped later.) Just a few months later, Allan departed; he returned to college and then became a media personality with the CBC. This left Cummings as the sole lead singer. After Allan&#x27;s departure in 1966, guitarist Bruce Decker, a former bandmate of Cummings in the Deverons, joined for a few months.

The Guess Who released its first album, &quot;It&#x27;s Time&quot;, with Cummings on vocals and keyboards, Bachman on guitar, Kale on bass, and Peterson on drums, in the summer of 1966. Decker, despite being pictured on the cover of the album, did not participate in the recording. Conversely, some contributions by Allan (recorded before he left the group) can be heard on the album, though he is not credited or pictured on the album cover. Many of the songs were written by Randy Bachman.

The Guess Who continued to release singles that were moderately successful in Canada, and &quot;His Girl&quot; entered the UK charts in 1967. The band travelled to the United Kingdom to promote the single, but this was a financial mistake as the song quickly dropped off the charts. They were unable to book shows or obtain work visas while in the UK, and returned to Canada heavily in debt. Later in 1967, The Guess Who were hired as the house band for the CBC Radio show &quot;The Swingers,&quot; and as the house band for the CBC Television program &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, which was hosted by their former bandmate Chad Allan. They initially performed hit singles by other artists, but the CBC producers encouraged them to develop more of their own music as well. This gave The Guess Who greater exposure in Canada and financial stability for the next two years.

After seeing The Guess Who on &quot;Let&#x27;s Go&quot;, record producer/sales executive Jack Richardson contacted the band about participating in an advertising project for Coca-Cola. This project became a split album titled &quot;A Wild Pair&quot; with Ottawa band the Staccatos (themselves soon to renamed Five Man Electrical Band). The album could only be purchased by mail order from Coca-Cola. Richardson served as The Guess Who&#x27;s producer until the band&#x27;s breakup in 1975, and they were managed during that entire period by Don Hunter.

===&quot;American Woman&quot; era (1968–1970)===

Richardson signed the Guess Who to his Nimbus 9 label and production company, and personally financed the recording of a new album in late 1968. The band was also signed to RCA for distribution outside of Canada. The Guess Who transitioned to a more mature pop-rock sound with soul and jazz influences. Their second studio album, &quot;Wheatfield Soul&quot;, was released in early 1969 and achieved success in both Canada and the United States. The single &quot;These Eyes&quot; reached the top ten in the United States and became a gold record with sales of more than one million copies. The follow-up album &quot;Canned Wheat&quot; was released in September 1969, and featured the double-sided hit singles &quot;Laughing&quot; and &quot;Undun&quot;.

For their third studio album, the band adopted more hard rock influences. &quot;American Woman&quot; was released in January 1970 and became a Billboard Top 10 hit. It was their first album to top the Canadian albums chart, and their first to reach the top ten on the American Billboard album chart. The title track, written by Bachman and Cummings (though all four original members are credited), reached No. 1 in both countries and was also a substantial hit in the United Kingdom. This made The Guess Who the first Canadian band to achieve a chart-topping single in the United States during the &quot;Billboard Hot 100&quot; era. (Canadian doo-wop group The Crew Cuts had a number one single in 1954, before that chart was instituted.) &quot;No Time&quot; and &quot;No Sugar Tonight/New Mother Nature&quot; also reached high on the singles charts in both Canada and the United States.

===Continued success (1970–1974)===

While &quot;American Woman&quot; became a success in the early months of 1970, Bachman recorded an all-instrumental solo album titled &quot;Axe&quot; with Peterson on drums. The Guess Who began recording a follow-up to &quot;American Woman&quot;, completing seven tracks. (The tracks were withheld and not released until 1976 under the title &quot;The Way They Were&quot;.) Bachman then took a break from touring with The Guess Who due to illness, with American guitarist Bobby Sabellico filling in temporarily. Bachman played a final show with the band and then exited the band in May 1970; his relations with Cummings had deteriorated and his recent conversion to Mormonism caused dissatisfaction with the band&#x27;s rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll lifestyle. Bachman later formed the successful hard rock band Bachman-Turner Overdrive.
Indicating a move into more intricate arrangements and vocal harmonies, while shooting for album rock radio, the Guess Who replaced Bachman with two guitarists from the Winnipeg rock scene: Kurt Winter from the band Brother, and Greg Leskiw from the band Wild Rice. Winter brought some songs from his previous band and became one of the Guess Who&#x27;s primary songwriters. Leskiw occasionally contributed lead vocals. On July 17, 1970, the band was invited to perform at the White House for US President Richard Nixon&#x27;s family and guests, but they were asked not to play &quot;American Woman&quot; due to its apparent criticism of the United States. However, in 2020, songwriter Burton Cummings admitted the song isn&#x27;t a criticism of America. Additionally, he said the White House never asked them to drop the song. That whole urban legend was created by the group&#x27;s manager as a publicity stunt.

The expanded lineup quickly recorded the album &quot;Share the Land&quot;, which was released in late 1970 and became another substantial hit in both Canada and the United States. Songs from the albums &quot;Wheatfield Soul&quot; through &quot;Share the Land&quot; were compiled for the album &quot;The Best of The Guess Who&quot;, which became another successful release in both countries in 1971.

The band&#x27;s commercial fortunes and chart performance then declined in the United States, perhaps due to an inability to be taken seriously by the fans of album rock radio, though they remained very successful in their native Canada. They released the albums &quot;So Long, Bannatyne&quot; in mid-1971, and &quot;Rockin&#x27;&quot; in early 1972. Both albums displayed more progressive and experimental elements. Shortly after the release of &quot;Rockin&quot;&#x27;, Leskiw suddenly left the band in the middle of a US tour. Leskiw was replaced on short notice by guitarist/singer Donnie McDougall, a veteran of the Winnipeg rock scene who had most recently played with the Vancouver-based Mother Tucker&#x27;s Yellow Duck. With McDougall on board, the band recorded the album &quot;Live at the Paramount&quot; at the Paramount Theatre in Seattle in May 1972; it was released in August and included some songs that had not appeared on previous studio albums.

Just two months after McDougall joined The Guess Who in 1972, founding bassist Jim Kale was dismissed from the band; he then joined Vancouver band Scrubbaloe Caine who released one album and achieved some Canadian hit singles in the mid-1970s. 
Kale subsequently formed and played with the Jim Kale Band, followed by the Ripple Brothers, before falling on hard times later in the decade. The Guess Who replaced Kale with Bill Wallace, who had played with Kurt Winter in their early Winnipeg band Brother. This lineup released the albums &quot;Artificial Paradise&quot; in early 1973, &quot;#10&quot; in late 1973 (the title of which represented their number of original albums up to that point), and &quot;Road Food&quot; in early 1974. &quot;Road Food&quot; included the single &quot;Clap for the Wolfman&quot;, which was a hit in both Canada and the United States, and the band&#x27;s first top ten American single since 1970. The novelty song was a tribute to disc jockey Wolfman Jack, who lent his voice to the recording.

===Breakup of The Guess Who (1974–1975)===

For undisclosed reasons, guitarists Winter and McDougall were dismissed from the band in June 1974. They were replaced by a single guitarist, Domenic Troiano, who had founded the successful Canadian band Bush and had also served briefly with James Gang. Having grown up in Toronto, Troiano was the first member of The Guess Who not to hail from Winnipeg. He had also collaborated with an earlier version of The Guess Who on an aborted movie soundtrack in 1970 and had played on Bachman&#x27;s album &quot;Axe&quot; that year. The lineup of Cummings, Troiano, Wallace, and Peterson released the albums &quot;Flavours&quot; in late 1974 and &quot;Power in the Music&quot; in mid-1975. Due to Troiano&#x27;s songwriting influence, these albums moved toward Jazz Rock; Cummings was unhappy with the stylistic change and the group broke up and disbanded in October 1975.

===The Guess Who members after 1975 breakup===

Following his departure from The Guess Who in 1970, Bachman went on to form Bachman-Turner Overdrive, which has continued into the 2020s. Cummings embarked on a lengthy solo career. Meanwhile, other original members drifted into relative obscurity.

In 1976, Peterson linked up with Toronto singer and ex-Domenic Troiano associate Roy Kenner and American guitarist Bobby Sabellico in an R&amp;B band, Delphia, which went unsigned and left no recordings. Peterson then worked as a night clerk in his father-in-law&#x27;s hotel and an insurance salesman to make ends meet before eventually making his way back to music. He played drums in the backup band accompanying Cummings from 1979 through 1983, followed by Bachman&#x27;s reunited BTO from 1984 through 1986.

After being kicked out of The Guess Who in 1972, Kale joined Vancouver band Scrubbaloe Caine until 1974. He subsequently formed the Jim Kale Band followed by the Ripple Brothers.
Troiano resumed his solo career, releasing three more solo albums by 1979 before forming a band called Black Market. Bill Wallace joined several local musicians, including Greg Leskiw, to form Crowcuss. Kurt Winter eventually retired from the music industry and died in 1997 at age 51.

Bruce Decker died on 24 August 1986. Decker, who was born in Winnipeg on 25 August 1946, died in a vehicular accident one day short of his 40th birthday.

===Classic lineup reunions===
Members of the classic-era Guess Who reunited a number of times over the years, the first being when Cummings, Bachman, Peterson, and late-classic-era bassist Wallace reformed for a CBC television special in November 1979. This was followed by a short tour of notable Canadian cultural venues in 1983, resulting in the live album &quot;Together Again!&quot; (known as &quot;The Best of The Guess Who – Live!&quot; in the United States). In May 1997, with their hometown of Winnipeg facing severe floods, Cummings and Bachman reunited for a fundraiser for disaster relief, organized by Canadian actor Tom Jackson. At the request of the Premier of Manitoba, Cummings, Bachman, Kale, and Peterson appeared together at the closing ceremonies of the Pan American Games at Winnipeg Stadium on August 8, 1999. This inspired plans for a reunion tour, though Kale dropped out. Another lineup featuring classic-era members Cummings, Bachman, Peterson, McDougall, and Wallace engaged in a lengthy reunion tour from 2000 to 2003, including playing the halftime show at the 2000 Grey Cup. On July 30, 2003, this lineup performed before an estimated audience of 450,000 at the Molson Canadian Rocks for Toronto SARS benefit concert. The show was the largest outdoor ticketed event in Canadian history. Since 2003, Bachman and Cummings have collaborated occasionally under the name Bachman-Cummings.

===Dispute over &quot;The Guess Who&quot; name===

A separate band, also called The Guess Who, was formed by former bassist Jim Kale in 1978. Kale, who was fired from the band in 1972, asked Cummings for permission to use the Guess Who name for a single reunion concert, but Kale went beyond the scope of Cummings’ initial permission and hired other musicians to perform as the new The Guess Who. In 1987, Kale discovered that the name The Guess Who had never been trademarked, and filed registration applications with the United States trademark office for the band name The Guess Who, unbeknownst to the other original members. Kale used his newly registered mark to start a new band in the United States, hiring a variety of musicians whom he called &quot;The Guess Who.&quot; Kale temporarily retired on several occasions, leaving no original members in the band. From 2006 to 2024, the U.S. trademark for live performances using the name &quot;The Guess Who&quot; was owned by a partnership between Kale and drummer Garry Peterson. After his final retirement, Kale continued to hire musicians with no historic connection to the band, whom he allowed to use the name as a Guess Who nostalgia band. Albums from Kale&#x27;s version of The Guess Who were not released through a major label and did not chart. Drummer Garry Peterson sometimes appeared in Kale&#x27;s Guess Who lineup, though the band also performed as a cover band without any original members present.

Both Cummings and Bachman were highly critical of Kale/Peterson&#x27;s version of the Guess Who, calling it &quot;the fake Guess Who&quot;, or &quot;Kale&#x27;s Klones&quot; and calling the band&#x27;s concerts &quot;fake bullshit shows.&quot; Kale himself referred to his own potential iteration of the group as &quot;a band of trained monkeys.&quot; The dispute was compared to John Fogerty&#x27;s dispute with his former bandmates over the use of the name Creedence Clearwater Revisited. Bachman and Cummings have toured and recorded together under the name &quot;Bachman-Cummings&quot;.

Early in 2023, Bachman and Cummings sent multiple cease-and-desist letters to the Peterson-led nostalgia band, accusing them of misleading the public. In October 2023, after having received no response to the letters, Bachman and Cummings launched a &quot;false advertising&quot; lawsuit against Kale and Peterson, claiming that the band has used the Guess Who name, photos of Bachman and Cummings, and original recordings, &quot;to give the false impression that Plaintiffs are performing as part of the cover band.&quot; Bachman and Cummings sought $20 million in damages. A hearing pertaining to the lawsuit and Kale and Peterson&#x27;s counterclaims was scheduled for January 2024. In April 2024, a federal judge denied Kale and Peterson&#x27;s motion to dismiss the Bachman and Cummings suit.

In April 2024, Cummings arranged to have legal permission pulled for any public performance of any Guess Who material Cummings had written or co-written. This legal gambit left both the performer and the owner of the performance venue liable for damages if any Cummings-authored Guess Who songs were performed for an audience. Following this action, the cover band was unable to perform most of the group&#x27;s biggest hits, including &quot;These Eyes&quot;, &quot;American Woman&quot;, &quot;No Time&quot;, and &quot;Share The Land&quot;, and many others. The group&#x27;s concerts were immediately cancelled and the website for Peterson&#x27;s Guess Who band was shut down in July 2024.

In September 2024, Bachman and Cummings announced that they had gained control of the Guess Who name in an out-of-court settlement.

==Honours==
The Guess Who&#x27;s original members, Cummings, Bachman, Kale and Peterson, were inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 1987. In 2001, the original members of The Guess Who received honorary doctorates from Brandon University in Brandon, Manitoba. For Cummings, this was a special honour because he had not graduated from high school. That same year, the group was inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. The signatures of then-current band members Bachman, Cummings, McDougall, Peterson, and Wallace are engraved into the commemorative stone. In 2002, the then-current remaining performing original members, Bachman, Cummings, McDougall, Peterson, and Wallace received the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Award for Lifetime Artistic Achievement for their contributions to popular music in Canada. In 2018, a number of master tapes of the band&#x27;s recordings, possibly including unreleased material, were donated to the St. Vital Museum in Winnipeg.

<doc id="256387" wikidata="Q235030" url="?curid=256387" title="Principality of Antioch">
<text>The Principality of Antioch (; ) was one of the Crusader states created during the First Crusade which included parts of Anatolia (modern-day Turkey) and Syria. The principality was much smaller than the County of Edessa or the Kingdom of Jerusalem. It extended around the northeastern edge of the Mediterranean, bordering the County of Tripoli to the south, Edessa to the east, and the Byzantine Empire or the Kingdom of Armenia to the northwest, depending on the date.

It had roughly 20,000 inhabitants in the 12th century, most of whom were Armenians and Greek Orthodox Christians, with a few Muslims outside the Antioch city itself. Most of the crusaders who settled there were of Norman origin, notably from the Norman Kingdom of southern Italy, as were the first rulers of the principality, who surrounded themselves with loyal subjects. Few of the inhabitants apart from the crusaders were Roman Catholic even though the city was under the jurisdiction of the Latin Patriarchate of Antioch, established in 1100. This patriarchate would endure as a titular one after the Crusades, until it was dropped in 1964.

==History==
===Foundation===
The city of Antioch had been a major Byzantine stronghold in the area under the control of a dux before falling to the Seljuk Turks in 1084. Therefore, it was one of the cities the army of the First Crusade aimed to liberate on its way to Jerusalem. While Baldwin of Boulogne headed east from Asia Minor to set up the County of Edessa, the main army of the First Crusade continued south to besiege Antioch in late October 1097. The army consisted of various leaders who had sworn to return all territory that had belonged to the Byzantine Empire as well as a Byzantine contingent under the command of the general Tatikios. With over four hundred towers, the city&#x27;s defenses were formidable. The siege lasted throughout the winter, with much attrition among the Crusader force, who were often forced to eat their horses, or, as legend has it, the bodies of fellow Christians who had not survived. There were several attempts by neighbouring Turkish chiefs to relieve the town, but these were beaten back such as during the Battle of the Lake of Antioch under the military leadership of Bohemond of Taranto.
In May 1098 another relief force under Kerbogha, atabeg of Mosul, approached the city and thus it became important for the crusaders to act fast. Bohemond convinced a guard in one of the towers, an Armenian and former Christian named Firouz, to let the Crusaders enter the city on 2 June 1098. Only four days later, a Muslim army from Mosul, led by Kerbogha, arrived to besiege the Crusaders. Alexios I Komnenos, the Byzantine emperor, was on his way to assist the Crusaders, but upon hearing rumours that the city had fallen to the Muslims, Alexios turned back.

The Crusaders withstood the siege, with help from a mystic named Peter Bartholomew. Peter claimed he had been visited by Andrew the Apostle, who told him that the Holy Lance that pierced Christ&#x27;s side as he was on the cross was located in the city. Excavations took place in the Basilica of Saint Peter and the Lance was discovered by Peter himself. Although it is possible Peter planted it there himself (the papal legate Adhemar of Le Puy believed this to be the case), it raised the spirits of the Crusaders as well as of the local Armenians and Greeks. With the relic at the head of the army, Bohemond marched out to meet the besieging Muslim force, which was defeated in the battle of Antioch in 1098. According to the Crusaders, an army of saints appeared to help them on the battlefield.

After this victory a lengthy dispute over who should control the city followed. Bohemond stated that the oath sworn to Alexios was nullified by Alexios&#x27; failure to bring them aid. He was resisted by count Raymond of Toulouse, who maintained that the city should be returned to Alexios and who would later found the County of Tripoli. Bohemond and his Italian Norman followers eventually won, not least because of the death of Adhemar of Le Puy, who had been the spiritual leader of the crusade and had been determined to cooperate with the Byzantines. Bohemond was already Prince (allodial lord) of Taranto in Italy. He desired to continue such independence in his new lordship, so he did not attempt to receive the title of Duke from the Byzantine Emperor, nor any other title with deep feudal obligations.

===Early history===
Bohemond started immediately after the victory against Kherboga to secure and expand his principality. In August 1098 he crossed the Amanus Mountains to Cilicia to take control of the towns his nephew Tancred had captured in the previous summer. After the main crusade army left for Jerusalem in 1099, he took full control of Antioch as well as of the surrounding places such as Artah and the harbour of St. Symeon. Bohemond then attempted to take the harbour town of Latakia which was under Byzantine possession, but he had to leave after Raymond and the other crusading lords, who had in the meantime conquered Jerusalem, forced him to. In December 1099 Bohemond travelled to Jerusalem and had three priests consecrated as bishops for his principality.

Following Bohemond&#x27;s capture in battle with the Danishmends in 1100, his nephew Tancred became regent. Tancred expanded the borders of the Principality, seizing the cities of Tarsus and Latakia from the Byzantine Empire. However those newly captured cities along with other territory were lost after the Battle of Harran when Baldwin II of Edessa was captured. Bohemond was released in 1103 and went to Italy to raise more troops in 1104, during which time Tancred remained regent of Antioch. Bohemond used the troops he raised to attack the Byzantines in 1107. Bohemond was defeated at Dyrrhachium in 1108 and was forced by Alexius I to sign the Treaty of Devol, making Antioch a vassal state of the Byzantine Empire upon Bohemond&#x27;s death. Bohemond had promised to return any land that was seized from the Muslims when the Crusaders passed through Constantinople in 1097. Bohemond also fought at Aleppo with Baldwin and Joscelin of the County of Edessa; when Baldwin and Joscelin were captured, Tancred became regent in Edessa as well. Bohemond left Tancred as regent once more and returned to Italy, where he died in 1111.

Alexius wanted Tancred to return the Principality in its entirety to Byzantium, but Tancred was supported by the County of Tripoli and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Tancred, in fact, had been the only Crusade leader who did not swear to return conquered land to Alexius (though none of the other leaders, save for Raymond IV of Toulouse, kept their oaths anyway). Tancred died in 1112 and was succeeded by Bohemond II, under the regency of Tancred&#x27;s nephew Roger of Salerno, who defeated a Seljuk attack in 1113.

On June 27, 1119, Roger was killed at the &quot;Ager Sanguinis&quot; (the Field of Blood), and Antioch became a vassal state of Jerusalem with King Baldwin II as regent until 1126 (although Baldwin spent much of this time in captivity in Aleppo). Bohemond II, who married Baldwin&#x27;s daughter Alice, ruled for only four years, and the Principality was inherited by his young daughter Constance; Baldwin II acted as regent again until his death in 1131, when Fulk of Jerusalem took power. In 1136, Constance, still only 8 years old, married Raymond of Poitiers, who was 36.

Raymond, like his predecessors, attacked the Byzantine province of Cilicia. This time, however, Emperor John II Komnenos fought back. He arrived in Antioch in 1138 and forced Raymond to swear fealty to him. There then followed a joint campaign as John led the armies of Byzantium, Antioch and Edessa against Muslim Syria. Aleppo proved too strong to attack, but the fortresses of Balat, Biza&#x27;a, Athereb, Maarat al-Numan and Kafartab were taken by assault. Although John fought hard for the Christian cause in the campaign in Syria, his allies, Prince Raymond of Poitiers and Count Joscelin II of Edessa, sat around playing dice instead of helping John to press the Siege of Shaizar. The city was taken, but the citadel defied assault. The Emir of Shaizar offered to pay a large indemnity, become John&#x27;s vassal, and pay yearly tribute; the offer was reluctantly accepted by the emperor. On the return of the army to Antioch, a riot instigated by Joscelin II of Edessa forced the emperor to leave without the citadel being surrendered to him. John had plans to reconquer Antioch and become an effective overlord of the remaining Crusader states, but he died in 1143.

===Antioch and the Byzantine Empire===
After the fall of Edessa in 1144, Antioch was attacked by Nur ad-Din during the Second Crusade. Much of the eastern part of the Principality was lost, and Raymond was killed at the battle of Inab in 1149. Baldwin III of Jerusalem was technically regent for Raymond&#x27;s widow Constance until 1153 when she married Raynald of Châtillon. Raynald, too, immediately found himself in conflict with the Byzantines, this time in Cyprus; he made peace with Manuel I Comnenus in 1158, and the next year Manuel arrived to take personal control of the Principality. From thence the Principality of Antioch was to be a vassal of Byzantium until Manuel&#x27;s death in 1180. Although this arrangement meant that the Principality had to provide a contingent for the Byzantine Army (troops from Antioch participated in an attack on the Seljuk Turks in 1176), it also safeguarded the City against Nur ad-Din at a time when it was in serious danger of being overrun.

Raynald was taken prisoner by the Muslims in 1160, and the regency fell to the Patriarch of Antioch (Raynald was not released until 1176, and never returned to Antioch). Meanwhile, Manuel married Constance&#x27;s daughter Maria, but as Constance was only nominally in charge of Antioch, she was deposed in 1163 and replaced by her son Bohemond III. Bohemond was taken captive by Nur ad-Din the following year at the Battle of Harim, and the Orontes River became the permanent boundary between Antioch and Aleppo. Bohemond returned to Antioch in 1165, and married one of Manuel&#x27;s nieces; he was also convinced to install a Greek Orthodox patriarch in the city.

The Byzantine alliance came to an end with the death of the Emperor Manuel in 1180. Antioch was deprived of the Empire&#x27;s protection, which had been enough to frighten Nur ad-Din away from intervening in the area for the preceding twenty years. Nevertheless, with help from the fleets of the Italian city-states, Antioch survived Saladin&#x27;s assault on the Kingdom of Jerusalem in 1187. Neither Antioch nor Tripoli participated in the Third Crusade, although the remnants of Frederick Barbarossa&#x27;s army briefly stopped in Antioch in 1190 to bury their king. Bohemond III&#x27;s son, also named Bohemond, had become count of Tripoli after the Battle of Hattin, and Bohemond III&#x27;s eldest son Raymond married an Armenian princess in 1194. Bohemond III died in 1201.

Bohemond&#x27;s death resulted in a struggle for control between Antioch, represented by Bohemond of Tripoli, and Armenia, represented by Bohemond III&#x27;s grandson Raymond-Roupen. Bohemond of Tripoli, as Bohemond IV, took control by 1207, but Raymond briefly ruled as a rival from 1216 to 1219. Bohemond died in 1233, and Antioch, ruled by his son Bohemond V, played no important role in the Fifth Crusade, Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II&#x27;s struggles to take back Jerusalem in the Sixth Crusade, or Louis IX of France&#x27;s Seventh Crusade.

=== Relations with other Latin settlements in the East ===
The Principality&#x27;s relationship with other Latin settlements were based on two factors. The first factor was that the Princes of Antioch wanted to extend their power throughout the Latin east which led to conflict between the County of Edessa and the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Secondly, an alliance between the Latin rulers was secured through their shared situation in the East. This alliance was strengthened by feudal ties and marriage alliances among the eastern Latin rulers.

Baldwin of Boulogne, Count of Edessa, and Bohemond I were said to have had a relationship based on equality and brotherhood. For example, they travelled to Jerusalem in 1099 to consolidate their pilgrimage vows together. They also consecrated the Latin clerics as bishops in Antioch, including the County of Edessa. Bohemon I and Baldwin of Le Bourcq also had a close relationship – Baldwin was made commander of Antioch&#x27;s militia by Bohemond in 1100.

A whole network of confraternities existed at this time. However, there were uneasy relations between the Principality and the region of Tripoli under Raymond, Count of Toulouse. Raymond allied with Emperor Alexius I Commnenus instead of Bohemond. In 1105, Bohemond left the east and he placed his nephew, Tancred, in charge of Antioch. In 1108, Bohemond also put Richard of Salerno in charge of Edessa, but Tancred was reluctant to hand it over because Tancred and Baldwin were fighting each other for possession of Edessa at the time. Tancred&#x27;s resistance continued into 1109. At the same time, a conflict between Antioch and the Count of Tripoli, William-Jordan, was settled when the latter agreed to surrender Tripoli in exchange for confirmation of his possession of Toulouse. Bertrand of Toulouse then entered an alliance with Baldwin I of Jerusalem. In 1110, a council convened after William-Jordan was killed. After this, Antioch and Edessa appear to have reconciled.

In 1111 when the Muslim army of Maudud of Mosul threatened the Principality, its Latin allies responded by bringing military aid. In 1112, Bertrand of Toulouse died and Roger Salerno took over Edessa. During this period, there was a better relationship between Antioch and Edessa as well as with the Kingdom of Jerusalem. For example, in 1115 in the lead-up to the battle of Tell Danith, the Edessene faction of the army was integral to Antioch&#x27;s overall army. In 1118 the forces of Jerusalem, Antioch and Tripoli combined to meet an army from Egypt and Damascus that was threatening the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

But in 1119 Roger of Salerno was killed, leaving no adult heir. This shifted the balance of power in northern Syria, as Baldwin II, King of Jerusalem, was appointed Regent. At this time, Joscelin of Courtenay enjoyed a stable rule in Edessa, further weakening Antioch&#x27;s dominance in Northern Syria. In 1126, Bohemond II arrived in the east and because Baldwin wanted Antioch and Jerusalem to maintain a close relationship, he arranged a marriage between the Prince of Antioch and his daughter, Alice. In 1127, a dispute between Bohemond and Joscelin of Courtenay led to Joscelin conducting raids in the Principality. In 1130, a succession crisis followed Bohemond II&#x27;s death, signifying the end of Antioch&#x27;s dominance of northern Syria.

===Fall of the Principality===

In 1254 Bohemond VI married Sibylla of Armenia, ending the power struggle between the two states, although by this point Armenia was the more powerful of the two and Antioch was essentially a vassal state. Both were swept up by the conflict between the Mameluks and the Mongols. In 1260, under the influence of his father-in-law, the Armenian king Hetoum I, Bohemond VI submitted to the Mongols under Hulagu, making Antioch a tributary state of the Mongol Empire. Bohemond and Hetoum fought on the side of the Mongols during the conquests of Muslim Syria, taking together the city of Aleppo, and later Damascus.

When the Mongols were defeated at the Battle of Ain Jalut in 1260, Baibars, the Mamluk sultan of Egypt, began to threaten Antioch, which (as a vassal of the Armenians) had supported the Mongols. Baibars finally took the city in 1268, and all of northern Syria was quickly lost; twenty-three years later, Acre was taken, and the Crusader states ceased to exist.

In the colophons of the Malatia Gospel of 1268 (MS No. 10675), Armenian manuscript illuminator Toros Roslin described the brutal sacking of Antioch by Baibars: &quot;...at this time great Antioch was captured by the wicked king of Egypt, and many were killed and became his prisoners, and a cause of anguish to the holy and famous temples, houses of God, which are in it; the wonderful elegance of the beauty of those that were destroyed by fire is beyond the power of words.&quot; The empty title of &quot;Prince of Antioch&quot; passed, with the extinction of the counts of Tripoli, to the kings of Cyprus, and was sometimes granted as a dignity to junior members of the royal house.

==Non-Latin population==
The native population of the principality was rather diverse. A significant proportion were Miaphysite Armenians, who could be found in Antioch and other urban and rural areas. Based on the rich evidence available, it has even been proposed that they were the most numerous ethnic group. Also important were the so-called &quot;suriani&quot;, who actually comprised two Christian peoples: the Aramaic-speaking Syriacs (also called &quot;Jacobites&quot;) and the Arabic-speaking Melkites. When the county of Edessa fell in 1144 and the region around Melitene became increasingly unsafe, many Jacobites sought refuge in the cities and town of the principality. This led among other things to the spread of the veneration of Mor Barsauma to whom a church was erected in 1156 by a couple of Frankish donors. The first prior was a monk of the Mor Bar Sauma Monastery with which the church maintained close ties.

Furthermore, there were also Muslims in the capital, in the south, and probably also the east of the principality. They appear only rarely in Antiochene charters, making an estimation of their numbers difficult. Other minorities were the Greeks (&quot;graeci&quot;) and Jews.

==Vassals of Antioch==

===Lords of Saône===
The Lordship of Saône was centered on the castle of Saône, but included the towns of Sarmada (lost in 1134) and Balatanos. Saône was captured by Saladin from the last lord, Matthew, in 1188.

* Robert the Leper (d. 1119)
* William of Zardana (1119–1132)

==Great officers of Antioch==
Like Jerusalem, Antioch had its share of great offices, including constable, marshal, seneschal, duke, viscount, butler, chamberlain, and chancellor.

<doc id="256388" wikidata="Q5311852" url="?curid=256388" title="Dudley Do-Right">
<text>Dudley Do-Right is a fictional character created by Alex Anderson, Chris Hayward, Allan Burns, Jay Ward, and Bill Scott, who appears as the main protagonist of &quot;Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties&quot;, a segment on &quot;The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show.&quot;

The segment parodies early 20th-century melodrama and silent film (the &quot;Northern&quot;), using only a piano as a musical background.

Dudley Do-Right&#x27;s first appearance specifically incorporates silent film tropes such as intertitles and iris shots, as well as incorporating a similar plot to 1921 silent film &quot;O&#x27;Malley of the Mounted&quot;, starring William S. Hart.

==Overview==

Dudley Do-Right is a dim-witted, but conscientious and cheerful Canadian Mountie who works for Inspector Fenwick. Do-Right is always trying to catch his nemesis, Snidely Whiplash, and rescue Inspector Fenwick&#x27;s daughter, damsel-in-distress Nell Fenwick, with whom Do-Right is deeply infatuated. He usually succeeds only by pure luck or through the actions of his horse, named &quot;Horse&quot;.

A running gag throughout the series is Nell Fenwick&#x27;s disinterest in Do-Right; instead, she appears to be infatuated with his horse. She is shown to kiss the horse rather than Do-Right, and when Do-Right leaves the Mounties, she is only upset about the horse leaving. In Do-Right&#x27;s first appearance, the narrator states,Dudley loved Nell. Unfortunately, she loved his horse.In the standard intro, Do-Right jumps on Horse and furiously rides him backwards as titles appear. Musical accompaniment is a c. 1900 style virtuoso trumpet fanfare, played by Uan Rasey. While riding, he comes across Whiplash tying Nell Fenwick to a railroad track, accompanied by musical bridge by low trombones. The trumpet fanfare returns as Do-Right reappears; he tips his hat to the two, before realizing what is going on and righting himself in time to save the day.

Dudley Do-Right made a cameo in a &quot;Rocky and Bullwinkle Fan Club&quot; segment as the hero in &quot;She Can&#x27;t Pay the Rent&quot;, a play staged by Boris Badenov. Rocky and Bullwinkle also appeared as cameos in &quot;Mountie Bear&quot;.

==&quot;The Dudley Do-Right Show&quot;==
&quot;The Dudley Do-Right Show&quot; is an animated television series assembled by P.A.T. Film Services, consisting of cartoons produced by Jay Ward Productions and Total Television that aired Sunday mornings on American Broadcasting Company (ABC) from April 27, 1969, to September 6, 1970. Each half-hour show included two segments each of &quot;Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties&quot; and &quot;The World of Commander McBragg&quot;, along with one segment each of &quot;Tooter Turtle&quot; and &quot;The Hunter&quot;. &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot; was a Jay Ward production, while the other segments were products of Total Television. Both companies used Gamma Productions, a Mexico-based animation studio.

The U.S. syndicated version of &quot;The Dudley Do-Right Show&quot;, called &quot;Dudley Do Right and Friends&quot;, follows the same format but features different episodes. The syndicated package features &quot;Dudley Do-Right of the Mounties&quot;, &quot;The World of Commander McBragg&quot;, &quot;The King and Odie&quot;, and &quot;The Hunter&quot;. The latter two originally appeared as part of &quot;King Leonardo and His Short Subjects&quot;, a series that aired between October 15, 1960, and September 28, 1963, on NBC-TV. Twenty-six new segments of both series were produced for CBS-TV&#x27;s &quot;Tennessee Tuxedo and His Tales&quot; in 1963, and these later segments are included in the syndicated &quot;Dudley Do Right and Friends&quot;.

Actors (voice overs) included:
*Bill Scott — Dudley Do-Right
*June Foray — Nell Fenwick
*Hans Conried — Snidely Whiplash
*Paul Frees — Inspector Fenwick/Narrator
*William Conrad did several (but not all) of the narrations.
*Evan Cox - cameo in &quot;The Actors Challenge&quot;

One segment originally seen on &quot;The Bullwinkle Show&quot;, &quot;Stokey the Bear&quot;, was withheld from all reissues of the series for several decades because the U.S. Forest Service objected to the image of a bear that &quot;started&quot; forest fires, even though he had been hypnotized by Snidely to do so. The segment was released on home video by Sony Wonder and Classic Media in 2005.

==Legacy==

On May 28, 1999, Universal Islands of Adventure opened Dudley Do-Right&#x27;s Ripsaw Falls, a log flume ride based on the cartoon segments. Guests enter a queue themed to resemble a theater, with Dudley, Nell, Snidely, and Horse presented as actors. Riders board cartoon logs and journey &quot;into&quot; the story, where Snidely has cruelly captured Nell Fenwick. Horse and Dudley make their first appearance in front of a cyclorama backdrop, theatrically &quot;charging&quot; to the rescue. The ride system contains three drops, the last and steepest of which is seventy-five feet. It is a hybrid flume/coaster that utilizes steel track to not only shoot guest-filled logs down the final drop, but under the water&#x27;s surface and over a bunny hill. The ride system was designed and built by Mack GmbH.

On August 27, 1999, Universal Studios released a comedy live-action film based on the character, titled &quot;Dudley Do-Right&quot;. It starred Brendan Fraser, Sarah Jessica Parker, and Alfred Molina. It received negative reviews and was a box-office failure, grossing less than $10 million domestically against a $22 million budget.

In 2000, music historian Irwin Chusid claimed that scat singer Shooby Taylor&#x27;s voice reminded him of Dudley Do-Right&#x27;s &quot;virile baritone.&quot;

Premiering in 2013, the Canadian adult animated series &quot;Fugget About It&quot; features a dimwitted yet well-meaning Mountie character, Strait McCool. McCool exhibits similar appearance, voice acting, behavior, and personality to Do-Right (except for the addition of sexual and drug references). It may be inferred that the character of McCool is a parody of Do-Right.

<doc id="256389" wikidata="Q2823374" url="?curid=256389" title="Acme Novelty Library">
<text>Acme Novelty Library is a comic book series created by Chicago cartoonist Chris Ware. Its first issue appeared in 1993. Published from 1994 by Fantagraphics Books and later self-published, it is considered a significant work in alternative comics, selling over 20,000 copies per issue.

==Format, style and content==
&quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot; has adopted numerous formats in the course of the series and, similarly, doesn&#x27;t feature a continuous cast of characters. It has showcased early Ware comics, such as &quot;Quimby the Mouse&quot; from &quot;The Daily Texan&quot;, and more recent strips from &quot;NewCity&quot;, a Chicago weekly paper.

Ware&#x27;s first major graphic novel, &quot;Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth&quot;, was originally serialized in &quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot; between 1995 and 2000. &quot;Jimmy Corrigan&quot; is the saga of a lonely childlike man and his alienated ancestors, partly inspired by Ware&#x27;s hopeful but unhappy reunion with his absentee father. The collected edition was released to much acclaim, winning the Guardian First Book Award, amongst others.

&quot;Rusty Brown&quot; and &quot;Building Stories&quot; began serialization in issue 16. With this issue, Ware also began to self-publish the title, with Fantagraphics and later Drawn &amp; Quarterly acting as distributor. When asked why he chose to self-publish Ware stated:
Well, it&#x27;s for a complicated variety of reasons, but mostly it was because I realized a year or two ago that I simply wasn’t really inspired to do it any more, and when I imagined taking over every aspect of it myself, I was suddenly inspired, almost anxious, to work on it again. In short, it just feels a little more like &quot;art&quot; to me now, since I’m responsible for everything that goes into it, and there’s no one to blame but myself if it&#x27;s awful...
Issues are imbued with the defining characteristics of Ware&#x27;s work; a pervasive sadness and nihilism permeate tales of disappointment, thwarted affection, and the dehumanization of the individual in a modern and mechanized world. Through the use of apparently extraneous novelties, such as cut-outs and flip-books, and prose parodies set in tiny fonts, Ware blurs the boundaries between author/reader/character. These interventions offer complex and simultaneous multilinear readings of the page that serve to thematise Ware&#x27;s engagement with issues of narrative and continuity.

==&quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot; series==
Issues 1–15 were published by Fantagraphics Books. Ware started self-publishing the series starting with #16, which was distributed by Fantagraphics, with subsequent issues distributed by Drawn &amp; Quarterly.

Issue 18 was published in 2007 containing Ware&#x27;s &quot;Thanksgiving&quot; covers for the November 26, 2006, issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, plus supplementary material, in portfolio format.

The title has been collected into volumes published by Pantheon Books (US), Fantagraphics Books (US) and Jonathan Cape (UK):
* &quot;Jimmy Corrigan, the Smartest Kid on Earth&quot; (2000), Pantheon / Cape (collects issue 5, 6, 8, 9 and 11–14).
* &quot;Quimby the Mouse&quot; (2003), Fantagraphics / Cape (collects issues 2 and 4 with additional material).
* &quot;The Acme Novelty Library Final Report to Shareholders and Rainy Day Saturday Afternoon Fun Book&quot; (2005), Pantheon / Cape (collects issues 7 and 15 with additional material, including parody ads and the ACME company &quot;tour&quot;).
* &quot;Building Stories&quot; (2012), Pantheon Books Pantheon / Cape (collects issue 18 with material from issue 16, other periodicals, and new material).
* &quot;Rusty Brown&quot; (2019), Pantheon Books (collects material from issues 16, 17, 19, 20, as well as new material).

Numbers 1, 3, and 10 are the only issues to remain uncollected at this time.

==Awards==
The series has been widely recognized in the industry.

The series won the Eisner Award for Best Continuing Series of 1996 and 2000; Best New Graphic Album of 2000; and Best Publication Design of 1995, 1996, 1997, and 2002. Furthermore, an &quot;Acme Novelty Library&quot; display stand won the Eisner Award for Best Comics-Related Product of 1998.

<doc id="256390" wikidata="Q583069" url="?curid=256390" title="Crafoord Prize">
<text>The Crafoord Prize () is an annual science prize established in 1980 by Holger Crafoord, a Swedish industrialist, and his wife Anna-Greta Crafoord following a donation to the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. It is awarded jointly by the Academy and the Crafoord Foundation in Lund, with the former selecting the laureates. The Prize is awarded in four categories: mathematics and astronomy, geosciences, biosciences (with an emphasis on ecology) and polyarthritis, the final one because Holger suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis in his later years. 

The disciplines for which the Crafoord Prize is awarded are chosen so as to complement the Nobel Prizes. Only one award is given each year, according to a rotating scheme – astronomy and mathematics, then geosciences, then biosciences. Since 2012, the prizes in astronomy and mathematics are separate and awarded at the same time; prior to this, the disciplines alternated every cycle. A Crafoord Prize in polyarthritis is only awarded when a special committee decides that substantial progress in the field has been made. The recipient of the Crafoord Prize is announced every year in mid-January and the prize is presented in April or May on &quot;Crafoord Days&quot;, by a member of the Monarchy of Sweden. , the prize money is 6,000,000 Swedish kronor (US$560,000), roughly half that of the Nobel Prizes.

The Prize is usually awarded to one recipient, but there can be as many as three. The inaugural laureates, Vladimir Arnold and Louis Nirenberg, were awarded the prize in 1982 for their work in the field of non-linear differential equations. Since then, the winners of the Prize have predominantly been men. The first woman to be awarded the Prize was astronomer Andrea Ghez in 2012.

<doc id="256394" wikidata="Q604913" url="?curid=256394" title="Power kite">
<text>A power kite or traction kite is a large kite designed to provide significant pull to the user.

== Types ==
The two most common forms are the foil, and the leading edge inflatable. There are also other less common types of power kite including rigid-framed kites and soft single skin kites. There are several different control systems used with these kites which have two to five lines and a bar or handles.

Foil kites consist of a number of cells with cloth ribs in each cell. It is the profile of these ribs that gives the kite its aerofoil shape and enable it to generate lift. The most common type is the ram-air foil, where each cell has a gauze-covered opening at the front, meaning air is forced in during flight, giving the kite its stiffness and enabling it to hold its profile. Some ram-air foils are closed-cell, where a one-way valve locks the air inside the cells, giving some increased water relaunch capability.

Leading edge inflatable kites (LEIs) are made of a single skin of fabric with, as the name suggests, an inflated tubular leading edge and inflated ribs. The leading edge and ribs are inflated by the user with a pump prior to launching the kite. The profile of an LEI type kite comes from the inflatable edge and ribs. LEI kites are primarily used for kitesurfing, as they retain their structure when wet and can be easily relaunched from the water after sitting on the surface for an extended period. Conversely, an open-celled foil kite crashed into the sea immediately becomes saturated with water and unflyable.

== Uses ==
Power kites are generally used in conjunction with a vehicle or board, such as in:
* kitesurfing on a kiteboard
* kite buggying on a purpose-built 3-wheeled cart
* kite landboarding on an all-terrain/mountain/land board
* kite skating on all-terrain roller skates
* kiteboating, on a boat
* snowkiting on skis or snowboards

Power kites can also be used recreationally without a vehicle or board, as in kite jumping or kite man lifting, where a harnessed kite flier is moored to the ground or one or more people to provide tension and lift

Research is also under way in the use of kites to generate electric power to be fed into a power grid. Laddermills are a type of airborne wind turbine. As an alternative to fuel-powered generators, shipping container sized generators can provide electricity to remote locations using large computer-controlled foil kites and battery reserves. Kites are used to reach high altitude winds such as a jet stream, which are always present, even if ground level winds available to wind turbines are absent.

Kites of related design are used for sailing, including speed sailing. &quot;Jacob&#x27;s Ladder&quot;, a kite-powered boat, set the C-Class world sailing speed record with a speed of in 1982, a record that stood for six years. A kiteboard was the first sailing craft to exceed a speed of in October 2008.

Power kites range in size from . All kites are made for specific purposes: some for water, land, power or maneuverability.

== Bridle configuration ==
The lift generated by the kite and other flying characteristics are affected by the kite&#x27;s angle of attack, which is set by the bridle; the arrangement of lines which terminate the main kite lines and attach to a number of points across the kite&#x27;s surface. Power kites having 4 or 5 lines come in two variants, fixed bridle and depowerable.

=== Fixed bridle ===

Fixed bridle kites have a fixed angle of attack which is set by the bridle. Small adjustments may be possible by adjusting the bridle with the kite on the ground, however the angle of attack is not adjustable whilst the kite is airborne. A high angle of attack setting results in more power from the kite, but at the expense of speed and ability to fly close to the wind. A low angle of attack results in less power, but speed is increased and the kite can fly a lot closer to the edge of the wind window. Fixed bridle kites may be used with handles or a bar, with handles typically being preferable for activities such as kite jumping and kite buggying, and a bar being preferable for kite landboarding.

=== Depowerable ===

Depowerable kites are used with a control bar and harness system, with the kite&#x27;s primary power lines attached to the user&#x27;s harness through a hole in the centre of the bar. The bar has a few inches of travel along the lines, and the lines are configured such that the user may pull the bar towards themselves to increase the kite&#x27;s angle of attack, increasing the lift and thus the power delivered through the harness whilst the kite is in flight. Kites used for kitesurfing are almost invariably depowerable, and some modern kites such as bow kites allow power to be reduced by almost 100% for increased safety and versatility.

Kite safety systems have become more prevalent in recent years, and today almost all 4 and 5 line kites are used with a safety system designed to remove power from the kite in the event that the user becomes overpowered or loses control of the kite. When flying a fixed bridle kite, one or more straps known as &#x27;kite killers&#x27; are attached to the user&#x27;s wrist(s) by bungee cords. When the handles or bar are released, these straps pull on the kite&#x27;s brake lines at the trailing edge of the kite, allowing the kite to flap in the wind with no structure.

Depowerable kites have safety systems that work in a similar way, but since the kite is semi-permanently attached to the user&#x27;s harness, a toggle or handle is used to activate the safety system which releases the bar and power lines from the harness.

Some depowerable kites have a 5th line safety system, the 5th line being redundant during normal use until the safety mechanism is activated. Here, all of the usual four lines are slackened, causing the kite to either fold or roll backwards, and lose its profile to the wind and therefore its power. The kite is left attached to the user by the 5th line to allow retrieval.

==History==
===19th century===
In the 1820s, George Pocock used kites of increased size to propel carts on land and ships on the water, using a four-line control system—the same system in common use today. Both carts and boats were able to turn and sail upwind. The kites could be flown for sustained periods. The intention was to establish kitepower as an alternative to horsepower, partly to avoid the hated &quot;horse tax&quot; that was levied at that time. Aviation pioneer Samuel Cody developed several &quot;man-lifting kites&quot; and in 1903 succeeded in crossing the English Channel in a small collapsible canvas boat powered by a kite.

===20th century===


In the late 1970s, the development of Kevlar then Spectra flying lines and more controllable kites with improved efficiency contributed to practical kite traction. In 1978, Ian Day&#x27;s &quot;FlexiFoil&quot; kite-powered Tornado catamaran exceeded 40 km/h.

In October 1977 Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise (Netherlands) received the first patent for KiteSurfing. The patent covers, specifically, a water sport using a floating board of a surf board type where a pilot standing up on it is pulled by a wind catching device of a parachute type tied to his harness on a trapeze type belt. Although this patent did not result in any commercial interest, Gijsbertus Adrianus Panhuise could be considered as the originator of KiteSurfing.

On 28 August 1982 Greg Locke and Simon Carter, from Brighton UK, set the world record for kite traction at sea, travelling nearly 26 miles under wind power alone along the English channel. This followed a successful crossing of the English Channel from Sussex to France by Locke &amp; Carter the previous year.

Through the 1980s, there were occasionally successful attempts to combine kites with canoes, ice skates, snow skis, water skis and roller skates.

Throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, Dieter Strasilla from Germany developed parachute-skiing and later perfected a kite-skiing system using self-made paragliders and a ball-socket swivel allowing the pilot to sail upwind and uphill but also to take off into the air at will. Strasilla and his Swiss friend Andrea Kuhn used this invention also in combination with surfboards and snowboards, grasskies and self-made buggies. One of his patents describes in 1979 the first use of an inflatable kite design for kitesurfing.

Two brothers, Bruno Legaignoux and Dominique Legaignoux, from the Atlantic coast of France, developed kites for kitesurfing in the late 1970s and early 1980s and patented an inflatable kite design in November 1984, a design that has been used by companies to develop their own products.

In 1990, practical kite buggying was pioneered by Peter Lynn at Argyle Park in Ashburton, New Zealand. Lynn coupled a three-wheeled buggy with a forerunner of the modern parafoil kite. Kite buggying proved to be popular worldwide, with over 14,000 buggies sold up to 1999.

<doc id="256406" wikidata="Q109324" url="?curid=256406" title="Christopher Lloyd">
<text>Christopher Allen Lloyd (born October 22, 1938) is an American actor. He has appeared in many theater productions, films, and television shows since the 1960s. He is known for portraying Emmett Brown in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy (1985–1990) and Jim Ignatowski in the comedy series &quot;Taxi&quot; (1978–1983), for which he won two Emmy Awards.

Lloyd came to public attention in Northeastern theater productions during the 1960s and early 1970s, earning Drama Desk and Obie awards for his work. He made his cinematic debut in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975) and went on to star as Commander Kruge in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984), Professor Plum in &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), Judge Doom in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), Uncle Fester in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991) and its sequel &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993), Switchblade Sam in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993), Mr. Goodman in &quot;Piranha 3D&quot; (2010), Bill Crowley in &quot;I Am Not a Serial Killer&quot; (2016) and David Mansell in &quot;Nobody&quot; (2021).

Lloyd earned a third Emmy for his 1992 guest appearance as Alistair Dimple in &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot;, and won an Independent Spirit Award for his performance in &quot;Twenty Bucks&quot;. He has done extensive voice work, including Merlock in &quot;DuckTales the Movie: Treasure of the Lost Lamp&quot;, Grigori Rasputin in &quot;Anastasia&quot;, the Hacker in the PBS Kids&#x27; &quot;Cyberchase&quot;, which earned him Daytime Emmy nominations, and the Woodsman in Cartoon Network&#x27;s &quot;Over the Garden Wall&quot;.

== Early life ==
Lloyd was born on October 22, 1938, in Stamford, Connecticut, the son of Ruth Lloyd (née Lapham; 1896–1984), a singer and sister of San Francisco mayor Roger Lapham, and her lawyer husband Samuel R. Lloyd Jr. (1897–1959). He is the youngest of three boys and four girls, one of whom, Samuel Lloyd, was an actor in the 1950s and 1960s. Lloyd&#x27;s maternal grandfather, Lewis Henry Lapham, was one of the founders of the Texaco oil company and Lloyd is also a descendant of &quot;Mayflower&quot; passenger John Howland. Lloyd was raised in Westport, Connecticut, where he attended Staples High School and was involved in founding the high school&#x27;s theater company, the Staples Players.

== Career ==

Lloyd began his career apprenticing at summer theaters in Mount Kisco, New York, and Hyannis, Massachusetts. He took acting classes in New York City at age 19—some at the Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre with Sanford Meisner—and he recalled making his New York theater debut in a 1961 production of Fernando Arrabal&#x27;s play &quot;And They Put Handcuffs on the Flowers&quot;, saying, &quot;I was a replacement and it was my first sort of job in New York.&quot; He made his Broadway debut in the short-lived &quot;Red, White and Maddox&quot; (1969), and went on to Off-Broadway roles in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;, &quot;Kaspar&quot; (February 1973), &quot;The Harlot and the Hunted&quot;, &quot;The Seagull&quot; (January 1974), &quot;Total Eclipse&quot; (February 1974), &quot;Macbeth&quot;, &quot;In the Boom Boom Room&quot;, &quot;Cracks&quot;, &quot;Professional Resident Company&quot;, &quot;What Every Woman Knows&quot;, &quot;The Father&quot;, &quot;King Lear&quot;, &quot;Power Failure&quot; and, in mid-1972, appeared in a Jean Cocteau double bill, &quot;Orphée&quot; and &quot;The Human Voice&quot;, at the Jean Cocteau Theater at 43 Bond Street.

Lloyd returned to Broadway for the musical &quot;Happy End&quot;. He performed in Andrzej Wajda&#x27;s adaptation of Fyodor Dostoevsky&#x27;s &quot;The Possessed&quot; at Yale Repertory Theater, and in Jay Broad&#x27;s premiere of &quot;White Pelican&quot; at the P.A.F. Playhouse in Huntington Station, New York, on Long Island.

In 1977, he said of his training at the Neighborhood Playhouse under Meisner, &quot;My work up to then had been very uneven. I would be good one night, dull the next. Meisner made me aware of how to be consistent in using the best that I have to offer. But I guess nobody can teach you the knack, or whatever it is, that helps you come to life on stage.&quot;

His first film role was psychiatric patient Max Taber in &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot; (1975), alongside future co-star Danny DeVito. He is known for his work as &quot;Reverend&quot; Jim Ignatowski, the ex-hippie cabbie on the sitcom &quot;Taxi&quot;, for which he won two Primetime Emmy Awards for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series; and the eccentric inventor Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown in the &quot;Back to the Future&quot; trilogy for which he was nominated for a Saturn Award. In 1985, he appeared in the pilot episode of &quot;Street Hawk&quot;. The following year, he played the reviled Professor B.O. Beanes on the television series &quot;Amazing Stories&quot;. Other roles include Klingon Commander Kruge in &quot;Star Trek III: The Search for Spock&quot; (1984) (on suggestion of fellow actor and friend Leonard Nimoy), Professor Plum in &quot;Clue&quot; (1985), Professor Dimple in an episode of &quot;Road to Avonlea&quot; (for which he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series), the villain Judge Doom in &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; (1988), Merlock the Sorcerer in &quot;DuckTales the Movie&quot; (1990), Switchblade Sam in &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot; (1993), Zoltan in &quot;Radioland Murders&quot; (1994), and Uncle Fester in &quot;The Addams Family&quot; (1991) and &quot;Addams Family Values&quot; (1993).

Lloyd portrayed the star character in the adventure game &quot;Toonstruck&quot;, released in November 1996. In 1999, he was reunited onscreen with Michael J. Fox in an episode of &quot;Spin City&quot; entitled &quot;Back to the Future IV — Judgment Day&quot;, in which Lloyd plays Owen Kingston, the former mentor of Fox&#x27;s character, Mike Flaherty, who stopped by City Hall to see Kingston, only to proclaim himself God. That same year, Lloyd starred in the film remake of the 1960s series &quot;My Favorite Martian&quot;. He starred on the television series &quot;Deadly Games&quot; in the mid-1990s and was a regular on the sitcom &quot;Stacked&quot; in the mid-2000s. In 2003, he guest-starred in three of the 13 produced episodes of &quot;Tremors: The Series&quot; as the character Cletus Poffenburger. In November 2007, Lloyd was reunited onscreen with his former &quot;Taxi&quot; co-star Judd Hirsch in the season-four episode &quot;Graphic&quot; of the television series &quot;Numb3rs&quot; as Ross Moore. He then played the role of Ebenezer Scrooge in a 2008 production of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; at the Kodak Theatre with John Goodman and Jane Leeves. In 2009, he appeared in a comedic trailer for a faux horror film version of &quot;Willy Wonka &amp; the Chocolate Factory&quot; entitled &quot;Gobstopper&quot;, in which he played Willy Wonka as a horror film-style villain.

In 2010, the Vermont-based Weston Playhouse, of which Lloyd&#x27;s brother Sam was an active member, asked if there was a role Lloyd would be interested in taking on. Lloyd chose Willy Loman in &quot;Death of a Salesman&quot;, which played at Weston and at other venues throughout Vermont that fall. Also that September, he reprised his role as Dr. Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown in &quot;Back to the Future: The Game&quot;, an episodic adventure game series developed by Telltale Games. That same month, the production company 3D Entertainment Films announced Lloyd would star as an eccentric professor who with his lab assistant explore the various dimensions in &quot;Time, the Fourth Dimension&quot;, an approximately 45-minute Imax 3D film that was planned for release in 2012.

On January 21, 2011, he appeared in &quot;The Firefly&quot; episode of the J. J. Abrams television series &quot;Fringe&quot; as Roscoe Joyce. That August, he reprised the role of Dr. Emmett Brown (from &quot;Back to the Future&quot;) as part of an advertising campaign for Garbarino, an Argentine appliance company, and also as part of Nike&#x27;s &quot;Back For the Future&quot; campaign for the benefit of The Michael J. Fox Foundation. In 2012 and 2013, Lloyd reprised the role of Doc Brown in two episodes of the stopmotion series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot;. He was a guest star on the 100th episode of the USA Network sitcom &quot;Psych&quot; as Martin Khan in 2013.

In May 2013, Lloyd appeared as the narrator and the character Azdak in the Bertolt Brecht play &quot;The Caucasian Chalk Circle&quot;, produced by the Classic Stage Company in New York.

On the October 21, 2015, episode of &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live&quot;, Lloyd and Michael J. Fox appeared in a &quot;Back to the Future&quot; skit to commemorate the date in the second installment of the film trilogy.

In May 2018, Lloyd made a cameo appearance in the episode titled &quot;No Country for Old Women&quot; of &quot;Roseanne&quot;, where he played the role of Lou, the boyfriend to the mother of Roseanne and Jackie. He is set to reprise the role in an episode of its spin-off, &quot;The Conners&quot;, airing May 4, 2022. In late 2019, he provided the voice of Xehanort in the &quot;Re Mind&quot; downloadable content of &quot;Kingdom Hearts III&quot;, taking over the role from the late Leonard Nimoy and Rutger Hauer, and reprised the role in the 2020 video game &quot;Kingdom Hearts: Melody of Memory&quot;.

By July 2020, Lloyd was cast as The Alchemist in &quot;Man &amp; Witch&quot;, a family-friendly fantasy-adventure film directed by Rob Margolies, with Jim Henson&#x27;s Creature Shop set to create the puppets for the film.

In March 2021, Lloyd played the best friend of William Shatner in the romantic comedy film &quot;Senior Moment&quot;, also starring Jean Smart.
In September 2021, Lloyd portrayed Rick Sanchez in a series of promotional interstitials directed by Paul B. Cummings for the two-part fifth season finale of &quot;Rick and Morty&quot;, a character inspired by Lloyd&#x27;s portrayal of Dr. Emmett &quot;Doc&quot; Brown from &quot;Back to the Future&quot;, alongside Jaeden Martell as Morty Smith. Addressing his own and original voice actor Justin Roiland&#x27;s portrayals of Sanchez compared to Doc Brown, Lloyd stated that &quot;he felt like Doc and Rick were like two brothers that took different paths.&quot;

In March 2022, Lloyd appeared in a promotion for the time travel film &quot;The Adam Project&quot; along with two of its stars, Ryan Reynolds and Mark Ruffalo.

In April 2022, it was announced that Lloyd would star in &quot;Spirit Halloween: The Movie&quot;, a film produced in partnership with the Spirit Halloween retailer. He plays Alec Windsor, a wealthy land developer who disappeared one Halloween night, and whose spirit is said to haunt the town in which the film is set each year on Halloween. The film was released on video-on-demand (VOD) on October 11, 2022.

In April 2023, Lloyd guest starred in an episode of the third season of &quot;The Mandalorian&quot;, portraying the role of Commissioner Helgait. More recently, he was announced to be starring in the live-action &quot;Knuckles&quot; series.

== Personal life ==
Lloyd married Catharine Dallas Dixon Boyd on June 6, 1959. They divorced in 1971. He married actress Kay Tornborg in 1974, divorcing her circa 1987. Lloyd&#x27;s third marriage, to Carol Ann Vanek, had lasted more than two years when they were in the process of divorce in July 1991. His fourth marriage, to screenwriter Jane Walker Wood, lasted from 1992 to 2005.
In 2016, he married Lisa Loiacono, who was Lloyd&#x27;s real estate agent when he sold his house in Montecito, California, in 2012. His former house on that lot was destroyed in the Tea Fire of November 2008.

Lloyd&#x27;s philanthropist mother, Ruth Lapham Lloyd, died in 1984 at age 88. Her other surviving children were Donald L. Mygatt (who died in 2003), Antoinette L. Mygatt Lucas, Samuel Lloyd III (who later died in 2017), Ruth Lloyd Scott, Ax Lloyd, and Adele L. Kinney. Lloyd&#x27;s nephew, Sam Lloyd (1963–2020), was known for playing lawyer Ted Buckland on &quot;Scrubs&quot;.

<text>The sinarapan or tabyos (Mistichthys luzonensis) is a species of fish in the goby subfamily, Gobionellinae, and the only member of the monotypic genus Mistichthys. It is endemic to the Philippines, where it occurs along the Bicol River and in Lakes Buhi, Bato, Lakelets Katugday and Manapao (both in Buhi) in Camarines Sur and in Danao Lake in Polangui, Albay.

The fish grows up to 2.5 centimeters long. It is transparent with a few dark spots and black eyes.

This freshwater fish lives in lakes from the shoreline to 12 meters in depth.

Tabyos is considered a delicacy, and it is of economic importance locally. It has been listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot; as the &quot;smallest commercially-harvested food fish&quot;. It is harvested with nets and palm leaves. It tends to school, making it easier to catch. It has been taken in large numbers since the 1940s, when it first became popular as food. It is fried or boiled and served with vegetables.

By the 1990s it had become clear that the sinarapan was overfished and was nearing extinction. It was also negatively affected by introduced species of fish in its native lakes, particularly the Nile tilapia (&quot;Oreochromis niloticus&quot;). Conservation actions taken include the transfer of thousands of sinarapan to safer lakes where they might reproduce effectively. The transport of the fish was difficult because it is very delicate, and well over half of each load died during the process. By 2001 there was evidence of successful reproduction in the new habitat.

<text>Discounts are reductions applied to the basic sale price of goods or services. Allowances against price may have a similar effect

Discounting practices operate within both business-to-business and business-to-consumer contexts. Discounts can occur anywhere in the distribution channel, modifying either the manufacturer&#x27;s list price (determined by the manufacturer and often printed on the package), the retail price (set by the retailer and often attached to the product with a sticker), or a quoted price specific to a potential buyer, often given in written form.

There are many purposes for discounting, including to increase short-term sales, to move out-of-date stock, to reward valuable customers, to encourage distribution channel members to perform a function, or to otherwise reward behaviors that benefit the discount issuer. Some discounts and allowances are forms of sales promotion. Many are price discrimination methods that allow the seller to capture some of the consumer surplus.

== Dealing with payment ==
===Trade discounts===
&quot;Trade discounts&quot; are deductions against the list price or catalogue price which are charged by a wholesaler or manufacturer to a retailer or supplier who then deals with the end customer. The discount then enables the retailer to charge the end customer the list price and cover its own costs/profit.

=== Prompt payment discount ===
&quot;Cash discounts&quot; are reductions in price given to the debtor to motivate the debtor to make payment within specified time. These discounts are intended to speed payment and thereby provide cash flow to the firm. They are sometimes used as a promotional device. A UK survey undertaken by the British Chambers of Commerce found that 13% of UK businesses offered prompt payment discounts (PPDs).

==== Examples ====
* 2/10 net 30 - this means the buyer must pay within 30 days of the invoice date, but will receive a 2% discount if they pay within 10 days of the invoice date.
* 3/7 EOM - this means the buyer will receive a cash discount of 3% if the bill is paid within 7 days after the end of the month indicated on the invoice date. If an invoice is received on or before the 25th day of the month, payment is due on the 7th day of the next calendar month. If a proper invoice is received after the 25th day of the month, payment is due on the 7th day of the second calendar month.
* 3/7 EOM net 30 - this means the buyer must pay within 30 days of the invoice date, but will receive a 3% discount if they pay within 7 days after the end of the month indicated on the invoice date. If an invoice is received on or before the 25th day of the month, payment is due on the 7th day of the next calendar month. If a proper invoice is received after the 25th day of the month, payment is due on the 7th day of the second calendar month.
* 2/15 net 40 ROG - this means the buyer must pay within 40 days of receipt of goods, but will receive a 2% discount if paid in 15 days of the invoice date. (ROG is short for &quot;receipt of goods&quot;.)

====Taxation treatment====
Before 2014, suppliers in the United Kingdom were permitted to add VAT to the discounted price, even if payment was not made within the discount period and therefore due in full. This provision generated a shortfall in taxation revenue and also meant that UK practices were not in line with the EU&#x27;s VAT Directive of 2006, which specified that value added tax was to be levied on the actual price paid. Proposals were put forward in the budget of 2014 to amend the UK&#x27;s taxation law in this respect. In the telecommunications and broadcasting sectors (where there was no obligation to provide a VAT invoice), the law was amended from 1 May 2014, while in other sectors of the economy, the change was effective from 1 April 2015.

=== Preferred payment method discount ===
Some retailers (particularly small retailers with low margins) offer discounts to customers paying with cash, to avoid paying fees on credit card transactions.

=== Partial payment discount ===
Similar to the trade discount, this is used when the seller wishes to improve cash flow or liquidity, but finds that the buyer typically is unable to meet the desired discount deadline. A partial discount for whatever payment the buyer makes helps the seller&#x27;s cash flow partially.

=== Sliding scale ===

A discount offered based on one&#x27;s ability to pay. More common with non-profit organizations than with for-profit retail.

=== Forward dating ===
This is where the purchaser doesn’t pay for the goods until well after they arrive. The date on the invoice is moved forward - example: purchase goods in November for sale during the December holiday season, but the payment date on the invoice is January 27.

=== Seasonal discount ===

These are price reductions given when an order is placed in a slack period (example: purchasing skis in April in the northern hemisphere, or in September in the southern hemisphere). On a shorter time scale, a happy hour may fall in this category. Retailers organize big discounts on almost every season in order to make space for new inventory for the upcoming season.

Generally, this discount is referred to as &quot;X-Dating&quot; or &quot;Ex-Dating&quot;. An example of X-Dating would be:
* 3/7 net 30 extra 10 - this means the buyer must pay within 30 days of the invoice date, but will receive a 3% discount if they pay within 7 days after the end of the month indicated on the invoice date plus an extra 10 days.

=== Spaving ===

Spaving is a marketing strategy. Consumers are encouraged to spend money to gain access to savings. Spaving offers include free shipping at a certain threshold and buy one, get one free.

== Dealing with trade ==

=== Bargaining ===

Bargaining is where the seller and the buyer negotiate a price below the original selling price.

=== Trade discount ===
Trade discounts, also called functional discounts, are payments to distribution channel members for performing some function. Examples of these functions are warehousing and shelf stocking. Trade discounts are often combined to include a series of functions, for example 20/12/5 could indicate a 20% discount for warehousing the product, an additional 12% discount for shipping the product, and an additional 5% discount for keeping the shelves stocked. Trade discounts are most frequent in industries where retailers hold the majority of the power in the distribution channel (referred to as channel captains).

Trade discounts are given to try to increase the volume of sales being made by the supplier.

The discount described as trade rate discount is sometimes called &quot;trade discount&quot;.
Trade discount is the discount allowed on retail price of a product or something. 
for e.g. Retail price of a cream is 25 and trade discount is 2% on 25.

=== Trade rate discount ===
A trade rate discount, sometimes also called &quot;trade discount&quot;, is offered by a seller to a buyer for purposes of trade or reselling, rather than to an end user. For example, a pharmacist might offer a discount for over-the-counter drugs to physicians who are purchasing them for dispensing to the physicians&#x27; own patients. A seller supplying both trade or resellers, and the general public will have a general list price for anybody, and will offer a trade discount to bona-fide trade customers.

== Trade-in credit ==
Trade-in credit, also called trade-up credit, is a discount or credit granted for the return of something. The returned item may have little monetary value, as an old version of newer item being bought, or may be worth reselling as second-hand. The idea from a seller&#x27;s viewpoint is to offer some discount but have the buyer showing some &quot;counter action&quot; to earn this special discount. Sellers like this as the discount granted is not just &quot;given for free&quot; and makes future price/value negotiations easier. Buyers have the advantage of getting some value for something no longer used. Examples can be found in many industries.

== Dealing with quantity ==

These are price reductions given for bulk purchasing. The rationale behind them is to obtain economies of scale and pass some (or all) of these savings on to the customer. In some industries, buyer groups and co-operatives have formed to take advantage of these discounts. Iyengar and Jedidi note the popularity of quantity discounts being offered to both business purchasers and consumers. Generally there are two types:

=== Cumulative quantity discount ===
Cumulative quantity discounts, also called accumulation discounts, are price reductions based on the quantity purchased over a set period of time. The seller&#x27;s expectation is that they will impose an implied switching cost and thereby bond the purchaser to the seller.

=== Non-cumulative quantity discount ===
These are price reductions based on the quantity of a single order. The seller&#x27;s expectation is that they will encourage larger orders, thus reducing billing, order filling, shipping, and sales personnel expenses.

If a purchaser has to buy more than they need to secure a discount, we can distinguish between the surplus just not being used, or the surplus being a nuisance, e.g. because of having to carry a large container.

== Dealing with customer characteristics ==
The following discounts have to do with specific characteristics of the customer.

=== Disability discount ===
A discount offered to customers with what is considered to be a disability.

=== Educational or student discount ===

These are price reductions given to members of educational institutions, usually students but possibly also to educators and to other institution staff. The provider&#x27;s purpose is to build brand awareness early in a buyer&#x27;s life, or build product familiarity so that after graduation the holder is likely to buy the same product, for own use or for an employer, at its normal price. Providers also offer student discounts as means of offering a product within the budget of a student, which would otherwise be too expensive, thus gaining extra sales. Students may be able to get discounts on products, services, entertainment, and more. Educational discounts may be given by merchants directly, or via a student discount program. Many brands like Apple, Dell, give exclusive discounts to students on their tech products, so that the students get to learn from the latest technology available making their work lesser. Additionally, travel websites also offer student discounts to help make travel more affordable for students. Some websites may also offer other perks for students, such as free cancellations or additional loyalty points. Students can get discounts not only from tech and travel but also from lifestyle brands.

=== Employee discount ===
A discount offered by a company to employees who buy its products.

In 2005, the American automakers ran an &quot;employee discount&quot; for all customers promotional campaign in order to entice buyers, with some success.

=== Military discount ===
A discount offered to customers who are or were members of a military service. Types of military discounts include discounts for active-duty military, veterans, retired military personnel, and military spouses or dependents. In the United States, military discounts frequently require proof of ID to show eligibility such as a DD Form 214, DD Form 215, or DD Form 217 from any branch of the Armed Forces, TRICARE Cards, Veterans Affairs Cards Uniformed Services Privilege and Identification Cards (USPIC) or other official documentation. Eligibility for military discounts can also be verified online or via mobile by verification companies. In Australia, DefCom Australia is a similar discount card.

=== Age-related discounts ===

==== Toddler discount, child discount, kid discount ====
A discount, or free service, offered to children younger than a certain age, commonly for admission to entertainments and attractions, restaurants, and hotels. There may be a requirement that the child be accompanied by an adult paying full price. Small children often travel free on public transport, and older ones may pay a substantially discounted price; proof of age may be required.

==== Young person&#x27;s discount ====
Discounts are sometimes offered to young people below a certain age who are neither children nor in education, for example:
*In the UK, 16-25 railcards offer 1/3 discount on rail travel, and other discounts, in exchange for an annual fee 
*An Enhanced Partnership in the north east of England offers fares of £1 for a single bus journey for all under 22s on any bus service in the region.

==== Senior discount ====
A discount offered to customers who are above a certain relatively advanced age, typically a round number such as 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, and 75; the exact age varies in different cases. The rationale for a senior discount offered by companies is that the customer is assumed to be retired and living on a limited income, and unlikely to be willing to pay full price; sales at reduced price are better than no sales. Non-commercial organizations may offer concessionary prices as a matter of social policy. Free or reduced-rate travel is often available to older people (see, for example, Freedom Pass).

In the United States, most grocery stores offer senior discounts, starting for those age 50 or older, but most discounts are offered for those over 60.

==== First responder or healthcare worker discount ====
Discounts specially offered to firefighters, ambulance workers, police officers and other emergency services personnel are called first responder discounts. Hospital staff may sometimes receive discounts as well. In the United Kingdom, the &quot;Blue Light Card&quot; is an example of a discount scheme available to staff working for emergency services, the NHS, social care providers and the armed forces.

=== Special prices offered to friends of the seller ===
A discounted price offered to friends of the salesperson, an attitude which is parodied in the stereotype of a salesman saying &quot;It costs [such-and such], but for you...&quot; In Australia, New Zealand, and the UK, discounts to friends are known as &quot;mates&#x27; rates.&quot; In French this discount is known as &quot;&quot;. In Spain this is known as &quot;precio de amigo&quot; in Spanish, or &quot;preu d&#x27;amic&quot; in Catalan. In German the term &quot;Freundschaftspreis&quot; is commonly used.

=== Special prices offered to local residents ===
Discounts are common in tourist destinations. In Hawaii, for example, many tourist attractions, hotels, and restaurants charge a deeply discounted price to someone who shows proof that they live in Hawaii; this is known as a &quot;Kama&#x27;aina discount,&quot; meaning &quot;child of the land&quot; or a local resident. It may be referred to in Hawaii or elsewhere as a resident discount.

=== Discount card ===

Sometimes a document, typically a plastic card similar to a payment card, is issued as proof of eligibility for discounts. In other cases, existing documents proving status (as student, disabled, resident, etc.) are accepted. Documentation may not be required, for example, for people who are obviously young or old enough to qualify for age-related discounts. In some cases, the card may be issued to anyone who asks.

=== Coupons ===

Coupons are associated with Sunday circulars and help consumers who struggle to make ends meet. A coupon is a discount, either of a certain specified amount or a percentage to the holder of a voucher, usually with certain terms. Commonly, there are restrictions as for other discounts, such as being valid only if a certain quantity is bought or only if the customer is older than a specified age. Today coupons are not only printed in newspapers, and brochures. Coupons are offered to customers at the counter after they have paid for their purchase.

=== Rebates ===

A refund of part or sometimes the full price of the product following purchase, though some rebates are offered at the time of purchase. A particular case is the promise of a refund in full if applied for in a restricted date range some years in the future; the hope is that the promise will lure customers and increase sales, but that the majority will fail to meet the conditions for a valid claim.

=== Promotional allowance ===
Promotional allowances are also known as trade-in allowances. These are price reductions given to the buyer for performing some promotional activity. These include an allowance for creating and maintaining an in-store display or a co-op advertising allowance. Trade-in allowances are most common in the automobile industry, but they are also given for other durable goods.

=== Brokerage allowance ===
From the point of view of the manufacturer, any brokerage fee paid is similar to a promotional allowance. It is usually based on a percentage of the sales generated by the broker.

<doc id="256420" wikidata="Q210688" url="?curid=256420" title="Asuka period">
<text>The was a period in the history of Japan lasting from 538 to 710, although its beginning could be said to overlap with the preceding Kofun period. The Yamato polity evolved greatly during the Asuka period, which is named after the Asuka region, about south of the modern city of Nara.

The Asuka period is characterized by its significant artistic, social, and political transformations, having their origins in the late Kofun period. The introduction of Buddhism marked a change in Japanese society. The Asuka period is also distinguished by the change in the name of the country from to .

==Naming==
The term &quot;Asuka period&quot; was first used to describe a period in the history of Japanese fine-arts and architecture. It was proposed by fine-arts scholars and Okakura Kakuzō around 1900. Sekino dated the Asuka period as ending with the Taika Reform of 646. Okakura, however, saw it as ending with the transfer of the capital to the Heijō Palace of Nara. Although historians generally use Okakura&#x27;s dating, many historians of art and architecture prefer Sekino&#x27;s dating and use the term &quot;&quot; to refer to the successive period.

== Yamato Imperial Court ==
From the Asuka period in the 6th century, as a sub-division of the , is the first time in Japanese history when the Emperor of Japan ruled relatively uncontested from modern-day Nara Prefecture, then known as Yamato Province.

The second half of the Kofun period, exercised power over clans in Kyūshū and Honshū, bestowing titles, some hereditary, on clan chieftains. The Yamato name became synonymous with all of Japan as the Yamato rulers suppressed other clans and acquired agricultural lands. Based on Chinese models (including the adoption of the Chinese written language), they developed a central administration and an imperial court attended by subordinate clan chieftains but with no permanent capital. By the mid-seventh century, the agricultural lands had grown to a substantial public domain, subject to central policy. The basic administrative unit of the system was the county, and society was organized into occupation groups. Most people were farmers; others were fishers, weavers, potters, artisans, armorers, and ritual specialists.

==Soga clan and Shōtoku Taishi==

The Soga clan intermarried with the imperial family, and by 587 Soga no Umako, the Soga chieftain, was powerful enough to install his nephew as emperor and later to assassinate him and replace him with the Empress Suiko (r. 593–628). Suiko, the first of eight sovereign empresses, is sometimes considered a mere figurehead for Umako and Prince Regent Shōtoku Taishi (574–622). However she wielded power in her own right, and the role of Shōtoku Taishi is often exaggerated to the point of legend.

Shōtoku, recognized as a great intellectual of this period of reform, was a devout Buddhist and was well-read in Chinese literature. He was influenced by Confucian principles, including the Mandate of Heaven, which suggested that the sovereign ruled at the will of a supreme force. Under Shōtoku&#x27;s direction, Confucian models of rank and etiquette were adopted, and his Seventeen-article constitution prescribed ways to bring harmony to a chaotic society in Confucian terms.

In addition, Shōtoku adopted the Chinese calendar, developed a system of trade roads (the aforementioned &quot;Gokishichidō&quot;), built numerous Buddhist temples, had court chronicles compiled, sent students to China to study Buddhism and Confucianism, and sent Ono no Imoko to China as an .

Six official missions of envoys, priests, and students were sent to China in the seventh century. Some remained twenty years or more; many of those who returned became prominent reformers. The sending of such scholars to learn Chinese political systems showed significant change from envoys in the Kofun period, in which the five kings of Wa sent envoys for the approval of their domains.

In a move greatly resented by the Chinese, Shōtoku sought equality with the Chinese emperor by sending official correspondence that was addressed, &quot;From the Son of Heaven in the Land of the Rising Sun to the Son of Heaven of the Land of the Setting Sun.&quot;

Some would argue that Shōtoku&#x27;s bold step set a precedent: Japan never again accepted a &quot;subordinate&quot; status in its relations with China, except for Ashikaga Yoshimitsu, who accepted such a relationship with China in the 15th century.
As a result, Japan in this period received no title from Chinese dynasties, while they did send . From the Chinese point of view, the class or position of Japan was demoted from previous centuries in which the kings received titles. On the other hand, Japan loosened its political relationships with China and consequently established extraordinary cultural and intellectual relationships.

==Taika Reform and the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system==

===Taika Reform===

About twenty years after the deaths of Shōtoku Taishi (in 622), Soga no Umako (in 626), and Empress Suiko (in 628), court intrigues over succession led to a palace coup in 645 against the Soga clan&#x27;s monopolized control of the government. The revolt was led by Prince Naka no Ōe and Nakatomi no Kamatari, who seized control of the court from the Soga family and introduced the Taika Reform. The Japanese era corresponding to the years 645–649 was thus named , meaning &quot;great change&quot; in reference to the Reform. The revolt leading to the Taika Reform is commonly called the Isshi Incident, referring to the Chinese zodiac year in which the coup took place, 645.

Although it did not constitute a legal code, the Taika Reform mandated a series of reforms that established the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system of social, fiscal, and administrative mechanisms of the seventh to tenth centuries. was a code of penal laws, while was an administrative code. Combined, the two terms came to describe a system of patrimonial rule based on an elaborate legal code that emerged from the Taika Reform.

The Taika Reform, influenced by Chinese practices, started with land redistribution aimed at ending the existing landholding system of the great clans and their control over domains and occupational groups. What were once called became , as the court now sought to assert its control over all of Japan and to make the people direct subjects of the throne. Land was no longer hereditary but reverted to the state at the death of the owner. Taxes were levied on harvests and on silk, cotton, cloth, thread, and other products. A corvée (labor) tax was established for military conscription and building public works. The hereditary titles of clan chieftains were abolished, and three ministries were established to advise the throne:
* the Minister of the Left
* the Minister of the Right
* the Chancellor of the Realm
The country was divided into provinces headed by governors appointed by the court, and the provinces were further divided into districts and villages.

Naka no Ōe assumed the title of Crown Prince, and Kamatari was granted a new family name—Fujiwara—in recognition of his great service to the imperial family. Fujiwara no Kamatari became the first in a long line of court aristocrats. Another, long-lasting change was the use of the name , or sometimes in diplomatic documents and chronicles. In 662, following the reigns of Naka no Ōe&#x27;s uncle and mother, Naka no Ōe assumed the throne as Emperor Tenji, taking the additional title Emperor of Japan. This new title was intended to improve the Yamato clan&#x27;s image and to emphasize the divine origins of the imperial family in the hope of keeping it above political frays, such as those precipitated by the Soga clan. Within the imperial family, however, power struggles continued as the emperor&#x27;s brother and son vied for the throne in the Jinshin War. The brother, who later reigned as Emperor Tenmu, consolidated Tenji&#x27;s reforms and state power in the imperial court.

===&quot;Ritsuryō&quot; system===

The &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system was codified in several stages. The Ōmi Code, named after the provincial site of Emperor Tenji&#x27;s court, was completed in about 668. Further codification took place with the promulgation by Empress Jitō in 689 of the Asuka Kiyomihara Code, named for the location of the late Emperor Temmu&#x27;s court. The &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system was further consolidated and codified in 701 under the Taihō Code, which, except for a few modifications and being relegated to primarily ceremonial functions, remained in force until 1868.

Though the &quot;ritsu&quot; of the code was adopted from the Chinese system, the &quot;ryō&quot; was arranged in a local style. Some scholars argue that it was to a certain extent based on Chinese models.

The Taihō Code provided for Confucian-model penal provisions (light rather than harsh punishments) and Chinese-style central administration through the , which was devoted to Shinto and court rituals, and the , with its eight ministries (for central administration, ceremonies, civil affairs, the imperial household, justice, military affairs, people&#x27;s affairs, and the treasury). Although the Chinese-style civil service examination system was not adopted, was founded for training future bureaucrats based on the Confucian classics. Tradition circumvented the system, however, as aristocratic birth continued to be the main qualification for higher position, and titles were soon hereditary again. The Taihō Code did not address the selection of the sovereign. Several empresses reigned from the fifth to the eighth centuries, but after 770 succession was restricted to males, usually from father to son, although sometimes from ruler to brother or uncle.

Fujiwara no Fuhito, son of Nakatomi no Kamatari, was among those who produced the Taihō Ritsuryō. According to history book , two of the 19 members of the committee drafting the Taihō Code were Chinese priests (Shoku Shugen and Satsu Koukaku). Chinese priests also took an active part as linguistic specialists, and received rewards two times from Empress Jitō.

==Foreign relations==
Chinese culture had been introduced to Japan by the Three Kingdoms of Korea before the imperial Japanese embassies to China were established. Although the missions continued, the transformation of Japan through Chinese influences declined, despite the close connections that had existed during the early Kofun period. Meanwhile, the kingdoms of the Korean peninsula, often at odds with each other, frequently sent diplomatic missions with gifts to Japan, probably with the aim of securing Japanese neutrality or diplomatic/military support in their rivalries; ultimately, this proved to be of the greatest benefit to Baekje, as Japanese military support for that kingdom increased. People, many of them artisans and skilled workers, also emigrated to Japan from the Korean peninsula, including two high priests who arrived in Japan in 595: Eji from Goguryeo and Esō from Baekje. Kanroku also came from Baekje, and was a tutor to Prince Shōtoku, counseling him politically. When Japan allied with Baekje, the Goguryeo priests left Japan.
The Yamato court, concentrated in the Asuka region, exercised power over clans in Kyushu and Honshu, bestowing titles, some hereditary, on clan chieftains. The Yamato name became synonymous with all of Japan as the Yamato rulers suppressed the clans and acquired agricultural lands. Based on Chinese models (including the adoption of the Chinese written language), they developed a central administration and an imperial court attended by subordinate clan chieftains but with no permanent capital. By the mid-seventh century, the agricultural lands had grown to a substantial public domain, subject to central policy. The basic administrative unit was the county, and society was organized into occupation groups. Most people were farmers; other were fishers, weavers, potters, artisans, armorers, and ritual specialists.

From 600 to 659, Japan sent seven emissaries to Tang China. But for the next 32 years, during a period when Japan was formulating its laws based on Chinese texts, none were sent. Though Japan cut off diplomatic relations with China, Japan sent 11 emissaries to Silla, and Silla is also recorded in Nihon Shoki as sending embassies to Japan 17 times during the reigns of Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jitō. The ruling classes of Yamato and Baekje were on amicable terms, and Yamato deployed its navy to aid Baekje, in 660–663, against an invasion by Silla and Tang China (see battle of Baekgang).

Numerous official missions of envoys, priests, and students were sent to China in the seventh century. Some remained twenty years or more; many of those who returned became prominent reformers. In a move greatly resented by the Chinese, Shotoku sought equality with the Chinese emperor by sending official correspondence addressed &quot;From the Son of Heaven in the Land of the Rising Sun to the Son of Heaven of the Land of the Setting Sun.&quot; Shotoku&#x27;s bold step set a precedent: Japan never again accepted a subordinate status in its relations with China.

==Introduction of Buddhism==
The introduction of Buddhism to Japan is attributed to the Baekje king Seong in 538, exposing Japan to a new body of religious doctrine. The Soga clan, a Japanese court family that rose to prominence with the ascension of the Emperor Kinmei about 531, favored the adoption of Buddhism and of governmental and cultural models based on Chinese Confucianism. But some at the Yamato court—such as the Nakatomi family, which was responsible for performing Shinto rituals at court, and the Mononobe, a military clan—were set on maintaining their prerogatives and resisted the alien religious influence of Buddhism. The Soga introduced Chinese-modeled fiscal policies, established the first national treasury, and considered the kingdoms of Korea as trade partners rather than as objects of territorial expansion. Acrimony continued between the Soga and the Nakatomi and Mononobe clans for more than a century, during which the Soga temporarily emerged ascendant.

In the Taika Reform, the Funeral Simplification Edict was proclaimed, and the building of large &quot;kofun&quot; (tumuli) was banned. The edict also regulated size and shape of &quot;kofun&quot; by classes. As a result, later &quot;kofun&quot;, though much smaller, were distinguished by elaborate frescoes. Paintings and decorations in those &quot;kofun&quot; indicate the spread of Taoism and Buddhism in this period; the Takamatsuzuka Kofun and Kitora Kofun are notable for their wall paintings.

The use of elaborate kofun tombs by the imperial family and other elite thus fell out of use amidst the rise of prevailing new Buddhist beliefs, which put greater emphasis on the transience of human life. Commoners and the elite in outlying regions, however, continued to use kofun until the late seventh century, and simpler but distinctive tombs continued in use throughout the following period.

In 675 the use of livestock and the consumption of some wild animals (horse, cattle, dogs, monkeys, birds) was banned by Emperor Tenmu due to the influence of Buddhism. This ban was renewed throughout the Asuka period, but ended with the Heian period. The pest animals, deer and wild boar, were not affected by this ban.

==Influence of Taoism==
Taoism was also introduced during the Asuka period. The octagonal shape of monarchs&#x27; tombs of this age and the celestial maps drawn in the Kitora and Takamatsuzuka &quot;kofun&quot; reflect the Taoist cosmology.

Taoist belief was eventually amalgamated with Shintō and Buddhism to establish new styles of rituals. , a sort of Japanese geomancy and cosmology, is one of the fruits of these religious mixtures. While the Asuka period started with conflicts between clans over religious beliefs, later in the period, the imported religions became syncretized with Japan&#x27;s native folk beliefs.

==Art and architecture==

=== Asuka culture ===
Some architectural structures built in the period still remain today. Wooden buildings at Hōryū-ji, built in the seventh century, show some influence from Chinese and west Asian countries. For instance, the pillars at Hōryū-ji are similar to the pillars of the Parthenon of ancient Greece, as seen in their entasis. The is a transformation from the Indian mound-like reliquary structure called a &quot;stupa&quot;. In addition, mural paintings in the Takamatsuzuka and Kitora &quot;kofun&quot; dating from the fifth century show strong influence from Tang dynasty and Goguryeo wall painting.

The Japanese Buddhist sculpture art of this period is believed to have followed the style of the Six Dynasties of China. The characteristics of the sculptures of this age are also referred to as Tori Style, taken from the name of prominent sculptor Kuratsukuri Tori, grandson of Chinese immigrant Shiba Tatto. Some of the characteristics of the style include marked, almond-shaped eyes, and symmetrically arranged folds in the clothing. The most striking and distinguishing feature of these sculptures is an expression of the smile that is called the &quot;archaic smile&quot;. Kudara Kannon at Hōryū-ji is the most prominent Buddhist sculpture from this period.

===Hakuhō culture===
The second stage of Buddhist art, coming after the Asuka (cultural) period, is known as the , and is generally dated from the Taika Reform (646) until the moving of the capital to Nara in 710. During the latter half of the 8th century, a large number of songs and poems were composed and performed by various ranked people from warriors to the Emperor. The earliest collection of these poems is known as the . This includes works by several remarkable poets such as Princess Nukata and Kakinomoto no Hitomaro. also emerged as a new form of poetry at this time. This term was coined to distinguish native styles from those imported from China; within the umbrella of &quot;waka&quot; poetry, one of the more popular forms is known as . It consists of a total of 31 Japanese syllables (morae) divided over five lines, in the syllabic pattern 5/7/5/7/7.

<text>Carlo Azeglio Ciampi (; 9 December 1920 – 16 September 2016) was an Italian politician, statesman and banker who was the President of Italy from 1999 to 2006 and the Prime Minister of Italy from 1993 to 1994.

==Biography==
===Education===
Ciampi was born in Livorno. He received a B.A. in ancient Greek literature and classical philology in 1941 from the Scuola Normale Superiore di Pisa, one of the country&#x27;s most prestigious universities, defending a thesis, entitled &quot;Favorino d&#x27;Arelate e la consolazione Περὶ φυγῆς&quot;, under the direction of the Hellenist Augusto Mancini. Then he was called to military duty in Albania as a lieutenant. On 8 September 1943, on the date of the armistice with the Allies, he refused to remain in the Fascist Italian Social Republic, and took refuge in Abruzzo, in Scanno. He subsequently managed to pass the lines and reach Bari, where he joined the Partito d&#x27;Azione and thus the Italian resistance movement. In 1946 he married Franca Pilla. That same year, he obtained a B.A. in law from the University of Pisa and began working at the Banca d&#x27;Italia. He also joined the CGIL (Trade Union), which he left in 1980.

===Bank of Italy===
In 1960, he was called to work in the central administration of the Bank of Italy, where he became Secretary General in 1973, Vice Director General in 1976, and Director General in 1978. In October 1979, he was nominated Governor of the Bank of Italy and President of the national Bureau de Change, positions he filled until 1993.

===Political career===
Ciampi was the first non-parliamentarian prime minister of Italy in more than 100 years. From April 1993 to May 1994 he oversaw a technical government. Later, as treasury minister from 1996 to May 1999 in the governments of Romano Prodi and Massimo D&#x27;Alema, he was credited with adopting the euro currency. He chose the Italian design for the 1-euro coin, whereas all others were left to a television vote among some candidates the ministry had prepared. Ciampi chose the &quot;Vitruvian Man&quot; of Leonardo da Vinci, on the symbolic grounds that it represented man as a measure of all things, and in particular of the coin: in this perspective, money was at the service of man, instead of its opposite. The design also fitted very well on the bimetallic material of the coin.

According to the Italian weekly &quot;Famiglia Cristiana&quot;, in 1993 Ciampi was a member of the regular Masonic Lodge &quot;Hermes&quot; of Livorno which was affiliated to the Grand Orient of Italy and linked to the Rito Filosofico Italiano.

==President (1999–2006)==
Ciampi was elected with a broad majority, and was the second president ever to be elected at the first ballot (when there is a requirement of a two-thirds majority) in a joint session of the Chamber of Deputies, the Italian Senate and representatives of the Regions. He usually refrained from intervening directly into the political debate while serving as president. He often addressed general issues, without mentioning their connection to the current political debate, in order to state his opinion without being too intrusive. His interventions frequently stressed the need for all parties to respect the Constitution and observe the proprieties of political debate. He was generally held in high regard by all political forces represented in the parliament.

The possibility of persuading Ciampi to stand for a second term as president by the election 2006 – the so-called &quot;Ciampi-bis&quot; – was widely discussed, despite his advancing age, but it was officially dismissed by Ciampi himself on 3 May 2006: &quot;None of the past nine presidents of the Republic has been re-elected. I think this has become a meaningful rule. It is better not to infringe it&quot;. Ciampi, whose mandate was due to expire on the 18th, resigned on the 15th. His successor, Giorgio Napolitano took the oath on the same day.

As head of state of the host country, he officially declared the 2006 Winter Olympics open, on 10 February 2006. As president, Ciampi was not considered to be close to the positions of the Vatican and the Catholic Church, in a sort of alternate after the devout Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. He often praised patriotism, not always a common feeling because of its abuse by the Italian Fascist regime.

== Death ==
He died in Rome on 16 September 2016 at the age of 95. His funeral was officiated at the Church of San Saturnino in Rome on 19 September by Archbishop Vincenzo Paglia. A national day of mourning was proclaimed on the same day and flags were flown at half-mast.

<doc id="256425" wikidata="Q118997325" url="?curid=256425" title="Scow">
<text>A scow is a smaller type of barge. Some scows are rigged as sailing scows. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, scows carried cargo in coastal waters and inland waterways, having an advantage for navigating shallow water or small harbours. Scows were in common use in the American Great Lakes and other parts of the U.S., Canada, southern England, and New Zealand. In modern times their main purpose is for recreation and racing; there are also garbage scows for aquatic transport of refuse.

==Scows==
The name &quot;scow&quot; derives from the Dutch . Old Saxon has a similar word which means to push from the shore, clearly related to punting.

The basic scow was developed as a flat-bottomed barge ( a large punt) capable of navigating shallow rivers and sitting comfortably on the bottom when the tide was out. By 1848 scows were being rigged for sailing using leeboards or sliding keels. They were also used as dumb barges towed by steamers. Dumb scows were used for a variety of purposes: garbage (see The Adventures of Tugboat Annie), dredging (see Niagara Scow) as well as general estuarine cargos.

===Sailing scows===
Sailing scows have significant advantages over traditional deep-keel sailing vessels that were common at the time the sailing scow was popular. Keelboats, while stable and capable in open water, were incapable of sailing into shallow bays and rivers, which meant that to ship cargo on a keelboat required a suitable harbour and docking facilities, or else the cargo had to be loaded and unloaded with smaller boats. Flat-bottomed scows, on the other hand, could navigate shallow waters, and could even be beached for loading and unloading. This made them useful for moving cargo from inland regions unreachable by keelboat to deeper waters where keelboats could reach. The cost of this shallow water advantage was the loss of the seaworthiness of flat-bottomed scow boats in open water and bad weather.

The squared-off shape and simple lines of a scow make it a popular choice for simple home-built boats made from plywood. Phil Bolger and Jim Michalak, for example, have designed a number of small sailing scows, and the PD Racer and the John Spencer designed Firebug are growing classes of home-built sailing scow. Generally these designs are created to minimize waste when using standard 4-foot by 8-foot sheets of plywood.

The scow hull is also the basis for the shantyboat or, on the Chesapeake, the ark, a cabin houseboat once common on American rivers. The ark was used as portable housing by Chesapeake watermen, who followed, for example, shad runs seasonally.

The Thames sailing barge and the Norfolk wherry are two British equivalents to the scow schooner. The Thames sailing barges, while used for similar tasks, used significantly different hull shapes and rigging.

The term scow is used in and around the west Solent for a traditional class of sailing dinghy. Various towns and villages claim their own variants (Lymington, Keyhaven, Yarmouth, West Wight, Bembridge, Chichester), they are all around in length and share a lug sail, pivoting centre board, small foredeck and a square transom with a transom-hung rudder.

===Scow schooners===
An American design that reached its zenith of size on the American Great Lakes, and was also used widely in New Zealand, the schooner-rigged scow was used for coastal and inland transport, from colonial days to the early 1900s. Scow schooners had a broad, shallow hull, and used centreboards, bilgeboards or leeboards rather than a deep keel. The broad hull gave them stability, and the retractable foils allowed them to move even heavy loads of cargo in waters far too shallow for keelboats to enter. The squared-off bow and stern accommodated a large cargo. The smallest sailing scows were sloop-rigged (making them technically a &quot;scow sloop&quot;), but were otherwise similar in design. The scow sloop eventually evolved into the &quot;inland lake scow&quot;, a type of fast racing boat.

Sailing scows were popular in the American South for economic reasons, because the pine planks found there were difficult to bend, and because inlets along the Gulf Coast and Florida were often shallow.

===New Zealand trading scows===
The American scow design was copied and modified in New Zealand by early immigrant settlers to Auckland in the 1870s. In 1873, a sea captain named George Spencer, who had once lived and worked on the American Great Lakes and had gained a first-hand knowledge of the practical working capabilities of the sailing barges that plied their trade on the lakes, recognised the potential use of similar craft in the protected waters of the Hauraki Gulf, Auckland. He commissioned a local shipbuilder, Septimus Meiklejohn, to construct a small flat-bottomed sailing barge named the &quot;Lake Erie&quot;, which was built at Ōmaha, not far from Mahurangi. An account of the launching of this vessel appeared in 1873 in the Auckland newspaper, &quot;The Daily Southern Cross&quot;, which gave its readers a good idea of the distinctive construction and advantages over other vessels.

The &quot;Lake Erie&quot; was 60 feet 6 inches in length, seventeen feet 3 inches in breadth and had a draught of three feet 4 inches. It was fitted with lee boards (a type of keel slotted onto the sides of the vessel), but these were highly impracticable in rough weather on the New Zealand coast. Later scows were constructed with the much safer slab-sided centre board, which crews raised and lowered as required. This one small craft spawned a fleet of sailing scows that became associated with the gum trade and the flax and kauri industries of northern New Zealand.

Scows came in all manner of shape and sizes and all manner of sailing rigs, but the &quot;true&quot; sailing scow displayed no fine lines or fancy rigging. They were designed for hard work and heavy haulage and they did their job remarkably well. They took cattle north from the stockyards of Auckland and returned with a cargo of kauri logs, sacks of kauri gum, shingle, firewood, flax or sand. With their flat bottoms they could be sailed or poled much further up the many tributaries and rivers where the bushmen and bullock teams had the freshly sawn kauri logs amassed, thereby saving a great deal of time and energy on the part of the bushmen. Flat-bottomed scows were also capable of grounding on a beach for loading and unloading. Over the side went duckboards, wheelbarrows, and banjo shovels. The crew then filled the vessel with sand, racing against the turn of the tide. When the tide did turn, they loaded the equipment back on board and put off to sea. Occasionally an inexperienced skipper overloaded the scow. Then, as the water rose against the outside of the hull (diminishing the amount of safe &quot;free board&quot;), the crew had to shovel rapidly to reduce the contents in the hold to a safe level.

Logs when hauled were always carried above deck, secured by heavy chain, the space between decks being left empty to give added buoyancy. The logs were taken to Auckland and unloaded into floating &quot;booms&quot; to await breaking down in the sawmills of the Kauri Timber Company and other such mills that operated right on the edge of Auckland Harbour.

The golden age of scows and schooners lasted from the 1890s to the end of the First World War, when schooners were superseded by steamers and scows were gradually replaced with tugs.
The Subritzky family of Northland operated the scows &quot;Jane Gifford&quot; and &quot;Owhiti&quot; as the last fleet of working scows, operating between the Port of Auckland and the Island communities of the Hauraki Gulf. The &quot;Jane Gifford&quot; was gifted to the Waiuku Historical Society by Captain Bert Subritzky and his wife Moana in 1985, where it was re-masted and re-rigged to its original splendour. The &quot;Owhiti&quot; was sold to Captain Dave Skyme and fully restored to its 1924 sea worthiness, and it subsequently starred in the 1983 movie &quot;Savage Islands&quot; (starring Tommy Lee Jones and amongst others Kiwi icon and singer Prince Tui Teka as King Ponapa). Unfortunately the &quot;Owhiti&quot; was not maintained for a period of time, during which teredo shipworms destroyed much of her structure. She remains in a deteriorating condition at Opua. Her rig may see use in another scow when restored.

The main differences from American scows were sharper bows and favouring the ketch rig instead of the schooner rig, although a great many schooner- and topsail schooner-rigged vessels were built.
Some 130 scows were built in the north of New Zealand between 1873 and 1925; they ranged from 45 to 130 ft (14–40 m). New Zealand trading scows travelled all around New Zealand as well as to Australia and to the west coast of America although the majority were based in the Hauraki Gulf of New Zealand.

===Notable sailing scows===
The scow schooner &quot;Alma&quot; of San Francisco, built in 1891, restored in the 1960s, and designated a National Historic Landmark (NHL) in 1988, was one of the last scow schooners in operation. She is a small example, 59 feet in length, 22.6 feet in beam, with a draft of 4 feet and a loaded displacement of 41 tons.

&quot;Elsie&quot; was the last scow sloop operated on the Chesapeake Bay. Although sailing scows were once numerous around the Bay, they are poorly documented.

The &quot;Ted Ashby&quot; is a ketch-rigged scow built in 1993 and based at the New Zealand National Maritime Museum in Auckland, it regularly sails the Auckland harbour as a tourist attraction. It was named after an old-time New Zealand seafarer and scowman, Ted Ashby, who had the foresight to document much of the history of these coastal work horses in his book &quot;Phantom Fleet - The Scows and Scowmen of Auckland&quot;, which was published by A. H. &amp; A. W. Reed, Wellington, in 1976.

The &quot;Jane Gifford&quot; is a ketch-rigged deck scow built in 1908 by Davey Darroch, Big Omaha, New Zealand. The vessel was re-launched at Waiuku on the 28 November 1992, with Captain Basil Subritzky, the son of the late Captain Bert Subritzky and his family as guests of honour. The &quot;Jane Gifford&quot; then commenced sailings and tours on the Manukau Harbour between Waiuku and the Onehunga Wharf. In 1999 she was pulled out of the water for a rebuild, which commenced at Okahu Bay on the Waitemata Harbour. She then sat rotting until 2005, when she was moved to Warkworth for rebuilding. A full rebuild, using modern materials has been done at Warkworth, and the vessel was relaunched on 16 May 2009. She returned to sail later, and has been occasionally under sail in the Hauraki Gulf. She is the only original New Zealand scow still afloat to carry sail.

The &quot;Echo&quot; was built in 1905 of Kauri in New Zealand. She is 104 feet (32 m) long, with two masts and topsail rigged. Twin diesel engines were installed in 1920. In 1942–44 she was used by US forces in the Pacific, see USS Echo (IX-95). Her story was the basis for the 1960 film with Jack Lemmon, The Wackiest Ship in the Army and the 1965 TV series. She was nearly broken up in 1990, but is now preserved at Picton, New Zealand

Howard I. Chapelle documented a number of scows in his book &quot;American Small Sailing Craft&quot;.

===North American commercial scows===
Scows were widely used to carry freight and passengers along or across inland waterways, sometimes preceding the arrival of railway transportation. Many scows were pulled/pushed by a tug or shore cable, whereas others were powered only by the current.

Historic 19th-century US canals used work scows for canal construction and maintenance, as well as ice breaker scows, filled with iron or heavy objects, to clear ice from canals.

The Niagara Scow is a former dredging scow stuck on the rocks in the Niagara River upstream from the brink of Niagara Falls Horseshoe Falls since 1918. After being stuck in place for more than 100 years, in November 2019, the scow broke loose during a wind storm and moved closer to the edge of the Horseshoe Falls.

==Racing boats: the inland lake scows==
In the early 20th century, smaller sloop and cat rigged scows became popular sailboats on inland lakes throughout the midwestern United States. First popularized by Johnson Boat Works in Minnesota, these boats were distinguished by their larger sail plans, retractable bilgeboards, and (in some classes) twin rudders. There are many active racing classes throughout the Midwest, Western New York, the New Jersey Shore and parts of the South. These boats are traditionally identified by their class letters:
* A: The largest inland lake scow at 38 feet long, the A normally requires a crew of six or seven. The sail plan includes a mainsail, a jib, and a large asymmetrical spinnaker. It has twin rudders. A new A scow (with sails and a trailer) cost $200,000 in 2020. Once the fastest monohull sailboat in the world, has been clocked in at . It is possible to waterski behind these sailboats, as demonstrated by Buddy Melges.
* E: This is essentially a smaller version of the A scow. Only 28 feet long, it requires a crew of three or four. In 2007, the class association NCESA voted to make the asymmetrical spinnaker the class legal standard.
* M-16: This 16-foot scow crews two, and has a mainsail and jib but no spinnaker. It has tiny dual rudders like the A and the E. 
* M-20: A 20-foot version of the M-16, with the addition of a backstay, a tunnel hull, twin bilgeboards and rudders, and a spinnaker. Modern boats are built with both the symmetrical spinnaker, or the I-20 version with an asymmetrical spinnaker. Because of the hull configuration, at a substantial angle of heel, it is similar to having a catamaran on one hull: the ratio of waterline length to breadth increases dramatically, along with a geometric increase in speed.
* C: This is a 20-foot catboat with one large sail set far forward on the hull. It requires a crew of two or three. Unlike the A and E, the C-scow has a large, efficient single rudder. It has no permanent backstay, so jibing the boat requires the quick use of running backstays.
* MC: The MC is a &quot;mini-C&quot; of sorts, a 16-foot cat-rigged boat with a higher and narrower sailplan. It also has a large efficient single rudder. It can be sailed competitively by 1 person. This is a growing class, especially popular in the midwest and southern USA.
* 17: Introduced in 2005 by Melges Performance Sailboats, the 17 is a departure from traditional scow design. It has an asymmetrical spinnaker and retractable bowsprit, a high-roach full-battened mainsail, and unusually long and thin rudder and bilgeboards.
*Butterfly: This small scow is meant to be sailed by one person. It features a cat rig, and unlike the boats above, it has a daggerboard.

Contrary to the connotations of the old definition of &quot;scow&quot; (large and slow), the inland lake scows are extremely fast—the wide, flat bottom hull allows them to plane easily. As a consequence of this, the A scow is the highest rated centerboard boat according to the US Portsmouth yardstick numbers.

== Alternative design ==
A &#x27;semi-flying&#x27; scow that uses a host of design tricks, including wings/foils and a telescopic canting keel, a retractable bowsprit and an asymmetrical spinnaker, has been designed in France.

<doc id="256428" wikidata="Q272033" url="?curid=256428" title="County of Tripoli">
<text>The County of Tripoli (1102–1289) was one of the Crusader states. It was founded in the Levant in the modern-day region of Tripoli, northern Lebanon and parts of western Syria.
When the Frankish Crusaders, mostly southern French forces – captured the region in 1109, Bertrand of Toulouse became the first count of Tripoli as a vassal of King Baldwin I of Jerusalem. From that time on, the rule of the county was decided not strictly by inheritance but by factors such as military force (external and civil war), favour and negotiation. In 1289, the County of Tripoli fell to the Muslim Mamluks of Cairo under Sultan Qalawun, and the county was absorbed into Mamluk Sultanate.

==Capture by Christian forces==
Raymond IV of Toulouse was one of the wealthiest and most powerful of the crusaders. Even so, after the First Crusade, he had failed to secure any land holdings in the Near East. Meanwhile, the County of Edessa, the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Principality of Antioch had been established. Tripoli was an important strategic goal as it linked the French in the south with the Normans in the north. It was a fertile and well populated area. In 1102, Raymond IV occupied Tortosa (now Tartus) and in 1103, he prepared, together with veterans of the 1101 crusade, to take Tripoli.

===Citadel of Tripoli===

On a natural ridge, which he named &quot;Mons Peregrinus&quot; (, ), from Tripoli, Raymond IV (also known as Raymond de Saint-Gilles) began the construction of a large fortress, the Citadel of Tripoli ( &quot;Qalʻat Ṭarābulus&quot;), formerly also known as the &quot;Castle of Saint-Gilles&quot; ( &quot;Qalʻat Sān Jīl&quot;). Despite this new fortress and seasoned troops, Raymond IV&#x27;s siege of Tripoli failed to secure the port. He died on 25 February 1105.

===Succession===
Count William of Cerdagne, Raymond IV&#x27;s cousin and comrade, was supported by Tancred, Prince of Galilee, but his succession in the Tripoli campaign was challenged by Raymond IV&#x27;s illegitimate son, Bertrand of Toulouse. Bertrand of Toulouse, who was supported by Baldwin I of Jerusalem, arrived in the Near East with a substantial army and a large Genoese fleet.
In order to resolve the succession issue, Baldwin I created a partition treaty. It specified that William was to hold northern Tripoli and pay homage to Tancred, while Bertrand was to hold south Tripoli as a vassal of Baldwin. Under a united Christian onslaught, Tripoli fell on 12 July 1109, completing the Kingdom of Jerusalem. When William died of an arrow through the heart (some claim it was murder), Bertrand became the first count of Tripoli.

==Structure and devolution of power==
===Holdings and vassals===
The extent of the County of Tripoli was determined in part by pre-existing Byzantine borders and in part by victory in battle, tempered by the demands of neighbouring crusader states. At its height, the county controlled the coastline from Maraclea in the north to Beirut in the south. Inland, the county&#x27;s control extended to the Krac des Chevaliers fortress. The rich inland agricultural land of the Homs Gap was known as La Bocquée. 
The county was divided into &#x27;lordships&#x27;; areas based roughly around its coastal ports. The count of Tripoli himself held the port of Tripoli and its surrounds. He also controlled the hostile region of Montferrand, now modern-day Bar&#x27;in, Syria, lying to the east. Approximately one quarter of the land seized around Tripoli was given to the Genoese as payment for military aid. The Genoese admiral Guglielmo Embriaco was awarded the city of Byblos.

===Homage to the king===
The County of Tripoli was an autonomous state. Despite his contribution to its establishment, Baldwin I did not directly control the County of Tripoli. Nevertheless, the County of Tripoli owed fealty (allegiance) and homage (declarations of allegiance) to him, and he, in return, provided support to the county in times of trouble.

===Defence===
Although occupying a narrow coastal plain, the mountain range beyond was a natural defensive line for Tripoli. Several castle forts were built to defend the mountain passes.
Muslim forces (Turk and Egyptian) attacked the County of Tripoli along its borders, especially those to the east. In 1137, Raymond II, the reigning count, lost control of Montferrand. The Muslim position strengthened when the Hashshashin (Nizari Ismailis) forces formed in the Nosairi mountains to the north. In 1144, in order to increase the county&#x27;s defences, particularly against Zangi of Mosul, Raymond II gave the Knights Hospitaller large stretches of frontier land along the Buqai&#x27;ah plain. This included the castles of Krak des Chevaliers, Anaz, Tell Kalakh, Qalaat el Felis and Mardabech. In the 1150s, the defences were further strengthened by the presence of the Knights Templar at Tartus on the seashore.

===Religion===
In religious matters, the counties of the Kingdom of Jerusalem were expected to follow the lead of the Latin patriarch of Jerusalem. However, Count Pons had formed an alliance with Antioch, and acknowledged the Latin patriarch of Antioch. This was so even after a papal edict to the contrary.

== War with the Seljuk Empire ==
;Shaizar
As a vassal of the kings of Jerusalem, Bertrand of Tripoli was drawn into war with the Seljuk Turks. In 1111, Mawdud, a Turkish military leader, campaigned against Antioch and Edessa. Count Bertrand of Tripoli and King Baldwin I of Jerusalem marched to defend the Christians in the north. In joining Prince Tancred of Galilee and Count Baldwin II of Edessa at the Battle of Shaizar, their defence of the kingdom was successful.

;Hab
In 1119, the Seljuk Empire again attacked Antioch, winning the Battle of Ager Sanguinis. However, Count Pons of Tripoli and Baldwin II defended Antioch and, at the Battle of Hab, successfully defended the flank of the Christian forces.

;Azaz
In 1125, Count Pons of Tripoli marched against the Turks who had again attacked Edessa, this time besieging the town of Azaz. Pons of Tripoli, Baldwin II and Count Joscelin I of Edessa lured the Turks from Azaz and into an ambush on the plains, where the Turkish forces were defeated.

==Earthquake of 1170==
On 29 June 1170, an earthquake struck the region. The defensive forts of Krac des Chevaliers, Chastel Blanc and al-&#x27;Ariymah were damaged. The cathedral of St Mary in Tripoli township was destroyed. The earthquake of 1170 resulted in a brief truce between Nur al-Din and the county (unlike a previous less severe earthquake of 1157 where fighting continued).

== Contenders ==

===Bertrand of Toulouse, son of Alphonso-Jordan===

Alfonso Jordan (1103–1148) was the son of Raymond IV and his third wife, Elvira of Castile. Although he was born in Tripoli, Alphonso-Jordan was raised in France. In 1147, he joined the Second Crusade, which was launched in response to the loss of the County of Edessa to Turkish forces. Alphonso died, possibly poisoned, in Caesarea, in 1148. He had an illegitimate son, Bertrand of Toulouse, who continued his progress towards Tripoli. 
Count Raymond II (1115–1152), the grandson of Bertrand, Count of Tripoli, engaged his enemies, Nur al-Din and Unur of Damascus, to confront his cousin, Bertrand. The Turkish forces, having only recently battled Raymond II at the Siege of Damascus, attacked the castle of Arima (al-Ariymah). They captured Bertrand of Toulouse, who spent the following decade in Muslim prisons. He was released in 1159 following the intervention of Manuel Komnenos, emperor of Byzantium. Raymond II later regained Arima. In 1152, Raymond II was killed by the Assassins. He was the first recorded non-Muslim victim of this sect.

===Guy II Embriaco===
Bohemond VII (1261 – 19 October 1287) was Count of Tripoli and the nominal Prince of Antioch from 1275 until his death. From 1275 to 1277, Bartholomew, Bishop of Tortosa, was Bohemond VII&#x27;s regent. Paul of Segni, Bishop of Tripoli, who was a friend of the Templar Grandmaster, William of Beaujeu, opposed the succession of Bohemond VII. Ernoul wrote, &quot;This was the beginning of war between Bohemond VII and the Templars.&quot;
Guy II Embriaco (1277–1282) was a former vassal of Bohemond VII in Gibelet (Byblos). Grievances between them had led to enmity and this was part of a larger trade war between Genoa and the Venetians.
The Templars sought to unseat Bohemond VII by supporting Guy II Embriaco. Bohemond VII responded by sacking the Templar house in Tripoli and forests at Montroque. This action led to indecisive fighting over the following months at Botron, Fort Nephin, Sidon and at sea. In 1282, Guy II Embriaco and the Templars were ambushed in Tripoli. Guy, his brothers, and cousins were imprisoned at Fort Nephin and left to starve; his followers were blinded and the Templars were summarily executed.

===Benedetto I Zaccaria===
After the death of Bohemond VII in 1287, the resulting power vacuum moved the lords of the County of Tripoli to offer Benedetto I Zaccaria (1235–1307), a powerful Genoese merchant, control of the county. In Tripoli, a special non-aristocratic social status had been granted to people from the great mercantile cities of Europe, especially those from the maritime republics of Italy (&quot;e.g.&quot;, Venice). The communes elected Bartholomew Embriaco to the role of Mayor of Tripoli. He also promoted trade with the Genoese.
Bohemond VII had no issue. His mother, Sibylla of Armenia, was discounted in the succession because she was the friend of Bishop Bartholomew of Tortosa, considered an enemy of Tripoli. Bohemond VII&#x27;s younger sister, Lucie, established herself at Fort Nephin with the support of the Knights Hospitaller. Eventually, Bartholomew Embriaco and the communes decided they could not rule, while Benedetto I Zaccario declined the countship. Thus, after negotiations, Lucie became Lucia, Countess of Tripoli in 1288.

==Fall to the Muslims==

Constant infighting, lack of resources, a series of poor harvests, changes to trade routes and the local economy and Muslim and Mongol military pressure led to the decline of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. By the 1280s, only two crusader states remained; the remnants of Jerusalem and the County of Tripoli. Even though the Mamluk government of Egypt had a treaty with the county, in March 1289, Tripoli favoured an alliance with the Mongols and as a result Sultan Qalawun of Egypt attacked Tripoli. Despite desperate defense operations, the county fell and was merged with Qalawun&#x27;s empire.

<text>The Tungusic languages (also known as Manchu–Tungus and Tungus) form a language family spoken in Eastern Siberia and Manchuria by Tungusic peoples. Many Tungusic languages are endangered. There are approximately 75,000 native speakers of the dozen living languages of the Tungusic language family. The term &quot;Tungusic&quot; is from an exonym for the Evenk people (Ewenki) used by the Yakuts (&quot;tongus&quot;). 

==Classification==
Linguists working on Tungusic have proposed a number of different classifications based on different criteria, including morphological, lexical, and phonological characteristics. Some scholars have criticized the tree-based model of Tungusic classification and argue that the long history of contact among the Tungusic languages makes them better treated as a dialect continuum.

The main classification is into a northern branch and a southern branch (Georg 2004) although the two branches have no clear division, and the classification of intermediate groups is debatable.

Four mid-level subgroups are recognized by Hölzl (2018), namely Ewenic, Udegheic, Nanaic, and Jurchenic.

Alexander Vovin notes that Manchu and Jurchen are aberrant languages within South Tungusic but nevertheless still belong in it, and that this aberrancy is perhaps due to influences from the Para-Mongolic Khitan language, from Old Korean, and perhaps also from Chukotko-Kamchatkan and unknown languages of uncertain linguistic affiliation.

==History==
===Proto-Tungusic===
Some linguists estimate the divergence of the Tungusic languages from a common ancestor spoken somewhere in Eastern Manchuria around 500 BC to 500 AD. (Janhunen 2012, Pevnov 2012) Other theories favor a homeland closer to Lake Baikal. (Menges 1968, Khelimskii 1985) While the general form of the protolanguage is clear from the similarities in the daughter languages, there is no consensus on detailed reconstructions. As of 2012, scholars are still trying to establish a shared vocabulary to do such a reconstruction. The Lake Khanka region was found to present the most likely homeland, based on linguistic and ancient genetic data.

There are some proposed sound correspondences for Tungusic languages. For example, Norman (1977) supports a Proto-Tungusic &quot;*t&quot; &gt; Manchu &quot;s&quot; when followed by &quot;*j&quot; in the same stem, with any exceptions arising from loanwords. Some linguists believe there are connections between the vowel harmony of Proto-Tungusic and some of the neighboring non-Tungusic languages. For example, there are proposals for an areal or genetic correspondence between the vowel harmonies of Proto-Korean, Proto-Mongolian, and Proto-Tungusic based on an original RTR harmony. This is one of several competing proposals, and on the other hand, some reconstruct Proto-Tungusic without RTR harmony.

Some sources describe the Donghu people of 7th century BC to 2nd century BC Manchuria as Proto-Tungusic. Other sources sharply criticize this as a random similarity in pronunciation with &quot;Tungus&quot; that has no real basis in fact.

The historical records of the Korean kingdoms of Baekje and Silla note battles with the Mohe () in Manchuria during the 1st and 2nd centuries. Some scholars suggest these Mohe are closely connected to the later Jurchens, but this is controversial.

Alexander Vovin (2015) notes that Northern Tungusic languages have Eskimo–Aleut loanwords that are not found in Southern Tungusic, implying that Eskimo–Aleut was once much more widely spoken in eastern Siberia. Vovin (2015) estimates that the Eskimo–Aleut loanwords in Northern Tungusic had been borrowed no more than 2,000 years ago, which was when Tungusic was spreading northwards from its homeland in the middle reaches of the Amur River.

Wang and Robbeets (2020) place the Proto-Tungusic homeland in the Lake Khanka region.

Liu et al. (2020) revealed that Haplogroup C-F5484 and its subclades are the genetic markers of Tungusic-speaking peoples. C-F5484 emerged 3,300 years ago and began to diverge 1,900 years ago, indicating the approximate age of differentiation of Tungusic languages.

===Jurchen-Manchu language===
The earliest written attestation of the language family is in the Jurchen language, which was spoken by the rulers of the Jin dynasty (1115–1234). The Jurchens invented a Jurchen script to write their language based on the Khitan scripts. During this time, several stelae were put up in Manchuria and Korea. One of these, among the most important extant texts in Jurchen, is the inscription on the back of &quot;the Jin Victory Memorial Stele&quot; (&quot;Da Jin deshengtuo songbei&quot;), which was erected in 1185, during the Dading period (1161–1189). It is apparently an abbreviated translation of the Chinese text on the front of the stele. The last known example of the Jurchen script was written in 1526.

The Tungusic languages appear in the historical record again after the unification of the Jurchen tribes under Nurhaci, who ruled 1616–1626. He commissioned a new Manchu alphabet based on the Mongolian alphabet, and his successors went on to found the Qing dynasty. In 1636, Emperor Hong Taiji decreed that the ethnonym &quot;Manchu&quot; would replace &quot;Jurchen&quot;. Modern scholarship usually treats Jurchen and Manchu as different stages of the same language.

Currently, Manchu proper is a dying language spoken by a dozen or so elderly people in Qiqihar, China. However, the closely related Xibe language spoken in Xinjiang, which historically was treated as a divergent dialect of Jurchen-Manchu, maintains the literary tradition of the script, and has around 30,000 speakers. As the only language in the Tungusic family with a long written tradition, Jurchen-Manchu is a very important language for the reconstruction of Proto-Tungusic.

===Other Tungusic languages===
Other Tungusic languages have relatively short or no written traditions. Since around the 20th century, some of these other languages can be written in a Russian-based Cyrillic script, but the languages remain primarily spoken languages only.

==Research==
The earliest Western accounts of Tungusic languages came from the Dutch traveler Nicolaes Witsen, who published in the Dutch language a book, &quot;Noord en Oost Tartarye&quot; (literally &#x27;North and East Tartary&#x27;). It described a variety of peoples in the Russian Far East and included some brief word lists for many languages. After his travel to Russia, his collected findings were published in three editions, 1692, 1705, and 1785. The book includes some words and sentences from the Evenki language, then called &quot;Tungus&quot;.

The German linguist Wilhelm Grube (1855–1908) published an early dictionary of the Nanai language (Gold language) in 1900, as well as deciphering the Jurchen language for modern audiences using a Chinese source.

==Common characteristics==
The Tungusic languages are of an agglutinative morphological type, and some of them have complex case systems and elaborate patterns of tense and aspect marking. However, none of the languages have grammatical gender or noun classes. All Tungusic languages have postpositions. Counting is done in base ten, and the names of the cardinal numbers from 1 to 10 are cognates in most cases.

The normal word order for all of the languages is subject–object–verb.

===Phonology===
Tungusic languages exhibit a complex pattern of vowel harmony, based on two parameters: vowel roundedness and vowel tenseness (in Evenki, the contrast is back and front). Tense and lax vowels do not occur in the same word; all vowels in a word, including suffixes, are either one or the other. Rounded vowels in the root of a word cause all the following vowels in the word to become rounded, but not those before the rounded vowel. Those rules are not absolute, and there are many individual exceptions.

Vowel length is phonemic in most languages, with many words distinguished based on the distinction between short vowel and long vowel. Languages without long vowels consist of the Jurchenic languages (Jurchen, Manchu, Xibe) and the Hezhe language. Diphthongs also occur in all languages.

Tungusic words have simple word codas, and usually have simple word onsets, with consonant clusters forbidden at the end of words and rare at the beginning.

Below are Proto-Tungusic consonants as reconstructed by Tsintsius (1949) and the vowels according to Benzing (1955):


==Relationships with other languages==
Tungusic is today considered a primary language family. Especially in the past, some linguists linked Tungusic with Turkic and Mongolic languages, among others, in either the Altaic or the Transeurasian language family. However, the proposal that there are genetic rather than merely areal links remains highly controversial.

Some scholars believe that the language spoken in Europe by the Avars (who created the Avar Khaganate) is of Tungusic origin.

<text>QuickDraw was the 2D graphics library and associated application programming interface (API) which is a core part of classic Mac OS. It was initially written by Bill Atkinson and Andy Hertzfeld. QuickDraw still existed as part of the libraries of Mac OS X, but had been largely superseded by the more modern Quartz graphics system. In Mac OS X Tiger, QuickDraw has been officially deprecated. In Mac OS X Leopard applications using QuickDraw cannot make use of the added 64-bit support. In OS X Mountain Lion, QuickDraw header support was removed from the operating system. Applications using QuickDraw still ran under OS X Mountain Lion to macOS High Sierra; however, the current versions of Xcode and the macOS SDK do not contain the header files to compile such programmes.

==Principles of QuickDraw==
QuickDraw was grounded in the Apple Lisa&#x27;s LisaGraf of the early 1980s and was designed to fit well with the Pascal-based interfaces and development environments of the early Apple systems. In addition, QuickDraw was a raster graphics system, which defines the pixel as its basic unit of graphical information. This is in contrast to vector graphics systems, where graphics primitives are defined in mathematical terms and rasterized as required to the display resolution. A raster system requires much less processing power however, and was the prevailing paradigm at the time that QuickDraw was developed.

QuickDraw defined a key data structure, the graphics &quot;port&quot;, or GrafPort. This was a logical drawing area where graphics could be drawn. The most obvious on-screen &quot;object&quot; corresponding to a GrafPort was a window, but the entire desktop view could be a GrafPort, and off-screen ports could also exist.

The GrafPort defined a coordinate system. In QuickDraw, this had a resolution of 16 bits, giving 65,536 unique vertical and horizontal locations. These are numbered from -32,767 on the extreme left (or top), to +32,767 on the extreme right (or bottom). A window was usually set up so that the top, left corner of its content area was located at 0,0 in the associated GrafPort. A window&#x27;s content area did not include the window&#x27;s frame, drop shadow or title bar (if any).

QuickDraw coordinates referred to the infinitely thin lines &quot;between&quot; pixel locations. An actual pixel was drawn in the space to the immediate right and below the coordinate. This made it easier for programmers to avoid graphical glitches caused by off-by-one errors.

On the Macintosh, pixels were square, and a GrafPort had a default resolution of 72 pixels per inch, chosen to match conventions established by the printing industry of having 72 points per inch.

QuickDraw also contained a number of scaling and mapping functions.

QuickDraw maintained a number of global variables per process, chief among these being the current port. This originally simplified the API, since all operations pertained to &quot;the current port,&quot; but as the OS developed, this use of global state has also made QuickDraw much harder to integrate with modern design approaches such as multi-threading and pre-emptive multitasking. To address these problems, the Carbon API (a bridge between Mac OS 9 and Mac OS X) added additional parameters to some of the routines, allowing for the (opaque) storage of thread information and a new (non-polled) event structure.

==Graphics primitives==
Everything seen on a classic Mac OS screen is drawn by QuickDraw, but the library itself is quite low level. The primitive objects it can draw are:
* Lines
* Rectangles
* Rounded (and oval) cornered rectangles
* Ovals (including circles and ellipses)
* Arcs (and wedges), both circular and oval
* Polygons (arbitrary closed shapes built from a list of points joined by lines)
* Regions (arbitrary sets of pixels—see below)
* Bitmaps and Pixmaps
* Text

Each of these objects (except text) may be drawn using a &quot;pen&quot;, which can have any rectangular dimensions, pattern or color. Note that, because the pen is rectangular and axis-aligned, diagonal lines will end up thicker than horizontal or vertical ones. Shapes may be drawn filled or framed, using any pattern or color. A filled Arc forms a wedge. Text may be drawn in any installed font, in a variety of stylistic variations, and at any size and color. Depending on how the selected font is stored, text can be scaled in a variety of ways - TrueType fonts will scale smoothly to any size, whereas bitmap fonts do not usually scale well.

An important feature of QuickDraw was support for &quot;transfer modes&quot;, which governed how a destination pixel value was related to its previous value and the color of the object being drawn.

The set of attributes of the pen and text drawing are associated with the GrafPort.

Regions are a key data structure in QuickDraw. They define an arbitrary set of pixels, rather like a bitmap, but in a compressed form which can be very rapidly manipulated in complex ways. Regions can be combined (union), subtracted (difference), and XORed to form other Regions. They can be used within a GrafPort for clipping, or drawn filled or framed like any other shape. A series of framed shapes and connected lines may be combined into a Region. A Region need not consist of a contiguous set of pixels - disconnected regions are possible and common. Although regions could allow powerful graphic manipulations they are limited by the current implementation that restricts the maximum region data storage size to a sixteen bit value and so are not practical as a general-purpose drawing composition tool and practical use at high resolution is also restricted. Regions underpin the rest of QuickDraw, permitting clipping to arbitrary shapes, essential for the implementation of multiple overlapping windows. Invented by Bill Atkinson, Regions were patented as a separate invention by Apple.

A region is specified (after initial creation) by an &quot;opening&quot; of the region, drawing various QuickDraw shapes, and &quot;closing&quot; the region. Hidden routines construct the region as the QuickDraw commands are executed. Bitmaps may also be converted to regions, and bitmaps may be made from regions by &quot;painting&quot; or &quot;filling&quot; the region into a graphics port.

The internal structure of a region, other than the storage length and its bounding rectangle, is opaque - there are no Apple-published documents available, though the mechanism is outlined in the patent. Regions are implemented using both vertical and horizontal compression. A region is stored as a series of horizontal scan lines (&quot;rasters&quot;), each of which contains a vertical coordinate followed by a list of horizontal inversion coordinates. Each inversion point can be thought of as toggling inclusion in the region for all the points after it: the first point turns the region on, the second turns it off, and so on. Further compression is achieved by storing each line differentially: each line contains only the differences from the previous line rather than a full set of inversion points. Finally, identical adjacent scan lines are efficiently encoded by simply skipping them. In this way, a commonly used region, the rounded corner rectangle, is efficiently encoded, and complex operations such as region composition and image clipping may be done without requiring either extensive processor cycles or large amounts of memory. (The original systems executing QuickDraw code used processors operating at 8 megahertz clock rates and systems had but 128 kilobytes of writable memory.)

Because regions are bound to a specific orientation, a ninety degree rotation of a region would require both detailed reverse engineering of the structure and extensive coding. A general rotation is impractical when compared to rotating the original source boundary description and simply creating a new region. However, the API includes conversion routines to and from BitMaps. (Bitmaps may also be rotated using well known methods, but with various degrees of image degradation depending upon angle chosen, the storage and processor cycles available to the operation, and the complexity of the algorithm.)

Apple has recently (in the Carbon API) defined regions as an opaque structure under some program compilation options.

==Higher level operations==
Any series of graphics calls to QuickDraw can be recorded in a structure called a &quot;Picture&quot;. This can then be saved in memory and &quot;played back&quot; at any time, reproducing the graphics sequence. At playback time the picture may be placed at new coordinates or scaled without the loss of resolution commonly encountered in bitmap scaling. A picture can be saved to disk in which form it defines the Apple PICT format.

An entire BitMap (or PixMap, when referring to color images) may be copied from one GrafPort to another, with scaling and clipping. Known as blitting, or &quot;CopyBits&quot;, after the name of the function, this operation is the basis for most animation and sprite-like effects on the Mac.

QuickDraw provides a similar blitting function which is designed to implement scrolling within a GrafPort - the image in the port can be shifted to a new location without scaling (but with clipping if desired).

Each graphics primitive operation is vectored through the StdProcs, a series of function pointers stored in the GrafPort. This limited polymorphism permits individual operations to be overridden or replaced by custom functions, allowing printer drivers to intercept graphics commands and translate them to suitable printer operations. In this way, QuickDraw can be rendered using PostScript, a fact that enabled the Macintosh to practically invent desktop publishing.

Similar to a subclass, the Window data structure began with the associated GrafPort, thus basically making windows exchangeable with any GrafPort. While convenient, this made it easy to write erroneous code that passed an offscreen graphics port into API that expected a full-blown window.

==History==
QuickDraw started life as Lisa Graf as part of the Apple Lisa development. For the Macintosh it was initially simplified, but then later extended. Originally, QuickDraw GrafPorts only supported a bit depth of 1, that is one bit per pixel, or black and white. This suited the built-in screen of the early Macintosh, with its fixed size of 512×342 pixels. Limited color was supported using a crude planar model, allowing QuickDraw to drive some types of dot-matrix printer that used multi-colored ribbons, but very few applications supported this feature.

In 1987, the Macintosh II was launched, which was designed as a more conventional three-box design - Computer, monitor and keyboard all separate. Because the monitor was separate, and larger than the original Mac, the video architecture had to necessarily change. In addition, the Mac II took the Macintosh from black-and-white to full color. Apple also decided at this time to support a seamless desktop spanning multiple monitors, an industry first. Thus Color QuickDraw, a significant extension of the original QuickDraw, was created. At this time Bill Atkinson was busy with HyperCard, so the Color QuickDraw work was done by Ernie Beernink (then still 23 years old): Apple&#x27;s Dave Allen also credited Dave Fung. The original architecture lacked much provision for expandability, but using a series of hacks, the Apple developers managed to make the addition of color and the new video architecture virtually seamless to both developers and end users.

Color QuickDraw introduced new data structures, including GDevices to represent each attached video card/monitor, and a new color GrafPort (CGrafPort) structure to handle color, as well as PixMaps instead of BitMaps for multiple bits-per-pixel images. One of the hacks for compatibility used here was that the new structure was exactly the same size as the old one, with most data members in the same place, but with additional handles and pointers to color structures in place of the BitMap fields. The upper two bits of the &quot;rowBytes&quot; field were pressed into use as flags to distinguish a GrafPort from a CGrafPort (they were always zero on old-style GrafPorts because a BitMap could never feasibly be so wide as to ever set these bits). The use of these two high bits would come back to haunt QuickDraw later, as it forced a maximum row width of just 4,095 on 32-bit PixMaps, which became problematic for high-resolution graphics work. Later development (Mac OS 8.5/Carbon) eliminated this limitation but was not fully backward compatible. A Palette Manager was also added in Color QuickDraw which managed the arbitration of colors on indexed video devices. Most graphics primitives operations remained either unchanged (but would operate in color), or else new color versions of the black and white APIs were added.

Initially, Color QuickDraw was only capable of operating with 1, 2, 4 and 8-bit video cards, which were all that was available at the time. Soon after however, 24-bit video cards appeared (so-called true color), and QuickDraw was updated again to support up to 32 bits per pixel (in reality, 24 bits, with 8 unused) of color data (&quot;32-Bit QuickDraw&quot;). The architecture always allowed for this, however, so no new APIs were necessary. The color data structures themselves allowed a color depth of 1, 2, 4, 8, 15 and 24 bits, yielding 2, 4, 16, 256, 32,768 and 16,777,216 colors respectively, or 4, 16 and 256 scales of grey. QuickDraw took care of managing the resampling of colors to the available color depths of the actual video hardware, or transfer between offscreen image buffers, including optionally dithering images down to a lower depth to improve image quality. A set of color sampling utilities were also added so that programmers could generate optimal color palettes for use with indexed video devices.

The architecture of QuickDraw had always allowed the creation of GrafPorts and their associated BitMaps or PixMaps &quot;offscreen&quot;, where graphics could be composed in memory without it being visible immediately on the screen. Pixels could be transferred between these offscreen ports and the screen using the QuickDraw blitting function CopyBits. Such offscreen compositing is the workhorse for games and graphics-intensive applications. However, until the advent of 32-Bit QuickDraw, such offscreen worlds had to be created and set up by hand by programmers within their applications. This could be error-prone, as it involved three or more separate and fairly complex data structures (CGrafPort, PixMap and GDevice, and for indexed devices, the color look-up table and its inverse). With 32-Bit QuickDraw, OS support for handling this was added, with the &quot;Offscreen Graphics World&quot; or GWorld. The video buffer (PixMap) of a GWorld could be stored in main memory, or when available in unused parts of video ram where copying to the screen could be optimized for speed by avoiding the need to transfer a large amount of pixel data across the main memory bus.

With the advent of QuickTime, QuickDraw gained the ability to deal with compressed raster data, such as JPEG. The QuickTime Image Compression Manager integrated closely with QuickDraw: in particular, image decompression calls were full-fledged QuickDraw drawing calls, and if a picture was being recorded, the &quot;compressed&quot; data would be saved as part of the picture, for display when the picture was later drawn. The Image Compression Manager also added integration with ColorSync color matching.

After this, apart from back-end changes to optimize for new processor architectures (PowerPC), QuickDraw remained largely unchanged throughout the rest of the life of the classic Mac OS. QuickDraw GX and QuickDraw 3D shared the QuickDraw name and were able to interoperate with QuickDraw PixMap and picture data structures, but were otherwise completely separate in functionality.

With Mac OS X, QuickDraw became part of the Carbon API. In 2005, with the release of Mac OS X 10.4, QuickDraw was officially deprecated.

In 2010 with MacPaint 1.3&#x27;s source code release through the Computer History Museum, a historical version of QuickDraw source code became available too.

<text>The Moro Gulf is the largest gulf in the Philippines. It is located off the coast of Mindanao Island, and is part of the Celebes Sea. The gulf is one of the country&#x27;s tuna fishing grounds.

==Geography==
The gulf stretches between and is surrounded by the main section of Mindanao on the east, and the Zamboanga Peninsula of Mindanao on the west. The peninsula&#x27;s major drainage goes towards the gulf.

Sibuguey Bay and Illana Bay are its major bays.

Zamboanga City, which is an international port, is bound by the Gulf and Celebes Sea in the East. Cotabato City, on the eastern coast, is another major port.

==Earthquakes==
The Moro Gulf is also an area of significant tectonic activity with several fault zones in the region capable of producing major earthquakes and destructive local tsunamis, such as the devastating 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake which killed over 5,000 people and left over 90,000 people homeless as it hit the west coast of Mindanao.

<doc id="256447" wikidata="Q932179" url="?curid=256447" title="Pedipalp">
<text>Pedipalps (commonly shortened to palps or palpi) are the secondary pair of forward appendages among chelicerates – a group of arthropods including spiders, scorpions, horseshoe crabs, and sea spiders. The pedipalps are lateral to the chelicerae (&quot;jaws&quot;) and anterior to the first pair of walking legs.

==Overview==
Pedipalps are composed of six segments or articles. From the proximal end (where they are attached to the body) to the distal, they are: the coxa, the trochanter, the femur, the short patella, the tibia, and the tarsus. In spiders, the coxae frequently have extensions called maxillae or gnathobases, which function as mouth parts with or without some contribution from the coxae of the anterior legs. The limbs themselves may be simple tactile organs outwardly resembling the legs, as in spiders, or chelate weapons (pincers) of great size, as in scorpions. The pedipalps of Solifugae are covered in setae, but have not been studied in detail.

Comparative studies of pedipalpal morphology may suggest that leg-like pedipalps are primitive in arachnids. At present, the only reasonable alternative to this view is to assume that xiphosurans reflect the morphology of the primitive arachnid pedipalp and to conclude that this appendage is primitively chelate. Pedipalps are traditionally thought to be homologous with mandibles in crustaceans and insects, although more recent studies (e.g. using Hox genes) suggest they are probably homologous with the crustacean second antennae.

==Chelate pedipalps==

Chelate or sub-chelate (pincer-like) pedipalps are found in several arachnid groups (Ricinulei, Uropygi, scorpions and pseudoscorpions) but the chelae in most of these groups may not be homologous with those found in Xiphosura. The pedipalps are distinctly raptorial (i.e., modified for seizing prey) in the Amblypygi, Uropygi, Schizomida, and some Opiliones belonging to the laniatorid group.

==Spider pedipalps==
Pedipalps of spiders have the same segmentation as the legs, but the tarsus is undivided, and the pretarsus has no lateral claws. Pedipalps contain sensitive chemical detectors and function as taste and smell organs, supplementing those on the legs. In sexually-mature male spiders, the final segment of the pedipalp, the tarsus, develops a complicated structure (sometimes called the palpal bulb or palpal organ) that is used to transfer sperm to the female seminal receptacles during mating. The details of this structure vary considerably between different groups of spiders and are useful for identifying species. The pedipalps are also used by male spiders in courtship displays, contributing to vibratory patterns in web-shaking, acoustic signals, or visual displays.

The cymbium is a spoon-shaped structure located at the end of the spider pedipalp that supports the palpal organ. The cymbium may also be used as a stridulatory organ in spider courtship.

The embolus is a narrow whip-like or leaf-like extension of the palpal bulb.

<doc id="256448" wikidata="Q1156477" url="?curid=256448" title="Pasig River">
<text>The Pasig River (; ) is a water body in the Philippines that connects Laguna de Bay to Manila Bay. Stretching for , it bisects the Philippine capital of Manila and its surrounding urban area into northern and southern halves. Its major tributaries are the Marikina River and San Juan River. The total drainage basin of the Pasig River, including the basin of Laguna de Bay, covers .

The Pasig River is technically a tidal estuary, as the flow direction depends upon the water level difference between Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay. During the dry season, the water level in Laguna de Bay is low with the river&#x27;s flow direction dependent on the tides. During the wet season, when the water level of Laguna de Bay is high, the flow is reversed towards Manila Bay.

The Pasig River used to be an important transport route and source of water for Spanish Manila. Due to negligence and industrial development, the river suffered a rapid decline in the second half of the 20th century and was declared biologically dead in 1990. Two decades after that declaration, however, a renaturation program designed to revive the river has seen the return of life to the river, including eight fish species, 39 species of birds, and 118 species of trees and other vegetation. As a result, the Pasig River received the Asian River Prize by the International River Foundation (IRF) in 2019.

The Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) was a Philippine government agency established to oversee rehabilitation efforts for the river from 1999 until it was abolished in November 2019. Rehabilitation efforts are also aided by private sector organizations through raising funds or assisting river cleanups.

== Etymology ==

The river takes its name from the city of Pasig, which is named after the Tagalog word &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;a river that flows into the sea&quot; or &quot;the sandy bank of a river&quot;, with the former in reference to the Pasig River&#x27;s flow from Laguna de Bay towards Manila Bay and out into the South China Sea.

== Geography ==
The Pasig River winds generally northwestward for some from Laguna de Bay, the largest lake in the Philippines, to Manila Bay, in the southern part of the island of Luzon. From the lake, the river runs between Taguig and Taytay, Rizal, before entering Pasig. This portion of the Pasig River, to the confluence with the Marikina River tributary, is known as the Napindan River or Napindan Channel.

From there, the Pasig forms flows through Pasig until its confluence with the Taguig River. From here, it forms the border between Mandaluyong to the north and Makati to the south. The river then sharply turns northeast, where it has become the border between Mandaluyong and Manila before turning again westward, joining its other major tributary, the San Juan River, and then following a sinuous path through the center of Manila before emptying into the bay.

The whole river and most portions of its tributaries lie entirely within Metro Manila, the metropolitan region of the capital. Isla de Convalecencia, the only island dividing the Pasig River, can be found in Manila and is where the Hospicio de San Jose is located.

=== Tributaries and canals ===
One major river that drains Laguna de Bay is the Taguig River, which enters into Taguig before becoming the Pateros River; it is the border between the municipalities of Pateros and Makati. The Pateros River then enters the confluence where the Napindan Channel and Marikina River meet. The Marikina River is the larger of the two major tributaries of the Pasig River, and it flows southward from the mountains of Rizal and cuts through the Marikina Valley. The San Juan River drains the plateau on which Quezon City stands; its major tributary is Diliman Creek.

Within the city of Manila, various &quot;esteros&quot; (canals) criss-cross through the city and connect with the Tullahan River in the north and the Parañaque River to the west.

=== Crossings ===

A total of 20 bridges currently cross the Pasig. The first bridge from the source at Laguna de Bay is the Napindan Bridge, followed by the Arsenio Jimenez Bridge to its west. Crossing the Napindan Channel in Pasig is the Bambang Bridge. It is followed by the Kaunlaran Bridge that connects barangays and Sumilang in Pasig.

The next bridge downstream is the C.P. Garcia Bridge carrying C-5 Road and connecting the cities of Makati and Pasig. It is followed by the Sta. Monica–Lawton Bridge, the newest bridge opened in June 2021 that connects Lawton Avenue in Makati to Fairlane Street in Pineda, Pasig as part of the Bonifacio Global City–Ortigas Link Road project approved in 2015.

The Guadalupe Bridge between Makati and Mandaluyong carries Epifanio de los Santos Avenue, the major artery of Metro Manila, as well as the MRT Line 3 from Guadalupe station to Boni station. The Estrella–Pantaleon and Makati–Mandaluyong Bridges likewise connect the two cities downstream, with the latter forming the end of Makati Avenue.

The easternmost crossing in Manila is Lambingan Bridge in the district of Santa Ana. It is then followed by the Tulay Pangarap Footbridge (Abante Bridge), the newest pedestrian bridge that connects the Punta area and Santa Ana proper. It is followed by the Abante Bridge (Tulay Pangarap Footbridge) in Santa Ana, Skyway Stage 3, and the Padre Zamora (Pandacan) Bridge connecting Pandacan and Santa Mesa districts, and carries the southern line of the Philippine National Railways. The expressway bridge of Skyway Stage 3, serving as a connection road between the North Luzon Expressway and the South Luzon Expressway, is built near the mouth of the San Juan River where most parts of it is built and another bridge parallel to Padre Zamora and PNR bridges will be built to merge with NLEX Connector in Santa Mesa; it will thus serve as a solution to heavy traffic along EDSA. The Mabini Bridge (formerly Nagtahan Bridge) provides a crossing for Nagtahan Street, part of C-2 Road. Ayala Bridge carries Ayala Boulevard, and connects the Isla de Convalecencia to both banks of the Pasig.

Further downstream are the Quezon Bridge from Quiapo to Ermita, the Line 1 bridge from Central Terminal station to Carriedo station, MacArthur Bridge from Santa Cruz to Ermita, and the Jones Bridge from Binondo to Ermita. The last bridge near the mouth of the Pasig is the Roxas Bridge (also known as M. Lopez Bridge and formerly called Del Pan Bridge) from San Nicolas to Port Area and Intramuros.

=== Landmarks ===
The growth of Manila along the banks of the Pasig River has made it a focal point for development and historical events. The foremost landmark on the banks of the river is the walled district of Intramuros, located near the mouth of the river on its southern bank. It was built by the Spanish colonial government in the 16th century. Further upstream is the Hospicio de San Jose, an orphanage located on Pasig&#x27;s sole island, the &quot;Isla de Convalescencia&quot;. On the northern bank stands the Quinta Market in Quiapo, Manila&#x27;s central market, and Malacañan Palace, the official residence of the President of the Philippines. Also on the Pasig River&#x27;s northern bank and within the Manila district of Sta. Mesa is the main campus of the Polytechnic University of the Philippines.

In Makati, along the southern bank of Pasig, are Circuit Makati (the former Santa Ana Race Track), the Poblacion sewage treatment plant and pumping station of Manila Water, and the Rockwell Center, a high-end office and commercial area containing the Power Plant Mall. At the confluence of the Pasig and Marikina rivers is the Napindan Hydraulic Control Structure, which regulates the flow of water from the Napindan Channel.

==== Geographical landmarks ====
The third chapter of Jose Rizal&#x27;s novel &quot;El filibusterismo&quot; mentions several stories surrounding certain geographical features along the Pasig River during the Spanish colonial era, such as the &quot;Buwayang Bato&quot;, the &quot;Malapad na Bato&quot;, and Doña Geromina&#x27;s Cave.

Doña Geromina&#x27;s Cave, according to legend, was built by the Archbishop of Manila as a sanctuary for his former lover. The cave is believed to be located in Barangay Pineda, Pasig under the Bagong Ilog Bridge, which carries Circumferential Road 5 between Pasig and Taguig.

=====Malapad na Bato=====
In what is now Barangay West Rembo, Taguig, a cliff along the river is known as &quot;Malapad-na-bato&quot; (), which was considered to be sacred to the early Tagalog people as a home to spirits. After the Nuestra Señora de Gracia Church was completed in 1630, it eventually became a pilgrimage site for newly converted Christians, resulting in a decline in the importance of &quot;Malapad-na-bató&quot; as a religious site. It was mentioned in &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot; that the sacred character of the site disappeared as fears of the spirits living there had disappeared after the cliff was inhabited by bandits.

=====Buwayang Bato=====
The &quot;Buwayang Bato&quot; () was a rock formation that allegedly resembled a large crocodile. In &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot;, the legend tells a story of a rich Chinese man who did not believe in Catholicism that boasted of not being afraid of crocodiles. One day, while trading on the river, the man was attacked by a large crocodile. It was said that after the Chinese man prayed to San Nicholas for mercy, the crocodile turned into stone. The rock formation is believed to have been located at the southeastern shore of Mandaluyong, in the namesake barangay of Buayang Bato. Other rock formations in the country that resemble crocodiles can be found near Boracay, and Santa Ana, Cagayan.

== Geology ==

The Pasig River&#x27;s main watershed is concentrated in the plains between Manila Bay and Laguna de Bay. The watershed of the Marikina River tributary mostly occupies the Marikina Valley, which was formed by the Marikina Fault Line. The Manggahan Floodway is an artificially constructed waterway that aims to reduce the flooding in the Marikina Valley during the rainy season, by bringing excess water to Laguna de Bay.

=== Tidal flows ===
The Pasig River is technically considered a tidal estuary. Toward the end of the summer or dry season (April and May), the water level in Laguna de Bay reaches to a minimum of . During times of high tide, the water level in the lake may drop below that of Manila Bay&#x27;s, resulting in a reverse flow of seawater from the bay into the lake. This results in increased pollution and salinity levels in Laguna de Bay at this time of the year.

=== Flooding ===
The Pasig River is vulnerable to flooding in times of very heavy rainfall, with the Marikina River tributary the main source of the floodwater. The Manggahan Floodway was constructed to divert excess floodwater from the Marikina River into Laguna de Bay, which serves as a temporary reservoir. By design, the Manggahan Floodway is capable of handling per second of water flow, with the actual flow being about per second. To complement the floodway, the Napindan Hydraulic Control System (NHCS) was built in 1983 at the confluence of the Marikina River and the Napindan Channel to regulate the flow of water between the Pasig River and the lake.

=== Archaeology ===
A human cranium and mandible was described by D. Sánchez y Sánchez (1929) from under of Pasig River alluvium. It was discovered during construction of the Church of the Jesuits in 1921 and was partially damaged during excavation, and was noted to be &#x27;primitive&#x27; through a loss of Neanderthal characters and mandibular traits (most notably in the teeth and lack of chin), coining the name &quot;Homo manillensis&quot;. Sánchez y Sánchez classified the species as pre-indigenous using outdated methods based on racial classification. The specimen remains undated (although a Quaternary age has been suggested), and Romeo (1979) somewhat equates the skull with &quot;Homo sapiens&quot; in his description. Sarat Chandra (1930) follows suite of Romeo (1979).

== History ==


The Pasig River served as an important means of transport; it was Manila&#x27;s lifeline and center of economic activity. Some of the most prominent kingdoms in early Philippine history, including the kingdoms of Namayan, Maynila, and Tondo grew up along the banks of the river, drawing their life and source of wealth from it. When the Spanish established Manila as the capital of their colonial properties in the Far East, they built the walled city of Intramuros on the southern bank of the Pasig River near its mouth.

=== Pollution ===

After World War II, massive population growth, infrastructure construction, and the dispersal of economic activities to Manila&#x27;s suburbs left the river neglected. The banks of the river attracted informal settlers and the remaining factories dumped their wastes into the river, making it effectively a huge sewer system. Industrialization had already polluted the river.

In the 1930s, observers noticed the increasing pollution of the river, as fish migration from Laguna de Bay diminished. People ceased using the river&#x27;s water for laundering in the 1960s, and ferry transport declined. By the 1970s, the river started to emanate offensive smells, and in the 1980s, fishing in the river was prohibited. In 1990, the Pasig River was considered biologically dead by the Danish International Development Agency.

It is estimated that about 60-65 percent of the pollution in the Pasig River comes from household waste disposed into the tributaries of the river. Increasing poverty in the rural areas in Philippines has driven migration to Metro Manila in search of better opportunities. This resulted in rapid urban growth, congestion and overcrowding of land and along the riverbanks, making the river and its tributaries a dumping ground for informal settlers living there. 
About 30–35 percent of the river pollution is generated from industries locating close to the river (such as tanneries, textile mills, food processing plants, distilleries, and chemical and metal plants), some of which do not have water treatment facilities which are capable of removing heavy metal pollutants. The rest of the pollutants consist of solid waste dumped into the rivers. Metro Manila has been reported to produce as much as of garbage per day. In a study conducted by the researchers from Polytechnic University of the Philippines, the river is also contaminated with microplastics.

==== Rehabilitation efforts ====
Efforts to revive the river began in December 1989 with the help of Danish authorities. The Pasig River Rehabilitation Program (PRRP) was established, with the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) as the main agency with the coordination of the Danish International Development Assistance (DANIDA).

In 1994, First Lady Amelita M. Ramos founded the Clean &amp; Green Foundation Inc., a non-government and non-profit organization. The organization conducted fundraising projects such as the &quot;Piso para sa Pasig&quot; (Filipino: &quot;A peso for the Pasig&quot;) campaign. The campaign raised around PHP52 million.

In 1999, President Joseph Estrada signed Executive Order No. 54 establishing the Pasig River Rehabilitation Commission (PRRC) to replace the old PRRP with additional expanded powers such as managing of wastes and resettling of squatters. The PRRC was abolished in November 2019, with its functions and powers being transferred to the Manila Bay Task Force, DENR, Department of Housing and Urban Development, Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA), and the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH).

In 2010, the television network ABS-CBN and PRRC headed by ABS-CBN Foundation-Bantay Kalikasan Director Gina Lopez – then chairperson of PRRC – launched a fun run fund-raising activity called &quot;&quot;Run for the Pasig River&quot; held every October from 2009 to 2013. The proceeds from the fun run will serve as a fund for the &quot;Kapit-bisig para sa Ilog Pasig&quot;&quot; (Collaborate for the Pasig River) rehabilitation project of the Pasig River. No further fun run has been announced since the 2013 event.

In October 2018, the PRRC won the first Asia Riverprize, in recognition of its efforts to rehabilitate the Pasig River. According to the PRRC, aquatic life has returned to the river.

On April 20, 2021, San Miguel Corporation announced that it would initiate a clean-up of the Pasig River in May 2021. SMC will also work with the DENR and the DPWH in this river cleanup. The river cleanup is part of San Miguel Corporation&#x27;s Pasig River Expressway project.

===== Pasig River Esplanade =====

On January 17, 2024, the Bongbong Marcos administration inaugurated its Pasig Bigyang Buhay Muli (PBBM; ) project, aiming to revitalize the Pasig River through the development of linear parks, walkways, bikeways, and commercial developments. The program also aims to improve the existing Pasig River Ferry System through the addition of more ferry boats and stations.

====Invasive species====
The Pasig River has been infested with invasive species, notably the water hyacinth and the janitor fish. Water hyacinth, introduced in the Philippines around 1912 as an ornamental plant, has been thrown into the Pasig River; this led the profusely-growing plants to thrive in the river as well as Laguna de Bay due to shifting tides. The plants are currently considered a notorious pest as they clog the waterways. Introduced in the 1990s to clean algae, the janitor fish has become one of the most destructive fishes. Aside from preying on small fish and contributing to the river&#x27;s murkiness, its population has exponentially risen due to lack of natural predators.

===Memorial===
In December 2024, as memorial to Pasig River, the Philippine Postal Corporation launched at Bonifacio Shrine, Gelo Andres and Renacimiento Manila&#x27;s work, the P150 &quot;Simbang Gabi sa Ilog Pasig”. The longest usable stamp measures 234mm x 40mm. The postage stamp design features 9 historical churches from Binondo to Antipolo along the River.

<text>The Pseudomonarchia Daemonum () first appears as an appendix to &quot;De praestigiis daemonum&quot; (1577) by Johann Weyer. An abridgment of a grimoire similar in nature to the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot; (first book of &quot;The Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;), it contains a list of demons, and the appropriate hours and rituals to conjure them.

The &quot;Pseudomonarchia&quot; predates, and differs somewhat from, &quot;Ars Goetia&quot;. The &quot;Pseudomonarchia&quot; lists sixty-nine demons (in contrast to the later seventy-two), and their sequence varies, along with some of their characteristics. The demon Pruflas appears only in &quot;Pseudomonarchia&quot;, and &quot;Pseudomonarchia&quot; does not attribute any sigils to the demons.

Weyer referred to his source manuscript as &quot;Liber officiorum spirituum, seu Liber dictus Empto. Salomonis, de principibus et regibus daemoniorum.&quot; (&quot;Book of the offices of spirits, or the book called &#x27;Empto&#x27;. Solomon, concerning the princes and kings of demons.&quot;) This work is likely related to a very similar 1583 manuscript titled &quot;The Office of Spirits&quot;, both of which appear ultimately be an elaboration on a fifteenth-century manuscript titled &quot;Le Livre des Esperitz&quot; (of which 30 of its 47 spirits are nearly identical to spirits in the &quot;Ars Goetia&quot;).

<text>The Babuyan Islands ( ), also known as the Babuyan Group of Islands, is an archipelago in the Philippines, located in the Luzon Strait north of the main island of Luzon and south of Taiwan. The archipelago consists of five major islands and their surrounding smaller islands. These main islands are, counterclockwise starting from northeast, Babuyan, Calayan, Dalupiri, Fuga, and Camiguin. The Babuyan Islands are separated from Luzon by the Babuyan Channel, and from the province of Batanes to the north by the Balintang Channel.

==Geography==
The archipelago, comprising 24 volcanic-coralline islands, has a total area of about . The largest of
these is Calayan with an area of , while the highest peak in the island group is Mount Pangasun () on Babuyan Claro.

===Islands===
The table below shows the islands of Babuyan and their adjoining islets and rocks, along with land areas and highest elevation:

===Geology===
The eastern islands of the archipelago are part of the Luzon Volcanic Arc. Three volcanoes from two of the islands have erupted in historical times - Camiguin de Babuyanes on Camiguin Island, Babuyan Claro Volcano and Smith Volcano (also known as Mount Babuyan) on Babuyan Island.

Another small volcanic island located just NE of Camiguin Island, Didicas Volcano on Didicas Island, became a permanent island only after emerging and rising to over above sea level in 1952.

==Flora and fauna==
All of the islands within the island group are classified by the Haribon Foundation and BirdLife International as &quot;key biodiversity areas&quot;, or sites with outstanding universal value due to its geographic and biologic importance. All of the islands within the island group have never been part of any large landmass, and thus have unique flora and fauna, most of which are found nowhere else. Research conducted by the Department of Environment and Natural Resources has found at least five faunal regions in the area, one of the highest densities of separate faunal regions in the world.

The islands are also home to the most critically endangered snake species in the Philippines, the Ross&#x27; wolf snake (found only on the small island of Dalupiri), and the most critically endangered bird species in the Philippines, the Calayan rail (found only on the small island of Calayan). The Babuyan archipelago, along with the nearby Batanes islands, have been designated an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because they support significant populations of resident Taiwan green pigeons, Ryukyu scops-owls and short-crested monarchs, Chinese egrets on passage, and wintering yellow buntings.

The island group is also one of the few congregation sites for endangered humpback whales in Southeast Asia. Due to its value to the natural world and Philippine biological diversity, various scientific and conservation groups have been lobbying for its declaration as a national park and its inclusion in the UNESCO World Heritage List. Humpback whales have re-colonized the area and the Babuyan Group of Islands has become the only wintering ground for the species in the Philippines although historical records from the Babuyan Islands have not been confirmed.

==Demographics==

List of islands by population (as of 2020):
# Calayan Island - 9,648 
# Camiguin Island - 5,231 
# Fuga Island - 1,939
# Babuyan Island - 1,910
# Dalupiri Island - 621
# Barit Island - 14 

==Government==

The whole archipelago is administered under the province of Cagayan, with Babuyan, Calayan, Camiguin, and Dalupiri comprising the municipality of Calayan while Fuga is under the jurisdiction of Aparri.

Babuyan and Dalupiri are themselves individual barangays in Calayan municipality, respectively named Babuyan Claro and Dalupiri, while Fuga Island is also an individual barangay, also named Fuga Island, in Aparri.

<doc id="256460" wikidata="Q77233" url="?curid=256460" title="Frederick III, Elector of Saxony">
<text>Frederick III (17 January 1463 – 5 May 1525), also known as Frederick the Wise (German: &quot;Friedrich der Weise&quot;), was Prince-elector of Saxony from 1486 to 1525, who is mostly remembered for the protection given to his subject Martin Luther, the seminal figure of the Protestant Reformation. Frederick was the son of Ernest, Elector of Saxony and his wife Elisabeth, daughter of Albert III, Duke of Bavaria.

He was one of the most powerful early defenders of Martin Luther, as the elector successfully protected him from the Holy Roman Emperor, the Pope and others. He was ostensibly led, not by religious conviction about the possible truthness of Luther&#x27;s propositions, but rather by personal belief in a fair trial for any of his subjects (a privilege guaranteed by the imperial statutory law) and the rule of law.

The prince-elector is considered to have remained a Roman Catholic all his life, yet gradually inclining toward doctrines of the Reformation and supposedly converting on his deathbed.

==Biography==
Born in Torgau, he succeeded his father as elector in 1486; in 1502, he founded the University of Wittenberg, where theologians Martin Luther and Philip Melanchthon would teach a while later.

Frederick was among the German princes who pressed the need of reform upon Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor, and in 1500, he became president of the newly formed council of regency (&quot;Reichsregiment&quot;).His court painter from 1504 on was the Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472–1553).

Frederick was Pope Leo X&#x27;s candidate for Holy Roman Emperor at the 1519 imperial election; thus the Pope had awarded him the Golden Rose of virtue on 3 September 1518 in an effort to persuade him to accept the throne. However, Frederick helped secure the election of Charles V by agreeing to support Charles and to convince his fellow electors to do the same if Charles repaid an outstanding debt to the Saxons dating back to 1497.

Frederick collected many relics in his Castle Church; his inventory of 1518 listed 17,443 items, including a thumb from St. Anne, a twig from Moses&#x27; burning bush, hay of the holy manger, and milk from the Virgin Mary. Money was paid in order to venerate these relics and thus escape years in purgatory, according to the current belief in indulgence at that context. Thus, according to some calculations, a diligent and pious person who rendered appropriate devotion to each of these relics at that time would be able to merit 1,902,202 years worth of penance (an earthly equivalent of time otherwise spent in purgatory, removed by indulgences). Two years later, the collection exceeded 19,000 pieces.

==The elector&#x27;s dream==
About October 30, 1517, Frederic had a dream which made a deep impression upon his mind, and which foreshadowed the work of the Reformation: 
The festival of All-Saints was an important day for Wittenberg. The costly relics of the castle church were then displayed before the people, and a full remission of sin was granted to all who visited the church and made confession. Accordingly on this day the people in great numbers flocked to Wittenberg in pilgrimage. 
On the 31st of October, the day preceding the festival, the monk Martin Luther went boldly to the church, to which a crowd of worshipers was already repairing, and affixed to the door ninety-five propositions against the doctrine of indulgences. He went alone; his closest friends did not know his plan. As he fastened his theses upon the door of the church, he proclaimed himself ready to defend them the next day at the university itself against all opposers.

These propositions attracted universal attention. They were read and re-read and repeated in every direction. Great excitement was created in the university and in the whole city.

By these theses the doctrine of indulgences was fearlessly opposed. Luther argued that the power to grant the pardon of sin, and to remit its penalty, had never been committed to the Pope, or to any other man. The whole scheme was a farce, an artifice to extort money by playing upon the superstitions of the people, a device of Satan to destroy the souls of all who should trust to its lying pretensions. It was also clearly shown that the gospel of Christ was the most valuable treasure of the Church, and that the grace of God, therein revealed, was freely bestowed upon all who should seek it by repentance and faith.

==Protection of Martin Luther==
Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar, was ordained to the priesthood in 1507, and on the following year, in 1508, he began teaching theology at the University of Wittenberg, which was located in the Electorate of Saxony, i.e., inside the territory ruled by Prince-elector Frederick III. Therefore, Luther was a subject of the elector, by living at his domains.
Luther received two bachelor&#x27;s degrees, one in biblical studies on 9 March 1508, and another in the &quot;Sentences&quot; by Peter Lombard in 1509. On 19 October 1512, he was awarded his Doctor of Theology. On 21 October 1512, Luther was received into the senate of the theological faculty of the University of Wittenberg, succeeding von Staupitz as chair of theology. He spent the rest of his career in this position at the University of Wittenberg. In 1515, he was made provincial vicar of Saxony and Thuringia, which required him to visit and oversee eleven monasteries in his province.

From 1510 to 1520, Luther lectured on the Psalms, and on the books of Hebrews, Romans, and Galatians. As he studied these portions of the Bible, he came to view the use of terms such as penance and righteousness by the Catholic Church in new ways. He became convinced that the church was corrupt in its ways and had lost sight of what he saw as several of the central truths of Christianity. The most important for Luther was the doctrine of justification—God&#x27;s act of declaring a sinner righteous—by faith alone through God&#x27;s grace. He began to teach that salvation or redemption is a gift of God&#x27;s grace, attainable only through faith in Jesus as the Messiah. &quot;This one and firm rock, which we call the doctrine of justification&quot;, he writes, &quot;is the chief article of the whole Christian doctrine, which comprehends the understanding of all godliness.&quot;

After a while, Luther came to reject several teachings and practices of the Roman Catholic Church; in particular, he disputed the view on indulgences. Luther attempted to resolve these differences amicably, first proposing an academic discussion of its practice and efficacy.

In 1516, Johann Tetzel, a Dominican friar, was sent to Germany by the Roman Catholic Church to sell indulgences to raise money in order to rebuild St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica in Rome.

Then, on 31 October 1517, Luther wrote to his bishop, Albrecht von Brandenburg, protesting against the sale of indulgences. He enclosed in his letter a copy of his &quot;Disputation on the Power and Efficacy of Indulgences&quot;, which came to be known as the &quot;Ninety-five Theses&quot;.

In 1520, Pope Leo X demanded that Luther renounce all of his writings, and when Luther refused to do so, excommunicated him in January 1521.

Then, to give him the right to a fair trial, Elector Frederick ensured that Martin Luther would be heard before the Diet of Worms in 1521; after Holy Roman Emperor Charles V condemned Luther as an outlaw at the Diet, the elector also secured an exemption from the Edict of Worms for Saxony.

The Elector then protected Luther from the Pope&#x27;s enforcement of the edict by faking a highway attack on Luther&#x27;s way back to Wittenberg, abducting and then hiding him for several years at Wartburg Castle after the Diet of Worms.

Luther&#x27;s disappearance during his return to Wittenberg was planned by , who had him intercepted on his way home in the forest near Wittenberg by masked horsemen impersonating highway robbers. They escorted Luther to the security of the Wartburg Castle at Eisenach, where he remained desguised as &quot;Junker Jörg&quot;.

Frederick protected Luther to safeguard the reputation of Saxony&#x27;s University and to protect Saxony from external interference; since Saxony was a electorate for the imperial throne, neither the Popes nor the Habsburg emperors were willing to affect the imperial election by pursuing the matter against Frederick.

During his stay at Wartburg, which he referred to as &quot;my Patmos&quot;, Luther translated the New Testament from Greek into German and poured out doctrinal and polemical writings. 

In the summer of 1521, Luther widened his target from individual pieties like indulgences and pilgrimages to doctrines at the heart of Church practice.

In &quot;On the Abrogation of the Private Mass&quot;, he condemned as idolatry the idea that the mass is a sacrifice, asserting instead that it is a gift, to be received with thanksgiving by the whole congregation. His essay &quot;On Confession, Whether the Pope has the Power to Require It&quot; rejected compulsory confession and encouraged private confession and absolution, since &quot;every Christian is a confessor.&quot; In November, Luther wrote &quot;The Judgement of Martin Luther on Monastic Vows&quot;. He assured monks and nuns that they could break their vows without sin, because vows were an illegitimate and vain attempt to win salvation.

== Last years and Wittenberg happenings ==
Despite actively protecting Luther from the hostile menaces against him, the elector had little personal contact with the reformer himself, but Frederick&#x27;s treasurer Degenhart Pfaffinger spoke on his behalf to Luther, as Pfaffinger had supported the elector since their pilgrimage to the Holy Land together.

The pronouncements by Luther from Wartburg Castle were made the context of rapid developments at Wittenberg, of which he was kept fully informed while residing at the fortress. Andreas Karlstadt, supported by the ex-Augustinian Gabriel Zwilling, embarked on a radical programme of reform there in June 1521, exceeding anything envisaged by Luther. The reforms provoked disturbances, including a revolt by the Augustinian friars against their prior, the smashing of statues and images in churches, and denunciations of the magistracy.

After secretly visiting Wittenberg in early December 1521, Luther wrote &quot;A Sincere Admonition by Martin Luther to All Christians to Guard Against Insurrection and Rebellion&quot;.

Wittenberg became even more volatile after Christmas when a band of visionary zealots, the so-called Zwickau prophets, arrived, preaching revolutionary doctrines such as the absolute equality of man, adult baptism, and Christ&#x27;s imminent return. When the town council asked Luther to return, he decided it was his duty to act.Luther secretly returned to Wittenberg on 6 March 1522. He wrote to the elector: &quot;During my absence, Satan has entered my sheepfold, and committed ravages which I cannot repair by writing, but only by my personal presence and living word.&quot; For eight days in Lent, beginning on Invocavit Sunday, 9 March, Luther preached eight sermons, which became known as the &quot;Invocavit Sermons&quot;. In these sermons, he hammered home the primacy of core Christian values such as love, patience, charity, and freedom, and reminded the citizens to trust God&#x27;s word rather than violence to bring about necessary change.

The effect of Luther&#x27;s intervention was immediate at the city. After the sixth sermon, the Wittenberg jurist Jerome Schurf wrote to the elector: &quot;Oh, what joy has Dr. Martin&#x27;s return spread among us! His words, through divine mercy, are bringing back every day misguided people into the way of the truth.&quot;Luther next set about reversing or modifying the new church practices. By working alongside the authorities to restore public order, he signaled his reinvention as a conservative force within the Reformation.

Despite his victory in Wittenberg, after banishing the Zwickau prophets, Luther would still have to fight elsewhere against both the established Catholic Church and also the radical reformers who threatened the new order by fomenting social unrest and violence.

==Personal faith and issue of conversion==
Frederick III was a lifelong Roman Catholic, but he might have converted to Lutheranism on his deathbed in 1525 depending on how his receiving of a Protestant communion is viewed.

The elector leaned heavily towards Lutheranism throughout his later years, guaranteeing safety for his subject and Protestant reformer Martin Luther, so that he would not receive the same fate as of Jan Huss and other pre-reformers, after he was tried for heresy and excommunicated by the Pope.

== Death and succession ==
Frederick died unmarried in 1525, aged 62 years old, at Lochau, a hunting castle near Annaburg (30 km southeast of Wittenberg), and was buried in the Castle Church at Wittenberg, with a grave tomb sculpted by Peter Vischer the Younger.

As he was unmarried and had no offspring, he was succeeded as prince-elector of Saxony by his brother John &quot;the Steadfast&quot;, as former duke and heir presumptive of his older brother. John had been Lutheran even before succeeding Frederick as elector, and continued with his policies of supporting the Reformation, having made the Lutheran church the official state church in Saxony in 1527.
