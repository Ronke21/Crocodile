<text>Albion is a village in Orleans County, New York, United States. The population was 5,637 as of the 2020 census, down 419 from the 2010 census. The village is centrally located in the county, and is partly within the towns of both Albion and Gaines. It is the county seat of Orleans County and is about west/northwest of Rochester. Albion is part of the Rochester metropolitan area.

==History==
The Albion area was first settled by European Americans in 1812. This area attracted few residents before the announcement, near the end of the decade, that the Erie Canal would be constructed through here. In 1822, an entrepreneur named Nehemiah Ingersoll bought much of the land near the planned intersection of the canal and Oak Orchard Road, the main north–south route through the area at the time. The property was soon subdivided, and the village, then known as Newport, began to grow.

Orleans County was created two years later. State officials considered both Gaines (then more populous) and Newport as the county seat due to their central locations within the new county. They chose Newport in 1826 due to its location on the canal and the West Branch of Sandy Creek, where a mill had already been established. The next year the village changed its name to Albion to avoid postal confusion with New York&#x27;s other Newport, in Oneida County. In 1828 it was incorporated as a village.

The William V. N. Barlow House, North Main–Bank Streets Historic District, Orleans County Courthouse Historic District, Tousley-Church House, and United States Post Office are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>A slump is a form of mass wasting that occurs when a coherent mass of loosely consolidated materials or a rock layer moves a short distance down a slope. Movement is characterized by sliding along a concave-upward or planar surface. Causes of slumping include earthquake shocks, thorough wetting, freezing and thawing, undercutting, and loading of a slope.

Translational slumps occur when a detached landmass moves along a planar surface. Common planar surfaces of failure include joints or bedding planes, especially where a permeable layer overrides an impermeable surface. Block slumps are a type of translational slump in which one or more related block units move downslope as a relatively coherent mass.

A rotational slump occurs when a slump block, composed of sediment or rock, slides along a concave-upward slip surface with rotation about an axis parallel to the slope. Rotational movement causes the original surface of the block to become less steep, and the top of the slump is rotated backward. This results in internal deformation of the moving mass consisting chiefly of overturned folds called sheath folds.

Slumps have several characteristic features. The cut which forms as the landmass breaks away from the slope is called the scarp and is often cliff-like and concave. In rotational slumps, the main slump block often breaks into a series of secondary slumps and associated scarps to form stair-step pattern of displaced blocks. The upper surface of the blocks are rotated backwards, forming depressions which may accumulate water to create ponds or swampy areas. The surface of the detached mass often remains relatively undisturbed, especially at the top. However, hummocky ridges may form near the toe of the slump. Addition of water and loss of sediment cohesion at the toe may transform slumping material into an earthflow. Transverse cracks at the head scarp drain water, possibly killing vegetation. Transverse ridges, transverse cracks and radial cracks form in displaced material on the foot of the slump.

Slumps frequently form due to removal of a slope base, either from natural or manmade processes. Stream or wave erosion, as well as road construction are common instigators for slumping. It is the removal of the slope&#x27;s physical support which provokes this mass wasting event. Thorough wetting is a common cause, which explains why slumping is often associated with heavy rainfall, storm events and earthflows. Rain provides lubrication for the material to slide, and increases the self-mass of the material. Both factors increase the rate of slumping. Earthquakes also trigger massive slumps, such as the fatal slumps of Turnagain Heights Subdivision in Anchorage, Alaska. This particular slump was initiated by a magnitude 8.4 earthquake that resulted in liquefaction of the soil. Around 75 houses were destroyed by the Turnagain Slump. Power lines, fences, roads, houses, and other manmade structures may be damaged if in the path of a slump.

The speed of slump varies widely, ranging from meters per second, to meters per year. Sudden slumps usually occur after earthquakes or heavy continuing rains, and can stabilize within a few hours. Most slumps develop over comparatively longer periods, taking months or years to reach stability. An example of a slow-moving slump is the Swift Creek Landslide, a deep-seated rotational slump located on Sumas Mountain, Washington.

Slumps may also occur underwater along the margins of continents and islands, resulting from tidal action or a large seismic event. These submarine slumps can generate disastrous tsunamis. The underwater terrain which encompasses the Hawaiian Islands gains its unusual hummocky topography from the many slumps that have taken place for millions of years.

One of the largest known slumps occurred on the south-eastern edge of the Agulhas Bank south of Africa in the Pliocene or more recently. This so-called Agulhas Slump is long, wide, and has a volume of . It is a composite slump with proximal and distal allochthonous sediment masses separated by a large glide plane scar.

<text>Harrison is a town and village in Westchester County, New York, United States. It is a suburb of New York City, located northeast of Manhattan. The population was 28,218 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===17th century===
Harrison was established in 1696 by a patent granted by the British government to John Harrison and three others, who had a year earlier bargained with local Native Americans to purchase an area of land above Westchester Path, an old trail that led from Manhattan to Port Chester and below Rye Lake. Local custom holds that Harrison was given 24 hours to ride his horse around the area he could claim, and the horse could not swim or did not want to get its feet wet, but this is folklore. In fact, the land below Westchester Path and along Long Island Sound had already been purchased and partly developed by the settlers of Rye, New York.

The area that became Harrison had also been sold in 1661 or 1662, and again in 1666, to Peter Disbrow, John Budd, and other investors or early residents of Rye. Disbrow and Budd evidently lost their paperwork and the land was ultimately granted to Harrison and his co-investors in 1696. So upset were the people of Rye that they seceded to the Colony of Connecticut until 1700, when the King of England ordered Rye to rejoin the Colony of New York.

===18th century===
The first permanent residents of Harrison&#x27;s Purchase, as it was called, arrived in about 1725, and many early settlers were Quakers, who set up a Friend&#x27;s Meeting House at a settlement located in the part of Harrison now called Purchase. Harrison&#x27;s Purchase was administered jointly by the settlers of Rye until it was incorporated as a town on March 7, 1788, by an act of the New York State legislature.

Merritt&#x27;s Hill in West Harrison was the site of the Battle of White Plains during the Revolutionary War. Among the 367 regiments in the battle, Regiment 182 of the Continental Army was composed solely of people from Harrison.

===19th century===
During the 1830s, David Haviland settled in Harrison where he produced Haviland China which he sold in his store in New York City before returning to his native France. Today there exists a Haviland Street in the downtown business district, as well as a Haviland Road in the Sterling Ridge neighborhood of Harrison, whose only street sign is of a historic wrought iron design in scrolled shapes, quite older than many others throughout the town.

In 1867, Benjamin Holladay purchased a tract of land, which is now the campus of Manhattanville College. He constructed an elaborate granite mansion, now known as the college&#x27;s Reid Castle, and an elaborate Norman-style Roman Catholic chapel for his wife. The castle hosted the King and Queen of Siam in the early 1930s. The castle was at one time known as Ophir House, in reference to different owners.

In 1875, Sunny Ridge farm mansion was renovated to include a 14th-century woodcut from Europe, installed into the wall over the living room fireplace, among several other ancient relics, built into the home. The home was sold for the first time since the 1920s renovation in the summer of 2017, and was demolished to make way for two new homes. It was not protected by any state or local historic preservation acts.

What is the present-day Metro-North Railroad&#x27;s New Haven Line, running from Manhattan in New York City, to Greenwich, Connecticut, first came through Harrison in 1848, though the first station was not built until 1870. Before that time, Harrisonites had to flag down the train to get a ride. Harrison remained generally free of factories through the Industrial Revolution, while large factory districts grew in the neighboring towns of White Plains, Port Chester and Mamaroneck.

===20th century===
In 1929, the Hutchinson River Parkway was extended to Harrison. The same year, Harrison&#x27;s former Sunnyridge Farm, located less than a half mile from the train station, was purchased by real estate developer Sidney H. Sonn, of H. &amp; S. Sonn Co., based in New York City, and subdivided into lots for a real estate development.

H. &amp; S. Sonn laid out new streets throughout, preserving the farm&#x27;s private access road to the farm residence as today&#x27;s Sunny Ridge Road. According to a 1928 article in &quot;The New York Times, &quot;[H. &amp; S. Sonn] virtually transformed their part of the old farm into a park, installed winding tree-lined motorways and water, gas, sewers, and electricity, and landscaped the entire 165 acres, then they erected ten English-type houses which were designed by Julius Gregory, one of them being completely furnished by Charles of London.&quot; H. &amp; S. Sonn contracted Julius Gregory to develop house plans for single family houses in their new Sunny Ridge development, as it was termed. A new model was developed to construct homes that were of durable materials, to be resistant to exterior maintenance, using only brick, stone, and old-growth oak timber as exterior materials. The fashionable new neighborhood attracted the attention of New York banking, business, and entertainment elites, attracting Wall Street financier William Harty, then owner of Condé Nast, Joseph J. Lane; musical star Louise Groody; and Fitzhugh Green, of Putnam&#x27;s Publishing House, among the first residents of the new neighborhood.

Sidney Sonn renovated the farm&#x27;s original house, an immense, elaborate, 20-room, 1875 Victorian mansion, into an English Tudor, designed by renowned architect Julius Gregory, father of the American Tudor-Revival style and movement of the 1920s, as a residence for himself.

Only a small handful of homes were sold and constructed before the economic downturn of the Great Depression. The remaining vast majority of homes were constructed beginning in the middle-1940s, with the last plots filled during the 1950s. The styles of the newer, 1940s-era homes was primarily of colonial revival style, with the newest ranging into Mid-century-Modern. The older, Tudor homes as a result remain quite notable.

In 1967, 200 residents stated support for a plan to incorporate Purchase, a community in Harrison, so that corporations could not build in the community. In response, officials from the Town of Harrison put forward plans to try to become a city to try to stop Purchase from seceding from Harrison. The resolution was for the Town became a hybrid &quot;Town / Village&quot;, which it remains today.

John A. Passidomo (1921–2005) was first elected mayor in 1965 by only 67 votes. Re-elected eight times, he served until 1983 when he resigned to become Commissioner of the New York State Department of Motor Vehicles. In his two and a half years at that job, he helped pass one of the nation&#x27;s first seat-belt laws despite the law&#x27;s unpopularity.

Harrison&#x27;s &quot;Platinum Mile&quot;, a string of corporate office parks along I-287 in the Purchase section of Harrison, developed under Passidomo. The mayor played an instrumental role in attracting large corporations such as PepsiCo, MasterCard and Texaco.

In the early 1970s, under Passidomo&#x27;s supervision, a group in the Purchase section of town, concerned about the town&#x27;s overdevelopment, attempted to incorporate as a village and thereby separate from the town of Harrison. Creatively, to avoid being served papers that would have begun the legal proceedings for Purchase to incorporate as a village, Passidomo entered his office through the fire escape. He then immediately made sure that the town Harrison became a village but remained as a town to end to the possibility of Purchase&#x27;s secession, since a village cannot legally be formed in another village.

The documented list of supervisors and mayors begins in 1946; though there were mayors before that. The documented list includes:
* Alfred F. Sulla Jr. 1946–1955
* Alfred F. Sulla Jr. 1958–1965
* John Passidomo 1965–1983
* Pat V. Angarano 1983–1990
* Charles Balancia 1990–1994
* Philip A. Marraccini (R) 1994–1998
* Ronald Bianchi (D) 1998–2002
* Stephen Malfitano (R) 2002–2008
* Joan Walsh (D) 2008–2012
* Ronald Belmont (R) 2012–2022
* Richard Dionisio (R) 2022–present

==Geography==
Harrison is a town and village in Westchester County, New York, approximately northeast of Manhattan, New York City. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the town (and coterminous village) has a total area of , of which is land and , or 3.22%, is water. The population was 27,472 at the 2010 census.

The distance from Harrison Station to Grand Central Terminal in Midtown Manhattan is about .

Harrison is bordered by North Castle, White Plains, Rye town, Rye city, Mamaroneck, and Scarsdale. The New England Thruway (I-95) runs through the town (without any interchanges), as well as the Cross Westchester Expressway and the Hutchinson River Parkway. I-684 passes through Harrison and ends at the Cross Westchester Expressway and the Hutchinson Parkway.

=== Climate ===
===Areas and neighborhoods===
The boundaries of the town of Harrison are the approximate shape of a figure-eight. The southern half is known as simply Harrison, or downtown, while the hamlets of Purchase and West Harrison are located in the northern portion of the town. The &quot;downtown&quot; southern half of Harrison is divided into four general areas: Brentwood Plaza, Sunny Ridge, Sterling Ridge/The Trails, and the Village part of Harrison.

West Harrison is an isolated community, lodged between a tall hill bordered by a lake, Interstate 287, a tall relatively steep hill, and a cliff at the northern edge. Because of this, there is a general lack of street entrances. There is really only one road into it, although there are a few other &quot;back&quot; ways into it. The road is called Lake Street, flanked on one side by Silver Lake Park, bordering the lake, and by a small business district on the other side of the street. West Harrison contains the Passidomo Veterans Memorial Park and Pool and the Leo Mintzer Center. West Harrison also contains the site of the Battle of White Plains from the Revolutionary War. West Harrison is also the home of Buckout Road, which was said to have been a home of witches, albinos, and slaughters.

Downtown is split into the four sections mentioned above, and is flanked by Interstate 95, the Hutchinson River Parkway, and the Metro-North Railroad. The manmade lines create isolation to areas, with few areas to cross each. Harrison&#x27;s only middle school, Louis M. Klein Middle School, and only High School, Harrison High School, are located in the &quot;downtown&quot; area. The four areas of downtown, as separated by the boundaries of Interstate 95 and the railroad tracks as well as separated by wealth gaps, are very diverse. The &quot;Downtown&quot; with Halstead Ave as the main thoroughfare, starting on the City of Rye border, is parallel to the Metro North railroad, delivers traffic into the Village of Mamaroneck. This area consists of mixed use century old buildings with new luxury rentals taking over the area. Flanking Halstead Ave are streets consisting of older two- family homes with new duplexes gentrifing the community. The housing stock consists of every wealth level.

According to a 2009 estimate, the median household income was $104,640, and the median family income was $130,224. The per capita income for the village was $63,742. About 4.2% of families and 5.6% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.3% of those under age 18 and 7.8% of those age 65 or over.

==Economy==
Harrison is and has been home to the corporate headquarters of several well-known companies, including the MasterCard headquarters, MasterCard International Global Headquarters, PepsiCo, and Central National-Gottesman. Atlas Air and subsidiary Polar Air Cargo have their headquarters in Purchase. Texaco&#x27;s headquarters, a building, was in Harrison. In 2002, after Chevron and Texaco merged, Chevron sold the former Texaco Headquarters to Morgan Stanley. Morgan Stanley bought the building and the surrounding for $42 million. Previously, Lenovo had its U.S. headquarters in Purchase. In 2006, the company announced it was moving to Morrisville, North Carolina.

<text>Mount Kisco is a village and town in Westchester County, New York, United States. The town of Mount Kisco is coterminous with the village. The population was 10,959 at the 2020 United States census.

It serves as a significant historic site along the Washington-Rochambeau Revolutionary Route.

== History ==
The name &quot;Kisco&quot; may be connected to the Munsee word &quot;asiiskuw&quot; (&quot;mud&quot;), and the name of the settlement &quot;first appeared in colonial records as Cisqua, the name of a meadow and river mentioned in the September 6, 1700 Indian deed to land in the area.&quot; The spelling &quot;Mount Kisko&quot; was used by the local postmaster when a post office was opened in the village sometime after 1850. The current spelling of the name was adopted in 1875, with the settlement&#x27;s incorporation as a village. The town shares its name with the Kisco River, which traverses the town and goes into the Croton Reservoir.

As a village, Mount Kisco originally was half in the town of Bedford and half in the town of New Castle. Mount Kisco became a town in its own right in 1978.

The Mount Kisco Municipal Complex was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1997. Merestead, St. Mark&#x27;s Episcopal Church, St. Mark&#x27;s Cemetery, and the United Methodist Church and Parsonage are also listed.

Mount Kisco is socioeconomically diverse. Though most residents are middle to upper middle class professionals, Mount Kisco is home to a sizable number of working class Hispanic immigrants who primarily reside in the downtown core. In contrast, sprawling estates and equestrian farms are to be found farther away from the center of town. Worth millions of dollars, these properties are occasionally of a historic nature, many dating back to the late 19th and early 20th centuries. These bucolic country roads, meadows, and rolling hills are often technically within neighboring Bedford, though they share Mount Kisco&#x27;s ZIP Code and post office. Residents in this overlapping zone may use either a Bedford Corners or Mount Kisco mailing address.

Housing in Mount Kisco is tremendously varied, consisting of apartment buildings, co-ops, condominiums, townhomes, single-family homes, historic Colonials and Victorians, and multimillion-dollar estates.

<doc id="258033" wikidata="Q1187311" url="?curid=258033" title="McCandless, Pennsylvania">
<text>McCandless is a township with home rule status in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 29,709 at the 2020 census. It is a suburb in the North Hills of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

McCandless is part of the North Allegheny School District and participates in the multi-municipality Northland Public Library. Though McCandless no longer operates under the First Class Township Code, it is classified as a first-class township for certain purposes. The inclusion of the word &quot;Town&quot; in its name sometimes causes confusion, since with one exception, a &quot;town&quot; is not a municipal unit in Pennsylvania.

==History==
Native American artifacts, primarily Iroquois Nation, have been found in areas of the township. Early written history includes a visit by George Washington and his guide, Christopher Gist, in 1753.

The state of Pennsylvania enacted legislation in order to gain Continental Script, a quickly depreciating currency during the Revolutionary War. The legislation ordered for a plan to sell Iroquois land that was known as the Depreciation Lands at the time; this land included the North Hills. Soldiers redeemed their certificates by receiving cash or Iroquois land. Because of this, Iroquois unrest emerged and did not stop until the Iroquois were defeated in 1794.
The first European settler in McCandless Township was James Duff, who had purchased in 1796. Farming increased in the area, and in 1849, meetings were held, presided over by Daniel Vogel, for the purpose of forming a local government. The township was founded in 1851 and called &quot;Taylor Township&quot;. The area was incorporated in 1857 as a second class township and renamed &quot;McCandless Township&quot; in honor of District Judge Wilson McCandless. The published population was 1,482 persons.

During the 1800s McCandless Township was primarily a farming community. During the War of 1812, an important supply route for the transportation of war materials from Pittsburgh to Commodore Perry&#x27;s forces on Lake Erie passed through the area.

In 1908 an interurban commuter railroad, the Harmony Line, allowed area residents to easily commute to Pittsburgh. A concurrent oil boom resulted in rapid early development, centered on the rail stations in the Highland and Ingomar areas.

By 1931, the Harmony Line was closed because of the growing usage of the automobile.

Allegheny County Commissioner E. V. Babcock initiated the establishment of Allegheny County&#x27;s North Park. He purchased the land and later sold it to the county at cost. North Park was founded in 1927 by Allegheny County. Approximately of the park, , are located in McCandless. This area represents approximately 15.2% of the town.

Between 1930 and 1950, the town more than doubled its population (from 2,653 to 6,488). By 1960, the population had redoubled (14,582) and has since doubled again. At the 2000 census, the number of households in the town was 11,159.

Expanding population and traffic brought more diversified development into the area. McKnight Road was built in the mid-1950s and became the primary access into the north suburban areas. Retail and office uses occupy some of the McCandless segment of the McKnight corridor. The Community College of Allegheny County opened a campus in the area in 1972. A new mixed-use development acting as a town center, McCandless Crossing, was completed in 2016 and serves as a strip mall as well as an apartment complex and a townhome neighborhood.

<text>Ross Township is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is adjacent to the northern border of Pittsburgh. The population of the township was 33,176 at the 2020 census. While most of the township is residential, a retail corridor is located along McKnight Road along with business districts on U.S. Route 19 and Babcock Boulevard.

Ross Township, along with the nearby borough of West View, comprises part of the North Hills School District, and both participate in the multi-municipality Northland Public Library.

==History==
On June 26, 1809, John McKnight, along with 30 other residents of Pine Township, petitioned the courts of Allegheny for the formation of a new township. In the November term, permission was granted and Ross Township was born. It was called Ross after a prominent Pittsburgh attorney James Ross. He represented Western Pennsylvania at the convention to ratify the Pennsylvania Constitution in 1790. Ross was a United States Senator and the personal land lawyer to George Washington.

Many of the early settlers lived in fear of the Native Americans, since many Indians did not agree with Chief Cornplanter&#x27;s treaty with Washington in 1784. In 1794, Casper Reel decided to finally settle in the area after being formally chased out by a group of Indians. His twin sons, David and Casper Jr., became the first white men born north of Pittsburgh.

One of Ross Township&#x27;s earliest claims to fame was the roads that passed through the area. The Native Americans traveled the Venango Path, later called the Franklin Road, and was one of the most important routes used by Commodore Oliver Perry in the Battle of Lake Erie during the War of 1812. After his victory, the road was once again changed to the Perrysville Plank Road. During this time, the road had large wooden planks on one side to assist in traveling during inclement weather. It was only when State Senator Herman P. Brandt petitioned to have the road paved from the city line to Perrysville in the 1920s. The road changed names once again to what is now known as Perry Highway.

Along the road was built the Hiland Presbyterian Church &quot;circa&quot; 1799. The church, which still stands today, served as the hub of the community with most of the early families worshiping there and as its use as the town meeting hall. Adjoined to church property was the Perrysville School. This was the setting of one of both Pittsburgh&#x27;s and Ross Township&#x27;s most infamous prison escapes. On January 30, 1902, Katherine Soffel, wife of the warden of the Allegheny Jail, helped the Biddle Brothers, whom she was in love with, escape. It was during this escape through a blinding snow storm that they found themselves on Perrysville Plank Road looking for shelter, transportation and something to eat. Having nowhere else to stay, they broke into the one room Perrysville school house and warmed up next to the pot-bellied stove still warm from the day&#x27;s classes. Wanting something to eat, the Biddles traveled up the road to the White House Hotel, where they requested six ham sandwiches and a pint of whiskey. Realizing they were short on cash, Ed Biddle pulled out a woman&#x27;s pocketbook and paid for them. He did not have enough room in his coat, so he drew his gun in full sight of the bartender, Christ Weller. After many failed attempts to steal horses and a buggy, they found an open barn along Three Degree Road, where their attempt proved successful. Word of their escape broke out in the morning of January 31, in which they were tracked and later caught in Butler County. Along with these infamous strangers, some of the residence of Ross had fame in the lives as well. Herman P. Brandt was a State Senator, Casper Reel &amp; Jacob Weitzel were famed Revolutionary War Soldiers, Simon Girty was a renegade traitor to the settlers and has been written about many times all over the world.

In 1908, the Perrysville Volunteer Fire Company was formed.

On August 1, 1962, Northway Mall in Ross Township opened with 62 stores. The unique mall was the site of the first enclosed mall in the state of Pennsylvania. Today, it operates as The Block Northway.

In the summer of 1967, Jim Delligatti invented the Big Mac sandwich in the kitchen of his McDonald&#x27;s, located on McKnight Road.

In 1984, the Pittsburgh Chinese Church purchased the original Perrysville church building at 4101 Perrysville Ave with a main grand entrance at 4050 Vinceton St. In 2001, the PCC left this location for its current building at 8711 Old Perry Highway.

Ross&#x27; borders changed over the course of time when Allegheny City was formed to the south and Shaler Township was formed to the east. Both took place before the turn of the 20th century. In 1905, the borough of West View seceded from Ross and was formed in the southwest corner of Ross Township. Since then, the borders have remained relatively unchanged.

<text>Shaler Township is a township in Allegheny County in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania. It consists of much of the community of Glenshaw and several neighboring communities. The population was 28,757 at the 2010 census. It is part of the Pittsburgh metropolitan area.

==History==
Traders began settling in the Shaler area in the mid-18th century. The most prominent early trader in the area was George Croghan, who came in the early 1740s. By 1754, settlement included the Pine Creek trading post, where Europeans traded fur and skins with the Mingo and other Native Americans in the Ohio Valley. The second early European settlement was Girty&#x27;s Run, established by Simon Girty.

The village of Glenshaw, Pennsylvania—at the center of what became Shaler Township—was established in the early 19th century, beginning with a log sawmill built by John Shaw, Sr. after he bought of land north of Pittsburgh in 1800. The area became known as &quot;Shaw&#x27;s Glen&quot;, and later Glenshaw. Members of the Shaw family subsequently built a log gristmill, a sickle factory, and a coal mine.

On March 20, 1845, a petition to form a new township from portions of Ross and Indiana townships was presented to the Court of Quarter Sessions. Col. James A. Gibson, Alexander V. Brackenridge and John Murray were appointed as viewers. They reported in favor on June 10 of the same year, although it was two years later on March 20, 1847, that the court decree establishing the township was issued, in the name of Marion. While the township was initially confirmed with the name Marion; on the same day the name was changed to Shaler, after Charles Shaler, a prominent mid-19th century Pittsburgh area judge, who served as President Judge of the 5th District Court in Beaver County. The township is not named for the numerous deposits of shale rock found within its borders; this is instead a common .

At the time of establishment, Shaler Township encompassed all of its current holdings plus the boroughs of Etna, Millvale, and a large tract of Ross Township. By 1868, Shaler lost much of its land to the new boroughs. In 1900, Shaler became one of the early townships to be classified as a township of the first class. The township&#x27;s boundaries remain basically the same today as they were in 1900.

Early settlement of the Shaler area was sporadic, with small farming and mercantile villages appearing. These mainly developed in the valleys next to Pine Creek and Girtys Run. At the time of its incorporation, Shaler Township had a population of 2,000; by 1860 it had grown to 16,399. In the late 19th century, the creation of the Glenshaw Glass plant sped up settlement to a certain degree, drawing workers to settle in the vicinity.

From 1907 until 1931 the interurban Pittsburgh and Butler Street Railway passed through the township, linking it with Pittsburgh and Butler.

Following the Second World War Shaler became an affluent suburb with many former City of Pittsburgh residents now populating the Township. Shaler, along with Ross Township, was among the first outer-city areas to develop into the modern suburbs which today define the North Hills region of Allegheny County. Home building and development during this time period was extensive. Shaler remained and still remains a primarily residential municipality, and it was during this period which the Township came to acquire the attributes it still holds today.

<text>South Park Township is a township in the southern part of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States, near Pittsburgh. The population was 13,416 at the 2010 census.

A large portion of the township consists of a county park of the same name.

== History ==
Composed of portions of St. Clair and Jefferson townships in 1845, South Park was originally called Snowden Township, named after John M. Snowden, a prominent businessman, politician and former Pittsburgh mayor, who had died earlier that year. In the 1930s, Allegheny County acquired several large parcels of farm land mostly within Snowden Township and created a regional recreational area named South Park. The huge success of South Park, and the fact the facility occupies roughly one-third of the community&#x27;s total area, eventually prompted a 1966 referendum in which the township was renamed.

The area in and around South Park Township was settled in the mid-18th century. It is the location of the Oliver Miller Homestead where in 1794, the first shots of the Whiskey Rebellion were fired. A log house was originally built on the site in 1772; it was replaced by a stone structure around 1830, which is open for public tours.

== Geography ==

South Park, a recreational area operated by Allegheny County, is located mostly within the boundaries of South Park Township, although a portion is located in adjacent Bethel Park.

The township is on the Allegheny Plateau, near where the Allegheny River from the northeast and Monongahela River from the southeast join to form the Ohio River in Pittsburgh.

<text>A seismogram is a graph output by a seismograph. It is a record of the ground motion at a measuring station as a function of time. Seismograms typically record motions in three cartesian axes (x, y, and z), with the z axis perpendicular to the Earth&#x27;s surface and the x- and y- axes parallel to the surface. The energy measured in a seismogram may result from an earthquake or from some other source, such as an explosion. Seismograms can record many things, and record many little waves, called microseisms. These tiny events can be caused by heavy traffic near the seismograph, waves hitting a beach, the wind, and any number of other ordinary things that cause some shaking of the seismograph.
Historically, seismograms were recorded on paper attached to rotating drums, a kind of chart recorder. Some used pens on ordinary paper, while others used light beams to expose photosensitive paper. Today, practically all seismograms are recorded digitally to make analysis by computer easier. Some drum seismometers are still found, especially when used for public display. Seismograms are essential for finding the location and magnitude of earthquakes.

==Recording==

Prior to the availability of digital processing of seismic data in the late 1970s, the records were done in a few different forms on different types of media.

A Helicorder drum is a device used to record data into photographic paper or in the form of paper and ink. A piece of paper is wrapped around a rotating drum of the helicorder which receives the seismic signal from a seismometer. For each predefined interval of data, the helicorder will plot the seismic data in one line before moving to the next line at the next interval. The paper must be changed after the helicorder writes on the last line of the paper. In the model that use ink, regular maintenance of the pen must be done for accurate recording.

A Develocorder is a machine that records multi-channel seismic data into a 16 mm film. The machine was developed by Teledyne Geotech during the mid-1960s. It can automatically plot seismograms from 18 seismic signal sources and 3 time signals on a continuous reel of film. The signals from seismometers are processed by 15.5 Hz recording galvanometers which record the seismograms to a reel of of film at the speeds between per minute. The machine has self-contained circulating chemicals that are used to automatically develop the film. However, the machine takes at least ten minutes from the time of recording to the time that the film can be viewed.

After the digital processing had been used, the archives of the seismograms were recorded on magnetic tapes. The data from the magnetic tapes can then be read back to reconstruct the original waveforms. Due to the deterioration of older magnetic tape medias, large number of waveforms from the archives in the early digital recording days are not recoverable. Today, many other forms are used to digitally record the seismograms into digital medias.

== Reading ==
Seismograms are read from left to right.

Time marks show when the earthquake occurred. Time is shown by half-hour (thirty-minute) units. Each rotation of the seismograph drum is thirty minutes. Therefore, on seismograms, each line measures thirty minutes. This is a more efficient way to read a seismogram. Secondly, there are the minute-marks. A minute mark looks like a hyphen &quot;-&quot; between each minute. Minute marks count minutes on seismograms. From left to right, each mark stands for a minute.

Each seismic wave looks different. The P wave is the first wave that is bigger than the other waves (the microseisms). Because P waves are the fastest seismic waves, they will usually be the first ones that the seismograph records. The next set of seismic waves on the seismogram will be the S waves. These are usually bigger than the P waves, and have higher frequency. Look for a dramatic change in frequency for a different type of wave.

<doc id="258043" wikidata="Q1182124" url="?curid=258043" title="Wilkins Township, Pennsylvania">
<text>Wilkins Township is a township in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 6,357 at the 2010 census. It is served by Pennsylvania&#x27;s 12th congressional district, the 43rd District of the Pennsylvania State Senate, and the 34th District of the Pennsylvania State House of Representatives.

Wilkins Township was named for William Wilkins (1779–1865), a politician from Pennsylvania who served in both houses of Congress and as U.S. Secretary of War.

==History==
The township was created from the eastern part of Pitt Township on November 10, 1821. Its territory originally stretched between the Allegheny and Monongahela rivers; from it sprang most of the municipalities between Pittsburgh on the west and Plum and Monroeville on the east.

==Geography==
Wilkins Township is located at (40.422668, -79.823491). According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of 2.6 square miles (6.8 km2), all land.

===Watershed===
The southeastern border of the township is denoted by Thompson Run, a tributary of Turtle Creek. The township is drained by Thompson Run and its tributaries Sawmill Run and Chalfant Run, which in turn has a tributary, Lougeay Run, which flows into the township from Penn Hills. The entire township lies within the Turtle Creek Watershed.

===Transportation===
Interstate 376 passes through the northern limb of the township, where it has an exit just as it enters eastbound from Churchill Borough, number 81 onto PA 791/Rodi Road/Yellow Belt northbound into Penn Hills. The business spur of U.S. Route 22 enters eastbound from Churchill, and is where the main commercial section of Wilkins township is located, including the &quot;Penn Center East&quot; shopping center. US Business 22 crosses Thompson Run from Wilkins Township to Monroeville over the Hall Station Bridge. PA 130 serves the southern portion of the township. The Union Railroad, following the Thompson Run valley, passes through the eastern fringe of the township.

==Surrounding neighborhoods==
Wilkins Township has eight borders, including Penn Hills to the north, Monroeville to the east, Turtle Creek to the southeast, East Pittsburgh to the south, North Braddock to the south-southwest, Chalfant to the southwest, Forest Hills to the west and Churchill to the northwest and north-northwest.

There were 3,235 households, out of which 19.3% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 50.9% were married couples living together, 9.0% had a female householder with no husband present, and 37.8% were non-families. 33.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 16.6% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.14 and the average family size was 2.73.

In the township the population was spread out, with 16.9% under the age of 18, 5.4% from 18 to 24, 25.8% from 25 to 44, 26.1% from 45 to 64, and 25.8% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 46 years. For every 100 females there were 89.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.6 males.

The median income for a household in the township was $37,439, and the median income for a family was $47,882. Males had a median income of $37,127 versus $31,101 for females. The per capita income for the township was $24,515. About 3.8% of families and 6.4% of the population were below the poverty line, including 7.8% of those under age 18 and 4.3% of those age 65 or over.

<text>Darby Township is a township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. The population was 9,264 as of the 2010 census. It is home to both residential areas and expansive industrial districts. Darby Township is home to a diverse population and its industrial districts are popular among shipping companies for their proximity to Philadelphia International Airport. It also is known for being made up of two non-contiguous geographical areas, requiring one to pass through at least two neighboring municipalities to make it from one end of Darby Township to the other. Darby Township is a distinct municipality from the nearby and similarly named Darby Borough and Upper Darby Township.

==History==

===Early settlement===
The area, now known as Darby Township, was settled almost immediately after the coming of William Penn (1682), and in 1683 was recognized as one of the localities where a permanent lodgement had been made but despite that fact, it is believed that the population was sparse for more than a quarter of a century. In 1682, Darby Friends&#x27; Meeting had been established. In the same year the first official record of Darby occurs in the list of collectors &quot;to gather the assessment for the building of the court-house&quot;. Thomas Worth and Joshua Fearne were appointed to those offices for Darby, and Mons Stacker and William Cobb &quot;for Amosland &amp; Calcoone Hook&quot;. The latter was recognized as a distinct municipal district until 1686, when Calcoone Hook was made a part of Darby Township, and Amosland was annexed to Ridley. Calcon or Calkoen&#x27;s Hook comprised all the territory between Cobb&#x27;s Creek on the east, and the Mokormpates Kill or Muckinipattas Creek on the west, and derives its name from the Swedish word &quot;Kalkon&quot; (a turkey) and &quot;Walda Kalkoen&quot; (wild turkeys). Later the territory known by that name became restricted to that part lying south of the Philadelphia, Wilmington, and Baltimore Railroad, while its eastern boundary was Morhorhootink, as shown in the atlas of the early grants in Delaware County.

===Division of Upper and Lower Darby===
The territory now constituting the townships of Upper and Lower Darby continued under one municipal government until 1747, when, for the convenience of the inhabitants, at a town-meeting, it was decided to separate the upper part from the lower in all matters save
the levies made for the support of the poor. The lines thus agreed upon are not the township lines now existing, but Upper Darby, being less densely peopled, extended farther south. The inconveniences arising from the unofficial division so frequently presented themselves as a disturbing element in local government that forty years thereafter a petition was presented to the court. The following is an excerpt from this petition:

<text>Nether Providence Township is a first class township in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States. Many residents refer to the township by the name of its largest community, Wallingford, because the Wallingford postal code is used for most of the township. The population of the township was 13,706 at the 2010 census.

==Geography==
Nether Providence Township is located in central Delaware County at (39.894612, -75.373705). It is bordered to the north by the borough of Media, the county seat. Other neighboring municipalities are Upper Providence Township to the north; Springfield Township, the borough of Swarthmore, and Ridley Township to the east; the city of Chester to the south; and the boroughs of Brookhaven and Rose Valley to the west.

According to the United States Census Bureau, the township has a total area of , of which , or 0.17%, is water. Crum Creek forms the eastern boundary of the township, and Ridley Creek forms the western and southern border. Nether Providence&#x27;s commercial area or downtown is located on Providence Road between the bridge over SEPTA&#x27;s Media/Wawa line and Wallingford Avenue.

==History==
The first recorded inhabitants of Nether Providence Township were Native Americans of the Lenape tribe, who lived in the area for about five hundred years, but by 1740 few remained. On August 14, 1682, two months before William Penn&#x27;s landing in Chester, John Sharpless came to the area. Penn had given Sharpless a thousand-acre (4-km) tract, and he settled near Ridley Creek.

By the time Penn arrived, there were several small settlements in the area, which became known as Providence Township. Providence Township comprised today&#x27;s Nether Providence, Rose Valley, Media, and Upper Providence. On October 17, 1683, the residents of Providence Township petitioned the Court of Chester County, of which they were then a part, to establish a road from Providence to Chester. The court approved the creation of Providence Great Road (now Route 252).

Nether Providence went through four distinct phases from farming, to manufacturing, to resort, and finally, to residential community. By 1729, the area was producing sufficient crops to allow exporting to New England, Canada, and Europe.

Fourteen major mill complexes were built in Nether Providence, six on Crum Creek and eight on Ridley Creek. The first, a cotton mill along Crum Creek, was started by Thomas Allen in 1763. He named his mill for his hometown, Wallingford, England. The mills played an essential part in the growth of Nether Providence. Millhands lived in the self-contained villages that grew up around the mills.

After the Civil War, wealthy Philadelphians built summer residences and vacation resorts in the area.

The first railway was the Leiper Railroad, a horse-drawn quarry rail line, constructed in 1809–1810 and used to haul cut stone until about 1828. That early rail line was superseded by the Leiper Canal. The first steam-locomotive train came through in 1854; it used a single track with a sidetrack at Wallingford. The first post office in Nether Providence was established at Hinkson&#x27;s Corner in 1873. Trolleys also contributed to the area&#x27;s development. The first independent trolley was the Chester and Media Electric Railway, chartered in 1892. The last trolley through the township closed in 1938. The Nether Providence Police Department was established in 1935, and automobile parking was regulated in 1947 and speed in 1949.

Three sites within the township, Wolley Stille, the Thomas Leiper Estate, and Westlawn are listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

<text>Radnor Township, often called simply Radnor, is a first class township with home rule status in Delaware County, Pennsylvania, United States.

Radnor Township is part of the famed Main Line of Philadelphia. As of the 2019 United States census, the township&#x27;s population was 31875. Radnor Township is the largest municipality in Delaware County by land area and the fourth-largest by population, following Upper Darby Township, Haverford Township, and Chester.

Radnor Township is one of the oldest municipalities in Pennsylvania. Radnor Township was founded as a part of the Welsh tract. The original settlers were Welsh-speaking Quakers, led by John Roberts, in an attempt to establish a barony of Wales in Pennsylvania. In about 1681, a group of Welsh Quakers met with William Penn to secure a grant of land in which they could conduct their affairs in their own language. The parties agreed on a tract covering , to be constituted as a separate county whose people and government could conduct their affairs in Welsh. William Penn, an English Quaker, laid out the township in an elongated rectangle located parallel to the Schuylkill River, and the borders of the township have remained unchanged since its founding in 1682.

In 1717, the Welsh Friends built a meeting house on a trail made by the Susquehannock in Radnor Township. Radnor Township grew around the meeting house and remained the center of population of the township for 200 years. The new township was named Radnor after the county in Wales called Radnorshire. The influence of the Welsh, some of whom were forced by heavy taxation to sell their land, waned in the latter half of the 18th century. A hint of Radnor&#x27;s beginnings remain in the names of streets and places evident throughout the community, such as the St. Davids neighborhood, named for Saint David, the patron saint of Wales.

There are a number colleges and universities located in Radnor Township, of which the two largest are Villanova University and Cabrini University. The Valley Forge Military Academy and College is located in the neighborhood of Wayne and Eastern University is located in the neighborhood of St. Davids.

==History==
===Colonial era===
In 1681, Richard Davies purchased 5,000 acres from William Penn. These lands were sold to various purchasers and were mainly in the location of current Radnor Township. The township was part of the Welsh Tract and was named for Radnorshire in Wales. In 1717, the Welsh Friends erected a Quaker meetinghouse (Radnor Friends Meetinghouse) near what is now the intersection of Conestoga Road and Sproul Road at the geographic center of the township. The new town, &quot;Radnorville&quot;, later known as the community of &quot;Ithan&quot; after nearby Ithan Creek, grew around the meetinghouse. The Welsh influence waned in the late 18th century as many left the area due to high taxation. Stone monuments were erected in various locations throughout the township in the late 20th century to commemorate the township&#x27;s Welsh heritage.

===18th century===
In 1794, the Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike was built through Radnor Township, making it the first toll road in the United States, and connecting the cities of Philadelphia and Lancaster, Pennsylvania. The turnpike was populated by businesses over time and forms the modern Lancaster Avenue. Lancaster Avenue is the largest and busiest roadway in Radnor Township that is not an interstate, and along it lies many notable places, including Villanova University and Downtown Wayne.

The Columbia Railroad, later part of the Pennsylvania Railroad also passed through the township in 1832. As a result, Radnor Township is today recognized among the collection of Philadelphia suburbs known as the Main Line. The Main Line railroad facilities are still used by SEPTA (the Philadelphia area&#x27;s transit authority) for its Paoli/Thorndale Line and Amtrak.

===19th and 20th centuries===
In the 1880s, George W. Childs bought property in the community of Louella in the western part of Radnor Township, renamed the area Wayne, Pennsylvania (after American Revolutionary War hero Anthony Wayne) and organized one of the United States&#x27;s first suburban developments.

A separate railroad passing through Radnor Township, the Philadelphia and Western Railroad, was opened in the early 20th century. Today, parts of that railroad are still used as SEPTA&#x27;s Norristown High Speed Line, while others have been repurposed into walking trails.

The 105 bus formerly drove a route similar to that of the 106, but a 2016 schedule change moved the route&#x27;s western terminus to Rosemont Station, on Montrose Avenue near the border of Radnor Township and Lower Merion Township. Since 2017, the route runs parallel to Radnor Township&#x27;s border on Airedale Road, but never enters the township.

<text>Wilkes-Barre Township is a township with home rule status in Luzerne County, Pennsylvania, United States. It is adjacent to the city of Wilkes-Barre. The population of the township was 3,219 at the 2020 census.

==History==
===Founding===
In 1753, the Susquehanna Company was formed in Connecticut for settling the Wyoming Valley in present-day Pennsylvania. Connecticut succeeded in purchasing the land from the Native Americans; however, Pennsylvania already claimed the valley through a purchase they made in 1736. In 1762, roughly two hundred Connecticut settlers (Yankees) established a settlement near Mill Creek. They planted wheat and constructed log cabins. They returned to New England for the winter.

====Massacre of 1763====
The Connecticut settlers returned in the spring of 1763 with their families. A party of Iroquois also visited the area with the dual purpose of inciting the Lenape and killing Teedyuscung, a local Delaware chief. On April 19, 1763, the residence of the chief and twenty others around it were set ablaze. Teedyuscung, under the influence of liquor, perished in the inferno. This was revenge for the death of an Iroquois warrior in 1758. The Iroquois allowed for the Delaware to believe that this atrocity was committed by the settlers. As a result, the Delaware attacked the colonists on October 15, 1763. Thirty settlers were killed, and several others were taken prisoner. Those who managed to escape fled back to New England. The Delaware then burned what was left of the Yankee settlement.

====Pennamite–Yankee Wars====

In 1769, during the colonial era, the Connecticut settlers (Yankees) returned to Wyoming Valley. Five townships were established by Connecticut Colony. Each one was five square miles and divided amongst forty settlers. Wilkes-Barre Township, named in honor of John Wilkes and Isaac Barré, was one of the original townships. Pennsylvanians (Pennamites) also arrived in the valley that same year.

The Connecticut settlers established Fort Durkee, which was named in honor of their leader (Colonel Durkee). This was immediately followed by a series of skirmishes between the Pennsylvanians and Connecticut settlers. The land changed hands several times between the two groups. Finally, after many years of fighting, the land was granted to Pennsylvania.

====Coal mining====
James Sutton built the first gristmill in the township in 1782. In 1806, a large portion of the territory broke away from the township to form the borough of Wilkes-Barre. Today, the township of Wilkes-Barre occupies a strip of land adjacent to the southeast border of what is now the city of Wilkes-Barre.

Coal mining was a prominent industry in and around Wilkes-Barre Township in the late 19th and early 20th century. The Laurel Run mine fire started near the village of Georgetown in 1915. The fire under Georgetown was controlled by blocking off the tunnels in the vicinity, robbing it of the necessary oxygen to continue burning.

===Expanding commerce===
The township become a commercial destination in northeastern Pennsylvania, adding the Mohegan Sun Arena at Casey Plaza and several major shopping hubs, including the Arena Hub Plaza, Wilkes-Barre Township Commons, Wilkes-Barre Township Marketplace, and Wyoming Valley Mall. Most of these shopping areas were developed in the early 2000s, although the Wyoming Valley Mall was constructed in the 1970s following the aftermath of Hurricane Agnes.

===Tornadoes===
The township underwent several devastating tornadoes in the early 20th century (in 1914 and 1917). On Wednesday, June 13, 2018 (at about 10 pm), an EF2 tornado struck the business district of Wilkes-Barre Township. Dozens of commercial buildings were severely damaged. The National Weather Service stated &quot;the tornado touched down near the La-Z-Boy furniture store at Mundy Street and Highland Park Boulevard and continued for three-quarters of a mile ending near I-81 behind Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods in the Arena Hub Plaza. It&#x27;s estimated that the tornado was on the ground for about five minutes.&quot; Six people sustained minor injuries.

<text>Barrington is a suburban, residential town in Bristol County, Rhode Island, United States, approximately southeast of Providence. As of the 2020 United States Census, the population was 17,153.

Barrington was founded by Congregationalist separatists from Swansea, Massachusetts, and incorporated in 1717. It was ceded from Massachusetts to Rhode Island and merged into Warren in 1747, and in 1770 made into a separate town by the Rhode Island legislature. It was a sparsely developed, agricultural community until the arrival of brickmaking companies in the 1850s, which employed large numbers of French-Canadians and Italians. The construction of a railroad to Providence in 1855 further contributed to suburban development, attracting residents of neighboring urban areas and contributing to the development of manufacturing industries. The post–World War II baby boom increased suburbanization trends, resulting in a large population increase.

Historical sites provide examples of architectural and suburban development during various stages of the town&#x27;s history, including the Allen-West House, Barrington Civic Center Historic District, and O&#x27;Bannon Mill. Nine sites in Barrington are listed under the National Register of Historic Places.

== History ==
Barrington was originally occupied by the Wampanoag Indians, whose territory spread from Narragansett Bay to Cape Cod. But epidemics largely eliminated their coastal settlements, and their main settlement was roughly Bristol, Barrington, and Warren, Rhode Island at the time of the Pilgrims&#x27; arrival in 1620. The Narragansetts called the area Sowams. In 1653, investors from Plymouth Colony bought &quot;Sowams and Parts Adjacent&quot; from the Wampanoags, corresponding to Barrington and parts of Bristol, Warren, and Swansea, Massachusetts. Some areas in Barrington draw their name from the initial proprietors of this land, such as Prince&#x27;s Hill, named for Thomas Prince.

Religious differences between settlers of Sowams and the neighboring Wannamoissett and Rehoboth prompted the incorporation of Swansea in 1667. Plymouth created Bristol County in 1685 to improve administration of western lands, which was followed by a merger of the Plymouth and Massachusetts Bay colonies orchestrated by the British government. Baptist residents petitioned for separation from Swansea in 1711, and Barrington was incorporated as an independent town in 1717. Barrington likely received its name from Barrington, Somerset, the origin of several settlers. Barrington was ceded to Rhode Island in 1747 and made a part of Warren. In 1770, the Rhode Island legislature made Barrington a separate town.

===Townhood===

Agriculture provided the basis for Barrington&#x27;s economy in the early decades. Farmers typically cultivated grains, especially corn, rye, oats, and barley. Many farmers planted fruit trees and some developed large orchards, as apple cider was an important commodity for trade. Farming significantly affected the landscape, separating large grassland fields with fencing and stone walls.

Religion continued to influence Barrington politics. The new Congregational Society was formally declared the town&#x27;s religion, following Massachusetts custom. Taxes supported the Congregational minister until 1797, and he was employed by the town meeting. Baptists and other religious groups were given the option to support their own meetings in 1728. In 1737, discussions about relocating the Congregational church proved divisive between the southern and northern portions of Barrington. The southern area was the historical center of town where the Congregational church and original Sowams settlers had been. But rapid population increases shifted influence northward, where abundant marshland and fertile soil allowed farmers to establish large, successful farms. Ultimately, the church relocated to the north, using a lot provided by Joshua Bicknell along County Road. The north continued to develop due to a combination of commercial establishments (mainly taverns and inns) and farmhouses near the relocated church.

===Industrial production and suburbanization===

In 1847, Nathaniel Potter founded Nayatt Brick Company, which used Brickyard Pond&#x27;s extensive clay deposits. The company was reincorporated as the Narragansett Brick Company in 1864, and the New England Steam Brick Corporation was founded in 1890 as a competitor. Brick production resulted in road-building, visits from seafaring vessels, and other such economic activity. These companies&#x27; original employees were mainly of French-Canadian descent, but Italians immigrated to the U.S. as a result of economic depression in the 1880s. A few hundred came to Barrington and worked at the brickyard, and their descendants make up a significant portion of the town population. Barrington&#x27;s population grew from 850 in 1850 to 3,697 in 1920, mirroring overall trends in Rhode Island. Clay deposits began to deplete in 1900, and brickmaking operations ceased by 1930.

The construction of a railroad between Bristol and Providence in 1855 allowed residents to commute to Providence, resulting in an increasingly suburban milieu. The railroad led to the creation of several manufacturing industries in West Barrington, such as O&#x27;Bannon Mill and Rhode Island Laceworks (which provided commercial firefighting services for the town). New public facilities were also constructed during this period, such as a high school, town hall, and library. Developments catered to wealthy residents of urban areas who came to Barrington in the summer for its location near the shore, such as the Barrington Yacht Club and Rhode Island Country Club.

===Modern era===
Manufacturing establishments continued to operate in West Barrington throughout the 20th century. Throughout the 1930s, the Neweth Rubber Company produced retread tires, but its building burned down in the 1940s and was not rebuilt. Rhode Island Laceworks continued to operate until 1990, when its owners deemed profits insufficient. The 1938 New England hurricane caused considerable damage to homes along the shoreline and pleasure craft, and railroad service was discontinued shortly afterward.

Trends continued towards suburbanization, spurred by the availability of the automobile and the later post–World War II baby boom. Commercial establishments on County Road further reduced the need for outside travel and significantly altered the existing town landscape. Barrington Shopping Center was constructed in 1948 and included a supermarket, pharmacy, and bank; two smaller shopping centers were constructed afterward. Six schools comprise Barrington&#x27;s modern education system, constructed throughout the 1950s. Town services grew with the establishment of a police force in 1934 and a fire department in 1953. Rapid population growth led the town to adopt a council-manager charter in 1960. New churches also opened, accommodating Roman Catholic, Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian citizens. In the 1980s, the East Bay Bike Path was constructed along the former railroad lines connecting Providence to Bristol. In the 1990s, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sued the town for its Christmas display, which featured a crèche. The town removed the display, and someone placed a privately owned scene on the road neighboring the town hall. Similarly, a lawsuit filed in 1996 by the ACLU regarding the town&#x27;s decision to plow church parking lots for free was not contested. Barrington was the sole &quot;dry&quot; town in Rhode Island until 2011, when the town council approved two liquor stores.

== Education ==

===Public schools===

Barrington Public Schools consists of four elementary schools (Sowams School, Primrose Hill School, Nayatt School, and Hampden Meadows School), Barrington Middle School, and Barrington High School.

===Private schools===
Private schools in Barrington include Barrington Christian Academy, St. Luke&#x27;s, and St. Andrew&#x27;s School.

Two Christian colleges occupied the Belton Court estate throughout the 20th and early 21st century. Barrington College was founded in 1900 and merged with Gordon College in 1985.

===Barrington Public Library===
Barrington established a library in 1806 when the pastor of the Barrington Congregational Church served as a librarian to the Barrington Library Society. After 20 years of the members paying a $1 fee, the town decided to help build up the library; starting in 1880 the library grew with books and materials. In 1984 the library moved next door. Since then, it has added a children&#x27;s room, space for meetings, and renovations to keep up with technology and patrons&#x27; needs.

==Historical locations and points of interest==

Nine residential and commercial developments from the town&#x27;s early suburbanization are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, a record of important historical sites in American history.

The Allen-West House, among Barrington&#x27;s oldest houses, stands on grounds farmed from the 17th to 20th century. A rare, well-preserved example of a vernacular house plan, it exemplifies architecture from Barrington&#x27;s agricultural era. Alfred Drowne Road Historic District and Jennys Lane Historic District are historical subdivisions that developed during the late 1800s and early 1900s, having attracted residents from neighboring urban communities. Rhode Island Country Club was constructed by Donald Ross in 1911, and since 1999 has hosted the CVS Charity Classic annually.

The Barrington Civic Center Historic District in central Barrington includes Prince&#x27;s Hill Cemetery, Barrington Town Hall, and the Leander R. Peck School, the last now housing the library and town senior center. Barrington Town Hall, described by the architects as &quot;medieval&quot;, was originally used as the town&#x27;s seat of government, library, and school; with the construction of Leander R. Peck School in 1917, the school moved and the library took its space. The T-shaped Elizabethan-Revival Peck School, which features a stairway to access its main entrance, was repurposed as the Barrington Public Library in the 1970s.

Nayatt Point Lighthouse, adjoined with its corresponding dwelling, served to guide vessels along the Providence River, marking the narrow passage between Nayatt and Conimicut Point. St. Matthew&#x27;s Episcopal Church, founded by an Episcopal mission in the 1880s, mixes Queen Anne and Gothic Revival-style architecture. Belton Court, built for Frederick Peck, a businessman and Rhode Island politician, was the site of two colleges before being auctioned to a Massachusetts investor who intends to repurpose it as elderly housing. O&#x27;Bannon Mill, among the first mills to mass-produce imitation leather, went through three purchasers before being converted into elderly apartment housing in the 1990s.

==Geography==
Barrington is on the eastern side of Narragansett Bay, in Bristol County, the third smallest county in the United States. Situated southeast of Providence, it consists of two peninsulas divided by the Barrington and Warren rivers. The shoreline of the western peninsula, Phebe&#x27;s Neck or Popanomscut, is marked by many coves and indentations, making a sharp bend at Nayatt Point. Rumstick Neck, around one and a half miles east of Nayatt, forms the southern end of Phebe&#x27;s Neck. Northeast of Phebe&#x27;s Neck lies the second peninsula, New Meadow Neck, which is bordered by Hundred Acre Cove and the Palmer River. According to the United States Census Bureau, Barrington has an area of , being composed of land and water.

Barrington lies on a low, mostly flat plain bordering the sea. This plain, composed mostly of layers of clay, gravel, sand, and silt soils, was formed by a melting glacier towards the end of the last ice age. Bedrock underlying the soil is largely composed of shales, sandstone, and conglomerate rock, with some outcrops of quartz. A few extremes in elevation, such as Nayatt Point, Primrose and Prince&#x27;s Hill, rise to heights of fifty feet.

Freshwater bodies in Barrington include artificial ponds originally used for brickmaking and some minor streams. Clay deposited by the glacier near Brickyard Pond is exposed to tidewater at Mouscochuck Creek, which was used as a canal for brickmaking operations. Two other artificial ponds, Echo Lake and Volpe Pond, exist along this area; a third, Prince&#x27;s Pond, drains into the Barrington River in the northeast.

== History ==

Settled shortly after the arrival of Roger Williams in 1636, North Providence was incorporated as a town in 1765. The originally incorporated town area included sections of the present-day cities of Providence and Pawtucket. Early colonial settlers in North Providence built stone-ender houses, such as the Joseph Smith House (1705) at 109 Smithfield Road, which is now listed in the National Register of Historic Places. In 1793, the first fully mechanized cotton-spinning mill in the United States, Slater Mill, was founded by Samuel Slater on the banks of the Blackstone River in North Providence. In 1874, the eastern section of North Providence where Slater Mill is located became Pawtucket, resulting in a large population decrease.

From its incorporation, North Providence was governed by a Town Council with a Town Clerk and a Town Treasurer. In 1974, the residents of North Providence elected their first mayor, Salvatore Mancini, who served the town in this capacity for 20 years. Since the installation of the first town mayor, North Providence has had four mayors who were elected by town residents and one mayor who was elected by the Town Council when the incumbent mayor at the time, A. Ralph Mollis, was appointed to the position of Secretary of State of Rhode Island. Below is a list of mayors who have served North Providence:

* Salvatore Mancini (1974–1994)
* G. Richard Fossa (1994–1996)
* A. Ralph Mollis (1996–2007)
* John Sisto (2007–2007)
* Charles Lombardi (2007–present)

From at least 1921–1971, the Centredale Manor area of North Providence was contaminated by textile, chemical, and drum recycling industries that discarded toxic liquids and wastes into the surrounding soil and river (EPA 1999).
In 2000, the United States Environmental Protection Agency declared a area including parts of Centredale Manor and Brook Village, both affordable housing units for senior citizens, a superfund site. The agency documented high levels of toxic chemicals like dioxin, VOCs, and PCBs in fish as well as soil from the area. Because of this the area has been fenced off from the community with warning signs against eating contaminated fish, and is undergoing evaluation for clean-up.

On May 4, 2010, three members of the North Providence Town Council were arrested by the FBI and charged in Federal Court with taking a $25,000 bribe so that a developer could build a supermarket in their town. After the arrests, Councilman Mansuet J. Giusti would become the new Town Council President and lead the remaining members out of difficult times to regain the trust of the public.

== Recreation ==

=== Parks ===

The town has two major parks, Governor John A. Notte Memorial Park and Capt. Stephen Olney Memorial Park, both have various sports fields, playgrounds; Gov. Notte Park has a freshwater beach and campground.

In 2015, Camp Meehan opened at Gov. Notte Park. Mayor Lombardi championed the sale of the land to the town of North Providence after it was to be built over by condominium housing. The Mayor allowed the land to be beautified using grant funds which were awarded to the town. Camp Meehan includes a newly renovated, modern building overlooking the Wenscott Reservoir which can house 250 guests for weddings and other such events. The Camp Meehan Hall held its first event in 2016.

<text>David John Chalmers (; born 20 April 1966) is an Australian philosopher and cognitive scientist specializing in the areas of the philosophy of mind, and the philosophy of language. He is a professor of philosophy and neural science at New York University, as well as co-director of NYU&#x27;s Center for Mind, Brain and Consciousness (along with Ned Block). In 2006, he was elected a Fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. In 2013, he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences.

Chalmers is best known for formulating the hard problem of consciousness, and for popularizing the philosophical zombie thought experiment.

Chalmers and David Bourget co-founded PhilPapers; a database of journal articles for philosophers.

== Early life and education ==
David Chalmers was born in Sydney, New South Wales, and subsequently grew up in Adelaide, South Australia, where he attended Unley High School.

As a child, he experienced synesthesia. He began coding and playing computer games at the age of 10 on a PDP-10 at a medical center. He also performed exceptionally in mathematics, and secured a bronze medal in the International Mathematical Olympiad. When Chalmers was 13, he read Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s 1979 book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot;, which awakened an interest in philosophy.

Chalmers received his undergraduate degree in pure mathematics from the University of Adelaide. After graduating Chalmers spent six months reading philosophy books while hitchhiking across Europe, before continuing his studies at the University of Oxford, where he was a Rhodes Scholar but eventually withdrew from the course.

In 1993, Chalmers received his PhD in philosophy and cognitive science from Indiana University Bloomington under Douglas Hofstadter, writing a doctoral thesis entitled &quot;Toward a Theory of Consciousness&quot;. He was a postdoctoral fellow in the Philosophy-Neuroscience-Psychology program directed by Andy Clark at Washington University in St. Louis from 1993 to 1995.

In 1994, Chalmers presented a lecture at the inaugural Toward a Science of Consciousness conference. According to the &quot;Chronicle of Higher Education&quot;, this &quot;lecture established Chalmers as a thinker to be reckoned with and goosed a nascent field into greater prominence.&quot; He went on to coorganize the conference (renamed &quot;The Science of Consciousness&quot;) for some years with Stuart Hameroff, but stepped away when he felt it became too divergent from mainstream science. Chalmers is a founding member of the Association for the Scientific Study of Consciousness and one of its past presidents.

Having established his reputation, Chalmers received his first professorship at UC Santa Cruz, from August 1995 to December 1998. In 1996 he published the widely cited book &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot;. Chalmers was subsequently appointed Professor of Philosophy (1999–2004) and then Director of the Center for Consciousness Studies (2002–2004) at the University of Arizona. In 2004, Chalmers returned to Australia, encouraged by an ARC Federation Fellowship, becoming professor of philosophy and director of the Center for Consciousness at the Australian National University. Chalmers accepted a part-time professorship at the philosophy department of New York University in 2009, becoming a full-time professor in 2014.

In 2013, Chalmers was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts &amp; Sciences. He is an editor on topics in the philosophy of mind for the &quot;Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&quot;. In May 2018, it was announced that he would serve on the jury for the Berggruen Prize.

In 2023, Chalmers won a bet—made in 1998, for a case of wine—with neuroscientist Christof Koch that the neural underpinnings for consciousness would not be resolved by the year 2023, while Koch had bet that they would.

== Philosophical work ==
=== Philosophy of mind ===
Chalmers is best known for formulating what he calls the &quot;hard problem of consciousness,&quot; in both his 1995 paper &quot;Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness&quot; and his 1996 book &quot;The Conscious Mind&quot;. He makes a distinction between &quot;easy&quot; problems of consciousness, such as explaining object discrimination or verbal reports, and the single hard problem, which could be stated &quot;why does the &quot;feeling&quot; which accompanies awareness of sensory information exist at all?&quot; The essential difference between the (cognitive) easy problems and the (phenomenal) hard problem is that the former are at least theoretically answerable via the dominant strategy in the philosophy of mind: physicalism. Chalmers argues for an &quot;explanatory gap&quot; from the objective to the subjective, and criticizes physicalist explanations of mental experience, making him a dualist. Chalmers characterizes his view as &quot;naturalistic dualism&quot;: naturalistic because he believes mental states supervene &quot;naturally&quot; on physical systems (such as brains); dualist because he believes mental states are ontologically distinct from and not reducible to physical systems. He has also characterized his view by more traditional formulations such as &quot;property dualism&quot;.

In support of this, Chalmers is famous for his commitment to the logical (though, not natural) possibility of philosophical zombies. These zombies are complete physical duplicates of human beings, lacking only qualitative experience. Chalmers argues that since such zombies are conceivable to us, they must therefore be logically possible. Since they are logically possible, then qualia and sentience are not fully explained by physical properties alone; the facts about them are further facts. Instead, Chalmers argues that consciousness is a fundamental property ontologically autonomous of any known (or even possible) physical properties, and that there may be lawlike rules which he terms &quot;psychophysical laws&quot; that determine which physical systems are associated with which types of qualia. He further speculates that all information-bearing systems may be conscious, leading him to entertain the possibility of conscious thermostats and a qualified panpsychism he calls panprotopsychism. Chalmers maintains a formal agnosticism on the issue, even conceding that the viability of panpsychism places him at odds with the majority of his contemporaries. According to Chalmers, his arguments are similar to a line of thought that goes back to Leibniz&#x27;s 1714 &quot;mill&quot; argument; the first substantial use of philosophical &quot;zombie&quot; terminology may be Robert Kirk&#x27;s 1974 &quot;Zombies vs. Materialists&quot;.

After the publication of Chalmers&#x27;s landmark paper, more than twenty papers in response were published in the &quot;Journal of Consciousness Studies&quot;. These papers (by Daniel Dennett, Colin McGinn, Francisco Varela, Francis Crick, and Roger Penrose, among others) were collected and published in the book &quot;Explaining Consciousness: The Hard Problem&quot;. John Searle critiqued Chalmers&#x27;s views in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;.

With Andy Clark, Chalmers has written &quot;The Extended Mind&quot;, an article about the borders of the mind.

According to Chalmers, systems that have the same functional organization &quot;at a fine enough grain&quot; (that are &quot;functionally isomorphic&quot;) will have &quot;qualitatively identical conscious experiences&quot;. In 1995, he proposed the reductio ad absurdum &quot;fading qualia&quot; thought experiment. It involves progressively replacing each neuron of a brain with a functional equivalent, for example implemented on a silicon chip. Since each substitute neuron performs the same function as the original, the subject would not notice any change. But, Chalmers argues, if qualia (for example, the perceived color of objects) were to fade or disappear, the brain&#x27;s holder could notice the difference, which would alter the information processing in the brain, leading to a contradiction. He concludes that such fading qualia are impossible in practice, and that after each neuron is replaced, the resulting functionally isomorphic robotic brain would be as conscious as the original biological one. In addition, Chalmers proposed a similar thought experiment, &quot;dancing qualia&quot;, which concludes that a robotic brain that is &quot;functionally isomorphic&quot; to a biological one would not only be as conscious, but would also have the same conscious experiences (e.g., the same perception of color when seeing an object). In 2023, he analyzed whether large language models could be conscious, and suggested that they were probably not conscious, but could become serious candidates for consciousness within a decade.

=== Philosophy of language ===
Chalmers has published works on the &quot;theory of reference&quot; concerning how words secure their referents. He, together with others such as Frank Jackson, played a major role in developing two-dimensional semantics.

==== Background ====
Before Saul Kripke delivered his famous lecture series Naming and Necessity in 1970, the descriptivism advocated by Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell was the orthodoxy. Descriptivism suggests that a name is an abbreviation of a description, which is a set of properties. This name secures its reference by a process of properties fitting: whichever object fits the description most, is the referent of the name. Therefore, the description provides the sense of the name, and it is through this sense that the reference of the name is determined.

However, as Kripke argued in &quot;Naming and Necessity&quot;, a name does not secure its reference via any process of description fitting. Rather, a name determines its reference via a historical-causal link tracing back to the process of naming. And thus, Kripke thinks that a name does not have a sense, or, at least, does not have a sense which is rich enough to play the reference-determining role. Moreover, a name, in Kripke&#x27;s view, is a rigid designator, which refers to the same object in all possible worlds. Following this line of thought, Kripke suggests that any scientific identity statement such as &quot;Water is H2O&quot; is also a necessary statement, i.e. true in all possible worlds. Kripke thinks that this is a phenomenon that descriptivism cannot explain.

And, as also proposed by Hilary Putnam and Kripke himself, Kripke&#x27;s view on names can also be applied to the reference of natural kind terms. The kind of theory of reference that is advocated by Kripke and Putnam is called the direct reference theory.

==== Two-dimensional semantics ====
Chalmers disagrees with Kripke, and direct reference theorists in general. He thinks that there are two kinds of intension of a natural kind term, a stance called two-dimensionalism. For example, the statement &quot;Water is H2O&quot; expresses two distinct propositions, often referred to as a &quot;primary intension&quot; and a &quot;secondary intension&quot;, which together form its meaning.

The &quot;primary intension&quot; of a word or sentence is its sense, i.e., is the idea or method by which we find its referent. The primary intension of &quot;water&quot; might be a description, such as &quot;the substance with water-like properties&quot;. The entity identified by this intension could vary in different hypothetical worlds. In the twin Earth thought experiment, for example, inhabitants might use &quot;water&quot; to mean their equivalent of water, even if its chemical composition is not H2O. Thus, for that world, &quot;water&quot; does not refer to H2O.

The &quot;secondary intension&quot; of &quot;water&quot; is whatever &quot;water&quot; refers to in &quot;this&quot; world. When considered according to its secondary intension, water means H2O in every world. Through this concept, Chalmers provides a way to explain how reference is determined by distinguishing between epistemic possibilities (primary intension) and metaphysical necessities (secondary intension), ensuring that the referent (H2O) is uniquely identified across all metaphysically possible worlds.

==== Philosophy of verbal disputes ====
In some more recent work, Chalmers has concentrated on verbal disputes. He argues that a dispute is best characterized as &quot;verbal&quot; when it concerns some sentence S which contains a term T such that (i) the parties to the dispute disagree over the meaning of T, and (ii) the dispute arises solely because of this disagreement. In the same work, Chalmers proposes certain procedures for the resolution of verbal disputes. One of these he calls the &quot;elimination method&quot;, which involves eliminating the contentious term and observing whether any dispute remains.

=== Technology and virtual reality ===
Chalmers addressed the issue of virtual and non-virtual worlds in his 2022 book &quot;Reality+&quot;. While Chalmers recognises that virtual reality is not the same as non-virtual reality, he does not consider virtual reality to be an illusion, but rather a &quot;genuine reality&quot; in its own right. Chalmers sees virtual reality as potentially offering as meaningful a life as non-virtual reality, and argues that we could already be inhabitants of a simulation without knowing it.

Chalmers proposes that computers are forming a form of &quot;exo-cortex&quot;, where a part of human cognition is &#x27;outsourced&#x27; to corporations such as Apple and Google.

Chalmers was featured in the 2012 documentary film entitled &quot;The Singularity&quot; by filmmaker Doug Wolens, which focuses on the theory proposed by techno-futurist Ray Kurzweil, of that &quot;point in time when computer intelligence exceeds human intelligence.&quot; He was a featured philosopher in the 2020 &quot;Daily Nous&quot; series on GPT-3, which he described as &quot;one of the most interesting and important AI systems ever produced.&quot;

== Personal life ==
 Chalmers was the lead singer of the Zombie Blues band, which performed at the music festival Qualia Fest in 2012 in New York.

Regarding religion, Chalmers said in 2011: &quot;I have no religious views myself and no spiritual views, except watered-down humanistic, spiritual views. And consciousness is just a fact of life. It&#x27;s a natural fact of life&quot;.

<text>Sun Prairie is a city in Dane County, Wisconsin, United States. A suburb of Madison, it is part of the Madison metropolitan area. The population was 35,967 at the 2020 census.

==History==
President Martin Van Buren commissioned a party of 45 men, including Augustus A. Bird, to build a capital for the Territory of Wisconsin in Madison. The group left Milwaukee on May 26, 1837, and traveled for days in the rain. On June 9, the group emerged at the edge of the prairie and with the sun shining for the first time in days, carved the words &quot;Sun Prairie&quot; into a tree. Charles Bird returned to the area two years later and became the first settler.

The Town of Sun Prairie was created on February 2, 1846. The village of Sun Prairie, which grew from that town, was incorporated in an act of the Wisconsin legislature on March 6, 1868.

On March 17, 1958, the Village Board ordered a referendum election on whether Sun Prairie should incorporate as a city of the fourth class after receiving a petition signed by over 100 electors. In the referendum election on May 6, 1958, 295 voted for incorporating as a city and 284 voted against. On May 15, 1958, the Wisconsin Secretary of State filed the certificate of incorporation of the city of Sun Prairie.
On July 10, 2018, a gas explosion leveled a downtown city block, destroying a bar and a pizza restaurant, as well as damaging the historic old city hall building and multiple other nearby buildings. Bar owner and Fire Captain Cory Barr was injured in the explosion and died as a result soon after. Many citizens and businesses around Sun Prairie offered their support to the Barr family and the affected businesses through fundraising campaigns. This tragic event was the origin of the tagline &quot;Sun Prairie Strong&quot;, a slogan which signifies the city&#x27;s strength as it comes together as a community.

==Geography==
According to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which, is land and is water. The city of Sun Prairie includes land that once was part of the towns of Bristol, Burke, Sun Prairie, and Windsor. On January 5, 2007, the city of Sun Prairie, city of Madison, village of DeForest, and town of Burke entered into a cooperative plan under which all remaining land in the town of Burke has been designated for attachment into the cities and village.

===Geology===
The Yahara River Valley encompasses part of the city of Sun Prairie. This area contains deep glacial deposits created by the Wisconsin Glaciation. The eastern part of Dane County, known as the drumlin and marsh physiographic area, includes most of Sun Prairie. The deposits found in this area include general glacial deposits and marsh deposits, and consist of many small drumlins interspersed with shallow glacial deposits having poorly defined drainage.

The general soils associations in the Sun Prairie area include the Dodge-St. Charles-McHenry, Plano-Ringwood-Griswold, and Batavia-Houghton-Dresden Associations. The Dodge-St. Charles-McHenry soils are found in the eastern, southern, and central portions of Sun Prairie. This association has a varied landscape, which is mostly sloping, with some areas on benches and in depressions. The Dodge, St. Charles and McHenry soils are well drained to moderately well drained. The Sable soils in this association are nearly level and poorly drained. Most of the soils in this association have moderate permeability and a high available water capacity. Most also have slight to moderate limitations for urban uses and farming.

===Cityscape===
The landscape of the city consists mostly of gently rolling hills and plains. The elevation of the city averages about above mean sea level.

Sun Prairie has developed a number of traditional neighborhood developments (TND). Often referred to as &quot;new urbanism&quot;, these neighborhoods focus on the pedestrian and the appearance of city streets. While these developments have sought to address the problems and concerns associated with conventional suburban development and urban sprawl, many occupy former farmland and undeveloped rural lands. The city&#x27;s planners addressed the criticisms that they were &quot;attempting to recreate &quot;pretend&quot; neighborhoods&quot; by noting that the aim of the TND was to borrow those design ideas and features effective in older neighborhoods and adapting them to current needs.

===Climate===

===Flooding===
The city of Sun Prairie encounters occasional flooding because of the presence of hydric soils, spring melting and its proximity to the Koshkonong Creek. This condition is compounded by storm water runoff from development and urbanization in the upper reaches of the watershed. Many residents of the city believe that the problems with flooding are worsening, becoming more frequent over the last 14 years.

A flood on April 11, 2008, caused by heavy overnight rains that outpaced the city&#x27;s storm drain system and leaked into the sewer system, resulted in flooding in residential basements. The city suffered considerably from the June 2008 Midwest floods.

* runs east–west through the western, central and southern portions of the state, and is located to the west of Sun Prairie. A total of of Interstate 90 lie in Wisconsin; the Madison exit (designated 135B) leads to US 151 North and Sun Prairie.
* as it occurs in Wisconsin runs east–west through the western, central and southeastern portions of the state. The junction of I-90 and i-94 occurs roughly six miles to the southwest of Sun Prairie heading eastward toward Milwaukee at what is commonly known as the &quot;Badger Interchange&quot; where the three interstates (I-39, I-90 and I-94) meet at the eastern terminus of WIS 30.
* U.S. Route 151 (normally called U.S. Highway 151, 151 or US-151) is a freeway in Sun Prairie that runs northeast–southwest across the eastern to southwest portions of the state. Sun Prairie is divided lengthwise by US-151, southwest to northeast, having four different access points: Windsor Street, Reiner Road/Grand Ave., Main Street and Bristol Street.
* Wisconsin Highway 19 (often called Highway 19, STH 19 or WIS 19) is a state highway which passes around the north side of Madison and crosses US-151 as it passes through Sun Prairie. It serves as a local connector route that links via various interchanges the communities of Sun Prairie, Watertown and Waunakee. The roadway follows two-lane surface road for the entire length with the exception of urban multilane arterials.

Prior to 1947, WIS 19 followed the current route of US-18 between Bridgeport and Madison. The route then passed through downtown Madison and followed then WIS 31 (part of the current US-151) to Sun Prairie. East of Sun Prairie the route followed its present-day alignment to Watertown. The route then followed present-day WIS 16 to Waukesha and east from there along present-day WIS 59 into Milwaukee. When the U.S. Highway system was implemented, WIS 19&#x27;s western terminus was relocated to Madison. The portion between Madison and Sun Prairie remained despite the debut of US-151 as did the eastern portion that became concurrent with US-16. In 1947, the eastern terminus was moved to Watertown, the section along US-151 was removed, and the portion between Mazomanie and Sun Prairie was implemented.

The part of WIS 19 roughly from those interstates west to WIS 113 had at one time been on the corridor of a planned beltline route around the north side of Madison.

<text>Hemel Hempstead () is a town in the Dacorum district in Hertfordshire, England. It is located north-west of London; nearby towns and cities include Watford, St Albans and Berkhamsted. The population at the 2021 census was 95,961.

Hemel Hempstead has existed since at least the 8th century and was granted its town charter by Henry VIII in 1539. However, it has expanded and developed in recent decades after being designated as a new town after the end of the Second World War.

==History==

===Origin of the name===
The settlement was called Henamsted or Hean-Hempsted in Anglo-Saxon times and Hemel-Amstede by the time of William the Conqueror. The name is referred to in the Domesday Book as Hamelamestede, but in later centuries it became Hamelhamsted, and, possibly, Hemlamstede. In Old English, &quot;-stead&quot; or &quot;-stede&quot; simply meant &quot;place&quot; (reflected in German &quot;Stadt&quot; and Dutch &quot;stede&quot; or &quot;stad&quot;, meaning &quot;city&quot; or &quot;town&quot;), such as the site of a building or pasture, as in clearing in the woods. This suffix is used in the names of other English places, such as Hamstead and Berkhamsted.

One theory suggests that a previous name for the settlement became corrupted to something similar to Hempstead, and that Hemel originated as a way of specifying Hemel Hempstead, as opposed to nearby Berkhamsted. Hemel is reflected in the German &quot;Himmel&quot; and Dutch &quot;Hemel&quot;, both of which mean &#x27;heaven&#x27; or &#x27;sky&#x27;, so it could be that Hemel Hempstead was in a less-forested area open to the sky, while Berkhamsted (which could mean &#x27;birch&#x27;, reflected in the Dutch &quot;berk&quot;) was in a forest of birch trees.

Another suggestion is that Hemel came from Haemele, the name of the district in the 8th century, and was most likely either the name of the landowner or meant &quot;broken country&quot;.

The town is now known to locals as Hemel. However, before the Second World War locals called it Hempstead. Emigrants from Hemel Hempstead, led by John Carman, settled in the American colonies in the early 17th century and founded the town of Hempstead, New York in 1644.

===Early history===

The first recorded mention of the town is the grant of land at &quot;Hamaele&quot; by Offa, King of Essex, to the Saxon Bishop of London in 705 CE. Hemel Hempstead on its present site is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086 as a &quot;vill, Hamelhamstede&quot;, with about 100 inhabitants. The parish church of St Mary&#x27;s was built in 1140, and is recognised as one of the finest Norman parish churches in the county. The church features an unusual spire, added in the 12th century, one of Europe&#x27;s tallest.

After the Norman conquest, Robert, Count of Mortain, the elder half-brother of William the Conqueror, was granted lands associated with Berkhamsted Castle which included Hemel Hempstead. The estates passed through several hands over the next few centuries including Thomas Becket in 1162. Hemel Hempstead was in the Domesday hundred of Danais (Daneys, i.e. Danish), which by 1200 had been combined with the hundred of Tring to form the hundred of Dacorum. This maintained its court into the 19th century. In 1290, King John&#x27;s grandson, the Earl of Cornwall, gave the manor to the religious order of the Bonhommes when he endowed the monastery at Ashridge.

The town remained part of the monastery&#x27;s estates until the Reformation and break-up of Ashridge in 1539. In the same year, the town was granted a royal charter by Henry VIII to become a bailiwick with the right to hold a Thursday market and a fair on Corpus Christi Day. The first bailiff of Hemel Hempstead was William Stephyns (29 December 1539). Henry VIII and Anne Boleyn are reputed to have stayed in the town at this time.

In 1953, a collection of unusually fine medieval wall paintings dating from between 1470 and 1500 were discovered in a cottage in Piccotts End, a village on the outskirts of Hemel Hempstead. This same building had been converted into the first cottage hospital providing free medical services by Sir Astley Cooper in 1827.

In 1581, a group of local people acquired lands – now referred to as Boxmoor – from the Earl of Leicester to prevent their enclosure. These were transferred to trustees in 1594. These have been used for public grazing and they are administered by the Box Moor Trust.

Remains of Roman villa farming settlements have been found at Boxmoor and Gadebridge which span the entire period of Roman Britain. A well-preserved Roman burial mound is located in Adeyfield. A major Romano-Celtic temple complex was unearthed at Wood Lane End in Maylands in 1966.

===18th to mid-20th century===

In the 18th and 19th centuries, Hemel Hempstead was an agricultural market town. Wealthy landowners built a few large country houses in the locality, including The Bury, built in 1790, and Gadebridge House, erected by the noted surgeon and anatomist Sir Astley Cooper in 1811.

As the Industrial Revolution gained momentum, commercial travel between the Midlands and London increased greatly. Hemel Hempstead was located on a direct route between these areas of industry and commerce and this made it a natural waypoint for trade and travel between the two. Initially the Sparrows Herne Turnpike Road was opened in 1762.

In 1793, construction began on the Grand Junction Canal, a major project to provide a freight waterway between the Midlands and the Port of London. In 1798, the canal from the Thames reached Two Waters, just south of Hemel Hempstead, and opened fully in 1805.
Hemel&#x27;s position on the commercial transport network was established further in 1837 when the route of the new London and Birmingham Railway reached the town. The line&#x27;s construction had been delayed for several years by vigorous lobbying by a number of powerful local landowners, including Sir Astley Cooper of Gadebridge House, who were all keen to protect their estates from invasion by the &quot;iron horse&quot;. Their campaign was successful and the main line was routed along the River Bulbourne instead of the River Gade, skirting around the edge of Hemel Hempstead. As a result, the railway station serving Hemel Hempstead was built one mile outside the town centre at Boxmoor; &quot;Boxmoor and Hemel Hempstead&quot; railway station (today&#x27;s Hemel Hempstead railway station) opened in 1837. The railways continued to expand and in 1877 a new route opened connecting Boxmoor to the Midland Railway at . The Harpenden to Hemel Hempstead branch railway — affectionately known as the &quot;Nickey Line&quot; — crossed the town centre on a long, curved viaduct, eventually serving three local stations in the town at , and Godwin&#x27;s Halt. A new Hemel Hempstead Hospital was established at the bottom of Hillfield Road in 1832.

Despite the incursion of various forms of transport, Hemel remained principally an agricultural market town throughout the 19th century. In the last decades of that century development of houses and villas for London commuters began. Hemel steadily expanded, but only became a borough, with its headquarters at the old town hall on 13 July 1898.

During the Second World War ninety high explosive bombs were dropped on the town by the Luftwaffe. The most notorious incident was on 10 May 1942 when a stick of bombs demolished houses at Nash Mills killing eight people. The nearby John Dickinson &amp; Co. factories which were used to produce munitions, were the target.

===New town===
After the Second World War, in 1946, the government designated Hemel Hempstead as the site of one of its proposed new towns designed to house the population displaced by the London Blitz, since slums and bombsites were being cleared in London. On 4 February 1947, the Government purchased of land and began work on the &quot;New Town&quot;. The first new residents moved in during April 1949, and the town continued its planned expansion through to the end of the 1980s. Hemel grew to its present population with new developments enveloping the original town on all sides. The original part of Hemel is still known as the &quot;Old Town&quot;.

Hemel Hempstead was announced as candidate No 3 for a New Town in July 1946, in accordance with the government&#x27;s &quot;policy for the decentralisation of persons and industry from London&quot;. Initially there was much resistance and hostility to the plan from locals, especially when it was revealed that any development would be carried out not by the local council but by a newly appointed government body, the Hemel Hempstead Development Corporation (later amalgamated with similar bodies to form the Commission for New Towns). However, following a public inquiry the following year, the town got the go-ahead. Hemel officially became a New Town on 4 February 1947.

The initial plans for the New Town were drawn up by architect Geoffrey Jellicoe. His view of Hemel Hempstead, he said, was &quot;not a city in a garden, but a city in a park.&quot; However, the plans were not well received by most locals. Revised, and less radical plans were drawn up, and the first developments proceeded despite local protests in July 1948. The first area to be developed was Adeyfield. At this time the plans for a revolutionary double roundabout at Moor End were first put forward, but in fact it was not until 1973 that the roundabout was opened as it was originally designed. (It was quickly christened &#x27;The Magic Roundabout&#x27; by locals, echoing the name of the children&#x27;s TV show.) The first houses erected as part of the New Town plan were in Longlands, Adeyfield, and went up in the spring of 1949. The first new residents moved into their new houses in February 1950.

At this time, work started on building new factories and industrial areas, to avoid the town becoming a dormitory town. The first factory was erected in 1950 in Maylands Avenue. As building progressed with continuing local opposition, the town was becoming increasingly popular with those moving in from areas of north London. By the end of 1951, there was a waiting list of about 10,000 wishing to move to Hemel. The neighbourhoods of Bennett&#x27;s End, Chaulden and Warner&#x27;s End were started. The Queen paid a visit shortly after her accession in 1952, and laid a foundation stone for a new church in Adeyfield – one of her first public engagements as Queen. The shopping square she visited is named Queen&#x27;s Square, and the nearby area has street names commemorating the then-recent conquest of Everest, such as Hillary and Tenzing Roads. This conquest is also celebrated in the name of a pub in Warners End – the &quot;Top of the World&quot;.

The redevelopment of the town centre was started in 1952, with a new centre based on Marlowes south of the old town. This was alongside a green area called the Water Gardens, designed by Jellicoe, formed by ponding back the River Gade. The old centre of the High Street was to remain largely undeveloped, though the market square closed and was replaced by a much larger one in the new centre. The former private estate of Gadebridge was opened up as a public park. New schools and roads were built to serve the expanding new neighbourhoods. New housing technology such as prefabrication started to be used from the mid-&#x27;50s, and house building rates increased dramatically. Highfield was the next neighbourhood to be constructed. The M1 motorway opened to the east in 1959, and a new road connecting it to the town was opened.

By 1962, the redevelopment of the new town as originally envisaged was largely complete, though further expansion plans were then put forward. The nearby United States Air Force base of Bovingdon, which had served as the town&#x27;s &#x27;de facto&#x27; airport, reverted to RAF use at this time, continuing as an active military airfield until 1971. A campus of West Herts College, the library, new police station and the Pavilion (theatre and music venue) were all built during the 1960s. The town seemed to attract its fair share of celebrity openings, with shops and businesses opened by Frankie Vaughan, Benny Hill, Terry-Thomas, and the new cinema was opened by Hollywood star Lauren Bacall. The last of the originally-planned neighbourhoods, Grovehill, began construction in 1967. However, further neighbourhoods of Woodhall Farm and Fields End were later built as part of the extended plans.

Like other first-generation new towns, Hemel is divided into residential neighbourhoods, each with their own &quot;village centre&quot; with shops, pubs and services. Each neighbourhood is designed around a few major feeder roads with many smaller cul-de-sacs and crescents, intended to minimise traffic and noise nuisance. In keeping with the optimism of the early post-war years, much of the town features modernist architecture with many unusual and experimental designs for housing. Not all of these have stood the test of time. A significant issue was how to choose names for all the new roads. Many areas of the new town used themes e.g. fields, birds, rivers, poets, explorers, leaders, etc.

In 1974, the government abolished the Borough of Hemel Hempstead and the town was incorporated into Dacorum District, along with Tring and Berkhamsted. The first chairman of that council was chairman John Johnson (1913–1977). In the 1980s, Dacorum District Council successfully lobbied to be recognised as the successor for the Royal Charter establishing the Borough of Hemel Hempstead and thus regained the Mayor and its Aldermen and became Dacorum Borough.

==Geography==

Hemel Hempstead grew up in a shallow chalkland valley at the confluence of the rivers Gade and Bulbourne, northwest of central London. The New Town expansion took place up the valley sides and onto the plateau above the original Old Town.

To the north and west lie mixed farm and woodland with scattered villages, part of the Chiltern Hills. To the west lies Berkhamsted. The River Bulbourne flows along the south-western edge of the town through Boxmoor. To the south lie Watford and the beginnings of the Greater London conurbation. To the east lies St Albans, a cathedral city and also like Hemel Hempstead, is part of the London commuter belt. Possibly the best view of Hemel Hempstead in its physical setting is from the top of Roughdown Common, a chalk hill to the south of the town, at .

==Districts==
===New town===
The grand design for Hemel Hempstead new town saw each new district centred around a parade or square of shops called a neighbourhood centre. Other districts existed before the new town as suburbs, villages and industrial centres, and were incorporated into the town.

*Adeyfield – Located on a hill to the east of the Old Town, this was the first of the New Town districts to be started. The first four families of Hemel Hempstead&#x27;s new town moved into their homes in Adeyfield on Wednesday, 8 February 1950.
*Apsley – a 19th-century mill town a mile south of Old Hemel which grew up around the paper making industry – notably the John Dickinson &amp; Co. mills. Now a suburb of Hemel with many warehouse outlets set in retail parks, a large office facility for Hertfordshire County Council and a large Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket.
*Bennetts End – Located on the rising ground to the south east and another original district of the new town. Construction began in 1951 and by autumn 1952, 300 houses were occupied.
*Boxmoor – A mostly Victorian era developed district to the southwest which grew up because it was near the LMS station and trains to London.
* Chaulden – an early new town district, west of the town, commenced in 1953 with its own neighbourhood shopping centre.
* Corner Hall – an estate adjacent to the Plough Roundabout frequently thought to be part of Apsley. Bounded by Lawn Lane and St Albans Hill.
* Cupid Green – an industrial area estate north east of the town and home to its recycling centre.
*Felden – Felden is a partly rural area south west of Hemel Hempstead that has many wealthy detached houses. It is home to the national headquarters of the Boys&#x27; Brigade.
*Gadebridge – A later 1960s development located north west of the old town around the Rossgate shopping parade.
*Grovehill – a housing estate towards the northern edge of Hemel Hempstead. It was developed as part of the second wave of development of the New Town commencing in 1967 and completed in stages by the early 1980s. Within the estate is Henry Wells Square, containing local shops, an off licence and a pub. The estate also contains Grovehill Community Centre, and Grovehill Playing Fields, home to many football pitches, a baseball ground and changing facilities. Grovehill also incorporates various churches, a doctor&#x27;s surgery and a dental surgery as well as several schools including The Astley Cooper School.
*Highfield – a district of the original new town located north of the old town.
*Leverstock Green – A village miles east of the old town which pre-existed the new town and which has now been subsumed into it, although retaining its original village centre. It was once a popular place for actors and artists to live.

It also has two infant schools and middle schools and a doctor&#x27;s surgery.

===Developments since the new town===

Jarman Park, the central location for leisure in the town, was previously agricultural land, which later becomes fields named after former town councilor and mayor, Henry Jarman, who oversaw the development of the New Town. The developments were built on land originally donated to the town for recreational purposes. Replacement open space was created to the east of the town, near Leverstock Green, Longdean Park and Nash Mills.

The first phase of recreational facilities, which opened in 1978, was the Loco Motion Skate Park. Subsequently, it became a dry ski slope with a small nursery slope next to it. Both areas were removed to make way for the Snow Centre which opened in 2009. A Tesco superstore was built in 1994 along with a petrol station, which was later expanded into a Tesco Extra. It was the first to be built with natural light let in. The Jarman Leisure Centre complex opened on 25 August 1995, originally managed by The Rank Organisation until 2007 and currently managed by the Tesco Pension Fund. The current 17-screen Cineworld is its flagship attraction. In addition to the cinema, there is an ice rink, several restaurants and a gym.

When it was opened as Leisure World at a cost of £22 million, the cinema originally featured eight screens and was operated by Odeon Cinemas, and later by Empire Cinemas until 2016. The complex also included the upstairs Toddlerworld play area, the Aquasplash water park, Hotshots, which was a 30-lane ten pin bowling facility with a bar, Jarman Park Bowls Club, which was an upstairs bowls facility with seven rinks, restaurants, a large arcade in the middle of the building, snooker and pool tables, a discothèque called Visage (subsequently Lava), a nightclub and a themed bar.

In December 2011, plans were submitted by the then landlords Capital &amp; Regional to redevelop the site. It proposed a collection of family-friendly cafes and restaurants, with Aquasplash closing down.

The cinema continued to operate while the ice rink went under refurbishment. The cinema was expanded from eight screens to 17 with one large 281 IMAX auditorium.

A nearby athletics track, opened in 1996, is managed by the sports group Sportspace, with a small adjacent children&#x27;s play park. The track is used by local schools for sports days.

The most recent facility, which opened in July 2011, is an extreme sports centre called the XC, which contains a skate park, caving, climbing walls, high ropes, a café and counselling rooms for young people. It is co-run by Youth Connexions and Sportspace.

==== Apsley Mills ====
The former John Dickinson &amp; Co. mills site, straddling the canal at Apsley, was redeveloped with two retail parks, a Sainsbury&#x27;s supermarket, three low-rise office blocks, housing, a mooring basin and a Holiday Inn Express hotel, as well as an additional office block. Some buildings have been retained for their historic interest and to provide a home for the Apsley Paper Museum.

The now disused mill site at Nash Mills was also redeveloped to build housing and community facilities. It retains some historic buildings.

==== Marlowes and the Old Town ====
An indoor shopping mall was developed adjacent to the south end of the Marlowes retail area in 1990. In 2005, the Riverside development, designed by Bernard Engle Architects, was opened, effectively extending the main shopping precinct towards the Plough Roundabout. The new centre includes several outlets for national retailers, including Starbucks and Waterstones. These two developments have moved the &#x27;centre of gravity&#x27; of the retail centre away from the north end of Marlowes, which has become an area for secondary outlets. Further extensive redevelopment of the northern end of Marlowes was given the green light in 2007 and has since been completed.

In late 2014, the council began to improve the appearance of the original new-town&#x27;s centre. The Old Town was refurbished with new paving, signage and landscaping. The old council buildings and library were closed and replaced with a new development named The Forum, which opened in early 2017. This area is now home to Dacorum Borough Council, the new library, Hertfordshire Police&#x27;s Safer Neighbourhood Team, the Hertfordshire Registration and Citizenship Service, Dacorum Community Trust, Mediation Dacorum, Relate and the Citizen&#x27;s Advice Bureau. Several hundred new homes have been built alongside this new development and a riverside walk/cycle way established. The abandoned market square is set to be more leisure facilities.

The Jellicoe Water Gardens have been restored, clearing up the overgrown trees, introducing a new play area and an area for picnics and gardening, as well as a community centre for volunteers, learning organisations and schools, and the Friends of the Jellicoe Water Gardens. There is also a new terrace for the flower garden.

The pedestrianised high street has been redeveloped, with a new play area and equipment around the street, such as giant coloured balls, slides, a tightrope and trampolines. A sculpture showcasing the work of Geoffrey Jellicoe has been installed on top of a new pillar.

Isle of Man-based residential developer Dandara redeveloped the old Kodak headquarters into a block of flats, with a new footbridge to the Riverside shopping precinct.

==== Maylands ====
Since the 2005 Buncefield fire, the former Maylands Avenue factory estate, which was badly affected by the fire, has been rebranded as Maylands Business Park. A 40-tonne sculpture by Jose Zavala, called Phoenix Gateway, has been placed on the first roundabout off the M1 to symbolise its renewal. A number of businesses have since located into the Maylands area, including Costa Coffee, Lok&#x27;nStore and McDonald&#x27;s.

=== Major planned developments ===

==== East Hemel ====
St Albans District council plans to meet its new homes building target by building on land to the east of Hemel Hempstead near the M1 motorway. This would comprise 2,500 new homes. The land is within St Albans planning jurisdiction but the development would have a major impact on Hemel services and consequently has proven controversial.

==== West Hemel ====
Land to the west of Chaulden and Warners End has been removed from the Green Belt designation and is due for development with 900 new homes.

==Commerce, industry and agriculture==

===Historical===

Historically, the area was agricultural and was noted for its rich cereal production. The agricultural journalist William Cobbett noted of Hemel Hempstead in 1822 that &quot;..the land along here is very fine: a red tenacious flinty loam upon a bed of chalk at a yard or two beneath, which, in my opinion, is the very best corn land that we have in England.&quot; By the 18th century the grain market in Hemel was one of the largest in the country. In 1797 there were 11 watermills working in the vicinity of the town.

The chalk on which Hemel is largely built has had commercial value and has been mined and exploited to improve farmland and for building from the 18th century. In the Highbarns area, now residential, there was a collapse in 2007 of a section of old chalk workings and geological studies have been undertaken to show the extent of these workings.

In the 19th century, Hemel Hempstead was a noted brickmaking, paper manufacturing and straw-plaiting centre. In later 19th and early 20th centuries, Hemel was also a noted watercress growing area, supplying 1/16 of the country&#x27;s national demand – following development of the New Town, the watercress growing moved to nearby Berkhamsted and Tring. The cress beds were redeveloped as the modern-day Water Gardens.

Joseph Cranstone&#x27;s engineering company was founded in 1798, and was responsible for much of the early street lighting in the town as well as it first gasworks. It became the Hemel Hempstead Engineering Company and stayed in business until the Second World War. In 1867 Cranstone&#x27;s son built a steam powered coach which he drove to London, but which was destroyed in a crash on the return journey. A local Boxmoor pub commemorates the event.

In 1803 the first automatic papermaking machinery was developed in Hemel by the Fourdrinier brothers at Frogmore. Paper making expanded in the vicinity in the early 19th century and grew into the huge John Dickinson &amp; Co. mills in the 20th.

A traditional employer in the area was also Brock&#x27;s, manufacturer of fireworks. The factory was a significant employer since well before the Second World War, and remained in production until the mid-1970s. The present-day neighbourhood of Woodhall Farm was subsequently built on the site.

From 1967 to 1983, it was home to one of the most remarkable newspaper experiments of recent times, when the Thomson Organisation launched the &quot;Hemel Hempstead Evening Post-Echo&quot;. This comprised two evening papers – the &quot;Evening Echo&quot; and the &quot;Evening Post&quot; – and was based at a modern headquarters in Mark Road which had previously been used as a hot water bottle factory. The dual operation was conceived by Lord Thomson of Fleet to take on the Northcliffe and Beaverbrook domination of the London evening paper market and tap into what he saw as a major source of consumer advertising.

The papers were remarkable not only for technological innovation but also journalistic excellence. Both the &quot;Evening Echo&quot; and &quot;Evening Post&quot; won design awards during the late 1960s and early 1970s, but it was the &quot;Evening Echo&quot; that took the major writing honours, with John Marquis being voted Provincial Journalist of the Year in 1974 and Melanie Phillips being named Young Journalist of the Year in 1975.

Many outstanding journalists worked on both papers during their heyday, with several going on to be editors and leading Fleet Street figures. Unfortunately, the operation fell victim to the freesheet revolution of the 1980s, the titles closing in 1983 with the loss of 470 jobs.

Significant historic local firms include:

* Addressograph, address labels and labelling systems
* Apple&#x27;s UK operations were originally based in Hemel, though they moved to much larger premises in Uxbridge in the late 1980s.
* BP
* Brocks Fireworks, firework manufacturer
* Crosfield Electronics – digital imaging systems, now part of FFEI Ltd.
* Hemel Hempstead Evening Post-Echo, then part of Thomson Regional Newspapers and one of the few nightly regional newspapers
* John Dickinson &amp; Co., paper manufacturing
* Kodak
* Lucas Aerospace – moved (as TRW Aeronautical Systems) to Pitstone in 2002.
* Parker Hannifin

==Governance==
Hemel Hempstead has two tiers of local government, at district and county level: Dacorum Borough Council and Hertfordshire County Council. There is no parish or town council in Hemel Hempstead, which has been an unparished area since 1974.

Historically, the parish of Hemel Hempstead was in the hundred of Dacorum. On 29 December 1539, Henry VIII granted the town a charter of incorporation under the title &quot;the Bailiff and Inhabitants&quot;, making the town a bailiwick, which was given the right to hold a market, a fair and a court of piepowders.

In 1835 Hemel Hempstead became the centre of a poor law union, and a workhouse was built on Redbourn Road.

The town&#x27;s status in having a bailiff and corporation was relatively unusual. It was sometimes described as a borough, but it was not counted as a borough for the purposes of the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, nor the Municipal Corporations Act 1883. As such, the old corporation did not become a municipal borough, and it did not assume the powers and responsibilities which were gradually given to municipal boroughs after 1835. Instead, local government functions passed to the board of guardians of the poor law union, which also became a rural sanitary district in 1872. The Local Government Act 1894 converted rural sanitary districts into rural districts and established elected parish councils. From December 1894, Hemel Hempstead therefore found itself governed by the Hemel Hempstead Rural District Council, Hemel Hempstead Parish Council, and the still-operating but largely powerless bailiff and corporation. One consequence of the town&#x27;s anomalous status was that it had the last operating court of piepowders in England, with the final session held on 2 December 1897.

The town petitioned Queen Victoria to allow it to become a municipal borough, and a borough charter was granted on 8 June 1898. The old corporation and parish council were both dissolved, replaced by a new municipal borough council. The borough also became independent from the Hemel Hempstead Rural District. The first mayor of the borough was Sir Astley Paston Paston-Cooper of Gadebridge House.

For most of its existence, Hemel Hempstead Borough Council was based at the Town Hall on High Street, which had been built in 1851 for the old corporation. A new Town Hall was built for the borough council in 1966 on Marlowes, between the old town and the new town centre.

Hemel Hempstead Municipal Borough was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of the district of Dacorum (named after the ancient hundred which covered a similar area) on 1 April 1974. No successor parish was created for the town, and so it became an unparished area. Dacorum District Council used the 1966 Hemel Hempstead Town Hall on Marlowes as its headquarters, renaming it Dacorum Civic Centre. In recognition of Hemel Hempstead&#x27;s former borough status, Dacorum district was awarded borough status on 10 October 1984.

==Twinned towns==
Hemel Hempstead, as part of the Borough of Dacorum, is twinned with:
* Neu-Isenburg, Germany

==Notable features==
Hemel is famous for its &quot;Magic Roundabout&quot; (officially called the &quot;Plough Roundabout&quot; from a former adjacent public house), an interchange at the end of the town centre (Moor End), where traffic from six routes meet. Traffic is able to circulate in both directions around what appears to be a main central roundabout (which it used to be), with the normal rules applying at each of the six mini-roundabouts encircling this central reservation. It was the first such circulation system in Britain.

Hemel claims to have the first purpose-built, free-standing multi-storey car park in Britain.

The new town centre is laid out alongside landscaped gardens and water features formed from the River Gade known as the &quot;Watergardens&quot; designed by G. A. Jellicoe. The &quot;Watergardens&quot; is home to many ducks, which have been known to cause major delays on the surrounding roads. The main shopping street, Marlowes, was pedestrianised in the early 1990s.

Hemel also was home of one of the first community-based television stations, West Herts TV, which later became Channel 10.

For many years, the lower end of Marlowes featured a distinctive office building built as a bridge-like structure straddling the main road. This building was erected on the site of an earlier railway viaduct carrying the Hemel to Harpenden railway, known as the &quot;Nickey Line&quot;. When the new town was constructed, this part of the railway was no longer in use and the viaduct was demolished. The Nickey Line is now used as a leisure route by walkers. The office building, occupied by BP, was designed to create a similar skyline and effect to the viaduct. In the early 1980s, it was discovered that the building was subsiding dangerously. As a result, it was vacated and demolished. Adjacent to the BP buildings was a unique, double-helix public car park. The lower end of Marlowes was redeveloped into the Riverside shopping complex, which opened on 27 October 2005.

A few metres away, overlooking the &#x27;Magic Roundabout&#x27;, is Hemel&#x27;s tallest structure, the 20-storey Kodak building. This originally consisted of 18 office floors, two plantroom floors and a basement. It also had a two-storey annex containing a restaurant, cinema and gym. Built as the Kodak Company&#x27;s UK HQ, the tower was vacated by the company in 2005, though it was temporarily reoccupied in 2006 after the Buncefield explosion destroyed Kodak&#x27;s other Hemel offices. It has since been converted into flats.

The Heathrow Airport holding area known as the Bovingdon stack lies just west of the town. At peak times on a clear day, several circling aircraft can be seen in the sky at any one time.

The national headquarters of the Boys&#x27; Brigade is located at Felden Lodge, near Hemel.

The Dacorum Heritage Trust, a local history advocacy group, has proposals to convert the 18th-century house at The Bury into a museum and art gallery to display a collection of archaeological and historical artefacts from the surrounding area. The project is currently awaiting necessary funding and planning permission to proceed.

===Public art===
The new town centre contains several sculptures by notable artists from the 1950s, including a 1955 stone mural by sculptor Alfred Gerrard entitled &quot;Stages in the Development of Man&quot;. There is also the &quot;Rock &amp; Rollers&quot; sculpture created by the French artist Hubert Yencess, which originally stood outside Bank Court but has been moved to the water gardens, and a fountain called &quot;Water Play&quot;.

The mosaic tiled map of the Hemel Hempstead district was designed by the artist Rowland Emett and is located on the side of the tiered car park in the Marlowes. Erected in 1960, it is grade-2 listed building.

A concrete and glass rainbow sculpture, &quot;Residents&#x27; Rainbow,&quot; by Californian artist Colin Lambert, was installed in the Marlowes in 1993. The ceramic rainbow tiling was replaced with a glass mosaic by artist Gary Drostle in 2010. Nearby is a 3D map of 1940s Hemel. 
In 2008, an abstract stone sculpture by Timothy Shutter, entitled &quot;A Point for Reflection&quot;, was unveiled outside the Riverside Shopping Centre.

A series of 33-feet-high blue steel arches, called the &quot;Phoenix Gateway,&quot; is located on the roundabout closest to the Hemel Hempstead junction of the M1 motorway. The concept behind the installation was to help regenerate the town after the Buncefield fire with a striking piece of commercial art. It was funded by the East of England Development Agency.

== Notable events ==

In December 2005, there was a series of explosions and fires at Buncefield oil depot.
This was widely reported as the largest explosion in peacetime Europe by many media organisations, although verification of the claim is scant.

===The Pavilion===
The Pavilion was a 1960s structure sited on the Marlowes just in front of the library. It was an entertainments venue that hosted emerging and internationally famous acts between the 1960s and 1990s. The venue was closed and the building demolished in 2002. According to local media reports, Dacorum Borough Council decided it was &quot;becoming increasingly unsuitable to meet the leisure needs of the local community&quot;. A &#x27;memorial service&#x27; was held on the tenth anniversary of its closure. The Forum, Hemel Hempstead&#x27;s new council, library and voluntary services hub built on the former Pavilion site opened its doors to the public on Monday 16 January 2013.

===Hemel Hempstead Theatre Company===

Originally known as The Hemel Hempstead Operatic and Dramatic Society, the Hemel Hempstead Theatre Company (HHTC) has operated since 1925. Over the years the company has performed in a number of locations, including the Luxor Cinemas in the Marlowes and St. John&#x27;s Hall at 72 St. John&#x27;s Road, which had been built in 1930 as extension of the nearby St. John&#x27;s Church. The first-ever theatrical performance at St. John&#x27;s Hall was given by the Theatre Company in April 1932. HHTC purchased the St. John&#x27;s Hall building in 1997 and renamed it the Boxmoor Playhouse. Holding up to 200 seats, the Playhouse is the largest theatre in Hemel Hempstead. Each year the Company stages a variety of productions, including plays, musicals and pantomimes. Due to the flexibility of the space, the company also holds social events such as quiz nights, creative workshops and cabaret evenings.

<doc id="258643" wikidata="Q7316200" url="?curid=258643" title="Restoration (Mormonism)">
<text>In Mormonism, the restoration refers to a return of the authentic priesthood power, spiritual gifts, ordinances, living prophets and revelation of the primitive Church of Christ after a long period of apostasy. While in some contexts the term may also refer to the early history of Mormonism, in other contexts the term is used in a way to include the time that has elapsed from the church&#x27;s earliest beginnings until the present day. Especially in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) &quot;the restoration&quot; is often used also as a term to encompass the corpus of religious messages from its general leaders down to the present.

The restoration is associated with a number of events that occurred which are understood to have been necessary to re-establish the early Christian church found in the New Testament, and to prepare the earth for the Second Coming of Jesus. In particular, Latter Day Saints believe that angels appeared to Joseph Smith and others and bestowed various priesthood authorities on them.

==Apostasy==
According to the LDS Church, the Great Apostasy in Christianity began not long after the ascension of Jesus Christ. It was marked with the corruption of Christian doctrine by Greek and other philosophies, with followers dividing into different ideological groups, and the martyrdom of the apostles which led to a loss of priesthood authority to administer the church and its ordinances.

With all priesthood authorities either martyred, taken from the earth, or teaching impure doctrines, there was a break in apostolic succession, and what remained was a mere fragment of the church established by Jesus. The Christian believers who survived the persecutions took it upon themselves to speak for God, interpret, amend or add to his doctrines and ordinances, and carry out his work without proper authority and divine direction from God. During this time, important doctrines and rites were lost or corrupted. Latter-day Saints specifically reject the early ecumenical councils for what they see as misguided human attempts to decide matters of doctrine without divine assistance, substituting debate and politics for divine revelation.

Latter-day Saints have said that various Old Testament and New Testament scriptures, including teachings of Christ himself, prophesy of this &quot;falling away&quot; or &quot;apostasy.&quot; Thus, Latter-day Saints refer to the &quot;restitution of all things&quot; mentioned in and claim that a restoration of all the original and primary doctrines and rites of Christianity was necessary. Adherents believe that important historical events such as the Protestant Reformation and the establishment of the United States Constitution, which explicitly allows for freedom of religion in its First Amendment, were necessary antecedents to the restoration.

Scholars today view the Latter Day Saint movement as emerging from the spiritual fervor of the restorationism movements spawned by the Second Great Awakening.

==Restoration of the Gospel==

Joseph Smith, founder of the Latter Day Saint movement who was responsible for organizing the Church of Christ, originally prayed about which church to join. In a vision in 1820 near Palmyra, New York, two personages (God the Father and Jesus Christ) instructed him not to join any churches, for &quot;all their creeds were an abomination.&quot; Smith described another vision in 1823 as being visited in his bedroom by an &quot;angel Moroni&quot;, who told him of a record of an ancient people written in an ancient language on golden plates. After repeated visits by this angel in successive years, Smith described receiving and translating this ancient record and publishing the translation as the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon provided many teachings about the atonement of Christ that were not as clear in the Bible, as also teachings about the House of Israel and the baptismal covenant. When Smith prayed in May 1829 about the need for baptism, he and Oliver Cowdery were visited by the resurrected John the Baptist, who by the laying on of hands gave them priesthood authority to baptize.

Coinciding with the restoration of the priesthood, Mormons believe that Smith received many revelations, visions, and visitations of heavenly messengers to instruct him in order to enable him to fulfill his responsibilities in propounding doctrine and re-establishing ordinances and temple covenants. These instructions came to Smith often in response to specific questions he asked in prayer. The majority of this history is recorded in one of the standard works, the Doctrine and Covenants. Additional details and background of the church in Smith&#x27;s era is presented in the church&#x27;s seven volume &quot;History of the Church&quot;.

In regard to the restoration of priesthood authority, Smith dictated the following passage found in Doctrine and Covenants 128:20–21:

In reflecting upon the responsibilities of teaching the constant revelations he received, Smith stated:

===Personages who appeared to Joseph Smith===
As part of the process of the restoration, Joseph Smith stated that a number of personages appeared to him to deliver messages, priesthood authority, or other instruction from God. These personages appeared either as resurrected beings or as translated beings. According to H. Donl Peterson, the following 50 personages appeared to Smith:

According to the LDS Church, all priesthood keys necessary to administer Jesus&#x27; church were given to Joseph Smith, who re-organized that church, which will continue in perpetuity. Hence, members refer to their church as &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ.&quot; The term &quot;Latter-day Saints&quot; refers to the fact that members of early Christianity were originally called &quot;saints&quot;, and the church reestablished by Smith is believed to be Christ&#x27;s church in the last days prior to the second coming of Jesus. Members of the church do not use the term to indicate they are better than others in any way, but rather that they are striving to follow Jesus Christ in their personal daily walks of life.

Members of the church believe that the restored church of Jesus Christ is the &quot;only true and living church upon the face of the Earth&quot; because of the divine authority restored through Joseph Smith. They believe that the church is the restoration of Jesus&#x27; original church, has the authentic priesthood authority, and all doctrines and ordinances of the gospel, fulfilling many of the prophecies of Daniel, Isaiah, Ezekiel, and Malachi in the Old Testament and also the prophesies of Peter, Jesus, and John the Revelator in the New Testament.

Members of the LDS Church maintain that other religions have a portion of the truth, mingled with inaccuracies. They also maintain that many other religions advance many good causes and do much good among the people insofar as they are led by the light of Christ, &quot;which lighteth every man that cometh into the world&quot; (John 1:9). The Church of Jesus Christ maintains an international humanitarian program and strives to &quot;do good unto all men&quot; (Galatians 6:10). The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, which faithful members of the Church believe is one of the keystones of their religion, and are encouraged to read it along with the Bible, teaches that &quot;all men are alike unto God&quot; and that &quot;When ye are in the service of your fellow beings ye are only in the service of your God (Mosiah 2:17)&quot;.

Missionaries of the LDS Church challenge all people everywhere to read the book for themselves, and pray to God to know if it is true. They believe that the validity of the Book of Mormon is interconnected with the validity of the church: if the Book of Mormon is true, then the church is true, and all people everywhere should seek this knowledge for themselves (Moroni 10:3-5). Members of the church believe that after one gains a knowledge of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon, one should be baptized a member of the church to follow the example that Jesus Christ has sent.

<text>Antipater (; ;  400 BC319 BC) was a Macedonian general, regent and statesman under the successive kingships of Philip II of Macedon and his son, Alexander the Great. In the wake of the collapse of the Argead house, his son Cassander eventually ruled Macedonia as a king in his own right. 

Probably active during the reign of Perdiccas III of Macedon, most of Antipater&#x27;s political career was as one of Philip II&#x27;s foremost Hetairoi. After Philip II&#x27;s death, he helped Alexander secure the throne. When Alexander began his wars against the Persian Empire in 336 BC, Antipater remained behind to hold Macedon and Greece as regent. While Alexander was campaigning, Antipater crushed revolts, like that of King Agis III of Sparta, and managed Greek affairs. After the Death of Alexander the Great in 323 BC, Antipater was reconfirmed in his position as viceroy of Europe in the Partition of Babylon. 

Antipater then became engaged in the Lamian War, where he was defeated in 322 BC and besieged at Lamia. He eventually escaped with the help of Leonnatus, and later, with the help of Craterus, finally defeated the Greeks at the Battle of Crannon. When he was informed of the regent Perdiccas&#x27; royal ambitions, Antipater joined a coalition with Ptolemy and Antigonus to overthrow Perdiccas in the First War of the Diadochi. 

After Perdiccas&#x27; death in 321/320 BC, Antipater was elected regent of all of Alexander the Great&#x27;s Empire at the Partition of Triparadisus. He brought the two kings, Philip III Arrhidaeus and Alexander IV, back to Macedon, but died soon after in 319 BC. On his deathbed, Antipater chose an infantry officer named Polyperchon as his successor as regent instead of his son Cassander. Antipater&#x27;s death and choice of successor initiated the Second War of the Diadochi, which would last 4 years and end with Cassander establishing control over Macedon, eventually founding the short-lived Antipatrid Dynasty.

==Family background and early career==

=== Family background ===
Antipater belonged to the Macedonian noble house of Iolaos, which may have been serving the Argead Kings of Macedon since as early as 432 BC. Antipater and his family may have been distant collateral relatives to the Argead dynasty. Born in 399/8 BC to a Macedonian nobleman called Iolaos, Antipater was originally from the Macedonian city of Paliura; had a brother called Cassander; was the paternal uncle of Cassander&#x27;s child Antigone and was the maternal great uncle of Berenice I of Egypt. Antipater had eleven children (four daughters, seven sons) from various unknown wives. His daughters were:
* Phila, wife of Balacrus, Craterus and Demetrius I of Macedon
* Eurydice, wife of Ptolemy I Soter. Her son Meleager would rule Macedonia for two months in 279 BC
* Nicaea, wife of Perdiccas and Lysimachus
* The wife of Alexander of Lyncestis
His sons were:
* Iollas
* Cassander, King of Macedonia
* Pleistarchus, a general and governor in his brother&#x27;s service.
* Phillip, also a military commander under his brother.
* Nicanor
* Alexarchus
* Perilaus
Antipater probably served politically and militarily under King Perdiccas III of Macedon, Philip II&#x27;s predecessor, arising to a position of renown before Philip assumed the throne in 359 BC. According to the Sudas, Antipater left a compilation of letters in 2 books and a history, called &quot;The Illyrian Deeds of Perdikkas&quot; (Περδίκκου πράξεις Ιλλυριακαί). Antipater was also a student of Aristotle. Aristotle named him as executor-in-charge of his will, when he died in 322 BC.

=== Career under Philip II of Macedon ===
Through his service with Philip II, alongside Parmenion, Antipater became one of Philip&#x27;s trusted advisors and a prominent Hetairoi, aiding in Philip&#x27;s expansion of the Macedonian state. Antipater is known to have campaigned in Thrace against the Odrysian King Kersobleptes early in his career. In 342 BC, he was appointed by Philip to govern Macedon as his regent while the former left for three years of hard and successful campaigning against Thracian and Scythian tribes, which extended Macedonian rule as far as the Hellespont. In 342 BC, when the Athenians tried to assume control of the Euboean towns and expel the pro-Macedonian rulers, he sent Macedonian troops to stop them. In the late summer of the same year, Antipater went to Delphi, as Philip&#x27;s representative (&quot;theoros&quot;) in the Amphictyonic League, a religious organization to which Macedon had been admitted in 346 BC; he attended the Pythian Games on Philip II&#x27;s behalf.When Thrace again threatened Macedon&#x27;s northern border in 340 BC, Antipater campaigned in the area and turned over the regency to a teenage Alexander the Great. After the triumphal Macedonian victory at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, Antipater was sent as ambassador to Athens (337–336 BC) to negotiate a peace treaty and return the bones of the Athenians who had fallen in the battle. Antipater is known to have had a long-standing friendship with the Athenian statesman Phocion; it may originate from this visit or earlier interactions. 

Antipater started as a great friend to both the young Alexander and the boy&#x27;s mother, Olympias, and aided Alexander in the struggle to secure his succession after Philip&#x27;s death, in 336 BC. He joined Parmenion in advising Alexander the Great not to set out on his Asiatic expedition until he had provided by marriage for the succession to the throne. 

==Career under Alexander the Great==

=== Regent of Macedon and Greece ===
On the Alexander&#x27;s departure eastward in 334 BC, Antipater was left regent in Macedonia and made &quot;general (&quot;strategos&quot;) of Europe&quot;, positions he held until 323/2 BC. The European front was to prove initially quite agitated, and Antipater also had to send reinforcements to the king, as he did while the king was at Gordium in the winter of 334–333 BC.

The Persian fleet under Memnon of Rhodes and Pharnabazus was apparently a considerable danger for Antipater, bringing war in the Aegean Sea and threatening war in Europe. Luckily for the regent, Memnon died during the siege of Mytilene on the isle of Lesbos and the remaining fleet dispersed in 333 BC, after Alexander&#x27;s victory at the Battle of Issus. More dangerous enemies were nearer home; tribes in Thrace rebelled in 332 BC, led by Memnon of Thrace, the Macedonian governor of the region, followed shortly by the revolt of Agis III, king of Sparta. The Spartans, who were not members of the League of Corinth and had not participated in Alexander&#x27;s expedition, saw in the Asian campaign the long-awaited chance to take back control over the Peloponnese after the disastrous defeats at the Battle of Leuctra and Battle of Mantinea. The Persians generously funded Sparta&#x27;s ambitions, making possible the formation of an army 20,000 strong. After assuming virtual control of Crete, Agis tried to build an anti-Macedonian front. While Athens remained neutral, the Achaeans, Arcadians and Elis became his allies, with the important exception of Megalopolis, the staunchly anti-Spartan capital of Arcadia. In 331 BC Agis started to besiege the city with his entire army, forcing Antipater to act.

==== Spartan rebellion of King Agis III ====

So as not to have two enemies simultaneously, Antipater pardoned Memnon and even let him keep his office in Thrace, while great sums of money were sent to him by Alexander. This helped to create, with Thessalian help and many mercenaries, a force double that of Agis, which Antipater in person led south in 330 BC to confront the Spartans. In the spring of that year, the two armies clashed in the Battle of Megalopolis. Agis fell with many of his best soldiers, but not without inflicting heavy losses on the Macedonians. Utterly defeated, the Spartans sued for peace; the latter&#x27;s answer was to negotiate directly with the League of Corinth, but the Spartan emissaries preferred to treat directly with Alexander, who imposed on Sparta&#x27;s allies a penalty of 120 talents and the entrance of Sparta in the league.

Alexander appears to have been quite jealous of Antipater&#x27;s victory; according to Plutarch, the king wrote in a letter to his viceroy: &quot;It seems, my friends that while we have been conquering Darius here, there has been a battle of mice in Arcadia&quot;. Antipater was disliked for supporting oligarchs and tyrants in Greece, but he also worked with the League of Corinth, built by Philip. In addition, his previously close relationship with the ambitious Olympias greatly deteriorated. Whether from jealousy or from the necessity of guarding against the evil consequences of the dissension between Olympias and Antipater, in 324 BC, Alexander ordered the latter to lead fresh troops into Asia, while Craterus, in charge of discharged veterans returning home, was appointed to take over the regency in Macedon. When Alexander suddenly died in Babylon in 323 BC however, Antipater was able to forestall the transfer of power.

Some later historians, such as Justin in his Historia Philippicae et Totius Mundi Origines et Terrae Situs blamed Antipater for the death of Alexander, accusing him of murdering him through poison. However, this view is disputed by most historians and Alexander is believed to have died of natural causes.

==Role in the Lamian and Diadochi Wars==
The new regent, Perdiccas, left Antipater in control of Greece. Antipater faced wars with Athens, Aetolia, and Thessaly that made up the Lamian War, in which southern Greeks attempted to re-assert their political autonomy.

=== Lamian War ===

At the onset of this struggle, the southern Greeks held an apparently decisive numerical advantage, fielding an army of some 25000 troops. Antipater&#x27;s levies numbered a meager 13000; drawn from a manpower pool that had been severely diminished by the campaigns of Alexander the Great. Furthermore, the southern Greek coalition was led by a talented general and one-time mercenary named Leosthenes, who had fought under Alexander and had seen first-hand the functions of the Macedonian war machine. An initial engagement with this coalition around the historic pass of Thermopylae saw Antipater&#x27;s Thessalian cavalry defect to the opposing side. Already outnumbered and now without a cavalry contingent, Antipater fought a token battle but was ultimately defeated and forced to retreat north to the Thessalian city of Lamia. Behind its stout defenses he endured a siege. By some unknown means he began desperately passing correspondence to would-be allies through the Athenian siege lines. In 322 BC he was relieved when Leonnatus, the satrap of Hellespontine Phrygia, responded to his call for aid and arrived in southern Thessaly with a force to break the investment.

Although Leonnatus fell in the ensuing battle, the Athenian coalition had been forced to use the entirety of its dwindling army (many of the Aetolian and Thessalian contingents having left the siege to tend to the harvest) to face him. Leonnatus&#x27; infantry retreated into rough country where the Aetolian and Thessalian cavalry could not pursue them, and survived the debacle largely unscathed. This turn of events allowed Antipater to slip out of the walls of Lamia before striking north for Macedonia, where he awaited the arrival of further reinforcements from Asia. Along the way he assumed control of Leonnatus&#x27; infantry corps, absorbing them into the remnants of his initial army. 

Craterus, another decorated general, had also received Antipater&#x27;s call for aid and arrived at Pella with a force of 16000 discharged veterans who had marched and fought under Alexander. The two generals made common cause, and to cement this new alliance Antipater married his daughter Phila to Craterus. The two then led a massive, combined force south to fight a final, decisive battle against the southern Greeks. Antipater defeated them at the Battle of Crannon in 322 BC, with Craterus&#x27; help, and broke up the coalition. At a peace treaty in the ruined city of Thebes, Antipater negotiated with an Athenian delegation led by Phocion and Demades. Here he imposed a rule of oligarchy upon Athens and demanded the surrender of Demosthenes and Hypereides (the foremost instigators of the revolt), the former committing suicide to escape capture, while the latter was imprisoned before having his tongue ripped from his mouth in a brutal execution. 

=== First War of the Diadochi ===

Later in the same year Antipater and Craterus were engaged in a mopping-up campaign against recalcitrant pockets of Aetolian resurgence when they received the news from Antigonus in Asia Minor that Perdiccas contemplated making himself outright ruler of the empire. Antipater and Craterus accordingly concluded peace with the Aetolians (much to the chagrin of future of Macedonian rulers) and went to war against Perdiccas, allying themselves with Ptolemy, the satrap of Egypt. Antipater married another of his daughters (Eurydike) to Ptolemy to strengthen this new alliance. Together with Craterus and his son Cassander, he then crossed over into Asia at the head of a considerable force in 321 BC. While in Phrygia, this army was divided in two; one under Craterus marching east into Cappadocia to face Eumenes, while the later under Antipater struck south to fight Perdiccas. While still in Syria, Antipater received two letters that drastically changed the power dynamic of the successor struggle at that point; firstly that Perdiccas had been murdered by his own soldiers in Egypt, and secondly that in one of the greatest upsets of the Hellenistic age, Craterus had fallen in battle against Eumenes (Diodorus xviii. 25–39).

==Regent of the Empire, death, and succession==
In the Partition of Triparadisus (321 BC), Antipater participated in a new division of Alexander&#x27;s great kingdom. He appointed himself supreme regent of all Alexander&#x27;s empire and was left in Greece as guardian of Alexander&#x27;s son Alexander IV and his disabled brother Philip III. Having quelled a mutiny of his troops and commissioned Antigonus to continue the war against Eumenes and the other partisans of Perdiccas, Antipater returned to Macedonia, arriving there in 320 BC (Justin xiii. 6). Soon after, he was seized by an illness which terminated his active career. 

Antipater died of old age in 319 BC, at the age of 81. By his side was his son Cassander, who later became king of Macedonia. Controversially, Antipater did not appoint Cassander to succeed him as regent, citing as the reason for his decision Cassander&#x27;s relative youth (at the time of Antipater&#x27;s passing, Cassander was 36). Over Cassander, Antipater chose the aged officer Polyperchon as regent.

Cassander became indignant at this, believing that he&#x27;d earned the right to become regent by virtue of his loyalty and experience. Thus he appealed to general Antigonus to assist him in battling Polyperchon for the position. In 317 BC, after two years of war with Polyperchon, Cassander emerged victorious. Cassander would go on to rule Macedonia for nineteen years, first as regent and later as king, ultimately founding the Antipatrid dynasty.

==Legacy==

=== Character ===
Antipater&#x27;s long career under three successive kings was first and foremost as a supporter of Macedon and a &quot;caretaker of Macedonian affairs&quot;; although his tenure as viceroy earned Antipater the fear and respect of many, it is generally agreed upon that unlike many other Successors he had little interest in the affairs of Asia and no firm claim, or interest, in supreme power. Generally, Antipater&#x27;s loyalty to the Argeads and his refusal to transfer the regency to his own children is seen as proof that he was a loyal Macedonian who put his homeland before his interests. 

=== Political legacy ===
Antipater&#x27;s death by prolonged illness and choice of successor would lead to the Second War of the Diadochi. Olympias, when she came to power in Macedon briefly in 317 BC, opened the grave of Antipater&#x27;s son Iollas and scattered his ashes. She may have not done the same to Antipater&#x27;s grave due to &quot;respect for Macedonian public opinion&quot;. Antipater&#x27;s death and the transferring of the regency to Polyperchon weakened the central authority of Alexander&#x27;s Empire even further, as Polyperchon lacked much of Antipater&#x27;s standing. Accordingly, the death of Antipater was a signal to many of the satraps and generals in Asia and Greece to start pursuing their own ambitions.

<doc id="258648" wikidata="Q849802" url="?curid=258648" title="Chandragupta I">
<text>Chandragupta I (Gupta script: &quot;Cha-ndra-gu-pta&quot;, r. c. 319–335 CE) was a monarch of the Gupta Empire, who ruled in northern and central India. His title Mahārājadhirāja (&quot;Great king of kings&quot;) suggests that he was the first suzerain ruler of the dynasty. It is not certain how he turned his small ancestral kingdom into an empire, although a widely accepted theory among modern historians is that his marriage to the Licchavi princess Kumaradevi helped him extend his political power. Their son Samudragupta further expanded the Gupta Empire.

== Period of reign ==

Chandragupta was a son of the Gupta king Ghatotkacha, and a grandson of the dynasty&#x27;s founder Gupta, both of whom are called &quot;Maharaja&quot; (&quot;great king&quot;) in the Allahabad Pillar inscription. Chandragupta assumed the title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; ( &quot;great king of kings&quot;) and issued gold coins, which suggests that he was the first imperial ruler of the dynasty.

Chandragupta certainly reigned in the first quarter of the 4th century CE, but the exact period of his reign is uncertain. His assumption of the title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot; has led to suggestions that he founded the Gupta calendar era, and that the epoch of this era marks his coronation. Based on this argument, several historians, including V. A. Smith and P. L. Gupta, date Chandragupta&#x27;s ascension to 319–320 CE, which they believe to be the beginning of the Gupta era. However, this is merely an assumption, and the identity of the founder of the Gupta era is not certain. Some historians, such as D. C. Sircar and R. C. Majumdar, theorize that the Gupta era marks the coronation of his son Samudragupta. S. R. Goyal theorizes that the era was started by the later king Chandragupta II, but its beginning was dated to Samudragupta&#x27;s ascension.

Chandragupta I probably had a long reign, as the Allahabad Pillar inscription suggests that he appointed his son as his successor, presumably after reaching an old age. However, the exact period of his reign is debated.

Various estimates for Chandragupta&#x27;s reign include:

* A. S. Altekar: 305–325 CE
* S. R. Goyal: 319–350 CE
* Tej Ram Sharma: 319–353 CE
* Upinder Singh: 319-335/336 CE CE

== Marriage to Kumaradevi ==

Chandragupta married the Lichchhavi princess Kumaradevi. Licchavi is the name of an ancient clan that was headquartered at Vaishali in present-day Bihar during the time of Gautama Buddha. A Lichchhavi kingdom existed in the present-day Nepal in the first millennium CE. However, the identity of Kumaradevi&#x27;s Lichchhavi kingdom is not certain. 

An 8th-century inscription of the Lichchhavi dynasty of Nepal claims that their legendary ancestor Supushpa was born in the royal family of Pushpapura, that is, Pataliputra in Magadha. According to some historians, such as V. A. Smith, the Lichchhavis ruled at Pataliputra during Samudragupta&#x27;s time. However, this inscription states that Supushpa ruled 38 generations before the 5th-century king Manadeva, that is, centuries before Chandragupta&#x27;s period. Therefore, the claim made in this inscription, even if true, cannot be taken as concrete evidence of the Lichchhavi rule at Pataliputra during Chandragupta&#x27;s time.

The Lichchhavi kingdom of Kumaradevi is unlikely to have been located in present-day Nepal because Samudragupta&#x27;s Allahabad Pillar inscription mentions Nepala (that is, Nepal) as a distinct, subordinate kingdom. Given the lack of any other evidence, historian R. C. Majumdar assumed that during Chandragupta&#x27;s time, the Lichchhavis ruled at Vaishali, which is the only other base of the clan known from the historical records.

=== Impact of marriage ===

The gold coins attributed to Chandragupta bear portraits of Chandragupta and Kumaradevi, and the legend &quot;Lichchhavayah&quot; (&quot;the Lichchhavis&quot;). Their son Samudragupta is described as &quot;Lichchhavi-dauhitra&quot; (&quot;Lichchhavi daughter&#x27;s son&quot;) in the Gupta inscriptions. Except Kumaradevi, these inscriptions do not mention the paternal family of the dynasty&#x27;s queens, which suggests that the Gupta family considered Kumaradevi&#x27;s marriage to Chandragupta an important event.

Numismatist John Allan theorized that Chandragupta defeated a Lichchhavi kingdom headquartered at Vaishali, and that Kumaradevi&#x27;s marriage to him happened as part of a peace treaty. He suggested that the Guptas considered this marriage a prestigious one simply because of the ancient lineage of the Lichchhavis. However, the ancient text &quot;Manusamhita&quot; regards the Lichchhavis as &quot;unorthodox and impure&quot; (&quot;vratya&quot;). Therefore, it is unlikely that the Guptas proudly mentioned Samudragupta&#x27;s Lichchhavi ancestry to increase their social prestige. Also, it is unlikely that the Guptas allowed the name of the Lichchhavis to appear on the dynasty&#x27;s coins after defeating them.

It is more likely that the marriage helped Chandragupta extend his political power and dominions, enabling him to adopt the title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;. The appearance of the Lichchhavis&#x27; name on the coins is probably symbolic of their contribution to the expansion of the Gupta power. After the marriage, Chandragupta probably became the ruler of the Lichchhavi territories. Alternatively, it is possible that the Gupta and the Lichchhavi states formed a union, with Chandragupta and Kumaradevi being regarded as the sovereign rulers of their respective states, until the reign of their son Samudragupta, who became the sole ruler of the united kingdom.

== Extent of kingdom ==

Little is known about Chandragupta other than his ancestry, his marriage, and his expansion of the Gupta power, as evident from his title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;. The territorial extent of Chandragupta&#x27;s kingdom is not known, but it must have been substantially larger than that of the earlier Gupta kings, as Chandragupta bore the title &quot;Maharajadhiraja&quot;. Modern historians have attempted to determine the extent of his kingdom based on the information from the &quot;Puranas&quot; and the Allahabad Pillar inscription issued by his son Samudragupta.

The Allahabad Pillar inscription names several kings subjugated by Samudragupta. Based on the identity of these kings, several modern historians have tried to determine the extent of the territory that he must have inherited from Chandragupta. For example, since the king of the northern part of the Bengal region is not mentioned among the kings subjugated by Samudragupta, these historians theorize that northern Bengal was a part of Chandragupta&#x27;s kingdom. However, such conclusions cannot be made with certainty, as the identity of several of the kings subjugated by Samudragupta is a matter of debate. Nevertheless, the information from the inscription can be used to determine the territories that were not a part of Chandragupta&#x27;s kingdom:

* In the west, Chandragupta&#x27;s kingdom probably did not extend much beyond Prayaga (modern Prayagraja), as Samudragupta defeated the kings of present-day western Uttar Pradesh.
* In the south, Chandragupta&#x27;s kingdom did not include the Mahakoshala area of Central India, as Samudragupta defeated the kings of the forest region, which is identified with this area.
* In the east, Chandragupta&#x27;s kingdom did not include southern Bengal, because the Allahabad Pillar inscription mentions Samatata in that region as a frontier kingdom. Moreover, the Delhi Iron Pillar inscription suggests that Vanga kingdom in that region was conquered by the later king Chandragupta II.
* In the north, the Allahabad Pillar inscription mentions Nepala (in present-day Nepal) as a frontier kingdom.

A passage in the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; states that the Guptas ruled over Saketa (modern Ayodhya), Prayaga, and Magadha. Based on this, multiple modern scholars have theorized that Chandragupta ruled over these territories. However, this conclusion is not certain, as the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; does not mention the name of a specific ruler. Scholars critical of this theory argue that the passage describes the territories of either the dynasty&#x27;s founder Gupta or its 6th century rulers who oversaw the kingdom&#x27;s decline. Critics also point out that the corresponding passage in the &quot;Vishnu Purana&quot; states that the Guptas and the Magadhas jointly ruled over Prayaga and Magadha, and does not mention Saketa at all. The corresponding passage in the various manuscripts of &quot;Bhagavata Purana&quot; either does not mention the word &quot;Gupta&quot;, or uses it as a common noun meaning &quot;protected&quot; instead of using it as the name of a specific dynasty. Even somes manuscripts of the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; use the words &quot;Guhya&quot;, &quot;Sapta&quot; or &quot;Manidhanyaka&quot; instead of &quot;Gupta&quot;. Supporters of the theory dismiss these as scribal mistakes. Historian Ashvini Agrawal argues that the &quot;Vayu Purana&quot; passage cannot be a reference to the Gupta territories during the empire&#x27;s period of decline, as it does not mention Bengal, which formed a part of the Gupta kingdom during this period.

According to historian R. C. Majumdar, Chandragupta&#x27;s kingdom may have included the whole of present-day Bihar, and a part of present-day Uttar Pradesh and Bengal. Historian Dilip Kumar Ganguly believes that he ruled a large kingdom extending from Allahabad in the west to the Ganga river in Bengal in the east; the kingdom excluded south-eastern Bengal (Samatata), southern Bengal (Vanga), eastern Bengal, and western Bengal (the kingdom of Chandravarman). Historian Ashvini Agarwal states that his kingdom included central and eastern Uttar Pradesh (including Prayaga and Awadh), and Bihar; but not Bengal.

== Coinage ==

Gold coins bearing portraits of Chandragupta and Kumaradevi have been discovered at Mathura, Ayodhya, Lucknow, Sitapur, Tanda, Ghazipur, and Varanasi in Uttar Pradesh; Bayana in Rajasthan; and Hajipur in Bihar. The obverse of these coins depicts portraits of Chandragupta and Kumaradevi, with their names in the Gupta script. The reverse shows a goddess seated on a lion, with the legend &quot;Li-ccha-va-yah&quot; (𑁊, &quot;the Lichchhavis&quot;).

Various scholars, including numismatist John Allan, have considered that the gold coins bearing the portraits of Chandragupta and Kumaradevi were issued by Samudragupta to commemorate his parents, while others have attributed the issue of these coins to Chandragupta himself, or even suggested that these coins were issued by the Lichchhavis.

V. S. Pathak theorized that the coins show the royal couple in the &quot;vaivahika&quot; (nuptial) pose, but there is no concrete evidence that the coins depict the royal wedding. S.V. Sohoni theorized that the coins depicted Chandragupta taking leave of Kumaradevi while going on a military campaign, but this is doubtful given the lack of a phrase indicative of military prowess (unlike the coins of their son Samudragupta). The coins probably simply depict Chandragupta and Kumaradevi as joint rulers.

The identity of the female figure appearing on the reverse of these coins is uncertain. It is unlikely that she was a Gupta queen, as the depiction of a female figure seated on a lion is characteristic of a goddess in historical art of India. Some historians, such as A. S. Altekar, have identified the goddess as Durga. However, although Durga is often represented as seated on a lion, this attribute is not unique to her: Lakshmi has also been depicted as seated on a lion. For example, Hemadri&#x27;s works mention &quot;Simha-vahini&quot; (&quot;having lion as her vahana&quot;) Lakshmi, and images from Khajuraho depict &quot;Simha-vahini&quot; Gajalakshmi. Some scholars, such as John Allan, have identified the goddess on the coins as Lakshmi, who is the goddess of fortune and the wife of Vishnu. She may have been featured on the coins as a symbol of the Guptas&#x27; royal prosperity, or as a mark of their Vaishnavite affiliation, but this cannot be said with certainty. The goddess may also have been a tutelary goddess of the Lichchhavis, whose name appears below her image, but this cannot be said with certainty either.

== Successor ==

The Allahabad Pillar inscription and the Eran stone inscription of Samudragupta state that his father Chandragupta selected him as the next king. The Allahabad Pillar inscription states that Chandragupta appointed him to &quot;protect the earth&quot;, which suggests that Chandragupta renounced the throne in his old age, and appointed his son as the next king.

The discovery of the coins issued by a Gupta ruler named Kacha have led to some debate about Chandragupta&#x27;s successor. According to one theory, Kacha was another name for Samudragupta. Another theory is that Kacha was the elder brother of Samudragupta, and succeeded their father Chandragupta.

The &quot;Kaliyuga-raja-vrttanta&quot; section of the &quot;Bhavishyottara Purana&quot; mentions that Kacha was a son of Chandragupta I from a Licchavi princess. It describes Kacha as jointly ruling with his father, and states that Samudragupta killed their father. However, these passages (and possibly the entire text) are a modern forgery.

<text>Ghatotkacha (, ; ) is a prominent character in the ancient Indian epic &quot;Mahabharata&quot;. His name comes from the fact that his head was hairless (&quot;utkacha&quot;) and shaped like a ghatam, or a pot. Ghatotkacha was the son of the Pandava Bhima and the demoness Hidimbi, and thus a half-human, half-demon hybrid.

He is the father of Anjanaparva, Barbarika and Meghavarna. As the head of one akshauhini army, he was an important fighter from the Pandava side in the Kurukshetra war and caused a great deal of destruction to the Kaurava army. Ghatotkacha killed many demons like Alambusha, Alayudha, and many gigantic Asuras. He was specifically called out as the warrior who forced Karna to use his Vasavi Shakti weapon, and courted a hero’s death in the great war.

==Birth and legends==
On the burning of the &#x27;Lakshagriha&#x27;, the Pandavas escape through a tunnel and reach a forest. While they were sleeping, the demon chief Hidimba in the forest sees the Pandavas from the top of a tree, and he appoints his sister Hidimbi to bring them to him for food.

Hidimbi goes to the Pandavas in the guise of a beautiful woman. She is attracted to Bhima and prays for the return of her love. She alerts the Pandavas to her brother&#x27;s demands, pleading with them to leave the forest; however, Bhima refuses. Impatient at the delay, Hidimba runs towards the Pandavas but is slain by Bhima.

Hidimbi then approaches Kunti and requests Bhima&#x27;s hand in marriage. The Pandavas agree to the proposal on the condition that once a child is born to Hidimbi, they&#x27;d have to continue their peregrinations. Later, Ghatotkacha is born to Hidimbi and Bhima. Indra bestows on Ghaṭotkacha prowess enough to be a suitable opponent to Karna. 

Ghatotkacha belonged to Kachari Kingdom of Assam, India. It is believed that he obtained magical powers from Mayong (Assam). The village is approximately 60 km away from Guwahati Airport.

Ghatotkacha grows up under the care of Hidimbi. Like his father, Ghatotkacha&#x27;s weapon of choice is the gada. 

According to folktales, Ghatotkacha marries Ahilawati and their sons are Barbarika, Anjanaparva, and Meghavarna.

=== Hidimbi&#x27;s sacrifice request ===
According to non canonic folktales, years later, one day Hidimbi asks Ghatotkacha to fetch a human to sacrifice to Kali. On his way to do so, he spots a Brahmin and his wife traveling with their three children. Ghatotkacha approaches them and requests one of them to come with him to be his mother&#x27;s sacrifice to the goddess.

The Brahmin offers himself, but his wife insists that she would go. Finally, their second son agrees to go with Ghatotkacha but asks to first bathe in the river Ganga. Bhima, living in exile in the forest with his brothers, comes across the scene. Upon discovering the pending sacrifice, he steps in to take the child&#x27;s place. Ghatotkacha returns to his mother with Bhima in tow, only to become shocked when she tells him that Bhima is his father. Scolded by Bhima, both Ghatotkacha and Hidimbi agree to end the practice of human sacrifice.

=== Interactions with Bhima ===
During their exile the pandavas were too tired to walk further, then Bhima remembers Ghatotkacha, who immediately appeared before the Pandavas, and also brought down many demons at the behest of Bhima. Ghatotkach carrying Panchali on his shoulders, and the demons carrying Pandava brothers on their shoulders went by air to Badrikashrama, where Naranarayana was meditating, landed them there, and then he (Ghatotkach and his companions) bid farewell to the Pandavas.

=== Kurukshetra War ===
In the Kurukshetra War, Ghatotkacha is summoned by Bhima to fight on the Pandava side. In the battle of the first day he fought against Alambusha, Duryodhana, and Bhagadatta. Terrified of the terrible course of the battle, the Kauravas deliberately postponed the battle for that day.
On the 8th day of battle, Ghatotkacha has a prolonged clash with Alambusha, and though he manages to severely wound the other demon, he is unable to prevent his retreat.

The 14th day of battle features Ghatotkacha in a major role. During the morning battle, he becomes enraged when his mighty son Anjanparva is killed by Ashwatthama. Invoking his magical powers, he brings great havoc to the Kaurava army using his power of illusion, even scaring away great warriors like Drona, Duryodhana, Karna and Dushasana. Ashwatthama attempts to rally fleeing soldiers, dispelling Ghatotkacha&#x27;s illusion and managing to knock the demon unconscious. After coming to his senses, Ghatotkacha fights with Ashwatthama in a long duel. During the fight, both combatants use their magical powers and celestial weapons, though Ashwatthama manages to hold his ground and forces Ghatotkacha to withdraw.

After the death of Jayadratha on Day 14, with the battle continuing past sunset, Ghatotkacha truly shines; his powers were at their most effective at night as demons&#x27; abilities are heightened. Along with his troops, Ghatotkacha kills Alayudha and Alambusha, smashing the latter&#x27;s head with a mace. With Ghatotkacha on a rampage, another fight took place between Ashwatthama and Ghatotkacha. Ashwatthama manages to defeat Ghatotkacha multiple times, but the powerful demon manages to escape using his illusions. On the other hand Karna also defeats Ghatotkacha twice on the battlefield after some tough battles but yet is unable to prevent Ghatotkacha from wreaking havoc on the Kaurava army. As the army breaks around him, with even Duryodhana forced to flee with his flag in tatters, Karna uses &quot;Vasavi Śhakti&quot; as a last resort to ultimately kill the powerful demon. This weapon had been bestowed by Lord Indra and could only be used once; Karna had been keeping it in reserve to use against Arjuna.

Though mortally wounded by the weapon Vasavi Śakti, Ghatotkacha rises to the sky and manages to enlarge his body, crushing one akshauhini of the Kaurava army. The Pandavas were filled with grief at Ghatotkacha&#x27;s death. Krishna, however, could not help but smile, knowing that Ghatotkacha has saved Arjuna from Karna.

===Indonesian version===

The Kurukshetra War in Javanese and also Balinese wayang is usually called by the name &quot;Bharatayuddha&quot;. The story was adapted and developed from the script &quot;Kakawin Bharatayuddha&quot; written in 1157 during the time of the Kediri Kingdom (present day East Java, Indonesia). In the &quot;wayang&quot; puppet version, Ghatotkacha (locally spelled &#x27;Gatotkaca&#x27;) is very close to his cousin named Abhimanyu, son of Arjuna. Abhimanyu married Uttara the daughter of Virata Kingdom, after he claimed he was a virgin. In fact, Abhimanyu was married to Sitisundari, daughter of Krishna. Sitisundari who is entrusted in the palace of Ghatotkacha heard the news that her husband had remarried. Ghatotkacha&#x27;s Uncle, named Kalabendana, came to Abhimanyu to take him home (Kalabendana was Arimbi&#x27;s youngest brother, a dwarf giant but with a plain and noble heart). This had made Uttara jealous, and Abhimanyu was forced to swear that if he indeed had a wife other than Uttara, he would be willing to die beaten by his enemies later on. Kalabendana met with Ghatotkacha to report Abhimanyu&#x27;s attitude. Ghatotkacha actually scolded Kalabendana, which he considered presumptuously interfering in his cousin&#x27;s household affairs. Out of an impulse of anger, Ghatotkacha hit Kalabendana&#x27;s head, and even though the act was carried out accidentally, Kalabendana was killed instantly.

When the Bharatayuddha war broke out, Abhimanyu was actually killed by the Kauravas on the 13th day. On the 14th day, Arjuna managed to avenge his son&#x27;s death by beheading Jayadratha. Duryodhana was very sad over the death of Jayadratha, his own brother-in-law. He forced Karna to attack the Pandava camp that night. Karna obeyed even though this violates the rules of the war. After learning that the Kauravas launched a night attack, the Pandavas sent Ghatotkacha to head off. Ghatotkacha was deliberately chosen because &quot;Kotang Antrakusuma&quot; armor which he wears is able to emit bright light to shine on Kaurava&#x27;s army. Ghatotkacha successfully killed a Kaurava ally named Lembusa. Meanwhile, two of his uncles, Brajalamadan and Brajawikalpa, died at the hands of their enemies, each named Lembusura and Lembusana.

Ghatotkacha faced Karna, the wielder of Kontawijaya weapon. He created his twins as many as a thousand people to make Karna feel confused. On the instructions of his father, named Surya, Karna managed to find the original Ghatotkacha. He then released Konta weapon in the direction of Ghatotkacha. Ghatotkacha tried to evade this by flying as high as possible. But the spirit of Kalabendana suddenly appeared to catch Kontawijaya while delivering news from heaven that the death of Ghatotkacha had been set that night. Ghatotkacha surrenders himself to his fate and requests that his body would be used to kill Kaurava&#x27;s armies. Kalabendana agrees, then stabbed Ghatotkacha&#x27;s navel using Konta weapon. The weapon merges back into its sheath, which is the mastaba wood still stored in Ghatotkacha&#x27;s gut. Ghatotkacha dies, and the spirit of Kalabendana threw his body towards Karna who managed to jump to escape death. Karna&#x27;s chariot was shattered to pieces as a result of being crushed by Ghatotkacha&#x27;s body, and the fragments of the chariot shot in all directions and killed the Kaurava soldiers who were around it.

==Lineage==
Ghatotkacha had three sons - Barbarika, Anjanparva and Meghavarna. The existence of Barbarika is debated as he is mentioned in the later additions to the Skanda Purana, and not in the official renditions of the Mahabharata.

However, Ghatotkacha&#x27;s Lineage is supposed to have extended longer. The royal family of the Dimasa Kingdom claimed descent from Ghatotkacha.

<doc id="258651" wikidata="Q5736222" url="?curid=258651" title="Herbsaint">
<text>Herbsaint is a brand name of anise-flavored liqueur originally created as an absinthe-substitute in New Orleans, Louisiana in 1934, and currently produced by the Sazerac Company.

It was developed by J. Marion Legendre and Reginald Parker of the city, who had learned how to make absinthe while in France during World War I. It was originally produced under the name &quot;Legendre Absinthe&quot;, although it never contained absinthe&#x27;s essential ingredient, Grande Wormwood &quot;(Artemisia absinthium)&quot;. It first went on sale following the repeal of Prohibition, and was unique in its category as an absinthe substitute, as opposed to a pastis. The Federal Alcohol Control Administration soon objected to Legendre&#x27;s use of the word &quot;absinthe&quot;, so the name was changed to &quot;Legendre &quot;Herbsaint&quot;&quot;, French/Creole for &quot;Herbe Sainte&quot; (Sacred Herb), the &quot;Artemisia absinthium&quot;. 

The Sazerac Company bought J.M. Legendre &amp; Co. in June 1949. Herbsaint was originally bottled at 120 proof, but this was later reduced to 100 proof, then changed to a different 90 proof recipe in the mid-1950s. By the early 1970s only the 90 proof remained. In December 2009, the Sazerac Company reintroduced J.M. Legendre&#x27;s original 100 proof recipe as &quot;Herbsaint Original&quot;.

==Cocktails==

Herbsaint was and still is used in several cocktails, including: 

* Herbsaint frappé
: Pour two ounces of Herbsaint into a thin six-ounce glass.
: Fill the glass three-quarters full with cracked ice.
: Add a half teaspoon of simple syrup or sugar and two ounces of carbonated or plain water, then fill glass with more cracked ice.
: Stir, using a long-handled spoon with up and down motion until outside of glass is well frosted.
: Strain into another glass that has been chilled.
: Remove the ice from the original glass.
: Pour back into the well frosted glass and serve.

It is also sometimes used in the Sazerac cocktail as a substitute for absinthe.

<doc id="258653" wikidata="Q168651" url="?curid=258653" title="Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel">
<text>The Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel (), spelled Hesse-Cassel during its entire existence, also known as the Hessian Palatinate (), was a state of the Holy Roman Empire. The state was created in 1567 when the Landgraviate of Hesse was divided upon the death of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse. His eldest son William IV inherited the northern half of the Landgraviate and the capital of Kassel. The other sons received the Landgraviates of Hesse-Marburg, Hesse-Rheinfels and Hesse-Darmstadt.

During the Napoleonic reorganisation of the Empire in 1803, the Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel was elevated to an Electorate and Landgrave William IX became an Imperial Elector. Many members of the House of Hesse-Kassel served in the Danish military gaining high ranks and power in the realm because many Landgraves were married to Danish princesses. Members of the family who are known to have served Denmark-Norway include Prince Frederik of Hesse-Kassel, Prince Frederick of Hesse-Kassel, and Prince Charles of Hesse-Kassel. It had two votes to the Reichstag: one for itself and one for Hersfeld Abbey.

In 1801, Hesse was forced to cede land to Revolutionary France, but in 1803 it was compensated with land around the former Electorate of Mainz and was elevated to the status of Electorate as the Electorate of Hesse, officially ending the Landgraviate.

== History ==

The Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel was founded by William IV the Wise, the eldest son of Philip I. On his father&#x27;s death in 1567, the Landgraviate of Hesse was divided into four parts. William IV received about half of the territory, with Kassel as his capital. Hesse-Kassel expanded in 1604 when Maurice, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel inherited the Landgraviate of Hesse-Marburg from his childless uncle, Louis IV, Landgrave of Hesse-Marburg (1537–1604).

=== Thirty Years&#x27; War ===

In 1605, Maurice became Calvinist. When the Thirty Years&#x27; War began, on the Protestant side. After being forced to cede some of his territories to Hesse-Darmstadt, Maurice abdicated in 1627 in favour of his son William V. His younger sons received appanages, which created several cadet lines in yet another partition of Hesse. William V allied himself with Gustavus Adolphus of Sweden and then France, losing most of Hesse-Kassel when Imperial troops invaded. He died in exile in 1637, leaving his widow Amalie Elisabeth of Hanau-Münzenberg to act as regent for their eight-year-old son William VI.

Amalie Elisabeth vigorously advanced the interests of Hesse-Kassel. After expelling Imperial troops from Hesse-Kassel, she sent troops to take the city of Marburg, which her father-in-law had lost to their Hesse-Darmstadt relatives. At the Peace of Westphalia in 1648, Hesse-Kassel was further rewarded with most of the County of Schaumburg and the newly secularized Hersfeld Abbey. Amalie Elisabeth also introduced the rule of primogeniture to prevent Hesse-Kassel from being divided again in the future. However, her health was ruined by the stresses of the war, and she died in 1651.

=== 17th and 18th centuries ===

William VI, who came of age in 1650, was an enlightened patron of learning and the arts. He was succeeded by his son William VII, Landgrave of Hesse-Kassel, then an infant, who died in 1670. He was succeeded by his brother Charles I. Charles&#x27; chief claim to fame is that he hired out his soldiers to foreign powers as auxiliaries, as a means of improving the finances of his principality. William V was succeeded by Landgraves William VI and William VII. Frederick I of Sweden, the next landgrave, became by marriage King of Sweden. Although the Landgraviate was in personal union with Sweden from 1730 to 1751, the King&#x27;s younger brother, Prince William, ruled in Kassel as regent until he succeeded his brother as William VIII.

On Frederick I&#x27;s death in 1751, he was succeeded by his brother William VIII, who fought as an ally of Kingdom of Great Britain during the Seven Years&#x27; War. His successor, Frederick II, converted to Catholicism after a long line of Protestant Landgraves. When the American Revolutionary War broke out, Frederick II leased Hessian troops to Great Britain for service in America.

=== End of the landgraviate ===

Hesse fought on the side of Coalition in the War of the First Coalition, against the First French Republic. In 1801, they would cede territories on the west bank of the Rhine to France. Following the reorganization of the German states during the German mediatisation of 1803, the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel gained land and was raised to the Electorate of Hesse and Landgrave William IX was elevated to Imperial Elector, taking the title William I, Elector of Hesse. The principality thus became known as &quot;&quot; (aka &quot;Kurfürstentum Hessen&quot;), although still usually referred to as Hesse-Kassel.

In 1806, William I was dispossessed by Napoleon Bonaparte for his support of the Kingdom of Prussia in the War of the Fourth Coalition. Kassel was designated as the capital of a new Kingdom of Westphalia, where Napoleon appointed his brother Jérôme Bonaparte as king. Following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat in 1813, the elector was restored. At the Congress of Vienna, a number of Napoleonic electorates were elevated to kingdoms, and William tried to secure recognition as King of the Chatti. However, he was rebuffed by the Great Powers, who listed him as a &quot;Royal Highness&quot; along with the other grand dukes. To secure his pre-eminence over his cousin, the Grand Duke of Hesse in the former Hesse-Darmstadt, William chose to keep his title of Prince-Elector. The rulers of the Electorate of Hesse became the only Prince-Electors in the German Confederation, even though there was no longer a Holy Roman Emperor for them to elect.

== Hessian troops in foreign service ==

The Landgraves of Hesse-Kassel were famous for renting out their army to other European nations during the 17th and 18th centuries. It was a widespread practice at the time for small countries to rent out troops to larger countries in exchange for subsidies. International jurists drew a distinction between mercenaries and auxiliaries. Mercenaries served in foreign armies as individuals, while auxiliaries were sent by their ruler to the aid of another ruler.

Hesse-Kassel took the practice to an extreme, maintaining 5.3% to 7.3% of its population under arms in peacetime in its history, however was known to double that in times of war. This was a higher proportion than even Prussia, a country that was so heavily militarized that it was described as &quot;not a country with an army, but an army with a country&quot;. The Hessian army served as a readily available reserve for other European nations. During the American Revolutionary War, the Kingdom of Great Britain rented thousands of German troops to fight in the Thirteen Colonies, half of whom came from Hesse-Kassel and nearby Hesse-Hanau. Due to this, American colonists in the colonies referred to all German troops serving with the British with the synecdoche &quot;Hessian&quot;.

== Namesakes ==

The village of Hessen Cassel, Indiana, near Fort Wayne, founded by German immigrants, is named for the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel.

<text>Turkmen (, , , or , , , ) is a Turkic language of the Oghuz branch spoken by the Turkmens of Central Asia. It has an estimated 4.3 million native speakers in Turkmenistan (where it is the official language), and a further 719,000 speakers in northeastern Iran and 1.5 million people in northwestern Afghanistan, where it has no official status. Turkmen is also spoken to lesser varying degrees in Turkmen communities of Uzbekistan and Tajikistan and by diaspora communities, primarily in Turkey and Russia.

Turkmen is a member of the Oghuz branch of the Turkic languages. It is closely related to Azerbaijani, Crimean Tatar, Gagauz, Qashqai, and Turkish, sharing varying degrees of mutual intelligibility with each of those languages. However, the closest relative of Turkmen is considered Khorasani Turkic, spoken in northeastern regions of Iran and with which it shares the eastern subbranch of Oghuz languages, as well as Khorazm, the Oghuz dialect of Uzbek spoken mainly in Khorezm along the Turkmenistan border. Elsewhere in Iran, the Turkmen language comes second after the Azerbaijani language in terms of the number of speakers of Turkic languages of Iran.

The standardized form of Turkmen (spoken in Turkmenistan) is based on the Teke dialect, while Iranian Turkmen use mostly the Yomud dialect, and Afghan Turkmen use the Ersary variety. The Turkmen language, unlike other languages of the Oghuz branch, preserved most of the unique and archaic features of the language spoken by the early Oghuz Turks, including phonemic vowel length.

Iraqi and Syrian &quot;Turkmen&quot; speak dialects that form a continuum between Turkish and Azerbaijani, in both cases heavily influenced by Arabic and Persian. These varieties are not Turkmen in the sense of this article.

== Classification ==
Turkmen is a member of the Oghuz branch of the Turkic family of languages, together with Turkish and Azerbaijani, with which it shares a relatively high degree of mutual intelligibility. However, an arguably closer language to Turkmen is Khorasani Turkic, with which it shares the eastern subbranch of the Oghuz languages, and also Khorazm, spoken mainly in northwestern Uzbekistan.

Turkmen has vowel harmony, is agglutinative and has no grammatical gender. Word order is subject–object–verb.

Written Turkmen today is based on the Teke (Tekke) dialect. The other dialects are Nohurly, , , Hasarly, Nerezim, , Salyr, Saryk, and . The Teke dialect is sometimes (especially in Afghanistan) referred to as &quot;Chagatai&quot;, but like all Turkmen dialects it reflects only a limited influence from classical Chagatai.

== Comparison with other Turkic languages ==
Turkmen has dental fricatives and unlike other Oghuz Turkic languages, where these sounds are pronounced as and . The only other Turkic language with a similar feature is Bashkir. However, in Bashkir and are two independent phonemes, distinct from and , whereas in Turkmen and are the two main realizations of the common Turkic and . In other words, there are no and phonemes in Turkmen, unlike Bashkir, which has , , and .

=== Turkmen vs. Azerbaijani ===
The 1st person personal pronoun is &quot;men&quot; in Turkmen, just as in Azerbaijani, whereas it is &quot;ben&quot; in Turkish. The same is true for demonstrative pronouns &quot;bu&quot;, where sound &quot;b&quot; is replaced with sound &quot;m&quot;. For example: . In Turkmen, &quot;bu&quot; undergoes some changes just as in: .

Here are some words with a different pronunciation in Turkmen and Azerbaijani that mean the same in both languages:
=== Turkmen vs. Turkish ===
Turkey was first to recognize Turkmenistan&#x27;s independence on 27 October 1991, following the Dissolution of the Soviet Union and to open its embassy in Ashgabat on 29 February 1992. Sharing a common history, religion, language and culture, the two states have balanced special relations based on mutual respect and the principle of &quot;One Nation, Two States&quot;.

Turkmen language is very close to Turkish with regard to linguistic properties. However, there are a couple of differences due to regional and historical reasons. Most morphophonetic rules are common in Turkmen and Turkish languages. For instance, both languages show vowel harmony and consonant mutation rules, and have similar suffixes with very close semantics.

Here are some words from the Swadesh list in Turkmen and Turkish that mean the same in both languages:

==Phonology==

== Writing system ==

Turkmen written language was formed in the 13–14th centuries. During this period, the Arabic alphabet was used extensively for writing. By in the 18th century, there had been a rich literary tradition in the Turkmen language. At the same time, the literacy of the population in their native language remained at low levels; book publishing was extremely limited, and the first primer in the Turkmen language appeared only in 1913, while the first newspaper (&quot;Transcaspian native newspaper&quot;) was printed in 1914.

The Arabic script was not adapted to the phonetic features of the Turkic languages. Thus, it did not have necessary signs to designate specific sounds of the Turkmen language, and at the same time there were many letters to designate Arabic sounds that were not in the Turkmen language.

During the first years after the establishment of the Soviet power, the Arabic alphabet of Turkmen under the USSR was reformed twice, in 1922 and 1925. In the course of the reforms, letters with diacritics were introduced to denote Turkic phonemes; and letters were abolished for sounds that are absent in the Turkmen language.

The Turkmens of Afghanistan and Iran continue to use Arabic script.

In January 1925, on the pages of the republican newspaper , the question of switching to a new, Latin alphabet was raised. After the first All-Union Turkological Congress in Baku (February–March 1926), the State Academic Council under the People&#x27;s Commissariat of Education of the Turkmen SSR developed a draft of a new alphabet. On 3 January 1928, the revised new Latin alphabet was approved by the Central Executive Committee of the Turkmen SSR.

At the end of the 1930s, the process of the Cyrillization of writing began throughout the USSR. In January 1939, the newspaper &quot;Sowet Türkmenistany&quot; published a letter from teachers in Ashgabat and the Ashgabat region with an initiative to replace the Turkmen (Latin) script with Cyrillic. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Turkmen SSR instructed the Research Institute of Language and Literature to draw up a draft of a new alphabet. The teachers of the Ashgabat Pedagogical Institute and print workers also took part in the development of the new writing system. In April 1940, the draft alphabet was published.

In May 1940, the Council of People&#x27;s Commissars of the Turkmen SSR adopted a resolution on the transition to a new alphabet of all state and public institutions from 1 July 1940, and on the beginning of teaching the new alphabet in schools from 1 September of the same year.

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, in January 1993, a meeting was held at the Academy of Sciences of Turkmenistan on the issue of replacing the Cyrillic with the Latin alphabet, at which a commission was formed to develop the alphabet. In February, a new version of the alphabet was published in the press. On 12 April 1993, the Mejlis of Turkmenistan approved a presidential decree on the new alphabet.

== Grammar ==

Turkmen is a highly agglutinative language, in that much of the grammar is expressed by means of suffixes added to nouns and verbs. It is very regular compared with many other languages of non-Turkic group. For example, &quot;from the villages&quot; can be analysed as &quot;village&quot;, -lar (plural suffix), -dan (ablative case, meaning &quot;from&quot;); &quot;I am taking&quot; as &quot;al&quot; &quot;take&quot;, (present continuous tense), &quot;-yn&quot; (1st person singular).

Another characteristic of Turkmen is vowel harmony. Most suffixes have two or four different forms, the choice between which depends on the vowel of the word&#x27;s root or the preceding suffix: For example, the ablative case of is &quot;from the villages&quot; but, the ablative case of &quot;dogs&quot; is &quot;from the dogs&quot;.

=== Directives and speech levels ===
Levels of respect or formality are focused on the final suffix of commands, while in normal sentences adding -dyr can increase formality.
==Literature==
Turkmen literature comprises oral compositions and written texts in Old Oghuz Turkic and Turkmen languages. Turkmens are direct descendants of the Oghuz Turks, who were a western Turkic people that spoke the Oghuz branch of the Turkic language family.

The earliest development of the Turkmen literature is closely associated with the literature of the Oghuz Turks.
Turkmens have joint claims to a great number of literary works written in Old Oghuz and Persian (by Seljuks in 11-12th centuries) languages with other people of the Oghuz Turkic origin, mainly of Azerbaijan and Turkey. These works include, but are not limited to the Book of Dede Korkut, Zöhre Tahyr, Gorogly, Layla and Majnun, Yusuf Zulaikha and others.

There is general consensus, however, that distinctively modern Turkmen literature originated in the 18th century with the poetry of Magtymguly Pyragy, who is considered the father of the Turkmen literature. Other prominent Turkmen poets of that era are (Magtymguly&#x27;s father), Mollanepes, Nurmuhammet Andalyp, Mämmetweli Kemine, , , and Gurbanally Magrupy.

== Vocabulary ==

=== Numbers ===

Note: Numbers are formed identically to other Turkic languages, such as Turkish. So, eleven (11) is &quot;on bir&quot; (). Two thousand seventeen (2017) is (two-thousand-ten-seven).

=== Colors ===

=== Basic expressions ===
==Example==
The following is Magtymguly&#x27;s (of the Turkmen) poem with the text transliterated into Turkmen (Latin) letters, whereas the original language is preserved. Second column is the poem&#x27;s Turkish translation, third one is the Azerbaijani translation, while the last one is the English translation. 
==Turkmen in Iran==

Irani Turkmens speak a dialect of Turkmen in the province of Golestan. It is mutually intelligible with the Turkmen dialects in Afghanistan, and is written in the Nastaliq script.

<doc id="258657" wikidata="Q16976" url="?curid=258657" title="Pastis">
<text>Pastis (, , ; ) is an anise-flavoured spirit and apéritif traditionally from France, typically containing less than 100 g/L sugar and 40–45% ABV (alcohol by volume).

==Origins==
Pastis was first commercialized by Paul Ricard in 1932 and enjoys substantial popularity in France, especially in the southeastern regions of the country, mostly Marseille, (Bouches-du-Rhône) and the Var department. Pastis emerged some 17 years after the ban on absinthe, during a time when the French nation was still apprehensive of high-proof anise drinks in the wake of the absinthe debacle. The popularity of pastis may be attributable to a penchant for anise drinks that was cultivated by absinthe decades earlier, but is also part of an old tradition of Mediterranean anise liquors that includes sambuca, ouzo, arak, rakı, and mastika. The name &quot;pastis&quot; comes from Occitan &quot;&quot;pastís&quot;,&quot; a mash-up or blend.

==Composition==
By legal definition, pastis is described as an anise-flavoured spirit that contains additional flavor of liquorice root, contains less than 100 grams per litre of sugar, and is bottled at a minimum of 40% ABV (&quot;pastis&quot;) or 45% ABV (&quot;pastis de Marseille&quot;). While pastis was originally artisanally produced from whole herbs like most spirits at the time of its creation, modern versions are typically prepared by mixing base alcohol with commercially prepared flavorings (essences and/or extracts) and caramel coloring.

Pastis is often compared with its historical predecessor, absinthe, yet the two are quite different. Pastis was created years following the prohibition of absinthe, and traditionally does not contain grand wormwood (&quot;Artemisia absinthium&quot;), the herb from which absinthe derives its name. Also, pastis far more commonly obtains its anise flavour from star anise, an Asian spice, whereas absinthe traditionally obtains its base flavour from a distillation of green anise and fennel, both Mediterranean herbs. Additionally, pastis typically exhibits some degree of flavour derived from liquorice root, which is not traditionally employed for absinthe. Where bottled strength is concerned, traditional absinthes were bottled at 45–74% ABV, while pastis is typically bottled at 40–50% ABV. Finally, whereas traditional absinthe is invariably a dry spirit, pastis may be bottled with sugar.

==Serving==

Pastis is normally diluted with water before drinking, generally five volumes of water for one volume of pastis, but often neat pastis is served together with a jug of water for the drinker to blend together according to preference. The resulting decrease in alcohol percentage causes some of the constituents to become insoluble, which changes the liqueur&#x27;s appearance from dark transparent yellow to milky soft yellow, a phenomenon also present with absinthe and known as louche or the ouzo effect. The drink is consumed cold and considered a refreshment for hot days. Ice cubes can be added (after the water, to avoid crystallization of the anethole in the pastis). Many pastis drinkers decline to add ice, preferring to drink the beverage with cool spring water.

Although consumed throughout France, pastis is generally associated with southeastern regions of the country, particularly the city of Marseille, where it is nicknamed &quot;Pastaga&quot;, and with such clichés of the Provençal lifestyle as pétanque.

130 million litres are sold each year (more than two litres per inhabitant in France).

==Chemistry==
Pastis beverages become cloudy when diluted because they are anise-based. Such beverages contain oils called terpenes, which are soluble in an aqueous solution that contains 30% ethanol or more by volume. When the solution is diluted to below 30% ethanol, the terpenes become insoluble; this causes a dispersion of oil droplets to form in the solution, giving the liquid a cloudy appearance. The same chemistry causes absinthe to become cloudy when diluted.

<doc id="258659" wikidata="Q548940" url="?curid=258659" title="Anisette">
<text>Anisette, or Anis, is an anise-flavored liqueur that is consumed in most Mediterranean countries. It is colorless and, because it contains sugar, is sweeter than dry anise flavoured spirits (e.g. absinthe). The most traditional style of anisette is that produced by means of distilling aniseed, and is differentiated from those produced by simple maceration by the inclusion of the word &quot;distilled&quot; on the label. 

The liqueur is often mixed with water or poured over ice cubes because of its strong flavour.

== Variations ==
Pastis is a similar-tasting liqueur that is prepared in similar fashion and sometimes confused with anisette. It employs a combination of both aniseed and licorice root extracts. Sambuca is essentially an anisette of Italian origin that requires a high minimum (350g/L) sugar content.

==Geographical spread==

===Mediterranean===

In the Mediterranean Basin, anise-based or liquorice-based spirits include:
* Spain: Anís del Mono (&quot;the monkey&#x27;s anisette&quot;) has been produced since 1870. The label, with a monkey holding a scroll and a bottle, was designed by Ramon Casas i Carbó. It is the anisette of choice in Malcolm Lowry&#x27;s &quot;Under the Volcano&quot;. Characters in Ernest Hemingway&#x27;s novel &quot;The Sun Also Rises&quot; and his short story &quot;Hills Like White Elephants&quot; drink and discuss Anís del Toro – &quot;Bull&#x27;s Anisette.&quot; Another type, &quot;Aguardiente de Ojén&quot; (es), gained fame abroad and is popular in New Orleans, Louisiana, especially during the Mardi Gras festivities.
* France: Anisette, made by Marie Brizard since 1755 and Pastis, made by Paul Ricard since 1932
* Greece: Ouzo
* Malta: Anisetta (&quot;Żambur&quot;), made with anise and herbs.
* Italy: Sambuca
* Portugal: Licor Aniz Escarchado (crystallized)
* Turkey, Azerbaijan, Armenia, and Albania: Rakı
* Lebanon, Syria, Palestine, Israel, Jordan, and Egypt: Arak
* Algeria: Anisette Cristal

===Latin America===
Anise-flavoured alcohols from other parts of the world include Aguardiente from Colombia and Mexico.

===Philippines===
Anise liqueur was also introduced to the Philippines by the Spanish, which developed into the local &quot;anisado&quot;, an anise-flavored liqueur usually made from distilled sugarcane wine. A notable variant of Filipino &quot;anisado&quot; with sugar is known as &quot;anisado Mallorca&quot;, or simply &quot;Mallorca&quot;. They are commonly used as ingredients in Filipino cuisine.

<doc id="258666" wikidata="Q1124286" url="?curid=258666" title="Polyuria">
<text>Polyuria () is excessive or an abnormally large production or passage of urine (greater than 2.5 L or 3 L over 24 hours in adults). Increased production and passage of urine may also be termed as diuresis. Polyuria often appears in conjunction with polydipsia (increased thirst), though it is possible to have one without the other, and the latter may be a cause or an effect. Primary polydipsia may lead to polyuria. Polyuria is usually viewed as a symptom or sign of another disorder (not a disease by itself), but it can be classed as a disorder, at least when its underlying causes are not clear.

==Causes==
The most common cause of polyuria in both adults and children is uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, which causes osmotic diuresis; when glucose levels are so high that glucose is excreted in the urine. Water follows the glucose concentration passively, leading to abnormally high urine output.

In the absence of diabetes mellitus, the most common causes are the decreased secretion of aldosterone due to adrenal cortical tumor, primary polydipsia (excessive fluid drinking), central diabetes insipidus, and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Polyuria may also be due to various chemical substances, such as diuretics, caffeine, and ethanol. It may also occur after supraventricular tachycardias, during an onset of atrial fibrillation, childbirth, and the removal of an obstruction within the urinary tract. Diuresis is controlled by antidiuretics such as vasopressin, angiotensin II and aldosterone. &quot;Cold diuresis&quot; is the occurrence of increased urine production upon exposure to cold, which also partially explains immersion diuresis. &quot;High-altitude diuresis&quot; occurs at altitudes above and is a desirable indicator of adaptation to high altitudes. Mountaineers who are adapting well to high altitudes experience this type of diuresis. People who produce less urine even in the presence of adequate fluid intake are probably not adapting well to high altitudes.

===List of causes===


==Mechanism==
Polyuria, in osmotic cases, increases flow amount in the distal nephron where flow rates and velocity are low. The significant pressure increase occurring in the distal nephron takes place particularly in the cortical-collecting ducts. One study from 2008 laid out a hypothesis that hyperglycaemic and osmotic polyuria play roles ultimately in diabetic nephropathy.

==Diagnosis==
Among the possible tests to diagnose polyuria are:
==Treatment==
Depending on the cause of the polyuria, the adequate treatment should be afforded. According to NICE, desmopressin can be considered for nocturnal polyuria, which can be caused by diabetes mellitus, if other medical treatments have failed. The recommendation had no studies that met the criteria for consideration.

<doc id="258669" wikidata="Q1133363" url="?curid=258669" title="Samudragupta">
<text>Samudragupta (Gupta script: &quot;Sa-mu-dra-gu-pta&quot;, (c. 335–375 CE) was the second emperor of the Gupta Empire of ancient India, and is regarded among the greatest rulers of India. As a son of the Gupta emperor Chandragupta I and the Licchavi princess Kumaradevi, he greatly expanded his dynasty&#x27;s political and military power.

The Allahabad Pillar inscription, a &quot;prashasti&quot; (eulogy) composed by his courtier Harisena, credits him with extensive military conquests. It suggests that he defeated several kings of northern India, and annexed their territories into his empire. He also marched along the south-eastern coast of India, advancing as far south as Kanchipuram in the Pallava kingdom. In addition, he subjugated several frontier kingdoms and tribal oligarchies. At the height of his power, his empire under his direct control extended from Ravi River in the west (present-day Punjab) to the Brahmaputra River in the east (present-day Assam), and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to central India in the south-west; several rulers along the south-eastern coast were also his tributaries. The inscription also states that many neighbouring rulers tried to please him, which probably refers to his friendly relations with them.

He performed the Ashvamedha sacrifice to prove his imperial sovereignty and remained undefeated in battle. His gold coins and inscriptions suggest that he was an accomplished poet, and also played musical instruments such as the veena. His expansionist policy was continued by his son and successor Chandragupta II.

== Period ==

Modern scholars variously assign the start of Samudragupta&#x27;s reign from c. 319 CE to c. 350 CE.

The inscriptions of the Gupta kings are dated in the Gupta calendar era, whose epoch is generally dated to c. 319 CE. However, the identity of the era&#x27;s founder is a matter of debate, and scholars variously attribute its establishment to Chandragupta I or Samudragupta. Chandragupta I probably had a long reign, as the Prayag Pillar inscription suggests that he appointed his son as his successor, presumably after reaching an old age. However, the exact period of his reign is uncertain. For these reasons, the beginning of Samudragupta&#x27;s reign is also uncertain.

If Samudragupta is regarded as the founder of the Gupta era, his ascension can be dated to c. 319–320 CE. On the other hand, if his father Chandragupta I is regarded as the founder of the Gupta era, Samudragupta&#x27;s ascension must be dated to a later date. Samudragupta was a contemporary of King Meghavarna of Anuradhapura Kingdom, but the regnal period of this king is also uncertain. According to the traditional reckoning adopted in Sri Lanka for Buddha&#x27;s death, he ruled during 304–332 CE; but the modified chronology adopted by modern scholars such as Wilhelm Geiger assigns his reign to 352–379 CE. Accepting the former date would place Samudragupta&#x27;s ascension to c. 320 CE; accepting the latter date would place it around c. 350 CE.

The end of Samudragupta&#x27;s reign is also uncertain. Samudragupta&#x27;s granddaughter Prabhavatigupta is known to have married during the reign of his son Chandragupta II, in c. 380 CE (assuming c. 319 CE as the epoch of the Gupta era). Therefore, the end of Samudragupta&#x27;s reign can be placed before this year.

Various estimates of Samudragupta&#x27;s regnal period include:

* A. S. Altekar: c. 330–370 CE
* A. L. Basham: c. 335–376 CE
* S. R. Goyal: c. 350–375 CE
* Tej Ram Sharma: c. 353–373 CE

== Ascension ==

Samudragupta was a son of the Gupta emperor Chandragupta I and Queen Kumaradevi, who came from the Licchavi clan. His fragmentary Eran stone inscription states that his father selected him as the successor because of his &quot;devotion, righteous conduct, and valour&quot;. His Allahabad Pillar inscription similarly describes how Chandragupta I called him a noble person in front of the courtiers, and appointed him to &quot;protect the earth&quot;. These descriptions suggest that Chandragupta I renounced the throne in his old age, and appointed his son as the next emperor.

According to the Allahabad Pillar inscription, when Chandragupta I appointed him as the next emperor, the faces of other people of &quot;equal birth&quot; bore a &quot;melancholy look&quot;. One interpretation suggests that these other people were neighbouring kings, and Samudagupta&#x27;s ascension to the throne was uncontested. Another theory is that these other people were Gupta princes with a rival claim to the throne. If Emperor Chandragputa I indeed had multiple sons, it is likely that Samudragupta&#x27;s background as the son of a Lichchhavi princess worked in his favour.

The coins of a Gupta ruler named Kacha, whose identity is debated by modern scholars, describe him as &quot;the exterminator of all kings&quot;. These coins closely resemble the coins issued by Samudragupta. According to one theory, Kacha was an earlier name of Samudragupta and the emperor later adopted the regnal name Samudra (&quot;Ocean&quot;), after extending his empire&#x27;s dominion as far as the ocean. An alternative theory is that Kacha was a distinct king (possibly a rival claimant to the throne) who flourished before or after Samudragupta.

== Military campaigns &amp; territorial expansion ==

The Gupta inscriptions suggest that Samudragupta had a remarkable military career. The Eran stone inscription of Samudragupta states that he had brought &quot;the whole tribe of kings&quot; under his suzerainty, and that his enemies were terrified when they thought of him in their dreams. The inscription does not name any of the defeated kings (presumably because its primary objective was to record the installation of a Vishnu idol in a temple), but it suggests that Samudragupta had subdued several kings by this time. The later Allahabad Pillar inscription, a panegyric written by Samudragupta&#x27;s minister and military officer Harishena, credits him with extensive conquests. It gives the most detailed account of Samudragupta&#x27;s military conquests, listing them in mainly geographical and partly chronological order. It states that Samudragupta fought a hundred battles, acquired a hundred wounds that looked like marks of glory, and earned the title &quot;Prakrama&quot; (valourous). The Mathura stone inscription of Chandragupta II describes Samudragupta as an &quot;exterminator of all kings&quot;, as someone who had no equally powerful enemy, and as a person whose &quot;fame was tasted by the waters of the four oceans&quot;. 

Modern scholars offer various opinions regarding Samudragupta&#x27;s possible motivations behind his extensive military campaigns. The Allahabad Pillar inscription suggests that Samudragupta&#x27;s aim was the unification of the earth (&quot;dharani-bandha&quot;), which suggests that he may have aspired to become a Chakravartin (a universal ruler). The Ashvamedha performances by the Nagas, whom he defeated, may have influenced him as well. His southern expedition may have been motivated by economic considerations of controlling the trade between India and South-East Asia.

=== Early victories ===

The early portion of the Allahabad Pillar inscription mentions that Samudragupta &quot;uprooted&quot; Achyuta, Nagasena, and a ruler whose name is lost in the damaged portion of the inscription. The third name ends in &quot;-ga&quot;, and is generally restored as Ganapati-naga, because Achyuta-nandin (presumably same as Achyuta), Nagasena, and Ganapati-naga are once again mentioned in the later part of the inscription, among the kings of Aryavarta (northern India) defeated by Samudragupta. These kings are identified as the rulers of present-day western Uttar Pradesh (see below). According to the inscription, Samudragupta reinstated these rulers after they sought his forgiveness.

It is not clear why the names of these three kings is repeated later in the inscription. According to one theory, these three kings were vassal rulers who rebelled against Samudragupta after the death of his father. Samudragupta crushed the rebellion, and reinstated them after they sought his forgiveness. Later, these rulers rebelled once more, and Samudragupta defeated them again. Another possibility is that the author of the inscription thought it necessary to repeat these names while describing Samudragupta&#x27;s later conquests in Aryavarta, simply because these kings belonged to that region.

Samudragupta dispatched an army to capture the scion of the Kota family, whose identity is uncertain. The Kotas may have been the rulers of present-day Punjab, where coins bearing the legend &quot;Kota&quot;, and featuring a symbol of Shiva and his bull, have been discovered.

The inscription states that the Gupta army captured the Kota ruler, while Samudragupta himself &quot;played&quot; (or pleased himself) in a city called Pushpa (the name Pushpa-pura referred to Pataliputra at Samudragupta&#x27;s time, although it came to be used for Kanyakubja in the later period). Modern scholars have interpreted the word &quot;played&quot; in various ways: According to one theory, this portion describes Samudragupta&#x27;s achievements as a prince. An alternative interpretation is that Samudragupta dispatched his army on these campaigns, while he himself stayed at the capital. It is also possible that the poet intended to convey that these campaigns were minor affairs that did not require the king&#x27;s direct involvement at the battlefront.

=== Southern conquests ===

According to the Allahabad Pillar inscription, Samudragupta captured (and later released) the following kings of Dakshinapatha, the southern region:

The exact identification of several of these kings is debated among modern scholars, but it is clear that these kings ruled areas located on the eastern coast of India. Samudragupta most probably passed through the forest tract of central India, reached the eastern coast in present-day Odisha, and then marched south along the coast of Bay of Bengal.

The inscription states that Samudragupta later released these kings, and favoured (&quot;anugraha&quot;) them. Most modern scholars theorize that Samudragupta reinstated these rulers as his tributaries. M. G. S. Narayanan interprets the word &quot;anugraha&quot; differently based on its occurrence in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;; he theorizes that Samudragupta gave &quot;protection and aid&quot; to these kingdoms in order to secure their alliances.

Some scholars, such as J. Dubreuil and B. V. Krishnarao, theorized that Samudragupta only advanced up to the Krishna River, and was forced to retreat without fighting a battle, when the southern kings formed a strong confederacy to oppose him. According to these scholars, the claim that Samudragupta released these kings is an attempt by Samudragupta&#x27;s courtier to cover up the emperor&#x27;s failure. However, there is no evidence of the southern kings forming a confederacy against Samudragupta. Historian Ashvini Agrawal notes that setting free a captured king is inline with the ancient Indian political ideals. For example, Kautilya defines three types of conquerors: the righteous conqueror (&quot;dharma-vijayi&quot;), who restores the defeated king in exchange for his acknowledgment of the conqueror&#x27;s suzerainty; the covetous conqueror (&quot;lobha-vijayi&quot;), who takes away the possessions of the defeated king but spares his life; and the demoniac conqueror (&quot;asura-vijayi&quot;), who annexes the territory of the defeated king and kills him. Such political ideals existed in the Gupta period too, as evident from Kalidasa&#x27;s statement in &quot;Raghuvamsha&quot; that &quot;the righteous victorious monarch (Raghu) only took away the royal glory of the lord of Mahendra who had been captured and released, but not his kingdom.&quot; Therefore, it is likely that Samudragupta acted like a righteous conqueror, and restored the defeated kings as his vassals.

; Mahendra of Kosala
: Kosala here refers to Dakshina Kosala, which includes parts of present-day Chhattisgarh and Odisha. One theory identifies Mahendra of Kosala with a Nala king named Mahendraditya.

; Vyaghra-raja of Mahakantara
: Historian K. P. Jayaswal identifies Mahakantara (literally &quot;great wilderness&quot;) as the Bastar-Kanker area in present-day Chhattisgarh. According to another theory, Mahakantara is same as Mahavana, a synonym used as the name for the forest region around present-day Jeypore of Odisha.
: Earlier historians identified Mahakantara as a region in central India, and identified Vyaghra-raja with the Vakataka feudatory Vyaghra-deva, whose inscriptions have been found at Nachna. However, this identification is now considered incorrect, as Samudragupta is not known to have fought against the Vakatakas.

; Mantaraja of Kurala
: The Rawan inscription of the Sharabhapuriya king Narendra, who ruled in the Dakshina Kosala region, mentions an area called Mantaraja-bhukti (&quot;the province of Mantaraja&quot;). Therefore, some historians such as K. D. Bajpai theorize that Mantaraja was a king who ruled in the Dakshina Kosala region. Historian A. M. Shastri disputes this theory, arguing that the ruler of Kosala (that is, Dakshina Kosala) has been mentioned separately in the Allahabad Pillar inscription.
: Lorenz Franz Kielhorn speculated that Kurala was same as Kaurala (or Kunala) mentioned in the Aihole inscription of the 7th century king Pulakeshin II, and identified it as the area around the Kolleru Lake in present-day Andhra Pradesh. H. C. Raychaudhuri disputes this identification, pointing out that this region was a part of Hastivarman&#x27;s Vengi kingdom, which has been mentioned separately in the Allahabad Pillar inscription.
: Other proposed identifications of Kurala include Kolada near Bhanjanagar (former Russelkonda) in Odisha; and Kulula, a region mentioned in the Mahendragiri inscription of the 11th century king Rajendra Chola, and identified with Cherla in present-day Telangana.

; Mahendragiri of Pishtapura
: Pishtapura is modern Pithapuram in Andhra Pradesh. The word &quot;giri&quot; mentions hill in Sanskrit, and therefore, J. F. Fleet speculated that &quot;Mahendragiri&quot; could not have been a person&#x27;s name: he suggested that the verse (&quot;Mahendragiri-Kautturaka-Svamidatta&quot;) referred to a king called &quot;Mahendra&quot;, and a place called &quot;Kottura on the hill&quot; which was ruled by Svamidatta. However, Fleet&#x27;s translation is incorrect: the verse clearly mentions Mahendragiri of Pishtapura and Svamidatta of Kottura as two distinct persons. G. Ramdas interpreted the verse to mean Svamidatta was the ruler of Pishtapura and &quot;Kottura near Mahendragiri&quot;, while Bhau Daji translated it as &quot;Svamidatta of Pishtapura, Mahendragiri and Kottura&quot;. However, these translations are also incorrect. The concern about the king&#x27;s name is invalid: several historical records mention names ending in the word &quot;giri&quot; or its synonym &quot;adri&quot;.

; Svamidatta of Kottura
: Svamidatta was probably one of the chiefs who resisted Samudragupta&#x27;s passage through the Kalinga region. Kottura has been identified with modern Kotturu (or Kothur) in Srikakulam district, Andhra Pradesh (near Paralakhemundi, Odisha). Alternative proposals identify it with other similarly named places in present-day Andhra Pradesh.

; Damana of Erandapalla
: Proposed identifications of Erandapalla include Errandapali near Srikakulam, a town near Mukhalingam, Yendipalli in Visakhapatnam district, and Endipalli in West Godavari district.

; Vishnugopa of Kanchi
: Vishnugopa is identified as the Pallava ruler of Kanchipuram: Samudragupta&#x27;s invasion probably occurred when he acted as a regent for his nephew Skandavarman III.

; Nilaraja of Avamukta
: The identity of Avamukta is uncertain. The &quot;Brahmanda Purana&quot; mentions an area called &quot;Avimukta-kshetra&quot;, located on the banks of the Gautami river (that is, Godavari), which may be identified with Avamukta of Samudragupta&#x27;s inscription. Some historical texts use the name Avamukta-kshetra for the region around Varanasi, but Varanasi is not located in Dakshinapatha, and therefore, was certainly not the Avamukta mentioned in the inscription.

; Hastivarman of Vengi
: Hastivarman was the Shalankayana king of Vengi (modern Pedavegi) in Andhra Pradesh.

; Ugrasena of Palakka
: J. Dubreuil identified Palakka with the place referred to as Palakkada in several Pallava inscriptions; this location was probably the headquarters of a Pallava viceroyalty. For example, the Uruvapalli grant inscription of &quot;Yuva-maharaja&quot; (Prince) Vishnugopa-varman was issued from Palakkada.
: G. Ramdas identified it with Pakkai located between Udayagiri and Venkatagiri in the Nellore district, and theorized that it was same as the place referred to as Paka-nadu, Panka-nadu, or Pakai-nadu in the inscriptions of the 10th century Chola king Rajaraja I.

; Kubera of Devarashtra
: According to one theory, Deva-rashtra was located in the historical Kalinga region of present-day northern Andhra Pradesh. The Srungavarapukota inscription of the Vasishtha king Anantavarman, issued from Pishtapura in this area, describes his grandfather Gunavarman as &quot;Deva-rashtradhipati&quot; (&quot;Lord of Deva-rashtra&quot;). The Kasimkota inscription of the 10th century Vengi Chalukya king Bhima I mentions a &quot;vishaya&quot; (district) called Deva-rashtra in Kalinga. Based on this, J. Dubreuil identified Devarashtra as a location in the present-day Yelamanchili taluka of Andhra Pradesh. During Samudragupta&#x27;s period, the Kalinga region appears to have been divided among several small kingdoms, which may have included Kottura, Pishtapura, and Devarashtra.

; Dhananjaya of Kusthalapura
: B. V. Krishnarao speculated that Dhananjaya of Samudragupta&#x27;s inscription may be same as the Dhananjaya from whom the chieftains of Dhanyakataka (modern Dharanikota in Andhra Pradesh) claimed descent. He identified Kusthalapura with modern Kolanupaka (or Kollipak) located on the banks of the Aleru River in present-day Telangana. Another theory identifies Kusthalapura with a tract around the Kushasthali River near Dakshina Kosala.

=== Northern conquests ===

According to the Allahabad Pillar inscription, Samudragupta &quot;forcibly uprooted&quot; the following kings of Aryavarta, the northern region:

Unlike the southern kings, the inscription does not mention the territories ruled by these kings, which suggests that their kingdoms were annexed to the Gupta empire. The inscription also mentions that Samudragupta defeated some other kings, but does not mention their names, presumably because the poet saw them as unimportant.

; Rudradeva
: Rudradeva may be same as a king named Rudra, whose coin has been found at Kaushambi. Another theory identifies Rudradeva with a Western Kshatrapa (Shaka) king of Ujjain, either Rudradaman II or Rudrasena III.
: Some earlier scholars, such as K. N. Dikshit and K. P. Jayaswal, identified Rudradeva with the Vakataka king Rudrasena I. However, this identification seems to be inaccurate, because Samudragupta&#x27;s inscription explicitly mentions Rudradeva as a king of the northern region (Aryavarta), while the Vakatakas ruled in the southern region (Dakshinapatha). An argument cited in support of this identification is that Rudrasena bore the title &quot;Maharaja&quot; (&quot;great king&quot;) as opposed to &quot;samrat&quot; (&quot;emperor&quot;), signifying his subordinate status to Samudragupta. However, multiple sovereign Vakataka kings bore the title &quot;Maharaja&quot;: only Pravarasena I assumed the title &quot;samrat&quot; after performing a &quot;vajapeya&quot; ritual sacrifice. An inscription of Rudrasena&#x27;s descendant Prithvishena II mentions that the Vakataka kingdom had been prospering for a hundred years, suggesting that the Vakataka rule remained uninterrupted during Rudrasena&#x27;s reign.

; Matila
: The identity of Matila is not certain. Earlier, Matila was identified with Mattila, who is known from a terracotta seal discovered at Bulandshahr. However, there is no evidence that this Mattila was a ruler, and epigraphist Jagannath Agrawal has dated the seal to the 6th century on palaeographic basis.

; Nagadatta
: Nagadatta is not known from any other inscriptions or coins, but his name has led to suggestions that he may have been the ruler of a Naga branch. D. C. Sircar theorized that he was an ancestor of a family of Gupta viceroys, whose names ended in -datta. Tej Ram Sharma speculates that he may have been a Naga ruler, whose successors were sent as Gupta viceroys in Bengal after the family accepted the Gupta suzerainty.

; Chandravarman
: Chandravarman of Samudragupta&#x27;s inscription has been identified with Chandravarman, the ruler of Pushkarana (modern Pakhanna) in present-day West Bengal. P. L. Gupta and some earlier scholars have identified this ruler with another Chandravarman, who has been mentioned in an inscription discovered at Mandsaur in present-day Madhya Pradesh. Tej Ram Sharma disputes this identification, arguing that Samudragupta &quot;exterminated&quot; all kings of Aryavarta and annexed their territories, as suggested by the Allahabad Pillar inscription; however, Naravarman – a brother of Chandravarman of Mandsaur – is known to have been ruling as a feudatory in 404 CE.

; Ganapatinaga
: Ganapati-naga is identified as a Naga king. Several coins bearing the legend Ganapati have been discovered at Padmavati, Vidisha, and Mathura. Although these coins do not bear the suffix &quot;naga&quot;, they are similar to the ones issued by the other Naga kings such as Skanda-naga, Brihaspati-naga, and Deva-naga. Since hundreds of Ganapati&#x27;s coins have been found at Mathura, it appears that he was the ruler of a Naga branch headquartered at Mathura.

; Nagasena
: The 7th century text &quot;Harshacharita&quot; refers to the Naga king Nagasena, who &quot;met with his doom in Padmavati, as his secret plan was divulged by a &quot;sarika&quot; bird&quot;. Assuming this describes a historical person, it appears that Nagasena was the ruler of a Naga branch headquartered at Padmavati in present-day Madhya Pradesh.

; Achyuta-nandin
: Achyuta-nandin seems to be same as Achyuta, who is mentioned earlier in the inscription; his name may have been shortened in the earlier verses for metrical purposes. An alternatively theory identifies Achyuta and Nandin as two distinct kings.
: Achyuta was the ruler of Ahichchhatra in present-day Uttar Pradesh, where coins attributed to him have been discovered. These coins bear the legend &quot;Achyu&quot;, and are similar to the coins issued by the Naga rulers. This has led to suggestions that the Achyuta-nandin defeated by Samudragupta was the ruler of a Naga branch headquartered at Ahichhatra.

; Balavarman
: V. V. Mirashi identified Bala-varman (or Balavarma) as a ruler of the Magha dynasty of Kosambi. U. N. Roy suggested that Bala-varman may have been an ancestor of the Maukhari kings, who initially served as Gupta vassals, and whose names ended in -varman. Another theory identifies him with the successor of Shridhara-varman, the Shaka ruler of Eran. Samudragupta may have ended the dynasty of Eran, as suggested by the discovery of his inscription at Eran.
: K. N. Dikshit identified Balavarman with Balavarman, a ruler of the Varman dynasty of Kamarupa; however, Balavarman was not a contemporary of Samudragupta. Moreover, Kamarupa has been mentioned as a distinct frontier kingdom later on in the Allahabad Pillar inscription.

=== Conquests in the forest region ===

According to the Allahabad Pillar inscription, Samudragupta reduced all the kings of the forest region (&quot;atavika&quot;) to subservience. This forest region may have been located in central India: the inscriptions of the Parivrajaka dynasty, which ruled in this area, state that their ancestral kingdom was located within the 18 forest kingdoms.

=== Frontier kings and tribes ===
The Allahabad Pillar inscription mentions that rulers of several frontier kingdoms and tribal oligarchies paid Samudragupta tributes, obeyed his orders, and performed obeisance before him. The inscription explicitly describes the five kingdoms as frontier territories: the areas controlled by the tribes were also probably located at the frontier of Samudrgupta&#x27;s kingdom.

Historian Upinder Singh theorizes that the relationship of these frontier rulers to the Gupta emperor had &quot;certain elements of a feudatory relationship&quot;. According to historian R. C. Majumdar, it is likely that Samudragupta&#x27;s conquests in Aryavarta and Dakshinapatha increased his reputation to such an extent that the frontier rulers and tribes submitted him without a fight.

The frontier kingdoms included:

# Samatata, located in the present-day Bengal.
# Davaka, located in present-day Assam.
# Kamarupa, located in present-day Assam.
# Nepala, located in present-day Nepal. According to one theory, Nepala here refers to the Licchavi kingdom, whose rulers may have been the maternal relatives of Samudragupta.
# Karttripura, probably located in the present-day Uttarakhand: the inscription appears to name frontier kingdoms in geographical order proceeding from Bengal to Assam to Nepal; Uttarakhand would be next in the sequence. A now-obsolete theory identified Karttripura with Kartarpur in present-day Punjab, but Kartarpur was established much later, in the 16th century, by Guru Arjan.

The tribal oligarchies included:

# Malavas: During Samudragupta&#x27;s period, they were probably headquartered at Karkota-nagara (present-day Nagar Fort in Rajasthan), where several thousands of their coins have been discovered.
# Arjunayanas: Their coins have been found in the Mathura region. According to numismatist John Allan, the Arjunayanas resided in the triangle connecting the present-day Delhi, Jaipur and Agra.
# Yaudheyas: They ruled the area between the Sutlej and the Yamuna rivers after the Kushans. They seem to have become Samudragupta&#x27;s tributaries.
# Madrakas: They are generally placed between the Ravi and the Chenab rivers.
# Abhiras: Epigraphic and literary evidence suggests that they ruled in western India during Samudragupta&#x27;s period.
# Sanakanikas: They appear to have ruled the region around Udayagiri in present-day Madhya Pradesh. An inscription found at Udayagiri refers to a Sanakanika chief as a feudatory of Chandragupta II: this chief and his two predecessors are described as &quot;Maharajas&quot;, which suggests that Samudragupta allowed the Sanakanika chiefs to rule as his governors after conquering their territory.
# Kakas: They may have been the rulers of the area around the Sanchi hill, which has been mentioned as Kakanada in ancient inscriptions.
# Prarjunas They may be identified as the Prarjunakas mentioned in the &quot;Arthashastra&quot;, but their location is uncertain. Various theories place them in central India, including around the present-day Narsinghpur or Narsinghgarh in Madhya Pradesh.
# Kharaparikas: They may be same as the &quot;Kharaparas&quot; (literally &quot;thief&quot; or &quot;rogue&quot;) mentioned in a 14th-century stone inscription found at Batiyagarh (or Battisgarh) in Damoh district. These Kharaparas are variously identified as an indigenous tribe or freebooters of this region.
#* Some later sources suggest that the Kharaparas were a foreign tribe (possibly Mongols), and the Dingal-language texts use the word &quot;Kharapara&quot; as a synonym for &quot;Muslim&quot;, but such an identification is not applicable to Samudragupta&#x27;s period.
#* There is also some speculation about the Kharaparikas being same as the Gardabhilas mentioned in the &quot;Puranas&quot;, as the words &quot;Khara&quot; and &quot;Gardabha&quot; both mean &quot;donkey&quot; in Sanskrit. However, very little is known about the Gardabhilas from historical sources.

=== Relations with other rulers ===

Samudragupta&#x27;s inscription mentions that several kings tried to please him by attending on him personally; offering him their daughters in marriage (or, according to another interpretation, gifting him maidens); and seeking the use of the Garuda-depicting Gupta seal for administering their own territories. These kings included &quot;Daivaputra-Shahi-Shahanushahi, Shaka-Murundas, and the rulers of the island countries such as Simhala&quot;.

==== Daivaputra-Shahi-Shahanushahi ====
Numismatist John Allan theorized that Daivaputra, Shahi, and Shahanushahi were three different states; or alternatively, Shahi-Shahanushahi was a single state. Historian D. R. Bhandarkar argued that Daivaputra (&quot;a descendant of Devaputra&quot;) cannot be a stand-alone name, and identified Daivaputra-Shahi-Shahanushahi as a single ruler, possibly Kidara I, who had established a new kingdom Gandhara (present-day Afghanistan).

According to historian Tej Ram Sharma, Daivaputra refers to a Kushan king (Devaputra being a Kushan title); Shahi refers to a sub-branch of the Kushans; and Shahanushahi refers to the Sasanians. These kings controlled parts of present-day Punjab and Afghanistan.

Historian Ashvini Agrwal theorizes that Kidara, who initially ruled as a vassal of the Sasanian king Shapur II, may have formed an alliance with Samudragupta to overthrow his Sasanian overlord. In &quot;Raghuvamsha&quot;, the Gupta court poet Kalidasa states his hero Raghu defeated the Parasikas (Persians): Agrwal speculates that this description may be inspired from the Kidraite-Gupta victory over the Sasanians.

According to Abraham Eraly and others, the expression &quot;Devaputra Shāhi Shāhānu Shāhi&quot; evidently designates the Kushan princes, being a deformation of the Kushan regnal titles &quot;Devaputra, Shao and Shaonanoshao&quot;: &quot;Son of God, King, King of Kings&quot;. This suggests that by the time of the Allahabad inscription the Kushans still ruled in Punjab, but under the suzerainty of the Gupta Emperor.

According to Hans T. Bakker, candidates for the Daivaputrasāhi are the late Kushan kings of Gandhāra: Vasudeva II or Kipunadha, and regarding the śaka-murunda I follow Konow and Lüders, who argue that this &#x27;passage in the Allahabad inscription of Samudragupta leaves no doubt that murunda (i.e. &#x27;commander&#x27;), originally was a title used by Saka princes&#x27;. The șāhānuṣāhi refers to the &#x27;king of kings&#x27; Shapur II. 

According to S.R. Goyal, Samudragupta was determined to ensure the safety of the empire&#x27;s frontiers and secure the western trade routes. To address these concerns, he formed an alliance with Kidara, a strategic move aimed at countering the threats posed by Shapur II of the Sassanian Empire. As the more powerful partner in this alliance, Samudragupta provided significant support to Kidara. This collaboration proved to be highly effective; Kidara achieved victories over the Sassanians in 367-368 AD. However, these victories did not necessarily result in Shapur II becoming a vassal of either Kidara or Samudragupta.

==== Shaka-Murundas ====

Some scholars believe that the term &quot;Shaka-Murundas&quot; refers to a single entity. For example, scholars such as Sten Konow assert that &quot;Murunda&quot; is a Shaka title meaning &quot;lord&quot;; the Kushans also used similar titles (for example, Kanishka is titled a &quot;muroda&quot; in his Zeda inscription).

Other scholars, such as K. P. Jayaswal, believe that Shakas and Murundas are two different groups of people. According to this theory, Shakas here most probably refers to the Western Kshatrapa rulers of Ujjain. Jayaswal notes that the &quot;Puranas&quot; mention the rule of 13 Murunda kings, and Hemachandra&#x27;s &quot;Abhidhana-Chintamani&quot; describes Murunda as people of Lampaka (in present-day Afghanistan). However, Agrwal points out that these sources are of relatively late origin, and it is possible that a branch of the Shakas had come to be known as &quot;Murundas&quot;.

The exact location of the Shakas mentioned in Samudragupta&#x27;s inscription is not certain. V. A. Smith identified them with the Western Kshatrapas, who controlled the western Malwa and Saurashtra regions. D. R. Bhandarkar alternatively identified the Shaka-Murunda ruler with Shridhara-varman, a Shaka ruler whose inscriptions have been discovered at Sanchi (Kanakerha inscription) and Eran. Eran then came under the direct control of Samudragupta, as attested by his Eran inscription.

==== Simhala and other islands ====

According to the Chinese sources, Meghavarna, the king of Simhala (present-day Sri Lanka), sought to build a monastery at Bodh Gaya, for the convenience of the pilgrims from his kingdom. He sent rich presents for this purpose, and Samudragupta sanctioned his request to build the monastery. Using poetic exaggeration, Samudragupta&#x27;s courtier Harishena appears to have described this act of diplomacy as an act of subservience. Similarly, the 7th-century Chinese traveler Xuanzang, who visited this monastery, appears to have regarded the rich presents sent by Meghavarna as tribute: he states that Meghavarna &quot;gave in tribute to the king of India all the jewels of his country&quot;.

The &quot;other islands&quot; may be the Indianized kingdoms of South-East Asia, but there is no evidence that their rulers were subordinate to Samudragupta. They probably sent embassies to the Gupta empire, and maintained friendly relations. The sea ports of the Gupta Empire, such as Tamralipti, were probably connected to these kingdoms through the marine routes. The widespread use of Sanskrit in these kingdoms may have happened as a result of Gupta influence.

== Imperial extent ==

Samudragupta&#x27;s empire included a core territory, located in northern India, which was directly controlled by the emperor. Besides, it comprised a number of monarchical and tribal tributary states. Historian R. C. Majumdar theorizes that Samudragupta directly controlled an area extending from the Ravi River (Punjab) in the west to the Brahmaputra River (Bengal and Assam) in the east, and from the Himalayan foothills in the north to the Vindhya hills in the south. The south-western boundary of his territory roughly followed an imaginary line drawn from present-day Karnal to Bhilsa.

In the south, Samudragupta&#x27;s empire definitely included Eran in present-day Madhya Pradesh, where his inscription has been found. The Allahabad Pillar inscription suggests that he advanced up to Kanchipuram in the south. However, since the claims in the Allahabad Pillar inscription are from a royal eulogy, they must be treated with caution. The southern kings were not under his direct suzerainty: they only paid him tribute.

According to historian Kunal Chakrabarti, Samudragupta&#x27;s military campaigns weakened the tribal republics of present-day Punjab and Rajasthan, but even these kingdoms were not under his direct suzerainty: they only paid him tribute. Samudragupta&#x27;s claim of control over other kings is questionable. Historian Ashvini Agrawal notes that a gold coin of the Gadahara tribe bears the legend Samudra, which suggests that Samudragupta&#x27;s control extended up to the Chenab river in the Punjab region.

Some earlier scholars, such as J. F. Fleet believed that Samudragupta had also conquered a part of Maharashtra, based on the identification of Devarashtra with Maharashtra, and Erandapalla with Erandol, where some Gupta-era remains have been found. However, this theory is no longer considered correct.

== Coinage ==

The coinage of the Gupta Empire was initially derived from the coinage of the Kushan Empire, adopting its weight standard, techniques and designs, following the conquests of Samudragupta in the northwest of the subcontinent. The Guptas even adopted from the Kushans the name of &quot;Dinara&quot; for their coinage, which ultimately came from the Roman name &quot;Denarius aureus&quot;. The standard coin type of Samudragupta is highly similar to the coinage of the later Kushan rulers, including the sacrificial scene over an altar, the depiction of a halo, while differences include the headdress of the ruler (a close-fitting cap instead of the Kushan pointed hat), the Garuda standard instead of the trident, and Samudragupta&#x27;s jewelry, which is Indian.

The following types of Samudragupta&#x27;s coins, inscribed with Sanskrit language legends, have been discovered:

; Standard type
* Obverse legend: &quot;Samara-shata-vitata-vijayo-jita-ripurajito-divam-jayati&quot;. Translation: &quot;The unconquered one who has conquered his enemies [and] has continuously attained victories in a hundred battles, wins heaven&quot;; Alternative translation: &quot;The conqueror of the unconquered fortresses of his enemies, whose victory was spread in hundreds of battles, conquers heaven&quot;.
* Reverse legend: &quot;Prakramah&quot;

; Archer type
* Depicts Samudragupta standing fully dressed with a bow on his left hand and an arrow on his right hand.
* Obverse legend: &quot;Apratiratha vijitya kshitim sucharitair (or avnipatir) divam Jayati&quot;. Translation: &quot;Unopposed by hostile chariots, conquering the earth, he conquers heaven by his good deeds&quot;.
* Reverse legend: &quot;Apratirathah&quot;

; Battle-axe type
* Obverse legend: &quot;Kritanta-parshur-jayatyajitarajajetaji-tah&quot;. Translation: &quot;Wielding the axe of Kritanta (the god of death), the unconquered conqueror of unconquered kings is victorious&quot;
* Reverse legend: &quot;Kritanta-parashuh&quot;

; Tiger-slayer type
* Depicts the king wearing turban and waist-cloth, and trampling a tiger
* Legend: &quot;Vaghra-prakramah&quot;. Translation: &quot;Having the prowess of a tiger&quot;.

; Lyrist type
* Depicts Samudragupta wearing waist-cloth and seated cross-legged on a couch, playing a veena that lies on his knees.
* Legend: the king&#x27;s name

; Ashvamedha type
* Obverse legend: &quot;Rajadhirajah prithvim avitva divam jayatyahritavaji-medhah&quot; (&quot;the overlord of kings, who has performed the horse-sacrifice, having protected the earth, conquers the heaven&quot;) on the reverse.
** Some coins have an alternative legend: &quot;Rajadhirajah prithvim avitva divam jayatya-prativarya-viryah&quot; (&quot;the overlord of kings, of irresistible valour, having protected the earth, wins heaven&quot;).
* Reverse legend: &quot;Ashvamedha-prakramah&quot; (&quot;possessing the valour to perform the horse-sacrifice&quot;)

Various scholars, including numismatist John Allan, consider that the gold coins bearing the portraits of Chandragupta and Kumaradevi were issued by Samudragupta to commemorate his parents, while others have attributed the issue of these coins to Chandragupta himself.

== Inscriptions ==
Two inscriptions from Samudragupta&#x27;s reign have been discovered:

* Allahabad Pillar inscription
* Eran stone inscription

Fleet theorized that the Allahabad Pillar inscription was posthumous, and was issued during the reign of Chandragupta II, but modern scholars disagree with this theory.

Two other records are attributed to Samudragupta&#x27;s reign, but the genuineness of these records is disputed:

* Nalanda inscription, dated to the regnal year 5
* Gaya inscription, dated to the regnal year 9

Both these inscriptions state that they were written at the order of the Gupta officer Gopaswamin. Like the Mathura stone inscription of Chandragupta II, these records describe Samudragupta as the &quot;restorer of the Ashvamedha sacrifice&quot;. It seems suspicious that records issued so early in Samudragupta&#x27;s reign mention this claim, which does not appear in the later Allahabad Pillar inscription. One possibility is that these records were issued during Samudragupta&#x27;s reign, and were damaged after some time, because of which they were restored during the reign of Chandragupta II.

=== Eran inscription ===

At Eran, an inscription by Samudragupta seems to succeed that of a local Saka ruler named Sridharavarman, already known from the Kanakerha inscription at Sanchi and another inscription in Eran. Samudragupta may therefore have ousted Sridharavarman in his campaigns to the West. The Eran Inscription of Samudragupta is presently stored in Kolkata Indian Museum. The inscription, in red sandstone, was found not far to the west of the ruined temple of the boar. It reads:

== Religion ==

Samudragputa&#x27;s Eran inscription records the installation of a Vishnu idol in a temple. The Nalanda and Gaya inscriptions attributed to Samudragupta explicitly call him a devotee of Vishnu (&quot;parama-Bhagavata&quot;) He was also tolerant towards Buddhism, and permitted the construction of a Buddhist monastery commissioned by the Anuradhapura king Meghavarna at Bodh Gaya in his territory.

The Allahabad Pillar inscription states that Samudragupta was engaged in the performance of the Brahmanical ceremonies of Sattra (Soma sacrifices) and Diksha. It describes him as &quot;the giver of many hundreds of thousands of cows&quot;. The Mathura stone inscription of his son Chandragupta II also describes him as the giver of &quot;millions of cows and gold&quot;. It appears that Samudragupta donated these cows to the Brahmins who officiated his Sattra and Diksha ceremonies. The Eran inscription states that Samudragupta surpassed Prithu, Raghava and other legendary kings in giving gold.

The Allahabad Pillar inscription alludes to his divine kingship, comparing him to the &quot;Parama Purusha&quot; (supreme being), and also with deities such as Dhanada (Kubera), Varuna, Indra, and Antaka (Yama). The Eran inscription states that he was equal to Kubera and Yama in pleasure and anger respectively. The Mathura stone inscription similarly describes him as equal to the deities Kubera, Varuna, Indra, and Yama.

=== Ashvamedha ===

Samudragupta performed the Ashvamedha ritual, which was used by the ancient Indian kings to prove their imperial sovereignty, and issued gold coins (see Coinage section) to mark this performance. The copper-plate inscriptions of Samudragupta&#x27;s granddaughter Prabhavati-Gupta, who was a Vakataka queen, describe him as the performer of multiple horse sacrifices. According to one theory, Samudragupta indeed performed more than one horse sacrifices, as attested by the presence of two different legends on his Ashvamedha coins. Another theory dismisses the claim on Prabhavati-Gupta&#x27;s inscriptions as an exaggeration or a scribal error since this claim does not appear on the inscriptions of Samudragupta or his successors.

The Mathura stone inscription of Chandragupta II describes Samudragupta as &quot;the restorer of the Ashvamedha sacrifice that had been long in abeyance&quot; (Smith&#x27;s translation). This claim also appears in the inscriptions of the subsequent Gupta kings, as well as the spurious Gaya and Nalanda inscriptions attributed to Samudragupta. However, several kings including those from Bharashiva, Vakataka, Shalankayana, and Pallava dynasties had had performed Ashvamedha in the preceding years. Different scholars have attempted to explain this anomaly in different ways: H. C. Raychaudhuri suggests that the Gupta court poet did not know about these kings. According to R. C. Majumdar, Samudragupta was the first king several centuries to perform the sacrifice in the Magadha region. Majumdar also theorizes that the Ashvamedha ceremony performed by Bharashiva, Vakataka, and other near-contemporary kings was &quot;more of a religious nature&quot;, while Samudragupta&#x27;s ceremony actually involved proving his imperial sovereignty. Similarly, scholars such as S. K. Aiyangar and D. R. Bhandarkar, theorize that unlike the other kings, Samudragupta performed a &quot;full-fledged&quot; Ashvamedha ceremony. Others, such as V. S. Pathak and Jagannath Agrawal, interpret the verse to mean that Samudragupta performed the horse-ritual that lasted for a long-time.

The surviving verses of Samudragupta&#x27;s own Allahabad Pillar inscription do not mention the Ashvamedha ceremony. According to one theory, this inscription was put up to mark the beginning of the ceremony, as the panegyrics of the sacrificer were an essential part of the Ashvamedha ceremony. It is possible that its first four lines, which are now lost, contained a reference to the ceremony. 

== Personality ==

Samudragupta&#x27;s coins depict him as a man of tall stature and muscular physique. The Allahabad Pillar inscription presents him as a compassionate ruler, stating that his &quot;mind was engaged in providing relief to the low, the poor, the helpless, and the afflicted&quot;. It also mentions that he reinstated many royal families which had lost their kingdoms, including the kings defeated by him. At the same time, it states that he maintained strict administration (&quot;Prachanda shasana&quot;).

The inscription states that Samudragupta became famous among the learned people because of his poetical works, and earned the epithet &quot;king of poets&quot;. This suggests that he composed some poetical works, but none of these works now survive.

The inscription also boasts that Samudragupta put to shame the celestial musician Tumburu and Narada by his lovely performances of music. Samudragupta&#x27;s musical talents are also corroborated by his gold coins which depict him playing a veena. 

The inscription praises Samudragupta&#x27;s wisdom and intellect, stating that he put to shame the preceptor of the Lord of the Gods (that is, Brihaspati) by his sharp intellect.

== Legacy ==
Vincent Smith referred to Samudragupta as the &quot;Indian Napoleon&quot; due to his remarkable military campaigns and strategic prowess. His achievements included the total defeat of adversaries in Aryavarta, extensive expeditions in the Deccan across long distances and inhospitable terrains, and a notable expedition across the Indus River. This last expedition, which might have been led by Samudragupta himself or his son Chandragupta II, demonstrated his exceptional military skill and strategic acumen.

The comparison between Samudragupta and Napoleon is relevant in several aspects. Both rulers organized their empires in a broadly similar fashion. Napoleon’s empire, centered around France and including adjacent Dutch, Belgian, German, and Italian regions, was surrounded by a network of allied and protected states such as Spain, the Confederation of the Rhine, the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, and the Kingdoms of Italy and Naples. Similarly, Samudragupta’s empire encompassed nearly all of northern India, excluding regions like Sindh, much of Kashmir and western Rajasthan

Samudragupta&#x27;s empire was vast and strategically organized. It encompassed nearly the whole of modern Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, part of Bengal, and a significant portion of eastern Malwa. Beyond a ring of tributary states were the Saka and Kushaṇ principalities in the North-West, twelve states in the Deccan, kerala as well as Simhala (Sri Lanka) and several other islands. These regions were either allies or were compelled to show respect towards the empire, forming a second line of defense beyond the primary ring of tributary states.

Samudragupta&#x27;s imperial structure resembled that of Napoleon’s organizational strategy, featuring a strong central core surrounded by friendly states and dependencies. Like Napoleon, Samudragupta was influenced by the prevailing ideologies of his time. His Allahabad Prasasti (inscription) reflects his aspiration for *chakravartitva* or universal sovereignty, a Hindu ideal prevalent during the Gupta era, which sought to establish overlordship over all of Bharatavarsha (India). This ideal can be compared to Napoleon’s vision of a European Commonwealth under French hegemony. Unlike Napoleon, whose ambitions were curtailed after the Battle of Waterloo, Samudragupta successfully realized his vision and celebrated his achievements with the performance of an Asvamedha (horse sacrifice).

The Asvamedha performed by Samudragupta was of an elaborate type, denoted by the term chirotsanna, rather than the abbreviated form that was more common during that period. It is generally believed that this grand celebration occurred sometime after the inscription of the Allahabad Prasasti. However, it is also possible that the Asvamedha was conducted around the same time as the inscription.

It is believed that the Allahabad Prasasti was composed in conjunction with the performance of Samudragupta’s Asvamedha sacrifice. This elaborate type of sacrifice, known as *chirotsanna*, included *prateyya* or hymns praising the sacrificer and long-ago kings, performed by lute-players including a Rajanya who sang three self-composed songs. It is possible that the Asokan pillar, on which the prasasti was engraved, was used as an ornamental post during the sacrifice. Prayaga (modern-day Allahabad) was the original seat of the Gupta dynasty.

Samudragupta&#x27;s reign marked a significant revival of Brahmanical religion, which had declined since Emperor Ashoka&#x27;s promotion of Buddhism. Samudragupta represents a Hindu response to Ashoka’s Buddhist ideals. While Ashoka sought to be a *chakravarti dharmika dharmaraja*—a ruler who conquered through righteousness (dhamma) rather than force—Samudragupta aimed to be a traditional *chakravartin* through military conquest. Both emperors were considered *dharma vijayins* (victors through righteousness), but their concepts of achieving righteousness differed. Ashoka emphasized the moral aspects of religion, while Samudragupta focused on traditional martial and political authority

The question of whether Vikramaditya existed or is a legend is unresolved. However, it is well established that Samudragupta was the first historical ruler to assume the title of Vikrama. Elements of the Vikramaditya legend can be traced back to both Samudragupta and his son Chandragupta II, reflecting their personalities and achievements.

== Indian Embassy to Rome ==
According to a Roman historian, an Indian embassy arrived in Rome in 351 A.D., although it had been dispatched from India earlier. This event holds historical significance when viewed in the context of the political conditions in India during the mid-fourth century AD

Before 361 A.D., Rome was at war with the Sassanian Empire. During this period, it was plausible that Samudragupta, a prominent Indian ruler, might have sought to support Roman efforts against the Sassanians by sending an embassy. By aligning with Kidāra against Shapur II, Samudragupta would have aimed to keep Sassanian forces occupied and distracted.

In light of the political dynamics in Bactria and North-Western India, there is a suggestion that Kalidasa&#x27;s portrayal of Raghu&#x27;s conquests in his work, &quot;Raghuvaṃśa,&quot; might be based on the actual historical events of Samudragupta&#x27;s campaigns. Kalidasa describes Raghu&#x27;s military expeditions, including the conquest of Trikūta in the Deccan and subsequent campaigns against the Parasikas, Hunas, and Kambojas. 

Kalidasa&#x27;s epic, therefore, might reflect the real historical interactions and conflicts of the time, providing a literary perspective on the political and military landscape of the era.

== Succession ==

The official records of the Gupta dynasty state that Samudragupta was succeeded by Chandragupta II, who was his son from Dattadevi. Based on a reconstruction of the partially-lost Sanskrit play &quot;Devichandraguptam&quot;, a section of modern historians believe that Samudragupta was initially succeeded by Ramagupta (presumably the eldest son), who was then dethroned by Chandragupta II.

<text>Ĝ or ĝ (G circumflex) is a consonant in Esperanto orthography, representing a voiced postalveolar affricate (either palato-alveolar or retroflex), and is equivalent to a voiced postalveolar affricate or a voiced retroflex affricate or a voiced circumflex type pharynvelar consonant.

While Esperanto orthography uses a diacritic for its four postalveolar consonants, as do the Latin-based Slavic alphabets, the base letters are Romano-Germanic. Ĝ is based on the letter &quot;g&quot;, which has this sound in English and Italian before the vowels &quot;i&quot; and &quot;e&quot; (with some exceptions in English), to better preserve the shape of borrowings from those languages (such as &quot;ĝenerala&quot; from &quot;general&quot;) than Slavic &quot;đ&quot; (Serbo-Croatian) or &quot;dž&quot; would.

== Uses of &quot;Ĝ&quot; in other languages ==
In Haida, a language isolate, the letter &quot;ĝ&quot; was sometimes used to represent pharyngeal voiced fricative .

In Aleut, an Eskaleut language, &quot;ĝ&quot; represents a voiced uvular fricative . The corresponding voiceless Aleut sound is represented by x̂.

In Dutch, the letter &quot;ĝ&quot; is used in some phrase books and dictionaries for pronunciation help. It represents a plosive , because &quot;g&quot; is pronounced as a fricative in Dutch.

In some transcriptions of Sumerian, &quot;ĝ&quot; is used to represent the velar nasal .

<text>Ĥ or ĥ is a letter of some extended Latin alphabets, most prominently a consonant in Esperanto orthography, where it represents a voiceless velar fricative or voiceless uvular fricative . Its name in Esperanto is (pronounced ), or in the Kalocsay abecedary.

It is also used in the revised Demers/Blanchet/St Onge orthography for Chinook Jargon.

In the case of the minuscule, some fonts place the circumflex centered above the entire base letter h, others over the riser of the letter, and others over the shoulder.

== History ==

&quot;Ĥ&quot; was created by adding a circumflex to an ordinary &quot;H&quot;. It first appeared as part of the alphabet of the international language Esperanto, with the publication of the &quot;Unua Libro&quot; on 26 July 1887 marking the beginning of its wider usage. Like all other non-basic Latin letters in the Esperanto alphabet, it was inspired by Western Slavic Latin alphabets (e.g. Czech), but uses a circumflex instead of a caron — most likely to make the orthography appear more international (i.e. less Slavic) and more compatible with French typewriters, which were in general use at the time and had a dead key for the circumflex, allowing it to be typed over any character.

=== Reported end ===
⟨Ĥ⟩ was always the least frequent letter in Esperanto orthography, occurring mostly in words with Greek etymologies, where it represented a Romanized chi (in fact its name in the Kalocsay abecedary, , was most likely inspired by this usage). Since chi is pronounced in most languages, neologistic equivalents soon appeared in which ⟨ĥ⟩ was replaced by ⟨k⟩, such as → (&quot;technology&quot;) and → (&quot;chemistry&quot;). Such changes were probably due to the &#x27;k&#x27; sound being easier to pronounce by most European speakers, and the resulting word sounding more similar to the native equivalent. Some other replacements followed different patterns, such as → (&quot;Chinese &quot;).

These additions and replacements came very early and were in general use by World War I. Since then, the end of ⟨ĥ⟩ has been often discussed, but has never really happened. In modern times (post-World War II), no new coinages intended to replace words with ⟨ĥ⟩ in them have seen general use, with the notable of exception of for (&quot;chorus&quot;). Some words originally containing a ⟨ĥ⟩ are preferred to existing replacements (old or new), such as vs. (&quot;chaos&quot;).

Several words commonly use ⟨ĥ⟩, particularly those not derived from Greek words ( (&quot;khan&quot;), (&quot;jota&quot;), (&quot;Liechtenstein&quot;), etc.) or those in which there is another word that uses &quot;k&quot; in that context. The latter include:
* (&quot;echo&quot;) ≠ (&quot;beginning&quot;)
* (&quot;Czech&quot;) ≠ (&quot;bank check&quot;)
* (&quot;chorus&quot;) ≠ (&quot;heart&quot;) ≠ (&quot;hour&quot;)

==Other uses==

* A &#x27;Ĥ&#x27; was used in the stage name of the 1980s Italo disco singer &quot;CĤATO&quot;.
* In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian of a system is typically denoted by formula_1 (where the hat indicates that it is an operator), especially in the Wheeler–DeWitt equation.

<text>Ŝ or ŝ (S circumflex) is a consonant in Esperanto orthography, representing the sound .

Esperanto orthography uses a diacritic for all four of its postalveolar consonants, as do most Latin-based Slavic alphabets (Polish is the most notable exception). Letters and digraphs that are similar to &quot;ŝ&quot; (also based on &quot;s&quot;) and represent the same sound include Czech, Latvian, Lithuanian, Slovak, Slovene, Serbian Latin, and Croatian &quot;š&quot;, Albanian and English &quot;sh&quot;, German &quot;sch&quot;, Polish &quot;sz&quot;, Azerbaijani, Turkish and Turkmen &quot;ş&quot;, Romanian &quot;ș&quot;, Hungarian &quot;s&quot;, French &quot;ch&quot;, and Portuguese &quot;x&quot; and &quot;ch&quot;. The Cyrillic letter ш represents the same sound and represents a circumflex type with the up in down fricative consonant.

Ŝ is used in ISO 9:1995 (standard of transliteration into Latin characters of Cyrillic characters) for letter Щ, and is used in the orthography of the Tsilhqotʼin language.

<text>Berat (; ) is the ninth most populous city of Albania and the seat of Berat County and Berat Municipality. By air, it is north of Gjirokastër, west of Korçë, south of Tirana, and east of Fier.

Berat is located in the south of the country. It is surrounded by mountains and hills, including Tomorr on the east that was declared a national park. The river Osum (total length ) runs through the city before it empties into the Seman within the Myzeqe Plain. The municipality of Berat was formed at the 2015 local government reform by the merger of the former municipalities Berat, Otllak, Roshnik, Sinjë, and Velabisht, that became municipal units. The seat of the municipality is the city Berat. The total population is 62,232 as of the 2023 census, in a total area of .

Berat, designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 2008, comprises a unique style of architecture with influences from several civilizations that have managed to coexist for centuries throughout the history. Like many cities in Albania, Berat comprises an old fortified city filled with churches and mosques painted with grandiose wealth of visible murals and frescos. Berat is one of the main cultural centres of the country.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Berat&quot; has been derived through Albanian sound changes from the Old Slavonic language &quot;Bělgrad&quot; (Бѣлградъ) or &quot;Belgrád&quot; / &quot;Beligrad&quot; (Белград / Белиград), meaning &quot;White City&quot;.

It is believed to have been the site of the ancient city &quot;Antipatreia&quot; (, &quot;City of Antipater&quot;) or &quot;Antipatrea&quot; in Latin, while during the early Byzantine Empire the name of the town was &quot;Pulcheriopolis&quot; (Byzantine Greek: Πουλχεριόπολις, &quot;City of Pulcheria&quot;).
It was recorded in Medieval Latin as &quot;Belogradum&quot;, &quot;Bellegradum&quot;, in Turkish as &quot;Belgrad&quot;, in Italian as &quot;Belgrado&quot;, and in Greek as Βελλέγραδα, &quot;Bellegrada&quot;. In the Republic of Venice the city was known as &quot;Belgrado di Romania&quot; (&quot;Rumelian Belgrade&quot;), while in the Ottoman Empire it was also known as &quot;Belgrad-i Arnavud&quot; (&quot;Albanian Belgrade&quot;) to distinguish it from Belgrade in Serbia.

Today, in Aromanian, Berat is known as .

== History ==
=== Early development ===
Ceramic finds from the 7th century BCE initially attest to a settlement of the rocky hill of Berat by the Illyrians. Berat has been identified with ancient &quot;Antipatrea&quot;. Probably since the mid-4th century BCE the Illyrians went through a dynamic development, founding their own cities like Dimale and Byllis; however it is uncertain whether this development among Illyrians involved also Berat, or whether the foundation of the city is to be attributed to Cassander of Macedon. The founding date is unknown, although if Cassander is the founder, it would date back after he took control of southern Illyria around 314 BCE.

Antipatrea was involved in the Illyrian Wars and Macedonian Wars, and it is mentioned as a city of Dassaretia in southern Illyria. Along with Chrysondyon, Gertous and Creonion, Antipatrea was one of the Dassaretan towns around which the Illyrian dynast Skerdilaidas and the Macedonian king Philip V fought in 217 BCE. The city eventually was conquered by Philip V until Roman intervention. Antipatrea was described as the largest settlement with significant walls and referred to as the only &quot;urbs&quot; in the area, in contrast with other settlements that were described as &quot;castella&quot; or &quot;oppida&quot;. As reported by Roman historian Livy, in 200 BCE the Roman legatus Lucius Apustius &quot;stormed and subdued Antipatrea by force of arms and, after killing the men of military age and granting all the plunder to the soldiers, he demolished the walls and burned the city&quot;. In Roman times it was included within Epirus Nova, in the province of Macedonia. The town became part of the unstable frontier of the Byzantine Empire following the fall of the western Roman Empire and, along with much of the rest of the Balkan peninsula, it suffered from repeated invasions by Slavs. During the Roman and early Byzantine period, the city was known as &quot;Pulcheriopolis&quot;.

The First Bulgarian Empire under Presian I captured the town in the 9th century, and the city received the Slavic name &quot;Bel[i]grad&quot; (&quot;White City&quot;), Belegrada (Βελέγραδα) in Greek, which persisted throughout the medieval period, changing to &quot;Berat&quot; under Ottoman rule. The town became one of the most important towns in the Bulgarian region Kutmichevitsa. The Bulgarian governor Elemag surrendered the city to the emperor Basil II in 1018, and the city remained in Byzantine hands until the Second Bulgarian Empire retook the city in 1203 during the rule of Kaloyan. During the 13th century, it fell to Michael I Ducas, the ruler of the Despotate of Epirus.

Byzantine Emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos sent letters to the Albanian leaders of Berat and Durrës in 1272 asking them to abandon their alliance with Charles I of Naples, leader of the Kingdom of Albania, who had captured and incorporated it at the same period in the Kingdom of Albania. However, they passed the letters on to Charles as a sign of their loyalty.
In 1274 Michael VIII recaptured Berat and after being joined by Albanians who supported the Byzantine Empire, marched unsuccessfully against the Angevin capital of Durrës. In 1280-1281 the Sicilian forces under Hugh the Red of Sully laid siege to Berat. In March 1281 a relief force from Constantinople under the command of Michael Tarchaneiotes was able to drive off the besieging Sicilian army. Later in the 13th century Berat again fell under the control of the Byzantine Empire.

The fortress of Tomorr in the early 14th century is attested as &quot;Timoro(n)&quot; under Byzantine control. In 1337, the Albanian tribes which lived in the areas of Belegrita (the region of Mt. Tomorr near Berat) and Kanina rose in rebellion, and seized the fortress of Tomorr. There is little detail about the rebellion in primary sources. John VI Kantakouzenos mentions that the Albanians in those areas rebelled despite the privileges which Andronikos III Palaiologos had given them a few years earlier. Andronikos led an army mainly composed of Turkish mercenaries, and defeated the Albanians, killing many and taking prisoners. In 1345 (or maybe 1343) the town passed to the Serbian Empire. After its dissolution in 1355 Berat came under suzerainty of its former governor, John Komnenos Asen (1345-1363), Alexander Komnenos Asen (1363-1372) and Zeta of Balsha II (1372-1385). In 1385 Berat was captured by the Ottomans, before the Battle of Savra. According to some sources, the Ottomans probably remained in Berat for some time with intention to use it as foothold to capture Valona. By 1396, the Albanian Muzaka family took over control of Berat, which became the capital of the Principality of Berat. In 1417 Berat became a part of the Ottoman Empire. In 1455 Skanderbeg, a commander with an Albanian force of 14,000 and small number of Catalan soldiers unsuccessfully tried to capture Berat from an Ottoman force of 40,000.

=== Modern period ===

During the early period of Ottoman rule, Berat fell into severe decline. By the end of the 16th century it had only 710 houses. However, it began to recover by the 17th century, and became a major craft centre specializing in wood carving.

During the first part of the sixteenth century, Berat was a Christian city and did not contain any Muslim households. The urban population of this period (1506-1583) increased little, with the addition of 17 houses. Following their expulsion and arrival from Spain, a Jewish community existed in Berat that consisted of 25 families between 1519 and 1520.

Toward the latter part of the sixteenth century, Berat contained 461 Muslim houses and another 187 belonged to newcomers from the surrounding villages of Gjeqar, Gjerbës, Tozhar, Fratar, and Dobronik. Conversion to Islam of the local urban population in Berat had increased during this time and part of the newcomer population were also Muslim converts who had Islamic names and Christian surnames. Factors such as tax exemptions for Muslim urban craftsmen in exchange for military service drove many of the incoming rural first generation Muslim population to Berat. Followers of Sabbatai Zevi existed in Berat among Jews during the mid-seventeenth century. The Berat Jewish community took an active role in the welfare of other Jews, such as managing to attain the release of war-related captives present in Durrës in 1596.

By the early seventeenth century, urban life in Berat started to resemble Ottoman and Muslim patterns. From 1670 onward, Berat became a Muslim-majority city and of its 30 neighbourhoods, 19 were populated by Muslims. Factors attributed to the change of the urban religious composition in Berat was pressure to covert in some neighbourhoods, and a lack of Christian priests able to provide religious services.
In the 18th century, Berat was one of the most important Albanian cities during the Ottoman period.

In the early modern era the city was the capital of the Pashalik of Berat founded by Ahmet Kurt Pasha. Berat was incorporated in the Pashalik of Yanina after Ibrahim Pasha of Berat was defeated by Ali Pasha in 1809. In 1867, Berat became a sanjak in Yannina (Yanya) vilayet. Berat replaced a declining Vlorë as centre of the sanjak (province) in the nineteenth century. The sanjak of Berat and the city itself were under the dominance of the Albanian Vrioni family. The Jewish community of Yanina renewed the Jewish community of Berat in the nineteenth century.

A Greek school was operating in the city already from 1835. In the late Ottoman period, the population of Berat was 10–15,000 inhabitants, with Orthodox Christians numbering some 5,000 people of whom 3,000 spoke the Aromanian language and the rest the Albanian language. 

During the 19th century, Berat played an important part in the Albanian national revival. Christian merchants in Berat supported the Albanian movement. The Albanian revolts of 1833–1839 greatly impacted the city, especially with revolts that occurred in October 1833. The city&#x27;s castle was surrounded by 10,000 people. Berat&#x27;s mütesellim, Emin Aga, was forced to leave the city in the hands of the revolt&#x27;s leaders. On October 22, 1833 the revolt&#x27;s leaders drafted their requests to the Sublime Porte: they would no longer allow that Berat give soldiers to the Ottoman government. They also demanded that Albania&#x27;s local administration be led by Albanian people. The Ottoman government accepted the rebels&#x27; requests and nominated some Albanian officials in the city and declared an amnesty as well. In August 1839 a new uprising took place in Berat. The inhabitants attacked the Ottoman forces and besieged them in the castle. Meanwhile, the rebellion spread out to the regions of Sanjak of Vlorë. The rebels leaders sent a petition to Sultan Abdulmejid I to have Albanian officials in administration and to put Ismail Pasha, the nephew of Ali Pasha as a general governor. In September 1839 the rebels captured the castle, however once again the Ottoman government postponed the application of reforms in Albania.

Berat became a major base of support for the League of Prizren, the late 19th century Albanian nationalist alliance, while the city was also represented in the formation of southern branch of the league in Gjirokastër. In the First World War, a census by Austro-Hungarian occupation forces counted 6745 Orthodox Christians and 20,919 Muslims in the Berat region.

==== 20th and 21st century ====
During the Second World War, Jews were concealed in the homes and basements of 60 families from the Muslim and Christian communities in Berat. Albanian Muslims in the city let Jewish people worship in the local mosque, and a Star of David can still be seen on the walls of the city&#x27;s main Islamic place of worship.

From 23 to 30 October 1944, the second session of the Council of National Liberation of Albania was held in Berat, where the National Liberation Movement-controlled Anti-Fascist National Liberation Committee became the Provisional Democratic Government of Albania, with Enver Hoxha as its prime minister and minister of defence.

During the Communist era, Berat became a place of internal exile for those who were deemed public enemies, and their families. Starting in the 1950s, the village served as a political internment center from which the internees could not leave without permission. Each day, internees were required to sign up at the Security Office or the police. In 1963, a Deportation-Internment Commission report indicated that there were 30 interned in Berat, which consisted in part of internees those interned due to risk of escape. The rest are convicted for ordinary causes. In 1967, Albanian author Ismail Kadare was sent to Berat, where he spent two years. Relatives of those who had fled abroad, or sympathized with Titoist Yugoslavia were also deported to Berat.

In the modern period, a Romani community numbering 200-300 lives in Berat and its outskirts whereas others in a few nearby villages, at times living in difficult economic circumstances with some seasonally migrating to Greece for work. Some Aromanian-speakers and Greek-speakers can be found in the town and nearby villages.

== Geography ==
Berat lies on the right bank of the river Osum, a short distance from the point where it is joined by the Molisht river. The old city centre consists of three parts: Kalaja (on the castle hill), Mangalem (at the foot of the castle hill) and Gorica (on the left bank of the Osum). It has a number of buildings of architectural and historical interest. The pine forests above the city, on the slopes of the towering Tomorr mountains, provide a backdrop of appropriate grandeur. The Osumi river has cut a 915-metre deep gorge through the limestone rock on the west side of the valley to form a precipitous natural fortress, around which the town was built on several river terraces.

According to an Albanian legend, the Tomorr mountain was originally a giant, who fought with another giant (mountain) called Shpirag over a young woman. They killed each other and the girl drowned in her tears, which then became the Osum river.

Mount Shpirag, named after the second giant, is on the left bank of the gorge, above the district of Gorica. Berat is known to Albanians as the city of &quot;One above another Windows&quot; (a similar epithet is sometimes applied to Gjirokastra), or &quot;The City of Two Thousand Steps&quot;. It was proclaimed a &#x27;Museum City&#x27; by the dictator Enver Hoxha in June 1961.

=== Climate ===
Berat has a Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification. Summers are characterised as hot and dry with a maximum average of in July. Conversely, winter brings mild and wet weather with an average of in January. The lowest minimum temperature recorded in Berat was estimated at and its highest maximum temperature at .

== Economy ==
By the 18th century the economy and society of Berat was closely connected to the city&#x27;s craft guilds partly related to various tax exemptions that existed since the late Middle Ages. By 1750 there were twenty-two guilds, the most important of which were the tanners&#x27;, the cobblers&#x27; and other leather-working guilds. Other guilds included metal-working, silver-smithing and silk-making ones.

Present-day Berat houses Albania&#x27;s military industry with the nearby Kuçovë base and Poliçan factory as well as a developing tourist economy as of recent years thanks to its historical sites.

== Culture ==
=== Landmarks ===

The coexistence of religious and cultural communities over several centuries, beginning in the 4th century BC into the 18th century is apparent in Berat. The town also bears testimony to the architectural excellence of traditional Balkan housing construction, which date to the late 18th and the 19th centuries. Some of the landmarks of that historical period could be seen in the Berat Castle, churches of the Byzantine era such as the Church of St. Mary of Blaherna (13th century), the Bachelors&#x27; Mosque, the National Ethnographic Museum, the Sultan&#x27;s Mosque (built between 1481 and 1512), Leaden Mosque (built in 1555) and the Gorica Bridge.
Berat Castle is built on a rocky hill on the right bank of the river Osum and is accessible only from the south. After being burned down by the Romans in 200 BC the walls were strengthened in the 5th century under Byzantine Emperor Theodosius II, and were rebuilt during the 6th century under the Emperor Justinian I and again in the 13th century under the Despot of Epirus, Michael Komnenos Doukas, cousin of the Byzantine Emperor. The main entrance, on the north side, is defended by a fortified courtyard and there are three smaller entrances. The surface that the fortress encompasses made it possible to house a considerable portion of the town&#x27;s inhabitants. The buildings inside the fortress were built during the 13th century and because of their characteristic architecture are preserved as cultural monuments. The population of the fortress was Christian, and it had about 20 churches (most built during the 13th century) and only one mosque, for the use of the Muslim garrison, (of which there survives only a few ruins and the base of the minaret). The churches of the fortress have been damaged through the years and only some remain.

The Church of St. Mary of Blachernae dating from the 13th century, has 16th century mural paintings by Nikollë Onufri, son of the most important post-medieval Albanian painter, Onufri. In a small tree - planted square, on a hillside inside the walls of the fortress, stands the 14th century Church of the Holy Trinity. It is built in the form of a cross and has Byzantine murals. Outside the ramparts is the Church of St. Michael (Shën Mehill), built in the 13th century. This church is reached by a steep but perfectly safe path. Near the entrance, after a guardhouse, is the little Church of St. Theodore (Shen Todher), which have wall paintings by Onufri himself. The most interesting is the cathedral of St. Nicholas, which has been well restored and is now a museum dedicated to Onufri. Onufri was the greatest of the 16th century painters in Albania. Not only was he a master of the techniques of fresco and icons, but he was the first to introduce a new colour in painting, shiny red, which the French called &quot;Onufri&#x27;s Red&quot;. In addition, Onufri introduced a certain realism and a degree of individuality in facial expression.

The first inscription recording Onufri&#x27;s name was found in 1951, in the Shelqan church. The Kastoria church has a date 23 July 1547 and a reference to Onufri&#x27;s origin : &quot;I am Onufri, and come from the town of Berat&quot;. Onufri&#x27;s style in painting was inherited by his son, Nikolla (Nicholas), though not so successful as his father. In Onufri&#x27;s museum can be found works of Onufri, his son, Nikolla and other painters&#x27;. There are also numbers of icons and some fine examples of religious silversmith&#x27;s work (sacred vessels, icon casings, covers of Gospel books, etc.). Berat Gospels, which date from the 4th century, are copies (the originals are preserved in the National Archives in Tirana). The church itself has an iconostasis of carved wood, with two icons of Christ and the Virgin Mary. The bishop&#x27;s throne and the pulpit are also notable. 
Near the street running down from the fortress is the Bachelors&#x27; Mosque (Xhami e Beqareve), built in 1827. This has a portico and external decoration of flowers, plants, and houses. The &#x27;Bachelors&#x27; were the young shop-assistants (in practice generally unmarried), whom the merchants in Berat used as their own private militia.

The King Mosque (), the oldest in the town built in the reign of Bayazid II (1481–1512), is notable for its fine ceiling. It is museum in the modern period.

The Lead Mosque (Xhamia e Plumbit), built in 1555 and so called from the covering of its cupola. This mosque is the centre of the town.
The Halveti Tekke (Teqe e Helvetive) is thought to have been built in the 15th century. It was rebuilt by Ahmet Kurt Pasha in 1782. It belongs to the Khalwati Sufi order. 

Near of tekke is purported to be the grave of Sabbatai Zevi, an Ottoman Jew who was banished to Dulcigno (present day Ulcinj), who created controversy among his followers upon his conversion to Islam.

A Jewish history museum named &quot;Solomon Museum&quot; is located in southern Berat, and contains exhibits about the Holocaust in Albania and the survival of Jews during the war in the country.
The town is known for its historic architecture and scenery and is known as the &quot;Town of a Thousand Windows&quot;, due to the many large windows of the old decorated houses overlooking the town.

It is unclear whether it really means &quot;Thousand&quot; (një mijë) or &quot;One over Another&quot; (një mbi një) windows. Indeed, the quarter is built in a very steep place and windows seem to be one over another. Similar views can be seen in Melnik, Bulgaria, Gjirokastër in Albania, as well as Catanzaro in Italy, where an Albanian minority once lived.

The Citadel overlooks the river and the modern city as well as the old Christian quarter across the river. It is a well preserved area containing narrow streets, Turkish houses and Orthodox churches.

Modern Berat consists of three parts divided by the Osum River: Gorica (&quot;little mountain&quot; in Old Church Slavonic), Mangalem and Kalaja, the latter being a residential quarter within the old Byzantine citadel that overlooks the town. The town also has a 15th-century mosque and a number of churches of the Albanian Orthodox Church, whose autocephaly was proclaimed there in 1922. Several of the churches house works by the renowned 16th century painter Onufri.
Berat National Ethnographic Museum opened in 1979. It contains a diversity of everyday objects from throughout Berat&#x27;s history. The museum contains non-movable furniture which hold a number of household objects, wooden case, wall-closets, as well as chimneys and a well. Near the well is an olive press, wool press and many large ceramic dishes, revealing a glimpse of the historical domestic culture of Berat&#x27;s citizens. The ground floor has a hall with a model of a medieval street with traditional shops on both sides. On the second floor is an archive, loom, village sitting room, kitchen and sitting room.

Gorica Bridge, which connects two parts of Berat, was originally built from wood in 1780 and was rebuilt with stone in the 1920s. The seven-arch bridge is long and wide and is built about above the average water level. According to local legend, the original wooden bridge contained a dungeon in which a girl would be incarcerated and starved to appease the spirits responsible for the safety of the bridge.

=== Education ===
In addition to secondary schools, the city hosted the Albanian University in Berat, a private institution that terminated its programs in 2019.

=== Sports ===
The football (soccer) club is KS Tomori Berat.

<text>The Archbishopric of Magdeburg was a Latin Catholic archdiocese (969–1552) and Prince-Archbishopric (1180–1680) of the Holy Roman Empire centered on the city of Magdeburg on the Elbe River.

Planned since 955 and established in 967, the archdiocese had de facto turned void since 1557, when the last papally confirmed prince-archbishop, the Lutheran Sigismund of Brandenburg came of age and ascended to the see. All his successors were only administrators of the prince-archbishopric and Lutheran too, except the Catholic cleric Leopold William of Austria (1631–1635). In ecclesiastical respect the remaining Catholics and their parishes and abbeys in the former archdiocese were put under supervision of the Archdiocese of Cologne in 1648 and under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic Vicariate of the Northern Missions in 1670.

In political respect the &quot;Erzstift&quot;, the archiepiscopal and capitular temporalities, had gained imperial immediacy as a prince-archbishopric in 1180. Its territory comprised only some parts of the archdiocesan area, such as the city of Magdeburg, the bulk of the Magdeburg Börde, and the Jerichow Land as an integral whole and exclaves in parts of the Saalkreis including Halle upon Saale, Oebisfelde and environs as well as Jüterbog and environs. The prince-archbishopric maintained its statehood as an elective monarchy until 1680. Then the Brandenburg-Prussia the prince-archbishopric of Magdeburg. After being secularised, the state was transformed into the Duchy of Magdeburg, a hereditary monarchy in personal union with Brandenburg.

The 1994-founded modern Diocese of Magdeburg is a diocese of the Latin Church of the Catholic Church located in the German states of Saxony-Anhalt (bulk), Brandenburg and Saxony (smaller fringes each).

== History ==

The town was one of the oldest emporia of the German trade for the Wends who dwelt on the right bank of the Elbe. In 805 it is first mentioned in history. In 806 Charlemagne built a fortress on the eastern bank of the river opposite Magdeburg. The oldest church is also credited to this time. 

Magdeburg first played an important part in the history of Germany during the reign of Otto the Great (936-73). In 929 King Otto I granted the city to his English-born wife Edith as dower. She had a particular love for the town and often lived there. The emperor also continually returned to it. In September 937, Otto and his wife founded a Benedictine monastery at Magdeburg, which was dedicated to Sts. Peter, Maurice, and the Holy Innocents. The first abbots and monks came from St. Maximin&#x27;s Abbey, Trier.

After the wars of the years 940 and 954, the Polabian Slavs as far as the Oder, had been brought into subjection to German rule. However, the Magyars had advanced so far into Germany, that Augsburg was threatened. At the Battle of Lechfeld in 955 they were defeated and repelled. Otto immediately set to work to establish an archbishopric in Magdeburg, for the stabilisation through Christianisation of the eastern territories. He wished to transfer the capital of the diocese from Halberstadt to Magdeburg, and make it an archdiocese. But this was strenuously opposed by the Archbishop of Mainz, who was the metropolitan of Halberstadt.

When, in 962, Pope John XII sanctioned the establishment of an archbishopric, Otto seemed to have abandoned his plan of a transfer. The estates belonging to the convent founded in 937 were converted into a mense for the new archbishopric, and the monks transferred to the Berge Convent. The abbey church became the Cathedral of St. Maurice.

Its ecclesiastical province included the existing dioceses of Brandenburg and Havelberg and the newly founded dioceses of Merseburg, Zeitz, and Meißen. (Lebus was added in 1424.) The new archdiocese was close to the unsecured border regions of the Holy Roman Empire and Slavic tribes, and was meant to promote Christianity among the many Slavs and others. On 20 April 967, the archbishopric was solemnly established at the Synod of Ravenna in the presence of the pope and the emperor. The first archbishop was Adelbert, a former monk of St. Maximin&#x27;s at Trier, afterwards a missionary bishop to the Ruthenians (Ruthenia), and Abbot of Weissenburg in Alsace. He was elected in the autumn of 968, received the pallium at Rome, and at the end of the year was solemnly enthroned in Magdeburg.

The archdiocesan area of Magdeburg was rather small; it comprised the Slavonic districts of Serimunt, Nudizi, Neletici, Nizizi, and half of northern Thuringia, which Halberstadt resigned. The cathedral school especially gained in importance under Adalbert&#x27;s efficient administration. The scholastic Othrich was considered the most learned man of his times. Many eminent men were educated at Magdeburg.

Othrich was chosen archbishop after Adalbert&#x27;s death (981). Gisiler of Merseburg obtained possession of the See of Magdeburg by bribery and fraud. Upon his death in 1004, there followed a brief conflict between King Henry II and the cathedral canons before Tagino was installed as archbishop. Tagino and his suffragans were relied upon heavily for military service in the eastern marches.

Among successors worthy of mention are the zealous Gero (1012–23) and St. Norbert, prominent in the 12th century (1126–34), the founder of the Premonstratensian order.
Archbishop Wichmann (1152–92) was more important as a sovereign and prince of the Holy Roman Empire than as a bishop. Wichmann sided with the emperor in the Great Saxon Revolt and was rewarded by recognising the archepiscopal and the cathedral capitular temporalities as a state of imperial immediacy within the Holy Roman Empire, thus Wichmann was the first to add the title secular prince to his ecclesiastical archbishop. Albrecht II (1205–32) quarrelled with Otto II, Margrave of Brandenburg (1198–1215), because he had pronounced the pope&#x27;s ban against the latter and this war greatly damaged the archbishopric. In 1208 he began to build the present Cathedral of Magdeburg, which was only consecrated in 1263, and never entirely finished; Günther I (1277–79) hardly escaped a serious war with the Margrave Otto IV, who was incensed because his brother Eric of Brandenburg had not been elected archbishop. The Brandenburgers succeeded in forcing Günther I and Bernard III (1279–1281) to resign and in making Eric archbishop (1283–1295).

Cardinal Albert of Brandenburg (1513–45), on account of his insecure position, as well as being crippled by a perpetual lack of funds, gave some occasion for the spread of Lutheranism in his diocese, although himself opposing the Reformation. It is not true that he became a Lutheran and wished to retain his see as a secular principality, and just as untrue that in the Kalbe Parliament in 1541 he consented to the introduction of the Reformation in order to have his debts paid. His successors were the zealous Catholics John Albert of Brandenburg-Ansbach (1545–1550), who however could accomplish very little, and Frederick IV of Brandenburg, who died in 1552.

Administrators who were secular princes now took the place of the archbishop, and they, as well as the majority of the cathedral chapter and the inhabitants of the archdiocese, were usually Protestant. They belonged to the Hohenzollern House of Brandenburg, which had adopted Calvinism in 1613. Christian William was taken prisoner in 1631 after the sack of Magdeburg, and went over to the Catholic Church in Vienna. At the time of the Peace of Prague (1635), the Archbishopric of Magdeburg fell to August, Duke of Saxe-Weissenfels. In the Treaty of Westphalia (1648), the expectancy to the archbishopric was promised to Brandenburg-Prussia upon the death of August. When the Saxon prince died in 1680, the archbishopric was secularised by Brandenburg and transformed into the Duchy of Magdeburg.

The remaining Catholics in the area were under the jurisdiction of the Apostolic Vicariate of the Northern Missions between 1670 and 1709, and again
from 1780 to 1821. Between 1709 and 1780 the Apostolic Vicariate of Upper and Lower Saxony was the competent Catholic jurisdiction. In 1821, the area was transferred in Catholic respect to the Diocese of Paderborn. In 1994, the Diocese of Magdeburg was founded in the area.

<text>Katarina Witt (, ; born 3 December 1965) is a German former figure skater. A two-time Olympic champion, Witt is regarded as one of the greatest ladies&#x27; singles figure skaters of all time. Her Laureus profile states that &quot;she is remembered most for her overall athleticism, her charismatic appeal and her glamorous image on the ice.&quot;

Witt won the first of her two Olympic gold medals for East Germany at the 1984 Sarajevo Olympics, before winning a second at the 1988 Calgary Olympics. She is one of only two skaters to defend a ladies&#x27; singles Olympic title, the other being Norwegian Sonja Henie. Witt is a four-time World Champion (1984, 1985, 1987, 1988) and two-time World silver medalist (1982, 1986). She won six consecutive European Championships (1983–1988), a feat equalled only by Henie among female skaters. Between 1984 and 1988, Witt won ten gold medals from eleven major international events, making her one of the most successful figure skaters ever.

Retiring from competitive skating after defending her Olympic title in 1988, Witt reappeared at the 1994 Winter Olympics where she represented a reunified Germany while skating a Robin Hood-themed program, a comeback performance which saw her receive the Goldene Kamera award. Since her subsequent retirement, Witt has worked in film and television.

== Early life ==
Witt was born in Staaken (at that time a district of Falkensee) in East Germany, just outside West Berlin, which is today part of Berlin. Her mother worked in a hospital as a physiotherapist and her father was a farmer. She went to school in Karl-Marx-Stadt (now reverted to its pre-war name Chemnitz). There, she attended the Kinder- und Jugendsportschule, a special school for athletically talented children.

== Competitive career ==
Witt represented the SC Karl-Marx-Stadt club for East Germany (GDR). Jutta Müller began coaching her in 1977. Witt trained six days a week, sometimes for seven hours a day with three hours spent on compulsory figures.
Witt made her first appearance in a major international competition at the 1979 European Championships, finishing 14th at the event. At the 1981 World Championships, she placed 1st in the short, 3rd in the long, and 2nd in the combined free skate, missing a medal due to low placement in figures. She placed on a major podium for the first time in 1982, winning silver at both the European and World Championships. She had a great shot at winning the 1982 World Championships, which she only required winning the long program to do. However, she stepped out of three jumps, including the legendary triple flip, the complex element she was the very first woman to accomplish, and a relatively easy double axel, which cost her the long program win and the overall gold medal. The eventual winner of the competition was Elaine Zayak, who landed six triples. The next season, she won her first European title but finished off the World podium in fourth place, because she was 8th in compulsory figures despite winning the combined free skating. Had she placed 1st in the long program instead of 2nd (on a 5–4 split) to Sumners, she would have jumped to the silver over both Leistner and Vodorezova. Her free skate with a triple flip and five triples was technically superior to Sumners&#x27;, and many believed she should have taken the crucial 1st place in this phase.

In 1984, Witt was voted &quot;GDR Female Athlete of the Year&quot; by the readers of the East German newspaper &quot;Junge Welt&quot;. She won the 1984 Olympic title in Sarajevo, with reigning World champion Rosalynn Sumners of the United States in second. Witt and Sumners held the top two spots heading into the Olympic free skate, which was worth fifty percent of the total score. Witt landed three triple jumps in her free skate program, and the judges left room for Sumners to win the event. Sumners scaled back two of her jumps and Witt won the long program by one-tenth of a point on one judge&#x27;s scorecard. Witt won the gold medal aged 18 years and 77 days, becoming one of the youngest Olympic figure skating champions. Witt then went on to win her first World title in dominant fashion (without Sumners) winning all three phases of the competition. She said then she planned to continue a while longer but did not see herself likely making it to the 1988 Calgary Olympics.

Witt successfully defended her World title in 1985. Here, she was solid and clean in all three phases, placing 3rd to her two main competitors, Kira Ivanova and Tiffany Chin, in the compulsory figures, convincingly winning the short program even over the clean skates of Ivanova and Chin. In the long program, she was put under pressure by Ivanova who made a strong bid for the gold with a clean three-triple long program including a difficult triple loop, but Witt trumped her with a four-triple long program, highlighting her superior artistry to Ivanova&#x27;s and overtaking her by six judges to three in the long program as well as overall. The judges left room for Chin to win the long program and event, but unfortunately she fell on a double axel and did not complete a triple salchow in her performance, settling for the bronze medal. Witt&#x27;s longstanding gold-medal dominance of the sport was finally disrupted when in an upset she placed second to American Debi Thomas, the new United States Champion, the following year. At those Worlds, she did win the long program over Thomas&#x27;s clean skate with identical content, scoring two 6.0s for artistic impression, but a combination miss which left her 4th in the short cost her the gold. This was also the first time since 1980 she would lose the short program phase at a World Championship. To win, she would have needed the final skater, Chin, to place between her and Thomas in the long program, but this did not occur. She had been considering making the 1986 World Championships her final event, but stung by the loss, Witt vowed to regain her title and skate on to Calgary.

In 1987, Witt won her third World title. Although Witt finished fifth in compulsory figures, which meant that Thomas could finish second in both the short and long programs and still retain the World title, Thomas&#x27; 7th place in the short program (due to a small hand down on her double axel) put the two skaters on a level playing field ahead of the free skate. In fact, five skaters entered the long program in strong contention for the gold: Kira Ivanova, Witt, Thomas, Elizabeth Manley, and Caryn Kadavy, all needing to only win the long program (or win the long program and beat Ivanova by two places in the long program in the case of Manley and Kadavy) to win. Skating last and under immense pressure with both Kadavy and Thomas having earlier turned in brilliant performances, Witt landed five triple jumps, including a clean triple loop jump which was most crucial of all to win. Earlier, Thomas had two footed her triple-loop attempt, and while Kadavy had done two successful triple loops, she had also popped several triple or double-axel attempts. Even on a night of brilliant skating by a majority of the notable competitors, Witt convincingly earned both the best technical and artistic marks of the night, was ranked first by seven of the nine judges, and reclaimed her World title to an appreciative crowd.

In 1988, Witt won her sixth consecutive European Championship, equaling the achievement of Sonja Henie as the most-successful skater in ladies&#x27; singles at the European Championships. Both Witt&#x27;s and Henie&#x27;s number of European titles have since been surpassed by Irina Slutskaya, but Witt retains the record for most consecutive European titles, sharing it with Henie.

Both Witt and Thomas were favoured contenders at the 1988 Winter Olympics in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Their rivalry was known as the &quot;Battle of the Carmens&quot;, as each woman had independently elected to skate her long program to music from Bizet&#x27;s opera &quot;Carmen&quot;. They held the top two spots after the compulsory figures and the short program. Witt was third in the compulsories, behind Ivanova and Thomas, before winning the short program with Thomas second. In her long program, Witt landed four triple jumps and downgraded her planned triple-loop jump to a double loop. This left room for Thomas to win the long program, but Thomas missed three of her five planned triple jumps. Canadian skater Elizabeth Manley won the long program convincingly over Witt (seven judges to two), however Witt retained her Olympic title based on her overall scores (she had finished ahead of Manley in both the compulsory figures and the short program). Witt became only the second woman in figure skating history (after Sonja Henie) to defend her Olympic title successfully. Had Manley not narrowly lost second place to Thomas in the short program (by one judge), or Witt not narrowly held onto second place over Ito in the long program (on a 6–3 split), Manley would have defeated Witt for the overall gold medal. To honour Witt and her win in Calgary, North Korea issued miniature sheets with three large pictures of Witt on the ice. &quot;Time&quot; magazine called her &quot;the most beautiful face of socialism.&quot;

Witt won a fourth and final World title to end her amateur career at the 1988 World Championships in Budapest, Hungary. She turned in a relatively lackluster long program, popping out of both a planned triple loop and triple salchow, and below the quality of her Olympic performance, but with other top contenders also being mostly subpar and fatigued after the high of the Calgary Games, she won gold with a victory in compulsory figures (just second win in figures in a World or Olympic event, only other instance was 1984 Worlds), 2nd place to Debi Thomas in the short program, and victory in the long program. One of her rivals, silver medalist Elizabeth Manley, later complained about some of what she perceived to be dubious foul play in the event, including Witt&#x27;s win in the figures where she overcame Manley&#x27;s lead in the first two figures in the final loop figure, which Manley believed to be her best, and Manley&#x27;s music not being played properly to start her short program (where Manley had a combination miss and took only 4th place, ending her gold medal chances). 
On 1 November 1988, in honor of her victory at the Olympics, a block of stamps was released in the DPRK.

In 1988, Witt started a professional career – rare for East German athletes. She spent three years on tour in the United States with Brian Boitano, also an Olympic champion. Their show, &quot;Witt and Boitano Skating&quot;, was so successful that for the first time in ten years, New York&#x27;s Madison Square Garden was sold out for an ice show. Later, she continued at Holiday on Ice in the United States and in western Europe. She also became an actress in the film &quot;Carmen on Ice&quot; (1989), which expanded upon her gold-medal free program in Calgary. In 1990, she received an Emmy Award for her role in this film. As a professional she was never as successful competitively as an amateur, often placing last of four or five women in her appearances at the two biggest professional championships (Challenge of Champions and World Professional Championships in Landover), but continued to receive great acclaim as an entertainer and show skater.

In 1994, Witt made a comeback to the competitive-skating scene, coached again by Jutta Müller. She was expected to be in a fierce three-person fight for only two spots on the German Olympic team with both young rising star Tanja Szewczenko and veteran Marina Kielmann, who was almost the same age as Witt. She finished second at the German Championships behind Szewczenko, but above Kielmann. Witt&#x27;s first international competition for the reunified country of Germany, following eleven years competing for East Germany, was the 1994 European Championships, where she finished eighth, again behind Szewczenko who was fifth, but again ahead of Kielmann who was ninth. She and Szewczenko thus gained the two available spots ahead of Kielmann for the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway, where she finished seventh. Particularly pleasing to Witt was her clean and very confident short program, where some of the contenders with more a difficult jump combination (Lu Chen, Josée Chouinard, Yuka Sato, Tonya Harding) faltered, left her 6th, and inclusion into the final flight of the long program which few gave her any chance of pre-Games. In a dramatic buildup, she would also draw last to skate, and get to close the show in her final Olympic skate, after the medalists had already been determined. Her free program to the music &quot;Sag mir wo die Blumen sind&quot; (an arrangement of the Pete Seeger folksong &quot;Where Have All the Flowers Gone?&quot;) included a peace message for the people of Sarajevo, the site of her first Olympic victory. While she had some technical problems, completing only three of her planned five triples, she delivered perhaps the most emotional and moving performance of the whole evening. She received the Golden Camera for her Olympic comeback.

Witt&#x27;s taste in figure-skating costumes sometimes caused debate. At the 1983 European Championships, she skated her Mozart short program in knee breeches instead of a skirt. Her blue, skirtless feather-trimmed 1988 costume for a showgirl-themed short program was considered too theatrical and sexy, and led to a change in the ISU regulations dubbed the &quot;Katarina rule&quot; which required female skaters to wear more modest clothing; skirts were required to cover the buttocks and crotch. In 1994, skating a Robin Hood-themed program, Witt stated, &quot;I wore the Robin Hood – like a man&#x27;s costume – because I didn&#x27;t want to be accused of seducing the judges this time.&quot;

In 1994, Witt published her autobiography &quot;Meine Jahre zwischen Pflicht und Kür&quot; (&quot;My Years between Compulsories and Freestyle&quot;). In 1995, Witt was inducted into the World Figure Skating Hall of Fame. Her farewell from show skating tour took place in February and March 2008.

== Post-skating career ==
In 1996, Witt received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 1996, Witt had a cameo appearance in the movie &quot;Jerry Maguire&quot; and on the television show &quot;Everybody Loves Raymond&quot;.

She starred in a German-language film called &quot;Die Eisprinzessin&quot; - &quot;The Ice Princess&quot;, providing the vocals for the theme song, &quot;Skate with Me&quot;.

She appeared as herself in two episodes of the comedy series &quot;Arli$$&quot; that aired in 1997 and 1998.

Witt posed nude for &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, and the pictures were published months later in the December 1998 issue, which was the second ever sold-out issue of the magazine. (The first sold-out issue was the inaugural one including photos of Marilyn Monroe.) Witt said she did not care for the &quot;cute, pretty, ice princess image&quot; of figure skaters and wanted to &quot;change people&#x27;s perceptions&quot;.

In 1998, Witt appeared in the film &quot;Ronin&quot; in a small supporting role with several lines of dialogue. Around this time, she also played a villain in an episode of the tongue-in-cheek television series, &quot;V.I.P.&quot; In November 2005, Witt published a novel, &quot;Only with Passion&quot;, in which she offers advice to a fictional young skater based on her many years of skating. Since October 2006, she has had her own TV show, &quot;Stars auf Eis&quot; (&quot;Stars on Ice&quot;), on German channel ProSieben. She was invited to Istanbul as an honoured guest for the skating competition TV show called &quot;Buzda Dans&quot; (&quot;Dance on Ice&quot;) on 25 February 2007. On 3 December 2011, Witt was confirmed as a judge on the UK TV show &quot;Dancing on Ice&quot;, where she made her first appearance on 8 January 2012.

On 7 July 2007, Witt was a competitor at the German segment of Live Earth. She headed Munich&#x27;s unsuccessful bid to host the 2018 Winter Olympics.

In January 2013, Witt appeared on German TV in her first leading role, playing a figure skater who is pursued by a stalker. The made-for-television movie &quot;&quot; thus has autobiographical elements, as Witt herself had been stalked in the United States 20 years earlier.

=== East German files ===

Following the dissolution of East Germany, Ministerium für Staatssicherheit (Stasi) files were found to show that the secret police had worked hard to keep Witt from defecting by giving her cars, accommodations, and permitted travel. Witt found 3,500 pages on her life from the age of seven.
