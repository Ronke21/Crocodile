<text>A minority government, minority cabinet, minority administration, or a minority parliament is a government and cabinet formed in a parliamentary system when a political party or coalition of parties does not have a majority of overall seats in the legislature. It is sworn into office, with or without the formal support of other parties, enabling a government to be formed. Under such a government, legislation can only be passed with the support or consent of enough other members of the legislature to provide a majority, encouraging multi-partisanship. In bicameral legislatures, the term relates to the situation in the chamber whose confidence is considered most crucial to the continuance in office of the government (generally, the lower house).

A minority government tends to be less stable than a majority government because, if they can unite, opposing parliamentary members have sufficient numbers to vote against legislation, or even bring down the government with a vote of no confidence. If, however, the minority government forms supporting partnerships with some parliamentary parties, it can be as stable as majority governments.

== Coalitions and alliances ==
To deal with situations in parliamentary systems where no clear majority to form a government exists, two or more parties may establish a formal coalition government, commanding a clear majority of the parliamentary members. A party might also enter into less formal alliances or agreements with other parties or individual members to allow the minority government to stay in office.

A common situation is a governance with &quot;jumping majorities&quot;, where the cabinet stays as long as it can negotiate support from a majority in the parliament, even though that majority may be differently formed from issue to issue or bill to bill. On occasion, the legislature may permit a minority cabinet to continue in office despite having been defeated on a given vote, and a minority government might even bring on a confidence vote and threaten to resign should the legislature vote against it.

An alternative arrangement is a looser alliance of parties, exemplified by Sweden. There the long-governing Social Democrats have ruled with more or less formal support from other parties – in the mid-20th century from Agrarians, after 1968 from Communists, and more recently from Greens and ex-Communists – and have thus been able to retain executive power and (in practice) legislative initiative. This is also common in Canada, where nine elections from 1921 to 2005 effectively produced minority federal governments. The parties can rarely cooperate enough to establish a formal coalition but operate under a loose agreement instead.

Occasionally, a confidence and supply agreement may be formed. This is a more formal pact that still falls short of creating a coalition government. In the Canadian province of Ontario, the Liberal Party formed a minority government from 1985 to 1987 on the basis of a formal accord with the New Democratic Party (NDP): the NDP agreed to support the Liberals for two years on all confidence motions and budgetary legislation, in exchange for the passage of certain legislative measures proposed by the NDP. This was not a formal coalition, because the NDP remained an opposition party and was not given seats in the cabinet. In this case, the Liberals did not even have a plurality of seats: the Progressive Conservatives were the largest single party with 52 seats, whereas the Liberals had 48 and the NDP had 25.

New Zealand&#x27;s 48th Parliament operated with both a coalition and a looser agreement: the government was a coalition between the Labour Party and the Progressives, while United Future and New Zealand First had an agreement to support the government on confidence matters, while the Green Party abstained.

=== Simple plurality system ===
In most Westminster system nations, each constituency elects one member of parliament by simple plurality voting. This system heavily biases the vote towards increasing the number of seats of the top two parties and reducing the seats of smaller parties, a principle known in political science as Duverger&#x27;s law, and thus minority governments are relatively uncommon. Advocates of this system see this as one of its advantages. A party with less than 40% of the popular vote can often win an outright majority of the seats. (For instance, in the 2005 UK General Election, the governing Labour party won by a majority of 66 seats in the House of Commons with only 35.2% of the popular vote.) If support for some parties is regionally concentrated, however, then Duverger&#x27;s law applies separately to each region, and so no party can be sufficiently dominant in each region to receive a majority of the seats. This was the situation in Canada in the 2004, 2006, 2008, 2019, and 2021 federal elections, with no party obtaining a majority due in part to the dominance of the Bloc Québécois in the province of Quebec.

In Westminster systems, in minority situations, the incumbent government usually has the first opportunity to attempt to win the confidence of the House. This is so even if the incumbents have fewer seats – the incumbent prime minister still holds their commission for the duration of the writ period and immediately following an election. If they cannot form a government that commands the confidence of the House then it is expected that they will resign that commission voluntarily – it is not considered acceptable for the Sovereign (or his representative) to revoke said commission unless the prime minister was acting in serious breach of constitutional protocol. Nevertheless, usually, an incumbent government that loses its plurality in the House simply resigns, especially if the main opposition party is only a few seats short of having a majority or if it feels it has no chance of winning the support of enough members of smaller parties to win an initial confidence vote.

Nevertheless, the now-common practice of the party with the most seats forming the government has led to a widespread misconception among voters that a convention exists whereby the party with the most seats always gets to form the government. In fact, the most compelling reason for this practice is that the party with the most seats can survive confidence votes so long as smaller party (or parties) simply abstain from confidence votes, whereas a governing party without a plurality in the House needs at least one other party to vote with it at all times (assuming the largest party will always vote no confidence, but that is almost certain to occur when they are denied the opportunity to govern). This means that in most situations, the party with the most seats has the best chance and the least complicated route to winning a confidence vote, regardless of its place on the political spectrum.

At the Canadian federal level, in the four most recent of the five occasions a governing party lost the plurality without another winning a majority (1957, 1963, 1979, and 2006), the incumbent governments resigned rather than attempt to stay in power.

Whatever party forms the government must either form a coalition with one or more other parties, or they must win some form of support from the other parties or independents so as to avoid no-confidence motions. Because of no-confidence motions, minority governments are frequently short-lived or fall before their term is expired. The leader of a minority government will also often call an election in hopes of winning a stronger mandate from the electorate. In Canada, for instance, federal minority governments last an average of 18 months.

=== Australia ===
The unprecedentedly close 2010 Australian federal election produced a federal minority government in Australia for the first time since 1940. The Labor Party and Coalition both won 72 seats, 4 short of a majority. Labor won the two-party preferred vote by 0.24%. Six crossbenchers, consisting of four independents, one Greens MP, and one WA Nationals MP, held the balance of power. Ultimately, four crossbenchers gave confidence and supply to Labor, allowing them to form an extremely narrow minority government. This government stood until the 2013 election.

After the 2016 federal election, the Coalition formed a majority government of just one seat. They lost their majority after the 2018 leadership spill which deposed Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull, as National Party MP Kevin Hogan moved to the crossbench. The government lost another seat after the 2018 Wentworth by-election, which was won by independent Kerryn Phelps. They lost another seat after MP Julia Banks resigned from the Liberal Party, reducing the government to 73 seats. However, they retained confidence from all three MPs, enabling them to remain in government.

=== Belgium ===
Belgium is not unfamiliar with minority governments. Moreover, this type of government is not explicitly provided for in the Constitution, even though the Constitution does not prevent its existence. More often than not, minority governments emerge following elections when the government that was in power loses its majority and has to become a caretaker government pending the formation of a new government.

==== Legal grounds ====
In Belgium, it is the King who appoints the government. However, as Belgium is a democratic state, constitutional custom requires that this appointment must be approved by the Chamber of Representatives, the democratically elected body. This consent is given by a vote of confidence. There is, however, a small constitutional trick, since the majority required to obtain confidence is not calculated on the basis of all the members of parliament, but on the basis of the votes cast. As the specialist on minority governments in Belgium, Lucien Rigaux, points out, this means that the majority is calculated on the basis of the members present and does not require more than 76 votes (the majority of the 150 seats in the Chamber). Moreover, confidence is obtained if there are more votes in favour than against. For example, out of 100 votes cast, a minority government can be invested with 40 affirmative votes, 20 negative votes and 40 abstentions. The abstention of parties that, for various reasons, do not wish to enter the government thus makes it possible to form an emergency government with full powers and democratic legitimacy.

==== History ====
Never in the federated entities has a minority government been formed spontaneously. On the other hand, at the central and then federal state level, there have been five attempts to form a minority government. Three of these attempts were transformed. As Lucien Rigaux points out in an issue devoted to the history of minority governments in Belgium: &quot;The first two attempts were failures. In 1925, the Liberals experienced an electoral debacle. They preferred to stay away from a government majority. The Catholic Party and the Belgian Workers&#x27; Party each won approximately 40 percent of the seats so they could not govern alone. However, within the Catholic Party, there remains serious reluctance to collaborate with the Socialists. It must be said that strong tensions between the two camps, particularly over the Flemishisation of the Ghent University and the management of external affairs, had led to the fall of the homogeneous Catholic government. After 38 days of caretaker government – which was relatively long for the time – the King appointed a Catholic cabinet. The latter was finally nipped in the bud by Parliament since the latter decided not to grant its confidence because the proposed Catholic coalition did not respect &quot;Flemish national law&quot;, that it &quot;was not qualified to resolve the difficulties of the parliamentary situation&quot; and that it did not make it possible to fight the bourgeoisie&quot;.

In 1946, the government of national unity, which followed World War II, had already served its purpose. The Liberals felt that their new electoral defeat invited them to undergo an opposition cure. Socialists and Catholics clashed during the election campaign over the royal question of the return of King Leopold III to Belgium, which made the political climate particularly tense. The Socialists reject the invitation of the Catholic informer to form a government because the former want to associate the Communists, who have obtained a better result than the Liberal Party, with the government, while the Catholic Party categorically refuses to do so. After a month of political crisis, a cabinet composed solely of socialists is appointed by the King. In the parliamentary gallery, the then Prime Minister, Paul-Henri Spaak, declared: &quot;if you think you can quickly give the country a government other than the one before you, stronger, based on a stable majority, do not hesitate, overthrow us. But if you don&#x27;t have that assurance, if you foresee, after a negative vote, a long period of hesitation, conciliations, abortive attempts, then think carefully about what you are going to do&quot;. He nevertheless succumbs a few days later, since with as many votes in his favour as against him, he does not enjoy the confidence of Parliament. The defeat must have been all the more difficult to swallow as two Socialist MEPs had left before the vote in order not to miss their train to Liège.

On the other hand, the last three attempts were successful.

Firstly in 1958 a minority government received, for the first time, the support of Parliament. The Social Christian Party obtained a remarkable score that had nothing to envy to its results of the 19th century with 104 seats out of 212. However, the government&#x27;s formation patinated notably on the school question which pitted Catholics and lay people against each other and which related to the financing of Catholic and public schools. Both the socialists and the liberals have the impression that they are playing a fool&#x27;s game where the lowest bidder will have the chance to claim a few positions in a government that will carry out the entire Christian program. The Christian Social Party then tries to capitalize on its 104 seats to gain confidence. Contrary to all expectations, the abstention of one Volksunie member and two Liberals was enough to gain the confidence of Parliament. The Eyskens II minority government thus received the support of a relative majority of the members present, 106 in favour and 104 against. A few months later, the minority government became a majority government when the Liberal Party joined the government team after an agreement was reached on the school issue.

Then, in 1974, the political context was that of the state reforms initiated in 1970. Community autonomy was achieved, but the implementation of regionalisation was at a standstill, in particular because the Brussels dossier was repeatedly put on ice. Fifteen days after the elections of 10 March 1974, Léo Tindemans (CVP) was appointed formator. He is entering into negotiations with the Liberals and the Socialists to form a government that can benefit from a broad parliamentary base. While the liberals seem to be acquiescing, the negotiations with the socialists reveal divergences, mainly on the implementation of regionalisation, on the question of state interference in economic affairs and on the method of &quot;community to community&quot; negotiation involving so-called community parties rather than political families. The socialists, who had campaigned strongly on the left, decided in the Namur Congress to withdraw from the negotiations and denounced the formation of a &quot;coalition of the rights&quot;. Not giving up on forming a large majority, the social-Christian and liberal political families negotiated with the community parties. A partial agreement is reached in Steenokkerzeel. For the Walloon Rally as long as there is no agreement on everything, there is no agreement on anything. Nevertheless, it decides to grant its benevolent abstentions to the Christian Liberal coalition so that a government can be formed quickly. With 100 votes in favour, 63 against and, above all, 47 abstentions, the minority Tindemans I government won the confidence of the House and the Senate five days later. The Walloon Rally also joined the coalition, which became a majority a few months later.

Finally, the last successful attempt was made in 2020 to fight the COVID-19 crisis. While the negotiations have been stalled since the last elections on 26 May 2019, the coronavirus crisis has brought down the cards. A sort of national union to which the N-VA does not, however, adhere, the Vlaams Belang and the PTB decided to give its confidence to the Wilmès II government in order to give it full powers and, above all, democratic legitimacy to deal with the health crisis.

==== Advantages and disadvantages ====
As with day-to-day business, the minority government provides a flexible institutional response in times of crisis that allows the state to continue to function and to be able to carry out its essential tasks. However, unlike a majority government, the action of a minority government is not locked to current affairs, day-to-day business or urgent decisions. It benefits from the fullness of its competences since it is constituted on the basis of a democratic decision which grants it de facto a certain democratic legitimacy.

The main disadvantage of minority government by the elected assembly is that it can be instituted without a majority of the members of Parliament having voted in favour of it, but that, on the other hand, a majority of the members of the assembly is required to dismiss it (76 minimum).

===Canada===

Minority governments can occur in the federal Parliament of Canada, and the legislatures of most provinces and territories except the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, which have non-partisan legislatures and operate as a consensus government.

During the history of federal Canadian politics, there have been fifteen minority governments, in fourteen separate minority parliaments. Federal minority governments typically last less than two years. Exceptions to this include the 26th, 27th, 39th and 40th Canadian parliaments, which all lasted for longer than two years. The 14th Canadian Parliament functioned as a minority government for half of its duration, owing to floor-crossings and by-elections. The 15th Canadian Parliament was the only federal minority parliament that saw two different minority governments form. The most recent minority parliament elected at the federal level is the 44th Canadian Parliament, whose composition was determined in September 2021.

Minority governments also occur in all provincial legislatures, as well as the Yukon Legislative Assembly. However, minority governments do not occur as frequently in these legislatures as they do at the federal level. Ontario has seen six minority legislatures in its political history, the most among the 10 provinces and the territory of Yukon. Alberta is the only province that has never had a minority government in its provincial legislature.

While minority governments may occur in Canadian politics, the formation of a formal coalitions is rare, with past minority governments relying on cooperation and confidence and supply arrangements to govern instead. Historically, several coalition governments have formed in the 1840s and 1850s, in the Parliament of the Province of Canada. The formation of the Great Coalition in 1864 eventually led to Canadian Confederation in 1867. Since Canadian Confederation, only one wartime coalition between the Conservatives and Liberals has formed in federal Canadian politics in 1917. Coalition governments have occurred more frequently in provincial legislatures, with several provincial coalition governments having been formed in the 20th and 21st century.

===Denmark===
Denmark has a rich tradition of minority governments. Despite the country&#x27;s electoral system of proportional representation, which almost always results in the winning party coming nowhere near a majority, single-party minority governments are still a regular occurrence in Danish politics.

Since 1982 even most of multi-party coalition governments in Denmark are minority ones; thus, the government of the day is still required to make deals with non-governing parties. More often small far-left or far-right parties provide confidence support of centre-left or centre-right coalition governments led by Social Democrats or Venstre. For many years, Danish politics has been divided into &quot;Red&quot; and &quot;Blue&quot; blocs, whose parliamentarians are typically expected to support Social Democratic and Venstre cabinets, respectively.

The Frederiksen Cabinet elected in the 2019 Danish general election is a single-party minority government of the Social Democrats (who received about 25% of the vote in the previous election) supported by three other parties; the previous cabinet, Lars Løkke Rasmussen III, was a three-party minority coalition led by Venstre and supported by the Danish People&#x27;s Party. An earlier cabinet of Rasmussen&#x27;s, Lars Løkke Rasmussen II, was a single-party Venstre minority government, a particularly notable feat, as Venstre only received about 20% of the vote in the election, finishing third.

===Estonia===
Estonia has had several minority governments. A minority cabinet can occur:

# when the governing coalition loses support due to a coalition member leaving the governing coalition (Vähi II and Ansip II cabinets);
# when the Prime Minister asks the ministers of a coalition party to be relieved of their duties (Kaja Kallas cabinet);
# when MPs leave party factions (Ratas cabinet);
# when a minority government is appointed with additional parliamentary support (Tõnisson IV, Vähi Interim, Siimann and Siim Kallas cabinets); or
# when the government is voted into office with a plurality and some MPs abstain from voting (Birk, Tõnisson II, Piip and Akel cabinets).

Additional support is possible also because MPs leaving a party faction are not allowed to officially join another faction until the next elections. A government can be a minority government either throughout its term or just a part of its term, usually the latter. A list of minority cabinets:

* A. Birk cabinet (1920)
* J. Tõnisson II cabinet (1920)
* A. Piip cabinet (1920–1921)
* F. K. Akel cabinet (1924)
* J. Tõnisson IV cabinet (1933)
* T. Vähi Interim cabinet (1992)
* T. Vähi II cabinet (1996–1997)
* M. Siimann cabinet (1997–1999)
* S. Kallas cabinet (2002–2003)
* A. Ansip II cabinet (2009–2011)
* J. Ratas cabinet (2018–2019)
* K. Kallas I cabinet (2022)
=== France ===
Since the joint establishment of the Fifth Republic and of the two-round system for parliamentary elections in 1958, France has known only a few minority governments: indeed, the majoritarian electoral system usually produces seizable parliamentary majorities on which governments can rely, but there are some exceptions. Since 1958, only 3 out of 16 legislative elections resulted in a hung parliament: the 1988, 2022 and 2024 elections. In both instances, minority governments were formed following the elections, with no formal coalition or confidence-and-supply agreement being put in place to guarantee stability.

In fact, the French Constitution provides a large number of institutional tools to ensure political stability at the detriment of parliamentary sovereignty, constitutional tools that become critical when the executive power has to govern in minority:

* Article 44: allows the government to reject proposed amendments that have not been discussed in committee prior to the general discussion (44 paragraph 2); allows the government to ask for a parliamentary chamber to vote on the entirety or a part of a bill while overturning all amendments that have not been proposed or sponsored by the ministers (44 paragraph 3);
* Articles 47 and 47-1: if Parliament has not voted on the Government Budget (47) or the Social Security Budget (47-1) within the constitutional time limit (70 days for the Government Budget, 50 days for the Social Security Budget), then the government can implement its budget by decrees;
* Article 49: allows the government the possibility to avoid a vote of confidence on its program or general policy declaration in the lower house (49 paragraph 1); requires the absolute majority of the lower house&#x27;s entire membership to pass a motion of no confidence (49 paragraph 2); allows the government to &quot;commit its responsibility&quot; on a bill per parliamentary session (apart from Government and Social Security budgets on which this special power can be used without numerical limit), the bill is considered passed without a vote unless a no-confidence motion is adopted by the lower house, thus effectively treating the bill as an issue of a vote of confidence (49 paragraph 3/49.3)
These are the six minority governments in the history of France&#x27;s Fifth Republic as of 2024:
The previous Borne government was a three-party minority coalition government as result of the June 2022 parliamentary elections that saw President Macron&#x27;s coalition lose its parliamentary majority in the National Assembly, going from a 115-seat majority to a hung parliament in which the centrist presidential coalition was the largest bloc but 38 short of an overall majority. The Borne cabinet survived to 31ss motions of no confidence and Prime Minister Borne triggered constitutional article 49.3 23 times, mostly to pass the 2023 Government and Social Security Budgets but also to pass its pension system reform in March 2023. Nonetheless, the government lost several parliamentary votes, an oddity under the Fifth Republic.

===Germany===
Minority government is unusual in Germany, though it was more common historically during the German Empire and the Weimar Republic. In the Federal Republic (since 1949), the constructive vote of no confidence theoretically grants minority governments a high degree of longevity, but they are rare in practice. No minority government has ever been invested on the federal level, though brief periods of minority government have existed when a government has lost its majority mid-term. Minority governments have also existed at the state level, sometimes for substantial periods. The viability of minority government varies between states, as some require an absolute majority vote by parliament for a government to be invested, while others require only a simple majority or plurality.

Between 1949 and December 2017, there were 31 periods of minority government in Germany, including four at the federal and 27 at the state level. All four federal instances were the result of an incumbent government losing its majority: the fourth Adenauer cabinet after the withdrawal of the FDP; the second Erhard cabinet, also after the withdrawal of the FDP; the first Brandt cabinet after parliamentary defections; and the third Schmidt cabinet after the dismissal of the FDP. Of these, only the second Erhard and third Schmidt cabinets are considered &quot;true&quot; minority governments, as the fourth Adenauer cabinet was quickly dissolved and replaced by the fifth Adenauer cabinet, and the first Brandt cabinet retained a technical majority due to the Bundestag delegation from Berlin. Erhard and Schmidt&#x27;s minority governments were short-lived, lasting less than a month, and both ended with the Chancellor leaving office.

Between 1949 and December 2017, nine different states had at least one period of minority government, with some having as many as four. Compared to the federal level, state-level minority governments usually survived much longer, lasting an average of 333 days. The longest was the two SPD-led minority governments of Reinhold Höppner in Saxony-Anhalt, which served two complete terms (1,452 and 1,406 days, respectively) between 1994 and 2002. These governments, enabled by the abstention of the PDS during confidence votes, were dubbed the &quot;Magdeburger model&quot;. However, most minority governments still resulted from the loss of a majority – on 13 occasions due to the withdrawal of a coalition partner, on 12 occasions due to defeat in an election, and on four occasions due to parliamentary defections. Only seven minority governments were formed on a &quot;tolerance&quot; basis similar to the Magdeburger model. Furthermore, only two minority governments lasted more than a single term: the aforementioned Höppner governments in Saxony-Anhalt, and from 1982 to 1983 and 1983–85 in Hesse, when the Greens tolerated two consecutive SPD minority governments (this arrangement ended in 1985 when the SPD and Greens entered into coalition.)

Other examples of a minority government on a state level include the first government of Klaus Wowereit in Berlin, comprising a minority coalition of the SPD and Greens supported by the PDS, which was invested after a corruption scandal led to the collapse of the previous CDU government; it served on an interim basis from June 2001 until the October state election. The first government of Hannelore Kraft in North Rhine-Westphalia, comprising a coalition of the SPD and Greens tolerated by The Left, was formed after the 2010 state election and served until the 2012 election. The second government of Bodo Ramelow in Thuringia, a coalition of The Left, SPD, and Greens, was invested with the tolerance of the CDU to resolve the 2020 Thuringian government crisis.

===Ireland===
The Irish parliamentary system broadly works on a simple majority system, where the Taoiseach is elected by the Dáil when they achieve 50% + 1 of the votes in favour of their nomination. The Taoiseach then appoints the members of the government with the approval of the Dáil. Since the 1980s, the popularity of other parties has increased such that coalition governments are now typical and expected, with one of the two major parties being the senior partner, and with one or more junior partners ensuring that the coalition retains a majority in the Dáil.

A minority government is formed when a party (or a coalition) secures agreement from one or more other parties or independent TDs who are not members of the government to support their nomination for Taoiseach and achieve majority support. Support for bills and other items requiring a Dáil majority vote is then negotiated on a bill-by-bill basis.

If no agreement can be reached to nominate an individual to lead a government, the outgoing Taoiseach (continuing to act in a caretaker capacity) can seek dissolution of the Dáil and call a new general election. However, this circumstance has not occurred to date.

The last Dáil with a single-party simple majority government was the 21st Dáil elected at the 1977 general election. Fifteen of the 32 governments in Irish history were minority governments, most of which were formed by Fianna Fáil.

* 1922
* 1923
* June 1927
* September 1927
* 1932 (Fianna Fáil)
* 1933 (Fianna Fáil)
* 1937 (Fianna Fáil)
* 1943 (Fianna Fáil)
* 1951 (Fianna Fáil)
* 1961 (Fianna Fáil)
* 1981 (Fine Gael–Labour Party)
* February 1982 (Fianna Fáil)
* 1987 (Fianna Fáil)
* 1997 (Fianna Fáil–Progressive Democrats)
* 2016 (Fine Gael)
===Netherlands===
Coalitions in the Netherlands are formed with the support from parliamentary parties, elected by proportional representation. Although very rare, minority governments can be formed during the formation period of a Dutch cabinet, if an election result makes a majority coalition impossible. More often, a minority government is formed when one of the cabinet&#x27;s coalition partners withdraws its support, or when all ministers of a given parliamentary party resign. In these cases, the Prime Minister offers the full cabinet&#x27;s resignation to the Dutch Monarch.

At this point, the Monarch may choose to dissolve Parliament and hold a general election. The cabinet continues to serve as &quot;demissionary&quot;. A demissionary cabinet is not a minority government but a form of caretaker government, enjoying only limited powers until the new Parliament assembles.

If the Monarch does not dissolve Parliament, the remaining cabinet continues as a minority cabinet, in full possession of its powers. It can finish any legislation already before underpreparation, if Parliament passes it by majority vote; this necessitates the support of parties outside the government. Theoretically, early general elections need not be held, but they are often necessary in practice, since the coalition agreement no longer has parliamentary support.

A third option is available to the Monarch: the formation of a new cabinet of different Parliamentary parties (which may include the defecting coalition partner). Elections are then held as scheduled at the end of the parliamentary term, since the Monarch does not dissolve parliament if an &quot;informateur&quot; has been able to negotiate a new coalition agreement.

The Netherlands had a minority government in 2010–2012: the First Rutte cabinet. This government was supported in parliament by the Party For Freedom, which all together provided the government a majority. The Second Rutte cabinet (2012–2017) consisted of the conservative liberal VVD and the social-democratic PvdA and had a majority in the &quot;House of Representatives&quot;, but a plurality in the &quot;Senate&quot;. On 11 October 2013, the cabinet reached a budgetary agreement with the social-liberal D66 and the smaller Christian parties CU and SGP. This provided the VVD/PvdA cabinet a single-seat majority in the &quot;Senate&quot; (&quot;see also&quot;: Purple (government)).

===Norway===
As of January 20, 2020 Norway has a minority government. In the beginning of 2019, the Christian Democratic party KrF joined Erna Solberg&#x27;s cabinet, that had been ruling with a minority since 2013, to form a majority. On January 20, 2020, the Progress party, FrP, announced that they would withdraw from their role in government, and become an opposition party, despite continuing their support of Erna Solberg as Prime Minister.

Norway has had multiple minority governments throughout history, including cabinets led by John Lyng, Kjell Magne Bondevik, and Jens Stoltenberg.

===Singapore===
In the Legislative Assembly elections held on 2nd April 1955, the LF emerged as the single largest party with 10 seats of the 25 seats. David Marshall formed a minority government with the support of UMNO, MCA, and the Malay Union. Marshall&#x27;s successor Lim Yew Hock led this minority government till its electoral defeat in 1959.

In the elections held on 30th May 1959, the PAP led by Lee Kuan Yew won in a landslide. They secured 43 of the 51 available seats and trounced the incumbent SPA government of Lim Yew Hock. However, this majority was short-lived. In July 1960, then Minister for National Development Ong Eng Guan resigned as Minister and from the ruling PAP, along with two other members. This brought PAP&#x27;s strength to 40. In July 1961, 14 left-wing members of the PAP were expelled for failing to vote for the PAP in a motion of confidence brought by Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew. This led to PAP&#x27;s tally in the Assembly to fall to 26 - a one-seat majority. This one-seat majority was lost in July 1962 with one defection to the newly formed Barisan Sosialis. On 16th August 1962, the PAP regained this one-seat majority with a defection from Ong Eng Guan&#x27;s new created UPP. This did not last long and five days later, PAP lost its majority when then Minister for Labour Ahmad Ibrahim died suddenly. From then until the 1963 election, the PAP governed in the minority with 25 of the 51 seats. 

With the PAP winning the 1963 elections with more than a two-thirds majority, and subsequently dominating parliament with the resultant by-elections and general elections, 1963 would mark the last time Singapore witnessed a minority government.

===Sweden===
Sweden has had several minority governments, most of the time led by the Swedish Social Democratic Party, with the support of the Socialist Left Party until 2006. The centre-right Alliance, then led by the Moderate Party, formed a minority coalition government from 2010 to 2014. The recent minority coalition government is led by the Moderate Party, which is supported by Sweden Democrats.

=== United Kingdom ===
There have been many occasions since 1900 when a single party has not commanded a parliamentary majority, although the 2010–2015 Conservative/Liberal Democrat coalition government was the first formal coalition of its type in Britain since the National Government between 1931 and 1945. Westminster and the British media tend to perceive minority governments as unstable and ineffective, as they causes problems such as governments lacking the strength to pass legislation, vulnerability to a motion of no confidence and the necessity for a coalition government which would result in policy compromises and a diluted political agenda. Coalition governments could also be viewed as unstable possibly due to examples of minority governments (Callaghan and Major) occurring as the result of governments in decline. Examples of minority governments include:

==== Harold Wilson (1974–1979) ====
The Labour Party, led by Harold Wilson, formed a minority government for seven months after the General Election of February 1974. That situation lasted until the prime minister called another election in October that year, following which the Labour Government obtained a small majority of three. The following administration also became a minority government after the collapse of the Lib-Lab pact in 1978, and the then British Prime Minister James Callaghan&#x27;s Government fell in March 1979 as the result of a vote of no confidence which was carried by a single vote.

==== John Major (1996–1997) ====
A minority Government held power in the UK between December 1996 and the general election in May 1997. The Conservative Party, led by John Major, had won the 1992 General Election with an absolute majority of 21 seats over all other parties. That majority was progressively whittled away through defections and by-elections defeat, the most notable of the latter including those in Newbury, South East Staffordshire and Wirral South, resulting in the eventual loss of the Major government&#x27;s majority in Parliament. However, the Conservatives maintained support from Northern Ireland&#x27;s Ulster Unionist Party and Democratic Unionist Party.

==== David Cameron (2010–2015) ====
In the 2010 General Election, the Conservatives won the most seats and votes, but only a minority of seats in parliament. There was some discussion after the election of the possibility of creating a Conservative minority government and, because the then Prime Minister Gordon Brown had the first opportunity to form a government, there were also talks about creating some sort of alliance between the Labour Party, the Liberal Democrats and the other smaller parties. However Brown waived his right, acknowledging that because the Conservative Party had won the largest number of seats in the House of Commons, it should have the first opportunity to form a government. Further discussions then led to the establishment of a formal coalition between the Conservatives and the Liberal Democrats, which enabled the formation of a majority government, because it was thought that would ensure more stability.

==== Theresa May (2017–2019) ====
In 2016, Theresa May took over from David Cameron as Prime Minister, after he resigned as a result of the Brexit referendum, when the UK voted to leave the EU. May decided to call a snap election in 2017 to strengthen her hand in the Brexit negotiations. In the 2017 General Election, the Conservatives won the most seats and votes but lost their majority in the House of Commons, which instead weakened their hand in the Brexit negotiations. The Conservative Party, led by Theresa May, formed a minority government, with 317 seats, on 9 June 2017. On 10 June, the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office announced a deal with the Democratic Unionist Party which would see the DUP support the Conservative government on a confidence and supply arrangement. However, the DUP later announced that no such deal had been reached. This remained the case until 26 June 2017, when a deal was agreed and announced between the two parties.

==== Boris Johnson (2019) ====
After Theresa May resigned in May 2019, Boris Johnson became the new party leader and Prime Minister. For much of the Johnson Ministry up until the 2019 general election; the government was a minority government. The suspension of the whip of 21 Conservative MPs on 24 July 2019 resulted in the government being 43 seats short of a working majority. The government lost several Parliamentary votes in the autumn of 2019 before a general election was called. Johnson gained the Conservatives&#x27; biggest majority since Margaret Thatcher was Prime Minister in 1987 after the 2019 United Kingdom general election, ending this run of minority governments.

====Scotland====
=====2007=====

After the 2007 general election, the Scottish National Party led by Alex Salmond formed a minority government in the Scottish Parliament.

The SNP had won 47 seats out of 129 in the election, some way short of an absolute majority of seats in the Scottish Parliament, but more than any other single party gained. The SNP were unable to negotiate a majority coalition government with any other party, but as no other combination of parties were able to agree on a deal, the SNP chose to form a one-party minority government. They often negotiated with confidence and supply support from the Scottish Green Party and the Scottish Conservative Party to pass certain legislation.

=====2016=====

After the 2016 general election, The SNP won 63 out of 129 seats in the Scottish Parliament, losing their governing majority they won in 2011, but they went on to form a one-party minority government, led by Nicola Sturgeon. Throughout the parliamentary term, they informally co-operated with the Scottish Green Party.

=====2021-2024=====

Following the 2021 general election, the Scottish National Party fell one seat short of an overall majority. They went on to form another minority government, led by Nicola Sturgeon. The SNP then formed a coalition government with the Scottish Greens in August 2021, lifting Sturgeon&#x27;s third government out of minority status.

On 25 April 2024, First Minister Humza Yousaf suspended the power sharing agreement with the Scottish Greens resulting in an SNP minority government.

John Swinney won the Scottish National Party leadership election and formed a minority government.

====Wales====
After the 2007 Assembly election, the Welsh Labour Party led by Rhodri Morgan initially formed a minority government in the National Assembly of Wales. This was because they gained 26 seats in the election, which was short of an absolute majority of seats in the Assembly. Whilst Labour were initially unable to form a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, a &#x27;Rainbow Coalition&#x27; of the Conservative Party (UK), Liberal Democrats and Plaid Cymru failed to come to fruition. However, on 6 July 2007, Welsh Labour Party members voted for a coalition with Plaid, which was followed by a similar result from Plaid Cymru members the next day. As a result, the Welsh Assembly was controlled by the Labour-Plaid alliance with Rhodri Morgan as First Minister (up until his retirement in 2009 and subsequent replacement by Carwyn Jones as First Minister) and Plaid Leader Ieuan Wyn Jones as his deputy. After the 2011 Welsh General Election, Welsh Labour won 30 seats and entered into a new government, one seat short of an overall majority. In 2016 Welsh Labour returned with 29 seats out of 30 and formed a government with the one remaining Liberal Democrat AM, again one seat short of an overall majority. A minority government was also formed following the 2021 Senedd election, when Welsh Labour returned 30 seats, half of the legislature&#x27;s available 60, but one short of a working majority (31), yet no coalition government was formed, with Labour relying on bipartisanship (minimally 1 extra vote from a non-Labour seat) for the passing of any legislation.

<doc id="271442" wikidata="Q1070604" url="?curid=271442" title="Chesil Beach">
<text>Chesil Beach (also known as Chesil Bank) in Dorset, England is one of three major shingle beach structures in Britain. Its name is derived from the word &quot;&quot; (Old English or ), meaning &quot;gravel&quot; or &quot;shingle&quot;. It runs for a length of from West Bay to the Isle of Portland and in places is up to high and wide. Behind the beach is the Fleet, a shallow tidal lagoon. Both are part of the Jurassic Coast and a UNESCO World Heritage Site, and together form an SSSI and Ramsar Site. Owners of the land designated as &quot;Chesil &amp; The Fleet&quot; SSSI include the Crown Estate, the Ministry of Defence and the National Trust.

The beach is almost entirely made of stone shingle, and the typical size of stones reduces steadily and sharply along the length of the beach. The beach is often identified as a tombolo, although research into the geomorphology of the area has revealed that it is in fact a barrier beach which has &quot;rolled&quot; landwards, joining the mainland with the Isle of Portland and giving the appearance of a tombolo.

The beach curves sharply at the eastern end, near the village of Chiswell, and forms Chesil Cove against the cliffs of the Isle of Portland, and this protects the low-lying village from flooding. It has been the scene of many shipwrecks and was named &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Bay&quot; by Thomas Hardy. The beach provides shelter from the prevailing winds and waves for the town of Weymouth, Dorset and the village of Chiswell on Portland.

Simon Jenkins rates the view of Chesil Beach from Abbotsbury along the coast to Portland Bill as one of the top ten in England.

==Origin==

The origin of Chesil Beach has been argued over for some time. Originally it was believed that beach material was from the Budleigh Salterton pebble beds to the west and later from Portland to the south east. The differences between the pebbles on the beach and nearby sources is now put down to the Flandrian isostatic sea level rise, so the feature could also be considered a barrier beach or bar, that happens to connect the mainland to an island rather than a &#x27;true&#x27; tombolo. Normally, tombolos are created due to the effects of the island on waves (through refraction) and to sediment transport, which usually produces a beach perpendicular to the mainland rather than parallel to it.

==History==

There have been many shipwrecks on Chesil Beach, particularly during the age of sail. The beach was particularly dangerous within the English Channel, as it forms an extended lee shore during south-westerly gales. A ship coming up the Channel had to clear Portland Bill to be safe, but the wind and tide would be pushing it northwards into Lyme Bay. When sailing ships were common, a strong string of coastguards were based along the beach, with lookouts and cottages at Chiswell, Wyke Regis, Chickerell, Langton Herring, Abbotsbury, East Bexington, Burton Bradstock and West Bay. At present there are no manned Coastguard lookouts along the beach, with coverage provided when required from the National Maritime Operations Centre based at Fareham. However, their observational role has been taken over by the National Coastwatch Institution, who have lookouts at Burton Bradstock (operational 2010) and Charmouth (operational 2016).

The local fishermen, particularly at Portland, developed a purpose-built vessel to withstand the sea actions of Chesil Beach. The boat, known as a lerret, is a double-ended open fishing boat — long — used for seine net fishing. It is usually rowed by four people with a fifth to steer and deploy the net.

Much of the villages of Fleet and Chiswell were destroyed in the Great Storm of 1824. Over the centuries Chiswell had battled with the sea and was regularly flooded during rough winter storms. In the storms the sea would pour through the upper part of the bank, and for this reason plans to drain the Fleet were abandoned in 1630. The great storm of November 1824 struck the village with disastrous results - an event from which Chiswell would never fully recover. Since then various defences have been set-up to aid the village, notably the sea wall and promenade which commenced work in 1958, and was completed in 1965.

The Weymouth to Portland Railway line was opened in 1865, and built along the southern end of the beach. It closed to passengers in 1952 and finally closed to all traffic in 1965. The line included a viaduct across Ferry Bridge. Over the last 150 years there have been a number of proposals to build a line from Weymouth to Bridport running the length of Chesil Beach. A line was built from Upwey to Abbotsbury but could not be continued through lack of money. A line was also built from Maiden Newton to Bridport and then onwards to West Bay. A more recent proposal was to build a light railway between Weymouth and West Bay.

A rifle range, built around 1907, is situated on Chesil Beach, near Ferry Bridge. It had 100 yard increments up to 800 yards, and some remains of this structure can still be seen today. The Royal Navy operated a minesweeping trials range off West Bexington for many years following World War II. It was abandoned in the mid-1980s. The cables came ashore under the beach at the West Bexington car park, and today the range control building can still be seen behind the car park, while one of the theodolite stations is located near the entrance to the Cogden Beach car park.

===Second World War defences===

The beach and the Fleet were used as an experimental bombing range by the RAF before and during World War II because of the low population density of nearby areas, as well as their proximity to the naval base on Portland. The beach was also used for machine gun training and &quot;Highball&quot; bouncing bomb testing during the war.

A double row of anti-tank blocks divides the beach near Abbotsbury, where the Fleet Lagoon begins. Most of the seaward blocks have been destroyed, but the parallel lines of blocks on the landward side still survive in good condition. Within the same spot are two remaining Type 26 pillboxes. They were constructed in 1940 and were situated within the Abbotsbury Defence area. An anti-tank ditch was located within this area behind Chesil Beach. An observation post still exists on the landward side of the Fleet, with the open front facing Chesil Beach.

The portion of the beach to the east of the anti-tank division in front of Fleet Lagoon had no passive defences against a landing, whereas the beach to the west was protected with miles of Admiralty scaffolding, with anti-tank ditches and minefields and flame fougasse installations a little farther inland.

==The Fleet Lagoon==

From West Bay to Cliff End the beach is piled up against the cliff. At Cliff End a hollow forms behind the beach and at Abbotsbury a stretch of saline (or brackish) water called the Fleet Lagoon begins. This is up to 3m in depth. The Fleet is home to many wading birds and Abbotsbury Swannery, and fossils can be found in the sand and mud. The Fleet connects to Portland Harbour at Ferry Bridge. Initially a ferry boat was used to connect Portland to the mainland, until the first bridge was constructed in 1839. An iron bridge replaced this in 1896, and this was in turn replaced with a concrete bridge in 1985.

Both Chesil Beach and the Fleet Lagoon are a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the view of the beach from Abbotsbury has been voted by &quot;Country Life&quot; magazine as Britain&#x27;s third best view.

An arrangement of nets and poles to lure ducks into a closed area of netting is a duck decoy located within Abbotsbury Swannery. It was originally installed to provide food for the local monks, but is now used to catch ducks for ringing. It may be the oldest surviving decoy in England. Located in the Upper Fleet, within Abbotsbury Swannery, is Bum Point, and adjacent to this is an artificial island known as Tern Island, which was created to provide a nesting site for common terns.

The lagoon is a designated bass nursery area, and the species are frequently seen on an underwater camera connected to the Chesil Beach Visitor Centre. Accordingly, angling for the fish is only permitted in the lower Fleet area, from the Narrows to Ferrybridge, and only from the shore and even this has been discouraged by the Southern-IFCA (Inshore Fisheries and Conservation Authority) as a conservation measure. A shallow draft boat, named the Fleet Observer, featuring a transparent bottom, takes visitors around the lower Fleet to observe the wildlife above and below the water.

The main site of the Wyke Regis Training Area is found to the west of the Wyke Regis village, where it lies on the north side of the Fleet. This site, a bridging camp, was constructed in 1928 by Royal Engineers. Since then the site has been in continuous use for the training of Royal Engineers, amongst other armed forces, including both regular and reserve forces in the construction of both bridges and ferries, along with other types of military training. The Bridging Camp&#x27;s inner training area allows Sappers to hone their skills on everything from raft building to familiarising themselves with state of the art weaponry. Due to the close proximity of the lagoon, water based training is held there.

A commercial oyster farm is situated on the sandbanks on the north side of the lower Fleet. The species farmed is the Pacific oyster, rather than the local oyster, and the farm racks are always visible at low tide.

At Seabarn, a hill located in the mid-Fleet, between Butterstreet Cove and Herbury, is a disused control tower and landing pad for the navy helicopter firing range in Lyme Bay. The range was closed when the Navy left Portland in 1995. There are also the remains of an anti-aircraft battery from the Second World War.

Fossils occur all along the landward shore of the Fleet and along the landward side of Chesil Beach from Abbotsbury to West Bay. The main site is at Burton Bradstock.

== Assortment of pebble size ==

The pebbles show a remarkable gradation in size along Chesil Beach, from around 5cm long at the south or eastern Chiswell end to pea-sized at the north or western end at West Bay. People landing on the beach at night having been fishing, or smuggling, are said to have been able to work out their location based on the pebbles&#x27; size. The sorting of the pebbles is due to the difference in wave height and direction along the beach. The natural processes leading to this separation by size have been able to produce this effect as there are no sea defences along the beach to interrupt them, and few stones are being added or removed from the beach (either naturally or artificially).

==Wildlife==

Due to the bird nesting season from 1 April until the end of August, access along, and to all parts of the beach from the Portland boundary stone to Abbotsbury is not permitted. Additionally access to the Fleet slope of the beach from Wyke to Abbotsbury is not permitted at any time in effort to protect and conserve the delicate environment. The Upper Fleet has some parts restricted to protect sensitive habitats.

The little egret, &quot;Egretta garzetta&quot;, once a rare visitor to the UK, but is now regularly seen along the shores of the Fleet. The scaly cricket, a small insect, is only found at three sites in the UK, including Chesil Beach. Two species of eelgrass are found in the Fleet: &quot;Zostera marina&quot; and &quot;Zostera noltii&quot;. These species both grow submerged in the shallow waters of the mid and upper Fleet, where large quantities die off in the early autumn.

Chesil Beach is a popular location for sea angling, with access at Chiswell, Ferry Bridge, Abbotsbury, Cogden, Burton Bradstock and West Bay. Angling is also allowed in the lower Fleet from the shore. Commercial fishing, which often involved seine nets, has now virtually disappeared from Chesil Beach compared with the level of activity a century ago. Within the Fleet there is still a small controlled fishery for eels using fyke nets. The grey mullet is a common fish of the Fleet, occurring in large numbers along its entire length.

In 1971, the Japanese seaweed, &quot;Sargassum muticum&quot;, arrived in Britain, where it first appeared in the Isle of Wight. However, in the following years it spread along the south coast to the Fleet. It soon dominated the environment despite a number of attempts to limit its impact. It has since died back to a much lower level of occupancy in the Narrows and lower Fleet, however the current amount of growth is often dependent on a number of factors and as such varies from year to year.

Due to issue with litter, both natural and man-made, brought to the beach by south-westerly gales, regular litter picks are organised, which involves volunteers to help alleviate the problem. A boom is in place at Ferry Bridge to minimise the impact on the Fleet of any oil pollution from within Portland Harbour.

== In popular culture ==
In the novel &quot;The Well-Beloved: A Sketch of a Temperament&quot; by Thomas Hardy he calls Chesil Beach Deadman&#x27;s Bay.
The Fleet Lagoon and Chesil Beach feature in the novel &quot;Moonfleet&quot; by J. Meade Falkner (1898), in which the village of Moonfleet is based on the real village of Fleet. Despite being the setting for the novel &quot;Moonfleet&quot; it was not used as a location for the film adaptation &quot;Moonfleet&quot; (1954) which was filmed entirely in Hollywood, California.

Ian McEwan&#x27;s Booker Prize nominated novel &quot;On Chesil Beach&quot; is, primarily, set in a hotel overlooking Chesil Beach. In the final sections of the book, there are scenes on Chesil Beach itself. This was adapted into a 2017 film of the same name.

The cover of the 1980 UK single &quot;Echo Beach&quot; by Martha and the Muffins was based on the Chesil Beach bar.

&quot;Chesil Beach: a Peopled Solitude&quot; (2021) by Judith Stinton is a non-fiction account of the history of Chesil Beach.

Chesil Beach and The Fleet Lagoon have been used as a location in films including &quot;The Dam Busters&quot; (1955), &quot;The Damned&quot; (1963), &quot;On Chesil Beach&quot; (2017), and &quot;The Sands Of Summers Past&quot; (2017), as well as being the setting for the climax of &quot;The Small Back Room&quot; (1949).

<text>The Lipovans or Lippovans (; ; ; ) are ethnic Russian Old Believers living in Romania, Ukraine, Moldova and Bulgaria who settled in the Principality of Moldavia, in the east of the Principality of Wallachia (Muntenia), and in the regions of Dobruja and Budjak during the 17th and 18th centuries. According to the 2011 Romanian census, there are a total of 23,487 Lipovans in Romania, mostly living in Northern Dobruja, in the Tulcea County but also in the Constanța County, and in the cities of Iași, Brăila and Bucharest. In Bulgaria, they inhabit two villages: Kazashko and Tataritsa.

== Name ==
The origin of the name of the Lipovans is not known exactly, but it may come from the linden trees (&quot;Lipa&quot; or &quot;Липа&quot; in Russian) of the area they populate bordering the Wild Fields. Linguist considers this to be folk etymology. Another hypothesis claims the name derives from the name &quot;Filipp&quot; (1672-1742) which is alleged to have been the true name of the son of Nikita Pustosvyat (d.1683) who according to a legend led the group of dissenters who emigrated to what is now Romania, his adepts being named &quot;Filippovtsy&quot; which became &quot;Lipovtsi&quot; and finally &quot;Lipovane&quot;. Another hypothesis derives it from &quot;Filippovka&quot;, a holiday name dedicated to Saint Philip of Moscow.

== History ==

The Lipovans emigrated from Russia in the 18th century, as dissenters from the main Russian Orthodox Church. They settled along the Prut River in Moldavia and in the Danube Delta. They have maintained strong religious traditions which predate the reforms of the Russian Orthodox Church undertaken during the rule of Patriarch Nikon. When the Patriarch made changes to worship in 1652, some believers carried on worshipping in the &quot;old way&quot;. In that sense, they continued to speak Old Russian, to cross themselves with two fingers instead of three, and to keep their beards. The Russian government and the Orthodox Church persecuted them, and as a result various sects arose whose goal was to commit suicide, e.g., by burning themselves (self-burners: сожигатели, &quot;sozhigateli&quot;), with many others being forced to emigrate.

Lipovans were considered to be schismatic by the Russian Orthodox Church, although relations have improved recently. (See main article on Old Believers.)

== Population ==
The main centre of the Lipovan community in Ukraine is the town of Vylkove, which has its own church, the St Nicholas Church. In order to construct their homes, the Lipovans create islets of dry land by digging mud out from trenches and making a series of canals. The house walls are made of reed and mud, and thatching is standard for the roofing.

<text>Radama II (September 23, 1829 – May 12, 1863 [&quot;contested&quot;]) was the son and heir of Queen Ranavalona I and ruled from 1861 to 1863 over the Kingdom of Madagascar, which controlled virtually the entire island. Radama&#x27;s rule, although brief, was a pivotal period in the history of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Under the unyielding and often harsh 33-year rule of his mother, Queen Ranavalona I, Madagascar had successfully preserved its cultural and political independence from European colonial designs. Rejecting the queen&#x27;s policy of isolationism and persecution of Christians, Radama II permitted religious freedom and re-opened Madagascar to European influence. Under the terms of the Lambert Charter, which Radama secretly contracted in 1855 with French entrepreneur Joseph-François Lambert while Ranavalona still ruled, the French were awarded exclusive rights to the exploitation of large tracts of valuable land and other lucrative resources and projects. This agreement, which was later revoked by Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony, was key to establishing France&#x27;s claim over Madagascar as a protectorate and, in 1896, as a colony.

The dramatic contrast between Ranavalona&#x27;s isolationism and her son&#x27;s pro-European stance represented an abrupt reversal of policy that threatened the traditional sociopolitical order. Radama&#x27;s absolutism in pursuing dramatic reforms in disregard of the advice of his ministers ultimately turned them against him. In a coup led by his prime minister, Rainivoninahitriniony, Radama II was strangled on May 12, 1863. His wife Rabodo, who took the throne name Rasoherina, was allowed by the ministers to succeed her husband on the condition that she and future sovereigns would no longer rule unilaterally, but rather in concert with the Hova (the class of free citizens) as represented by the position of prime minister. The public was informed that Radama had committed suicide and that his body had been unceremoniously interred in a tomb in Ilafy. However, there soon emerged rumors – believed by prominent foreigners Jean Laborde and William Ellis – that Radama lived and was making plans to reclaim the throne. A strong case has since been made on the basis of significant evidence that Radama may indeed have revived after the strangling and lived to old age in anonymity near Lake Kinkony in the northwestern part of the island.

== Upbringing and early years ==
Radama II was born Prince Rakoto (Rakotosehenondradama) on September 23, 1829, in the Imasoandro building on the compound of the Rova of Antananarivo. He was officially recognized as the son of King Radama I and his widow Queen Ranavalona I, although the king had died more than nine months before the prince&#x27;s birth. He was likely fathered by a lover of his mother, Andriamihaja, a progressive young officer of the Merina army who the queen may have been tricked into putting to death by conservative ministers at court.

After his mother succeeded Radama I on the throne, she instituted an increasingly regressive regime that attempted to restore traditional values and contain or eliminate westernization. The prince, however, who had been highly influenced by the French adviser to the queen, Joseph-François Lambert, was favorably impressed by European culture, knowledge and its state of economic, political and technological development, and was troubled by some of the socially repressive policies pursued by Ranavalona I. According to a British account, the French played on this sympathy in 1855 by pressuring Prince Rakoto into signing a request for French aid that would have enabled France to establish control over Madagascar had the true nature of the letter and its signing not been uncovered by Rakoto and his British contacts. An alternate explanation was offered by Lambert, who maintained that the prince had knowingly supported the attempt to put an end to his mother&#x27;s harsh policies, and was a willing collaborator in a failed 1857 plot to remove her from the throne.

Prior to Queen Ranavalona&#x27;s death, the conservative and progressive factions within the Merina court waged a tactical power struggle to secure a successor favorable to their own political agenda. The conservative faction favored Ramboasalama, the son of the Queen&#x27;s sister, while the Queen&#x27;s prime minister, Rainivoninahitriniony and head of the army, Rainilaiarivony, brothers and progressives, supported Radama II. The latter successfully obtained key strategic allies within the court that enabled Radama to seize the throne without violence following his mother&#x27;s death. Ramboasalama was obliged to swear a public oath of allegiance to Radama, and was later sent into exile in the highland village of Ambohimirimo where he died in April 1862.

== Reign ==
Prince Rakoto acceded to the throne on August 16, 1861, upon the natural death of his mother, Queen Ranavalona I, assuming the throne name Radama II. His coronation ceremony was held the following year on September 23, 1862. Once upon the throne, he immediately initiated a rapid and dramatic reversal of many of his mother&#x27;s traditionalist policies. He reopened the country to foreign powers and concluded treaties of friendship with Britain and France. The Lambert Charter opened up business possibilities for French investors. Freedom of religion was declared, persecution of Christians ceased, missionaries returned to the island and their schools were reopened. Radama abolished the traditional trial by ordeal of &quot;tangena&quot;, in which the guilt or innocence of an accused person was determined based on the outcome of consuming the poison of the &quot;tangena&quot; nut, and inhabitants of Antananarivo were permitted to raise swine within the city walls, a practice previously forbidden by a &quot;fady&quot; (taboo) forbidding them from being kept near the royal talismans (&quot;sampy&quot;). The sampy were dispersed to the sacred villages where they had originated under 16th-century Merina king Ralambo and other early monarchs. Significantly, Radama freed numerous political prisoners captured under Ranavalona I during provincial wars of subjugation and offered repatriation of confiscated property. This pardon was reciprocated by many of the beneficiary ethnic groups around the island, and good will between the coasts and central administration at Antananarivo improved significantly. These changes, and the king himself, were unequivocally praised by Madagascar&#x27;s European partners:

The reaction within Imerina was less one-sided. The abrupt and dramatic policy changes pursued by the progressive king both alienated and disfranchised the established conservative factions among the andriana (nobles) and Hova (freemen) at court. Especially controversial were the special privileges accorded to Joseph-François Lambert and his partners under the Lambert Charter, including the exclusive implementation of public works projects (felling trees, making roads, building canals etc.), control over minting coinage, lucrative mining rights and more as part of the purview of Lambert&#x27;s proposed &quot;Compagnie de Madagascar&quot; (French Madagascar Company). The citizens&#x27; concern stemmed primarily from clauses in the agreement that would have permitted Lambert&#x27;s company to become permanent owners of Malagasy lands. Until this point, land in Madagascar, which was viewed by the populace as the sacred ground of the ancestors, could only ever be temporarily possessed by foreigners until their death, at which point the land would revert to the crown. The threat of permanently losing any part of sacred Malagasy soil to foreigners was deeply troubling.

== Assassination plot ==

The legalization of dueling was ultimately the issue that brought to a head the tension between King Radama II&#x27;s entourage (mostly friends and some established political figures, known collectively as the &quot;menamaso&quot; or &quot;red-eyes&quot;) and representatives of the opposition led by Radama&#x27;s prime minister Rainivoninahitriniony. On May 7, 1863, Radama II announced his intention to allow disputes to be settled by a duel, much to the disapproval of many of his advisers at court who feared the practice would lead to anarchy. The prime minister prevented the law from being publicly declared at the &quot;Zoma&quot; (Friday) market the following day. Friday afternoon, the prime minister&#x27;s younger brother, Rainilaiarivony, who was head of the army, called several thousand troops into the city to besiege a number of the &quot;menamaso&quot; and members of the royal family at the Rova palace compound, and by Saturday morning the decision had been made and carried out to execute eleven of the &quot;menamaso&quot; and other key political figures who had counseled Radama to legalize dueling. On Sunday, May 10, Rainivoninahitriniony demanded that Radama hand over the &quot;menamaso&quot; he was sheltering in the palace, which he refused to do until the prime minister agreed to spare their lives; they were handed over but by Monday morning had all been speared to death.

The drama ended on Tuesday morning, May 12, 1863, when a group of officers and soldiers forced their way into the Rova and seized the king. His wife, Queen Rabodo, pleaded for his life to be spared and attempted to stop them but was forcibly removed. The soldiers threw a lamba over Radama&#x27;s head and strangled him with a silk sash until he was believed to be dead, thereby avoiding the shedding of royal blood as was the custom for royal executions in Imerina.

The nobles informed Rabodo that she would have their support as queen on the condition that she would accept to abide by certain articles that would form a new contract between rulers and ruled in Madagascar:

Rabodo agreed to these conditions. The next morning, it was publicly announced in the marketplace that Radama had taken his own life due to grief over the deaths of his compatriots the &quot;menamaso&quot; and that Rabodo would succeed him as Queen Rasoherina. To cement the new power-sharing agreement between the ruler, the nobles and the heads of the people, a political marriage was contracted between the queen and Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, who had been instrumental in her first husband&#x27;s death. Radama&#x27;s name was struck from the list of kings and it was declared illegal to mourn his death.

== Rumors of survival ==
Following Radama II&#x27;s apparent death, rumors spread that he had only been rendered unconscious by the attempt on his life and had revived as his body was being transported to Ilafy for interment in his designated tomb. French historian Delval presents evidence that supports a scenario wherein the group tasked with carrying Radama&#x27;s body to Ilafy became frightened as the king began to revive, prompting them to abandon the body and then falsely maintain that they had completed their task to place him in the tomb. Within months after his reported death, rumors began circulating that Radama was alive, residing on the west coast of the island and was amassing supporters for a political comeback. The rumors persisted to the point of causing political turmoil in Antananarivo. These claims may have had some substance judging by the actions of others. Prominent Christian missionaries outside the capital made extensive efforts to visit and support Radama but seemingly never succeeded. Traditionalist factions within the government were concerned enough by the rumors to have put to death sixteen of his supporters, as well as fining hundreds of others. According to evidence in Delval&#x27;s study, Radama may indeed have survived and, failing to regain the throne, lived to old age as an ordinary citizen in the north of the island.

With the apparent murder of Radama II, the power of the Merina monarchs was broken. Subsequent monarchs were controlled by influential Hova, particularly Rainilaiarivony, who became prime minister after his brother and successively married all three remaining queens of the monarchy: Rasoherina, Ranavalona II and Ranavalona III.

<text>Rasoherina (1814 – 1 April 1868) (also Rasoherina-Manjaka) was Queen of Madagascar from 1863 to 1868, succeeding her husband Radama II following his presumed assassination.

==Early years==
Rasoherina, niece of Queen Ranavalona I, was born Princess Rabodozanakandriana in 1814, the daughter of Prince Andriantsalamanandriana, of Ambohitraina and Princess Rafaramanjaka (Ramirahavavy). As a young woman, she married Raharolahy (Raharola), a successful statesman in his own right who received 15 state honors and served as Secretary to the Embassy to the United Kingdom (1836–37), Second Minister for Foreign Affairs in French matters (1862), Minister for the Interior (1862–64), Counselor of Government (1864–65) and Governor of Toamasina (1865). The couple divorced in 1847 and that same year she was married to Ranavalona&#x27;s son and heir, Rakoto. When he succeeded his mother in 1861 as King Radama II, she was crowned with him as queen consort.

==Accession to the throne==

Rasoherina acted as queen consort for only two years before her husband&#x27;s political decisions succeeded in displeasing his ministers to such an extent that a coup was organized in which Radama II was believed assassinated. A study conducted in the 1960s provides evidence that Radama in fact survived the assassination attempt and lived to old age as a regular citizen outside the capital, although rumors to this end were never proven to be true at the time, and the evolution of life at court pursued its course as if Radama had died. The day of his believed death in 1863, the council of Hova government officials responsible for organizing the coup, headed by the brothers Rainivoninahitriniony and Rainilaiarivony, invited Rabodo to succeed to the throne on the condition that she sign a contract stipulating conditions that in effect created a constitutional monarchy placing the real ruling power in the hands of the prime minister. These conditions included the suppression of &quot;tangena&quot; (a traditional trial by ordeal) as well as the monarchy&#x27;s defense of freedom of religion. Rabodo was crowned on 13 May 1863 under the throne name of Rasoherina.

==Reign==
The real power of the kingdom at the beginning of Rasoherina&#x27;s reign was Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, instigator of the coup against her husband. The Prime Minister entered into a political marriage with Rasoherina a few weeks after the crowning. Rainivoninahitriniony effectively operated unhindered in his running of state affairs at court where the conservative faction empowered under Ranavalona I was still active under the leadership of her former prime minister, Rainijohary. However, Rainivoninahitriniony&#x27;s progressives formed a majority in the Queen&#x27;s Council and their advocacy for a moderately pro-European policy of modernization won out over the reversal of the policies of Radama II that were demanded by Rainijohary&#x27;s conservatives.
However, Rainivoninahitriniony became increasingly despotic and exhibited habitual drunkenness and frequent violence as his power grew, reportedly threatening Queen Rasoherina at knife point on several occasions. One year after taking the throne, Rasoherina deposed Rainivoninahitriniony, appointed his younger brother Rainilaiarivony as prime minister in his stead and contracted a political marriage with him in turn.
 During the reign of Queen Rasoherina, ambassadors were sent to London and Paris and Sunday markets were prohibited. The controversial Lambert Charter enacted by Radama II was declared void, much to the displeasure of France; a sum of 240,000 ariary (~ 1,200,000 French francs) was paid to France in reparations for the breach of this lucrative trade agreement. On 27 June 1865, she signed a treaty with the United Kingdom giving British citizens the right to rent land and property on the island and to have a resident ambassador. On 14 February 1867, she signed a treaty with the United States of America that limited the importation of weapons and the export of cattle. A treaty with France was under consideration during her reign but was not signed into effect until after her death and the succession of Ranavalona II to the throne.

==Succession conspiracy and death==

In the final days of the queen&#x27;s life, a succession conspiracy came to light that would have removed Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony from power and ensured the succession of a prince named Rasata to the throne upon Rasoherina&#x27;s death. On Friday, 27 March 1868, at two in the afternoon, a massive crowd armed with guns and swords attempted to storm the Rova of Antananarivo, residence of Queen Rasoherina. Disgraced former Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony was believed to be the chief instigator of the action as he would have re-established himself as prime minister and ruled through young Rasata&#x27;s puppet government. The rebel group successfully captured a number of key figures, including the head of the Queen&#x27;s Guard; a group of guards, however, managed to escape and raced to notify Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony who was visiting Ambohimanga where Queen Rasoherina was gravely ill from dysentery. The Prime Minister gave the order to arrest the conspirators, several of whom were promptly captured upon the soldiers&#x27; return to the city. At five in the evening, Rasoherina delivered a public address, asking those favorable to her rule to walk with her through the capital; a massive crowd paraded with her through the city, demonstrating their support for her continued authority. The queen then delivered a speech at Andohalo ordering the public to turn in any known conspirators to bring them to justice, before returning to the Rova to reassume her royal duties. The windows along the route to the palace were reportedly all ordered shut, either to protect the Queen from projectiles or to keep the nobles inhabiting the upper town from viewing the advanced state of her infirmity.

The queen died four days later, on 1 April 1868. On her deathbed, she was received into the Roman Catholic Church and conferred the care of her two orphaned adoptive children, Prince Ratahiry and Princess Rasoaveromanana, to her first cousin and successor, Ramoma, another of Radama II&#x27;s wives, who would succeed her and take the throne name Ranavalona II.

<text>Ranavalona II (1829 – 13 July 1883) was Queen of Madagascar from 1868 to 1883, succeeding Queen Rasoherina, her first cousin. She is best remembered for Christianizing the royal court during her reign.

== Early life ==

Ranavalona II was born Princess Ramoma in 1829 at Ambatomanoina, near Antananarivo in the central highlands to Prince Razakaratrimo and his wife Princess Rafarasoa Ramasindrazana. As a young woman she, like her cousin Rasoherina, was married to King Radama II and was widowed upon his assassination in the nobles&#x27; coup of 1863. The prime minister at the time, Rainivoninahitriniony, played a major role in the assassination plot and public condemnation of the action forced him from his post. The position of prime minister was then filled by his younger brother Rainilaiarivony, who married Queen Rasoherina and then, upon her death, helped to designate Ranavalona II the next monarch of Madagascar and consequently married her to retain his position.

During her years at court, young Ramoma was tutored by Protestant missionaries who greatly influenced her religious and political views. She became increasingly favorable toward the beliefs of the Christian religion.

== Reign ==

Ranavalona II succeeded to the throne upon the death of Queen Rasoherina on 1 April 1868. On 21 February 1869, she entered into a political marriage with her prime minister, Rainilaiarivony, in a public ceremony at Andohalo wherein the court officially underwent conversion to Christianity. This conversion was effected to bring the increasingly powerful Protestant faction under the influence of the royal court. Declaring Madagascar a Christian nation, Ranavalona had the traditional royal talismans (&quot;sampy&quot;) burned in a bonfire in September 1869 and replaced their authority with that of the Bible.

Under her rule the problem of deforestation was considered. The queen authorized construction using brick and other durable materials within the walls of Antananarivo (previously forbidden by King Andrianampoinimerina). She also banned the traditional practice of &quot;tavy&quot; (swidden, slash-and-burn agriculture), charcoal making and construction of houses within forests.

A European visitor to the court of Ranavalona II in 1873 described the queen in the following terms: &quot;I should think the queen was about 45 years of age, with a dark olive complexion, and a face full of kindness and benevolence. She was very queenly, and dressed in a gray shot-silk dress, and a silk lamba fell negligently from her shoulders. Her hair was black, and beautifully arranged; &#x27;crown she did not wear&#x27;, but from the hair at the top of her head there depended the long fine gold chain ending in a gold tassel, which only the queen can wear.&quot;

== Death and succession ==

Ranavalona II died in 1883 and was buried in Ambohimanga. In a bid to desacralize the holy city, in 1897 the French colonial authority disinterred her remains along with those of other monarchs buried in Ambohimanga and transferred them to the tombs on the compound of the Rova of Antananarivo, where her bones were interred in the tomb of Queen Rasoherina. She was succeeded by Queen Ranavalona III, the last monarch of the kingdom.

<doc id="271525" wikidata="Q928074" url="?curid=271525" title="Soulseek">
<text>Soulseek is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file-sharing network and application, used mostly to exchange music.

The current Soulseek network is the second to have been in operation, the same management runs both. The older network, used up to version 156 of the client, was shut down after significant user inactivity. Version 157 of the client was the last for Microsoft Windows only, and work on it ceased in 2008. Its replacement, SoulseekQt, is available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. SoulseekQt has slightly different functionality compared to the 157 client interface.

== Key features ==

=== Content ===
As a peer to peer (P2P) file sharing program, the accessible content is determined by the users of the Soulseek client, and what files they choose to share. The network has historically had a diverse mix of music, including underground and independent artists, unreleased music, such as demos and mixtapes, bootlegs, live tracks, and live DJ sets, but releases from major and independent labels can also be found.

=== Central server ===
Soulseek depends on a pair of central servers. One server supports the original client and network Version 156, with the other supporting the newer network (functioning with clients 157 and Qt). While these central servers are key to coordinating searches and hosting chat rooms, they do not actually play a part in the transfer of files between users, which takes place directly between the users concerned. (See Single Source Downloads below).

=== Searching ===
Users can search for items; the results returned being a list of files whose names match the search term used. Searches may be explicit or may use wildcards/patterns or terms to be excluded. For example, searching for blue suede -shoes will return a list of files whose names containing the strings blue and suede, but files containing the string shoes in their names will be excluded.

A feature specific to the Soulseek search engine is the inclusion of the folder names and file paths in the search list. This allows users to search by folder name. For example, typing in experimental will return all the files that are contained in folders having that name, providing quick access to bands and albums in a determined musical genre.

The list of search results shows details, such as the full name and path of the file, its size, the user who is hosting the file, together with that users&#x27; average transfer rate, and brief details about the encoded track itself, such as bit rate, length, etc. The resulting search list may then be sorted in a variety of ways and individual files (or folders) chosen for download.

The Soulseek protocol search algorithms are not published, as those algorithms run on the server.

=== Single source (one-to-one) downloads ===
Soulseek does not support multi-source downloading or &quot;swarming&quot; like other post-Napster clients, and must fetch a requested file from a single source. (By contrast, swarming allows a requested file to be sourced from a number of users who have that file, thus pieces of the file may be downloaded concurrently from a number of sources, typically giving improved performance.)

=== Banning ===
All Soulseek clients contain a ban feature whereby selected users may be banned from requesting files. This is in response to users who might be free-riding (i.e. taking files from others without sharing any files themselves) or who might be causing a nuisance for other reasons, such as a personal argument through the chat facilities or just taking up a user&#x27;s bandwidth by downloading too many files, or simply on the whim of the banning user. Banning can be a contentious subject, and was the subject of much discussion in the user forums particularly in the early days . Users with download privileges can still be banned.

=== Album downloads ===
While Soulseek, like other P2P clients, allows a user to download individual files from another by selecting each one from a list of search results, a Download Containing Folder option simplifies the downloading of entire albums. For example, a user who wishes to facilitate the distribution of an entire album may place all tracks relating to the album together in a folder on the host PC, and the entire contents of that folder (i.e. all the album&#x27;s track files) can then be downloaded automatically one after the other using this one command.

=== File transfer monitoring ===
The Soulseek client features two file transfer monitoring windows where the progress of files being uploaded and downloaded can be monitored and controlled.

=== User profiles ===
Users may complete a profile which contains basic free-form text information (e.g. basic information about themselves or their &#x27;file transfer rules&#x27;) together with a list of things they like, a list of things they dislike, and optionally an image file. These items may then be viewed by other users when selecting the username from a list of members in a chat room or a list of files returned by a search.

The list of items a user likes may also be used to obtain global rankings for that item in the Soulseek community or to obtain recommendations from other users who have the same items in their list of things they like.

=== Wishlists ===
The Soulseek 156, 157 and Qt clients provide a &quot;wishlist&quot; feature which functions like a stored search. Search terms are input as entries in a wishlist and each wishlist entry is then periodically executed as a search automatically by the client software, returning results as appropriate.

=== Privileges ===
While the Soulseek software is free, a donation scheme exists to support the programming effort and cost of maintaining the servers. In return for donations, users are granted the privilege of being able to jump ahead of non-donating users in a queue when downloading files (but only if the files are not shared over a local area network).

== Support forums and blog ==
Like numerous other software titles, Soulseek has a set of forums where users may seek help on a variety of topics, such as technical aspects of using the software. Separate forums now support clients 156 and 157, and Qt. The first blog was created in the latter part of 2003.

== Financing ==
Soulseek is entirely financed by donations, with no advertising or user fees. Nir Arbel writes, as of July 1, 2008:
== Copyright issues ==
In 2003 the artist Sapphirecut contacted Soulseek in an effort to stop the group&#x27;s music from being shared amongst users; when Soulseek&#x27;s server host Verio became aware of the situation, they dropped the network and it was unavailable for weeks. 

Soulseek claims to be against copyright violation and that the purpose of their service is to promote unsigned artists.
This is a quote from their homepage: 
Soulseek was taken to court in 2008 by two French music industry groups. The groups alleged that Soulseek is designed to permit unauthorized access to copyrighted works.

== History ==
The original Soulseek user base around 2000 was composed mostly of members of the IDM mailing list, and most of the music first found on Soulseek was underground electronic music or music created by the users themselves. Aided by Soulseek users, the developer Nir Arbel released new versions of the client very frequently, in response to user requests for new features or bug fixes.

There is no known published usage data. Soulseek got a first boost in 2001 when Napster was closed down and then a second boost in 2002 when the site Audiogalaxy was closed down. Nir Arbel stated in an interview published December 26, 2003 that there were, at that time, over a million registered usernames and that 80,000–100,000 users log on during peak hours. The increase in Soulseek users after the shutdown of Audiogalaxy was plainly evident from a before-and-after comparison of chat room populations. Before the shutdown of its competitor, Soulseek&#x27;s most-joined chat rooms averaged 50 or so people. After the shutdown, the population of these chat rooms increased to 100 or more.

Soulseek is more of a community than a simple file sharing client. In Soulseek, users can connect with other users with similar music tastes to share files and to chat. Users even have the ability to create their own chat rooms and invite other users with similar tastes to discuss their favorite music. Many musicians from the electronic scene are themselves too part of this Soulseek community. In summer 2004, Soulseek users from all the world met in Augsburg, Germany. Every year since then, that meeting still takes place at a digital arts festival called Lab30 (30 being the street number of the Abraxas Theater) in Augsburg, Germany, organized by longtime Soulseek user Manfred Genther and other Augsburg locals. This festival focuses on showcasing digital musicians, digital artists, and netlabels from all over the world. Many Soulseek artists have performed at the festival, and a large number of them have performed live for the first time there. Lab30 has steadily grown in size since the first event and continues to be a meeting place for the musicians and users of Soulseek. Attendees usually come from all over Europe and the United States. Lab30 is a well known event in Augsburg and widely supported and cherished by the Augsburg music and art scene.

=== Soulseek Records ===
Many of the original Soulseek users are also music producers, and Soulseek Records (not to be confused with &quot;SLSK Records&quot;) was formed in 2002.

=== Versions ===
The first release was 139, which ran for about 12 months from 2002–03. Following a change in servers, a new version was released to coincide with this event. Whilst the main interface has largely remained unchanged since its inception, additional features such as the chat room &#x27;ticker&#x27; were introduced into the 156 version.

Version 156 first appeared in 2005. A second &#x27;test&#x27; version of the server, version 157, was set up shortly afterwards, which became the primary client in 2008.

Since July 6, 2008, there have been two versions of the Soulseek client, with entirely different users, user groups, and files. The older version, v.156 is progressively being wound down, but still operates as of August 2011, albeit with few users. Users are not obligated to upgrade, and new users may still inadvertently download the 156 client.

The 157 &quot;test&quot; network has been around since 2005, to circumvent poor search capability on the 156 client. The v.157 test 12c was released in November 2007. All recent versions have several bugs which can hang or cause the system to stop searching or downloading.

The client SoulseekQT Public Build 1 was released in 04/19/2011.

For the older clients (156 and 157) no official client was developed for non-Windows operating systems, but a number of unofficial third-party clients existed at the time. Development of third-party clients was discouraged (but not prohibited), as coding errors or explicit circumvention of network rules in third-party clients had, at times, a drastic negative impact on the Soulseek network.

=== Alternative clients ===
Nicotine+ is an actively maintained fork of the now defunct Nicotine client. Nicotine+ uses a graphical interface, and runs under GNU/Linux, *BSD, Solaris, Windows, and macOS. It is currently maintained by a team of volunteers with its source hosted on GitHub. It uses Gtk+ 3, Python 3, and supports UPnP. Stable and unstable packages are available for Alpine Linux Edge, Arch Linux, Debian, Fedora, Gentoo, Manjaro, NixOS, OpenBSD, Parabola, Solus, T2 SDE and Void Linux. Nicotine+ is also available as a Flatpak, as of release version 2.0.0 and Snap.

Nicotine+&#x27;s defunct predecessor Nicotine also ran on all Unix-based systems, such as Mac OS X, and on Microsoft Windows. It is in turn based on the original PySoulSeek project. It may still be available from some package distributors on Linux-based systems.

PySoulSeek was a Soulseek client written in Python that runs under Linux/FreeBSD/Solaris and other Unix-based operating systems. PySoulSeek runs under Mac OS X but with some difficulty.

slskd and Museek+ are Soulseek clients utilizing a client-server model, though the latter is no longer under development.

Seeker is a Soulseek client for modern Android devices. GoSeek was a Soulseek client for older Android devices (before Android Nougat).

MewSeek was originally iSlsk, a Soulseek client for iPod Touch and iPhone clients running jailbroken versions of iOS. MewSeek no longer supports Soulseek.

Clients for Mac OS X included Soulseex (ssX) and iSoul. iSoul was based on an earlier client called Solarseek.

<doc id="271543" wikidata="Q1631281" url="?curid=271543" title="South West Coast Path">
<text>The South West Coast Path is England&#x27;s longest waymarked long-distance footpath and a National Trail. It stretches for , running from Minehead in Somerset, along the coasts of Devon and Cornwall, to Poole Harbour in Dorset. Because it rises and falls with every river mouth, it is also one of the more challenging trails. The total height climbed has been calculated to be 114,931 ft (35,031 m), almost four times the height of Mount Everest. It has been voted &#x27;Britain&#x27;s Best Walking route&#x27; twice in a row by readers of The Ramblers&#x27; &quot;Walk&quot; magazine, and regularly features in lists of the world&#x27;s best walks.

The final section of the path was designated as a National Trail in 1978. Many of the landscapes which the South West Coast Path crosses have special status, either as a national park or one of the heritage coasts. The path passes through two World Heritage Sites: the Dorset and East Devon Coast, known as the Jurassic Coast, was designated in 2001, and the Cornwall and West Devon Mining Landscape in 2007.

In the 1990s it was thought that the path brought £150 million into the area each year, but new research in 2003 indicated that it generated around £300 million a year in total, which could support more than 7,500 jobs. This research also recorded that 27.6% of visitors to the region came because of the Path, and they spent £136 million in a year. Local people took 23 million walks on the Path and spent a further £116 million, and other visitors contributed the remainder. A further study in 2005 estimated this figure to have risen to around £300 million. Following investment through the Rural Development Programme for England, more detailed research was undertaken in 2012, and this found the annual spend by walkers to have risen to £439 million which sustains 9771 full-time equivalent jobs.

==History of the path==
The path originated as a route for the Coastguard to walk along patrolling for smugglers. They needed to be able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct path between two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England&#x27;s right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.

The path is a designated National Trail, largely funded by Natural England. It was created in stages, with its final section, Somerset and North Devon, opening in 1978. It is maintained by a dedicated South West Coast Path Team.

The South West Coast Path Association, a registered charity, exists to support the interests of users of the path. The Association was formed in 1973 and since then it has campaigned for improvements to the path and undertakes considerable fundraising to help care for and improve the path. Its services include accommodation guides and completion certificates.

==Route description==
The route is described here anticlockwise, from Minehead to Poole. The distance and total ascent between any two points, in either direction, can be obtained from . A survey carried out in 1999 and 2000 found that at that time the path had 2,473 signposts or waymarks, and included 302 bridges, 921 stiles, and 26,719 steps. In practice, any such calculation is soon out of date because of path diversions due to landslips or access changes.

Walked as a single hike, the path may take between 30 and 60 days to complete but most walkers tend to break it up into shorter segments completed over several years. A team of six Royal Marines, taking turns in pairs to run two-hour sections, completed the path in six days in 2004. In 2012 Mal Law ran the entire path in 16 days, 9 hours and 57 minutes. New records for completing the path were set on 11 May 2013, when Mark Townsend and Julie Gardener completed the trail in 14 days, 14 hours and 44 minutes and 23 April 2015, when Patrick Devine-Wright completed the trail in 14 days, 8 hours and 2 minutes. This record was however quickly broken by Mark Berry, who ran it in 11 days, 8 hours and 15 minutes. On 24 May 2016, Damian Hall set a new fastest known time of 10 days, 15 hours and 18 minutes. The current record is 10 days, 12 hours and 6 minutes, set by Kristian Morgan in September 2020.

===Somerset===

The South West Coast Path starts from the western side of Minehead, in Somerset, at a marker erected in 2001 and partly paid for by the South West Coast Path Association. The path follows the waterfront past the harbour to Culver Cliff before climbing up on a zigzag path through woodland. Entering the Exmoor National Park, it cuts inland past North Hill, Selworthy Beacon and Bossington Hill before regaining the cliff top at Hurlestone Point. After passing through Bossington it follows the beach to Porlock Weir and connects with the Coleridge Way.

The scenery of rocky headlands, ravines, waterfalls and towering cliffs gained the Exmoor coast recognition as a Heritage Coast in 1991. The Exmoor Coastal Heaths have been recognised as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) due to the diversity of species present. The path passes the smallest parish church in England, Culbone Church, in Culbone. The path crosses the county boundary into Devon, a few hundred yards north of the National Park Centre at County Gate.

===North Devon===
The next big headland is Foreland Point, after which the path comes to Lynmouth with the Lynton and Lynmouth Cliff Railway linking it with Lynton on the hill above. At Lynmouth the path intersects with the Two Moors Way. The river here suffered a catastrophic flood in the 1950s. Beyond Lynton the path passes through the Valley of Rocks, known for its herd of goats, then Duty Point and Lee Bay, then Crock Point and Woody Bay. After Highveer Rocks the path crosses the small River Heddon then skirts Trentishoe Down and Holdstone Down and climbs Great Hangman.
At this is the highest point on the path. With a cliff face of , it is described as the highest cliff on mainland Britain. The path now leaves the Exmoor National Park and enters the village of Combe Martin, which claims to have the longest village street in England (two miles ()).
After rounding Widmouth Head, the path passes &#x27;The Coastguard Cottages&#x27; in Hele Bay and enters the seaside resort of Ilfracombe, with its small harbour, surrounded by cliffs. A seasonal foot passenger ferry service runs from the harbour to Lundy Island, and the &quot;Balmoral&quot;, the &quot;Waverley&quot; and pleasure boats ply to Porthcawl near Swansea. From Ilfracombe to Bideford the Tarka Trail coincides with the South West Coast Path.

The path leaves Ilfracombe through The Torrs and follows the cliff top past several small bays including Lee Bay before passing Bull Point and the Bull Point Lighthouse, into Rackham Bay. It then rounds Morte Point, passing the nearby village of Mortehoe before turning south to enter the long sandy Morte Bay which includes Woolacombe and Putsborough. Baggy Point divides Morte Bay from Croyde Bay, and the surfing mecca of Croyde and then the much larger Barnstaple or Bideford Bay, which forms part of the North Devon Coast Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. The wide expanse of Saunton Sands, which takes its name from Saunton, merges into the Braunton Burrows Site of Special Scientific Interest, the largest sand dune system (psammosere) in England and a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve. It is particularly important ecologically because it includes the complete successional range of dune plant communities, with over 400 vascular plant species. The short turf communities are very rich in lichens and herbs, and the dune slacks are also rich. The many rare plants and animals include 14 with UK Biodiversity Action Plans.

From Braunton Burrows the South West Coast Path turns inland following the Braunton Canal to Braunton and then along north bank of the River Taw, following part of the route of the old Ilfracombe Branch Line, past the perimeter of the Royal Marines Base Chivenor towards Barnstaple where the new Barnstaple Western Bypass now forms the closest bridge over the Taw to the sea. After crossing medieval Barnstaple Long Bridge, the path then turns west following the disused Bideford &amp; Instow Railway line along southern bank of the Taw past Fremington Quay and the Fremington Quay Cliffs SSSI to Instow at the joint estuary of the Rivers Taw and Torridge and the Taw-Torridge Estuary (SSSI). The ferry which used to operate at Instow ceased on the retirement of the ferryman in 2007, but since 2013 a revived ferry again runs in summer. The path goes upstream to cross the river by the 13th-century Long Bridge at Bideford, which is the site of the Bideford Railway Heritage Centre and terminus of the North Devon Railway.

The path continues north beside the Torridge Estuary, in places following the route of the Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway, past Northam to Appledore and around the promontory past the Shell middens and a submerged forest, that dates from the Mesolithic period, off the pebble ridge to Westward Ho! (this is the only placename in the UK which includes an exclamation mark). The path then follows the coast around Clovelly Bay where several small villages including Abbotsham lie inland, because of the cliffs. The path passes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Peppercombe Castle and the village of Bucks Mills. Clovelly itself is a historic village with a small natural harbour. The path continues past the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Windbury Head to Hartland Point and Hartland Quay. Hartland Point features a lighthouse and radar tower, and marks the western limit (on the English side) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean to the west. There is a winter helicopter service from Hartland Point to Lundy, which is visible from many points along the path between Welcombe and the Cornish border.

===North Cornwall===

The path crosses into Cornwall at Marsland Mouth and continues south-westwards along this rocky coast, past Morwenstow then Higher and Lower Sharpnose Points. Beyond Sandy Mouth, the walking becomes easier through Bude, a surfing resort, and along Widemouth Bay. Returning to the cliffs, the path continues past the spectacular folds at Millook, then to Crackington Haven, past Cambeak and further south (over &quot;High Cliff&quot;, Southern Britain&#x27;s highest sheer-drop cliff at ), and from there to Boscastle, the scene of flooding in 2004.

Tintagel and its castle are associated with the conception of the legendary King Arthur and a 15th-century house that was later used as a post office. The path continues to Trebarwith Strand, Tregardock, then to Port Gaverne, Port Isaac, and Port Quin, three small harbours. Overlooking Port Quin is Doyden Castle, a 19th-century folly.

The scenery is now less wild, the cliffs less high. The Rumps, a dolerite intrusion, has Iron Age defences across its narrow neck but the path heads straight past to Pentire Point then swings south-eastwards again into Polzeath. The estuary of the River Camel forces a detour away from the sea to Rock and the Black Tor Ferry that takes walkers into Padstow.

From Stepper Point the path again runs along low sea cliffs to Trevone and Harlyn Bay then around Trevose Head. From here—weather permitting—the coast can be seen as far as Hartland in Devon to beyond St Ives in the west. The path runs southwards through Constantine Bay to Porthcothan then passes around Park Head to reach Mawgan Porth.

The long, sandy Watergate Bay leads to St Columb Porth and Newquay. A rail link with through trains to London and the North of England on summer weekends has helped the town prosper as a seaside resort which is visited by both surfers and clubbers. On the far side of the town, beyond Fistral Beach, lies the River Gannel. There is a seasonal ferry to Crantock, plus three tidal footbridges along the river which are passable at various states of the tide, otherwise at the highest tide it may be necessary to detour inland to use the road bridge.

The path now skirts Pentire Point West and then Kelsey Head to reach Holywell Bay, another surfing beach. After passing round Penhale and crossing Penhale Sands the path enters Perranporth, then climbs out the other side back onto a stretch of cliffs past Cligga Head to the village of St Agnes. Past St Agnes Head, a breeding ground for seabirds, lie the ruins of Tywarnhayle Mine and a descent past the picturesque remains of Wheal Coates tin mine (National Trust) down to a small beach at Chapel Porth. Above this cove on the south side are the less extensive ruins of Great Wheal Charlotte mine, consisting of one wall of a pump engine house within an extensive debris field. The path then descends to a popular sandy cove with pub and car park near Porthtowan village.

After passing Nancekuke firing ranges, the path drops into Portreath, once a busy port serving inland tin mines around Redruth. Beyond lies Carvannel Downs with Samphire Island just off the coast, and then the Reskajeage Downs better known locally as North Cliffs. Beyond the cove at Hell&#x27;s Mouth, the path runs northwards to pass around Navax Point and Godrevy Point, offshore from which lies Godrevy Island with its lighthouse.

===West Cornwall===

Turning into the wide sweep of St Ives Bay, where many walkers drop down onto the sands at low tide, the path follows the line of the sand dunes or Towans as they are known here. This area was used for explosives manufacture for many years, the sand being ideal for absorbing any accidental explosions. The Towans are interrupted by two rivers, the small Red River at the north end, and the larger River Hayle and its estuary towards the south. Although narrow, the estuary is tidal and fast flowing due to the large expanse of mud flats and docks that lie behind the Towans, so the path turns away from St Ives Bay to go round via Hayle. Hayle estuary is a RSPB reserve. The water is crossed using a road bridge beside the historic broad-gauge railway swing-bridge and then the path follows the route of the former Hayle Railway into Foundry Square, the town centre, and then the A30 road to Griggs Quay where quieter roads bring the Path around to the west side of the tidal mud flats. Views of the birdlife can be had from Carnsew Pool at Hayle and from the area around Lelant Saltings railway station, although the official path is slightly inland on the A3074 road through Lelant village, regaining the coast by crossing golf links to reach the last of the Towans above Porth Kidney Sands.

Rising back onto low cliffs, the path rounds Carrack Gladden and enters Carbis Bay, it then follows alongside the St Ives Bay railway line into St Ives; a bustling town favoured by artists since the 19th century, which is home to the Tate St Ives art gallery and the Barbara Hepworth Museum. The path passes the east-facing Porthminster Beach and goes around &quot;The Island&quot;, a headland, to the north-facing Porthmeor Beach.
The coast now shows the open and ancient landscape of the Penwith district along a series of wild headlands such as Clodgy Point, Hor Point, Pen Enys Point, and Carn Naun Point. The Carracks lie just offshore, locally known as Seal Island (and seals can often be seen close to the shore opposite here), then there lies Zennor Head and Gurnard&#x27;s Head as the Path leads into Morvah, although the village proper lies inland. Portheras Cove is a relief from the many small rocky bays along this coast but the cliffs then continue beyond the iconic, disused Crowns Mine at Botallack.
From Cape Cornwall at St Just, the Path heads southwards to sandy Whitesand Bay and the village of Sennen. At the end of the sands the path turns westwards one last time to reach Land&#x27;s End. This is the most westerly point of the English mainland.

After passing Land&#x27;s End the path continues further south past Pordenack Point and Nanjizal, also known as Mill Bay, before turning fully eastward at Gwennap Head. Beyond the tiny village of Porthgwarra lies St Levan. The next bay lies below Porthcurno. It is overlooked by the open-air Minack Theatre and is where the Eastern Cable Company&#x27;s cable came ashore, the first telegraph link with India. Climbing out of the bay the path passes the precarious Logan Rock.

The next village is Penberth, then a series of bays are separated by the headlands of Merthen Point, Boscawen Point, and Tater Du with its lighthouse built in 1965. Lamorna Cove is a favourite with artists such as S. J. &quot;Lamorna&quot; Birch, who lived there in a small cottage. Then, after rounding Carn Du, the path turns northwards towards Mousehole and Penlee Point. This section of the path follows a road into Newlyn, but a diversion via Paul allows walkers to follow a quieter inland path. Newlyn has a busy fishing harbour and is again favoured by artists, known as the Newlyn School; it merges into Penzance and the path now follows the promenade through the town, passing Penzance railway station and continuing past the railway engine shed along the shore of Mount&#x27;s Bay with its views of St Michael&#x27;s Mount. This is an island at high tide but can be reached from Marazion by a causeway at low tide.
The path now turns south again, passing the village of Perranuthnoe (or Perran) and Perran Sands, then skirting inland across the neck of Cudden Point to Prussia Cove and Bessy&#x27;s Cove. A larger sandy beach is Praa Sands after which the path climbs up onto a series of cliff tops such as Trewavas Head. This area shows many signs of Cornwall&#x27;s mining history with abandoned engine houses such as Wheal Prosper and Wheal Trewavas close to the path.

After passing through Porthleven the path crosses the shingle bank of Loe Bar with the freshwater Loe Pool behind. At Gunwalloe more cliffs appear, leading to Poldhu Cove overlooked by the radio station on Poldhu Point, then Porth Mellin on Mullion Cove with Mullion Island offshore. Rounding Predannack Head, Vellan Head, and Rill Head (where the Spanish Armada was first sighted on 29 July 1588), the path leads to Kynance Cove and Lizard Point, the lighthouse of which has been visible for some distance. Lizard Point is the most southerly point of the British mainland.

===South Cornwall===

After passing The Lizard the path turns northwards, continuing past Housel Bay and a building used by Guglielmo Marconi for radio experiments, then Bass Point with its Coastguard Station. The Lizard lifeboat station is a sheltered position in Kilcobben Cove. Passing through Cadgwith and across Kennack Sands, the path heads towards Black Head then into Coverack. Once around Lowland Point, The Manacles lie a mile offshore, a reef that has wrecked many ships. The path passes through Porthoustock and Porthallow (the mid-point of the path), then around Nare Point lies Gillan Creek. This can be crossed at very low tide, but most walkers follow the lanes round the head of the creek to reach Dennis Head at the mouth of the Helford River. To cross this wider river means following it inland to Helford where there is a ferry across to Helford Passage on the north bank. Some people take a short cut from Gillan Creek to Helford by a path through Manaccan.

After following the river back through Durgan to the open waters beyond Toll Point, the path skirts Falmouth Bay along Maenporth, Swanpool and Gyllyngvase beaches before passing around the headland beneath Pendennis Castle to enter bustling Falmouth. The castle was built, along with its twin at St Mawes, to protect the deep water of Carrick Roads from attack. This natural haven is what made Falmouth such an important harbour, it being the last good shelter for ships heading westwards towards the Atlantic Ocean.

The path crosses the harbour on the St Mawes Ferry and the Place Ferry (see Fal River Links) and then passes St Anthony Head and Zone Point and northwards past the village of Portscatho and around Gerrans Bay. Beyond Nare Head is Portloe in Veryan Bay. The next big headland is Dodman Point after which the coast path resumes its northwards course through Gorran Haven and the fishing harbour at Mevagissey to Pentewan where the once busy dock has silted up with sand. The path then climbs up around Black Head to reach Porthpean and then Charlestown. This was the first harbour to serve the china clay industry around St Austell and has featured in several films as it is home to a heritage fleet of sailing ships.

After passing Carlyon Bay the path comes to the much busier china-clay exporting port of Par, where it goes inland of the dock site. After passing through the village the path regains the coast at Par Sands and links with the Saints&#x27; Way, a coast-to-coast path across Cornwall, at Polmear. It then follows the cliff tops through Polkerris and around Gribbin Head. From here to Polperro is designated as a heritage coast.

The path now passes Polridmouth (pronounced &#x27;Pridmouth&#x27;) and Readymoney Cove to enter Fowey (&#x27;Foy&#x27;), another busy harbour but this time the deep water quays are situated up river above the town. The River Fowey is crossed on the Polruan ferry, beyond which are some steep cliffs with extensive views. Beyond Lantic Bay lies Pencarrow Head then the larger Lantivet Bay with further cliffs and small coves leading to Polperro, a fishing village which bans cars during the summer.

Beyond Polperro lies Talland Bay and Portnadler Bay, with the bird reserve of Looe Island (also known as St George&#x27;s island) off shore. The path now enters Looe, passing through Hannafore, West Looe then, after crossing the River Looe on a seven-span bridge. The path continues up onto the cliff then heads towards Millendreath then along more cliffs, running past a 60-ft sevenfold labyrinth carved into the turf of the hillside to Seaton, Downderry, and Portwrinkle.

The long beach of Whitsand Bay has a fast-rising tide and is a military firing range so the path runs inland behind Tregantle Fort to reach Freathy and Rame Head. Beyond this lies Penlee Point and then the path turns northwards into Plymouth Sound, skirting Cawsand Bay and Mount Edgcumbe Country Park to reach the ferry at Cremyll. Beyond here lies the Hamoaze, the combined estuary of the Tamar and other rivers.

===South Devon===

The Cremyll Ferry lands in Devon at Stonehouse, one of the Three Towns that make up the modern city of Plymouth. The path follows roads past Stonehouse Barracks and Millbay Docks to Plymouth Hoe with its views across Plymouth Sound. It then crosses Sutton Harbour by the Mayflower Steps then skirts the hill of Cattedown to cross the River Plym by the Laira Bridge to Plymstock. Passing round the edge of the tidal Hooe Lake, the path regains the countryside above Jennycliff Bay, part of the Plymouth Sound, Shores and Cliffs Site of Special Scientific Interest, and follows the cliffs past Bovisand to Wembury, Wembury Marine Centre.

From Wembury the path travels east into the South Hams district to the Warren Point Ferry, across the River Yealm, near Newton Ferrers. The River Erme near Kingston must be forded at Erme Mouth within one hour of low tide. The path then goes past Hillsea Point Rock. The view to the southwest is then over Bigbury Bay past Burgh Island and Hope Cove to the promontory known as Bolt Tail. The next 6 miles (10 km) of cliff top paths from Bolberry Down past Bolt Head and the tidal ria of Kingsbridge Estuary to Prawle Point, belong to the National Trust. The estuary is crossed using the Salcombe Ferry, from Salcombe to East Portlemouth, close to Salcombe Castle and within the South Devon Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB). The path passes through the Prawle Point and Start Point Site of Special Scientific Interest which is recognised as being an important site for solitary bees and wasps, the rare cuckoo bee &quot;Nomada sexfasciata&quot;, and the Cirl bunting.
The path then continues around Lannacombe Bay to Start Point and its Lighthouse and then through Start Bay along a 3-mile (5 km) shingle causeway between Slapton Sands and the Slapton Ley freshwater lake and nature reserve before entering the estuary of the River Dart and historic port of Dartmouth. From Dartmouth, the route uses either the Lower Ferry or Passenger Ferry to cross the river to Kingswear.

Kingswear is the terminus of the Dartmouth Steam Railway which follows the River Dart, but the coast path climbs out of the village in the opposite direction to reach Torbay, known as &quot;The English Riviera&quot;. It passes the historic harbour of Brixham and the seaside towns of Goodrington, Paignton, Torquay and Babbacombe. The coast path then passes along the wooded cliffs above Labrador Bay to reach Shaldon and the River Teign.

Crossing the river by ferry or the long Shaldon Bridge brings walkers to Teignmouth, beyond which the coast path follows the South Devon Railway sea wall to Hole Head where the Parson and Clerk rocks look out to sea. Passing beneath the railway, the path climbs up to the main road, which it follows for a few yards before turning back towards the cliff top (in stormy weather the sea wall is too dangerous and this road must be followed most of the way from Teignmouth). Entering Dawlish along a now by-passed toll road, the coast path descends back to the level of the railway which it follows to Dawlish Warren, although a slightly more landward route is necessary at high tide.

Dawlish Warren is a sand spit and nature reserve that lies at the mouth of the River Exe. The route now turns away from the coast and follows the Exe estuary past Cockwood to Starcross where the seasonal Exmouth to Starcross Ferry crosses to Exmouth. The Exe Valley Way continues beyond Starcross towards Exeter, but when the ferry is not running it is possible to catch a train from either Dawlish Warren or Starcross railway stations to Exmouth railway station.

On the eastern side of Exmouth, the coast path climbs up onto the High Land of Orcombe. This is the start of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The next town is Budleigh Salterton, beyond which lies the River Otter. The path then skirts Chiselbury Bay and Ladram Bay towards Sidmouth which sits at the mouth of the River Sid. Access to the beach is via a wooden staircase known as Jacob&#x27;s ladder. Sidmouth is surrounded by the East Devon AONB. Erosion remains a serious concern east of the mouth of the River Sid. The cliffs have been heavily eroded, threatening cliff top homes and the footpath, which passes along the tops of the cliff, around Lyme Bay, avoiding Hooken Undercliff towards Branscombe. The path then follows Seaton Bay past Beer, with Beer Quarry Caves a man-made cave complex, resulting from the quarrying of Beer stone and Seaton before going through the Axmouth to Lyme Regis Undercliff SSSI and NNR and crossing the border into Dorset shortly before reaching Lyme Regis.

===Dorset===

Across the Dorset border, the Coast Path runs through the town of Lyme Regis where the Cobb breakwater was seen in the film &quot;The French Lieutenant&#x27;s Woman&quot; and features on the film&#x27;s poster. Further east, where it shares its route with the Monarch&#x27;s Way, the path passes through Charmouth, up Golden Cap (the highest point on the south coast), and on through West Bay (near Bridport), to Burton Bradstock at the start of Chesil Beach, an tombolo. At Abbotsbury, the path leaves Chesil beach to follow the shores of the Fleet lagoon, until it reaches the terminus of Chesil beach next to the villages of Fortuneswell and Chiswell on the Isle of Portland. The path circumnavigates the Isle of Portland, passing the lighthouses at Portland Bill and the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy in Chiswell, and returns across Chesil beach to Wyke Regis (encompassing the Rodwell Trail) and along the shores of Portland Harbour to the Nothe Fort in the resort of Weymouth.
In Weymouth the coast path runs along Weymouth Harbour and the Wey Estuary up to Radipole Lake, through the town centre to the Esplanade on the shore of Weymouth Bay, and on to Ringstead Bay, with White Nothe at its eastern end, near the village of Osmington Mills. There is an alternative route around Weymouth and Portland along the South Dorset Downs, which reduces the footpath distance by . Just the loop around the Isle of Portland can be omitted, reducing the journey by .

The coast path then heads towards the Isle of Purbeck, via Bat&#x27;s Head, Swyre Head, Durdle Door—a natural arch which has been described as &quot;one of Dorset&#x27;s most recognisable features&quot;—and Lulworth Cove, &quot;the most visited geological locality in Britain&quot;. Further east is the deserted village of Tyneham, beside Worbarrow Bay, and Kimmeridge, next to Kimmeridge Bay, with its rocky shore and wave cut platform. Between Lulworth Cove and Kimmeridge the path passes through the Lulworth Ranges, which are not always open to the public. When the ranges are in use a road detour is needed.

The coast path then reaches St Alban&#x27;s Head, just to the south of the village of Worth Matravers. Between St Alban&#x27;s Head and the resort of Swanage is Durlston Country Park nature reserve; from Worth Matravers to Swanage the coast path follows the route of the Priest&#x27;s Way. North of Swanage is the chalk Ballard Down, the eastern tip of which has been eroded to form Old Harry Rocks – a series of stacks, arches and caves jutting into the sea between Swanage Bay and Studland Bay. This headland marks the end of the Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site. Behind Studland beach, an extensive system of sand dunes have formed a psammosere, stretching for miles across the Studland peninsula. The peninsula forms one shore of Poole Harbour, one of the largest natural harbours in the world. Part of Studland beach is the National Trust&#x27;s only official naturist beach. The South West Coast Path ends at South Haven Point, where there is a commemorative marker. The Sandbanks Ferry links this to the Sandbanks area of Poole on the eastern edge of the harbour.

==Intersecting and connecting paths==
From Plymouth to Poole the South West Coast Path forms part of the route of the E9 European Coastal Path which runs for 3,125 miles (5,000 km) from Cabo de São Vicente in Portugal to Narva-Jõesuu in Estonia. The route crosses by ferry from Roscoff to Plymouth, and beyond Poole the path follows the Bournemouth Coast Path to Milford on Sea, then the Solent Way (with an Isle of Wight option), South Downs Way, 1066 Country Walk and Saxon Shore Way to Dover, from where it returns to continental Europe. It is also part of the network of routes that form the International Appalachian Trail.

The South West Coast Path, covering such a wide area, inevitably intersects with other, more local, routes, and it connects with many other long-distance paths offering opportunities for even longer expeditions:
*Bournemouth Coast Path, from Sandbanks to Milford-on-Sea (Dorset and Hampshire)
*Celtic Way — runs from the west of Wales to Stonehenge and then heads south-west to Cornwall, a total of 
*Channel to Channel Path, Seaton to Watchet, 80 kilometres (50 mi)
*Coast to Coast, Devon, Wembury to Lynmouth 
*Coleridge Way, from Nether Stowey in the Quantocks across the Brendon Hills and the fringes of Exmoor National Park to the coast at Porlock.
*East Devon Way, Exmouth to Lyme Regis
*Exe Valley Way, Devon – runs from the River Exe estuary to Exmoor
*Liberty Trail, Ham Hill to Lyme Regis (Somerset, Dorset)
*The Macmillan Ways:
**Macmillan Way from Abbotsbury in Dorset to Boston, Lincolnshire 
**Macmillan Way West from Castle Cary in Somerset to Barnstaple in Devon, (Boston to Barnstaple is 
**the Macmillan Abbotsbury Langport Link, which creates a short-cut for walkers from Abbotsbury to Barnstaple, a total of .
*Saints&#x27; Way, Padstow — Fowey (Cornwall)
*Samaritans Way South West, runs from Bristol to Lynton, but only the section from Bristol to Goathurst is waymarked
* Tarka Trail. Between Ilfracombe and Bideford, the path mostly follows a coastal section of the Tarka Trail. For part of this route, the paths follow the course of disused railway lines: the Ilfracombe Branch Line, between Braunton and Barnstaple, and the Bideford Branch Line, between Barnstaple and Bideford.
*Two Moors Way, Devon — Ivybridge to Lynmouth 
*Wessex Ridgeway, from Lyme Regis to Marlborough, which combined with The Ridgeway National Trail, the Icknield Way and the Peddars Way National Trail forms the Greater Ridgeway, , from Lyme Regis to Hunstanton on The Wash
*West Devon Way — Okehampton to Plymouth, 
*West Somerset Coast Path  — Minehead to Steart Peninsula (linking SWCP to the River Parrett Trail), 

==Public transport==

There are regular train services from other parts of the UK to the south west, principal destination stations being Barnstaple, Exeter, Newquay, Penzance, Plymouth and Weymouth. From these places local trains or buses connect to many points of the path. Airports at Bournemouth, Exeter and Newquay are served from a range of national and international destinations.

Using public transport for at least part of the journey means that walkers can plan walks that start and finish at different places, rather than having to circle back to their start point to collect their cars.

More than twenty railway stations give options either for short walks – such as Dawlish to Paignton – or for longer walks over several days. The West Somerset Railway offers steam and diesel services from Taunton to Minehead at the Somerset end of the path (using a connecting bus from Taunton railway station to ), the Swanage Railway connects Swanage to Wareham, and the Dartmouth Steam Railway connects Kingswear and Paignton.

Long-distance bus services connect some coastal towns with railway stations:
* Bideford and Westward Ho! to Barnstaple railway station
* Bridport to Axminster railway station and Dorchester South railway station
* Bude to Exeter St Davids railway station
* Lyme Regis to Axminster railway station
* Seaton and Beer to Axminster railway station
* Minehead to Taunton railway station
* Padstow to Bodmin Parkway railway station
* Sidmouth to Honiton railway station
* Swanage and Studland to Bournemouth railway station
A boat service runs down the River Fal from Truro to Falmouth (see Fal River Links), and between Swanage seafront and Poole Quay.

==Charity fundraising==
Many individuals or organisations use a walk on all or part of the path to raise money for charity.

<doc id="271544" wikidata="Q233326" url="?curid=271544" title="Ranavalona III">
<text>Ranavalona III (; 22 November 1861 – 23 May 1917) was the last sovereign of the Kingdom of Madagascar. She ruled from 30 July 1883 to 28 February 1897 in a reign marked by ultimately futile efforts to resist the colonial designs of the government of France. As a young woman, she was selected from among several Andriana qualified to succeed Queen Ranavalona II upon her death. Like both preceding queens, Ranavalona entered a political marriage with a member of the Hova elite named Rainilaiarivony, who largely oversaw the day-to-day governance of the kingdom and managed its foreign affairs in his role as prime minister. Ranavalona tried to stave off colonization by strengthening trade and diplomatic relations with foreign powers throughout her reign, but French attacks on coastal port towns and an assault on the capital city of Antananarivo led to the capture of the royal palace in 1895, ending the sovereignty and political autonomy of the centuries-old kingdom.

Ranavalona and her court were initially permitted to remain as symbolic figureheads, but the outbreak of a popular resistance movement called the &quot;menalamba&quot; rebellion, and the discovery of anti-French political intrigues at court, led the French to exile her to the island of Réunion in 1897. Rainilaiarivony died that same year, and Ranavalona was relocated to a villa in Algiers, along with several members of her family. The queen, her family, and the servants accompanying her were provided an allowance and enjoyed a comfortable standard of living, including occasional trips to Paris for shopping and sightseeing. Ranavalona was never permitted to return home to Madagascar, however, despite her repeated requests. She died of an embolism at her villa in Algiers in 1917 at age 55. Her remains were buried in Algiers but were disinterred 21 years later and shipped to Madagascar, where they were placed within the tomb of Queen Rasoherina on the grounds of the Rova of Antananarivo.

== Early years ==
Ranavalona III, daughter of Andriantsimianatra and his wife and cousin, Princess Raketaka was born Princess Razafindrahety on 22 November 1861, at Amparibe, a rural village in the district of Manjakazafy outside Antananarivo. Razafindrahety&#x27;s lineage, as niece to Queen Ranavalona II and great-granddaughter of King Andrianampoinimerina, qualified her to potentially inherit the throne of the Kingdom of Madagascar. Her parents assigned the care of the infant Razafindrahety to a slave who served the family.

When she was old enough to attend school, Razafindrahety was taken into the custody of her aunt, Queen Ranavalona II, who ensured she began receiving a private education from a London Missionary Society (LMS) teacher. She was described as an industrious and inquisitive child with a strong love of studying the Bible, learning and reading, and she developed affectionate relationships with her teachers. She continued her education throughout her adolescence at the Congregational School of Ambatonakanga, the Friends High School for Girls, and the LMS Girls&#x27; Central School. She was baptized as a Protestant at Ambohimanga on 5 April 1874. Her teachers consistently described her as ranking among their strongest students.

As a young woman, Razafindrahety married an Andriana (nobleman) named Ratrimo (Ratrimoarivony). Her husband died several years later on 8 May 1883, aged 22, leaving Razafindrahety a premature widow. According to rumor, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony may have arranged to have Ratrimo poisoned for political reasons. The Aristocratic Revolution of 1863, which had been orchestrated by Rainilaiarivony&#x27;s older brother, Prime Minister Rainivoninahitriniony, had replaced the absolute rule of the Andriana with a constitutional monarchy in which power was shared between an Andriana monarch and a Hova (freeman) prime minister. This arrangement was to be cemented by a political marriage between the prime minister and a ruling queen effectively selected by him. As Queen Ranavalona II neared death and the search for her successor began, Rainilaiarivony may have had Ratrimo deliberately poisoned so that Razafindrahety, the most eligible successor, would be free to marry the prime minister and succeed to the throne.

== Reign ==

Ranavalona III was proclaimed queen upon the death of her predecessor, Queen Ranavalona II, on 13 July 1883, and moved into Tsarahafatra, a wooden house on the grounds of the royal Rova complex in Antananarivo. Her coronation took place in the Mahamasina neighborhood of Antananarivo on 22 November 1883, her 22nd birthday, where she was given the title &quot;Her Majesty Ranavalona III by the grace of God and the will of the people, Queen of Madagascar, and Protectoress of the laws of the Nation&quot;. She chose to break with tradition by supplementing the customary retinue of soldiers at her ceremony with a group of 500 male and 400 female pupils from the capital&#x27;s best schools. The girls were dressed in white while the boys wore soldiers&#x27; uniforms and performed traditional military drills with spears. Ranavalona was crowned wearing a white silk gown with a red train featuring embroidery and gold embellishments. The queen was described in the American press in the following terms: &quot;She is a little above the ordinary height and has delicate features, her complexion is a little darker than that of most of her subjects. She appears quite timid and she presides well at the solemn functions of her court.&quot; The British Museum holds a Ranavalona III ten centime coin struck in 1883.

Like her two predecessors, Ranavalona concluded a political marriage with Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony. The young queen&#x27;s role was largely ceremonial as nearly all important political decisions continued to be made by the much older and more experienced prime minister. Ranavalona was frequently called upon to deliver formal speeches (&quot;kabary&quot;) to the public on behalf of Rainilaiarivony and would make appearances to inaugurate new public buildings, such as a hospital at Isoavinandriana and a girls&#x27; school at Ambodin&#x27;Andohalo. Throughout her reign, Ranavalona&#x27;s aunt, Ramisindrazana, acted as an adviser and exercised considerable influence at court. Ranavalona&#x27;s older sister, Rasendranoro, whose son Rakatomena and daughter Razafinandriamanitra lived with their mother at the Rova, was also a close companion. An American journalist who visited her palace reported that Ranavalona spent much of her leisure time flying kites or playing lotto, a parlor game, with her relatives and other ladies at court. She also enjoyed knitting, needlework and crocheting and would frequently bring her latest craft project to work on at cabinet meetings. She had a great love of fine garments and was the only Malagasy sovereign to import the majority of her clothing from Paris rather than London. She invited to Madagascar French stage magician Marius Cazeneuve to perform at her court. Reportedly, the queen and Cazeneuve developed a romantic relationship, and the magician was also working for the French intelligence, promoting French influence at court.

=== Franco-Hova War ===

As sovereign of Madagascar, Ranavalona III became involved in the endgame of the maneuvering that had been taking place between the British and French since the beginning of the 19th century. The tension between France and Madagascar had grown especially acute in the three years prior to Ranavalona&#x27;s succession, with an intensification of attacks in the months prior to her coronation. In February 1883 the northwestern coast was bombarded, followed by the occupation of Mahajanga by the French in May, and bombardment and capture of Toamasina in June. Attacks along the northern coast were ongoing at the time Ranavalona III was crowned in the summer of 1883. Shortly after the French initiated this latest round of hostilities, Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony decided to engage Digby Willoughby, a Briton who had gained combat experience in the Anglo-Zulu War as a member of the Natal Mounted Police, to oversee the nation&#x27;s military affairs and train the queen&#x27;s army to defend the island against the seemingly inevitable French invasion.

Throughout this period Madagascar continued to engage the French in negotiations, but these were to prove unsuccessful with both sides unwilling to capitulate on key points of contention. After two years of stalemate, a column brought an ultimatum to Antananarivo in December 1885, asking for the acceptance of French claims in northeastern Madagascar, a French protectorate over the Sakalava, recognition of French property principles and an indemnity of 1,500,000 francs. This peace treaty was ratified by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony in January 1886 and French government representatives two months later.

Prior to ratification, the queen and her prime minister sought clarification about several articles in the main treaty that stated &quot;foreign relations&quot; would be controlled by a French resident and referenced &quot;establishments&quot; at Diego-Suarez Bay. Two key French negotiators, Minister Patrimonio and Admiral Miot, provided an explanation affixed to the treaty as an annex, which led the rulers of Madagascar to deem the treaty an adequate enough safeguard of their nation&#x27;s sovereignty to warrant their approval and signature. However, the official treaty was published in Paris without the annex or any reference to it. When the annex was later published in London, the French denied it had any legal validity. France declared a protectorate over the island despite the opposition of the Malagasy government and the omission of this term from the treaty.

The international reaction to this latest turn of events was varied and greatly colored by national interests. The British were unwilling to defend Madagascar&#x27;s sovereignty for fear that the French might retaliate and fail to recognize Britain&#x27;s claim to certain protectorates of its own. All official British engagement with Madagascar was henceforth transacted through the French resident, but these communiques were not officially recognized by Ranavalona and her court. The United States and Germany, on the other hand, continued to deal directly with the queen&#x27;s government as the rightful authority in Madagascar. This discrepancy forced a reinterpretation of one aspect of the treaty, resulting in the queen&#x27;s authority over internal affairs being maintained.
In 1886, the queen attempted to solicit the support of the United States in preserving Madagascar&#x27;s sovereignty by sending gifts to then-President Grover Cleveland, including silk &quot;akotofahana&quot; cloths, an ivory pin and a woven basket. However, the United States was neither able nor willing to assert itself militarily or diplomatically in favor of preserving Madagascar&#x27;s independence. Ranavalona signed a treaty granting further concessions to the French on 12 December 1887.

France&#x27;s claim to Madagascar as its protectorate was officially recognized by Britain in the Anglo-French agreement of 1890. Between 1890 and 1894, the French sought to aggressively claim what they believed to be the territorial rights established by the treaty. However, these French land claims and settlements were perceived by Ranavalona and Rainilaiarivony as an unjustifiable encroachment upon Malagasy sovereignty. Ultimately Charles Le Myre de Vilers was sent to persuade the queen and her prime minister to submit to the French interpretation of the treaty with the intent to launch a war and take the island by force if an agreement was not reached. The French offer was flatly refused and diplomatic relations between France and Madagascar were broken off in November 1894.

Upon terminating diplomatic relations, the French bombarded and occupied the harbor of Toamasina on the east coast in December 1894, then captured Mahajanga on the west coast the following month and immediately began their gradual advance, constructing roads through the malarial swamps that hindered passage to the island&#x27;s interior. The main expeditionary troops arrived in May. Over 6,000 of the original 15,000 French soldiers lost their lives to disease as they gradually moved inland, necessitating several thousand reinforcements drawn from French colonies in Algeria and Sub-Saharan Africa. The column reached the capital in September 1895. For three days the Malagasy army managed to hold the French troops at the periphery of the city, but upon French bombardment of the Rova palace compound with heavy artillery, Ranavalona agreed to surrender control of her kingdom to the French.

=== French colonization ===

France officially annexed Madagascar on 1 January 1896. That August, the French officially declared Madagascar to be their colony and exiled Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony to Algiers (in French Algeria) where he died the following year. The queen and much of her administration remained but were afforded no real political power. Shortly after Rainilaiarivony&#x27;s exile, Ranavalona was approached by a French official who informed her that a new prime minister would need to be selected. The queen hastily concluded that General Jacques Duchesne, the French general who had successfully led the military campaign against the Merina monarchy, would be a probable choice. Assuming that Malagasy political tradition would be preserved, Ranavalona believed she would be forced to marry whichever man was chosen for the job and worriedly asked if Duchesne was to be her next husband. Surprised, the French official reassured her that France had no intention of imposing a husband on the queen and would never again require her to marry a prime minister. The queen&#x27;s minister of foreign affairs, Rainitsimbazafy, was nominated to the post of prime minister by mutual consent.

In December 1895, two months after the French capture of Antananarivo, popular resistance to French rule emerged in the form of the &quot;menalamba&quot; (&quot;red shawl&quot;) rebellion. This guerrilla war against foreigners, Christianity and political corruption quickly spread throughout the island and was principally conducted by peasants who wore shawls smeared with the red laterite soil of the highlands. The resistance movement gained ground until it was effectively put down by the French military at the end of 1897. Members of Ranavalona&#x27;s court were accused of encouraging the rebels and many leading figures were executed, including the queen&#x27;s uncle Ratsimamanga (brother of her favored adviser, Ramisindrazana) and her minister of war, Rainandriamampandry. Ramisindrazana, the queen&#x27;s aunt, was exiled to Réunion, as the French were reluctant to execute a woman.

The resistance led the government of France to replace the island&#x27;s civil governor, Hippolyte Laroche, with a military governor, Joseph Gallieni. The day before Gallieni arrived in Antananarivo, he had a message sent to the queen requiring her to present herself and her entourage at the military headquarters, preceded by a standard bearer carrying a French flag. The queen was obliged to sign documents handing over all royal property to France before being placed under arrest and imprisoned in her own palace. She was only allowed to receive visitors who had obtained prior authorization from Gallieni himself. While imprisoned, Ranavalona offered to convert to Roman Catholicism in an attempt to curry French favor but was informed that such a gesture was no longer necessary.

== Exile ==

Gallieni exiled Ranavalona from Madagascar on 27 February 1897, and officially abolished the monarchy the next day. French officials ordered the queen to leave her palace at 1:30 in the morning. She was carried from Antananarivo by palanquin as the city slept, accompanied by 700–800 escorts and porters. Throughout the days spent traveling to the eastern port of Toamasina where she would board a ship to Réunion, Ranavalona reportedly drank heavily. At Toamasina on 6 March, Ranavalona was notified that her sister Rasendranoro and aunt Ramasindrazana would be arriving shortly, as would the queen&#x27;s fourteen-year-old niece, Razafinandriamanitra, who was nine months pregnant with the illegitimate child of a French soldier.

=== Réunion Island ===

Together, the family sailed on &quot;La Peyrouse&quot; to the port of Pointe des Galets, a site twenty kilometers (12.5 miles) from the capital of St. Denis, to secure a discreet arrival. Despite this effort, a crowd of French onlookers jeered and shouted as the boat docked, angry at the queen for the loss of French lives incurred during France&#x27;s campaign to occupy Madagascar. After waiting for the crowd to disperse, the captain escorted the queen and her party into a horse-drawn buggy, the first Ranavalona had ever seen, and drove to the Hotel de l&#x27;Europe in St. Denis. Young Razafinandriamanitra, suffering from the emotional and physical strains of the journey into exile, went into labor shortly after reaching the hotel. She gave birth to a girl on her second day in Réunion, but could not recover her strength and died five days later. The infant was named Marie-Louise and was baptised a Catholic to avoid antagonizing the French. Marie-Louise, who could have become heir-apparent according to the traditional rules of succession, was adopted by Ranavalona as her own daughter.

Within a month the party had been moved to a house owned by a Madame de Villentroy, located at the corner of &quot;rue de l&#x27;Arsenal&quot; and &quot;rue du Rempart&quot; near the French government offices in St. Denis. Ranavalona was reportedly pleased with the two-story house, which had a large walled garden and featured a peaked roof and wrap-around veranda reminiscent of the traditional highland homes of Madagascar. In addition to the queen and her aunt, sister, and grand-niece, the royal household included two secretaries, a cook, a maid, three servants for Ranavalona, and several more servants for her aunt and sister. The queen&#x27;s private pastor was authorized to make visits freely to the royal household.

The queen&#x27;s party occupied the house in Réunion for just under two years. As tensions between the United Kingdom and France began to mount once again, this time over the conflict in Sudan, the French authorities became concerned that elements of the population in Madagascar might seize the opportunity to launch a new rebellion against French rule. The queen&#x27;s proximity to Madagascar was seen as a possible source of encouragement for would-be Malagasy rebels. French authorities made an abrupt decision to remove Ranavalona and her party to Algeria, a more distant location. On 1 February 1899, with very little forewarning, Ranavalona and her family were ordered aboard the &quot;Yang-Tse&quot; accompanied by a secretary-interpreter and several maids. During the 28-day journey to the French port of Marseille, the passengers stopped over at such ports as Mayotte, Zanzibar, Aden and Djibouti. Throughout the trip, the various captains responsible for the journey were under orders to prevent Ranavalona from speaking with anyone who was not French. The party was held for several months at Marseille before being transferred to a villa in the Mustapha Superieur area in Algiers. Ranavalona had hoped to continue on to Paris and was greatly disappointed to learn she was instead being sent to Algeria, reportedly bursting into tears and remarking, &quot;Who is certain of tomorrow? Only yesterday I was a queen; today I am simply an unhappy, broken-hearted woman.&quot;

=== Algiers, Algeria ===

At the queen&#x27;s villa in Algiers, Ranavalona was provided with servants and a French female attendant who kept her under observation and remained present whenever the queen entertained guests in her home. In addition, the government of France initially provided Ranavalona with an annual allowance of 25,000 francs paid from the budget for the colony of Madagascar and authorized by the colony&#x27;s Governor General. Nearly all the queen&#x27;s property had been seized by the colonial authorities, although she had been permitted to keep certain personal belongings, including some of her jewelry. Her initial pension allowed such a humble lifestyle that the colonial government of Algeria lobbied unsuccessfully several times on her behalf to obtain an increase for her. Ranavalona also tasked a servant with selling some of her jewelry for cash, but the plan was discovered by the French colonial authorities and the servant was discharged and sent back to Madagascar.

During the first years of her exile in Algeria, Ranavalona soon discovered the excitement of the socialite lifestyle among the elite of Algiers. She was regularly invited to parties, outings and cultural events and often hosted events of her own. However, homesickness was ever-present and the impossibility of visiting Madagascar contributed to melancholy and boredom. She would frequently take long walks alone in the countryside, along the beach, or through the town to clear her mind and lift her spirits. The queen was eager to see mainland France and especially Paris and repeatedly submitted formal requests for permission to travel. These were routinely denied until May 1901 when Ranavalona received the first of many authorizations to visit France. That very month, the queen moved into a small apartment in the 16th arrondissement of Paris near the Avenue Champs-Élysées and what is now the Place Charles de Gaulle, from which she visited the major sights of the city and was invited to numerous receptions, balls, shows and other events. She was widely received by high society with courtesy and admiration and was offered many gifts including a costly gown. During this first trip, Ranavalona visited the Palace of Versailles, was formally received at the Paris City Hall, and spent three weeks on vacation in Bordeaux. Finally, Ranavalona visited the beaches of Arcachon before exhausting her budget and boarding an Algeria-bound ship at Marseille in early August. The details of her visit attracted much attention from the Parisian press, which expressed sympathy for the queen&#x27;s fate and recrimination toward the French government for failing to provide a larger pension or accord her the consideration she deserved as a recipient of the Legion of Honor.
Ranavalona would return to France six more times over the course of the next twelve years. Her frequent visits and excellent reputation made her the &quot;cause célèbre&quot; of many French citizens who pitied the queen&#x27;s fate and admired her gracious acceptance of her new life. Ranavalona&#x27;s visits were generally accompanied by much media fanfare and the queen&#x27;s popularity among the French public grew to the extent that she was featured on the box of &quot;Petit Beurre&quot; biscuits in 1916. The queen&#x27;s second visit to France occurred in September 1903, when she visited Vic-sur-Cère and Aurillac. Pressure by citizens during this visit succeeded in raising her pension to 37,000 francs. Two years later she would visit Marseille and Saint-Germain and inhabit a large five-bedroom Parisian apartment in the sixteenth arrondissement from which she would attend the Paris Opera, observe a session of the French House of Representatives and be formally received at the Ministry of the Colonies. Again due to pressure from sympathetic French citizens, Ranavalona&#x27;s pension was further raised to 50,000 francs per annum. On her next visit in 1907, the queen would use Dives-sur-Mer as a home base to visit the Calvados region, where she was photographed for the French press. From August to September 1910, Ranavalona would visit Paris, Nantes, La Baule and Saint-Nazaire and was repeatedly the target of undesired attention from press photographers. Her 1912 trip to the tiny, remote village of Quiberville would coincide with the increase of her annual pension to 75,000 francs. The queen&#x27;s final voyage in 1913 would take her to Marseille, Aix-les-Bains and Allevard.

The outbreak of World War I in 1914 put an end to Ranavalona&#x27;s visits to France. Throughout her time in Algeria, she and her family regularly attended the weekly Protestant service at the Reformed Church building in central Algiers. After the war began she sought to contribute by vigorously participating in the activities of the Algerian Red Cross.

== Death and aftermath ==
Ranavalona died without ever having returned to Madagascar, after two formal requests in 1910 and 1912 were refused on the pretext of insufficient funds in the colonial coffers. The exiled queen died suddenly at her villa in Algeria on 23 May 1917, the victim of a severe embolism. Ranavalona was buried at the Saint-Eugene cemetery in Algiers at 10:00 a.m. on 25 May. Her funeral was attended by dozens of personal friends, admirers, Red Cross colleagues, members of her church congregation and prominent figures of the political and cultural elite of Algiers. By nine in the morning, a long line of cars had already formed at the entrance to the cemetery.

This effusive display of respect and remembrance on the part of Ranavalona&#x27;s friends was not mirrored by subsequent actions of the French colonial administration in Madagascar. In June 1925, eight years after the queen&#x27;s death, the Governor-General of Algeria informed the Governor-General of Madagascar by letter that payments for the maintenance of Ranavalona&#x27;s tomb were in default. He urged the colonial government in Madagascar to provide funds for the upkeep of the dilapidated tomb, emphasizing that such neglect was unworthy of the queen&#x27;s memory and the government of France alike. The request was twice refused and the tomb was never refurbished. In November 1938, Ranavalona&#x27;s remains were exhumed and re-interred in the tomb of Queen Rasoherina at the Rova of Antananarivo in Madagascar. A fire on the night of 6 November 1995 severely damaged the royal tombs and destroyed most of the other buildings at the site. The &quot;lamba&quot;-wrapped remains of Ranavalona III were the only ones that could be saved from the flames. These have since been re-interred in the royal tombs at Ambohimanga.

Following Ranavalona&#x27;s death, her aunt Ramasindrazana left Algeria and moved to Alpes-Maritimes where she lived out the few remaining years of her life. The heir-apparent, Marie-Louise, had left Ranavalona&#x27;s villa several years earlier to study at a French high school and would go on to marry a French agricultural engineer named Andre Bosshard on 24 June 1921. Although she continued to receive a small pension from the French government throughout her lifetime, Marie-Louise chose to pursue a career as a nurse and was awarded the Legion of Honour for her medical services during World War II. After Bosshard and the childless Marie-Louise divorced, the young woman reportedly made the most of her new-found freedom as a flamboyant and vivacious socialite. Marie-Louise died in Bazoches-sur-le-Betz on 18 January 1948, without leaving any descendants, and was buried in Montreuil, France.

== Legacy ==
An archive of fashion, photographs and letters telling the story of Ranavalona was bought at auction by the island&#x27;s government in 2020, having been discovered in an attic in Guildford, Surrey. The collection had been owned by Clara Herbert, who worked for the Malagasy royal family from the 1890s to 1920s, and had been passed down through her family. The objects will go on display alongside Ranavalona&#x27;s recently repatriated royal dias in the restored Queen&#x27;s palace in Madagascar.

&quot;L&#x27;Aube rouge&quot; is historical novel about the Franco-Hova wars by the Malagasy writer Jean-Joseph Rabearivelo, largely focusing on Ranavalona III.

<text>Angeln () is a peninsula on the Baltic coast of Jutland, in the Bay of Kiel. It forms part of Southern Schleswig, the northernmost region of Germany. The peninsula is bounded on the north by the Flensburg Firth, which separates it from Sundeved and the island of Als in Denmark, and on the south by the Schlei, which separates it from Schwansen. The landscape is hilly, dotted with numerous lakes. The largest towns are Flensburg, Schleswig and Kappeln.

Angeln is notable for being the putative home of the Angles, a Germanic tribe that migrated to Great Britain during the Age of Migrations and founded the kingdoms of Mercia, Northumbria and East Anglia. The Angles would ultimately give their name to England.

Glücksburg Castle in Glücksburg and Gottorf Castle in Schleswig were the original seats of two historically important dynasties, the House of Glücksburg and the House of Holstein-Gottorp.

==Etymology==
The place-name is first attested in &quot;Widsith&quot;, an Old English poem dating to the 6th or 7th century. It has been linked to the Germanic roots *&quot;angulaz&quot; (&quot;hook&quot;) and *&quot;angw&quot;- (&quot;narrow&quot;), and may have originated as a name for the Schlei. It is unclear whether the ancient Angeln corresponded to the region now denoted by the name or whether it was of greater extent.

== Geography ==

Angeln is one of four peninsulas lining the Baltic coast of Schleswig-Holstein, along with Schwansen, Danish Wahld and Wagrien. As part of the Schleswig-Holstein Morainic Uplands (Ger. &quot;Schleswig-Holsteinisches Moränenhügelland&quot;), formed during the Weichselian glaciation, these peninsulas are hilly and dotted with several glacial lakes.

The Angeln lakes are subdivided into the North Angeln Lake Group (Ger. &quot;Nordangeliter Seengruppe&quot;) and the South Angeln Lake Group (&quot;Südangeliter Seengruppe&quot;). The River Treene, with its main headstreams, Bondenau and Kielstau, rises in Angeln before flowing westwards to join the Eider, the historic border between the Danish and German realms.

The northernmost part of Angeln is the peninsula, which projects into the Flensburg Firth. The western part of the peninsula is known as (&quot;light Angeln&quot;) because of its relatively light and sandy soil. This region represents a transition zone between the Angeln Uplands to the east and the Schleswig Geest to the west. The Schleswig Geest in turn merges into the tidal marshes of North Frisia.

Apart from Flensburg, which is an independent town, the Angeln peninsula belongs to the district of Schleswig-Flensburg, Germany&#x27;s northeasternmost district. This comparatively rural district had approximately 200,025 inhabitants in 2018.
=== Lakes ===
The largest North Angeln lakes are:
* 
* 
* 

The largest South Angeln lakes are:
* Langsee (Schleswig) (Langsøen)
* 
* 
=== Rivers ===
The chain of hills running across Angeln between Husby and Kappeln constitutes the drainage divide between the Baltic and North Seas. East of it, small streams mostly called &quot;Auen&quot; flow towards the Baltic. West of it, most streams flow towards the Treene and later the Eider and hence into the North Sea.

The Treene is the longest tributary of the Eider, and its two headstreams, and , rise in and flow through Angeln. The sources of the Bondenau are in Mohrkirch and in Sörup-Sörupholz. At Mittelangeln-Bondebrück the joins the Bondenau. The Kielstau rises in Sörup-Schwensby, passes through the Winderatter See and flows into the Bondenau at Großsolt, just before the Bondenau enters the Treßsee. Upon leaving the lake the river takes on the name Treene and leaves Angeln to the west. It enters the Eider at Friedrichstadt, which in turn enters its extensive estuary, the , at Tönning.

The largest river system that flows entirely in Angeln from its sources to its mouth is the system of the Füsinger Au. This river is called Loiter Au in its upper course and is formed by the confluence of the Boholzer Au (which is called in its upper course) and the (which is also called Mühlenau, and whose longest tributary is the Flaruper Au). The Füsinger Au flows into the Schlei at Winningmay (municipality of Schaalby), east of Schleswig.
=== Nature reserves ===
There are 10 officially designated nature reserves (Naturschutzgebiete) in Angeln:
* 
* (Höftland Bockholmwick and adjacent steep coasts)
* (Upper Treene Landscape)
* (Esker near Süderbrarup)
* (Pugumer See and surroundings)
* (valley of the Langballigau)
* (mouth of the Schlei)
There is also one nature park, . The nature reserve lies just southwest of Angeln. It stretches along the Danevirke and around the Viking settlement of Hedeby, which constitute a UNESCO World Heritage Site.
==Traffic==
===Rail===

Angeln is served by the Neumünster–Flensburg Railway, part of the Jutland Line, and the Kiel–Flensburg Railway. There is also a heritage railway, the , which runs between Süderbrarup and Kappeln.

===Road===
The Bundesautobahn 7 runs along the western edge of Angeln, connecting Schleswig and Flensburg, before merging into the Danish .

== Languages ==
The language most spoken in Angeln is German. However the peninsula is also part of the language area of Danish and Low German. The latter is more closely related to English than German is, since it was not affected by the High German consonant shift.

Before the 9th century Angeln was inhabited by the Angles, who spoke a West Germanic dialect that would later evolve into English. A language shift to North Germanic occurred following the departure of the Angles, when the peninsula was occupied by Danes. Danish became the main language of the region between the 9th and 19th centuries. In the 19th century another language shift occurred and the predominant language changed from the North Germanic Danish to the West Germanic Low German. Low German has since been gradually superseded by a variety of Standard German with Low German traits.

The variety of Danish indigenous to Angeln was Angel Danish, a dialect of South Jutlandic (the southernmost variety of Danish spoken on the Jutland peninsula, formerly spoken as far south as Eckernförde).

Danish continues to be spoken in Angeln by a minority but the dialects spoken nowadays are Southern Schleswig Danish, which are not dialects of the previously indigenous South Jutlandic but (Low) German-influenced dialects of Standard Danish. The cities with the largest Danish-speaking minorities are Flensburg, Schleswig and Glücksburg.

Many Angeln place-names are of Danish origin, including those ending in &quot;-by&quot; (town), such as Brodersby, Nieby and Husby, and &quot;-rup&quot; (hamlet), such as Sörup, Sterup and Tastrup.

==History==
===Early history===

The region was home to the Germanic Angles, some of whom, together with Saxons and Jutes, left their homeland to migrate to the island of Great Britain in the 5th and 6th centuries.

====Thorsberg Moor as most important Angeln archaeological site====
Thorsberg moor is a peat bog in the municipality of Süderbrarup. This inconspicuous body of water is an important archaeological site and was a Germanic sacrificial bog from the times of the Roman Empire. In the period from the 1st century to the early 5th century objects were sacrificed in several phases in Thorsberg Moor, presumably by members of the West Germanic tribe of the Angles. Numerous important and rich cultural and historical finds were made in the bog in the 19th century. The current name does not allow the assumption that the sanctuary was already consecrated to the god Thor at the time of the Angles. Rather, the naming is based on early medieval Danish influence, especially in the Viking Age. With the migration of most Angles to Britain came widespread discontinuity in settlement and cultural structure in Angeln. Whilst it is possible that the early-medieval Danish settlers did worship Thor, the name is more likely to be traced back to a hill with a Viking-Age burial ground and finds, the Thorsberg.

====Emigration of the Angles to Britain====
The settlement density in Angeln apparently decreased dramatically in the 5th and 6th centuries and many villages fell into disrepair. A sharp decline in grain pollen suggests that fields were deserted. Locations with heavy clay soils were abandoned first. Since more pollen was found at some locations of the Schleswig Geest (the region neighbouring Angeln), it is assumed that the climate had changed. Increased rainfall could explain this move to the sandy geest areas. Another reason for leaving settlements near the coast is believed to be attacks from the sea. This initially regional migration would also explain another phenomenon: it is now considered likely that between the end of the settlement period of the Angles in Angeln and their arrival in eastern and central England up to 100 years passed. The Angles would have initially moved west, to the Schleswig Geest, before leaving their home completely.

For the years 449–455 the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, written around 890, describes how Vortigern, a British king, invited the Angles to come and receive land in return for helping him defend his realm against marauding Picts. Those successful Angles sent word back that good land was available and that the British were &quot;worthless&quot;. A wholesale emigration of Angles and kindred Germanic peoples followed.

The &quot;Chronicle&quot;, commissioned by Alfred the Great, drew on earlier oral traditions and on the few written fragments available. The best of these, written around 730, was by the monk Bede, whose history of English Christianity contains the following brief account of the origin and distribution of the Angles:

The phrase &quot;north of the Humber&quot; refers to the northern kingdom of Northumbria, which included most of northern England and part of southern Scotland. Mercia was located in central England and broadly corresponds to the English Midlands.

This account can be related to the evidence of archaeology, notably the distribution of types of &quot;fibulae&quot;, or brooches, worn by both men and women in antiquity. Eastern and northern Britain were settled by groups wearing cruciform brooches, of the style in fashion at the time in coastal Scandinavia, Denmark, and Schleswig-Holstein south to the lower Elbe and east to the Oder, as well as a pocket in coastal Friesland.

===Later history===

After the Angles departed from Angeln, by the 8th century the region was occupied by Danes. This is reflected in the large number of place names ending in &quot;-by&quot; (town) in the region today. In the 10th century the chronicler Æthelweard reported that the most important town in Angeln was Hedeby.

==Coat of arms and flags==
The unofficial coat of arms of Angeln was designed by Hans Nicolai Andreas Jensen and appeared for the first time in 1847. It consists of nine fields, all but one of which represent the historic Danish hundreds (Danish: &quot;herreder&quot;, German: &quot;Harden&quot;) of Angeln:

* : stylized house
* : Saint Lawrence griddle
* : star and crescent
* : herring and waves
* Eastern Angeln was not part of a hundred, but was directly subordinate to the sovereign. It was only converted into the in 1853, and is therefore symbolized by two Schleswig lions.
* : stylized oak
* : scythe
* : tau cross
* : crossed keys

In the original draft of the coat of arms, the hundred of Husby was symbolically represented by two crossed arrows with a heart in front of them. From 1906 at the latest, the stylized house corresponding to the old hundred seal appeared instead. The original version of the coat of arms can therefore still be found occasionally. The , which only partially lay in Angeln, is not represented in the arms.

Two unofficial flags are in use, one showing the colours of Schleswig-Holstein and the other showing the Nordic cross from the flag of Denmark.

<doc id="271587" wikidata="Q336512" url="?curid=271587" title="Terence O'Neill">
<text>Terence Marne O&#x27;Neill, Baron O&#x27;Neill of the Maine, PC (NI) (10 September 1914 – 12 June 1990), was the fourth Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and leader (1963–1969) of the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP). A moderate unionist who sought to reconcile sectarian divisions in Northern Ireland society and met with his counterpart in the Irish Republic, he was a member of the Parliament of Northern Ireland for the Bannside constituency from 1946 until his resignation in January 1970.

==Background==
Terence O&#x27;Neill was born on 10 September 1914 at 29 Ennismore Gardens, Hyde Park, London, to The Hon, Arthur O&#x27;Neill and his wife Lady Annabel Hungerford Crewe-Milnes.

O&#x27;Neill grew up in London and was educated at West Downs School, Winchester and Eton College. He spent summer holidays in Ulster. Following school he spent a year in France and Germany and then worked in the City of London and Australia. In May 1940 he received a commission at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst, and went on to serve in the 6th Guards Tank Brigade during the Second World War, in which both of his brothers died. Like many other unionist politicians, the rank he held during the war followed him into his political career, hence &quot;Captain&quot; Terence O&#x27;Neill.

On 4 February 1944 he married Katharine Jean, the daughter of William Ingham Whitaker, of Pylewell Park, Lymington, Hampshire. They had one son, Patrick (born 1945), and one daughter, Anne (born 1947). His great-nephew is popular British record-producer and DJ, Fred Again.

Like all Prime Ministers of Northern Ireland, he was a member of the Orange Order.

==Politics==
At the end of 1945, O&#x27;Neill and his family went to live in Northern Ireland in a converted Regency rectory near Ahoghill, County Antrim. In a by-election in 1946, he was elected as the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) MP for the Bannside constituency in the Parliament of Northern Ireland, which sat at Parliament Buildings at Stormont. O&#x27;Neill served in a series of junior positions. He was Parliamentary Secretary to the Ministry of Health and Local Government from February 1948 until November 1953, when he was appointed Chairman of Ways and Means and Deputy Speaker of the House of Commons of Northern Ireland. In 1953 he served as High Sheriff of Antrim. He was elevated to Cabinet level in the Government of Northern Ireland in April 1956 when he was made Minister of Home Affairs and sworn into the Privy Council of Northern Ireland. Six months later he was also appointed as Minister of Finance, a senior portfolio that he administered alongside Home Affairs until he divested the latter to focus on Finance. He remained Minister of Finance until his appointment as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland in 1963.

==Prime Minister==
In 1963, O&#x27;Neill succeeded Basil Brooke, 1st Viscount Brookeborough as Prime Minister of Northern Ireland and Leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. He introduced new policies that would have been unthinkable with Lord Brookeborough as Prime Minister. He aimed to end sectarianism and to bring Catholics and Protestants into working relationships. A visit to a convent proved controversial among many Protestants. He also had aspirations in the industrial sector, seeking improved relations with the trade union movement and attracting new investment from abroad to replace failing industry in Northern Ireland. O&#x27;Neill seemed to strongly believe in industrialisation and modernisation. However it is clear that O&#x27;Neill was in some ways trying to prevent the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) from gaining ground. The arrival of Harold Wilson&#x27;s Labour government in Downing Street meant the NILP had a significant ally there. Wilson was not a committed UUP supporter, so that O&#x27;Neill was the first Prime Minister of Northern Ireland who could not rely on the support of the UK Government.

As O&#x27;Neill promoted industrialisation and modernisation, Taoiseach Seán Lemass was doing similar things in the Republic of Ireland, thus leading to the first real rapprochement between the two jurisdictions since partition. In January 1965, O&#x27;Neill invited the Taoiseach for talks in Belfast. O&#x27;Neill met with strong opposition from his own party, having informed very few of the visit, and from Ian Paisley, who rejected any dealings with the Republic. Paisley and his followers threw snowballs at Lemass&#x27; car during the visit. In February, O&#x27;Neill visited Lemass in Dublin. Opposition to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s reforms was so strong that in 1967 George Forrest – the MP for Mid Ulster, who supported the Prime Minister – was pulled off the platform at the Twelfth of July celebrations in Coagh, County Tyrone, and kicked unconscious by fellow members of the Orange Order.

In December 1967, Lemass&#x27; successor Jack Lynch travelled to Stormont for his first meeting with O&#x27;Neill. On 8 January 1968, they met again in Dublin. On 19 January 1968, O&#x27;Neill made a speech marking five years in office to members of the Irish Association, calling for &quot;a new endeavour by organisations in Northern Ireland to cross denominational barriers and advance the cause of better community relations&quot;. On 20 May 1968, O&#x27;Neill was pelted with eggs, flour and stones by members of the Woodvale Unionist Association who disapproved of his policies.

In 1968, the Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association (NICRA) began street demonstrations. The march across Derry on 5 October 1968, banned by William Craig the Minister of Home Affairs, was met with violence from the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) who used batons on protesters, among whom were prominent politicians. The O&#x27;Neill government was unable to deal with the disturbances, so Harold Wilson summoned O&#x27;Neill to Downing Street. The Stormont cabinet minutes from 14 October show O&#x27;Neill recalling his time in Britain. He stated that Wilson had threatened to take over if O&#x27;Neill could not manage to gain control. Finally he concluded that if they couldn&#x27;t manage it politically then they would be forced into a period of governance by police power alone. The police violence was filmed by RTÉ television and broadcast worldwide. The date of this march is taken by some historians as being the start of the Northern Ireland Troubles.

In response to these events, O&#x27;Neill introduced a Five Point Reform Programme. This granted a number of the concessions that NICRA had demanded but importantly it did not include one man one vote in local government council elections. Despite this the NICRA felt it had made some ground and agreed to postpone its marches. While things were expected to improve, many Catholics felt let down by the limited reforms. A group was formed by university-based activists including Bernadette Devlin and Michael Farrell, named People&#x27;s Democracy, which began a four-day march from Belfast to Derry on 1 January 1969. On the fourth day, the march was attacked during the Burntollet Bridge incident by around 200 hardline unionists. Although many RUC men were present during the attack none intervened. It later emerged that some of the assailants were in fact off-duty policemen. Many marchers were injured, 13 requiring hospital treatment. The Burntollet attack sparked several days of rioting between the RUC and Catholic protesters in the Bogside area of Derry.

In February 1969, O&#x27;Neill called a surprise general election because of the turmoil inside the UUP, after twelve dissident MPs signed a motion of no confidence against O&#x27;Neill, and Brian Faulkner resigned from the Government following its appointment of the Cameron Commission. Although pro-O&#x27;Neill candidates won a plurality of seats in the general election, O&#x27;Neill lost an overall majority among UUP MPs in order to pass his reforms through Parliament.

==Resignation==
From O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s point of view, the 1969 general election was inconclusive. He was humiliated by his near-defeat in his own constituency of Bannside by Ian Paisley and resigned as leader of the UUP and as Prime Minister on 28 April 1969 after a series of bomb explosions on Belfast&#x27;s water supply by the Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) brought his personal political crisis to a head.

In an interview with the &quot;Belfast Telegraph&quot; published on 10 May 1969 he stated: &quot;It is frightfully hard to explain to Protestants that if you give Roman Catholics a good job and a good house they will live like Protestants because they will see neighbours with cars and television sets; they will refuse to have eighteen children. But if a Roman Catholic is jobless, and lives in the most ghastly hovel he will rear eighteen children on National Assistance. If you treat Roman Catholics with due consideration and kindness they will live like Protestants in spite of the authoritative nature of their Church&quot;.

==Retirement==
O&#x27;Neill retired from Stormont politics in January 1970 when he resigned his seat, having become the Father of the House in the previous year. On 23 January 1970, he was created a life peer as Baron O&#x27;Neill of the Maine, of Ahoghill in the County of Antrim. (The Maine (or Main) is a river which flows near Ahoghill.)

O&#x27;Neill spent his last years at Lisle Court, Lymington, Hampshire, although he continued to speak on the problems of Northern Ireland in the House of Lords where he sat as a cross-bencher. He appeared on the BBC Election Night programme in October 1974, where he clashed with the newly elected Ulster Unionist Party MP for South Down, Enoch Powell, over Northern Ireland&#x27;s politics. His reform policies are largely forgotten by British Unionists and Irish Nationalists in Northern Ireland; however, he is remembered by historians for his efforts to reform the discrimination and sectarianism within the region during the 1960s. In retirement he was also a trustee of the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust.

==Death==
He died at his home of cancer on 12 June 1990. He was survived by his wife, son, and daughter. His estate was valued at £443,043.

<doc id="271588" wikidata="Q2439201" url="?curid=271588" title="It (1927 film)">
<text>It (stylized in quotation marks) is a 1927 American silent film directed by Clarence G. Badger, and starring Clara Bow. It is based on the serialised novella of the same name, republished in &quot;&quot;It&quot; and Other Stories&quot; (1927), by Elinor Glyn, who adapted the story and appears in the film as herself.

The film was a box office hit and served as Bow&#x27;s star vehicle, turning her into one of the most popular actresses of the era. It popularized the concept of the &quot;it girl&quot;, with the term &quot;it&quot; defined in the opening as the &quot;quality possessed by some which draws all others with its magnetic force.&quot;

The film had its world premiere in Los Angeles on January 14, 1927, followed by a New York showing on February 5, 1927. &quot;It&quot; was released to the general public on February 19, 1927.

The picture was considered lost for many years; however, in the 1960s, a nitrate copy was discovered in Prague. In 2001, &quot;It&quot; was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being &quot;culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant&quot;.

The film&#x27;s copyright was renewed in 1954, and the film entered the public domain on January 1, 2023.

==Plot==
Spunky shopgirl Betty Lou Spence has a crush on her handsome employer, Cyrus Waltham Jr., the new manager of and heir to the &quot;world&#x27;s largest store&quot;. However, they belong to different social classes and he is already romantically linked to blonde socialite Adela Van Norman. Cyrus&#x27;s inept friend Monty notices Betty, and she uses him to get closer to Cyrus.

When Betty finally gets Cyrus&#x27;s attention, she convinces him to take her on a date to Coney Island, where he is introduced to the proletarian pleasures of roller coasters and hot dogs and has a wonderful time. At the end of the evening, he tries to kiss her. She slaps his face and hurries out of his car and into her flat, but then peeks out her window at him as he is leaving.

The next day, meddling welfare workers are trying to take away the baby of Betty&#x27;s sickly roommate Molly. To protect her friend, Betty bravely claims that the baby is in fact hers. Unfortunately, this is overheard by Monty, who tells Cyrus. Although he is in love with her, Cyrus offers her an &quot;arrangement&quot; that includes everything but marriage. Shocked and humiliated, Betty Lou refuses. She soon strives to forget the whole ordeal ever occurred, forgetting Cyrus for the time being. When she learns from Monty about Cyrus&#x27;s misunderstanding, she fumes and vows to teach her former beau a lesson.

When Cyrus hosts a yachting excursion, Betty Lou makes Monty take her along, masquerading as &quot;Miss Van Cortland&quot;. Cyrus at first wants to remove her from the ship, but he cannot long resist Betty Lou&#x27;s &quot;it&quot; factor; he eventually corners her and proposes marriage, but she gets him back, by telling him that she&#x27;d &quot;rather marry his office boy&quot;, which accomplishes her goal, but breaks her heart. He then learns the truth about the baby and leaves Monty at the yacht&#x27;s helm to find her. Monty crashes the yacht into a fishing boat, tossing both Betty Lou and Adela into the water. Betty Lou saves Adela, punching her in the face when she panics and threatens to drown them both. At the end of the film, she and Cyrus reconcile on the anchor of the yacht, with the first two letters of the ship&#x27;s name, &quot;Itola&quot;, between them. Monty and Adela are upset at losing their friends, but it is implied they pursue a relationship with each other as the film ends.

==Cast==
* Clara Bow as Betty Lou Spence
* Antonio Moreno as Cyrus T. Waltham
* William Austin as &quot;Monty&quot; Montgomery
* Priscilla Bonner as Molly
* Jacqueline Gadsdon as Adela Van Norman
* Julia Swayne Gordon as Mrs. Van Norman
* Elinor Glyn as Madame Elinor Glyn
* Gary Cooper as Reporter

== The concept of &quot;It&quot; ==
The invention of the concept &quot;It&quot; is generally attributed to Elinor Glyn, but already in 1904, Rudyard Kipling, in the short story &quot;Mrs. Bathurst&quot; introduced &quot;It&quot;.

In February 1927 &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; published a two-part serial story in which Glyn defined &quot;It&quot;.

== Production ==
Paramount Pictures paid Glyn $50,000 for the concept, gave her a small part in the film as herself, and gave her a &quot;story and adaptation&quot; credit.

Hope Loring, Louis D. Lighton and George Marion Jr. (intertitles) wrote the screenplay and Carl Sandburg noted that Glyn&#x27;s magazine story was &quot;not at all like the film, not like it in any respect.&quot; In the original version of the story, the character with the magnetic personality was a male. Paramount producers suggested the character be female. Also the original female character, Ava Cleveland, was upper class whereas Betty Lou is working class. Nevertheless, Glyn was fully involved in the film adaptation and was very flexible about the transition.
This is one of the first examples of a &quot;concept film&quot;, as well as one of the earlier examples of product placement. The concept of &quot;It&quot; is referred to throughout the film, including the scene where Glyn appears as herself and defines &quot;It&quot; for Mr. Waltham. &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine is featured prominently in a scene where the character Monty reads Glyn&#x27;s story and introduces it to the audience.

Stage actress Dorothy Tree had her first film role in a small, uncredited part. A young Gary Cooper was cast in a minor role as a newspaper reporter.

==Reception==
&quot;It&quot; was a hit with audiences all over the United States, breaking box office records. Critics praised the film, especially its star, as &quot;a joy to behold&quot;. &quot;It&quot; turned Clara Bow from an up-and-coming movie actress into the biggest movie star of the 1920s who in the process became a film legend as a result of &quot;It&quot;. The term &quot;The It girl&quot; has since entered the cultural lexicon.

A scene from the film is included in the 1931 Paramount promotional compilation film &quot;The House That Shadows Built&quot;.

<doc id="271590" wikidata="Q602288" url="?curid=271590" title="It (novel)">
<text>It is a 1986 horror novel by American author Stephen King. &quot;It&quot; was King&#x27;s 22nd book and the 17th novel written under his own name. The story follows the experiences of seven preteens as they are terrorized by an evil entity that exploits the fears of its victims to disguise itself while hunting its prey. &quot;It&quot; primarily appears in the form of Pennywise the Dancing Clown to attract its preferred prey of young children.

The novel is told through narratives alternating between two periods and is largely told in the third-person omniscient mode. &quot;It&quot; deals with themes that eventually became King staples: the power of memory, childhood trauma and its recurrent echoes in adulthood, the malevolence lurking beneath the idyllic façade of the American small town, and overcoming evil through mutual trust and sacrifice.

King has stated that he first conceived the story in 1978, and began writing it in 1980. He finished writing the book in 1985. He also stated that he originally wanted the title character to be a troll, like the one in the children&#x27;s story &quot;Three Billy Goats Gruff&quot;, who inhabited the local sewer system rather than just the area beneath one bridge. He also wanted the piece to interweave the stories of children and the adults they later become.

The novel won the British Fantasy Award in 1987, and received nominations for the Locus and World Fantasy Awards that same year. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; listed &quot;It&quot; as the best-selling hardcover fiction book in the United States in 1986. &quot;It&quot; has been adapted into a 1990 two-part miniseries directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, a Hindi 1998 television series directed by Glen Baretto &amp; Ankush Mohla, and a film duology directed by Andy Muschietti. Muschietti&#x27;s &quot;It&quot; was released in September 2017 and &quot;It Chapter Two&quot; was released in September 2019.

==Plot==
===1957–1958===
During a rainstorm in Derry, Maine, a six-year-old boy named Georgie Denbrough sails a paper boat along the rainy streets before it washes down into a storm drain. Looking in the drain, Georgie encounters a clown who introduces himself as Pennywise the Dancing Clown. Georgie, despite knowing he should not talk to strangers, is enticed by Pennywise to reach into the drain and retrieve his boat. It then rips his arm off, and Georgie dies.

The following June, an overweight eleven-year-old boy named Ben Hanscom is harassed by a bully named Henry Bowers and his gang on the last day of school, escaping into the marshy wasteland known as the Barrens. There, Ben befriends an asthmatic hypochondriac named Eddie Kaspbrak and &quot;Stuttering Bill&quot; Denbrough, Georgie&#x27;s elder brother. The three boys later befriend fellow misfits Richie Tozier, Stanley &quot;Stan&quot; Uris, and Beverly Marsh, and refer to themselves as &quot;The Losers Club&quot;. As the summer draws on, the Losers each encounter Pennywise in terrifying manifestations: a mummy on a frozen canal to Ben, a fountain of blood (that only children can see) from Beverly&#x27;s sink, a rotting leper to Eddie, drowned corpses to Stan, and a frightening phantom of Georgie to Bill. Meanwhile, an increasingly unhinged and sadistic Bowers begins focusing his attention on his African-American neighbor, Mike Hanlon, and his father. Bowers kills Mike&#x27;s dog and chases the terrified boy into the Barrens, where he joins the Losers in driving Bowers&#x27; gang off in a rock fight, leaving a humiliated Bowers to vow for revenge. Mike becomes a member of the Losers Club after revealing his own encounter with Pennywise in the form of a flesh-eating bird. From Mike&#x27;s historical scrapbook, the Losers realize that &quot;It&quot; is an ancient monster with a hold on the town. Following further encounters, the Losers construct a makeshift smoke hole that Richie and Mike use to hallucinate It&#x27;s origins as an ancient alien that came to Earth, beginning a cycle of feeding on children for a year followed by a 27-year-long hibernation.

Soon, Eddie is hospitalized by Bowers and several of his friends, and Beverly witnesses one of the bullies, Patrick Hockstetter, kidnapped by It in the form of a mass of flying leeches. The Losers discover a message from It in Patrick&#x27;s blood, warning them that It will kill them if they interfere. In hopes that silver can wound It, Ben makes two silver slugs out of a silver dollar, and the Losers enter an abandoned house where Eddie, Bill, and Richie had previously encountered It to attempt to kill It. They manage to wound It with the silver while It is in the form of a werewolf. Deeming the Losers a threat, It manipulates Bowers into murdering his abusive father and chasing the Losers into the sewers to kill them, where his accompanying fellow bullies, Victor &quot;Vic&quot; Criss and Reginald &quot;Belch&quot; Huggins, are both killed by It. This leads Bowers to become lost in the sewers, traumatized.

In the sewers, Bill performs the &quot;Ritual of Chüd&quot; in an attempt to face It in the Macroverse, the alternate universe where It is from. There he meets the monster&#x27;s antithesis, Maturin, an ancient turtle that created the universe. Bill learns that It can only be defeated during a battle of wills, in which he emerges victorious; in doing so, he sees It&#x27;s true form, the &quot;Deadlights&quot;. After the battle, not knowing if they killed It or not, the Losers get lost in the sewers. To try and regain a sense of direction, Beverly has intercourse with each of the boys to bring the unity back to the group. Once they are safely out, the Losers swear a blood oath to return to Derry should It resurface. Bowers, having lost his sanity by the time he washed out of the sewers into a nearby river, is institutionalized after being blamed for the town&#x27;s child murders.

=== 1984–1985 ===
In July 1984, three youths brutally attack a young gay man named Adrian Mellon and throw him off a bridge, where both a bully and Adrian&#x27;s life partner then see a clown appear. Adrian is found mutilated, and the teens are arrested and charged with his murder.

When a string of violent child killings begins in Derry again, an adult Mike Hanlon, now the town&#x27;s librarian, calls up the six former members of the Losers Club to remind them of their childhood promise to return if the killings start again. Bill is now a successful horror writer living with his actress wife, Audra; Beverly is a fashion designer, married to an abusive fellow named Tom Rogan; Eddie runs a limousine rental company and has married a hysterical codependent woman similar to his hypochondriac mother; Richie Tozier is a disc jockey; Ben Hanscom has lost weight and is a successful but single and lonely architect; and Stan Uris is a wealthy accountant. Prior to Mike&#x27;s phone calls, all of the Losers had completely forgotten each other and the trauma of their childhood, burying the horror of their encounters with It. All of the Losers agree to return to Derry, except for Stan, who kills himself in terror of facing It again.

The Losers meet for lunch, where Mike reminds them that It awakens roughly every 27 years for 12–16 months at a time, feeding on children before going into slumber again. The group decides to kill It once and for all. At Mike&#x27;s suggestion, each person explores different parts of Derry to help restore their memories. While exploring, Eddie, Richie, Beverly, and Ben are faced with manifestations of It (Eddie as Belch Huggins and childhood friends in leprous and zombified forms, Richie as a Paul Bunyan statue, Beverly as the witch from Hansel &amp; Gretel in her childhood home, and Ben as Dracula in the Derry Library). Bill finds his childhood bicycle, &quot;Silver&quot;, and brings it to Mike&#x27;s. In the meantime, Audra, who is worried about Bill, travels to Derry; Tom arrives as well, intending to kill Beverly; and Henry Bowers escapes from the mental asylum with help from It.

Henry confronts Mike at the library, but Mike escapes alive. It instructs Henry to kill the rest of the Losers, but Henry is killed while attacking Eddie. It then appears to Tom and orders him to capture Audra, bringing Audra to It&#x27;s lair, where Audra becomes catatonic, and Tom drops dead in shock. Bill, Ben, Beverly, Richie, and Eddie learn that Mike is near death and realize they are being forced into another confrontation with It. They descend into the sewers and use their strength as a group to &quot;send energy&quot; to a hospitalized Mike, who fights off a nurse that is under the control of It. They reach It&#x27;s lair and find that It has taken the form of a giant spider. Bill and Richie enter It&#x27;s mind through the Ritual of Chüd, but they get lost in It. Eddie injures It by spraying his asthma medication down Its throat, but It bites off Eddie&#x27;s arm, killing him. It runs away to tend to its injuries, but Bill, Richie, and Ben chase after and find that It has laid eggs. Ben stays behind to destroy the eggs, while Bill and Richie head toward their final confrontation with It. Bill fights his way inside It&#x27;s body, locates It&#x27;s heart, and destroys it. The group meets up to head out of It&#x27;s lair, and although they try to bring Audra and Eddie&#x27;s bodies with them, they are forced to leave Eddie behind. They realize that the scars on their hands from their blood pact have disappeared, indicating that their ordeal is finally over.

At the same time, the worst storm in Maine&#x27;s history sweeps through Derry, and the downtown area collapses. Mike concludes that Derry is finally dying. The Losers return home and gradually begin to forget about It, Derry, and each other all over again. Mike&#x27;s memory of the events of that summer also begins to fade, as well as any of the records he had written down previously, much to his relief, and he considers starting a new life elsewhere. Ben and Beverly leave together and become a couple, and Richie returns to California. Bill is the last to leave Derry. Before he goes, he takes Audra, still catatonic, for a ride on Silver, which awakens her from her catatonia, and they share a kiss.

==Development==

In 1978, King and his family lived in Boulder, Colorado. One evening, King ventured alone to pick up his car from the repair shop and came across an old wooden bridge, &quot;humped and oddly quaint&quot;. Walking along the bridge caused King to recall the story of &quot;Three Billy Goats Gruff&quot;, and the idea of transplanting the tale&#x27;s scenario into a real-life context interested him. King was further inspired by a line by Marianne Moore—“imaginary gardens with real toads in them&quot;—which in his mind came out as &quot;real trolls in imaginary gardens.&quot; King would return to the concept two years later and gradually accumulated ideas and thoughts, particularly the concept of weaving the narratives of children and the adults they become. King began writing &quot;It&quot; in 1980, and finished the book five years later. King found influence in the mythology and history surrounding the construction of the sewer system in Bangor, Maine.

==Themes==
&quot;It&quot; thematically focuses on the loss of childhood innocence and questions the difference between necessity and free will. Grady Hendrix of Tor.com described the book as being &quot;about the fact that some doors only open one way, and that while there&#x27;s an exit out of childhood named sex, there’s no door leading the other way that turns adults back into children&quot;. Christopher Lehman-Haupt of &quot;The New York Times&quot; noted that &quot;It&quot; &quot;concerns the evil that has haunted America from time to time in the forms of crime, racial and religious bigotry, economic hardship, labor strife and industrial pollution&quot;, and that the novel&#x27;s setting &quot;is a museum filled with the popular culture of the 1950s: brand names, rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll songs and stars, the jokes and routines of childhood in that era&quot;. James Smythe of &quot;The Guardian&quot; opined that &quot;Pennywise isn&#x27;t the novel&#x27;s biggest terror. The most prominent notions of fear in the novel come from the Losers Club themselves: their home lives, the things that have made them pariahs.&quot;

==Release==
On December 13, 2011, Cemetery Dance published a special limited edition of &quot;It&quot; for the 25th anniversary of the novel () in three editions: an unsigned limited gift edition of 2,750, a signed limited edition of 750, and a signed and lettered limited edition of 52. All three editions are oversized hardcovers, housed in a slipcase or traycase, and feature premium binding materials. This anniversary edition features a new dust jacket illustration by Glen Orbik, as well as numerous interior illustrations by Alan M. Clark and Erin Wells. The book also contains a new afterword by Stephen King discussing his reasons for writing the novel.

==Reception and legacy==

&quot;It&quot; received a mostly positive critical reaction when it was released, but controversy arose on the internet due to a graphic sex scene with the seven underaged kids.

Christopher Lehman-Haupt perceived a lack of justification in Stanley Uris&#x27; death and the reunion of the group.

Grady Hendrix described the book as &quot;by turns boring and shocking&quot; and &quot;one of King&#x27;s most frustrating and perplexing books&quot;, and described the behavior of the child characters as idealized and unnatural.

The book&#x27;s sexual content is controversial among critics and readers. James Smythe considered the book&#x27;s descriptions of childhood sexuality to be &quot;questionable&quot;, and was particularly &quot;shocked&quot; by a scene of the Losers Club engaging in an orgy. Grady Hendrix identified this moment as &quot;in a sense, the heart of the book&quot; and a thematic demonstration of the crossing from childhood to adulthood, and concluded that it is &quot;a way for King to tell kids that sex, even unplanned sex, even sex that&#x27;s kind of weird, even sex where a girl loses her virginity in the sewer, can be powerful and beautiful if the people having it truly respect and like each other&quot;.

The novel has been noted for its exceptional length. &quot;Publishers Weekly&quot; expressed particular indignation: &quot;Overpopulated and under-characterized, bloated by lazy thought-out philosophizing and theologizing there is simply too much of &quot;It&quot;.&quot;

The character Pennywise has been named by several outlets as one of the scariest clowns in film or pop culture.

In 2003, &quot;It&quot; was listed at number 144 on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll—one of three King novels on the list.

==Adaptations==
In 1990, the novel was adapted into a television miniseries starring Tim Curry as Pennywise the Clown/It, John Ritter as Ben Hanscom, Harry Anderson as Richie Tozier, Richard Masur as Stan Uris, Tim Reid as Mike Hanlon, Annette O&#x27;Toole as Beverly Marsh, Richard Thomas as Bill Denbrough, Olivia Hussey as Audra Phillips, Dennis Christopher as Eddie Kaspbrak, and Michael Cole as Henry Bowers. The younger versions of the characters were played by Brandon Crane (Ben), Seth Green (Richie), Ben Heller (Stan), Marlon Taylor (Mike), Emily Perkins (Beverly), Jonathan Brandis (Bill), Adam Faraizl (Eddie), and Jarred Blancard (Henry). The miniseries was directed by Tommy Lee Wallace and scripted by Wallace and Lawrence D. Cohen.

In 1998, the novel was adapted into a television series set in India, starring Lilliput as Pennywise the Clown/Vikram/Woh/It, and Ashutosh Gowarikar (Ashutosh), Mamik Singh (Rahul), Anupam Bhattacharya (Sanjeev), Shreyas Talpade (Young Ashutosh), Parzan Dastur (Young Siddhart), Manoj Joshi (Amit), and Daya Shankar Pandey (Chandu), the series&#x27; equivalent of the Losers Club. The series was directed and written by Glen Baretto and Ankush Mohla.

The first of a two-part feature film adaptation, &quot;It&quot;, was released on September 8, 2017. It is directed by Andy Muschietti, with a screenplay by Chase Palmer, Cary Fukunaga and Gary Dauberman. Instead of a dual narrative, the first film is solely an adaptation of the section that features the characters as children, though the setting has been updated to the late 1980s. It stars Bill Skarsgård as Pennywise and Jaeden Martell as Bill Denbrough. Supporting roles are played by Finn Wolfhard as Richie Tozier, Sophia Lillis as Beverly Marsh, Jack Dylan Grazer as Eddie Kaspbrak, Wyatt Oleff as Stanley Uris, Chosen Jacobs as Mike Hanlon, Jeremy Ray Taylor as Ben Hanscom, Owen Teague as Patrick Hockstetter, Nicholas Hamilton as Henry Bowers, Logan Thompson as Vic Criss and Jake Sim as Belch Huggins.

The second film, &quot;It Chapter Two&quot;, adapted the &quot;adult&quot; section and updated the setting to the 2010s, specifically 2016. It starred James McAvoy (Bill), Bill Hader (Richie), Jessica Chastain (Beverly), James Ransone (Eddie), Andy Bean (Stan), Isaiah Mustafa (Mike), and Jay Ryan (Ben). Skarsgård reprised the role of Pennywise and the younger actors returned as well. Principal photography wrapped in 2018, and it was released on September 6, 2019.

On March 21, 2022, &quot;Variety&quot; reported that Muschietti, along with his sister and Jason Fuchs, was developing and executive producing a prequel series for HBO Max, titled &quot;It: Welcome to Derry&quot;. The show is said to take place in the 1960s, before the events of &quot;It: Chapter One&quot;, and will reportedly include the origin story of Pennywise the Clown. Muschietti will direct the first episode, with Fuchs writing all of the episodes for the series.

<text>In Modern English, it is a singular, neuter, third-person pronoun.

== Morphology ==
In Modern English, &quot;it&quot; has only three shapes representing five word forms:
* &quot;it&quot;: the nominative (subjective) and accusative (objective) forms. (The accusative case is also called the &quot;oblique&quot;.)
* &quot;its:&quot; the dependent and independent genitive (possessive) forms
* &quot;itself&quot;: the reflexive and intensive form
Historically, though, the morphology is more complex.

== History ==

===Old English===
Old English had a single third-person pronoun – from the Proto-Germanic demonstrative base *&quot;khi&quot;-, from PIE *&quot;ko&quot;- &quot;this&quot; – which had a plural and three genders in the singular. The modern pronoun &quot;it&quot; developed out of the neuter, singular. The older pronoun had the following forms:
This neuter pronoun, like the masculine and feminine ones, was used for both people and objects (inanimate or abstract). Common nouns in Anglo-Saxon had grammatical genders, which were not necessarily the same as the gender of the person(s) referred to (though they tended to accord with the endings of the words). For instance, Old-English (the ancestor of &quot;child&quot;, pronounced &quot;chilled&quot;) is neuter, as are both and , literally &quot;male-child&quot; and &quot;female-child&quot; (grammatical gender survives here; some 21st-century English speakers still use &quot;it&quot; with &quot;child&quot;, see below).

The word , (which meant &quot;female&quot;, ancestor of &quot;wife&quot; as in &quot;fishwife&quot;), is also neuter. (&quot;Man&quot;) was grammatically male, but meant &quot;a person&quot;, and could, like , be qualified with a gender. (variant , ancestor of &quot;woman&quot;) meant &quot;female person&quot; and was grammatically masculine, like its last element, , and like (variant , &quot;male person&quot;). Archbishop Ælfric&#x27;s Latin vocabulary gives three Anglo-Saxon words for an intersex person, (dialectical &quot;skratt&quot;, grammatically masculine), (grammatically feminine, like its last element, ), and (grammatically masculine).

Similarly, because is feminine, so are (inhabitants of a region), (inhabitants of heaven), and (inhabitants of hell). is neuter, feminine, and both mean &quot;the Angles, the English people&quot;. Nouns for inanimate objects and abstract concepts also had (grammatical) genders. Mark Twain parodied this grammatical structure (which exists in many languages like German) by rendering it literally into modern English:

About half of the world&#x27;s languages have gender, and there is a continuum between those with more grammatical gender (based on word form, or quite arbitrary), and those with more natural gender (based on word meaning). The concept of natural gender was beginning to develop in Old English, occasionally conflicting with the established grammatical gender. This development was, however, mostly to take place later, in Middle English.

===Middle English (1066–1400s)===
In the 12th century, &quot;it&quot; started to separate and appear without an &quot;h&quot;. Around the same time, one case was lost, and distinct pronouns started to develop, so that by the 15th century (late Middle English), the forms of &quot;it&quot; were as follows:

* Nominative: (&quot;h&quot;)&quot;it&quot;
* Accusative: (&quot;h&quot;)&quot;it&quot; / &quot;him&quot;
* Genitive: &quot;his&quot;
* Reflexive:(&quot;h&quot;)&quot;it self.&quot; Also &quot;-selfe, -selve&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)&quot;, -silf, -sijlfe&quot;, sometimes without a space.

During the Middle English period, grammatical gender was gradually replaced with natural gender in English.

===Modern English (a bit before 1550–present)===
Middle English gradually gave way to Modern English in the early 16th century. The &quot;hit&quot; form continued well into the 16th century but had disappeared before the 17th in formal written English. Genitive &quot;its&quot; appeared in the later 16th century and had taken over by the middle of the 17th, by which time &quot;it&quot; had its modern form. &quot;Hit&quot; remains in some dialects in stressed positions only; some dialects also use &quot;it&quot;, not &quot;its&quot;, as a possessive.

== Gender ==
&quot;It&quot; is considered to be neuter or impersonal/non-personal in gender. In Old English, (&quot;h&quot;)&quot;it&quot; was the neuter nominative and accusative form of &quot;hē&quot;. But by the 17th century, the old gender system, which marked gender on common nouns and adjectives, as well as pronouns, had disappeared, leaving only pronoun marking. At the same time, a new relative pronoun system was developing that eventually split between personal relative &quot;who&quot; and impersonal relative &quot;which&quot;. As a result, some scholars consider &quot;it&quot; to belong to the impersonal gender, along with relative &quot;which&quot; and interrogative &quot;what&quot;.

==Syntax==

=== Functions ===
&quot;It&quot; can appear as a subject, object, determiner or a predicative complement. The reflexive form also appears as an adjunct. &quot;It&quot; very seldom appears as a modifier.

* Subject: &quot;It&quot;&#x27;&quot;s there; it being there; its being there; it allows for itself to be there.&quot;
* Object: &quot;I saw it&quot;; &quot;I pointed her to it; It connects to itself.&quot;
* Predicative complement: &quot;In our attempt to fight evil, we have become it&quot;; &quot;It took more than ten years it, to fully become itself.&quot;
* Determiner: &quot;I touched its top.&quot;
* Adjunct: &quot;It did it itself.&quot;
* Modifier: &quot;They were the it crowd.&quot;

==== Dummy &quot;it&quot; ====

A dummy pronoun is one that appears only for syntactic reasons and has no semantic value. One use of &quot;it&quot; is as a dummy pronoun (see also &quot;there&quot;) as in &quot;it&#x27;s raining&quot; or &quot;it&#x27;s clear that you understand&quot;.

In Old English, a subject was not required in the way it is today. As the subject requirement developed, there was a need for something to fill it with verbs taking zero arguments. Weather verbs such as &quot;rain&quot; or &quot;thunder&quot; were of this type, and, as the following example shows, dummy &quot;it&quot; often took on this role.&quot;Gif on sæternesdæg geðunrað, þaet tacnað demena and gerefena cwealm&quot;

If on saturn&#x27;s-day thunders, that portends judges&#x27; and sheriffs&#x27; death

If it thunders on Saturday, that portends the deaths of judges and sheriffsBut these were not the only such verbs. Most of the verbs used without a subject or with the dummy &quot;it&quot; belong to one of the following semantic groups:
# (a)  Events or happenings (&quot;chance&quot;, &quot;happen&quot;, &quot;befall&quot;, etc.)
# (b)  Seeming or appearance (&quot;seem&quot;, &quot;think&quot;, &quot;become&quot;, etc.)
# (c)  Sufficiency or lack (&quot;lack&quot;, &quot;need&quot;, &quot;suffice&quot;, etc.)
# (d)  Mental processes or states (&quot;like&quot;, &quot;list&quot;, &quot;grieve&quot;, &quot;please&quot;, &quot;repent&quot;, &quot;rue&quot;, etc.)
And examples still remain, such as the expression &quot;suffice it to say&quot;.

The same use of dummy &quot;it&quot; exists in cleft constructions, such as &quot;it&#x27;s obvious that you were there&quot;.

=== Dependents ===
Pronouns rarely take dependents, but it is possible for &quot;it&quot; to have many of the same kind of dependents as other noun phrases.

* Relative clause modifier: &quot;That&#x27;s not the it that I meant&quot;; &quot;*That&#x27;s not it that I meant.&quot;
* Determiner: &quot;That&#x27;s not the it that I meant&quot;; &quot;*That&#x27;s not the it.&quot;
* Adverb phrase external modifier: &quot;not even itself&quot;

== Semantics ==
&quot;It&quot; is used to denote an inanimate physical object, abstract concept, situation, action, characteristic, and almost any other concept or being, including, occasionally, humans.



&quot;It&quot; is usually definite and specific, but &quot;it&quot; can also have no referent at all (See Dummy &quot;it&quot;). It can be debatable whether a particular use is a dummy &quot;it&quot; or not (for instance: &quot;Who is it?&quot;—&quot;It&#x27;s me!&quot;).

Samuel Taylor Coleridge proposed using &quot;it&quot; in a wider sense in all the situations where a gender-neutral pronoun might be desired:
The children&#x27;s author E. Nesbit consistently wrote in this manner, often of mixed groups of children: &quot;Everyone got its legs kicked or its feet trodden on in the scramble to get out of the carriage.&quot; This usage (but in all capital letters, as if an acronym) also occurs in District of Columbia police reports.

Some people use &quot;it&quot; as a gender-neutral pronoun.

== Pronunciation ==
According to the OED, the following pronunciations are used:
== Popular culture ==

* Stephen King&#x27;s 1986 book &quot;It&quot; is about a shape shifting, malevolent entity that often manifests as a clown.
* In games of tag, the person trying to tag others is known as &quot;it&quot;.

<doc id="271593" wikidata="Q446685" url="?curid=271593" title="Gerry Collins (politician)">
<text>James Gerard Collins (born 16 October 1938) is an Irish former Fianna Fáil politician who served as Minister for Foreign Affairs from March 1982 to December 1982 and 1989 to 1992, Minister for Justice from 1977 to 1981 and 1987 to 1989, Minister for Posts and Telegraphs from 1970 to 1973, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Industry and Commerce and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for the Gaeltacht from 1969 to 1970. He was a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) for the Munster constituency from 1994 to 2004. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for the Limerick West constituency from 1967 to 1997.

==Early life==

Collins was born in Abbeyfeale, County Limerick, in 1938. The son of James Collins, his father was a former adjutant of the West Limerick Brigade of the Irish Republican Army during the Irish War of Independence. The father took the republican side during the subsequent Civil War and a quarter of a century later was elected to Dáil Éireann at the 1948 general election as a Fianna Fáil candidate.

Gerry Collins was educated at St. Ita&#x27;s College in Abbeyfeale before later attending the Patrician College, Ballyfin. Following the completion of his secondary schooling, he attended University College Dublin, where he became secretary of the Kevin Barry Cumann of Fianna Fáil. He unsuccessfully ran for Student Union president. He was defeated by Brendan Ó Cathaoir. Collins subsequently worked as a vocational school teacher.

==Political career==

Collins first became involved in politics in 1965, when he was appointed assistant general secretary of Fianna Fáil. Following the death of his father in 1967, he was elected to Dáil Éireann for Limerick West in the subsequent by-election. He was also co-opted onto Limerick County Council and various other local committees.

Following Fianna Fáil&#x27;s re-election at the 1969 general election, Collins secured promotion as a Parliamentary Secretary to George Colley, the Minister for Industry and Commerce and the Gaeltacht. Here he largely had responsibility for the promotion of Gaeltacht affairs and the Irish language.

===Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (1970–1973)===

In the wake of the Arms Crisis in 1970, a major reshuffle of the cabinet took place. Four ministers, Charles Haughey, Neil Blaney, Kevin Boland and Mícheál Ó Móráin, were either sacked, resigned or retired from the government, due to the scandal that was about to take place. Collins was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. It was a tough time for Fianna Fáil, as the party nearly faced a split due to disagreements over its Northern Ireland policy. Collins, despite coming from a strong republican background, remained loyal to Taoiseach Jack Lynch in his moderate approach to the Northern Ireland situation.

During his tenure as a Minister, Collins introduced a controversial law which prohibited organisations committed to violence, such as the IRA, from making media broadcasts. On 19 November 1972, an interview with Seán Mac Stíofáin was broadcast on the RTÉ &quot;This Week&quot; radio programme. Mac Stíofáin was arrested on the same day and the interview was later used as evidence against him on a trial of IRA membership, and on 25 November, he was sentenced to six months imprisonment by the Special Criminal Court in Dublin. Political fallout arising from the interview was considerable and some days later, Collins sacked the entire RTÉ Authority as he felt that they disobeyed the controversial new law.

In 1973, Fianna Fáil was ousted after sixteen years in government, as the National Coalition of Fine Gael and the Labour Party took office. Collins was retained on Jack Lynch&#x27;s new front bench as Spokesperson for Agriculture. After two years in that position, he was promoted to Spokesperson for Justice in a front bench reshuffle in 1975. In this capacity, he was highly critical of the government&#x27;s management of the Garda Síochána.

===Minister for Justice (1977–1981)===

In defiance of the opinion polls and political commentators, Fianna Fáil swept to power with a huge 20-seat Dáil majority following the 1977 general election. Collins, at thirty-eight years of age, was one of the youngest members of Jack Lynch&#x27;s new cabinet and was appointed Minister for Justice. Despite the sensitive nature of the portfolio, he was viewed as a safe pair of hands. He had a good working relationship with the Garda Síochána, primarily due to his establishment of the Ryan tribunal, which saw all ranks receive huge pay increases in his first year in office.

In December 1979, Jack Lynch resigned as Taoiseach and as Fianna Fáil leader. The succession resulted in a straight contest between Charles Haughey and George Colley. The latter had the backing of the majority of the existing cabinet, including Collins, however, a backbench revolt saw Haughey become Taoiseach. Collins, much to his disappointment, was retained in his existing position as Minister for Justice, holding office until Fianna Fáil lost power following the 1981 general election.

===Minister for Foreign Affairs (1982)===

The Fine Gael-Labour government was short-lived and Fianna Fáil returned to power, following the February 1982 general election. Collins was rewarded by being named Minister for Foreign Affairs, in Haughey&#x27;s second cabinet. One of the major incidents of his tenure at Iveagh House was the outbreak of the Falklands War. Although Anglo-Irish relations were at an all-time low, Collins opposed the act of aggression by the Argentinian government at United Nations and EEC levels.

The Fianna Fáil government fell in October of that same year and Collins&#x27;s party were out of power following the November 1982 general election. A period of instability followed within Fianna Fáil as several TDs attempted to oust Charles Haughey as party leader. Desmond O&#x27;Malley was seen as the clear front-runner to succeed Haughey, however, Collins&#x27;s name was also mentioned alongside former European Commissioner Michael O&#x27;Kennedy. In the end, Haughey survived as party leader, after being told at a meeting of the parliamentary party by Collins that Fianna Fáil had lost credibility due to his continued leadership. Despite this, he was subsequently appointed front bench spokesperson on Foreign Affairs on the new front bench.

===Minister for Justice/Foreign Affairs (1987–1992)===
The results of the 1987 general election saw Fianna Fáil return to power as a minority government. Collins was disappointed to return to his old position as Minister for Justice, preferring instead to take over as Foreign Minister, however, he was once again regarded as a safe pair of hands in a controversial portfolio.

Fianna Fáil retained power following the 1989 general election, albeit with the support of the Progressive Democrats in a coalition government. Collins returned to the cabinet in his preferred position as Minister for Foreign Affairs. January 1990, saw him take over as President of the European Community Council of Ministers during Ireland&#x27;s six-month tenure. This was largely seen as a very successful presidency for the Irish government and was a personal triumph for Collins.

In 1991, tensions began to surface within Fianna Fáil regarding the continued leadership of Charles Haughey. Minister for Finance Albert Reynolds was the main challenger, however, he had little support from his cabinet colleagues. In an infamous interview on the &quot;Six One News&quot; Collins made a plea to Reynolds asking him not to challenge Haughey for the leadership of the Fianna Fáil party: &quot;This is going to wreck our party right down the centre and it&#x27;s going to burst up government&quot;. https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-30278425.html The incident was much parodied, particularly by Dermot Morgan later that year. Reynolds&#x27;s leadership challenge failed on that occasion and Haughey survived.

In February 1992, Haughey stepped down as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader and Reynolds immediately threw his hat in the ring in the leadership contest. Collins contemplated running in the leadership race after several approaches from his colleagues, however, in the end, he declined to stand. Reynolds won the subsequent leadership election by a large majority. The formation of his new cabinet caused widespread shock as Collins and seven of his cabinet colleagues were effectively sacked in favour of supporters of the new Taoiseach. This effectively brought Collins&#x27;s domestic career in politics to an end.

===Member of the European Parliament (1994–2004)===

In 1994, Collins was elected as an MEP for the Munster constituency. He retired from domestic politics at the 1997 general election, being replaced by his brother, Michael J. Collins. Collins was re-elected to the European Parliament in 1999 but lost his bid for another term at the 2004 European Parliament elections. After this defeat, he announced his retirement from politics.

<doc id="271597" wikidata="Q1531370" url="?curid=271597" title="Outliner">
<text>An outliner (or outline processor) is a specialized type of text editor (word processor) used to create and edit outlines, which are text files which have a tree structure or a tree view, for organization. Textual information is contained in discrete sections called &quot;nodes&quot;, which are arranged according to their topic–subtopic (parent–child) relationships, like the members of a family tree. When loaded into an outliner, an outline may be collapsed or expanded to display as few or as many levels as desired.

Outliners are used for storing and retrieving textual information, with terms, phrases, sentences, or paragraphs attached to a tree. So rather than being arranged by document, information is arranged by topic or content. An outline in an outliner may contain as many topics as desired. This eliminates the need to have separate documents, as outlines easily include other outlines just by adding to the tree.

The main difference between a hand-written outline and a digital one is that the former is usually limited to a summary or blueprint of a planned document, while the latter may easily include all of the content of the entire document and many more. In other words, as a hand-written work an outline is a writing tool, but on a computer, it is a general purpose format supported by a robust development and display medium capable of handling knowledge from its creation to its end usage.

Outliners may be used in content creation instead of general word processors for capturing, organizing, editing, and displaying knowledge or general textual information. Outliners are ideal for managing lists, organizing facts and ideas, and for writing computer programs. They are also used for goal and task management (including personal information management and project management), and for writing books and movie scripts.

An alternative to outliners are mind mappers, which display a tree structure as a node–link diagram.

== Design ==
The principal attribute of outline editors is that they support or enforce the use of a hierarchy of their items. 
* Editing: Sound parent-child relationships are enforced when the user modifies the document structure. For example:
** Promoting, demoting, copying, or deleting a parent has the same effect on the children.
** Every item entry must be within one level of its predecessor, such that each item must be a sibling or child of the preceding item (thus, no item can be a grandchild of the preceding item).
* Viewing: The tool enables the user to affect the display by level. For example:
** Applying styles by outline level (e.g., bold all 1st level items).
** Displaying selected levels (e.g., show all 1st and 2nd level items, but none deeper).
** Lifting an entire section out to work on it in isolation, ignoring everything else during that editing, then dropping it back into place (known as hoisting and de-hoisting).
* Search/Filter: The tool displays only items that contain the query terms plus their ancestors (parent, grandparent...) to give them context.
* File import and export: Both the content and structure of outlines are conveyed when files are imported or exported (e.g., from and to tab-indented files).
* Fields/Columns: Items can also have additional fields of information. This data can be shown as columns of data in the outline or as fields in the second pane (see &#x27;Layout&#x27; below). Some outliners also allow the user to create custom fields and/or filter on fields. It can be changed further.

== Layout ==

There are two basic types of outliners: one-pane or &quot;intrinsic&quot;, and two-pane or &quot;extrinsic&quot;, each with its strengths and weaknesses.

A one-pane outliner is known as an &quot;intrinsic&quot; outliner because the text itself is organized into an outline format—individual sections (such as paragraphs) of text can be collapsed or expanded, while keeping others in view. Everything is displayed within a single area, hence the term &quot;one pane&quot;. One of the strengths of one-pane outliners is that, because the text itself is what is structured and because several nodes of text are visible at once, it is easy to edit across sections. The drawback is that, because the structure is not always visible, there is not as strong an overview of the whole or ability to quickly navigate between sections as with a two-pane outliner. Some word processors, such as Microsoft Word, have an Outline Mode, or View, to help with structuring documents.

A two-pane outliner separates structure from content—the structure is &quot;extrinsic&quot; to the text. A tree structure with node titles is presented in one pane, and the text is shown in another. Since the structure is always clearly shown at all times separately from content, this format allows for a quick overview of the structure, and easy navigation. The drawback is that since only one node&#x27;s worth of text is shown at one time and navigation has the additional step of crossing panes, the structure is more rigid, making editing across nodes more difficult. This view is similar to many file browsers and email programs (which can be thought of as three-pane outliners). This type of structure is useful also as a document management tool where the second pane is a document in place of textual information.
A one- and two-pane outliner may be combined as a hybrid. This allows multiple notes&#x27; text and graphics to be shown at the same time. The organizational power of outline in hybrid is in the parent outline structure, not in the second pane text, making it a very effective structure for topical organization. One additional advantage of hybrid is that single pane can be used as single pane outliner with second pane used for notes or reference tracking.

A third approach to &quot;intrinsic&quot; outlines is the multi-column outliner. It is similar to the one-pane outliner in that the text itself is organized into an outline format. However, the text sections do not collapse or expand, and all sections are visible but held in a separate column (one for each level). This approach allows structure and content to be visible at the same time.

== File formats ==
Several file formats support an outline structure natively or encourage the use/creation of outline structures.

* XML - XML&#x27;s purpose is to aid information systems in sharing structured data
* HTML/XHTML - outlines relatively trivial thanks to nested markup
* OPML - simple XML-based format designed for outlines, but also used for syndication feedlists
* OML - alternative to OPML
* RDF - (various formats) has web-oriented node &amp; arc graph model, a subset can be used for outline
* XOXO - dedicated HTML-based microformat for outlines
* CHM - standard Windows format for help, books, etc.

== List of outliners ==
=== Desktop outliners ===

=== Browser-based outliners ===

This table shows a list of notable browser-based outliners categorised by the functionality that they provide (see &#x27;Design&#x27; above). Browser-based outliners run inside a desktop or mobile web browser (smart phone or tablet) and may synchronise the outline&#x27;s data with a remote server or store it locally on the user&#x27;s device.

<doc id="271599" wikidata="Q1888501" url="?curid=271599" title="Stellvia">
<text>, also known as Stellvia of the Universe, is an anime series set in space. As a prelude to the series, the Earth of year 2167 AD is shown to be devastated by a powerful electromagnetic shockwave. This is caused by a nearby star, Hydrus Beta, 20 light-years away, going supernova. As a result, 3 billion of the 14 billion people on Earth were wiped out. The series itself is set 189 years later, in the year 2356 AD. Civilization has been rebuilt with humanity having united together to face the coming of the second shockwave of the supernova. The second shockwave, unlike the first, is to contain a great deal of matter composed of the remnants of the star itself. Stellvia ran for 26 episodes and was produced by the animation studio Xebec. It was distributed in the United States by Geneon. In September 2007 Geneon halted all distribution of anime DVDs in America, including Stellvia. A sequel was originally announced for 2005, but was canceled after internal difficulties.

Beginning with the May 2003 issue, a manga adaptation by Ryo Akizuki was serialized in &quot;Dengeki Daioh&quot; and has been published in the US as a two volume graphic novel series by DrMaster. The word Stellvia is composed of two Latin words, &quot;stella&quot; meaning star(s) and &quot;via&quot; meaning street or road. Therefore, Stellvia is roughly translated as &quot;The Road to the Stars&quot;.

The series makes references to things such as Theory of knowledge, CAS, and Extended Essay, which suggests that Stellvia might have been partially inspired by the International Baccalaureate program, or at least, included an Ex-IB student in its development. 

In 2018, Discotek Media announced that they have rescued the series following Geneon&#x27;s downfall.

The series opening theme is &quot;&quot; by angela.

==Plot==
The series takes place in the year 2356 A.D., around 189 years after a worldwide catastrophe had wiped out 10% of Earth&#x27;s population. To keep track on all space activities, mankind has built numerous colossal space stations called &quot;foundations&quot; all across the Solar System. After passing the Space Academy&#x27;s entrance exams, Shima Katase embarks to the Earth-based foundation Stellvia to fulfill her dreams of seeing the galaxy and to prevent any more interstellar catastrophes from destroying Earth, once and for all.

==Characters==

: The protagonist of the story is Shima (or &quot;Shīpon ()&quot; as she is dubbed by Arisa) who joins the Stellvia foundation&#x27;s space program so that she could &quot;see the stars while looking forward, rather than having to look up&quot;. In the beginning, she fluctuates between complete confidence in her abilities and believing she couldn&#x27;t do anything. The series depicts her as extremely diligent, although she is also a natural genius.

: As the series progresses, she learns to understand her mistakes and not think that she has to be perfect or else fail. For instance, after a rocky start to her training, during which she was dead last in her class at piloting, she takes the advice of Kouta Otoyama and realizes she was trying to keep track of far too much information on her ship displays. Her piloting improves dramatically as a result. However, she still will lose her confidence often. Once she is like that she will get into a deep depression like a little kid thinking that it is because she does not have talent. Actually, Shima has a rare talent. Shima is offered to be the 5th member of the Big 4, after passing the test. Despite her early setbacks as a pilot, her programming abilities are top notch from the very start, and she eventually combines the two in order to become even more formidable in the cockpit. She is called Shipon because the first time she piloted one of the Biancas she flew around like a ping-pong ball. She and Kouta develop a romantic relationship (they share their first kiss on episode 12). She likes Kouta very much but somehow gets irritated when he can&#x27;t understand her. During the genesis mission she was piloting Halcyon (also called Lucyon by Arisa and Rinna). Some irregularities were interrupting the Infinity, so Halcyon released its barrier and absorbed the irregularities. She almost died at that risk. It is shown that she loves Kouta very much by almost sacrificing her life by saving him from the irregularities.

: Kouta is an enigmatic character. He and Shipon develop a romantic relationship (they share their first kiss in episode 12) but there&#x27;s still a lot about him that remains unknown. He has an older sister who runs an astronomical observatory in Japan. He often gives advice which is as enigmatic as himself.

:He consistently achieves rank C in every class, without exception, regardless of how easy or hard the subject is. And when he was warned of the possibility of Ayaka attacking Shipon during training, he displays extraordinary piloting abilities beyond what his ship should have been capable of handling. Another example would be during a simulator-game where Rinna scored Rank A, and Shima scored Rank B, but he scored Rank S. When Shima asks why Kouta does not do the best during class, especially since he is capable of it, he merely says: he wonders why also. Pierre once remarks &quot;Talented hawks hide their talons&quot; when referring to Kouta&#x27;s skills.

:On a different note, James was curious of Kouta&#x27;s &#x27;vision&#x27; and said he was chosen by the universe.

: Arisa is Shipon&#x27;s best friend at the Stellvia foundation. They meet on the shuttle going to the station from Earth at the beginning of the term, and find themselves rooming together and in the same class as well. Though Arisa is nowhere near Shipon in academic or piloting ability, she finds Shipon to be an inspiration to improve herself, and calls Shipon her &quot;Star of Hope&quot;. Later in the series, she begins focusing on becoming a mechanic, rather than a pilot.

: Rinna is a transfer student from the Ultima foundation, and considers Shipon to be both a friend and chief rival. Rinna is a few years younger than Shipon and most of the other students, but because there are few children at Ultima (it being the newest of the foundations, and still incomplete), she has little to do with herself but play with simulators. As a result, she&#x27;s far better at piloting and zero-G movement than most people years older than she is.

: Yayoi is one of the older students in Shipon&#x27;s class. Yayoi had been in Stellvia&#x27;s training program 2 years before, but left after a flight training accident. Ayaka Machida attempted to save her, and failed, but it turned out the &quot;accident&quot; was intentionally caused by Ayaka in the first place.

: Recognizing the signs of another &quot;accident&quot; when Ayaka took Shipon out to train alone, she warns Kouta of what might be about to happen. Kouta is able to prevent another tragedy.

: Despite the attacks on herself and Shipon, Yayoi lies to protect Ayaka when it looked like she might face expulsion from Stellvia.

: Akira is a quiet and somewhat taciturn member of Shipon&#x27;s class as well as Yayoi&#x27;s roommate. Though she becomes irritated easily when around people too much, she learns to enjoy spending time with Yayoi, Shipon, Arisa and the others of their group. Late in the series, she starts dating JoJo.

: One of the &quot;Big 4&quot; of Stellvia, (older students who are at the top of their classes), Ayaka is shown as competitive in the extreme. She has something of an inferiority complex which drives her to be the absolute best, and she can&#x27;t tolerate seeing others better than her.

: Two years in the past, when Yayoi was her classmate, she arranged an accident to ensure her own position at the top of the class. Things went a little out of hand, however, and it looked like Yayoi might lose her life, so Ayaka rescued her. Yayoi was hospitalized and traumatized, and left Stellvia for a time. Now with Shima Katase looking like she would surpass Ayaka as well, the same thing almost happened. Had Yayoi not returned to Stellvia and recognized the danger Shipon might be in, Ayaka might have seriously injured or even killed her. Due to Yayoi covering up the truth of the earlier incident, Ayaka was not expelled from Stellvia, but was suspended for a time.

: After Yayoi forgives Ayaka for nearly causing her to lose her life.

: Richard is the Head Teacher of Stellvia&#x27;s Space Academy. He is also the one who conducted the entrance interview for Shima. He is avuncular and usually takes the optimistic view of events. Richard also encourages his peers to put more trust in the prep students when events put them in critical situations. Richard plays a lot of chess with Hutter.

: Hutter is a teacher at Stellvia&#x27;s Space Academy. He appears unemotional and calm at all times. Usually, Hutter plays the Devil&#x27;s Advocate against Richard James&#x27; optimism. He helps Shima with her confidence towards the end of the series. He is a sentient alien in origin later on in the series.

: Shirogane is another teacher at Stellvia&#x27;s Space Academy; he appears to teach programming. He is particularly enthusiastic about the school&#x27;s athletics carnival and Astroball, (a game that has some similarities with Lacrosse), which he played in his student days at Stellvia. Passionate and determined, Jinrai is intent upon having the students&#x27; voices heard when no-one will listen. Jinrai has feelings for the flirtatious school nurse Ren.

: Instructor in charge of Pilot Training at Stellvia. She used to be an elite pilot, and spent some time wallowing in despair after losing the &quot;elite&quot; tag. However, she recovers from this (after an incident on a space station that was under construction) and chooses to become an instructor at Stellvia. She is tough toward the students because she wants them to succeed, she has a loving smile toward the childlike attributes of her students and is very scary when she is mad.

; Ren Renge

: A nurse at Stellvia. Ren is very flirtatious and early on in the series dates different men, which causes Jinrai to become jealous. She also works closely with the pilots, especially Kouta, who she assists with training for missions. She seems to also have feelings for Jinrai.

: Another of Shipon&#x27;s classmates, Jojo (as he is called) is loud and enthusiastic. He is not very good in his studies nor pilot training and sometimes get needled because of it. Nevertheless, he is not all bad apples, he eventually starts dating Akira later on in the series. He sometimes has some rather good things to say that are very influential, he tries to cheer Akira up one time when she is depressed at the gap between her and the top students.

; Pierre Takida

: Another of Shipon&#x27;s classmates, Pierre is good looking and a big talker, but doesn&#x27;t seem to have a lot more than that going for him. He likes to hit on virtually every girl he lays eyes on, even Rinna in one episode. He shows particular interest in Yayoi, but Yayoi is adamant in refusing him.

: Another of Shipon&#x27;s classmates, he is seen hanging out with Joey and Pierre. Others call him by his nickname, Dai, which is another reading for his given name in kanji (大). In the last few episodes he becomes very serious and says some very influential things which is broadcast through the solar system as the last sounds from Stellvia before the inevitable end.

: One of the Big 4. She usually quotes something of Shakespeare (sometimes attributing the quote to the wrong play) or the Bible. Nothing much else is known about her.

; Kent Austin

: One of the Big 4. He usually tries to stir Ayaka up with information that could be potential competition for her with no intention of any of it leading to the &quot;accidents&quot; arranged by Ayaka. He gets Shipon and her friends out of a spot of trouble at the beginning when he saw them as he was passing by. Kent seems to like Ayaka more than just a friend. Though he doesn&#x27;t try to make anything out of it.

; Ritsuo Shoujin

: One of the Big 4. Devoted to training, he is described as being a &quot;Ninja&quot; by Shipon. Shoujin is very quiet and reserved, rarely speaking. He merely nods and &quot;hmm&quot;&#x27;s when in agreement.

==Media==

===Anime===
===Manga===
===Video games===

Two video games have been released based on the anime series, both named &quot;Uchuu no Stellvia&quot;. The PlayStation 2 game was released on the 22 January 2004. The Game Boy Advance game was released on the 23 April 2004. Both games are adventure dating simulations though they do vary in gameplay.

In the PlayStation 2 game, the player assumes the role of a new student who has enrolled at the Stellvia Space Station Foundation. Each day he assigns various commands on what to do such as studying or resting in the same type of gameplay that &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; has except for weekends since there is no school then. At the weekends he may invite a character on a date. There are various events to be seen in the game and there are 10 multiple endings. The game resembles the aforementioned &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; game series in many ways (though in &quot;Tokimeki Memorial&quot; the player only assigns various commands for the coming week and not for each day).

The Game Boy Advance game is different from the PlayStation 2 game in terms of gameplay and plays a lot like the famous &quot;Sotsugyou series&quot; of games also known as &quot;Graduation&quot; in the west. The main difference in this game as opposed to the PlayStation 2 game is that the player assumes the role of a new teacher instead of a student in the PS2 game. He must teach the four main heroines (Ayaka and Rinna also come into the game later on as his students) various subjects so that they are prepared for the Great Mission. The game is like &quot;Graduation&quot; in that the player has to balance out the various girl&#x27;s stats and must not neglect them since in this case, they start to skip classes and the game can end. Throughout the classes the player character must ask the girl&#x27;s various questions on the corresponding subject. After a question a number of things can happen. A girl may put up her hand to answer the question, the player can also choose one of the girls to answer or can answer the question themselves. The player may also individually teach a specific girl on subjects. Various events can be seen with the various characters from the series at lunchtime or after school.

<doc id="271600" wikidata="Q1535009" url="?curid=271600" title="Golden Horseshoe">
<text>The Golden Horseshoe () is a secondary region of Southern Ontario, Canada, which lies at the western end of Lake Ontario, with outer boundaries stretching south to Lake Erie and north to Lake Scugog, Lake Simcoe and Georgian Bay of Lake Huron. The region is the most densely populated and industrialized in Canada. Based on the 2021 census, with a population of 7,759,635 people in its core and 9,765,188 in its greater area, the Golden Horseshoe accounts for over 20 percent of the population of Canada and more than 54 percent of Ontario&#x27;s population. It is part of the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor, itself part of the Great Lakes megalopolis.

The core of the Golden Horseshoe starts from Niagara Falls at the eastern end of the Niagara Peninsula bordering the United States via New York and extends west, wrapping around the western end of Lake Ontario at Hamilton and then turning northeast to Toronto (on the northwestern shore of Lake Ontario), before finally terminating at Clarington in Durham Region. The term Greater Golden Horseshoe is used to describe a broader region that stretches inland from the core to the area of the Trent–Severn Waterway, such as Peterborough, in the northeast, to Barrie and Lake Simcoe in the north, and to the Grand River area, which includes cities such as Brantford and Guelph, to the west. The extended region&#x27;s area covers approximately , out of this, or approximately 22 percent of the area is covered by the environmentally protected Greenbelt. The Greater Golden Horseshoe forms the neck of the Ontario Peninsula.

==Etymology==

The &quot;horseshoe&quot; part of the region&#x27;s name is derived from the characteristic horseshoe shape of the west end of Lake Ontario. The &quot;golden&quot; part is historically attributed to the region&#x27;s wealth and prosperity, according to the &quot;Canadian Oxford Dictionary&quot;.

The phrase &quot;Golden Horseshoe&quot; was first used by Westinghouse Electric Corporation president Herbert H. Rogge in a speech to the Hamilton Chamber of Commerce on January 12, 1954:

The speech writer who actually penned the phrase was Charles Hunter MacBain, executive assistant to five Westinghouse presidents including Rogge.

==Definition==
The Golden Horseshoe was officialized on July 13, 2004, in a report from the provincial Ministry of Public Infrastructure Renewal titled &quot;Places to Grow&quot;, in which the region&#x27;s borders extended west to Waterloo Region, north to Barrie / Simcoe County, and northeast to the county and city of Peterborough. A subsequent edition released on February 16, 2005, broadened the term further, adding Brant, Haldimand and Northumberland Counties to the region. The Greater Golden Horseshoe region is officially designated in Ontario Regulation 416/05 under the &quot;Places to Grow Act&quot;. The designation Greater Golden Horseshoe has legal significance with respect to taxation: in April 2017, the Government of Ontario announced plans to impose a 15 per cent Non-Resident Speculation Tax (NRST) on non-Canadian citizens, non-permanent residents and non-Canadian corporations (with exceptions or rebates for refugees, qualifying students and certain people working in Ontario) buying residential properties containing one to six units in the Greater Golden Horseshoe (GGH).

The provincial transit authority Metrolinx makes use of the term Greater Golden Horseshoe. The Metrolinx definition is consistent with the original 2004 &quot;Places to Grow&quot; definition. However, the city and county of Peterborough is not included.

==Demographics==
===Population===


=== Ethnicity ===
The Golden Horseshoe is among the most multicultural regions in Canada. 

In 2021, there were 3,762,090 people of European heritage, forming a plurality of the population (49.0%); the next largest groups were those of South Asian descent (1,273,525 people or 16.6%) and those of East Asian heritage (813,015 people or 10.6%)
==Economy==
The economy of this region is very diverse. , the Toronto Stock Exchange is the third-largest in North America by market capitalization (after the New York Stock Exchange and Nasdaq), and seventh-largest in the world. 

Cities including Hamilton, Oshawa, Oakville, Whitby and Kitchener all contain major large-scale industrial production facilities, Hamilton being dominated by the steel industry and Oakville and Oshawa primarily in the automotive industry. Other significant automotive-production facilities also exist in Brampton, and St. Catharines. While manufacturing remains important to the economy of the region, the manufacturing sector has experienced a significant decline since 2000 as a result of unfavourable currency exchange rates, increasing energy costs, and reduced demand from the United States, which is by far the largest market for Ontario&#x27;s goods.

The Port of Hamilton and the Port of Toronto are the two largest inland ports on Lake Ontario. The Welland Canal system handles tanker ships and recreational traffic through the Great Lakes. Large rail and truck distribution facilities are located in Toronto, Vaughan and Brampton. Food processing is also a key ingredient in the economy. 

Niagara Falls has one of the world&#x27;s largest per-capita tourist economies, benefiting from millions of tourists coming to see its waterfalls, shop in its numerous stores, and visit its many attractions. The winemaking and fruit-growing industries of the Niagara Peninsula produce wines, in particular, the ice wine for which the region is known.

, sectors such as information technology, health care, Agtech, tourism, research and finance provide the bulk of growth in the Golden Horseshoe. The cities of Brampton, Markham, Waterloo Region and Mississauga are emerging as hubs for technology and innovation. The region is one of the largest tech cluster in North America outside of Silicon Valley. The area is home to more than 15,000 tech companies, including over 5,000 startups, and nearly 300,000 employees in high-tech industries. About two-thirds of those employees are classified as “tech workers,” which includes programmers, developers, etc. with 8 percent of the total workforce employed in tech.

==Education==
The Golden Horseshoe is home to several universities, including the University of Toronto and McMaster University in Hamilton, which are ranked 1st and 4th in Canada, respectively, by the Academic Ranking of World Universities. Other universities in the region include Brock University in St. Catharines, Trent University in Peterborough, York University in northern Toronto near Vaughan, OCAD University in downtown Toronto, Ontario Tech University in Oshawa, Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University), the University of Guelph, the University of Waterloo, Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo, and the Université de l&#x27;Ontario français in downtown Toronto. The Golden Horseshoe is also home to many colleges.

Public primary and secondary schooling is typically provided by school boards, largely organized at the municipal or county/regional level. The only school board that operates throughout the Golden Horseshoe is Conseil scolaire Viamonde, a public French-language school board, and Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir, a public French-language separate school board. Both of these public French-language school boards operate across the Ontario Peninsula.

==Attractions==
The CN Tower in downtown Toronto is among the most internationally notable attractions in the Golden Horseshoe. Other major attractions in downtown Toronto include the Royal Ontario Museum, the Art Gallery of Ontario, and the Hockey Hall of Fame.

The region is home to several shopping malls such as Yorkdale Shopping Centre, Toronto Eaton Centre, Fairview Mall, Scarborough Town Centre, and Sherway Gardens. Located in the suburbs of Toronto are Vaughan Mills in Vaughan, Bramalea City Centre in Brampton, Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga, and Pacific Mall and Markville Shopping Centre in Markham.

Annual cultural festivals that draw tourists and locals alike include the Toronto Caribbean Carnival (formerly known as Caribana) and Taste of the Danforth in Toronto.

The Niagara Escarpment, a world biosphere reserve as designated by the United Nations, runs from the north at Bruce Peninsula and then east through the region cutting the Niagara Gorge at Niagara Falls. The Bruce Trail runs along the escarpment through mostly protected woodlands. The Cheltenham Badlands in Caledon is an environmentally degraded area along the Niagara Escarpment. Similar protection of some wooded areas exists on the Oak Ridges Moraine running east–west in the north end of the Greater Toronto Area, although development pressures continue to threaten the natural habitat.

The Niagara Region has become one of the major wine-production areas in Canada. The Golden Horseshoe contains many small towns with historic main streets, most notably the community of Niagara-on-the-Lake, located near the Niagara River. Niagara Falls has one of the world&#x27;s largest waterfalls and attracts millions to Clifton Hill, a neighbourhood with souvenir stores, small attractions, restaurants and skyline-defining hotels. There are also two casinos: Casino Niagara and Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort.

Hamilton has the historical reputation of being a blue-collar city; however, waterfront redevelopments and large-scale gentrification have been rapidly changing the perception of the city, although it retains a dominant industrial base. Hamilton has over 100 waterfalls and cascades throughout the region.

Seasonal amusement parks and large outdoor attractions in the Golden Horseshoe include Canada&#x27;s Wonderland, run by Six Flags, in Vaughan; Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild Toronto (formerly Wild Water Kingdom) in Brampton; African Lion Safari in Hamilton and Cambridge; and the defunct Marineland in Niagara Falls. Though technically a provincial fair, the Exhibition Place just west of downtown Toronto hosts the annual Canadian National Exhibition, while the nearby Ontario Place is being redeveloped.

===Sports===

The Golden Horseshoe is home to many amateur and professional sports clubs, and university and college varsity programs. Many professional sports clubs in the city form a part of a larger sports league. Most university varsity programs are regulated by U Sports, while college varsity programs are regulated by the Canadian Collegiate Athletic Association. 

In addition to the number of sports clubs and programs based in the region, the Golden Horseshoe has also hosted several international multi-sport events, including the 1930 British Empire Games (predecessor to the Commonwealth Games), the 1976 Summer Paralympics, the 2015 Pan American Games and Parapan American Games, the 2017 Invictus Games, the 2017 North American Indigenous Games, and the 2018 NACAC Championships. Although much of the 1976 Summer Olympics was held in Montreal, several matches for the event&#x27;s soccer tournament were played in Toronto. Toronto is among various cities in North America to host select matches for the 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Note that the Toronto Blue Jays temporarily played their home games in the United States (more specifically Dunedin, Florida and Buffalo, New York) due to the COVID-19 pandemic in North America in 2020 and 2021, while the Toronto Raptors played their home games in the United States (more specifically Tampa, Florida) during the pandemic to minimize cross-border travel.

In May 2024, the Women&#x27;s National Basketball Association (WNBA) announced that its 14h franchise had been awarded to Toronto-based Kilmer Sports Ventures. Known as the Toronto Tempo, the team is expected to play its home games at the Coca-Cola Coliseum in Exhibition Place starting in its debut in 2026.

==Transportation==
The Golden Horseshoe is served by a network of expressways; central among these are the Queen Elizabeth Way and Highway 401, the latter of which is one of the widest and busiest expressways in the world.
Public transit in the region is coordinated by Metrolinx. Regional transit is provided by GO Transit trains and buses, and by intercity bus operators such as Ontario Northland and Coach Canada. GO Transit&#x27;s train network encompasses seven commuter rail lines linking municipalities in the Golden Horseshoe to Toronto&#x27;s Union Station, which is the busiest railway station in Canada and the second-busiest railway station in North America, with 72 million passengers per year. Expansion is underway to facilitate all-day 15-minute or better commuter train service, electrification and increased ridership on five of the busiest lines. Local transit is provided by municipal agencies, the largest of which is the Toronto Transit Commission, which operates three subway lines and one former light metro line and an extensive bus and streetcar network. Rapid transit systems that operate primarily outside Toronto include the VIVA bus rapid transit in York Region, the ION light rail system in Kitchener-Waterloo, and the Mississauga transitway. Line 5 and Line 6 are under construction LRT lines in Toronto that are part of its subway system. The Ontario Line is another subway line under construction in Toronto. The Hurontario LRT is currently under construction in Peel Region, as well as various bus rapid transit projects in Peel and York Regions.

The primary airport of the region is Toronto Pearson International Airport (officially Lester B. Pearson International Airport), located in Mississauga. Handling 50.5 million passengers in 2019, it is the busiest in Canada and the 31st busiest in the world. Other regional airports of significance include John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport located in southern Hamilton, which is a major regional freight and courier location as well as the Region of Waterloo International Airport in Kitchener; Buttonville Airport (closed since November 2023) and Billy Bishop Airport in the Greater Toronto Area. Within driving distance is Buffalo Niagara International Airport in Cheektowaga, New York, in the United States. Buffalo Niagara carries the second-largest passenger volume in the region, serving over 5 million passengers in 2018. It is frequently used by Canadian passengers flying to US destinations.

<text>A manga artist, also known as a mangaka (), is a comic artist who writes and/or illustrates manga. As of 2013, about 4,000 professional manga artists were working in Japan, plus thousands of part timers and amateurs.

Most manga artists study at an art college or manga school or take on an apprenticeship with another artist before entering the industry as a primary creator. More rarely a manga artist breaks into the industry directly, without previously being an assistant. For example, Naoko Takeuchi, author of &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;, won a Kodansha Manga Award contest and manga pioneer Osamu Tezuka was first published while studying an unrelated degree, without working as an assistant.

A manga artist will rise to prominence through recognition of their ability when they spark the interest of institutions, individuals or a demographic of manga consumers. For example, there are contests which prospective manga artist may enter, sponsored by manga editors and publishers. This can also be accomplished through producing a one-shot. While sometimes a stand-alone manga, with enough positive reception it can be serialized in a weekly, monthly, or quarterly format. They are also recognized for the number of manga they run at any given moment.

==Etymology== 
The original Japanese word can be broken down into two parts: and .

The manga corresponds to the medium of art the artist uses: comics, or Japanese comics, depending on how the term is used inside or outside Japan.

The -&quot;ka&quot; (家) suffix implies a degree of expertise and traditional authorship. For example, this term would not be applied to a writer creating a story which is then handed over to a manga artist for drawing. The Japanese term for such a writer of comics is .

In 2009, 5,300 mangaka were honored with a title published in bound volume in Japan. In a 2010 message Japan Cartoonists Association chairman, Takashi Yanase says: &quot;[w]hile Japan is often said to be world&#x27;s cartoon kingdom, not a few people will surely be wondering what exactly the Japanese mean by the term &#x27;cartoon&#x27;. Unfortunately, there is no hard-and-fast definition that can be offered, since the members of this association lay claim to an extensive variety of works.&quot;

== Becoming a manga artist ==
Traditionally in order to become a manga artist, one would need to send their work into a competition held by various publishing companies. If they won their work would be published and they would be assigned an editor and officially &quot;debut&quot; as a manga artist. Nowadays there are many self-published manga artists on the internet posting their work on websites. It is possible for these manga artists&#x27; works to be officially picked up by a publishing company, such as Shueisha. For example, &quot;One-Punch Man&quot; started off as a webcomic before Shueisha began publishing a manga remake on &quot;Tonari No Young Jump.&quot;

==Relationship to other staff==
While Japan does have a thriving independent comic market for amateur and semi-professional artists, creating manga professionally is rarely a solo effort. Manga artists must work with an assortment of others to get their work completed, published, and into the hands of readers.

===Editor===
Most professionally published manga artists work with an editor, who is considered the boss of the manga artist and supervises series production. The editor gives advice on the layout and art of the manga, vets the story direction and pace, ensures that deadlines are met, and generally makes sure that the manga stays up to company standards. Naoki Urasawa compared the relationship between a manga artist and their editor to that of the one between a music producer and a recording artist, specifically citing George Martin&#x27;s relationship with The Beatles. The editor may also function as a brand manager and publicist for a series. When a manga is the basis for a media franchise, the editor may also supervise the designs for anime adaptations, and similar products, though this duty may also fall to the manga artist or an agent. An example of a manga artist and their editor is Akira Toriyama and Kazuhiko Torishima.

===Writer===
A manga artist may both write and illustrate a series of their own creation, or may work together with an author. The manga artist typically has a strong influence on dialog even when paired with a writer, as any conversation must fit within the physical constraints imposed by the art. Takeshi Obata of &quot;Death Note&quot;, Tetsuo Hara of &quot;Fist of the North Star&quot;, and Ryoichi Ikegami of &quot;Sanctuary&quot; are all successful manga artists who have worked with writers through the majority of their careers.

===Assistants===
Most manga artists have assistants who help them complete their work in a clean and timely manner. The duties of assistants vary widely, as the term incorporates all people working for a manga artist&#x27;s art studio, but is most commonly used to refer to secondary artists. The number of assistant artists also varies widely between manga artists, but is typically at least three. Other manga artists instead form work groups known as &quot;circles&quot; but do not use additional assistants, such as the creative team CLAMP. A few manga artists have no assistants at all, and prefer to do everything themselves, but this is considered exceptional.

Assistants are commonly used for inking, lettering, and shading, though the predominance of black and white art in manga means that unlike in the western comic industry, a studio rarely employs a colorist. Some manga artists only do the sketchwork for their art, and have their numerous assistants fill in all of the details, but it is more common for assistants to deal with background and cameo art, leaving the manga artist to focus on drawing and inking the characters. Assistants may also be employed to perform specialized artistic tasks. Go Nagai, for instance, at one time employed a specialist to draw helicopters and other military vehicles, Kaoru Mori employed a historical consultant for &quot;Emma&quot;, and series that incorporates photorealistic architecture, animals, computer-rendered imagery, or other technically demanding effects may employ or contract separate artists trained in those techniques. Assistants almost never help the manga artist with the plot of their manga, beyond being a sounding board for ideas. A manga artist&#x27;s assistants might be listed in the credits for a manga tankōbon, and short interviews with or illustrations by assistant artists are a common form of bonus material in these collections, but they typically do not receive individual credits.

Most manga artists started out as assistants, such as Miwa Ueda to Naoko Takeuchi, Leiji Matsumoto to Osamu Tezuka, Kaoru Shintani to Leiji Matsumoto, and Eiichiro Oda, Hiroyuki Takei and Mikio Itō to Nobuhiro Watsuki, who was himself an assistant to Takeshi Obata. It is also possible for an assistant to have an entire career as such without becoming an independent manga artist. Assistants, particularly specialists, may work with several different manga artists at the same time, and many assistants also self-publish works of their own in the dōjinshi scene.

<doc id="271622" wikidata="Q721762" url="?curid=271622" title="Conversations with God">
<text>Conversations with God (CWG) is a sequence of books written by Neale Donald Walsch. It was written as a dialogue in which Walsch asks questions and God answers. The first book of the &quot;Conversations with God&quot; series, &quot;Conversations with God, Book 1: An Uncommon Dialogue&quot;, was published in 1995 and became a publishing phenomenon, staying on &quot;The New York Times Best Sellers List&quot; for 137 weeks.

In an interview with Larry King, Walsch described the inception of the books as follows: at a low period in his life, Walsch wrote an angry letter to God asking questions about why his life wasn&#x27;t working. After writing down all of his questions, he heard a voice over his right shoulder say: &quot;Do you really want an answer to all these questions or are you just venting?&quot; When Walsch turned around, he saw no one there, yet Walsch felt answers to his questions filling his mind and decided to write them down. The ensuing automatic writing became the &quot;Conversations with God&quot; books. When asked in a recent interview how he opens up to God, Neale stated, &quot;I am reaching out to touch others with this information. When I reach out and touch others with this information, I reconnect immediately with the divine presence.&quot;

== Basis of the dialogue ==
The series contains nearly three thousand pages of material. The second and third books in the trilogy deal with political and social issues.

=== Themes ===
In &quot;Friendship with God&quot;, Walsch writes that God presents four concepts that are central to the entire dialogue:

# We are all one.
# There&#x27;s enough.
# There&#x27;s nothing we have to do.
# Ours is not a better way, ours is merely another way.

Existence is essentially non-dual in nature. At the highest level, there is no separation between anything, and there is only one of us; there is only God, and everything is God. The second statement, following from the first, means that we, in this seeming existence, lack nothing, and if we choose to realize it, we have enough of whatever we think we need (or the means to create it) within us. The third statement combines the first two to conclude that God, being all there is and is thus always sufficient unto itself, has no need for anything and therefore has no requirements of humanity. The final concept puts an end to our need always to be correct. Given that we have and are everything, and there&#x27;s nothing we &quot;have&quot; to do, there is an &quot;infinite&quot; number of ways to experience this, not just the &quot;one&quot; way we may have chosen so far.

According to the books, God recommends many economic and social changes if people want to make a more functional, adaptable, and sustainable world. The books recommend that more attention should focus on the environment. The conversations also speak of reincarnation and the existence of life on other planets.

=== God&#x27;s motive for creation ===
In Walsch&#x27;s first dialogue, God notes that &quot;knowing&quot; and &quot;experiencing&quot; oneself are different things. Before creation, there was only That-Which-Is, which cannot know or experience itself fully without something it is not. It cannot know itself as love since nothing exists but love. It cannot know itself as giving since nothing else exists to give to. It cannot experience itself in myriad ways because everything is one.

In Walsch&#x27;s viewpoint, this present creation is established by and within God so that sentience can exist, which does not directly remember its true nature as God. Split into infinite forms, all life can live, experience, and recreate its nature as God, rather than &quot;know&quot; itself as the creator in theory. It is essentially a game, entered into by agreement, to remember who and what we are and enjoy and create, knowing that ultimately there is no finish line that some will not reach, no understanding that is not without value, no act that does not add meaning to the future or for others. Walsch claims that God says that we have a common interest in keeping the game going. There is nothing else to do except to experience our existence and then experience more of it, to uncover deeper layers of truth and understanding. There are no external rules because all experience is subjective and chosen. But within this, there are ways that people will gradually come to see their thoughts, words, and actions are either working or not working. A thing is either functional or dysfunctional, not right or wrong. These rememberings take place over &quot;time&quot; and can take hundreds and thousands of lifetimes.

=== Nature of the dialogue ===

* Book 1 (PG.4) argues that words are not the ultimate truth; instead, words are symbols and are open to interpretations. Thus the readers are advised to consult their inner knowing or intuition to determine their truth while reading the book or any other book. Though the books bear the title &quot;Conversations with God&quot; and the author states in book one that he is &quot;taking dictation&quot; from God, the dialogue is said to be between God and all people at all times. The question, according to Neale, is not to who does God talk, but who listens. This is clarified by the statement that God can communicate with people in many ways (the next song you hear, the next sunset you experience, the next time you hear laughter, the next movie that moves you), and not necessarily through words &#x27;spoken&#x27; by God to a person. &quot;All these devices are mine. All these avenues are open to me. I will speak to you if you invite me.&quot; (Book 1, PG 58).
* Jesus is said to have sought to lead by example, which is why he said, &quot;I am the way and the life, follow me&quot;. Follow me meant that we should follow his example and become one with God rather than become his (Jesus) followers. Jesus and other living things are/were not one with God presently (everything is happening right now with no space/time difference). Jesus is supposed to have said, &quot;The Father (God) and I are one, and you are my brethren&quot;. This means that living things are all one (particles of the collective God) (Book 3, Chapter 20, PG. 329-330). 
* Jesus is said to have said, &quot;without the Father (God), I am nothing&quot;. The Father of all is pure thought, the energy of life (Book 3, Chapter 11, PG. 180). 
* In Book 3 of &quot;Conversations with God&quot; (1998), by Neale Donald Walsch, it is mentioned that Mahavatar Babaji may at one time have resurrected himself from the dead, just like Lazarus, Jesus and other humans. When Neale asks God if reincarnation is a false doctrine, God replies that it is not. Neale then asks why some religions do not know the truth about something so basic. In response, God says that we must understand that humans have many fear-based religions whose teachings surround the doctrine of a God who is to be worshipped and feared. It was through fear that the entire Earth society reformed itself from a matriarchy into patriarchy.
* Through fear, the holy priests got people to mend their wicked ways and heed the word of the Lord. It was through fear that the churches gained and controlled their membership. Churches even insisted that God will punish you if you did not go to church every Sunday. Not going to church was declared a sin - and not just any church, it had to be a particular one.
* One had to attend one particular church. If you went to a church of a different denomination, that too was a sin. That was an attempt at control using fear. It worked. People will always believe in hell and a God who would send them there as long as we believe that God is like man — ruthless, self-serving, unforgiving, and vengeful.
===History of purgatory===
Most people could not envision a God who may rise above all of that, so they accepted the teachings of many churches to fear the awful retribution of God in the past. It seemed as though people couldn&#x27;t rely on their own inherent motivations to be moral and behave properly. To stay in line, they had to invent a religion that taught of a vengeful, punishing God. The idea of reincarnation threw a monkey wrench into all of that. The church was proclaiming that you better be nice or else—and along came the reincarnationist saying you have another chance after this and another chance after that and still more chances, so don&#x27;t worry, try your hardest, do not become so paralysed with fear that you cannot budge, make a commitment to yourself to improve and proceed. The early church could not accept such a thing that did two things. It denounced the doctrine of reincarnation as heretical and created the sacrament of confession. A churchgoer could have a second chance through confession, which is what reincarnation offered but there was a catch: God could not provide this absolution immediately. It had to pass via the church, where penances were mandated by the priests. Usually, the sinner was obliged to offer these prayers. You now have two reasons to continue attending church. Confession was seen as such a good drawcard by the church that it was soon deemed a sin to avoid it. At least once a year, everyone was required to do it. If they did not, God would be even more enraged. A growing number of regulations, many of which were arbitrary and unreasonable, were issued by the church. Unless, of course, failure was admitted, in which case God&#x27;s forgiveness was granted and condemnation was avoided, every direction carries the weight of God&#x27;s eternal condemnation. Another issue resulted from that. As long as they admitted it, people deduced that this must imply that they could do anything. The church found itself in a dilemma. The people were no longer afraid. Church membership and attendance declined. Once a year, people came to confess, performed their penances, were absolved of their sins, and continued living their lives. The matter was beyond doubt. Purgatory was created in order to find a means of reviving fear in the heart. It was said that purgatory was a location that was similar to hell but not endless. According to this new theory, even if you acknowledged your faults, God would still punish you for them. According to the doctrine, depending on the quantity and kind of sins committed, God predetermined a specific amount of suffering for every imperfect soul. Both venial and deadly sins existed. If you don&#x27;t confess your mortal sins before you die, you&#x27;ll go straight to hell. Again, church attendance skyrocketed, as did collections and, most importantly, donations, because the purgatory dogma allowed one to purchase their way out of pain. One could get a special indulgence, not directly from God but only a church official as per the teaching of the church. These unique indulgences liberated an individual from the torment in purgatory, which they had accumulated through their sins or at least a portion of it. These exemptions were given to only a small number, such as those who made significant contributions to the church. For a considerable amount, one could acquire a full indulgence. This indicated zero time in purgatory whatsoever - it was a direct pass straight to heaven. This unique blessing from God was accessible to even fewer people, possibly including royalty and the extremely wealthy. The church received vast amounts of money, gems, and land in return for these plenary indulgences. The uniqueness of this caused immense anger and bitterness among the public. The most destitute peasant had no chance of obtaining a bishop&#x27;s indulgence, leading the common folk to lose trust in the system, with attendance at risk of falling once more. After that, they introduced the novena candles. Individuals could visit the church and ignite a novena candle for the souls in purgatory. Through the recitation of a novena (a sequence of prayers said in a designated manner that requires some time), they could significantly decrease the duration of the sentence of the beloved deceased, freeing them from purgatory earlier than God would have permitted otherwise. They were unable to take action themselves, but they could still pray for mercy for those who had passed away. Certainly, it would be beneficial if one or two coins were inserted through the slot for every candle they lit. Many small candles were glowing behind numerous red glass pieces, while many pesos and pennies were tossed into various tin boxes in hopes of prompting God to alleviate the suffering endured by souls in purgatory.

== Parallels in other belief systems ==
The dialogue presents many philosophical ideas that prominent Eastern and Western thinkers had already advanced earlier. Still, Walsch explains the information in language for modern readers and does not explicitly cite these philosophers. Walsch claims that he had never known most of these ideas before his revelatory experiences. Since the beginning of the series, and especially in the later volumes, Walsch and &quot;God&quot; acknowledge that most of the concepts presented are previously known to humanity but are profound enough to warrant being explored repeatedly and put into this cohesive, unified form. Since humanity is still mired in strife and conflict, there is value in their restatement. Fundamental parts of Walsch&#x27;s writings are also mirrored within other well-known spiritual writings and traditions:

* All things are one, there is no polarity, no right or wrong, no disharmony, but only identity. All is one, and that one is love/light, light/love, the Infinite Creator. (Advaita/Sikhism)
* Souls reincarnate to eventually experience God-realization (Hinduism/&quot;Bhagavad-Gita&quot;/Sikhism).
* Feelings are more important as a source of guidance than intellect (Rousseau/Sikhism).
* We are not here to learn anything new but to remember what we already know (Hinduism/Plato/Sikhism).
* Physical reality is an illusion (Hinduism/Buddhism&#x27;s concept of &quot;maya&quot;/Sikhism, as well as Christian Science).
* One cannot understand one thing unless he or she understands its opposite (&quot;Tao Te Ching&quot;).
* God is everything. (Hinduism/Spinoza/Brahman/Sikhism/Pandeism/Pantheism)
* God is self-experiential, in that it is the nature of the Universe to experience itself. (Hinduism/Hegel/Sikhism/Pandeism, and process theology as first outlined by Alfred North Whitehead)
* God is not fear-inducing or vengeful, only our parental projections onto God are. (Sikhism)
* Fear or love are the two basic alternative perspectives on life. (Drewermann)
* Good and evil do not exist (as absolutes, but can exist in a different context and for different reasons). (Nietzsche/Sikhism)
* Reality is a representation created by will. (Schopenhauer/Sikhism)
* Nobody knowingly desires evil. (Socrates/Stoicism/Sikhism) (see: Moral intellectualism)

In August 2016, however, Neale stumbled upon a &quot;new and unexpected dialogue&quot; continuing the original trilogy with a fourth installment released on March 27, 2017.

The first three books in the series are often called the CwG trilogy. In 2005, the trilogy was re-released as one combined &#x27;Gift Edition&#x27; book. This edition contains the entire text of the first three books with God&#x27;s words in blue ink and Neale&#x27;s in black ink, and features a combined 3-in-1 index at the back:

<doc id="271635" wikidata="Q2526532" url="?curid=271635" title="Vince Lombardi Trophy">
<text>The Vince Lombardi Trophy, also known simply as the Lombardi Trophy or just the Lombardi, is the trophy awarded each year to the winning team of the National Football League&#x27;s championship game, the Super Bowl. The trophy is named in honor of NFL coach Vince Lombardi, who led the Green Bay Packers to victories in the first two Super Bowl games.

During lunch with NFL commissioner Pete Rozelle in 1966, Tiffany &amp; Co. vice president Oscar Riedner made a sketch on a cocktail napkin of what would become the Vince Lombardi Trophy: a football in a kicking position on a three concave sided stand. The original trophy was produced by Tiffany &amp; Co. in Newark, New Jersey. Others have since been handcrafted by the company in Parsippany, New Jersey. As of 2017, the trophy is produced at the Tiffany &amp; Co. Forest Hill manufacturing facility in Cumberland, Rhode Island.

The first trophy, inscribed with the words &quot;World Professional Football Championship,&quot; was awarded to the Green Bay Packers on January 15, 1967, after they defeated the Kansas City Chiefs in Super Bowl I. Following the death of Vince Lombardi in September , the trophy was officially renamed in his memory. It was presented for the first time as the Vince Lombardi Trophy to the Baltimore Colts after their victory over the Dallas Cowboys in Super Bowl V.

Originally, the trophy was presented inside the winning team&#x27;s locker room. Since Super Bowl XXX in January 1996, it has been presented to the owner of the winning team on the field. Packers team president and CEO Bob Harlan and Mark Murphy accepted the trophy on behalf of the Green Bay community after Super Bowl XXXI and Super Bowl XLV, respectively.

Unlike trophies such as the Stanley Cup and the Grey Cup, a new Vince Lombardi Trophy is cast every year, and the winning team maintains permanent possession of it. The one exception is the trophy won by the then-Baltimore Colts in Super Bowl V. The city of Baltimore retained possession of the trophy, albeit a replica, as part of the legal settlement after the Colts made their infamous &quot;Midnight Mayflower&quot; relocation to Indianapolis, Indiana, on March 29, 1984. Both the relocated Colts and their successors, the Ravens, have since earned trophies in their own right.

Since Super Bowl XLV, the Vince Lombardi Trophy has been prominently featured in the Super Bowl logo design.

==Appearance==

The Vince Lombardi Trophy stands tall, weighs 107.3 ounces or approximately and depicts a football in a kicking position on a three concave sided stand, and is entirely made of sterling silver.

The words &quot;Vince Lombardi Trophy&quot; along with the Roman numerals of that year&#x27;s Super Bowl are engraved on and the NFL shield is affixed onto the base. After the trophy is awarded, it is sent back to Tiffany&#x27;s to be engraved with the names of the participating teams, the date, location, and the game&#x27;s final score. It is then sent back to the winning team for them to keep. Smaller replicas are made for each person on the winning team.

For the first four championship games, both the NFL and the AFL logos were in the center of the trophy. Starting from Super Bowl V, only the NFL shield was on the front. Beginning with Super Bowl XXXVIII, the shield took on a frosted appearance. Starting with Super Bowl XLIII, the slightly redesigned NFL shield began appearing on the trophy, still with a frosted appearance. Other than the logo, the trophy has had no significant changes made since the first Super Bowl. While no franchise possesses all four versions, the Green Bay Packers, New England Patriots, New York Giants, and Pittsburgh Steelers have three of the four designs.

===Rob Gronkowski denting incident===

On April 9, 2019, Rob Gronkowski (who had retired from the New England Patriots two weeks before) used the Super Bowl LIII Vince Lombardi trophy as a bat to bunt a practice pitch from wide receiver Julian Edelman during the Boston Red Sox season opener where he was to throw the ceremonial first pitch with his former teammates. It left a baseball-sized dent in the trophy, his third overall, and his former team&#x27;s sixth. The humorous documentary-style video released by the Patriots about the incident became popular, with special teamer Matthew Slater, who witnessed the incident first hand, saying that if anyone can get away with it, it would be the &quot;MVP (Edelman) and the future Hall of Famer (Gronkowski).&quot;

Patriots vice president of media relations Stacey James stated that, &quot;Maybe they’ll fix it down the road. That’s something they can always fix in the future, but at least for now, we’re going to keep the dent and tell the story.&quot;

==Teams with most Vince Lombardi Trophies==

The Super Bowl is currently played in early February (the game originally took place in early to mid-January), culminating a regular season that generally begins in September of the previous calendar year. For example, Super Bowl 50, which was played on February 7, 2016, determined the league champion for the 2015 NFL season. The years shown below refer to the season, not the date that the Super Bowl was actually played:
* Six: The Pittsburgh Steelers (1974, 1975, 1978, 1979, 2005, 2008) are tied with the New England Patriots (2001, 2003, 2004, 2014, 2016, 2018) with six wins.
* Five: The Dallas Cowboys (1971, 1977, 1992, 1993, 1995) and the San Francisco 49ers (1981, 1984, 1988, 1989, 1994) are tied for third with five each.
* Four: The Green Bay Packers (1966, 1967, 1996, 2010), the New York Giants (1986, 1990, 2007, 2011), and the Kansas City Chiefs (1969, 2019, 2022, 2023) are tied for fifth with four each.
* Three: The Las Vegas Raiders (as Oakland Raiders 1976, 1980, as Los Angeles Raiders 1983), the Washington Redskins (now Commanders) (1982, 1987, 1991), and the Denver Broncos (1997, 1998, 2015) are tied for eighth with three each.

Although none of these teams have ever won three straight Super Bowls, two teams have won three Lombardi trophies in four years and one team twice won the trophy two out of three consecutive years: The Dallas Cowboys (1992, 1993, 1995) and the New England Patriots (2001, 2003, 2004) and (2014, 2016) and (2016, 2018). The Pittsburgh Steelers won four Super Bowls in six years (1974, 1975, 1978, 1979).

As an individual player, Tom Brady, a former quarterback with the New England Patriots and Tampa Bay Buccaneers, won seven Super Bowls in his career, more than any single NFL franchise.

As an individual coach, Bill Belichick, a defensive coordinator with the New York Giants and Head coach with New England Patriots, has won eight Super Bowls in his career, more than any single NFL franchise or player.

==Presentation ceremony==

The trophy has been presented on a stage constructed on the field since Super Bowl XXX in 1996. A personality from the network broadcasting the game handles the presentation ceremony. Terry Bradshaw has hosted every presentation for Fox since Super Bowl XXXI, with the exception of Super Bowl XLVIII, when Michael Strahan substituted for him. Jim Nantz has handled the duties for CBS since Super Bowl XXXV. Dan Patrick hosted the ceremony for NBC from Super Bowl XLIII to Super Bowl LII.Mike Tirico hosted the ceremony for NBC for Super Bowl LVI.

The winning owner, winning coach, winning quarterback, and (if not a quarterback) the game MVP are usually recognized. &quot;The Lombardi Trophy Theme,&quot; composed by David Robidoux in 2005, plays during the trophy handoff.

From Super Bowl I to Super Bowl XXIX, the trophy was held by the commissioner to begin the ceremony and the commissioner then handed the trophy directly to the team owner in the winning locker room. The lone exception to this was in Super Bowl V where the trophy presentation ceremony wasn&#x27;t done by the commissioner but instead by Vince Lombardi&#x27;s widow, Marie.

From Super Bowl XXX to Super Bowl XXXIX, then from Super Bowl LIV to Super Bowl LVII, and again in Super Bowl LIX, the trophy was set on the stage to begin the ceremony and the commissioner handed the trophy directly to the team owner on the field.

From Super Bowl XL to Super Bowl LIII, and also in Super Bowl LVIII, a former NFL player, usually a past Super Bowl MVP or notable figure of the host city&#x27;s franchise, brought the Lombardi Trophy to the center of the stadium, as he walked past members of the winning team. Players who have partaken in Lombardi Trophy presentation ceremonies are listed below: 
* Super Bowl XL Presentation – Bart Starr (MVP, Super Bowl I and Super Bowl II)
* Super Bowl XLI Presentation – Don Shula (former Miami Dolphins head coach)
* Super Bowl XLII Presentation – Doug Williams (MVP, Super Bowl XXII)

<text>Clodagh Rodgers (born 5 March 1947) is a retired singer from Northern Ireland, best known for her hit singles including &quot;Come Back and Shake Me&quot;, &quot;Goodnight Midnight&quot;, and &quot;Jack in the Box&quot;.

==Career==
Rodgers was born in Warrenpoint and began her professional singing career at the age of thirteen, when she opened for Michael Holliday. Her father, a dancehall tour promoter, helped her sign with Decca in 1962, where her earliest singles were produced by Shel Talmy. Her UK TV debut came on 26 September 1962, appearing as a guest on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Adam Faith Show&quot; performing &quot;Let&#x27;s Jump the Broomstick&quot;. She made four singles with Decca, before moving to EMI&#x27;s Columbia label in 1965, where &#x27;Cloda Rogers&#x27; made the 1966 single &quot;Stormy Weather&quot;/&quot;Lonely Room&quot;. Although none of her Decca or Columbia singles made the UK Singles Chart, Rodgers became a regular face on British television and appeared in the musical films &quot;Just for Fun&quot; (1963) and &quot;It&#x27;s All Over Town&quot; (1964). She also appeared in various song festivals, finishing third in the European Song Cup competition in Greece with &quot;Powder Your Face With Sunshine&quot;. In November 1963, she flew to Nashville, Tennessee at the invitation of the American singer Jim Reeves, to perform at the Grand Ole Opry. On his Irish tour earlier that year, he had recognised that Rodgers was a promising artist with a bright future.

Rodgers appeared with Honeybus on BBC2&#x27;s music programme &quot;Colour Me Pop&quot; on 12 October, 1968. Her career changed dramatically when she married John Morris, who became her manager. She signed a three-single deal with RCA in 1968, but the first two failed to chart. When producer and songwriter Kenny Young saw her on &quot;Colour Me Pop&quot; he telephoned the BBC to find out who she was. Rodgers had chart success in 1969 under his creative wing and with Morris&#x27; management (Morris also later managed The Rubettes, Kenny and Fox), - &quot;Come Back and Shake Me&quot; was the first hit, reaching #3 (the song reached #2 in Ireland) and &quot;Goodnight Midnight&quot; followed later in the year reaching #4 - the two songs made her the best-selling female singles artist of 1969. 

The same year, she won &#x27;The Best Legs&#x27; in British showbusiness and insured her voice for one million pounds. Her next two single releases &quot;Biljo&quot; and &quot;Everybody Go Home, The Party&#x27;s Over&quot; were both hits, &quot;Biljo&quot; being Rodgers third Top 20 hit.

She also recorded &quot;Scrapbook&quot;, penned by Billy Ritchie, which appeared on her 1969 album &quot;Midnight Clodagh&quot;. In 1970, she recorded &quot;Give Me Just a Little More Line&quot; with Young under the name Moonshine; though it achieved airplay and critical notice, it failed to chart. Rodgers picked this track as one of her eight favourite discs when she appeared as the featured castaway on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot; in March 1971. 

In May 1970, Rodgers appeared on the bill at the &quot;NME&quot; poll-winner&#x27;s concert, hosted by presenters, Tony Blackburn and the now-disgraced, Jimmy Savile. She was voted favourite female singer for 1969.

===Eurovision===
By this time, Rodgers had become a big TV star and a household name. In 1970, she was asked to represent the UK in the 1971 Eurovision Song Contest in Dublin. According to John Kennedy O&#x27;Connor&#x27;s &quot;The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History&quot;, the BBC were concerned over the reaction the UK entrant would get on the stage from the Irish public. As a Catholic female from Northern Ireland, she received death threats from the IRA who regarded her as a traitor, as a result of her appearing for the UK.

Heralded by two separate front-cover features on the BBC listing&#x27;s magazine, the &quot;Radio Times&quot;, Rodgers appeared as the resident guest on &quot;It&#x27;s Cliff Richard&quot;, a prime-time variety show hosted by Cliff Richard on BBC1 from January 1971, performing one shortlisted song a week for six weeks, followed by a performance of all six on week seven and with a repeat of the six songs immediately after. Viewers would normally have been asked to send in postcard votes for their favourites, but because of a postal strike, regional juries decided the winner, with &quot;Jack in the Box&quot;, written by John Worsley and David Myers, being named the winner the following week.

For the first time in the Eurovision Song Contest, broadcasters were required to prepare a &#x27;preview&#x27; video of the song for broadcast in all the participating Eurovision countries to help promote the songs before the big night. For the performance in Dublin, Rodgers wore a pink frilly top and spangled hot pants. She finished in fourth place, behind Monaco, Spain and Germany.

After Eurovision, the single reached #4 on the UK Singles Chart, her third UK Top 10 success. It remains her most famous hit to date. The record was also successful all over Europe.

At Eurovision, Rodgers&#x27; sister Lavinia joined The Breakaways as her four backing vocalists. Lavinia was almost part of a backing group called Three’s a Crowd. In 1982, Lavinia and brother Louis attempted to represent the UK in the contest with &quot;Every Day of My Life&quot; as part of the group Good Looks, but finished second to Bardo in the &quot;A Song For Europe&quot; contest.

===Post-Eurovision career===
Rodgers admitted to Ken Bruce during his eponymous BBC Radio 2 show in an interview broadcast on Friday, 25 May 2012, that the intention had been to release &quot;Another Time, Another Place&quot;, which had placed fourth of the six entries in the &quot;Song for Europe&quot; contest as the follow-up single to &quot;Jack in the Box&quot; and she began promoting it whilst in Dublin for the Eurovision final. However, Engelbert Humperdinck released a cover version before her track was available, denying her the opportunity to release it, but gaining himself a #13 hit single. Despite only one more Top 30 chart single, &quot;Lady Love Bug&quot; in autumn 1971, Rodgers continued to be a major TV star in the UK, guesting on many shows (including playing herself in the BBC sitcom &quot;Whack-O!&quot;), and appearing successfully in the biggest cabaret clubs throughout the country.

In addition, she became the face of Bisto gravy, in a series of television advertisements. 

On Irish television, &quot;The Clodagh Rodgers Show&quot; won an award at the Golden Rose TV festival in Montreux. She starred in many other shows, including &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; in 1974, singing three songs, including her latest single &quot;Get It Together&quot;. Rodgers also appeared in &quot;Seaside Special&quot; for BBC Television in 1975 and &quot;The Morecambe and Wise Show&quot; in 1970. She was a regular guest of &quot;The Two Ronnies&quot;. In August 1973, Rodgers hosted the first edition of BBC2&#x27;s &quot;Show Of The Week: The Young Generation Big Top&quot;, the forerunner of the later BBC1 series &quot;Seaside Special&quot;.

Rodgers also made a mark with her impressions of fellow artists such as Cilla Black, often working with Mike Yarwood, Des O&#x27;Connor, Tommy Cooper, Bob Monkhouse, and Dickie Henderson in variety. She was a regular performer in UK resorts&#x27; summer seasons, sharing the bill with Mike and Bernie Winters in Blackpool, Matt Monroe in Great Yarmouth among others. 

This success was mirrored on stage, where she starred in London&#x27;s West End in her own show at the Talk of the Town (breaking Sammy Davis Jr.&#x27;s box office record), and in &quot;Cinderella&quot; at the London Palladium in 1971, which was also a success and ran for months. The Cinderella show (co starring Ronnie Corbett) then ran at the Manchester Palace in 1972 and at the Bristol Hippodrome in 1973.

As part of BBC1&#x27;s celebration of the UK and Republic of Ireland both joining the European Economic Community on 1 January 1973, Rodgers appeared on &quot;Top Of The Year&quot; on 31 December 1972, alongside Bruce Forsyth and with Jimmy Tarbuck in &quot;The Tarbuck Follies&quot; on 1 January 1973 to see in the new year. 

Having left RCA in early 1974 (after two well received albums &quot;It&#x27;s Different Now&quot; and &quot;You are my Music&quot;, Rodgers then released a single for the Pye label, &quot;Saturday Sunday&quot; later that year. Numerous TV work supported all these three releases, including &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;. 

She signed to Polydor Records in 1976. Her 1977 single &quot;Save Me&quot; was in Capital Radio&#x27;s Top 30, reaching #21. The track was covered in the US by Louise Mandrell, who took it to #6 on the US country chart in 1983. &quot;Save Me&quot; was also covered by the South African all-female band Clout (an SA no. 7 hit in 1979). Other artists who recorded this song included Merrilee Rush and Helen Reddy. 

In 1978, Rodgers hosted UK ITV&#x27;s St. Patrick&#x27;s Day variety show for the first time, appearing on the cover of the &quot;TVTimes&quot; to promote the show and at the same time was confirmed as the host for the 1979 show. Later in 1978, Rodgers teamed with Terry Wogan on the ITV game show &quot;3-2-1&quot; in the programme&#x27;s first Christmas Special Celebrity edition. Other TV shows around this time featured Rodgers with The Two Ronnies and The Ronnie Corbett show.

She split from her manager/husband not long after their son&#x27;s birth and opted for motherhood over a musical career; although she released two singles on the Precision label in 1980. One of these tracks was &quot;My Simple Heart&quot;, which was placed on a B-side. Shortly after its release, The Three Degrees released their version of it, which reached the UK Top 10. Similarly, Rodgers had released &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; as the B-side of her 1971 single &quot;Lady Love Bug.&quot; &quot;Stand by Your Man&quot; (co-written by Tammy Wynette and Billy Sherrill) had previously been a hit for Tammy Wynette in the U.S.

==Later years==
Her second husband, guitarist Ian Sorbie, died in 1995, not long after their Paignton-based restaurant business collapsed, leaving them bankrupt.

She appeared in two hit musicals in the West End. These are &quot;Pump Boys and Dinettes&quot; at the Piccadilly and Albery Theatres co starring with Joe Brown, and in the lead role of Mrs Johnstone in the long-running hit &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; at the Phoenix Theatre. She appeared in the UK tour of &quot;Blood Brothers&quot; between 1995 and 1998. This included shows in York, Liverpool, Bromley and Bristol. Rodgers co starred with David Cassidy in the Bristol production.

In 1996, the first of two CD retrospectives was issued, bringing Rodgers back into the limelight. In 1998, she made a TV appearance with other former Eurovision artists such as Johnny Logan and Lynsey de Paul, (one of her co stars in the West End musical &quot;Pump Boys and Dinettes&quot;) performing on comedian John Shuttleworth&#x27;s Eurovision parody &quot;Europigeon&quot; on BBC Two, just before the 1998 contest in Birmingham.

In 1999, Mint Royale issued the track &quot;Shake Me,&quot; which sampled Rodgers&#x27; original recording of &quot;Come Back And Shake Me&quot;; it was featured in the UK TV production &quot;Queer As Folk&quot;.

In 2001, Rodgers played a recurring character in the ITV police drama series &quot;The Bill&quot;. 

Rodgers most recent CD release was &quot;The Kenny Young Years&quot; released in 2012. It featured all Rodgers recorded highs with Young.

==Other==
In the TV series &quot;Monty Python&#x27;s Flying Circus&quot;, Episode 34: &quot;The Cycling Tour&quot;, Mr. Gulliver (Terry Jones) receives a head trauma from a car accident and is convinced that he is Clodagh Rodgers. At the end of the episode, two large Terry Gilliam-animated monsters, who had been eyeing the cyclist lead character Mr. Pither (Michael Palin) from behind a bush, wait until Pither is gone, jump out, and dance up and down to Rodgers&#x27; rendition of &quot;Jack in the Box&quot;.

<doc id="271656" wikidata="Q1317969" url="?curid=271656" title="Thomas Hart Benton (politician)">
<text>Thomas Hart Benton (March 14, 1782April 10, 1858), nicknamed &quot;Old Bullion&quot;, was an American politician, attorney, soldier, and longtime United States senator from Missouri. A member of the Democratic Party, he was an architect and champion of westward expansion by the United States, a cause that became known as manifest destiny. Benton served in the Senate from 1821 to 1851, becoming the first member of that body to serve five terms. He was born in North Carolina.

After being expelled from the University of North Carolina in 1799 for theft, he established a law practice and plantation near Nashville, Tennessee. He served as an aide to General Andrew Jackson during the War of 1812 and settled in St. Louis, Missouri, after the war. Missouri became a state in 1821, and Benton won election as one of its inaugural pair of United States Senators. The Democratic-Republican Party fractured after 1824, and Benton became a Democratic leader in the Senate, serving as an important ally of President Jackson and President Martin Van Buren. He supported Jackson during the Bank War and proposed a land payment law that inspired Jackson&#x27;s Specie Circular executive order.

Benton&#x27;s prime concern was the westward expansion of the United States. He called for the annexation of the Republic of Texas, which was accomplished in 1845. He pushed for compromise in the partition of Oregon Country with the British and supported the 1846 Oregon Treaty, which divided the territory along the 49th parallel. He also authored the first Homestead Act, which granted land to settlers willing to farm it.

Though he owned slaves, Benton came to oppose the institution of slavery after the Mexican–American War, and he opposed the Compromise of 1850 as too favorable to pro-slavery interests. This stance damaged Benton&#x27;s popularity in Missouri, and the state legislature denied him re-election in 1851. Benton won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1852 but was defeated for re-election in 1854 after he opposed the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Benton&#x27;s son-in-law, John C. Frémont, won the 1856 Republican Party nomination for president, but Benton voted for James Buchanan and remained a loyal Democrat until his death in 1858.

==Early life==
Thomas Hart Benton was born in Harts Mill, North Carolina, a settlement located near the present-day town of Hillsborough. His father Jesse Benton, a wealthy lawyer and landowner, died in 1790. His grandfather Abner Benton (c. 1720–1770) was born in Worcester, England, and settled in the Province of North Carolina. Thomas H. Benton also studied law at the University of North Carolina where he was a member of the Philanthropic Society, but in 1799 he was dismissed from school after admitting to stealing money from fellow students. As Benton was leaving campus on the day he was expelled, he turned to the students who were jeering him and said, &quot;I am leaving here now but damn you, you will hear from me again.&quot; He then left school to manage the Benton family estate, but historians posit that Benton used the events as motivation to prove himself worthy in adulthood.

Attracted by the opportunities in the West, the young Benton moved the family to a 40,000 acre (160 km2) holding near Nashville, Tennessee. Here he established a plantation with accompanying schools, churches, and mills. His experience as a pioneer instilled a devotion to Jeffersonian democracy which continued through his political career.

In 1804, Benton worked as a clerk or &quot;factor&quot; at Gordon&#x27;s Ferry on the Duck River stop on the Natchez Trace. It was said that Benton &quot;speculated his way to a small fortune even before he reached his 21st birthday&quot; but in what, exactly, he speculated goes unmentioned. He continued his legal education and was admitted to the Tennessee bar in 1805, and in 1809 served a term as state senator. He attracted the attention of Tennessee&#x27;s &quot;first citizen&quot; Andrew Jackson, under whose tutelage he remained during the Tennessee years. He reportedly lived at the Hermitage in 1810 &quot;as the aid of Gen. Jackson.&quot;

At the outbreak of the War of 1812, Jackson made Benton his &quot;aide-de-camp&quot;, with a commission as a lieutenant colonel. Benton was assigned to represent Jackson&#x27;s interests to military officials in Washington D.C.; he chafed under the position, which denied him combat experience. In August 1814, troops under Benton constructed Fort Montgomery in the Mississippi Territory. In June 1813, Jackson dueled a member of Benton&#x27;s staff and his brother Jesse Benton Jr. In September, Jackson and Benton got into a fight at a hotel in Nashville, and Jackson was shot in the arm by Jesse. The bullet, which was removed during Jackson&#x27;s presidency, broke a bone in his left arm.

After the war, in 1815, Benton moved his estate to the newly opened Missouri Territory. As a Tennessean, he was under Jackson&#x27;s shadow; in Missouri, he could be a big fish in the as-yet small pond. He settled in St. Louis, where he practiced law and edited the &quot;Missouri Enquirer&quot;, the second major newspaper west of the Mississippi River.

In 1817, during a court case he and opposing attorney Charles Lucas accused each other of lying. When Lucas ran into him at the voting polls he accused Benton of being delinquent in paying his taxes and thus should not be allowed to vote. Benton accused Lucas of being a &quot;puppy&quot; and Lucas challenged Benton to a duel. They had a duel on Bloody Island with Lucas being shot through the throat and Benton grazed in the knee. Upon bleeding profusely, Lucas said he was satisfied and Benton released him from completing the duel. However, rumors circulated that Benton, a better shot, had made the rules of 30 feet apart to favor him. Benton challenged Lucas to a rematch on Bloody Island with shots fired from nine feet. Lucas was shot close to the heart and before dying initially told Benton, &quot;I do not or cannot forgive you.&quot; As death approached Lucas then stated, &quot;I can forgive you—I do forgive you.&quot;

There is reason to believe Benton trafficked in enslaved pre-teen and young teen girls. According to James D. Davis&#x27; 1873 history of Memphis, Benton returned from the War of 1812 &quot;with a beautiful French quadroon girl, with whom he lived some two or three years.&quot; This was Marie Louise Amarante Loiselle (1800?–1839), who later married Memphis mayor Marcus B. Winchester. Benton also purchased a 12-year-old enslaved girl named Phoebe Moore and resold her when she was 16 to Henry Clay, who kept her as a concubine and fathered her two children.

==United States Senate career==
===Early Senate career===
The Missouri Compromise of 1820 made the territory into a state, and Benton was elected as one of its first senators. The presidential election of 1824 was a four-way struggle between Jackson, John Quincy Adams, William H. Crawford, and Henry Clay. Benton supported Clay. Jackson received a plurality but not a majority of electoral votes, meaning that the election was thrown to the House of Representatives, which would choose among the top three candidates. Clay was the fourth vote-getter, though he won the election in Missouri. He was also Speaker of the House, and tried to maneuver the election in favor of Adams. Benton refused Clay&#x27;s requests that he support Adams, declaring that Jackson was the clear choice of the people. (Benton had no official role in this dispute, as he was not a Representative.) When Missouri&#x27;s lone Representative John Scott told Benton he intended to vote for Adams, Benton urged him not to. &quot;The vote which you intend thus to give is not your own—it belongs to the people of Missouri. They are against Mr. Adams. I, in their name, do solemnly protest against your intention, and deny your moral power thus to bestow your vote.&quot; Benton first supported Crawford, but after determining that he could not win, supported Jackson. Scott voted for Adams. Adams was elected and appointed Clay as Secretary of State. This was viewed by many as a &quot;corrupt bargain&quot;.

===Haiti===
More than two decades after enslaved Africans in Haiti defeated their French colonial rulers in the Haitian Revolution, Benton explained the refusal of the United States to recognize the independent republic in a speech to the United States Senate. He said that &quot;the peace of eleven states in this Union will not permit the fruits of a successful negro insurrection to be exhibited among them&quot; and said whites in the south would &quot;not permit black Consuls and Ambassadors to establish themselves in our cities, and to parade through our country, and give their fellow blacks in the United States, proof in hand of the honors which await them, for a like successful effort on their part.&quot;

===Jacksonian democracy===
After this, Benton and Jackson put their personal differences behind them and joined forces. Benton became the senatorial leader for the Democratic Party and argued vigorously against the Bank of the United States. Jackson was censured by the Senate in 1834 for canceling the Bank&#x27;s charter. At the close of the Jackson presidency, Benton led a successful &quot;expungement campaign&quot; in 1837 to remove the censure motion from the official record.

Benton was an unflagging advocate for &quot;hard money&quot;, that is gold coin (specie) or bullion as money—as opposed to paper money &quot;backed&quot; by gold as in a &quot;gold standard&quot;. &quot;Soft&quot; (i.e. paper or credit) currency, in his opinion, favored rich urban Easterners at the expense of the small farmers and tradespeople of the West. He proposed a law requiring payment for federal land in hard currency only, which was defeated in Congress but later enshrined in an executive order, the Specie Circular, by Jackson (1836). His position on currency earned him the nickname &quot;Old Bullion&quot;.

Senator Benton&#x27;s greatest concern, however, was the territorial expansion of the United States to meet its &quot;manifest destiny&quot; as a continental power. He originally considered the natural border of the U.S. to be the Rocky Mountains but expanded his view to encompass the Pacific coast. He considered unsettled land to be insecure and tirelessly worked for settlement. His efforts against soft money were mostly to discourage land speculation, and thus encourage settlement.

Benton was instrumental in the sole administration of the Oregon Territory. Since the Anglo-American Convention of 1818, Oregon had been jointly occupied by both the United States and the United Kingdom. Benton pushed for a settlement on Oregon and the Canada–US border favorable to the United States. The current border at the 49th parallel set by the Oregon Treaty in 1846 was his choice; he was opposed to the extremism of the &quot;Fifty-four forty or fight&quot; movement during the Oregon boundary dispute.

Benton was the author of the first Homestead Acts, which encouraged settlement by giving land grants to anyone willing to work the soil. He pushed for greater exploration of the West, including support for his son-in-law John C. Frémont&#x27;s numerous treks. He pushed hard for public support of the intercontinental railway and advocated greater use of the telegraph for long-distance communication. He was also a staunch advocate of the disenfranchisement and displacement of Native Americans in favor of European settlers.

He was an orator and leader of the first class, able to stand his own with or against fellow senators Daniel Webster, Henry Clay, and John C. Calhoun. Although an expansionist, his personal morals made him opposed to greedy or underhanded behavior—thus his opposition to Fifty-Four Forty. Benton advocated the annexation of Texas and argued for the abrogation of the 1819 Adams-Onís Treaty in which the United States relinquished claims to that territory, but he was opposed to the machinations that led to its annexation in 1845 and the Mexican–American War. He believed that expansion was for the good of the country, and not for the benefit of powerful individuals.

On February 28, 1844, Benton was present at the USS &quot;Princeton&quot; explosion when a cannon misfired on the deck while giving a tour of the Potomac River. The incident killed at least seven people, including United States Secretary of State Abel P. Upshur and United States Secretary of the Navy Thomas W. Gilmer, and wounded over twenty. Benton was one of the injured, but his injury was not serious and he did not miss one day from the Senate.

===Later Senate career and tension===
His loyalty to the Democratic Party was legendary. Benton was the legislative right-hand man for Andrew Jackson and continued this role for Martin Van Buren. With the election of James K. Polk, however, his power began to ebb, and his views diverged from the party&#x27;s. His career took a distinct downturn with the issue of slavery. Benton, a southerner and slave owner, became increasingly uncomfortable with the topic. He was also at odds with fellow Democrats, such as John C. Calhoun, who he thought put their opinions ahead of the Union to a treasonous degree. With troubled conscience, in 1849 he declared himself &quot;against the institution of slavery,&quot; putting him against his party and popular opinion in his state. In April 1850, during heated Senate floor debates over the proposed Compromise of 1850, Benton was nearly shot by pistol-wielding Mississippi Senator Henry S. Foote, who had taken umbrage to Benton&#x27;s vitriolic sparring with Vice-President Millard Fillmore. Foote was wrestled to the floor, where he was disarmed.

The memoirs of a long-time Washington resident described the man and the decline in his electoral appeal over time: &quot;Colonel Thomas Hart Benton, who had earned his military title during the war with Great Britain, was a large, heavily-framed man, with black curly hair and whiskers, prominent features and a stentorian voice. He wore the high, black silk neck-stock and the double-breasted frock coat of his youthful times during his thirty years&#x27; career in the Senate, varying with the seasons the materials of which his pantaloons were made, but never the fashion in which they were cut. When in debate, outraging every customary propriety of language, he would rush forward with blind fury upon every obstacle like the huge wild buffaloes then ranging the prairies of his adopted State, whose paths, be used to subsequently assert, would show the way through the passes of the Rocky Mountains. He was not a popular speaker, and when he took the floor occupants of the galleries invariably began to leave, while many Senators devoted themselves to their correspondence. In private life Colonel Benton was gentleness and domestic affection personified, and a desire to have his children profit by the superior advantages for their education in the District of Columbia kept him from his constituents in Missouri, where a new generation of voters grew up who did not know him and who would not follow his political lead.&quot;

==Later life==
In 1851, Benton was denied a sixth term by the Missouri legislature; the polarization of the slavery issue made it impossible for a moderate and Unionist to hold that state&#x27;s senatorial seat. In 1852 he successfully ran for the United States House of Representatives, but his opposition to the Kansas–Nebraska Act led to his defeat in 1854. He ran for Governor of Missouri in 1856, but lost to Trusten Polk. That same year, his son-in-law, John C. Frémont, husband of his daughter Jessie, ran for President on the Republican Party ticket; but Benton was a party loyalist to the end and voted for Democratic nominee James Buchanan, who won the election.

He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1855.

He published his autobiography, &quot;Thirty Years&#x27; View&quot;, in 1854, and &quot;Historical and legal examination of ... the decision of the Supreme Court ... in the Dred Scott case&quot; (arguing that the Court should have declined to decide the case, as political), in 1857.

He died in Washington, D.C., on April 10, 1858. His descendants have continued to be prominent in Missouri life; his great-grandnephew, also Thomas Hart Benton, was a 20th-century painter. 

Benton is buried at Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis. The Benton Park neighborhood of St. Louis is named after him.

==Family connections==

Benton was related by marriage or blood to a number of 19th-century luminaries. Two of his nephews—Confederate Colonel and posthumous Brigadier General Samuel Benton of Mississippi, and Union Colonel and Brevet Brigadier General Thomas H. Benton Jr. of Iowa—fought on opposite sides during the Civil War. He was brother-in-law of James McDowell, Virginia Senator and Governor; father-in-law of John C. Frémont, explorer, Senator, presidential candidate, and Union Major General; and cousin-in-law of Senators Henry Clay and James Brown, and Catherine Charlotte Bonaparte, illegitimate daughter of Emperor Napoleon&#x27;s brother Joseph Bonaparte. He was the great-uncle of US Representative Maecenas Eason Benton, the father of painter Thomas Hart Benton.

==Legacy==
Seven states (Arkansas, Indiana, Iowa, Minnesota, Missouri, Oregon, and Washington) have counties named after Benton. Two counties (Calhoun County, Alabama, and Hernando County, Florida) were formerly named Benton County in his honor. During Reconstruction, Benton County, Mississippi, was misrepresented by residents as being named after Benton.

Bentonville, Indiana, was named for the senator, as were the towns of Benton &amp; Bentonville, Arkansas, Benton Harbor, Michigan, Benton, Maine, Benton, Kentucky, Benton, Tennessee, Benton, Mississippi, and Benton, Illinois. Additionally, the fur trading post and now community of Fort Benton, Montana, for which bentonite is named, was named after Benton.

In July 2018, the president of Oregon State University, Ed Ray, announced that three campus buildings would be renamed due to their namesakes&#x27; racism. One of these buildings, formerly known as the Benton Annex after Benton, became the Hattie Redmond Women and Gender Center. The choice to rename it after Redmond was made to recognize her efforts as an Oregonian suffragist.

Uniquely, Benton has been the subject of biographical study by two men who later became presidents of the United States. In 1887, Theodore Roosevelt published a biography of Benton. Benton is also one of the eight senators profiled in John F. Kennedy&#x27;s 1956 book, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;.
Benton appears at a Fourth of July parade in the 1876 novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer by Mark Twain. At the beginning of chapter XXII it states: &quot;Even the Glorious Fourth was in some sense a failure, for it rained hard, there was no procession in consequence, and the greatest man in the world (as Tom supposed), Mr. Benton, an actual United States Senator, proved an overwhelming disappointment—for he was not twenty-five feet high, nor even anywhere in the neighborhood of it.&quot;

<doc id="271672" wikidata="Q517202" url="?curid=271672" title="De Quervain syndrome">
<text>De Quervain syndrome occurs when two tendons that control movement of the thumb become constricted by their tendon sheath in the wrist. This results in pain and tenderness on the thumb side of the wrist. Radial abduction of the thumb is painful. On some occasions, there is uneven movement or triggering of the thumb with radial abduction. Symptoms can come on gradually or be noted suddenly.

The diagnosis is generally based on symptoms and physical examination. Diagnosis is supported if pain increases when the wrist is bent inwards while a person is grabbing their thumb within a fist.
Treatment for de Quervain tenosynovitis focuses on reducing inflammation, restoring movement in the thumb, and maintaining the range of motion of the wrist, thumb, and fingers. Symptomatic alleviation (palliative treatment) is provided mainly by splinting the thumb and wrist. Pain medications such as NSAIDs can also be considered. Steroid injections are commonly used, but are not proved to alter the natural history of the condition. Surgery to release the first dorsal component is an option. It may be most common in middle age.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms are pain and tenderness at the radial side of the wrist, fullness or thickening over the thumb side of the wrist, painful radial abduction of the thumb, and difficulty gripping with the affected side of the hand. Pain is made worse by movement of the thumb and wrist, and may radiate to the thumb or the forearm. The onset is often gradual, but sometimes the symptoms seem to come on suddenly and the problem is often misinterpreted as an injury.

==Causes==
The cause of de Quervain syndrome is not established. Critics of this association note of the human mind&#x27;s tendency to misinterpret activities that are painful as activities that make the problem worse. It&#x27;s important not to inappropriately reinforce such misconceptions because they are associated with greater discomfort and incapability. Evidence regarding a possible relation with activity and occupation is debated. A systematic review of potential risk factors did not find any evidence of a causal relationship with activity or occupation. One study found that personal and work-related factors were associated with the diagnosis of de Quervain syndrome in a working population; wrist bending and movements associated with the twisting or driving of screws were the most significant of the work-related factors. Proponents of the view that de Quervain syndrome is a repetitive strain injury consider postures where the thumb is held in abduction and extension to be predisposing factors. Workers who perform rapid repetitive activities involving pinching, grasping, pulling or pushing have been considered at increased risk. These movements are associated with many types of repetitive housework such as chopping vegetables, stirring and scrubbing pots, vacuuming, cleaning surfaces, drying dishes, pegging out washing, mending clothes, gardening, harvesting, and weeding. Specific activities that have been postulated as potential risk factors include intensive computer mouse use, trackball use, and typing, as well as some pastimes, including bowling, golf, fly-fishing, piano-playing, sewing, and knitting.

The incidence of diagnosis of the condition is higher in women than in men. The syndrome commonly occurs during and, even more so, after pregnancy. Contributory factors may include hormonal changes, fluid retention and—again, more debatably—increased housework and lifting.

==Pathophysiology==

De Quervain syndrome involves noninflammatory thickening of the tendons and the synovial sheaths that the tendons run through. The two tendons concerned are those of the extensor pollicis brevis and abductor pollicis longus muscles. These two muscles run side by side and function to bring the thumb away from the hand (radial abduction). De Quervain tendinopathy affects the tendons of these muscles as they pass from the forearm into the hand via a fibro-osseous tunnel (the first dorsal compartment).
Evaluation of histopathological specimens shows a thickening and myxoid degeneration consistent with a chronic degenerative process, as opposed to inflammation or injury. The pathology is identical in de Quervain syndrome cases seen in new mothers.

==Diagnosis==
De Quervain syndrome is diagnosed clinically based on patient history and physical examination, though diagnostic imaging may be used to rule out fracture, arthritis, or other causes. The modified Eichoff maneuver, commonly referred to as the Finkelstein test, is a physical exam maneuver used to diagnose de Quervain syndrome. To perform the test, the examiner grasps and ulnar deviates the hand when the person has their thumb held within their fist. If sharp pain occurs along the distal radius (top of the forearm, about an inch below the wrist), de Quervain syndrome is likely. While a positive Finkelstein test is often considered pathognomonic for de Quervain syndrome, the maneuver can also cause some pain in those with osteoarthritis at the base of the thumb.

===Differential diagnosis===
Differential diagnoses include:

# Osteoarthritis of the trapezio-metacarpal joint
# Intersection syndrome: Pain will be more towards the middle of the back of the forearm and about 2–3 inches below the wrist, usually with associated crepitus.
# Wartenberg&#x27;s syndrome: The primary symptom is paresthesia (numbness/tingling).

==Treatment==
Most tendinoses and enthesopathies are self-limiting and the same is likely to be true of de Quervain syndrome, although further study is needed.

The mainstay of symptom alleviation (palliative treatment) is a splint that immobilizes the wrist and the thumb to the interphalangeal joint. Activities are more comfortable with such a splint in place. Anti-inflammatory medication or acetaminophen may also alleviate symptoms.

As with many musculoskeletal conditions, the management of de Quervain disease is determined more by convention than scientific data. A systematic review and meta-analysis published in 2013 found that corticosteroid injection seems to be an effective form of conservative management of de Quervain syndrome in approximately 50% of patients, although they have not been well tested against placebo injection. Consequently, it remains uncertain whether injections are palliative and whether they can alter the natural history of the illness. One of the most common causes of corticosteroid injection failure is the presence of subcompartments of the extensor pollicis brevis tendon.

Surgery (in which the sheath of the first dorsal compartment is opened longitudinally) is documented to provide relief in most patients. The most important risk is to the radial sensory nerve. A small incision is made and the dorsal extensor retinaculum is identified. Once it has been identified, the release is performed longitudinally along the tendon. This is done to prevent potential subluxation of the first compartment tendons. Next, the abductor pollicis longus (APL) and extensor pollicis brevis (EPB) are identified, and the compartments are released.

==History==
From the original description of the illness in 1895 until the first description of corticosteroid injection by Jarrod Ismond in 1955, it appears that the only treatment offered was surgery. Since approximately 1972, the prevailing opinion has been that of McKenzie (1972) who suggested that corticosteroid injection should be the first line of treatment and that surgery should be reserved for unsuccessful injections.

===Eponym===
It is named after the Swiss surgeon Fritz de Quervain, who first identified it in 1895.

<doc id="271708" wikidata="Q13405516" url="?curid=271708" title="Near and far field">
<text>The near field and far field are regions of the electromagnetic (EM) field around an object, such as a transmitting antenna, or the result of radiation scattering off an object. Non-radiative &quot;near-field&quot; behaviors dominate close to the antenna or scatterer, while electromagnetic radiation &quot;far-field&quot; behaviors predominate at greater distances.

Far-field (electric) and (magnetic) radiation field strengths decrease as the distance from the source increases, resulting in an inverse-square law for the &quot;power&quot; intensity of electromagnetic radiation in the transmitted signal. By contrast, the near-field″s and strengths decrease more rapidly with distance: The radiative field decreases by the inverse-distance squared, the reactive field by an inverse-&quot;cube&quot; law, resulting in a diminished power in the parts of the electric field by an inverse fourth-power and sixth-power, respectively. The rapid drop in power contained in the near-field ensures that effects due to the near-field essentially vanish a few wavelengths away from the radiating part of the antenna, and conversely ensure that at distances a small fraction of a wavelength from the antenna, the near-field effects overwhelm the radiating far-field.

==Summary of regions and their interactions==

In a normally-operating antenna, positive and negative charges have no way of leaving the metal surface, and are separated from each other by the excitation &quot;signal&quot; voltage (a transmitter or other EM exciting potential). This generates an oscillating (or reversing) electrical dipole, which affects both the near field and the far field.

The boundary between the &quot;near field&quot; and &quot;far field&quot; regions is only vaguely defined, and it depends on the dominant wavelength () emitted by the source and the size of the radiating element.

===Near field===
The &quot;near field&quot; refers to places nearby the antenna conductors, or inside any polarizable media surrounding it, where the generation and emission of electromagnetic waves can be interfered with while the field lines remain electrically attached to the antenna, hence absorption of radiation in the near field by adjacent conducting objects detectably affects the loading on the signal generator (the transmitter). The electric and magnetic fields can exist independently of each other in the near field, and one type of field can be disproportionately larger than the other, in different subregions.

:An easy-to-observe example of a near-field effect is the change of noise levels picked up by a set of rabbit ear TV antennas when a human body part is moved in close to the &quot;ears&quot;. Likewise the change in sound quality of an FM radio tuned to a distant station when a person walks about in the area within an arm&#x27;s length of its antenna.

The near field is governed by multipole type fields, which can be considered as collections of dipoles with a fixed phase relationship.
The general purpose of conventional antennas is to communicate wirelessly over long distances, well into their far fields, and for calculations of radiation and reception for many simple antennas, most of the complicated effects in the near field can be conveniently ignored.

====Reactive near field====
The interaction with the medium (e.g. body capacitance) can cause energy to deflect back to the source feeding the antenna, as occurs in the &quot;reactive&quot; near field. This zone is roughly within of a wavelength of the nearest antenna surface.

The near field has been of increasing interest, particularly in the development of capacitive sensing technologies such as those used in the touchscreens of smart phones and tablet computers. Although the far field is the usual region of antenna function, certain devices that are called &quot;antennas&quot; but are specialized for near-field communication do exist. Magnetic induction as seen in a transformer can be seen as a very simple example of this type of near-field electromagnetic interaction.
For example send / receive coils for RFID, and emission coils for wireless charging and inductive heating; however their technical classification as &quot;antennas&quot; is contentious.

====Radiative near field====
The interaction with the medium can fail to return energy back to the source, but cause a distortion in the electromagnetic wave that deviates significantly from that found in free space, and this indicates the &quot;radiative&quot; near-field region, which is somewhat further away. Passive reflecting elements can be placed in this zone for the purpose of beam forming, such as the case with the Yagi–Uda antenna. Alternatively, multiple active elements can also be combined to form an antenna array, with lobe shape becoming a factor of element distances and excitation phasing.

===Transition zone===
Another intermediate region, called the &quot;transition zone&quot;, is defined on a somewhat different basis, namely antenna geometry and excitation wavelength. It is approximately one wavelength from the antenna, and is where the electric and magnetic parts of the radiated waves first balance out: The electric field of a linear antenna gains its corresponding magnetic field, and the magnetic field of a loop antenna gains its electric field. It can either be considered the furthest part of the near field, or the nearest part of the far field. It is from beyond this point that the electromagnetic wave becomes self-propagating. The electric and magnetic field portions of the wave are proportional to each other at a ratio defined by the characteristic impedance of the medium through which the wave is propagating.

===Far field===
In contrast, the &quot;far field&quot; is the region in which the field has settled into &quot;normal&quot; electromagnetic radiation. In this region, it is dominated by transverse electric or magnetic fields with electric dipole characteristics.
In the far-field region of an antenna, radiated power decreases as the square of distance, and absorption of the radiation does not feed back to the transmitter.

In the far-field region, each of the electric and magnetic parts of the EM field is &quot;produced by&quot; (or associated with) a change in the other part, and the ratio of electric and magnetic field intensities is simply the wave impedance in the medium.

Also known as the &quot;radiation-zone&quot;, the far field carries a relatively uniform wave pattern. The radiation zone is important because far fields in general fall off in amplitude by formula_1 This means that the total energy per unit area at a distance is proportional to formula_2 The area of the sphere is proportional to formula_3, so the total energy passing through the sphere is constant. This means that the far-field energy actually escapes to infinite distance (it &quot;radiates&quot;).

==Definitions==
The separation of the electric and magnetic fields into components is mathematical, rather than clearly physical, and is based on the relative rates at which the amplitude of different terms of the electric and magnetic field equations diminish as distance from the radiating element increases. The amplitudes of the far-field components fall off as formula_4, the &quot;radiative&quot; near-field amplitudes fall off as formula_5, and the &quot;reactive&quot; near-field amplitudes fall off as formula_6. Definitions of the &quot;regions&quot; attempt to characterize locations where the activity of the associated field &quot;components&quot; are the strongest. Mathematically, the distinction between &quot;field components&quot; is very clear, but the demarcation of the spatial &quot;field regions&quot; is subjective. All of the field components overlap everywhere, so for example, there are always substantial far-field and radiative near-field components in the closest-in near-field reactive region.

The regions defined below categorize field behaviors that are variable, even within the region of interest. Thus, the boundaries for these regions are approximate rules of thumb, as there are no precise cutoffs between them: All behavioral changes with distance are smooth changes. Even when precise boundaries can be defined in some cases, based primarily on antenna type and antenna size, experts may differ in their use of nomenclature to describe the regions. Because of these nuances, special care must be taken when interpreting technical literature that discusses far-field and near-field regions.

The term &quot;near-field region&quot; (also known as the &quot;near field&quot; or &quot;near zone&quot;) has the following meanings with respect to different telecommunications technologies:
* The close-in region of an antenna where the angular field distribution is dependent upon the distance from the antenna.
* In the study of diffraction and antenna design, the near field is that part of the radiated field that is below distances shorter than the Fraunhofer distance, which is given by formula_7 from the source of the diffracting edge or antenna of longitude or diameter .
* In fiber-optic communication, the region near a source or aperture that is closer than the Rayleigh length. (Presuming a Gaussian beam, which is appropriate for fiber optics.)

===Regions according to electromagnetic length===
The most convenient practice is to define the size of the regions or zones in terms of fixed numbers (fractions) of wavelengths distant from the center of the radiating part of the antenna, with the clear understanding that the values chosen are only approximate and will be somewhat inappropriate for different antennas in different surroundings. The choice of the cut-off numbers is based on the relative strengths of the field component amplitudes typically seen in ordinary practice.

====Electromagnetically short antennas====

For antennas shorter than half of the wavelength of the radiation they emit (i.e., electromagnetically &quot;short&quot; antennas), the far and near regional boundaries are measured in terms of a simple ratio of the distance from the radiating source to the wavelength of the radiation. For such an antenna, the near field is the region within a radius , while the far-field is the region for which . The transition zone is the region between and .

The length of the antenna, , is not important, and the approximation is the same for all shorter antennas (sometimes idealized as so-called &quot;point antennas&quot;). In all such antennas, the short length means that charges and currents in each sub-section of the antenna are the same at any given time, since the antenna is too short for the RF transmitter voltage to reverse before its effects on charges and currents are felt over the entire antenna length.

====Electromagnetically long antennas====
For antennas physically larger than a half-wavelength of the radiation they emit, the near and far fields are defined in terms of the Fraunhofer distance. Named after Joseph von Fraunhofer, the following formula gives the Fraunhofer distance:
:formula_8

where is the largest dimension of the radiator (or the diameter of the antenna) and is the wavelength of the radio wave. Either of the following two relations are equivalent, emphasizing the size of the region in terms of wavelengths or diameters :
:formula_9

This distance provides the limit between the near and far field. The parameter corresponds to the physical length of an antenna, or the diameter of a reflector (&quot;dish&quot;) antenna.

Having an antenna electromagnetically longer than one-half the dominated wavelength emitted considerably extends the near-field effects, especially that of focused antennas. Conversely, when a given antenna emits high frequency radiation, it will have a near-field region larger than what would be implied by a lower frequency (i.e. longer wavelength).

Additionally, a far-field region distance must satisfy these two conditions.
:formula_10
:formula_11

where is the largest physical linear dimension of the antenna and is the far-field distance. The far-field distance is the distance from the transmitting antenna to the beginning of the Fraunhofer region, or far field.

====Transition zone====
The &quot;transition zone&quot; between these near and far field regions, extending over the distance from one to two wavelengths from the antenna, is the intermediate region in which both near-field and far-field effects are important. In this region, near-field behavior dies out and ceases to be important, leaving far-field effects as dominant interactions. (See the &quot;Far Field&quot; image above.)

===Regions according to diffraction behavior===

====Far-field diffraction====

As far as acoustic wave sources are concerned, if the source has a maximum overall dimension or aperture width () that is large compared to the wavelength , the far-field region is commonly taken to exist at distances, when the Fresnel parameter formula_12 is larger than 1:
:formula_13

For a beam focused at infinity, the far-field region is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Fraunhofer region&quot;. Other synonyms are &quot;far field&quot;, &quot;far zone&quot;, and &quot;radiation field&quot;. Any electromagnetic radiation consists of an electric field component and a magnetic field component . In the far field, the relationship between the electric field component and the magnetic component is that characteristic of any freely propagating wave, where and have equal magnitudes at any point in space (where measured in units where [[speed of light|).

====Near-field diffraction====

In contrast to the far field, the [[diffraction]] pattern in the near field typically differs significantly from that observed at infinity and varies with distance from the source. In the near field, the relationship between and becomes very complex. Also, unlike the far field where [[electromagnetic wave]]s are usually characterized by a single [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] type (horizontal, vertical, circular, or elliptical), all four polarization types can be present in the near field.

The near field is a region in which there are strong inductive and capacitive effects from the currents and charges in the antenna that cause electromagnetic components that do not behave like far-field radiation. These effects decrease in power far more quickly with distance than do the far-field radiation effects. Non-propagating (or evanescent) fields extinguish very rapidly with distance, which makes their effects almost exclusively felt in the near-field region.

Also, in the part of the near field closest to the antenna (called the &quot;reactive near field&quot;, [[#Reactive near field, or the nearest part of the near field|see below]]), absorption of electromagnetic power in the region by a second device has effects that feed back to the transmitter, increasing the load on the transmitter that feeds the antenna by decreasing the antenna impedance that the transmitter &quot;sees&quot;. Thus, the transmitter can sense when power is being absorbed in the closest near-field zone (by a second antenna or some other object) and is forced to supply extra power to its antenna, and to draw extra power from its own power supply, whereas if no power is being absorbed there, the transmitter does not have to supply extra power.

==Near-field characteristics==

The near field itself is further divided into the &quot;reactive&quot; near field and the &quot;radiative&quot; near field. The &quot;reactive&quot; and &quot;radiative&quot; near-field designations are also a function of wavelength (or distance). However, these boundary regions are a fraction of one wavelength within the near field. The outer boundary of the reactive near-field region is commonly considered to be a distance of formula_14 times the wavelength (i.e., formula_15 or approximately ) from the antenna surface. The reactive near-field is also called the &quot;inductive&quot; near-field. The radiative near field (also called the &quot;Fresnel region&quot;) covers the remainder of the near-field region, from formula_15 out to the Fraunhofer distance.

===Reactive near field, or the nearest part of the near field===
In the reactive near field (very close to the antenna), the relationship between the strengths of the and fields is often too complicated to easily predict, and difficult to measure. Either field component ( or ) may dominate at one point, and the opposite relationship dominate at a point only a short distance away. This makes finding the true [[power density]] in this region problematic. This is because to calculate power, not only and both have to be measured but the [[phase (waves)|phase relationship]] between and as well as the angle between the two vectors must also be known in every point of space.

In this reactive region, not only is an electromagnetic wave being radiated outward into far space but there is a reactive component to the electromagnetic field, meaning that the strength, direction, and phase of the electric and magnetic fields around the antenna are sensitive to EM absorption and re-emission in this region, and respond to it. In contrast, absorption far from the antenna has negligible effect on the fields near the antenna, and causes no back-reaction in the transmitter.

Very close to the antenna, in the reactive region, [[energy]] of a certain amount, if not absorbed by a receiver, is held back and is stored very near the antenna surface. This energy is carried back and forth from the antenna to the reactive near field by electromagnetic radiation of the type that slowly changes [[electrostatic]] and magnetostatic effects. For example, current flowing in the antenna creates a purely magnetic component in the near field, which then collapses as the antenna current begins to reverse, causing transfer of the field&#x27;s magnetic energy back to electrons in the antenna as the changing magnetic field causes a self-inductive effect on the antenna that generated it. This returns energy to the antenna in a regenerative way, so that it is not lost. A similar process happens as electric charge builds up in one section of the antenna under the pressure of the signal voltage, and causes a local electric field around that section of antenna, due to the antenna&#x27;s [[self-capacitance]]. When the signal reverses so that charge is allowed to flow away from this region again, the built-up electric field assists in pushing electrons back in the new direction of their flow, as with the discharge of any unipolar capacitor. This again transfers energy back to the antenna current.

Because of this energy storage and return effect, if either of the inductive or electrostatic effects in the reactive near field transfer any field energy to electrons in a different (nearby) conductor, then this energy is lost to the primary antenna. When this happens, an extra drain is seen on the transmitter, resulting from the reactive near-field energy that is not returned. This effect shows up as a different impedance in the antenna, as seen by the transmitter.

The reactive component of the near field can give ambiguous or undetermined results when attempting measurements in this region. In other regions, the power density is inversely proportional to the square of the distance from the antenna. In the vicinity very close to the antenna, however, the energy level can rise dramatically with only a small decrease in distance toward the antenna. This energy can adversely affect both humans and measurement equipment because of the high powers involved.

===Radiative near field (Fresnel region), or farthest part of the near field===
The radiative near field (sometimes called the &quot;Fresnel region&quot;) does not contain reactive field components from the source antenna, since it is far enough from the antenna that back-coupling of the fields becomes out of phase with the antenna signal, and thus cannot efficiently return inductive or capacitive energy from antenna currents or charges. The energy in the radiative near field is thus all [[radiant energy]], although its mixture of magnetic and electric components are still different from the far field. Further out into the radiative near field (one half wavelength to 1 wavelength from the source), the and field relationship is more predictable, but the to relationship is still complex. However, since the radiative near field is still part of the near field, there is potential for unanticipated (or adverse) conditions.

For example, metal objects such as steel beams can act as antennas by inductively receiving and then &quot;re-radiating&quot; some of the energy in the radiative near field, forming a new radiating surface to consider. Depending on antenna characteristics and frequencies, such coupling may be far more efficient than simple antenna reception in the yet-more-distant far field, so far more power may be transferred to the secondary &quot;antenna&quot; in this region than would be the case with a more distant antenna. When a secondary radiating antenna surface is thus activated, it then creates its own near-field regions, but the same conditions apply to them.

===Compared to the far field===
The near field is remarkable for reproducing classical [[electromagnetic induction]] and electric charge effects on the EM field, which effects &quot;die-out&quot; with increasing distance from the antenna: The magnetic field component that’s in phase quadrature to electric fields is proportional to the inverse-cube of the distance (formula_6) and electric field strength proportional to inverse-square of distance (formula_5). This fall-off is far more rapid than the classical radiated far-field ( and fields, which are proportional to the simple inverse-distance (formula_4). Typically near-field effects are not important farther away than a few wavelengths of the antenna.

More-distant near-field effects also involve energy transfer effects that couple directly to receivers near the antenna, affecting the power output of the transmitter if they do couple, but not otherwise. In a sense, the near field offers energy that is available to a receiver if the energy is tapped, and this is sensed by the transmitter by means of responding to electromagnetic near fields emanating from the receiver. Again, this is the same principle that applies in [[electromagnetic induction|induction coupled]] devices, such as a [[transformer]], which draws more power at the primary circuit, if power is drawn from the secondary circuit. This is different with the far field, which constantly draws the same energy from the transmitter, whether it is immediately received, or not.

The amplitude of other components (non-radiative/non-dipole) of the electromagnetic field close to the antenna may be quite powerful, but, because of more rapid fall-off with distance than formula_4 behavior, they do not radiate energy to infinite distances. Instead, their energies remain trapped in the region near the antenna, not drawing power from the transmitter unless they excite a receiver in the area close to the antenna. Thus, the near fields only transfer energy to very nearby receivers, and, when they do, the result is felt as an extra power draw in the transmitter. As an example of such an effect, power is transferred across space in a common [[transformer]] or [[metal detector]] by means of near-field phenomena (in this case [[inductive coupling]]), in a strictly short-range effect (i.e., the range within one wavelength of the signal).

==Classical EM modelling==

Solving [[Maxwell&#x27;s equations]] for the [[electric field|electric]] and [[magnetic field]]s for a localized oscillating source, such as an antenna, surrounded by a homogeneous material (typically [[vacuum]] or [[air]]), yields fields that, far away, decay in proportion to formula_4 where is the distance from the source. These are the radiating fields, and the region where is large enough for these fields to dominate is the far field.

In general, the fields of a source in a [[homogeneity (physics)|homogeneous]] [[isotropic]] [[transmission medium|medium]] can be written as a [[multipole expansion]]. The terms in this expansion are [[spherical harmonic]]s (which give the angular dependence) multiplied by [[spherical Bessel function]]s (which give the radial dependence). For large , the spherical Bessel functions decay as formula_4, giving the radiated field above. As one gets closer and closer to the source (smaller ), approaching the near field, other powers of become significant.

The next term that becomes significant is proportional to formula_5 and is sometimes called the &quot;induction term&quot;. It can be thought of as the primarily magnetic energy stored in the field, and returned to the antenna in every half-cycle, through self-induction. For even smaller , terms proportional to formula_6 become significant; this is sometimes called the &quot;electrostatic field term&quot; and can be thought of as stemming from the electrical charge in the antenna element.

Very close to the source, the multipole expansion is less useful (too many terms are required for an accurate description of the fields). Rather, in the near field, it is sometimes useful to express the contributions as a sum of radiating fields combined with [[evanescent field]]s, where the latter are exponentially decaying with . And in the source itself, or as soon as one enters a region of inhomogeneous materials, the multipole expansion is no longer valid and the full solution of Maxwell&#x27;s equations is generally required.

===Antennas===

If an oscillating electrical current is applied to a conductive structure of some type, electric and magnetic fields will appear in space about that structure. If those fields are lost to a propagating space wave the structure is often termed an antenna. Such an antenna can be an assemblage of [[electrical conductor|conductor]]s in space typical of [[radio]] devices or it can be an [[aperture]] with a given current distribution radiating into space as is typical of [[microwave]] or [[optical device]]s. The actual values of the fields in space about the antenna are usually quite complex and can vary with distance from the antenna in various ways.

However, in many practical applications, one is interested only in effects where the distance from the antenna to the observer is very much greater than the largest dimension of the transmitting antenna. The equations describing the fields created about the antenna can be simplified by assuming a large separation and dropping all terms that provide only minor contributions to the final field. These simplified distributions have been termed the &quot;far field&quot; and usually have the property that the angular distribution of energy does not change with distance, although the energy levels still vary with distance and time. Such an angular energy distribution is usually termed an [[antenna pattern]].

Note that, by the principle of [[reciprocity (electromagnetism)|reciprocity]], the pattern observed when a particular antenna is transmitting is identical to the pattern measured when the same antenna is used for reception. Typically one finds simple relations describing the antenna far-field patterns, often involving trigonometric functions or at worst [[Fourier transform|Fourier]] or [[Hankel transform]] relationships between the antenna current distributions and the observed far-field patterns. While far-field simplifications are very useful in engineering calculations, this does not mean the near-field functions cannot be calculated, especially using modern computer techniques. An examination of how the near fields form about an antenna structure can give great insight into the operations of such devices.

===Impedance===
The electromagnetic field in the far-field region of an antenna is independent of the details of the near field and the nature of the antenna. The wave impedance is the ratio of the strength of the electric and magnetic fields, which in the far field are in phase with each other. Thus, the far field &quot;[[impedance of free space]]&quot; is resistive and is given by:
:formula_25

With the usual approximation for the [[speed of light]] in free space m&quot;/&quot;s, this gives the frequently used expression:
:formula_26

The electromagnetic field in the near-field region of an electrically small coil antenna is predominantly magnetic. For small values of the impedance of a magnetic loop is low and inductive, at short range being asymptotic to:
:formula_27

The electromagnetic field in the near-field region of an electrically short rod antenna is predominantly electric. For small values of the impedance is high and capacitive, at short range being asymptotic to:
:formula_28

In both cases, the wave impedance converges on that of [[free space]] as the range approaches the far field.

<text>Berlin Brandenburg Airport () () is an international airport in Schönefeld, just south of the German capital and state of Berlin, in the state of Brandenburg. Named after the former West Berlin mayor and West German chancellor Willy Brandt, it is located south-east of the city centre and serves as a base for Condor, easyJet, Eurowings, Ryanair and Sundair. It mostly has flights to European metropolitan and leisure destinations as well as a number of intercontinental services.

The new airport replaced Tempelhof, Schönefeld, and Tegel airports, and became the single commercial airport serving Berlin and the surrounding State of Brandenburg, an area with 6 million inhabitants. With projected annual passenger numbers of around 34 million, Berlin Brandenburg Airport has become the third busiest airport in Germany, surpassing Düsseldorf Airport and making it one of the fifteen busiest in Europe.

At the time of opening, the airport had a theoretical capacity of 46 million passengers per year. Terminal 1 accounts for 28 million of this; Terminal 2, which did not open until 24 March 2022, having been delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic, accounts for 6 million; and Terminal 5, the terminal buildings of the former Berlin-Schönefeld Airport, accounts for another 12 million. Planned further expansion would bring the airport&#x27;s total annual capacity to 58 million passengers by 2035.

The airport was originally planned to open in October 2011, five years after starting construction in 2006. The project encountered successive delays due to poor construction planning, execution, management, and corruption. Berlin Brandenburg Airport finally received its operational licence in May 2020, and opened for commercial traffic on 31 October 2020, 14 years after construction started and 29 years after official planning was begun. Schönefeld&#x27;s refurbished passenger facilities were incorporated as &quot;Terminal 5&quot; on 25 October 2020 while all other airlines completed the transition from Tegel to Berlin Brandenburg Airport by 8 November 2020.

==History==
===Plans for a new Berlin Airport===
After the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and following German reunification in 1990, Berlin once again became the German federal capital; leaders made plans to recognise the city&#x27;s increased importance by constructing a large commercial airport. The existing airports, Tegel Airport, Schönefeld Airport and Tempelhof Airport, were ageing and becoming increasingly congested with rising passenger numbers. To ensure the economic viability of the project, they pursued the &quot;single airport concept&quot;: the new airport would become the sole commercial airport for Berlin and Brandenburg. They planned to close Tegel, Schönefeld and Tempelhof upon opening the new airport, then ban commercial aviation from any other airport in Brandenburg.

On 2 May 1991, the &quot;Berlin Brandenburg Flughafen Holding GmbH&quot; (BBF) was founded, owned by the states of Berlin and Brandenburg (37% each) and the Federal Republic of Germany (the remaining 26%). Eberhard Diepgen, Mayor of Berlin, became the first chairman of the supervisory board. The holding company announced on 20 June 1993 that Sperenberg Airfield, Jüterbog Airfield and the area south of Schönefeld Airport, where the evaluation of the locations Sperenberg, Jüterbog East, Jüterbog West, Tietzow, Michelsdorf, Borkheide and Schönefeld South was carried out according to five criteria with different weighting. Each site was advocated by various factions in the ensuing political discussion. With regard to land-use planning and noise pollution, rural Sperenberg and Jüterbog were considered more suitable for construction of a large airport. Economic considerations favoured an airport located near the city centre, with existing road and rail links (as is the case with Schönefeld).

On 28 May 1996, Mayor Diepgen, Minister-President of Brandenburg Manfred Stolpe and Federal Minister for Transport Matthias Wissmann committed to Schönefeld as the site for the new airport. This so-called &quot;consensus decision&quot; was later affirmed by the respective state legislatures. The new airport would use some infrastructure, such as a runway, from the existing Schönefeld Airport.

===Failed privatisation===
Originally, BBF anticipated that the new airport would be owned and operated by a private investor. They called for proposals, which led to two bidding consortia emerging as serious contenders. One was led by Hochtief through its Hochtief Airport subsidiary and included ABB, Fraport and Bankengesellschaft Berlin as partners. The other consortium comprised IVG, Flughafen Wien AG, Dorsch-Consult, Commerzbank and Caisse des Dépôts. On 19 September 1998, BBF announced that the Hochtief consortium were the successful bidder. This saw them granted exclusive authority to negotiate the terms and conditions for an acquisition of the Berlin Brandenburg Airport holding and the construction and operation of the new airport for 50 years.

On 31 March 1999, BBF officially commissioned Hochtief and its partners to construct the new airport, causing IVG to file a lawsuit. The Brandenburg Oberlandesgericht acknowledged the concerns voiced by IVG. In its review, it found that in certain points the assessment of the applications had been biased towards Hochtief. This led to annulment of the contract award on 3 August of that year.

Hochtief Airport and IVG teamed up and created a plan for a joint bid on 10 November 2000 in an attempt to receive the contract to construct and operate the new airport. At the time BBF hoped that the planning approval could be completed in 2002, with the tentative opening in 2007.

When Hochtief/IVG submitted its bid in February 2002, the BBF board consisted of Manfred Stolpe, who would become Federal Minister of Transportation; Klaus Wowereit, who replaced Eberhard Diepgen as Mayor of Berlin and chair of the board; and Matthias Platzeck, who replaced Stolpe as Minister-President of Brandenburg. The board determined that the proposal would not be practical and voted 22 May 2003 to scrap the privatisation plan. Hochtief and IVG received approximately €50 million compensation for their planning effort.

===Public ownership and construction permit===
The new Berlin airport would be planned, owned and operated by BBF Holding. Shortly afterwards BBF Holding became &quot;Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg GmbH&quot; (FBB) and remained under the ownership of Berlin, Brandenburg and the federal government. On 13 August 2004, the Brandenburg state ministry for infrastructure and regional policy granted approval for the development of Schönefeld Airport into the new Berlin Brandenburg International Airport.

A legal battle ensued, as local residents filed lawsuits against the ministry&#x27;s decision. The dispute ended 16 March 2006, when the Federal Administrative Court of Germany rejected the residents&#x27; arguments. The court imposed stipulations on flight operations at the new airport. The construction permit was granted only under the condition that once operational, the number of people living in the approach path would be lower compared to the situation surrounding the three existing airports – Tegel, Schönefeld and Tempelhof. Therefore, it was mandatory for Tegel and Schönefeld to close (Tempelhof was already decommissioned in 2008) once Berlin&#x27;s air traffic was concentrated at the new airport.

===Financing===
By 2009, the construction cost was budgeted at €2.83 billion. FBB raised the financing for the project by a credit raising of €2.4 billion, a bank deposit of €430 million by the FBB partners, and an additional €440 million of equity capital provided by FBB.

During construction, it became clear that the airport&#x27;s costs would significantly increase as a result of initial underestimates, construction flaws, and increased expenses for soundproofing nearby homes. By 2012, the series of delays in opening was expected to lead to a number of lawsuits against FBB with the now defunct Air Berlin announcing its intentions of such a move.

By late 2012, expenditures for Berlin Brandenburg Airport totalled €4.3 billion, almost twice the originally anticipated figure.

It became clear in November 2015 that the financial concept of the airport was fundamentally flawed. The main purpose of the many stores planned at the airport was to serve passengers who were changing planes, assuming that Berlin would be a big international hub. It was acknowledged in 2015 that competition between the hubs was already too intense. Frankfurt Airport and London Heathrow would resist losing passenger shares without a price war and that few if any airlines would abandon their hubs for Berlin. The only remaining potential airline for operating a hub was Air Berlin, which was in financial difficulties and did not plan to provide long-distance service.

German Railways Deutsche Bahn also sued for non-usage of the ghost station below the airport in 2012 with the airport having to pay damages.

In November 2015, auditors with the Brandenburg Comptroller concluded that financial control executed by Berlin, Brandenburg, and Germany over the airport as owners was insufficient and inefficient. The Comptroller published a 400-page report in February 2016 describing the flawed opening including several construction lapses. This led the BER boss to retaliate publicly against the comptroller on 27 February decrying the release of the numbers.

Soundproofing nearby homes would be €50million more expensive because of a verdict of the main administrative courts of the states of Berlin and Brandenburg. On 5 May 2016, the Federal Administrative Court decided in favour of 25,500 plaintiffs. The key directive of the verdict was that rooms must be provided with adequate ventilation if windows are closed for noise, and the airport authority must also determine how air inside the structures can be vented. The airport avoided liability claims against Imtech and other firms involved in the construction of the fire exhaust system.

By 2015, total costs amounted to €5.4 billion. Revised plans suggest additional costs amounting to an extra €2.19 billion. On 3 June 2015, Germany applied for a €2.5 billion spending approval from the EU, to be added to the previous total of €4.3 billion, bringing total costs to €6.8 billion. Financing for the entire airport appeared headed toward bankruptcy when the EU was unwilling to approve the pending request. If the request were to be denied, the airport authority stated it would be bankrupt by August 2016. The EU would only permit an additional €2.2 billion, which it did on 3 August 2016. A €2.4 billion loan was signed on 13 February 2017 containing €1.1 billion for financing and €1.3 billion to resolve old bad loans. The German federal government and the states of Berlin and Brandenburg guaranteed the debt.

Although the airport had yet to open, officials were already planning a possible third runway for approximately €1 billion, and other new projects, such as an additional terminal, expanded baggage system and another freight facility. The total additional spending would amount to €3.2 billion. The board warned of a further rise in costs because the airport would not open before 2017: the current cost frame at that time was limited to 2016; the estimated cost of €6.9 billion was current as of May 2016. The airport company reportedly made the assurance to the European Investment Bank that the airport would open in September 2019. However, forecasts estimated the airport would not be ready to open until 2020. This would require an additional €500 million refinancing to bridge the gap between 2019 and 2020. The airport published a need for another billion euros up until 2020. Thus the three years of work from 2018 onwards would cost at least €900 million. The total cost of the airport will top €6.5 billion.

On 13 January 2018, the company requested an additional €2.8 billion for extensions until 2030. Taking that into account, the total cost came to €9.4 billion, with a total of €10.3 billion if the €900 million in overhead costs for 2019–2020 were factored in. An economical estimate determined the costs for the overhead at a conservative figure of €770 million. The airport was planning to borrow €400 million. Another issue arose when it became public that the airport head was earning an annual salary of €500,000. A new loan was granted by the German parliament on 30 June 2018 totalling €132 million. With the other two owners, the states of Brandenburg and Berlin, permitting their shares of the loan as well, the loan would total €500 million. The board postponed a decision concerning the loan until the end of August 2018, which left the entire finance planning in jeopardy. At the end of August 2018, Berlin&#x27;s head of finance, Matthias Kollatz, remarked that the airport may face abrupt bankruptcy on 1 January 2019 if no immediate measures were to be taken. The financial head resigned from the holding company of Berlin&#x27;s airports at the end of September 2019. According to projections the airport was in dire need of additional €508 million from 2021 onwards. Reports indicated another need for financial support from authorities for the next 2 years as of 29 April 2020 amounting to €1.8 billion. A new study claimed that the net worth of the current building was far lower than the credited €4.866 billion and would be settled at €3 billion less. The financial gap due to the COVID-19 pandemic was estimated to be €300 million for Tegel and Schönefeld combined, thus the new airport would be in need for financial support for years to come. The 2019 annual report from BER&#x27;s operating firm was criticised by The Left as extremely short and not transparent. Cash flow concerns amounted to an immediate €1.5 billion by 20 June 2020.

On 13 July 2020, prosecutors filed a complaint on suspicion of falsifying the balance sheet. The financial auditors for FBB were the same as for the now insolvent Wirecard company, raising doubts about the validity of the audits. The plan to generate profits starting in 2023/2024 had been interrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to airport head .

The FBB announced on 9 October 2020 a need for €375 million for 2021 to cover current costs for BER. An additional €552 million were needed as a stabilization for missing passengers.

===Naming===

During much of the planning and construction phase the new airport was known as Berlin Brandenburg International Airport, abbreviated BBI. It was then discovered that the IATA code BBI already referred to Biju Patnaik Airport (also known as Bhubaneswar Airport) in India. When the planned opening date of 2 June 2012 drew nearer the FBB launched a marketing campaign introducing the BER branding, reflecting the new airport code.

In 2007, the FBB board decided that Berlin Brandenburg Airport would be given a second name, honouring a person with a distinctive link to the city of Berlin. On 11 December 2009, the decision was made in favour of Willy Brandt. The Nobel Peace laureate of 1971 served as mayor of West Berlin from 1957 to 1966 and as West German chancellor from 1969 to 1974. Berlin mayor Klaus Wowereit and Minister-President of Brandenburg Matthias Platzeck, both members of the SPD (which Brandt led from 1964 to 1987) led the effort to add Brandt&#x27;s name to the airport.

Other suggested honorees included Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg, Albert Einstein and Marlene Dietrich (suggested by members of the Christian Democratic Union), Gustav Stresemann (nominated by the Free Democratic Party), and Otto Lilienthal (advocated by the Green Party).

As a result of the ongoing problems affecting the airport and the continuous negative publicity it got in the German and international press, the considered revoking the airport&#x27;s permission to bear the former chancellor&#x27;s name. This is due to concerns that an ongoing association might be considered disrespectful towards his legacy. However, no such measure has been taken so far.

==Terminals==

===Terminal 1===
The U-shaped main terminal building of Berlin Brandenburg Airport, named Terminal 1 and consisting of sections A, B (01-25), C and D, was designed by gmp architects. They are the same company that designed the hexagonal Terminal A at Tegel Airport, which opened in 1974. At BER, the terminal sits between the two runways, creating a so-called &quot;midfield airport&quot; above the underground train station. The terminal has four public levels, designated 0, 1, 2 and 3.

The check-in area is located in the public area at Level 1 and houses 118 counters organised in eight clusters, called &quot;check-in isles&quot;. Planners anticipate that a significant number of passengers will use the more than 100 self check-in machines that will be installed. Additionally, by May 2015, two extensions had been added to both sides of the main check-in area, containing 12 more check-in counters and eight security lanes each to avoid overcrowding of the main hall.

The airside area will be accessible only to ticketed and screened passengers. Securitas Germany will staff the 35 screening stations. BER is equipped with 25 jet bridges with another 85 aircraft stands on the apron. The boarding and arrival areas are divided into three piers with the main pier long, and the north and south piers at each. The main pier contains 16 jet-bridges; all but one have two levels, thus, separating arriving and departing passengers. Level 1 is intended for Schengen Area passengers (gates A01–A20, B01–B20), while Level 2 (gates C01–C19, D01–D17) is for non-Schengen passengers. Eight of the gates can accommodate wide-body aircraft, and one gate has been designed to accommodate the Airbus A380. The apron has sufficient space to allow installation of a dual jetway allowing a quick boarding and disembarking process. A mezzanine (Level Z) at gates A21–22 and B21 allows for additional pre-boarding security checks for high-risk flights to the United States and Israel. Lufthansa operates an airport lounge at the north end of the main pier (gate B20), which will also be open for passengers of the respective alliance partners. An airport-operated lounge is located at the south end of the main pier (gate A20), which is contracted by most of the non-Star Alliance carriers operating from T1.
The south pier was reserved for near-exclusive use of defunct Air Berlin and its Oneworld partners. The south terminal contains nine single-storey jet bridges (gates A30–A38). The north pier features a more minimalist design compared to the other two piers. This is to meet the demands of low-cost carriers and has no jetbridges but boarding gates (B30–45) with direct apron access.

Major operators at Terminal 1 are easyJet, the Lufthansa Group, Condor, Aegean Airlines, Air France, KLM, British Airways, Turkish Airlines, United Airlines and Qatar Airways, amongst others.

===Terminal 2===

Plans for a separate low-cost airline terminal costing €200 million were released in March 2016. Construction for the now-named Terminal 2 with section B (30–45) (which was originally constructed as part of Terminal 1) began in 2018 and finished in time in September 2020 to provide further capacity especially for low-cost carriers. Terminal 2 is constructed as a more basic-departures-and-arrivals facility next to the Terminal 1 main building, directly connected with its northern pier to gain more check-in capacity while sharing the same airside areas.

Originally Eurowings was supposed to operate their Berlin base out of Terminal 2. However, the COVID-19 pandemic kept the facility closed, as the capacity was not needed for the foreseeable future. Until then, all flights were handled in Terminal 1.

In November 2021 it had been announced that Terminal 2 was planned to be opened by April 2022 to relieve Terminal 1 as demand for aviation has picked up; thus, Terminal 1 had capacity issues. Terminal 2 was opened on 24 March 2022 with Ryanair as the primary tenant, but in the same year in November Wizz Air has also moved its operations to the new terminal, while the original intended user of the facility (Eurowings) remained in Terminal 1.

===Former Terminal 5===
Terminal 5 was made up of the former terminal facilities of old Berlin Schönefeld Airport, which were refurbished and renamed from sections A, B, C, and D to K, L, Q, and M, respectively. In 2019, it was decided to leave the old facilities operational to provide more capacity for the expected passenger volume. The old tarmac at Schönefeld, which was refurbished and upgraded, was also used. Terminal 5, which was located on the north side of the airport, was connected with the central areas of the airport (Terminals 1 and 2) solely landside by the S-Bahn and public transit buses between the new airport station and the old station that formerly served Schönefeld Airport.

Terminal 5 was scheduled to be operated until the inauguration of the planned Terminal 3 by 2030. In November 2020, it was announced that Terminal 5 would be shut down temporarily for low passenger volume in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, with all flights relocating to the main Terminal 1. The terminal was closed until further notice on 22 February 2021 and was, at the time of closure, not expected to reopen again.

In January 2021, a vaccination center had opened at Terminal 5 to administer COVID-19 vaccines. The vaccination center also remained open after the closure of the terminal to flights. In March 2022, Terminal 5 was converted into a makeshift shelter to house refugees fleeing Ukraine.

In November 2022, the airport authority confirmed that Terminal 5 will remain closed permanently while airlines that previously operated from this terminal now operate from Terminal 2.

==Airport overview==
===Runways===
Berlin Brandenburg Airport has two parallel runways. With a spacing of , they allow simultaneous instrument approaches.

The northern runway of BER is the southern runway of the old Schönefeld Airport and has been in use since the 1960s. To adapt it for the new airport, it has been renovated and lengthened from . The newly built southern runway has a length of and was officially commissioned on 31 May 2012. Blackouts of the runway beacon of the southern runway led to investigations concerning air traffic safety.

BER covers 1,470 hectares (3,632 acres) of land.

On October 3, 2024, the two runways received new designations due to shifts in the Earth’s magnetic field. Runway 07L/25R changed to 06L/24R, runway 07R/25L to 06R/24L.

===Air traffic control===

Deutsche Flugsicherung is responsible for air traffic control and apron control at Berlin Brandenburg Airport. At , the control tower is the third highest in Germany (only surpassed by the control towers at Munich Airport and Düsseldorf Airport). On 25 March 2012, the new tower opened replacing the one at Schönefeld. Technical control (power supply and IT) went into operation on 16 March 2018.

===Cargo and general aviation===
The initial module of the midfield cargo facilities has a capacity of of cargo per year. With the completion of all planned expansions this could handle up to per year. The general aviation terminal is located in the northern part of BER.

===Airport tourism facilities===
The &quot;Infotower&quot; was a observation tower located adjacent to the northern cargo terminal that included a museum and a gift shop. It was closed and demolished in 2016. FBB also offers guided tours of the airport which have grown in popularity since the delayed opening.

===Aircraft maintenance===
The two large hangars at BER were to be used by Lufthansa and Air Berlin respectively. However, Air Berlin have ceased operations as of 28 October 2017. Both provide enough space for maintenance work on four to five narrow-body aircraft.

===Government use===
The Executive Transport Wing of the German Defence Ministry (&quot;Flugbereitschaft&quot;), responsible for government flights, will move large parts of its operations to Berlin Brandenburg Airport from its still-current base at Cologne Bonn Airport near the former West German capital Bonn. It operates a fleet of Bombardier Global Express, Airbus A319, Airbus A321, Airbus A340-300 and Airbus A350-900 VIP-configured aircraft. However Cologne/Bonn will remain the home base of the government fleet for the time being.

The Institute for Federal Real Estate has been planning to construct a terminal on the northern edge of the airport for use by government officials and to welcome foreign dignitaries during state visits. The former Terminal A of Schönefeld Airport was planned to serve as an interim terminal until the new building was to be finished. However, in March 2016 the management of the airport terminated the contract with the German government that guaranteed usage of Terminal A of Schönefeld Airport upon the completion of BER for the area to be used for a different purpose. The termination was disputed between airport officials and the German Federal Ministry of Transport and Digital Infrastructure.

Mühlenfeld suggested a provisional ramp area west of Schönefeld&#x27;s main terminal as a replacement solution and construction site for an interim government terminal at the end of February 2016. This then supposed interim government terminal was finished at a cost of around €70 million while the permanent government terminal was planned to begin operations around 2025, at a cost of additionally around €344 million, which left its completion in doubt. In December 2019, the German government cancelled all plans to construct a more representative facility until at least 2030.

The government terminal was inaugurated and put in use on 21 October 2020.

===Operating hours===
Noise abatement regulations in the airport&#x27;s operating licence prohibit takeoffs and landings between 00:00 and 05:00. The Federal Administrative Court of Germany rejected a lawsuit by residents to extend this night flight ban from 23:00 to 06:00 on 13 October 2011. It was also ruled that affected residents should be provided with additional noise insulation.

===Major operators===
Until its demise, Air Berlin had planned to move its primary hub from Tegel to Berlin Brandenburg. As a member of the Oneworld airline alliance, Air Berlin required airport facilities capable of meeting the demands of its connecting passengers that Tegel could not provide. However, Air Berlin filed for insolvency on 15 August 2017 and large parts of it were bought by Lufthansa, Germany&#x27;s largest airline, ahead of its collapse on the 27th of that month. The airport leadership declared in September 2017 that the bankruptcy of Air Berlin would have had no imminent impact on the expected traffic volume at the new airport as several of Air Berlin&#x27;s routes had been taken over by other airlines, e.g., easyJet.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020, easyJet was due to become the overall largest airline at the airport in terms of routes served, ahead of Ryanair. In May 2019, Ryanair announced that they would not move to the new facilities, and would keep using the old building at the side of Berlin Schönefeld Airport, which has now become part of Berlin Brandenburg Airport as its Terminal 5. As of 2021, Ryanair remained in the new main building because Terminal 5 was closed for the foreseeable future. In 2022, Ryanair moved to Terminal 2.

Lufthansa does not use Berlin Brandenburg Airport as a hub. By 2011, they planned to greatly expand its presence in Berlin. At its former facilities at Tegel Airport the airline added several European destinations which have all since ceased or were turned over to Eurowings.

Furthermore, the airlines Condor and Sundair operate bases at the airport.

The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the airport&#x27;s already sparse long-haul operations is still ongoing. As of summer 2020, eight destinations in the US, Asia, and the Middle East were supposed to be served, but travel restrictions caused various connections to be terminated or not to be activated. Some routes, such as to Singapore with Scoot, have since resumed. In 2021, the airport authority sought to establish 25 long-haul routes from Berlin by 2025 including negotiations for a revised bilateral agreement to allow Emirates to serve a fifth German city. United Airlines announced its return to Berlin with a service to Newark, which already had been served from Tegel, as well as a new route to Washington, D.C., in 2023. In July 2022, Delta Air Lines announced its 2023 return to Berlin with a service to New York–Kennedy, which it had last served from Tegel from 2017 to 2019. Currently this is a seasonal connection, only in the summer flight schedule.

===Projected passenger volume and expansion plans===
Since German reunification, air traffic in Berlin has increased greatly. In 1991, the combined passenger volume of the city&#x27;s airports was 7.9 million per year. By 2014, this number had risen to 28 million. By Berlin Brandenburg&#x27;s opening, it was projected to have a capacity of 27 million passengers per year. There were concerns that the airport could have insufficient capacity upon opening and plans were already in place for expansion. It may be expanded by up to two satellite concourses, bringing the terminal capacity to 45 million with runways capable of accommodating 50 million passengers per year. The two satellites located on the apron parallel to the main pier and linked by tunnel, are included in the construction permit of Berlin Brandenburg Airport. This means they could be built at any time without further regulatory hurdles or the possibility of third-party objections. A possible third runway could be located in the south, though no such plans exist to date.

It was planned to build a Terminal 3 next to Terminal 2 by 2029. This plan was delayed because of the COVID-19 pandemic.

==Airlines and destinations==
===Passenger===
The following airlines offer regular scheduled and charter flights at Berlin Brandenburg Airport:

===Cargo===
==Statistics==
===Annual traffic===

In 2019, the two Berlin operational airports together served 35.6 million passengers, which sharply decreased to 9 million for 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19-pandemic. In 2021, Berlin Brandenburg Airport slightly increased that figure to 9.9 million passengers. In 2024, the airport served 25.5 million passengers.

Data for 2019 (pre-pandemic year; closure of Berlin Schönefeld and Berlin Tegel airports). The data is taken from the official airport website.



==Ground transportation==
===Rail===


The terminal connects to a east–west railway tunnel under the apron and the terminal complex. As the nine tunnel sections were the first structures to be built, they were constructed by conventional excavations.

BER Airport station has six tracks and forms the lowest level of Terminal 1–2. Two tracks serve as a terminus for the S-Bahn – with the S9 serving the Stadtbahn and the S45 serving the southern Ringbahn. The other four tracks handle EuroCity, InterCity, Intercity-Express and Regional-Express trains. The Terminal 5 complex is served by Schönefeld (bei Berlin) station which previously served the former Schönefeld Airport.

Deutsche Bahn confirmed in August 2011 that multiple daily Intercity-Express and InterCity trains will connect the airport to Bielefeld, Hannover, Hamburg, Dresden and Wolfsburg. EuroCity trains will also connect to Wrocław and Kraków in Poland and Amsterdam in the Netherlands. After the delayed opening, it is not clear when this will happen. Currently there is only an InterCity train to Dresden and Rostock.

About half of the passengers are expected to access BER by rail. An Airport Express line (FEX, Regionalbahn) connects the airport with the Berlin Hauptbahnhof (Berlin main station) in 30 minutes. Two more stops at Potsdamer Platz and Berlin Südkreuz will be part of the Airport Express, which is planned to make the trip in 20 minutes. As of 2024, rebuilding the Berlin–Dresden railway that would allow the 20-minute trip to Hauptbahnhof is expected to finish in 2025. Until then, the Airport Express train will run via Berlin-Gesundbrunnen and Ostkreuz.

According to the district administrator of Dahme-Spreewald, train rides from southern Brandenburg towards BER might be complicated and require changing trains. He suggested a new rail concept might be necessary. Final construction permission for the railway station was granted on 26 March 2018. The final permit for Dresdner Bahn construction was granted on 13 September 2019.

Because Terminal 5 was closed, both stations serving the airport area were renamed in December 2023, to &quot;BER Airport station&quot; and to &quot;Schönefeld (bei Berlin) station&quot;.

====Proposed expansions====
;U-Bahn
Line U7 terminates short of the airport (at Rudow) but there are plans to extend it towards the airport if and when funds become available. The issue is complicated by the fact that the line would have to cross the state border between Berlin and Brandenburg and it is unclear who would have to pay for which parts of construction operations and maintenance. While Berlin has many &quot;ghost stations&quot; built in preparation for potential future construction, there is no provision underneath the terminal building for a station.

;Magnetic levitation railway
In June 2020, the CDU Berlin (then in opposition at the state level) proposed building a Maglev of the Transport System Bögl (developed by the Bavarian construction company Max Bögl) to the airport.

===Road===
Berlin Brandenburg Airport is connected by its own exit to the A113. The road carries traffic into Berlin via the A100 and out to the A10 where it continues south as the A13 in the direction of Dresden. Highway 96a along the north side of the airport is being expanded to four lanes towards Potsdam.

The airport has five multi-storey car parks and 13 open parking areas on the site with a total capacity for around 10,000 vehicles. In addition, there are car parks offered by third-party providers at lower prices in the immediate vicinity. There are also separate car parks for employees.

A study released in September 2016 attested that BER would double the amount of vehicular traffic, causing frequent traffic jams on the Autobahn once the airport opened. The A100 and A113 did not have enough lanes to support the expected volume of traffic. The approach to BER was deemed insufficient for the expected traffic and was expected to lead to heavy congestion on the highways throughout south-central Berlin. There were also concerns about increases in vehicle crashes and air pollution.
Congestion was expected to be high in tunnels leading to the airport, causing frequent closings of the Britz tunnel on the A100.

Over 10% of passengers were expected to come from Poland, via upgraded highways on the Polish side of the border. It was hoped that these upgrades would make the airport accessible for air travellers from the western regions of that country.

===Bus===
Public transport connections at the new airport include numerous bus services. BER is served by the express buses X7, X71 and X11. The X7 connects to the U7 subway at Rudow station. X71 connects the airport to Alt Mariendorf along the U6 via Rudow. The X11 bus continues to Lichterfelde-West and to Dahlem. There are also special express buses costing a surcharge dubbed &quot;BER1&quot; and &quot;BER2&quot; which connect the airport with Rathaus Steglitz and Potsdam main station respectively. Other bus lines also stop at a number of stations, providing connections with Berlin&#x27;s public transport network and destinations in Brandenburg.

===Bicycle===
The access to the airport by bicycle is considered lacking by the local ADFC who demand a bicycle highway to the new airport. A reason cited for the lacking bicycle access is that the plans dating to 2006 made no such provision.

==Commercial and exposition area==

===Berlin Air Show (ILA)===

On 3 July 2012, the Berlin ExpoCenter Airport opened on the southeastern portion of the airport grounds. Messe Berlin operates the exposition facility that is primarily intended as the site of the biennial ILA Berlin Air Show.

===Airport Information Centre===
Coinciding with groundbreaking for construction of the new airport, an information and public relations centre called &quot;airportworld&quot; opened near the old Schönefeld Airport. On 14 November 2007, the &quot;Infotower&quot;, a public viewing tower containing an exhibition about the new airport opened on the BER construction site.

===Business park===
The area surrounding BER is zoned as a commercial district. Plans call for the construction of shopping centres and parking structures as well as industrial, commercial and office spaces. Situated at the terminal complex will be the &quot;BER Airport City&quot; with an area of . Marketing of the real estate began in autumn 2006 and beginning in 2009 offices, hotels, car rentals, four car parks with a capacity of 10,000, restaurants and retail spaces were built here.

To the north is the &quot;BER Business Park Berlin&quot; with a planned area of for industrial and commercial use as well as congress centers. A further &quot;Business Park North&quot; was proposed as a future use of the area of the old Schönefeld terminal. However, those plans were put on hold in view of the decision to incorporate the terminal into the new airport.

==Construction progress and issues==
=== Overview ===
Berlin Brandenburg Airport was originally planned to open in October 2011, five years after starting construction in 2006. However, the project encountered a series of successive delays due to poor construction planning, execution, management, and corruption. The Airport finally received its operational licence in May 2020, and opened for commercial traffic on 31 October 2020, 14 years after construction started and 29 years after official planning was begun. Schönefeld&#x27;s refurbished passenger facilities were incorporated as &quot;Terminal 5&quot; on 25 October 2020 while all other airlines completed the transition from Tegel to Berlin Brandenburg Airport by 8 November 2020.

The most significant cause for the continuing delays was the fire protection and alarm system. In the terminal building, the system was not built according to the construction permit and failed the mandatory acceptance test necessary to open the airport. FBB proposed an interim solution employing up to 700 human fire spotters, which the building supervision department of the local Dahme-Spreewald district rejected. Inspectors uncovered flaws in the wiring, programming and implementation of the highly complex system designed by Siemens and Bosch. The system automatically controls sprinklers, smoke extractors and fire doors. For aesthetic reasons, designers decided that the terminal would have smoke extraction ducts in its ceiling but that they would not exhaust to its rooftop. During a fire, smoke would be pumped from the ceiling into a shaft running down and through the basement &quot;below&quot; the structure. This required the natural rising behaviour of hot air in the shaft to be reversed. Achieving this on the scale necessary for this airport is a unique undertaking and so far this elaborate smoke extraction system has not worked as planned. To meet the acceptance test requirements, large scale reconstruction work of the fire system might be needed. It emerged that Alfredo di Mauro, who designed the fire safety system, was not a qualified engineer. While his business cards stated he was an engineer, he was actually qualified as an engineering draughtsman. Di Mauro was dismissed by the airport company in early May 2014. In the termination notice, the company cited &quot;serious defects&quot; in his work and that trust in their relationship was &quot;now finally shattered&quot;. The airport company went on to state that Di Mauro&#x27;s plans would be &quot;disposed of&quot;. The system was to be rebuilt and divided into three areas in order to make it &quot;manageable&quot;. The cost of this work was reported as being a nine-digit figure.

Another major factor impacting on the construction of the airport was insolvency of general planner &quot;Planungsgemeinschaft Flughafen Berlin Brandenburg International&quot; (pg bbi) and the dismissal of the Gerkan, Marg and Partners architects. Inspectors have uncovered many examples of poor workmanship due to a lack of proper supervision and documentation, most notably concerning the wiring. Reports have surfaced about cable conduits that hold too many cables or hold cables in incompatible combinations, such as phone lines next to high voltage wires. A total of of cooling pipes were allegedly installed with no thermal insulation. To correct this, the demolition of numerous walls may be necessary. Furthermore, exterior vents appear to be in improper locations, allowing rainwater from the western facade to enter them.

=== Timeline ===
==== 2006 ====
After nearly 15 years of planning, actual construction work for Berlin Brandenburg Airport began on 5 September 2006. When construction began, FBB announced 30 October 2011 as the opening day for the new facility. To make way for the new airport, two villages were removed. The 335 inhabitants of Diepensee received compensation and were offered new homes in Königs Wusterhausen, a move that was completed by late 2004. The 35 villagers of Selchow were resettled to Großziethen in mid-2005.

==== 2007 ====
In November 2007, the &quot;BER-Infotower&quot; opened a public observation tower and information center. It was part of the airport&#x27;s visitor facilities, which also had a webcam of the construction progress. The transparent and twisted structure was originally intended to be temporary, with a scheduled removal announced in 2016.

==== 2008 ====
Construction of the terminal building began in July 2008.

Tempelhof Airport was officially closed on 30 October 2008.

==== 2010 ====

On 8 and 9 May 2010, the airport celebrated its topping out with open days at the airport site. A few days after 14 June 2010 topping out ceremony, FBB announced that construction deadlines could not be met.

==== 2011 ====
On 30 October 2011, the railway line and terminal station were ready for service, however no scheduled trains would operate until the opening.

Operating tests and service trials began on 24 November 2011, based on the anticipated opening date of 3 June 2012. A total of 12,000 volunteers participated in simulated check-in, security screening, boarding and baggage claim. The tests used 15,000 pieces of luggage in the automated baggage processing system, covered night-time operations and emergency scenarios. This phase also saw the acceptance tests of various airport systems. It became clear on 8 May 2012 that the building could not open on schedule, officially because of the failure of the fire protection system. In reality, according to a Brandenburg State Audit report in February 2016 the usability of the airport was at 56.2%; for example, there were no ticket counters and the escalators did not work. The report went on to say there was no realistic chance that it could be used &quot;reasonably successfully&quot; in 2012. Legal implications concerning the failed 2012 opening were expected after the release of the 2016 report.

==== 2012 ====
As the new date drew nearer, airlines amended their timetables to reflect their plans to operate from BER. On the retail side of the airport, shops and restaurants prepared for the opening. As the airports in Tegel and Schönefeld were to close once the last flights of 2 June had been serviced, a major logistics operation for moving the airports&#x27; infrastructure was launched. Vehicles, equipment and supplies that were needed at Tegel until the final moments would have been transported to BER during the night of 2–3 June. To allow this, the authorities planned to restrict the highways linking the two airports (A113, A100 and parts of A111) to airport traffic only. Rundfunk Berlin Brandenburg, the national broadcaster for Berlin and Brandenburg, scheduled 24 hours of continuous live coverage of the airport move. A special Lufthansa flight to Frankfurt Airport, operated with an Airbus A380, was scheduled as the first departure from the new airport on 3 June at 06:00.

On 8 May 2012 just 26 days before the move, FBB again postponed the opening date. The postponement led to the cancelling of moving plans and in some cases reversing actions already completed. It cited technical difficulties, primarily concerning the fire safety and smoke exhaust systems for the delay. As a result, FBB dismissed the director for technical affairs Manfred Körtgen and replaced him with Horst Amann. It also announced 17 March 2013 as the new opening date for BER. However, this was soon met by doubts resulting from the large number of construction flaws and problems that inspectors continued to find.

In early September 2012, FBB further postponed the opening to 27 October 2013. Again, media and experts (most notably Peter Ramsauer, Federal Minister for Construction and Infrastructure) voiced doubts about the deadline.

==== 2013 ====
FBB announced on 6 January 2013 that the opening would be further delayed, at least until 2014; however, no definite opening date was given. Klaus Wowereit resigned as chairman of the supervisory board and was replaced by Matthias Platzeck, who previously had served as his deputy. The board also dismissed Rainer Schwarz, the CEO of FBB, on 16 January. By January 2013, FBB had announced and cancelled four official opening dates. FBB named Hartmut Mehdorn, previously CEO of Deutsche Bahn (1999–2011) and Air Berlin (2011–2013) as Schwarz&#x27;s replacement on 8 March 2013.

The rising passenger numbers at Berlin airports and delays to BER raised concerns in 2013 that the new airport might be too small as passenger numbers at existing Berlin airports were approaching the BER design capacity.

==== 2014 ====
On 8 January 2014, FBB announced the airport would not open that year. Mehdorn stated on 24 February 2014 that it was unlikely the airport would open before 2016. In remarks made in August 2014, he pointed towards 2017 or 2018. Mehdorn announced no opening date by 14 October 2014, so a special commission established by the Brandenburg Parliament retained oversight of the project.

The initial design for the main hall, known as &quot;the monster&quot; to construction workers, called for a single exhaust system. Revised plans called for multiple systems controlled by of wiring. By 19 May 2014 Siemens had not yet designed the wire harnesses. These problems are forcing the initial construction budget to skyrocket.

BBI sought to open the north pier for use by three to ten flights per day as a test, though other parts of the airport would not be operational for some time. It requested that &quot;Technischer Überwachungsverein&quot; (Technical Inspection Association, TÜV) review the facility for safety and compliance to Brandenburg building codes. In its assessment report issued on 29 July 2014, TÜV found that some lightning rods were missing and that the back-up generator powering the sprinkler system did not provide adequate power. One source with the TÜV stated, &quot;What the airport ordered was sufficient for a circus tent, but [if power fails] not for the dimensions of the terminal.&quot; The exhaust system to remove smoke from a fire was also reported to be leaking.

Citing dissatisfaction with construction progress, members of the airport board indicated during their 8 December 2014 meeting that they were beginning the search for a new CEO, although Mehdorn&#x27;s contract ran through 2016. One week later, Mehdorn announced he would resign as soon as the board named a successor, but no later than June 2015. Karsten Mühlenfeld, former head of Rolls-Royce Germany, replaced him as airport CEO in March.

==== 2015 ====
The search for a general planner was eventually stopped in February 2015.

On 20 March 2015, Mehdorn again faced questions from the Investigative Commission of Berlin&#x27;s parliament. Mehdorn eventually ceased all public duties on 21 May 2015, citing health concerns. Berlin&#x27;s mayor Michael Müller was appointed the new head of the supervisory board (Aufsichtsrat) on 3 July 2015. However, he had disagreements with Mühlenfeld, primarily over the opening date. Led by Mayor Müller, the board insisted on an opening in 2017.

A former manager for BER was taken into remand for alleged bribery on 13 May 2015; an Imtech manager was alleged to have given him bribes at a highway gas station in 2012. Imtech built parts of the fire exhaustion system.

The German branch of (Dutch) Royal Imtech filed for bankruptcy on 6 August 2015, and its parent company went bankrupt a few days later. As a result, Martin Delius, leader of the commission of inquiry into the failures during the airport&#x27;s construction, stated that the planned opening in late 2017 was doubtful.

Also in August 2015, new allegations of corruption were published in the Bild newspaper. According to the paper, some large contractors filed additional payment demands after completion of their respective projects within BER, and received the complete requested payments with almost no objections. Lawyers reviewing the process stated that the high percentage of claims granted approval was unique and extraordinary. As a result, all payments beginning from the start of the project were to be reviewed. The projected opening in 2017 was declared unlikely around the same time. At the end of August 2015, though, the new airport head presented the Schüßler plan as the course of action. When Mehdorn testified before the Investigations Commission of the Berlin parliament in March 2015, he stated that redesigns to correct the exhaust system would not be completed until &quot;after the summer break,&quot; and that the terminal will not be finished until March or April 2016.

An immediate halt to all construction efforts in the terminal was ordered on 21 September 2015 because a collapse of the main roof was imminent. This was done according to Dahme-Spreewald district&#x27;s construction supervision. The shutdown lasted two weeks. Furthermore, 600 fire protection walls had to be replaced because they were built out of aerated concrete blocks that provided insufficient fire protection. The mortar was found to be inadequate as well.

==== 2016 ====
By 2016, further consequences of the low likelihood of a 2017 opening appeared on the horizon. Tegel&#x27;s permit was set to expire at the end of 2017; but if Tegel closed before BER opened, massive disruptions would occur because Tegel handled over 60% of all passenger traffic in Berlin. This led to expectations that pressure to open BER would mount drastically.

As of 7 February 2016, 24 opaque skylights (which can allow smoke to escape) in the main gangway required approval. The opaque skylights are part of the fire exhaustion system. FBB spokesman Daniel Abbou confirmed to Berliner Morgenpost that the 24 skylights may need &quot;individual approval&quot; rather than a blanket approval for all.

As of April 2016, the fire exhaustion system experienced further lapses that would delay a new issuing of the rework permission for the fire suppression system. The underground railway station also needed a redesign for the underground part of the fire exhaustion system. Incoming or departing trains might suck smoke into the station, so air flow guidance was needed to avoid this effect. However, the airport could not decide upon the method by itself, as permission is needed from the Federal Railway Authority (&quot;Eisenbahnbundesamt&quot;). The construction authority of the district of Dahme-Spreewald, Eisenbahnbundesamt, and the airport thus needed to join in the redesign effort. The plans on how to rebuild the underground part would not be finished before June. Thus, with no plans, the district could not grant the redesign permission. As such, the airport could not start the redesign effort before the beginning of July (assuming that the district would promptly check on the plans). As such, the construction process was delayed by at least 8 months. On 17 April 2016, it became clear that the district would conduct an intensive investigation into the construction plans. Airport head Mühlenfeld thus publicly demanded that the parties come to grips with their decision.

Also in April 2016, press spokesman Daniel Abbou was fired after giving &quot;too honest&quot; an interview. He had stated that billions of euros had been squandered, and that only someone &quot;dependent on medication will give you any firm guarantees for this airport.&quot; On 25 April 2016, Mühlenfeld stated that &quot;surprisingly, demands (towards a simulation of the problem) are higher than expected.&quot; In fact, the Federal Railway Authority demanded that the commuter trains be simulated at speeds up to when entering or leaving the station. This means it would take more time to simulate the exact solution for the underground railway station. The Federal Railway Authority also called for the simulation of emergency/evacuation scenarios. To prevent suffocation in an emergency, glass towers are to be built inside the railway station that connect to openings in the roof, which will provide fresh air. Mold seems to be persistent, the railway station is already ventilated from time to time by mobile fans.

By May 2016, it had become clear that an expedited approval of the underground station would not happen. Because of this, the timetable for opening had to be pushed back to at least 2018. Specifically, the airport was unable to conform to the fifth appendix for the construction permission, therefore it was declined. The airport found it disappointing that there was no quick approval of the underground redesign efforts as of 10 June. Instead, the authority stated that a filing for the fifth appendix was incomplete and insufficient. The vice district administrator for Dahme-Spreewald, Chris Halecker, decried political pressure from the airport.

On 23 August 2016, a former FBB department head admitted in court to taking €150,000 in bribes from Imtech, on a parking lot next to a highway in 2012. At the end of August 2016 it was announced that the airport had missed an internal deadline, and that the permissions for the next phase of construction could not be issued. This was because the fire protection system for the connection between the airport and railway station lacked sufficient documentation. These conditions were met on 6 October 2016. The conditions for the final construction approval would only be met on 27 January 2017.

The project management missed a 7 October 2016 deadline to announce a definite opening date for the airport. In October 2016, traffic commission chairman Burkert declared that an opening in 2017 was impossible. An 11 October 2016 committee session found that motors used to open and close windows would not operate above , necessitating their replacement. Three thousand smoke detectors went missing, but were later found. Technical issues involving the electric doors became public on 18 January 2017. It was discovered that 80% of the doors would not open, which created concerns around venting of smoke in a fire. The sprinkler system had sustained failures in the south pier. The sprinkler heads were replaced for increased water flow, but the pipes were too thin to carry it; as a result the ceiling needed to be opened for the pipes to be replaced. The new low-cost terminal T2 will possibly be delayed until after 2020. It was revealed in a newspaper report that the airport could not open before 2018, and that this had been known by the airport for three years despite public statements otherwise.

The main construction permit (that is, the permission of the authority of Berlin issues to construction firms) was destined to expire. This would mean all construction work would have to terminate on 23 November 2016. A new law, referred to as a &quot;Lex BER&quot;, extended the construction permission for ongoing projects.

By the end of 2016, unfinished construction and corrective work indicated clearly that an opening prior to late 2017 was unlikely. In December 2016, Mühlenfeld hinted at a possible 2018 opening; Ryanair marketing head Kenny Jacobs suggested March 2018.

==== 2017 ====
In January 2017, it became clear that the airport would not open in 2017, with some estimates suggesting that the airport would open in 2018 or 2019, at the latest. On 6 March 2017, Lütke-Daldrup was appointed to replace Mühlenfeld as the head of the construction project and Rainer Bretschneider was appointed head of the supervisory board. The target opening was pushed to 2018 or 2019, with 2020 as a possible option. In Aug 2017 the Berliner Zeitung reported that the airport&#x27;s remaining funds would run out in 2018.

As of May 2017, estimates suggested the airport could open in late 2018 or early 2019, but an opening in 2020 was not ruled out. The opening date of 2019 had already been described as ambitious and even the new opening date of 2020 was called into question. On 23 November 2017, exactly 2,000 days after the originally planned opening date in 2012, a &quot;TÜV&quot; report listed additional deficits. It is possible that the new deficits will cause an additional delay of up to two years, with an opening in 2021. At the end of 2017, autumn 2020 was announced as the new official opening date.

The recent bankruptcy of Air Berlin was another problem for the airport. With Air Berlin absent it became even clearer that the airport would not become a major hub. The number of connections a person can catch would be immediately reduced and Tegel was too far away to be any help in this regard. Interested citizens forced a non-binding public quorum that was held parallel to the federal election, asking whether Tegel should remain open if BER was already in operation. The majority of Berlin&#x27;s citizens agreed.

In November 2017, an audit of the entire airport by Germany&#x27;s technical supervision service TÜV uncovered more significant lapses in the fire and emergency systems, further pushing back estimates.

==== 2018 ====
In January 2018, it was disclosed that the airport head is simultaneously earning a monthly wage and a retirement pension as a former state secretary of the state of Berlin, a situation described as a &quot;scandal&quot; and potentially illegal. The airport was scheduled to open in 2020 with a total cost exceeding €7 billion. The airport chief executive gave his assurance that the date would be met.

In March, it was reported that 750 display screens have already reached the end of their service life and will need to be replaced, as they were switched on for 6 years despite the airport not being open.

Planned extensions of the airport were also seen as a threat to opening in 2020, according to the airport&#x27;s engineering advisor Faulenbach da Costa. More people than previously expected would be moving through the main terminal, causing an increase in fire emergency load, with even more passengers arriving through the railway station in the basement. Thus smoke systems would need to be adjusted once again. Lufthansa board member said &quot;the airport will be torn down and rebuilt.&quot;

Personnel changes continued to affect the project, with the head of the technical department Jörg Marks leaving the company on 19 April 2018, and Brandenburg&#x27;s state secretary for airport affairs Rainer Bretschneider going into retirement in June.

The airport failed a mandatory TÜV acceptance test in May 2018, with 863 issues found in the electric wiring. Wiring remained a major issue in 2018. The all-around test was planned to commence sometime in September 2018 but it was postponed to June 2019 because the wiring was still flawed. Also in May 2018, Siemens, the software supplier for the smoke suction system, testified before Berlin&#x27;s senate&#x27;s airport commission stating that the airport had not yet delivered essential paperwork required for them to complete the suction software. In the same month the airport faced new legal issues as concerned citizens claimed that the aeroplane noise caused by the new airport would violate their rights to be heard. A few months later Germany&#x27;s supreme court ruled that nighttime flights over BER are lawful.

In June Berlin&#x27;s assembly formed a new committee of inquiry to uncover responsibility for ongoing construction lapses and to investigate possible sources of further delay. The still-unopened airport announced plans to expand with a second terminal in July, with construction to be done by Zechbau Bremen for a total cost of €200 million.

==== 2019 ====
It was reported at the start of January 2019 that the construction oversight authority was unwilling to permit the Terminal&#x27;s wiring as is, because it was too tangled.

Berlin&#x27;s Tagesspiegel reported that Bosch (fire detection) and Caverion (sprinklers) were unwilling to participate in a hearing of Berlin&#x27;s parliament on 14 March 2019. It was then assumed that the airport would not open until 2020. The fire protection malfunction seems to be too significant to keep 2020 as an opening date.

On 28 March 2019, it was reported that a software update for the fire alarm system planned to be ready by 29 March would be delayed until late May. TÜV Rheinland warned that there were still considerable problems with the system, and stated that if there were any further delays the October 2020 opening date would be missed. On 16 April 2019, the smoke suction system nicknamed &quot;the Monster&quot; finally received approval from TÜV, afterwards by an expert representing the State.

In May 2019, it was reported that sand-lime brick used in the foundations of the airport were not sufficiently rated for load, necessitating a costly replacement of much of the underground cabling and reinforced concrete beams. According to a subsequent investigation the problem had been known since 2012. The problematic plastic anchors that were earlier found to be unsuitable for fire were also found not suitable for sand-lime brick. As stated by Deutsches Institut für Bautechnik, it is not possible to approve already-installed anchors after the fact. Later in May the head of the airport Lütke-Daldrup stated that &quot;it cannot be guaranteed entirely anymore&quot; that the airport will open in October 2020. Unapproved screw anchors made of plastic not rated for fire seem to have been the reason for the new delay.

Problems with the cable duct were also known since 2012: of cable needed to be replaced because water was flowing within the cable ducts next to the southern runway. The ducts were not leakproof and had eroded in the decade since they were first installed. The repairs were scheduled to start later in 2019. According to airport head Lütke-Daldrup, the planned opening date of October 2020 was not affected by the cable duct problem, as the repairs could continue while the airport was in operation. German minister of traffic Mr Scheuer however reiterated his concerns that the sand lime brick and cable duct issues could delay the opening beyond 2020. Conservative party member Graeff stated that if the airport continued to see these kinds of delays, then officials should go ahead and start planning construction of a new airport in a different location.

The head of the expansion facility management cancelled his contract at the end of June 2019 for unspecified personal reasons. The construction progress at the T2 site remained slow, but the topping out of T2 finally took place on 30 July. Final equipment tests took place at the airport over the summer of 2019; with the first tests appearing to have been successful.

On 31 July 2019, construction work at terminal T2 was finished in a record time of only 10 months. Initially planned to cost €200 million, the exploding cost of Berlin Brandenburg Airport as a whole made it necessary to reduce standards and cut the cost of T2 by 50%, to no more than €100 million. The attempts to reduce costs were unsuccessful, as criticised in a report to the supervisory board. Nonetheless, Lütke-Daldrup took the timely completion of terminal T2 as a sign that the problems at BER were coming to an end. Lütke-Daldrup said that he was hopeful that the airport could open as soon as August 2020, two months earlier than currently scheduled. In late July 2019, Lütke-Daldrup stated that, of the more than 11,000 shortcomings reported in March 2019, over 70% had been resolved, including several hundred problems of high priority that would preclude the start of the final TÜV rehearsal. On 1 August 2019 a several-month TÜV rehearsal of BER&#x27;s technical facilities began, marking the first time that all airport systems have been tested simultaneously.

Renewed checks at T2 yielded serious construction lapses, though. The concrete foundation needed to be partly rebuilt to accommodate technical systems, with issues in the wiring arrangement and the ability to withstand sustained usage and heat.

It was also announced that a third terminal is planned to be erected by 2029 and that €174 m for payments to advisors was not listed in the balance sheets for 2018. Brandenburg&#x27;s radio station reported that certain tests that were delayed anew at the end of 2019 were what put the opening date of 2020 into doubt again.

==== 2020 ====
In January 2020, union strikes threatened to further delay opening. The union has been fighting for a general working payment to limit competition among ground personnel. By mid-February, the planned opening continued to be doubted upon because 5,000 issues still required rectification and certification by an external inspection company (TÜV) in order to complete construction by the end of the first quarter of 2020. These issues were seen as &quot;grave&quot;, meaning that any of them could have caused the inspection company to halt operation. , 1,000 lapses were still unresolved, 3,300 were being checked by TÜV, and 700 proposed solutions had already been rejected. About 70 issues, including the problem of unapproved screw anchors, still lacked the proper documentation to start working on a solution. Those issues threatened to delay the start of test operations that were scheduled for April 2020. The screw anchor problem was resolved in March.

In early 2020, the airport successfully commenced a volunteer-driven test run of its main functions, including processing at ticket counters. After TÜV approved the emergency and safety systems, the airport received final authority approval on 28 April 2020. Construction work officially ended on 15 May 2020.

Christoph Schaefer was set to become new technical head as a successor to Carsten Wilmsen. However, financial difficulties caused Schaefer&#x27;s position to remain vacant. It was also reported that the airport operations company FBB was in imminent financial trouble due to the construction issues and delays as well as the COVID-19 pandemic.

The airport finally received its operating licence in May 2020, allowing an opening date to be set. The local and aviation authorities then gave final approval for the airport to open on 31 October 2020. Plans to bring forward the closure of Tegel to June 2020 in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic were shelved for an estimated lack of capacity at Schönefeld&#x27;s old facilities.

From August 2020, the procedure to move all equipment from both current airports to their new facilities commenced.

On 15 October 2020, all test runs of the airport&#x27;s passenger facilities and procedures, which included thousands of volunteers since spring, concluded successfully after being slightly delayed by the COVID-19 pandemic.

After Schönefeld&#x27;s facilities formally became Terminal 5 of BER ahead on 25 October 2020, all airlines moved from Tegel to BER between 31 October and 8 November 2020. The first flight to land at the new airport was an easyJet special service from Tegel on 31 October 2020, followed shortly after by a Lufthansa special service from Munich. Lufthansa applied a special &quot;Hauptstadtflieger&quot; (&quot;capital city flyer&quot;) sticker to the aircraft in celebration of the flight. The first departure from the new Terminal 1 was a flight to London–Heathrow on 1 November 2020.

==Controversies==
In September 2010, Deutsche Flugsicherung published aircraft arrival and departure routes for Berlin Brandenburg Airport which significantly differ from earlier ones used in the court decision for the construction permit. In the original maps, aircraft were expected to take off and land in a path parallel with the runway. The new plans saw flight paths that deviate from the runway direction by 15 degrees. Therefore, aircraft would now fly over areas in southern Berlin (Lichtenrade, Steglitz and Zehlendorf) and adjacent Brandenburg (Teltow, Stahnsdorf, Kleinmachnow and Potsdam) to the surprise of local residents. This prompted a wave of protests and a lawsuit that the courts rejected.

Both the expansion of Schönefeld Airport into BER and the quality of the connection to the railway network are the subject of public debate. The &quot;Bürgerverein Brandenburg-Berlin e.V.&quot; represents local residents who protest an expansion of air traffic to and from the south of Berlin. Also, traffic and environmental experts criticise the late completion dates for the fast connection to the Berlin Hauptbahnhof. Still, Berlin Hauptbahnhof will be only a 30-minute journey with trains departing every 15 minutes upon inauguration. At the time of the originally planned opening date of BER, in 2011, this was expected to be reduced to 20 minutes after reconstruction of the Berlin section of the Berlin–Dresden railway, which was planned to be finished by 2020. However, delays in both the BER construction and the construction of the railway meant that the travel time will be 30 minutes until at least 2025.

In 2015, a whistleblower alleged that Imtech, which filed for bankruptcy in 2015, had bribed airport officials to receive inflated payments for their work. Prosecutors in Brandenburg launched a probe into the allegations. In May 2016, it emerged that the whistleblower had been poisoned with a &quot;deadly substance&quot; but survived after a three-month period of illness.

<text>Jacob Baradaeus (; ; ; ), also known as Jacob bar Addai or Jacob bar Theophilus, was the Bishop of Edessa from 543/544 until his death in 578. He is venerated as a saint in the Oriental Orthodox Churches and his feast day is 31 July. Jacob&#x27;s missionary efforts helped establish the non-Chalcedonian Syriac Orthodox Church, also known as the &quot;Jacobite&quot; Church after its eponymous leader, and ensured its survival despite persecution.

==Background==
Following the Council of Chalcedon in 451, the church in the Eastern Roman Empire suffered division between Chalcedonians, supporters of the council, and non-Chalcedonians, also known as miaphysites and pejoratively called monophysites, who opposed the council. Non-Chalcedonians lost political support at the ascension of Emperor Justin I in 518, who subsequently persecuted non-Chalcedonians. Consequentially, the number of non-Chalcedonian religious leaders declined and, despite the widespread support they held in Syria, Armenia, and Egypt, non-Chalcedonianism faced extinction.

==Biography==
Jacob was born in c. 500 in the city of Tall Mawzalt, and was the son of Theophilus bar Manu, a priest. At the age of two, Jacob was left in the care of Eustathius, Abbot of the Monastery of Fsilta, and studied Greek, Syriac, and religious and theological texts. Jacob&#x27;s mother later returned to the monastery and attempted to bring him home, however, Jacob refused to return and declared his dedication to Christ. After his parents&#x27; death, Jacob donated his inheritance to the poor and manumitted several slaves he had inherited, to whom he bestowed his parents&#x27; house. Later, Jacob was ordained a deacon and priest at the monastery. At this time, Jacob became renowned as a miracle-worker and people came to him seeking healing. Several miracles are attributed to Jacob, such as the resurrection of the dead, the healing of the blind, procurement of rain, and stopping the movement of the sun. He is also reputed to have ended the Siege of Edessa as Khosrow I was afflicted with a vision and abandoned the siege.

Empress Theodora, a non-Chalcedonian, learned of Jacob and invited him to meet with her at Constantinople, however, he was reluctant to do so. In a vision, Jacob was instructed to travel to Constantinople, and thus, in c. 527, he arrived at the capital. Theodora received Jacob with honour, however, he was uninterested in life at court, and entered the Monastery of Sykai, where he remained for 15 years. Whilst at Constantinople, he gained the favour of Theodora and Al-Harith ibn Jabalah, King of the Ghassanids, both fellow non-Chalcedonians. An outbreak of persecution of non-Chalcedonians carried out by Ephraim, Patriarch of Antioch, spurred Empress Theodora and Al-Harith to urge Pope Theodosius I of Alexandria to consecrate bishops to counter Ephraim and ensure the survival of non-Chalcedonianism. Thus, Jacob was consecrated Bishop of Edessa by Pope Theodosius in Constantinople in 543/544.

After his episcopal appointment, Jacob travelled to Alexandria, where he, with two non-Chalcedonian bishops, consecrated Conon as Bishop of Tarsus and Eugenius as Bishop of Seleucia. He then set about consecrating non-Chalcedonian clergymen throughout Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt. At this time, through his missionary work, Jacob aimed to restore non-Chalcedonianism as the official position of the church in the Eastern Roman Empire. The Roman government attempted to hinder the non-Chalcedonian revival and imprison Jacob, however, in his travels he wore a disguise and thus became known as &quot;Burde&#x27;ana&quot;, &quot;man in ragged clothes&quot;, from which the sobriquet &quot;Baradaeus&quot; is derived. Jacob ordained Sergius bar Karya as Bishop of Harran and Sergius of Tella as Patriarch of Antioch in 544. After Sergius of Tella&#x27;s death in 547, with Eugenius, Jacob ordained Paul as Patriarch of Antioch in 550. Differences between Jacob and Eugenius and Conon later emerged and Jacob anathematised the pair for their adherence to Tritheism, and they anathematised Jacob on the accusation of adherence to Sabellianism.

In 553, Emperor Justinian I convened the Second Council of Constantinople in an attempt to unite Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians. However, the council was unconvincing to Syrian non-Chalcedonians, and Jacob began to form a separate, non-Chalcedonian church, that would later become the Syriac Orthodox Church. Jacob ordained John of Ephesus as Bishop of Ephesus in 558. In 559, Jacob consecrated Ahudemmeh as Metropolitan of the East. In 566, Jacob attended discussions held by Emperor Justin II at Constantinople between Chalcedonians and non-Chalcedonians with the goal of a compromise between the two factions. At the end of the discussions in 567, Justin issued an edict which was agreed upon by all who attended, however, the edict was rejected by a non-Chalcedonian council at Raqqa. Later, in 571, Jacob Baradaeus and other non-Chalcedonian bishops gave their approval to an edict of union with the Chalcedonian church as they both agreed they held the same beliefs but expressed them differently. Jacob and the other bishops subsequently accepted communion from John Scholasticus, Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople. This angered many non-Chalcedonians, however, and the bishops withdrew their approval of the edict.

Unbeknownst to Jacob, Paul, Patriarch of Antioch, and several other non-Chalcedonian bishops, had been tortured by the Roman government and unwillingly agreed to adhere to Chalcedonianism. Jacob consequentially forbade Paul from receiving communion and Paul took refuge in the Kingdom of the Ghassanids. Three years later, Paul was brought before a non-Chalcedonian synod and Jacob restored him to communion for his penance. This angered Egyptian non-Chalcedonians, and, in 576, Pope Peter IV of Alexandria deposed Paul as Patriarch of Antioch, contrary to canon law. Jacob denounced Peter. However, in an effort to reunite non-Chalcedonians, he travelled to Alexandria and agreed to give his assent to Paul&#x27;s deposition on the condition that he was not excommunicated, thus restoring good relations between the Syrian and Egyptian non-Chalcedonians. Nevertheless, on Jacob&#x27;s return to Syria, many Syrian non-Chalcedonians expressed anger at the compromise and violence erupted between Jacob and Paul&#x27;s supporters. King Al-Mundhir III ibn al-Harith, Al-Harith&#x27;s successor, and Paul attempted to discuss the conflict with Jacob, however, he refused to seek another compromise.

Jacob, with several other bishops, abruptly left Syria with the intention of travelling to Alexandria. Whilst en route, Jacob and his group stopped at the Monastery of St. Romanus in Maiuma where they became ill and Jacob died on 30 July 578. According to Cyriacus, Bishop of Mardin, Jacob&#x27;s remains were kept at the Monastery of St. Romanus until moved to the Monastery of Fsilta in 622. Some historians note the name of the monastery as the Monastery of Cassian.

<text>An off-by-one error or off-by-one bug (known by acronyms OBOE, OBO, OB1 and OBOB) is a logic error that involves a number that differs from its intended value by 1. An off-by-one error can sometimes appear in a mathematical context. It often occurs in computer programming when a loop iterates one time too many or too few, usually caused by the use of non-strict inequality (≤) as the terminating condition where strict inequality (&lt;) should have been used, or vice versa. Off-by-one errors also stem from confusion over zero-based numbering.

==Cases==
===Looping over arrays===
Consider an array of items, and items &quot;m&quot; through &quot;n&quot; (inclusive) are to be processed. How many items are there? An intuitive answer may be , but that is off by one, exhibiting a fencepost error; the correct answer is .

For this reason, ranges in computing are often represented by half-open intervals; the range from &quot;m&quot; to &quot;n&quot; (inclusive) is represented by the range from &quot;m&quot; (inclusive) to (exclusive) to avoid fencepost errors. For example, a loop that iterates five times (from 0 to 4 inclusive) can be written as a half-open interval from 0 to 5:
for (index = 0; index &lt; 5; index++) 
 /* Body of the loop */


The loop body is executed first of all with equal to 0; then becomes 1, 2, 3, and finally 4 on successive iterations. At that point, becomes 5, so is false and the loop ends. However, if the comparison used were &lt;= (less than or equal to), the loop would be carried out six times: takes the values 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Likewise, if were initialized to 1 rather than 0, there would only be four iterations: takes the values 1, 2, 3, and 4. Both of these alternatives can cause off-by-one errors.

Another such error can occur if a do-while loop is used in place of a while loop (or vice versa.) A do-while loop is guaranteed to run at least once.

Array-related confusion may also result from differences in programming languages. Numbering from 0 is most common, but some languages start array numbering with 1. Pascal has arrays with user-defined indices. This makes it possible to model the array indices after the problem domain.

===Fencepost error===
A fencepost error (occasionally called a telegraph pole, lamp-post, or picket fence error) is a specific type of off-by-one error. An early description of this error appears in the works of Vitruvius. The following problem illustrates the error:


The common answer of 10 posts is wrong. This response comes from dividing the length of the fence by the spacing apart from each post, with the quotient being erroneously classified as the number of posts. In actuality, the fence has 10 sections and 11 posts.

In this scenario, a fence with &quot;n&quot; sections will have posts. Conversely, if the fence contains &quot;n&quot; posts, it will contain sections. This relationship is important to consider when dealing with the reverse error. The reverse error occurs when the number of posts is known and the number of sections is assumed to be the same. Depending on the design of the fence, this assumption can be correct or incorrect.

The following problem demonstrates the reverse error:

The interpretation for the fence&#x27;s design changes the answer to this problem. The correct number of sections for a fence is if the fence is a free-standing line segment bounded by a post at each of its ends (e.g., a fence between two passageway gaps), &quot;n&quot; if the fence forms one complete, free-standing loop (e.g., enclosure accessible by surmounting, such as a boxing ring), or if posts do not occur at the ends of a line-segment-like fence (e.g., a fence between and wall-anchored to two buildings). The precise problem definition must be carefully considered, as the setup for one situation may give the wrong answer for other situations.

Fencepost errors can also occur in units other than length. For example, the Time Pyramid, consisting of 120 blocks placed at 10-year intervals between blocks, is scheduled to take 1,190 years to build (not 1,200), from the installation of the first block to the last block. One of the earliest fencepost errors involved time, where the Julian calendar originally calculated leap years incorrectly, due to counting inclusively rather than exclusively, yielding a leap year every three years rather than every four.

In larger numbers, being off by one is often not a major issue. In smaller numbers, however, and specific cases where accuracy is paramount, committing an off-by-one error can be disastrous. Sometimes such an issue will also be repeated and, therefore, worsened, by someone passing on an incorrect calculation, if the following person makes the same kind of mistake again (of course, the error might also be reversed).

An example of this error can occur in the computational language MATLAB with the codice_1 linear interpolation function, whose parameters are codice_2 and not codice_3. A programmer who misunderstands the third parameter to be the number of increments might hope that codice_4 would achieve a sequence but instead would get .

=== Security implications ===
A common off-by-one error which results in a security-related bug is caused by misuse of the C standard library codice_5 routine. A common misconception with codice_6 is that the guaranteed null termination will not write beyond the maximum length. In reality it will write a terminating null character one byte beyond the maximum length specified. The following code contains such a bug:
void foo (char *s) 
 char buf[15];
 memset(buf, 0, sizeof(buf));
 strncat(buf, s, sizeof(buf)); // Final parameter should be: sizeof(buf)-1


Off-by-one errors are common in using the C library because it is not consistent with respect to whether one needs to subtract 1 byte – functions like codice_7 and codice_8 will never write past the length given them (codice_7 subtracts 1 itself, and only retrieves bytes), whereas others, like codice_6 will write past the length given them. So the programmer has to remember for which functions they need to subtract 1.

On some systems (little endian architectures in particular) this can result in the overwriting of the least significant byte of the frame pointer. This can cause an exploitable condition where an attacker can hijack the local variables for the calling routine.

One approach that often helps avoid such problems is to use variants of these functions that calculate how much to write based on the total length of the buffer, rather than the maximum number of characters to write. Such functions include codice_11 and codice_12, and are often considered &quot;safer&quot; because they make it easier to avoid accidentally writing past the end of a buffer. (In the code example above, calling codice_13 instead would remove the bug.)

<text>Quarrendon or Quarrendon Leas is a medieval English village near Aylesbury in Buckinghamshire, England, which has been depopulated since the 16th century and is now a scheduled monument.

==Description==
Quarrendon&#x27;s site is now a large area of fields and riverside meadows that provide green space between Meadowcroft and Central on the outskirts of the town of Aylesbury. Visible in these fields and meadows are the remains of a medieval village, a church, a manor house and its moat and a Tudor water garden. These historic features are now nationally-protected as a scheduled monument. The area also has wildlife value with a mixture of habitats and the River Thame forming the southern boundary of the site.

==The deserted village==
The layout of the village of Quarrendon in the late middle ages is preserved among the earthworks which can be seen in the area today. At this time the village consisted of farmsteads which were clustered around irregularly shaped greens, linked to each other, to their fields and to Aylesbury by sunken roadways. This village had developed over a long period, centuries, during which time the layout and social structure may have changed. The earthworks which form the visible remains are important but below these there are probably more remnants and artefacts which could be excavated by archaeologists in the future. There are also areas that were significant to the village which are outside the boundaries of the scheduled monument, these areas should also be under appropriate management. An example is that of a field containing ridge-and-furrow, which is an indicator of a medieval open field system of farming situated between the scheduled monument and Quarrendon House Farm.

There are two deserted village sites which are considered to both belong a single medieval settlement which shifted, during the medieval period, from a less suitable location. The smaller of the two sites is west of the ruined building of Church Farm and consists of some platforms used to build houses on and a trackway which runs from east to west across the pasture. On the western edge of the pasture is a considerable flat area crossed by a wide street, this may represent pens and a drove way. The second village site is to the east of the smaller site and it is thought that the villagers of the original settlement shifted to this site. The village was probably abandoned around 1485. The layout of streets and houses is clearly represented by the visible earthworks and show a village which covers with the streets and crofts radiating out from a pond with a mill and a sunken main street, which runs westwards from the village up the hill to the manor. The ruins of a small 13th-century church, St Peters Chapel can also be made out

==The Tudor manor and water gardens==
Henry VII confiscated the lands around Quarrendon from the Earl of Warwick in 1499 and a Crown lease of Quarrendon was granted to Richard Lee. Sir Robert Lee, Sheriff of Buckinghamshire, was Richard Lee&#x27;s son, and he had a new moated house and garden built on the site, the moat survives and is still partially flooded. Sir Robert&#x27;s grandson, Sir Henry Lee created an elaborate series of gardens delineated by canals and banks after he inherited Quarrendon in 1549. Sir Henry replaced parts of the deserted medieval village with an elaborate rabbit warren as well as a grand water garden with elevated embanked walkways. After Sir Henry died in 1611 Quarrendon declined and the mansion was replaced by a farm.

==Earthwork==
The Royalist forces in the Battle of Aylesbury on 1 November 1642 used an earthwork in the area of Quarrendon.

<doc id="271749" wikidata="Q3495306" url="?curid=271749" title="St Trinian's School">
<text>St Trinian&#x27;s is a British gag cartoon comic strip series, created and drawn by Ronald Searle from 1946 until 1952. The cartoons all centre on a boarding school for girls, where the teachers are sadists and the girls are juvenile delinquents. The series was Searle&#x27;s most famous work and inspired a popular series of comedy films.

==Concept==
Searle published his first St Trinian&#x27;s School cartoon in 1941 in the magazine &quot;Lilliput&quot;. He was captured at Singapore in 1942 and spent the rest of the Second World War as a prisoner of the Japanese. After the war, in 1946 Searle started making new cartoons about the girls, but the content was much darker compared to the earlier years.

The school is the antithesis of the type of posh girls&#x27; boarding school depicted by Enid Blyton or Angela Brazil; its female pupils are bad and often well armed, and mayhem is rife. The schoolmistresses are also disreputable. Cartoons often showed dead bodies of girls who had been murdered with pitchforks or succumbed to violent team sports, sometimes with vultures circling; girls drank, gambled and smoked. It is reputed that the gymslip style of dress worn by the girls was closely modelled on the school uniform of James Allen&#x27;s Girls&#x27; School (JAGS) in Dulwich, which Searle&#x27;s daughter Kate attended.

In the 1950s, films were developed that were based on the cartoon series. These comedies implied that the girls at the school were the daughters of dubious characters, such as gangsters, crooks, and shady bookmakers. The institution is often referred to as a &quot;female borstal&quot;, as if it were a reform school.

==The inspiration==

During 1941 Searle had gone to the artists&#x27; community in the village of Kirkcudbright. Whilst visiting the family Johnston, he made a drawing to please their two schoolgirl daughters, Cécilé and Pat, (their school had been evacuated to New Gala House in Galashiels in the Scottish Borders owing to the war). Searle was puzzled as to why two schoolgirls should seem so keen to return to their school, an Academy for Young Ladies in Dalkeith Road known as St Trinnean&#x27;s. The school was of the experimental sort, and allowed its pupils a certain degree of freedom and autonomy in their own educational choices. The school&#x27;s original building is now part of the University of Edinburgh.

Searle&#x27;s St Trinian&#x27;s was based on two private girls&#x27; schools in Cambridge – Perse School for Girls, now known as the co-educational Stephen Perse Foundation, and St Mary&#x27;s School for girls, a Catholic school established by the Sisters of Mary Ward. Growing up in Cambridge, Searle regularly saw the girls on their way to and from school; they originally inspired his cartoons and characters. The Perse School for Girls&#x27; Archive area holds several original St Trinian&#x27;s books, given to the school by Ronald Searle. He also based the school partly on the former Cambridgeshire High School for Girls (now Long Road Sixth Form College).

During his BBC interview Searle agreed that the cruelty depicted at St Trinian&#x27;s derived partly from his captivity during World War II but stressed that he included it only because the ignoble aspect to warfare in general had become more widely known.

==Books==
* &quot;Hurrah for St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1948)
* &quot;The Female Approach&quot; (1950)
* &quot;Back to the Slaughterhouse&quot; (1952)
* &quot;The Terror of St Trinians&quot; or &quot;Angela&#x27;s Prince Charming&quot; (1952; text by Timothy Shy, pen-name for D. B. Wyndham Lewis)
* &quot;Souls in Torment&quot; (1953)

==Film adaptations==
In the 1950s, a series of &quot;St Trinian&quot;″s comedy films were made, featuring well-known British actors, including Alastair Sim (in drag as the headmistress, and also playing her brother); George Cole as spiv &quot;Flash Harry&quot;, Joyce Grenfell as Sgt Ruby Gates, a beleaguered policewoman; and Richard Wattis and Eric Barker as the civil servants at the Ministry of Education for whom the school is a source of constant frustration and nervous breakdowns. Searle&#x27;s cartoons appeared in the films&#x27; main title design.

In the films the school became embroiled in various shady enterprises, thanks mainly to Flash, and, as a result, was always threatened with closure by the Ministry. (In the last of the original four, this became the &quot;Ministry of Schools&quot;, possibly because of fears of a libel action from a real Minister of Education.) The first four films form a chronological quartet, and were produced by Frank Launder and Sidney Gilliat. They had earlier produced &quot;The Happiest Days of Your Life&quot; (1950), a stylistically similar school comedy, starring Alastair Sim, Joyce Grenfell, George Cole, Richard Wattis, Guy Middleton, and Bernadette O&#x27;Farrell, all of whom later appeared in the St Trinian&#x27;s series, often playing similar characters.

Barchester and Barset were used as names for the fictional towns near which St Trinian&#x27;s School was supposedly located in the original films. In &quot;Blue Murder at St Trinian&#x27;s&quot;, a signpost was marked as 2 miles to Barset, 8 miles to Wantage, indicating a location in what was Berkshire at the time of filming (transferred to Oxfordshire in 1974).

St Trinian&#x27;s is depicted as an unorthodox girls&#x27; school where the younger girls wreak havoc and the older girls express their femininity overtly, turning their shapeless schoolgirl dress into something sexy and risqué by the standards of the times. St Trinian&#x27;s is often invoked in discussions about groups of schoolgirls running amok.

The St Trinian&#x27;s girls themselves come in two categories: the Fourth Form, most closely resembling Searle&#x27;s original drawings of ink-stained, ungovernable pranksters, and the much older Sixth Form, sexually precocious to a degree that may have seemed alarming to some in 1954.

In the films, the Fourth Form includes a number of much younger girls who are the most ferocious of them all. It is something of a rule of thumb that the smaller a St Trinian&#x27;s is, the more dangerous she is—especially when armed, most commonly with a lacrosse or hockey stick—though none of them can ever be considered harmless.

In the first two films, St Trinian&#x27;s is presided over by the genial Miss Millicent Fritton (Sim in drag), whose philosophy is summed up as: &quot;In other schools girls are sent out quite unprepared into a merciless world, but when our girls leave here, it is the merciless world which has to be prepared.&quot; Later other headmistresses included Dora Bryan in &quot;The Great St Trinian&#x27;s Train Robbery&quot;.

In December 2007, a new film, &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s&quot;, was released. The cast included Rupert Everett, Colin Firth, Russell Brand, Lily Cole, Talulah Riley, Stephen Fry, and Gemma Arterton. Reviews were mixed. A second new St Trinian&#x27;s film, &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s 2: The Legend of Fritton&#x27;s Gold&quot;, was released in 2009.

===Coat of arms===
The school&#x27;s coat of arms was originally shown as a black skull-and-crossbones on a field of white. This was later changed to a white tau cross (symbolising the &quot;T&quot; in Trinian&#x27;s) on a black field bordered white.

===School motto===
The school has no fixed motto but has had several suggested ones. The school&#x27;s motto is depicted in the original movies from the 1950s and 1960s as &quot;In flagrante delicto&quot; (&quot;Caught in the Act&quot;). This can be seen on the trophy shelf, above the stairs in &quot;The Belles of St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (1954). The lyrics of the original theme song by Sidney Gilliat (c. 1954) imply that the school&#x27;s motto is &quot;Get your blow in first&quot; (&quot;Semper debeatis percutis ictu primo&quot;).

A poem in one of Searle&#x27;s books called &quot;St Trinian&#x27;s Soccer Song&quot;, by D. B. Wyndham Lewis and Johnny Dankworth, states that the motto is &quot;Floreat St Trinian&#x27;s&quot; (&quot;May St Trinian&#x27;s Bloom/Flourish&quot;), a reference to the motto of Eton (&quot;Floreat Etona&quot;—&quot;May Eton Flourish&quot;).

===School songs===
The musical score for the St Trinian films was written by Malcolm Arnold and included the school song, with words accredited to Sidney Gilliat (1954). In the 2007 film, a new school song, written by Girls Aloud, was called &quot;Defenders of Anarchy&quot;. The school also has a fight song.

==In popular culture==

* Between 1968 and 1972, the British comic-book &quot;The Beano&quot; ran a series entitled &quot;The Belles of St. Lemons&quot;, which was inspired by the original St Trinian&#x27;s cartoons by Ronald Searle.
* The gauge 0 model train manufacturer ACE Trains produce an &quot;unorthodox&quot; model of a British Schools Class steam locomotive (which were named after British schools), numbered 1922 and named &quot;St Trinneans&quot; (sic). This model is bright pink and has a pair of uniformed schoolgirls as driver and fireman.
* In 1990, Chris Claremont and Ron Wagner paid tribute to both Searle and St Trinian&#x27;s in a story arc in the Marvel comic book &quot;Excalibur&quot;, in which Kitty Pryde became a student at &quot;St Searle&#x27;s School for Young Ladies&quot;. Towards the end of the arc, Commandere Dai Thomas exclaims, &quot;I took a look at the Special Branch records. Have you any notion what this school&#x27;s &quot;done&quot; in the past? With them about, who needs the perishing SAS?&quot;

<doc id="271754" wikidata="Q9689" url="?curid=271754" title="Berlin Schönefeld Airport">
<text>Berlin Schönefeld Airport () was the secondary international airport of Berlin, the capital of Germany. It was located southeast of Berlin near the town of Schönefeld in the state of Brandenburg and bordered Berlin&#x27;s southern boundary. It was the smaller of the two airports in Berlin, after Berlin Tegel Airport, and served as an operating base for easyJet and Ryanair. In 2017, the airport handled 12.9 million passengers by serving mainly European metropolitan and leisure destinations. In the same year, the travel portal eDreams ranked Berlin Schönefeld as the worst airport in the world after evaluating 65,000 airport reviews. Schönefeld Airport was the major civil airport of East Germany (GDR) and the only airport of the former East Berlin.

On 25 October 2020 the Schönefeld name and IATA code ceased to exist, marking its closure as an independent airport, with large parts of its infrastructure being incorporated into the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport as its &quot;Terminal 5&quot;. However by November 2022, the refurbished Terminal 5 had been closed for good without being put in operation.

==History==


===First years, World War II, and GDR period: 1934–1990===
On 15 October 1934, construction began to build three long runways to serve the Henschel aircraft plant in Schönefeld. By the end of the Second World War, over 14,000 aircraft had been built. On 22 April 1945, the facilities were occupied by Soviet troops, and the plant was dismantled and demolished. By late 1947, the railway connection had been repaired and agricultural machinery was built and repaired on the site.

In 1946, the Soviet Air Forces moved from Johannisthal Air Field to Schönefeld, including the civil airline Aeroflot. In 1947, the Soviet Military Administration in Germany approved the construction of a civilian airport at the site.

A stipulation of the Four Power Agreement following World War II was a total ban on German carriers&#x27; participation in air transport to Berlin, where access was restricted to American, British, French, and Soviet airlines. Since Schönefeld airport was located outside the city boundaries of Berlin, this restriction did not apply. Thus, aircraft of the East German flag carrier Interflug could use Schönefeld airport, while West German Lufthansa was denied access to Tegel or Tempelhof airports.

===Development after German reunification: 1990–2020===
Berlin Schönefeld Airport saw a major increase in passenger numbers over recent years, which was caused by the opening of bases for both easyJet and Germanwings. In 2008, the airport served 6.6 million passengers.

Following German reunification in 1990, operating three separate airports became increasingly cost-prohibitive, leading the Berlin legislature to pursue plans for a single airport that would be more efficient and would decrease the amount of aircraft noise from airports within the city. Therefore, it was decided to build Berlin Brandenburg Airport at the current site of Schönefeld Airport, originally scheduled to open in late 2012. For various reasons, mainly issues with the fire alarm/safety system, the opening was postponed to November 2020.

At the start of the winter season in 2012 Germanwings left Schönefeld for Berlin-Tegel to maintain closer operations within the Lufthansa Group there. However, to provide competition for Ryanair&#x27;s new routes, Germanwings announced a return to Schönefeld in addition to their Tegel operations from October 2015.

Aer Lingus also announced it would switch airports within Berlin, from Schönefeld to Tegel, by March 2015. Meanwhile, Ryanair announced the establishment of their sixth German base in Schönefeld by 27 October 2015 by deploying five aircraft to the airport and adding 16 new routes.

On 2 May 2015, aircraft departing from Schönefeld became the first commercial flights to use the southern runway of the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport, which temporarily became Schönefeld&#x27;s only runway while its own, which has become the northern runway of the new airport, was renovated.

Extension work at Schönefeld Airport was completed in 2016. Terminal K was extended by approx. and the baggage area was also enlarged by 40 per cent. Terminal M2, an entirely new arrival terminal was built west of Terminal M. Spanning almost , this building features three baggage carousels and the coach parking area was relocated to a new area in P6.

The airport continued to see exceptionally high growth of passenger numbers with Berlin&#x27;s economic growth. As of November 2016, the airport operated near full capacity despite several additions to the infrastructure in recent years.

===Closure===
As of late 2018, construction works began to upgrade the airport&#x27;s terminal and apron to provide higher capacity as part of its successor, nearby Berlin Brandenburg Airport. Previously, Schönefeld&#x27;s facilities were supposed to be demolished to make way for a new government terminal.

On 25 October 2020, Schönefeld Airport became Terminal 5 of Berlin Brandenburg Airport. The IATA code SXF was discontinued on this day. Schönefeld&#x27;s terminal buildings were intended to be used until the inauguration of a planned Terminal 3 by 2030 with Ryanair as their primary tenant.

However, in November 2020, it was announced that Terminal 5 would be closed due to low passenger numbers in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic in Germany, with all flights relocating to the main Terminal 1. The terminal was subsequently indefinitely closed on 22 February 2021. 

In November 2022, it was announced that Terminal 5, the former Schönefeld Airport, would be permanently closed.

==Facilities==
Schönefeld Airport consisted of the four terminals A, B, C, and D which were renamed to K, L, M, and Q prior to the merger into the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport. These terminals were located next to each other but have separate landside areas. However, they were connected through a joint airside concourse. Terminal Q had no check-in facilities; it was used exclusively for passengers clearing security checks to enter the airside boarding gates. Due to a lack of space, there were not as many facilities as those at many other international airports. There are some shops, however, including duty-free, newsstands, a few fast food restaurants, and a single airline lounge.

===Terminal A===
The main building was the original part of the airport. It housed check-in for Terminals K and L. Terminal A featured check-in counters L01–L18, with the largest user being Ryanair alongside several other airlines like Aeroflot.

===Terminal B===
Terminal B, located in a side wing, was originally reserved for transit passengers to and from West Berlin who took advantage of cheaper airfares and package tours arranged by an East German travel agency. More recently it has been used exclusively by easyJet with check-in counters K20–K29 and has been refurbished in recent years. The airside consisted of three jet bridges as well as several walk-boarding aircraft stands located at &quot;Pier 3a&quot;, an extension that was opened in 2005. Pier 3a was under extensive reconstruction until mid-2019 to allow use as part of the new Berlin Brandenburg Airport.

===Terminal C===
Terminal C was originally built in the early 1980s as an external VIP lounge called &quot;Sonderraum&quot; (Special Room), and was tightly secured by the Ministry for State Security (Stasi). Only official guests of the East German government and its subordinated organizations were admitted. Check-in and all mandatory controls were either waived or done invisibly for travelers. After 1990, the Special Room was converted into Terminal C to accommodate highly security-sensitive flights like those of Israeli airlines, but also for charter flights to North America. It was reconfigured in 2008 to handle sightseeing trips and flights in connection with special events. It was further reconfigured in 2015 to provide access to all terminal gates. To reduce congestion in other terminals, it then housed additional security checkpoints for passengers who are checked in and have checked their luggage or only carry hand luggage.

===Terminal D===
Terminal D was opened in December 2005 due to rapidly growing passenger numbers. Being nearly identical to Terminal C at Berlin Tegel Airport, it featured check-in counters M40–M57, which were mainly used by Ryanair, Condor, and Norwegian Air Shuttle. It did not feature jet bridges but several walk-boarding stands. In November 2016, the new large arrivals area D&quot;2&quot; opened right next to Terminal D.

===Other facilities===
* The head office of Private Wings has been located in the General Aviation Terminal on the property of Schönefeld Airport.
* Before its demise, the East German flag carrier Interflug had its headquarters on the airport property.
* Until Brandenburg Airport started construction , 07L/25R was actually known as 07R/25L as Schönefeld had a different 07L/25R. This runway cut across the current Autobahn 113, with the approach lighting to the old runway 25R stretching into Bohnsdorf. This runway was about long - some shorter than the then 07R/25L, and was surfaced with concrete slabs instead of asphalt pavement.

==Airlines and destinations==
Prior to its closure as an independent airport, Schönefeld had been served mostly by low-cost and leisure carriers with easyJet, Ryanair, Condor, and Wizz Air offering the most destinations. The airport did not see any long-haul traffic but did serve several dozen routes to European metropolitan and leisure destinations around the Mediterranean. Only a few legacy carriers preferred Schönefeld over Tegel Airport, most notably Aeroflot, El Al and Egypt Air.

==Statistics==
===Annual traffic===
===Busiest routes===


==Ground transportation==
===Train===
Berlin Schönefeld Airport was served by Berlin-Schönefeld Flughafen railway station, a short walking distance through a ground-level covered walkway from the airport terminals. Berlin Central Station (&quot;Berlin Hbf&quot;) was served directly by regional trains (&quot;RE&quot; Regional-Express or &quot;RB&quot; Regional-Bahn). These ran every 30 minutes and transit through Berlin Ostbahnhof, Alexanderplatz, Friedrichstraße, Berlin Central Station (after 30 minutes), Zoologischer Garten, Charlottenburg, and beyond. Berlin S-Bahn lines S9 and S45 ran every twenty minutes, but only the S9 went through Berlin Central Station.

===Car===
The airport could be reached via the nearby motorway A113 (Exit &quot;Schönefeld Süd&quot;) which itself is connected to motorways A100 which leads to Berlin city center and A10 which circles around Berlin and connects further to all directions.

===Bus===
The airport was linked by local BVG bus lines 162 (towards Adlershof) and 171 (towards Neukölln). Additionally the X7 bus service provided a connection to the Berlin U-Bahn network at Rudow Station. At night, the underground replacement bus N7 was available.

==Accidents and incidents==
*On 14 August 1972, an Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft of Interflug (registered DM-SEA) crashed near Königs Wusterhausen shortly into a flight to Burgas, killing all 156 passengers and crew on board.
*On 22 November 1977, a Tupolev Tu-134 aircraft of Interflug (registration DM-SCM) crashed upon landing at Schönefeld Airport due to a falsely configured autopilot. There were no fatalities among the 74 passengers and crew, but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
*On 19 August 1978, LOT Polish Airlines Flight 165, a LOT flight from Gdańsk-Rębiechowo Airport to Schönefeld (carried out on a Tupolev Tu-134, registration SP-LGC), was hijacked and forced to land at Tempelhof Airport in West Berlin, thus having been used as a means for escaping the Eastern Bloc. In these cases, perpetrators were usually not charged by Western authorities.
*On 12 December 1986, Aeroflot Flight 892 an Aeroflot Tupolev Tu-134 (registration CCCP-65795) coming from Minsk Airport crashed in Berlin Bohnsdorf on its approach towards Schönefeld airport, after having attempted to land on a runway that was temporarily blocked for construction work, killing 72 of the 82 passengers and crew on board.
*On 17 June 1989, an Ilyushin Il-62 aircraft of Interflug (registration DDR-SEW) bound for Moscow crashed shortly after take-off into a field near the airport and caught fire. 21 people on board as well as one person on the ground were killed. The East German authorities feared an act of sabotage due to the anniversary of the East German uprising, which led to a delayed aid for injured people. West Berlin rescuers offering help were denied access to the scene. The cause for the accident was later given as a jammed rudder due to a manufacturing defect.
*On 28 March 2000, a Boeing 737-300 of Germania (registration D-AGES) operating a charter flight on behalf of LTU from Tenerife South Airport to Schönefeld was the subject of an attempted hijack in mid-flight. A passenger forced his way into the cockpit, where he attacked the pilot, leading to a sudden loss of altitude. The perpetrator was restrained and the flight continued to Berlin.
*On 19 June 2010, a 1944-built, historic Douglas DC-3 D-CXXX of Berlin Air Services crashed shortly after takeoff on a local sightseeing flight, causing 7 injuries but no fatalities.

<doc id="271759" wikidata="Q517919" url="?curid=271759" title="SuperDisk">
<text>The SuperDisk LS-120 is a high-speed, high-capacity alternative to the 90 mm (3.5 in), 1.44 MB floppy disk. The SuperDisk hardware was created by 3M&#x27;s storage products group Imation in 1996, with manufacturing chiefly by Matsushita.

The SuperDisk had little success in North America; with Compaq, Gateway and Dell being three of only a few OEMs who supported it. It was more successful in Asia and Australia, where the majority of second-generation SuperDisk LS-240 drives and disks were released. There was one model of LS-240 drive released in North America, by QPS. SuperDisk worldwide ceased manufacturing in 2003.

==History==
The design of the SuperDisk system came from an early 1990s project at Iomega. It is one of the last examples of floptical technology, where lasers are used to guide a magnetic head which is much smaller than those used in traditional floppy disk drives. Iomega orphaned the project around the time they decided to release the Zip drive in 1994. The idea eventually ended up at 3M, where the concept was refined and the design was licensed to established floppy drive makers Matsushita and Mitsubishi. Other companies involved in the development of SuperDisk include Compaq and OR Technology.

Matsushita continued development of the technology and released the LS-240. It has double the capacity of the LS-120 and the added feature of being able to format regular floppy disks to 32 MB capacity. However, this higher density comes at a price – the entire disk must be rewritten any time a change is made, much like early CD-RW media.

A SuperDisk drive was used in two Panasonic digital cameras, the PV-SD4090 and PV-SD5000, which allowed them to use both SuperDisk (LS-120) and 3.5″ floppy disks as the memory media.

==Technical information ==

The SuperDisk&#x27;s format was designed to supersede the floppy disk with its higher-capacity media that imitated the ubiquitous format with its own 120 MB (and later 240 MB) disk storage while the SuperDisk drive itself was backwards compatible with 1.44 MB and 720 KB floppy formats (MFM). Superdisk drives read and write faster to these sorts of disks than conventional 1.44 MB or 720 KB floppy drives.

The newer LS-240 drives also have the ability to read and write regular 1.44 MB floppies at much higher densities in a format called &quot;FD32MB&quot;. Described in the help file for the SuperWriter32 application included with the driver package, the increase of capacity for FD32MB is achieved through the use of shingled magnetic recording (SMR) to reduce track pitch to 18.8μm from the standard 187.5μm, allowing 777 tracks per side. This is combined with linear recording density improvements enabling 36-53 sectors per track through partial-response maximum-likelihood and zone bit recording.

The true capacity of these &quot;SD120MB&quot; drives is 120.375 MiB aka 126.22 MB (FAT16B with logical geometry 963/8/32 CHS × 512 bytes). The &quot;SD240MB&quot; drives have a capacity of 229.25 MiB aka 240.39 MB (FAT16B with logical geometry 262/32/56 CHS × 512 bytes). 1.44 MB HD floppies formatted to 32 MB as &quot;FD32MB&quot; (FAT16B with logical geometry 1024/2/32 CHS × 512 bytes) in the LS-240 show a dummy FAT12 file system (with logical geometries 160/2/9 or 80/2/18) when inserted into a normal floppy drive.

SuperDisk drives have been sold in parallel port, USB, ATAPI and SCSI variants. All drives can read and write 1.44 MB and 720 KiB MFM floppies, as used on PCs, Apple Macintoshes (High Density format only, see below), and many workstations. 2.88 MB floppy formats are not supported.

Imation also released a version of the SuperDisk with &quot;Secured Encryption Technology&quot;, which uses Blowfish with a 64-bit key to encrypt the contents.

Under Windows XP&#x27;s codice_1 driver, a USB SuperDisk drive will appear as a 3.5″ floppy disk drive, receiving either the drive letter A: (if there is no floppy in the machine) or B: (if there already is one). This enables use by software that expects a floppy drive when 1.44 MB or 720 KB disks are inserted. 120 MB and 240 MB disks are also accessed via A: or B:.

==Criticism and obsolescence==
Older 800KB and 400KB Macintosh floppies, using GCR, did not work with a SuperDisk drive. These disks could be used in a SuperDisk drive only if formatted to PC 720 KB MFM format. Note that almost no USB floppy drives supported Mac GCR floppies.

The biggest hurdle standing in the way of success was that Iomega&#x27;s Zip drive had been out for three years when SuperDisk had been released. Zip had enough popularity to leave the public mostly uninterested in SuperDisk, despite its superior design and its compatibility with the standard floppy disk.

By 2000, the entire removable magnetic disk category was finally obsoleted by the falling prices of CD-R and CD-RW drives, and later on solid-state (USB flash drives or USB keydrives). Over the next few years, SuperDisk was quietly discontinued, even in areas where it was popular. Today, disks are very hard to find.

==Practicality==
The USB models were quite popular for debugging and installing servers that did not have a CD drive available. They could both store massive numbers of drivers for installation purposes as well as be used to run live operating systems, such as ReactOS, which amounts to 150 MB.

<doc id="271769" wikidata="Q942602" url="?curid=271769" title="Languedocien dialect">
<text>Languedocien (French name, ), Languedocian, or Lengadocian () is an Occitan dialect spoken in rural parts of southern France such as Languedoc, Rouergue, Quercy, Agenais and Southern Périgord. It is sometimes also called Languedocien-Guyennais. Due to its central position among the dialects of Occitan, it is often used as a basis for a Standard Occitan.

About 10% of the population of Languedoc are fluent in the language (about 300,000), and another 20% (600,000) &quot;have some understanding&quot; of the language. All speak French as their first or second language.

== Geographic distribution ==
Languedocien is spoken in certain parts of three French regions.

* Occitanie: Aveyron, Lot, Tarn, Tarn-et-Garonne except Lomagne, Ariège (except a western part), Haute-Garonne (except the districts of Saint-Gaudens and Muret), Aude, Hérault, Lozère, western and northern parts of Gard and Fenouillèdes.
* Nouvelle-Aquitaine: south of the Dordogne, east of the Gironde, north-eastern two-thirds of Lot-et-Garonne, the southern fringe of Corrèze.
* Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes: area of Bas-Vivarois, Languedocien-Nord-Cévenol

Other dialects spoken in these areas include: Gascon, Catalan, Limousin, and Auvergnat, as well as the unrelated Basque language.

== Characteristics ==
The following are the main characteristics of the Languedocien dialect:

* occlusives are kept at the end of a word: &quot;cantat&quot; [kanˈtat] (in Provençal: [kãnˈta]);
* preservation of the final &quot;s&quot; of a word: &quot;los òmes&quot; [luˈzɔmes] (in Limousin: [luzɔˈmej]);
* the final &quot;n&quot; of a word is dropped: &quot;occitan&quot; [utsiˈta] (in Provençal: [usiˈtãn]);
* absence of palatalisation of CA and GA groups: &quot;cantar&quot;, &quot;gal&quot; (in Auvergnat: &quot;chantar&quot;, &quot;jal&quot;);
* preservation of the final &quot;l&quot; of a word (i.e. not vocalised): &quot;provençal&quot; (in Provençal and in Gascon: &quot;provençau&quot;);
* lack of distinction between the sounds &quot;b&quot; and &quot;v&quot; (betacism): &quot;vin&quot; [bi] (in Auvergnat, Limousin and Provençal: [vji], [vi], [vin]).

None of these characteristics are unique to Languedocien; many are shared with one or more other Occitan dialects. Languedocien is both a central and conservative dialect. For these reasons, certain linguists are in favour of a standardisation of Occitan using Languedocien as a basis for this.

== Variations ==

Languedocien encompasses a number of variations, the classification of which is still ongoing.

Jules Ronjat gives three sub-groups:

* Eastern Languedocien dialects: Alésien, Montpelliérain, Lodévois, and Bitterrois (the latter tending towards Western Languedocien).
* Western Languedocien dialects: Narbonnais, Carcassonnais, Toulousain (including Fuxéen and Capcinois), Albigeois, Montalbanais, Agenais (the latter tending towards Guyennais and Gascon).
* Guyennais dialects: Rouergat, Gévaudanais (Lozère, Cévennes), Quercinois, Aurillacois, Sarladais, Bergeracois.
* He also classes Bas-Vivarois as a Languedocien dialect but separate from the above categories.

Louis Alibert uses four sub-groups:

* Eastern dialects: Cévenol, Montpelliérain, Bitterois.
* Southern dialects: Toulousain, Fuxéen, Donezanais, Narbonnais, &quot;Central&quot; (Carcassonais), Agenais.
* Western dialects: Bergeracois, Villeneuvois, Sarladais, Haut-Quercinois, Bas-Quercinois, Albigeois.
* Northern dialects: Aurillacois, Rouergat, Gévaudanais.

Domergue Sumien defines the categories thus:

* Eastern dialects: Cévenol, Montpelliérain.
* Southern dialects: Toulousain, Fuxéen, Donezanais, Narbonnais, Carcassonais.
* Western dialects: Bas-Quercinois, Albigeois, Agenais, Bitterois.
* Northern dialects: Bergeracois, Villeneuvois, Sarladais, Haut-Quercinois, Aurillacois, Rouergat, Gévaudanais, Bas-Vivarois.

In their supra-dialectal classification of Occitan, Pierre Bec and Domergue Sumien divide Languedocien into one or two supra-dialectal groups:

* Pierre Bec places Southern Languedocien dialects in the Aquitanian-Pyrenean group and the rest of the Languedocien dialects in the Central Occitanian group.
* Domergue Sumien classifies these Languedocien dialects similarly, but groups both Aquitanian-Pyrenean and Central Occitanian under the title of Pre-Iberian.
== Usage ==
With the absence of a linguistic census, it is difficult to obtain exact figures on the number of speakers. The most recent global studies on Occitan say the number of speakers ranges from 500,000 to 700,000 for the language as a whole. UNESCO, which is the only organisation to treat Languedocien independently, estimates the number at around 500,000, and considers the language under serious threat.

<doc id="271771" wikidata="Q669419" url="?curid=271771" title="Atticus of Constantinople">
<text>Atticus of Constantinople (; died 10 October 425) was an archbishop of Constantinople, succeeding to the episcopal throne in March 406. He is known for having been an opponent of John Chrysostom whom he helped depose, and having rebuilt the small church that was located on the site of the later Hagia Sophia. He was an opponent of the Pelagians, which helped increase his popularity among the citizens of Constantinople, and he contributed to the theological framework for the developing cult of the Virgin Mary.

== Biography ==
Born at Sivas in the second half of the 4th century, Atticus early embraced a monastic life and received his education from Macedonian monks, a fact which restricted his philosophical learning and ensured he would always have an Armenian accent considered unpleasant to Greek ears. Removing to Constantinople, he adopted the orthodox faith, was ordained presbyter, and soon became known as a rising man for his intelligence, charm, and political moderation. He proved himself one of Chrysostom&#x27;s most bitter adversaries. If not, as Palladius of Galatia asserts, the architect of the whole cabal, he certainly took a leading part in carrying it into execution. The organization of the Synod of the Oak owed much to his practical skill and he was one of the seven witnesses called to testify against Chrysostom. The expulsion of Chrysostom took place 10 June 404 and his successor, the aged Arsacius of Tarsus who was the brother of Chrystom&#x27;s predecessor Nectarius of Constantinople, died 5 November 405. Four months of intrigue ended in the selection of Atticus.

Vigorous measures were at once adopted by Atticus in conjunction with the other members of the triumvirate to which the Eastern church had been subjected, Theophilus I of Alexandria, and Porphyry of Antioch, to crush the adherents of Chrysostom. An imperial rescript was obtained imposing the severest penalties on all who dared to reject the communion of the patriarchs. A large number of the bishops of the East persevered in the refusal, and suffered a cruel persecution; while even the inferior clergy and laity were compelled to keep themselves in concealment or to flee the country. The small minority of Eastern bishops who for peace&#x27;s sake deserted Chrysostom&#x27;s cause were made to feel the guilt of having once supported it, being compelled to leave their sees and take other dioceses in the inhospitable regions of Thrace, where they might be more under Atticus&#x27;s eye and hand.

Unity seemed hardly nearer when the death of Chrysostom (14 September 407) removed the original ground of the schism. A large proportion of the Christian population of Constantinople still supported their former bishop, with many refusing communion with the man they considered a usurper and continuing to hold their religious assemblies, more numerously attended than the churches, in the open air in the suburbs of the city. Atticus subsequently made strides to reconcile with the &quot;Johannites&quot;, placing Chrysostom&#x27;s name in the diptychs of the Church around 412–415. Nevertheless, the internal schism would last until the late bishop&#x27;s memory was fully rehabilitated with the transfer of his relics to the capital two decades later.

In 408 Roman emperor Arcadius died, leaving behind a son, Theodosius II, and three daughters, all of whom were children. Thus the affairs of state and the education of the youthful Imperial Family were managed by a regency government of which Atticus played a leading part. Atticus gained particular influence over the princesses, Pulcheria, Arcadia, and Marina. His episcopacy saw a period of prosperity and peace for church and empire; shrines, monasteries and churches were built throughout the capital, the walls of which were greatly expanded in 412. The iconic Church of the Holy Wisdom was rebuilt after a fire.

Some time before 425, Atticus received a delegation of Armenian clergymen who sought to secure approval for using the newly invented Armenian alphabet. Persian and Syrian influence was growing in the Armenian Church during this time, and Bishop Atticus had to navigate a diplomatically sensitive affair.

Atticus&#x27;s 19-year archepiscopal endeavours were vigorously directed to the maintenance and enlargement of the authority of the see of Constantinople. He obtained a rescript from Roman emperor Theodosius II subjecting to it the whole of Illyria and the &quot;Provincia Orientalis&quot;. This gave great offence to Pope Boniface I and the Roman emperor Honorius, and the decree was never put into execution. Another rescript declaring his right to decide on and approve of the election of all the bishops of the province was more effectual. Silvanus was named by him bishop of Philippopolis and afterwards removed to Alexandria Troas. Atticus asserted his right to ordain in Bithynia, and put it in practice at Nicaea in 425.

He died on 10 October 425.

== Teachings ==
=== Anti-heretical endeavours ===
Though he was lenient toward the Novatians and the partisans of John Chrysostom, Atticus displayed great vigour in combating and repressing heresy. He wrote to the bishop of Pamphylia and to Amphilochius of Iconium, calling on them to drive out the Messalians (Photius, 52). He likewise strove against the lingering adherents of Arianism and Apollinarism in his &quot;Letter to Eupsychius&quot;, in which he affirmed that &quot;God sufferred in a body&quot; and that Jesus is &quot;self-same God and man&quot;. The letter was later recognised at the Council of Chalcedon.

Socrates of Constantinople, who is a partial witness, attributes to him a sweet and winning disposition which caused him to be regarded with much affection. Those who thought with him found in him a warm friend and supporter. Towards his theological adversaries he at first showed great severity, and after they submitted, changed his behaviour and won them by gentleness. He characterised Atticus as spending whole nights in study of &quot;the ancients&quot;.

The zeal and energy he displayed against the Pelagians are highly commended by Pope Celestine I, who goes so far as to posthumously style him &quot;a true successor of St. Chrysostom&quot;.; Theod. Ep. cxlv.). His writings were quoted as those of an orthodox teacher by the councils of Ephesus and Chalcedon. Atticus was more an administrator than a writer, and of what he did publish little remains. A treatise &quot;On Faith and Virginity&quot;, combating by anticipation the errors of Nestorius, addressed to Roman emperor Theodosius I&#x27;s daughters Pulcheria and her sisters, is mentioned by Marcellinus Comes. Constas esteems that it &quot;probably contributed to the princess&#x27;s decision to embrace virginity and asceticism&quot;, tied up with burgeoning Marian devotions.

=== Mariology ===
Atticus played a noteworthy role in the development of Marian theology. He used the term Theotokos long before the outbreak of the Nestorian controversy, and has been reckoned among the earliest champions of the cult of the Virgin. In the &quot;Letter to Eupsychius&quot; he &quot;stressed the importance of Mary for a proper understanding of orthodox christology&quot;, characterising Mary&#x27;s womb as that which &quot;like heaven, receives God&quot; in emphasising the wonder of the divine maternity. Constas identifies this strong Christological-Mariological synthesis in the intellectual and devotional climate of the city, building upon earlier works by figures like the Cappadocians, as the catalyst for later Nestorian repudiation. The Bishop&#x27;s comparative lack of rhetorical erudition was offset by his talented secretary Proclus of Constantinople who acted as his ghost-writer. Because of his reputation for devotion to Mary, it is probable that the first official Marian feast in Constantinople, held during the Nativity cycle, was introduced during Atticus&#x27; tenure.

== Veneration ==
He is highly regarded for his charity and piety and is venerated as a Saint in the Eastern Orthodox Church, which observes his feast on 8 January.

<doc id="271777" wikidata="Q292290" url="?curid=271777" title="Ellen G. White">
<text>Ellen Gould White (née Harmon; November 26, 1827 – July 16, 1915) was an American author and co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church. Along with other Adventist leaders, such as Joseph Bates and her husband James White, she was influential within a small group of early Adventists who formed what became known as the Seventh-day Adventist Church. White is considered a leading figure in American vegetarian history. &quot;Smithsonian&quot; named her among the &quot;100 Most Significant Americans of All Time&quot;.

White&#x27;s biographer and grandson, Arthur L. White, estimated that she reported receiving over 2,000 visions and dreams from God in public and private meetings throughout her life, many of which were observed by Adventist pioneers and the general public. She verbally described and published for public consumption her accounts of many of these experiences. The Adventist pioneers believed them to be examples of the Biblical gift of prophecy, as outlined in Revelation 12:17 and Revelation 19:10, which describe the testimony of Jesus as the &quot;spirit of prophecy&quot;. Her &quot;Conflict of the Ages&quot; series of writings describes her understanding of the role of God in Biblical history and in church history. This narrative of cosmic conflict, referred to by Seventh-day Adventist theologians as the &quot;Great Controversy theme&quot;, became foundational to the development of Seventh-day Adventist theology. Her book on successful Christian living, &quot;Steps to Christ&quot;, has been published in more than 140 languages. The book &quot;Child Guidance&quot;— a compilation of her writings about child care, training, and education — has been used as the foundation for the Seventh-day Adventist school system.

White was considered a controversial figure by her critics, and much of the controversy centered on her reports of visionary experiences and on the use of other sources in her writings. Historian Randall Balmer has described White as &quot;one of the more important and colorful figures in the history of American religion&quot;. Walter Martin described her as &quot;one of the most fascinating and controversial personages ever to appear upon the horizon of religious history&quot;. Arthur L. White, her grandson and biographer, wrote that Ellen G. White is the most translated female non-fiction author in the history of literature, as well as the most translated American non-fiction author overall. Her writings covered a broad range of subjects, including religion, social relationships, prophecy, publishing, nutrition, creationism, agriculture, theology, evangelism, Christian lifestyle, education, and health. She advocated vegetarianism. She promoted and has been instrumental in the establishment of schools and medical centers all over the world, with the most renowned being Andrews University in Michigan and Loma Linda University and Medical Center in California.

During her lifetime she wrote more than 5,000 periodical articles and 40 books. more than 200 White titles are available in English, including compilations from her 100,000 pages of manuscript maintained by the Ellen G. White Estate. Her most notable books are &quot;Steps to Christ&quot;, &quot;The Desire of Ages&quot;, and &quot;The Great Controversy&quot;.

==Personal life==

===Early life===

Ellen and her twin sister Elizabeth were born November 26, 1827, to Robert and Eunice Harmon at a home at State Route 114 in Gorham, Maine. She was the seventh of eight children. Robert was a farmer who also made hats using mercuric nitrate.

Charles E. Dudley, Sr., in his book, &quot;The Genealogy of Ellen Gould Harmon White: The Prophetess of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the Story of the Growth and Development of the Seventh-day Adventist Denomination as It Relates to African-Americans&quot;, claims that Ellen White had an African-American ancestry. In March 2000, the Ellen G. White Estate commissioned Roger D. Joslyn, a professional genealogist, to research Ellen G. White&#x27;s ancestry. Joslyn concluded that she was of Anglo-Saxon origin.

At the age of nine, White was hit in the face with a stone. This occurred while she was living in Portland, Maine, and attending the Brackett Street School. This, she said, started her conversion: &quot;This misfortune, which for a time seemed so bitter and was so hard to bear, has proved to be a blessing in disguise. The cruel blow which blighted the joys of earth, was the means of turning my eyes to heaven. I might never have known Jesus, had not the sorrow that clouded my early years led me to seek comfort in him&quot;. A few years after her injury, Ellen, with her parents, attended a Methodist camp meeting at Buxton, Maine; and there, at the age of 12, a breakthrough occurred in which she had a conversion experience and felt at peace.

===Millerite movement===

In 1840, at age 12, her family became involved with the Millerite movement. As she attended William Miller&#x27;s lectures, she felt guilty for her sins and was filled with terror about being eternally lost. She describes herself as spending nights in tears and prayer and being in this condition for several months. On June 26, 1842, she was baptized by John Hobart in Casco Bay in Portland, Maine, and eagerly awaited Jesus to come again. In her later years, she referred to this as the happiest time of her life. Her family&#x27;s involvement with Millerism caused them to be disfellowshipped by the local Methodist church.

===Marriage and family===

In February 1845, Ellen Harmon came in contact with her future husband James Springer White, a Millerite who became convinced that her visions were genuine. During the winter of 1845, the two, accompanied by a female chaperone, visited Millerite believers in Maine, including an eventful stop in Atkinson for a farmhouse meeting led by Israel Dammon. A year later James proposed and they were married by a justice of the peace in Portland, Maine, on August 30, 1846. James later wrote:

We were married August 30, 1846, and from that hour to the present she has been my crown of rejoicing ... It has been in the good providence of God that both of us had enjoyed a deep experience in the Advent movement ... This experience was now needed as we should join our forces and, united, labor extensively from the Atlantic Ocean to the Pacific ...

The Whites had four sons: Henry Nichols, James Edson (known as Edson), William Clarence (known as Willie or W. C.), and John Herbert. Only Edson and William lived to adulthood. John Herbert died of erysipelas at the age of two months, and Henry died of pneumonia at the age of 16 [White Estate Biography] in 1863.

===Final years and death===

White spent the final years of her life in Elmshaven, her home in Saint Helena, California after the death of her husband James White in 1881. During her final years she traveled less frequently as she concentrated upon writing her last works for the church. She died on July 16, 1915, at her home in Elmshaven, which is now an Adventist Historical Site. After three funerals, she was buried alongside her husband James White in Oak Hill Cemetery, Battle Creek, Michigan.

==Ministry==

===Visions===
From 1844 to 1863 White allegedly experienced between 100 and 200 visions, typically in public places and meeting halls. She experienced her first vision soon after the Millerite Great Disappointment of 1844. She said she had one that led to the writing of &quot;The Great Controversy&quot; at an Ohio funeral service held on a Sunday afternoon in March 1858, in the Lovett&#x27;s Grove (now Bowling Green, Ohio) public school. This was an alleged vision of the ages-long conflict between Christ and his angels and Satan and his angels.

====Physical phenomena during visions====
J. N. Loughborough, who had seen Ellen G. White in vision 50 times since 1852, and her husband, James White, listed several physical characteristics that marked the visions:
# &quot;In passing into vision, she gives three enrapturing shouts of &#x27;Glory!&#x27; which echo and re-echo, the second, and especially the third, fainter but more thrilling than the first, the voice resembling that of one quite a distance from you, and just going out of hearing.&quot;
# For a few moments &quot;she would swoon&quot;, having no strength. Then she would be instantly &quot;filled with superhuman strength&quot;, sometimes rising to her feet and walking about the room. She frequently moved her hands, arms, and head in gestures that were free and graceful. But to whatever position she moved a hand or arm, it could not be hindered nor controlled by even the strongest person. In 1845, she held her parents&#x27; 18.5 pound family Bible in her outstretched left hand for half an hour. She weighed 80 pounds at the time.
# &quot;She did not breathe&quot; during the entire period of a vision that ranged &quot;from fifteen minutes to three hours&quot;. Yet, her pulse beat regularly and her countenance remained pleasant as in the natural state.
# &quot;Her eyes were always open without blinking&quot;; her head was raised, looking upward with a pleasant expression as if staring intently at some distant object. Several physicians, at different times, conducted tests to check her lack of breathing and other physical phenomena.
# She was utterly &quot;unconscious of everything transpiring around her&quot;, and viewed herself as removed from this world, and in the presence of heavenly beings.
# When she came out of vision, all seemed total darkness whether in the daytime or a well-lighted room at night. She would exclaim with a long-drawn sigh, as she took her first natural breath, &quot;D-a-r-k.&quot; She was then limp and strengthless.

Martha Amadon added: &quot;There was never an excitement among those present during a vision; nothing caused fear. It was a solemn, quiet scene.&quot;

====First vision====
In December 1844, White experienced her first vision during a prayer meeting at the home of Mrs. Elizabeth Haines in Portland, Maine, on the end of Danforth Street just before Vaughan’s bridge, which crossed the Fore River. The site became an industrial area by the end of the 1800s. Ellen White described the occasion:

At this time I visited one of our Advent sisters, and in the morning we bowed around the family altar. It was not an exciting occasion, and there were but five of us present, all females. While praying, the power of God came upon me as I never had felt it before, and I was wrapt up in a vision of God&#x27;s glory, and seemed to be rising higher and higher from the earth and was shown something of the travels of the Advent people to the Holy City ...

In this vision the &quot;Advent people&quot; were traveling a high and dangerous path towards the city of New Jerusalem [heaven]. Their path was lit from the path&#x27;s beginning by a bright light &quot;which an angel told me was the midnight cry.&quot; Some of the travelers grew weary and were encouraged by Jesus; others denied the light, the light behind them went out, and they fell &quot;off the path into the dark and wicked world below.&quot; The vision continued with a portrayal of Christ&#x27;s second coming, following which the Advent people entered the New Jerusalem; and ended with her returning to earth feeling lonely, desolate and longing for that &quot;better world.&quot;

As Godfrey T. Anderson said, &quot;In effect, the vision assured the Advent believers of eventual triumph despite the immediate despair into which they had plunged.&quot;

====Second and third visions====
White’s second vision was about a week after the first. Again there were five females present in the house praying. The vision was a depiction of the trials that she would have to go through and the commission to relate to others what had been revealed to her. The third vision took place at the home of Robert Harmon, Sr., during a season of prayer. (See &quot;Public testimony&quot; below for her description.)

====Fifth and sixteenth visions====
In February 1845, White allegedly experienced her fifth vision in Exeter, Maine. It was known as the &quot;Bridegroom&quot; vision. Together with the sixteenth vision, the &quot;New Earth&quot; vision, the visions &quot;gave continued meaning to the October 1844 experience and supported the developing sanctuary rationale. Additionally they played an important role in countering the spiritualizing views of many fanatical Adventists by portraying the Father and Jesus as literal beings and heaven as a physical place.&quot;

==== Otsego vision ====
On June 6, 1863, in Otsego, Michigan she experienced a vision about health and disease. The vision dealt with the responsibility to care for one&#x27;s health. In time she was shown that vegetarianism, as was described in Genesis 1:29, would help protect health. The message, however, because of her extensive travels during the 19th century and the lack of vegetarian food, her view was not absolute. Vegetarianism was popular in Portland, Maine during her childhood. She became committed herself to vegetarianism in January 1894 when she was at the Brighton camp meeting near Melbourne, Australia.

====Public testimony====
Fearing people would not accept her testimony, White did not initially share her visions with the wider Millerite community. In a meeting at her parents&#x27; home she received in her third vision what she regarded as confirmation of her ministry:

While praying, the thick darkness that had enveloped me was scattered, a bright light, like a ball of fire, came towards me, and as it fell upon me, my strength was taken away. I seemed to be in the presence of Jesus and the angels. Again it was repeated, &#x27;Make known to others what I have revealed to you.&#x27;

Before the Disappointment and before her first vision, White had given her testimony in public meetings and in her regular Methodist class meetings in private homes.

I arranged meetings with my young friends, some of whom were considerably older than myself, and a few were married persons. A number of them were vain and thoughtless; my experience sounded to them like an idle tale, and they did not heed my entreaties. But I determined that my efforts should never cease till these dear souls, for whom I had so great an interest, yielded to God. Several entire nights were spent by me in earnest prayer for those whom I had sought out and brought together for the purpose of laboring and praying with them.

News of her visions spread and White was soon traveling and speaking to groups of Millerite followers in Maine and the surrounding area. Her visions were not publicized further afield until January 24, 1846, when her account of the first vision: &quot;Letter From Sister Harmon&quot; was published in &quot;The Day-Star&quot;, a Millerite paper published in Cincinnati, Ohio, by Enoch Jacobs. White had written to Jacobs to encourage him and, although she stated the letter was not written for publication, Jacobs printed it anyway. Through the next few years it was republished in various forms and is included as part of her first book, &quot;A Sketch of the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White&quot;, published in 1851.

Two Millerites claimed to have had visions prior to White – William Ellis Foy (1818–1893), and Hazen Foss (1819–1893), the brother of White&#x27;s brother-in-law. Adventists believe the prophetic gift offered to these two men was passed on to White when they rejected it.

===Middle life===

White described the vision experience as involving a bright light which would surround her, and she felt herself in the presence of Jesus or angels who would show her events (historical and future) and places (on earth, in heaven, or other planets). The transcriptions of White&#x27;s visions generally contain theology, prophecy, or personal counsels to individuals or to Adventist leaders. One of the best examples of her personal counsels is found in a 9-volume series of books entitled &quot;Testimonies for the Church&quot;, which contain edited testimonies published for the general edification of the church. The spoken and written versions of her visions played a significant part in establishing and shaping the organizational structure of the emerging Seventh-day Adventist Church. Her visions and writings continue to be used by church leaders in developing the church&#x27;s policies and for devotional reading.

On March 14, 1858, at Lovett&#x27;s Grove, near Bowling Green, Ohio, White received a vision while attending a funeral service. Regarding that day, James White wrote that &quot;God manifested His power in a wonderful manner,&quot; adding that &quot;several had decided to keep the Lord&#x27;s Sabbath and go with the people of God.&quot; In writing about the vision, Ellen herself stated that she received practical instruction for church members, and more significantly, a cosmic sweep of the conflict &quot;between Christ and His angels, and Satan and his angels.&quot; Ellen White would expand upon this great controversy theme, which would eventually culminate in the &quot;Conflict of the Ages&quot; series.

==Personality and public persona==

White was seen as a powerful and sought-after preacher. While she has been perceived as having a strict and serious personality, perhaps due to her lifestyle standards, numerous sources describe her as a friendly person.

==Major teachings==


===Theology===
* Christ-centered salvation by grace
* The Great Controversy theme
* Obedience to revealed truth a sign of genuine faith
Jerry Moon argues that White taught assurance of salvation. Arthur Patrick believes that White was evangelical, in that she had high regard for the Bible, saw the cross as central, supported righteousness by faith, believed in Christian activism, and sought to restore New Testament Christianity.

Malcolm Bull writes that Ellen White avoided using the word &quot;Trinity&quot;, &quot;and her husband stated categorically that her visions did not support the Trinitarian creed.&quot; Bull wrote that &quot;one researcher was forced to conclude&quot; that there has not &quot;been found any Trinitarian declaration written, prior to [1898], by an Adventist writer other than Ellen G. White.&quot; Her theology did not include a doctrine of the Trinity (generally speaking, she lacked doctrine, since she was a preacher/orator rather than an academic theologian). Malcolm Bull postulates that she believed Jesus did not begin as equal to God the Father but was at a certain moment promoted to equality with the Father, which triggered Lucifer&#x27;s rebellion (as explained in her book &quot;Spirit of Prophecy&quot;). Erwin R. Gane cites other writings that contradict this view. Referring to the ceremony, she wrote: &quot;There had been no change in the position or authority of Christ.&quot;

According to Jerry Moon in &quot;The Adventist Trinity Debate,&quot; although her earlier visions and writings do not clearly reveal the Three Persons of the Godhead, her later works strongly bring out the teaching of &quot;the Third Person of the Godhead&quot;.

Some scholars have denied that Ellen White was a major influence in the Adventist shift toward Trinitarian doctrine and have argued that early Adventism had neither an Arian, Semi-Arian, nor Trinitarian theology, but rather a materialist one.

===Education===
White&#x27;s earliest essays on education appeared in the 1872 autumn editions of the &quot;Health Reformer&quot;. In her first essay she stated that working with youthful minds was the most delicate of tasks. The manner of instruction should be varied. This would make it possible for the &quot;high and noble powers of the mind&quot; to have a chance to develop. To be qualified to educate the youth (she wrote), parents and teachers must have self-control, gentleness and love.

White&#x27;s idea of creating a Christian educational system and its importance in society are detailed in her writings &quot;Christian Education&quot; (1893, 1894) and &quot;Education&quot; (1903).

===Health reform===

White expounded greatly on the subjects of health, healthy eating and a vegetarian diet. In her book &quot;Counsels on Diet and Foods&quot;, she gives advice on the right foods and on moderation. She also warns against the use of tobacco, which was medically accepted in her day. Her views are expressed in the writings &quot;Healthful Living&quot; (1897, 1898), &quot;The Ministry of Healing&quot; (1905), and &quot;The Health Food Ministry&quot; (1970). White wrote in &quot;The Ministry of Healing&quot;: &quot;Grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables constitute the diet chosen for us by our Creator.&quot; White was against eating meat, eating spicy food, drinking alcohol, and smoking. She also opposed masturbation, medication, and physicians. &quot;The Ellen G. White Encyclopedia&quot; recognizes that her assertions about masturbation are contrary to 21st century scientific opinion.

She is the founder of many health sanitariums, the most famous of which are the Battle Creek Sanitarium and the Loma Linda Sanitarium, which is now named the Loma Linda University Medical Center. She hired American physician, inventor, and businessman John Harvey Kellogg. Her work for health reform and emphasis on healthy lifestyle is seen as the cause of the city of Loma Linda being named by researcher Dan Buettner a Blue Zone where residents live for longer lives than the average lifespan. The health reform message that she delivered is promoted by the church as a means to glorify God, though the church does not make vegetarianism a requirement for salvation. The largest proportion of Seventh-day Adventist vegetarians is in North America where over half of the members are vegetarian or vegan.

Her health reform writing focused on human health but her statements also included compassion towards animals, which was unusual for her time.

==Major writings==
White&#x27;s books include:

==Historic legacy==

According to one evangelical author, &quot;No Christian leader or theologian has exerted as great an influence on a particular denomination as Ellen White has on Adventism.&quot; Additional authors have stated &quot;Ellen G. White has undoubtedly been the most influential Seventh-day Adventist in the history of the church.&quot; She is frequently mentioned in non-Adventist media, with one example being Parade magazine in 2022 listing a quote from White among its list of the 100 best love quotes.

===Ellen G. White Estate===
The Ellen G. White Estate, Inc., was formed as a result of White&#x27;s will. It consists of a self-perpetuating board and a staff which includes a secretary (now known as the director), several associates, and a support staff. The main headquarters is at the Seventh-day Adventist General Conference headquarters in Silver Spring, Maryland. Branch Offices are located at Andrews University, Loma Linda University, and Oakwood University. There are 15 additional research centers located throughout the 13 remaining divisions of the world church. The mission of the White Estate is to circulate Ellen White&#x27;s writings, translate them, and provide resources for helping to better understand her life and ministry. At the Toronto General Conference Session (2000) the world church expanded the mission of the White Estate to include a responsibility for promoting Adventist history for the entire denomination.

===Adventist historic sites===
Several of White&#x27;s homes are historic sites. The first home that she and her husband owned is now part of the Historic Adventist Village in Battle Creek, Michigan. Her other homes are privately owned with the exception of her home in Cooranbong, Australia, which she named &quot;Sunnyside&quot;, and her last home in Saint Helena, California, which she named &quot;Elmshaven&quot;. These latter two homes are owned by the Seventh-day Adventist Church. The &quot;Elmshaven&quot; home is a National Historic Landmark.

===Avondale College===
White inspired and guided the foundation of Avondale College (now Avondale University), Cooranbong, leaving an educational legacy from her time in Australia. Avondale University is the main Seventh-day Adventist tertiary institution in the South-Pacific Division. In 2021, the restored White house of Sunnyside was reopened to the public. The home has architectural elements of New England adapted for Australia.

=== Other sites ===
In Florence, Italy, a street is named after White. The &quot;via Ellen Gould White&quot; leads to the Adventist Institute &quot;Villa Aurora&quot; at the Viale del Pergolino.

=== Vegetarian food ===
White had a major influence on the development of vegetarian foods and vegetarian food product companies. In the U.S., these included granola, Kellogg&#x27;s corn flakes, Post cereals, Soyalac soymilk, Worthington Foods, La Loma Foods, and Morningstar Farms. In 2022, the New York Conference of Seventh-day Adventists listed 33 Adventist-affiliated vegetarian restaurants, most that were located inside the United States of America including six in Texas. In Kingston, Jamaica, the three Maranatha health food stores and one restaurant are based on the health teachings of White.

In 2021, an opinion column in Australian beef industry publication &quot;Beef Central&quot; was critical of the influence of the Seventh-day Adventist church in shaping national food policy traced to White and the 1897 founding of the Sanitarium Health and Wellbeing Company, which manufactures Veggie Delights plant-based meats. In 2022, journalist Avery Yale Kamila said that White&#x27;s &quot;profound and lasting influence on vegetarian food in the United States continues today.&quot;

==Biographical writings==
Ellen White wrote her own biography first published in 1851 as &quot;A Sketch of the Christian Experience and Views of Ellen G. White&quot;. This she expanded in 1880 as &quot;Life Sketches of James White and Ellen G. White&quot; which was later expanded again by White and several authors who covered the remainder of her life. Published in 1915, it remains in print as &quot;Life Sketches of Ellen G. White&quot; (abbreviated as LS).

The most comprehensive biography of White is an extensive six-volume work called &quot;Ellen G. White: A Biography&quot; written by her grandson, Arthur L. White. Thousands of articles and books have been written about various aspects of Ellen G. White&#x27;s life and ministry. A large number of these can be found in the libraries at Loma Linda University and Andrews University, the two primary Seventh-day Adventist institutions with major research collections about Adventism. An &quot;Encyclopedia of Ellen G. White&quot; is being produced by two faculty at Andrews University: Jerry Moon, chair of the church history department, and Denis Fortin, dean of the Seventh-day Adventist Theological Seminary.

===Theatre===

&quot;Red Books: Our Search for Ellen White&quot; is a play about White, a co-founder of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and the various perceptions of her throughout the history of the church. It was produced by the Dramatic Arts Society of Pacific Union College in California. It was based on interviews collected from over 200 individuals. The title derives from White&#x27;s books, which were traditionally bound with a red cover.

===Film===
Produced by the Seventh-Day Adventist church in 2016, the movie &quot;Tell the World&quot; chronicles the life of Ellen G. White, &quot;Her guidance and advice, obtained through Bible studies, as well as dreams and visions revealed by God, guided the steps of the Church in becoming a worldwide movement of compassion in the areas of health, education, community development and disaster relief.&quot;

==Examination of the prophetic value of her writings==

Most Adventists believe White&#x27;s writings are inspired and continue to have relevance for the church today. Because of criticism from the evangelical community, in the 1940s and 1950s church leaders such as LeRoy Edwin Froom and Roy Allan Anderson attempted to help evangelicals understand Seventh-day Adventists better by engaging in extended dialogue that resulted in the publication of &quot;Questions on Doctrine&quot; (1956) that explained Adventist beliefs in evangelical language.

Evangelical Walter Martin of the countercult Christian Research Institute &quot;rejected White&#x27;s prophetic claims&quot;, yet saw her &quot;as a genuine Christian believer&quot;, unlike her contemporaries Joseph Smith, Mary Baker Eddy, and Charles Taze Russell. Kenneth Samples, a successor of Martin in his interaction with Adventism, also denies White&#x27;s prophetic claims yet &quot;believe[s] she, at minimum, had some good biblical and theological instincts&quot;.

===Adventist statement of belief about the &quot;Spirit of Prophecy&quot;===

Early Sabbatarian Adventists, many of whom had emerged from the Christian Connection, were anti-creedal. However, as early as 1872 Adventists produced a statement of beliefs. They refined this list during the 1890s and formally included it in the SDA Yearbook in 1931 with 22 belief statements. In 1980, the Adventist Church officially adopted 27 Fundamental Beliefs, to which it added a 28th in 2005. White is referenced in Fundamental Belief 18 &quot;The Gift of Prophecy&quot;:

The Scriptures testify that one of the gifts of the Holy Spirit is prophecy. This gift is an identifying mark of the remnant church and we believe it was manifested in the ministry of Ellen G. White. Her writings speak with prophetic authority and provide comfort, guidance, instruction, and correction to the church. They also make clear that the Bible is the standard by which all teaching and experience must be tested. (Num. 12:6; 2 Chron. 20:20; Amos 3:7; Joel 2:28, 29; Acts 2:14-21; 2 Tim. 3:16, 17; Heb. 1:1-3; Rev. 12:17; 19:10; 22:8, 9.)Employing an expression found in Rev. 19:10, Adventists sometimes refer to White&#x27;s writings as the &quot;Spirit of Prophecy&quot;.

== Criticism ==

Roger Coon wrote a lecture arguing that certain followers of the religion were engaging in &quot;equal but opposite dangers&quot; in their view of White. He described one group that overdeified her, and one group that &quot;picks and chooses&quot; from what teachings they follow of hers.

Critics have voiced doubts as to the reliability of Ellen G. White as a prophetess and the authenticity of her visions. Ronald L. Numbers, an American historian of science, criticized White for her views on health and masturbation. Numbers argues that she plagiarized vitalist writers (such as Horace Mann and Larkin B. Coles) for her arguments against masturbation. White&#x27;s book &quot;Appeal to Mothers&quot; (republished later as &quot;A Solemn Appeal&quot; containing only texts written by her; adding to the confusion James White also published a book having the same title) states that she did not copy her text from the health reform advocates and that she independently reached such conclusions. Numbers&#x27; criticism was acknowledged as significant by the staff of the White Estate, which sought to refute it in &quot;A Critique of the Book Prophetess of Health&quot;, arguing that the similarities are due to supernatural inspiration influencing each of the authors.

Other critics have accused Ellen White of plagiarism. One such was Walter T. Rea, who argued against the &quot;original&quot; nature of her alleged revelations in his book &quot;The White Lie.&quot; In response, the White Estate released a document to refute claims presented in &quot;The White Lie.&quot;

Intellectual property attorney Vincent L. Ramik undertook a study of Ellen G. White&#x27;s writings during the early 1980s, and concluded that they were &quot;conclusively unplagiaristic.&quot; When the plagiarism charge ignited a significant debate during the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Adventist General Conference commissioned a major study by Fred Veltman to examine the issue of White&#x27;s literary dependence in writing on the life of Christ. The full 2,561-page report of the &quot;&#x27;Life of Christ Research Project&quot; is available online, along with an abridged version. A published, condensed edition appeared in 2023. Veltman examined fifteen, randomly selected chapters of &quot;The Desire of Ages&quot; for evidence of literary dependence and concluded, &quot;On an average we may say that 31.4 percent of the &quot;DA&quot; text is dependent to some extent on literary sources.&quot; Roger W. Coon, David J. Conklin, Denis Fortin, King and Morgan, among others, undertook the refutation of the accusations of plagiarism. At the conclusion of his report, Ramik states:

It is impossible to imagine that the intention of Ellen G. White, as reflected in her writings and the unquestionably prodigious efforts involved therein, was anything other than a sincerely motivated and unselfish effort to place the understandings of Biblical truths in a coherent form for all to see and comprehend. Most certainly, the nature and content of her writings had but one hope and intent, namely, the furthering of mankind&#x27;s understanding of the word of God. Considering all factors necessary in reaching a just conclusion on this issue, it is submitted that the writings of Ellen G. White were conclusively unplagiaristic.

Ramik cleared her of breaking the law of the land and time (copyright infringement/piracy). In 1911, more than 70 years before charges of plagiarism, White wrote in the introduction to &quot;The Great Controversy&quot; her reason for quoting, in some cases without giving due credit, certain historians whose &quot;statements afford a ready and forcible presentation on the subject.&quot; That means that she acknowledged the charges of “uncredited paraphrasing,” a common literary practice of her time. &quot;Spectrum&quot;, a liberal Adventist publication, highly critical of mainstream Adventism, claims that, due to the plagiarism scandal, &quot;at least the educated mainstream church&quot; (&quot;church&quot; meaning SDA church) no longer buys into the claim of White&#x27;s &quot;verbal inspiration&quot; made by some of her followers.

One of the earliest charges of plagiarism against Ellen White concerned her use of &quot;The Life and Epistles of St. Paul&quot; by W. J. Conybeare and J. S. Howson (1852) in writing &quot;Sketches From the Life of Paul&quot; (1883). The volume by Conybeare and Howson, published in the UK and copyrighted there, was later published without copyright in the US by T. Y. Crowell with the title (&quot;The&quot;) &quot;Life and Epistles of the Apostle Paul.&quot; At the time of her death, White had several copies of the Crowell publication in her library.

The public secular press accused Ellen G. White of extensive plagiarism, claiming that this was her general practice, and concluded that &quot;Mrs. White is a plagiarist, a literary thief.&quot;

<text>Kimmeridge () is a small village and civil parish on the Isle of Purbeck, a peninsula on the English Channel coast in Dorset, England. It is situated about south of Wareham and west of Swanage. In 2013 the estimated population of the civil parish was 90.

Kimmeridge is a coastal parish and its coastline forms part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site. The coast is also part of a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and the whole parish is in the Dorset National Landscape area.

Kimmeridge is the type locality for Kimmeridge Clay, the geological formation that covers most of the parish. Within the clay are bands of bituminous shale, which in the history of the village have been the focus of several attempts to create an industrial centre. An oil well has operated on the shore of Kimmeridge Bay since 1959. The village is the origin of the name of the Kimmeridgian stage of the Late Jurassic.

The roughly semi-circular Kimmeridge Bay is southwest of Kimmeridge village. It is backed by low cliffs of Kimmeridge clay, and beneath the cliffs is a large wave-cut platform and a rocky shore with rock pools and attendant ecology. Kimmeridge Bay is a surfer and diver area.

==History==
In the Iron Age and during the Roman occupation, ornaments and other objects were made from the black bituminous shale—known as blackstone or &#x27;Kimmeridge coal&#x27;—that occurs in layers within the Kimmeridge clay that covers most of Kimmeridge parish. Armlets were manufactured from the shale using a lathe, which produced waste in the form of hard black discs; these have been discovered at several sites, and were thought by 18th-century antiquaries to be coins and therefore called &#x27;coal money&#x27;. The Romans also used the shale as fuel for boiling sea water to produce salt.

In the medieval period there were three settlements within the parish: Kimmeridge, Little Kimmeridge, and Smedmore. These each had their own rectangular strip of land stretching between the coast and Smedmore Hill. Only Kimmeridge survives as a settlement of any size.

In the mid 16th century Lord Mountjoy attempted to make alum here and acquired a patent to do so, though the enterprise was unsuccessful. In the first half of the 17th century Sir William Clavell made several unsuccessful efforts to turn Kimmeridge into an industrial venture. He tried boiling seawater to make salt, using the shale as fuel as the Romans had done. He then followed in Mountjoy&#x27;s footsteps and founded an alum works, though he failed to secure a patent and ran foul of alum merchants in London who had sole rights (granted by Charles I) to produce alum in England; the merchants took Clavell&#x27;s property and demanded £1,000 per year, then destroyed the works and stole Clavell&#x27;s cattle. Clavell took legal action but was unsuccessful. He then tried to turn Kimmeridge into a port, and finally tried to manufacture glass with assistance from Sir Robert Mansell and Abraham Bigo, but both these enterprises failed; the pier which Clavell built for the port became ruinous and was destroyed by a storm in 1745.

Clavell had Smedmore House built less than a mile south-east of Kimmeridge village; referring to it as his &quot;little newe House&quot;, he moved into it on its completion in 1632. Previously Clavell lived at Barnston Manor, near the neighbouring village of Church Knowle.

In the mid 19th century the shale was used a source of oil, and in 1847 an Act of Parliament enabled causeways, inclined planes and tramways to be built so the shale could be transported to Weymouth for processing into various petroleum-based products, including varnish, pitch, naptha, and dyes. Gas was also extracted from the shale, though like the oil it burned with a strong sulphurous smell, which limited its suitability as a domestic fuel and prevented fulfilment of a contract to supply gas to Paris for lighting.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution stationed a lifeboat at Kimmeridge in 1868 but it was removed in 1896.

In 1959 an oil well was installed above the cliffs west of Gaulter Gap, overlooking Kimmeridge Bay. Comprising a nodding donkey pump that lifts crude oil from several hundred feet below the surface, in its early years it pumped more than 100,000 gallons per week, producing a total of 200,000 tonnes between 1961 and 1974.
==Governance==
For elections to the UK parliament, Kimmeridge is in the South Dorset parliamentary constituency.

In local government, Kimmeridge is in the Dorset unitary authority area at the highest tier. Kimmeridge is part of the South East Purbeck ward which elects 1 member to Dorset Council. At the lower tier, Kimmeridge is a civil parish which has a Parish Meeting.

Under former systems of local government, Kimmeridge was in Hasler Hundred until the 19th century, the Wareham and Purbeck Rural District from 1894 to 1974, and Purbeck District from 1974 to 2019.

==Geography==
Kimmeridge village is sited beside a small stream on a roughly southwest-facing slope between the English Channel coast less than to the southwest and a curving line of hills immediately to the north and east. Measured directly it is about west of Swanage, south of Wareham and east of Weymouth. Kimmeridge civil parish covers land south and east of Kimmeridge village; it is bounded by the village stream and the copses of Higher and Lower Stonehips to the northwest, Smedmore Hill and the summit of Swyre Head to the northeast, field boundaries beyond Swalland Farm to the southeast, and the coastline between Rope Lake Head and Gaulter Gap to the southwest. The neighbouring parishes are Corfe Castle to the southeast, Church Knowle to the east, and Steeple to the north; this last parish includes the western half of Kimmeridge Bay and land very close to Kimmeridge village.
Kimmeridge civil parish has several protected landscape designations covering it either in whole or part. Its coastline forms part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site that was designated in 2001 due to the global significance of its geological features and earth science interest. The coast at Kimmeridge also forms part of the South Dorset Coast Site of Special Scientific Interest. All of Kimmeridge parish is within the Dorset National Landscape (formerly &quot;Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty&quot;), which is a national designation that signifies the highest level of protection in relation to landscape scenic beauty. All the buildings in Kimmeridge village are within the Kimmeridge Conservation Area, which was created by the local planning authority in 1975 because of the historic and architectural interest of the village. Over of the coast and underwater environment at Kimmeridge Bay are designated as the Purbeck Marine Wildlife Reserve, the UK&#x27;s oldest Voluntary Marine Nature Reserve; although offering no legal wildlife protection, there is a visitor centre beside Kimmeridge Bay.
===Geology===
The geology of Kimmeridge civil parish comprises bedrock formed in the Late Jurassic epoch, overlain in many places by superficial Quaternary head deposits. The bedrock is mostly Kimmeridge clay, except for the top of Smedmore Hill and along to Swyre Head, which is formed from Portland stone. Between this and the Kimmeridge clay, and outcropping just beneath the top of the hill, is a thin band of Portland sand. Landslip deposits from the Portland stone cover most of the steep southwest-facing slopes of the hills. Within the Kimmeridge clay are bands of bituminous shale and dolomite, which form flat ledges within Kimmeridge Bay that are exposed at low tide.

Kimmeridge gives its name to the Kimmeridgian, the division of the Jurassic period in which the beds were laid down, because of the quality of the cliffs and the fossils they yield. Kimmeridge is also the type locality for the Jurassic age Kimmeridge Clay formation, which is well represented in southern England, and provides one of the source rocks for hydrocarbons found in the Wessex and North Sea Basins.

The Kimmeridge Oil Field is northwest of Kimmeridge Bay. On the cliff west of the village is the Perenco &quot;nodding donkey&quot; oil pump which has been pumping continually since the late 1950s, making it the oldest working oil pump in the UK. The well currently yields around from the Middle Jurassic strata that lie around below the cliff. The well has been operating for this long because it has tapped into a network of connected reserves; however the yield is decreasing year on year. The oil is transported by tanker to the Perenco site at Wytch Farm from whence it is piped to the main refinery on Southampton Water.

==Demography==
In 2013 the estimated population of Kimmeridge civil parish was 90.

In the 2001 census Kimmeridge parish had 55 dwellings and a population of 110.

In the 2011 census results have been published for Kimmeridge parish combined with the neighbouring parishes of Steeple and Tyneham; this combined area contained 101 dwellings and had 87 households with a population of 206.

==Notable buildings==

Within Kimmeridge parish there are twenty-five structures that have been listed by Historic England for their historic or architectural interest. None has been listed as Grade I, but Smedmore House is Grade II*.

Along the shore immediately eastwards of Kimmeridge Bay (above Hen Cliff) is a folly known as Clavell Tower which inspired P.D. James&#x27;s novel &quot;The Black Tower&quot;. It had been in danger of falling down the eroding cliff, so recently the tower was dismantled and then reassembled further back from the cliff edge. The tower is available as a holiday let.

The parish church was mostly rebuilt in 1872, though it has 12th-century origins; the south door and parts of the west wall of the nave are still original. The south porch is early 13th century and the bell-cote is 15th century.

==The Etches Collection==

In 2014 £2.7 million was secured from the Heritage Lottery Fund for the purpose of creating a new museum in Kimmeridge, on the site of the old village hall. The project cost a total of £5 million and also houses conservation workshops and a new village hall and community space with a capacity for 120 people. The museum, called the Museum of Jurassic Marine Life, displays the Etches Collection of over 2,000 fossils collected over 30 years by village resident Steve Etches. The museum opened in October 2016.

==Surfing==
Kimmeridge Bay is a surfing area which breaks infrequently due to its lack of exposure to Atlantic swells, but can produce walls of water when it is &#x27;on&#x27;. Below the cliffs to the East is &#x27;The Ledges&#x27;, with slow left- and right-hand breaking waves; the right-handers can spiral for or more into the bay. To the West is &#x27;Broad Bench&#x27;, within the Ministry of Defence firing range and only accessible when the ranges are open to the public.

<doc id="271786" wikidata="Q1515967" url="?curid=271786" title="Meliorism">
<text>Meliorism (Latin &quot;melior&quot;, better) is the idea that progress is a real concept and that humans can interfere with natural processes in order to improve the world.

Meliorism, as a conception of the person and society, is at the foundation of contemporary liberal democracy and human rights and is a basic component of liberalism.

Another important understanding of the meliorist tradition comes from the American Pragmatic tradition. One can read about it in the works of Lester Frank Ward, William James, and John Dewey. In James&#x27; works, however, meliorism does not pinpoint to progressivism and/or optimism. For James, meliorism stands in the middle between optimism and pessimism, and treats the salvation of the world as a probability rather than a certainty or impossibility. In the case of a meliorist praxis, the activist contemporary of the Pragmatists Jane Addams stripped progressive ideals of any elitist privilege calling for a &quot;lateral progress&quot; whose concern was squarely with the common people.

Meliorism has also been used by Arthur Caplan to describe positions in bioethics that are in favor of ameliorating conditions which cause suffering, even if the conditions have long existed (e.g. being in favor of cures for common diseases, being in favor of serious anti-aging therapies as they are developed).

A closely related concept discussed by Jean-Jacques Rousseau and Marquis de Condorcet is that of perfectibility of man. 

Condorcet&#x27;s statement, &quot;Such is the object of the work I have undertaken; the result of which will be to show, from reasoning and from facts, that no bounds have been fixed to the improvement of the human faculties; that the &quot;perfectibility of man&quot; is absolutely indefinite; that the progress of this perfectibility, henceforth above the control of every power that would impede it, has no other limit than the duration of the globe upon which nature has placed us.&quot; anticipates James&#x27; meliorism.

Rousseau&#x27;s treatment is somewhat weaker.

Modern thinkers in this tradition are Hans Rosling and Max Roser. Roser expressed a melioristic position in the mission statement for Our World in Data. He said that all three statements are true at the same time &quot;The world is much better. The world is awful. The world can be much better.&quot; Like William James before him Rosling held a halfway position between optimism and pessimism that emphasized humanity&#x27;s capacity to improve their world.
