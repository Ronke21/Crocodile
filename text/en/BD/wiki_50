<text>Sir Jonathan Wolfe Miller CBE (21 July 1934 – 27 November 2019) was an English theatre and opera director, actor, author, television presenter, comedian and physician. After training in medicine and specialising in neurology in the late 1950s, he came to prominence in the early 1960s in the comedy revue &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot; with Peter Cook, Dudley Moore and Alan Bennett.

Miller began directing operas in the 1970s. His 1982 production of a &quot;Mafia&quot;-styled &quot;Rigoletto&quot; was set in 1950s Little Italy, Manhattan. In its early days, he was an associate director at the National Theatre. He later ran the Old Vic Theatre. As a writer and presenter of more than a dozen BBC documentaries, Miller became a television personality and public intellectual in Britain and the United States.

==Life and career==

=== Early life ===
Miller grew up in St John&#x27;s Wood, London, in a well-connected Jewish family. His father Emanuel (1892–1970), who was of Lithuanian descent and suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis, was a military psychiatrist and subsequently a paediatric psychiatrist at Harley House. His mother, Betty Miller (née Spiro) (1910–1965), was a novelist and biographer who was originally from County Cork, Ireland. Miller had an elder sister, Sarah (died 2006) who worked in television for many years and retained an involvement with Judaism that Miller, as an atheist, always eschewed. As a child Miller had a stammer and was attention-seeking, compensating for his stammer by speaking in foreign accents. He also developed an astonishing talent for mimicry, including chickens and steamtrains. The young Miller was assessed by several child psychiatrists, including Donald Winnicott. He had many sessions, as a teenager with the psychiatrist Leopold Stein. Miller enjoyed the sessions and said that they &quot;simply conversed about philosophy and Hughlings Jackson&#x27;s early neurological theories&quot;.

Miller moved between several different schools prior to attending Taunton School, including for a time at the Rudolf Steiner School Kings Langley (a Waldorf school) where he was taught by two of Ivy Compton-Burnett&#x27;s sisters and says of that time that he &quot;never learnt anything at all&quot;. Miller concluded his secondary school education at St Paul&#x27;s School, London where he developed an early (and ultimately lifelong) interest in the biological sciences. While at St Paul&#x27;s School at the age of 12, Miller met and became close friends with Oliver Sacks and Sacks&#x27;s best friend Eric Korn, friendships which remained crucial throughout the rest of their lives. In 1953, before leaving secondary school, he performed comedy several times on the BBC radio programme &quot;Under Twenty Parade&quot;. Miller studied natural sciences and medicine at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge (MB BChir, 1959), where he was a member of the Cambridge Apostles and one of cast’s three Granta cartoonist, before going on to train at University College Hospital in London.

While studying medicine, Miller was involved in the Cambridge Footlights, appearing in the revues &quot;Out of the Blue&quot; (1954) and &quot;Between the Lines&quot; (1955). Good reviews for these shows, and for Miller&#x27;s performances in particular, led to his performing on a number of radio and television shows while continuing his studies; these included appearances on &quot;Saturday Night on the Light&quot;, &quot;Tonight&quot; and &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot;. He qualified as a physician in 1959 and then worked as a hospital house officer for two years, including at the Central Middlesex Hospital as house physician for gastroenterologist Francis Avery Jones.

===1960s: &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;===

Miller helped to write and produce the satirical revue &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, which premiered at the Edinburgh Festival in August 1960. This launched, in addition to his own, the careers of Alan Bennett, Peter Cook and Dudley Moore. Miller quit the show shortly after its move from London to Broadway in 1962, and took over as editor and presenter of the BBC&#x27;s arts programme &quot;Monitor&quot; in 1965. The &quot;Monitor&quot; appointment arose because Miller had approached Huw Wheldon about taking up a place on the BBC&#x27;s director training course. Wheldon assured him that he would &quot;pick it up as he went along&quot;.

Miller&#x27;s first experience of directing a stage play was for John Osborne, whose &quot;Under Plain Cover&quot; he directed in 1962. In 1964, he directed the play &quot;The Old Glory&quot; by the American poet Robert Lowell in New York City. It was the first play produced at the American Place Theatre and starred Frank Langella, Roscoe Lee Brown, and Lester Rawlins. The play won five Obie Awards in 1965 including an award for &quot;Best American Play&quot; as well as awards for Langella, Brown and Rawlins.

He wrote, produced, and directed an adaptation for television of &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; (1966) for the BBC. He followed this with &quot;Whistle and I&#x27;ll Come to You&quot; (1968) starring Michael Hordern, a television adaptation of M. R. James&#x27;s 1904 ghost story &quot;Oh, Whistle, and I&#x27;ll Come to You, My Lad&quot;. He produced a National Theatre Company production of &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; starring Laurence Olivier. He later resigned as associate director.

===1970s: Medical history and opera===
Miller held a research fellowship in the history of medicine at University College London from 1970 to 1973. In 1974, he also started directing and producing operas for Kent Opera and Glyndebourne, followed by a new production of &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot; for English National Opera in 1978. Miller&#x27;s other turns as an opera director included productions of &quot;Rigoletto&quot; (in 1975 and 1982) and the operetta &quot;The Mikado&quot; (in 1987).

Miller drew upon his own experiences as a physician, writer and presenter of the BBC television series &quot;The Body in Question&quot; (1978). The series was nominated for two 1979 BAFTAs: Best Factual Television Series and Most Original Programme/Series and caused some controversy for showing the dissection of a cadaver. For a time, he was a vice-president of the Campaign for Homosexual Equality. In 1971, he defended multiracial immigration to the UK at length with Enoch Powell on &quot;The Dick Cavett Show&quot;.

===1980s: Shakespeare and neuropsychology===
In 1980, Miller was persuaded to join the troubled &quot;BBC Television Shakespeare&quot; project (1978–85). He became a producer (1980–82) and directed six of the plays himself, beginning with a well-received &quot;Taming of the Shrew&quot; starring John Cleese. In the early 1980s, Miller was a popular and frequent guest on PBS&#x27; &quot;Dick Cavett Show&quot;.

Miller wrote and presented the BBC television series, and accompanying book, &quot;States of Mind&quot; in 1983 and the same year directed Roger Daltrey as Macheath, the outlaw hero of the BBC&#x27;s production of John Gay&#x27;s 1728 ballad opera, &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot;. He also became chair of Edinburgh Festival Fringe board of directors. In 1984, he studied neuropsychology with Dr. Sandra Witelson at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, before becoming a neuropsychology research fellow at the University of Sussex the following year.

===1990s===
In 1990, Miller wrote and presented a joint BBC/Canadian production titled, &quot;Born Talking: A Personal Inquiry into Language&quot;. The four-part series looked into the acquisition of language, and complexities surrounding language production, with a special focus on sign language used by deaf people. This interest was contemporaneous with his friend Oliver Sacks&#x27; immersion in, and writing/publishing a book about Deaf Culture and deaf people entitled &quot;Seeing Voices.&quot; Miller then wrote and presented the television series &quot;Madness&quot; (1991) and &quot;Jonathan Miller on Reflection&quot; (1998). The five-part &quot;Madness&quot; series ran on PBS in 1991. It featured a brief history of madness and interviews with psychiatric researchers, clinical psychiatrists, and patients in therapy sessions. In 1992, Opera Omaha staged the United States premiere of the Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s 1819 opera &quot;Ermione&quot;, directed by Miller.

===2000s: Atheism and return to directing===
In 2002 Miller directed Cosi fan tutte at Rønne Theater (1813) in Rønne, Bornholm in Denmark. In 2004, Miller wrote and presented a television series on atheism entitled &quot;&quot; (more commonly referred to as &quot;Jonathan Miller&#x27;s Brief History of Disbelief&quot;) for BBC Four, exploring the roots of his own atheism and investigating the history of atheism in the world. Individual conversations, debates and discussions for the series that could not be included due to time constraints were aired in a six-part series entitled &quot;The Atheism Tapes&quot;. He also appeared on a BBC Two programme in February 2004, called &quot;What the World Thinks of God&quot; appearing from New York. The original three-part series aired on public television in the United States in 2007.

In 2007, Miller directed &quot;The Cherry Orchard&quot; at The Crucible, Sheffield, his first work on the British stage for 10 years. He also directed Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; in Manchester and Bristol, and &quot;Der Rosenkavalier&quot; in Tokyo and gave talks throughout Britain during 2007 called &quot;An Audience with Jonathan Miller&quot; in which he spoke about his life for an hour and then fielded questions from the audience. He also curated an exhibition on camouflage at the Imperial War Museum. He appeared at the Royal Society of the Arts in London discussing humour (4 July 2007) and at the British Library on religion (3 September 2007).

In January 2009, after a break of 12 years, Miller returned to the English National Opera to direct his own production of &quot;La bohème&quot;, notable for its 1930s setting. This same production ran at the Cincinnati Opera in July 2010, also directed by Miller.

===2010s===

On 15 September 2010, Miller, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s state visit to the UK. In April and May 2011, Miller directed Verdi&#x27;s &quot;La traviata&quot; in Vancouver, Canada, and in February and March 2012, Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Così fan tutte&quot; in Washington, D.C.

On 25 November 2015, the University of London awarded Miller an honorary degree in Literature.

===Personal life===
Miller married Rachel Collet in 1956. They had two sons and a daughter. From 1961 to his death he lived on Gloucester Crescent in Camden Town, north London. On 27 November 2019, Miller died at the age of 85, having been diagnosed with Alzheimer&#x27;s in 2017. His ashes were interred on the eastern side of Highgate Cemetery, opposite the grave of Karl Marx, on 21 October 2022.

==Parodies and representations==
* Stevie Smith, a friend of his mother Betty Miller, &quot;rather disloyally&quot; included a thinly disguised and uncomplimentary version of the nine-year-old Miller, &quot;precocious and brattish... constantly demanding attention&quot;, in her short story &#x27;Beside the Seaside: A Holiday with Children&#x27; (1949).

<doc id="262780" wikidata="Q1942004" url="?curid=262780" title="Modern Jive">
<text>Modern Jive is a dance style derived from swing, Lindy Hop, rock and roll, salsa and various other dance styles, the main difference being the simplification of footwork by removing syncopation such as chasse. The term &quot;French Jive&quot; is occasionally used instead, reflecting the origins of the style, as is the term &quot;Smooth Jive&quot;. The word &quot;modern&quot; distinguishes it from ballroom Jive.

==History==
Modern Jive was developed in the United Kingdom during the 1980s at three London clubs: Ceroc, Le Roc, and Cosmopolitan Jive. The style was based on a type of Jive that evolved in France after World War II when American dances such as the jitterbug were popular due to the presence of the American military.

Modern Jive was not created in France, but its origin owes something to the French version of Le Bop. The dance commonly known as Modern Jive is different from Le Bop, a high tempo dance. Michel Ange Lau played a major role in the change from Le Bop to Modern Jive at a club called Centre Charles Peguy). Two British people, James Cronin and Christine Keeble, saw Le Bop in France and wanted to learn the dance when they returned to London. They were among Lau&#x27;s students. The style of music played at discos was changing, and high tempo dances like Rock and Roll and Le Bop were becoming less popular.

The change in music prompted the birth of Modern Jive; in 1980 Lau and the Le Bop dancers changed the timing of Le Bop, causing a revolution in the dance. This change in timing not only allowed Lau and his students to dance to a much larger variety of music but also to create more intricate moves.

== What is Modern Jive? ==
Modern Jive adapts moves from other dance styles such as West Coast Swing, Salsa, Ballroom and Latin. The key to understanding Modern Jive is the beginner moves. These 20-plus moves continually reinforce the absolutes to the dance. The consistencies allow modern jive dancers to dance together, despite their preferences.

== Modern Jive absolutes and consistencies ==
Due to Modern Jive&#x27;s unique timing it has the ability to be danced to a wide variety of tempos (extremes 60bpm - 180bpm, typically 110bpm - 140bpm, although this varies considerably with geography), and the dance is generally danced to 2 beats in 4. It&#x27;s danced to the stressed beats 1, 3, 5, &amp; 7; it&#x27;s on these beats the dancers are in position (moving through the less-stressed beats 2, 4, 6, &amp; 8), e.g. a classical Yo Yo has 8 positions danced to 16 beats of music.

The step back at the start of each move: this was derived from the Rock Step and changed to a simple step back when the timing changed. The step back creates the in &amp; out or concertina motion that many people consider to be an essential part of the dance style; both dancers step away from each other at the start of a move / pattern, to achieve tension and compression/extension in the connection point. This extension assists lead and follow technique, but perhaps more importantly the step back into extension is the consistent part that allows an infinite number of moves to be joined in any order, depending on which handhold or other connection the lead is using.

The follow&#x27;s right hand is key to the dance, each beginner move starts with the follow&#x27;s right hand (sometimes both hands), whenever the follow spins or the hand is released it&#x27;s the right hand that they need to offer.

The motion of the dance: for the majority of the beginner moves the follow steps in to the lead&#x27;s right side on count two (this is not always consistent at intermediate level moves, and the lead often signals with their right hand behind their back to bring the follow down the left side) e.g. Pretzel. (A lead technique can also be developed to bring the follow down the left hand side).

Off phrase dancing: Modern Jive is a &#x27;off phrase&#x27; dance. This means a move does not always have to start on a particular beat e.g. beat 1 or beat 2 (Cha Cha) of the music – this allows the massive flexibility, diversity, and high level of musicality that&#x27;s often seen in the dance. Moves often have varying numbers of beats to them, e.g. Catapult 8 counts (16 beats of music), Octopus 7 counts (14 beats of music).

== Modern Jive popular variants ==
===Dancing to slower tempos===
Slower tempos in Modern Jive (in some groups referred to as Modern Jive Blues) allows for more styling and musical interpretation. The slower tempo allows the follower to indicate when they want freestyle time, the dance can also use body leads at slower tempos and dancers often dance a lot closer. Dancing to slower music allows for a lot more two way communication, allowing more freedom, and music interpretation, however good Modern Jive dancers should be able to adapt their dancing and dance to a full spectrum of tempos. At higher tempos timing becomes more of a skill, where two way communication is reduced, at higher tempos musicality (e.g. hitting the music phrasing / breaks and interpreting the music), is more difficult to achieve as both dancers have to be in tune together but also with the music. Most dancers dancing Modern Jive Blues originate from Modern Jive and are familiar with Modern Jive Beginners moves and associated absolutes.

===Rotating slot===
In the classical form, Modern Jive naturally rotates (normally clockwise). This is due to 2 or 3 consistencies that can be seen in the beginner moves and more often than not in the intermediate moves. a) the follow continually steps into the leads right side, causing a clockwise rotation – rarely to the leads left side, b) Often on count three the follow is turned or spun clockwise (1st move basic, Yo Yo, Hatchback...), c) a lot of the beginner moves finish with an anti clockwise return – causing the follow to stabilise on the left foot stepping slightly to her left (clockwise), instead of directly back. This is Modern Jive danced in its natural form, and should not be confused with a really bad technique where the follow continually skips around the lead (also known as &#x27;Roundy Roundy&#x27; in the UK), despite his lead. This &#x27;Roundy Roundy&#x27; style is often found at higher tempos by inexperienced follow dancers and is totally different from the slightly rotating slot (of the natural dance).

===Slotted dancing===
Over roughly the last decade, Modern Jive has been influenced by West Coast Swing, an American partner dance developed from Lindy Hop with the addition of the &#x27;slot&#x27; meaning it is danced up and down an imaginary line. As WCS teaching tends to be more technique focused, it tends to attract experienced dancers from Modern Jive, who then bring elements of the dance back into M-J. The slot concept is one that has taken a hold in Modern Jive and is now very often taught even from beginner level, although more commonly in the Ceroc franchise venues and other groups that run competitions, than independents such as LeRoc.

Dancing slotted allows the follow (and lead) to always complete a full turn, which helps to avoid dizziness, and has many other technical advantages. However, some dancers find that at high tempos (140BPM and above) it is easier to abandon the slot and revert to a rotational style. These dancers find that many of the older Modern Jive moves done in the classical form, such as the YoYo, the Catapult and the Push Spin work better at higher tempos, and are less suitable for slow tempos (100BPM or lower) where other moves and a more elastic style of dancing are more appropriate.

When Modern Jive tends to be danced rotationally, it is still often taught on stage in two directions, to allow large classes to observe the instruction and instructors often compensate to be seen. In these classes, directional leads are often not taught effectively at beginner level (even at intermediate level), and so as soon as the class goes to freestyle dancing the dancers start to rotate in a rotating slot style. For these groups, dancing in the slot is an advanced technique / preference that can be developed and adds another dimension to Modern Jive, and it also looks impressive when a group of dancers are dancing slotted in the same area in the same direction.

Where Modern Jive tends to be danced slotted by default, slotted dancing tends to be taught rather more effectively, and it&#x27;s reinforced in social dancing where it is possible to pack many more people onto a dance floor more safely if they are all dancing slotted. These groups have also tended to modify older moves slightly from the classical form, in order to take advantage of the known direction of momentum and other technical advantages of the slotted form.

===Presenting forward / blocking===
Presenting forward is a skill often developed by professionals, competition dancers and showcase dancers and requires further skills and additional techniques. Here the dancers develop the skill of presenting in one consistent direction (usually forward or towards an audience as compared to facing each other). Dips, drops, poses, exiting moves / lifts and even smiling consistently in one direction in order to present the best possible picture to spectators, judges and/or audiences are all factors.

== Branding ==
The term &quot;Modern Jive&quot; was coined in 1990 by Christine Keeble on a program called &#x27;How to Jive&#x27;, designed to promulgate this new style of jive. At that time the dance was known variously as Ceroc, LeRoc, or French Jive. Christine Keeble used the term &#x27;modern jive&#x27; to encompass all of these names.

The term &#x27;modern jive&#x27; was adopted, despite the absence of chasse or triple step (typical of &quot;real&quot; jive forms). Various clubs used the umbrella term as the dance spread out from its two earliest centres of London and Bristol and it later became accepted as a generic term for the dance. It is now used by a large number of independent teachers across the UK and internationally. It is also used by many of the franchise operators, although these companies often still prefer to use their own branding.

== Organizations ==
In the English-speaking world, Modern Jive classes and events are often franchised or run under various brand names, including, Jive Addiction, Blitz, DanceJive, ViBe Dance Nights, &quot;Revolution Dance&quot; Northwest, Ceroc, LeRoc, Ginger Jive, Mo&#x27;Jive, Cloud9, Jiveasy, South Coast Modern Jive, The Thing, in New Zealand under Move Dance Ltd and others. Beyond the bounds of the English-speaking world, modern jive has still to make a significant impact. In Europe there are JiveNation Poland in Poland, M-Jive and Jive.Berlin in Germany and Leroc Zürich and Modern Jive Zürich in Switzerland which are slowly bringing the dance style to a wider audience.

Following a different but similar evolutionary path, dance styles such as Discofox (in Germany and Switzerland and derived from Foxtrott ) and Bugg (found in Sweden) may sometimes be indistinguishable from the Modern Jive found in the UK and elsewhere in Europe.

==Dance moves==
While these forms of Modern Jive have Swing and Rock-and-Roll dance moves in common, moves from many forms of dance including Salsa and Tango may be included, according to the specific franchise or even the particular dance teacher. Because of its eclectic nature there are hundreds of moves and variations that can be learnt, introduced or adapted.

Although dance routines are developed and rehearsed for competitions, Modern Jive is most frequently danced freestyle, providing additional challenges to more advanced dancers in terms of musical interpretation and expression; which is why some Modern Jive dancers prefer Blues Music, drawing out the move and allowing the follow to improvise and partake in the dance (as opposed to being dragged around the floor).

===Move naming===
Different franchises or teachers often have different names for identical moves, and different signals to indicate the next move. The &quot;Man&#x27;s Spin&quot; taught at one venue may be identical to the &quot;Man&#x27;s Pass&quot; taught by a different venue. Due to its origins, Modern Jive moves may be similar to moves from other dance styles; the &quot;First Move Triple Steps&quot; in Modern Jive is similar to the Lindy Hop &quot;Jockey&quot;, for example. Despite this there is rarely a problem dancing with people who have been taught other styles, at least with the less advanced moves. A solid lead is better than using a signal (which may only be suited to one dance style); thus allowing good follows to dance regardless of the learning style.

===Lead variations===
Like many Western partner dances, Modern Jive is most often a male-led dance. The gender of the lead is irrelevant to the technique required, however many moves are more easily led by a taller lead on a shorter follow, and thus a shorter lead will need to modify their lead and the move to allow for the differences in angle, or choose different moves that are more easily led by them.

Modern Jive is also occasionally danced by three dancers, with one lead and two followers (a variant known as &quot;Double Trouble&quot; in the UK or &quot;Triples&quot; in Australia/New Zealand).

It can also be danced with two leads smoothly and continuously swapping with each other to dance with one follow, or two follows doing the same with one lead (known in the UK as &quot;Tag&quot;, and in Australia/New Zealand as &quot;Swaps &#x27;n&#x27; Steals&quot;)

=== Step footwork vs rock footwork ===
Many of the Australian offshoots of Ceroc transitioned to a footwork coined &quot;Step&quot; in about 1995.

The original &quot;rock&quot; footwork specifies a step back with either foot, transferring the weight to the moved foot on each of the odd numbered beats (1, 3, 5, 7) The moved foot is returned to its starting position on the even beats. (2, 4, 6, 8).

&quot;Step&quot; footwork specifies that the leader takes a step back with the right foot on the half beat or &quot;and&quot; count and &quot;closes&quot;, stepping backwards with the left foot on the numbered count. &quot;closing&quot; implies that the feet end up close together. On the next count the leader steps forward with their right foot on the &quot;and&quot; count and closes with their left on the numbered count. The follower mirrors this by stepping back on their left and &quot;closing&quot; with their right and then stepping forward with their left and closing with their right.

Rock footwork was originally offered as a &quot;beginner&quot; footwork in Australia. More recently it has been dropped. The reason for it being dropped is pedagogical. The problem appeared to be that the transition from beginner to intermediate dancer (so-called) meant one had to &quot;unlearn&quot; one and then &quot;re-learn&quot; another rhythm and weight change components of the dance. Unfortunately, the &quot;rock&quot; footwork is actually more suited to fast music (leaning towards &quot;advanced&quot; dancers) as it reduces the number of weight changes required during any rhythm unit. Thus, the preference for &quot;step&quot; footwork has reduced the &quot;terminal velocity&quot; modern jive can be danced at - because it forces a weight change every beat.

==Music==
Modern Jive is generally danced to music with four beats to the bar (Quadruple or Common time), from latest chart hits to big band music and everything between, in a wide variety of tempos from slow to very fast. Some teachers or franchises may concentrate on particular musical styles, such as swing. Move Dance (NZ), for example, focuses on a fusion of rock n roll and salsa, catering to a target age group of 40-70. Music is typically between 108 and 160 bpm. Experienced jivers occasionally dance to music outside those broad constraints.

== Weekenders ==
Around the world there are a number of &quot;weekenders&quot; (short dance-focused holidays, typically running from Friday - Monday) running annually.

Jive Time originally started weekenders in the UK but now Ceroc run the majority of the weekenders; with independent organisers still running a number of other weekender events, such as the Jive Addiction, Jive Time or MJ Roc events.

== Competitions ==
Modern Jive competitions are typically judged based on the following criteria:
* Musicality
* Content and execution
* Style and technique
* Presentation

Depending on how the scoring is done, the judges may award marks for each of these, or may just give an overall mark or place, based on considering each of these factors.

<text>SkyOS is a discontinued prototype commercial, proprietary, graphical desktop operating system written for the x86 computer architecture. Its first version was released in 1997, and its last beta build was released in 2008.

As of January 30, 2009, development of the OS was halted, with no plans to resume its development.

In August 2013, developer Robert Szeleney announced the release of a public beta on the SkyOS website. This allows public users to download a Live CD of the SkyOS operating system, for testing and to optionally install the system.

== History ==

Development started in 1996, with the first version released in December 1997.
Up until version 4.x, the OS was freely available. Starting with beta development of SkyOS 5 in 2003, users were required to pay US$30 to get access to beta releases.
SkyOS adapted new filesystem SkyFS based on OpenBFS in 2004, and its graphics subsystem was improved in 2006 with support for desktop compositing, including double buffering and transparency. The OS also moved to ELF binaries then.
The last beta build 6947 was released in August 2008, and there was no status update for several months.
As the OS was mainly the work of one man, Robert Szeleney, there was increasing difficulty to add new device drivers.
Considering lack of development under Robert Szeleney, going open source was viewed by the tech press as the best option for SkyOS.
Although Szeleney tried to bypass the lack of drivers by using a new kernel based on Linux or NetBSD, and reported some progress in this regard, development has not resumed.
SkyOS website disappeared in 2013 and final public build from August 2008 was released for free shortly thereafter.

== Features ==


SkyOS is a Unix-like operating system with a monolithic kernel.
The OS supports multiple users and symmetric multiprocessing.

SkyOS has an integrated graphics subsystem with support for desktop compositing including double buffering and transparency. SkyOS GUI also allows system-wide mouse gestures.

SkyFS is a fork of the OpenBFS filesystem.

SkyOS can also be run from the following filesystems:

* FAT32/FAT16/FAT12
* ISO 9660

SkyOS offers real-time file content query searches with multiple keywords (comparable to Beagle in Linux or Spotlight in macOS), including indexing of files and programs.

== Applications ==

Most command-line applications that were written to be compiled with the GNU Toolchain can be ported to SkyOS with little or no modification.

SkyOS contains several frameworks for creating applications (including Mono port). Ported applications include Mozilla Firefox, Mozilla Thunderbird, Nvu, GIMP and AbiWord. There was also a monetary incentive for porting applications as the SkyOS community voted for desired programs and then supported developers with donations.

== Reception ==

Although SkyOS includes many interesting features, limited application and hardware support are among its weaknesses (e.g. only a few graphics cards allow 2D acceleration).
Kernel and drivers updates were solely worked on by Szeleney, and because of this he was unable to keep up with new devices. This was one of the reasons the development ended for this project. In the end, the OS was not able to expand beyond a small albeit dedicated user community. Apart from a short early open source time period, the OS had a proprietary licence with a commercial model based on paid beta-testing. This led to some controversy as SkyOS developers were accused of unauthorized use of open source software. No proof of any wrongdoing was given, but the public image of the OS was tarnished nevertheless.

<doc id="262784" wikidata="Q709473" url="?curid=262784" title="Wu Guanzheng">
<text>Wu Guanzheng (born 11 August 1938), also spelled as Wu Kuan-cheng is a former Chinese politician and one of the major leaders of the Chinese Communist Party during the administration of Hu Jintao. He served on the Politburo Standing Committee, the country&#x27;s top ruling body, from 2002 to 2007. During that time he also served as the Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection of the Chinese Communist Party, the party&#x27;s anti-graft body. He had a lengthy political career, having served as mayor of Wuhan, Governor then Party Secretary of Jiangxi, then party chief of Shandong. Wu retired in 2007 and left public life.

==Career==
Wu was born in Yugan County, Jiangxi province to a poor peasant family. He joined the Chinese Communist Party in March 1963. Wu graduated from the department of thermal engineering at Beijing&#x27;s Tsinghua University in 1968, where he studied thermal measurement and automated controls. He was then sent to Wuhan during the Cultural Revolution to work as a shop floor technician at the Gedian Chemical Engineering factory, where he was promoted to supervisor a few years later.

Wu served as the mayor of Wuhan from 1983 to 1986. He became the governor of his native province Jiangxi in 1986 after the removal of Ni Xiance by the provincial People&#x27;s Congress. He was later promoted to Jiangxi party chief and served between 1995 and 1997. He moved to Shandong in 1997 to become the party chief of the province and was made a full member of the Politburo the same year. It was said that Zeng Qinghong, a major confidant of then party General Secretary and President Jiang Zemin, was fond of Wu&#x27;s work, and recommended him for further elevation, resulting in his promotion to the Politburo in 1997.

Thereafter, Wu was known to have cultivated good relationships with both Jiang Zemin and his putative successor Hu Jintao. Wu and Hu graduated in the same year, both of them alumni of Tsinghua University. Some sources considered him to be Hu&#x27;s ally, while other consider him to be Jiang&#x27;s. As a result, he was sometimes included in the list of people in the Shanghai clique. In 2002, Wu joined the Politburo Standing Committee as the head of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, the party&#x27;s anti-graft agency. Wu was seen as an easy compromise candidate since he had &quot;cross-factional appeal&quot;. During Wu&#x27;s time in office on leading CCDI, Shanghai Party Secretary Chen Liangyu has been investigated and arrested by CCDI.

Wu Guanzheng retired from Standing Committee and Central Commission for Discipline Inspection after the 17th Party Congress in October 2007.

<doc id="262785" wikidata="Q621861" url="?curid=262785" title="Puffbird">
<text>The puffbirds and their relatives in the family Bucconidae are tropical tree-dwelling insectivorous birds that are found from South America up to Mexico. Together with their closest relatives, the jacamars, they form a divergent lineage within the order Piciformes, though the two families are sometimes elevated to a separate order Galbuliformes. Lacking the iridescent colours of the jacamars, puffbirds are mainly brown, rufous or grey, with large heads, large eyes, and flattened bills with a hooked tip. Their loose, abundant plumage and short tails makes them look stout and puffy, giving rise to the English name of the family. The species range in size from the rufous-capped nunlet, at and , to the white-necked puffbird, at up to and .

==Taxonomy==
Puffbirds get their common name from their fluffy plumage. In Spanish, they have been nicknamed &quot;bobo&quot; (&quot;dummy&quot;) from their propensity to sit motionless waiting for prey. American naturalist Thomas Horsfield defined the Bucconidae in 1821. The family was classified as part of the Piciformes by Alexander Wetmore in his work &quot;A Systematic Classification for the Birds of the World&quot; (1930, revised in 1951 and 1960). The placement of the combined puffbird and jacamar lineage was in question, with some bone and muscle features suggesting they may be more closely related to the Coraciiformes. Analysis of nuclear DNA in a 2003 study placed them as sister group to the rest of the Piciformes, also showing that the groups had developed zygodactyl feet (two toes facing forward and two aft) before separating. Per Ericson and colleagues, in analysing genomic DNA, confirmed that puffbirds and jacamars were sister groups and their place in Piciformes. The lineage is sometimes elevated to order level as Galbuliformes, first proposed by Sibley and Ahlquist in 1990.

The phylogenetic relationship between the puffbirds and the eight other families that make up the order Piciformes is shown in the cladogram below. The number of species in each family is taken from the list maintained by Frank Gill, Pamela C. Rasmussen and David Donsker on behalf of the International Ornithological Committee (IOC).

Molecular investigation of the Bucconidae in 2004 indicated that the nunlets (genus &quot;Nonnula&quot;) diverged from the common ancestor of other puffbirds an estimated 25 million years ago, with the genus &quot;Malacoptila&quot; the next to branch off around 19.1 million years ago. A fossil right wing recovered from Lower Eocene beds in Lincoln County, Wyoming, was initially classified as a puffbird and given the name &quot;Primobucco mcgrewi&quot;. The discovery of more complete specimens, including twelve in 2010, shows that &quot;Primobucco&quot; was instead an early type of roller.

==Distribution and habitat==
Puffbirds are found from Mexico to southern Brazil, with the greatest variety of species found in the Amazon Basin. They live in forested or wooded habitats, including lowland, foothills, and open woodland. The white-faced nunbird is the only member of this species known to live in highlands. The swallow-winged puffbird also lives in more open country. No species of puffbirds have been recorded of moving any significant distance beyond its home territory.

==Description==
Generally dull-plumaged birds, puffbirds may have brightly colored bills, eyebrows and irises. They have large heads, short wings and strong bills, with short legs and diminutive feet. There is some sexual dimorphism; the female is slightly larger and slightly duller-plumaged than the male. Juvenile birds have shorter beaks.

=== Voice ===
Puffbirds are one of the most silent birds in the Neotropics and vocalize very rarely. The most vocal species are the nunbirds and those in the genus &quot; Nystalus&quot;. When calling they mostly do so at dawn and dusk. The main vocalizations consist of repeated and high-pitched whistles. The nunbirds are the most vocal of the family; they have a wide repertoire of calls and often give very loud shouts.

== Behavior ==
Puffbirds are by nature arboreal. Mostly secretive, they are found singly or in small family groups. Species of the genus &quot;Monasa&quot;, known as nunbirds, are more gregarious and found in flocks.

===Feeding===
Puffbirds are sit-and-wait hunters, perching unmoving for long periods, while watching for insect prey. As well as arthropods, they may eat small lizards and plant material. Arthropod exoskeletons are regurgitated as pellets. The swallow-winged puffbird is the only member in the family that is known to capture insects from open perches.

=== Breeding ===
The breeding behaviour of puffbirds is not well known. Nests are burrows in dirt, rotten wood or termite mounds. Puffbirds are known to lay clutches of two or three eggs. The eggs are round, small, and white. The incubation period is around 15 days, and performed by both parents. Born blind and naked, the young can crawl to the entrance of the nest burrow at one or two days of age. There, their mother feeds them partly chewed insects. They fledge at around 20 to 21 days.

<text>VideoLAN is a non-profit organization which develops software for playing video and other media formats. It originally developed two programs for media streaming, VideoLAN Client (VLC) and VideoLAN Server (VLS), but most of the features of VLS have been incorporated into VLC, with the result renamed VLC media player.

The VideoLAN project began as a student endeavor at École Centrale Paris (France), but after releasing the software under the free software/open source GNU General Public License, the project is now multinational with a development team spanning 40 nations. The project has been completely separated from École Centrale Paris since 2009 when it was constituted as a non-profit organization.

The current president of the VideoLAN non-profit organization is Jean-Baptiste Kempf, who is also one of the project&#x27;s developers.

==Projects==

===VLC===
VLC (standing for VideoLAN Client) is a portable multimedia player, encoder, and streamer supporting many audio and video codecs and file formats as well as DVDs, VCDs, and various streaming protocols. It is able to stream over networks and to transcode multimedia files and save them into various formats. It is one of the most platform-independent players available, with versions for Microsoft Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, Android, Windows Phone, Linux, BeOS, BSD, Solaris, ChromeOS, and is widely used with over 4.2 billion downloads as of October 2022.

===VLMC===
VLMC (standing for VideoLAN Movie Creator) is a cross-platform, non-linear, video editing software application based on the VLC Media Player. The software is still in early development.
The latest version is 0.2.0 (released 2014-10-30), released under the GPLv2 license.

===VLS===
The VLS (standing for VideoLAN Server) project was originally intended to be used as a server for streaming videos. It has since been merged with the VLC project, and use of VLS is not encouraged.

===Codecs===
The VideoLAN project also hosts several audio/video decoding and decryption libraries, such as libdvdcss which allows the content of CSS protected DVDs to be unscrambled, x264 which can encode H.264/MPEG-4 AVC video, x265 which can encode HEVC video, x262 which can encode MPEG-2 video, dav1d which can decode AV1 video, libdca which can decode DTS audio, and the git repository of the multimedia framework FFmpeg.

===VLMa===
A new project has been developed, called VLMa (standing for VideoLAN Manager). VLMa is an application to manage broadcasts of TV channels, received through digital terrestrial or satellite ways. Its interface is provided as a web-site written in Java. It is also capable of streaming audio and video files. VLMa consists of a daemon (called VLMad) and a web interface (called VLMaw). VLMa is released under the GNU General Public License like VLC media player.

===VLC media player Skin Editor===
The VLC Skin Editor is a simple program developed by VideoLAN. The simple interface allows users to create new skins for the VLC media player without knowledge of the VLC Skins2 XML System. The program lets users change features on the main window, playlist window, and equalizer window.

==Commercial use==
In May 2008, Neuros Technology and Texas Instruments began work on a port of VideoLAN to their next generation open set-top box.

VLC is currently used in products through the use of libVLC and also as raw or customized VLC for Android versions on devices.
Some features have been publicly merged, such as 360° support.

==Opposition to software-bundling==
VideoLAN developers have expressed dismay at how users searching for their products see search advertising from websites that use unwanted software bundling to modify official download files with wrappers that include unwanted programs. VideoLAN does not have the resources to sue the many companies abusing their trademarks.

<doc id="262793" wikidata="Q11685" url="?curid=262793" title="Kim Clijsters">
<text>Kim Antonie Lode Clijsters (; born 8 June 1983) is a Belgian former professional tennis player. She was ranked as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s singles by the Women&#x27;s Tennis Association (WTA) for 20 weeks, and as the world No. 1 in women&#x27;s doubles for 4 weeks, having held both rankings simultaneously in 2003. She won 41 singles titles and 11 doubles titles on the WTA Tour, including four singles majors and two doubles majors (both partnering Ai Sugiyama), as well as three singles titles at the Tour Finals.

Clijsters competed professionally from 1997 in an era in which her primary rivals were compatriot Justine Henin and Serena Williams. Coming from a country with little historical success in tennis, she established Belgium as a leading force in women&#x27;s tennis alongside Henin, as the two of them led their country to their first Fed Cup crown in 2001 and were the top two players in the world in late 2003. Following defeats in all of her first four major singles finals, Clijsters finally won her first singles major at the 2005 US Open.

Plagued by injuries and having lost desire to compete, Clijsters retired from tennis in 2007 at the age of 23 to get married and have a daughter. She returned to the sport two years later and stunned the tennis world by winning the US Open as an unranked player in just her third tournament back. She defended the US Open title the following year and then won the Australian Open in 2011, becoming the first mother to be ranked world No. 1. Along with Margaret Court, she co-holds the record for most major singles titles won as a mother (with three), and was the first mother to win one since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. Clijsters retired again following the 2012 US Open. She had a second, short-lived comeback from 2020 to 2022.

Clijsters was born to athletic parents with backgrounds in professional football and gymnastics. She was renowned for her athleticism, which was highlighted by her ability to perform splits on court in the middle of points. She built the offensive side of her game around controlled aggression while also using her exceptional movement to become an elite defensive player. Clijsters was very popular and well-liked as a player, having won the Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award eight times. She was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 2017.

==Early life and background==
Kim Clijsters was born on 8 June 1983 in Bilzen, a small town in northeastern Belgium. She grew up with her younger sister Elke in the nearby town of Bree in the Flemish province of Limburg. Kim is the daughter of Lei Clijsters and Els Vandecaetsbeek, both of whom were accomplished athletes. Her mother Els was a Belgian national artistic gymnastics champion. Her father Lei was a professional football defender who played for a variety of clubs in the top-flight Belgian First Division, including KV Mechelen with whom he won the UEFA Cup Winners&#x27; Cup in 1988. He was also a member of the Belgium national football team, tallying 40 caps and competing in two World Cups. Clijsters credits her parents for giving her a footballer&#x27;s legs and a gymnast&#x27;s flexibility. She also attributes her success to the freedom they gave her when she was a young player, saying, &quot;They&#x27;ve let me make my own decisions.&quot;

When Clijsters was five years old, her father built a clay tennis court at their home as a gift to his daughter to celebrate him winning the 1988 &quot;Gouden Schoen&quot; (player of the year in the Belgian First Division). Clijsters began playing tennis earlier that year after attending a lesson with her cousins and her uncle while her parents were away. From then on, she became fixated on the sport. She began playing with her sister at the Tennisdel club in Genk by the time she was seven. Her first coach Bart Van Kerckhoven recalled that she was extremely energetic and never wanted to leave the tennis court, adding that, &quot;If the group before her did some sprints to finish off the session, Kim would join in. Then she put her heart and soul into her own training session, after which she joined the next group for their warm-up exercises.&quot;

At the age of nine, Clijsters began working with Benny Vanhoudt in the more distant town of Diest. Along with her sister, she trained for fifteen hours a week, including five hours of individual instruction, which Vanhoudt said was &quot;an insane amount [of total hours].&quot; She continued to train in Diest until she was twelve. During this time, she also first worked with Carl Maes and Wim Fissette, both of whom would coach Clijsters later in her professional career. When she was thirteen, Maes took over as her primary coach at the Flemish Tennis Association in Antwerp.

==Junior career==
Clijsters had success at both the national and international levels at a very young age. In 1993, she won the 12-and-under division of the Belgian Junior Championships (the Coupe de Borman) in doubles with her future longtime rival Justine Henin. At the time, Clijsters was ten years old and Henin was eleven. A year later, she won the 12-and-under singles event at the same tournament. Clijsters continued to play alongside Henin, winning the doubles event at the 14-and-under European Junior Championships as well as the 14-and-under European Junior Team Championships for Belgium, both in 1996 and the latter of which also with Leslie Butkiewicz. Her first big international junior title came at Les Petits As, a high-level 14-and-under tournament. She defeated future top 25 players Iveta Benešová and Elena Bovina in the semifinals and final respectively.

Clijsters played two full seasons on the ITF Junior Circuit, the premier junior tour that is run by the International Tennis Federation (ITF). At the very end of 1997, she partnered with Zsófia Gubacsi to win her first ITF title in the doubles event at the Grade A Orange Bowl, one of the highest level junior tournaments. In 1998, Clijsters had her best year on the junior tour, finishing the season at career-high rankings of world No. 11 in singles and world No. 4 in doubles. She won two junior Grand Slam doubles titles, the French Open with Jelena Dokic and the US Open with Eva Dyrberg. She defeated her French Open partner Dokic in the US Open doubles final. In singles, she made it to the Wimbledon final, but finished runner-up to Katarina Srebotnik.

==Professional career==
===1997–99: Maiden WTA title, Newcomer of the Year===

As a fourteen year old, Clijsters could only enter professional tournaments through qualifying since the WTA Tour&#x27;s policy did not allow players her age to receive main draw wild cards. In August 1997, Clijsters qualified for her first main draw at her second career tournament on the lower-level ITF Women&#x27;s Circuit, which was held in the Belgian coastal town of Koksijde. She won seven matches in total, including five in qualifying, to reach the quarterfinals. Clijsters did not enter another professional tournament until after her runner-up finish at the Wimbledon girls&#x27; singles event the following summer. Playing in Brussels in July 1998, she won both the singles and doubles events for her first career professional titles. Clijsters continued to excel at the ITF level, winning four more titles within the next year, two in both singles and doubles.

Clijsters began 1999 with a WTA singles ranking of No. 420 in the world. Around this time, Belgian women&#x27;s tennis was beginning to flourish. Both Dominique Van Roost and Sabine Appelmans had been ranked in the top 20 within the previous two years, complementing the rise of Clijsters and Henin on the junior tour. This success helped lead to the revival of the only WTA tournament in Belgium, which was relaunched as the Flanders Women&#x27;s Open in Antwerp after not being held in six years. Clijsters made her WTA debut at the tournament in May, entering the main draw as a lucky loser after losing in the final round of qualifying. She won her first career tour-level match against Miho Saeki and advanced to the quarterfinals, where she was defeated by top seed Sarah Pitkowski despite holding match points.

One week after Clijsters turned sixteen, she entered Wimbledon as the youngest player in the top 200. After barely having a high enough ranking to get into the qualifying draw, she ultimately made it to the round of sixteen in her Grand Slam tournament debut. She defeated world No. 10 Amanda Coetzer in the third round and did not drop a set until losing to Steffi Graf one round later, her only career match against her childhood idol. Clijsters also had a good showing at the US Open, losing to the eventual champion Serena Williams in the third round after squandering a chance to serve for the match. Clijsters next played at the Luxembourg Open held in the town of Kockelscheuer just outside the capital. She won the title with relative ease in just her fourth career WTA event, taking affinity for the friendly atmosphere of the smaller tournament and the faster carpet courts. Most notably, she faced off against Van Roost in the final and only conceded four games to the top-ranked Belgian. Clijsters also made the singles final in Bratislava at her next tournament, finishing runner-up to No. 11 Amélie Mauresmo. Nonetheless, she was able to win the doubles event with compatriot Laurence Courtois as her partner. At the end of the season, Clijsters was named WTA Newcomer of the Year, having risen to No. 47 in the world.

===2000–02: French Open finalist, Tour champion===
Clijsters was unable to repeat her success at the Grand Slam tournaments in 2000, not advancing past the second round at any of the singles events. However, she continued her steady climb in the rankings up to No. 18 on the strength of two more titles, one at the Tasmanian International in her first tournament of the year and another at the Sparkassen Cup in Germany near the end of the season. The latter victory was Clijsters&#x27;s first at a Tier II event (the second highest level tournament) and followed up a loss in another Tier II final to world No. 1 Martina Hingis earlier that month. In the middle of the year, Clijsters also finished runner-up at the Wimbledon mixed doubles event alongside her boyfriend Lleyton Hewitt.
At the Indian Wells Open in early 2001, Clijsters finally defeated Hingis in her fourth meeting against the world No. 1 player to reach her first Tier I final. After winning the first set of the final, she ended up losing in three sets to Serena Williams. The match was overshadowed by the controversy of the crowd booing Williams for her sister Venus&#x27;s late withdrawal from their semifinal, leading to both sisters boycotting the tournament for 14 years. A few months later at the French Open, Clijsters became the first Belgian to contest a Grand Slam singles final. She had defeated No. 16 Henin in the semifinals in their closest and highest profile match to date, coming back from a set and a break down, and also having saved three break points that would have put her behind 5–2 in the second set. The final against Australian Open champion and world No. 4 Jennifer Capriati was an even tighter match. Playing a day after her 18th birthday, Clijsters won the first set but lost the second. After a French Open final record 22 games and 2 hours 21 minutes in total, she was defeated by Capriati 12–10 in the deciding set. The match was ranked as the greatest French Open women&#x27;s final in Open Era history by &quot;Tennis.com&quot;. Clijsters would go on to make it to at least the quarterfinals at each of the next three majors. She also played in her first Grand Slam doubles final at Wimbledon later that year, with Ai Sugiyama as her partner. She won three singles titles in 2001, including her second titles at both the Luxembourg Open and the Sparkassen Cup, to help her finish the season at No. 5 in the world. With four doubles finals in total, she was also ranked No. 15 in doubles at the end of the year.

Clijsters maintained her top ten ranking throughout 2002 despite struggling with an ongoing shoulder injury in the first half of the year. Her best result at a Grand Slam event came at the Australian Open, where she lost another three-set match to Capriati in the semifinals in their first meeting since the French Open final. Nonetheless, she continued to rise in the rankings to No. 3 by March, her best ranking for the season. Although Clijsters did not reach another Grand Slam quarterfinal the rest of the year, she won three more titles leading up to the year-end WTA Tour Championships in Los Angeles. She received her third invite to the event, which only the top 16 players in the world are guaranteed entry. Clijsters made it to the final with ease after dropping only six games in the first three rounds, including a victory over Henin in the quarterfinals and a retirement due to injury from Venus Williams in the semifinals. Her opponent in the final was Serena Williams, who entered the match with a 56–4 record on the season and having won the last three majors of the year. Although Serena had won their first five encounters and was considered a clear favourite, Clijsters upset Serena in straight sets to win the championship. After the tournament, she said, &quot;This is the best victory of my career.&quot;

===2003: World No. 1 in singles and doubles===
The 2003 season was Clijsters&#x27;s &quot;annus mirabilis&quot;. She competed in 21 singles events, reaching the semifinals in all but one of them, advancing to 15 finals, and winning nine titles. With a record of 90–12, she was the first player to accrue 90 wins since Martina Navratilova in 1982 and the first to play more than 100 matches since Chris Evert in 1974. Clijsters also played an extensive doubles schedule, compiling a total of 170 matches between both disciplines. She partnered with Sugiyama the entire year, winning seven titles in thirteen events. This season also marked the peak of the rivalry between Clijsters and Henin, as the pair faced each other eight matches, the last six of which were in finals. In doubles, five of her ten finals were against the team of Virginia Ruano Pascual and Paola Suárez. With her success, Clijsters became the first Belgian world No. 1 in singles or doubles, achieving both feats in August.

====Singles: Two Grand Slam finals, Tour Championship defense====
Clijsters began her singles season by winning the Sydney International over Lindsay Davenport, her third consecutive title. She extended her tour win streak to 17 matches—all without dropping a set—before she was defeated by Serena Williams in an Australian Open semifinal where she had a 5–1 lead in the third set as well as two match points on serve. She said afterwards, &quot;The only thing I regret a little bit, is those two double faults [to start the game at 5–4]. I could feel that she was really trying to step it up, and that she was hitting the balls a lot more aggressive and had almost no unforced errors at the end.&quot; Williams won the title to complete her &quot;Serena Slam&quot;. After losing in the final at her next two tournaments, Clijsters recovered at the Indian Wells Open to win her first Tier I title. Like in Sydney, she defeated Davenport in the final. She won another Tier I title on clay in May at the Italian Open over No. 4 Amélie Mauresmo, who had a chance to serve for the match in the second set.

At the French Open, both Clijsters and Henin reached the final to guarantee that the winner would become the first Belgian Grand Slam singles champion. Henin had won their only meeting in a final in 2003 thus far at the German Open, which was also their only other encounter on clay. While both players had match points in Germany, Henin won in Paris in a lopsided affair where she only lost four games. After losing in the semifinals at Wimbledon to Venus Williams, Clijsters rebounded to win two Tier II titles at the Stanford Classic and the Los Angeles Open. With the second of those titles, she attained the world No. 1 ranking, in part because the top-ranked Serena Williams had not played on tour since Wimbledon due to a knee injury. She was the first woman to become No. 1 without winning a Grand Slam singles title. Clijsters regained the top ranking in doubles the following week to become only the fifth player in WTA history to be No. 1 in singles and doubles simultaneously. Despite playing the US Open as the top seed, Clijsters again lost to Henin in the final in straight sets. Clijsters had been regarded as the favourite entering the match because of her performance in the earlier rounds and Henin&#x27;s lengthy semifinal match the previous day. The title helped Henin rise to No. 2 in the world.

The last stage of the season featured Clijsters battling Henin for the top ranking. Clijsters defeated Henin in the final of the Tennis Grand Prix in Filderstadt to defend her title and her world No. 1 ranking. This was the eighth time in WTA history where the top two players in the world faced off for the top ranking. Although Clijsters lost the top ranking to Henin the following week, she regained it a week later by winning the Luxembourg Open for the third year in a row. She finished her season by defending her title at the WTA Tour Championships in the first year where the tournament switched to a round robin format in the initial stage. Clijsters swept her group of Mauresmo, Elena Dementieva, and Chanda Rubin. She won her semifinal against Capriati before defeating Mauresmo again for the title. With the million dollar prize, Clijsters finished the season as the tour prize money leader and became the first player to earn four million dollars in a season on the WTA Tour. Nonetheless, Henin took the year-end No. 1 ranking by improving on her performance at the event from the previous season.

====Doubles: French Open and Wimbledon titles====

In the early part of the season, Clijsters and Sugiyama won three titles on hard courts. However, they did not win any big titles through May, losing in the Australian Open quarterfinals to the Williams sisters and finishing runners-up at their first two Tier I finals. They entered the French Open and Wimbledon and made it to the finals at both events. Clijsters and Sugiyama defeated the top seeds Ruano Pascual and Suarez in both finals for Clijsters&#x27;s first two Grand Slam tournament titles. The French Open final was a tighter match, ending 9–7 in the third set. Despite these titles, the duo remained behind Ruano Pascual and Suarez in the rankings until August when Clijsters became world No. 1. She held the top ranking for four non-consecutive weeks. The pair were the top seeds at the US Open, but withdrew in the second round due to rain delaying Sugiyama&#x27;s fourth round singles match for three days. They ended the season by finishing runners-up to Ruano Pascual and Suarez at the WTA Tour Championships. Despite Clijsters&#x27;s success in 2003, she seldom played doubles during the rest of her career.

===2004–05: Extended injury absence, first Grand Slam singles title===
Although Clijsters maintained her form into 2004, her season was ultimately marred by injuries. It was feared that she would need surgery and miss the Australian Open after she injured her left ankle in the Hopman Cup. Nonetheless, she competed at the event and reached the championship match without dropping a set, despite aggravating her ankle injury in the quarterfinals. Her opponent in the final was Henin and unlike their previous two Grand Slam finals, Clijsters was able to win a set. With Henin up a break at 4–3 in the third set, the chair umpire incorrectly overruled a line call on break point that would have leveled the match. Henin ended up winning the game and the match. Clijsters said afterwards, &quot;I&#x27;m just as disappointed as after the last two grand slam [finals], but I played a lot better this time&quot;. In February, she won her next two tournaments, including the Diamond Games in Antwerp for her first WTA title in her home country. After Clijsters withdrew from the Indian Wells Open following one match with a torn left wrist tendon, she only played in two more WTA events the remainder of the season. She returned to the WTA Tour six weeks later with a wrist brace, but again withdrew after one match. In June, she found out she would need surgery to remove a cyst in her wrist. As a result, she remained out until the Hasselt Cup in Belgium where she needed to retire in her third match.

There were few expectations on Clijsters entering 2005, as it still was not certain whether she would be able to play. After missing the Australian Open, she returned to the tour in February. In her second and third tournaments back, Clijsters won both Tier I events in March, the Indian Wells Open and the Miami Open, to become the second woman to complete the Sunshine Double after Steffi Graf in 1994 and 1996. She defeated world No. 1 Lindsay Davenport in the final of Indian Wells, as well as No. 2 Amélie Mauresmo and No. 3 Maria Sharapova in her last two matches in Miami. These titles lifted her ranking from outside the top 100 back into the top 20. Clijsters was unable to continue her success into the clay or grass court seasons, winning just one title and losing in the fourth round in three sets to Davenport at both the French Open and Wimbledon.
After Wimbledon in late June, Clijsters only lost one more match through early October. During this stretch, she won five titles including her third Stanford Classic and her fifth Luxembourg Open. She also built up a 22-match win streak and defeated Henin in the final of the Tier I Canadian Open in their only meeting of the year. Clijsters&#x27;s most important title of the season was the US Open, her first Grand Slam singles title. As the fourth seed, she was not tested until the quarterfinals, when Venus Williams was two games away from defeating her at a set and a break up. Clijsters rebounded to win the match in three sets and then defeated the top seed and world No. 2 Sharapova in the semifinals, also in three sets. Despite her previous struggles in Grand Slam singles finals, she won the championship against No. 13 Mary Pierce with ease, only conceding four games. As the winner of the US Open Series, Clijsters received double the standard amount of prize money. Her $2.2 million prize was the largest in women&#x27;s sports history at the time. Clijsters&#x27;s last tournament of the year was the WTA Tour Championships. Although she had a chance to return to No. 1 if she outperformed the top-ranked Davenport, she only won one match and did not advance out of her round robin group. She finished the year ranked No. 2, having won a tour-best nine titles and all of her finals. She was named both the WTA Player of the Year and the WTA Comeback Player of the Year. Despite this success, Clijsters announced in August that she was planning to retire in 2007 because of her injury troubles.

===2006–07: Return to No. 1, hastened retirement===

The 2006 season saw a variety of injury issues for Clijsters. She only played in 14 tournaments, missing the US Open as well as the Fed Cup final. While she reached the semifinals at the other three Grand Slam singles events, she was unable to advance to another final. Clijsters withdrew from her first tournament of the year, the Sydney International with hip and back problems. Although she recovered from those issues in time to reach the semifinals at the Australian Open, she needed to retire from that match as well after twisting her ankle while down a break in the third set against Amélie Mauresmo. Nonetheless, with Davenport losing in the quarterfinals, Clijsters regained the No. 1 ranking. She held the top ranking through mid-March. Clijsters returned for the Diamond Games where she finished runner-up to Mauresmo, but needed to withdraw from the Indian Wells Open because of the same ankle injury. While she was healthy enough to play a regular schedule during the clay and grass court seasons, Henin continued her recent dominance of their rivalry over this stretch. She defeated Clijsters in the semifinals of three consecutive events, including the French Open and Wimbledon.

During the US Open Series, Clijsters won her fourth Stanford Classic and finished runner-up to Maria Sharapova at the Tier I San Diego Classic. However, her summer season came to an end when she fell on her left wrist in her opening round match at the Canadian Open. This injury kept her out until late October. She made her return at the Hasselt Cup and won her second consecutive title at the event. Clijsters entered the WTA Tour Championships ranked No. 5 in the world, where all three other players she was grouped with were Russian. Although she lost to her group&#x27;s top seed, Sharapova, she defeated Svetlana Kuznetsova and Elena Dementieva to advance. Her season ended in the semifinals, where she lost to world No. 1 Mauresmo.

Clijsters entered 2007 intending to retire at the end of the season, but only ended up playing in five tournaments due to injuries. She won her only title of the year in her first tournament, the Sydney International. The Australian Open was her only Grand Slam event of the season. For the second consecutive season, she lost in the semifinals, this time to top seed Sharapova. Clijsters&#x27;s last tournament in Belgium was the Diamond Games, where she finished runner-up to Mauresmo for the second year in a row. A hip injury limited Clijsters&#x27;s remaining schedule. In her last two tournaments, she lost to Li Na in the fourth round of the Miami Open in March and qualifier Julia Vakulenko in her opening match at the Warsaw Open in May. Her last win was against Samantha Stosur in Miami. A few days after losing in Warsaw, Clijsters announced her retirement at the age of 23, forgoing plans to finish the season.

===Two-year hiatus===
A few months after Clijsters retired, she married American basketball player Brian Lynch. She gave birth to a daughter in early 2008, less than two months after her father Leo Clijsters was diagnosed with lung cancer. Her father died in January 2009. Clijsters said, &quot;The birth of Jada was the best moment of my life, but it also taught me a lesson because we knew that my Dad was terminally ill. I realised that new life had been born, but a few months later another life would disappear. It was a very intense period in our lives.&quot;

Nearly two months after her father&#x27;s death, it was announced that Clijsters would play in an exhibition in May with Tim Henman against Steffi Graf and Andre Agassi to test the new retractable roof on Centre Court at Wimbledon. In March 2009, Clijsters stated that she was planning to come out of retirement, motivated by returning to the &quot;training schedule from [her] pro days&quot; to prepare for the Wimbledon exhibition. She added that she was taking a different approach to tennis, saying, &quot;I am looking at this as a second career, not as a comeback as I am now in a situation where not everything revolves around tennis 24 hours a day.&quot; Clijsters and Henman won the exhibition doubles, and Clijsters also defeated her idol Graf in singles. She commented, &quot;I wanted to feel good here on court. And I&#x27;ve enjoyed it. This is the pleasure which was lacking at the end of my first career. But now I&#x27;ve got my motivation back.&quot;

===2009–10: Start of second career, back-to-back US Open titles===

With no ranking, Clijsters needed wild cards to begin her comeback. She requested and received wild cards for the Cincinnati Open, the Canadian Open, and the US Open. In her return to the tour in Cincinnati, Clijsters defeated three top 20 opponents, including No. 6 Svetlana Kuznetsova, before losing to world No. 1 Dinara Safina in the quarterfinals. She recorded another top ten victory in Canada over No. 9 Victoria Azarenka. Clijsters was still unranked entering the US Open, as players needed three tour events to have a ranking at the time. Nonetheless, she made it to the final, notably upsetting both Williams sisters, No. 3 Venus in the fourth round and No. 2 Serena in the semifinals. She defeated Venus in a tight third set after they split the first two 6–0. Clijsters then defeated No. 8 Caroline Wozniacki to win her second US Open championship. She became the first unseeded woman to win the title at the event, and the first mother to win a Grand Slam singles title since Evonne Goolagong Cawley in 1980. With the title, she entered the WTA rankings at No. 19. Her only other tournament of the year was the Luxembourg Open, where she lost her second match. At the end of the season, she won the WTA Comeback Player of the Year award for the second time.

Clijsters planned a limited schedule for 2010 to keep her focus on her family and ended up playing just eleven tournaments. In her first event of the year, she won the Brisbane International, narrowly defeating Henin in a third set tiebreak in Henin&#x27;s first tournament back from her own retirement. She entered the Australian Open as one of the favourites, but was upset by No. 19 Nadia Petrova in the third round, only winning one game in that loss. Clijsters did not return to the tour until March. After an early loss at the Indian Wells Open, she won the Miami Open for the second time. The only set she lost was in the semifinals to Henin, who she again defeated in a third set tiebreak. She only conceded three games in the final against Venus Williams. During the clay court season, Clijsters tore a muscle in her left foot, which kept her out of the French Open. Although she returned for Wimbledon, she was upset in the quarterfinals by Vera Zvonareva after recording another win over Henin in the previous round.
In the latter half of the year, Clijsters entered only four tournaments. During the US Open Series, she won the Cincinnati Open, the tournament where she returned from retirement a year earlier. At her next event, she was eliminated in the quarterfinals of the Canadian Open by Zvonareva while struggling with a thigh injury. Nonetheless, Clijsters recovered to defend her title at the US Open. In the last three rounds, she defeated three top ten players in No. 6 Samantha Stosur, No. 4 Venus Williams, and No. 8 Vera Zvonareva. Venus came the closest to ending her title defense, but lost in three sets after serving two double faults in the second set tiebreak which could have won her the match. Clijsters won the final over Zvonareva with ease in less than an hour. This was her third consecutive title at the US Open and the fourth consecutive time she made it to the championship match, having skipped the tournament four times since 2003. Clijsters&#x27; final event of the season was the WTA Tour Championships, where she qualified for the seventh time. Despite a loss to Zvonareva in her last round robin match, she advanced to the knockout rounds and defeated No. 5 Stosur and world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki for her third title at the year-end championships. Clijsters finished the season at No. 3 and was named WTA Player of the Year for the second time.

===2011–12: Australian Open champion, last reign at No. 1===
By the start of 2011, Clijsters knew she was planning to retire in 2012 as she did not want to be on the tour while her daughter was in school. She began the season at the Sydney International, where she finished runner-up to Li Na in straight sets despite winning the first five games of the match. The two also met in the final of their next tournament, the Australian Open. Although Clijsters again lost the first set, she recovered to win the championship, her fourth Grand Slam singles title and first outside of the US Open. This title would be the last of Clijsters&#x27;s career. She made one last final at her next WTA event, the Paris Open, where she was defeated by Petra Kvitová. Nonetheless, this result helped Clijsters regain the world No. 1 ranking before Caroline Wozniacki took it back one week later. During the rest of the season, Clijsters was limited by a variety of injuries and only played five more tournaments. She needed to retire from a fourth round match at the Indian Wells Open due to a shoulder injury. Then, as a result of a right ankle injury suffered while dancing at a wedding in April, the French Open was the only clay court event she entered. At the second Grand Slam tournament of the year, she was upset in the second round by No. 114 Arantxa Rus after failing to convert two match points in the second set. Aggravating that ankle injury at her next event then forced her to miss Wimbledon. Clijsters returned for the Canadian Open, where she suffered an abdominal injury that kept her out the remainder of the season.
Clijsters was unable to stay healthy in her last year on the WTA Tour. In the first week of the season, she returned to the tour for the Brisbane International. After winning her first three matches back, she needed to retire in the semifinals due to hip spasms, a precautionary measure to prepare for the Australian Open. As the defending champion at the year&#x27;s first Grand Slam event, Clijsters made it to the semifinals. Her fourth round victory came against No. 5 Li Na in a rematch of the 2011 final. She overcame rolling her ankle in the first set and saved four match points at 6–2 in the second set tiebreak to win in three sets. After Clijsters defeated world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in the quarterfinals, she lost to No. 3 Victoria Azarenka in another three-set match. Both her hip and ankle continued to trouble her for months after the tournament, forcing her to skip the clay court season. After playing once in March and returning in mid-June, the last WTA events of Clijsters&#x27;s career were the final two Grand Slam tournaments of the season. She lost at Wimbledon in the fourth round to No. 8 Angelique Kerber, only winning two games. Clijsters entered the US Open having not lost a match there since the 2003 final. She recorded her last WTA singles match win against Victoria Duval in the first round before falling to Laura Robson in her next match. Her career ended with a second round mixed doubles loss alongside Bob Bryan to the eventual champions Ekaterina Makarova and Bruno Soares, at which point she officially retired.

===2020–22: Second comeback===

After more than seven years of retirement, Clijsters returned to professional tennis in February 2020 at the Dubai Tennis Championships as a wildcard. Clijsters lost to Australian Open runner-up Garbiñe Muguruza in the opening round. She next entered the Monterrey Open as a wildcard losing in the first round to Johanna Konta. No tournaments were played due to the COVID-19 pandemic from March to July. Clijsters received wildcards at the inaugural Top Seed Open in singles and doubles alongside Sabine Lisicki. Clijsters withdrew from both singles and doubles. Clijsters next played the US Open on a main draw wildcard losing in the first round to Ekaterina Alexandrova. Clijsters underwent knee surgery in October and did not play another tournament in 2020.

Clijsters pulled out of the 2021 Miami Open, saying she did not feel ready to compete after her surgery and contracting COVID-19 in January. She played her first tournament of the year at the Chicago Fall Tennis Classic, having accepted a wildcard, but lost in the first round to Hsieh Su-Wei in three sets. She entered the doubles draw too, the partner was Kirsten Flipkens, but they lost in the first round. Clijsters then participated in postponed Indian Wells Masters, drew Kateřina Siniaková and lost in three sets in the first round. Clijsters played a number of matches for World TeamTennis in 2021, aligned with the New York Empire.

With many tournaments having been postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Clijsters had only been able to play five matches within the two years that she had returned to the tour. On 12 April 2022, Clijsters announced that she was ending her comeback and again retiring from tennis, citing a desire to focus more on family life.

==National representation==
===Fed Cup===
Clijsters made her Fed Cup debut for Belgium in 2000 at the age of 16. The top-tier World Group that year consisted of 13 teams, 12 of which were divided into three round robin groups. The winners of the round robin groups in April would compete with the defending champion United States team in a knockout format for the title in November. Belgium was placed in a group with Australia, France, and Russia. Each tie was contested over one day as a best-of-three rubbers, two in singles and the last in doubles. Clijsters only played singles, while Els Callens and Laurence Courtois played all three doubles matches. Although Clijsters narrowly lost her debut to Jelena Dokic of Australia by a score of 9–7 in the third set, her teammates were able to secure the tie. She won her other two matches against Nathalie Tauziat of France and Anna Kournikova of Russia, both of which were crucial as Belgium won each of those ties 2–1 as well to win the group. In the semifinals, Henin returned to the team as they faced the United States. After Henin lost to Monica Seles, Clijsters needed to defeat Lindsay Davenport to keep Belgium in the tournament. She won the second set, but ultimately lost the match.

The following year, the format for the Fed Cup changed again. The three round robin pools were reduced to two and the winners of each pool would contest a final tie for the title. Belgium&#x27;s team of Clijsters, Henin, Callens, and Courtois from the 2000 final all returned for 2001. With Henin and Clijsters exclusively playing singles, and Callens and Courtois playing doubles, Belgium won all nine of their rubbers against Spain, Germany, and Australia to advance to the final. Facing Russia, Henin defeated Nadia Petrova and Clijsters defeated Elena Dementieva to secure Belgium&#x27;s first Fed Cup crown. Courtois commented, &quot;We were never under any pressure, mainly because Kim and Justine were so strong.&quot;

While Clijsters and Henin were on the team, Belgium came closest to another Fed Cup triumph in 2006. In this year, the World Group consisted of eight teams in a knockout tournament. In the first round against Russia, both Clijsters and Henin made themselves available and won three out of four singles matches to advance. Although Henin missed the semifinal, Clijsters and Kirsten Flipkens were able to lead Belgium to a victory over the United States, who were also short-handed without Lindsay Davenport or the Williams sisters. However, Clijsters was forced to miss the Fed Cup final due to a wrist injury. Henin and Flipkens returned for the final, which Belgium hosted against Italy. The tie was decided by the doubles rubber, which Belgium lost after Henin aggravated a knee injury she suffered in one of her singles rubbers and needed to retire down 2–0 in the third set.

Clijsters also played on the Belgium Fed Cup team from 2002 to 2005, and 2010–11 after she returned from retirement. The team&#x27;s best results in those years were two semifinal appearances in 2003 and 2011. Clijsters missed the ties in which Belgium was eliminated in both instances. Overall, Clijsters compiled a 24–4 record in Fed Cup, split across 21–3 in singles and 3–1 in doubles.

===Hopman Cup===
Clijsters participated in the Hopman Cup from 2001 to 2004, partnering with Olivier Rochus in the first instance and Xavier Malisse thereafter. The tournament consists of eight teams, each with one female and one male player from the same country. The teams are divided into two round robin groups, the winners of which compete for the title. Each tie consists of a women&#x27;s singles match, a men&#x27;s singles match, and a mixed doubles match. The Belgian team did not advance to final in any of the years Clijsters participated. Their best performances came in 2002 and 2003 when they won two out of three round robin ties.

In 2002, they finished tied for first with the United States and Italy in a group that also featured France. Belgium&#x27;s only loss came against the United States, with Clijsters and Malisse losing both singles matches to Monica Seles and Jan-Michael Gambill respectively. Although the United States lost to Italy, they advanced out of the group on the tiebreak criteria, having won six rubbers compared to the five won by each of Belgium and Italy. Both of the ties Belgium had won were by a score of 2–1, with Clijsters losing to Francesca Schiavone against Italy and the pair losing the mixed doubles against the French team of Virginie Razzano and Arnaud Clément. The following year, Clijsters and Malisse again lost to the United States, who fielded a different team of Serena Williams and James Blake.

===Olympics===
Clijsters did not compete at the Olympics until 2012 near the end of her career. She had been ranked inside the top 40 in the months leading up to the 2000 Sydney Olympics in September, high enough to qualify. However, she did not make herself available for selection for a variety of reasons including issues with her shoulder and the event&#x27;s timing a week after the US Open. During the 2004 Athens Olympics, she was in the middle of a long absence from competition after undergoing wrist surgery. However, she had announced before the year began that she did not intend to compete at the Games because Adidas was the Belgian team&#x27;s uniform sponsor and her contract with Fila forbade her from wearing clothing from another company. The 2008 Beijing Olympics took place during her first retirement.

Clijsters&#x27;s desire to represent Belgium at the Olympics was one of the underlying reasons why she prolonged her second career until the 2012 London Games in late July. At the time, she did not have good results at her most recent tournaments, withdrawing from the Rosmalen Grass Court Championships in the semifinals in June due to injury and suffering a lopsided loss in the fourth round at Wimbledon. In her Olympic debut, Clijsters won her first three matches in straight sets, defeating Roberta Vinci, Carla Suárez Navarro, and No. 12 Ana Ivanovic in succession. She faced No. 3 Maria Sharapova in the quarterfinals, losing in straight sets one match before the medal rounds.

== Rivalries ==
=== Clijsters vs. Henin ===

Clijsters&#x27;s biggest rival was Justine Henin. Their rivalry began during their junior years when they were both considered promising young talents. They started out as friends and won the Belgian Junior Championships as doubles partners at ages ten and eleven respectively, despite only being able to communicate with hand signals due to Clijsters not knowing French and Henin not knowing Flemish. However, their friendship began to fade by their mid-teens, leading to disputes that their coaches would try to keep out of the media. Clijsters attributed this deterioration in part to one of Henin&#x27;s coaches telling Henin, &quot;she had to hate all of her opponents, and only then could she win.&quot; She also acknowledged they had very different personalities.

Clijsters and Henin typically downplayed any disagreements between them, saying they were overdramatized by the media. When they were professionals, Clijsters accused Henin of routinely faking injuries in their matches to receive medical timeouts. Additionally, Clijsters&#x27;s father seemed to allege that Henin was taking performance-enhancing drugs. Although they had won the Fed Cup together in 2001, they were not interested in playing on the same team in 2004 or 2005. The following year, Clijsters&#x27;s former coach Carl Maes, who was then the Belgium Fed Cup captain, helped convince Clijsters to reunite with Henin, and together they ultimately reached another final.

On the court, they played each other in 25 WTA matches, making each of them the other&#x27;s most frequent opponent. Although Clijsters won the series 13–12, Henin won seven out of their eleven meetings in finals including all three at Grand Slam tournaments. The latest stage win Clijsters had at a major was in the semifinals of the 2001 French Open. She also defeated Henin en route to her first WTA Tour Championship in 2002. Clijsters dominated their hard court meetings 8–4, while Henin dominated on clay 5–1. Henin also won three of their five grass court encounters. Before both of their first retirements, Henin was leading the series 12–10. However, Clijsters won all three of their meetings during their comebacks to win the series.

===Clijsters vs. Williams sisters===
The Williams sisters were both No. 1 in the world and combined for 15 Grand Slam singles titles while Clijsters was on tour. Clijsters had a record of just 2–7 against Serena, who she called her toughest opponent. She fared better against Venus, compiling a winning record of 7–6.

Clijsters&#x27;s rivalry with Serena included two of the biggest controversies in Serena&#x27;s career: the 2001 Indian Wells final which led to both Williams sisters&#x27; long boycott of the tournament, and the 2009 US Open semifinal which Serena lost on a point penalty. Serena defeated Clijsters in their first five meetings. She also won all four of their three-set encounters, including their 1999 US Open third round match and their 2003 Australian Open semifinal where Clijsters had the opportunity to serve for both matches. Although Clijsters only had two wins against Serena, both were considered big upsets and among the most important wins of her career. Her victory in the 2002 WTA Tour Championship final gave Clijsters her biggest title at the time, and her win at the 2009 US Open set up her first Grand Slam singles title as a mother one match later. Clijsters also defeated Venus in both of those tournaments, making her the only player to record wins over both Williams sisters at the same event twice.

Venus also initially dominated her rivalry with Clijsters. She won six of their first eight meetings, including two in the late stages of Grand Slam tournaments in the quarterfinals of the 2001 US Open and the semifinals of 2003 Wimbledon. Venus also eliminated Clijsters from the Diamond Games in Belgium twice in 2003 and 2005. Additionally, one of Clijsters&#x27;s first two wins against Venus was a retirement due to injury at the 2002 WTA Tour Championships. Nonetheless, Clijsters rebounded to win their last five meetings and end her career leading in their head-to-head record. Three of those five victories came at the US Open en route to her three titles at the event in 2005, 2009, and 2010.

===Other rivals===
In addition to Henin and the Williams sisters, Clijsters also developed rivalries with several other players who had been ranked No. 1 in the world. Two of her most frequent opponents were Lindsay Davenport and Amélie Mauresmo. Clijsters narrowly had winning records against both of them, going 9–8 versus Davenport and 8–7 versus Mauresmo. Davenport had won six of their first seven meetings before Clijsters won eight of their next nine encounters, including all five in 2003. Clijsters defeated Davenport in all four of their meetings in finals, including two at the Indian Wells Open. While Davenport had a 5–1 lead in Grand Slam tournaments, Clijsters won their latest-stage such meeting in the semifinals of the 2003 US Open. Unlike against Davenport, Clijsters initially dominated her rivalry with Mauresmo, winning eight of their first ten matches before Mauresmo took the last five. They met in two WTA Tour Championship finals, which they split. Mauresmo also denied Clijsters chances to win more titles in her home country when she won their finals at both the 2006 and 2007 Diamond Games.

==Exhibition matches==

During Clijsters&#x27;s first retirement, the invitation to participate in the roof test exhibition series at Wimbledon in May 2009 inspired her to return to the WTA Tour. In the summer, she joined the St. Louis Aces of the World Team Tennis league to help prepare for her comeback. She also participated in World Team Tennis the following year as a member of the New York Sportimes. Ten years after the roof test on Centre Court that inspired her comeback, Clijsters returned to Wimbledon to participate in an exhibition series to test the new roof on Court No. 1 in which she played a set of singles against Venus Williams as well as a set of mixed doubles.

On 8 July 2010, an exhibition match between Clijsters and Henin was scheduled as an attempt to set a new world record for largest attendance at a tennis match. The contest took place at the King Baudouin Stadium and was a part of the Best of Belgium national festival. After Henin needed to withdraw from the match due to an elbow injury, Serena Williams was chosen as a replacement. Clijsters defeated Williams in straight sets. A total of 35,681 people attended the match, breaking the world record of 30,472 set in 1973 by the Battle of the Sexes between Billie Jean King and Bobby Riggs.

Beginning in 2009, the Diamond Games in Antwerp was reorganized from a WTA tournament into an exhibition series. During her comeback, Clijsters played at the event three times, winning matches against Venus Williams in 2009, Henin in 2010, and world No. 1 Caroline Wozniacki in 2011. She continued to play at the event after retiring. The 2012 edition was named &quot;Kim&#x27;s Thank You Games&quot; in honor of her retirement, and the following year the event was known as the Kim Clijsters Invitational. In 2015, the Diamond Games were revived as a WTA event with Clijsters serving as the tournament director. She also played an exhibition set with finalist Andrea Petkovic after her opponent withdrew before the start of the championship match due to injury.

Since her retirement in 2012, Clijsters has regularly played in the legends, champions, and invitation doubles events at all four Grand Slam tournaments. One of her matches in the 2017 Wimbledon ladies&#x27; invitation doubles event drew public interest for Clijsters inviting a male spectator onto the court to play a few points. The spectator, Chris Quinn, had suggested Clijsters try a body serve when she had asked the crowd whether she should serve left or right. Before playing the points, she gave Quinn a women&#x27;s shirt and skort so that he could abide by Wimbledon&#x27;s all-white dress code. A video of the incident has over four million views on YouTube.

==Legacy==
Clijsters has been ranked as the 14th-greatest women&#x27;s tennis player in the Open Era by &quot;Tennis.com&quot;. Her 41 singles titles are the 14th-most in the Open Era. Since 2000, only the Williams sisters, Justine Henin, and Maria Sharapova have won more than her four Grand Slam singles titles. The three titles she won at the WTA Tour Championships are tied for the fifth-most in history behind only Martina Navratilova, Steffi Graf, Serena Williams, and Chris Evert. Clijsters was a champion at all four Grand Slam tournaments, winning the French Open and Wimbledon in doubles and the US Open and Australian Open in singles. Her prowess at singles and doubles is also highlighted by her becoming one of six players in WTA history to be No. 1 in the world in both rankings at the same time.

Clijsters and Henin are recognized for &quot;putting Belgium on the tennis map&quot;. Before they established themselves in the upper echelon of women&#x27;s tennis, Dominique Van Roost was the only player in Belgian history to be ranked in the top ten of the ATP or WTA rankings, a mark she did not achieve until 1998 after Clijsters and Henin turned professional. The Belgium Fed Cup team had never reached the quarterfinals until 1997 when they made the semifinals. With Clijsters on the team, Belgium made it to at least the semifinals four times, reaching the final in 2006 and winning the championship in 2001. She also became the first Belgian to be ranked No. 1 in each of singles and doubles. Belgium was regarded as dominating women&#x27;s tennis when Clijsters and Henin were the top two players in the world for several months in late 2003. After Clijsters&#x27;s retirement, she established the Kim Clijsters Academy in her hometown of Bree. The academy is run by Clijsters&#x27;s longtime coach Carl Maes and is intended to serve young players.

Clijsters was one of the most popular and well-liked players in tennis among both fans and her fellow players. She won the Karen Krantzcke Sportsmanship Award a record eight times. Clijsters was proud of her reputation as one of the nicest players on the WTA Tour, saying, &quot;I always try every day to be a good person and to be nice to others, and I think that&#x27;s probably the most important thing. I&#x27;m proud that I won tournaments and everything, but I want players to think that Kim was a nice person.&quot; Clijsters was also regarded as a source of inspiration to mothers on the WTA Tour, a role she embraced. She is one of three mothers to win a Grand Slam singles title, and her three such titles are tied with Margaret Court for the most of all time. Additionally, Clijsters is the only mother to be ranked No. 1 in the world since the start of the WTA rankings in 1975. She appeared on the &quot;Time&quot; 100 list in 2011 in large part because of her successful comeback.

==Playing style==

Clijsters is an all-court player who employed a mixture of offensive and defensive styles of play. On the defensive side, her movement is regarded as exceptional, enabling her to endure long rallies. Maria Sharapova has commented that, &quot;You just have to expect that she&#x27;s going to get every ball back.&quot;
In addition to her movement, Clijsters often extends points with her signature shot, a stretched-out wide forehand, also known as a squash shot. This type of forehand involves hitting the ball with slice to make up for being out of position. When hitting a squash shot on the run, Clijsters is known for her trademark play of sliding towards the ball and finishing in a split to extend her reach. While most players can only slide on clay, Clijsters can slide on any surface. Tennis journalist Peter Bodo has noted, &quot;Grass and hard courts do not &#x27;permit&#x27; sliding unless your name is Kim Clijsters.&quot;
The strengths of Clijsters&#x27;s game are built around playing aggressively to generate offense without losing control. She excels at hitting both forehand and backhand winners from the baseline. Clijsters is regarded as one of the best returners of serve and tries to &quot;take control of the point immediately... to [put herself] in an offensive position from the beginning&quot;. She was aggressive in the middle of points as well. While the squash shot is generally regarded as a defensive shot, Clijsters can turn it into an offensive weapon by placing it well enough to have time to recover into a good court position. Additionally, she possesses the ability to quickly move in from the baseline to the net, setting herself up to hit winners and finish points. She is adept at hitting swinging volleys on both the forehand and backhand sides because of her solid groundstroke technique. Clijsters credits her experience in doubles for improving her net game in singles, saying &quot;it made [her] focus on going to the net more&quot; and helped her &quot;know when to come to the net&quot;. Her coach Wim Fissette attributed her success at Grand Slam events after her comeback to being more aggressive than she was before her first retirement.

== Coaches ==
Clijsters worked with Belgian coaches throughout her career. Her first coach was Bart Van Kerckhoven, who she later invited to her championship match at the 2010 US Open. She began her professional career with Carl Maes as her coach. Maes was a student of Benny Vanhoudt who led the Saturday training sessions while Clijsters was also working with Vanhoudt in Diest. He moved to the Flemish Tennis Association Centre in Wilrijk when Clijsters was 13 years old and invited her to join him. In her first year in Wilrijk, she also worked with Marc De Hous. Maes coached Clijsters from 1996 to May 2002, during which she won the Fed Cup and finished as the runner-up at the 2001 French Open.

Shortly before the 2002 US Open, she hired De Hous as her new coach and continued to work with him through 2005. Under De Hous, Clijsters won two WTA Tour Championships and two Grand Slam doubles titles. They split a week after she won her first Grand Slam singles title at the 2005 US Open. It was reported that De Hous left because he was unhappy with only receiving a $7,500 bonus from her $2.2 million in US Open prize money; however, he denied this was his only financial compensation and attributed his departure to wanting to &quot;take on new challenges&quot; after all of their success in 2005. Clijsters opted to play without a coach from then until her first retirement.

When Clijsters began her comeback in 2009, she hired Wim Fissette to be her coach. Fissette, who is three years older, had trained with Clijsters under Vanhoudt when they were both juniors. He had also served as her hitting partner from 2005 until her first retirement. With Fissette as her coach, Clijsters won three more Grand Slam singles titles and regained the world No. 1 ranking. In June 2011, she rehired Maes as her coach, leading to Fissette&#x27;s departure several months later. Clijsters worked with Maes until her second retirement.

In 2020, coinciding with her second comeback, Clijsters announced Fred Hemmes Jr. as her new coach.

==Endorsements==
During her playing career, Clijsters was represented by Belgian company Golazo Sports. Babolat has sponsored her racquets since 1999, and she specifically has used the Pure Drive model. Fila has been Clijsters&#x27;s clothing sponsor since 2002. She had previously worn Nike apparel, but was not under contract.

Clijsters is conscious about selecting which products to endorse, saying, &quot;If it&#x27;s not healthy for kids, for example, I&#x27;m not going to endorse a product. I don&#x27;t want to give the wrong impression. We try to live a healthy lifestyle and if it doesn&#x27;t match me as a person, I turn it down.&quot; She has turned down Nutella in addition to endorsements that involved her daughter. While on tour, she endorsed banana supplier Chiquita and United Soft Drinks, the producer of the AA sports drink. Additionally, she was a brand ambassador for nutrition company USANA as well as the Citizen Watch Signature Collection. She also had endorsement deals with Belgian telecommunications company Telenet, personnel services firm Adecco, and the travel services company Thomas Cook Group.

Since Clijsters&#x27;s retirement, Van Lanschot banking helps sponsor the Kim Clijsters Academy.

==Personal life==
Clijsters is married to Brian Lynch, an American basketball coach and former player. The two met while Lynch was a member of Euphony Bree, and initially bonded over both having pet bulldogs. They became a couple in 2005 and married in 2007. They have three children: a daughter Jada (born 2008), and two sons Jack (born 2013) and Blake (born 2016). The family splits their time living in Bree and New Jersey.

Clijsters&#x27;s sister Elke, who is younger by a year and a half, was also a promising tennis player. Like Kim, Elke won two junior Grand Slam doubles titles. She was also the ITF World Junior Doubles Champion in 2002. On the professional tour, she achieved a top 400 ranking in singles and a top 250 ranking in doubles. Kim and Elke entered one doubles tournament together on the WTA Tour at the 2004 Diamond Games in Antwerp. They won their opening match against Selima Sfar and Caroline Vis before losing to the second-seeded team of Émilie Loit and Petra Mandula in the next round. Elke retired in 2004 at age 19 due to persistent back problems.

Early in her career, she was in a long-term relationship with Australian tennis player Lleyton Hewitt. They met at the 2000 Australian Open and were engaged before mutually ending their relationship in late 2004. The pair entered the mixed doubles event at Wimbledon in 2000, losing in the final. Their relationship earned Clijsters the nickname &quot;Aussie Kim&quot; and made her popular among Australian tennis fans even after they separated. When Clijsters won the 2011 Australian Open, she believed she earned her nickname, saying, &quot;Now you can finally call me Aussie Kim&quot;.

Clijsters&#x27;s childhood tennis idol was Steffi Graf. She cites her lone WTA Tour match against Graf at Wimbledon in 1999 as being very influential, saying, &quot;It was unbelievable. All I wanted to do was watch her. I wanted to see how she tied her shoelaces, what her ponytail looked like, how she carried her bag. Even though I lost, the impact of that and the motivation it gave me was huge. It was definitely the biggest moment of my career&quot;. She also looked up to Monica Seles and viewed both Graf and Seles as role models, drawing inspiration from their level of focus.

Clijsters is involved with multiple organizations that help children. She has served as an ambassador for SOS Children&#x27;s Villages since 2010. Clijsters founded Ten4Kim, a nonprofit that funds junior tennis players who cannot afford the costs associated with training at a high level.

While Clijsters retired, she served as a part-time coach to several players, including Elise Mertens and Yanina Wickmayer. She also occasionally was a commentator at the Grand Slam tournaments, working for the BBC and Fox Sports Australia at Wimbledon and for Channel 7 at the Australian Open.

<text>Digital Video Broadcasting – Satellite (DVB-S) is the original DVB standard for satellite television and dates from 1995, in its first release, while development lasted from 1993 to 1997. The first commercial applications were by Canal+ in France and Galaxy in Australia, enabling digitally broadcast, satellite-delivered television to the public. According to ETSI, 
It is used via satellites serving every continent of the world. DVB-S is used in both multiple channel per carrier (MCPC) and single channel per carrier modes for broadcast network feeds as well as for direct-broadcast satellite services like Sky UK and Ireland via Astra in Europe, Dish Network and Globecast in the U.S. and Bell Satellite TV in Canada.

While the actual DVB-S standard only specifies physical link characteristics and framing, the overlaid transport stream delivered by DVB-S is mandated as MPEG-2, known as MPEG transport stream (MPEG-TS).

Some amateur television repeaters also use this mode in the 1.2 GHz amateur band.

<text>DVB-T, short for Digital Video Broadcasting – Terrestrial, is the DVB European-based consortium standard for the broadcast transmission of digital terrestrial television that was first published in 1997 and first broadcast in Singapore in February 1998. This system transmits compressed digital audio, digital video and other data in an MPEG transport stream, using coded orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (COFDM or OFDM) modulation. It is also the format widely used worldwide (including North America) for Electronic News Gathering for transmission of video and audio from a mobile newsgathering vehicle to a central receive point.
It is also used in the US by amateur television operators.

==Basics==
Rather than carrying one data carrier on a single radio frequency (RF) channel, COFDM works by splitting the digital data stream into a large number of slower digital streams, each of which digitally modulates a set of closely spaced adjacent sub-carrier frequencies. In the case of DVB-T, there are two choices for the number of carriers known as 2K-mode or 8K-mode. These are actually 1,705 or 6,817 sub-carriers that are approximately 4 kHz or 1 kHz apart.

DVB-T offers three different modulation schemes (QPSK, 16QAM, 64QAM).

DVB-T has been adopted or proposed for digital television broadcasting by many countries (see map), using mainly VHF 7 MHz and UHF 8 MHz channels whereas Taiwan, Colombia, Panama and Trinidad and Tobago use 6 MHz channels. Examples include the UK&#x27;s Freeview.

The DVB-T Standard is published as EN 300 744, &quot;Framing structure, channel coding and modulation for digital terrestrial television&quot;. This is available from the ETSI website, as is ETSI TS 101 154, &quot;Specification for the use of Video and Audio Coding in Broadcasting Applications based on the MPEG-2 Transport Stream&quot;, which gives details of the DVB use of source coding methods for MPEG-2 and, more recently, H.264/MPEG-4 AVC as well as audio encoding systems. Many countries that have adopted DVB-T have published standards for their implementation. These include the D-book in the UK, the Italian DGTVi, the ETSI E-Book and the Nordic countries and Ireland NorDig.

DVB-T has been further developed into newer standards such as DVB-H (Handheld), which was a commercial failure and is no longer in operation, and DVB-T2, which was initially finalised in August 2011.

DVB-T as a digital transmission delivers data in a series of discrete blocks at the symbol rate. DVB-T is a COFDM transmission technique which includes the use of a Guard Interval. It allows the receiver to cope with strong multipath situations. Within a geographical area, DVB-T also allows single-frequency network (SFN) operation, where two or more transmitters carrying the same data operate on the same frequency. In such cases the signals from each transmitter in the SFN needs to be accurately time-aligned, which is done by sync information in the stream and timing at each transmitter referenced to GPS.

The length of the Guard Interval can be chosen. It is a trade-off between data rate and SFN capability. The longer the guard interval the larger is the potential SFN area without creating intersymbol interference (ISI).
It is possible to operate SFNs which do not fulfill the guard interval condition if the self-interference is properly planned and monitored.

==Technical description of a DVB-T transmitter==
With reference to the figure, a short description of the signal processing blocks follows.

* Source coding and MPEG-2 multiplexing (MUX): Compressed video, compressed audio, and data streams are multiplexed into MPEG program streams (MPEG-PSs). One or more MPEG-PSs are joined together into an MPEG transport stream (MPEG-TS); this is the basic digital stream which is being transmitted and received by TV sets or home Set Top Boxes (STB). Allowed bit rates for the transported data depend on a number of coding and modulation parameters: it can range from about 5 to about 32 Mbit/s (see the bottom figure for a complete listing).
* Splitter: Two different MPEG-TSs can be transmitted at the same time, using a technique called &quot;Hierarchical Transmission&quot;. It may be used to transmit, for example a standard definition SDTV signal and a high definition HDTV signal on the same carrier. Generally, the SDTV signal is more robust than the HDTV one. At the receiver, depending on the quality of the received signal, the STB may be able to decode the HDTV stream or, if signal strength lacks, it can switch to the SDTV one (in this way, all receivers that are in proximity of the transmission site can lock the HDTV signal, whereas all the other ones, even the farthest, may still be able to receive and decode an SDTV signal).
* MUX adaptation and energy dispersal: The MPEG-TS is identified as a sequence of data packets, of fixed length (188 bytes). With a technique called energy dispersal, the byte sequence is decorrelated.
* External encoder: A first level of error correction is applied to the transmitted data, using a non-binary block code, a Reed–Solomon RS (204, 188) code, allowing the correction of up to a maximum of 8 wrong bytes for each 188-byte packet.
* External interleaver: Convolutional interleaving is used to rearrange the transmitted data sequence, in such a way that it becomes more rugged to long sequences of errors.
* Internal encoder: A second level of error correction is given by a punctured convolutional code, which is often denoted in STBs menus as FEC (Forward error correction). There are five valid coding rates: 1/2, 2/3, 3/4, 5/6, and 7/8.
* Internal interleaver: Data sequence is rearranged again, aiming to reduce the influence of burst errors. This time, a block interleaving technique is adopted, with a pseudo-random assignment scheme (this is really done by two separate interleaving processes, one operating on bits and another one operating on groups of bits).
* Mapper: The digital bit sequence is mapped into a base band modulated sequence of complex symbols. There are three valid modulation schemes: QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM.
* Frame adaptation: the complex symbols are grouped in blocks of constant length (1512, 3024, or 6048 symbols per block). A frame is generated, 68 blocks long, and a &quot;superframe&quot; is built by 4 frames.
* Pilot and TPS signals: In order to simplify the reception of the signal being transmitted on the terrestrial radio channel, additional signals are inserted in each block. Pilot signals are used during the synchronization and equalization phase, while TPS signals (Transmission Parameters Signalling) send the parameters of the transmitted signal and to unequivocally identify the transmission cell. The receiver must be able to synchronize, equalize, and decode the signal to gain access to the information held by the TPS pilots. Thus, the receiver must know this information beforehand, and the TPS data is only used in special cases, such as changes in the parameters, resynchronizations, etc.

* OFDM modulation: The sequence of blocks is modulated according to the OFDM technique, using 1705 or 6817 carriers (2k or 8k mode, respectively). Increasing the number of carriers does not modify the payload bit rate, which remains constant.
* Guard interval insertion: to decrease receiver complexity, every OFDM block is extended, copying in front of it its own end (cyclic prefix). The width of such guard interval can be 1/32, 1/16, 1/8, or 1/4 that of the original block length. Cyclic prefix is required to operate single frequency networks, where there may exist an ineliminable interference coming from several sites transmitting the same program on the same carrier frequency.
* DAC and front-end: The digital signal is transformed into an analogue signal, with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and then modulated to radio frequency (VHF, UHF) by the RF front end. The occupied bandwidth is designed to accommodate each single DVB-T signal into 5, 6, 7, or 8 MHz wide channels. The base band sample rate provided at the DAC input depends on the channel bandwidth: it is formula_1 &quot;samples/s&quot;, where formula_2 is the channel bandwidth expressed in Hz.

==Technical description of the receiver==
The receiving STB adopts techniques which are dual to those ones used in the transmission.

* Front-end and ADC: the analogue RF signal is converted to base-band and transformed into a digital signal, using an analogue-to-digital converter (ADC).
* Time and frequency synchronization: the digital base band signal is searched to identify the beginning of frames and blocks. Any problems with the frequency of the components of the signal are corrected, too. The property that the guard interval at the end of the symbol is placed also at the beginning is exploited to find the beginning of a new OFDM symbol. On the other hand, continual pilots (whose value and position is determined in the standard and thus known by the receiver) determine the frequency offset suffered by the signal. This frequency offset might have been caused by Doppler effect, inaccuracies in either the transmitter or receiver clock, and so on. Generally, synchronization is done in two steps, either before or after the FFT, in such way to resolve both coarse and fine frequency/timing errors. Pre-FFT steps involve the use of sliding correlation on the received time signal, whereas Post-FFT steps use correlation between the frequency signal and the pilot carriers sequence.
* Guard interval disposal: the cyclic prefix is removed.
* OFDM demodulation: this is achieved with an FFT.
* Frequency equalization: the pilot signals are used to estimate the Channel Transfer Function (CTF) every three subcarriers. The CTF is derived in the remaining subcarriers via interpolation. The CTF is then used to equalize the received data in each subcarrier, generally using a Zero-Forcing method (multiplication by CTF inverse). The CTF is also used to weigh the reliability of the demapped data when they are provided to the Viterbi decoder. 
* Demapping: since there are Gray-encoded QAM constellations, demapping is done in a &quot;soft&quot; way using nonlinear laws that demap each bit in the received symbol to a more or less reliable fuzzy value between -1 and +1.
* Internal deinterleaving
* Internal decoding: uses the Viterbi algorithm, with a traceback length larger than that generally used for the basic 1/2 rate code, due to the presence of punctured (&quot;erased&quot;) bits.
* External deinterleaving
* External decoding
* MUX adaptation
* MPEG-2 demultiplexing and source decoding

<text>A line dance is a choreographed dance in which a group of people dance along to a repeating sequence of steps while arranged in one or more lines or rows. These lines usually face all in the same direction, or less commonly face each other. Unlike circle dancing, line dancers are not in physical contact with each other. Each dance is usually associated with, and named for, a specific song, such as the Macarena or the Electric Slide (associated with the 1982 single &quot;Electric Boogie&quot;) which are a few of the line dances that have consistently remained part of modern American culture for years.

Line dancing is practiced and learned in country-western dance bars, social clubs, dance clubs and ballrooms. It is sometimes combined on dance programs with other forms of country-western dance, such as two-step, western promenade dances, and as well as western-style variants of the waltz, polka and swing. Line dances have accompanied many popular music styles since the early 1970s including pop, swing, rock and roll, disco, Latin (salsa suelta), rhythm and blues and jazz.

The term &quot;modern line dance&quot; is now used in many line dance clubs around the world to indicate dance styles that combine many genres, including pop, Latin, Irish, big band and country. Rather than wearing Western-style clothing or boots, participants dress in casual clothing and often wear dance trainers.

==History==

The precise origins of line dancing are not entirely clear. Of the confusion, music historian Christy Lane has stated that &quot;If you were to ask 10 people with some knowledge of when line dancing began, you&#x27;d probably get 10 different answers&quot;. By and large, the growth and popularity of line dancing has mainly been tied to country and western music.

It is likely that at least some of the steps and terminology used in modern line dancing originated from the dances brought to North America by European immigrants in the 1800s. Throughout the 1860s–1890s, the style that would later be known as country–western dance began to emerge from these dances. Schools in the United States began to incorporate dancing, particularly folk dancing, into physical education classes in the 1900s, which popularized folk and country dancing as a social activity. Finally, servicemen returning from World War I and World War II sometimes brought European dances back to the United States, incorporating elements into American dance styles. 

=== 1950s–1970s: development of style ===
One of the first true line dances was the Madison, a novelty dance created and first danced in Columbus, Ohio, in 1957. The local popularity of the dance and record in Baltimore, Maryland, came to the attention of the producers of &quot;The Buddy Deane Show&quot; in 1960, which led to other dance shows picking it up. The 1961 &quot;San Francisco Stomp&quot; meets the definition of a line dance. 

During the disco music era of the 1970s, numerous new dance styles emerged, including many line dances choreographed to disco songs. The &quot;L.A. Hustle&quot;, a modified version of the Madison, began in a small Los Angeles disco in the summer of 1975, and hit the East Coast (with modified steps) in the spring of 1976 as the &quot;Bus Stop&quot;. Another 70s line dance is the Nutbush, performed to Tina Turner&#x27;s song &quot;Nutbush City Limits&quot;. The popular dance Electric Slide, associated with the song &quot;Electric Boogie,&quot; was created in 1976. The song &quot;Electric Boogie&quot; was originally released by Marcia Griffiths in December 1982. It was written by Bunny Wailer exclusively for Griffiths, reaching the top spots in popularity in Jamaica in early1983, achieving moderate international success. In 1989, the song was remixed and re-released, this time gaining significant popularity. It reached number 51 on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, becoming Griffiths&#x27; most successful single. The song also helped popularize the &quot;electric slide&quot; dance. 

The release of the film &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot; in 1977 took disco and its associated dance styles to a new height of popularity. 

Line dancing to country music also became popular during this era, with two notable dances dating to 1972: the Walkin&#x27; Wazi and the Cowboy Boogie.

=== 1980s–present ===

The 1980 film &quot;Urban Cowboy&quot; caused a trend for country and western culture, particularly the associated dance, music, and clothing. Over a dozen line dances were created for country songs during the 1980s. Many other early line dances were adaptations of disco line dance. The Chicken Dance is an example of a line dance adopted by the Mod revival during the 1980s.

The music video for the 1990 Billy Ray Cyrus song &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot; has been credited for launching line dancing into the mainstream.

In the 1990s, the hit Spanish dance song &quot;Macarena&quot; inspired a popular line dance.

A line dance for the 1990 Asleep at the Wheel single &quot;Boot Scootin&#x27; Boogie&quot; was choreographed by Bill Bader. The 1992 Brooks &amp; Dunn cover of the song has resulted in there being at least 16 line dances with &quot;Boot Scootin&#x27; Boogie&quot; in the title. Billy Ray Cyrus&#x27; 1992 hit &quot;Achy Breaky Heart&quot; helped catapult western line dancing into the mainstream public consciousness. In 1994 choreographer Max Perry had a worldwide dance hit with &quot;Swamp Thang&quot; for the song &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; by The Grid. This was a techno song that fused banjo sounds in the melody line and helped to start a trend of line dancing to forms of music other than country. In this mid-1990s period, country western music was significantly influenced by the popularity of line dancing.

Max Perry, along with Jo Thompson Szymanski, Scott Blevins and several others, began to use ballroom rhythms and technique to take line dancing to the next level. In 1997, the band Steps created further interest outside of the U.S. with the techno dance song &quot;5,6,7,8&quot;. In 1999, American retailer Gap Inc. debuted the &quot;Khaki Country&quot; ad at that year&#x27;s Academy Awards ceremony, in which line dancers performed to the 1999 version of &quot;Crazy Little Thing Called Love&quot; by Dwight Yoakam.

The arrival of the Country Music Television channel to Europe fed the popularity of line dancing there. In 2008, line dancing gained the attention of the French government.

Based on per capita ranking of MeetUp Groups in the US, Durham, N.C. was declared the line dancing capital of America in 2014.

==Wall==
Each dance is said to consist of a number of &quot;walls&quot;. A wall is the direction in which the dancers face at any given time: the front (the direction faced at the beginning of the dance), the back, or one of the sides. Dancers may change direction many times during a sequence, and may even, at any given point, face in a direction halfway between two walls. At the end of the sequence, they will face the original wall or any of the other three. Whichever wall that is, the next iteration of the sequence uses that wall as the new frame of reference.

* In a &quot;one-wall dance&quot;, the dancers face the same direction at the end of the sequence as at the beginning (either no turn or a full turn, 360 degrees).
* In a &quot;two-wall dance&quot;, repetitions of the sequence end alternately at the back and front walls. In other words, the dancers have effectively turned through 180 degrees during one set (half turn). The samba line dance is an example of a two-wall dance. While doing the &quot;volte&quot; step, the dancers turn 180 degrees to face a new wall.
* In a &quot;four-wall dance&quot;, the direction faced at the end of the sequence is 90 degrees to the right or left from the direction in which they faced at the beginning (quarter turn). As a result, the dancers face each of the four walls in turn at the end of four consecutive repetitions of the sequence, before returning to the original wall. The hustle line dance is an example of a four-wall dance because in the final figure they turn 90 degrees to the left to face a new wall. In some dances, they turn 270 degrees, a &quot;three-quarter turn,&quot; to face the new wall.

<text>Digital Video Broadcasting - Cable (DVB-C) is the DVB European consortium standard for the broadcast transmission of digital television over cable. This system transmits an MPEG-2 or MPEG-4 family digital audio/digital video stream, using a QAM modulation with channel coding. The standard was first published by the ETSI in 1994, and subsequently became the most widely used transmission system for digital cable television in Europe, Asia and South America. It is deployed worldwide in systems ranging from the larger cable television networks (CATV) down to smaller satellite master antenna TV (SMATV) systems.

== Technical description ==
=== DVB-C transmitter ===

With reference to the figure, a short description of the single processing blocks follows.

* Source coding and MPEG-2 multiplexing (MUX): video, audio, and data streams are multiplexed into an MPEG program stream (MPEG-PS). One or more MPEG-PSs are joined together into an MPEG transport stream (MPEG-TS). This is the basic digital stream which is being transmitted and received by home set top boxes (STB) or relevant integrable decoder (e.g. Conax) module. Allowed bit rates for the transported MPEG-2 depend on a number of modulation parameters: it can range from about 6 to about 64 Mbit/s (see the bottom figure for a complete listing).
* MUX adaptation and energy dispersal: the MPEG-TS is identified as a sequence of data packets, of fixed length (188 bytes). With a technique called energy dispersal, the byte sequence is decorrelated.
* External encoder: a first level of protection is applied to the transmitted data, using a nonbinary block code, a Reed–Solomon RS (204, 188) code, allowing the correction of up to a maximum of 8 wrong bytes for each 188-byte packet.
* External interleaver: convolutional interleaving is used to rearrange the transmitted data sequence, such way it becomes more rugged to long sequences of errors.
* Byte/m-tuple conversion: data bytes are encoded into bit &quot;m&quot;-tuples (&quot;m&quot; = 4, 5, 6, 7, or 8).
* Differential coding: In order to get a rotation-invariant constellation, this unit shall apply a differential encoding of the two Most Significant Bits (MSBs) of each symbol.
* QAM Mapper: the bit sequence is mapped into a base-band digital sequence of complex symbols. There are 5 allowed modulation modes: 16-QAM, 32-QAM, 64-QAM, 128-QAM, 256-QAM.
* Base-band shaping: the QAM signal is filtered with a raised-cosine shaped filter, in order to remove mutual signal interference at the receiving side.
* DAC and front-end: the digital signal is transformed into an analog signal, with a digital-to-analog converter (DAC), and then modulated to radio frequency by the RF front-end.

=== DVB-C receiver ===
The receiving STB adopts techniques which are dual to those ones used in the transmission.

* Front-end and ADC: the analog RF signal is converted to base-band and transformed into a digital signal, using an analog-to-digital converter (ADC).
* QAM Demodulation
* Equalization
* Differential decoding
* Outer interleaving
* Outer decoding
* MUX adaptation
* MPEG-2 demultiplexing and source decoding
* Programmable Transport Stream

== DVB-C2 ==
On February 18, 2008 it was announced that a new standard – DVB-C2 – would be developed during 2008, and a &quot;Call for Technologies&quot; was issued. Proposals including simulation programs and information on patent rights could be submitted until June 16, 2008.

&quot;The results of the DVB-C2 Study Mission already provided clear indications that technologies are available allowing the performance of the second generation DVB cable transmission system to get so close to the theoretical Shannon Limit that any further improvements in the future would most likely not be able to justify the introduction of a disruptive third generation of cable transmission system.&quot; (DVB-C2 CfT)

By using state of the art coding and modulation techniques, DVB-C2 should offer greater than 30% higher spectrum efficiency under the same conditions, and the gains in downstream channel capacity will be greater than 60% for optimized HFC networks.

The final DVB-C2 specification was approved by the DVB Steering Board in April 2009.

DVB-C2 allows bit rates up to 83.1 Mbit/s on an 8 MHz channel bandwidth when using 4096-QAM modulation; future extensions will allow up to 97 Mbit/s and 110.8 Mbit/s per channel using 16384-QAM and 65536-AQAM modulation.

<text>Maxwell Frank Clifford (6 April 1943 – 10 December 2017) was an English publicist who was particularly associated with promoting &quot;kiss and tell&quot; stories in tabloid newspapers.

In December 2012, as part of Operation Yewtree, Clifford was arrested on suspicion of sexual offences. He was sentenced to eight years in prison in May 2014 after being found guilty of eight counts of indecent assault on four girls and women aged between 15 and 19. He died in December 2017 after suffering a heart attack in HM Prison Littlehey.

==Early life==
Maxwell Frank Clifford was born in Kingston upon Thames on 6 April 1943, the son of Lilian (&quot;née&quot; Boffee) and electrician Frank Clifford. He was the youngest of four children, with one sister and two brothers. The family survived their father&#x27;s regular bouts of unemployment, gambling, and alcoholism with the help and support of their grandmother and Clifford&#x27;s sister, who was employed as a PA to the London Vice-President of Morgan Guarantee Trust Bank. Clifford left school at 15 with no qualifications, and he was sacked within four months of his first job at Ely&#x27;s department store in Wimbledon. His brother Bernard used his print union connections to secure Clifford a job as editorial assistant on the &quot;Eagle&quot;. When the publication moved premises, Clifford decided to take redundancy, buying his first house and finding work with the &quot;South London Press&quot; to train as a journalist.

==Career==
===Early work as a publicist===
After working in newspapers for a few years, writing an occasional record/music column and running a disco, Clifford replied to an advertisement and joined as the second member of the EMI press office in 1962, under Chief Press Officer Syd Gillingham. As the youngest and the only trained journalist in a team of four, Clifford claimed he was given the job of promoting the then relatively unknown Beatles, including during their first tour of the United States.

After Gillingham left EMI, he asked Clifford to join him at Chris Hutchins&#x27;s PR agency. Among the artists they represented were Paul and Barry Ryan, who introduced Clifford to their stepfather, impresario Harold Davidson, who handled the UK affairs of Frank Sinatra and Judy Garland.

In 1970, aged 27, and after Gillingham retired, Clifford left Hutchins and started his own agency, Max Clifford Associates. Based in the offices of Joe Cocker&#x27;s manager, he started off by representing Sinatra, Cocker, Paul and Barry Ryan, Don Partridge, and Marvin Gaye. He later also represented Muhammad Ali and Marlon Brando. Former LWT Press Officer 1980–1984, Rosie Brocklehurst said Clifford attempted to elicit favours from LWT press officers in return for other favourable coverage. He was particularly interested in salacious gossip on LWT Light Entertainment celebrities. In 1989, when she had moved to work for Equity, the actors&#x27; union, Brocklehurst received a call from &#x27;a terrified young actress&#x27; who had been persuaded to give a particularly career damaging &#x27;kiss and tell&#x27; story about an incestuous relationship to Clifford as a means of giving her career a boost. The story was due to run in the News of the World but the young actress said it had been entirely fabricated, and that Clifford and she did not know how to get out of it. Brocklehurst called Clifford and persuaded him to drop the story.

===Pamella Bordes===
Clifford was approached by a brothel madame, who had provided one of Clifford&#x27;s clients with various services, worried about publicity from an investigative reporter from the &quot;News of the World&quot;. Clifford asked the madame to reveal details of her girls and clients, and found that one prostitute, Pamella Bordes, was simultaneously dating Andrew Neil (then editor of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;), Donald Trelford (then editor of &quot;The Observer&quot;), Conservative minister for sport Colin Moynihan, and billionaire arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. Clifford rang &quot;News of the World&quot; editor Patsy Chapman and drip-fed her the story of Bordes through the investigative reporter she was using on the madam. The story was published in March 1989 under the headline &quot;Call Girl Works in Commons&quot;, since it was discovered she had a House of Commons security pass arranged by MPs David Shaw and Henry Bellingham. Clifford claimed Bordes was never his client, and that he earned his fee for &quot;writing&quot; the story, which ultimately served the purpose of saving the madame from any adverse publicity or court case.

===Clients===
Clifford came to public attention after creating the infamous &quot;Freddie Starr ate my hamster&quot; headline in 1986 for &quot;The Sun&quot; in an effort to draw attention to his client, Freddie Starr. In May 2006 the BBC nominated &quot;Freddie Starr ate my hamster&quot; as one of the most familiar British newspaper headlines over the last century. Clifford later represented various clients, including former Liverpool left-wing politician Derek Hatton, for whom Clifford created an affair to change his image; O. J. Simpson, for which reason Clifford claimed to have received death threats; Gillian McKeith, whose adverts he believed harmed her image; Rebecca Loos, when she negotiated with the press about her alleged affair with England football captain David Beckham; and Jade Goody, during the reality star&#x27;s cervical cancer and death. Clifford represented Simon Cowell for over a decade and was credited with shaping his public image; Cowell dropped Clifford following Clifford&#x27;s 2014 conviction. In 2016, a judge awarded former client Paul Burrell £5,000 damages after Burrell sued Clifford, saying that Clifford forwarded private material in a fax to Rebekah Brooks at &quot;News of the World&quot; in 2002.

Journalist Louis Theroux followed Clifford in the BBC Two series When Louis Met... in a 2002 episode titled &quot;When Louis Met ... Max Clifford&quot;. During filming, it appeared that Clifford was trying to set up Theroux during a PR stunt in Sainsbury&#x27;s. It backfired after Clifford was heard lying on his microphone, unaware it was still on.

Clifford represented a witness in the case against Gary Glitter. In 2005, Clifford paid damages to settle defamation proceedings brought by Neil and Christine Hamilton after he represented Nadine Milroy-Sloane, who was later found to have falsely accused the pair of sexual assault. Also in 2005, he told reporters that he would not represent Michael Jackson after he was found not guilty of child abuse charges, saying: &quot;It would be the hardest job in PR after [representing] Saddam Hussein&quot;. Following the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal, but prior to his arrest, Clifford claimed that dozens of &quot;big name stars&quot; contacted him and feared they would become implicated in the scandal; he claimed that in the 1960s and 70s they &quot;never asked for anybody&#x27;s birth certificate&quot; before having sex.

====LGBT clients====
Clifford helped clients who wished to conceal their sexual orientation from the public. He claimed that he was approached twice by major football clubs to help make players present a &quot;straight&quot; image. In an interview with &quot;Pink News&quot;, reported on 5 August 2009, Clifford said that if a gay or bisexual football player came out, his career would be over:

To my knowledge there is only one top-flight professional gay footballer who came out – Justin Fashanu. He ended up committing suicide. I have been advising a top premiership star who is bisexual. If it came out that he had gay tendencies, his career would be over in two minutes. Should it be? No, but if you go on the terraces and hear the way fans are, and also, that kind of general attitude that goes with football, it&#x27;s almost like going back to the dark ages.

Clifford said none of his clients had been outed.

In December 2009, he told &quot;The Independent on Sunday&quot; that he had represented two high-profile Premier League footballers in the past five years whom he advised to stay in the closet because football &quot;remains in the dark ages, steeped in homophobia&quot;.

===Politics===
Clifford stated that what motivated him was much more than just money; he said he could not stand hypocrisy in public life, reserved a particular disgust for lying politicians, and watched with growing anger what he thought happened to the National Health Service over the past 20 years. For this reason, and because of his working-class background, Clifford was a traditional Labour supporter who worked to bring down the government of John Major because he felt that the NHS was being mismanaged.

====The Major government====
In light of Clifford&#x27;s view of the deteriorating state of the NHS – having obtained treatment for his daughter, who had been diagnosed with juvenile idiopathic arthritis – and moral differences with members of the John Major government, Clifford worked to expose stories to help the Labour Party to power. Although not instrumental in exposing David Mellor&#x27;s affair with Antonia de Sancha, Clifford&#x27;s battle in representing de Sancha against the contrived post-spin story of the &quot;family man Mellor&quot; handled by counter PR Timothy Bell ultimately derailed Major&#x27;s &#x27;Back to Basics&#x27; agenda. Clifford invented the story which claimed Mellor made love in a Chelsea F.C. football kit, though he was blocked from mentioning it in his memoirs. Clifford also helped to expose Jeffrey Archer&#x27;s perjury in the 1980s during his candidacy for the post of Mayor of London.

On 18 February 1995 he was interviewed at length by Andrew Neil for his one-on-one interview show &quot;Is This Your Life?&quot;, made by Open Media for Channel 4.

====The Blair government====
Although a supporter of the Labour Party, Clifford&#x27;s approach in dealing with the Blair government was similar to that which he employed with Major&#x27;s preceding Conservative government. The first instance of this was the story of the Secretary of State for Wales, Ron Davies. Clifford was subsequently accused by David Blunkett, at the beginning of November 2005, of having a role in Blunkett&#x27;s second resignation. This derived from claims made on behalf of a much younger woman, who had become involved with Blunkett, over Blunkett&#x27;s business interests, which were published in &quot;The Times&quot;. Later that week, Clifford was accused of arranging a distraction from the assault made by his friend Rebekah Wade on her then husband, &quot;EastEnders&quot; actor Ross Kemp, via the &quot;coincidence&quot; of the other &quot;Mitchell brother&quot;, Steve McFadden being in a similar incident with an ex-partner. Clifford denied all responsibility.

On 26 April 2006, Clifford represented John Prescott&#x27;s diary secretary Tracey Temple, in selling her story for &quot;an awful lot more&quot; than £100,000 to the &quot;Mail on Sunday&quot;. The story was about the affair between Prescott and Temple which took place between 2002 and 2004.

On 4 May 2006, Clifford announced his intention to expose politicians who fail to abide by the standards expected of them in public office. He called his team of undercover investigators &quot;a dedicated and loyal bunch&quot;.

Although he usually backed Labour, Clifford supported, and did some publicity work for, UKIP during the 2004 European election campaign. Clifford said at the time that &quot;The UK Independence Party and myself are in complete agreement that the British people should be the masters of their own destiny through our parliament at Westminster, not subservient to Brussels.&quot;

===Charity works===
According to his memoirs he handled the publicity for the Daniels family and helped set up the Rhys Daniels Trust from resultant media fees to combat Batten disease. Clifford was also a patron of the Royal Marsden; however, after his conviction, staff at the hospital stated he was no longer a patron. Also, following his 2014 conviction for indecent assault, Shooting Star CHASE and Woking and Sam Beare Hospices announced that Clifford was no longer a patron for either charity.

==Indecent assault convictions==

Clifford was arrested at his home on 6 December 2012 by Metropolitan Police officers on suspicion of sexual offences; the arrest was part of Operation Yewtree which was set up in the wake of the Jimmy Savile sexual abuse scandal. He was taken to a central London police station for questioning. The two alleged offences dated from 1977.

On 26 April 2013, he was charged with a further eleven indecent assaults between 1966 and 1985 on girls and women aged 14 to 19. Clifford claimed the allegations were &quot;completely false&quot;.

On 28 May 2013, Clifford pleaded not guilty at Westminster Magistrates&#x27; Court; a hearing took place at Southwark Crown Court on 12 June 2013 when a date for his trial was set for 4 March 2014.

On 28 April 2014, Clifford was convicted of eight counts of indecent assault against four victims by a jury at Southwark Crown Court. He was acquitted of two charges of indecent assault, and the jury failed to reach a verdict on another charge. Following the verdict the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children&#x27;s Director of National Services Peter Watt stated:
Max Clifford has rightly been unmasked as a ruthless and manipulative sex offender who preyed for decades on children and young women. On 2 May 2014, Judge Anthony Leonard sentenced Clifford to a total of eight years in prison. Judge Leonard told Clifford he should serve at least half his sentence in prison, adding that he was sure Clifford had also assaulted a 12-year-old girl in Spain, although this charge could not be pursued in the British courts.

The judge added that if the offences had taken place after the law was changed in 2003, several of the offences of which Clifford was found guilty would have been tried as rape, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment. One of Clifford&#x27;s victims explained to the court that Clifford&#x27;s assault on her (at age 15) had prevented her from having her first sexual relationship with a partner her own age, while another said that in the years following the assault she had cried whenever she saw Clifford on television, and had feared that the police would laugh at her. Clifford dismissed his victims as &quot;fantasists&quot; and &quot;opportunists&quot;. The judge concluded that Clifford had caused an &quot;additional element of trauma&quot; to his victims by his &quot;contemptuous attitude&quot; during the trial.

On 7 November 2014, Clifford&#x27;s appeal against his eight-year sentence for sex offences was rejected by the Court of Appeal. The court ruled the sentence handed to Clifford earlier that year was &quot;justified and correct.&quot; The court compared Clifford&#x27;s case with that of broadcaster Stuart Hall in 2013; Clifford had clowned and claimed innocence, but did not directly dispute the claims of his victims. In contrast Hall had publicly denounced his victims and accused one of seeking &quot;instant notoriety&quot;. A lawyer commented on the Clifford appeal court ruling &quot;Nothing Clifford did resembled the disastrous approach taken by Stuart Hall who, prior to pleading guilty to abusing them as girls, denounced his accusers as gold-diggers and liars.&quot; Clifford&#x27;s actions were deemed merely to show no remorse, and not to justify an increased penalty on appeal, although ruling out a reduction in sentence due to mitigating factors; in contrast Hall&#x27;s sentence was actually increased on appeal.

It was reported on 12 March 2015 that Clifford had been arrested again by Operation Yewtree police. On 3 July 2015, Clifford was charged with a single count of indecent assault stemming from an alleged incident from 1981. He pleaded not guilty on 20 October, and was cleared by a jury of the charge on 7 July 2016.

Before his death, Clifford had won the right to challenge his conviction at the Court of Appeal and his daughter, Louise, continued to challenge his 2014 conviction afterwards posthumously. Clifford&#x27;s conviction was ultimately upheld on 2 April 2019 and the Court of Appeal comprehensively rejected his appeal on all grounds. Lady Justice Rafferty said: &quot;Nothing we heard came anywhere near imperilling the safety of this conviction&quot;.

==Personal life==
Clifford married Elizabeth Louise Porter at St Barnabas Church in Southfields, London, on 3 June 1967. Porter died of lung cancer in Sutton, on 8 April 2003. the couple had one daughter, Louise (1971–2023).

In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Clifford ran and took part in weekly adult parties for his friends and clients around London. This brought him into contact with various madams and prostitutes, a connection which he later used to satisfy the needs of his clients, and introduced him to deviant behaviour.

Part of the evidence for his trial of various indecent assaults revolved around the size of his penis, with victims describing it as both a micropenis, and enormous. A doctor measured Clifford&#x27;s penis at five and a quarter inches long when flaccid, and this fact was used in an attempt to discredit the victims&#x27; evidence as unreliable.

In March 2010, the &quot;News of the World&quot; settled out of court after Clifford sought legal action against it for intercepting his voicemail. After a lunch with editor Rebekah Brooks, the paper agreed to pay Clifford&#x27;s legal fees and an undisclosed &quot;personal payment&quot; not described as damages. The sum exceeded £1 million. The money was paid in exchange for him exclusively giving the paper stories over the next several years.

Clifford lived in Hersham, Surrey, before his incarceration. On 4 April 2010, he married his former PA, Jo Westwood; wedding guests included Des O&#x27;Connor, Bobby Davro, and Theo Paphitis. In May 2014, Westwood was granted a decree nisi, subsequently ending her four-year marriage to Clifford.

On 18 August 2014, Clifford was allowed out of HM Prison Littlehey, handcuffed to a prison officer, to attend his brother Bernard&#x27;s funeral at the North East Surrey Crematorium in South West London. This was also to be his last public appearance, three years before his death on 10 December 2017.

==Death==
On 7 December 2017, Clifford collapsed in HM Prison Littlehey after trying to clean his cell. He was taken to Hinchingbrooke Hospital, near Huntingdon, where he died of a heart attack three days later, on 10 December, at the age of 74.

The inquest into Clifford&#x27;s death heard medical evidence of his poor health leading up to his death. On 18 December 2019, the coroner ruled that he had died of natural causes.

<text>Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (; 2 April 1755 – 2 February 1826) was a French lawyer and politician, who, as the author of &quot;Physiologie du goût&quot; (&quot;The Physiology of Taste&quot;), became celebrated for his culinary reminiscences and reflections on the craft and science of cookery and the art of eating.

Rising to modest eminence in the last years of France&#x27;s Ancien Régime, Brillat-Savarin had to escape into exile when the Reign of Terror began in 1793. He spent nearly three years in the United States, teaching French and playing the violin to support himself, before returning to France when it became safe to do so, resuming his career as a lawyer, and rising to the top of the French judiciary.

&quot;The Physiology of Taste&quot; was the product of many years&#x27; writing in the author&#x27;s spare time. Published weeks before his death in 1826, the work established him alongside Grimod de La Reynière as one of the founders of the genre of the gastronomic essay.

==Life and career==
===Early years===

Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin was born on 2 April 1755 in the small cathedral city of Belley, Ain, 80 kilometres (50 miles) east of Lyon and a similar distance south of Bourg-en-Bresse. Belley was the principal city of the region of Bugey, which had been absorbed into France under the 1601 Treaty of Lyon.

Brillat-Savarin was descended on both sides from families of lawyers; his father, Marc-Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, was a leading lawyer in the city and his mother, Claudine-Aurore &quot;née&quot; Récamier, was the daughter of Belley&#x27;s Notary Royal. Jean Anthelme was the eldest of the couple&#x27;s eight children; of his two brothers, Xavier followed into the legal profession and Frédéric became an army officer. 

In the household and region in which Brillat-Savarin grew up, good food was taken seriously; his relation and fellow lawyer wrote:

Brillat-Savarin learned from friends and acquaintances of his parents many unusual things about food, including a three-day method of cooking spinach, how to eat small game birds like ortolans, and how to prepare chocolate for drinking. His formal education proceeded along more conventional lines: he entered the Collège de Belley in 1764 or 1765. Although founded as a religious institution and with many of its staff in holy orders, the college was secular in outlook; theology was not in the curriculum and the library contained works on agriculture and science as well as books by La Rochefoucauld, Montesquieu, Rabelais, Voltaire and Rousseau. As a schoolboy Brillat-Savarin took up the violin; he loved playing it, and although destined for the law he hankered for a while after a career as a violinist.

In the spring of 1774 Brillat-Savarin enrolled at the University of Dijon. His main study was law, but he undertook some extracurricular studies in medicine and attended lectures in chemistry by Louis-Bernard Guyton de Morveau, who became a friend and helpful counsellor.

===Ancien Régime and revolution===

After graduating in 1778 Brillat-Savarin returned to Belley and practised law, making his first court appearance in September. He made good progress in his profession, and in 1781 he was appointed as a magistrate in the local civil court – &quot;lieutenant civil du bailliage&quot;. As he became more eminent locally he became involved with seeking action to alleviate the deprivations of the poor caused by years of financial crisis and poor harvests. In 1787 he first visited the royal residence, the Château de Versailles; his purpose may have been to seek help for the poor of his region, but he left no details of his mission.

Riots broke out in Grenoble in June 1788 in protest against the abolition of traditional and supposedly guaranteed local freedoms, and it became clear that effective government had so seriously collapsed that Louis XVI would have to summon a meeting of the Estates General, the closest approximation in Ancien Régime France to a national parliament; it had not met since 1614, and in the words of the historian Karen Diane Haywood it &quot;generally met only in dire situations when the king and his ministers had no other choice&quot;.
When the King summoned the Estates General in 1789 Brillat-Savarin was elected to represent the Third Estate of Belley. In a biographical sketch Anne Drayton observes &quot;there was nothing of the revolutionary in his make-up&quot;, and when the Estates General reformed as the National Constituent Assembly he made speeches opposing the division of France into eighty-three administrative departments, the introduction of trial by jury and the abolition of capital punishment. 

At the end of his term of office in September 1791 Brillat-Savarin returned home as president of the civil tribunal of the new department of Ain, but as politics in Paris became increasingly radical, with the abolition of the monarchy, he was &quot;persona non grata&quot; with the new regime, and was dismissed from his post for royalist sympathies. Such was his popularity among his fellow citizens that in December 1792 he was elected mayor of Belley. For nearly a year he strove to protect his city from the excesses of the revolution, but when the Reign of Terror began in September 1793 he felt increasingly at risk of arrest and execution. 

On 10 or 11 December he fled from France to Switzerland, where he took up residence in Lausanne. He later stayed with relations in Moudon, from whom he learnt his celebrated and later controversial recipe for fondue. He was joined by a fellow exile, Jean-Antoine de Rostaing, whose father, the Marquis Just-Antoine de Rostaing, had fought with the French forces in the American War of Independence. Rostaing suggested sailing to the United States; Brillat-Savarin agreed. They made their way to Rotterdam, where they took ship for an eighty-day voyage to Manhattan, disembarking on 30 September 1794.

===American exile===
Brillat-Savarin remained in the US for nearly two years, supporting himself by giving French and violin lessons. His biographer Giles MacDonogh observes, &quot;He awarded himself the title of &quot;Professeur&quot;, by which he jocularly referred to himself to the end of his days&quot;. He also played first violin in America&#x27;s only professional orchestra, at the John Street Theatre, New York. He later had fond memories of his time in America:
While staying with a friend in Hartford, Connecticut he shot a wild turkey and brought it back to the kitchen: he wrote of the roast bird that it was, &quot;charming to behold, pleasing to smell, and delicious to taste&quot;. One of his favourite memories of his American stay was an evening at Little&#x27;s Tavern in New York when he and two other French &quot;émigrés&quot; beat two Englishmen in a competitive drinking bout, in which they all consumed large quantities of claret, port, Madeira and punch.

===Return to France===
Rostaing grew tired of life in the US and returned to France in May 1795. Without him Brillat-Savarin was deprived of the closest friend of his years of exile. He continued to amuse himself with, among other diversions, what a biographer calls &quot;undoubtedly numerous&quot; encounters with the opposite sex; Brillat-Savarin commented, &quot;being able to speak the language and flirt with women, I was able to reap the richest rewards&quot;. He hoped, nonetheless, to return to France, not least because he was running short of funds, and he sailed for home, arriving at the end of August 1796. By this time the political scene in France was no longer dominated by extremists: Robespierre and his allies from the Reign of Terror had fallen and France was ruled by the more moderate Directory. Brillat-Savarin persuaded the authorities that the legal penalties imposed on &quot;émigrés&quot; should be rescinded in his case. 

Through the influence of Rostaing, Brillat-Savarin was appointed as secretary to the staff of General Charles-Pierre Augereau, who led the French army fighting on the Rhine. Drayton comments that by this time Brillat-Savarin had obviously acquired a certain reputation as a gourmet, &quot;for he was promptly put in charge of catering for the general staff, a task which he performed to the delighted satisfaction of his fellow officers&quot;. 

After the end of the Rhine campaign the Directory appointed him as President of the Criminal Court of the Ain Department, based in Bourg-en-Bresse, in 1798, and then State Prosecutor for the Department of Seine-et-Oise, based in Versailles. After Napoleon Bonaparte engineered the fall of the Directory and establishment of the Consulate in 1799, Brillat-Savarin was appointed as a judge in the &quot;Tribunal de cassation&quot;, the supreme court of appeal, which sat in Paris. He was awarded the Legion of Honour in 1804, and in 1808 Napoleon made him a &quot;Chevalier de l&#x27;Empire&quot;.

===Later years===
For the rest of his life Brillat-Savarin led a contented existence, carrying out his judicial functions conscientiously, entertaining his friends, and writing. He remained a lifelong bachelor. Playing the violin continued to be a favourite pastime – by this time he could afford a Stradivarius – and although he never played professionally again he performed for his friends. In a study of Brillat-Savarin published in 1892, Lucien Tendret, one of his successors as mayor of Belley and one of the founders of &quot;L&#x27;Académie des Gastronomes&quot;, related a story of Brillat-Savarin&#x27;s playing:

The dinners given by Brillat-Savarin at his house in the rue de Richelieu in Paris became famous for their excellence. Drayton comments that some of them were graced by the presence of his beautiful cousin, Juliette Récamier, who is mentioned in several places in &quot;Physiologie du goût&quot;. She looked to him for his wise advice, and Drayton surmises that he was in love with her: &quot;So at least we may assume from the references to her in his great work, and from the dedication he wrote in the copy he sent her just before he died&quot;:
 
For years Brillat-Savarin worked intermittently on his &quot;Physiologie du goût&quot;, adding, revising and polishing. Its contents were well known to his friends, and he finally yielded to their calls for him to publish it. He did so anonymously, although the author&#x27;s name was soon widely known. It was published in December 1825, two months before his death.

On 2 February 1826, at the age of seventy, Brillat-Savarin died in Paris having attended a service in the Basilica of Saint-Denis while already having a cold, which turned to pneumonia. He was buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

==Works==
===&quot;Physiologie du goût&quot;===
The full title of the work for which Brillat-Savarin is known is &quot;Physiologie du goût, ou méditations de gastronomie transcendante; ouvrage théorique, historique et à l&#x27;ordre du jour, dédié aux gastronomes parisiens, par un professeur, membre de plusieurs sociétés littéraires et savantes&quot;. The book has been in print in France continuously since it first appeared in 1825. 

Translations into foreign languages followed. The first English version, by Fayette Robinson, was published in the US in 1854 under the title &quot;The Physiology of Taste: Or, Transcendental Gastronomy&quot;. Two translations were published in Britain during the 19th century: the first, which set a pattern for giving the book a new title, was &quot;The Handbook of Dining; Or, How to Dine, Theoretically, Philosophically and Historically Considered&quot;, translated by Leonard Francis Simpson (1859). It was followed by &quot;Gastronomy as a Fine Art: or, The Science of Good Living&quot; (1879), in a translation by R. E. Anderson. These three versions contained most, but not all, of Brillat-Savarin&#x27;s text; the first complete translation into English was issued in 1884 by the London publishers Nimmo and Bain.

In &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot;, Alan Davidson praises M. F. K. Fisher&#x27;s American translation (&quot;The Physiology of Taste&quot;, 1949) as outstanding. A new English translation by Anne Drayton was published in 1970 under the title &quot;The Philosopher in the Kitchen&quot;; this version was reissued with a new title, &quot;The Pleasures of the Table&quot;, in 2011.

C. Vogt&#x27;s German translation was published in 1865 as &quot;Physiologie des Geschmacks oder physiologische Anleitung zum Studium der Tafelgenüsse&quot; (Physiology of taste or physiological guidance for the study of pleasures of the table). It was followed by versions in Russian (&quot;Fiziologija vkusa&quot;, 1867), Spanish (&quot;Fisiología del gusto&quot;, 1869), Swedish (&quot;Smakens fysiologi&quot;, 1883), and Italian (&quot;La Fisiologia del Gusto&quot;, 1914).

The book is in two main sections. They are preceded by an opening section headed &quot;Aphorisms&quot;, consisting of twenty short assertions about gastronomic topics, such as &quot;Animals feed: man eats: only the man of intellect knows how to eat&quot; and &quot;The pleasures of the table belong to all times and all ages, to every country and every day; they go hand in hand with all our other pleasures, outlast them, and remain to console us for their loss&quot;. The longest section of the book is headed &quot;Gastronomical Meditations&quot;, in which the author devotes short chapters to thirty topics, ranging from taste, appetite, thirst, digestion and rest to gourmands, obesity, exhaustion and restaurateurs. The second and smaller part of the main text consists of &quot;Miscellanea&quot;, including many anecdotes on a gastronomic theme such as the bishop who mischievously presented his eager guests with fake asparagus made of wood, and memories of the author&#x27;s exile.

===Other works===
In addition to his magnum opus, Brillat-Savarin wrote works about law and political economy: &quot;Vues et Projets d&#x27;Economie Politique&quot; (Political Economy: Plans and Prospects) (1802), &quot;Fragments d&#x27;un Ouvrage Manuscrit Intitulé Théorie Judiciare&quot; (Fragments of a work in manuscript entitled &quot;Legal Theory&quot;) (1818), and a study of the archaeology of the Ain department (1820). He also wrote a history of duelling, and what Drayton calls &quot;a number of rather racy short stories, most of which are lost&quot;, although one, &quot;Voyage à Arras&quot;, remains extant.

==Commemorations==
The soft Brillat-Savarin cheese, made in Normandy, was named in the writer&#x27;s honour by the cheese-maker Henri Androuët in the 1930s. It is an &quot;industriel&quot; cheese with an &quot;affinage&quot; of one to two weeks. The writer is also commemorated in the dish &quot;Bordure de pommes Brillat-Savarin&quot; (Apple ring Brillat-Savarin), in which a cake steeped in syrup and flavoured with rum is surrounded with stewed apples bound with rum-flavoured crème pâtissière. The cake, known as a &quot;savarin&quot;, was invented by a Parisian maitre pâtissier, Julien, as a variant of a rum baba; it was originally called a Brillat-Savarin, later shortened to savarin. 

To mark the centenary of Brillat-Savarin&#x27;s death, commemorative banquets were given in 1926 at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris and the Savoy Hotel in London. The dishes at the latter included two marking his name and birthplace: &quot;Les delices de Belley&quot; (a blend of foie gras and crayfish) and &quot;Les œufs brouilles Brillat-Savarin&quot; (scrambled eggs with truffles).

Brillat-Savarin&#x27;s name is commemorated in streets in France and Belgium: avenues Brillat-Savarin in Brussels, Belley and Saint-Denis-en-Bugey and rues Brillat-Savarin in Paris, Bourg-en-Bresse, Nîmes and Dijon.

==Reputation and influence==
Along with Grimod de La Reynière, Brillat-Savarin is credited with founding the genre of the gastronomic essay. Anthony Lane writes of him, &quot;To say that &quot;The Physiology of Taste&quot; is a cookbook is like saying that Turgenev&#x27;s &quot;Sportsman&#x27;s Sketches&quot; is a guide to hunting.&quot;

By his choice of title Brillat-Savarin seems to have been responsible for a temporary change in French writers&#x27; use of the word &quot;physiologie&quot;, although he himself used it literally, in the sense of &quot;a scientific analysis of the workings of living beings&quot;. Davidson points out that a third of the book is devoted to the chemistry and physiology of food and eating. Nonetheless:

Brillat-Savarin was an early proponent of a low-carbohydrate diet. He considered sugar and white flour to be the cause of obesity and he suggested, instead, protein-rich ingredients:

He promoted a diet that avoided starch, grains, sugar and flour. He recommended meats, root vegetables, cabbage and fruit. Brillat-Savarin was concerned to reduce the use of fattening foods, but apparently did not consider cheese one of these. He was criticised in the 20th century by Elizabeth David for his remark that &quot;dessert without cheese is like a pretty woman with only one eye&quot;, David asked: &quot;How much harm has that tyrannical maxim of Brillat-Savarin&#x27;s done to all our waistlines and our digestions?&quot;

The philosopher William Charlton writes that Brillat-Savarin &quot;upstaged the aestheticians by treating taste simply as the sense by which we discern flavours&quot;. Charlton adds that Brillat-Savarin transmutes cooking, &quot;which Plato had despised as a mere &#x27;routine&#x27;&quot;, into philosophy, shaming Descartes and Kant in his meditations on, respectively, &quot;Dreams&quot; and &quot;The End of the World&quot;. Charlton concludes that we can all profit from the Aphorisms with which Brillat-Savarin begins his book, for instance &quot;The discovery of a new dish does more for the happiness of mankind than the discovery of a star&quot;.

<text>Anne Josephine Robinson (born 26 September 1944) is a journalist and television presenter, best known as the host of BBC game show &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; from 2000 to 2012, and again in 2017 for a one-off celebrity special for &quot;Children in Need&quot;. She presented the BBC consumer affairs programme &quot;Watchdog&quot; for a total of 15 years, from 1993 to 2001 and again from 2009 to 2015. Robinson hosted the Channel 4 game show &quot;Countdown&quot; from June 2021 to July 2022, taking over from Nick Hewer. She left the programme on 13 July 2022 after one year, recording a total of 265 episodes.

==Early life==
Robinson was born in Crosby, Lancashire, on 26 September 1944 and is of British and Irish descent. Her father was a schoolteacher. Her mother, Anne Josephine (&quot;née&quot; Wilson), was an agricultural businesswoman from Northern Ireland, where she was the manager of a market stall. When she came to England, she married into her husband&#x27;s family of wholesale chicken dealers, and sold rationed rabbit following the Second World War. She inherited the family market stall in Liverpool and transformed it into one of the largest wholesale poultry dealing businesses in the north of England.

Brought up initially at the family home in Crosby, Robinson attended a private Roman Catholic convent boarding school in Hampshire, Farnborough Hill Convent, now known as Farnborough Hill. She was hired as a chicken gutter and saleswoman during the holidays in the family business, before taking office jobs at a law firm. The family spent their summers on holiday in France, often at the Carlton Hotel in Cannes.

==Career==

===Early career===
On leaving school, Robinson chose journalism over training for the theatre. After working in a news agency, she arrived in London in 1967 as the first young female trainee on the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;. Robinson&#x27;s mother&#x27;s going-away present to her daughter was an MG sports car and a fur coat. Robinson secured a permanent position as a result of scooping the details of the story of Brian Epstein&#x27;s death from being a family friend of the Liverpool solicitor handling the legalities, offering him a ride to Euston railway station when he could not find an available taxi.

Her work became more uncomfortable for her when she met and fell in love with the deputy news editor, Charles Wilson; the couple married in 1968, but he subsequently had to terminate her employment because of the marriage. Robinson joined &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. In 1977, her inability to hand in her copy due to an alcohol-related incident led to her contract being terminated by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;. She then began working for the &quot;Liverpool Echo&quot;.

===Press===
Robinson returned to Fleet Street in 1980, working as columnist and assistant editor of the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot;. She also wrote a column under the pseudonym of the &quot;Wednesday Witch&quot;, in which she developed her vitriolic style. During her career as a newspaper journalist, she developed a flair for writing tabloid headlines.

In discussing a raise with &quot;Mirror&quot; boss Robert Maxwell, she asked for a doubling of her salary and a brand-new Mercedes to be written in her contract. Following the departure of her husband, Robinson demanded that Maxwell make up the difference in their joint income, which he did. Robinson wrote obituaries to Maxwell following his death in 1991, saying: &quot;He left me reeling from his charm, his amazing panache and the sheer speed at which his brain worked. He was my inspiration and my hero&quot;. Her closeness to Maxwell was mocked by Ian Hislop in 1999 as a panellist on &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;, as well when she became the first guest presenter of the show in 2002. In &quot;Memoirs of an Unfit Mother&quot; in 2001, Robinson criticised Maxwell&#x27;s fraudulent misappropriation of the &quot;Mirror&quot; pension fund (which fully came to light after his death), in which she said: &quot;we failed to monitor what was happening on our doorstep&quot;, adding: &quot;cowards had made his behaviour possible. Bankers, accountants, lawyers, who should have known better ... said yes when they should have said no.&quot;

On 14 November 1982, Robinson attended a formal dinner attended by Queen Elizabeth II, at which she noted that Diana, Princess of Wales, arrived late. Robinson asked the &quot;Mirror&quot;″s Royal editor James Whitaker to investigate and, after conversations with various sources including Diana&#x27;s sister Lady Sarah McCorquodale, confirmed that Diana was suffering from an eating disorder, named as anorexia in a scoop article on 19 November 1982. As a result, Buckingham Palace Press Secretary Michael Shea rang then &quot;Mirror&quot; editor Mike Molloy, asking him to remove Robinson. She was subsequently removed from the editorial rota, and was advised by Molloy to &quot;do more television, blossom, that&#x27;s what you&#x27;re good at&quot;. Robinson has written weekly columns for a succession of other British newspapers, such as &quot;Today&quot;, &quot;The Sun&quot;, &quot;The Express&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;.

===Television and radio===
Robinson began appearing on BBC television in 1982, initially as an occasional panellist on &quot;Question Time&quot; and presenting her &#x27;TV Choice&#x27; on &quot;Breakfast Time&quot;. From 1986, she began sitting in on television viewers&#x27; show &quot;Points of View&quot; for regular presenter Barry Took, taking over from Took permanently in 1988 and remaining for 11 years. In 1993, she took over the presentation and writing of the consumer affairs television programme &quot;Watchdog.&quot;

Robinson joined BBC Radio 4 to present the News Stand, Today and mid-week programme by deputising for main presenters Ian Hislop, Libby Purves and Michael Aspel for three years between 1985 and 1987 some time later she joined BBC Radio 2 by covering Derek Jameson&#x27;s weekday breakfast show in May 1987 she returned to Radio 2 to present her own Saturday morning show from 1988 to 1993, she also deputised for Jimmy Young on his weekday lunchtime show for 10 years between 1988 and 1998.

In the UK, Robinson is best known for hosting the game show &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, and in the United States its NBC primetime counterpart, &quot;Weakest Link&quot;. She originally started with an icy, mysterious appearance and persona, maintaining her deadpan delivery to funny and friendly moments throughout; however, she toned down her icy, deadpan approach over the years, with her often smiling, engaging, and on occasion, even laughing, especially on the celebrity editions. Her use of insults, caustic remarks and personal questions fiercely directed at contestants became famous. Her trenchant and curt utterance &quot;You &quot;are&quot; the weakest link – goodbye!&quot; became a catchphrase soon after the show started in 2000. Asked by the Duke of Edinburgh to present some Duke of Edinburgh&#x27;s Awards, she agreed subject to his taking part in the &quot;Weakest Link&quot;. The Duke declined.

In 2001, she was accused of hatred towards the Welsh, after describing them as &quot;irritating and annoying&quot; while appearing as a guest on &quot;Room 101&quot;.

Robinson is a vocal supporter of fox hunting and, before it was banned in 2004, was a key supporter of the pro-hunt cause. &quot;The Guardian&quot; claims she has ridden with the White Horse Hunt. In an interview with &quot;Radio Times&quot; in September 2000, Robinson was asked what her first act as world leader would be, replying: &quot;I&#x27;d lock up all the hunt saboteurs because they are destructive. They are campaigning about something of which they know nothing.&quot; In February 2002, she hosted a spin-off version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; in Cirencester to raise funds for the local White Horse Hunt. The event was picketed by around 100 protesters from the League Against Cruel Sports, around 70 animal rights activists returning from another demonstration joined the picket, culminating in a near riot. The event eventually went ahead after Robinson was escorted into the venue by local police.
In 2005, she made an appearance on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, admitting she had been an unfit mother. Also in 2005, she appeared on an episode of the revived &quot;Doctor Who&quot;, entitled &quot;Bad Wolf&quot;, voicing a futuristic android version of herself named the &quot;Anne Droid&quot; on a lethal version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; in the year 200,100. When contestants lose as the &quot;weakest link&quot;, the android blasts them with a disintegrator in its mouth, which really teleports them away to a Dalek fleet. Robinson hosted the BBC&#x27;s outtakes programme &quot;Outtake TV&quot; until 2009. She hosted a satirical news-based chat show on BBC One called &quot;What&#x27;s the Problem? With Anne Robinson&quot;, and the BBC&#x27;s interactive quiz &quot;Test the Nation&quot;.

A report published in 2006, which concluded that the BBC is &quot;endemically homophobic&quot;, highlighted as one example of anti-gay bigotry in the network Robinson&#x27;s treatment of a male contestant at &quot;The Weakest Link – Celebrity Chefs&quot;, to whom she made questions such as &quot;What do you do in your restaurant – just mince around?&quot;, and &quot;Before you go, and bear in mind that this is a family show, what&#x27;s the strangest thing you&#x27;ve ever put in your mouth?&quot; The previous year she was also accused of bigotry when she told a female prison officer that she must be a lesbian.

The BBC received 16 complaints after Robinson asked wine connoisseur Olly Smith, who was competing on the celebrity version of &quot;The Weakest Link&quot;, to feel her breasts, after he described her as a &quot;full-bodied, expensive red&quot;. The programme was broadcast on Saturday 5 April 2008 on BBC One.

Robinson caused controversy on &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; when she made former &quot;Blue Peter&quot; presenter John Noakes cry after asking &quot;What was the end for Shep?&quot; Shep had been Noakes&#x27;s pet dog both on and off &quot;Blue Peter&quot;.

In 2009, Robinson returned to presenting BBC One&#x27;s long-running consumer show &quot;Watchdog&quot;. She finished presenting &quot;The Weakest Link&quot; in 2012 after twelve years as the host of 1,693 shows. On 10 September 2015, it was announced that Robinson would step down from &quot;Watchdog&quot; once again, this time in order to film a new series of &quot;Britain&#x27;s Spending Secrets&quot; for the channel. She had presented &quot;Watchdog&quot; for a total of 15 years.

In 2016, Robinson presented &quot;Anne Robinson&#x27;s Britain&quot; for BBC One. The series consisted of three episodes, each focusing on different aspects of British life. Episode one was centred on parenting, episode two on the nation&#x27;s love of pets and particularly cats and dogs, and the final episode focused on the nation&#x27;s fixation with how they look.

At the end of October 2017 on BBC Radio&#x27;s &quot;Today&quot; programme, Robinson responded to the accusations of sexual abuse made against multiple men which had followed Harvey Weinstein allegations published earlier in the month. She accused women of not complaining until now. According to Robinson, &quot;40 years ago, there were very few of us women in power and, I have to say, we had a much more robust attitude to men behaving badly&quot;. At the present time, she said, there &quot;is a sort of fragility amongst women who aren&#x27;t able to cope with the treachery of the workplace&quot;. Referring to an allegation made against the trade minister Mark Garnier about him asking a female assistant to buy sex toys: &quot;It shouldn&#x27;t be happening but, on the other hand, why have women lost confidence&quot;. She said this incident led her to be &quot;in despair&quot;. Robinson outlined her method of dealing with the problem: &quot;In my day we gave them a slap, and told them to grow up!&quot; Robinson was accused of victim blaming on social media.

In February 2021, Robinson was announced as the next host of the game show &quot;Countdown&quot;, following the resignation of Nick Hewer. Her premiere as host aired on 28 June 2021, marking her return to the show after she first appeared as a guest in the Dictionary Corner in 1987. In May 2022, it was announced that she would be leaving the show after just one year with immediate effect. Her last episode aired on 13 July 2022. In total, she recorded 265 episodes of &quot;Countdown&quot;.

==Personal life==
Robinson married the journalist Charles Wilson in 1968. In 1970 the couple had a daughter, Emma Wilson, who became a British radio disc jockey and has also hosted &quot;Scaredy Camp&quot;, a game show in the United States on the Nickelodeon network. In 1973, Robinson lost a custody battle for Emma, her only child, then aged two. Charles Wilson was granted sole custody, care and control of Emma, who subsequently lived with her father until she left home at 16 for boarding school. An admitted alcoholic, Robinson stopped drinking on 12 December 1978 after picking her daughter up from school and driving to a petrol station to buy a bottle of vodka, and then seeing her daughter cry as she drank it. Robinson joined Alcoholics Anonymous later that year. She was also previously a smoker, and quit in 1991.

Robinson married journalist John Penrose in 1980. On 30 September 2007, the couple announced that they were planning to divorce, citing irreconcilable differences. In 2001, she published her autobiography, &quot;Memoirs of an Unfit Mother&quot;, in which she talks about her early life with her domineering mother, her marriage to newspaper editor Charles Wilson, and her subsequent battle with alcoholism that led to the breakdown of her marriage and a custody battle with Wilson for their daughter, which Robinson lost.

In 2001, Robinson was diagnosed with skin cancer, and had surgery to treat it. 

In 2017, Robinson revealed that she had an abortion at age 23 when she was newly married. She described feeling the &quot;most terrible black doom&quot; that lasted for months. Robinson shared her experience on the BBC Two Documentary, &quot;Abortion on Trial&quot;.

Robinson has two grandchildren. In December 2023, it was reported that she was in a relationship with Andrew Parker Bowles, the former husband of Queen Camilla. Robinson later confirmed this in an interview for &quot;Saga Magazine&quot; in May 2024, clarifying that the couple had been dating for over a year.

<doc id="262806" wikidata="Q448757" url="?curid=262806" title="Davina McCall">
<text>Davina Lucy Pascale McCall (born 16 October 1967) is an English television presenter. She was the presenter of the reality show &quot;Big Brother&quot; during its run on Channel 4 between 2000 and 2010. She hosted Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;Streetmate&quot; (1998–2001, 2016), &quot;The Million Pound Drop&quot; (2010–2015), &quot;Five Minutes to a Fortune&quot; (2013), and &quot;The Jump&quot; (2014–2017), as well as ITV&#x27;s &quot;The Biggest Loser&quot; (2011–2012), &quot;Long Lost Family&quot; (2011–present), and &quot;This Time Next Year&quot; (2016–2019). McCall was also a regular co-presenter of the &quot;Comic Relief&quot; annual telethons from 2005 to 2015.

From 2010 to 2014, McCall presented the Sky One dance competition show &quot;Got to Dance&quot;. Since 2020, she has been a judge on the ITV musical competition show &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;, McCall was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2023 Birthday Honours for services to broadcasting. She received the Special Recognition award at the 29th National Television Awards in 2024.

==Early life and education==
Davina Lucy Pascale McCall was born on 16 October 1967 in Wimbledon, London, to a French mother, Florence (née Hennion) and an English father, Andrew McCall, a graphic designer and events organiser for Portsmouth Harbour Authority. At the age of three she went to live with her paternal grandparents in Surrey after the break-up of her parents&#x27; marriage. Her mother Florence—whom McCall has described as &quot;chaotic&quot; and later, specifically as &quot;an alcoholic&quot; and McCall saw her only on holidays.

McCall attended St Catherine&#x27;s School, Bramley near Guildford, Surrey and Godolphin and Latymer Girls School, a private school in Hammersmith, West London. At secondary level, McCall studied for nine O levels and two A levels.

==Career==
McCall&#x27;s first career was as a singer, and she had been performing in a band, Lazy Bear, while at school. By the age of 19, she had decided to pursue a professional career as a solo classical artist, and briefly started classical vocal coaching.

Dissatisfied with her lack of success in the music industry, McCall gave up singing and took a job at Models 1 on the men&#x27;s desk as a booker. Later she ran a restaurant for two years before a brief spell in Paris as a &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot;-style cabaret performer. On her return to London she worked on the nightclub scene as a hostess. Work in this period included an appearance as a dancer in the video for the 1991 Kylie Minogue single &quot;Word Is Out&quot;.

In 1994, McCall was hired as a presenter on Ray Cokes&#x27; &quot;Most Wanted&quot; on MTV Europe. She presented &quot;Hitlist UK&quot;. In 1995, she went on to host the ITV late night game show &quot;God&#x27;s Gift&quot;.

===Channel 4===

In 1998, McCall hosted the cult dating show &quot;Streetmate&quot;, in which she toured the country meeting single people and matching them up. It originally ran on Channel 4 from 1998 to 2001

McCall was chosen as the presenter of the inaugural series of &quot;Big Brother&quot;, in which ten housemates entered a sealed house for up to nine weeks and their every move was filmed and then broadcast as a daily highlights television show. McCall hosted the weekly live eviction show, where one contestant would be removed from the house, until the last housemate became the winner. McCall hosted the celebrity version &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot;, the first series of which ran for eight days in March 2001.

McCall&#x27;s performance on the final night of the sixth series in 2005 attracted press attention and some complaints for her treatment of housemate Makosi Musambasi. In December 2007, McCall presented a New Year&#x27;s edition of &quot;The Friday Night Project&quot;, entitled &quot;The Friday Night New Year Project 2007&quot;.

By the ninth series of &quot;Big Brother&quot; in 2008, McCall was earning a reported £85,000 per episode. Responding to tabloid claims before the series that she was about to quit &quot;Big Brother&quot; she said, &quot;I&#x27;m not leaving ... They would have to kill me before I&#x27;d stop doing it&quot;. The ninth series proved to be a low point, however, becoming the least watched summer series in the show&#x27;s history.

McCall became the regular presenter of the live &quot;Big Brother&quot; companion show &quot;Big Brother&#x27;s Big Mouth&quot; for the tenth and eleventh series, after it was re-formatted into an hour-long show after the weekly live eviction show, having previously occupied the slot after each daily highlights show.

With audience figures falling, Channel 4 decided that the eleventh series in summer 2010 would be the last &quot;Big Brother&quot; broadcast on their channel, although the show&#x27;s future was in the hands of the rights holder Endemol. After presenting the seventh and final series of &quot;Celebrity Big Brother&quot; in January 2010, she fronted her eleventh and final regular edition over the summer. As a finale to the series on Channel 4, McCall also presented the &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot; show, which started immediately after the main series, and featured selected past celebrity and non-celebrity housemates.

Having made the decision to leave the show after &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot;, McCall confirmed she would not be returning as host when Channel 5 announced in April 2011 that they had secured the rights to relaunch &quot;Big Brother&quot; in summer 2011. She gave her backing to Emma Willis as her replacement, stating she still believed the show had potential. &quot;Big Brother 2&quot; and &quot;Ultimate Big Brother&quot; winner Brian Dowling was ultimately chosen to take over McCall&#x27;s role as presenter of the Channel 5 version, though in 2013 Emma Willis became his successor as the new presenter.

In between the final celebrity and regular editions of &quot;Big Brother&quot; on Channel 4, McCall began presenting a new game show, &quot;The Million Pound Drop&quot;. The final episode aired on 20 March 2015, with the primetime series axed in 2016. On 14 July 2017, it was announced that the format would return as a daytime series under the name &quot;The £100K Drop&quot;.

From early 2006, McCall fronted her own prime-time chat show, &quot;Davina&quot;. Receiving scathing reviews and with viewing figures falling to below half of the six million watching &quot;The Bill&quot; on ITV at the same time, the show was cancelled in April for not reaching expectations with McCall herself saying that the programme was &quot;the worst mistake of her life&quot;.

In 2005, McCall made a cameo appearance in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; episode &quot;Bad Wolf&quot; as the voice of Davinadroid, a robot who controlled a future version of the Big Brother house. In 2023, she made a second appearance in the show, in that year&#x27;s Christmas special &quot;The Church on Ruby Road&quot;, as a fictionalised version of herself, who dies after being impaled by a Christmas tree. This is later reversed by the Doctor, who travels back in time to prevent her death.

===UKTV===

==Other ventures==

===Family===
McCall is fluent in French, as her mother is French.

McCall began smoking at 12, drinking at 13, and by her early twenties was using heroin.&lt;ref name=&quot;bbc/25wrpQv57r0xbMtKSz5CPCr&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

McCall&#x27;s previous partners included family friend Eric Clapton. He helped her when in her early 20s she developed a heroin addiction.&lt;ref name=&quot;irishnews/2319462&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

After overcoming her addiction, she gained her own television show on MTV. She gave up smoking when she was 24. Her first marriage was to Andrew Leggett in 1997. In June 2000, McCall married her second husband Matthew Robertson, presenter of &quot;Pet Rescue&quot;, at Eastnor Castle, Herefordshire. Together, they had three children: two daughters and a son. In November 2017 the couple separated.

In 2022, McCall and Michael Douglas, a hairstylist, moved in together after five years of dating.&lt;ref name=&quot;radiotimes/celebrity-gogglebox-2023&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;kentlive.news/8046092&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;lep.co.uk/4187858&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancestry===
McCall&#x27;s ancestry was examined for a 2009 episode of &quot;Who Do You Think You Are?&quot;. With the help of historians Jean-Marc Berliere and Simon Kitson, McCall learned that she is the great-granddaughter of Prefect of Police Célestin Hennion (1862–1915), and the great-great-great-granddaughter, on her father&#x27;s side, of James Thomas Bedborough (1787–1860), a stonemason, councillor, Mayor, property developer and entrepreneur, who worked on Windsor Castle and Upton Park in Slough. Bedborough was said to be an illegitimate son of George IV according to a story told by McCall&#x27;s grandmother, but this was neither proved nor disproved on the show.

Participants in the programme included Françoise Hennion (Hennion&#x27;s granddaughter and McCall&#x27;s mother&#x27;s cousin) and Pierre, Hennion&#x27;s son and McCall&#x27;s grandfather. Pierre gave McCall his father&#x27;s Royal Victorian Order medal. McCall met Alfred Dreyfus&#x27; great-granddaughter, Yael Ruiz, after learning of the part her ancestor Célestin Hennion played in the Dreyfus affair.

=== Charity work ===
In February 2014, McCall undertook a BT Sport Relief challenge called &#x27;Davina – Beyond Breaking Point&#x27;, seven days of either running, swimming or cycling across the UK to raise money for the UK charity Sport Relief. This challenge was filmed by the BBC as a one-off 60-minute documentary which aired on 20 March 2014 at 21:00 on BBC One. During the live telethon, it was announced that McCall had raised over £2.2 million for Sport Relief 2014.

===Health===

In November 2024, McCall announced that she had been diagnosed with a colloid cyst, a rare type of benign brain tumour, and would undergo neurosurgery. The surgery was performed on 15 November. McCall later stated that she was struggling with her short-term memory following the surgery but was now at home recovering, she said: “I’m on the mend, I’m resting, I’m sleeping loads, I feel really good. And very lucky.”

<text>Ceroc is an international dance club with more than 200 venues across the United Kingdom as well as national and regional competitions and weekend events throughout the year. It also has franchises in many other countries in Europe, Asia, and Australia and New Zealand.

The name &quot;Ceroc&quot; is said to derive from the French (&#x27;it is rock&#x27;), used to describe rock and roll dancing in France.

== History==
James Cronin, the son of writer Vincent Cronin and grandson of Scottish author A. J. Cronin, founded Ceroc in London, England. In January 1980 he held the first Ceroc event in Porchester Hall in London. By 1982 Ceroc had a cabaret team, which performed routines in London nightclubs and other venues. Throughout the spring and summer of 1982 the Ceroc troupe worked with choreographer Michel Ange Lau, whose classes Cronin and Sylvia Coleman had attended in 1980 at the Centre Charles Peguy, a French youth centre in Leicester Square. The first video recording of a Ceroc event appears on the description for the &#x27;Gold Bug&#x27; routine, performed at the 1982 Ceroc Ball, a charity event at the Hammersmith Palais.

In the late 1980s and early 1990s Cronin and Coleman established Ceroc Enterprises, registered &quot;Ceroc&quot; as a trademark, and started to sell Ceroc franchises around the country. In 1992 the Ceroc Teachers Association (CTA) was formed, with associated examinations: all Ceroc teachers had to pass the relevant CTA examinations before gaining licences to teach at Ceroc events. In 1994 Ceroc introduced taxi dancers to their venues – volunteers who are experienced dancers, designated to assist beginners.

In the early 2000s Cronin and Coleman sold Ceroc Enterprises to Mike Ellard. By 2004 Ceroc Enterprises were running more than 100 different venues and claimed attendance figures of 500,000. In 2006 Ceroc started expanding into the weekend event market. In October 2019 Ceroc Enterprises was sold to The Dance Holiday Company, owned by Robert Thompson, who then changed the name to Ceroc Enterprises. The sale was financed by a debenture over the assets of the company held by Ellard.

 Ceroc Enterprises had franchises operating in Ireland, France, The Netherlands, Italy, Spain, the UAE, Canada, the United States and Hong Kong. more than 30 Ceroc franchises operated in the UK, with 150 Ceroc venues there. Ceroc organisations trade in the US, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Singapore, Hong Kong, South Africa and Dubai.

Apart from the franchises listed above, Ceroc organisations operate in Australia and New Zealand. Ceroc Enterprises is a separate company from Ceroc Australia and &quot;Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company&quot; (CMJ, also based in Australia). These Australian companies are not franchisees of Ceroc Enterprises. Similarly there is no legal connection between Ceroc Enterprises and Ceroc New Zealand. In November 2013 Ceroc Australia was sold by Mark Harding to &quot;Ceroc and Modern Jive Dance Company&quot; or CMJ to bring them both back under the same umbrella following their split in 1998.

== Modern jive ==
Outside the Ceroc franchise, the dance style modern jive is also taught and danced in many independent venues, where it is commonly called LeRoc. Originally the same dance style was taught in Ceroc venues and independents but they have diverged enormously over the last 20 years. However dancers who have learned at either Ceroc venues or independents can dance together in freestyle, since apart from stylistic differences it is fundamentally the same dance. Ceroc franchise venues often attract a younger demographic than independents, largely because of their branding and because they often recruit younger teachers.

In 1990 Robert Austin, an original Ceroc franchisee who had broken away from Ceroc to form LeJive, coined the term &quot;modern jive&quot;, a generic term for the dance form used by teachers and clubs not affiliated with Ceroc Enterprises. Ceroc does not now use the term modern jive and Ceroc&#x27;s website states that it now teaches dance in general, not a specific dance form.

== Class format ==
Most Ceroc venues run regular weekly classes, usually on Monday to Thursdays. Ceroc class formats are different from other dance forms in that:
* Students are typically taught in rows from a stage rather than gathered around a teacher.
* Classes are typically larger, with often more than 100 people in some UK venues.
* Classes are highly structured: a precise routine is taught to the leads who then lead the others.
* Beginner routines are centrally controlled: each venue teaches the same beginner class on a given day.
* Partners are rotated frequently, allowing Ceroc to advertise classes as &quot;no partner required&quot;. This helps in the learning process since when you attend a Ceroc lesson you will dance with experienced and beginners alike. Lessons are organised so that partners are rotated every few minutes or every couple of moves.
* A small number of volunteer experienced dancers (called &quot;taxi dancers&quot; or &quot;taxis&quot;) are often available specifically to dance with beginners.
* Dancers pay for the evening rather than per class.

=== UK format ===
In the UK the franchise nature of Ceroc enforces a degree of uniformity across all teachers and all venues. Ceroc classes typically follow the same format, and comprise:
* A &quot;Beginners&quot; lesson, involving a routine of three moves drawn from a restricted repertoire of 12 moves, and lasting approximately 45 minutes. The Beginners routine taught on any given day is the same across all teachers and all venues. 
* A freestyle period of approximately 15 minutes, in which beginners are encouraged to practise what they have learned and experienced dancers are free to dance whatever they wish. No moves are barred during a freestyle period, except aerials, and moves are improvised on the spot to the music. Partner-swapping occurs whenever the music changes and does not require leaving the dance floor.
* An &quot;Intermediate&quot; lesson, involving a routine of three moves drawn from a much larger repertoire of Intermediate-level moves and lasting approximately 45 minutes. At least one of the Intermediate moves will be a &quot;Classic&quot; move intended for new Intermediate dancers. Many of the harder Intermediate moves are based around these &quot;Classic&quot; moves. There are 24 &quot;Classic&quot; moves. Individual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the intermediate-level lesson. Intermediate moves are more complex and may contain footwork.
* In many venues, depending on available space, a &quot;Beginners Practice Session&quot; takes place at the same time, where beginners may review the moves taught in the &quot;Beginners&quot; lesson with the help of the taxi dancers. Beginners may instead watch the Intermediate lesson, if they so choose. The usual recommendation is for Beginners to complete approximately six Beginners classes before attempting to move up to Intermediate level.
* A second freestyle period lasting for the rest of the evening, which is around an hour and a half to two hours.

The start time varies from venue to venue but is generally between 7pm and 8pm. Sunday classes often start earlier. Whatever the start time, the entire evening lasts three to four hours in most venues (with rare exceptions).

=== Australian format ===
A &quot;Beginner Progression&quot; class (also known variously as &quot;Bridging&quot;, &quot;Beginner Consolidation&quot;, &quot;Intromediate&quot; or &quot;Freestyle class&quot; ) taught at the same time as the &quot;Intermediate&quot; or &quot;Intermediate/Advanced&quot; class has also been introduced in Sydney, Brisbane, Melbourne, Perth, and Adelaide, involving a breakdown of technique and either a review of the preceding &quot;Beginner&quot; class (possibly with some extensions or variations to the moves from that class) or a new routine drawn from a mixture of intermediate and beginner level moves . This class is taught at the same time as the &quot;Intermediate&quot; class.

Individual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the Intermediate classes, however there is generally a stronger focus on technique (footwork, frame &amp; connection, balance etc.), intermediate skills (dips &amp; drops, leans, spinning etc.) and styling rather than just teaching &quot;moves&quot;.

A video clip of a Ceroc class filmed in Melbourne can be seen at Mind Body &amp; Soul

Most Australian schools teach &quot;Step&quot; footwork. See Modern Jive#Step footwork vs Rock footwork

=== New Zealand format ===

In the NZ Ceroc classes typically follow the same format, and comprise:

* A &quot;Beginners&quot; lesson, involving a routine of four moves drawn from a restricted repertoire of 23 moves, and lasting approximately 45 minutes. The Beginners routine taught will differ each class and you may encounter a couple of the same moves learned before as they draw from a small pool of 23 moves.
* A freestyle period of approximately 15 minutes, in which beginners are encouraged to practise what they have learned and experienced dancers are free to dance whatever they wish. No moves are barred during a freestyle period and moves are improvised on the spot to the music. Partner-swapping is encouraged whenever the music changes and does not require leaving the dance floor.
* An &quot;Intermediate&quot; lesson, involving a routine of three moves drawn from a much larger repertoire of Intermediate-level moves and lasting approximately 45 minutes. At least one of the Intermediate moves will be a &quot;Classic&quot; move intended for new Intermediate dancers. Many of the harder Intermediate moves are based around these &quot;Classic Beginner&quot; moves. There are 23 Beginner moves. Individual teachers are less constrained as to the content of the intermediate-level lesson. Intermediate moves are more complex and may contain footwork.
* Very rarely in some venues, depending on available space and teachers, a &quot;Beginners+ Session&quot; takes place at the same time, where beginners may review the moves taught in the &quot;Beginners&quot; lesson with the help of experienced dancers/teachers in training. Beginners may instead watch the Intermediate lesson, if they so choose. The usual recommendation is for Beginners to complete approximately six Beginners classes before attempting to move up to Intermediate level.
* A second freestyle period lasting for the rest of the evening, which is around an hour and a half to two hours.

The start time varies from venue to venue but is generally between 7pm and 8pm. Whatever the start time, the entire evening lasts three to four hours in most venues (with rare exceptions). According to Ceroc Dance New Zealand, the beginner moves are:
* Back Pass
* Basket
* Break Through
* Catapult
* Ceroc New Yorker
* Ceroc Spin
* Check Step
* Fan
* Figure Of 8
* First Move
* Hatch Back
* Loop Through
* Man&#x27;s Comb
* Manhattan
* Push Spin
* Return
* Shoulder Block
* Slidebreak
* Squeeze Box
* Step Across
* Travelling Return
* Wurlitzer
* Yoyo

==Events==

===Freestyles and tea dances===
As well as regular class nights, most Ceroc franchises put on special events, termed &quot;Freestyles&quot;, on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays. Sunday freestyles are termed &quot;tea dances&quot; and are often held in the afternoon rather than evening. Some freestyle events begin with an icebreaker class, usually at an intermediate level as beginners are unlikely to attend freestyles.

A typical Saturday night freestyle begins at either 8 or 9pm and runs until between midnight and 2am. Freestyles are usually held at larger venues such as town halls, and often have two rooms: the Main Room, usually the largest room playing up tempo music between 100 and 150 BPM; and often a &#x27;Blues Room&#x27; or &#x27;Chillout&#x27; room, playing slower music between 80 and 110 BPM, allowing for slower dancing focusing more on connection, interpretation and musicality.

===Workshops===
Many Ceroc teachers also occasionally run daytime dance workshops at weekends, which in the UK are known as Cerocshops. A workshop lasts for four hours, and covers more moves than are covered in a single regular evening class. The standard Ceroc workshops are graded (&quot;Beginners 1&quot;, &quot;Beginners 2&quot;, &quot;Beginners Plus&quot;, &quot;Intermediate 1&quot;, &quot;Intermediate 2&quot;, and &quot;Intermediate Plus&quot;). Specialised workshops may also be available which cover more advanced techniques and styles such as &quot;Dips &amp; Drops&quot;, &quot;Baby Aerials&quot;, &quot;Double Trouble&quot; (one lead, two follows), &quot;Switch it Up&quot; (swapping partners), &quot;Ceroc to Blues&quot;, &quot;Footwork&quot;, &quot;Frame&quot;, &quot;Spins &amp; Turn technique&quot;, &quot;Musicality&quot;, &quot;Connection &amp; Posture&quot;. The frequency and content of these workshops depends on the resident teacher or guest teachers who may teach various workshops over the course of a weekend often with a freestyle party in the evening such as Ceroc Aberdeen&#x27;s Beach Ballroom Weekend or Ceroc Conexion&#x27;s Extreme Mini Weekender.

===Championships===
Ceroc Enterprises holds an annual UK Ceroc dance championship. This is held in London (currently at the Watford Colosseum) at the beginning of May with a mix of freestyle dancing and competitions. Competitions range from beginner oriented categories, such as the Lucky Dip (a Jack and Jill competition) and &quot;Ceroc X&quot;, where competitors are restricted to a set list of eight basic moves, which they have to dance to different musical styles and are judged on performance and musicality.

In recent years, the Intermediate and Advanced Freestyle Categories have been merged into an All Stars category divided into three different age brackets. Above this there is still the Open category, and Top Cats, another Jack and Jill where individual competitors are judged rather than couples. Other categories include Aerials, Showcase, and Team Cabaret competitions.

There are other championships held on a regional or franchise basis, for example the Midlands, Ceroc Scotland and Welsh champs, and the Australasian.

Ceroc also hosts the European Neo-Blues Championships. This is held at the Breeze weekend venue at the Pontins at Brean Sands in October, and includes an invitational Masters Jack and Jill, Blues Open, Blues DWAS, and Showcase categories.

=== Weekend events ===
Ceroc hosts a number of &quot;Ceroc Escape&quot; dance weekend events throughout the year, attracting hundreds of dancers from around the UK and Europe. Most of these take place at the Pontins holiday resorts at Camber Sands, at Southport and in Somerset. Other more luxurious events are held at hotels, such as LUX and Swish. Freestyle dancing begins on the Friday night and carries on until the Monday morning. During the day a range of classes and workshops is available with teachers from around the country. Most events have a Saturday-night cabaret, featuring teachers, competition and showcase performances.

In 2005 Ceroc Enterprises completed the purchase of Rebel Roc, along with its annual dance weekend event at Pontins, Camber Sands. The first such event under the ownership of Ceroc Enterprises was Ceroc &#x27;Storm&#x27; at Camber Sands in March 2006. Ceroc Enterprises has expanded its weekend offerings and took over weekend venues from JiveTime (Camber Sands) at the end of 2007 and Jive Addiction (Southport) in August 2008.

<text>Jon Hassell (March 22, 1937 – June 26, 2021) was an American trumpet player and composer. He was best known for developing the concept of &quot;Fourth World&quot; music, which describes a &quot;unified primitive/futurist sound&quot; combining elements of various world ethnic traditions with modern electronic techniques. The concept was first articulated on &quot;Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics&quot;, his 1980 collaboration with Brian Eno.

Born in Tennessee, Hassell studied contemporary classical music in New York and later in Germany under composer Karlheinz Stockhausen. He subsequently worked with minimalist composers Terry Riley (on a 1968 recording of &quot;In C&quot;) and La Monte Young (as part of his Theatre of Eternal Music group), and studied under Hindustani singer Pandit Pran Nath. His association with Brian Eno in the early 1980s would introduce Hassell to a larger audience. He subsequently worked with musical artists such as Talking Heads, David Sylvian, Farafina, Peter Gabriel, Tears for Fears, Ani DiFranco, Techno Animal, Ry Cooder, Moritz von Oswald, and Carl Craig.

==Life and career==
Born in Memphis, Tennessee, United States, Hassell received his master&#x27;s degree from the Eastman School of Music in Rochester, New York. During this time he became involved in European serial music, especially the work of Karlheinz Stockhausen, and so after finishing his studies at Eastman, he enrolled in the Cologne Course for New Music (founded and directed by Stockhausen) for two years, where he met Irmin Schmidt and Holger Czukay, who would later go on to form Can. Hassell returned to the U.S. in 1967, where he met Terry Riley in Buffalo, New York, and performed on the first recording of Riley&#x27;s seminal work &quot;In C&quot; in 1968. He pursued his Ph.D. in musicology in Buffalo and performed in La Monte Young&#x27;s Theatre of Eternal Music in New York City, contributing to the 1974 LP &quot;Dream House 78&#x27; 17&quot;&quot;.

On his return to Buffalo in the early 1970s, Hassell was introduced to the music of Indian Pandit Pran Nath, a specialist in the Kiranic style of singing. Hassell, Young, Marian Zazeela, and Riley went together to India to study with Nath. His work with Nath awoke his appetite for traditional musics of the world, and on the album &quot;Vernal Equinox&quot;, he used his trumpet (treated with various electronic effects) to imitate the vocal techniques to which Nath had exposed him. He stated:

:&quot;From 1973 up until then I was totally immersed in playing raga on the trumpet. I wanted the physical dexterity to be able to come into a room and be able to do something that nobody else in the world could do. My aim was to make a music that was vertically integrated in such a way that at any cross-sectional moment you were not able to pick a single element out as being from a particular country or genre of music.&quot;

In 1980, he collaborated with Brian Eno on the album &quot;Fourth World, Vol. 1: Possible Musics&quot; and appeared on the Eno-produced Talking Heads album &quot;Remain in Light&quot;. The same year Hassell also performed solo at the Mudd Club. Plans had been made with Eno and David Byrne for the three of them to team up for what became &quot;My Life in the Bush of Ghosts,&quot; but the plan fell through when Hassell didn&#x27;t agree with the direction the tracks were taking. His 1981 release, &quot;Dream Theory in Malaya&quot;, led to a performance at the first World of Music, Arts and Dance (WOMAD) Festival, organized by Peter Gabriel. He performed and co-wrote tracks on David Sylvian&#x27;s first solo album &quot;Brilliant Trees&quot;, and its instrumental EP follow-up &quot;Words with the Shaman&quot;. In the late 1980s, Hassell contributed to Gabriel&#x27;s &quot;&quot;, the soundtrack album for Martin Scorsese&#x27;s film, &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;. Hassell and Pete Scaturro composed the electronic theme music for the television show &quot;The Practice&quot;.
In 1989, Hassell contributed to the Tears for Fears album &quot;The Seeds of Love&quot;.

Hassell died from natural causes on June 26, 2021, at the age of 84. He had had health issues over the course of the previous year.

==Style==

Hassell coined the term &quot;Fourth World&quot; to describe his work on &quot;a unified primitive/futuristic sound combining features of world ethnic styles with advanced electronic techniques.&quot; He used extensive electronic processing of his trumpet playing. In addition to nonwestern traditional musics, critics have noted the influence of Miles Davis on Hassell&#x27;s style, particularly Davis&#x27; use of electronics, modal harmony, minimal vibrato and understated lyricism. Both on record and during live performances, Hassell made use of western instruments—keyboards, bass, electric guitar, and percussion—to create modal, hypnotic grooves, over which he often played microtonally-inflected trumpet phrases in the style of Nath&#x27;s Kiranic vocals. His use of circular breathing on the instrument enabled him to create long, seamless, and mesmerizing melodic lines.

<doc id="262816" wikidata="Q676884" url="?curid=262816" title="Before and After Science">
<text>Before and After Science is the fifth solo studio album by English musician Brian Eno, originally released by Polydor Records in December 1977 in the United Kingdom and by Island U.S. soon after. Produced by Eno and Rhett Davies, it is the first of Eno&#x27;s popular music works to be published under his full name (unlike all recordings that preceded the record and &quot;Discreet Music&quot;, where he was mononymously credited as &quot;Eno&quot;).

Musicians from the United Kingdom and Germany had notably collaborated on the album, including Robert Wyatt, Fred Frith, Phil Manzanera, Paul Rudolph, Andy Fraser, Dave Mattacks, Jaki Liebezeit, Dieter Moebius, and Hans-Joachim Roedelius. Over one hundred tracks were written but only ten made the album&#x27;s final cut. The musical styles range from energetic and jagged to languid and pastoral.

The album marks Eno&#x27;s last foray into rock music as a solo artist in the 1970s, nearly all of his following work showcasing avant-garde and ambient music, which was hinted at predominantly on the second side of &quot;Before and After Science&quot;. It was Eno&#x27;s second to chart in the United States. The song &quot;King&#x27;s Lead Hat&quot; (the title of which is an anagram for Talking Heads, for whom Eno would later produce three albums) was remixed and released as a single, although it did not chart in the United Kingdom. Critical response to the album has remained positive, with several critics calling it one of Eno&#x27;s best works.

Unlike Eno&#x27;s previous albums, which were recorded in a very short time, &quot;Before and After Science&quot; was two years in the making. During this two-year period, Eno was busy working on his solo ambient music albums &quot;Music for Films&quot; and &quot;Discreet Music&quot; and collaborating with David Bowie on the latter&#x27;s albums &quot;Low&quot; and &quot;&quot;Heroes&quot;&quot;. Due to the very positive critical reception accorded his previous rock music-oriented album, &quot;Another Green World&quot;, Eno was afraid of repeating himself but still wanted to release a high-quality product.

As on his previous rock-based recordings, Eno worked with a plethora of guest musicians. Several artists from German and British groups of the era contributed to the album, collaborating with Eno for the first time. Guitarist Fred Frith caught Eno&#x27;s attention with &quot;the timbral possibilities that [Frith had] been discovering&quot; on his album &quot;Guitar Solos&quot;. Jaki Liebezeit of the German krautrock group Can played drums on &quot;Backwater&quot;, and German ambient music group Cluster contributed to the songwriting and instrumentation of the track &quot;By This River&quot;. Eno had previously worked with Cluster on their album &quot;Cluster &amp; Eno&quot;, released in 1977. Other musicians included Dave Mattacks, who played drums on &quot;Kurt&#x27;s Rejoinder&quot; and &quot;Here He Comes&quot;, and Andy Fraser (normally a bass guitarist in British blues rock band Free) who played the drums on &quot;King&#x27;s Lead Hat&quot;.

Several musicians who had worked with Eno on previous albums returned. Percy Jones of Brand X and Phil Collins of Genesis played bass and drums respectively. Other returning contributors included Robert Fripp, Paul Rudolph, Bill MacCormick and Phil Manzanera. &quot;Shirley Williams&quot; is credited on the album sleeve for &quot;time&quot; and &quot;brush timbales&quot; on &quot;Through Hollow Lands&quot; and &quot;Kurt&#x27;s Rejoinder&quot;; Williams was a pseudonym for Robert Wyatt. Working extensively with the musicians and his instructional cards—the Oblique Strategies—during the two years working on the album, Eno wrote over one hundred songs.

== Music and lyrics ==
Jim DeRogatis, author of &quot;Turn on Your Mind: Four Decades of Great Psychedelic Rock&quot;, described the overall sound of &quot;Before and After Science&quot; as &quot;the coldest and most clinical of Eno&#x27;s pop efforts&quot;. David Ross Smith of online music database AllMusic wrote that &quot;Despite the album&#x27;s pop format, the sound is unique and strays far from the mainstream&quot;. According to David Bowie&#x27;s biographer Thomas Jerome Seabrook, the album is &quot;split between up-tempo art-rock on side one and more pastoral material on side two&quot;, while Piotr Orlov of &quot;LA Weekly&quot; categorized it as an art pop record. The album&#x27;s opening tracks &quot;No One Receiving&quot; and &quot;Backwater&quot; start the album as upbeat and bouncy songs. &quot;King&#x27;s Lead Hat&quot; is an anagram of Talking Heads, a new wave group Eno had met after a concert in England when they were touring with Ramones. Eno would later produce Talking Heads&#x27; second, third and fourth albums, including &quot;Remain in Light&quot;. The last five songs of the album have been described as having &quot;an occasional pastoral quality&quot; and being &quot;pensive and atmospheric&quot;.

Eno referred to the music of &quot;Before and After Science&quot; as &quot;ocean music&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Another Green World&quot;&#x27;, which he described as &quot;sky music&quot;. References to water in the lyrics appear in songs such as &quot;Backwater&quot;, &quot;Julie With...&quot; and &quot;By this River&quot;. Author Simon Reynolds noted themes of &quot;boredom&quot; and &quot;bliss&quot; through the album, citing &quot;Here He Comes&quot;, about &quot;a boy trying to vanish by floating through the sky through a different time&quot; and &quot;Spider and I&quot;, about a boy watching the sky and dreaming about being carried away with a ship, as examples. Eno&#x27;s songwriting style was described as &quot;a sound-over-sense approach&quot;. Influenced by poet Kurt Schwitters, Eno consciously did not make songwriting or lyrics the main focus in the music. Tom Carson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; noted this style, stating that the lyrics are &quot;only complementary variables&quot; to the music on the album. Lester Bangs commented on Eno&#x27;s lyrical style on &quot;Julie with...&quot; stating that the lyrics&#x27; themes &quot;could be a murderer&#x27;s ruminations, or simply a lovers&#x27; retreat... or Julie could be three years old&quot;. Schwitters&#x27; influence is also shown on the song &quot;Kurt&#x27;s Rejoinder&quot;, on which samples of Schwitters&#x27; poem &quot;Ursonate&quot; can be heard.

== Release ==

&quot;Before and After Science&quot; was released in December 1977 on Polydor in the United Kingdom and on Island in the United States. The first pressings of the album included four offset prints by Peter Schmidt. The back cover of the LP states &quot;Fourteen Pictures&quot; under the album title, referencing Eno&#x27;s ten songs and Peter Schmidt&#x27;s 4 prints. These prints included &quot;The Road to the Crater&quot;, &quot;Look at September, look at October&quot;, &quot;The Other House&quot; and &quot;Four Years&quot;. The album did not chart in the United Kingdom, but was Eno&#x27;s first album since &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; to chart in the United States, where it peaked at 171 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Top LPs &amp; Tapes chart. &quot;King&#x27;s Lead Hat&quot; was remixed and released as a single in January 1978, featuring the B-side &quot;R.A.F.&quot;, which is credited to &quot;Eno &amp; Snatch&quot; (in the UK, not the US). This single failed to chart and has never been reissued in any form.

The album was re-issued on compact disc through E.G. Records in January 1987. In 2004, Virgin Records began reissuing Eno&#x27;s albums in batches of four to five. The remastered digipak release of &quot;Before and After Science&quot; was released on 31 May 2004 in the United Kingdom and on 1 June 2004 in North America.

== Critical reception ==
The album was critically acclaimed upon release. Writing for &quot;Creem&quot;, Joe Fernbacher called the &quot;Before and After Science&quot; &quot;the perfect Eno album&quot;, and Mitchell Schneider in &quot;Crawdaddy&quot; stated he could not &quot;remember the last time a record took such a hold of [him]—and gave [him] such an extreme case of vertigo, too&quot;. In &quot;DownBeat&quot;, Russell Shaw wrote that the album was &quot;another typically awesome, stunning and numbing Brian Eno album—the record Pink Floyd &quot;could&quot; make if they set their collective mind to it&quot;. Tom Carson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; considered the album &quot;less immediately ingratiating than either &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain&quot; or &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot;. Still, the execution here is close to flawless, and despite Eno&#x27;s eclecticism, the disparate styles he employs connect brilliantly.&quot; Critic Robert Christgau gave the album an A− rating, stating that he &quot;didn&#x27;t like the murkiness of the quiet, largely instrumental reflections that take over side two&quot;, but did not find that this &quot;diminishes side one&#x27;s oblique, charming tour of the popular rhythms of the day&quot;. In 1979, &quot;Before and After Science&quot; was voted 12th best album of the year on &quot;The Village Voice&quot;&#x27;s Pazz &amp; Jop critics&#x27; poll for 1978.

Among later reviews of &quot;Before and After Science&quot;, the editors of AllMusic awarded the album the highest rating of five stars, with David Ross Smith stating that it ranks alongside &quot;Here Come the Warm Jets&quot; and &quot;Another Green World&quot; &quot;as the most essential Eno material&quot;. The music webzine &quot;Tiny Mix Tapes&quot; awarded the album their highest rating, stating that it &quot;is not only one of the best albums in Eno&#x27;s catalog, but of the 1970s as a whole&quot;. Douglas Wolk of the webzine &quot;Pitchfork&quot; gave &quot;Before and After Science&quot; a perfect rating, calling the album &quot;the most conceptually elegant of Eno’s &#x27;70s song-albums&quot;. &quot;Pitchfork&quot; placed &quot;Before and After Science&quot; at number 100 on their list of &quot;Top 100 Albums of the 1970s&quot;, referring to it as a &quot;lovely, charming album&quot; and going on to state that, while &quot;not formally groundbreaking, it&#x27;s frequently overlooked when discussing great albums from an era that&#x27;s romanticized as placing premiums on progression and innovation—and particularly in the context of Eno&#x27;s career, which is so full of both&quot;.

<text>LeRoc is a form of Modern Jive, a dance style that evolved in the 1980s out of dances including Swing, Lindy Hop and Rock and Roll. The main innovation was to simplify the footwork, making LeRoc very adaptable to different types of music in a 4-beat, fast or slow.

According to the particular teacher, it may incorporate elements of other dance styles including Salsa and Tango.

Both LeRoc and, later, Ceroc evolved in London during the Jive revival in the early 1980s, with dancers often being members of both clubs. LeRoc dances at the Notre Dame Hall, off Leicester Square, and Ceroc dances at the Porchester Hall in Bayswater rarely conflicted so it was easy to attend both, and rivalry between the clubs spurred the development of new dance moves. The split had occurred when James Cronin decided to trademark the word &quot;Ceroc&quot;, and run the Ceroc club as a franchised business. The members of the LeRoc club, led by Michel Ange Lau, decided not to run it for potential income, preferring to concentrate on perfecting the dance. This means that, today, many unrelated Modern Jive organisations are free to use &quot;LeRoc&quot; in their names as it remains a generic term. 

&quot;The LeRoc Modern Jive Federation&quot; is a non-profit federation of independent dance teachers that was set up in 1991, but it is not mandatory to join. It offers advantages (such as membership of the United Kingdom Alliance of Professional Teachers of Dancing and Kindred Arts (UKA) to its members.

It is said that the dance style came from France, where Swing / Rock and Roll dancing had not been so suppressed by the onslaught of Disco. LeRoc was named by Michel Ange Lau to describe a &quot;distinctive&quot; style of rock dancing, or &quot;&quot;this&quot; Rock&quot;, while Ceroc, which appears a closer translation from French, is actually derived from &quot;C&#x27;est le roc&quot;.

Despite the reported French roots of LeRoc, there is currently very little Modern Jive danced in France.

<doc id="262822" wikidata="Q1727081" url="?curid=262822" title="Neil Blaney">
<text>Neil Terence Columba Blaney (1 October 1922 – 8 November 1995) was an Irish politician. He was first elected to Dáil Éireann in 1948 as a Fianna Fáil Teachta Dála (TD) representing Donegal East. A high-profile member of the party, Blaney served as a government minister several times; he was Minister for Posts and Telegraphs (1957), Minister for Local Government (1957–1966) and Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries (1966–1970). In 1970 Blaney&#x27;s career was radically altered when, alongside Charles Haughey, he was involved in the Arms Crisis and stood accused of clandestinely arranging to provide weapons to the newly-emergent Provisional Irish Republican Army. Although later acquitted of wrongdoing in an Irish court, Blaney&#x27;s involvement in the crisis saw him stripped of his ministries and eventually forced his expulsion from Fianna Fáil. A dogged political campaigner, Blaney managed to retain his seat in Donegal and remained a TD for another two decades, running under the banner of &quot;Independent Fianna Fáil&quot;. In addition to being a TD, Blaney also entered into European politics, becoming a member of the European Parliament in 1979. Blaney was a holder of both offices when he died in 1995. Entering the Dáil as its youngest member, he left it as the oldest member.

==Early life==
Neil Blaney was born in 1922 in the village of Rossnakill in rural Fanad Peninsula in the north of County Donegal, in Ireland. The second eldest of a family of eleven, Blaney&#x27;s father Neal had been a commander of the Irish Republican Army (IRA) in Donegal during the War of Independence and the Civil War. His father served as both a TD and as a Senator from 1927 through 1948; at which point Neil Blaney succeed him in that role. It was from his father that Blaney got his strong republican views and his first introduction to politics. He was educated locally at Tamney on the Fanad Peninsula and later attended St Eunan&#x27;s College in Letterkenny as a boarder. Blaney later worked as an organiser with the Irish National Vintners and Grocers Association.

==Early political career==
Blaney was first elected to Dáil Éireann for the Donegal East constituency in a by-election in December 1948, following the death of his father from cancer. He also became a member of Donegal County Council. Upon his election Blaney was the youngest member of the Dáil. He remained on the backbenches for a number of years before he was one of a group of young party members handpicked by Seán Lemass to begin a re-organisation drive for the party following the defeat at the 1954 general election. Within the party Blaney gained fame by running the party&#x27;s by-election campaigns throughout the 1950s and 1960s. He introduced the concept of cavalcades after his election victories in his constituency together with roadside bonfires. At the time this was an alien political concept in Ireland. Blaney also adopted wearing sunglasses, chewing gum and wearing bright ties and colourful suits. His dedicated bands of supporters earned the sobriquet &#x27;the Donegal Mafia&#x27;, and succeeded in getting Des O&#x27;Malley and Gerry Collins elected to the Dáil.

==Ministerial career==
Following Fianna Fáil&#x27;s victory at the 1957 general election Éamon de Valera, as Taoiseach, brought new blood into the Cabinet in the shape of Blaney, Jack Lynch, Kevin Boland and Mícheál Ó Móráin. Blaney was appointed Minister for Posts and Telegraphs, becoming the first government minister from Donegal, however, he moved to the position of Minister for Local Government at the end of 1957 following the death of Seán Moylan. Blaney proved to be an innovative minister and his first task as minister was to prepare the groundwork for the referendum to scrap the proportional representation electoral system and replace it with the first-past-the-post voting system. The referendum failed to be passed, however, Blaney was retained in the post when Lemass succeeded de Valera as Taoiseach in 1959. In 1963 he introduced the Planning Act to rationalise planning throughout the local authorities in the state. This act also created the agency, An Forás Forbatha, to bring planning experts together and also created The IPA as a development agency for the Public Sector. In time An Bord Pleanala would be created as an independent oversight authority. His department underwent a very large programme to provide piped water to rural homes. In 1965 Blaney introduced the Road Traffic Act which required that motorists take a driving test in roadworthy cars. During his tenure it became possible to pay rates (property taxes) by instalment and he also introduced legislation which entitled non-nationals to vote in local elections. In his time in this Department he is also synonymous with the construction of the towers in Ballymun an attempt at state-planning. Blaney always claimed that the project would have worked had it remained out of local-authority regulatory ownership or management.

In 1966 Lemass resigned as Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil leader. The subsequent leadership election saw George Colley and Charles Haughey emerge as the two front-runners. Blaney was unimpressed with the choice and, with the support of the like-minded Kevin Boland, he threw his hat in the ring, declaring himself to be the &quot;Radical Republican&quot; candidate. However outside the Northwest and apart from Boland, Blaney failed to attract much support. After some pressure from Lemass the Cork politician, Jack Lynch, entered the race and was deemed to be an unbeatable candidate. Haughey and Boland withdrew in support of Lynch, however, Colley forced a contest. He was defeated heavily with Lynch becoming party leader and Taoiseach. In the subsequent cabinet reshuffle Blaney was appointed Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries.

==Arms Crisis==

In 1969, when conflict broke out in Northern Ireland, Blaney was one of the first to express strong Irish republican views in support of Northern nationalists, views which contradicted the policy of the Irish Government. Blaney was a native of Ulster, and was affected by the outbreak of violence in parts of his home province. He was concerned about the plight of the Nationalist majority in West Tyrone and in Derry, areas that bordered his constituency in West Ulster. From around late 1968 onwards, Blaney formed and presided over an unofficial Nationalist group in Leinster House popularly known as &#x27;the Letterkenny Table&#x27;, so named because this group of politicians used to meet at a certain table in either the Dáil bar or the Dáil restaurant. The group was dominated by Blaney up until his death. He had also been one of a four-member Cabinet sub-committee set up to decide on government policy to Northern Ireland together with Charles Haughey, Pádraig Faulkner, and Joseph Brennan. A fund of £100,000 was set up to give to the nationalist people in the form of aid. However, those involved have denied that the government supported the importation of arms.

In December 1969 Blaney declared in Donegal that &quot;the Fianna Fáil Party has never taken a decision to rule out the use of force if the circumstances in the Six Counties so demanded&quot;.

There was general surprise when, in an incident known as the Arms Crisis, Blaney, along with Haughey, was sacked from Taoiseach Jack Lynch&#x27;s cabinet amid allegations of the use of the funds to import arms for use by the new emergent Provisional IRA. Opposition leader Liam Cosgrave was informed by the Garda that a plot to import arms existed and included government members. Cosgrave told Lynch he knew of the plot and would announce it in the Dáil next day if he did not act. Lynch asked for Haughey and Blaney&#x27;s resignations. Both men refused, saying they did nothing illegal. Lynch then advised President de Valera to sack Haughey and Blaney from the government. Kevin Boland resigned in sympathy, while Mícheál Ó Móráin was dismissed one day earlier in a preemptive strike to ensure that he was not the Minister for Justice when the crisis broke. Lynch chose government chief whip Des O&#x27;Malley for the role. Haughey and Blaney were subsequently tried in court along with an army Officer, Captain James Kelly, and Albert Luykx, a Belgian businessman who allegedly used his contacts to buy the arms. At trial, all the accused were acquitted, but many of their critics refused to recognise the verdict of the courts. Although Blaney was cleared of wrongdoing, his ministerial career was brought to an end.

Lynch subsequently moved against Blaney so as to isolate him in the party. He was defeated by George Colley in a vote for the position of Joint Honorary Treasurer at the 1971 Ardfheis, while his constituency colleague, Liam Cunningham, had been appointed a Parliamentary Secretary in the cabinet reshuffle. In the Dáil, Blaney abstained on a motion of no confidence on the worthiness of cabinet minister Jim Gibbons for office, sponsored by the opposition. Paudge Brennan and Des Foley acted similarly and, while the government survived, they were all expelled from the parliamentary party. When Blaney and his supporters tried to organise the party&#x27;s national collection independently, Lynch acted, and in 1972 Blaney was expelled from the Fianna Fáil party for &#x27;conduct unbecoming&#x27;.

==Independent Fianna Fáil==
Following his expulsion from Fianna Fáil, Kevin Boland tried to persuade Blaney to join the Aontacht Éireann party he was creating but Blaney declined. Instead, he contested all subsequent elections for Independent Fianna Fáil – The Republican Party, an organisation that he built up, chiefly in the County Donegal constituencies from disaffected members of the Fianna Fáil party who remained loyal to him along with a large number of Republicans. Throughout the 1970s there were frequent calls for his re-admittance to Fianna Fáil but the most vocal opponents of this move were Fianna Fáil delegates from County Donegal.

At the 1979 European elections Blaney topped the poll in the Connacht–Ulster constituency to the annoyance of Fianna Fáil. He sat in the Technical Group of Independents and served as chair of the group along with the Italian Radical Marco Pannella and Danish left-wing Eurosceptic Jens-Peter Bonde. He narrowly lost the seat at the 1984 election to Ray MacSharry but was returned to serve as an MEP in 1989 election where he sat with the regionalist Rainbow Group. He also canvassed for IRA hunger striker Bobby Sands in the Fermanagh and South Tyrone by-election, in which Sands was elected to Westminster.

Blaney contracted cancer from which he died at the age of 73 on 8 November 1995. He held his Dáil seat until his death and was the reigning Father of the Dáil at that time. His death occurred at the Mater Private Hospital in Dublin.

In the resulting by-election on 2 April 1996, the Fianna Fáil candidate reclaimed the seat. However, Blaney&#x27;s brother, Harry Blaney, was elected as an Independent Fianna Fáil TD at the 1997 general election. He was replaced by his son, Niall Blaney, who was elected at the 2002 general election. But in July 2006 Niall rejoined Fianna Fáil. This was opposed by other members of the Blaney family, including all seven children of Neil Blaney and his widow Eva, who issued a press release prior to Niall Blaney&#x27;s decision castigating the Fianna Fáil party and disassociating themselves from any so called &#x27;truce&#x27; with them.

==Legacy==
Irish historian Patrick Maume summarised Blaney&#x27;s career by noting 
A road in Letterkenny is named the Neil T. Blaney Road in his honour. He is buried in Sutton.

<text>Umberto Boccioni (; ; 19 October 1882 – 17 August 1916) was an influential Italian painter and sculptor. He helped shape the revolutionary aesthetic of the Futurism movement as one of its principal figures. Despite his short life, his approach to the dynamism of form and the deconstruction of solid mass guided artists long after his death. His works are held by many public art museums, and in 1988 the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City organized a major retrospective of 100 pieces.

==Biography==
Umberto Boccioni was born on 19 October 1882 in Reggio Calabria. His father was a minor government employee, originally from the Romagna region in the north, and his job included frequent reassignments throughout Italy. The family soon relocated further north, and Umberto and his older sister Amelia grew up in Forlì (Emilia-Romagna), Genoa and finally Padua. At the age of 15, in 1897, Umberto and his father moved to Catania, Sicily, where he would finish school. Some time after 1898, he moved to Rome and studied art at the Scuola Libera del Nudo of the Accademia di Belle Arti di Roma. He also studied under the Liberty style poster artist Giovanni Mataloni.

The little known about his years in Rome is found in the autobiography of his friend Gino Severini (1883–1966), who recalled their meeting in 1901 and mutual interest in Nietzsche, rebellion, life experiences and socialism. Boccioni&#x27;s writings at this time already express the combination of outrage and irony that would become a lifelong characteristic. His critical and rebellious nature, and overall intellectual ability, would contribute substantially to the development of the Futurism movement. After building a foundation of skills, having studied the classics through Impressionism, both he and Severini became students of Giacomo Balla (1871–1958), a painter focusing on the modern Divisionist technique, painting with divided rather than mixed color and breaking the painted surface into a field of stippled dots and stripes. Severini wrote &quot;It was a great stroke of luck for us to meet such a man, whose direction was decisive of all our careers.&quot;

In 1906, he briefly moved to Paris, where he studied Impressionist and Post-Impressionist styles, before visiting Russia for three months, getting a first-hand view of the civil unrest and governmental crackdowns. Returning to Italy in 1907, he briefly took drawing classes at the Accademia di Belle Arti of Venice. He had first visited the Famiglia Artistica, a society for artists in Milan, in 1901.

As he travelled from one city to the other, in parallel with his most ground-breaking artistic endeavours, he worked as a commercial illustrator. Between 1904 and 1909 he provided lithographs and gouache paintings to internationally renowned publishing houses, such as Berlin-based Stiefbold &amp; Co. Boccioni&#x27;s production in this field shows his awareness of contemporary European illustration, such as the work of Cecil Aldin, Harry Eliott, Henri Cassiers and Albert Beerts, and attests to his information of contemporary trends in the visual arts more in general.

Boccioni moved to Milan in 1907. There, early in 1908, he met the Divisionist painter Gaetano Previati. In early 1910 he met Filippo Tommaso Marinetti, who had already published his &quot;Manifesto del Futurismo&quot; (&quot;Manifesto of Futurism&quot;) in the previous year. On 11 February 1910 Boccioni, with Balla, Carlo Carrà, Luigi Russolo and Severini, signed the &quot;Manifesto dei pittori futuristi&quot; (&quot;Manifesto of Futurist painters&quot;), and on 8 March he read the manifesto at the Politeama Chiarella theatre in Turin.

Boccioni became the main theorist of the artistic movement. &quot;Only when Boccioni, Balla, Severini and a few other Futurists traveled to Paris toward the end of 1911 and saw what Braque and Picasso had been doing did the movement begin to take real shape.&quot; He also decided to be a sculptor after he visited various studios in Paris, in 1912, including those of Georges Braque, Alexander Archipenko, Constantin Brâncuși, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, August Agero and, probably, Medardo Rosso. In 1912 he exhibited some paintings together with other Italian futurists at the Galerie Bernheim-Jeune, and the following year returned to show his sculptures at the Galerie La Boétie: all related to the elaboration of what Boccioni had seen in Paris, where he had visited the studios of Cubist sculptors, including those of Constantin Brâncuși, Raymond Duchamp-Villon and Alexander Archipenko to further his knowledge of avant-garde sculpture.
In 1914 he published &quot;Pittura e scultura futuriste (dinamismo plastico)&quot; explaining the aesthetics of the group:

&quot;While the impressionists paint a picture to give one particular moment and subordinate the life of the picture to its resemblance to this moment, we synthesize every moment (time, place, form, color-tone) and thus paint the picture.&quot;
He exhibited in London, together with the group, in 1912 (Sackville Gallery) and 1914 (Doré Gallery): the two exhibitions made a deep impression on a number of young English artists, in particular C.R.W. Nevinson, who joined the movement. Others aligned themselves instead to its British equivalent, Vorticism, led by Wyndham Lewis.

&quot;Boccioni&#x27;s gift was to bring a fresh eye to reality in ways that, we now recognise, defined the nature of the modern movement in the visual arts and literature, too.&quot; --Michael Glover (art critic, &quot;The Independent&quot;)
== Military service and death ==

Italian involvement in the First World War began late in May 1915 with Italy&#x27;s declaration of war on the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The &quot;Lombard Battalion Volunteers Cyclists and Motorists&quot;, which Boccioni was part of, set off in early June from Milan to Gallarate, then on to Peschiera del Garda, in the rear of the Trentino front. In July 1915, the volunteers were intended for a sector of the front around Ala and the Gardesana. On 24 October 1915, Boccioni participated in the battle of Dosso Casina. On 1 December 1915, the battalion was dissolved as part of a general reorganization; the volunteers were laid off temporarily, then each was called up along with the class. In May 1916 Boccioni was drafted into the Italian Army, and was assigned to an artillery regiment at Sorte of Chievo, near Verona. On 16 August 1916, he was thrown from his horse during a cavalry training exercise and was trampled. He died the following day, age thirty-three, at Verona Military Hospital, and he was buried in the Monumental Cemetery of that city.

==Works==

===Early portraits and landscapes===
From 1902 to 1910, Boccioni focused initially on drawings, then sketched and painted portraits – with his mother as a frequent model. He also painted landscapes – often including the arrival of industrialization, trains and factories for example. During this period, he weaves between Pointillism and Impressionism, and the influence of Giacomo Balla, and Divisionism techniques are evident in early paintings (although later largely abandoned). &quot;The Morning&quot; (1909) was noted for &quot;the bold and youthful violence of hues&quot; and as &quot;a daring exercise in luminosity.&quot; His 1909–10 &quot;Three Women&quot;, which portrays his mother and sister, and longtime lover Ines at center, was cited as expressing great emotion – strength, melancholy and love.

===Development of Futurism===

Boccioni worked for nearly a year on &quot;La città sale&quot; or &quot;The City Rises&quot;, 1910, a huge (2m by 3m) painting, which is considered his turning point into Futurism. &quot;I attempted a great synthesis of labor, light and movement&quot; he wrote to a friend. Upon its exhibition in Milan in May 1911, the painting attracted numerous reviews, mostly admiring. By 1912 it had become a headline painting for the exhibition traveling Europe, the introduction to Futurism. It was sold to the great pianist, Ferruccio Busoni for 4,000 lire that year, and today is frequently on prominent display at the Museum of Modern Art in New York, at the entrance to the paintings department.
&quot;La risata&quot; (1911, &quot;The Laugh&quot;) is considered Boccioni&#x27;s first truly Futurist work. He had fully parted with Divisionism, and now focused on the sensations derived from his observation of modern life. Its public reception was quite negative, compared unfavorably with &quot;Three Women&quot;, and it was defaced by a visitor, running his fingers through the still fresh paint. Subsequent criticism became more positive, with some considering the painting a response to Cubism. It was purchased by Albert Borchardt, a German collector who acquired 20 Futurist works exhibited in Berlin, including &quot;The Street Enters the House&quot; (1911) which depicts a woman on a balcony overlooking a busy street. Today the former also is owned by the Museum of Modern Art, and the latter by the Sprengel Museum in Hanover.
Boccioni spent much of 1911 working on a trilogy of paintings titled &quot;&quot;Stati d&#x27;animo&quot; (&quot;States of Mind&quot;&quot;), which he said expressed departure and arrival at a railroad station – &quot;The Farewells&quot;, &quot;Those Who Go&quot;, and &quot;Those Who Stay&quot;. All three paintings were originally purchased by Marinetti, until Nelson Rockefeller acquired them from his widow and later donated them to the Museum of Modern Art in New York.

Beginning in 1912, with &quot;Elasticità&quot; or &quot;Elasticity&quot;, depicting the pure energy of a horse, captured with intense chromaticism, he completed a series of Dynamist paintings: &quot;Dinamismo di un corpo umano&quot; (&quot;Human Body&quot;), &quot;ciclista&quot; (&quot;Cyclist&quot;), &quot;Foot-baller&quot;, and by 1914 &quot;Dinamismo plastico: cavallo + caseggiato&quot; (&quot;Plastic Dynamism: Horse + Houses&quot;).

While continuing this focus, he revived his previous interest in portraiture. Beginning with &quot;L&#x27;antigrazioso&quot; (&quot;The antigraceful&quot;) in 1912 and continuing with &quot;I selciatori&quot; (&quot;The Street Pavers&quot;) and &quot;Il bevitore&quot; (&quot;The Drinker&quot;) both in 1914.

In 1914 Boccioni published his book, &quot;Pittura, scultura futuriste&quot; (&quot;Futurist Painting and Sculpture&quot;), which caused a rift between himself and some of his Futurist comrades. As a result, perhaps, he abandoned his exploration of Dynamism, and instead sought further decomposition of a subject by means of colour. With &quot;Horizontal Volumes&quot; in 1915 and the &quot;Portrait of Ferruccio Busoni&quot; in 1916, he completed a full return to figurative painting. Perhaps fittingly, this last painting was a portrait of the maestro who purchased his first Futurist work, &quot;The City Rises&quot;.

Between 1906 and 1915 his mother Cecilia Forlani appeared as a key figure in at least forty-five of his works, in various media.

===Sculpture===
The writing of his (&quot;Technical manifesto of Futurist sculpture&quot;), published on 11 April 1912, was Boccioni&#x27;s intellectual and physical launch into sculpture; he had begun working in sculpture in the previous year.

By the end of 1913 he had completed what is considered his masterpiece, &quot;Forme uniche della continuità nello spazio&quot; (&quot;Unique Forms of Continuity in Space&quot;), in wax. His goal for the work was to depict a &quot;synthetic continuity&quot; of motion, instead of an &quot;analytical discontinuity&quot; that he saw in such artists as František Kupka and Marcel Duchamp. During his life, the work only existed as a plaster cast. It was first cast in bronze in 1931. This sculpture has been the subject of extensive commentary, and in 1998 it was selected as the image to be engraved on the back of the Italian 20-cent euro coin.

Soon after Boccioni&#x27;s death in 1916 (and after a memorial exhibition was held in Milan), his family entrusted them for an impermanent time to a fellow sculptor, Piero da Verona; da Verona then requested that his assistant place them in the local rubbish-dump. Marinetti&#x27;s outraged account of the destruction of the sculptures was slightly different; in his memoirs, he stated that the sculptures were destroyed by workmen to clear the room the &quot;envious passèist narrow-minded sculptor&quot; had placed them. Thus, much of his experimental work from late 1912 to 1913 was destroyed, including pieces relating to contemporaneous paintings, which are known only through photographs. One of the few surviving pieces is the &quot;Antigrazioso&quot; (&quot;Anti-Graceful&quot;, also called &quot;The Mother&quot;).

In 2019, the Estorick Collection of Modern Italian Art held an exhibition reconstructing several of the destroyed sculptures.

<doc id="262824" wikidata="Q1229401" url="?curid=262824" title="Kennedy–Thorndike experiment">
<text>The Kennedy–Thorndike experiment, first conducted in 1932 by Roy J. Kennedy and Edward M. Thorndike, is a modified form of the Michelson–Morley experimental procedure, testing special relativity.
The modification is to make one arm of the classical Michelson–Morley (MM) apparatus shorter than the other one. While the Michelson–Morley experiment showed that the speed of light is independent of the &quot;orientation&quot; of the apparatus, the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment showed that it is also independent of the &quot;velocity&quot; of the apparatus in different inertial frames. It also served as a test to indirectly verify time dilation – while the negative result of the Michelson–Morley experiment can be explained by length contraction alone, the negative result of the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment requires time dilation in addition to length contraction to explain why no phase shifts will be detected while the Earth moves around the Sun. The first &quot;direct&quot; confirmation of time dilation was achieved by the Ives–Stilwell experiment. Combining the results of those three experiments, the complete Lorentz transformation can be derived.

Improved variants of the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment have been conducted using optical cavities or Lunar Laser Ranging. For a general overview of tests of Lorentz invariance, see Tests of special relativity.

==The experiment==
The original Michelson–Morley experiment was useful for testing the Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction hypothesis only. Kennedy had already made several increasingly sophisticated versions of the MM experiment through the 1920s when he struck upon a way to test time dilation as well. In their own words:

Referring to Fig. 1, key optical components were mounted within vacuum chamber &quot;V&quot; on a fused quartz base of extremely low coefficient of thermal expansion. A water jacket &quot;W&quot; kept the temperature regulated to within 0.001 °C. Monochromatic green light from a mercury source &quot;Hg&quot; passed through a Nicol polarizing prism &quot;N&quot; before entering the vacuum chamber, and was split by a beam splitter &quot;B&quot; set at Brewster&#x27;s angle to prevent unwanted rear surface reflections. The two beams were directed towards two mirrors &quot;M1&quot; and &quot;M2&quot; which were set at distances as divergent as possible given the coherence length of the 5461 Å mercury line (≈32 cm, allowing a difference in arm length Δ&quot;L&quot; ≈ 16 cm). The reflected beams recombined to form circular interference fringes which were photographed at &quot;P&quot;. A slit &quot;S&quot; allowed multiple exposures across the diameter of the rings to be recorded on a single photographic plate at different times of day.

By making one arm of the experiment much shorter than the other, a change in velocity of the Earth would cause changes in the travel times of the light rays, from which a fringe shift would result unless the frequency of the light source changed to the same degree. In order to determine if such a fringe shift took place, the interferometer was made extremely stable and the interference patterns were photographed for later comparison. The tests were done over a period of many months. As no significant fringe shift was found (corresponding to a velocity of 10±10 km/s within the margin of error), the experimenters concluded that time dilation occurs as predicted by Special relativity.

== Theory ==

=== Basic theory of the experiment ===

Although Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction (Lorentz contraction) by itself is fully able to explain the null results of the Michelson–Morley experiment, it is unable by itself to explain the null results of the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment. Lorentz–FitzGerald contraction is given by the formula:

:formula_1

where
:formula_2 is the proper length (the length of the object in its rest frame),
:formula_3 is the length observed by an observer in relative motion with respect to the object,
:formula_4 is the relative velocity between the observer and the moving object, &quot;i.e.&quot; between the hypothetical aether and the moving object
:formula_5 is the speed of light,

and the &quot;Lorentz factor&quot; is defined as

:formula_6.

Fig. 2 illustrates a Kennedy–Thorndike apparatus with perpendicular arms and assumes the validity of Lorentz contraction. If the apparatus is &quot;motionless&quot; with respect to the hypothetical aether, the difference in time that it takes light to traverse the longitudinal and transverse arms is given by:

The time it takes light to traverse back-and-forth along the Lorentz–contracted length of the longitudinal arm is given by:

:formula_7 
where &quot;T&quot;1 is the travel time in direction of motion, &quot;T&quot;2 in the opposite direction, &quot;v&quot; is the velocity component with respect to the luminiferous aether, &quot;c&quot; is the speed of light, and &quot;LL&quot; the length of the longitudinal interferometer arm. The time it takes light to go across and back the transverse arm is given by:

:formula_8

The difference in time that it takes light to traverse the longitudinal and transverse arms is given by:

Because Δ&quot;L=c(TL-TT)&quot;, the following travel length differences are given (Δ&quot;LA&quot; being the initial travel length difference and &quot;vA&quot; the initial velocity of the apparatus, and Δ&quot;LB&quot; and &quot;vB&quot; after rotation or velocity change due to Earth&#x27;s own rotation or its rotation around the Sun):

:formula_9.

In order to obtain a negative result, we should have Δ&quot;LA&quot;−Δ&quot;LB&quot;=0. However, it can be seen that both formulas only cancel each other as long as the velocities are the same (&quot;vA&quot;=&quot;vB&quot;). But if the velocities are different, then Δ&quot;LA&quot; and Δ&quot;LB&quot; are no longer equal. (The Michelson–Morley experiment isn&#x27;t affected by velocity changes since the difference between &quot;L&quot;L and &quot;L&quot;T is zero. Therefore, the MM experiment only tests whether the speed of light depends on the &quot;orientation&quot; of the apparatus.) But in the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment, the lengths &quot;L&quot;L and &quot;L&quot;T are different from the outset, so it is also capable of measuring the dependence of the speed of light on the &quot;velocity&quot; of the apparatus.

According to the previous formula, the travel length difference Δ&quot;LA&quot;−Δ&quot;LB&quot; and consequently the expected fringe shift Δ&quot;N&quot; are given by (λ being the wavelength):

:formula_10.

Neglecting magnitudes higher than second order in &quot;v/c&quot;:

:formula_11

For constant Δ&quot;N&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; for the fringe shift to be independent of velocity or orientation of the apparatus, it is necessary that the frequency and thus the wavelength λ be modified by the Lorentz factor. This is actually the case when the effect of time dilation on the frequency is considered. Therefore, both length contraction and time dilation are required to explain the negative result of the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment.

=== Importance for relativity ===
In 1905, it had been shown by Henri Poincaré and Albert Einstein that the Lorentz transformation must form a group to satisfy the principle of relativity (see History of Lorentz transformations). This requires that length contraction and time dilation have the exact relativistic values. Kennedy and Thorndike now argued that they could derive the complete Lorentz transformation solely from the experimental data of the Michelson–Morley experiment and the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment. But this is not strictly correct, since length contraction and time dilation having their exact relativistic values are sufficient but not necessary for the explanation of both experiments. This is because length contraction solely in the direction of motion is only one possibility to explain the Michelson–Morley experiment. In general, its null result requires that the &quot;ratio&quot; between transverse and longitudinal lengths corresponds to the Lorentz factor – which includes infinitely many combinations of length changes in the transverse and longitudinal direction. This also affects the role of time dilation in the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment, because its value depends on the value of length contraction used in the analysis of the experiment. Therefore, it&#x27;s necessary to consider a third experiment, the Ives–Stilwell experiment, in order to derive the Lorentz transformation from experimental data alone.

More precisely: In the framework of the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl test theory, the following scheme can be used to describe the experiments: α represents time changes, β length changes in the direction of motion, and δ length changes perpendicular to the direction of motion. The Michelson–Morley experiment tests the relationship between β and δ, while the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment tests the relationship between α and β. So α depends on β which itself depends on δ, and only combinations of those quantities but not their individual values can be measured in these two experiments. Another experiment is necessary to &quot;directly&quot; measure the value of one of these quantities. This was actually achieved with the Ives-Stilwell experiment, which measured α as having the value predicted by relativistic time dilation. Combining this value for α with the Kennedy–Thorndike null result shows that β necessarily must assume the value of relativistic length contraction. And combining this value for β with the Michelson–Morley null result shows that δ must be zero. So the necessary components of the Lorentz transformation are provided by experiment, in agreement with the theoretical requirements of group theory.

==Recent experiments==
=== Cavity tests ===

In recent years, Michelson–Morley experiments as well as Kennedy–Thorndike type experiments have been repeated with increased precision using lasers, masers, and cryogenic optical resonators. The bounds on velocity dependence according to the Robertson-Mansouri-Sexl test theory (RMS), which indicates the relation between time dilation and length contraction, have been significantly improved. For instance, the original Kennedy–Thorndike experiment set bounds on RMS velocity dependence of ~10−2, but current limits are in the ~10−8 range.

Fig. 3 presents a simplified schematic diagram of Braxmaier &quot;et al.&#x27;s&quot; 2002 repeat of the Kennedy–Thorndike experiment. On the left, photodetectors (PD) monitor the resonance of a sapphire cryogenic optical resonator (CORE) length standard kept at liquid helium temperature to stabilize the frequency of a Nd:YAG laser to 1064 nm. On the right, the 532 nm absorbance line of a low pressure iodine reference is used as a time standard to stabilize the (doubled) frequency of a second Nd:YAG laser.

=== Lunar laser ranging ===
In addition to terrestrial measurements, Kennedy–Thorndike experiments were carried out by Müller &amp; Soffel (1995) and Müller et al. (1999) using Lunar Laser Ranging data, in which the Earth-Moon distance is evaluated to an accuracy of centimeters. If there is a preferred frame of reference and the speed of light depends on the observer&#x27;s velocity, then anomalous oscillations should be observable in the Earth-Moon distance measurements. Since time dilation is already confirmed to high precision, the observance of such oscillations would demonstrate dependence of the speed of light on the observer’s velocity, as well as direction dependence of length contraction. However, no such oscillations were observed in either study, with a RMS velocity bound of ~10−5, comparable to the bounds set by Hils and Hall (1990). Hence both length contraction and time dilation must have the values predicted by relativity.

<text>The Labour Party (, ) is a centre-left and social democratic political party in the Republic of Ireland. Founded on 28 May 1912 in Clonmel, County Tipperary, by James Connolly, James Larkin, and William O&#x27;Brien as the political wing of the Irish Trades Union Congress.

Labour continues to be the political arm of the Irish trade union and labour movement and seeks to represent workers&#x27; interests in the Dáil and on a local level. Unlike many other Irish political parties, Labour did not arise as a faction of the original Sinn Féin party, although it merged with the Democratic Left in 1999, a party that traced its origins back to Sinn Féin. The party has served as a partner in coalition governments on eight occasions since its formation: seven times in coalition either with Fine Gael alone or with Fine Gael and other smaller parties, and once with Fianna Fáil. This gives Labour a cumulative total of twenty-five years served as part of a government, the third-longest total of any party in the Republic of Ireland after Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael.

Led by Ivana Bacik, it is the fourth-largest party in Dáil Éireann, with eleven seats, and is the fourth-largest party in Seanad Éireann, with two seats, making Labour the fourth-largest party in the Oireachtas overall as of 2025. It currently has 1 MEP. The Labour Party is a member of the Progressive Alliance, Socialist International, and Party of European Socialists.

==History==

===Foundation===
James Connolly, James Larkin and William O&#x27;Brien established the Irish Labour Party on 28 May 1912, as the political wing of the Irish Trades Union Congress, in Clonmel Town Hall. This party was to represent the workers in the expected Dublin Parliament under the Third Home Rule Act 1914. However, after the defeat of the trade unions in the Dublin Lockout of 1913 the labour movement was weakened; the emigration of James Larkin in 1914 and the execution of James Connolly following the Easter Rising in 1916 further damaged it.

The Irish Citizen Army (ICA), formed during the 1913 Lockout, was informally the military wing of the Labour Movement. The ICA took part in the 1916 Rising. Councillor Richard O&#x27;Carroll, a Labour Party member of Dublin Corporation, was the only serving elected representative to be killed during the Easter Rising. O&#x27;Carroll was shot by John Bowen-Colthurst and died several days later, on 5 May 1916. The ICA was revived during Peadar O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s Republican Congress but after the 1935 split in the Congress most ICA members joined the Labour Party.

===Early history===
In Larkin&#x27;s absence, William O&#x27;Brien became the dominant figure in the Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU) and wielded considerable influence in the Labour Party. O&#x27;Brien also dominated the Irish Trades Union Congress. The Labour Party, led by Thomas Johnson from 1917, declined to contest the 1918 general election in order to allow the election to take the form of a plebiscite on Ireland&#x27;s constitutional status (although some candidates did run in Belfast constituencies under the Labour banner against Unionist candidates). It also refrained from contesting the 1921 elections. As a result, the party was left outside Dáil Éireann during the vital years of the independence struggle.

===In the Irish Free State===
The Anglo-Irish Treaty divided the Labour Party. Some members sided with the Irregulars in the Irish Civil War that quickly followed, however O&#x27;Brien and Johnson encouraged its members to support the Treaty. In the 1922 general election the party won 17 seats, having fielded 18 candidates. Winning 21.4% of the first preference vote, this remains the party&#x27;s highest ever share of the vote as of 2022. However, there were a number of strikes during the first year and a loss in support for the party. In the 1923 general election the Labour Party only won 14 seats. From 1922 until Fianna Fáil TDs took their seats in 1927, the Labour Party was the major opposition party in the Dáil. Labour attacked the lack of social reform by the Cumann na nGaedheal government. From 1927, a large number of the Labour Party&#x27;s voters were pre-empted by Fianna Fáil, with its almost identical policies. Labour lacked Fianna Fáil&#x27;s &#x27;republican&#x27; image, which was a contributing factor to this loss.

Larkin returned to Ireland in April 1923. He hoped to resume the leadership role in the ITGWU which he had previously left, but O&#x27;Brien resisted him. Larkin also created a pro-communist party called the Irish Worker League. O&#x27;Brien regarded Larkin as a &quot;loose cannon.&quot; Following a failed challenge to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s leadership and association with communist militancy, Larkin was expelled from the ITGWU and created the WUI, a communist alternative to the ITGWU, in 1924. Two-thirds of the Dublin membership of the ITGWU defected to the new union. O&#x27;Brien blocked the WUI from admission to the ITUC. Larkin was elected to Dáil Éireann at the September 1927 general election. However, the Labour Party prevented him from taking his seat as an undischarged bankrupt for losing a libel case against Labour leader Tom Johnson. 

In 1932, the Labour Party supported Éamon de Valera&#x27;s first Fianna Fáil government, which had proposed a programme of social reform with which the party was in sympathy. In the 1943 general election the party won 17 seats, its best result since 1927.

The Irish Labour Party and the Irish Trades Union Congress separated in 1930. Future leader William Norton was prominent in urging the separation of the political and industrial wings of the labour movement into autonomous organisations, arguing that the move was necessary to broaden the party&#x27;s electoral appeal beyond a trade union constituency.

The party was socially conservative compared to similar European parties, and its leaders from 1932 to 1977 (William Norton and his successor Brendan Corish) were members of the Catholic fraternal organisation the Knights of Saint Columbanus. The early to mid-20th century marked constant battles within Labour about whether to appease the Catholic Church or to take on a more militant labour approach.

=== Split with National Labour and the first coalition governments ===

Despite efforts in the 1930s to sternly downplay the idea of Communist influence over the party, by the 1940s internal conflict and complementary allegations of communist infiltration caused a split in the Labour Party and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions. Tensions peaked in 1941 when party founder Jim Larkin and a number of his supporters were re-admitted to the party and subsequently accused of &quot;taking over&quot; Labour branches in Dublin. In response William X. O&#x27;Brien left with six TDs in 1944, founding the National Labour Party, whose leader was James Everett. O&#x27;Brien also withdrew the ITGWU from the Irish Trades Unions Congress and set up his own congress. The split damaged the Labour movement in the 1944 general election. The ITGWU attacked &quot;Larkinite and Communist Party elements&quot; which it claimed had taken over the Labour Party. The split and the anti-communist assault put Labour on the defensive. It launched its own inquiry into communist involvement, which resulted in the expulsion of six members. Alfred O&#x27;Rahilly in &quot;The Communist Front and the Attack on Irish Labour&quot; widened the assault to include the influence of British-based unions and communists in the ITUC. The National Labour Party juxtaposed itself against this by emphasising its commitment to Catholic Social Teaching. However, Labour also continued to emphasise its anti-communist credentials. Only after Larkin&#x27;s death in 1947 could an attempt at unity be made.

After the 1948 general election National Labour had five TDs – Everett, Dan Spring, James Pattison, James Hickey and John O&#x27;Leary. National Labour and Labour (with 14 TDs) both entered the First Inter-Party Government, with the leader of National Labour becoming Minister for Posts and Telegraphs. In 1950, the National Labour TDs rejoined the Labour Party.

From 1948 to 1951 and from 1954 to 1957, the Labour Party was the second-largest partner in the two inter-party governments (the largest being Fine Gael). William Norton, the Labour Party leader, became Tánaiste on both occasions. During the First Inter-Party Government he served as Minister for Social Welfare, while during the Second Inter-Party Government he served as Minister for Industry and Commerce. (See first inter-party government and second inter-party government.)

===Re-establishment in Northern Ireland===
The Republic of Ireland Act 1948 and Ireland Act 1949 precipitated a split in the Northern Ireland Labour Party (NILP) with Jack Macgougan leading anti-Partition members out and affiliating branches to the Dublin party, joined by other left-wing and nationalist representatives and branded locally as &quot;Irish Labour&quot;. At Westminster, Jack Beattie held Belfast West from 1951 to 1955; the British Labour party refused Beattie its whip. At Stormont, Belfast Dock was won by Murtagh Morgan in 1953 and Paddy Devlin in 1962, but Devlin in 1964 left for the Republican Labour Party and Irish Labour contested no further Westminster or Stormont elections. In the 1949 local elections it won 7 seats on Belfast City Council, 6 (unopposed) on Armagh urban district council (UDC) and one on Dungannon UDC. In Derry, the party collapsed when Stephen McGonagle left after 1952. It was strongest in Warrenpoint and Newry UDCs, winning control of the former in 1949 and the latter in 1958, retaining seats in both until their 1973 abolition. Tommy Markey was expelled from the party in 1964 for taking a salute as Newry council chair from the Irish Guards. Party branches still existed in Warrenpoint and Newry as late as 1982, though candidates were heavily defeated in Newry and Mourne District Council at the 1973 local elections. The Social Democratic and Labour Party founded in 1970 took most of Irish Labour&#x27;s voters and soon had its formal endorsement.

===Under Brendan Corish, 1960–1977===

Brendan Corish became the new Labour leader in 1960. As leader, he advocated for more socialist policies to be adopted by the party; although initially tempering by this describing these policies as &quot;a form of Christian socialism&quot;, he would later feel comfortable enough to drop the &quot;Christian&quot; prefix. In contrast to his predecessors, Corish adopted an anti-coalition stance. He attempted to give his fractious, divided party a coherent national identity, lurched it to the left and insisted Labour was the natural party of social justice. In the late 1960s, Labour began to embrace the &#x27;New Left,&#x27; and Corish presented his &quot;A New Republic&quot; document at the 1967 Labour national conference, alongside a famous speech which declared that &quot;The seventies will be socialist&quot;, which later became a Labour campaign slogan. Corish&#x27;s new socialist direction for Labour was generally well-received internally; the membership&#x27;s faith in Corish had already been bolstered by encouraging election results in 1965 and 1967.

Although Labour&#x27;s share of the vote improved to 17% in the 1969 Irish general election, the best in 50 years, the party only won 17 seats - 5 fewer than in the 1965 general election. The result dented Corish&#x27;s confidence and caused him to reconsider his anti-coalition stance.

Labour promoted a Eurosceptic outlook in the 1961 general election, and in 1972, the party campaigned against membership of the European Economic Community (EEC).

Between 1973 and 1977, the Labour Party formed a coalition government with Fine Gael. The coalition partners lost the subsequent 1977 general election, and Corish resigned immediately after the defeat and was succeeded by Frank Cluskey following a leadership contest.

===Late 1970s and 1980s: Coalition, internal feuding, electoral decline and regrowth===
In 1977, shortly after the election defeat, members grouped around the Liaison Committee for the Labour Left split from Labour and formed the short-lived Socialist Labour Party. From 1981 to 1982 and from 1982 to 1987, the Labour Party participated in coalition governments with Fine Gael. While serving in coalition Labour was successful in averting steep cuts in social welfare favoured by Fine Gael. Labour ministers also presided over a number of social policy initiatives such as a Family Income Supplement, a child care protection bill, a Maternity Benefit, a social employment scheme, the establishment of a Youth employment agency, and the adoption of an equa treatment directive. Nevertheless, as noted by one study, “voters did not reward them. Instead they were disappointed by Labour&#x27;s inability to implement more of its own policies (Marsh and Mitchell 1999:49).”

In the later part of the second of these coalition terms, the country&#x27;s poor economic and fiscal situation required strict curtailing of government spending, and the Labour Party bore much of the blame for unpopular cutbacks in health and other public services. The nadir for the Labour party was the 1987 general election where it received only 6.4% of the vote. Its vote was increasingly threatened by the growth of the Marxist and more radical Workers&#x27; Party, particularly in Dublin. Fianna Fáil formed a minority government from 1987 to 1989 and then a coalition with the Progressive Democrats.

The 1980s saw fierce disagreements between the wings of the party. The more radical elements, Labour Left, led by such figures as Emmet Stagg, Sam Nolan, Frank Buckley and Helena Sheehan, and Militant Tendency, led by Joe Higgins, opposed the idea of Labour entering into coalition government with either of the major centre-right parties (Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael). At the 1989 Labour Party conference in Tralee a number of socialist and Trotskyist activists, organised around the Militant Tendency and their internal newspaper, were expelled. Amongst those expelled included future TDs Clare Daly, Ruth Coppinger and Mick Barry as well as Joe Higgins, who went on to found the Socialist Party in 1996.

===1990s: Growing political influence and involvement===

The early 1990s saw a sustained period of growth for the Labour Party. In 1990 former Labour Senator Mary Robinson became the first President of Ireland to have been proposed by the Labour Party. Although she had contested the election as an independent candidate, having resigned from the party over her opposition to the Anglo Irish Agreement, her victory was generally considered as reflecting very well on Labour, who had supported her campaign. Not only was it the first time a woman held the office but it was the first time, apart from Douglas Hyde, that a non-Fianna Fáil candidate was elected. It was also in 1990 that Limerick East TD Jim Kemmy&#x27;s Democratic Socialist Party merged into the Labour Party, and in 1992 Sligo–Leitrim TD Declan Bree&#x27;s Independent Socialist Party also followed suit and joined the Labour Party.

At the 1992 general election the Labour Party won a record 19.3% of the first preference votes, more than twice its share in the 1989 general election. The party&#x27;s representation in the Dáil doubled to 33 seats in a momentum swing dubbed by the Irish national media as the &quot;Spring Tide&quot;, who attributed much of the surge in the party&#x27;s popularity to its leader Dick Spring. After a period of negotiations, the Labour Party formed a coalition with Fianna Fáil, taking office in January 1993 as the 23rd government of Ireland. Fianna Fáil leader Albert Reynolds remained as Taoiseach, and Labour Party leader Dick Spring became Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs.

After less than two years the government fell in a controversy over the appointment of Attorney General, Harry Whelehan, as president of the High Court. The parliamentary arithmetic had changed as a result of Fianna Fáil&#x27;s loss of two seats in by-elections in June, where the Labour Party itself had performed disastrously. On the pretext that the Labour Party voters were not happy with involvement with Fianna Fáil, Dick Spring withdrew his support for Reynolds as Taoiseach. The Labour Party negotiated a new coalition, the first time in Irish political history that one coalition replaced another without a general election. Between 1994 and 1997 Fine Gael, the Labour Party, and Democratic Left governed in the 24th government of Ireland. Dick Spring became Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs again. Labour greatly influenced the policy document for the 1993-1994 coalition, with one observer noting that Fianna Fáil&#x27;s policy document for the coalition &quot;contained lots of our policies, While swaths of texts were lifted from our manifesto&quot;. (Bowcott 1993)

===Merger with Democratic Left===

The Labour Party presented the 1997 general election, held just weeks after spectacular electoral victories for the French Socialist Party and British Labour Party, as the first-ever choice between a government of the left and one of the right; but the party, as had often been the case following its participation in coalitions, lost support and lost half of its TDs. Labour&#x27;s losses were so severe that while Fine Gael gained seats, it still came up well short of the support it needed to keep Bruton in office. This, combined with a poor showing by Labour Party candidate Adi Roche in the subsequent election for President of Ireland, led to Spring&#x27;s resignation as party leader.

In 1997 Ruairi Quinn became the new Labour Party leader. Following negotiations in 1999, the Labour Party merged with Democratic Left, keeping the name of the larger partner. This had been previously opposed by the former leader Dick Spring. Members of Democratic Left in Northern Ireland were invited to join the Irish Labour Party but were not permitted to organise.

Quinn resigned as leader in 2002 following the poor results for the Labour Party in the 2002 general election. Former Democratic Left TD Pat Rabbitte became the new leader, the first to be elected directly by the members of the party.

===Rabbitte as leader 2002 to 2007===
Prior to the 2004 local elections, party leader Pat Rabbitte had endorsed a mutual transfer pact with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny. Rabbitte proposed an extension of this strategy, named &quot;the Mullingar Accord&quot;, going into the 2007 general election. Although Rabbitte&#x27;s strategy was opposed by some influential members such as Brendan Howlin it was supported by approximately 80% of Labour conference delegates. However, at 2007 general election the Labour Party failed to increase its seat total and had a net loss of 1 seat, returning with 20 seats. Fine Gael, the Labour Party, the Green Party and independents did not have enough seats to form a government. Pat Rabbitte resisted calls to enter negotiations with Fianna Fáil on forming a government. Eventually, Fianna Fáil entered government with the Progressive Democrats and the Green Party with the support of independents. In the aftermath, Rabbitte resigned as Labour Party leader in late August, taking responsibility for the general election result. In his wake Eamon Gilmore was elected, unopposed, as the new Labour leader.

===2007 to 2016===
====Initial surge of support====

Following the onset of the post-2008 Irish economic downturn, Labour&#x27;s political fortunes began to alter rapidly. At the local elections of 5 June 2009, the Labour Party added 31 new councillors to their tally and performed particularly well in the Dublin region. At the 2009 European Parliament election held on the same day, the Labour Party increased its number of seats from one to three, retaining the seat of Proinsias De Rossa in the Dublin constituency, while gaining seats in the East constituency with Nessa Childers, and in the South constituency with Alan Kelly. It was the first time since the 1979 European Parliament Elections that Labour had equalled the number of seats held in Europe by either Fianna Fáil or Fine Gael.

On 11 June 2010, a poll by MRBI was published in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; which, for the first time in the history of the state, showed the Labour Party as the most popular, at 32%, ahead of Fine Gael at 28% and Fianna Fáil at 17%. Eamon Gilmore&#x27;s approval ratings were also the highest of any Dáil leader, standing at 46%.

====Entering government in 2011 and subsequent decline in support====
At the 2011 general election, Labour received 19.5% of first preference votes, and 37 seats. It was the most seats the Labour party had ever won in the Dáil, and their highest percentage of first-preference-votes since the Spring Tide of 1992. On 9 March 2011, it became the junior partner in a coalition government with Fine Gael for the period of the 31st Dáil. Eamon Gilmore was appointed as Tánaiste (deputy prime minister) and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.

In October 2011 the Labour Party&#x27;s candidate, Michael D. Higgins was elected as the 9th (and current) President of Ireland. On the same day, Labour&#x27;s Patrick Nulty won the Dublin West by-election, making the Labour Party the first government party in Ireland to win a by-election since 1982.

Labour lost seven parliamentary members over the course of the 31st Dáil. On 15 November 2011 Willie Penrose resigned over the closure of an army barracks in his constituency. On 1 December 2011 Tommy Broughan lost the party whip after voting against the government in relation to the Bank Guarantee Scheme. On 6 December 2011 Patrick Nulty lost the party whip after voting against the VAT increase in the 2012 budget. On 26 September 2012 Róisín Shortall resigned as Minister of State for Primary Care and lost the party whip after conflict with the Minister for Health James Reilly. On 13 December 2012 Colm Keaveney lost the party whip after voting against the cut to the respite care grant in the 2013 budget. Senator James Heffernan lost the party whip in December 2012 after voting against the government on the Social Welfare Bill. MEP Nessa Childers resigned from the parliamentary party on 5 April 2013, saying that she &quot;no longer want[ed] to support a Government that is actually hurting people&quot;, and she resigned from the party in July 2013. In June 2013, Patrick Nulty and Colm Keaveney resigned from the Labour Party. Willie Penrose returned to the parliamentary Labour Party in October 2013.

On 26 May 2014, Gilmore resigned as party leader after Labour&#x27;s poor performance in the European and local elections. On 4 July 2014, Joan Burton won the leadership election, defeating Alex White by 78% to 22%. On her election, she said that the Labour Party &quot;would focus on social repair, and govern more with the heart&quot;. Burton was the first woman to lead the Labour Party.

====2016====
In the 2016 general election, Labour achieved a poor result, receiving only 6.6% of first preference votes, and 7 seats. It was the worst general election in its history, with a loss of 30 seats on its showing in 2011.
On 20 May 2016, Brendan Howlin was elected unopposed as leader; some controversy arose from the fact that there was no contest for the leadership because none of his parliamentary colleagues were prepared to second the nomination of Alan Kelly. Howlin stated that as leader he was prepared to bring Labour back into government, citing the lack of influence on policy from opposition. He denied any suggestions that Labour could lose any further support from their 2016 performance, stating &quot;We&#x27;re not some outfit that comes out of the morning mist and disappears again. We&#x27;re the oldest party in the state&quot;.

===2019–present===
In the Irish local elections and the European Parliament election of May 2019, despite a decreased vote share by 1.4%, Labour increased their seat count on local authorities to 57, an increase of six. However, the party failed to win a European seat, leaving the S&amp;D Group unrepresented by an Irish MEP for the first time since 1984. At the February 2020 election, the party&#x27;s first preference vote dropped to 4.4%, a record low. In the subsequent Seanad elections, Labour won 5 seats, which tied them with Sinn Féin as the third-largest party in the House.

After the general election, Brendan Howlin announced his intention to step down as the leader of the Labour Party. On 3 April 2020 Alan Kelly was elected as party leader, edging out fellow Dáil colleague Aodhán Ó Ríordáin 55% to 45%. In July 2021, the party gained a seventh TD in the Dáil after Ivana Bacik won the 2021 Dublin Bay South by-election. In March 2022, Kelly resigned suddenly as leader, less than two years into the role and having not lead the party into an election. He did so upon being informed by Sean Sherlock and Duncan Smith, both of whom had supported him in his leadership bid, along with Mark Wall, that the parliamentary party had lost &quot;collective confidence&quot; in his leadership. The plan to remove him was devised by the parliamentary party in the home of Senator Marie Sherlock, in the absence of Kelly. An internal report reportedly showed that every one of the party&#x27;s nationally elected representatives were at risk of losing their seats in the next general election. Kelly became emotional as he announced his resignation, stating that the decision by the parliamentary party was a &quot;surprise&quot; to him, but that he accepted it immediately. On 24 March 2022 Ivana Bacik was confirmed as the new leader of the party unopposed at a conference in Dublin.

At the 2024 European Parliament election, Aodhán Ó Ríordáin was elected in the Dublin constituency, the first MEP elected for the party since 2009.

== Ideology and policies ==
===Overview===

The Labour Party holds a pro-European stance and is a party of the centre-left which has been described as a social democratic party but is referred to in its constitution as a democratic socialist party. Its constitution refers to the party as a &quot;movement of democratic socialists, social democrats, environmentalists, progressives, feminists (and) trade unionists&quot;. It has been described as a &quot;big tent&quot; party by the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;.

The stance of the Labour Party has changed dramatically over time. In 1964 American historian Emmet Larkin described the Irish Labour Party as &quot;the most opportunistically conservative Labour Party anywhere in the known world&quot; due to its Catholic outlook in an Ireland where 95 percent of the population was Roman Catholic. It was known for its longstanding unwillingness (along with Ireland&#x27;s other major parties) to support any policy that could be construed as sympathetic to secularism or communism. However, from the 1980s it was associated with advocacy for socially liberal policies, with former leader Eamon Gilmore stating in 2007 that &quot;more than any other political movement, it was Labour and its allies which drove the modernisation of the Irish state.&quot;

In the past Labour has been referred to, derisively, as &quot;the political wing of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.&quot; That Labour was influenced by Catholicism is not unusual in the Irish context (likewise, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil were also products of a predominantly Catholic society). Labour&#x27;s ethos and often its language was profoundly Christian. Following the official separation of the Irish Labour Party and Irish Trade Union Congress into two different organisations in 1930, early drafts of Labour&#x27;s constitution referred to the responsibilities of the &#x27;Christian state&#x27;, but these had all been removed by the time the constitution was put before the new party&#x27;s conference for approval. However, the Free State&#x27;s commitment to a full-scale devotional revival of Catholicism was reflected in the outlook and policies of the party. The &#x27;Starry Plough,&#x27; the traditional symbol of Labour, reflects a Catholic tradition and biblical reference to Isaiah 2:3-4, which is integral to its design. Like Fianna Fáil, Labour embraced corporatist policies, again influenced by the Catholic Church. This was deemed to be important for both in terms of winning electoral support from the lower and middle classes. However, Labour later became associated with increasing secularism and championing socially liberal causes in relation to contraception, divorce, LGBT rights and abortion. Its support base also shifted greatly towards postmaterialists. The Labour Party also changed its position from Euroscepticism in 1972 to pro-Europeanism and ideological integration with European social democratic parties.

=== LGBT rights policies ===

The Labour Party has been involved in various campaigns for LGBT rights and put forward many bills. The party was in government in 1993 when homosexuality was decriminalised in Ireland, and it was President Mary Robinson, herself a longstanding LGBT advocate, who signed the bill into law. Mervyn Taylor published the Employment Equality Bill in 1996, which was enacted in 1998, outlawing discrimination in the workplace on the grounds of sexual orientation. Taylor also published the Equal Status Bill in 1997, enacted in 2000, outlawing discrimination in the provision of goods and services on grounds listed including sexual orientation.

At the 2002 general election, only the manifestos of the Green Party and Labour explicitly referred to the rights of same-sex couples.

In 2003, Labour LGBT was founded. This was the first time a political party in Ireland had formed an LGBT wing.

In December 2006, Labour TD Brendan Howlin tabled a private member&#x27;s civil unions bill in Dáil Éireann, proposing the legalisation of civil partnerships and adoption for same-sex couples. The Fianna Fáil government amended the bill to delay it for six months time, however the Dáil was dissolved for the 2007 Irish general election before this could happen. Labour again brought this bill before the Dáil in 2007 but it was voted down by the government, with the Green Party, who had formerly supported gay marriage, also voting in opposition to the bill, with spokesperson Ciarán Cuffe arguing that the bill was unconstitutional.

At their 2010 national conference Labour passed a motion calling for transgender rights and to legislate for a gender recognition act.

During their time in government, Ireland became the first country to legalise same-sex marriage by popular vote.

=== Social policies ===
Labour supported the repeal of the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland in 2018 to legalise abortion, and canvassed for a Yes vote in that referendum.

Alan Kelly sponsored a bill in 2020 that called for all workers to receive a legal right to sick pay, as well as paid leave for employees whose children have to stay home from school due to COVID-19 measures. The government amended this bill to delay it for six months, a decision that senator Marie Sherlock branded as &quot;unacceptable&quot;.

=== Education policies ===
In 2020, Labour TD Aodhán Ó Riordáin successfully campaigned for Ireland&#x27;s free school meals campaign to be extended across summer.

Labour have called for all primary education to be made free by providing grants for books, uniforms and students, and ending the two tier pay system for teachers and secretaries.

=== Housing policies ===
In 2020, Labour proposed building 80,000 social and affordable houses, investing €16 billion into housing and freezing rents. In 2021, they called for a three-year rent freeze and a tax to be placed on vacant houses, as well as investment into student housing and preventing student housing from being converted to short term rentals.

=== Health policies ===
In their 2020 manifesto, Labour proposed spending an additional 1 billion euro per year on health and delivering free GP care for all under 18s.

In 2021, Labour proposed nationalising two hospitals - one in Dublin and one in either Galway or Cork.

=== Climate policies ===
In their climate manifesto in 2020, the party called for halving the country&#x27;s emissions by 2030, supporting farms transitioning to more environmental forms of farming, restoring peatlands and bogs, banning offshore drilling and supporting a just transition.

=== Drug policies ===
The Labour Party supports the legalisation of cannabis for recreational and medicinal purposes, having outlined this policy in their submission to the Citizen&#x27;s Assembly on drug use in July 2023.

In 2017, Labour leader Brendan Howlin became the first traditional party leader to back the full decriminalisation of cannabis in Ireland. This came after a motion endorsed by Aodhán Ó Riordáin supporting the legalisation of cannabis for recreational usage was passed at Labour conference. Ó Riordáin had previously voiced his support for the decriminalisation of all drugs, stating that &quot;About 70 per cent of the drugs cases that are before our courts at the moment are for possession for personal use, which to be honest is a complete waste of garda time and criminal justice time&quot;, saying that someone suffering from addiction &quot;is fundamentally a patient, who should be surrounded by compassion, not somebody who should be sitting in a court room.&quot;

The previous party leader Alan Kelly has stated that he supports the legalisation of cannabis in Ireland on both medicinal and recreational grounds, and current party leader Ivana Bacik has also spoken in support of the legalisation of cannabis.

=== Cultural policies ===
The party has called for a campaign to promote the usage of spoken Irish, funding outreach initiatives for minorities and marginalised communities and creating a fund for artists.

==Historical archives==
The Labour Party donated its archives to the National Library of Ireland in 2012. The records can be accessed by means of the call number: MS 49,494. Subsequently, the records of Democratic Left were also donated to the library and can be access via the call number: MS 49,807.

== Election results ==
=== Dáil Éireann ===


=== Seanad Éireann ===
=== Presidential elections ===
===European Parliament===
=== Northern Ireland ===
==== Westminster (House of Commons) ====
====Stormont (Parliament of Northern Ireland)====

It no longer contests Northern Irish elections but considers Social Democratic and Labour Party.

==Structure==
The Labour Party is a membership organisation consisting of Labour (Dáil) constituency councils, affiliated trade unions and socialist societies. Members who are elected to parliamentary positions (Dáil, Seanad, European Parliament) form the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP). The party&#x27;s decision-making bodies on a national level formally include the executive board (formerly known as the National Executive Committee), Labour Party Conference and Central Council. The executive board has responsibility for organisation and finance, with the Central Council being responsible for policy formation – although in practice the Parliamentary leadership has the final say on policy. The Labour Party Conference debates motions put forward by branches, constituency councils, party members sections and affiliates. Motions set principles of policy and organisation but are not generally detailed policy statements.

For many years Labour held to a policy of not allowing residents of Northern Ireland to apply for membership, instead supporting the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP). The National Conference approved the establishment of a Northern Ireland Members Forum but it has not agreed to contest elections there.

As a party with a constitutional commitment to democratic socialism founded by trade unions to represent the interests of working class people, Labour&#x27;s link with unions has always been a defining characteristic of the party. Over time this link has come under increasing strain, with most craft based unions based in the public sector and Irish Congress of Trades Unions having disaffiliated since the 1950s. The remaining affiliated unions are primarily private sector general unions. Currently affiliated unions still send delegates to the National Conference in proportion to the size of their membership. Recent constitutional changes mean that in future, affiliated unions will send delegations based on the number of party members in their organisation.

===Sections===
Within the Labour Party there are different sections:
*Labour Youth
*Labour Women
*Labour Trade Unionists
*Labour Councillors
*Labour Equality (this section also includes groups such as Labour LGBT)
*Labour Disability

==Affiliates==
The Irish Labour Party constitution makes provision for both Trade Unions and Socialist Societies to affiliate to the party. There are currently seven Trade Unions affiliated to the Party:

*Munster &amp; District Graphical Society
*Fórsa (Municipal Employees Division)
*National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT)
*General, Municipal and Boilermakers&#x27; Union (GMB)
*Services, Industrial, Professional and Technical Union (SIPTU)
*Bakers, Food and Allied Workers Union (BFWAU)
*Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA)

Socialist Societies Affiliated to the Party:
*Labour Party Lawyers Group
*Association of Labour Teachers
*Labour Social Services Group

==Leadership==

===Party leader===

===Deputy leader===
===Seanad leader===
==Elected representatives==
===Parliamentary Labour Party===
The Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) is the section of the party that is made up of its members of the Houses of the Oireachtas and of the European Parliament. As of December 2024 there are 16 members of the PLP: 11 TDs and 4 senators and one MEP.

===Front Bench===
===Councillors===
At the 2014 local elections Labour lost more than half of local authority seats; 51 councillors were elected - this result led to the resignation of party leader, Eamon Gilmore. Following the 2019 Irish local elections, the party had 57 local representatives. In the 2024 Irish local elections, the party returned 56 councillors.

<doc id="262828" wikidata="Q202245" url="?curid=262828" title="James Ryan (Irish politician)">
<text>James Ryan (6 December 1892 – 25 September 1970) was an Irish medical doctor, revolutionary and politician who served in every Fianna Fáil government from 1932 to 1965, successively as Minister for Agriculture (1932–1947), Health and Social Welfare (1947–1948 and 1951–1954), and Finance (1957–1965). He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) for Wexford from 1918 to 1922 and 1923 to 1965, and as senator from 1965 to 1969. He was a member of Sinn Féin until he joined Fianna Fáil upon that party&#x27;s foundation in 1926.

==Early and private life==
Ryan was born on the family farm at Tomcoole, near Taghmon, County Wexford, in 1892. The second-youngest of twelve children, he was educated at St Peter&#x27;s College, Wexford, and Ring College, Waterford. In 1911, he won a county council scholarship to University College Dublin where he studied medicine. 

In March 1917 Jim Ryan, as he was always known by his comrades, passed his final medical examinations; that June he set up medical practice in Wexford town. In 1921 Ryan moved to Dublin where he opened a doctor&#x27;s practice at Harcourt Street, specialising in skin diseases at the Skin and Cancer Hospital on Holles Street. He left medicine in 1925, after he bought Kindlestown, a large farm near Delgany, County Wicklow. Ryan lived there and it remained a working farm until his death.

In July 1919, Ryan married Máirín Cregan, originally from County Kerry and a close friend of Sinéad de Valera throughout her life. Cregan, like her husband, had also fought in the Easter Rising and was subsequently an author of children&#x27;s stories in Irish. They had three children together.

One of Ryan&#x27;s sisters, Mary Kate, married Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly, one of Ryan&#x27;s future cabinet colleagues and a future President of Ireland. Following her death O&#x27;Kelly married her sister, Phyllis Ryan. Another of Ryan&#x27;s sisters, Josephine (&#x27;Min&#x27;) Ryan, married Richard Mulcahy, a future leader of Fine Gael. Another sister, Agnes, married Denis McCullough, a Cumann na nGaedheal TD from 1924 to 1927. He is also the great-grandfather of Ireland and Leinster Rugby player James Ryan

==Revolutionary career==
While studying at university in 1913 Ryan joined the Gaelic League at Clonmel. The company commander recruited the young Catholic nationalist, who became a founder-member of the Irish Volunteers and was sworn into the Irish Republican Brotherhood the following year. In 1916 he went first to Cork to deliver a message from Seán Mac Diarmada to Tomás Mac Curtain that the Easter Rising was due to happen on Easter Sunday, then to Cork again in a 12-hour journey in a car driven by MacNeill&#x27;s brother James to deliver Eoin MacNeill&#x27;s cancellation order, which attempted to stop the Easter Rising, but then, from when he arrived back on Tuesday, served as the medical officer in the General Post Office (GPO) and treated many wounds, including James Connolly&#x27;s shattered ankle, a wound which gradually turned gangrenous. He was, along with Connolly, one of the last people to leave the GPO when the evacuation took place. Following the surrender of the garrison Ryan was deported to HM Prison Stafford in England and subsequently Frongoch internment camp. He was released in August 1916.

Ryan rejoined the Volunteers immediately after his release from prison, and in June 1917, he was elected Commandant of the Wexford Battalion. His political career began the following year when he was elected as a Sinn Féin candidate for the constituency of Wexford South in the 1918 general election. Like his fellow Sinn Féin MPs, Ryan refused to attend the Westminster Parliament. Instead he attended the proceedings of the First Dáil on 21 January 1919. As the War of Independence went on, Ryan became Brigade Commandant of South Wexford and was also elected to Wexford County Council, serving as chairman on one occasion. In September 1919, he was arrested by the British and interned on Spike Island and later Bere Island. In February 1921, Ryan was imprisoned at Kilworth Internment Camp, County Cork. He was later moved on Ballykinlar Barracks in Co Down and released in August 1921.

In the 1922 &quot;pact election&quot; Ryan and one of the other two anti-Treaty Wexford TDs lost their seats to pro-Treaty candidates. During the Civil War, Jim Ryan was arrested and held in Mountjoy Prison before being transferred to Tintown Camp, The Curragh where he embarked on a 36-day hunger strike. Whilst interned he won back his Dáil seat as an abstentionist at the 1923 general election. He was released from prison in December 1923.

==Political career==
In 1926, Ryan was among the Sinn Féin TDs who followed leader Éamon de Valera out of the party to found Fianna Fáil. They entered the Dáil in 1927 and spent five years on the opposition benches.

===Minister for Agriculture===
Following the 1932 general election, Fianna Fáil came to office and Ryan was appointed as Minister for Agriculture, a position he would continuously hold for fifteen years. In agriculture the government&#x27;s policy was based on the idea of self-sufficiency or autarky. &quot;Irish farmers should have always been looking for prosperity from the towns of Britain. If they got people working in our own towns they would consume Irish produce,&quot; he declared at Blackwater, County Wexford calling it the idea of a cyclical arrangement.

Ryan was given the task of implementing the following policies: imports of wheat, sugar and other agricultural produce were restricted; farmers were given a guaranteed price for wheat; farmers were forced to use home-produced grain in animal feed and bakers had to use a certain percentage of Irish flour in their bread; and the sugar beet industry was expanded with the opening of new factories.

While these policies saw increases in sugar-beet production and in the growing of wheat the small farmers of Munster and Connacht gained little while the large farmers were the real beneficiaries. Ryan faced severe criticism over the Economic War with Britain: serious harm was done to the cattle trade, Ireland&#x27;s main export earner. The government tried to compensate by giving bounties equal to the British duties, however, these had to be paid for by the taxpayer. The economic war ended in 1938 with the signing of the Anglo-Irish Trade Agreement between both governments, after a series of talks in London between the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain, de Valera, Ryan and Seán Lemass.

During World War II self-sufficiency in food became essential. The Department of Agriculture ordered every farmer to till one-eighth of his land. This was raised to three-eighths in 1944. In spite of strict rationing and severe shortages, basic foodstuffs remained available. At war&#x27;s end farmers discontent emerged once again. A new political party, Clann na Talmhan, was established in the late 1930s to represent the interests of smaller farmers in the west of Ireland. Similarly, much of the country&#x27;s land had become exhausted due to increased wartime productivity and a shortage of fertilisers.

As Minister for Agriculture, Ryan was also involved the handover of Johnstown Castle estate, County Wexford in 1945. The facility became an important soil research centre initially under the Department for Agriculture and later as An Foras Talúntais (now Teagasc).

===Minister for Health and Social Welfare===
In 1947, after spending fifteen years as Minister for Agriculture, Ryan was appointed to the newly created positions of Minister for Health and Minister for Social Welfare. The minister brought the draft Health Bill to the cabinet&#x27;s attention later that year. This legislation proposed to modernise the health service into two aspects – mother and child welfare and infectious diseases. De Valera was anxious about accepting these measures as government policy due to opposition from the Catholic Church. In fact, much of the legislation was enacted by Noel Browne, Ryan&#x27;s successor as Minister from 1948 to 1951. Following Fianna Fáil&#x27;s return to power at the 1951 general election, Ryan returned as Minister for Health and Social Welfare. During his second period in office he clashed with the Church once again over the implementation of the remaining aspects of the Mother and Child Scheme. Following negotiations with the hierarchy, adjustments on such issues as means testing and medical inspections were made and the legislation was passed in the Dáil. Following the 1954 general election, Fianna Fáil lost power and Ryan moved to the backbenches once again.

===Minister for Finance===
Following the 1957 general election, Fianna Fáil were back in office and de Valera&#x27;s cabinet had a new look to it. In a clear message that there would be a change to economic policy Ryan, a close ally of Seán Lemass, was appointed Minister for Finance, replacing the conservative Seán MacEntee. The first sign of a new economic approach came in 1958, when Ryan brought the First Programme for Economic Development to the cabinet table. This plan, the brainchild of T. K. Whitaker, recognised that Ireland would have to move away from self-sufficiency towards free trade. It also proposed that foreign firms should be given grants and tax breaks to set up in Ireland.

When Seán Lemass succeeded de Valera as Taoiseach in 1959, Ryan was re-appointed as Minister for Finance. Lemass wanted to reward him for his loyalty by also naming him Tánaiste; however, the new leader felt obliged to appoint Seán MacEntee, one of the party elders to the position. Ryan continued to implement the First Programme throughout the early 1960s, achieving a record growth rate of 4 per cent by 1963. That year an even more ambitious Second Programme was introduced; however, it overreached and had to be abandoned. In spite of this, the annual growth rate averaged five per cent, the highest achieved since independence.

==Retirement and death==
Ryan did not stand in the 1965 general election, after which he was nominated by the Taoiseach to Seanad Éireann, where he joined his son, Eoin Ryan Snr. At the 1969 dissolution he retired to his farm at Kindlestown in County Wicklow, where he died at age 77 on 25 September 1970. His grandson Eoin Ryan Jnr served in the Oireachtas from 1989 to 2007 and later in the European Parliament from 2004 to 2009. His great-grandson, also called James Ryan, is a professional rugby player who has represented Ireland and Leinster.

<text>Seán Francis MacEntee (; 23 August 1889 – 9 January 1984) was an Irish Fianna Fáil politician who served as Tánaiste from 1959 to 1965, Minister for Social Welfare from 1957 to 1961, Minister for Health from 1957 to 1965, Minister for Local Government and Public Health from 1941 to 1948, Minister for Industry and Commerce from 1939 to 1941, Minister for Finance from 1932 to 1939 and 1951 to 1954. He served as a Teachta Dála (TD) from 1918 to 1969. At the time of his death, he was the last surviving member of the First Dáil.

==Early life==
Born as John McEntee at 47 King Street, Belfast on 23 August 1889, the son of James McEntee, a publican, and his wife, Mary Owens, both of whom were from Monaghan. In 1901 and 1911, the family&#x27;s address was 49 King Street. James McEntee was a prominent Nationalist member of Belfast Corporation and a close friend of Joe Devlin MP.

MacEntee was educated at St Mary&#x27;s Christian Brothers School, St Malachy&#x27;s College and the Belfast Municipal College of Technology where he qualified as an electrical engineer. His early political involvement was with the Irish Socialist Republican Party in Belfast city. He quickly rose through the ranks of the trade union movement becoming junior representative in the city&#x27;s shipyards. Following his education MacEntee worked as an engineer in Dundalk, County Louth, and was involved in the establishment of a local corps of the Irish Volunteers in the town. He mobilised in Dundalk and fought in the General Post Office Garrison in the Easter Rising in 1916. He was sentenced to death for his part in the rising. This sentence was later commuted to life imprisonment. MacEntee was released in the general amnesty in 1917 and was later elected a member of the National Executives of both Sinn Féin and the Irish Volunteers in October 1917. MacEntee was later elected Sinn Féin Member of Parliament (MP) for Monaghan South at the 1918 general election.

==Rebellion years==
An attempt to develop his career as a consulting engineer in Belfast was interrupted by the War of Independence in 1919. MacEntee served as Vice-Commandant of the Belfast Brigade of the Irish Republican Army. He was also a member of the Volunteer Executive, &quot;a sort of Cabinet and Directory for the Minister for Defence and the HQ Staff&quot; But MacEntee remained one of the few Sinn Féiners from the north. On 6 August 1920, MacEntee presented &#x27;a Memorial&#x27; lecture to the Dáil from the Belfast Corporation. He told the Dáil it was the &quot;only custodian of public order&quot;, and that a Nationalist pogrom was taking place, he advised them &quot;to fight Belfast&quot;. The Dáil government&#x27;s policy was dubbed&quot;Hibernia Irredenta&quot; or &#x27;Greening Ireland&#x27;. Sean MacEntee was asked to resign his South Monaghan seat, after voting against a bunting celebration in Lurgan to mark the signing of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.

===Path to civil war===
From April 1921, when MacEntee was transferred to Dublin to direct a special anti-partition campaign in connection with the May general election. It remained Collins&#x27;s policy, he declared, that the largely Protestant shipyard workers of Belfast were being directed by the British, urging all Irishmen to rejoin the Republic. Correspondingly the Ulster Unionist Council rejected the call for a review of the boundary commission decision made on Northern Ireland. But when Ulstermen chose James Craig as Premier, Collins denounced democracy in the north as a sham. It was on the partition of Ireland issue that MacEntee voted against the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921. During the subsequent Civil War MacEntee commanded the IRA unit in Marlboro Street Post Office in Dublin. He later fought with Cathal Brugha in the Hamman Hotel and was subsequently interned in Kilmainham and Gormanstown until December 1923.

===Politician in the Free State===
After his release from prison, MacEntee devoted himself more fully to his engineering practice, although he unsuccessfully contested Dublin County by-election of 1924. He became a founder-member of Fianna Fáil in 1926 and was eventually elected a TD for Dublin County at the 1927 general election.

MacEntee founded the Association of Patent Agents in 1929, having gained his interest in Patents when he worked as an assistant engineer in Dundalk Urban District Council. On MacEntee&#x27;s appointment as Minister for Finance in 1932, his colleague, Francis Litton who was acting as Secretary of the Association, circulated the members with a notice to the effect that the Association was &quot;suspended&quot; until MacEntee could return as he now had to devote his energies to the affairs of the State. However, the other members decided to carry on. MacEntee must have valued his status as a Patent Agent since he maintained his name on the Register for over 30 years while he held Ministerial rank in the Irish Government, although he is not thought to have taken any active part in the patent business, which was carried on by his business partners.

==In the first Fianna Fáil government (1932–1948)==
In 1932, Fianna Fáil came to power for the very first time, with MacEntee becoming Minister for Finance. In keeping with the party&#x27;s protectionist economic policies, his first budget in March of that year saw the introduction of new duties on forty-three imports, many of them coming from Britain. This saw retaliation from the British government, which in turn provoked a response from the Irish government. This was the beginning of the &quot;Economic War&quot; between the two nations, however, a treaty in 1938, signed by MacEntee and other senior members brought an end to the issue.

During the Dáil debates on the Constitution of Ireland in 1937, MacEntee described it as &#x27;the Constitution of a Catholic State&#x27;.

In 1939, World War II broke out and a cabinet reshuffle resulted in MacEntee being appointed as Minister for Industry and Commerce, taking over from his rival Seán Lemass. During his tenure at this department, MacEntee introduced the important Trade Union Act (1941). In 1941, another reshuffle of ministers took place, with MacEntee becoming Minister for Local Government and Public Health. The Health portfolio was transferred to a new Department of Health in 1947. Following the 1948 general election, Fianna Fáil returned to the opposition benches for the first time in sixteen years.

==Later Fianna Fáil governments (1951–1954, 1957–1965)==
In 1951, Fianna Fáil were back in government, although in minority status, depending on independent deputies for survival. MacEntee once again returned to the position of Minister for Finance where he felt it was vital to deal with the balance of payments deficit. He brought in a harsh budget in 1951 which raised income tax and tariffs on imports. His chief aim was to cut spending and reduce imports, however, this came at a cost as unemployment increased sharply. The increases were retained in his next two budgets in 1952 and 1953. It is often said that it was MacEntee&#x27;s performance during this period that cost Fianna Fáil the general election in 1954. The poor grasp of economics also did his political career tremendous damage as up to that point he was seen as a likely successor as Taoiseach. Now, however, Seán Lemass was firmly seen as the &quot;heir apparent&quot;.

In 1957, Fianna Fáil returned to power with an overall majority with MacEntee being appointed Minister for Health. The financial and economic portfolios were dominated by Lemass and other like-minded ministers who wanted to move away from protection to free trade. He is credited during this period with the reorganisation of the health services, the establishment of separate departments of health and social welfare, and the fluoridation of water supplies in Ireland. In 1959, MacEntee became Tánaiste when Seán Lemass was elected Taoiseach.

==Retirement and death==
Following the 1965 general election, MacEntee was 76 years old and retired from the government. This did not mean that he went quietly to the backbenches. He re-emerged in 1966 to launch a verbal attack on Seán Lemass for deciding to step down as party leader and Taoiseach. The two men, however, patched up their differences shortly afterwards. MacEntee retired from Dáil Éireann in 1969 at the age of 80, making him the oldest TD in Irish history.

He had a negative view of the Provisional IRA.

MacEntee served in the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe and repeatedly proposed amendments that would have watered down resolutions against the Greek junta (see Greek case).

MacEntee died in Dublin on 9 January 1984, at the age of 94.

==Family==
In June 1921, he married a strongly nationalistic woman from County Tipperary, Margaret Browne (1893–1976), who later taught Irish at Alexandra College and then at UCD. Among Margaret&#x27;s brothers were Cardinal Michael Browne, poet and academic Monsignor Pádraig de Brún, and author Monsignor Maurice Browne. One of Seán and Margaret&#x27;s daughters was the Irish poet Máire Mhac an tSaoi (1922 - 2021). She was married to the politician Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien until his death. Their other daughter was Barbara MacEntee-Biggar (1928–1995), who was married to Irish Ambassador Frank Biggar (1917–1974); Barbara and Frank&#x27;s eldest son is former Irish ambassador John Biggar (1952–). Barbara and Frank&#x27;s third son was Maurice Biggar (1956–2023), a &quot;young star of L&amp;H debates, diplomat, barrister, gaeilgeoir, linguist and poet&quot;. Seán and Margaret also had a son, Seamus MacEntee (1924–2000), who lived mostly in England, working as a psychiatrist, as well as being an artist painting under the name Sagesson (&quot;Sage&#x27;s son&quot; is an English translation of the name MacEntee, which is an anglicisation of the Irish Mac an tSaoi, meaning &quot;Son of the wise man&quot;).

<doc id="262830" wikidata="Q693981" url="?curid=262830" title="Translatio imperii">
<text>is a historiographical concept that was prominent in the Middle Ages in the thinking and writing of elite groups of the population in Europe, but was the reception of a concept from antiquity. In this concept the process of &quot;decline and fall&quot; of an empire theoretically is being replaced by a natural succession from one empire to another. &quot;Translatio&quot; implies that an empire metahistorically can be transferred from hand to hand and place to place, from Troy to Romans and Greeks to Franks (both remaining Romans) and further on to Spain, and has therefore survived.

In classic antiquity, an authoritative user of this scheme was Virgil, who has been traditionally ranked as one of Rome&#x27;s greatest poets. In his work &quot;Aeneid&quot;, that has been considered the national epic of ancient Rome, he linked the Rome in which he lived, reigned by its first emperor Caesar Augustus, with Troy. The discourse of translatio imperii may be traced from the ninth century to the fourteenth, and may be carried on into the sixteenth century or even further. In the Early modern period, the translatio scheme was used by many authors who wished to legitimate their new centre of power and to provide it with prestige. In Renaissance Florence, humanists wrote Latin poems fashioning their city as the new Rome, and members of the Medici family as Roman rulers.

More generally speaking, history is in this concept viewed as a linear succession of transfers of an that invests supreme power in a singular ruler, an &quot;emperor&quot;, or sometimes even several emperors, e.g., the Eastern Roman Empire and the Western Holy Roman Empire. The concept is closely linked to , the geographic movement of learning. Both terms are thought to have their origins in the second chapter of the Book of Daniel in the Hebrew Bible ().

== Definitions ==
French historian Jacques Le Goff (1924–2014) did describe the concept as &quot;typical&quot; for the Middle Ages for several reasons:

* The idea of linearity of time and history was typical for the Middle Ages;
* The idea typically also neglected simultaneous developments in other parts of the world (of no importance to medieval Europeans);
* The idea didn&#x27;t separate &quot;divine&quot; history from the history of &quot;worldly power&quot;: medieval Europeans considered divine (supernatural) and material things as part of the same continuum, which was their reality. Also the causality of one reign necessarily leading to its successor was often detailed by the medieval chroniclers, and is seen as a typical medieval approach.

To be noted is that Le Goff in saying that, did refer to a very small group of rich and prosperous people living during the Middle Ages. For the largest part of the citizens, &quot;translatio imperii&quot; was unknown.

Different medieval high-class authors described the as a succession leaving the supreme power in the hands of the monarch ruling the region of the author&#x27;s provenance:

* Adso of Montier-en-Der (French area, 10th century): Roman Empire → Carolingian Franks → Saxons
* Otto of Freising (living in German region, 1114–1158): Rome → Franks → Lombards → Germans
* Chrétien de Troyes (living in medieval France, 12th century): Greece → Rome → France
* Snorri Sturluson (Prose Edda Prologue, Iceland/Norway, ): Troy → Thrúdheim, Thrace → Norway
* Richard de Bury (England, 14th century): Athens → Rome → Paris → England
* Dante Alighieri (Florence, c. 1265 – 1321) was strongly influenced by Virgil, who linked Rome&#x27;s Caesar Augustus with Troy, most notably his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, in which Virgil appears as the author&#x27;s guide through Hell and Purgatory. Dante&#x27;s use of the Florentine dialect for this work rather than Latin, influenced the course of literary developments in Europe.
* The Laurentian poets (Florence, 15th century) were modelling Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici as a leader of Ancient Rome. This rhetorical process formed an important part of Medici propaganda, as it tried to legitimate and give prestige to his reign. The same propagandistic use of the scheme has been made on behalf of other late 15th-century rulers in Italy.
* Philotheus of Pskov (Moscow, third Rome, Rus&#x27;, c. 1510): Rome → Constantinople → Moscow
* Ibrahim Pasha (Ottoman Empire, 1523–1536) Roman Empire → Eastern Roman Empire → Seljuk Empire → Sultanate of Rum → Ottoman Empire

Later, continued and reinterpreted by modern and contemporary movements and authors (some known examples):
* Fifth Monarchists (England, 17th century): Caldeans (Babylonians) → Persians → Macedonian Empire → Rome → England (and the British Empire later)
* António Vieira (Portugal, 17th century): Assyro-Caldeans (Babylonians) → Persians → Greeks → Romans → Portuguese Empire
* Fernando Pessoa (Portugal, 20th century): Greece → Rome → Christianity → Europe → Portugal

Medieval and Renaissance authors often linked this transfer of power by genealogically attaching a ruling family to an ancient Greek or Trojan hero; this schema was modeled on Virgil&#x27;s use of Aeneas (a Trojan hero) as progenitor of the city of Rome in his &quot;Aeneid&quot;. Continuing with this tradition, the twelfth-century Anglo-Norman authors Geoffrey of Monmouth (in his ) and Wace (in his ) linked the founding of Britain to the arrival of Brutus of Troy, son of Aeneas.

In a similar way, the French Renaissance author Jean Lemaire de Belges (in his ) linked the founding of Celtic Gaul to the arrival of the Trojan Francus (i.e. Astyanax), the son of Hector; and of Celtic Germany to the arrival of Bavo, the cousin of Priam; in this way he established an illustrious genealogy for Pepin and Charlemagne (the legend of Francus would also serve as the basis for Ronsard&#x27;s epic poem, &quot;&quot;).

== From the Roman Empire/Byzantine Empire to the Holy Roman Empire ==

Famous and very successful was the use of the idea of the in establishing a link between the Western Roman Empire after its downfall in the fifth century, and the possessions ruled by ruler Charlemagne between 768 and 814. Charlemagne was King of the Franks from 768 and King of the Lombards from 774 and negotiated an agreement with Pope Leo III to be crowned as Roman emperor in 800, reviving that title in Western Central Europe more than three centuries later. The title lapsed in 924, but was revived in 962 after negotiations between Otto I and Pope John XII, where Otto had his troops positioned near Rome. As a result, the Pope accepted Otto fashioning himself as Charlemagne&#x27;s and the Carolingian Empire&#x27;s successor, and beginning a continuous existence of the empire for over eight centuries. From 962 until the 12th century, the empire was one of the most powerful monarchies in Europe, as the Holy Roman Empire.
*Emperor Constantine I established Constantinople, a New Rome, as a second capital of the Roman Empire in 330.
*After the death of Emperor Theodosius I (347–395), the Roman Empire was permanently divided into the Western and the Eastern Roman Empire
*With the demise of the Western Empire in 476/480, the Byzantine Empire became the sole Roman Empire.
*Byzantine Emperor Constantine V married his son Leo IV to Irene of Athens on 17 December 768, brought to Constantinople by the father on 1 November 768. On 14 January 771, Irene gave birth to a son, Constantine. Following the deaths of Constantine V in 775 and Leo IV in 780, Irene became regent for their nine-year-old son, Constantine VI.
*As early as 781, Irene began to seek a closer relationship with the Carolingian dynasty and the Papacy. She negotiated a marriage between her son Constantine and Rotrude, a daughter of the ruling Frankish king, Charlemagne. Irene went as far as to send an official to instruct the Frankish princess in Greek; however, Irene herself broke off the engagement in 787, against her son&#x27;s wishes. 
*As Constantine VI approached maturity, the relationship between mother/regent and son/emperor was increasingly strained. In 797, Irene deposed her son, with his eyes being mutilated, who died before 805.
*Some Western authorities considered the Byzantine throne, now occupied by a woman, to be vacant and instead recognized that Charlemagne, who controlled Italy and much part of the former Western Roman Empire, had a valid claim to the imperial title. Pope Leo III, crowned Charlemagne as Roman Emperor in 800, an act not recognized by the Byzantine Empire.
*Irene is said to have endeavored to negotiate a marriage between herself and Charlemagne, but according to Theophanes the Confessor, who alone mentioned it, the scheme was frustrated by Aetios, one of her favorites.
* In 802, Empress Irene was deposed by a conspiracy and replaced by Nikephoros I. She was exiled and died the following year.
* , a peace treaty in 803 between the Holy Roman Emperor Charlemagne and Nikephoros I, Basileus of the Eastern Roman Empire.
* Recognition of Charlemagne as Emperor (Basileus) in 812 by Emperor Michael I Rangabe of the Byzantine Empire (crowned on 2 October 811 by the Patriarch of Constantinople), after he reopened negotiations with the Franks. While acknowledging Charlemagne strictly as &quot;Emperor&quot;, Michael only referred to himself as &quot;Emperor of the Romans&quot;. In exchange for that recognition, Venice was returned to the Byzantine Empire.
* On February 2, 962, Otto I was solemnly crowned Holy Roman Emperor by Pope John XII. Ten days later at a Roman synod, Pope John XII, at Otto&#x27;s desire, founded the Archbishopric of Magdeburg and the Bishopric of Merseburg, bestowed the pallium on the Archbishop of Salzburg and Archbishop of Trier, and confirmed the appointment of Rather as Bishop of Verona. The next day, the emperor issued a decree, the , in which he confirmed the Roman Church in its possessions, particularly those granted by the Donation of Pepin. On the other hand, the Pope had to accept that Otto and his heirs would have a vote in the nomination of popes as head of the Catholic Church and the Papal States, and he and his heirs had the position to overview the enforcement of law and order in the Papal states.
* On April 972 14, Otto I married his son and heir Otto II to the Byzantine Princess Theophanu. Through their wedding contract, Otto was recognized as Emperor in the West, a title Theophanu later assumed together with her husband through the after his death.

== From the Inca Empire to the Spanish Empire ==
Sayri Túpac, second Inca of Vilcabamba, after negotiating with the viceroy Andrés Hurtado de Mendoza on January 5, 1558, in Lima ceded the rights of his crown to the King of Castile, renouncing his claims as sovereign of the Inca Empire and converting to Catholicism; in exchange, he received a pardon from the &quot;superior government&quot;, obtained titles to land and income, recognition of the primogeniture of his lineage, and obtaining the Encomienda del Valle de Yucay [Mayorazgo de Oropesa]. Later, his successor Titu Cusi Yupanqui, would ratify this transfer with the signing of the .

This application of the Translatio Imperii, for the Kingdoms of Peru, was invoked as the legitimacy tool, by the Spanish Empire, for its domain in the Viceroyalty of Peru, while, from these treaties, the incorporation of the Tahuantinsuyo in the Spanish Monarchy, with the official recognition of the , which consider the Monarchs of Spain as Kings of Peru, which would encourage the loyalty and fidelity of the (especially the royalists from the Royal Army of Peru) towards the Spanish monarchy and its promotion of miscegenation.

Given this, the Kings of Spain would be the legitimate successors of the Sapa Incas, therefore, Carlos I of Spain would be succeeding Atahualpa as Emperor of the Kingdoms of Peru, not only in fact, but also in law. Which was referenced in multiple paintings of viceregal art (especially from the School of Cuzco and the Cathedral of Lima), such as the iconic &quot;Efigies de los incas o reyes del Perú&quot;, present in the Museum of Art of Lima, in which Atahualpa bestows his Scepter of Power to the Spanish Habsburgs (marked with a cross), or the painting by Juan Núñez Vela y Ribera, in the Copacabana monastery, where reference is made to the &quot;poderosissimo Inga D. Carlos II Augustissimo Emperador de la América&quot;. Meanwhile, the King of Spain would flaunt his rights as Sapa Inca, through the title King of the West Indies, which is the sum of the rights of the Inca and Aztec crowns, which has been commemorated with the statues of the Aztec and Inca Emperors at the main entrance of the Royal Palace of Madrid.

This in turn gave guarantees to the Inca Nobility to have recognition of their titles (and traditions of their peoples) in Spanish law, considering themselves twinned with the Spanish Nobility, the indigenous nobility receiving multiple shields and privileges from the Crown. Authors like the Inca Garcilaso de la Vega would make a lot of reference to this Translatio imperii in his works.

The claims of Spanish rights in the Kingdoms of Peru is in this way: Pre-Inca Kingdoms and Andean civilizations → Incan Empire/Tahuantinsuyo → Christianity → Spanish Empire

== The Rus&#x27; land from the Middle Dnieper to Suzdalia ==

A long-standing problem in the historiography of the medieval history of Kievan Rus&#x27;, Vladimir-Suzdal and Muscovy, preceding the modern republics of Russia and Ukraine, is when usage of the term &quot;Rus&#x27; land&quot; (; ), which was initially associated with the Middle Dnieper (Dnipro) river valley around Kiev (modern Kyiv), shifted towards Vladimir-Suzdal, also known as &quot;Suzdal land&quot; or &quot;Suzdalia&quot;. There is scholarly agreement that by the late 15th century, and perhaps earlier, the Daniilovichi princes of Moscow were presenting themselves as the legitimate dynastic successors to Kievan Rus&#x27;, and the true representatives of the &quot;Rus&#x27; land&quot;. The question is how much earlier this can be dated, because the evidence is ambiguous. In 2016, Charles J. Halperin summarised the scholarly debate so far: 
Several scholars including Halperin previously used the 1950 Priselkov reconstruction of the &quot;Trinity Chronicle&quot; as evidence to date the (variously from the 1320s to the mid-14th century), but – by 2001 – Halperin changed his position (confirmed in 2010 after Serhii Plokhy (2006) explored the question) due to the unreliability of Priselkov&#x27;s reconstruction. In his 2022 updated bundle of all previous articles about the Rus&#x27; land (published at Plokhy&#x27;s suggestion), Halperin posited that the last time &quot;Rus&#x27; land&quot; meant the region around Kiev was in , when the &quot;Tale of the Destruction of the Rus&#x27; Land&quot; was written (probably in Kiev) during the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27;. Conversely, by , at the accession of Ivan I Kalita as Prince of Moscow in 1340, &quot;the of the Rus&#x27; Land to the Muscovite principality itself, or at the very least to the Northeast, was a .&quot; Plokhy (2006) had argued this was too early, and the could not have taken place before the mid-15th century due to Donald Ostrowski in 1998 re-dating of the works of the Kulikovo cycle to after the 1440s, which Halperin (1999) rejected. Instead, Plokhy suggested tracing it to the Muscovite Codex of 1472, wherein an entry 1471 &quot;may be regarded as one of the first expressions of the theory that postulated the transfer of power in the Rus&#x27; lands from Kyiv to Vladimir on the Kliazma and then to Moscow.&quot;

<text>Miami Vice is an American crime drama television series created by Anthony Yerkovich and produced by Michael Mann for NBC. The series stars Don Johnson as James &quot;Sonny&quot; Crockett and Philip Michael Thomas as Ricardo &quot;Rico&quot; Tubbs, two Metro-Dade Police Department detectives working undercover in Miami, Florida. The series ran for five seasons on NBC from September 16, 1984 to June 28, 1989. USA Network began airing reruns in 1988 and broadcast a previously unaired episode during its syndication run of the series on January 25, 1990.

Unlike standard police procedurals, the show drew heavily upon 1980s New Wave culture and is noted for its integration of contemporary pop and rock music, and stylish or stylized visuals. &quot;People&quot; magazine states that &quot;Miami Vice&quot; was the &quot;first show to look really new and different since color TV was invented&quot;.

Mann also directed a modernized film adaptation based on the series, which was released in July 2006.

==Conception==
The conception of the show is unclear. One version of events states that the head of NBC&#x27;s Entertainment Division, Brandon Tartikoff, wrote a brainstorming memo that simply read &quot;MTV cops&quot;, and later presented it to series creator Anthony Yerkovich, formerly a writer and producer for &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot;. Yerkovich, however, has indicated he devised the concept after learning about asset forfeiture statutes allowing law enforcement agencies to confiscate the property of drug dealers for official use. The initial idea was for a movie about a pair of vice cops in Miami. Yerkovich then wrote a script for a two-hour pilot, titled &quot;Gold Coast&quot;, but later renamed it &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Yerkovich was immediately drawn to South Florida as a setting for his new-style police show.

==Production==
In keeping with the show&#x27;s title, most episodes focus on combating drug trafficking and prostitution. Episodes often end in an intense gun battle, claiming the lives of several criminals before they can be apprehended. An undercurrent of cynicism and futility underlies the entire series. The detectives repeatedly refer to the &quot;Whac-A-Mole&quot; nature of drug interdiction, with its parade of drug cartels quickly replacing those that are apprehended. Co-executive producer Yerkovich explained:

The choice of music and cinematography borrowed heavily from the emerging New Wave culture of the 1980s. As such, segments of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; sometimes used music-based stanzas, a technique later featured in &quot;Baywatch&quot;. As Lee H. Katzin, one of the show&#x27;s directors, remarked, &quot;The show is written for an MTV audience, which is more interested in images, emotions and energy than plot and character and words.&quot; These elements made the series into an instant hit, and in its first season saw an unprecedented fifteen Emmy Award nominations. While the first few episodes contain elements of a standard police procedural, the producers soon abandoned them in favor of a more distinctive style. Influenced by an Art Deco revival, no &quot;earth tones&quot; were allowed to be used in the production by executive producer Michael Mann. A director of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, Bobby Roth, recalled:

&quot;Miami Vice&quot; was one of the first American network television programs to be broadcast in stereophonic sound. It is mixed in stereo for its entire run. Each episode of the series cost $2 million.

===Casting===
Nick Nolte and Jeff Bridges were considered for the role of Sonny Crockett, but since it was not lucrative for film stars to venture into television at the time, other candidates were considered. Mickey Rourke was also considered for the role, but he turned down the offer. Larry Wilcox, of &quot;CHiPs&quot;, was also a candidate for the role of Crockett, but the producers felt going from one police officer role to another would not be a good fit. After dozens of candidates and a twice-delayed pilot shooting, Don Johnson and Philip Michael Thomas were chosen as the vice cops. For Johnson, who was by then 34 years old, NBC had particular doubts about the several earlier unsuccessful pilots in which he starred. Jimmy Smits played Eddie Rivera, Crockett&#x27;s ill-fated partner, in the pilot episode.

After two seasons, Don Johnson threatened to walk from the series as part of a highly publicized contract dispute. The network was ready to replace him with Mark Harmon, who had recently departed &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, but the network and Johnson were able to resolve their differences and he continued with the series until its end.

===Locations===
Despite the Miami setting, the producers initially planned to film the series in Los Angeles. However, by the time production began, the decision had been made to shoot in Miami itself. Many episodes of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; were filmed in the South Beach section of Miami Beach, an area which, at the time, was blighted by poverty and crime, with its demographic so deteriorated that there &quot;simply weren&#x27;t many people on the street. Ocean Drive&#x27;s hotels were filled with elderly, mostly Jewish retirees, many of them frail, subsisting on meager Social Security payments. ... They were filming all over Miami Beach. ... They could film in the middle of the street. There was literally nobody there. There were no cars parked in the street&quot;. In early episodes in particular, local elderly residents were frequently cast as extras.

Some street corners of South Beach were so run down that the production crew actually decided to repaint the exterior walls of some buildings before filming. The crew went to great lengths to find the correct settings and props. Bobby Roth recalled, &quot;I found this house that was really perfect, but the color was sort of beige. The art department instantly paints the house gray for me. Even on feature films people try to deliver what is necessary but no more. At &quot;Miami Vice&quot; they start with what&#x27;s necessary and go beyond it.&quot;

&quot;Miami Vice&quot; is to some degree credited with causing a wave of support for the preservation of Miami&#x27;s famous Art Deco architecture in the mid-1980s to early 1990s; and many of those buildings, among them many beachfront hotels, have been renovated since filming, making that part of South Beach one of South Florida&#x27;s most popular places for tourists and celebrities.

Other places commonly filmed in the series include locations around Broward and Palm Beach counties.

Interior scenes were initially supposed to be filmed at Universal Studios in Los Angeles, but to simplify cross-country logistics, the decision was made to use the facilities of Greenwich Studios in North Miami instead, and only carry out post-production in Los Angeles. In a few scenes, particularly in earlier episodes, Greenwich Studios&#x27; rear loading dock is repeatedly used as the back room of the Gold Coast Shipping building, where the offices of the vice squad are located.

===Music===

&quot;Miami Vice&quot; is noted for its innovative use of stereo broadcast music, particularly pop and rock hits of the 1980s, and the distinctive, synthesized instrumental music of Jan Hammer. While other television shows used made-for-TV music, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; would spend $10,000 or more per episode to buy the rights to original recordings. Getting a song played on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; was a boost to record labels and artists. Some newspapers, such as &quot;USA Today&quot;, would let readers know the songs that would be featured each week. Among the many well-known bands and artists, as well as underground or &#x27;new wave&#x27; associated acts, who contributed their music to the show were: 

Several artists guest-star in episodes, including Leonard Cohen, Phil Collins, Miles Davis, the Power Station, Glenn Frey, Suicidal Tendencies, Willie Nelson, Ted Nugent, Frank Zappa, the Fat Boys, Sheena Easton, Gloria Estefan, and Gene Simmons. An iconic scene from the &quot;Miami Vice&quot; oeuvre involves Crockett and Tubbs driving through Miami at night to Phil Collins&#x27; song &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;.

Jan Hammer credits executive producer Michael Mann with allowing him great creative freedom in scoring &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Hammer later recalled in interviews that Michael Mann told him that as soon as the show&#x27;s production would start, Mann wanted him to &quot;run with it&quot;. 
The collaboration resulted in memorable instrumental pieces, including the show&#x27;s title theme, which climbed to the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; charts in November 1985.

The &quot;Miami Vice&quot; original soundtrack, featuring the theme song and Glenn Frey&#x27;s &quot;Smuggler&#x27;s Blues&quot; and &quot;You Belong to the City&quot; (a No. 2 hit), remained at the top of the U.S. album chart for 11 weeks in 1985, making it the most successful TV soundtrack at the time. The theme song was so popular that it also garnered two Grammy Awards in 1986. It was also voted the number-one theme song of all time by &quot;TV Guide&quot; readers. &quot;Crockett&#x27;s Theme&quot;, another recurring tune from the show, became a No. 1 hit in several European countries in 1987.

During the show&#x27;s run, three official soundtrack albums with original music from the episodes were released. Hammer also released several albums with music from the series; among them are &quot;Escape from Television&quot; (1987), &quot;Snapshots&quot; (1989), and after many requests from fans, &quot;Miami Vice: The Complete Collection&quot; (2002).

===Fashion===
The clothes worn on &quot;Miami Vice&quot; had a significant influence on men&#x27;s fashion. They popularized, if not invented, the &quot;T-shirt under Armani jacket&quot;–style, and popularized Italian men&#x27;s fashion in the United States. Don Johnson&#x27;s typical attire of Italian sport coat, T-shirt, white linen pants, and slip-on sockless loafers became a hit. Crockett initially wore an 18k Rolex Day-Date &quot;President&quot; model in the first season, until Ebel won the contract for the remaining seasons. Similarly, Crockett&#x27;s perpetually unshaven appearance sparked a minor fashion trend, inspiring men to wear designer stubble at all times. In an average episode, Crockett and Tubbs wore five to eight outfits, appearing in shades of pink, blue, green, peach, fuchsia, and the show&#x27;s other &quot;approved&quot; colors. Designers such as Vittorio Ricci, Gianni Versace, and Hugo Boss were consulted in keeping the male leads looking trendy. Costume designer Bambi Breakstone, who traveled to Milan, Paris, and London in search of new clothes, said that, &quot;The concept of the show is to be on top of all the latest fashion trends in Europe.&quot; Jodi Tillen, the costume designer for the first season, along with Michael Mann, set the style. The abundance of pastel colors on the show reflects Miami&#x27;s Art-deco architecture.

During its five-year run, consumer demand for unstructured blazers, shiny fabric jackets, and lighter pastels increased. After Six formal wear even created a line of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; dinner jackets, Kenneth Cole introduced &quot;Crockett&quot; and &quot;Tubbs&quot; shoes, and Macy&#x27;s opened a &quot;Miami Vice&quot; section in its young men&#x27;s department. Crockett also boosted Ray Ban&#x27;s popularity by wearing a pair of Model L2052, Ray-Ban Wayfarers, which increased sales of Ray Bans to 720,000 units in 1984. In the spring of 1986, an electric razor became available named the &quot;Stubble Device&quot;, allowing users to have a beard like Don Johnson&#x27;s character. It was initially named the &quot;Miami Device&quot; by Wahl, but in the end the company opted to avoid a trademark infringement lawsuit. Many of the styles popularized by the TV show, such as the T-shirt under pastel suits, no socks, rolled up sleeves, and Ray-Ban sunglasses, have become the standard image of 1980s culture. The influence of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;s fashions continued into the early 1990s and, to some extent, has had a lasting impact.

===Firearms===

&quot;Miami Vice&quot; also popularized certain brands of firearms and accessories. After Johnson became dissatisfied with his gun holster, the Jackass Leather Company (later renamed Galco International) sent their president, Rick Gallagher, to personally fit Don Johnson with an &quot;Original Jackass Rig&quot;, later renamed the Galco &quot;Miami Classic&quot;.

The Bren Ten, manufactured by Dornaus &amp; Dixon, was a stainless steel handgun used by Don Johnson during &quot;Miami Vice&#x27;s&quot; first two seasons. Dornaus &amp; Dixon went out of business in 1986, and Smith &amp; Wesson was offered a contract to outfit Johnson&#x27;s character with a S&amp;W Model 645 during season three.

Several firearms never before seen on TV were featured prominently for the first time in the show, including the Glock 17 pistol. In addition, firearms not yet well known to the public, including the Steyr AUG, MAC-10 and the Desert Eagle, were showcased to a wide audience on this show. Even heavy guns came to use, as Zito is seen maneuvering an M60 machine gun from a rooftop in the episode &quot;Lombard&quot;.

===Cars===

Two automobiles drew a lot of attention in &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, the Ferrari Daytona and Testarossa. During the first two seasons and two episodes of the third season, Detective Sonny Crockett drove a black 1972 Ferrari Daytona Spyder 365 GTS/4 kit replica built on a Chevrolet Corvette C3 chassis. The car was fitted with Ferrari-shaped body panels by specialty car manufacturer McBurnie Coachcraft. Once the car gained notoriety, Ferrari Automobili filed suit demanding that McBurnie and any others cease and desist producing and selling Ferrari replicas and infringing upon the Ferrari name and styling. As a result, the Daytona lasted until season 2, at which point it was &quot;blown up&quot; in the season three premiere episode, &quot;When Irish Eyes Are Crying&quot;. Neither the kit car nor its backup were actually destroyed, as the production company simply blew up a small, plastic model for both cost and safety reasons. The fake Ferraris were removed from the show, with Ferrari donating two brand new 1986 Testarossas as replacements. The Ferrari Daytona is the subject of a huge continuity error on the show, when it suddenly reappears in &quot;El Viejo&quot;, six episodes after its destruction, without explanation. Originally &quot;El Viejo&quot; was set to be the third season premiere, but studio executives felt the Daytona&#x27;s destruction would serve as a more dramatic opening to the season. Don Johnson&#x27;s contract holdout at the start of the season also played a part, delaying filming to the point where &quot;El Viejo&quot; could not finish in time for the season premiere.

The series&#x27; crew also used a third Testarossa lookalike, which was the stunt car. Carl Roberts, who had worked on the Daytona kit cars, offered to build the stunt car. Roberts decided to use a 1972 De Tomaso Pantera, which had the same wheelbase as the Testarossa and thus was perfect for the body pieces. The vehicle was modified to withstand daily usage on set, and continued to be driven until the series ended.

Crockett was also seen driving a black 1978 Porsche 911 SC Targa in a flashback to 1980 in the Season 3 episode &quot;Forgive Us Our Debts.&quot;

Crockett&#x27;s partner, Ricardo Tubbs, drove a 1964 Cadillac Coupe de Ville Convertible. Stan Switek drove a turquoise 1961 Ford Thunderbird. Gina Calabrese drove a 1971 Mercury Cougar XR-7 convertible. When Stan and Larry were undercover, they drove a Dodge Ram Van. Other notable vehicles that appear in &quot;Miami Vice&quot; include Lamborghinis, AMG Mercedes-Benzes, BMWs, Maseratis, Lotuses, DeLoreans, Porsches, and Corvettes. American muscle cars, such as the Pontiac GTO and Firebird Trans Am, Ford Mustang, Chevrolet Camaro, Plymouth GTX and Barracuda, Chevrolet Monte Carlo SS, and the Buick Grand National also made appearances.

===Boats and seaplanes===
Throughout the series, Sonny Crockett lived on an Endeavour sailboat, &quot;St. Vitus&#x27; Dance&quot;, while in the pilot episode, Crockett is seen on a 38-foot Cabo Rico sailboat. In season 1, he is seen living on an Endeavour 40 sailboat, while in the rest of the series (seasons 2 to 5) he is seen living on an Endeavour 42 sailboat (priced at $120,000 in 1986). The allure of the sailboats was such that the Endeavour 42 used for the 1986 season of &quot;Miami Vice&quot; was sold to a midwest couple, while the Endeavour 40, was sold to a chartering service in Fort Lauderdale. At the same time, Endeavour was building a new 42 for the 1987 season of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;.

In the pilot episode, and for the first season, Crockett piloted a Chris-Craft Stinger 390 X – a 39-foot deep-v offshore racing boat. For the other four Stingers, Chris-Craft showed the production crew a color scheme that included the red – however, since Michael Mann decided that the color red was to never show up on the show, a blue color scheme was chosen instead. The Stingers used on the show were not free from Chris-Craft. This situation caused the production team to switch to using Wellcraft 38 Scarab KVs for the remainder of the show. The Scarab 38 KVs were a 28-hued, twin 440-hp boat that sold for $130,000 in 1986.

As a result of the attention the Scarab 38 KV garnered on &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, Wellcraft received &quot;an onslaught of orders&quot;, increasing sales by 21% in one year. In appreciation, Wellcraft gave Don Johnson an exact duplicate of the boat. Afterward, Johnson was frequently seen arriving to work in it. Altogether, 100 copies of the boat , dubbed the Scarab 38KV Miami Vice Edition, were built by Wellcraft. The &quot;Miami Vice&quot; graphics and color scheme, which include turquoise, aqua, and orchid, was available by special order on any model Scarab from 20 to 38 feet.

Don Johnson also participated in the design of the Scarab Excel 43 ft, Don Johnson Signature Series (DJSS), and raced a similar one. The DJSS was powered by twin 650-hp Lamborghini V-12 engines, which caused some problems to the design of the boat due to their size. Overall the boat cost $300,000 with each engine amounting to between $60–$70,000. His interest in boat racing eventually led Johnson to start his own offshore powerboat racing team, named &quot;Team USA&quot;. Joining him were Hollywood stars including Kurt Russell and Chuck Norris. Johnson won the Offshore World Cup in 1988 and continued racing into the 1990s.

In the show&#x27;s opening credits, along with both the pilot episode, &quot;Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, and the season 4 episode, &quot;Baseballs of Death&quot;, a Grumman Turbo Mallard (G-73T) amphibious airplane (registration # N2969), operated by Chalk&#x27;s International Airlines made appearances. In the pilot episode, the drug dealer Calderone used N2969 to successfully escape from Crockett and Tubbs at the climax of the episode. In the latter episode, Guerrero made an attempt to escape from the vice team in N2969 but ran out of fuel and was killed after he stole a fisherman&#x27;s boat which then ran ashore and exploded. In December 2005, N2969 suffered a catastrophic structural failure when the right wing separated from the fuselage as the plane climbed out of Miami bound for the Bahamas. Both crew members and all 18 passengers were killed upon impact with the water.

==Episodes==

===Overview===
Scripts were loosely based on actual crimes that occurred in Miami over the years. This included both local, international, and global organized crime. Many episodes focused on drug trafficking (for which real-life Miami was a main hub and entrance point into North America in the early 1980s). Other episodes were based on crimes such as firearms trafficking, for which Miami was equally a gateway for sales to Latin America, as well as the Miami River Cops scandal (a real police corruption ring that involved narcotic thefts, drug dealing and murders), street prostitution, serial home burglaries, crimes committed by Cuban immigrants to Miami following the Mariel boatlift, and yakuza and Mafia activity in Miami. The series also took a look at political issues such as the Northern Ireland conflict, the drug war in South America (e.g. &quot;Prodigal Son&quot;), U.S. support of generals and dictators in Southeast Asia and South America, and the aftermath of the Vietnam War. Social issues like child abuse, homophobia, and the AIDS crisis were also covered.

Personal issues also arose: Crockett separated from his wife Caroline (Belinda Montgomery) in the pilot and divorced in the fourth episode, and later his second wife Caitlin Davies (Sheena Easton) was killed by one of his enemies. In the three episodes &quot;Mirror Image&quot;, &quot;Hostile Takeover&quot;, and &quot;Redemption in Blood&quot;, a concussion caused by an explosion caused Crockett to believe he was his undercover alter ego Sonny Burnett, a drug dealer. Tubbs had a running, partly personal vendetta with the Calderone family, a member of which ordered the death of his brother Rafael, a New York City Police detective. Lieutenant Martin Castillo is also frequently haunted by his past in Southeast Asia, which he had spent as a DEA agent in the Golden Triangle.
In the first seasons the tone was lighter, especially when comical characters such as police informants Noogie Lamont (Charlie Barnett) and Izzy Moreno (Martin Ferrero) appeared. Later the content was darker and cynical, with Crockett and Tubbs fighting corruption, and storylines emphasizing the aspect of human tragedy behind a crime. The darker episodes sometimes lacked a denouement, each episode ending abruptly after a climax involving violence and death, often giving the episodes a despairing and sometimes nihilistic feel, despite the trademark glamour and conspicuous wealth.

Given its idiosyncratic &quot;dark&quot; feel and touch, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; is frequently cited as an example of made-for-TV neo-noir. Michael Mann, who serves as executive producer for the majority of the show&#x27;s five-year run, is often credited with being one of the most influential neo-noir directors. The second-season episode &quot;Out Where the Buses Don&#x27;t Run&quot; ranks #90 on &quot;TV Guide&quot;″s 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time list.

===Changes===
During its five-year run, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; underwent several noticeable changes in its formula and content. Between seasons one and two, however, these changes were mostly subtle and involved details such as the degree of perfection with which color shades of scene backdrops, props and clothing are matched to each other.

For its third season in 1986–87 after the cancellation of &quot;Knight Rider&quot;, the show moved from its traditional time slot of 10pm on Friday nights to 9pm, which now put it up against perennial Top 10 show &quot;Dallas&quot;. This began the show&#x27;s decline, and in March, 1987, &quot;TV Guide&quot; ran a cover story entitled, &quot;Dallas Drubs the Cops: Why Miami Vice Seems to be Slipping.&quot; &quot;Miami Vice&quot;″s season ratings slipped from #9 in Season 2 down to #27 by the end of Season 3.

Before leaving the series to work on his new television series, &quot;Crime Story&quot;, Michael Mann handed the role of executive producer to future &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; creator Dick Wolf prior to the third season (1986–1987). Wolf had the show focus on contemporary issues like the Troubles in Northern Ireland and capital punishment.

In addition to losing the battle against new timeslot rival &quot;Dallas,&quot; the general tone of season 3 episodes started to become more serious and less lighthearted than in previous seasons. Comedic scenes and subplots became distinctly rare. True to Dick Wolf&#x27;s &quot;grabbed from the headlines&quot; approach which he later employed in TV series like &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot;, storylines focused more on the serious human aspect of crime than on glamorizing the tropical lifestyles of drug dealers and other high-profile criminals. This shift in tone also reflected in the series&#x27; fashions, color schemes, and its choice of music. The cast started wearing pronouncedly dark clothing and even earthtones, which had famously been avoided by executive producer Michael Mann in seasons one and two. Color palettes of scene backdrops started becoming much darker as well, with pastels replaced by harsher-appearing shades of neon. Whereas seasons one and two always featured a diverse selection of contemporary, mostly &quot;upbeat&quot; chart music and classic rock and pop, the third season&#x27;s music lineup became much more somber, with songs like &quot;In Dulce Decorum&quot; by The Damned, &quot;Lives in the Balance&quot; by Jackson Browne, &quot;Mercy&quot; by Steve Jones, and &quot;Never Let Me Down Again (Aggro Mix)&quot; by Depeche Mode. All these changes were decidedly unwelcome, both by critics and by many viewers who had become fans of the TV series, due to the package that the first two seasons delivered. It caused the producers to retool their approach to &quot;Miami Vice&quot; for the following fourth season.

By Season 4, most of the original writers had left the series. Stories and story arcs included a courtship and marriage between Sonny Crockett (Don Johnson) and Caitlin Davies (Sheena Easton), and a plot in which Crockett developed amnesia, during which he mistook himself for his drug dealer alter ego and became a hitman. Caroline Crockett, Sonny&#x27;s first wife, as well as his son Billy reappeared briefly.

Jan Hammer departed from the series at the end of the fourth season, having already handed much of the weekly scoring workload during the season over to John Petersen. The tone of many season 4 episodes grew lighter again, albeit sometimes veering off into the bizarre, e.g. episodes like &quot;The Big Thaw&quot;, &quot;Missing Hours&quot;, and &quot;The Cows of October&quot;. Fashions and scene backdrops largely reassumed the pastel hues of seasons 1 and 2, and the choice of music became more varied again. Hopes by the producers of propitiating former and remaining fans this way only materializing very mutedly, and reception was lukewarm, as evidenced by the show&#x27;s still declining ratings during season four.

The fifth season (1988–1989) saw the show return to its original timeslot, 10pm on Friday nights and took the show on a yet more serious tone, with storylines becoming dark and gritty – enough so that even some of the most loyal fans were left perplexed. Some of the lack of script quality could be attributed to the Writers Guild strike throughout spring and summer of 1988, which ended just before filming of season 5 began, but greatly impacted its preparation. Tim Truman took over scoring the episodes for the remainder of the series&#x27; run and brought with him a style of instrumental synthesizer music that was markedly different from Jan Hammer&#x27;s.

===Cancellation===
After still-declining ratings during the fourth season, NBC originally planned to order just a shortened fifth season of only 13 episodes, but eventually settled for another full run, which was, either way, going to be the final season. At the beginning of season five, Olivia Brown recalled, &quot;The show was trying to reinvent itself.&quot; Dick Wolf said in an interview for &quot;E! True Hollywood Story&quot;, after the fifth season, it was all just &quot;...kind of over&quot;, and that the show had &quot;run its course&quot;.

In May 1989, NBC aired the two-hour series finale, &quot;Freefall&quot;. Despite its status as the &quot;series finale&quot;, there were three episodes that did not air (&quot;World of Trouble&quot;, &quot;Miracle Man&quot;, and &quot;Leap of Faith&quot;), which appeared during the June re-runs as &quot;Lost Episodes&quot;. A fourth, previously unaired episode, &quot;Too Much Too Late&quot;, was aired for the first time in 1990, on the &quot;USA Network&quot;. It has since been run by other networks in syndication with the fifth season episodes.

==Cast==


===Main characters===
*Don Johnson as Detective James &quot;Sonny&quot; Crockett: An undercover detective of the Metro-Dade Police Department. A former Florida Gators star wide receiver, he sustained a knee injury which put an end to his sports career. He served two tours in Vietnam – or as he calls it, the &quot;Southeast Asia Conference&quot;. He joined Metro-Dade as a uniformed patrol officer and later an undercover detective of the vice unit. Crockett&#x27;s alias is Sonny Burnett, a drug runner and middleman. His vehicles include a Ferrari Daytona Spyder (later a Ferrari Testarossa), a &quot;Scarab&quot; offshore power boat, and a sailboat on which he lives with his pet alligator Elvis. The name &quot;Sonny Crockett&quot; had previously been used for a criminal played by actor Dennis Burkley on &quot;Hill Street Blues&quot; in 1983, where creator Anthony Yerkovich was a writer. Coincidentally, Gregory Sierra who later plays Crockett&#x27;s boss on &quot;Vice&quot; appears in the same episodes.
*Philip Michael Thomas as Detective Ricardo &quot;Rico&quot; Tubbs: A former New York Police Department detective who traveled to Miami as part of a personal vendetta against Calderone, the man who murdered his brother Rafael. After temporarily teaming up with Crockett, Tubbs follows his friend&#x27;s advice and transfers to &quot;a career in Southern law enforcement&quot;, fearing that after his serious violations of NYPD codes of conduct in the pilot episode, he would not be able to resume his job in New York. He joins the Miami department and becomes Crockett&#x27;s permanent partner. He often poses as Rico Cooper, a wealthy buyer from out of town.
*Edward James Olmos as Lieutenant Martin &quot;Marty&quot; Castillo: He replaces the slain Rodriguez as head of the OCB. A very taciturn man, Castillo lives a reclusive life outside of work.

===Critical response===

The series initially attracted controversy and polarized reactions; detractors objected to the show&#x27;s usage of violence by dressing it with pretty photography, and others accused the show of relying more on visual aspects and music than on coherent stories and fully drawn characters. Civic leaders in Miami have also objected to the show&#x27;s airing of the city&#x27;s crime problems all across America. Most civic leaders, however, were placated due to the show&#x27;s estimated contribution of $1 million per episode to the city&#x27;s economy and because it boosted tourism to Miami. Gerald S. Arenberg of the National Association of Chiefs of Police criticized the show&#x27;s glamorous depiction of vice squads, saying &quot;no real vice cops chase drug dealers in a Ferrari while wearing $600 suits. More often than not, they&#x27;re holed up in a crummy room somewhere, wearing jeans with holes in them, watching some beat-up warehouse in a godforsaken part of town through a pair of dented binoculars&quot;.

At the 1985 Emmy Awards &quot;Miami Vice&quot; was nominated for 15 Emmy Awards, including &quot;Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Film Editing&quot;, &quot;Outstanding Achievement for Music Composition for a series (dramatic underscore)&quot;, and &quot;Outstanding Directing&quot;. At the end of the night, &quot;Miami Vice&quot; only won four Emmys. The following day, the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Examiner&quot; concluded that more conservative Emmy voters rejected the show&#x27;s portrayal of hedonism, violence, sex, and drugs.

The show&#x27;s reputation has grown over time. Television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoller Seitz ranked &quot;Miami Vice&quot; as the 51st greatest American television series of all time in their 2016 book titled &quot;TV (The Book)&quot;, with Seitz stating how the show was more influenced by 1960s art house cinema from Europe than by any other contemporary television drama: &quot;&quot;Miami Vice&quot; superimposed &#x27;ripped-from-the-headlines&#x27; details about drug smuggling, arms dealing, and covert war onto a pastel noir dreamscape. It gave American TV its first visionary existential drama&quot;.

===Impact on popular culture===

&quot;Miami Vice&quot; was a groundbreaking police program of the 1980s. It had a notable impact on the decade&#x27;s popular fashions and set the tone for the evolution of police drama. Series such as &quot;&quot;, &quot;NYPD Blue&quot;, and the &quot;Law &amp; Order (franchise)&quot;, though being markedly different in style and theme from &quot;Miami Vice&quot;, follows its lead in breaking the genre&#x27;s mold; Dick Wolf, creator and executive producer of the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; franchise, was a writer and later executive producer of &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. Parodies and pastiches of it have continued decades after it airs, such as the &quot;Only Fools and Horses&quot; Christmas episode &quot;Miami Twice&quot; (1991) and &quot;Moonbeam City&quot; (2015).

The video game &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City,&quot; published by Rockstar Games in 2002, is heavily inspired by &quot;Miami Vice&quot; in multiple ways. It is set in a stylized 1980s Miami-inspired fictional city named &quot;Vice City&quot;. One of the main characters, Lance Vance, was voiced by Philip Michael Thomas. &quot;Crockett&#x27;s Theme&quot; is featured on the Emotion 98.3 in-game radio station. Two undercover police officers chosen from a selection of six character models appear in a police sports car within the game when the player obtains a three-star wanted level. These six officers resemble characters from &quot;Miami Vice.&quot; In the prequel, &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot;, there are two officers in the multiplayer mode named Cracker and Butts, an apparent parody of Crockett and Tubbs; their character models are also used for the undercover police squad.

Many of the fashion styles and trends popularized by the TV show, such as fast cars and speed boats, unshaven beard stubble, a T-shirt under pastel suits, no socks, rolled up sleeves, boat shoes and Ray Ban sunglasses symbolize the stereotypical image of 1980s fashion and culture.

The show also had a lasting impact on Miami itself. It drew a large amount of media attention to the beginning revitalization of the South Beach and Art Deco District areas of Miami Beach, as well as other portions of Greater Miami, and increases tourism and investment. Even 30 years after &quot;Miami Vice&quot; first airs, it is still responsible for its share of tourist visits to the city. The fact that Crockett and Tubbs were Dade County officers and not City of Miami police represents the growing notion of metro government in Miami. In 1997, a county referendum changed the name from Dade County to Miami-Dade County. This allows people to relate the county government to recognize notions and images of Miami, many of which were first popularized by &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. The Dade County Sheriff&#x27;s Office became the Miami-Dade Sheriff&#x27;s Office.

==Home media==
Universal Studios has released all &quot;Miami Vice&quot; seasons on DVD for regions 1, 2, and 4. Seasons 1 &amp; 2 were released in 2005, and seasons 3 through 5 were released in 2007. The DVD release of the series had been significantly slow due to one of the signature features of the show: the heavy integration of 1980s pop and rock music. The music was difficult to source the rights to and acquire permission to use. (On at least one MCA/Universal Home Video VHS release of the pilot, The Rolling Stones&#x27; song &quot;Miss You&quot; had been replaced by generic rock music.) In the November 2004 announcement for the DVD release of the series, Universal promises that all original music in the series would be intact. On August 21, 2007 Universal announces the November 13, 2007 release of the complete series, with all five seasons on 27 single-sided DVDs. The seasons are in their own Digipak-style cases, and the set is housed in a faux alligator-skin package. Seasons 1 &amp; 2 contained six single-sided discs, rather than the three double-sided discs in the initial release. The Region 2 version has different packaging, does not use double-sided discs, and although there are no special features stated on the packaging they are contained within the season 1 discs.

On March 8, 2016, it is announced that Mill Creek Entertainment had acquired the rights to the series in Region 1; they subsequently re-released the first two seasons on DVD on May 3, 2016.

On October 4, 2016, Mill Creek re-released &quot;Miami Vice – The Complete Series&quot; on DVD and also released the complete series on Blu-ray.

<doc id="262837" wikidata="Q965926" url="?curid=262837" title="Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)">
<text>&quot;Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown)&quot;, otherwise known as simply &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, is a song by the English rock band the Beatles from their 1965 album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. It was written mainly by John Lennon, with lyrical contributions from Paul McCartney, and credited to the Lennon–McCartney songwriting partnership. Influenced by the introspective lyrics of Bob Dylan, the song is considered a milestone in the Beatles&#x27; development as songwriters. The track features a sitar part, played by lead guitarist George Harrison, that marked the first appearance of the Indian string instrument on a Western rock recording. The song was a number 1 hit in Australia when released on a single there in 1966, coupled with &quot;Nowhere Man&quot;.

Lennon wrote the song as a veiled account of an extramarital affair he had in London. When recording the track, Harrison was asked by Lennon to add a sitar part to the song. Harrison had become interested in the instrument&#x27;s exotic sound while on the set of the Beatles&#x27; film &quot;Help!&quot;, in early 1965. &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was influential in the development of raga rock and psychedelic rock during the mid-1960s. The song also helped elevate Ravi Shankar and Indian classical music to mainstream popularity in the West. Many other rock and pop artists, including the Byrds, the Rolling Stones and Donovan, began integrating elements of the genre into their musical approach. &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is also recognised as a key work in the early evolution of world music.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; number 83 on its 2004 list of &quot;The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;.

==Background and composition==
The song&#x27;s lyrics are about an extramarital affair that John Lennon was involved in, as hinted in the opening couplet: &quot;I once had a girl, or should I say, she once had me.&quot; Although Lennon never revealed with whom he had the affair, writer Philip Norman speculates that it was either Lennon&#x27;s close friend and journalist Maureen Cleave or Sonny Freeman. Paul McCartney explained that the term &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was an ironic reference to the cheap pine wall panelling then in vogue in London. McCartney commented on the final verse of the song: &quot;In our world the guy had to have some sort of revenge. It could have meant I lit a fire to keep myself warm, and wasn&#x27;t the decor of her house wonderful? But it didn&#x27;t, it meant I burned the fucking place down as an act of revenge, and then we left it there and went into the instrumental.&quot;

According to Lennon in 1970, &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was his creation, with McCartney assisting on the middle eight. In 1980, Lennon changed his claim, saying it was &quot;my song completely&quot;. Since Lennon&#x27;s death, however, McCartney has contended that Lennon brought the opening couplet to one of their joint songwriting sessions, and that they finished the song together, with the middle eight and the title (and the &quot;fire&quot;) being among McCartney&#x27;s contributions. McCartney&#x27;s statement about the level of his involvement was one of the controversial claims he made in his 1997 authorised biography, &quot;Many Years from Now&quot;.

Regardless, Lennon began writing the song in January 1965, while on holiday with his wife, Cynthia, and record producer George Martin at St. Moritz in the Swiss Alps. Over the following days, Lennon expanded on an acoustic arrangement of the song, which was written in a Dylanesque time signature, and showed it to Martin while he recovered from a skiing injury. In his book &quot;The Songs of Lennon: The Beatle Years&quot;, author John Stevens describes &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; as a turning point in folk-style ballads, writing that &quot;Lennon moves quickly from one lyrical image to another, leaving it up to the listener&#x27;s imagination to complete the picture&quot;. He also said the song marked a pivotal moment in Lennon&#x27;s use of surreal lyrics, following on from the songs &quot;Ask Me Why&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;s a Place&quot;.

==Sitar and Indian influence==
Between 5 and 6 April 1965, while filming the second Beatles film, &quot;Help!&quot;, at Twickenham Film Studios, George Harrison first encountered a sitar, the Indian string instrument that would be a prominent feature in &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;. It was one of several instruments being played by a group of Indian musicians in a scene set in an Indian restaurant.

&quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was not the first Western pop song in which an Indian influence was evident: the raga-like drone was found in the Beatles&#x27; &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot;, as well as in the Kinks&#x27; song &quot;See My Friends&quot;. The Yardbirds also created a similar sound with a distorted electric guitar on &quot;Heart Full of Soul&quot;. Barry Fantoni, a friend of Ray Davies of the Kinks, said that the Beatles first got the idea to use Indian instrumentation when Fantoni played them &quot;See My Friends&quot;. According to author Ian MacDonald, however, while the Kinks&#x27; single most likely influenced the Beatles, Davies could well have been influenced by &quot;Ticket to Ride&quot; when recording &quot;See My Friends&quot;.

Rather than the Kinks or the Yardbirds, Harrison attributed his growing interest in Indian sounds to people mentioning the name of Indian sitarist Ravi Shankar to him, culminating in a discussion he had with David Crosby of the Byrds. The discussion took place in Los Angeles on 25 August, during the Beatles&#x27; 1965 American tour. Once back in London, Harrison followed Crosby&#x27;s suggestion by seeking out Shankar&#x27;s recordings, and he also purchased a cheap sitar, from the Indiacraft store on Oxford Street. Ringo Starr later cited Harrison&#x27;s use of sitar on &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; as an example of the Beatles&#x27; eagerness to incorporate new sounds in 1965, saying: &quot;you could walk in with an elephant, as long as it was going to make a musical note.&quot;

==Recording==
The Beatles recorded an early version of &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; during the first day of sessions for their album &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, on 12 October 1965. The session took place at EMI Studios in London, with Martin producing. Titled &quot;This Bird Has Flown&quot;, the song was extensively rehearsed by the group, who then taped the rhythm track in a single take, featuring two 12-string acoustic guitars, bass, and a faint sound of cymbals. At Lennon&#x27;s behest, Harrison added his sitar part, with the take emphasising the drone quality of the instrument more so than the remake that was eventually released. The sound of the sitar proved difficult to capture, according to sound engineer Norman Smith, who recalled problems with &quot;a lot of nasty peaks and a very complex wave form&quot;. He declined to use a limiter, which would have fixed the technical problem with distortion, but would have affected the sound.

Lennon overdubbed a lead vocal, which he double tracked at the end of each line in the verses. This version exhibited a less folk-orientated sound, relative to the recording issued on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;, instead highlighting laboured vocals and an unusual sitar conclusion. The band were unsatisfied with the recording, however, and decided to return to the song later in the sessions. This discarded version of &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was first released on the 1996 compilation album &quot;Anthology 2&quot;.

On 21 October, the Beatles recorded three new takes, including the master. The group experimented with the arrangement, with the second take introducing a double-tracked sitar opening that complemented Lennon&#x27;s acoustic melody. Though the group completely reshaped &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, it was far from the album version. Harrison&#x27;s sitar playing is still at the forefront, alongside heavy drumbeats. The take was not considered suitable for overdubbing, so the band scrapped it, and re-evaluated the arrangement. By the third take, the song was called &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, and the group changed the key from D major to E major. The Beatles skipped the rhythm section on this take, and decided to jump directly to the master take. In all, the rhythm section accommodates the acoustics, and the band thought the musical style was an improvement over earlier run-throughs. Therefore, the sitar is an accompaniment, consequently affecting the droning sound evident in past takes. Looking back on the recording sessions in the 1990s, Harrison explained his inclusion of the sitar to be &quot;quite spontaneous from what I remember&quot;, adding, &quot;We miked it up and put it on and it just seemed to hit the spot&quot;.

==Release and reception==
&quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; was released on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; on 3 December 1965. The song marked the first example of a rock band playing a sitar or any Indian instrument on one of their recordings. It was also issued on a single with &quot;Nowhere Man&quot; in Australia and was a number 1 hit there in May 1966. The two songs were listed together, as a double A-side, during the single&#x27;s two weeks at number 1. In the United Kingdom, the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) awarded the song a silver certification for sales and streams exceeding 200,000 units in 2021.

Writing for AllMusic, music historian Richie Unterberger describes &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; as possessing &quot;more than enough ambiguity and ingenious innuendo to satisfy even a Dylan fan&quot; while demonstrating to the Beatles&#x27; audience how &quot;the group had sure come a long way since &#x27;She Loves You&#x27; just two years back.&quot; Unterberger concludes his review by commenting: &quot;The power of the track is greatly enhanced by McCartney&#x27;s sympathetic high harmonies on the bridge, and its exoticism confirmed by George Harrison&#x27;s twanging sitar riffs&quot;. A reviewer for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine noted &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and &quot;Think for Yourself&quot; as documents of the Beatles&#x27; increasing awareness and creativity in the studio. Scott Plagenhoef of &quot;Pitchfork&quot; considers the song to be one of the most self-evident Lennon pieces on &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; to exemplify his maturity as a songwriter, and praises the composition as &quot;an economical and ambiguous story-song highlighted by Harrison&#x27;s first dabbling with the Indian sitar&quot;.

In his book on the &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; era, subtitled &quot;The Enduring Beauty of Rubber Soul&quot;, John Kruth refers to &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; as a &quot;striking from the first listen&quot; kind of tune that &quot;transported Beatles fans north to the pristine forests of Scandinavia&quot;. Music critic Kenneth Womack admires how the song &quot;reinterprets a familiar theme, in this case the loss of &#x27;love&#x27; (well represented in earlier songs such as &#x27;Don&#x27;t Bother Me&#x27; and &#x27;Misery&#x27;), providing listeners with security yet challenging those inclined to acknowledge the standard treatment&quot;.

==Musical influence and legacy==
Although droning guitars had been used previously to mimic the qualities of the sitar, &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is generally credited as sparking a musical craze for the sound of the novel instrument in the mid-1960s. The song is often identified as the first example of raga rock,&lt;ref name=&quot;Bag/LiveMint&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while the trend it initiated led to the arrival of Indian rock and formed the essence of psychedelic rock. &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; is also recognised as an important piece of what is now typically called &quot;world music&quot;, and it was a major step towards incorporating non-Western musical influences into Western popular music. The composition, coupled with advice given by Harrison, sparked the interest of Rolling Stones multi-instrumentalist Brian Jones, who soon integrated the sitar into &quot;Paint It Black&quot;, another landmark song in the development of raga and Indian rock. Other pieces exemplifying the rapid growth of interest in Indian music by contemporary Western musicians include Donovan&#x27;s &quot;Sunshine Superman&quot;, the Yardbirds&#x27; &quot;Shapes of Things&quot; and the Byrds&#x27; &quot;Eight Miles High&quot;, among others.
According to author Jonathan Gould, the impact of &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; &quot;transformed&quot; Ravi Shankar&#x27;s career, and the Indian sitarist later wrote of first being aware of a &quot;great sitar explosion&quot; in popular music during the spring of 1966, when he was performing a series of concerts in the UK. Harrison developed a fascination for Indian culture and mysticism, introducing it to the other Beatles. In June 1966, Harrison met Shankar in London and became a student under the master sitarist. Having added the sitar accompaniment to &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot;, Harrison expanded upon his initial effort by writing &quot;Love You To&quot;, which showcased his immersion in Indian music, and presented an authentic representation of a non-Western music form in a rock song. Before the recording sessions for &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, Harrison made a pilgrimage to Bombay, India with his wife Pattie, where he continued his studies with Shankar and was introduced to the teachings of several yogis. Harrison contributed &quot;Within You Without You&quot; to &quot;Sgt. Pepper&quot;, featuring himself as the only performing Beatle together with uncredited musicians playing dilruba, swarmandal and tabla, alongside a string section. For the remainder of his career, he evolved his understanding of Indian musicianship, particularly in his slide guitar playing.

In 2006, &quot;Mojo&quot; placed &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; at number 19 in the magazine&#x27;s list of &quot;The 101 Greatest Beatles Songs&quot;, as compiled by a panel of music critics and musicians. In their commentary on the song, Roy Harper and John Cale both identified the track as an influence on their musical careers during the 1960s. Harper wrote:
We all knew that they were good ... What you weren&#x27;t prepared for was &quot;Rubber Soul&quot;. They were writing with a deeper resonance, in another time zone ... I was envious and inspired at the same moment. They&#x27;d come onto my turf, got there before me, and they were kings of it, overnight. We&#x27;d all been outflanked. The best song on the record was one of the shortest, Norwegian Wood. Tears came to my eyes, I wished I&#x27;d written it. The music was sublimely different. George&#x27;s sitar was a well-placed act of fusion and the song was full of Lennon wit. After a few times on the turntable, you realised that the goal posts had been moved, forever, and you really wanted to hear the next record – now.&lt;ref name=&quot;Alexander/Mojo&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Cale recalled that &quot;Rubber Soul&quot; was an inspiration to him and Lou Reed as they developed their band the Velvet Underground. He described the song&#x27;s mood as &quot;very acid ... what you remember in a flashback is a sound, how your senses were bombarded&quot;, adding: &quot;I don&#x27;t think anybody got that sound or that closeted feeling as well as The Beatles did on Norwegian Wood.&quot; In his book &quot;The Beatles Through Headphones&quot;, Ted Montgomery comments: &quot;Perhaps no other song in rock and roll history captures a feel and nuance more succinctly and powerfully in 2:05 than &#x27;Norwegian Wood&#x27;.&quot;

The song has been covered by numerous artists, including Waylon Jennings, Tangerine Dream, Cilla Black, Hank Williams Jr, Cornershop, The Fiery Furnaces, Rahul Dev Burman, Buddy Rich, P.M. Dawn and Heather Nova. The Chemical Brothers sampled &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; in their 1997 song &quot;The Private Psychedelic Reel&quot;. In 1968, Alan Copeland won the Grammy Award for Best Contemporary Performance by a Chorus for a medley of &quot;Norwegian Wood&quot; and the theme from &quot;Mission: Impossible&quot;.

<text>Ruthenian and Ruthene are exonyms of Latin origin, formerly used in Eastern and Central Europe as common ethnonyms for East Slavs, particularly during the late medieval and early modern periods. The Latin term was used in medieval sources to describe all Eastern Slavs of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, as an exonym for people of the former Kievan Rus&#x27;, thus including ancestors of the modern Belarusians, Rusyns and Ukrainians. The use of &quot;Ruthenian&quot; and related exonyms continued through the early modern period, developing several distinctive meanings, both in terms of their regional scopes and additional religious connotations (such as affiliation with the Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church).

In medieval sources, the Latin term was commonly applied to East Slavs in general, thus encompassing all endonyms and their various forms (; ). By opting for the use of exonymic terms, authors who wrote in Latin were relieved from the need to be specific in their applications of those terms, and the same quality of &quot;Ruthenian&quot; exonyms is often recognized in modern, mainly Western authors, particularly those who prefer to use exonyms (foreign in origin) over endonyms.

During the early modern period, the exonym &quot;Ruthenian&quot; was most frequently applied to the East Slavic population of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, an area encompassing territories of modern Belarus and Ukraine from the 15th up to the 18th centuries. In the former Austro-Hungarian Monarchy, the same term () was employed up to 1918 as an official exonym for the entire Ukrainian population within the borders of the Monarchy.

==History==
&quot;Ruteni&quot;, a misnomer that was also the name of an extinct and unrelated Celtic tribe in Ancient Gaul, was used in reference to &quot;Rus&quot; in the &quot;Annales Augustani&quot; of 1089. An alternative early modern Latinisation, &quot;Rucenus&quot; (plural: &quot;Ruceni&quot;) was, according to Boris Unbegaun, derived from &quot;Rusyn&quot;. Baron Herberstein, describing the land of &quot;Russia&quot;, inhabited by the &quot;Rutheni&quot; who call themselves &quot;Russi&quot;, claimed that the first of the governors who rule &quot;Russia&quot; is the Grand Duke of Moscow, the second is the Grand Duke of Lithuania and the third is the King of Poland.According to professor John-Paul Himka from the University of Alberta the word &quot;Rutheni&quot; did not include the modern Russians, who were known as &quot;Moscovitae&quot; throughout Western Europe. Vasili III of Russia, who ruled the Grand Duchy of Moscow in the 16th century, was known in European Latin sources as &quot;Rhuteni Imperator&quot;. Jacques Margeret in his book &quot;Estat de l&#x27;empire de Russie, et grande duché de Moscovie&quot; of 1607 said that the name &quot;Muscovites&quot; for the population of Tsardom (Empire) of Russia is an error. During conversations, they called themselves &quot;rusaki&quot; (which is a colloquial term for &quot;Russians&quot;) and only the citizens of the capital called themself &quot;Muscovites&quot;. Margeret considered that this error is worse than calling all the French &quot;Parisians&quot;. Professor David Frick from the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute has also found in Vilnius the documents from 1655, which demonstrate that &quot;Moscovitae&quot; were also known in Lithuania as &quot;Rutheni&quot;. The 16th century Portuguese poet Luís Vaz de Camões in his Os Lusíadas&quot; (Canto III, 11) clearly writes &quot;...Entre este mar e o Tánais vive estranha Gente: Rutenos, Moscos e Livónios, Sármatas outro tempo...&quot; [English translation: &quot;...Between this sea and the Tánais live strange People: Ruthenians, Muscovites and Livonians, Sarmatians in another time...&quot;] differentiating between Ruthenians and Muscovites.
After the partition of Poland, the term Ruthenian referred exclusively to people of the Rusyn- and Ukrainian-speaking areas of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, especially in the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria, Bukovina, and Transcarpathia.

At the request of Mykhailo Levytsky, in 1843, the term Ruthenian became the official name for the Rusyns and Ukrainians within the Austrian Empire. For example, Ivan Franko and Stepan Bandera in their passports were identified as Ruthenians (). By 1900, more and more Ruthenians began to call themselves with the self-designated name Ukrainians. With the emergence of Ukrainian nationalism during the mid-19th century, use of &quot;Ruthenian&quot; and cognate terms declined among Ukrainians and fell out of use in Eastern and Central Ukraine. Most people in the western region of Ukraine followed suit later in the 19th century. During the early 20th century, the name &quot;Ukrajins&#x27;ka mova&quot; (&quot;Ukrainian language&quot;) became accepted by much of the Ukrainian-speaking literary class in the Austro-Hungarian Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria.

Following the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918, new states emerged and dissolved; borders changed frequently. After several years, the Rusyn and Ukrainian speaking areas of eastern Austria-Hungary found themselves divided between the Czechoslovakia, Poland, and Romania.

When commenting on the partition of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany in March 1939, US diplomat George Kennan noted, &quot;To those who inquire whether these peasants are Russians or Ukrainians, there is only one answer. They are Neither. They are simply Ruthenians.&quot; Dr. Paul R. Magocsi emphasizes that modern Ruthenians have &quot;the sense of a nationality distinct from Ukrainians&quot; and often associate Ukrainians with Soviets or Communists.

After the expansion of Soviet Ukraine following World War II, several groups who had not previously considered themselves Ukrainians were merged into the Ukrainian identity.

==Ruthenian terminology in Poland==
In the interbellum period of the 20th century, the term &quot;rusyn&quot; (&quot;Ruthenian&quot;) was also applied to people from the &quot;Kresy Wschodnie&quot; (the eastern borderlands) in the Second Polish Republic, and included Ukrainians, Rusyns, and Lemkos, or alternatively, members of the Uniate or Greek Catholic Churches. In Galicia, the Polish government actively replaced all references to &quot;Ukrainians&quot; with the old word &quot;rusini&quot; (&quot;Ruthenians&quot;).

The Polish census of 1921 considered Ukrainians no other than Ruthenians, meanwhile Belarusians have already become a separate nation, which in Polish is literally translated as &quot;White Ruthenians&quot; (). However the Polish census of 1931 counted Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Rusyn as separate language categories, and the census results were substantially different from before. According to Rusyn-American historian Paul Robert Magocsi, Polish government policy in the 1930s pursued a strategy of tribalization, regarding various ethnographic groups—i.e., Lemkos, Boykos, and Hutsuls, as well as Old Ruthenians and Russophiles—as different from other Ukrainians and offered instructions in Lemko vernacular in state schools set up in the westernmost Lemko Region.

The Polish census of 1931 listed &quot;Belarusian&quot;, &quot;Rusyn&quot; and &quot;Ukrainian&quot; (, respectively) as separate languages.

==Carpatho-Ruthenian ethnonyms==

By the end of the 19th century, another set of terms came into use in several western languages, combining regional Carpathian with &quot;Ruthenian&quot; designations, and thus producing composite terms such as: Carpatho-Ruthenes or Carpatho-Ruthenians. Those terms also acquired several meanings, depending on the shifting geographical scopes of the term Carpathian Ruthenia. Those meanings were also spanning from wider uses as designations for all East Slavs of the Carpathian region, to narrower uses, focusing on those local groups of East Slavs who did not accept a modern Ukrainian identity, but rather opted to keep their traditional Rusyn identity. 
The designations Rusyn and Carpatho-Rusyn were banned in the Soviet Union by the end of World War II in June 1945. Ruthenians who identified under the Rusyn ethnonym and considered themselves to be a national and linguistic group separate from Ukrainians and Belarusians were relegated to the Carpathian diaspora and formally functioned among the large immigrant communities in the United States. A cross-European revival took place only with the collapse of communist rule in 1989. This has resulted in political conflict and accusations of intrigue against Rusyn activists, including criminal charges. The Rusyn minority is well represented in Slovakia. The single category of people who listed their ethnicity as Rusyn was created in the 1920s; however, no generally accepted standardised Rusyn language existed.

The government of Slovakia has proclaimed Rusyns (&quot;Rusíni&quot;) to be a distinct national minority (1991) and recognised Rusyn language as a distinct language (1995).

== Speculative theories ==
Since the 19th century, several speculative theories emerged regarding the origin and nature of medieval and early modern uses of &quot;Ruthenian&quot; terms as designations for East Slavs. Some of those theories were focused on a very specific source, a memorial plate from 1521, that was placed in the catacombe Chapel of St Maximus in Petersfriedhof, the burial site of St Peter&#x27;s Abbey in Salzburg (modern Austria). The plate contains Latin inscription that mentions Italian ruler Odoacer (476–493) as king of &quot;Rhutenes&quot; or &quot;Rhutenians&quot; (), and narrates a story about the martyrdom of St Maximus during an invasion of several peoples into Noricum in 477. Due to the very late date (1521) and several anachronistic elements, the content of that plate is considered as legendary.

In spite of that, some authors (mainly non-scholars) employed that plate as a &quot;source&quot; for several theories that were trying to connect Odoacer with ancient Celtic Ruthenes from Gaul, thus also providing an apparent bridge towards later medieval authors who labeled East Slavs as &quot;Ruthenes&quot; or &quot;Ruthenians&quot;. On those bases, an entire strain of speculative theories was created, regarding the alleged connection between ancient Gallic Ruthenes and later East Slavic &quot;Ruthenians&quot;. As noted by professor Paul R. Magocsi, those theories should be regarded as &quot;inventive tales&quot; of &quot;creative&quot; writers.

==Geography==
From the 9th century, Kievan Rus&#x27; – now part of the modern states of Ukraine, Belarus and Russia – was known in Western Europe by a variety of names derived from Rus&#x27;. From the 12th century, the land of Rus&#x27; was usually known in Western Europe by the Latinised name Ruthenia.

== Ruthenian culture ==

=== Language ===
The Ruthenian language (Ruthenian: рускаꙗ мова, рускїй ѧзыкъ) was an exonymic linguonym for a closely related group of East Slavic linguistic varieties, particularly those spoken from the 15th to 18th centuries in the East Slavic regions of the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth. By the end of the 18th century, they gradually diverged into regional variants, which subsequently developed into the modern Belarusian (&quot;White Ruthenian&quot;), Ukrainian (&quot;Ruthenian&quot;), and Rusyn (&quot;Carpathian Ruthenian&quot;) languages.

=== Religions ===

With the conversion of Vladimir the Great began a long history of the dominance of Eastern Orthodoxy in Ruthenia. The Rus&#x27; accepted Christianity in its Byzantine form at the same time as the Poles accepted it in its Latin form, Lithuanians largely remained pagan to the late Middle Ages before their nobility embraced the Latin form upon the political union with the Poles. The eastward expansion of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania had been facilitated by amicable treaties and inter-marriages of the nobility when faced with the external threat of the Mongol invasion of Kievan Rus&#x27;.

By the end of the 12th century, Europe was generally divided into two large areas: Western Europe with dominance of Catholicism, and Eastern Europe with Orthodox and Byzantine influences. The border between them was roughly marked by the Bug River. This placed the area now known as Belarus in a unique position where these two influences mixed and interfered.

The first Latin Church diocese in White Ruthenia was established in Turaŭ between 1008 and 1013. Catholicism was a traditionally dominant religion of Belarusian nobility (the szlachta) and of a large part of the population of western and northwestern parts of Belarus. Before the 14th century, the Eastern Orthodox Church was dominant in White Ruthenia. The Union of Krewo in 1385 broke this monopoly and made Catholicism the religion of the ruling class.

Jogaila, then ruler of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, ordered the whole population of Lithuania to convert to Catholicism. One and a half years after the Union of Krewo, the (Vilnius) episcopate was created which received a lot of land from the Lithuanian dukes. By the mid-16th century Catholicism became strong in Lithuania and bordering with it north-west parts of White Ruthenia, but the Orthodox church was still dominant.

In the 14th century, Emperor Andronikos II Palaiologos sanctioned the creation of two additional metropolitan sees: the Metropolis of Halych (1303) and the Metropolis of Lithuania (1317).

Metropolitan Roman (1355–1362) of Lithuania and Metropolitan Alexius of Kiev both claimed the see. Both metropolitans travelled to Constantinople to make their appeals in person. In 1356, their cases were heard by a Patriarchal Synod. The Holy Synod confirmed that Alexis was the Metropolitan of Kiev while Roman was also confirmed in his see at Novogorodek. In 1361, the two sees were formally divided. Shortly afterwards, in the winter of 1361/62, Roman died. From 1362 to 1371, the vacant see of Lithuania–Halych was administered by Alexius. By that point, the Lithuanian metropolis was effectively dissolved.

Following the signing of the Council of Florence, Metropolitan Isidore of Kiev returned to Moscow in 1441 as a Ruthenian cardinal. He was arrested by the Grand Duke of Moscow and accused of apostasy. The Grand Duke deposed Isidore and in 1448 installed own candidate as Metropolitan of Kyiv — Jonah. This was carried out without the approval of Patriarch Gregory III of Constantinople. When Isidore died in 1458, he was succeeded as metropolitan in the Patriarchate of Constantinople by Gregory the Bulgarian. Gregory&#x27;s canonical territory was the western part of the traditional Kievan Rus&#x27; lands — the states of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania and the Kingdom of Poland. The episcopal seat was in the city of Navahrudak which is today located in Belarus. It was later moved to Vilnius — the capital of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. A parallel succession to the title ensued between Moscow and Vilnius. The Metropolitans of Kiev are the predecessors of the Patriarch of Moscow and all Rus&#x27; that was formed in the 16th century.

The Ruthenian Uniate Church was created in 1595–1596 by those clergy of the Eastern Orthodox churches who subscribed to the Union of Brest. In the process, they switched their allegiances and jurisdiction from the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople to the Holy See. It had a single metropolitan territory — the Metropolis of Kiev, Galicia and all Ruthenia. The formation of the church led to a high degree of confrontation among Ruthenians, such as the murder of the hierarch Josaphat Kuntsevych in 1623. Opponents of the union called church members &quot;Uniates&quot;, although Catholic documents no longer use the term due to its perceived negative overtones. In 1620, these dissenters erected their own metropolis — the &quot;Metropolis of Kyev, Galicia and all Ruthenia&quot;.

In the 16th century, a crisis began in Christianity: the Protestant Reformation began in Catholicism and a period of heresy began in an Orthodox area. From the mid-16th century Protestant ideas began spreading in the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. The first Protestant Church in Belarus was created in Brest by Mikołaj &quot;the Black&quot; Radziwiłł. Protestantism did not survive due to the Counter-Reformation in Poland.

Both the Catholic Church in the Commonwealth and the Ruthenian Church underwent a period of decay. The Ruthenian Church was the church of a people without statehood. The Poles considered the Ruthenians a conquered people. Over time, the Lithuanian military and political ascendancy did away with the Ruthenian autonomies. The disadvantageous political status of the Ruthenian people also affected the status of their church and undermined her capacity for reform and renewal. Furthermore, they could not expect support from the Mother Church in Constantinople or from their co-religionists in Moscow. Thus, the Ruthenian church was in a weaker position than the Catholic Church in the Commonwealth.

Until 1666, when Patriarch Nikon was deposed by the tsar, the Russian Orthodox Church had been independent of the State. In 1721, the first Russian Emperor, Peter I, abolished completely the patriarchate and effectively made the church a department of the government, ruled by the Most Holy Synod composed of senior bishops and lay bureaucrats appointed by the emperor himself. Over time, Imperial Russia would style itself a protector and patron of all Orthodox Christians, especially those within the Ottoman Empire.

Domination of tsarist-ruled Ukraine by the Russian Empire (from 1721) eventually led to the decline of Uniate Catholicism (officially founded in 1596) in the Ukrainian lands under Tsarist control.

<text>Trumps of Doom is a fantasy novel by the American writer Roger Zelazny, the first book in the second &quot;Chronicles of Amber&quot; series and the sixth book in the Amber series. Whereas the first series was narrated by Corwin, this series is narrated by his son, Merlin. &quot;Trumps of Doom&quot; won the Locus Award for Best Fantasy Novel in 1986.

==Plot summary==
Merlin has spent the last several years on Earth learning computer science while building Ghostwheel, a trump- and pattern-based computer, elsewhere in Shadow. Having completed his project, he wishes to know who has been trying to kill him every April 30, and why some of the better attempts failed, before he leaves. He meets with his friend Lucas Reynard (Luke), a salesman, who tries to convince him to stay, and who tells him that Julia Barnes, Merlin&#x27;s ex-girlfriend, may be in trouble. Merlin investigates and finds Julia slain by creatures from another shadow.

Merlin investigates through shadow, and is given orders by king Random to shut down Ghostwheel. However, Ghostwheel has become sentient and capable of defending itself. Eventually, Luke - who, it turns out, is Brand&#x27;s son - imprisons Merlin in a blue crystal cave so he can attempt to take control of Ghostwheel for himself.

==Reception==
&quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; wrote: &quot;Inventive, incident-packed, often fascinating stuff, with flashes of wry humor--but there&#x27;s not even a token resolution here, and it isn&#x27;t satisfying in itself.&quot; Frank Catalano of &quot;The Seattle Times&quot; wrote that the novel &quot;moves along at such a breakneck pace that its abrupt ending leaves you teetering on the edge of a cliff.&quot; Tim Preso of &quot;The Oregonian&quot; called the novel &quot;exceedingly readable&quot; with &quot;well-developed characters&quot;. However, he also wrote that Zelazny &quot;seems to be treading familiar ground&quot;.

<text>Goole is a port town and civil parish on the River Ouse in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. The town&#x27;s historic county is the West Riding of Yorkshire.

At the 2021 UK census, Goole parish had a population of 20,475. It is north-east of Doncaster, south of York and west of Hull.

The town has the United Kingdom&#x27;s furthest inland port, being about from the North Sea. It is capable of handling nearly 2 million tonnes of cargo per year, making it one of the most important ports on England&#x27;s east coast.

Goole is twinned with Złotów in Poland. Goole was informally twinned with Gibraltar in the 1960s; at that time, Gibraltar Court was named in Goole and Goole Court was named in Gibraltar.

== History ==
=== Etymology ===
Goole is first attested in 1306, as &quot;Gull Lewth&quot; (where &quot;lewth&quot; means &#x27;barn&#x27;, from Old Norse &quot;hlaða&quot;), and then 1362 as &quot;Gulle in Houke&quot;&#x27; (referring to the nearby, and then more significant, village of Hook). The name is first attested in its shorter, modern form, from the 1530s. It comes from the Middle English word &quot;goule&quot; (or an Old English ancestor), meaning &#x27;a channel made by a stream&#x27;. The word has sometimes been taken to imply that Goole is named after an open sewer, but there is no strong basis for this. There were no sewers in the area in that etymological period but there were many land drains because of the flat terrain: c.f.: &quot;gully&quot;.

===Background===
The Dutch civil engineer Cornelius Vermuyden diverted the River Don northwards to the River Ouse in 1626–1629 in order to drain the marshland of Hatfield Chase at the behest of King Charles I. It made the new lower Don – known as the Dutch River – navigable for barges so that coal from the South Yorkshire Coalfield could be transported to the new confluence for transfer to seagoing vessels. There the engineers built a new wooden bridge – rebuilt in iron in the 1890s and now known as the Dutch River Bridge – to the east of which a new village called &#x27;Goole&#x27; formed.

===Development===
In the 1820s the Aire and Calder Navigation company proposed development of a new canal to transport coal from the existing broad canal from Knottingley in the northern sector of the coalfield in 1826. Once it reached Goole the company proposed development of a new floating dock capable of handling larger sea-going vessels. Chief engineer Thomas Hamond Bartholomew was instructed to build the canal, docks and an associated company town to house both the dock workers and visiting seamen. Bartholomew commissioned civil engineer and builder Sir Edward Banks company to construct part of the canal and the eight transshipment docks and to lay out the associated new town to the west of the existing wooden bridge. The Banks Arms Hotel on Aire Street – today known as the Lowther Hotel – was in 1824 the first building constructed in what was known as New Goole; &quot;The Macintosh Arms&quot; public house on the same street took its name from engineer Hugh Macintosh.

When Goole port opened on 20 July 1826 it was a new community of about 450 people. Now it is a town with about 18,000 inhabitants.

William Hamond Bartholomew succeeded his father T. H. Bartholomew in 1853 and in 1863 introduced the Tom Pudding system of compartment boats, which could carry around of coal. On reaching the docks the barges were lifted by large hoists, from which they could be discharged direct into seagoing ships, a system so successful that it competed against rail until 1985.

==Education==

Goole has several primary schools as well as Goole High School, and a special needs school, Riverside School, that caters for 2–19 year olds. There are further education colleges in Selby, York, Scunthorpe, and Bishop Burton. Goole College was closed in 2021 and is now being used as a temporary Gym while Goole Leisure Centre is redeveloped.

==Transport==

The Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway built a line from Pontefract and Wakefield in 1848 and the North Eastern Railway connected the port with Doncaster and Hull in 1870. The prosperity from the coal and general cargo trade with the West Riding industrial area continued for 150 years after the opening of the canal.

Today Goole railway station is at the junction of the Hull and Doncaster Branch and the Pontefract Line. Services are provided to Hull Paragon Interchange, Doncaster, Sheffield, Leeds and the commuter stations in between.

Goole is south of the M62 linking it with Kingston upon Hull in the east and Leeds and the West Yorkshire urban belt in the west. To the north the A63 road via Howden provides local access to the A19 road to Selby and York. The M18 runs west of the town, connecting it with South Yorkshire, the South and the Midlands. Bus services to surrounding towns and villages are provided by East Yorkshire Motor Services, Stagecoach in Hull and Arriva Yorkshire. Hull Trains is a popular train service in Goole, England. Hull Trains offers direct connections to London King&#x27;s Cross from Goole.

==Governance==
Before the reform of local government in 1974, brought about by the Local Government Act 1972, Goole was in the West Riding of Yorkshire. It was then placed in the Boothferry district of the county of Humberside until that was abolished in 1996. Since 1996 Goole has been in the East Riding of Yorkshire. It is represented by four councillors on the East Riding of Yorkshire Council.

Goole is in the parliamentary constituency of Goole and Pocklington, which has been represented in the House of Commons since 2024 by David Davis, a Conservative.

==Landmarks==

Goole&#x27;s most prominent landmarks are its twin water towers, nicknamed &#x27;salt&#x27; and &#x27;pepper&#x27;. The new white water-tower was the largest in Europe at the time of construction. In the winter months Goole&#x27;s gas holder on Anderson Road is visible across the north of the town. Many of the hoists and cranes on the dockside can be seen across the town. The steeple of Goole Parish Church is tall enough to be seen across the town. The townscape is made up mostly of utility and industrial structures. There is a clock tower in the main shopping district of the town, originally built in 1927 but later moved a few metres to the middle of a new roundabout with the road surface on the site of the former open-air marketplace. West Park is an Edwardian park in the town.

==Economy==
Goole has a modestly-sized town centre with many high street shops, independent retailers and public houses. The main shopping area is Wesley Square, off Boothferry Road (which has been pedestrianised around the main shopping area). There is a modern retail development in the town centre, a leisure centre next to the docks and the Goole and District Hospital, to the north of the town. A theatre and cinema, &#x27;Junction&#x27;, opened in 2009.

==Industry==

Glass is produced in Goole, which is also the centre of an agricultural district. The town&#x27;s former large employer was a clothing manufacture for the big multiples, but it closed in the late 2000s. 

Goole&#x27;s industrial park, Capitol Park / Goole36, has attracted two large employers: Guardian Industries, which built a glass-manufacturing plant, and Tesco, which built a distribution centre. The arrival of these employers resulted in the creation of hundreds of new jobs. 

A new Morrisons store opened in Goole on 2 August 2010, on land previously occupied by Timms Mill on Boothferry Road. 

A new railway rolling stock factory was built at the Capitol Park / Goole36 location opening in 2024. The plant, owned and operated by Siemens Mobility, is currently building the new tube trains for the Piccadilly line in London.

A new Metsä Tissue toilet roll factory was announced 21 September 2023, to be built over the next decade at the new Goole site within the Humber Freeport, which allows companies to import goods tariff-free. When completed it will have a capacity to produce of tissue paper using fresh wood fibres grown in Nordic forests.

===Docks===
Three locks keep the water in of floating docks at a constant depth of by preventing the level from rising and falling with the tides in the River Ouse. Once ships are within the complex, eight docks provide a total quayside of . Beside the docks are transit sheds where cargo is stored, many of them equipped with overhead cranes. Unlike many ports, every one of the eight docks has been in full commercial operation since its construction in the period from 1826 to 1912.

For most of its life, the port was most associated with the shipment of coal and associated cargoes, including the importation of pit props. With the demise of mining, the former Timber Pond became a marina, trading under the name &quot;Goole Boathouse&quot;. It has berths for 150 boats.

After a period of decline, commodities were replaced by containers, the export of steel and the import of timber from north-eastern Europe. Today, the Port of Goole has regular cargo liner services to Norway, Sweden, Finland, Germany, the Netherlands, Belgium, France, Spain, Morocco and South Africa and a transshipment route to Europort, Rotterdam.

==Sport==

Goole Town Cricket Club supports local cricket teams. Of its three teams, the first team plays in the club cricket York &amp; District Senior League. A new clubhouse was constructed in 1996 providing facilities and a bar.

Rugby Union is played close to the cricket club at Westfield Banks, sharing facilities with Goole Tennis Club and Goole Viking Striders running club. Goole RUFC currently fields two teams, the first team playing in Yorkshire Division Two.

From 2025, Goole Vikings rugby league club will compete in League 1.

Goole Tennis Centre is a nine-court tennis club on the Westfield Banks site.

Goole has two football teams – Goole A.F.C. and Goole United A.F.C. They currently play in the Northern Premier League Division One South and the Humber Premier League Division One respectively. They both play at the Victoria Pleasure Grounds on Marcus Street. The nearest professional teams are Selby Town, Rotherham United, Doncaster Rovers, Grimsby Town, Hull City, Leeds United, Barnsley, Scunthorpe United, Sheffield Wednesday, Sheffield United and York City.

Goole used to have two golf clubs. The early course, founded in 1900, was at Rawcliffe Park. The later course was at Airmyn Park from 1911 to the Second World War. Currently Goole&#x27;s nearest golf clubs are the Boothferry Golf Club in Spaldington and Drax Golf Club in Drax.

==Media==
Television signals are received from either the Emley Moor or Belmont TV transmitters, However, on Sky and Freesat, residents in the town are allocated BBC One Yorkshire on 101 and ITV Yorkshire West on 103.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Humberside, Nation Radio East Yorkshire, Greatest Hits Radio Yorkshire, Capital Yorkshire and Radio Medica is a not-for-profit radio station broadcast from the Goole And District Hospital.

The town is served by a weekly tabloid newspaper, &quot;The Goole Times&quot;, published since 1853 and sold in Goole and neighbouring parts of the East Riding of Yorkshire.

<text>Dariusz Tomasz Michalczewski (born 5 May 1968) is a Polish-German professional boxer who competed from 1991 to 2005. He held multiple world championships in two weight classes, including the WBA, IBF, WBO and lineal light heavyweight titles between 1994 and 2003, and the WBO junior-heavyweight title from 1994 to 1995. Michalczewski is regarded by many as the greatest light-heavyweight boxer of all time.

==Early life and amateur career==
He was born in 1968 in Gdańsk to father Bogusław Michalczewski, a radio technician working for the Polish State Railways and mother Maria, an accountant. In his youth, before turning to boxing, he initially practiced wrestling and football.

Michalczewski came up through Poland&#x27;s state-run sports program as a boy and had a successful amateur career. He achieved an amateur record of 139–11–2 (89 KO). Highlights of his amateur career include:

*1986 – European Junior Semi-Finalist in middleweight division, defeating Fabrice Tiozzo but losing to Ray Close
*1990 – German National Champion in light heavyweight division
*1991 – European Champion in light heavyweight division

==Defection to Germany==
On 24 April 1988, while competing beyond the Iron Curtain in West Germany for the Polish national team, Michalczewski defected from the amateur team to stay in West Germany. Becoming a citizen of the now united Germany in 1991 and turning professional the same year, he was soon signed by Universum Box-Promotion, one of the leading boxing promoters in Europe. His aggressive style earned him the nickname &quot;Tiger&quot;.

==Professional career==
Michalczewski turned professional in September 1991. He won the German International light-heavyweight title early on 13 February 1993, a title for foreign-born fighters based in Germany. He then won the IBF Intercontinental title on 22 May 1993.

===Two-weight world champion===
On 10 September 1994, Michalczewski, at 23-0 (18 KOs), captured the WBO light-heavyweight title with a 12-round decision over defending champion Leeonzer Barber at Sporthalle, Alsterdorf, Hamburg, Germany. Between then and March 2003, Michalczewski made 23 successful defenses of his WBO title against 20 different boxers, and picked up three other belts along the way. Three months after beating Barber, he won the WBO cruiserweight title with a tenth-round knockout of Nestor Giovannini. However, he soon gave up that title to continue campaigning as a light-heavyweight.

In 1996, Universum Box-Promotion&#x27;s conditioning coach Fritz Sdunek became head coach and replaced Chuck Talhami as Michalczewski&#x27;s trainer, which resulted in a marked improvement in Michalczewski&#x27;s performances.

===Hill vs Michalczewski unification===
On 13 June 1997, he defeated Virgil Hill over 12 rounds to add Hill&#x27;s WBA, IBF and Lineal light-heavyweight titles to his own. However, Michalczewski soon lost both alphabet titles; Scandalously, the WBA immediately stripped him for displaying its belt along with that of the WBO. Michalczewski was then forced to relinquish the IBF title when he was unable to defend the title in a court-ordered defense against mandatory challenger William Guthrie within a little over a month after the bout with Hill.

After beating Hill, Michalczewski knocked out 14 consecutive opponents, all in defense of his &quot;Lineal&quot;/WBO titles. In 1998, he defeated Drake Thadzi, in 1999, he defeated Montel Griffin, and in 2000, he defeated Graciano Rocchigiani.

===Going for Marciano&#x27;s record===

Michalczewski had a perfect record of 48-0 when he faced Julio César González of Mexico in defense of his title on 18 October 2003. Coming into the fight, he was within one victory of tying Rocky Marciano&#x27;s record of 49 wins with no losses. A win also would have put him just one victory short of Joe Louis&#x27; all-time record for successful defenses at any weight class. However, as when Larry Holmes went for the same record against Michael Spinks, the now 35-year-old Michalczewski was unable to pull it off. He lost a split decision to the 27-year-old Gonzalez at the Color Line Arena in Hamburg, and his career record dropped to 48–1.

Despite the loss, he still holds the record for the most consecutive successful world title defenses at light-heavyweight.

===Final fight===
In October 2004, it was announced that Michalczewski would come out of retirement to box France&#x27;s Fabrice Tiozzo for the WBA light heavyweight title on 26 February 2005 in Hamburg. Michalczewski was stopped in six round, then he announced his retirement in May 2005.

Michalczewski was to come out of retirement to fight German boxing icon but suspected cheat Sven Ottke in Germany in May 2008, but the bout never materialized.

==In popular culture==
*Tiger Energy Drink is named after the famous boxer. His picture and text &quot;Recommended by Dariusz &#x27;Tiger&#x27; Michalczewski&quot; appears on the cans and bottles.
*Dariusz Michalczewski struck a friendship with performer Mark Wahlberg, known at the time by his stage name Marky Mark of the formation Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch. In 1995, Marky Mark released a track called &quot;No Mercy&quot; about his friend Dariusz Michalczewski, including excerpts in Polish from Dariusz, who also appears in the video clip shot by Frank Papenbroock. &quot;No Mercy&quot; appears in the album &quot;The Remix Album&quot; by Prince Ital Joe and Marky Mark, although this particular track is a solo effort by Marky Mark.
*In 2006, a documentary was made by Pawel Kocambasi alias P.M.Starost. The 60-minute documentary entitled &quot;Tiger&quot; took part in Filmfest München and won the award for the Best Documentary at the Biberacher Filmfestspiele.

==Social involvement==
In 2003 Dariusz Michalczewski established foundation &quot;Równe Szanse&quot; (equal chances) which was aimed at supporting initiatives for youth from dysfunctional families. Since 2014 he supports the social campaign for civil union and the right for adoption by homosexual couples.

<text>Jacqueline Beatrice de Jong (3 February 1939 – 29 June 2024) was a Dutch painter, sculptor, and graphic artist.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and escape (1939–1957) ===
De Jong was born in the Dutch town of Enschede, where her father, Hans, owned a lace and stocking factory. She grew up in Hengelo, with her Jewish parents. Faced with the German invasion of the Netherlands, they went into hiding. After an abortive escape attempt to England, her father Hans remained in Amsterdam while her mother, Alice de Jong-Weil and she made for Switzerland, accompanied by the Dutch painter Max van Dam. At the border they were captured by the French police, but just as they were about to be deported to the Drancy internment camp, they were rescued by the resistance, who helped them over the border. When they returned to the Netherlands following the war, Jacqueline could not speak Dutch. From 1947 on she went to school in Hengelo and Enschede (at the Gemeentelijk Lyceum).

=== Early career (1957–1990) ===
In 1957 de Jong went to Paris and was employed in the boutique at Christian Dior in the meantime studying French and drama. After leaving for London spring 1958 studying drama at the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, she returned to Amsterdam September 1958 – 1961 and was employed by the Stedelijk Museum, the home of Modern Art there. She visited London in 1959 where she met Danish painter Asger Jorn, the founder of the CoBrA group, They became companions. He was forty-five years old, compared to her twenty years.

She joined the Situationist International in 1960, and started to participate in conferences and the Central committee. After the expulsion of Constant Nieuwenhuys and his group, she became the Dutch Section of the organization. She did not accept the way the German section, also known as Gruppe SPUR, had been expelled and resigned. The cleft between the Debordists and the Second Situationist International grew, however she refused to join either faction, instead stating that people should act as situationists.
Between 1962 and 1968 she edited and published &quot;The Situationist Times&quot; involving Gaston Bachelard, Roberto Matta, Wifredo Lam and Jacques Prévert in this project. In 1968 she was in Paris, printing and distributing revolutionary posters.

<text>Cecil Foster (born September 26, 1954) is a Canadian novelist, essayist, journalist, Public intellectual and scholar. He is Chairman of the Department of Transnational Studies at the University at Buffalo.

==Early life and education==
Foster was born in Bridgetown, Barbados on 26 September 1954 to Fred and Doris Goddard. When Foster was two years old, his parents migrated to Britain, leaving their children with relatives. The family was extremely poor; Foster remembers a childhood where there was rarely enough to eat.

Foster attended Harrison College, a prestigious high school in Barbados. He immigrated to Canada in 1978. Foster completed his PhD at York University in 2002.

==Career==
Foster began working for the Caribbean News Agency in Bridgetown as the senior reporter and editor (1975–77), and the &quot;Barbados Advocate News&quot; as the reporter and columnist (1977–79), Foster emigrated to Canada in 1979. He went on to work for the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; as a reporter (1979–82). Foster then began working for &quot;The Contrast&quot; as an editor (1979–82), &quot;Transportation Business Management&quot; as an editor (1982–83), &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; as a reporter (1983–89), &quot;The Financial Post&quot; as a senior editor (1989), and also served as special adviser to Ontario&#x27;s Ministry of Culture, through the mid-1990s. His most recent book, &quot;Where Race Does Not Matter&quot; (2004), explores the potential of multiculturalism in Canada. It also expands on some of his earlier work that deals with issues of race in his own life as well as in the history of Canada. He is well known for exploring race through immigration, and empowers this culture and beliefs through &quot;Blacks in Action&quot;. Foster continues to bring his own personal experiences, and real-life issues to the work that he continues to produce. &quot;Island Wings: A Memoir&quot; (1998) was written as an autobiography of his own life, and is often referred to as more informative, rather than entertainment. Foster completed his PhD, a phenomenological exploration of the concept of Blackness in Canada, at York University in 2003. His philosophical influences include Hegel, Marx, Alexandre Kojève, Will Kymlicka, Charles Taylor, and former Canadian Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau.

Foster taught sociology at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada.

He is a well-regarded novelist. Foster served as a judge for the 2015 Scotiabank Giller Prize.
He won the Writers&#x27; Trust of Canada&#x27;s Gordon Montador Award in 1997 for his book &quot;A Place Called Heaven&quot; for the Best Canadian Book on Contemporary Social Issues, the novel “Sleep On, Beloved” was shortlisted for the Ontario Trillium Book Prize, and “Blackness and Modernity: The Colour of Humanity and the Quest for Freedom” (McGill-Queen’s UP 2007), won the 2008 John Porter Tradition of Excellence Book Award by the Canadian Sociology Association.

In 2019 he published the non-fiction book &quot;They Called Me George: The Untold Story of Black Train Porters and the Birth of Modern Canada&quot;, a study of the history of Black Canadian train porters. Writer Suzette Mayr consulted the book as part of her research for her Giller Prize-winning 2022 novel &quot;The Sleeping Car Porter&quot;.

<doc id="262852" wikidata="Q593942" url="?curid=262852" title="Kittilä">
<text>Kittilä (, , ) is a municipality of Finland and a popular holiday resort.

It is located in northern Finland north of the Arctic Circle within the Lapland region. The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is .

Kittilä is famous for being the location of the lowest recorded temperature in Finnish history: , measured in January 1999 in Pokka. The &quot;midnight sun&quot; is above the horizon from 29 May to 16 July, and the period with continuous daylight lasts a bit longer, polar night from 14 December to 29 December.

==Climate==
Kittilä has a subarctic climate (Dfc) as a result of its northerly location and being far inland, which renders strong seasonal shifts. The sun does not set between 30 May and 15 July (47 days), and white nights lasts from early May to early August. The period that the sun does not rise lasts from 14 December to 29 December (16 days), the exact boundaries depending on local Topography. Although winter temperatures are cold they are still less severe than in similar locations elsewhere in the world due to some Gulf Stream influence. In summer temperatures generally are moderate, although warm days are possible. On 28 January 1999, Pokka, Kittilä recorded the official lowest temperature in Finland, -51.5 °C (-60.7 °F). On the same day, a temperature of -56.5 °C (-69.7 °F) was recorded in Pokka, Kittilä. However, this temperature is not considered an official record due to being recorded at a decommissioned weather station.


==Economy==
In the 1980s and 1990s, Kittilä had a tourism boom. The village of Lainio became a hotbed for tourism innovation and included the planned construction of glass-roofed cabins for viewing of the aurora and luxury accommodations built around Neitokainen, a Finland-shaped lake. The Iriadamant eco-cult made a deal with a tourism company to act as an attraction in exchange for land and provisions.

The ski resort Levi is situated in the village of Sirkka, Kittilä on Levi Fell (in Finnish &quot;Levitunturi&quot;) (elevation 531 metres (1742 feet)). The resort hosts a slalom event early each season on the Alpine World Cup circuit and offers both downhill and cross-country skiing to the public, as well as snow shoeing, including to the next nearest fell, Kätkätunturi, located west of Levitunturi. Kätkätunturi is high and long.

On 5 June 2006, it was announced that a Canadian mining corporation Agnico-Eagle Mines will start a new gold mine in Kittilä. Once completed, it will be the biggest gold mine in Europe. Experts say that the deposits hold at least three million ounces of gold, by current market price worth 1.8 billion U.S. dollars. The mine is expected to produce an average of 150,000 ounces of gold annually for at least 13 years.

==Transportation==
Kittilä Airport is served by Finnair and Norwegian Air. TUI Airways also serves the airport from various UK bases as part of their programme of ski flights, as well as Christmas specials and flights in support of the When You Wish Upon A Star children&#x27;s foundation. The Lufthansa group also has flights between Germany and Kittilä.

<doc id="262853" wikidata="Q607782" url="?curid=262853" title="Aurore (grape)">
<text>Aurore (also known as Seibel 5279) is a white complex hybrid grape variety produced by French viticulturist Albert Seibel and used for wine production mostly in the United States and Canada. Over a long lifetime, Seibel produced many complex hybrid crosses (known as Seibel grapes) of &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; to American grapes. The Aurore grape is a cross of Seibel 788 (which is Sicilien × Clairette Dorée Ganzin) and Seibel 29 (a crossing of Munson and an unidentified &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;).

The fruit of Aurore ripens early in the season between late August and early September. Although the vine is resistant of many mildew diseases, is productive and vigorous, the fruit suffers susceptibility from bunch rot and bird attack. Aurore is planted where growing seasons are short like the Northern United States, Canada and the United Kingdom but is also planted in more temperate climates to extend the harvest season.

Aurore may be used as a table or wine grape. It tends not to be used as a table grape due to unsuitability for shipping and is generally used for bulk wine production for blending with wines made &quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; grape varieties. It is also used to a lesser extent to make fruity and sparkling wines though the wines tend to have neutral flavor and slight &quot;foxy&quot; character typical of many hybrids.

==History==

Aurore was created by the French viticulturist Albert Seibel, working from grapes varieties grown at his nursery and vineyard in Aubenas, Ardèche in the Rhône Valley. Seibel named the variety after Aurora, the Roman goddess of the dawn who according to legend would announce the arrival of the sun every morning. The name Aurora, itself, is derived from the Latin word for dawn and is today still used as a synonym for Aurore.

The grape was originally bred to be a table grape variety but fell out of favor for table grape growers due to how quickly the freshly picked grapes spoiled and the tendency of berries to fall off the stem in transit.

Aurore was first introduced to the United States, via Ellis Island, in the 1940s and from New York spread throughout the country. Soon it was the most widely planted non-&quot;Vitis labrusca&quot; grape variety in New York but since the 1970s its numbers have declined as growers began planting more &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; and other hybrid varieties.

The first plantings of Aurore in Canada were planted in 1946.

===Pedigree===
Aurore is known as a &quot;complex hybrid&quot;, meaning that within its lineage are grape varieties from a number of species in the Vitis genus--including &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot;, &quot;Vitis rupestris&quot; and &quot;Vitis lincecumii&quot;. The two parent varieties of Aurore, Seibel 788 &amp; Seibel 29, were also Seibel grapes with complex pedigrees themselves.

Seibel 788 was a crossing of the two hybrid varieties Sicilien and Clairette Dorée Ganzin. Sicilien is a crossing of two &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; varieties, Bicane and Pascal blanc, while Clairette Dorée Ganzin was an interspecific crossing produced by French grape breeder Victor Ganzin. The two parents of Clairette Dorée Ganzin were the &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; variety Bourboulenc and the hybrid Ganzin 60 (itself a cross of Aramon noir and a &quot;Vitis rupestris&quot; variety).

Seibel 29 is a crossing of an unknown &quot;Vitis vinifera&quot; variety and the Munson hybrid grape (also known as Jaeger 70) that was created by the Missouri viticulturist Hermann Jaeger. Munson is a crossing of a &quot;Vitis lincecumii&quot; and &quot;Vitis rupestris&quot; vine.

==Viticulture==

While classified as a white grape varieties and only used to produce white wines, clusters of Aurore blanc often will have a pink tinge to them (similar to Pinot gris and Gewürztraminer though not as dark as those two varieties can be). Aurore is known to be a very vigorous and productive vine, capable of producing high yields and expansive foliage if not kept in check with winter pruning and summer leaf-pulling. It is a very early ripening variety, coming to full ripeness even before varieties such as Chasselas in cold climates.

The variety is moderately winter-hardy, able to sustain winter freezes down to . While Aurore has good resistance to downy mildew, the variety is very susceptible to the viticultural hazards of Eutypa dieback, powdery mildew, black rot and botrytis bunch rot. The smooth leaves of the vine also makes it susceptible to angular leaf scorch as well as infestation from the invasive Japanese beetle. Growers practicing organic viticulture will often use diatomaceous earth as a dusting spray to help deter the beetle but this method is only effective if the dust comes into direct contact with the beetle and gets easily washed off by rains.

Aurore berries can be very thin skinned and prone to splitting if rainfall happens too close to harvest. Very mature berries also have a tendency of falling off the stem.

==Wine regions==
While Aurore originated in France and in the early 20th century had around 288 hectares (712 acres) planted in the northeastern reaches of the country and in the southwest, today it is hardly found in France. Outside France it is found in several states in the United States (most notably the cool-climate states of Minnesota, New York, New Hampshire and Nebraska). In 2009, wine producers in New York crushed 3,530 tons of the Aurore for both blended and varietal white wine. In New Hampshire, Jewell Towne Vineyards is noted for producing an Aurore varietal.

Other states in the US with plantings of Aurore include: Connecticut, Indiana, Kansas, Massachusetts, Michigan (in the Leelanau Peninsula AVA), Missouri, New Mexico, Ohio (in the Lake Erie AVA), Pennsylvania, Washington (in the Puget Sound AVA), West Virginia and Wisconsin.

In Canada, Aurore was once widely planted throughout British Columbia but since the 1980s have seen its number of plantings drop drastically along with other hybrid varieties as producers in regions such as the Okanagan Valley transition away from hybrid varieties to international varieties such as Pinot noir and Chardonnay. In Ontario, between 2007 and 2012 around 200 tons of Aurore in total was crushed in the province as the numbers of plantings there also decline. In Québec, producers such as Domaine des Côtes d&#x27;Ardoise are still producing varietal examples of Aurore.

==Styles==
Aurore is used to produce a wide range of both blended and varietal white wine styles at a variety of sweetness levels from dry to off-dry. Some producers also use the grape to make sparkling wine. While the grape does not travel well for commercial table grape production, it can be a favorite eating grape for home gardeners due to its soft, juicy flesh.

According to Master of Wine Jancis Robinson, Aurore tends to produce light-bodied floral wines that are relatively neutral in flavor but often exhibit the characteristic &quot;foxy&quot; note typical of many hybrids. This &quot;foxy&quot; aroma note tends to be more pronounced from examples produced in the eastern United States than in the west. Very ripe examples of Aurore also tend to exhibit more &quot;foxy&quot; flavors.

==Synonyms and confusion with other grapes==
Over the years Aurore has been known under a variety of synonyms including Aurora, Feri Szőlő, Finánc Szőlő, Redei, S-5279, and Seibel 5279.

Aurore is often confused with a South American table grape known as &quot;Aurora&quot; that was produced at the Instituto Agronomico de Campinas in Brazil. This confusion stems in part to Aurore&#x27;s history of being originally bred to be a table grape itself and Aurora being one of the known synonyms for the Seibel wine grape.

<doc id="262861" wikidata="Q190983" url="?curid=262861" title="Zeroth law of thermodynamics">
<text>The zeroth law of thermodynamics is one of the four principal laws of thermodynamics. It provides an independent definition of temperature without reference to entropy, which is defined in the second law. The law was established by Ralph H. Fowler in the 1930s, long after the first, second, and third laws had been widely recognized.

The zeroth law states that if two thermodynamic systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third system, then the two systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other.

Two systems are said to be in thermal equilibrium if they are linked by a wall permeable only to heat, and they do not change over time.

Another formulation by James Clerk Maxwell is &quot;All heat is of the same kind&quot;. Another statement of the law is &quot;All diathermal walls are equivalent&quot;.

The zeroth law is important for the mathematical formulation of thermodynamics. It makes the relation of thermal equilibrium between systems an equivalence relation, which can represent equality of some quantity associated with each system. A quantity that is the same for two systems, if they can be placed in thermal equilibrium with each other, is a scale of temperature. The zeroth law is needed for the definition of such scales, and justifies the use of practical thermometers.

==Equivalence relation==
A thermodynamic system is by definition in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, that is to say, there is no change in its observable state (i.e. macrostate) over time and no flows occur in it. One precise statement of the zeroth law is that the relation of thermal equilibrium is an equivalence relation on pairs of thermodynamic systems. In other words, the set of all systems each in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium may be divided into subsets in which every system belongs to one and only one subset, and is in thermal equilibrium with every other member of that subset, and is not in thermal equilibrium with a member of any other subset. This means that a unique &quot;tag&quot; can be assigned to every system, and if the &quot;tags&quot; of two systems are the same, they are in thermal equilibrium with each other, and if different, they are not. This property is used to justify the use of empirical temperature as a tagging system. Empirical temperature provides further relations of thermally equilibrated systems, such as order and continuity with regard to &quot;hotness&quot; or &quot;coldness&quot;, but these are not implied by the standard statement of the zeroth law.

If it is defined that a thermodynamic system is in thermal equilibrium with itself (i.e., thermal equilibrium is reflexive), then the zeroth law may be stated as follows:

This statement asserts that thermal equilibrium is a left-Euclidean relation between thermodynamic systems. If we also define that every thermodynamic system is in thermal equilibrium with itself, then thermal equilibrium is also a reflexive relation. Binary relations that are both reflexive and Euclidean are equivalence relations. Thus, again implicitly assuming reflexivity, the zeroth law is therefore often expressed as a right-Euclidean statement:

One consequence of an equivalence relationship is that the equilibrium relationship is symmetric: If &quot;A&quot; is in thermal equilibrium with &quot;B&quot;, then &quot;B&quot; is in thermal equilibrium with &quot;A&quot;. Thus, the two systems are in thermal equilibrium with each other, or they are in mutual equilibrium. Another consequence of equivalence is that thermal equilibrium is described as a transitive relation:

A reflexive, transitive relation does not guarantee an equivalence relationship. For the above statement to be true, &quot;both&quot; reflexivity &quot;and&quot; symmetry must be implicitly assumed.

It is the Euclidean relationships which apply directly to thermometry. An ideal thermometer is a thermometer which does not measurably change the state of the system it is measuring. Assuming that the unchanging reading of an ideal thermometer is a valid tagging system for the equivalence classes of a set of equilibrated thermodynamic systems, then the systems are in thermal equilibrium, if a thermometer gives the same reading for each system. If the system are thermally connected, no subsequent change in the state of either one can occur. If the readings are different, then thermally connecting the two systems causes a change in the states of both systems. The zeroth law provides no information regarding this final reading.

==Foundation of temperature==

Nowadays, there are two nearly separate concepts of temperature, the thermodynamic concept, and that of the kinetic theory of gases and other materials.

The zeroth law belongs to the thermodynamic concept, but this is no longer the primary international definition of temperature. The current primary international definition of temperature is in terms of the kinetic energy of freely moving microscopic particles such as molecules, related to temperature through the Boltzmann constant formula_1. The present article is about the thermodynamic concept, not about the kinetic theory concept.

The zeroth law establishes thermal equilibrium as an equivalence relationship. An equivalence relationship on a set (such as the set of all systems each in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium) divides that set into a collection of distinct subsets (&quot;disjoint subsets&quot;) where any member of the set is a member of one and only one such subset. In the case of the zeroth law, these subsets consist of systems which are in mutual equilibrium. This partitioning allows any member of the subset to be uniquely &quot;tagged&quot; with a label identifying the subset to which it belongs. Although the labeling may be quite arbitrary, temperature is just such a labeling process which uses the real number system for tagging. The zeroth law justifies the use of suitable thermodynamic systems as thermometers to provide such a labeling, which yield any number of possible empirical temperature scales, and justifies the use of the second law of thermodynamics to provide an absolute, or thermodynamic temperature scale. Such temperature scales bring additional continuity and ordering (i.e., &quot;hot&quot; and &quot;cold&quot;) properties to the concept of temperature.

In the space of thermodynamic parameters, zones of constant temperature form a surface, that provides a natural order of nearby surfaces. One may therefore construct a global temperature function that provides a continuous ordering of states. The dimensionality of a surface of constant temperature is one less than the number of thermodynamic parameters, thus, for an ideal gas described with three thermodynamic parameters &quot;P&quot;, &quot;V&quot; and &quot;N&quot;, it is a two-dimensional surface.

For example, if two systems of ideal gases are in joint thermodynamic equilibrium across an immovable diathermal wall, then = where &quot;Pi&quot; is the pressure in the &quot;i&quot;th system, &quot;Vi&quot; is the volume, and &quot;Ni&quot; is the amount (in moles, or simply the number of atoms) of gas.

The surface = constant defines surfaces of equal thermodynamic temperature, and one may label defining &quot;T&quot; so that = &quot;RT&quot;, where &quot;R&quot; is some constant. These systems can now be used as a thermometer to calibrate other systems. Such systems are known as &quot;ideal gas thermometers&quot;.

In a sense, focused on the zeroth law, there is only one kind of diathermal wall or one kind of heat, as expressed by Maxwell&#x27;s dictum that &quot;All heat is of the same kind&quot;. But in another sense, heat is transferred in different ranks, as expressed by Arnold Sommerfeld&#x27;s dictum &quot;Thermodynamics investigates the conditions that govern the transformation of heat into work. It teaches us to recognize temperature as the measure of the work-value of heat. Heat of higher temperature is richer, is capable of doing more work. Work may be regarded as heat of an infinitely high temperature, as unconditionally available heat.&quot; This is why temperature is the particular variable indicated by the zeroth law&#x27;s statement of equivalence.

==Dependence on the existence of walls permeable only to heat==
In Constantin Carathéodory&#x27;s (1909) theory, it is postulated that there exist walls &quot;permeable only to heat&quot;, though heat is not explicitly defined in that paper. This postulate is a physical postulate of existence. It does not say that there is only one kind of heat. This paper of Carathéodory states as proviso 4 of its account of such walls: &quot;Whenever each of the systems &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;S&quot;2 is made to reach equilibrium with a third system &quot;S&quot;3 under identical conditions, systems &quot;S&quot;1 and &quot;S&quot;2 are in mutual equilibrium&quot;.

It is the function of this statement in the paper, not there labeled as the zeroth law, to provide not only for the existence of transfer of energy other than by work or transfer of matter, but further to provide that such transfer is unique in the sense that there is only one kind of such wall, and one kind of such transfer. This is signaled in the postulate of this paper of Carathéodory that precisely one non-deformation variable is needed to complete the specification of a thermodynamic state, beyond the necessary deformation variables, which are not restricted in number. It is therefore not exactly clear what Carathéodory means when in the introduction of this paper he writes

It is possible to develop the whole theory without assuming the existence of heat, that is of a quantity that is of a different nature from the normal mechanical quantities.
It is the opinion of Elliott H. Lieb and Jakob Yngvason (1999) that the derivation from statistical mechanics of the law of entropy increase is a goal that has so far eluded the deepest thinkers. Thus the idea remains open to consideration that the existence of heat and temperature are needed as coherent primitive concepts for thermodynamics, as expressed, for example, by Maxwell and Max Planck. On the other hand, Planck (1926) clarified how the second law can be stated without reference to heat or temperature, by referring to the irreversible and universal nature of friction in natural thermodynamic processes.

==History==
Writing long before the term &quot;zeroth law&quot; was coined, in 1871 Maxwell discussed at some length ideas which he summarized by the words &quot;All heat is of the same kind&quot;. Modern theorists sometimes express this idea by postulating the existence of a unique one-dimensional &quot;hotness manifold&quot;, into which every proper temperature scale has a monotonic mapping. This may be expressed by the statement that there is only one kind of temperature, regardless of the variety of scales in which it is expressed. Another modern expression of this idea is that &quot;All diathermal walls are equivalent&quot;. This might also be expressed by saying that there is precisely one kind of non-mechanical, non-matter-transferring contact equilibrium between thermodynamic systems.

According to Sommerfeld, Ralph H. Fowler coined the term &quot;zeroth law of thermodynamics&quot; while discussing the 1935 text by Meghnad Saha and B.N. Srivastava.

They write on page 1 that &quot;every physical quantity must be measurable in numerical terms&quot;. They presume that temperature is a physical quantity and then deduce the statement &quot;If a body is in temperature equilibrium with two bodies and , then and themselves are in temperature equilibrium with each other&quot;. Then they italicize a self-standing paragraph, as if to state their basic postulate:

They do not themselves here use the phrase &quot;zeroth law of thermodynamics&quot;.
There are very many statements of these same physical ideas in the physics literature long before this text, in very similar language. What was new here was just the label &quot;zeroth law of thermodynamics&quot;.

Fowler &amp; Guggenheim (1936/1965) wrote of the zeroth law as follows:

They then proposed that

The first sentence of this present article is a version of this statement. It is not explicitly evident in the existence statement of Fowler and Edward A. Guggenheim that temperature refers to a unique attribute of a state of a system, such as is expressed in the idea of the hotness manifold. Also their statement refers explicitly to statistical mechanical assemblies, not explicitly to macroscopic thermodynamically defined systems.

<text>Baco noir (pronounced BA-koh NWAHR) is a hybrid red wine grape variety produced by Francois Baco from a cross of &quot;Vitis vinifera var.&quot; Folle blanche, a French wine grape, and an unknown variety of &quot;Vitis riparia&quot; indigenous to North America.

==Regions==
In 1951 the variety was brought to the cooler viticulture regions of North America, such as British Columbia, Ontario, Nova Scotia, New York, Michigan, Mississippi, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania and Oregon. In 1955 the variety was brought back to Canada, where the &quot;George&quot; clonal variety is commonly used. Baco noir was the target of a vine-pull program in Canada in the early 1980s, which means that there are few older plots of this variety left in Canada. 

Some of the oldest Baco Noir vineyards in Ontario were shovel-planted by Henry of Pelham Winery’s co-founders, Paul, Matt, and Daniel Speck, in 1984 in the Short Hills Bench of the Niagara Peninsula. As pioneers of Ontario’s Baco Noir, the Speck Brothers have been instrumental in the varietal’s rise, championing it as a signature grape of the region. Their commitment to Baco Noir has led to widespread success, producing bold, complex wines that have become integral to Henry of Pelham’s portfolio and the Niagara wine identity.

Oregon&#x27;s first Baco noir vines were imported by Philippe Girardet in 1971 for his winery located in the Umpqua Valley.

This variety is also grown in certain parts of Colorado as vineyard area expands beyond the traditional AVAs of Colorado and across the Front Range.

<text>A prill is a small aggregate or globule of a material, most often a dry sphere, formed from a melted liquid through spray crystallization.

Prilled is a term used in mining and manufacturing to refer to a product that has been pelletized. ANFO explosive typically comprises ammonium nitrate prills mixed with #2 fuel oil. The pellets are a neater, simpler form for handling, with reduced dust. 

The material to be prilled must be in a solid state at room temperature and a low-viscosity liquid when melted. Prills are formed by allowing drops of the melted prill substance to congeal or freeze in mid-air after being dripped from the top of a tall prilling tower. Certain agrochemicals such as urea are often supplied in prilled form. Fertilizers (ammonium nitrate, urea, NPK fertilizer) and some detergent powders are commonly manufactured as prills. However prilling of ammonium nitrate and urea has in recent years been replaced by fluid bed granulation as this gives strong and more abrasion-resistant granules.

Melted material may also be atomized and then allowed to form smaller prills that are useful in cosmetics, food, and animal feed.

<text>In the history of Germany, the Kulturkampf (Cultural Struggle) was the seven-year political conflict (1871–1878) between the Catholic Church in Germany led by Pope Pius IX and the Kingdom of Prussia led by chancellor Otto von Bismarck. The Prussian church-and-state political conflict was about the church&#x27;s direct control over both education and ecclesiastical appointments in the Prussian kingdom as a Roman Catholic nation and country. Moreover, when compared to other church-and-state conflicts about political culture, the &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; of Prussia also featured anti-Polish sentiment.

In modern political usage, the German term &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; describes any conflict (political, ideological, or social) between the secular government and the religious authorities of a society. The term also describes the great and small culture wars among political factions who hold deeply opposing values and beliefs within a nation, a community, and a cultural group.

== Background ==

=== Europe and the Catholic Church ===

The philosophic influences of The Enlightenment, Scientific realism, Positivism, Materialism, nationalism, secularism, and Liberalism impinged upon and ended the intellectual and political roles of religion and the Catholic Church, which then was the established church of Europe, excluding Scandinavia, Russia, the Netherlands, Great Britain, and, crucially, Prussia. By way of the legislated separation of church and state, the Age of Reason reduced society&#x27;s financial debts to the Church and rendered secular the public sphere of society, and established the state&#x27;s supremacy concerning the content and administration of public education for all of society. During the Age of Reason in the 17th and the 18th centuries, the European &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; principally occurred in the regional and local politics of a society, especially in cities and towns where the educated populations were politically Liberal and practised the politics of anti-clericalism and of anti-Catholicism.

The Catholic Church resisted such intellectual progress, which was portrayed as an attack on religion in an effort to maintain and strengthen the Church&#x27;s strong political role in the affairs of the state and society. With the growing influence of enlightenment and after having lost much of its wealth, power, and influence in the course of the mediatization and secularization of the early 19th century, the Church had been in a state of decline.

The papacy was at a weak point in its history, having lost all its territories to Italy, with the pope a &quot;prisoner&quot; in the Vatican. The Church strove to regain its influence and to hold sway in such matters as marriage, family, and education. It initiated a Catholic revival by founding associations, papers, schools, social establishments and new orders, and encouraging religious practices such as pilgrimages, mass assemblies, devotion to the Virgin Mary or the Sacred Heart of Jesus, and the veneration of relics; the pope himself became an object of devotion. 

Apart from the growth in religious orders, the 19th century was a time when numerous Catholic associations and organisations were founded, especially in Germany and in France (In the United States, there was a comparable rise in fraternal organizations in the late nineteenth century.). Catholic propaganda, including the interpretation of daily events, was promoted through local and national Catholic newspapers that were prominent in all western European nations. In addition, organized missions and groups were dedicated to producing pious literature.

In the 19th century, the popes issued a series of encyclicals (such as (1832) by Pope Gregory XVI) condemning liberalism and freedom of the press. These generated controversy in some quarters. Under the leadership of Gregory&#x27;s successor, Pope Pius IX, the church proclaimed Mary&#x27;s Immaculate Conception in 1854. In 1864, Pius published the encyclical with its appended (&quot;Syllabus of Errors&quot;), and in 1870 convened the First Vatican Council. The Council, in turn, proclaimed the dogma of papal infallibility.

In , the Church condemned as false some 80 philosophical and political statements, mainly the foundations of the modern nation-state. It rejected outright such concepts as freedom of religion, separation of church and state, civil marriage, sovereignty of the people, liberalism and socialism, reason as the sole base of human action, and in general condemned the idea of conciliation with progress. The announcements included an index of forbidden books.

The Church gradually re-organized and began to use mass media expansively to promote its messages. In addition, the popes worked to increase their control of the Church. The Church centralized some functions and streamlined its hierarchy, which prompted strong criticism by European governments. The bishops sought direction from the Vatican, and the needs and views of the international church were given priority over the local ones. Opponents of the new hierarchical church organization pejoratively called it ultramontanism.

In view of the church&#x27;s opposition to enlightenment, liberal reforms, and the revolutions of the 18th/19th centuries, these dogmas and the church&#x27;s expressed insistence on papal primacy angered the liberal-minded across Europe, even among some Catholics. Debates were heated.

The dogmas were perceived as threatening the secularized state, as they reaffirmed that the fundamental allegiance of Catholics was not to their nation-state, but to the Gospel and the Church. The pope&#x27;s teaching was promoted as absolutely authoritative and binding on all the faithful. Secular politicians wondered whether &quot;Catholicism and allegiance to the modern liberal state were not mutually exclusive&quot;. British Prime Minister Gladstone wrote in 1874 that the teaching on papal infallibility compromised the allegiance of faithful English Catholics. For European liberalism, the dogmas were perceived as a declaration of war against the modern state, science, and spiritual freedom.

The pope&#x27;s handling of dissent from the dogmas, e.g. by excommunication of critics or demanding their removal from schools and universities, was considered as the &quot;epitome of papal authoritarianism&quot;.
In direct response to the Vatican&#x27;s announcements, Austria passed the so-called May Laws for Cisleithania in 1868, restricting the Concordat of 1855, and then cancelled the Concordat altogether in 1870.
Saxony and Bavaria withheld approval to publish the papal infallibility dogma; Hesse and Baden even denied it any legal validity. France refused to publish the doctrines altogether; Spain forbade publication of in 1864.

=== Germany ===

==== Pre-1871 ====

By the mid-19th century, liberal policies had also come to dominate Germany and the separation of church and state became a prominent issue. The in Prussia is usually bracketed by the years 1871 and 1878 with the Catholic Church officially announcing its end in 1880 but the struggle in Germany had been an ongoing matter without definite beginning and the years 1871 to 1878 only mark its culmination in Prussia.

In the wake of other European countries, most German states had taken the first steps in secularisation well before unification. Predominantly Catholic Baden was at the forefront of curbing the power of the Catholic Church, as in the Baden Church Dispute (1852–1854) and the (1864–1876). Other examples are Prussia (1830s, 1850, 1859, and 1969), Württemberg (1859/1862), Bavaria (&quot;&quot;, 1867), Hesse-Nassau or Hesse-Darmstadt.

In the 1837 () of legal and policy issues regarding the children of mixed Protestant-Catholic marriages, Prussia&#x27;s final settlement was considered a defeat for the state as it had given in to demands of the Catholic Church. In 1850, Prussia again had a dispute with the church about civil marriage and primary schools and in 1852, it issued decrees against the Jesuits.
As in many European countries, Jesuits were being banned or heavily restricted in many of the German states e.g. in Saxony (1831) or Württemberg (1862), and even in Catholic ones such as Bavaria (1851) and Baden (1860).

Not to be left out, the German areas to the west of the Rhine had already gone through a process of separation of church and state in line with a radical secularization after annexation by revolutionary and Napoleonic France in 1794. After their return to Germany in 1814, many if not most of the changes were kept in place.

In the period, Catholic publications usually portrayed revolutions as negative and dangerous to the existing order as well as to the interests of the Catholic Church. Most of them considered a viable Catholicism to be necessary for the very health of society and state and to be the only true and effective protection against the scourge of revolution.
The unsuccessful German revolutions of 1848–49, which the Catholic Church had opposed, produced no democratic reforms and attempts to radically disentangle state-church relationships failed. In the revolutionary parliament, many prominent representatives of political Catholicism took the side of the extreme right-wingers. In the years following the revolution, Catholicism became increasingly politicized due to rising liberal ideologies contrasted with the anti-modernist and anti-liberal policies of the Vatican.

In the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and Franco-Prussian War of 1870 the Catholic Church sided against Prussia and it was an outspoken opponent of German unification under Prussia (as well as of Italy&#x27;s unification).

The Catholic dogmas and doctrines announced in 1854, 1864 and 1870 were perceived in Germany as direct attacks on the modern nation state. Thus, Bismarck, the Liberals and the Conservatives representing orthodox Protestants found the Centre Party&#x27;s support of the pope highly provocative. Many Catholics shared these sentiments, especially against the pope&#x27;s declared infallibility and the majority of Catholic German bishops deemed the definition of the dogma as &quot;&#x27;unpropitious&#x27; in light of the situation in Germany&quot;. While most Catholics eventually reconciled themselves to the doctrine, some founded the small breakaway Old Catholic Church.

According to the Bavarian head of government, Hohenlohe, the dogma of infallibility compromised the Catholic&#x27;s loyalty to the state. He sent a circular to all the diplomatic representatives of the Bavarian Kingdom saying, &quot;The only dogmatic thesis which Rome desires to have decided by the Council, and which the Jesuits in Italy and Germany are now agitating, is the question of the Infallibility of the Pope. This pretension once become a dogma, will have a wider scope than the purely spiritual spheres, and will become evidently a political question: for it will raise the power of the Sovereign Pontiff, even in temporal matters, above all the princes and peoples of Christendom.&quot;

The liberal majorities in the Imperial Diet and the Prussian parliament as well as liberals in general regarded the Church as backward, a hotbed for reactionaries, enemies of progress and cast monastic life as the epitome of a backward Catholic medievalism. They were alarmed by the dramatic rise in the numbers of monasteries, convents and clerical religious groups in an era of widespread religious revival. The Diocese of Cologne, for example, saw a tenfold increase of monks and nuns between 1850 and 1872. Prussian authorities were particularly suspicious of the spread of monastic life among the Polish and French minorities.
The Church, in turn, saw the National-Liberals as its worst enemy, accusing them of spearheading the war against Christianity and the Catholic Church.

==== 1871–72 ====
At unification in 1871, the new German Empire included 25.5 million Protestants (62% of the population) and 15 million Catholics (36.5% of the population). Although a minority in the empire, Catholics were the majority in the states of Bavaria, Baden, and Alsace-Lorraine as well as in the four Prussian Provinces of West Prussia, Posen, Rhineland, Westphalia and in the Prussian region of Upper Silesia. Since the Thirty Years&#x27; War the population was generally segregated along religious lines and rural areas or towns were overwhelmingly if not entirely of the same religion. Education was also separate and usually in the hands of the churches. There was little mutual tolerance, interaction or intermarriage. Protestants in general were deeply distrustful of the Catholic Church.

Unification had been achieved through many obstacles with strong opponents. These were the European powers of France and Austria, both Catholic nations, and the Catholic Church itself, the three of which Bismarck perceived as &quot;Coalition of Catholic Revenge&quot;. For Bismarck, the empire was very fragile and its consolidation was an important issue. Biographer Otto Pflanze notes that &quot;all of these developments, real and imagined, reinforced Bismarck&#x27;s belief in the existence of a widespread Catholic conspiracy that posed a threat to both his German and European policies.&quot;

In a Protestant empire, the Catholic Church was to lose its good standing which it had enjoyed for centuries in the Catholic-dominated Holy Roman Empire and which it would have continued to enjoy in a German empire united under Austrian auspices. Thus, in 1870, on the eve of unification, the Center Party was explicitly founded to defend the position of the church in the new empire.

Bismarck was highly concerned that many major members and supporters of this new party were not in sympathy with the new empire: the House of Hanover, the ethnic minority of the Poles, the southern German states. In 1871, the predominantly Catholic states of Southern Germany had only reluctantly joined the empire, increasing the overall share of the Catholic population to 36.5%. Among this Catholic share was Germany&#x27;s largest ethnic minority, well over 2 million Poles in the east of Prussia, who under Prussia and Germany suffered discrimination and oppression. Bismarck regarded the new Centre Party not only as an illegal mixup of politics and religion and the church&#x27;s &quot;long arm&quot; but also as a unifying force for Catholic Germans and Poles and thus a threat to the consolidation of the empire. He feared that the Centre Party would frustrate his broader political agendas and he accused the Catholic priests of fostering Polish nationalism as had been done openly in the provinces of Posen and Upper Silesia.

The Liberals regarded the Catholic Church as a powerful force of reaction and anti-modernity, especially after the proclamation of papal infallibility in 1870 and the tightening control of the Vatican over the local bishops. The renewed vitality of Catholicism in Germany with its mass gatherings also attracted Protestants – even the heir to the Prussian throne, with the king&#x27;s approval, attended one. Anti-liberalism, anti-clericalism, and anti-Catholicism became powerful intellectual forces of the time and the antagonism between Liberals and Protestants on one side and the Catholic Church on the other was fought out through mud-slinging in the press. A wave of anti-Catholic, anticlerical and anti-monastic pamphleteering in the liberal press was answered by anti-liberal preaching and propaganda in Catholic newspapers and vice versa.

For these reasons, the government sought to wean the Catholic masses away from the hierarchy and the Centre Party and the liberals&#x27; demands to curb the power of the churches meshed well with Bismarck&#x27;s main political objective to crush the Centre Party.
According to historian Anthony J. Steinhoff:Bismarck&#x27;s plan to disarm political Catholicism delighted liberal politicians, who provided the parliamentary backing for the crusade. Yet, the phrase the left-liberal Rudolf Virchow coined for this struggle, the , suggests that the liberals wanted to do more than prevent Catholicism from becoming a political force. They wanted victory over Catholicism itself, the long-delayed conclusion of the Reformation.At least since 1847 and in line with the Liberals, Bismarck had also been of the professed opinion, that state and church should be completely separated and &quot;the sphere of the state had to be made secure against the incursions by the church&quot;, although his ideas were not as far-reaching as in the United States or in Great Britain. He had in mind the traditional position of the Protestant church in Prussia and provoked considerable resistance from conservative Protestants. This became clear in a heated debate with Prussian culture minister von Mühler in 1871 when Bismarck said: &quot;Since you stopped my plans in the Protestant church, I have to go via Rome.&quot; In August 1871, at Bad Ems, Bismarck revealed his intention to fight against the Centre Party, to separate state and church, to transfer school inspection to laymen, to abolish religious instruction from schools and to transfer religious affairs to the minister of justice.

On 22 January 1872, liberal Adalbert Falk replaced conservative Heinrich von Mühler as Prussian minister for religion, education and health. In Bismarck&#x27;s mind, Falk was &quot;to re-establish the rights of the state in relation to the church&quot;. Yet, unlike Bismarck, whose main motivation for the was the political power struggle with the Centre Party, Falk, a lawyer, was a strong proponent of state authority having in mind the legal aspects of state-church relationships. Falk became the driving force behind the laws. Although Bismarck publicly supported Falk, he doubted the success of his laws and was unhappy with his lack of political tact and sensitivity. The differences in their attitudes concerning the eventually put the two politicians at odds with each other.

With this background and the determination of church and state, the in Germany acquired an additional edge as it gathered in intensity and bitterness.

== Timeline, 1871–76 ==

From 1871 to 1876, the Prussian state parliament and the federal legislature (), both with liberal majorities, enacted 22 laws in the context of the . They were mainly directed against clerics: bishops, priests and religious orders (anti-clerical) and enforced the supremacy of the state over the church. While several laws were specific to the Catholic Church (Jesuits, congregations etc.) the general laws affected both Catholic and Protestant churches.
In an attempt to overcome increasing resistance by the Catholic Church and its defiance of the laws, new regulations increasingly went beyond state matters referring to the purely internal affairs of the church. Even many liberals saw them as an encroachment on civil liberties, compromising their own credo.

Constitutionally, education and regulation of religious affairs were vested in the federal states and the leading actor of the was Prussia, Germany&#x27;s largest state. However, some of the laws were also passed by the Reichstag and applied to all of Germany. In general, the laws did not affect the press and associations including Catholic ones.

=== 1871 ===
* 8 June: Fusion of Catholic and Protestant sections in the Prussian Ministry of Culture (responsible for religious matters). The Catholic section had been installed in 1840. The reason given for the merger was, that &quot;the exclusively political attitude of equal justice to all&quot; was to be adopted and that for that purpose one ecclesiastical department was required. The merger was also a precondition for the &quot;School Supervision Act&quot; of the following year.
* 10 December: Passing of the Pulpit Law () at the initiative of Bavaria and meant to curb what was considered the misuse of religious sermons for political agitation from the pulpit. The law read: &quot;Any cleric or other minister of religion shall be punished with imprisonment or incarceration of up to two years if he, while exercising his occupation or having his occupation exercised, makes state affairs the subject of announcements or discussion either in public before a crowd, in a church, or before any number of people in some other place designated for religious gatherings in such a way that it endangers the public peace.&quot;

=== 1872 ===
* 22 January: Adalbert Falk became Prussian minister for spiritual, educational and health matters
* 11 March: Prussian (). This legislation was at the heart of the , abolishing church oversight of the Prussian primary school system (Catholic and Protestant), excluding the clergy from education and eliminating its influence in curricular matters. This was a milestone for liberalism, as placing education into the hands of the government had always been at the top of its agenda. Liberals believed it would create an open-minded and neutral system of education, seen as the prerequisite for a progressive society. In the eyes of Bismarck, this law was necessary after the church, putting itself in opposition to the state, used the schools to incite the young against the government.
* April: The Vatican rejected Gustav Adolf, Cardinal Prince of Hohenlohe-Schillingsfürst as German ambassador to the Holy See. Schillingsfürst had been critical of the infallibility dogma but eventually accepted the decision of the council. Therefore, Bismarck took him for a suitable mediator. In response to the rejection, the diplomatic mission was left vacant and Prussia suspended relations with the Vatican in December 1872.
* 4 July: German Empire, Jesuit Law banning of the Jesuits who were seen as the emissaries of Rome and the spearhead of ultramontanism. By acknowledging the supremacy of Papal authority, the Jesuits were accused of contesting the secular authority. The law allowed for the dissolution of all Jesuit chapters and expulsion of its members. The following year the law was extended to closely related orders: the Redemptorists, Lazarists, Fathers of the Holy Ghost, and the Ladies of the Sacred Heart. Continued and increasing Church resistance and contempt of the 1871/1872 laws led to changes in the constitution and the enactment of further laws. In order to facilitate these laws, the Prussian Constitution was amended.
* 20 September: The Prussian bishops, at a conference in Fulda, protested against the regulations hostile to the church.
* 23 December: The pope, in an address to his cardinals, denounced the new laws as persecution of the church.

=== 1873 ===

* 17 January: The term comes into use. Debating the law on education conditions for the employment of clerics, a Progressive deputy in the Prussian legislature – the distinguished medical scientist and pioneer of public health methods, Rudolf Virchow said: (&#x27;I am of the conviction that this is about a great cultural struggle&#x27;). He repeated this term in a call for a vote by the German Progress Party on 23 March 1873. It was ironically picked up and derided in the Catholic press and enthusiastically defended in the liberal.
* 30 January: While the laws were being debated in parliament, the Prussian bishops submit a protest against the planned legislation and in a memorial, they announced their opposition to the new laws.
* 5 April: Prussia, Amendment of Sections 15, 16 and 18 of the Prussian Constitution:
** In section 15 the sentence &quot;The Protestant and the Roman Catholic Church, as well as every other religious community, regulates and administers its affairs independently&quot; is supplemented by &quot;but remain subject to the laws of the state and its legally regulated superintendence&quot;. It is added, that the same applies to the possession or beneficial use of institutions for religion, teaching, charity, endowments and funds.
** Section 16, regarding the unrestricted dealings of religious communities with their seniors and public announcements according to general regulations was cancelled.
** Section 18 cancelled the state&#x27;s right to appoint, nominate, elect or confirm clerics for a post. But the amendment added, that the state could regulate the minimum education required for clerical posts, the appointment and dismissal of clergymen and servicemen of religion, and define the limits of ecclesiastical disciplinary measures.

* 2 May: The bishops issued a common pastoral letter explaining to the faithful the necessity to unanimously and passively resist these laws.
* 11–14 May: Four &quot;May Laws&quot; passed in 1873 and were enacted on 11–14 May that year.
* 26 May: The bishops issued another pastoral letter calling on the faithful to resist the new laws and informed the Prussian government that they would not cooperate in their execution. Parish councils declined to elect new pastors or accept parish administrators. Exiled or imprisoned bishops used underground networks. The bishops of Münster and Paderborn refused the for their seminaries and appointed priests without notifying authorities. Clergy obeying the mandate of the bishops immediately became subject to the punishments prescribed by the laws. Fines were imposed in hundreds of cases and the clerics resisted paying at which, in turn, the government resorted to force, either by confiscation or imprisonment of up to two years.
* 21 November: In his encyclical on the persecution of the Church in Italy, Germany, and Switzerland, the pope wrote of Germany &quot;No wonder, then, that the former religious tranquility has been gravely disturbed in that Empire by this kind of law and other plans and actions of the Prussian government most hostile to the Church. But who would wish to falsely cast the blame of this disturbance on the Catholics of the German Empire!&quot; He claimed that Freemasonry was the motivating force behind the .
==== May Laws ====
The Falk Laws, or &#x27;May Laws&#x27; (), were a set of laws passed by the Prussian parliament in the years 1873, 1874, and 1875. Four laws passed in 1873 were enacted on 11–14 May that year:
:1. Law on religious disaffiliation allowing a person to sever his connection with the church by simple declaration before a justice of the peace. This declaration freed him from all civil effects of belonging to a church, especially ecclesiastical burthens and dues.

:2. Law on ecclesiastical disciplinary measures restricting the exercise of ecclesiastical punishments and means of discipline directed against the life, property, freedom or honour of citizens. This included the infliction of the great excommunication if proclaimed with the name of the guilty, because of possible disturbances of civil and social intercourse. Thus, disciplinary measures were almost totally restricted to the spiritual realm (see state Monopoly on violence).

:3. Ecclesiastical disciplinary law concerning ecclesiastical power of discipline and the establishment of The Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs. This subordinated the Catholic Church to state jurisdiction not only in external but also in internal matters. The law regulated the exercise of disciplinary power by church authorities against their officers for special violation of their duties. Members of the court had to be Germans residing in Germany. Bodily chastisement by the Church was entirely forbidden, fines were limited to maximum amounts, restrictions of freedom could only consist in banishment to a church institution within Germany no longer than 3 months and not against the will of the person concerned. On the other hand, the new court also was given jurisdiction over ecclesiastical officers in violation of state laws.
:With this law, the German clergy was to be exempt from any juridical body outside of the nation. Hence, judgments of the Holy See or the Roman Rota would not be binding upon them. The highest court was made up of Prussian ecclesiastics, all appointed with the permission of Prussian civil authorities. The Church&#x27;s juridical and punitive powers were restricted by allowing clerics, e.g. those punished by the Church for not resisting the laws, to appeal to the Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs. Bishops in defiance of this law could be deposed.

:4. Education standards and civic registry law concerning the education and appointment of priests. Regarding the Protestant Church, these regulations had already been in force for a long time. All men intended for priesthood needed a graduate degree () from a German and study 3 years of theology at a German university.
:All appointments of clerics had to be approved by the state. Herewith, training and appointment of the clergy came under state supervision. The traditional regimen of clerical study was to be replaced by a modern education in a liberal German institution, thus ensuring that candidates to the priesthood were imbued with the spirit of secularism. Furthermore, ecclesiastical offices could only be filled with the permission of the highest civil authority in each province, essentially reviving the ancient practice of lay investiture.

=== 1874 ===
* 9 March: Prussian Civil Registry Law (birth, marriage, death). The same law was passed for the whole empire on 6 February 1875.
* 4 May: Imperial Expatriation Law was meant to curb the exercise of church duties by clerics without the required consent of authorities. The law stipulated, that in such cases, after a final conviction, a cleric would be banned from his parish or sent to another place within the empire and, in case of reoccurrence, that the cleric would be expatriated and expelled.
* 20 May: Prussian Law on the administration of vacant bishoprics. According to the law of 11 May 1873, administrators were to be elected for vacant bishoprics, authorizing laymen to assume administrative responsibilities at the parish level. This additional law stipulated that should an administrator not be elected according to the law, the property would be managed by a state superintendent.
* 13 July: In the town of Bad Kissingen, Eduard Kullmann attempted to assassinate Bismarck with a pistol, but only hit his hand. Kullmann cited church laws as the reason for his attempt; he was sentenced to 14 years of (correctional facilities with harsh forced labor). The assassination attempt led to an intensification of the measures.

=== 1875 ===
* 5 February: The encyclical declared that the May Laws were invalid, &quot;insofar as they totally oppose the divine order of the Church.&quot; The Catholic newspaper was the first to publish the whole text on the 18th of the same month in Germany. All the following papers publishing the encyclical were confiscated.
* 22 April: The Prussian Payment Law (Breadbasket Law) stopped government subsidies and payments for the Catholic bishoprics and clerics unless they signed a declaration of adherence to all laws.
* 31 May: Prussian Congregations Law dissolving all orders within 6 months except those involved in care for the infirm. For teaching orders, the time could be extended.
* 20 June: Prussian Church Finances Administration Law providing for a representation and a council elected by the parish for the administration of property.
* 4 July: Prussian Old-Catholic Church Entitlement Law giving Old-Catholic communities of a certain size the right to use Catholic churches and cemeteries.

=== 1876 ===
The last two laws passed in 1876 were of no practical importance:
* 26 February: The possible punishment for violation of the pulpit law was extended to publications.
* 7 June: The &quot;State Supervision Act&quot; provided for government supervision of all church assets in the Catholic dioceses in Prussia.

== Mitigation and Peace Laws, 1878–1887 ==

The political situation in Europe was very volatile. Initially perceived as a possible enemy hostile to German unification under Prussian leadership, Austria and Germany very quickly became friends and formed the Dual Alliance in 1879. The possibility of a war with France or Russia also became more remote. Therefore, social and economic problems moved to the fore and Bismarck&#x27;s attention gradually turned to other topics he deemed more threatening such as the increasing popularity of the socialists or more important such as questions of import duties. In these matters, he could either not rely on the support of the liberals to pursue his goals or they were not sufficient to form a majority.
Bismarck had not been comfortable with the increasing ferocity of the . Concerning the rise of the Centre Party, the laws had proven to be greatly ineffective and even counterproductive. He soon realized that they were of no help battling the Centre Party and as far as separation of state and church was concerned, he had achieved more than he wanted. 

In order to garner support for his Anti-Socialist Laws and protective trade tariffs, Bismarck turned his back on the liberals in search of new alliances. The death of Pius IX on 7 February 1878 opened the door for a settlement with the Catholic Church. The new pope, Leo XIII, was pragmatic and conciliatory. He expressed his wish for peace in a letter to the German emperor on the very day of his election, followed by a second letter in a similar vein that same year.

Bismarck and the Pope entered into direct negotiations without the participation of the Church or the , yet initially without much success. It came to pass that Falk, vehemently resented by Catholics, resigned on 14 July 1879, which could be read as a peace offering to the Vatican. A decisive boost only came in February 1880, when the Vatican unexpectedly agreed to the civic registry of clerics. As the slowly wound down the talks lead to a number of so-called mitigation and peace laws which were passed until 1887.

* 1880 July: The First Mitigation Law reallowed government payments to Prussian dioceses and freed the bishops from swearing allegiance to the Prussian laws. Hereupon, four new bishops were installed where sees had been left vacant after the death of the incumbents. Catholic associations involved in the care of the infirm were readmitted.
* 1882: Resumption of diplomatic relations between Prussia (not Germany) and the Vatican, which had been cut in 1872
* 1882 May 31: The Second Mitigation Law allowed the waiver of government exams for clerics
* 1883 July: The Third Mitigation Law legalized all religious actions of bishops and in certain cases, the king could pardon deposed bishops. 280 expelled clerics were pardoned.

On 29 September 1885, as another sign of peace, Bismarck proposed the Pope as arbiter in a dispute with Spain about the Caroline Islands and accepted his verdict in favour of Spain. In gratitude but to the great horror of Catholics, the Pope awarded Bismarck the Supreme Order of Christ, the highest order of chivalry to be granted by the Holy See. Bismarck was the only Protestant ever to receive this award.

After further negotiations between Prussia and the Vatican, the Prussian parliament passed 2 additional laws amending some of the laws.
* 1886 May 21: The First Peace Law amended some of the regulations in the education standards and civic registry law of 11 May 1873; state exams for clerics (waiver in Second Mitigation Law of 31 May 1882) were totally abolished. Episcopal-theological academies and seminaries, as well as theological studies at these institutions, were readmitted. Students were allowed to be quartered in Catholic boarding houses (). The state acknowledged papal disciplinary powers and abolished The Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs
* 1887 April 26: The Second Peace Law readmitted all orders except the Jesuits to Prussia
On 23 May 1887, the Pope declared &quot;The struggle which damaged the church and was of no good to the state is now over&quot;. The Mitigation and Peace Laws restored the inner autonomy of the Catholic church while leaving key regulations and the laws concerning separation of church and state in place (civic marriage, civic registry, religious disaffiliation, government school supervision, civic registry of clerics, ban of Jesuits, pulpit law, state supervision of church assets, constitutional amendments and the Catholic section in the Ministry of Culture was not reintroduced).

The respective opposing parties in the Reichstag harshly criticized the concessions made by the Vatican and the Prussian government.
Windthorst and the Centre Party were dismayed at being sidelined and not being consulted about the concessions the pope made, e.g. about the ban on Jesuits or the civil registry of clerics. None of the party&#x27;s major demands were met. Instead, the pope even sided with Bismarck on non-religious issues and pressured the Centre Party to support Bismarck or at least abstain, e.g. in the matter of the hotly debated 1887 (7-year military budget).
Many Liberals, especially Falk, objected to the concessions Bismarck made to the Church.

The growth of the Centre Party has been considered a major setback for Bismarck although never publicly conceded. Yet, in spite of strong Catholic representation in the Reichstag, the political power and influence of the Church in the public sphere and its political power was greatly reduced.

Although Germany and the Vatican were officially at peace after 1878, religious conflicts and tensions continued. At the turn of the century, Pope Pius X announced the encyclical , mounting new attacks on historical criticism of biblical texts and any accommodation of Catholicism to modern philosophy, sociology or literature. As of 1910, clerics had to take an oath against all forms of modernism, a requirement later extended to teachers of Catholic religion at schools and professors of Catholic theology resulting in intense political and public debates and new conflicts with the state.

== Effects and impact ==

The abolition of the Catholic section of the Prussian ministry of ecclesiastical and educational affairs deprived Catholics of their voice at the highest level. The system of strict government supervision of schools was applied only in Catholic areas; the Protestant schools were left alone. The school politics also alienated Protestant conservatives and churchmen.

The British ambassador Odo Russell reported to London in October 1872 how Bismarck&#x27;s plans were backfiring by strengthening the ultramontane (pro-papal) position inside German Catholicism:
:The German Bishops who were politically powerless in Germany and theologically in opposition to the Pope in Rome – have now become powerful political leaders in Germany and enthusiastic defenders of the now infallible Faith of Rome, united, disciplined, and thirsting for martyrdom, thanks to Bismarck&#x27;s uncalled for antiliberal declaration of War on the freedom they had hitherto peacefully enjoyed.

Nearly all German bishops, clergy and laymen rejected the legality of the new laws and were defiantly facing the increasingly heavy penalties, trials and imprisonments. As of 1878, only three of eight Prussian dioceses still had bishops, some 1,125 of 4,600 parishes were vacant, and nearly 1,800 priests ended up in jail or in exile, nearly half the monks and nuns had left Prussia, a third of the monasteries and convents were closed. Between 1872 and 1878, numerous Catholic newspapers were confiscated, Catholic associations and assemblies were dissolved, and Catholic civil servants were dismissed merely on the pretence of having Ultramontane sympathies. Thousands of laypeople were imprisoned for assisting priests to evade the punitive new laws.

The general ideological enthusiasm among the liberals for the was in contrast to Bismarck&#x27;s attitude towards the measures and growing disquiet from the Conservatives.

Apart from the outspoken criticism of the Laws by the Catholic Church and the Centre Party, there were also a number of Liberals and Protestants who voiced concern at least at the so-called (battle laws). &quot;Unease concerning the effects of his programme continued to spread among all but the most bigoted priest-haters and the most doctrinaire liberals&quot;.
Such noted critics outside the Catholic camp were Friedrich Heinrich Geffcken, Emil Albert Friedberg or Julius von Kirchmann. Although they were proponents of state superiority, they regarded some of the laws as either ineffective or as interference in internal church affairs and not consistent with liberal values. Geffcken wrote that &quot;with the intention to emancipate the laity from the hierarchy, the main body of the Catholics was brought in phalanx into the hands of leaders from which it was to be wrested. But the state cannot fight at length against a third of the population, it has no means to break such a passive resistance supported and organized by religious fanaticism. If a statesman desists from the correctness of a measure it only matters that he has the power to enforce it.&quot;
Even Bismarck – who initially saw a variety of tactical political advantages in these measures, e.g. for his suppressive policies against the Polish population – took pains to distance himself from the rigors of their enforcement.&quot;

The law considered the harshest and with no equivalent in Europe was the Expatriation Law. Passed by a liberal majority in parliament, it stipulated banishment as a punishment that all civilized peoples considered the harshest beyond the death penalty.

As to the Centre Party, these measures did not have the effect that Bismarck had in mind. In the state elections of November 1873, it grew from 50 to 90 seats and in the elections from 63 to 91. The number of Catholic periodicals also increased; in 1873 there were about 120.

The gave secularists and socialists an opportunity to attack all religions, an outcome that distressed the Protestant leaders and especially Bismarck himself, who was a devout pietistic Protestant.

In the face of systematic defiance, the Bismarck government increased the penalties and its attacks, and were challenged in 1875 when a papal encyclical declared that the entire ecclesiastical legislation of Prussia was invalid, and threatened to excommunicate any Catholic who obeyed. There was no violence, but the Catholics mobilized their support, set up numerous civic organizations, raised money to pay fines and rallied behind their church and the Center Party.

To Bismarck&#x27;s surprise, the Conservative Party — especially the Junkers from his own landowning class in East Prussia — sided with the Catholics. They were Protestants and did not like the Pope, but they had much in common with the Center Party. The Conservatives controlled their local schools and did not want bureaucrats from Berlin to take them over. They were hostile to the liberals, being fearful of free trade that would put them in competition with the United States and other grain exporters, and disliking their secular views. In the Prussian legislature, they sided with the Center Party on the school issue. Bismarck was livid, and he resigned the premiership of Prussia (while remaining Chancellor of the German Empire), telling an ally, &quot;in domestic affairs I have lost the ground that is for me acceptable through the unpatriotic treason of the Conservative Party in the Catholic question.&quot; Indeed, many of Bismarck&#x27;s conservative friends were in opposition. So too was William I, who was King of Prussia; he was strongly opposed to the civil marriage component of the .

The made Catholics more resolute; they responded not with violence but with votes, and as the newly formed Center Party became a major force in the Imperial Parliament, it gained support from non-Catholic minorities who felt threatened by Bismarck&#x27;s centralization of power.
In the long run, the most significant result was the mobilization of the Catholic voters through the Center Party, and their insistence on protecting their church. According to Margaret Anderson,
&quot;The effort was perceived, and not only by its opponents, as aiming at nothing less than the forcible assimilation of the Catholic Church and its adherents to the values and norms of the empire&#x27;s Protestant majority...[it led] Catholics – young and old, male and female, cleric and lay, big men and small – to cleave to their priests and defy the legislation.&quot;
After the Center party had doubled its popular vote in the elections of 1874, it became the second largest party in the national parliament, and remained a powerful force for the next 60 years. It became difficult for Bismarck to form a government without their support.
From the decades-long experience in battling against the , the Catholics of Germany learned democracy, according to Margaret Anderson. She states that the clergy:
:Acquired a pragmatic, but nonetheless real, commitment to democratic elections, parliamentary procedures, and party politics – commitments in which they schooled their flock, by their practice as much as by their preaching.&quot;

=== Anti-Polish aspect of Kulturkampf ===
Studies that analyze the nationalist aspect of Kulturkampf point out its anti-Polish character and Bismarck&#x27;s attempt to Germanize Polish provinces in the German Empire.
The Poles had already suffered from discrimination and numerous oppressive measures in Germany long before unification. These measures were intensified after the German Empire was formed and Bismarck was known to be particularly hostile towards the Poles. Christopher Clark argues that Prussian policy changed radically in the 1870s in the face of highly visible Polish support for France in the Franco-Prussian war. Polish demonstrations made clear the Polish nationalist feeling, and calls were also made for Polish recruits to desert from the Prussian Army – though these went unheeded. Bismarck was outraged, telling the Prussian cabinet in 1871: &quot;From the Russian border to the Adriatic Sea we are confronted with the combined propaganda of Slavs, ultramontanes, and reactionaries, and it is necessary openly to defend our national interests and our language against such hostile actions.&quot; Therefore, in the Province of Posen the took on a much more nationalistic character than in other parts of Germany.

Not an adamant supporter of the Liberals&#x27; general goals, Bismarck did recognize the potential in some of them for subduing Polish national aspirations and readily made use of it. While the Liberals&#x27; main objective was the separation of state and church as essential for a democratic and liberal society, Bismarck saw its use in separating the Polish population from the only supporter and guardian of its national identity.
Prussian authorities imprisoned 185 priests and forced hundreds of others into exile. Among the imprisoned was the Primate of Poland Archbishop Mieczysław Ledóchowski. A large part of the remaining Catholic priests had to continue their service in hiding from the authorities. Although most of the 185 imprisoned were finally set free by the end of the decade, those who were released emigrated. The anti-Polish aspects of the remained in place in Polish provinces of the German Empire until the First World War.

== in Austria ==

The in Austria has roots dating back to the 18th century. Emperor Joseph II launched a religious policy (later called &quot;Josephinism&quot;) that advocated the supremacy of the state in religious matters. This resulted in far-reaching state control over the Catholic Church, including the reorganization of dioceses, the regulation of the number of masses, the transfer of many schools into government hands, state-controlled seminaries, and the limitation of the number of clerics and the dissolution of numerous monasteries. Protests of Pope Pius VI, and even his visit to Vienna in 1782, were to no avail.
In the Concordat of 1855, which was the culmination of Catholic influence in Austria, many of the Catholic Church&#x27;s previous rights that had been taken away under Joseph II were restored (marriage, partial control of censorship, elementary and secondary education, full control of the clergy and religious funds).

In 1868 and 1869, after sanctioning from the December constitution, Emperor Francis Joseph&#x27;s newly appointed cabinet undid parts of the Concordat by way of several liberal reforms. These reforms are referred to as the May Laws. Against strong protests from the Catholic Church, the laws of 25 May 1868 and 14 May 1869 restored civil marriage, passed primary and secondary education into government hands, installed interconfessional schools, and regulated interconfessional relations (for example, mixed marriages and children&#x27;s rights to choose their faith).

In a secret consistory, Pope Pius IX condemned the constitution of 1867 and the May Laws as . In a pastoral letter dated 7 September 1868, bishop Franz-Josef Rudigier called for resistance to these May Laws. However, the letter was confiscated, and Rudigier had to appear before court on 5 June 1869. This event led to the first-ever public demonstrations by the Catholic population. On 12 July 1869, the bishop was sentenced to a jail term of two weeks, but he was later pardoned by the emperor.

The May Laws provoked a serious conflict between state and church. After the promulgation of papal infallibility in 1870, Austria abrogated the Concordat of 1855 and abolished it entirely in 1874. In May 1874, the Religious Act was officially recognized.

== in contemporary usage ==

=== United States ===
In the late 19th century, cultural wars arose over issues of prohibition and education in the United States. The Bennett Law was a highly controversial state law passed in Wisconsin in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools. Because Wisconsin German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large numbers of parochial schools where German was used in the classroom, it was bitterly resented by German-American (and some Norwegian) communities. Although the law was ultimately repealed, there were significant political repercussions, with the Republicans losing the governorship and the legislature, and the election of Democrats to the Senate and House of Representatives.

In the United States, the term &quot;culture war(s)&quot; has been used to refer to conflict in the late 20th and early 21st centuries between religious social conservatives and secular social liberals. This theme of &quot;culture war&quot; was the basis of Patrick Buchanan&#x27;s keynote speech at the 1992 Republican National Convention. It has also been used to refer to neoconservative reaction to the New Left and the ideological battles playing out in the country&#x27;s public schools.

Throughout the 1980s, there were battles in Congress and the media regarding federal support for the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment for the Humanities that amounted to a war over high culture between neoconservatives and paleoconservatives.
Justice Antonin Scalia referenced the term in the Supreme Court case &quot;Romer v. Evans&quot;, 517 U.S. 620 (1996), saying &quot;the Court has mistaken a for a fit of spite&quot;. The case concerned an amendment to the Colorado state constitution that prohibited any subdepartment from acting to protect individuals on the basis of sexual orientation. Scalia believed that the amendment was a valid move on the part of citizens who sought &quot;recourse to a more general and hence more difficult level of political decision making than others&quot;. The majority disagreed, holding that the amendment violated the Equal Protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment.

=== Israel ===
The term, translated to Hebrew as () is also frequently used, with similar connotations, in the political debates of Israel—having been introduced by Jews who fled Nazi Germany in the 1930s.

<text>De Chaunac is a French-American hybrid wine grape variety used to make red wines. It was developed by Albert Seibel c. 1860. It is also known as Seibel 9549 and is a cross of Seibel 5163 and possibly Seibel 793. The grape was named after Adhemar de Chaunac, a French-born Canadian wine pioneer in the Ontario wine industry.

De Chaunac is known to be early ripening, have a very vigorous growth habit and good resistance to both powdery mildew and downy mildew. It is grown in varying amounts for wine production across the northeastern side of North America, especially in the winegrowing regions of New York, Pennsylvania, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Michigan, Ohio, and other northeastern winegrowing areas.

<text>Major General Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, (; 30 January 1890 – 29 May 1968) was Chief of MI6, the British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS), from 1939 to 1952, during and after the Second World War.

==Early life, family==
Stewart Graham Menzies was born in England in 1890 into a wealthy family as the second son of John Graham Menzies and Susannah West Wilson, daughter of ship-owner Arthur Wilson of Tranby Croft. His grandfather, Graham Menzies, was a whisky distiller who helped establish a cartel and made huge profits. His parents became friends of King Edward VII. Menzies was a nephew of Scottish Liberal Party politician and member of the House of Commons Robert Stewart Menzies. But Menzies&#x27; father was dissolute, never established a worthwhile career, and wasted his share of the family fortune; he died of tuberculosis in 1911 in his early 50s, leaving only a minimal estate.

Menzies was educated at Eton College, becoming president of the student society Pop, and left in 1909. He excelled in sports, hunting and cross-country running. He won prizes for his studies of languages, and was considered an all-around excellent student.

==Early military career==

===Life Guards===
From Eton he joined the Grenadier Guards as a second lieutenant. After a year with this regiment, he transferred to the Second Life Guards. He was promoted to lieutenant and appointed adjutant by 1913.

===First World War action===
During the First World War Menzies served in Belgium. He was wounded at Zandvoorde in October 1914, and fought gallantly in the First Battle of Ypres in November 1914. Menzies was promoted to captain on 14 November, and received the DSO in person from King George V on 2 December.

Menzies&#x27; regiment was decimated during fighting in 1915, suffering very heavy casualties in the Second Battle of Ypres. Menzies was seriously injured in a gas attack in 1915, and was honourably discharged from active combat service.

===Intelligence service===
He then joined the counterintelligence section of Field Marshal Douglas Haig, the British commander. In late 1917, he reported to senior British leadership that Haig&#x27;s intelligence chief Brigadier John Charteris was fudging intelligence estimates, which soon led to Charteris&#x27; removal. This whistle-blowing was apparently done very discreetly. Menzies was promoted to brevet major before the end of the war.

==MI6==
Following the end of the war, Menzies entered MI6 (also known as SIS). He was a member of the British delegation to the 1919 Versailles Peace Conference. Soon after the war, Menzies was promoted to lieutenant-colonel of the Imperial General Staff, General Staff Officer, first grade. Within MI6, he became assistant director for special intelligence. Admiral Hugh Sinclair became director-general of MI6 in 1924, and he made Menzies his deputy by 1929, with Menzies being promoted to full colonel soon afterwards.

In 1924, Menzies was allegedly involved—alongside Sidney Reilly and Desmond Morton—in the forging of the Zinoviev letter. This forgery is considered to have been instrumental in the Conservative Party&#x27;s victory in the United Kingdom general election of 1924, which ended the country&#x27;s first Labour government.

==Chief of MI6==
In 1939, when Admiral Sinclair died, Menzies was appointed Chief of Secret Intelligence Service (the SIS). He expanded wartime intelligence and counterintelligence departments and supervised codebreaking efforts at Bletchley Park.

===Second World War===

When the Second World War began, SIS expanded greatly. Menzies insisted on wartime control of codebreaking, and this gave him immense power and influence, which he used judiciously. By distributing the Ultra material collected by the Government Code &amp; Cypher School, MI6 became an important branch of the government for the first time. Extensive breaches of Nazi Enigma signals gave Menzies and his team enormous insight into Adolf Hitler&#x27;s strategy, and this was kept a closely held secret, not only during the war, but until as late as 1974. (Frederick Winterbotham&#x27;s 1974 book &quot;The Ultra Secret&quot; lifted the cloak of secrecy at last.) The Nazis had suspicions, but believed Enigma to be unbreakable, and never knew during the war that the Allies were reading a high proportion of their wireless traffic.

Menzies kept Prime Minister Winston Churchill supplied daily with important Ultra decrypts, and the two worked together to ensure that financial resources were devoted toward research and upgrading technology at Bletchley Park, to keep pace with Nazi coding refinements, as well as directing talented workers to the massive effort, which employed nearly 10,000 workers by 1945. Bletchley&#x27;s efforts were decisive in the battle against Nazi submarine warfare, which was severely threatening trans-Atlantic shipping, particularly in the first half of 1943. Britain, which was cut off from Europe after mid-1940, was almost completely dependent on North American supplies for survival. The access to Ultra was also vitally important in the battle for Normandy, leading up to D-Day in June 1944, and afterward.

Menzies has been suspected as being involved with the assassination, on 24 December 1942, of François Darlan, the Vichy military commander who defected to the Allies in Algeria. British historian David Reynolds noted in his book, &quot;In Command of History&quot;, that Menzies—who rarely left London during the war—was in Algiers around the period he was killed, making SOE (Special Operations Executive) involvement seem likely.

Menzies, who was promoted to major-general in January 1944, also supported efforts to contact anti-Nazi resistance, including Wilhelm Canaris, the anti-Hitler head of Abwehr, in Germany. Prime Minister Winston Churchill was kept informed of these efforts throughout the war, and information from and about the Nazi resistance was exploited tactically. Menzies coordinated his operations with Special Operations Executive (SOE) (although he reputedly considered them &quot;amateurs&quot;), British Security Coordination (BSC), Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and the Free French Forces. He was awarded the Order of the Yugoslav Crown.

==After the Second World War==
After the war, Menzies reorganised the SIS for the Cold War. He absorbed most of SOE. He was sometimes at odds with the Labour governments. He also had to weather a scandal inside SIS after revelations that SIS officer Kim Philby was a Soviet spy.

Menzies was already the head of the service when Kim Philby joined in 1941. Nonetheless, Menzies deserved some of the blame for Soviet agents having penetrated MI6, according to Anthony Cave Brown in his book &quot;C: The Secret Life of Sir Stewart Graham Menzies, Spymaster to Winston Churchill&quot;. Cave Brown insists that Menzies&#x27;s primary criteria were whether the applicants were upper-class former officers and recommended by another government department, or else were known to him personally. In his &quot;New York Times&quot; review of Brown&#x27;s book, novelist Ken Follett makes this conclusion: &quot;Mr Philby outwitted Menzies because Mr Philby was intelligent and professional and cool, where Menzies was an amiable upper-class sportsman who was out of his depth. And British intelligence, except for the code breakers, was like Menzies—amateur, anti-intellectual and wholly outclassed.&quot;

After 43 continuous years of service in the British Army, Menzies retired to Bridges Court in Luckington in rural Wiltshire at 62 in mid-1952. His success at SIS was not limited to adeptness at bureaucratic intrigue, a virtual necessity in his position; Menzies&#x27; efforts as chief had a major role in winning the Second World War, and certainly earned Churchill&#x27;s trust, as evidenced by nearly 1,500 meetings with the prime minister during its duration.

==Marriages==
Menzies&#x27; first marriage was in 1918 to Lady Avice Ela Muriel Sackville, younger daughter of Gilbert Sackville, 8th Earl De La Warr and Lady Muriel Agnes Brassey, daughter of Thomas Brassey, 1st Earl Brassey. They were divorced in 1931.

He next married Pamela Thetis Garton (née Beckett), on 13 December 1932, fourth daughter of Rupert Evelyn Beckett by his wife Muriel Helen Florence Paget, daughter of Lord Berkeley Charles Sydney Paget, himself a younger son of the 2nd Marquess of Anglesey. Garton was an invalid for many years, suffering from clinical depression and anorexia nervosa. She had Menzies&#x27; only child.

His third marriage was in 1952 to Audrey Clara Lilian Latham, formerly wife of Sir Henry Birkin, 2nd Bt., Lord Edward Hay, and Niall Chaplin, and daughter of Sir Thomas Paul Latham, 1st Bt. Stewart and Audrey were both over age 50 at the time of their marriage, her fourth. Each had separate estates (his in Wiltshire, west of London, hers in Essex, east of London), and they for the most part lived separately, but they met in London for dinner each Wednesday.

Anthony Cave Brown also reported that Menzies had a long-standing affair with one of his secretaries, which he ended upon retirement (and presumably remarriage) in 1952; the secretary apparently tried to kill herself at that time.

Menzies died on 29 May 1968.
