<text>David Arthur Whitaker (18 April 1928 – 4 February 1980) was an English television writer and novelist who worked on the early years of the science-fiction TV series &quot;Doctor Who&quot;. He served as the programme&#x27;s first story editor, supervising the writing of its first 51 episodes from 1963 to 1964.

==Career==

Prior to joining the BBC, Whitaker worked as a writer, actor and director with the York Repertory Group. A play he wrote for them, &#x27;A Choice of Partners&#x27; (1957), gained the attention of the BBC&#x27;s script department. They commissioned Whitaker to work on the programmes Garry Halliday (1962) and the long-running Compact (1962).

Whitaker also contributed his own scripts for a number of &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serials, including &quot;The Crusade&quot; (1965), &quot;The Power of the Daleks&quot; (1966), &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; (1967), &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; (1967–68) and &quot;The Wheel in Space&quot; (1968, from a story concept by Kit Pedler). Although he left the post of story editor in 1964 his final script for the show was &quot;The Ambassadors of Death&quot; (1970). He had not planned to stay longer than a year as Doctor Who&#x27;s story editor, as he thought the serial might not be renewed. He had therefore agreed to take up a role working on another production. 

His other work included writing the Dalek comic strip for the weekly children&#x27;s magazine &quot;TV Century 21&quot;, in addition to the stage play &quot;The Curse of the Daleks&quot; (1965).

In 1964, Whitaker published the first novelisation of a &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial; more than 150 other such books would be published in the course of the next 30 years. His own, &quot;Doctor Who in an Exciting Adventure with the Daleks&quot;, was based on Terry Nation&#x27;s script for the first Dalek TV serial. He completed a second novelisation the following year, this time based on his own script for &quot;The Crusade&quot;. Both books were originally published by Frederick Muller, with the first also being given a paperback release by Armada. 

In 1973, Whitaker&#x27;s novelisations (along with a third, written by Bill Strutton and based on &quot;The Web Planet&quot;) were re-issued by Target Books as part of its launch of a new series of novelisations; Whitaker&#x27;s Dalek story was re-titled &quot;Doctor Who and the Daleks&quot;.

From 1966 to 1968 Whitaker was the chairman of the Writers Guild of Great Britain. He moved to Australia in the 70&#x27;s and contributed to the series &quot;Homicide&quot;, &quot;The Drifter&quot; and &quot;Elephant Boy&quot; before returning to the UK.

Before his death in 1980, Whitaker had been undergoing treatment for cancer. He died leaving his novelisation of &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; unfinished and his plans to adapt &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; unrealised. The adaptation of &quot;The Enemy of the World&quot; was ultimately written by Ian Marter without using any of the material prepared by Whitaker, while &quot;The Evil of the Daleks&quot; was eventually novelised by John Peel and published in 1993.

A documentary, &quot;Finding David&quot;, is included on &quot;Doctor Who: The Collection - Season 2&quot; Blu-ray box set paired with &quot;The Crusade&quot; and hosted by Toby Hadoke. It features a screengrab of this article.

<text>Lemgo (; ) is a university and old Hanseatic town in the Lippe district of North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

It is situated between the Teutoburg Forest and the Weser Uplands, 25 km east of Bielefeld and 70 km west of Hannover. 

Lemgo is the oldest town in the former principality of Lippe and has a population of c. 45,000 and belongs to the OWL region, which is one of the most important cluster regions for mechanical engineering and industrial electronics in Germany. In 2017 the German Internet portal reisereporter.de placed Lemgo among the most beautiful ten half-timbered towns in Germany.

==History==
It was founded 1190 by Bernard II, Lord of Lippe at the crossroad of two merchant routes. Therefore it is the oldest town in the Lippe district. 

Lemgo was a member of the Hanseatic League, a medieval trading association of free or autonomous cities in several northern European countries such as the Netherlands, Germany and Poland. During the Reformation the city of Lemgo adopted Lutheranism in 1522, whereas otherwise in Lippe, its spread was hampered until 1533 by the opposition of the then Catholic ruling Counts of Lippe.

In 1605 Simon VI, Count of Lippe adopted Calvinism and demanded the conversion of Lemgo&#x27;s citizens too using his monarchic privilege of cuius regio, eius religio. This led to a dispute with Lemgo. The city defied the edict to convert to Calvinism, leading to the &quot;Revolt of Lemgo&quot;. This religious dispute was resolved by the Peace of Röhrentrup in 1617, granting Lemgo the right to determine its faith independently. During the 30 Years War, on 15 October 1638, it was put under siege by a combined army of Palatine and Swedish troops, but it was soon lifted upon the approach of a hostile army. Two days later, the Battle of Vlotho occurred, about 11 miles from Lemgo. Lippe&#x27;s Lutheran minority, mostly domiciled in Lemgo, only joined the else Reformed Church of Lippe in 1882, however, retaining its Confession of Augsburg with the Lutheran congregations forming a separate classis within the Lippe church since 1888.

===British Army===
From 1947 until 1993, Lemgo hosted successive infantry battalions of the British Army, the last one being the Royal Irish Regiment.

The battalions were based in Stornoway Barracks, known to the locals as Spiegelberg Kaserne. The base was previously the location of a displaced persons camp and before that a Wehrmacht artillery unit.

At the end of World War II, Canadian Section GHQ, 2nd Echelon, HQ 21 Army Group, occupied Spiegelberg Kaserne. After this headquarters moved to Oldenburg the site was taken over by the British Army.

==Research and education==

Lemgo is the location of the TH OWL and the Fraunhofer Institute IOSB-INA. Together with the buiness partners of the Centrum Industrial IT, the CIIT, a science-to-business center for Industrial Automation Technologies, and the Industry 4.0 Living Lab SmartFactoryOWL the campus site in Lemgo forms a cluster for Intelligent Systems Technologies in the OWL region.

The Innovation Campus Lemgo is a district for the digital economy, which connects existing and new actors throughout the innovation chain education – research – business. The campus forms one of the three regional centers in the technology cluster Intelligent Technical Systems Ostwestfalen-Lippe (it&#x27;s OWL). There are more than 8,500 people on the innovation campus on weekdays, including around 3,600 students, 4,100 pupils, 500 academic and 250 other employees.

==Digital transformation==
Beginning of 2018, Fraunhofer Institute in Lemgo and partners started the IoT Living Lab LemGO Digital as a reference platform for the digital transformation of small and medium sized towns.

==Transport==
The next international airports are Paderborn Lippstadt Airport 50 km to the south, Hannover Airport 70 km to the northeast, Münster/Osnabrück 85 km to the west and Dortmund Airport 105 km to the southwest. A railway connection is served every hour by the RB 73 The Lipperländer to Bielefeld main station. With Lemgo-Lüttfeld railway station the Innovation Campus Lemgo has its own station. The next motor highway is the Bundesautobahn 2 (A2), which runs only 9 kilometers west of Lemgo and can be used via the exit Ostwestfalen-Lippe/Lemgo.

==Culture==
Lemgo&#x27;s historic centre survived the Second World War completely undestroyed. Thus, the overall urban character with the testimonies from the time of the Renaissance was preserved.

===Museum===
Until a few years ago, the Museum Hexenbürgermeisterhaus displayed replicas of some torture instruments from the time of the witch hunt. An exhibition about the life and work of the artist Karl Junker can be seen in the Museum Junkerhaus. The &quot;Junkerhaus&quot; is a work of the artist from the year 1891, provided with numerous ornate carvings. The Städtische Galerie Haus Eichenmüller exhibits temporary exhibitions of works by contemporary artists. The oil mill is a functioning watermill with an attached mill museum. The Weser Renaissance Museum Schloss Brake shows examples of art, culture and life at the time of the Weser Renaissance. The documentation and meeting place Frenkelhaus shows a permanent exhibition on the history of the Jews in Lemgo.
===Historical buildings===
==== Hexenbürgermeisterhaus ====

The most famous house in Lemgo is the so-called Hexenbürgermeisterhaus from 1571 with a facade in the style of Weser Renaissance. Its unusual name comes from its mayor Cothmann, who officiated in the 17th century, who, out of lust for power, used the antagonism against witchcraft - an integral part of the Christian faith - to clear his political opponents out of the field. To make this clear, he had several dozen other citizens killed, both women and men. On the façade below there is a wide, richly-perforated zone of stems called &#x27;Utluchten&#x27;, a term also rarely used in specialist literature. The most typical examples were Renaissance stone buildings and half-timbered building from the 17th and 18th centuries. On the right part of the facade is a bay window on consoles. The facade above is divided by half-columns and cornices.

==== Town hall ====

The town hall in the style of the Weser Renaissance, which was included in the UNESCO list of works of European renown, consists of parts built at different times. Such a genesis is not uncommon for large secular buildings such as town halls, because of the growing number of inhabitants and the increasing administrative activity of the cities, more and more premises were needed. Instead of new buildings, the neighboring houses were bought and extended the town hall.
The oldest part is an elongated hall building dating back to the 13th century. The middle part of the building is built in Gothic [Gothic] style and dates from around 1480 to 1490. It houses the Council Chamber, including the Court Arbor. Such open ground floors belong mostly to medieval town halls, because there took place the public court hearings.
Such open ground floors belong mostly to medieval town halls, because there took place the public court hearings.
The most recent members of the Weser Renaissance are from the 15th and 16th centuries. The Apothecary&#x27;s Corner is a showpiece with equally strict and playful language of form. Similarly in the execution is the council foliage with the Kornherrenstube upstairs on the north side of the town hall. The construction of the Neue Ratsstube is simpler and sums up the market façade of the building symmetrically with the Apothekererker.

==== Brake Castle ====

The Brake Castle is an important architectural monument, whose architectural history reaches from the 12th to the 19th century. The present state of the castle is the result of renovations and extensions. After 1190, Lord Bernhard II of Lippe had built a stone castle. Their dimensions were similar to those of today&#x27;s castle. In 1306 &quot;castrum brac&quot; was first mentioned. It was the preferred seat of the noble lords (from 1528 counts) of Lippe.
In 1587 it was extended as a residence of the counts of Lippe in the style of the renaissance. It is surrounded by a moat and stands on the foundation walls of one of the largest medieval castles in Northern Germany. The striking tower makes it the widely visible landmark of the old Hanseatic town Lemgo. The buildings in the immediate vicinity of the castle still convey an impressive picture of an early-modern residence, which includes the domain, three historic mills and a wash house.

==== Other historical town houses ====

In the historic city center a number of merchants&#x27; houses from late gothic and renaissance have survived. Here you will find half-timbered and stone houses with ornate gables, for example the &quot;Neustädter Twins&quot; and the former Adlerhof. Architectural research has shown that the houses Mittelstraße 54 and 56 (near the market square) have even more parts of the building from the 13th century on their back fronts and thus the rare case from the early Gothic period (Mittelstraße 54, dated to the second Half of the 13th century) or the late Romanesque art (house Mittelstraße 56, based on the arched windows dated to the first half of the 13th century) originate from prof cultivation.
In Mittelstraße, which is the pedestrian zone designated shopping street in the historical city center, are the most important town houses of the city. In addition, there are hundreds of smaller half-timbered houses from the 15th to the 19th century, especially in the old town.

==Sport==
TBV Lemgo is one the country&#x27;s best handball clubs, and multiple previous league, Cup 
and Supercup champions as well as winning the European Cup Winner&#x27;s Cup in 1996 and the European Cup in 2006.

<doc id="268746" wikidata="Q7987830" url="?curid=268746" title="Western Federation of Miners">
<text>The Western Federation of Miners (WFM) was a labor union that gained a reputation for militancy in the mines of the western United States and British Columbia. Its efforts to organize both hard rock miners and smelter workers brought it into sharp conflicts – and often pitched battles – with both employers and governmental authorities. One of the most dramatic of these struggles occurred in the Cripple Creek district of Colorado in 1903–1904; the conflicts were thus dubbed the Colorado Labor Wars. The WFM also played a key role in the founding of the Industrial Workers of the World in 1905 but left that organization several years later.

The WFM changed its name to the [[International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers]] (more familiarly referred to as Mine Mill) in 1916. After a period of decline it revived in the early days of the New Deal and helped found the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) in 1935. The Mine Mill union was expelled from the CIO in 1950 during the post-war red scare for refusing to shed its Communist leadership. After spending years fighting off efforts by the United Steelworkers of America (USWA) to raid its membership, Mine Mill and the Canadian Auto Workers merged in 1967 and were able to retain the name Mine Mill Local 598.

==Founding==

After hard rock miners made sporadic and often unsuccessful efforts to organize during previous decades, the Western Federation of Miners was established on May 15, 1893. The federation was formed through the merger of several miners&#x27; unions representing copper miners from Butte, Montana, silver and lead miners from Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho, gold miners from Colorado and hard rock miners from South Dakota, and Utah at a five-day convention held in Butte, Montana. First president of the organization was John Gilligan and W.J. Weeks was the union&#x27;s first secretary-treasurer.

Fred W. Thompson and Patrick Murfin have written,

The Western Federation of Miners was frontier unionism, the organization of workers who had become &quot;wage slaves&quot; of mining corporations rather recently acquired by back-east absentee ownership. They built their union when they were not yet &quot;broken in&quot; to the discipline of business management. [The WFM] had the militancy of the undisciplined recruits ... From the founding of the Western Federation in 1893, its story for twelve years is that of a continuous search for solidarity ...

The miners who formed the union had already experienced a number of hard-fought battles with mine owners and governmental authorities: in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene strike in February 1892, after company guards shot five strikers to death, the miners disarmed the guards and marched more than a hundred strikebreakers out of town. In response Governor N.B. Willey asked for federal troops to restore order; President Benjamin Harrison sent General John Schofield, who declared martial law, arrested 600 strikers and then held them in a stockade prison without the right to trial, bail or &quot;habeas corpus&quot;. Schofield then ordered local mine owners to discharge any union members they had rehired.

During the confrontation, the Coeur d&#x27;Alene miners received considerable assistance from the Butte Miners&#x27; Union in Butte, Montana, who mortgaged their buildings to send aid.

There was a growing concern that local unions were vulnerable to the power of Mine Owners&#x27; Associations like the one in Coeur d&#x27;Alene. In May 1893, about forty delegates from northern hard rock mining camps met in Butte, and established the Western Federation of Miners, which sought to organize miners throughout the West.

==History==
===Cripple Creek, Colorado strike of 1894===
Violence occurred in later strikes as well. At Cripple Creek, Colorado, after mine owners increased the working day from eight hours to ten, miners dynamited mine buildings and equipment. The county sheriff hired thousands of armed deputies, and then lost control of them. This 1894 struggle was one of the few strikes in which a state militia was called out to protect striking miners from an armed group supporting mine owners. Further violence was averted by the owners&#x27; agreement to return to the eight-hour day and improve miners&#x27; pay to three dollars a day – the standard that the union fought for across the west from that point forward. That success enabled the WFM to expand dramatically over the next decade, to the point where it had over two hundred locals in thirteen states.

===Leadville, Colorado strike of 1896–97===
However, a struggle against mine owners in Leadville served to radicalize WFM leadership.

Representatives of the Cloud City Miners&#x27; Union (CCMU), Local 33 of the Western Federation of Miners, asked for a wage increase of fifty cents per day for all mine workers not already making three dollars per day. The union felt justified, for fifty cents a day had been cut from the miners&#x27; wages during the depression of 1893. Negotiations broke down and 968 miners walked out. Mine owners, who had formed a Mine Owners&#x27; Association with a secret anti-union agreement, locked out another 1,332 mine workers.

The owners hired labor spies to spy on the union, and additional spies to report on replacement workers.

Just days after union leaders publicly warned against violence, a violent incident occurred at the Coronado Mine. At least four union miners and one fireman were killed. Colorado Governor McIntire sent the Colorado National Guard to Leadville.

===Short-lived alliance with the American Federation of Labor===
The WFM affiliated with the American Federation of Labor in 1896, but WFM delegates came away from the AFL convention in Cincinnati,

...not only disappointed with the refusal to aid their big fight in Leadville, but with a feeling that they had not been associating with union men, or with men possessing the moral or intellectual fibre ever to become good union men.

The WFM withdrew from the AFL the following year. With the support of other organizations, including the State Trades and Labor Council of Montana, which issued a proposition to organize a new federation, the WFM created its own alternative to the AFL, the Western Labor Union (WLU). The WLU was formed in 1898 at a convention in Salt Lake City. Its goal was organizing all workers in the West.

===Coeur d&#x27;Alene, Idaho confrontation of 1899===
Another confrontation in Coeur d&#x27;Alene was marked by violence.

The profitable Bunker Hill Mining Company at Wardner, Idaho fired seventeen workers believed to be union members. On April 29, 250 angry miners seized a train and rode it to a $250,000 mill at the Bunker Hill Mine in Wardner. The miners then set off three thousand pounds of dynamite in the mill.

At Idaho Governor Frank Steunenberg&#x27;s request, President William McKinley sent the military to indiscriminately round up 1,000 men and put them into bullpens.

Emma Langdon, a union sympathizer, charged in a 1908 book that Governor Steunenberg deposited $35,000 into his bank account within a week after troops arrived in the Coeur d&#x27;Alene district, implying that there may have been a bribe from the mine operators. J. Anthony Lukas later confirmed the donation in his book &quot;Big Trouble&quot;,

In 1899, when the state needed money for the Coeur d&#x27;Alene prosecutions, the Mine Owners&#x27; Association had come up with $32,000—about a third of it from Bunker Hill and Sullivan—handing $25,000 over to Governor Steunenberg for use at his discretion in the prosecution. Some of this money went to pay [attorneys].

Idaho miners were held for &quot;months of imprisonment in the &#x27;bull-pen&#x27; — a structure unfit to house cattle – enclosed in a high barbed-wire fence.&quot; Some of the miners, never having been charged with any crime, were eventually allowed to go free, while others were prosecuted. Hundreds more remained in the makeshift prison without charges.

The Coeur d&#x27;Alene mine owners developed a permit-based hiring system to exclude union miners.

===Growing radicalism===
At their 1901 convention the WFM miners agreed to the proclamation that a &quot;complete revolution of social and economic conditions&quot; was &quot;the only salvation of the working classes.&quot; WFM leaders openly called for the abolition of the wage system. By the spring of 1903 the WFM was the most militant labor organization in the country.

===Colorado strikes of 1903–04===
The plan to organize the mill workers led to even fiercer battles with the refinery companies, who paid their workers half what miners earned for a ten- to twelve-hour day. When smelter workers went on strike in Colorado City, Colorado in 1903 it appeared that they might be able to win their demands without a serious fight, since the Cripple Creek miners were striking in sympathy with their demands. However, when one of the smelter operators refused to accept the deal brokered by the Governor of Colorado, James Hamilton Peabody, the Governor called in federal troops.

Peabody was a fierce opponent of unions and of any social legislation that limited businesses&#x27; right to run their own affairs as they saw fit. The crucial issue in Colorado was the eight-hour day. When the legislature had enacted a statute limiting the workday in hazardous industries, such as mining and smelting, to eight hours, the Colorado Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional. The voters of Colorado then passed a referendum authorizing the eight-hour day, but the smelter owners and Republican Party fought any efforts to pass a new statute implementing the amendment.

That power took the form of Colorado&#x27;s National Guard, whose salaries were paid by the business community, not the State. Their commanding officer, General Sherman Bell, began arresting union leaders, strikers, and local public officials by the hundreds. Bell prohibited local newspapers from printing any material unfavorable to the military and ordered the arrest of the entire staff of a newspaper whose editorial had offended him. In Bell&#x27;s words, &quot;Military necessity recognizes no laws, either civil or social&quot;. When a lawyer for the union sought to free the prisoners on a writ of habeas corpus, Bell responded, &quot;Habeas corpus, be damned! We&#x27;ll give &#x27;em post mortems!&quot;

The violence intensified. After a mine explosion on November 21, 1903 killed a superintendent and foreman, Bell announced a vagrancy order that required all strikers to return to work or be deported from the district. When a bomb exploded at the Independence Depot near Victor, Colorado on June 6, 1904, killing thirteen strikebreakers, Sheriff H.M. Robertson went to investigate. The situation became very volatile, with throngs of angry men gathered in the streets.

The Cripple Creek Mine Owners&#x27; Association and an anti-union vigilante organization, the Cripple Creek District Citizens&#x27; Alliance, called a meeting at the Victor Military Club to formulate a response to the violence. A short time later Sheriff Robertson, whom the Mine Owner&#x27;s Association deemed too tolerant of the union, was confronted and ordered to resign immediately or be lynched. Robertson was replaced with Edward Bell, a member of both the Mine Owner&#x27;s Association and the Citizens&#x27; Alliance.

In a hostile environment ripe for provocation, the Mine Owner&#x27;s Association and the Citizens&#x27; Alliance called a public meeting in a vacant lot across from the Western Federation of Miners union hall in Victor. Speeches against the union gave way to arguments, followed by fist fights and shooting. Two non-union men were killed and five others on both sides were wounded in the melee. WFM members took refuge in their hall, but Company L of the National Guard surrounded the hall and laid siege, firing into the building from nearby rooftops. Forty union members eventually surrendered, with four of them sporting fresh wounds. The Citizen&#x27;s Alliance entered the building and trashed it. Vigilantes subsequently destroyed every union hall in the area, while General Bell used the National Guard to deport hundreds of strikers. General Bell closed the Portland Mine, owned by James Burns, because it had come to an agreement with the WFM.

===Aftermath of the strikes===
Although the courts eventually acquitted all union members charged with the bombing of the railroad station during the 1903–04 strike and awarded damages to those who had been deported, the strike and the union were broken in Cripple Creek; similar measures were resorted to in Telluride, Colorado. The actions effectively drove the WFM out of many of the mining camps in Colorado.

===Bingham strike, 1912===
On 18 September 1912, about 4,800 miners struck Utah Copper Company &quot;and all the principal mines, mills, and smelters of Bingham camp.&quot; Other Utah mine sympathizers brought that number to 9,000. The company enlisted an army of 5,000 besides having the protection of the Utah National Guard. The strike ended in October and at the end of the month, Daniel C. Jackling raised wages. It also saw an end to the Padrone system.

=== El Paso smelters&#x27; strike, 1913 ===

In April 1913, several hundred Mexican American workers at the American Smelting and Refining Company&#x27;s copper smelter in El Paso, Texas, went on strike. During the strike, WFM officials competed with IWW officials to organize the workers with their respective unions. The WFM established a local union in El Paso and signed over 400 workers, though neither union was ever in control of the strike. While the strike ended in failure several weeks later, the WFM local remained.

===Michigan copper strike, 1913–1914===
In July 1913, locals of the Western Federation of Miners called a general strike against all mines in the Michigan Copper Country. The strike was called without approval by the national WFM, which was extremely low on funds after the recent strikes in the west. The union supported the strike, but faced great difficulties providing pay and supplies to the strikers. Hundreds of strikers surrounded the mine shafts to prevent others from reporting to work. Almost all mines shut down, although the workers were said to be sharply divided on the strike question. The union demanded an 8-hour day, a minimum wage of $3 per day, an end to use of the one-man drill, and that the companies recognize it as the employees&#x27; representative.

The mines reopened under National Guard protection, and many went back to work. The companies instituted the 8-hour day, but refused to set a $3 per day minimum wage, refused to abandon the one-man drill, and especially refused to employ Western Federation of Miners members.

On Christmas Eve 1913, the Western Federation of Miners organized a party for strikers and their families at the Italian Benevolent Society hall in Calumet. The hall was packed with between 400 and 500 people when someone shouted &quot;fire.&quot; There was no fire, but 73 people, 62 of them children, were crushed to death trying to escape. This became known as the Italian Hall Disaster. Shortly after the disaster, WFM president Charles Moyer was shot and then forcibly placed on a train headed for Chicago. The strikers held out until April 1914, but then gave up the strike. The WFM was left with almost no funds to run its operations or future strikes.

===WFM Loses Butte, Montana===

In 1914, the copper miners at Butte, Montana, split between those loyal to the WFM, and those supporting more militancy, many of whom sympathized with the more radical Industrial Workers of the World. The militants attacked WFM officials marching in the annual Union Day parade, and later blew up the WFM headquarters with dynamite. The dissidents established their own rival union, but neither the WFM or the new militant union was able to keep peace among the miners, so the mine owners did not recognize either union. The result was that at Butte, for many years a WFM stronghold, the mine owners did not recognize any miners&#x27; union from 1914 until 1934.

==Founding the IWW==
The WFM&#x27;s defeat led it to look for allies in the battle with employers in the Rockies, a struggle the union didn&#x27;t want to concede. The Western Labor Union had renamed itself the American Labor Union in 1902. The WFM now sought to join with other advocates of industrial unionism and socialism to found a national union federation, the Industrial Workers of the World, in 1905.

The WFM had adopted a socialist program in 1901. &quot;Big Bill&quot; Haywood, who joined the union as a silver miner in Idaho, put the union&#x27;s anti-capitalist stance in the simplest terms: he took the side of workers against the mine owners who &quot;did not find the gold, they did not mine the gold, they did not mill the gold, but by some weird alchemy all the gold belonged to them!&quot;

Haywood was the first chairman of the IWW; he defined its work as &quot;socialism with its working clothes on&quot;. But factional differences the following year between the &quot;revolutionists&quot; and &quot;reformists&quot; within the IWW, which also divided the leadership of the WFM, led to the departure of the WFM from the IWW in 1907. After the split, former WFM leaders Bill Haywood and Vincent St. John left the WFM to work for the IWW. The WFM rejoined the AFL in 1911.

==Trial of Haywood, Pettibone and Moyer==
When Frank Steunenberg, a former governor of Idaho, was murdered on December 30, 1905, the authorities arrested Charles Moyer, president of the union, Bill Haywood, its secretary, and George Pettibone, a former member, in Colorado and put them on trial for Steunenberg&#x27;s murder. The prosecution relied heavily on the testimony of Harry Orchard, who claimed that the union had directed him to plant the bombs that killed supervisors and strikebreakers during the second Cripple Creek strike and that Haywood, Moyer and Pettibone had hired him to assassinate Governor Steunenberg.

The prosecution had depended heavily on the investigative work of James McParland who, acting as an operative for the Pinkerton Detective Agency, had helped convict the Molly Maguires three decades earlier, and felt confident that it would convict all three.

McParland persuaded Orchard that he could avoid the gallows if he testified that an &quot;inner circle&quot; of Western Federation of Miners leaders had ordered the crime. The prosecution of that &quot;inner circle&quot; of the union was then funded, in part, by direct contributions from the Ceour d&#x27;Alene District Mine Owners&#x27; Association to prosecuting attorneys who were, ostensibly, working for the state rather than for private interests. Upon hearing of this circumstance, president Theodore Roosevelt issued a particularly stern rebuke to Idaho Governor Frank Gooding, describing such a state of affairs as the &quot;grossest impropriety&quot;:

If the Governor or the other officials of Idaho accept a cent from the operators or from any other capitalist with any reference, direct or indirect, to this prosecution, they would forfeit the respect of every good citizen and I should personally feel that they had committed a real crime.

Roosevelt&#x27;s strong words came in spite of the fact that he had already concluded the WFM leaders were guilty. Governor Gooding&#x27;s response to the President provided a severely distorted account of the financial arrangements for the trial, and a promise to return money contributed by the mine owners. Gooding then:

...kept the narrowest construction of his promise to the president... [He then proclaimed publicly and often that] no dollar has been or will be supplied from any private source or organization whatsoever, [and then] went right on taking money from the mine owners.

In addition to Idaho mine owners, powerful and wealthy industrialists outside of Idaho were also tapped in an effort to destroy the Western Federation of Miners. Donations for the prosecutorial effort estimated in the range of $75,000 to $100,000 were simultaneously solicited and forwarded from the Colorado Mine Owners&#x27; Association and other wealthy Colorado donors. Mining interests in other states – Nevada and Utah, for example – were approached as well.

The defense hired Clarence Darrow, the most renowned lawyer of the day, who had represented Eugene V. Debs several years earlier. In spite of the combined efforts of state and local governments in Idaho and Colorado, the Mine Owners&#x27; Associations, the Pinkerton and Thiel Detective Agencies, and other interested industrialists, the jury acquitted Bill Haywood. Pettibone was also acquitted early the next year, and all charges against Moyer were dropped. In a separate prosecution, Orchard was convicted and sentenced to death. His sentence was commuted, and he spent the rest of his life in an Idaho prison. Orchard died in prison in 1954.

==Mine Mill==
The failure of later strikes and the depression of 1914 brought about a sharp decline in the WFM&#x27;s membership. In 1916 the union changed its name to the International Union of Mine, Mill, and Smelter Workers. The union had become largely ineffective, riddled with members who passed information on to their employers, and unable to win substantial gains for its members for most of the next two decades.

Things changed, however, in 1934 when miners and smeltermen revitalized the union. Returning to its militant roots, the union spread throughout the west from its base in Butte, and then into the South and Canada. There were also union locals in non-ferrous smelters in New Jersey – in Perth Amboy at the American Smelting and Refining Company (ASARCO), and in Carteret at the U.S. Metals Company. The union was one of the original members of the Committee for Industrial Organizing, which later transformed itself into the Congress of Industrial Organizations.

The union also returned to its radical political traditions, as members of the Communist Party USA came to hold the presidency of the union in the late 1940s. That, however, sparked further disagreements over leadership and expenditures and, as the postwar red scare picked up momentum, prompted raids by the United Steelworkers of America, the United Auto Workers and other unions, particularly in mining in the South, where the CIO encouraged predominantly white miners&#x27; locals to defect. The CIO formally expelled the union in 1950 after it refused to remove its communist leaders.

The union soldiered on for another seventeen years, finding itself increasingly outmatched in its battles with employers. While it defeated all of the Steelworkers&#x27; efforts to replace it in its western strongholds in the 1950s, it had a harder time holding on to its outposts in the South. In addition, more conservative members, uneasy with the union&#x27;s foreign policy and with the increasing number of African-American and Mexican-American unionists, tried to take their locals out of the union, opening up fissures that weakened the union&#x27;s strikes against the Anaconda Copper Mining Company in 1954 and 1959. The union eventually merged with the Steelworkers in 1967 after losing locals to it in Butte and Canada. Only Local 598 in Sudbury, Ontario, which had a contentious and sometimes violent history with the city&#x27;s Steelworkers locals, voted against the merger – it remained autonomous until 1993, when it merged with the Canadian Auto Workers.

==&quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;==
The 1954 movie &quot;Salt of the Earth&quot;, directed by Herbert J. Biberman, a member of the blacklisted Hollywood Ten, portrays a year-and-a-half long strike by New Mexico zinc miners who belonged to Mine Mill; many of the actors were rank-and-file members of that union. The producers found it difficult, however, to recruit Anglo actors to play strikebreakers or deputy sheriffs; those who disliked the union wanted nothing to do with it, while those who sympathized did not want to be seen switching sides, even as actors.

The movie&#x27;s star, Rosaura Revueltas, was deported during the shooting of the film, requiring the producers to use a double in some scenes and to shoot film of others and record her narration in Mexico. The home of one of the union members/actors and the union hall were burned down shortly after the end of shooting. Clinton Jencks, the Mine Mill organizer depicted in the film, was thereafter convicted of falsely stating he was not a communist on the affidavit required of all union representatives under the Taft-Hartley Act; his conviction was overturned by the Supreme Court in &quot;Jencks v. United States,&quot; 353 U.S. 657 (1957).

The producers were unable to find a post-production house in Hollywood willing to process the film or skilled editors willing to work on it, other than under pseudonyms or at night. The film was shown at only a few theaters; most theaters rejected it, including some that had originally agreed to show it. Union projectionists refused to show it at some theaters that had accepted it.

The struggle to produce the film, pictures and information about the original strike, along with the film itself in its entirety, is available on DVD from www.Organa.com. The Special Edition also includes the film &quot;Hollywood Ten&quot;.

<text>The Second Barbary War, also known as the U.S.–Algerian War and the Algerine War, was a brief military conflict between the United States and the North African state of Algiers in 1815.

Piracy had been rampant along the North African &quot;Barbary&quot; coast of the Mediterranean Sea since the 16th century. Algerian pirates and privateers intermittently preyed on American ships, with Algiers extracting annual tribute from the U.S. since 1795; the First Barbary War in the early 19th century, fought primarily against Algiers&#x27; neighbors, failed to fully stem the problem.

In February 1815, after the end of the War of 1812, U.S. President James Madison requested that Congress declare war against Algiers; legislation was passed on 3 March 1815 authorizing the use of the U.S. Navy to protect American interests and seize Algerian assets. In May, a 10-ship squadron led by Commodore Stephen Decatur—a veteran of the First Barbary War—sailed from New York for Algiers; an even larger force, led by Commodore William Bainbridge, another Barbary War veteran, was close behind.

Following a decisive U.S. victory off the coast of Cape Gata in June 1815, and by threat of seizing Algiers itself, Commodore Decatur successfully pressed Dey Omar Agha of Algeria to sue for peace; the resulting agreement was formalized in a treaty ratified by the U.S. Senate on 5 December 1815. However, Agha later repudiated the treaty, as well as similar agreements with several European nations, until a combined English and Dutch force bombarded Algiers in 1816; the subsequent arrival of a U.S. squadron carrying U.S. commissioner William Shaler led to a new but substantially similar treaty on 23 December 1816, which was ratified on 11 February 1822.

The Algerian War resulted in the United States and Europe ceasing tribute to Algiers and marked the beginning of the end of piracy in the Mediterranean. It also further elevated U.S. military prestige and power projection capabilities that had been demonstrated in the prior Barbary War. Western nations built ever more sophisticated and expensive ships that the Barbary pirates could not match in numbers or technology, and the French conquest of Algeria in 1830 fully ended any vestige of piracy in the region.

==Background==

The First Barbary War (1801–1805) had led to an uneasy truce between the US and the Barbary states, but American attention turned to Britain and the War of 1812. The Barbary pirates returned to their practice of attacking American merchant vessels in the Mediterranean Sea and ransoming their crews to the United States government. At the same time, the major European powers were still involved in the Napoleonic Wars, which did not fully end until 1815.

At the conclusion of the War of 1812, however, the United States returned to the problem of Barbary piracy. On 3 March 1815, Congress authorized deployment of naval power against Algiers, and the squadron under the command of Commodore Stephen Decatur set sail on 20 May. It consisted of (flagship), , &quot;Macedonia&quot;, , , , , &quot;Flambeau&quot;, , and .

==War==

Following the War of 1812, Algiers sided with the British (although the British Atlantic blockade had limited US trade in the Mediterranean region). President Madison recommended that Congress declare the &quot;existence of a state of war between the United States and the Dey and Regency of Algiers.&quot; While Congress did not formally declare a state of war, they did pass legislation, enacted on 3 March 1815, that authorized the president to use the U.S. Navy, &quot;as judged requisite by the President&quot; to protect the &quot;commerce and seamen&quot; of the United States on the &quot;Atlantic Ocean, the Mediterranean and adjoining seas.&quot; Congress also authorized the president to grant the U.S. Navy the ability to seize all vessels and goods belonging to Algiers. The legislation also authorized the president to commission privateers for the same purpose. 

On 20 May 1815, a 10-ship squadron left New York (to be followed by a larger fleet under command of William Bainbridge). Shortly after departing Gibraltar en route to Algiers, Decatur&#x27;s squadron encountered the Algerian flagship &quot;Meshouda&quot; and captured it in the Battle off Cape Gata. They also managed to capture the Algerian brig &quot;Estedio&quot; in the Battle off Cape Palos. On 29 June, the squadron had reached Algiers and had initiated negotiations with the Bey. The United States made persistent demands for compensation, mingled with threats of destruction, and the Dey capitulated. He signed a treaty aboard the &quot;Guerriere&quot; in the Bay of Algiers on 3 July 1815, in which Decatur agreed to return the captured &quot;Meshuda&quot; and &quot;Estedio.&quot; The Algerians returned all American captives, estimated to be about 10, in exchange for about 500 subjects of the Dey. Algeria also paid $10,000 for seized shipping. The treaty guaranteed no further tributes by the United States and granted the United States full shipping rights in the Mediterranean Sea.

==Aftermath==
Despite having successfully negotiated for their freedom, all 10 US captives perished when the ship returning them to the US, &quot;Epervier&quot;, sank in the Atlantic ocean on 9 August 1815. Although the conflict was brief and small-scale, it showed US resolve and was a victory for free trade.

In early 1816, Britain undertook a diplomatic mission, backed by a small squadron of ships of the line, to Tunis, Tripoli, and Algiers to convince the Deys to stop their piracy and free European Christian slaves. The Deys of Tunis and Tripoli agreed without any resistance, but the Dey of Algiers was less cooperative, and the negotiations were stormy. The leader of the diplomatic mission, Admiral Edward Pellew, believed that he had negotiated a treaty to stop the slavery of Christians and returned to England. However, just after the treaty was signed, Algerian troops massacred 200 Corsican, Sicilian and Sardinian fishermen who had been under British protection thanks to the negotiations. This caused outrage in Britain and the rest of Europe, and Pellew&#x27;s negotiations were seen as a failure.

As a result, Pellew was ordered to sea again to complete the job and punish the Algerians. He gathered a squadron of five ships of the line, reinforced by a number of frigates, later reinforced by a flotilla of six Dutch ships. On 27 August 1816, following a round of failed negotiations, the fleet delivered a punishing nine-hour bombardment of Algiers. The attack immobilized many of the Dey&#x27;s corsairs and shore batteries, forcing him to accept a peace offer of the same terms that he had rejected the day before. Pellew warned that if the terms were not accepted, he would continue the action. The Dey accepted the terms, but Pellew had been bluffing since his fleet had already spent all its ammunition.

A treaty was signed on 24 September 1816. The British Consul and 1,083 other Christian slaves were freed, and the U.S. ransom money repaid.

<text>In marketing and the social sciences, observational research (or field research) is a social research technique that involves the direct observation of phenomena in their natural setting. This differentiates it from experimental research in which a quasi-artificial environment is created to control for spurious factors, and where at least one of the variables is manipulated as part of the experilovement.

==In context==
Observational research is a method of data collection that has become associated with qualitative research. Compared with quantitative research and experimental research, observational research tends to be less reliable but often more valid. The main advantage of observational research is flexibility. The researchers can change their approach as needed. Observational research measures behavior directly, rather than the subject&#x27;s self-reports of behavior or intentions. The main disadvantage is it is limited to behavioral variables. It cannot be used to study cognitive or affective variables.

==Data collection methods==
Generally, there are three methods used to collect data in observational research:
*Covert observational research – The researchers do not identify themselves. Either they mix in with the subjects undetected, or they observe from a distance. The advantages of this approach are: (1) It is not necessary to get the subjects&#x27; cooperation, and (2) The subjects&#x27; behaviour will not be contaminated by the presence of the researcher. Some researchers have ethical misgivings with the deceit involved in this approach.
*Overt observational research – The researchers identify themselves as researchers and explain the purpose of their observations. The problem with this approach is subjects may modify their behaviour when they know they are being watched. They portray their &quot;ideal self&quot; rather than their true self in what is called the Hawthorne Effect. The advantage that the overt approach has over the covert approach is that there is no deception (see, for example, PCIA-II
*Participant Observation – The researcher participates in what they are observing so as to get a finer appreciation of the phenomena.

==In marketing research==
In marketing research, the most frequently used types of observational techniques are:
*Personal observation
**observing products in use to detect usage patterns and problems
**observing license plates in store parking lots
**determining the socio-economic status of shoppers
**determining the level of package scrutiny
**determining the time it takes to make a purchase decision
*Mechanical observation
**eye-tracking analysis while subjects watch advertisements
***oculometers – what the subject is looking at
***pupilometers – how interested is the viewer
**electronic checkout scanners – records purchase behaviour 
**on-site cameras in stores
** people meters (as in monitoring television viewing) e.g.Nielsen box 
**voice pitch meters – measures emotional reactions
**psychogalvanometer – measures galvanic skin response
*Audits
**retail audits to determine the quality of service in stores
**inventory audits to determine product acceptance
**shelf space audits
**scanner based audits 
*Trace Analysis
**credit card records
**computer cookie records
**garbology – looking for traces of purchase patterns in garbage
**detecting store traffic patterns by observing the wear in the floor (long term) or the dirt on the floor (short term)
**exposure to advertisements
*Content analysis
**observe the content of magazines, television broadcasts, radio broadcasts, or newspapers, either articles, programs, or advertisements

<doc id="268773" wikidata="Q2030118" url="?curid=268773" title="When the Levee Breaks">
<text>&quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; is a country blues song written and first recorded by Memphis Minnie and Kansas Joe McCoy in 1929. The lyrics reflect experiences during the upheaval caused by the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927.

&quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; was re-worked by English rock group Led Zeppelin and became the final song on their untitled fourth album. Singer Robert Plant used many of the original lyrics. The songwriting is credited to Memphis Minnie and the individual members of Led Zeppelin. Many other artists have performed and recorded versions of the song.

==Background and lyrics==
When blues musical duo Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie wrote &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot;, the Great Mississippi Flood of 1927 was still fresh in people&#x27;s memories. The flooding affected 26,000 square miles of the Mississippi Delta. Hundreds were killed and hundreds of thousands of residents were forced to evacuate. The event is the subject of several blues songs, the most popular being &quot;Backwater Blues&quot; by Bessie Smith (1927) and &quot;Mississippi Heavy Water Blues&quot; by Barbecue Bob (1928).

Ethel Douglas, Minnie&#x27;s sister-in-law, recalled that Minnie was living with her family near Walls, Mississippi, when the levee broke in 1927. The song&#x27;s lyrics recount the story of a man who lost his home and his family. Despite the tragedy, biographers also see in it a statement of rebirth.

==Recording and release==
McCoy and Minnie recorded &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; during their first session for Columbia Records in New York City on June 18, 1929. The song features McCoy on vocals and rhythm guitar. Minnie, the more accomplished guitarist of the two, provided the embellishments using a finger-picked style in a Spanish or open G tuning. Music journalist Charles Shaar Murray identified Joe McCoy as the actual songwriter but, as with all their Columbia releases, regardless of who sang the song the record labels list the artist as &quot;Kansas Joe and Memphis Minnie&quot;.

Columbia issued the song on the then-standard 78 rpm phonograph record in August or June 1929 with &quot;That Will Be Alright&quot;, another vocal performance by McCoy, on the flip-side. The record was released before record industry publications, such as &quot;Billboard&quot; began tracking so-called race records, but it has been called a moderate hit. &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; has been included on several Memphis Minnie compilation albums, and blues roots albums featuring various artists.

==Led Zeppelin version==

Led Zeppelin recorded &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; for inclusion on their 1971 untitled fourth album. When considering material for the group to record, singer Robert Plant had suggested the Kansas Joe McCoy and Memphis Minnie song. Jimmy Page said that while Plant&#x27;s lyrics followed the style of the original, he had developed a new guitar riff that set their version apart. John Bonham&#x27;s drumming is usually noted as the defining feature of the song.

===Recording===
Before the released version appeared, Led Zeppelin attempted the song twice. They recorded an early version of the song in December 1970 at Headley Grange, using the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio. This was later released as &quot;If It Keeps On Raining&quot; on the 2015 reissue of &quot;Coda&quot;. Before relocating to Headley Grange, they tried unsuccessfully to record the song at Island Studios at the beginning of the recording sessions for their fourth album.

Although Page and John Paul Jones based their guitar and bass lines on the original song, they did not follow its twelve-bar blues I–IV–V–I structure, but instead used a one-chord or modal approach to create a droning sound. Plant used many of the original lyrics, but with a different melodic approach. He also added a harmonica part. During mixing a reverse echo effect was created, in which the echo was heard ahead of the source.

John Bonham&#x27;s drumming, on a Ludwig kit, was recorded in the lobby of Headley Grange using two Beyerdynamic M 160 microphones which were suspended above a flight of stairs. Output from these was passed to a pair of Helios F760 compressor/limiters which were set aggressively to create a breathing effect. A Binson Echorec, a delay effects unit, was also used.

Parts of the song were recorded at a different tempo and then slowed down, causing a &quot;sludgy&quot; sound, particularly on the harmonica and guitar solos. It was the only song on the album that was mixed at Sunset Sound in Hollywood, California. (The rest were remixed in London.) Page said the panning at the song&#x27;s ending was one of his favourite mixes, &quot;when everything starts moving around except for the voice, which remains stationary&quot;. The song was difficult to recreate live and the band played it only a few times, in the early stages of their 1975 U.S. Tour.

===Critical reception===
Music critic Robert Christgau said Led Zeppelin&#x27;s version of &quot;When the Levee Breaks&quot; was the greatest achievement of their fourth album. He argued that, because it played like an authentic blues song and had &quot;the grandeur of a symphonic crescendo&quot;, their version of the song transcended and dignified &quot;the quasi-parodic overstatement and oddly cerebral mood&quot; of their past blues songs. Mick Wall called it a &quot;hypnotic, blues rock mantra&quot;. AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine, in a retrospective review, commented that the song was the only piece on their fourth album equal to &quot;Stairway to Heaven&quot; and called it &quot;an apocalyptic slice of urban blues ... as forceful and frightening as Zeppelin ever got, and its seismic rhythms and layered dynamics illustrate why none of their imitators could ever equal them.&quot; In &quot;The Rolling Stone Album Guide&quot; (2004), Greg Kot wrote that the song showed the band&#x27;s &quot;hard-rock blues&quot; at their most &quot;momentous&quot;. However, group biographer Keith Shadwick noted that the song suffered from &quot;too few ideas added to the ingredients as the minutes tick by, compared with &#x27;Black Dog&#x27;&quot; and other songs on the first side of the album.

===Other releases===
A second version of the song was released in 2014 on the second disc of the remastered two-disc deluxe edition of &quot;Led Zeppelin IV&quot;. This version, known as &quot;When The Levee Breaks (Alternate UK Mix in Progress)&quot;, was recorded on May 19, 1971, at the Rolling Stones Mobile Studio at Headley Grange. This mix runs 7:09, while the original runs 7:08.

===Other versions and sampling===
Robert Plant performed the song with Alison Krauss on their 2022 tour. One concert reviewer described Plant&#x27;s vocal as &quot;astonishing, channeling every flood he had seen in his 74 years into the emotional resonance of his voice&quot;.

Bonham&#x27;s drum beat is one of the most widely sampled in popular music. According to &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine&#x27;s Miles Raymer:

<doc id="268774" wikidata="Q1317913" url="?curid=268774" title="Industrial unionism">
<text>Industrial unionism is a trade union organising method through which all workers in the same industry are organized into the same union, regardless of skill or trade, thus giving workers in one industry, or in all industries, more leverage in bargaining and in strike situations. De Leon believed that militarized Industrial unions would be the vehicle of class struggle. 

Industrial unionism contrasts with craft unionism, which organizes workers along lines of their specific trades.

== History in the United States ==
===Early history===
In 1893, the American Railway Union (ARU) was formed in the United States, by Eugene Debs and other railway union leaders, as an industrial union in response to the perceived limitations of craft unions. Debs himself gave an example of the inadequacies that his fellows at the time felt towards organising by craft. He recounts, that in 1888, a strike was called by train drivers and railway firemen on the Chicago, Burlington and Quincy Railways, but other employees, particularly conductors, who were organised into a different unions did not join that strike, with strikebreakers brought on to help their employers. 

In June 1894, the ARU voted to join in solidarity with the ongoing Pullman Strike, and within hours of the union lending support to the boycott, traffic from the Pullman Company traffic ceased to move from Chicago to the Western United States. The sympathy strike then spread to the Southern and later the Eastern United States. A statement was issued by the chairman of the General Managers Association, which represented railway companies that were mainly situated around Chicago, admitted:
We can handle the railway brotherhoods, but we cannot handle the A.R.U... We cannot handle Debs. We have got to wipe him out.
The General Managers Association turned to the United States government, which immediately sent the United States Army and the United States Marshals to force an end to the strike.

=== Popularisation and radicalism ===
In 1905, the Industrial Workers of the World (IWW) was formed in Chicago at the First Annual Convention of the IWW, six weeks after the formation of the Asiatic Exclusion League. It was created as a rejection of the craft unionism philosophy that the American Federation of Labor endorsed, and from its inception, the IWW would organize without regard to sex, skills, race, creed, or national origin unlike the Federation. It argued for a mass-oriented labour movement, the One Big Union, and declared that &quot;the working class and the employing class have nothing in common.&quot;

The critiques of the Federation included the strikebreaking that member unions participated in against each other, jurisdictional squabbling, autocratic leadership, and a strong relationship between union and business leaders in the National Civic Federation.

After Debs&#x27; six month imprisonment after the ARU&#x27;s dissolution, he, along with Ed Boyce, Bill Haywood and others, were instrumental in launching the Western Labor Union, soon renamed the American Labor Union, which was the precursor to the IWW. The new organisation was militant in its operations and housed revolutionary socialist and radical ideals, with Boyce proclaiming that labour must &quot;abolish the wage system which is more destructive of human rights and liberty than any other slave system devised.&quot; The preamble of the IWW&#x27;s constitution further emphasised that &quot;There can be no peace so long as hunger and want are found among millions of working people and the few, who make up the employing class, have all the good things of life. Between these two classes a struggle must go on...&quot;

===Persecution===
In the United States, IWW executive board officer Frank Little was lynched from a railway trestle. Seventeen Wobblies in Tulsa were beaten by a mob and driven out of town. In the third quarter of 1917, the &quot;New York Times&quot; ran sixty articles attacking the IWW. The Justice Department launched raids on IWW headquarters across the country. The &quot;New-York Tribune&quot; suggested that the IWW was a German front, responsible for acts of sabotage throughout the nation.

Writing in 1919, Paul Brissenden quoted an IWW publication in Sydney, Australia:

All the machinery of the capitalist state has been turned against us. Our hall has been raided periodically as a matter of principle, our literature, our papers, pictures, and press have all been confiscated; our members and speakers have been arrested and charged with almost every crime on the calendar; the authorities are making unscrupulous, bitter and frantic attempts to stifle the propaganda of the I.W.W.

Brissenden also recorded that:

...several laws have been enacted which have been more or less directly aimed at the Industrial Workers of the World. Australia led off with the &quot;Unlawful Associations Act&quot; passed by the House of Representatives of the Commonwealth in December, 1916... Within three months of the passage of the Australian Act, the American States of Minnesota and Idaho passed laws &quot;defining criminal syndicalism and prohibiting the advocacy thereof.&quot; In February, 1918, the Montana legislature met in extraordinary session and enacted a similar statute.

While Brissenden notes that IWW coal miners in Australia successfully used direct action to free imprisoned strike leaders and to win other demands, Wobbly opposition to conscription during World War I &quot;became so obnoxious&quot; to the Australian government that laws were passed which &quot;practically made it a criminal offense to be a member of the I.W.W.&quot;

== One Big Union ==

Historically, industrial unionism has frequently been associated with the concept of One Big Union. On July 12, 1919, The &quot;New England Worker&quot; published &quot;The Principle of Industrial Union&quot;:
==Industrial unionism by country==

===Australia===

Verity Burgmann asserts in &quot;Revolutionary industrial unionism&quot; that the IWW in Australia provided an alternate form of labour organising, to be contrasted with the Labourism of the Australian Labor Party and the Bolshevik Communism of the Communist Party of Australia. Revolutionary industrial unionism, for Burgmann, was much like revolutionary syndicalism, but focused much more strongly on the industrial nature of unionism. Burgmann saw Australian syndicalism, particularly anarcho-syndicalism, as focused on mythic small shop organisation. For Burgmann, the IWW&#x27;s vision was always a totalising vision of a revolutionary society: the Industrial Commonwealth.

===Korea===

The theory and practice of industrial unionism is not confined to the western or the English-speaking world. The Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) is committed to reorganizing their current union structure along the lines of industrial unionism.

===South Africa===

The Congress of South African Trade Unions (COSATU) is also organized along the lines of industrial unionism.

===United Kingdom===

Marion Dutton Savage associates the spirit of industrial unionism with &quot;the aspiration of workers for the control of industry&quot; inspired by Robert Owen in 1833-34. The Grand National Consolidated Trades Union (GCTU) recruited skilled and unskilled workers from many industries, with membership growing to half a million within a few weeks. Frantic opposition forced the GCTU to collapse after a few months, but the ideals of the movement lingered for a time. After Chartism failed, British unions began to organize only skilled workers, and began to limit their goals in tacit support of the existing organization of industry.

A new union movement that was &quot;distinctly class conscious and vaguely Socialistic&quot; began to organize unskilled workers in 1889.

Industrial unionism thence proceeded primarily by combining craft unions into industrial formations, rather than through the birth of new industrial organizations. Industrial organizations prior to 1922 included the National Transport Workers&#x27; Federation, the National Union of Railwaymen, and the Miners&#x27; Federation of Great Britain.

In 1910 Tom Mann went to France and became acquainted with syndicalism. He returned to Britain and helped to organize the Workers&#x27; International Industrial Union, which was similar to the IWW from North America.

=== United States ===
In 1904, the Western Federation of Miners was under significant pressure from military and employer violence in the Colorado Labor Wars. Its labour federation the American Labor Union had not gained significant membership. The AFL was the largest organized labour federation, and the United Brotherhood of Railway Employees (UBRE) felt isolated. When they applied to the AFL for a charter, the Scranton Declaration of 1901 was the AFL&#x27;s guiding principle.

Gompers had promised that each trade and craft would have its own union. The Scranton Declaration acknowledged that one affiliate, the United Mine Workers was formed as an industrial union but that other skilled trades—carpenters, machinists, etc. were organized as powerful craft unions. These craft unions refused to allow any encroachment upon their &quot;turf&quot; by the industrial unionists. The concept came to be known as voluntarism. 

The federation turned the UBRE down in accord with the voluntarism principle. The Scranton Declaration acknowledging voluntarism was adhered to, even though the craft-based railway brotherhoods had not yet joined the AFL. The AFL was holding the door open for craft unions that might join, and slamming it in the face of the industrial unions who wanted to join. The following year, the 2000-member UBRE joined the organizing convention of the IWW.

Before Herbert Hoover became president, he befriended AFL President Gompers. Hoover, as the former United States Food Administrator, president of the Federated Engineering Societies, and then Secretary of Commerce in the Harding Cabinet in 1921, invited the heads of several &quot;forward-looking&quot; major corporations to meet with him.
[Hoover] asked these men why their companies didn&#x27;t sit down with Gompers and try to work out an amicable relationship with organized labor. Such a relationship, in Hoover&#x27;s opinion, would be a bulwark against the spread of radicalism reflected in the rise of the &quot;Wobblies,&quot; the Industrial Workers of the World. The Hoover initiative got no encouragement from those at the meeting. The obstacles that Hoover did not comprehend, [Cyrus] Ching recorded in his memoir, were that Gompers had no standing in the affairs of any company except to the extent that AFL unions had organized the workers, and that the federation&#x27;s focus on craft unionism precluded any effective organization of the mass-production industries by [the AFL&#x27;s] affiliates.
The craft-based AFL had been slow to organize industrial workers, and the federation remained steadfastly committed to craft unionism. This changed in the mid-1930s when, after passage of the National Labor Relations Act, workers began to clamor for union membership. In competition with the CIO movement, the AFL established Federal Labor Unions (FLUs), which were local industrial unions affiliated directly with the AFL, a concept initially envisioned in the 1886 AFL Constitution. FLUs were conceived as temporary unions, many of which were organized on an industrial basis. In keeping with the craft concept, FLUs were designed primarily for organizing purposes, with the membership destined to be distributed among the AFL&#x27;s craft unions after the majority of workers in an industry were organized.

In the United States, the conception of industrial unionism in the 1920s certainly differed from that of the 1930s, for example. The Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) primarily practiced a form of industrial unionism prior to its 1955 merger with the American Federation of Labor (AFL), which was mostly craft unions. Unions in the resulting federation, the AFL–CIO, sometimes have a mixture of tendencies.

<text>Jane Kennedy (born 9 June 1964) is an Australian actress, radio presenter and television producer, best known for her work with Working Dog Productions, a group of performers responsible for a variety of television and films. She previously was a co-host of &quot;KennedyMolloy&quot; on Triple M with Mick Molloy.

==Career==
She met the other members of the group, which over time included Tom Gleisner, Rob Sitch, Santo Cilauro, Tony Martin, Mick Molloy, and Jason Stephens, while working on Melbourne commercial radio on the &quot;D-Generation Breakfast Show&quot;. Kennedy was not originally a member of the group, but was the newsreader assigned to work with them during their timeslot. The team quickly made a game of trying to make her laugh while she read the news. Their frequent success led to Kennedy joining the D-Generation as a full-time member and she continued to work with them on the radio show. The group stayed together to later write, direct and produce &quot;The Late Show&quot;, a comedy sketch show, &quot;Frontline&quot;, a widely acclaimed spoof of television current affairs in which she played ambitious reporter Brooke Vandenberg, and &quot;Funky Squad,&quot; a retro styled spoof of 70s police dramas.

Since the mid-1990s, Kennedy has mostly stayed behind the camera as a casting director and producer for various Working Dog productions, including their panel talk show &quot;The Panel&quot;, and the films &quot;The Castle&quot; and &quot;The Dish&quot;.

Kennedy also appeared on the radio program &quot;Get This&quot; occasionally, and has been a semi-regular panelist on television chat show &quot;The Circle&quot;.

In 2009, Kennedy released her first cookbook, &quot;Fabulous Food Minus the Boombah&quot;. In 2010, she released her second cookbook, &quot;OMG! I Can Eat That?&quot; and has since written two other cookbooks &quot;One Dish Two Ways&quot; and &quot;The Big Book of Fabulous Food&quot;.

From 2017 until 2020 she co-hosted &quot;Kennedy Molloy,&quot; a national drive show on Triple M in 2018 with her long time comedy colleague Mick Molloy. In January 2021, Kennedy resigned from Triple M to devote more time to her family.

<doc id="268778" wikidata="Q3073226" url="?curid=268778" title="Flagler College">
<text>Flagler College is a private liberal arts college in St. Augustine, Florida. It was founded in 1968 and offers 37 undergraduate majors and two master&#x27;s programs. It also had a campus in Tallahassee from 2000-2024.

==History==

Founded in 1968, the campus comprises , the centerpiece of which is the Ponce de León Hotel, built in 1888 as a luxury hotel. The architects were John Carrere and Thomas Hastings, working for Henry Morrison Flagler, the industrialist, oil magnate and railroad pioneer. It is now listed as a National Historic Landmark.

Lawrence Lewis Jr., was the driving force behind Flagler&#x27;s development. It was his vision to create a small, private liberal arts college on the old hotel grounds. Lewis was Chairman of Flagler&#x27;s board of trustees for more than 20 years, guiding the college through a reorganization in 1971. He directed millions of dollars through foundations, family and personal funds into new construction, restoration projects, endowment and various other programs to ensure Flager&#x27;s continued success. Lewis was related to Henry Flagler through his mother, Louise Wise Lewis Francis, who was the niece of Mary Lily Kenan Flagler, who married Henry Flagler in 1901 making him Lewis&#x27; great uncle.

In February 2014, the college&#x27;s vice president of enrollment management resigned after it was determined that he had been altering student test scores, GPAs, and student rankings to enhance the college&#x27;s image, standing, and reputation. The college hired a Jacksonville law firm to investigate. The report indicated that the college had been reporting false information since 2004 to various organizations, including the U.S. Department of Education and various ranking organizations.

Flagler College has received many top state and national rankings over the years. In 2022, Veranda named the campus &quot;One of the Most Beautiful College Campuses Around the World,&quot; and mentioned its palatial, renovated ballroom with walls of original Tiffany stained glass windows. The ballroom now serves as the dining hall for students. The same year, Architectural Digest mentioned its buildings in &quot;One of the 8 Most Unexpected Places to See World-Class Architecture in the U.S.&quot; In 2024, U.S. News and World Report named it #2 in Most Innovative Schools, #3 Best Regional Colleges in the South, #5 in Best Undergraduate Teaching, and #14 in Best Value Schools.

The college has continued to enlarge and enhance its campus, adding the Brown Innovation Center (BIC), the Learning Resource Center, and the Deagan Archeology Lab.

==Proctor Library==

The Proctor Library, located at 44 Sevilla Street in the northwest corner of campus, is Flagler&#x27;s sole library facility. It is named after William L. Proctor, Flagler&#x27;s chancellor, who was president of the college from 1971 until 2001. Like many of the historic buildings on campus, the Proctor Library&#x27;s architectural design reflects the Gilded Age style popular during the time of Henry Flagler&#x27;s construction of the Ponce de León Hotel in 1888. The Proctor Library was built in 1994-95, replacing the demolished home of artist Felix de Crano, which had been the last classic Shingle Style house in St. Augustine.

The library&#x27;s collection contains approximately 102,047 printed volumes, 212,689 electronic books, 4,180 audiovisual items, 630 periodicals, and 5 newspapers, as well as almost 44,000 full-text electronic periodicals and 50 online databases. Proctor Library also contains three collections: Digital Collections, Flagler College Archives, and Special Collections. Access to, and the use of, the Proctor Library is limited to Flagler College students, faculty, and staff, and is not open to the general public without a written request. Proctor Library Digital Collections, however, is accessible to anyone with an Internet connection.
St. Augustine Fiction is a collecting focus of the library in collaboration with the St. Augustine Historical Society.

==Student life==
===Organizations===
Flagler offers membership in fraternity, sororities, honor societies and almost 50 clubs and student organizations.

===Newspaper===
&quot;The Gargoyle&quot; is the college&#x27;s student-run newspaper. In 2010, it went online-only. At the 2012 Society of Professional Journalists&#x27; Mark of Excellence Region 3 awards, &quot;The Gargoyle&quot; took first place for best independent online publication and first places for editor Michael Newberger in online opinion writing and sports editor Mari Pothier in online sports reporting.

Since becoming online-only, &quot;The Gargoyle&quot; has won nine Regional Mark of Excellence awards and published three more from Flagler Communication Department classes. Before 2010, the publication had only won two SPJ awards in its history. In 2007, the publication was a finalist in the Associated Collegiate Press Pacemaker Awards.

In 2006 and 2007, there were several allegations of censorship or alteration of articles in the &quot;Gargoyle&quot; by the college administration. In 2006, one issue of the newspaper was removed from circulation due to an alleged error in its headlines about rising tuition. In April 2007, the college administration again exercised editorial control over the paper due to alleged factual errors. Students rallied and organized a protest against any type of censorship of the newspaper, calling for a free and independent student press.

After September 2007, working on &quot;The Gargoyle&quot; was no longer required of communication majors. An advisory board and operating guidelines were set up for &quot;The Gargoyle&quot;.

== Athletics ==

The Flagler athletic teams are called the Saints. The college is a member of the NCAA Division II ranks, primarily competing in the Peach Belt Conference (PBC) since the 2009–10 academic year. The Saints previously competed as an NCAA D-II Independent from 2006–07 to 2008–09; and in the Florida Sun Conference (FSC; currently known as the Sun Conference since the 2008–09 school year) of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics (NAIA) from 1990–91 to 2005–06.

Flagler competes in 19 intercollegiate varsity sports: Men&#x27;s sports include baseball, basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis and track &amp; field (indoor); while women&#x27;s sports include basketball, cross country, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track &amp; field (indoor) and volleyball. There are also two spirit squad teams: cheerleading and pep band.

===Volleyball===
In 2009 the Flagler College Lady Saints volleyball team made it to the national championship, and finished in the top four of Division II volleyball teams in the nation. In 2010, the Lady Saints made it to the regional finals, finishing top 16 in the nation.

<doc id="268795" wikidata="Q121535" url="?curid=268795" title="Benny Golson">
<text>Benny Golson (January 25, 1929 – September 21, 2024) was an American bebop and hard bop jazz tenor saxophonist, composer, and arranger. He came to prominence with the big bands of Lionel Hampton and Dizzy Gillespie, more as a writer than a performer, before launching his solo career. Golson was known for co-founding and co-leading The Jazztet with trumpeter Art Farmer in 1959. From the late 1960s through the 1970s Golson was in demand as an arranger for film and television and thus was less active as a performer, but he and Farmer re-formed the Jazztet in 1982.

Many of Golson&#x27;s compositions have become jazz standards, including &quot;I Remember Clifford&quot;, &quot;Blues March&quot;, &quot;Stablemates&quot;, &quot;Whisper Not&quot;, &quot;Along Came Betty&quot;, and &quot;Killer Joe&quot;. He is regarded as &quot;one of the most significant contributors&quot; to the development of hard bop jazz, and was a recipient of a Grammy Trustees Award in 2021.

== Early life and education ==
He was born Benny Golson in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on January 25, 1929. His father, also Bennie Golson, left the family early. His mother Celadia brought the family up, working as a seamstress and a waitress. Golson witnessed racism first at age eight on a trip to Georgia with an uncle. He began taking piano lessons at age nine; his interest in music was nurtured at Benjamin Franklin High School in Philadelphia giving him ambitions to become a concert pianist; he was fascinated by the music of Brahms and Chopin. At age 13, he was taken to New York&#x27;s Minton Playhouse, where bebop was born, and he experienced some bop pioneers including Thelonious Monk. He saw Lionel Hampton&#x27;s band, featuring Arnett Cobb on tenor saxophone, at Philadelphia&#x27;s Earle Theatre. Inspired, he switched to the saxophone at age 14. At the high school, he played with several other promising young musicians, including John Coltrane, Red Garland, Jimmy Heath, Percy Heath, Philly Joe Jones, and Red Rodney. He later attended Howard University.

== Career ==
After graduating from Howard University, Golson joined Bull Moose Jackson&#x27;s rhythm and blues band; Tadd Dameron, whom Golson came to consider the most important influence on his writing, was Jackson&#x27;s pianist at the time.

From 1953 to 1959, Golson played with Dameron&#x27;s band and then with the bands of Lionel Hampton, Johnny Hodges, Earl Bostic, Dizzy Gillespie, and Art Blakey and the Jazz Messengers, with whom he recorded the classic &quot;Moanin&#x27;&quot; in 1958.

Golson was working with the Lionel Hampton band at the Apollo Theater in Harlem in 1956 when he learned that Clifford Brown, a noted and well-liked jazz trumpeter who had done a stint with him in Dameron&#x27;s band, had died in a car accident. Golson was so moved by the event that he composed the threnody &quot;I Remember Clifford&quot;, as a tribute to a fellow musician and friend.

In addition to &quot;I Remember Clifford&quot;, many of Golson&#x27;s other compositions have become jazz standards. Songs such as &quot;Stablemates&quot;, &quot;Killer Joe&quot;, &quot;Whisper Not&quot;, &quot;Along Came Betty&quot;, and &quot;Are You Real?&quot;, have been performed and recorded numerous times by many musicians.

From 1959 to 1962, Golson co-led the Jazztet with Art Farmer, mainly playing his own compositions. Golson then left jazz to concentrate on studio and orchestral work for 12 years. During this time, he composed music for such television shows as &quot;Mannix&quot;, &quot;Ironside&quot;, &quot;Room 222&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;, &quot;The Partridge Family&quot; and &quot;&quot;. He also formulated and conducted arrangements to various recordings, such as &quot;Eric Is Here&quot;, a 1967 album by Eric Burdon, which features five of Golson&#x27;s arrangements, conducted by Golson.

During the mid-1970s, Golson returned to jazz playing and recording. Critic Scott Yanow of AllMusic wrote that Golson&#x27;s sax style underwent a major shift with his performing comeback, more resembling avant-garde Archie Shepp than the swing-era Don Byas influence of Golson&#x27;s youth. He made a successful second career playing in clubs and on festivals internationally. In 1982, Golson re-organized the Jazztet with Farmer.

Golson played a cameo role in the 2004 movie &quot;The Terminal&quot;, related to his appearance in &quot;A Great Day in Harlem&quot;, a group photograph of prominent jazz musicians taken in 1958. Main character Viktor Navorski (Tom Hanks) travels to the US from Europe to obtain Golson&#x27;s signature; Golson was one of seven musicians then surviving from the photo, the others being Johnny Griffin (died 2008), Eddie Locke (died 2009), Hank Jones (died 2010), Marian McPartland (died 2013), Horace Silver (died 2014), and Sonny Rollins. Pianist Ray Bryant&#x27;s song &quot;Something in B-Flat,&quot; which was included on Golson&#x27;s debut album as a leader, &quot;Benny Golson&#x27;s New York Scene&quot;, can be heard during a scene where Viktor is painting and redecorating part of an airport terminal; in a later scene, Golson&#x27;s band performs &quot;Killer Joe&quot;. The album &quot;Terminal 1&quot; was released by Golson shortly after the film, as a &quot;homage to Steven Spielberg&quot;, its director.

==Musical style==
Golson&#x27;s early playing has been described as &quot;characterised by a distinctively fibrous, slightly hoarse tone ... firmly within the mainstream-modern tradition exemplified by another of his heroes, the tenor player Don Byas.&quot; During the 1960s, however, he absorbed some of the techniques pioneered by his friend John Coltrane, whom he described as &quot;an inextinguishable example of spiritual nobility.&quot; He is regarded as &quot;one of the most significant contributors&quot; to the development of hard bop jazz.

== Personal life ==
Golson was married to Seville Golson; they had three sons, Odis, Reggie and Robert, and the marriage ended in divorce. He married the ballet dancer Bobbie Hurd in 1959; they had a daughter, Brielle. In an interview with &quot;Awake!&quot; on October 8, 1980, Golson said that since the late 1960s he and his wife had become members of Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

Golson died, following a short illness, at his home in Manhattan, New York, on September 21, 2024, at the age of 95.

== Awards and honors ==
In 1996, Golson received the NEA Jazz Masters Award of the National Endowment for the Arts.

In 1999, Golson was awarded an honorary doctorate of music from Berklee College of Music.

In October 2007, Golson received the Mellon Living Legend Legacy Award, presented by the Mid Atlantic Arts Foundation at a ceremony at the Kennedy Center. Additionally, during the same month, he won the University of Pittsburgh International Academy of Jazz Outstanding Lifetime Achievement Award at the university&#x27;s 37th Annual Jazz Concert in the Carnegie Music Hall.

In November 2009, Golson was inducted into the International Academy of Jazz Hall of Fame, during a performance at the University of Pittsburgh&#x27;s annual jazz seminar and concert.

He received the Grammy Trustees Award in 2021.

The Howard University Jazz Studies program created a prestigious award in his honor called the &quot;Benny Golson Jazz Master Award&quot; in 1996. Many distinguished jazz artists have received this award.

<doc id="268796" wikidata="Q168954" url="?curid=268796" title="Tripoli, Lebanon">
<text>Tripoli ( ; , , ; , ; see below) is the largest and most important city in northern Lebanon and the second-largest city in the country. Situated north of the capital Beirut, it is the capital of the North Governorate and the Tripoli District. Tripoli overlooks the eastern Mediterranean Sea, and it is the northernmost seaport in Lebanon. The city is predominantly inhabited by Sunni Muslims, with smaller populations of Alawites and Christians, including Maronites and Armenians among others.

The history of Tripoli dates back at least to the 14th century BC. It was called Athar by the Phoenicians, and later &quot;Tripolis&quot; by the Greek settlers, whence the modern Arabic name &quot;Ṭarābulus&quot; derives. In the Arab world, Tripoli has been historically known as (), to distinguish it from its Libyan counterpart, known as ().

Landmarks of Tripoli include the Mansouri Great Mosque and the Citadel of Tripoli, which is the largest crusader castle in Lebanon. The city has the second highest concentration of Mamluk architecture after Cairo. Tripoli also holds a string of four small islands offshore, the Palm Islands, which were declared a protected area because of their status as a haven for endangered loggerhead turtles (&quot;Caretta caretta&quot;), rare monk seals and migratory birds. Tripoli borders the city of El Mina, the port of the Tripoli District, which it is geographically conjoined with to form the greater Tripoli conurbation.

With the formation of Lebanon and the 1948 breakup of the Syrian–Lebanese customs union, Tripoli, once on par in economic and commercial importance to Beirut, was cut off from its traditional trade relations with the Syrian hinterland and therefore declined in relative prosperity.

==Names ==
According to classical writers Diodorus Siculus, Pliny the Elder, and Strabo, the city was founded by combining colonies from three different Phoenician cities – Tyre, Sidon and Arwad. These colonies were each a stadion () apart from each other, and the combined city became known as &#x27;Triple City&#x27;, or &quot;Trípolis&quot; () in Greek.

Tripoli had a number of different names as far back as the Phoenician age. In the Amarna letters the name &quot;Derbly&quot;, possibly a Semitic cognate of the city&#x27;s modern Arabic name &quot;Ṭarābulus&quot;, was mentioned, and in other places &quot;Ahlia&quot; or &quot;Wahlia&quot; are mentioned (14th century BC). In an engraving concerning the invasion of Tripoli by the Assyrian King Ashurnasirpal II (888–859 BC), it is called &quot;Mahallata&quot; or &quot;Mahlata&quot;, &quot;Mayza&quot;, and &quot;Kayza&quot;.

Under the Phoenicians, the name &quot;Athar&quot; was used to refer to Tripoli. When the Ancient Greeks settled in the city they called it &quot;Trípolis&quot;, meaning &#x27;triple city&#x27;, influenced by the earlier phonetically similar but etymologically unrelated name &quot;Derbly&quot;. The Arabs called it &quot;Ṭarābulus&quot; and &quot;Ṭarābulus ash-Shām&quot; (referring to &quot;bilād ash-Shām&quot;, or Levant, to distinguish it from the Libyan city with the same name).

Once, Tripoli was also known as &quot;al-Fayḥāʾ&quot; (), which is a term derived from the Arabic verb &quot;fāḥa&quot; () which is used to indicate the diffusion of a scent or smell. Tripoli was once known for its vast orange orchards. During the season of blooming, the pollen of orange flowers was said to be carried on the air, creating a splendid perfume that filled the city and suburbs.

The city of Tripoli is also given the title of &quot;City of Knowledge and Scholars&quot; ().

==History==


Evidence of settlement in Tripoli dates back as early as 1400 BC. Tripoli was originally established as a Phoenician colony in the 8th century BC. There, the Phoenicians established a trading station and later, under Persian rule, the city became the center of a confederation of the Phoenician city-states of Sidon, Tyre, and Arados Island. Under Hellenistic rule, Tripoli was used as a naval shipyard and the city enjoyed a period of autonomy. It came under Roman rule around 64 BC. The 551 Beirut earthquake and tsunami destroyed the Byzantine city of Tripoli along with other Mediterranean coastal cities.

Tripoli was conquered by an Arab Muslim army in 635. During Umayyad rule, Tripoli became a commercial and shipbuilding center. It achieved semi-independence under Fatimid rule, when it developed into a center of learning. The Crusaders laid siege to the city at the beginning of the 12th century and were able finally to enter it in 1109. This caused extensive destruction, including the burning of Tripoli&#x27;s famous library, Dar al-&#x27;Ilm (House of Knowledge), with its thousands of volumes. During the Crusaders&#x27; rule the city became the capital of the County of Tripoli. In 1289, it fell to the Mamluks and the old port part of the city was destroyed. A new inland city was then built near the old castle. During Ottoman rule from 1516 to 1918, it retained its prosperity and commercial importance. Tripoli and all of Lebanon was under French mandate from 1920 until 1943 when Lebanon achieved independence.

===Ancient period===
Many historians reject the presence of any Phoenician civilization in Tripoli before the 8th (or sometimes 4th) century BC. Others argue that the north–south gradient of Phoenician port establishments on the Lebanese coast indicates an earlier age for the Phoenician Tripoli.

Tripoli has not been extensively excavated because the ancient site lies buried beneath the modern city of El Mina. However, a few accidental finds are now in museums. Excavations in El Mina revealed skeletal remains of ancient wolves, eels, and gazelles, part of the ancient southern port quay, grinding mills, different types of columns, wheels, bows, and a necropolis from the end of the Hellenistic period. A sounding made in the Crusader castle uncovered Late Bronze Age, Iron Age, in addition to Roman, Byzantine, and Fatimid remains. At the Abou Halka area (at the southern entrance of Tripoli) refuges dating to the early (30,000 years old) and middle Stone Age were uncovered.
Tripoli became a financial center and main port of northern Phoenicia with sea trade (East Mediterranean and the West), and caravan trade (North Syria and hinterland).

Under the Seleucids, Tripoli gained the right to mint its own coins (112 BC); it was granted autonomy between 104 and 105, which it retained until 64 BC. At the time, Tripoli was a center of shipbuilding and cedar timber trade (like other Phoenician cities).

During the Roman and Byzantine period, Tripoli witnessed the construction of important public buildings including a municipal stadium or gymnasium due to the strategic position of the city midway on the imperial coastal highway leading from Antioch to Ptolemais. In addition, Tripoli retained the same configuration of three distinct and administratively independent quarters (Aradians, Sidonians, and Tyrians). The territory outside the city was divided between the three quarters.

===Umayyad, Abbasid and Fatimid periods===
Tripoli gained in importance as a trading centre for the whole Mediterranean after it was inhabited by the Arabs. Tripoli was the port city of Damascus; the second military port of the Arab Navy, following Alexandria; a prosperous commercial and shipbuilding center; a wealthy principality under the Kutama Ismaili Shia Banu Ammar emirs. Legally, Tripoli was part of the jurisdiction of the military province of Damascus (Jund Dimashq).

The Jewish community of Tripoli traces its roots back to the seventh century, as recounted by the Abbasid-era historian al-Baladhuri. During the caliphate of Rashidun caliph Uthman (644–655), the governor of Syria, Mu&#x27;awiya, settled Jews in Tripoli, fostering amicable relations with the majority Sunni Muslims. However, during the persecution of dhimmis by the Shi&#x27;ite Fatimid caliph al-Hakim (996–1021), the synagogue faced conversion into a mosque. Notably, during the Seljuk invasion in the 1070s, Tripoli served as a refuge for Jews from Palestine, as documented in Cairo Geniza records.

===Crusader period===

During the Crusade period, the city became the chief town of the County of Tripoli (a Crusader state founded by Raymond of Saint-Gilles) extending from Byblos to Latakia and including the plain of Akkar with the famous Krak des Chevaliers. Tripoli was also the seat of a bishopric. Tripoli was home to a busy port and was a major center of silk weaving, with as many as 4,000 looms. Important products of the time included lemons, oranges, and sugar cane. For 180 years, during the Frankish rule, Occitan was among the languages spoken in Tripoli and neighboring villages. At that time, Tripoli had a heterogeneous population including Western Europeans, Greeks, Armenians, Maronites, Nestorians, Jews, and Muslims.

During that time, Tripoli witnessed the growth of the inland settlement surrounding the &quot;Pilgrim&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (the Citadel of Tripoli) into a built-up suburb including the main religious monuments of the city such as: The &quot;Church of the Holy Sepulchre of Pilgrim&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (incorporating the Shiite shrine), the Church of Saint Mary of the Tower, and the Carmelite Church. The state was a major base of operations for the military order of the Knights Hospitaller, who occupied the famous castle Krak Des Chevaliers (today a UNESCO world heritage site). The state ceased to exist in 1289, when it was captured by the Egyptian Mamluk sultan Qalawun.

The mid-twelfth century earthquake led to the death of many Jews in Tripoli, as noted by Jewish explorer Benjamin of Tudela.

===Mamluk period===

Tripoli was captured by Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun from the Crusaders in 1289. The Mamluks destroyed the old city and built a new city 4 km inland from it. About 35 monuments from the Mamluk city have survived to the present day, including mosques, madrasas, khanqahs, hammams (bathhouses), and caravanserais, many of them built by local Mamluk amirs (princes). The Mamluks did not fortify the city with walls but restored and reused Saint-Gille&#x27;s citadel.

During the Mamluk period, Tripoli became a central city and provincial capital of the six kingdoms in Mamluk Syria. Tripoli ranked third after Aleppo and Damascus. The kingdom was subdivided into six &quot;wilayahs&quot; or provinces and extended from Byblos and Aqra mountains south, to Latakia and al Alawiyyin mountains north. It also included Hermel, the plain of Akkar, and &quot;Hosn al-Akrad&quot; (Krak des Chevaliers).

Tripoli became a major trading port of Syria supplying Europe with candy, loaf and powdered sugar (especially during the latter part of the 14th century). The main products from agriculture and small industry included citrus fruits, olive oil, soap, and textiles (cotton and silk, especially velvet).

The Mamluks formed the ruling class holding main political, military and administrative functions. Arabs formed the population base (religious, industrial, and commercial functions) and the general population included the original inhabitants of the city, immigrants from different parts of the Levant, North Africans who accompanied Qalawun&#x27;s army during the liberation of Tripoli, Eastern Orthodox Christians, some Western families, and a minority of Jews. The population size of Mamluk Tripoli is estimated at 20,000–40,000; against 100,000 in each of Damascus and Aleppo.

Mamluk Tripoli witnessed a high rate of urban growth and a fast city development (according to traveler&#x27;s accounts). It also had poles of growth including the fortress, the Great Mosque, and the river banks. The city had seven guard towers on the harbor site to defend the inland city, including what still stands today as the Lion Tower. During the period the castle of Saint-Gilles was expanded as the Citadel of Mamluk Tripoli. The &quot;Aqueduct of the Prince&quot; was reused to bring water from the Rash&#x27;in spring. Several bridges were constructed and the surrounding orchards expanded through marsh drainage. Fresh water was supplied to houses from their roofs.

The urban form of Mamluk Tripoli was dictated mainly by climate, site configuration, defense, and urban aesthetics. The layout of major thoroughfares was set according to prevailing winds and topography. The city had no fortifications, but heavy building construction characterized by compact urban forms, narrow and winding streets for difficult city penetration. Residential areas were bridged over streets at strategic points for surveillance and defense. The city also included many loopholes and narrow slits at street junctions.

The religious and secular buildings of Mamluk Tripoli comprise a fine example of the architecture of that time. The oldest among them were built with stones taken from 12th and 13th-century churches; the characteristics of the architecture of the period are best seen in the mosques and madrassas, the Islamic schools. It is the madrassas which most attract attention, for they include highly original structures as well as decoration: here a honeycombed ceiling, there a curiously shaped corniche, doorway or moulded window frame. Among the finest is the madrassa al-Burtasiyah, with an elegant façade picked out in black and white stones and a highly decorated lintel over the main door.
Public buildings in Mamluk Tripoli were emphasized through sitting, façade treatment, and street alignment. Well-cut and well-dressed stones (local sandstone) were used as media of construction and for decorative effects on elevations and around openings (the ablaq technique of alternating light and dark stone courses). Bearing walls were used as vertical supports. Cross vaults covered most spaces from prayer halls to closed rectangular rooms, to galleries around courtyards. Domes were constructed over conspicuous and important spaces like tomb chambers, mihrab, and covered courtyards. Typical construction details in Mamluk Tripoli included cross vaults with concave grooves meeting in octagonal openings or concave rosettes as well as simple cupolas or ribbed domes. The use of double drums and corner squinches was commonly used to make the transition from square rooms to round domes.

Decorations in Mamluk buildings concentrated on the most conspicuous areas of buildings: minarets, portals, windows, on the outside, and mihrab, qiblah wall, and floor on the inside. Decorations at the time may be subdivided into structural decoration (found outside the buildings and incorporate the medium of construction itself such as ablaq walls, plain or zigzag moldings, fish scale motifs, joggled lintels or voussoirs, inscriptions, and muqarnas) and applied decoration (found inside the buildings and include the use of marble marquetry, stucco, and glass mosaic).

Mosques evenly spread with major concentration of madrasas around the Mansouri Great Mosque. All khans were located in the northern part of the city for easy accessibility from roads to Syria. Hammams (public baths) were carefully located to serve major population concentrations: one next to the Grand Mosque, the other in the center of the commercial district, and the third in the right-bank settlement.

About 35 monuments from the Mamluk city have survived to the present day, including mosques, madrasas, khanqahs, hammams, and caravanserais, many of them built by local Mamluk amirs. Major buildings in Mamluk Tripoli included six congregational mosques (the Mansouri Great Mosque, al-Aattar, Taynal, al-Uwaysiyat, al-Burtasi, and al-Tawbat Mosques). Sultan al-Ashraf Khalil (r. 1290–93) founded the city&#x27;s first congregational mosque in memory of his father (Qalawun), in either late 1293 or 1294 (693 AH). Six madrasas were later built around the mosque. The Mamluks did not fortify the city with walls but restored and reused a Crusader citadel on the site. In addition, there were two quarter mosques (Abd al-Wahed and Arghoun Shah), and two mosques that were built on empty land (al-Burtasi and al-Uwaysiyat). Other mosques incorporated earlier structures (churches, khans, and shops). Mamluk Tripoli also included 16 madrasas of which four no longer exist (al-Zurayqiyat, al-Aattar, al-Rifaiyah, and al-Umariyat). Six of the madrasas concentrated around the Grand Mosque. Tripoli also included a Khanqah, many secular buildings, five Khans, three hammams (Turkish baths) that are noted for their cupolas. Hammams were luxuriously decorated and the light streaming down from their domes enhances the inner atmosphere of the place.

===Ottoman period===


During the Ottoman period, Tripoli became the provincial capital and chief town of the Eyalet of Tripoli, encompassing the coastal territory from Byblos to Tarsus and the inland Syrian towns of Homs and Hama; the two other eyalets were Aleppo Eyalet, and Şam Eyalet. Until 1612, Tripoli was considered as the port of Aleppo. It also depended on Syrian interior trade and tax collection from mountainous hinterland. Tripoli witnessed a strong presence of French merchants during the 17th and 18th centuries and became under intense inter-European competition for trade. Tripoli was reduced to a sanjak centre in the Vilayet of Beirut in 19th century and retained her status until 1918 when it was captured by British forces.

Public works in Ottoman Tripoli included the restoration of the Citadel of Tripoli by Suleiman I, the Magnificent. That was the only major project during 400 years of Ottoman Rule. Later governors brought further modifications to the original Crusader structure used as garrison center and prison. Khan al-Saboun (originally a military barrack) was constructed in the center of the city to control any uprising. Ottoman Tripoli also witnessed the development of the southern entrance of the city and many buildings, such as the al-Muallaq or &quot;hanging&quot; Mosque (1559), al-Tahhan Mosque (early 17th century), and al-Tawbah mosque (Mamluk construction, destroyed by 1612 flood and restored during early Ottoman Period). It also included several secular buildings, such as Khan al-Saboun (early 17th century) and Hammam al-Jadid (1740).

=== French Mandate ===
After the partition of the Ottoman Empire, the French created the territory of Greater Lebanon, whose borders forcibly separated Tripoli from Syria, a decision that was contested by Tripolitans. Tripoli&#x27;s population - mostly Sunni Muslims - found itself isolated in this state dominated by Christians, and so Tripoli developed a strong identity as a bastion for Muslim Arab nationalism and anti-imperialism. During this period, protests demanding reunification with Syria were backed by the Syrian National Bloc until the French cut off their support, resulting in a massive 33 day general strike in 1936.

=== Independent Lebanon ===
Tripoli has been mired in a period of extended economic and political decline during the period since Lebanese gained its independence. Beirut&#x27;s rise as Lebanon&#x27;s dominant port deprived Tripoli of its former preeminence as a trading hub, and globalization eroded the city&#x27;s ability to compete in manufacturing. Lebanon&#x27;s civil war, from 1975 to 1990, hit Tripoli hard. On 15 September 1985 intense fighting broke out between Tawheed al-Islami, a Sunni militia which controlled the harbour and was backed by the PLO, and the Alawite Arab Democratic Party’s militia. The ADP were backed by the communist Red Knights as well as Syrian special forces. After a week of fighting which saw around 150 killed, 4500 wounded and 200,000 people leaving their homes, the Syrians brokered a truce which involved the Syrian army occupying five key positions and the removal of heavy weapons. The truce broke down on 27 September and Tahweed al-Islami positions were bombarded from SSNP and Syrian artillery positions in the surrounding hills. On 1 October, following an Iranian diplomatic intervention, Tahweed agreed to surrender their heavy weapons and Syrian troops, on 6 October, were deployed throughout the city. A further 350 people had been killed and hundreds more wounded.

The Syrian army remained in the city for almost three decades until 2005:As a majority Sunni city with a growing strain of indigenous Islamist militancy, Tripoli suffered some of the Syrians’ cruelest predations at a time when then-President Hafez al-Assad was engaged in the brutal suppression of Syria’s own Muslim Brotherhood.
Wartime violence and instability triggered waves of emigration and capital flight. It also left Tripoli increasingly isolated, not least due to the dismantling of Lebanon&#x27;s rail network and the abandonment of the Tripoli railway station. The city, moreover, saw little of the post-war reconstruction funding that Prime Minister Rafic Hariri ushered into Lebanon, with an overwhelming focus on the capital.
In the years since, living conditions in Tripoli have continued to decline. In 2016, the United Nation&#x27;s Human Settlements Program estimated that 58% of Tripoli&#x27;s Lebanese residents lived in poverty. That already high figure preceded Lebanon&#x27;s 2019 financial crisis, which has ratcheted up poverty and food insecurity.

Tripoli&#x27;s stagnation is attributable, in part, to the city&#x27;s dysfunctional politics, in which a fragmented array of Sunni political figures (such as Saad Hariri, Najib Mikati, Faisal Karami, and Ashraf Rifi) vie for influence through competing networks of patronage: &quot;No single leader has been able to assert dominance, leaving city politics to devolve into chaos.&quot;

==Demographics==


In 2014, Muslims made up 92.21% and Christians made up 7.31% of registered voters in Tripoli. 82.15% of the voters were Sunni Muslims and 8.67% were Alawites.

Tripoli has a majority Arab, Sunni Muslim population in neighbourhoods such as Bab al-Tabbaneh, right next to the small Lebanese-Alawite community that is concentrated in the Jabal Mohsen neighborhood. Christians constitute today less than 5 percent of the population of the city. The Christian population in the city comprises Greek Orthodox Christians, Maronites and Greek Catholics, along with Armenians.

Tripoli stands as one of Lebanon&#x27;s less stable cities, marked by recurrent sectarian tensions among its communities, notably the Sunni and Alawite populations. The impact of the Syrian civil war, beginning in 2011, had extended into Tripoli, where Alawites aligned with the former Assad regime, and Sunnis supported the opposition, resulting in frequent and intense clashes between the two groups.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Tripoli has a hot-summer Mediterranean climate (&quot;Csa&quot;) with mild wet winters and very dry, hot summers. Temperatures are moderated throughout the year due to the warm Mediterranean current coming from Western Europe. Therefore, temperatures are warmer in the winter by around 10 °C (18 °F) and cooler in the summer by around 7 °C (13 °F) compared to the inland parts of Lebanon. Although snow is an extremely rare event that only occurs around once every ten years, hail is common and occurs fairly regularly in the winter. Rainfall is concentrated in the winter months, with the summer typically being very dry.

===Offshore islands===

Tripoli has many offshore islands. The Palm Islands Nature Reserve, or the Rabbits&#x27; Island, is the largest of the islands with an area of . The name &quot;Araneb&quot; or Rabbits comes from the great numbers of rabbits that were kept on the island during the time of the French mandate early in the 20th century. It is now a nature reserve for green turtles, rare birds and rabbits. Declared as a protected area by UNESCO in 1992, camping, setting fires or other depredation is forbidden. In addition to its scenic landscape, the Palm Island is also a cultural heritage site. Evidence for human occupation, dated back to the Crusader period, was uncovered during 1973 excavations by the General Directorate of Antiquities. The Bakar Islands, also known as Abdulwahab Island, were leased to the company of Adel and Khiereddine Abdulwahab as a shipyard, during the Ottoman imperial rule and which is still a ship and marine contractor. It was also known as St Thomas Island during the Crusades.

The island on the opposite side of Palms Island, which is a large flat sandy beach, is Ramkin Island. This island is largely made up of cliffs and rocks.

==Landmarks==
=== Citadel of Tripoli ===
The Citadel of Tripoli is also known as the Castle of Saint-Gilles ( &quot;Qalʻat Sān Jīl&quot;; ), in reference to Raymond de Saint-Gilles, who dominated the city in 1102 and commanded a fortress to be built in which he named Mont Pèlerin (Mount Pilgrim). The original castle was burnt down in 1289, and rebuilt again on numerous occasions and was rebuilt in 1307–08 by Emir Essendemir Kurgi.

Later the citadel was rebuilt in part by the Ottoman Empire which can be seen today, with its massive Ottoman gateway, over which is an engraving from Süleyman the Magnificent who had ordered the restoration. In the early 19th century, the Citadel was extensively restored by the Ottoman Governor of Tripoli Mustafa Agha Barbar.

===Clock Tower===
The Clock Tower is one of the most iconic monuments in Tripoli. The tower is located in Al-Tell square, and was gifted to the city by the Ottoman Sultan Abdul Hamid II. It was erected in 1906 to celebrate the 30th year of Abdulhamid II of the Ottoman Empire, like the Jaffa Clock Tower in Israel and many others throughout the Empire.

The Clock Tower underwent a renovation in 1992, and now the clock tower is again operational.

===Hammams===
When Tripoli was visited by Ibn Batutah in 1355, he described the newly rebuilt Mamluk city. &quot;Traversed by water-channels and full of’ gardens&quot;, he writes, &quot;the houses are newly built. The sea lies two leagues distant, and the ruins of the old town are seen on the sea-shore. It was taken by the Franks, but al-Malik ath-Tháhir (Qala’un) retook it from them, and then laid the place in ruins and built the present town. There are fine baths here.’’

The hammams built in Tripoli by the early Mamluk governors were splendid edifices and many of them survive to the present. Some of the best known are:
*Abed
*Izz El-Din
*Hajeb
*Jadid
*An-Nouri, built 1333 by the Mamluk governor Nur El-Din, is located in the vicinity of the Grand Mosque.

===Oscar Niemeyer&#x27;s Rachid Karame Fairground===

The International Fair of Tripoli site, formally known as the Rachid Karami International Exhibition Center, is a complex of buildings designed by the Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer who was commissioned for the project in 1962. The site was built for a World&#x27;s Fair event to be held in the city, but construction was halted in 1975 due to the outbreak of the Lebanese civil war, and never resumed. The site contains 15 partly-completed Niemeyer buildings within an approximate area near Tripoli&#x27;s southern entrance. &quot;More recent years have seen the fairground undermined by a mixture of periodic instability and nonsensical administrative procedures that make it virtually impossible to put the facility to use. If the city needed any more physical metaphors for decay, the fairground is flanked by a Quality Inn that is literally falling apart, and whose ownership is years overdue on payment to the site’s administrators.&quot;

In 2023, the Rashid Karami International Fair was added to both the World Heritage List and the List of World Heritage in Danger.

===Tripoli Railway Station===
===Churches===
Many churches in Tripoli are a reminder of the history of the city. These churches also show the diversity of Christians in Lebanon and particularly in Tripoli:

*Saint Michael Cathedral of the Maronite Catholic Archeparchy 
*St. Elie Greek Orthodox Church
*St. Ephrem Syriac Orthodox Church
*St Francis Roman Catholic Church 
*St. Georges Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral 
*Saint Hokekalousd Armenian Orthodox Church
*St. John of the Pilgrims Mount church Maronite Catholic Church
*Our Lady of the Annunciation Melkite Greek Catholic Cathedral
*Then National Evangelical Church
===Mosques===

Tripoli is richly supplied with mosques, In every district of the city there is a mosque, many of which are small. During the Mamluk era, there was an extensive mosque-building program to bolster the new Islamic regime and many still remain until today.

Some of the notable mosques are:

*Al-Attar Mosque
*Abou Bakr Al Siddeeq
*Arghoun Shah
*Al-Burtasi Mosque
*Kabir al Aali
*Mahmoud Beik the Sanjak
*Mansouri Great Mosque
*Omar Ibn El-Khattab Mosque

*Al Shokr Mosque
*Zafer Bellah Mosque
*Al Wafaa’ Mosque
*Al-Uwaysiyat Mosque
*Mu&#x27;allaq Mosque

The Al-Ghuraba cemetery is located within the city.

==Education==

Tripoli has a large number of schools of all levels, public and private. It is also served by several universities within the city limits as well as in its urban area.

The universities in Tripoli and its metro area are:
*University of Tripoli Lebanon
*The Lebanese University – North Lebanon Branch
*Universite St Joseph – North Lebanon
*Lebanese International University (Dahr el Ein, Just outside the city)
*Al-Manar University of Tripoli (changed to &quot;City University&quot;)
*Jinan University
*University of Balamand (Qelhat, in the Koura district, just outside the city)
*Notre Dame University (Barsa, in the Koura district, just outside the city)
*Arts, Sciences and Technology University in Lebanon-North Lebanon Branch
*Beirut Arab University – North Lebanon Branch
*Universite Saint Espirt de Kaslik – Chekka ( Just Outside The City )
*Université de Technologie et de Sciences Appliquées Libano-Française (chamber of commerce)
*Azm university

==Economy==
Tripoli stands out as one of Lebanon&#x27;s economically poorest cities, marked by a substantial division between the affluent and poor residents. The city grapples with elevated unemployment rates, and certain impoverished neighborhoods have become strongholds for Islamist and other radical factions.

===Commerce===
Tripoli, while once economically comparable to Beirut, has declined in recent decades. Organisations such as the Business Incubation Association in Tripoli (BIAT) are currently trying to revive traditional export businesses such as furniture production, artisanal copper goods, soaps, as well as to expand new industries such as ICT offshore services and new technological applications.

The Tripoli Special Economic Zone (TSEZ) was established in 2008 to provide exemptions from many taxes and duties for investment projects that have more than $300,000 of capital and more than half their workers from Lebanon. It is a 55-hectare site adjacent to the Port of Tripoli.

Recently, a Tripoli development plan called &quot;Tripoli Vision 2020&quot; has been formulated and supported by a number of advisory councils including influential key government officials and prominent businessmen in the city. The goal of the project is to provides a comprehensive framework consisting of promoting investment, investing, training, re-skilling, talent placement and output promotion to reinvigorate the city&#x27;s economy. The Tripoli Vision 2020 was sponsored by the Prime Minister Saad Hariri Office and the Tripoli MPs Joint Office with the comprehensive study conducted by Samir Chreim of SCAS Inc.

=== Inequality ===
Tripoli embodies Lebanon&#x27;s extreme wealth inequality: Although it is one of the country&#x27;s most concentrated centers of poverty, it is also the hometown of several extravagantly wealthy politicians, notably including Najib Mikati, Taha Mikati and Mohammad Safadi who are accused of accumulating their wealth by embezzling government funds.

===The Soap Khan===
The khan, built around a square courtyard decorated with a fountain, houses soap making workshops and shops. At the end of the 15th century, the governor of Tripoli Yusuf Sayfa Pasha established Khan Al Saboun (the hotel of soap traders). This market was finished at the beginning of the 16th century, the last days of the Mamluk rule. The raw material used for these kinds of soap is olive oil. 
===Khan el-Khayyatin–the Tailors&#x27; Khan===
Unlike other khans built around a square courtyard, el-Khayyatin, built in the 14th century, is a 60 meter long passage with arches on each side.

===Arabic sweets===
Tripoli is regionally known for its Arabic sweets.

==Environmental issues==
Lebanese public opinion and Lebanese authorities rarely react to minor oil spills from merchant ships calling at Lebanese ports. Being without inspection, and discharging close to the shore, oil tankers pollute the coast. These pollutions have a direct effect on the marine life.

==International relations==
===Twin towns – Sister cities===
Tripoli is twinned with:
* Naples, Italy
* Larnaca, Cyprus
* Gaziantep, Turkey
* Faro, Portugal
* Toulouse, France
* Miami, USA
* Ayia Napa, Cyprus

<text>Port Phillip (Kulin: &quot;Narm-Narm&quot;) or Port Phillip Bay is a horsehead-shaped enclosed bay on the central coast of southern Victoria, Australia. The bay opens into the Bass Strait via a short, narrow channel known as The Rip, and is completely surrounded by localities of Victoria&#x27;s two largest cities — metropolitan Greater Melbourne in the bay&#x27;s main eastern portion north of the Mornington Peninsula, and the city of Greater Geelong in the much smaller western portion (known as the Corio Bay) north of the Bellarine Peninsula. Geographically, the bay covers and the shore stretches roughly , with the volume of water around . Most of the bay is navigable, although it is extremely shallow for its size — the deepest portion is only and half the bay is shallower than . Its waters and coast are home to seals, whales, dolphins, corals and many kinds of seabirds and migratory waders.

Before European settlement, the area around Port Phillip was divided between the territories of the Wathaurong (west), Wurundjeri (north) and Boonwurrung (south and east) people, all part of the indigeous Kulin nation. The first Europeans to enter the bay were the crews of , commanded by John Murray and, ten weeks later, commanded by Matthew Flinders, in 1802. Subsequent expeditions into the bay took place in 1803 to establish the first settlement in Victoria, near Sorrento, but was abandoned in 1804. Thirty years later, settlers from Tasmania returned to establish Melbourne (now Victoria&#x27;s capital city) at the mouth of the Yarra River in 1835, and Geelong at Corio Bay in 1838. Today, Port Phillip is the most densely populated catchment in Australia with an estimated 5.5 million people living around the bay; Melbourne&#x27;s suburbs extend around much of the northern and eastern shorelines, and the city of Geelong sprawls around Corio Bay in the bay&#x27;s western arm.

==History==

===Prehistory===

Port Phillip formed between the end of the last Ice Age around 8000 BCE and around 6000 BCE, when the sea-level rose to drown the vast river plains, wetlands and lakes at what was then the lower reaches of the Yarra River. The ancient Yarra and its tributaries (the other present-day rivers of the Port Phillip catchment) flowed down what is now the middle of the bay, formed a coastal lake in the southern reaches of the bay dammed by The Heads, and subsequently pouring out into a closed bay that formed over the western portion of the prehistoric Bassian Plain, which was later completely flooded and became Bass Strait.

The Aboriginal people inhabited the area long before the bay was formed, with evidence of occupation dating at least 40,000 years ago. Settler records indicate an oral history with at least 18,000 years of linearity when Boonwurrung Elder Ningerranarro spoke of his ancestors hunting kangaroo and possum where the Bay now lies. Large piles of semi-fossilised seashells known as middens can still be seen in places around the shoreline, marking the spots where Aboriginal people held feasts. They made a good living from the abundant sea-life, which included penguins and seals. In the cold season, they wore possum-skin cloaks and intricate feathered head-dresses.

A dry period combined with sand bar formation, may have dried the bay out as recently as between 800 BCE and 1000 CE.
Seismicity has been observed around the bay continually since the 1800s with earlier earthquakes recorded in local newspaper reports. 

An earthquake that occurred in July 1885 was described in a newspaper. 
Anthonys Nose is an escarpment landform of Devonian granite on the Mornington Peninsula that is located where Arthurs Seat ends as the mountain falls steeply towards Port Phillip and is part of the Selwyn Fault. 
===European exploration===
In 1800, Lieutenant James Grant was the first known European to pass through Bass Strait from west to east in . He was also the first to see, and crudely chart, the south coast from Cape Banks in South Australia to Wilsons Promontory in Victoria. Grant gave the name &quot;Governor King&#x27;s Bay&quot; to the body of water between Cape Otway and Wilsons Promontory, but did not venture in and discover Port Phillip.
The first Europeans to find and enter Port Phillip, were the crew of the &quot;Lady Nelson&quot;, commanded by John Murray, which entered the bay on 15 February 1802. The bay was then known as Narm-Narm by the people of the Kulin tribe, and Murray called the bay Port King after the Governor of New South Wales, Philip Gidley King. On 4 September 1805, King formally renamed it Port Phillip, in honour of his predecessor Arthur Phillip. Murray chose to base the &quot;Lady Nelson&quot; off what is now known as Sorrento Beach.

During this voyage, Murray records in his journal his first encounter with local Aboriginal peoples. This initially friendly encounter started with trading, eating, and gifting, and was suddenly interrupted by a violent ambush by a large group of Aboriginal people.

The crew in response shot at the Aboriginal people, and continued to shoot at them as they fled, inflicting likely mortal wounds on two of the Aboriginal people. Watching from the boat, Murray ordered grapeshot and round shot to be fired from the carronades aboard the ship at the fleeing Aboriginal people. Murray said After exploring the southern part of the bay, Murray formally took possession of the area on 8 March 1802 for King George III of Great Britain in a small ceremony at a place now known as the Point King Foreshore Reserve in Sorrento. A few days later Murray sailed out of the heads and returned to Sydney.

About ten weeks after Murray, Matthew Flinders in also found and entered the bay, unaware Murray had been there. The official history of Nicholas Baudin&#x27;s explorations in &quot;Le Géographe&quot; claimed they too had sighted the entrance at that time (30 March 1802) but this is almost certainly a later embellishment or error, being absent from the ship&#x27;s logs and Baudin&#x27;s own accounts. As a result of Murray&#x27;s and Flinders&#x27; reports, King sent Lieutenant Charles Robbins in to explore Port Phillip fully. This surveying party, which included Charles Grimes, produced a mostly complete chart of Port Phillip including the mouth of the Yarra River, which they visited on 2 February 1803. Robbins found Aboriginal habitations and groups of Aboriginal people at Tootgarook, Carrum Carrum, on the banks of the Yarra and at Geelong.

===British settlement===
King decided to place a convict settlement at Port Phillip, mainly to stake a claim to southern Australia ahead of the French. On 10 October 1803 a convoy of two ships and &quot;Ocean&quot; led by Captain David Collins carrying 402 people (5 Government officials, 9 officers of marines, 2 drummers, and 39 privates, 5 soldiers&#x27; wives and a child, and 307 convicts with 17 convicts&#x27; wives and 7 children) entered Port Phillip. After some investigation it was decided to establish the settlement at a spot known as Sullivan Bay, very close to where Sorrento now exists. The expedition landed at Sullivan Bay on 17 October 1803, and the first of the &quot;orders&quot; issued by Collins bears that date. On 25 October, the King&#x27;s birthday, the British flag was hoisted over the tiny settlement and a little salvo of musketry celebrated the royal occasion.

On 25 November the first white child was born in Victoria and was baptised on Christmas Day, receiving the name of William James Hobart Thorne. The first marriage took place on 28 November, when a free woman, Hannah Harvey was wedded to convict Richard Garrett. Small exploratory groups from this settlement surveyed a land route to Western Port and also sailed to the northwest shore of Port Phillip. On this latter journey, a large group of about 200 Aboriginal people came to meet the Britishers with &quot;hostile intentions&quot;, and &quot;with the application of fire-arms absolutely necessary to repel them&quot;, several Aboriginal people were shot. Lack of fresh water and good timber led this first British attempt at settlement in the region later known as Victoria to be abandoned on 27 January 1804. When Collins left Port Phillip, the &quot;Calcutta&quot; proceeded to Sydney, and the &quot;Ocean&quot; to Risdon Cove in Tasmania, where they arrived on 15 February 1804. Prior to abandonment, a group of convicts including William Buckley, escaped from the settlement. Buckley took up residence in a cave near Point Lonsdale on the western side of the bay&#x27;s entrance, The Rip, and later lived with an Aboriginal Australian group for many years, being given up for dead.

Port Phillip was then left mostly undisturbed until 1835, when settlers from Tasmania led by John Batman and John Pascoe Fawkner (who had been at the Sorrento settlement as a child) established Melbourne on the lower reaches of the Yarra. John Batman encountered William Buckley who then became an important translator in negotiations with the local Aboriginal tribesmen. In 1838 Geelong was founded, and became the main port serving the growing wool industry of the Western District. For a time Geelong rivalled Melbourne as the leading settlement on the bay, but the Gold Rush which began in 1851 gave Melbourne a decisive edge as the largest town in Victoria.

===Growth and development of Melbourne===

As Melbourne prospered, its wealthy classes discovered the recreational uses of Port Phillip. Bayside suburbs such as St Kilda and Brighton were established on the east shore of the bay. Later, resorts further south such as Sorrento and Portsea became popular. The more swampy western shores of the bay were not so favoured, and have been used mainly for non-residential purposes such as agriculture, the Point Cook Royal Australian Air Force base and the Werribee Sewage Farm, and significant nature reserves. In recent decades the population along the western side of the bay has grown more rapidly.

In the 21st century, property along the Port Phillip coastline continues to be highly sought after. Port Phillip continues to be extensively used for recreational pursuits such as swimming, cycling, boating, and fishing. The bay also features a number of historical walks and fauna reserves. The traditional land owners of the area have also been acknowledged at a number of sites.

==Geography==

Port Phillip lies in southern Victoria, separated from Bass Strait by the Bellarine Peninsula to the southwest and Mornington Peninsula to the southeast. It is the largest bay in Victoria and one of the largest inland bays in Australia. The narrow entrance to the bay, called the Rip, between Point Lonsdale and Point Nepean, features strong tidal streams made turbulent by the uneven contours of the seabed. The best time for small craft to enter the Rip is at slack water. Large ships require expert local guidance to enter and exit, provided by the Port Phillip maritime pilots. Work has begun to deepen the channel entrance, to allow newer, larger container ships to access Melbourne&#x27;s docks.

The eastern side of the bay is characterised by sandy beaches extending from St Kilda, Sandringham, Beaumaris, Carrum, and down the Mornington Peninsula to Frankston, Safety Beach/Dromana and Rye to Portsea. Longshore drift carries sand from south to north during winter and from north to south during summer. Cliff erosion control has often resulted in sand starvation, necessitating offshore dredging to replenish the beach. On the western side of the bay there is a greater variety of beach types, including both sandy and sandstone rock beaches, seen at Queenscliff, St Leonards, Indented Head, Portarlington, Altona and Geelong&#x27;s Eastern Beach. Numerous sandbanks and shoals occur in the southern section of the bay, and parts of the South Channel require occasional maintenance dredging.

===Climate===
The region has an oceanic climate (Köppen &quot;Cfb&quot;) with warm summers possessing occasional very hot days due to northerly winds and mild winters. Annual rainfall, which is evenly distributed over the year, shows considerable variation due to the Otway Ranges to the southwest: the northwestern shore of the bay is the driest part of southern Victoria and almost approaches a semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;) with a mean annual rainfall as low as (comparable to Nhill or Numurkah), whilst the eastern shores less shielded by the Otways receive as much as . Summer temperatures average around during the day and at night, but occasional northerly winds can push temperatures over , whilst in winter a typical day will range from to .

Port Phillip is often warmer than the surrounding oceans and/or the land mass, particularly in spring and autumn; this can set up a &quot;bay-effect rain&quot;, similar to the &quot;lake effect snow&quot; seen in colder climates, where showers are intensified leeward of the bay (particularly in Melbourne&#x27;s eastern suburbs).

===Beaches===
Port Phillip hosts many beaches, most of which are flat, shallow and long, with very small breaks making swimming quite safe. This attracts many tourists, mostly families, to the beaches of Port Phillip during the summer months and school holidays. Water sports such as body boarding and surfing are difficult or impossible, except in extreme weather conditions. However, stand up paddle boarding (SUP), kite surfing and wind surfing are very popular. Most sandy beaches are located on the bay&#x27;s northern, eastern and southern shorelines, while the western shorelines host a few sandy beaches, there mostly exists a greater variety of beaches, swampy wetlands and mangroves. The occasional pebble beach and rocky cliffs can also be found, mostly in the southern reaches.
* Major beaches include: St. Kilda Beach, Brighton Beach, Sandringham Beach, Dromana Beach

===Rivers and creeks===
* Rivers: Yarra River, Maribyrnong River, Patterson River, Little River, Werribee River.
* Creeks: Elwood Canal, Mordialloc Creek, Kananook Creek, Sweetwater Creek, Balcombe Creek, Chinamans Creek, Cowies Creek, Hovells Creek, Kororoit Creek.

===Islands===
Due to its shallow depth, several artificial islands and forts have been built; however, despite the depth, it only hosts a few true islands. Many sandy, muddy banks and shallows exist in its southern reaches, such as Mud Islands, but most islands are located in the marshy shallows of Swan Bay. Some of the bay&#x27;s major islands include:
* Swan Island
* Mud Islands
* Duck Island
* South Channel Fort (artificial)
* Pope&#x27;s Eye (artificial)

===Surrounding mountains and hills===
* Arthurs Seat 314 m
* Mount Martha 160 m
* Mount Eliza
* Olivers Hill
* Flinders Peak 364 m

===Surrounding lakes===
* Albert Park Lake
* Cherry Lake
* Lake Borrie
* Lake Carramar, Lake Illawong and Lake Legana of Patterson Lakes
* Lake Connewarre
* Lake Victoria
* RAAF Lake
* Sanctuary Lakes (artificial)
* Salt Lagoon

==Ecology==

Jellyfish are a familiar sight in Port Phillip, and its waters are home to species such as Australian fur seals, bottlenose dolphins, common dolphins, humpback whales, and southern right whales. Many other cetacean species may also migrate off the areas. The smooth toadfish is one of the most common fishes in muddy areas. The bay has many endemic species including the bluedevil fish and fantastic sponge walls on the Lonsdale wall in the heads of the bay. It also hosts breeding colonies of Australian fur seals. Occasionally, Australian sea lions, New Zealand fur seals, subantarctic fur seals, and leopard seals may come into the bay as well. Certain individual southern elephant seals may frequent the bay as well.

Swan Bay, adjacent to Queenscliff, is an important feeding ground for waterbirds and migratory waders. The Mud Islands, off Sorrento, are an important breeding habitat for white-faced storm petrels, silver gulls, Australian pelicans and Pacific gulls. Salt marshes in the northwestern sections of the bay, such as that in the Werribee Sewage Farm and the adjacent Spit Nature Conservation Reserve, are within the Port Phillip Bay (Western Shoreline) and Bellarine Peninsula Ramsar Site, listed as wetlands of international importance under the Ramsar Convention, and the critically endangered orange-bellied parrot is found at three wintering sites with saltmarsh habitat around Port Phillip and the Bellarine Peninsula. A variety of seabirds, such as Australasian gannets, nest on artificial structures in the bay.

Port Phillip contains 3 Marine Sanctuaries managed by Parks Victoria to protect and conserve the bay&#x27;s biodiversity, ecological processes and the natural and heritage features.

Port Phillip&#x27;s marine water quality is monitored by the Environment Protection Authority of Victoria and was fluctuating between Good to Very Good across the bay in 2021-2022.

===Original flora and fauna===
In 1906, George Gordon McCrae wrote two letters to a local schoolmaster at Dromana, Mr G.H. Rogers. His subject was his earliest recollections of an idyllic boyhood spent at Arthur&#x27;s Seat Run, location of the historic McCrae Homestead on the southern shore of the bay, part of the Mornington Peninsula. In the letters he described in detail the natural history of the area in the 1840s, and the species he particularly remembered 60 years later. In 1939, Charles Daley read an article before the Royal Historical Society of Victoria based on these letters, which was published in its journal in 1940 the year after a large bushfire in January 1939 hastened the disappearance of much of the original surviving wildlife from the area. The names of the species reflect the titles given to them by the original European settlers of the bay.

The animals he observed as a young boy were &quot;immense droves of kangaroos, brush kangaroos or wallaby, paddy-melon, bandicoots (two varieties), great opossum (two varieties), ring tail, flying squirrel, flying mouse, dingoes or wild dogs in the gullies, that were caught in box traps with sliding doors, porcupine ant eater or echidna that were at the back of Arthur&#x27;s Seat mountain, the great iguana, tree lizard- 5 feet, python, and the rock or sleeping lizard.&quot;

The trees were coast banksia, honey suckle, and grass trees &quot;with crowns for thatching&quot;. The gum of &quot;Xanthorrhoea australis&quot; was used for carriage varnish.

In the waters of the bay he described &quot;scallop shells which were used as an oil lamp with a bulrush wick, banks of cockles covered with birds, grey and white gulls, a 13-16 lb size schnapper ground off Mt Martha Point, mutton fish or venus ear- bait, coatfish, parrot fish, leather jackets, flathead, dog fish, sting rays, shark tailed rays, and pig fish that he thought to be &quot;very old&quot;.

On the beaches could be sighted pelicans, penguins, grey and grey white gull, called &quot;bungan&quot; by aborigines (the Bunurong Mayone-bulluk clan), small white and lavender gull, pied oyster catchers, terns, cormorants, the little sandpiper, and musk ducks.

In the swamps (which have since been filled in) were &quot;The Nankeen bird with one long white feather behind the ear, The rail, The bittern, The snipe and jack snipe, Several ducks- wood duck, black duck, Teal, Spoonbill, Black swan Geese, Cranes, Blue and white coots, Water hens, Kingfishers here and there and swamp or ground parrot with the barred tail feathers.&quot;

In the scrub by the waterholes were &quot;honey eaters, warblers, red coat robins, emu wren with 2 long feathers in tail, Laughing jack ass- everywhere, butcher bird, also known as shrike or whistling jackass, Quail where coverage good in bottom of scrub, turkey at Boneo and the big swamp off the property.&quot;

On the flats were found spur wing plovers, minas, and leatherheads.

In timbers near the flats were &quot;many varieties of parrots, Lorry, Rosella, Blue mountain or honeysuckle parrot, Sulphur –crested white cockatoo, Black cockatoo of two kinds, Grey cockatoo with scarlet crest and Corella or cockatoo parrot.&quot;

Among the cherry trees in the garden at the homestead were &quot;bronzewing pigeon and satin birds, love birds and honeyeating parakeets.&quot;

Birds of prey were &quot;eagle hawks, falcons, and owls, some white and of great size&quot;.

====Cetaceans====

Small numbers of common dolphins have become residents in eastern parts of the bay since the late 2000s.
In recent years, the numbers of southern humpback and southern right whales entering the bay of Port Phillip have shown increases. Unlike in Portland and on Great Ocean Road, Southern Rights in eastern Victorian waters are still critically endangered and in very small numbers; however, presences of cow-calf pairs in the bay in recent years indicate that Port Phillip was possibly once a wintering/calving ground for these whales. They swim very close to shores to take rests in shallow, sheltered waters, sometimes just next to piers in Frankston.

=====Burrunan dolphins=====
The bay is home to about 100 to 150 of the recently described species of bottlenose dolphin, the Burrunan dolphin (&quot;Tursiops australis&quot;). The other 50 or so of this rare species are to be found in the Gippsland Lakes.

===Shellfish reefs===
Port Phillip has lost over 95% of native flat oyster and blue mussel reefs since European settlement. In 2014 the Port Phillip Shellfish Reef restoration project set about restoring shellfish reefs at two locations off Hobsons Bay near St Kilda, and off Corio Bay near Avalon. 300,000 native Angasi oysters were laid on limestone rubble over a 600 square metre area. The project aimed to improve marine biodiversity, water quality and fish habitat.

===Environmental issues===
Like the Yarra which flows into it, Port Phillip faces the environmental concerns of pollution and water quality. Litter, silt and toxins can affect the beaches to the point where they are shut down by EPA Victoria.

In 2008, the owner and master of Hong Kong-registered container vessel MV &quot;Sky Lucky&quot; were found liable for illegally disposing garbage into Port Phillip, convicted and fined $35,000.

An Environmental Management Plan has been adopted for 2017-2027 in order to improve and ensure the water quality is helping the marine life flourish as well as divide the supervising of the Bay between the government, community and industries.

==Shipping==

===History===

The southern section of the Bay near the Heads is covered by extensive sand banks, known as the &quot;Great Sand&quot;. A shipping channel was dredged in an east–west direction from the Heads to near Arthur&#x27;s Seat late in the nineteenth century, and maintained ever since. Early shipping used piers at Sandridge (Port Melbourne), but later moved to various wharves along the Yarra River, which make up today&#x27;s Port of Melbourne. The Melbourne Harbor Trust and Geelong Harbor Trust were responsible for the piers and wharves in their respective cities — they are now the government owned Port of Melbourne Corporation and the privately operated GeelongPort.

Today, the Port of Melbourne has grown to become Australia&#x27;s busiest commercial port, serving Australia&#x27;s second largest city and handling an enormous amount of imports and exports into and out of the country. The Port of Geelong also handles a large volume of dry bulk and oil, while nearby Port of Hastings on Western Port handles steel and oil products.

In 2004 the Victorian Government launched the Port Phillip Channel Deepening Project to deepen the existing shipping channels and the lower Yarra to accommodate deeper draft vessels. The lower Yarra sediments were identified as likely to be contaminated with toxic chemicals and heavy metals, and were to be contained within a sealed berm clear of the shipping channels south of the Yarra entrance. The vessel chosen for the dredging is the Queen of the Netherlands. 52 environmental groups, recreational fishing groups, and divers&#x27; groups formed the &quot;Blue Wedges&quot; group to oppose the proposed channel deepening and dredging with organised protests carried out, culminating in the group taking action in the Federal Court in January 2008 against the Commonwealth to stop it signing off on the project. On 15 January 2008 it was announced that their appeal was dismissed, with dredging starting soon after. The government announced the completion of works in November 2009, ahead of schedule and $200 million under budget.

===Shipping channels===
* South Channel – Extends from the area of the rip in an easterly direction where it terminates off the coast of Arthurs Seat. Vessels with a draught of 14.0m can be navigated through the channel at all tides. This is the main commercial shipping channel in the south of the bay allowing large ships access between the entrance of the bay and its middle regions.
* West Channel – Extends from the area of the rip, heads towards the north-west and ends off the coast of St Leonards. The depth varies, in May 1998 there was a minimum of 4.1 metres. Non-commercial vessels are still navigated through the channel; however, it is no longer used for commercial shipping.
*The Rip – Also referred to as &quot;the heads&quot; for shipping purposes, vessels with a draught of 14.0m can be navigated through the Heads during any height of tide. However, the passage of vessels can be restricted when the current through the rip is too strong. The flow through the Rip can be up to 8 knots dependent on the range of tide and environmental conditions.
* Melbourne Channels – Extends northwards through Hobsons Bay towards Station Pier and the entrance to the Yarra River. It is dredged to a depth of 15.5 metres and is the main shipping channel through the north of the bay into Melbourne&#x27;s ports and docks. The channels include:
:Melbourne Channel
:Williamstown Channel
:Port Melbourne Channel
* Geelong Channels – Begins off the coast of Point Richards and runs in a westerly direction through Outer Harbour and into Corio Bay where it splits in two heading north towards the modern Port of Geelong and south towards Cunningham Pier. The main Geelong channels are dredged to 12.3m. The City Channel while once used for wool exports is no longer used for commercial shipping. The channels include:
:Point Richards Shipping Channel
:Wilson Spit Shipping Channel
:Hopetoun Shipping Channel
:City Channel
:Corio Channel

* Bulk Grain Pier
* Corio Quay
* Cunningham Pier
* Gellibrand Pier
* Lascelles Wharf

===Ferries===
* Searoad Ferries operates a vehicular ferry service across the mouth of the bay between Queenscliff and Sorrento using two roll-on roll-off vessels. 
:Between: Sorrento Pier, Sorrento
:And: The Cut Pier, Queenscliff
* Port Phillip Ferries run twice daily fast ferry services between Melbourne Docklands and Portarlington on the Bellarine Peninsula and Docklands and Geelong. In 2017 they commissioned a new Incat ferry &quot;Bellarine Express&quot;. In 2019 it was joined by another Incat ferry of the same design &quot;Geelong Flyer&quot; which runs the service to Geelong.
* Ferries also run from St Kilda to Williamstown, Victoria across Hobsons Bay. These ferries, like the many recreational cruises, mostly operate for tourists and run around the bay in various locations.
* Spirit of Tasmania Ferry (passenger and vehicles)
:Between: Spirit of Tasmania Quay, Geelong
:And: Devonport, Tasmania

==Tourism==
The bay is one of Victoria&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations. Many residents of Melbourne holiday on the shorelines of the bay, particularly the Bellarine (South west, near Geelong) and Mornington (south east of Melbourne) Peninsulas, most annually, either camping in tents, caravan or villas in caravan parks, sharing rental houses or staying in holiday homes.

==Recreation and sport==

Port Phillip&#x27;s mostly flat topography and moderate waves make perfect conditions for recreational swimming, kitesurfing, windsurfing, sailing, boating, snorkeling, scuba diving, stand up paddle boarding (SUP) and other sports.

Port Phillip is home to 36 yacht clubs. It also hosts the Melbourne to Hobart and Melbourne to Launceston Yacht Races. Port Phillip is also home to a number of marinas, including large marinas at St. Kilda, Brighton and Geelong. For the 1956 Summer Olympics, it hosted the sailing events.

Dozens of lifesaving clubs dot Port Phillip, especially on the east coast from Altona to Frankston. These clubs provide volunteer lifesaving services and conduct sporting carnivals.

Port Phillip is also known as a temperate water scuba diving destination. The shore dives from beaches and piers around the Bay provide a wide variety of experiences on day and night dives. Boat diving in Port Phillip provides access to a remarkable variety of diving environments including wrecks, reefs, drift dives, scallop dives, seal dives and wall dives. Of particular interest are the five scuttled J-Class World War 1 submarines and the Ships&#x27; Graveyard off Torquay. With 3 Marine Sanctuaries and easily accessible piers, Port Phillip is also popular for recreational snorkeling.

There are also a number of bike paths, including the Bayside Trail and the Hobsons Bay Coastal Trail.

<text>The Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR; ) was a railway network in Hong Kong. It was owned and operated by the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) until 2007. Rapid transit services, a light rail system, feeder bus routes within Hong Kong, and intercity passenger and freight train services to China on the KCR network, have been operated by the MTR Corporation since 2007.

While still owned by its previous operator, the KCR network (which is wholly owned by the Hong Kong Government through the KCRC) has been operated by the MTR Corporation Limited under a 50-year, extensible, service concession since 2 December 2007. The two companies have merged their local metro lines into one unified fare system. Immediately after the merger, steps were taken to integrate the network into the same fare system as the MTR, and gates between the two networks were removed in several stages in 2008. Although the MTR Corporation is a listed company, the Hong Kong Government is the controlling shareholder with a stake of about 75%.

In 2006, the local KCR local passenger train network (i.e. intercity services excluded) recorded an annual ridership of 544 million.

==History==
===19th century===
During the 19th century, the western colonial powers competed with each other to establish and maintain commercial and political spheres of influence in China. Hong Kong held a vital position in protecting British trading interests in South China. The idea of connecting Hong Kong and China with a railway was first proposed to prominent Hong Kong businessmen in March 1864 by a British railway engineer, Sir Rowland MacDonald Stephenson, who had considerable experience of developing railways in India. The minutes of the committee of the Chamber of Commerce meeting in Hong Kong, where a letter setting out his ideas was considered on 7 March 1864, stated that&quot; &quot;the opinions of the Chamber in respect to his suggestions should be recorded in the form of a letter, to the effect that the Committee deem it essential for the advancement of the project that short lines of railway should at first only be tried, and that it is not advisable at present to interfere with any water communications which are already established and can generally be worked more cheaply than railway traffic.&quot;&quot;

The main reason for this decision, which effectively killed MacDonald Stephenson&#x27;s idea, was that many of the businessmen concerned had a personal interest in protecting their investments in the established shipping companies that enjoyed a monopoly on carriage of passengers and goods into and out of China. It took a further 30 years before the idea of building a railway from Hong Kong to China was again given serious consideration. In the last decade of the 19th century increasing diplomatic and trade activity by France in Guangzhou (Canton) and the granting of a concession to Belgian interests to construct a railway from Beijing to Hankou, led to diplomatic and commercial concerns from the British about protecting Hong Kong as the major trading port for South China. , Qing governor of the Guangdong province, also made at the time a similar proposal for a railway connecting Guangzhou with the rural hamlet of Sham Shui Po just outside the British border. Britain was at the time vastly expanding her sphere of influence in the Far East and was striving to obtain the rest of Hong Kong up to the Sham Chun River. Li saw this chance as a method to develop Sham Shui Po as another probable trading hub. Although Li did correctly prophesy the village&#x27;s prosperity following to the annexation of the New Territories in 1898, Li&#x27;s proposal was eventually rejected by the Central Government in favour of the budget being allocated to the much anticipated Guangzhou–Hankou railway. The British, however, caught up with this proposal and the idea of a railway similar to this was first considered with much interest.

The British Government extracted a number of railway concessions from the Chinese Government for the British &amp; Chinese Corporation, a joint venture formed in 1898 between the trading company of Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank. These concessions included the right to construct and operate a railway from Kowloon to Guangzhou that would link to the Beijing–Hankou–Guangzhou line.

While the British &amp; Chinese Corporation undertook a preliminary survey of the proposed route of the line in 1899, the financial uncertainties created by the Boxer Rebellion in China (1899–1901) and the Boer War (1899–1902) in South Africa made it difficult for the corporation to raise funds for the project. However, by the beginning of the 20th century, the Hong Kong Government under the leadership of the colony&#x27;s governor, Sir Henry Blake, decided that urgent action was required.

===1904–1945: Construction and early years===
Discussions between the Colonial Office in London, the Hong Kong Government and the British &amp; Chinese Corporation, led to an agreement in late 1904 that the Hong Kong Government would undertake the financing, construction and operation of the section of the line within Hong Kong. The remaining section to Guangzhou would be financed through a loan raised by the British &amp; Chinese Corporation on behalf of the Chinese Government, which would operate the section after its construction by the corporation.

Settling the detailed financing arrangements for the British and Chinese sections proved to be complicated because the funding of the British Section (as it became known) depended on the raising of the loan for the Chinese Section. The arrangements were finally ratified by the Hong Kong Government&#x27;s passage of the Railway Loans Ordinance in 1905, clearing the way for construction of the British Section. It took until 1907, however, for the loan agreement for the Chinese Section to be concluded, with the financing being provided by way of a bond issue floated in London in April of the same year.

The importance attached to the project was reflected in a speech made to the Hong Kong Legislative Council by the colonial governor, Sir Frederick Lugard, in 1908:

&quot;You will recall that in 1905 it was decided to build the railway by means of a loan. It was not a question of whether the undertaking would be an immediately remunerative concern; it was not a question of whether the railway should pay interest and sinking fund on the capital expended, or even if it would at once pay working expenses. It was a question of preserving the predominance of Hong Kong. It was a question of seeing that the final outlet of the main trunk railway should be at Kowloon, and at no other place.&quot;

Two routes were suggested for the British Section, a western route of about from the tip of Kowloon peninsula via Tsuen Wan to Castle Peak Bay and thence to Yuen Long and the border with China, and a more direct eastern route of about requiring tunnelling through the Kowloon hills and thence to the border via Tide Cove (Sha Tin), Tai Po, Fanling and Sheung Shui. Following a detailed survey in 1905, the eastern route was proposed. Although the formal approval of the Colonial Office in London was not given until February 1906, the Governor, Sir Matthew Nathan, had anticipated a positive outcome and had already instructed the Public Works Department to start earthworks on the route from Tai Po Market to Fanling in December 1905.

The initial estimate for the project was HK$5,053,274, which included the cost of excavating a tunnel through the Kowloon hills at Beacon Hill and reclamation in Kowloon for a terminus. However, underestimation of the challenges, changes in design, depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar against the pound sterling (much of the equipment had to be imported from Britain), difficulties in recruiting suitable labour coupled with a high mortality and sickness rate amongst the workers (malaria, beri beri and dysentery were endemic in Hong Kong at that time) and right-of-way land acquisition costs greatly pushed up the final cost of the project.
The most difficult part of the project was the construction of the Beacon Hill Tunnel, which ended up costing about one quarter of the whole project. Together with the construction of the Sha Tau Kok line, a two-foot narrow-gauge branch railway from Fanling to Sha Tau Kok (making use of the rails and rolling stock used in the construction of the main line and later closed in April 1928), the final cost was HK$12,296,929, making it one of the most expensive railways in the world and, as costs escalated, the subject of much concern in both Hong Kong and London.

Although the design called for the construction of only a single track of a standard gauge of 4 feet 8½ inches (1,435 mm), an important decision made was to ensure that as far as possible the right-of-way of the railway, i.e. all bridges, cuttings, and embankments (with the exception of the tunnels to reduce budget), allowed for the laying of a future second track. This decision, although it might have seemed unnecessarily costly at the time, proved of benefit some 75 years later when the railway was finally double-tracked.

The railway was formally opened on Saturday, 1 October 1910, but without a terminus, this event being officially recorded by way of a notice in the following Friday&#x27;s Hong Kong Government Gazette. 


Some of the harbour at the south of the Kowloon peninsula, between Signal Hill (Blackhead Point) and Hung Hom, had taken place using material excavated from the route and carried to the site by a two-foot gauge railway. However, the final decision to locate the terminus at the tip of Kowloon peninsula was not made until 1910, and the terminus was only fully completed and commissioned in March 1916, although the platforms themselves were put into service in 1914.

The railway opened in 1910 with a number of temporary stations. Part of a godown (warehouse) next to the site of the present day Star Ferry pier in Tsim Sha Tsui was rented and converted into a passenger station with rails to it laid down Salisbury Road from Signal Hill. Temporary stations were built at Hung Hom and Lo Wu, with permanent stations being built at Sha Tin, Fanling and Tai Po (later named Tai Po Kau), and a flag stop at Tai Po Market (&quot;aka&quot;.Tai Po New Market, Tai Wo Market) which shortly became a proper station for passenger service. 1910 the Kowloon–Canton Railway owned four steam locomotives, eight coaches and 40 goods wagons.

Traffic on the new railway was at first quiet as there was little demand for passenger and freight services by the inhabitants of the then undeveloped New Territories north of Beacon Hill. Only after the Chinese Section was completed and opened in 1911 did traffic start to build up as people took advantage of the fast journey time of only 3 hours 40 minutes from Kowloon to Guangzhou.

Little changed up until the Second World War, with the commercial success of the railway being closely linked to events in China. During the defence of Hong Kong in December 1941, various bridges and tunnels were deliberately blown up by the retreating British forces. After repairs had been made, the line was operated throughout the war by the Japanese using the services of the Chinese staff who had remained after the fall of the colony. During this period the railway gradually deteriorated through lack of adequate maintenance. Rolling stock and other equipment were also sent to China for use there by the Japanese.

After the British resumed control of Hong Kong in 1945, following the defeat of Japan, the railway was in a sorry state. Initially the task of restoring the railway to a working condition rested with the military. Twelve locomotives were urgently ordered from Britain (arriving in 1946–47) and efforts focussed on bringing the railway up to a workable condition. Civilian management of the railway was again resumed in 1946.

===1945–1982: Post-war development and electrification===

The post-war management faced many problems, including lack of records, which had almost all been destroyed by the Japanese and had to be reconstructed from the memories of serving and previous staff; shortages of coal for the engines necessitating their conversion to burning fuel oil; currency exchange rate difficulties due to devaluation of the Chinese currency requiring agreement with the Chinese authorities to use the Hong Kong dollar as the basis for all transactions; worn-out equipment; and staff shortages. At the same time, there was a huge demand for passenger and freight services as people who had fled to China during the war moved back to Hong Kong, and because huge volumes of goods needed to be carried into China to help in post-war relief efforts there. From an immediate post-war figure of around 600,000, the population of Hong Kong rose to nearly 2 million by the end of 1947, with the influx reaching a rate of about 100,000 per month during this period.

Although freight demand to China gradually fell, the influx of people from China continued due to the Chinese Civil War. Through-train passenger services to China stopped on 14 October 1949, the day prior to the capture of Guangzhou by the Communists. Passengers and goods then had to be transhipped at the border. Despite the inconvenience that this caused, the railway benefitted by Hong Kong becoming the centre of communications and trade with southern China, especially as much of the traffic that had hitherto gone by sea could no longer do so. Refugees fleeing the new communist government of China also often settled in squatter areas along the railway, and this, together with an increase in the British Army&#x27;s presence, added to domestic travel demand in Hong Kong.

In 1951 agreement was reached with the Chinese authorities for goods wagons to again cross the border, but passenger services continued to terminate at the border at Lo Wu station. However, the Korean War (1950–1953) led to an embargo by western governments on certain goods being exported to China, and tough restrictions introduced by the Chinese government on the number of people allowed to cross the border, which together led to a severe decline in rail revenue.

The situation saw little improvement until 1955, and to reduce the operating costs of the steam locomotives a decision was taken in 1954 to gradually replace these with diesel locomotives. For the rest of the 1950s and 1960s, despite some short-term disturbances in 1967 resulting from a spill over into Hong Kong of the Cultural Revolution in China, both domestic and cross-border traffic continued to show steady overall growth.

One major decision taken during the late 1960s was to relocate the large railway workshops from Hung Hom to their present location at Ho Tung Lau in Sha Tin and to construct a new terminus at Hung Hom. This was necessary to permit construction of the first cross-harbour road tunnel – replacing the previous reliance on ferries to cross Victoria Harbour – and to overcome the constraints imposed on rail traffic growth by the first terminus at Tsim Sha Tsui. While the move to Ho Tung Lau took place in 1968, the Hung Hom station complex was not completed and opened until November 1975, at which time the Tsim Sha Tsui terminus was closed and shortly thereafter demolished except for the clock tower, which remains a landmark today.

So far improvements to the railway had been incremental in nature. In the 1970s it became clear that a radical rethink was needed if the railway was to cope with future demands. In 1972 the government set up a steering group to examine the need for future short-term and long-term improvements to the railway given the growth in freight and passenger traffic to China, coupled with the government&#x27;s plans to construct large new towns at Sha Tin, Tai Po, Sheung Shui and Fanling in the New Territories that would further increase domestic travel demand.

At that time the new towns were intended to be constructed to a &quot;balanced design&quot; concept under which employment opportunities as well as people would be relocated from substandard accommodation in the older urban areas, thereby minimising the additional demand on the transport network. As later became apparent, however, while people were moved in their hundreds of thousands to live in the New Territories, the major centres of employment and of leisure activities remained in the urban areas, leading to an even greater dependence on the railway to support a rapidly increasing daily commuter flow.

In 1974 a 10-year investment programme was started to provide for the complete double-tracking and electrification of the railway from Hung Hom to Lo Wu, requiring the building of a second Beacon Hill Tunnel together with the construction or upgrading of stations and other facilities. This exercise was completed by the early 1980s and on 16 July 1983 the use of diesel-hauled trains ceased for domestic passenger services. Diesel locomotives continued to be used for through-train passenger services, which resumed in 1979 following implementation by Deng Xiaoping of economic reforms in China, and for freight and track maintenance services.

One consequence of the electrification was that, whereas much of the old track in the New Territories had remained unfenced, with footpaths or roads alongside or across the track used by many villagers, the faster, quieter and more frequent electric services required the complete fencing off of the track from Lo Wu to Hung Hom, necessitating the construction of footbridges with both steps and sloping ramps at various village locations. As a former Assistant District Officer in Tai Po recalls, one of the claimed concerns of the villager elders at the time was to be able to carry coffins across the tracks to the nearest road as not all villages were served by an alternate road access.

During this 10-year period, thought had also been given by the government as to the future management of the railway. Hitherto the railway had been run as a department of the government, and was subject to the normal civil service rules and requirements. This made it difficult to take a commercial approach to operating what was increasingly becoming a major business in investment and revenue terms. Corporatisation of public services as a means to permit government-owned public utilities to operate more along the lines of private sector business was an approach that was beginning to gather interest at the time from several governments – the US and UK governments under Reagan and Thatcher being prime movers. The object of corporatisation was to allow the public service providers to make a commercial return on their assets, thus reducing the need for investment of public funds raised predominantly from taxes, while still remaining under government control.

On 24 December 1982, the KCRC Ordinance (Cap 372) was enacted and the KCR ceased to be a government department, although the statutory corporation remained wholly owned by the government. Under the Ordinance a managing board, comprising 10 members appointed by the governor (chairman, managing director and not less than 4 nor more than 8 other members), became responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the corporation. The corporation was required to&quot; &quot;perform its functions with a view to achieving a rate of return on the assets employed in its undertaking, and in accordance with ordinary commercial criteria, is satisfactory.&quot;&quot;

===1982–2004: An expanding network===


The British Section of the original Kowloon–Canton Railway was originally operated by a department within the Hong Kong Government. Following the government&#x27;s plan to corporatise the operation of the railway, the Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC) was established in December 1982, with the government remaining as the sole shareholder.

With the development and urbanisation of the New Territories, the British Section became an important corridor to connect the new towns in eastern New Territories with urban Kowloon. Electrification and conversion to a dual-track system was completed in 1984. Since then, the suburban rail became much more metro-like. Frequent service was provided, and in the 1990s trains were refurbished to provide fewer seats and more standing places.

In 1984, the KCRC accepted the government&#x27;s invitation to build and operate a light rail system in northwestern New Territories. The Light Rail Transit (known later as the KCR Light Rail, and now simply the Light Rail) was opened in 1988.

The KCRC won a bid in 1996 to build a &quot;Western Corridor Railway&quot;, later branded as the KCR West Rail and opened in 2003. The British Section of the original Kowloon–Canton Railway was renamed KCR East Rail, and the LRT became KCR Light Rail. The names &quot;Kowloon–Canton Railway&quot; or &quot;KCR&quot; has come to refer to the network operated by the KCRC. The KCR Ma On Shan Rail was opened in 2004 as a branch line to the KCR East Rail.

The KCRC also made proposals to plan, build, and operate the Kowloon Southern Link, an extension of the West Rail to connect with the East Rail; the KCRC received permission for the project from the government on 24 September 2002. Disputes on the funding and location of the eventually cancelled Canton Road station in Tsim Sha Tsui, which was in the proposed alignment, postponed the construction by a year to 2005. Construction started on 7 November 2005. The new link started operation on 16 August 2009.

===2006–2007: Takeover by MTR Corporation===

Various proposals to merge the KCRC and the other railway operator in the territory, the MTR Corporation (MTRC), had been on the government&#x27;s agenda since the 2000s. In 2006, the government, as the sole shareholder of the KCRC, decided that the two railway networks should be merged with the MTRC being granted a service concession to operate the KCR network for an initial period of 50 years. The decision was passed by the Executive Council on 11 April 2006, and was later approved by the Legislative Council and the minority shareholders of the MTRC (the government, which had a 75% stake in the MTRC, did not vote).

It was later decided that the merging of the corporations&#x27; two rail networks would take place on 2 December 2007. Since then the KCRC has become a holding company. Under the service concession, the MTRC pays the KCRC a fixed annual sum of HK$750 million, and from the fourth year after merger of the two networks, a sliding percentage scale share of annual revenue above HK$2.5 billion earned from the KCRC network.

As part of the merger, the KCR East Rail, KCR West Rail and KCR Ma On Shan Rail were renamed East Rail line, West Rail line and Ma On Shan line, respectively; the latter two lines were eventually merged into the Tuen Ma line in 2021. The KCR Light Rail is now known simply as the Light Rail. Mong Kok station on the East Rail was renamed Mong Kok East.

On 2 August 2007, Chief Executive Donald Tsang announced that, considering the technical requirements, passenger forecast, Hong Kong&#x27;s future economic development and the closer trade ties between Hong Kong and Guangdong, the new Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link would adopt the dedicated-corridor option after the 10th Plenary of the Hong Kong/Guangdong Co-operation Joint Conference. The Kowloon–Canton Railway Corporation had submitted a detailed project proposal to the government. However, the project was instead built by the MTRC.

In 2017, the Hong Kong Government announced that Guangzhou–Shenzhen–Hong Kong Express Rail Link would be leased to KCRC, and MTR would operate the railway under the rail merger service concession agreement.

==Fares and tickets==

There were two different fare classes on the KCR: Adult and Concessionary. Only children between the ages of 3 and 12, and senior citizens 65 years or over qualified for the concessionary rate. Like the MTR, the KCR did not provide a concessionary fare for students, although there was a student discount system available for students who lived in Tuen Mun, Yuen Long and Tin Shui Wai. Fares on the East Rail, Ma On Shan Rail, West Rail and the Light Rail (Octopus fare system only) were based on the distance between the start and end points of the journey. The Light Rail implemented a zone-based fare system for single journey tickets; there are six zones in total.

The fare for first-class service on the East Rail was double that of normal fares. Fares to Lo Wu were substantially higher than fares to the station just before, Sheung Shui, because of a tariff imposed on those travelling across the border to mainland China.

There are two payment methods:
* Octopus card
* Single Journey Ticket

===Octopus card===
In 1998, the MTR and KCR started using the Octopus Access Control System as the main payment method for travel on its network, replacing the Common Stored Value Tickets. Octopus cards are rechargeable, contactless smart cards, thus the value of the money is digitally stored in the card, and the amount can be automatically calculated and deducted by Octopus card readers. The system was originally proposed and introduced by the MTR. It has been extended to different services such as minibuses, franchised buses, supermarkets, and fast food restaurants. It has the potential to be further developed in other fields of services. The older, traditional magnetic ticketing system is also still in use for single journeys.

Using the Octopus card to travel on the KCR was slightly cheaper than using Single Journey Tickets. Various discount schemes on different lines, and free or discounted transfer to other modes of transport have to be done through Octopus card.

==Rolling stock==
===Locomotives===
===Passenger trains===
===Light rail===
===Feeder buses===

===Service vehicles===


===Historic===
Some of these are located at the Hong Kong Railway Museum in Tai Po, but most were scrapped when the KCR changed to modern rolling stock in the 1970s:

==Network expansion==
===Northern Link===
The Northern Link will be a rail link which connects West Rail and the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line of East Rail. The link will also serve as a connection to the boundary checkpoint into Shenzhen and Guangzhou for passengers of the western part of the New Territories. The Northern Link will start at Kam Sheung Road and end at Ta Kwu Ling. KCRC proposed to build a station at Chau Tau for interchange between this link and East Rail.

A shuttle service is expected to begin construction in 2023 and to be inaugurated in 2027.

===Sha Tin to Central Link===

On 25 June 2002, the government announced that KCRC had won its bid to build and operate the Sha Tin to Central Link. When the line is completed, the KCR network will cross Victoria Harbour and reach Hong Kong Island for the first time. Later the KCRC announced modification to the proposal, with the East Kowloon portion of the line joining Ma On Shan Line and West Rail Line, renamed to Tuen Ma line, and the cross-harbour portion joining East Rail Line at Hung Hom. However, the proposal has not been approved by the government yet.

On 11 April 2006, the government has signed a non-binding memorandum of understanding with MTRC and KCRC on merging the two railway companies.

According to the non-binding memorandum of understanding signed with the government, the current MTR lines may fully integrate the interchange stations with the Sha Tin to Central Link in order to bring more convenience to the passengers. Also, the government will conduct further studies on the proposal with the MTRC along with the Kwun Tong line Extension. Construction began on 22 June 2012 and completed on 15 May 2022.

<text>The Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation (KCRC; ) is a Hong Kong wholly government-owned railway and land asset manager. It was established in 1982 under the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation Ordinance for the purposes of operating the Kowloon–Canton Railway (KCR), and to construct and operate other new railways. On 2 December 2007, the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL), another railway operator in Hong Kong, took over the operations of the KCR network under a 50-year service concession agreement, which can be extended. Under the service concession, KCRC retains ownership of the KCR network with the MTRCL making annual payments to KCRC for the right to operate the network. The KCRC&#x27;s activities are governed by the KCRC Ordinance as amended in 2007 by the Rail Merger Ordinance to enable the service concession agreement to be entered into with the MTR Corporation Limited.

The XRL Hong Kong Section and the Sha Tin to Central Link have since been injected by the Hong Kong Government into the KCRC.

==History==
From 1910 to 1982, the KCR network was operated as a department of the Hong Kong Government. The Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation was created in December 1982 after the government decided to corporatise its railway department. Until 2007, the KCRC owned and operated a network of heavy rail, light rail and feeder bus routes within Kowloon and the New Territories. It was also a land developer by utilising its property development rights atop and around railway stations and depots. In December 2007, it ceased railway operations, with its business becoming primarily that of earning revenue from being the holder of railway assets. While it continues to own the rail network, the network is operated by the MTR Corporation under a 50-year service concession, for which the MTR Corporation Limited makes annual payments to the KCRC.

=== An expanding network ===
During the electrification of the KCR in the 1970s and early 1980s, thought had been given by the government as to the future management of the railway. Before 1982, the Kowloon–Canton Railway had been run as a department of the government, and was subject to the normal civil service rules and requirements. This made it difficult to take a commercial approach to operating what was increasingly becoming a major business in investment and revenue terms. Corporatisation of public services as a means to permit government-owned public utilities to operate more along the lines of private sector business was an approach that was beginning to gather interest at the time from several governments – the US and UK governments under Reagan and Thatcher being prime movers. The object of corporatisation was to allow the public service providers to make a commercial return on their assets, thus reducing the need for investment of public funds raised predominantly from taxes, while still remaining under government control.

On 24 December 1982, the KCRC Ordinance (Cap 372) was enacted and the KCR ceased to be a government department, although it remained wholly owned by the government. Under the Ordinance a managing board, comprising 10 members appointed by the governor (Chairman, managing director and not less than 4 nor more than 8 other members), became responsible for overseeing the day-to-day operations of the Corporation. The Corporation was required to&quot; &quot;perform its functions with a view to achieving a rate of return on the assets employed in its undertaking, and in accordance with ordinary commercial criteria, is satisfactory.&quot;&quot;

The KCR expanded its operations starting in 1984. It accepted an invitation from the government to build and operate a light rail network in the north western New Territories serving the local public transport needs of the future residents of the Tuen Mun and Yuen Long new towns.

The first choice of operator for this network had not in fact been KCR, nor had the construction of a light rail network been decided when the plans for the new towns were first drawn up. Originally the focus had been on Tuen Mun, with the new town being planned from the outset with an &#x27;exclusive public transport right of way&#x27; segregated from the ordinary road network. In 1977 the government commissioned Swiss Electrowatt Engineering and Scott Wilson Kirkpatrick &amp; Partners, both as the engineering consultants for the Tuen Mun new town, to undertake the Tuen Mun Transport Study. This involved the evaluation of the respective merits and demerits of various modes of public transport to determine which would best meet the needs of the area.

The final selection came down to a choice of one of three systems – double-deck diesel powered buses, electrically powered trolley buses, and electrically powered light rail vehicles supported by diesel buses serving less densely populated areas or where steeper gradients limited the use of light rail vehicles. Diesel buses, although unquestionably more flexible in operation and requiring far lower initial capital costs, because they did not rely on fixed overhead power lines and tracks like trolley buses and light rail vehicles, were ruled out on grounds of air pollution.

Trolley buses were ruled out on grounds of capital costs, in that the purchase price of a trolley bus was twice that of a diesel bus but offered no greater passenger carrying capacity. They also offered less operational flexibility in that they required the provision of a fixed overhead power line. It was recognised, however, that a case for the use of trolley buses over diesel buses might made were the relative costs of diesel fuel versus electrical power to change.

The consultants&#x27; final report of November 1978 recommended the construction of a light rail system. The consultants argued that a light rail system offered &quot;the best technical and economic solution to the future travel needs of Tuen Mun. Such a system would, moreover, help to promote and develop the image of the new town.&quot; Light rail vehicles would offer greater passenger carrying capacity than buses, and, although initially more expensive to purchase than diesel or trolley buses, their economic life of around 50 years was far longer than that for diesel and trolley buses of around 15 years. The consultants estimated that over 30 years the light rail system would provide an 8% return on assets assuming an annual discount rate of 15% and an annual inflation rate of 7%. The study finally also recommended the extension of the light railway system to the Yuen Long new town.

The consultants proposed the use of double deck trams each carrying 247 passengers (diesel buses then in operation could each only carry about half that number). The use of single deck trams was ruled out on the grounds of capital cost because of the need to purchase a larger number of vehicles to provide the same total passenger carrying capacity for the system. It would later transpire that no light rail vehicle manufacturer could offer such double deck vehicles and none were prepared to invest in the manufacturing capacity needed to build such vehicles given the relatively small number required. Ultimately single deck vehicles had to be ordered, which although longer at 20.2 metres, can only achieve a similar maximum passenger capacity of around 238 passengers by having all but 26 passengers standing.

These recommendations came at the same time as the government was examining proposals for a mass transit system along the north of Hong Kong Island. As explained by the Secretary for Transport in the Legislative Council on 5 July 1978, the government had asked the then Mass Transit Railway Corporation (MTRC) to plan the construction of a mass transit light rail system on HK Island more or less along the alignment of Hong Kong Tramways&#x27; existing line, which had been in operation since 1904 and lacked the capacity to handle anticipated future public transport demands. If MTRC&#x27;s plan was viable, the government would exercise its option under Section 30 of Tramways Ordinance to buy out the existing tramway operation.

Section 30 of the Ordinance required the government to acquire Hong Kong Tramways&#x27; land and assets at their full market value. In exchange for the surrender of the Hong Kong Tramways&#x27; Hong Kong Island operations, the government indicated its willingness to offer the right to operate the future Tuen Mun light rail system to the company. However, in January 1983 the government announced that it had not been able to reach an agreement with the Kowloon Wharf and Godown Company (the owner of the Hong Kong Tramways). The main sticking points in the negotiations appear to have been the amount of profit that the company would have been allowed to earn from the Tuen Mun light rail network and the granting of property development rights. Also during this time, the decision had been taken to construct the MTR Island line underground as had been the case with the MTRC&#x27;s earlier Kwun Tong line.

Subsequent discussions with other possible interested parties also failed and in 1984 the government turned to the KCRC to invite it to take on the construction and operation of the light rail network.

The Light Rail Transit (LRT, known later as the KCR Light Rail and currently simply as the Light Rail) came into service in September 1988. Although the system was generally successful in meeting passenger demand, it was never a commercial success. According to the corporation&#x27;s annual reports, the system showed an annual cash-operating loss up to 2003.

The KCRC started to participate in property development and management at around the same time as constructing Light Rail. The first joint-venture property development, Pierhead Garden, located above a light rail and bus terminus in Tuen Mun, was completed in 1988. While profits generated from property and commercial services were useful to fund new railway projects, they were never regarded as essential, being generally treated as a useful windfall. The chairman of the KCRC, K Y Yeung, highlighted this in his statement made in the 2002 annual report, by pointing out that &quot;our main source or revenue has always been and will continue to be fares. The receipts from property developments are one-off in nature and are not a dependable, long-term source of revenue for the Corporation.&quot;

In 1994 the government published its Railway Development Strategy, which identified the need for a railway to serve the rapidly expanding new towns in the northwestern New Territories. In October 1998 KCR began work on the construction of an entirely new line of some 30.5 km in length, connecting the new towns of Yuen Long, Tin Shui Wai and Tuen Mun with urban Kowloon. Originally estimated to cost HK$64 billion, the government agreed to make an equity injection of HK$29 billion to assist the corporation, with the remaining funds coming either from the corporation&#x27;s own reserves or through borrowings in the open market. In return the corporation agreed to undertake property development along the line, the profits from which (then estimated to be in excess of HK$20 billion) being returned to the government.

The government also enacted an amendment to the KCR Ordinance in 1998. The purpose of the amendment was to enable the corporation to build new railway projects (other than East Rail and Light Rail) and to raise commercial loans. Also included in the amendment was the removal of the requirement on the corporation to make a return on its fixed assets. This was particularly important as it was recognised that the heavy capital investment in new railways would not enable the corporation to make a commercial return for a good number of years on what would become a far larger asset holding. The basic requirement now placed on the corporation was that. &quot;The Corporation shall conduct its business according to prudent commercial principles and shall ensure as far as possible that, taking one year with another, its revenue is at least sufficient to meet its expenditure.&quot;

The KCR West Rail (later the West Rail Line, now the Tuen Ma line on the MTR network) was finally opened on 20 December 2003. As a result of extensive value engineering exercises, the final cost of the project came in much lower than originally forecast at HK$46.6 billion.

The following year two extensions to the East Rail network were commissioned, both lines also forming part of the government&#x27;s Railway Development Strategy. In October 2004 the KCR East Rail (now the East Rail line on the MTR network) was extended from Hung Hom station to East Tsim Sha Tsui station, enabling KCR services to return to a location close to the original 1910 KCR terminus. In December 2004 Ma On Shan Rail (now the Ma On Shan line on the MTR network) was opened, linking Wu Kai Sha with East Rail at Tai Wai station. Some three years later, in August 2007, a third extension, the Lok Ma Chau Spur Line came into service. Extending from East Rail at Sheung Shui to a second cross-boundary terminal at Lok Ma Chau, the Spur Line was intended to alleviate congestion for cross-boundary travellers at the existing Lo Wu terminal and to provide a convenient connection to the Shenzhen Metro system.

In 2000, the government published its updated Railway Development Strategy. Included was a proposal by KCR to construct a 3.8 km extension to the West Rail line from Nam Cheong station to East Tsim Sha Tsui station, with the existing section of East Rail line from Hung Hom station to East Tsim Sha Tsui station being modified to become part of the extended West Rail line. Known as the Kowloon Southern Link (KSL), the extension, with a new intermediate station at Austin Road, was completed and opened for passenger services on 16 August 2009.

The financial impact of all these new projects can be seen in the declining net profits of the corporation from 2001. Despite increasing passengers, heavy interest expenses on borrowings and depreciation charges on the new assets pushed net profits down to close to zero by the end of 2007. However, if non-cash depreciation charges are excluded, which rose from about HK$700 million in 2001 to HK$2,400 million by 2007, the corporation continued to show a cash operating profit.

Of interest also is that the last fare increase made by the corporation was in 1997. Although proposals were put forward to increase fares over the subsequent 10 years to provide comfort that the corporation would be able to service its increasing debt portfolio created by the need to fund the expansion of the KCR network, these came to naught in light of economic and political pressures. The chairman and chief executive, K.Y. Yeung, most eloquently explained the &quot;catch-22&quot; situation faced by the corporation in his statement contained in the 2001 annual report.

&quot;While the Corporation has autonomy to decide fares, we face the classic dilemma of most publicly owned transport operators when it comes to raising fares. On the one hand, in the current period of economic deflation, there is considerable pressure on public transport operators not to increase fares so as to share the burden of the community. On the other hand, when inflation returns, there will be equal pressure on operators to keep any fare increases below the rate of inflation so as not to fuel inflation.&quot;

&quot;The longer term implications of this dilemma for the Corporation are obvious. A way has to be found out of this situation if we are to fund new projects. We must try to devise a consistent policy in respect of fare increases which will allow us to demonstrate to investors that we can generate the necessary stable revenue stream in the medium to long term and which, at the same time, will also allow us to demonstrate to our passengers that our fares will remain competitive with those of alternative modes of public transport.&quot;

Of critical concern to the corporation was the gradual erosion of its cross-boundary market, where for many years it had enjoyed the majority share and was able charge a fare premium. The corporation faced increasing competition from road transport operators, mainly coach operators, following the opening of a number of major crossing points providing convenient road access to Shenzhen and southern China. Profits from this segment of the corporation&#x27;s transport operations were considered vital to subsidise its domestic services which in general operated at a loss.

===Ceased to be a public transport operator===
During the construction of the KSL, KCRC ceased to be a public transport operator. The government&#x27;s Railway Development Strategy 2000 proposed the construction of a new line to link up the northeastern New Territories and the central business area of Hong Kong Island, to be called the Sha Tin to Central Link (SCL). Competitive proposals were invited from both KCRC and the MTR Corporation Limited (MTRCL) to design, build and operate the new line. On 25 June 2002 the government announced that KCRC had won the bid. In the same announcement the government said that, as a separate issue, the chief executive in Council had also instructed the Administration to consider the feasibility of merging the MTRCL and the KCRC into a single rail company.

Following five years of negotiations and the enactment of the Rail Merger Ordinance after its passage through the Legislative Council, the KCRC ceased to be a public transport operator on 2 December 2007, becoming thereafter primarily simply the holder of railway assets. Instead of being the operator of those assets, KCRC granted MTRCL the right to operate KCRC&#x27;s rail and feeder bus network under a service concession agreement for an initial period of 50 years, which may be extended. In return MTRCL was required to make an upfront payment to KCRC of HK$4.25 billion for the service concession and certain short-lived railway assets of KCRC such as stores and spares, and thereafter a fixed annual payment of HK$750 million and, commencing 36 months after the date of the merger (i.e. 2 December 2010), an additional variable annual payment calculated according to a pre-agreed set of sharing ratios as follows –
* 10% for gross revenue earned by MTRCL from the KCRC railway assets exceeding HK$2.5 billion and up to HK$5 billion for the year;
* 15% for gross revenue between HK$5 billion and HK$7.5 billion for the year; and
* 35% for gross revenue beyond HK$7.5 billion for the year.
MTRCL also paid KCRC HK$7.79 billion on the merger for the acquisition of property and other related commercial interests.

KCRC and MTRCL remain as separate entities. KCRC employs a small number of management staff answerable to its Managing Board, with specialist legal, financial and other support being provided through outsourcing and consultancy arrangements. The Corporation&#x27;s key responsibilities include overseeing and fulfilling its obligations with respect to its service concession with the MTRCL, raising new financing as needed to service its debts (over HK$10 billion was raised in 2009), ensuring compliance with its obligations under a number of cross-border leases covering its rolling stock and other assets, and being the majority shareholder for West Rail Property Development Limited, which is responsible for the development of some 13 residential property sites along West Rail. In addition to the revenue earned from the concession payments made by the MTRCL, it earns rental revenue from leasing out four floors of Citylink Plaza above Sha Tin station. KCRC also retains a 22.1% shareholding in Octopus Holdings Limited (OHL), which was first established in 2005 and is owned by the major public transport operators in Hong Kong. OHL is the holding company of Octopus Cards Limited, which is a world leader in smart card payment systems used not only for making public transport journeys within Hong Kong but also for making small purchases in supermarkets and other convenience stores.

KCRC also remained responsible for funding the full construction costs of the KSL, which was under construction at the time of the merger, with the MTRCL paid a fee for project managing the works. KCRC also funded the purchase of 22 additional light rail vehicles needed to accommodate the increase in patronage expected on light rail feeder routes to West Rail stations as a result of the opening of the KSL. MTRCL assumed responsibility for operating the KSL and the new light rail vehicles under the service concession.

Although the corporation&#x27;s annual revenues saw a sharp decline from over HK$5.5 billion before the merger to less than HK$1 billion immediately after the merger, its operating costs similarly declined. The corporation was also fortunate in being able to refinance a substantial portion of its large debt portfolio during the low interest environment that prevailed during 2009 and 2010. This reduced the corporation&#x27;s interest costs by more than half because the effective interest rate on its debt fell from above 7% to around 3%. Excluding non-cash depreciation charges, the corporation enjoys a cash operating profit, which should continue to increase over time as reflected in MTRCL&#x27;s variable annual payments. The variable annual payment for 2010 was HK$45 million, covering the period from 2 to 31 December 2010 only. For the first full year of 2011 the variable annual payment was HK$647 million. By 2013 the annual variable payment had increased to HK$1,247 million. With the HK$750 million fixed annual payment, the total cash payment made by MTRCL under the Service Concession for 2013 was HK$1.997 billion.

==Plans==
After the announcement in June 2002 that KCRC had won the bid to design, build and operate the SCL, the corporation proceeded with detailed planning for the project. In 2005, however, work was suspended pending an announcement by the Government of its decision on how and by whom the SCL would in fact be constructed. By this time KCRC had incurred some HK$1.188 billion in costs on the project.

Following the rail merger, the government took over responsibility for the project. According to the government&#x27;s latest plan as explained to the Legislative Council in March 2008, the cost of building the SCL will be borne by the government, with MTRCL given responsibility for managing the design and construction of the line. The government has indicated that it may vest the completed line in, or lease the line to, KCRC, which would then grant an additional service concession to the MTRCL to operate the line. KCRC has indicated that such an arrangement would enable recovery of the corporation&#x27;s earlier costs on the project.

== Executive management ==
The following table lists year with chairmen, managing directors, CEOs and chief officers since corporatisation.

==Corporate governance==
From corporatisation in December 1982 until the rail merger 25 years later, corporate governance issues periodically troubled the corporation. Reflecting this were the changes that took place in the relationship between the chairman of the managing board and the head of the executive management team.

Initially the root causes of this were the commercial and political tensions arising from the change from a government department to an organisation expected to operate in a prudent commercial manner so as to make a return on its fixed assets. While expected to make a profit to comply with its mandate under the KCRC Ordinance, because the corporation remained 100% government owned, it faced at the same time strong public and political pressure not to increase fares. These difficulties were further complicated by corporate governance issues involving senior management and members of the corporation&#x27;s managing board.

At corporatisation the positions of (non-executive) chairman of the managing board and that of the (executive) managing director were separate, with the managing director answerable to the board for the day-to-day business of the corporation. D M (Bobby) Howes, the previous general manager of KCR remained for a few months until his successor, Peter Quick, took up the post. Unlike Howes, who was a traditional railway man, Quick came from a commercial background, and from the outset, adopted a strong commercial approach to the operation of the railway. His efforts were reflected in the gradually increasing profitability of the corporation.

However, as a result of public controversy in late 1988 over claimed &quot;golden handshakes&quot; paid to two senior executives as a result of termination of their services, and in 1989 a fare increase with the corporation already enjoying a significant profit, the government took the decision that both the chairman and the managing director should leave upon expiry of their period of office.

At the end of 1990, with the appointment of Kevin Hyde, a Lawyer and the former chief executive of New Zealand Railways Corporation, the two formerly separate positions were combined into the single position of chairman and chief executive. During his tenure, Hyde oversaw unprecedented growth in the business as well as spearheading a number of significant commercial and engineering projects, including the West Rail Project. Hyde forged new and productive working relationships with the KCRC&#x27;s Mainland counterparts and Ministry Officials leading to a number of co-operative projects on both sides of the border. He also introduced a &#x27;post-colonial&#x27; ethos within the business, actively developing and promoting local executives and expertise. Hyde left in 1996 having decided that it was important that the business entered the 1997 handover with a local person in the position of chairman and chief executive.

He was replaced by K Y Yeung, a former senior civil servant with the Hong Kong government. While the KCRC continued to prosper financially, K Y Yeung&#x27;s style of management, founded as it was in his civil service background, did not sit well with some.

In December 2001, the government enacted an amendment to the KCRC Ordinance to provide for the separation of the functions and duties of the chairman from those of the chief executive by creating the office of chief executive officer (CEO), who also became a member of the managing board. The government argued that, with the then planned expansion of the railway network, there was a growing need to separate the strategic planning functions and day-to-day management responsibilities of KCRC. Enacting legislation to separate the functions and duties of the chairman and the CEO was intended to put in place an effective governance structure to ensure transparency, accountability and responsibility. By strengthening the independence of the KCRC board and providing clear lines of reporting, there would be improved checks and balances over senior management.

Unfortunately, as set out in a paper by the legal adviser to Hong Kong&#x27;s Legislative Council, the amendments did not spell out in detail the duties and functions of the chairman and the CEO, or at least their responsibilities. The government argued that this would not be appropriate as it was important for KCRC, which operated along prudent commercial principles, to retain the flexibility to determine and fine-tune the relationship between the managing board (led by the chairman) and the executives (led by the CEO) to suit its operational needs and the prevailing corporate practices which change over time. This deliberate lack of clarity arguably sowed the seed for a future controversy.

Michael Tien, a businessman, was subsequently appointed as the chairman, with the former chairman and chief executive, K Y Yeung, stepping down to become the CEO. It rapidly became publicly evident, however, that there was personal tension between the two, exemplified by Michael Tien&#x27;s denial that he was a good friend of K Y Yeung when the two briefed the media in 2002 on the findings of the investigation into the Siemens incident. (The investigation dealt with the payment of an additional HK$100 million to Siemens under a supplementary agreement to the telecommunications contract for the West Rail project, and the interaction between the managing board and the executive management team.)

The situation did not improve with K Y Yeung&#x27;s departure at the end of 2003, following the opening of West Rail. At the heart of the problem was the lack of clarity in the respective roles and responsibilities of the chairman and the CEO. On 9 March 2006, with the signed support of all 5 operations directors and 19 managers, the Acting chief executive officer, Samuel Lai, wrote to the Managing Board to complain about the leadership style of the chairman. Around 80% of the staff signed in support of Lai. In Lai&#x27;s letter he stated that little had changed since 2001, and that the necessary distinctions between the different but complementary roles of the executive and non-executive functions frequently became blurred, with the chairman interfering in how day-today matters should be handled.

On the following day, Michael Tien met the Chief Executive of Hong Kong, Donald Tsang. In the afternoon of 12 March 2006, Tien announced his resignation, with the effective date to be determined by Tsang. After further negotiation, Tien withdrew his resignation. The KCRC managing board convened a meeting on 14 March 2006 and decided on a set of measures to more clearly delineate the work of the chairman and CEO.

While the board meeting was being held, 20 of the corporation&#x27;s senior executives met the media in a room next to where the board meeting was being held. The managing board considered this to be a very serious matter, and that the incident had caused serious damage to the reputation and image of the corporation. A further meeting of the board was held the next day on 15 March 2006. The board decided to terminate the employment contract of one of the 20 senior executives and to issue warning letters to the remaining 19. At the meeting Lai resigned. The reason given in the government&#x27;s paper to the Legislative Council&#x27;s Panel on Transport was because Lai, being the CEO, felt that he should be held responsible for the acts of his staff. Lai, in the personal account given in his book published in 2007 (九天風雲 (English title: The Longest Week)), explained that the original decision of the board had been to sack all 20 senior executives, but by his offering to resign, the board had agreed to dismiss only the senior executive who had acted as the spokesman for the 20 on 14 March.

A civil engineer, James Blake, the former Secretary for Works in the Hong Kong Government and afterwards the Senior Director Projects of the corporation until the end of 2003, took over as the chief executive officer (not acting) at age 71. The incident was seen to have sped up the government&#x27;s plan to merge the operations of Hong Kong&#x27;s two railway networks. Lai in his book states that at the board meeting held on 15 March 2006, the first item on the agenda was the appointment of Blake as the deputy CEO responsible for the proposed rail merger, which was raised by the then Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury on behalf of the government as the sole shareholder of the corporation. The appointment was unanimously approved. With Lai&#x27;s resignation, the board had then decided to invite Blake to become the CEO. Lai agreed to stay with the corporation for a while longer to ensure a smooth handover to Blake.

Thereafter matters moved fairly swiftly on the merger, resulting in the corporation finally ceasing to be the operator of its railway assets on 2 December 2007.

Until the rail merger, the KCRC Ordinance had required that the corporation appoint a CEO. As part of the Rail Merger Ordinance an amendment was made to the KCRC Ordinance to provide for the post of the CEO to be left vacant should the corporation so decide. On the merger the decision was taken not to fill the post and instead Mr. James Blake, the former CEO, was appointed as the Chief Officer to head the small management team. The composition of the managing board also changed, the number of members being reduced from 10 (of whom only two were government officials) to six (all of whom are government officials), with the chairman of the board being the Secretary for Financial Services and the Treasury.

<doc id="268821" wikidata="Q7308497" url="?curid=268821" title="Regina Manifesto">
<text>The Regina Manifesto was the programme of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF) and was adopted at the first national convention of the CCF held in Regina, Saskatchewan, in 1933. The goal of the Regina Manifesto was to eradicate the system of capitalism and replace it with a planned socialist economy. The CCF was a Canadian democratic socialist party founded in 1932 by farmers, workers, and socialist groups against the backdrop of the Great Depression.

The manifesto was largely written by members of the League for Social Reconstruction, particularly Frank Underhill and F. R. Scott, and called for &quot;a planned and socialized economy in which our natural resources and principal means of production and distribution are owned, controlled and operated by the people.&quot; Specifically it called for the nationalization of transportation, communications, electrical power and other services. It called for a planned economy and a national banking system that would be &quot;removed from the control of private profit-seeking interests.&quot; It advocated the ability to organize in trade unions and called for a National Labour Code &quot;to secure for the worker maximum income and leisure, insurance covering illness, accident, old age, and unemployment&quot;. The Regina Manifesto proposed social service programs such as publicly funded health care, supported peace, promoted co-operative enterprises, and vowed that &quot;No C.C.F. Government will rest content until it has eradicated capitalism and put into operation the full programme of socialized planning which will lead to the establishment in Canada of the Cooperative Commonwealth.&quot;

The Regina Manifesto remained the CCF&#x27;s official programme until 1956 when, in the face of the strong anti-communist sentiment of the Cold War, it was replaced by the more moderate Winnipeg Declaration which substituted Keynesian economics for socialist remedies.

<text>Kiowa ( ) or Cáuigú () people are a Native American tribe and an Indigenous people of the Great Plains of the United States. They migrated southward from western Montana into the Rocky Mountains in Colorado in the 17th and 18th centuries, and eventually into the Southern Plains by the early 19th century. In 1867, the Kiowa were moved to a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma.

Today, they are federally recognized as Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma with headquarters in Carnegie, Oklahoma. , there were 12,000 members.

The Kiowa language (Cáuijògà), part of the Tanoan language family, is in danger of extinction, with only 20 speakers as of 2012. the Kiowa have a Kiowa Language Department. The University of Tulsa, the University of Oklahoma in Norman, and the University of Science and Arts of Oklahoma in Chickasha offer Kiowa language classes.

==Name==

In the Kiowa language, Kiowa call themselves [kɔ́j–gʷú], spelled variously as Cáuigú, Ka&#x27;igwu, Gáuigú, or Gaigwu, most given with the speculated meaning &quot;Principal People.&quot; 
In the early 18th century, the Plains Apache lived around the upper Missouri River and maintained close connections to the Kiowa. They were ethnically different and spoke different languages.
The first part of the name is the element [kɔ́j] (spelled Kae-, Cáui-, Gáui-, or Gai-) which simply means &#x27;Kiowa&#x27;. Its origin is lost. The second element &quot;-gua/gú&quot; [–gʷú] (or [–gʷúɔ̯] in older Kiowa) is a plural marker.

Ancient names of the tribe were Kútjàu or Kwu-da [kʰʷút–tɔ̀] (&quot;emerging&quot; or &quot;coming out rapidly&quot;) and Tep-da [tʰép+dɔ̀ː], relating to the tribal origin narrative of a creator pulling people out of a hollow log until a pregnant woman got stuck. Later, they called themselves &quot;Kom-pa-bianta&quot; (Kòmfàubî̱dàu) [kòmpɔ̀+bį̂ː–dɔ̀] (tipi flap+big–plural) for &quot;people with large tipi flaps&quot;, before they met Southern Plains tribes or before they met white men.

In English, &quot;Kiowa&quot; is pronounced /ˈkaɪ.oʊ.wə/, KI-o-wə /ˈki.oʊ.wə/ is considered improper. The English name derives from how the Comanches would say /kɔ́j–gʷú/ in their language. Some older Kiowas will say &quot;Kiowa&quot; as KI-wah /ˈkaɪ.wɑː/.

In Plains Indian Sign Language, &quot;Kiowa&quot; is expressed by holding two straight fingers near the lower outside edge of the right eye and moving these fingers back past the ear. This corresponded to the ancient Kiowa hairstyle cut horizontally from the lower outside edge of the eyes to the back of their ears. This was a practical way to prevent their hair from getting tangled while shooting an arrow from a bowstring. George Catlin painted Kiowa warriors with this hairstyle.

==Language==

The Kiowa language is a member of the Kiowa-Tanoan language family. The relationship was first proposed by Smithsonian linguist John P. Harrington in 1910 and was definitively established by Ken Hale in 1967. Parker McKenzie, born in 1897, was a noted authority on the Kiowa language, learning English only when he began school. He collaborated with John P. Harrington, who credited him as the first author of jointly published work at a time when Native consultants were seldom acknowledged. Later, he also worked with Laurel Watkins on the Kiowa language. He went on to discuss the etymology of words and insights into how the Kiowa language changed to incorporate new items of material culture. McKenzie&#x27;s letters on pronunciation and grammar of the Kiowa language are in the National Anthropological Archives.

Kiowa /ˈkaɪ.əwə/ or Cáuijṑ̱gà / [Gáui[dò̱:gyà (&quot;language of the Cáuigù (Kiowa)&quot;) is a Tanoan language spoken by Kiowa people, primarily in Caddo, Kiowa, and Comanche counties.

Additionally, Kiowa were one of the numerous nations across the U.S., Canada, and Mexico that spoke Plains Sign Talk. Originally a trade language, it became a language in its own right that remained in use across North America.

==Government==

The Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma is headquartered in Carnegie, Oklahoma. Their tribal jurisdictional area includes Caddo, Comanche, Cotton, Jackson, Kiowa, Tillman, Greer and Harmon Counties. Enrollment in the tribe requires a minimum blood quantum of ¼ Kiowa descent.

, the Kiowa Tribal Chairman is Lawrence SpottedBird, and the Vice-Chairman is Jacob Tsotigh.

==Economic development==
The Kiowa tribe issues its own vehicle tags. , the tribe owns one smoke shop, the Morningstar Steakhouse and Grill, Morningstar Buffet, The Winner&#x27;s Circle restaurant in Devol, Oklahoma, and Kiowa Bingo near Carnegie, Oklahoma.

The tribe owns three casinos, the Kiowa Casino in Carnegie, in Verden, and the Kiowa Casino and Hotel Red River in Devol (approximately 20 minutes north of Wichita Falls, Texas).

== Culture ==
Originally from the Northern Plains and migrating to the Southern Plains, Kiowa society follows bilateral descent, where both maternal and paternal lines are significant. They do not have clans but have a complex kinship-based system and societies based on age and gender.

Tipis, conical lodges made from hide or later canvas, provided lightweight, portable housing. They hunted and gathered wild foods and traded with neighboring agrarian tribes for produce. The Kiowa migrated seasonally with the American bison because it was their main food source. They also hunted antelope, deer, turkeys, and other wild game. Women collected varieties of wild berries and fruit and processed them with prepared meats to make pemmican. Dogs were used to pull travois and rawhide parfleche that contained camping goods for short moves. The Kiowa tended to stay in areas for long periods of time.

When they adopted horse culture after acquiring horses from Spanish rancherias south of the Rio Grande, the Kiowa revolutionized their lifeways. They had much larger ranges for their seasonal hunting, and horses could carry some of their camping goods. The Kiowa and Plains Apache established a homeland in the Southern Plains, adjacent to the Arkansas River in southeastern Colorado and western Kansas and the Red River drainage of the Texas Panhandle and western Oklahoma.

The Kiowa use &quot;Plantago virginica&quot; to make garlands or wreaths for old men to wear around their heads during ceremonial dances as a symbol of health.

=== Cuisine ===

The Kiowa historically had a nomadic hunter-gatherer society. They shared a similar cuisine with their neighboring Plains tribes, such as the Comanche. The most important food source for the Kiowa and fellow plains nations was the American bison or buffalo. Before the introduction of horses, the Plains tribes hunted bison on foot. Hunting required the hunter to get as close as possible to the target before shooting with arrows or using the long lance. Occasionally, they wore the skins of wolves or coyotes to hide their approach toward the bison herds.

Hunting bison became far easier after the Kiowa acquired horses. Bison were hunted on horseback and the men used bows and arrows to take them down, as well as long lances to pierce the hearts of the animals. The women prepared bison meat in a variety of ways: roasted, boiled, and dried. Dried meat was prepared into pemmican, for sustenance while the people were on the move. Pemmican is made by grinding dried lean meat into powder, then mixing a near-equal weight of melted fat or tallow and sometimes berries. The pemmican was shaped into bars and kept in pouches until ready to eat. The Kiowa sometimes ate certain parts of the bison raw. Other animals hunted included deer, elk, pronghorn, wild mustang, wild turkey, and bears. During times of scarce game, the Kiowa would eat small animals such as lizards, waterfowl, skunks, snakes, and armadillos. They raided ranches for Longhorn cattle and horses to eat during difficult times. They also acquired horses for traveling, hunting, and fighting their enemies.

Within Kiowa society, men did most of the hunting. Women were responsible for gathering wild edibles such as berries, tubers, seeds, nuts, vegetables, and wild fruit but could choose to hunt if they wanted to. Plants important to Kiowa cuisine include pecans, prickly pear, mulberries, persimmons, acorns, plums, and wild onions. They acquired cultivated crops, such as squash, maize, and pumpkin, by trading with and raiding various Indian peoples, such as the Pawnee people, living on the western edge of the great plains. Prior to acquiring metal pots from Europeans, Kiowa cooked boiled meat and vegetables through a process of lining a pit in the earth with animal hides, filling that with water, and adding fire-heated rocks.

===Transportation and dwellings===
The main form of shelter used by the Kiowa was the tipi or skin lodge. Tipis were made from bison hides shaped and sewn together in a conical shape. Wooden poles called lodge poles from in length are used as support for the lodge. Lodge poles are harvested from red juniper and lodgepole pine. Tipis have at least one entrance flap. Smoke flaps were placed at the top so that smoke could escape from the fire pit within. The floor of the tipi was lined with animal pelts and skins for warmth and comfort. The tipi is designed to be warm inside during the cold winter months and cool inside during the warm summer. Tipis are easily collapsed and can be raised in minutes, making it an optimal structure for nomadic people like the Kiowa and other Plains Indian nations. The poles of the tipi were used to construct a travois during times of travel. Hide paintings often adorn the outside and inside of the tipis, with special meanings attached to certain designs.

Before the introduction of the horse to North America, the Kiowa and other plains peoples used domestic dogs to carry and pull their belongings. Tipis and belongings, as well as small children, were carried on travois, a frame structure using the tipi poles and pulled by dogs and later horses.

The introduction of the horse to Kiowa society revolutionized their way of life. They acquired horses by raiding rancheros south of the Rio Grande into Mexico, as well as by raiding other Indian peoples who already had horses, such as the Navajo and the various Pueblo people. With the horse, they could transport larger loads, hunt more game over a wider range and more easily, and travel longer and farther. The Kiowa became powerful and skilled mounted warriors who conducted long-distance raids against enemies. The Kiowa were considered among the finest horsemen on the Plains. A man&#x27;s wealth was measured primarily by the size of his horse herd, with particularly wealthy individuals having herds numbering in the hundreds. Horses were targets of capture during raids. The Kiowa considered it an honor to steal horses from enemies, and such raids often served as a rite of passage for young warriors. They adorned their horses with body paint from the medicine man for ritual and spiritual purposes, such as good fortune and protection during battle. Kiowa horses were also often decorated with beaded masks (sometimes with bison horns attached to the sides) and feathers in their manes. Mules and donkeys were also used as means of transportation and wealth; however, they were not as esteemed.

=== Sociopolitical organization ===
The Kiowa had a well structured tribal government like most tribes on the Northern Plains. They had a yearly Sun Dance gathering and an elected head-chief who was considered to be a symbolic leader of the entire nation. Warrior societies and religious societies were important to Kiowa society and carried out specific roles. Chiefs were chosen based on bravery and courage shown in battle as well as intelligence, generosity, experience, communication skills, and kindness to others. The Kiowa believed that the young fearless warrior was ideal. The entire tribe was structured around this individual. The warrior was the ideal to which young men aspired. Because of these factors, the Kiowa was of utmost importance in the history of the Southern Plains.

The women gain prestige through the achievements of their husbands, sons, and fathers, or through their own achievements in the arts. Kiowa women tanned, skin-sewed, painted geometric designs on parfleche and later beaded and quilled hides. The Kiowa women took care of the camp while the men were away. They gathered and prepared food for winter months, and participated in key ritual events. Kiowa men lived in the families of their wives&#x27; extended families. Local groups (&quot;jōfàujōgáu&quot; or &quot;jōdáu&quot;) were led by the &quot;jōfàujōqì&quot;, which merged to become a band (&quot;topadoga&quot;). These bands were led by a chief, the &quot;Topadok&#x27;i&quot; (&#x27;main chief&#x27;).

The Kiowa had two political subdivisions (particularly with regard to their relationship with the Comanche):
*To-kinah-yup or Thóqàhyòp /Thóqàhyòi (&quot;Northerners&quot;, lit. &#x27;Men of the Cold&#x27; or &#x27;Cold People&#x27;, &#x27;northern Kiowa&#x27;, lived along the Arkansas River and the Kansas border, comprising the more numerous northern bands)
*Sálqáhyóp or Sálqáhyói (&quot;Southerners&quot;, lit. &#x27;Hot People&#x27;, &#x27;southern Kiowa&#x27;, lived in the Llano Estacado (Staked Plains), Oklahoma Panhandle and Texas Panhandle, allies of the Comanche).

As the pressure on Kiowa lands increased in the 1850s, the regional divisions changed. A new regional grouping emerged:
* the Gwa-kelega or Gúhàlēcáuigú (&#x27;Wild Mustang Kiowa&#x27; or &#x27;Gúhàlē Kiowa&#x27;, they were named for the large mustang herds in the territory of the &quot;Kwahadi (Quohada) Band&quot; of the Comanche, this Comanche Band was known to them as &quot;Gúhàlēgáu&quot; – &#x27;Wild Mustang People&#x27;, with which they were living in close proximity during the last resistance to white settlement on the Southern Plains).

After the death of the high chief Dohäsan in 1866, the Kiowa split politically into a peace faction and a war faction. War-bands and peace-bands developed primarily based on their proximity to Fort Sill (&quot;Xóqáudáuhága&quot; – &#x27;At Medicine Bluff&#x27;, lit. &#x27;Rock Cliff Medicine At Soldiers Collective They Are&#x27;) and their degree of interaction.

Kiowa bands within the tipi ring during the annual Sun Dance (called &quot;Kc-to&quot;):
*Kâtá or Qáutjáu (&#x27;Biters&#x27;, lit. &quot;Arikara&quot;, because they had a strong trading history with the Arikara people and some families have had Arikara kin; this is the most powerful and largest Kiowa band)
*Kogui or Qógûi (&#x27;Elks Band&#x27;)
*Kaigwa or Cáuigú (&#x27;Kiowa Proper&#x27;)
*Kinep / Kí̱bi̱dau / Kíbìdàu (&#x27;Big Shields&#x27;) or Khe-ate / Kí̱ːet / Kíèt (&#x27;Big Shield&#x27;), also known as Káugyabî̱dau / Kāugàbîdāu (&#x27;Big Hides / Robes&#x27;)
*Semat / Sémhát (&#x27;Stealers&#x27; or &#x27;Thieves&#x27;, Kiowa name for their allies, the Kiowa Apache, during the Sun Dance also called Taugûi – &#x27;Sitting (at the) Outside&#x27;)
*Soy-hay-talpupé / Sáuhédau-talyóp (&#x27;Blue Boys&#x27;) or Pahy-dome-gaw / Pái-dome-gú (&#x27;Under-the-Sun-Men&#x27;) (smallest Kiowa band)

During the Sun Dance, some bands had special obligations. These were traditionally defined as follows:

The &quot;Kâtá&quot; had the traditional right (duty or task) to supply the Kiowa during the Sun Dance with enough bison meat and other foods. This band was particularly wealthy in horses, tipis and other goods. The famous Principal Kiowa chiefs Dohäsan (Little Mountain) and Guipago (Lone Wolf) were members of this band.

The &quot;Kogui&quot; were responsible for conducting the war ceremonies during the Sun Dance. There were numerous famous families and leaders known for their military exploits and bravery, such as Ad-da-te (&quot;Islandman&quot;), Satanta (White Bear), and Kicking Bird, and the war chiefs Big Bow (Zepko-ete) and Stumbling Bear (Set-imkia).

The &quot;Kaigwu&quot; were the guardians of the Sacred or Medicine bundle (Tai-mé, Taimay) and the holy lance. Therefore, they were respected and enjoyed a special prestige.

The &quot;Kinep&quot; or &quot;Khe-ate&quot; were often called &quot;Sun Dance Shields&quot;, because during the dance, they observed police duties and ensured security. The chief Woman&#x27;s Heart (Manyi-ten) belonged to this band.

The &quot;Semat&quot; were allowed to participate equally, but had no specific duties and obligations during the Sun Dance.

===Enemies and warrior culture===
Typical of the Plains Indians during the horse culture era, the Kiowa were a warrior people. They fought frequently with enemies, both neighboring and far beyond their territory. The Kiowa were notable for their long-distance raids extending south into Mexico and north onto the Northern Plains. Almost all warfare took place on horseback. The Kiowa&quot;s enemies included the Cheyenne, Arapaho, Navajo, Ute, and occasionally the Lakota to the north and west of Kiowa territory. East of Kiowa territory, they fought with the Pawnee, Osage, Kickapoo, Kaw, Caddo, Wichita, and Sac and Fox. To the south, they fought with the Lipan Apache, Mescalero Apache, Chiricahua Apache (whom the Kiowa called the Do’-ko’nsenä’go, &quot;People of the turned-up moccasins&quot;), and Tonkawa. The Kiowa also clashed with American Indian nations from the Southeastern and Northeastern Woodlands who were forcibly removed to Indian Territory during the Indian Removal period, including the Cherokee, Choctaw, Muskogee, and Chickasaw.

The Cheyenne and Arapaho later made peace with the Kiowa. Together, they formed a powerful alliance with the Comanche and the Plains Apache to fight invading white settlers and U.S. soldiers, as well as Mexicans and the Mexican Army.
Like other Plains Indians, the Kiowa had specific warrior societies. Young men who proved their bravery, skill, or displayed their worth in battle were often invited to one of the warrior societies. In addition to warfare, the societies worked to keep peace within the camps and tribe as a whole. There were six warrior societies among the Kiowa. The Po-Lanh-Yope (Little Rabbits) was for boys; all young Kiowa boys were enrolled. The group mostly served social and education purposes, involving no violence or combat. The Adle-Tdow-Yope (Young Sheep), Tsain-Tanmo (Horse Headdresses), Tdien-Pei-Gah (Gourd Society), and Ton-Kon-Gah (Black Legs or Leggings) were adult warrior societies. The Koitsenko (Qkoie-Tsain-Gah, Principal Dogs or Real Dogs) consisted of the ten most elite warriors of all the Kiowa who were elected by the members of the other four adult warrior societies.

Kiowa warriors used a combination of traditional and nontraditional weapons, including long lances, bows and arrows, tomahawks, knives, and war clubs, as well as the later acquired rifles, shotguns, revolvers, and cavalry swords. Shields were made from tough bison hide stretched over a wooden frame, or they were made from the skull of bison, which made a small, strong shield. Shields and weapons were adorned with feathers, furs, and animal parts, such as eagle claws for ceremonial purposes. 

===Kiowa calendars===

The Kiowa people told ethnologist James Mooney that the first calendar keeper in their tribe was Little Bluff, or &quot;Tohausan&quot;, who was the principal chief of the tribe from 1833 to 1866. Mooney also worked with two other calendar keepers, &quot;Settan (&quot;Little Bear) and &quot;Ankopaaingyadete&quot; (In the Middle of Many Tracks), commonly known as &quot;Anko&quot;. Other Plains tribes kept pictorial records, known as &quot;winter counts&quot;.

The Kiowa calendar system is unique: they recorded two events each year, offering a finer-grained record and twice as many entries for any given period. Silver Horn (1860–1940), or &quot;Haungooah,&quot; was the most highly esteemed artist of the Kiowa tribe in the 19th and 20th centuries. He kept a calendar and was a respected religious leader in his later years.

=== Funeral practices ===
In Kiowa tradition, death had strong associations with dark spirits and negative forces, which meant that the death of an individual was seen as a traumatic experience. Fear of ghosts in Kiowa communities stemmed from the belief that spirits commonly resisted the end of their physical life. The spirits were thought to remain around the corpse or its burial place, as well as haunt former living spaces and possessions. Lingering spirits were also believed to help encourage the dying to cross from the physical world to the afterlife. The fear of ghosts can be seen in the way skulls were treated, which was believed to be a source of negative spiritual contamination that invited danger to the living. Due to the fears and risks associated with death, the community&#x27;s reactions were instantaneous and vicious. Families and relatives were expected to demonstrate grief through reactions such as wailing, ripping off clothes and shaving of the head. There have also been accounts of self-induced body lacerations and finger joints being cut. In the process of grief, women and the widowed spouse were expected to be more expressive in their mourning.

The body of the deceased must be washed before burial. The washer, historically a woman, also combs the hair and paints the face of the dead. Once the body has been treated, a burial occurs promptly. When possible, the burial takes place on the same day, unless the death occurs at night. In this case the dead is buried the following morning. A quick burial was believed to reduce the risk of spirits remaining around the burial site. After the burial, most of the belongings of the dead were burned along with their tipi. If their tipi or house was shared with family, the surviving relatives moved into a new house.

==History==

As members of the Kiowa-Tanoan language family, the Kiowa at some distant time likely shared an ethnic origin with the other Amerindian nations of this small language family: Tiwa, Tewa, Towa, and others. By historic times, however, the Kiowa lived in a hunter-gatherer economy unlike the sedentary &quot;pueblo&quot; societies of the others. The Kiowa also had a complex ceremonial life and developed the &#x27;Winter counts&#x27; as calendars. The Kiowa recount their origins as near the Missouri River, and the Black Hills. They knew that they were driven south by pressure from the Sioux.
For the earliest recorded — and recounted — history of the Kiowa, see further below.


Following A&#x27;date, famous Kiowa leaders were Dohäsan (Tauhawsin, Over-Hanging Butte, alias Little Mountain, alias Little Bluff); Satank (Set-ankea, Sitting Bear), Guipago (Gui-pah-gho, Lone Wolf The Elder, alias Guibayhawgu, Rescued From Wolves), Satanta (Set-tainte, White Bear), Tene-angopte (Kicking Bird), Zepko-ete (Big Bow), Set-imkia (Stumbling Bear), Manyi-ten (Woman&#x27;s Heart), Napawat (No Mocassin), Mamanti (Walking-above), Tsen-tainte (White Horse), Ado-ete (Big Tree).

Dohasan, who is also known as Touhason, is considered by many to be the greatest Kiowa Chief (1805–1866), as he unified and ruled the Kiowa for 30 years. He signed several treaties with the United States, including the Fort Atkinson Treaty of July 27, 1852, and the Little Arkansas Treaty of 1865. Guipago became the head chief of the Kiowa when Dohosan (Little Bluff) named him as his successor. Guipago and Satanta, along with old Satank, led the warring faction of the Kiowa nation, while Tene-angopte and Napawat led the peaceful party.

In 1871, Satank, Satanta and Big Tree (translated in some documents as Addo-etta) helped lead the Warren Wagon Train Raid. They were arrested by United States soldiers and transported to Jacksboro, Texas. En route, near Fort Sill, Indian Territory, Satank killed a soldier with a knife and was shot by cavalry troops while trying to escape. Satanta and Big Tree were later convicted of murder by a &quot;cowboy jury&quot;.

In September 1872, Guipago met with Satanta and Ado-ete, the visit being one of Guipago&#x27;s conditions for accepting a request to travel to Washington and meet President Grant for peace talks. Guipago eventually got the two captives released in September 1873. Guipago, Satanta, Set-imkia, Zepko-ete, Manyi-ten, Mamanti, Tsen-tainte and Ado-ete led Kiowa warriors during the &quot;Buffalo war&quot; along the Red River, together with the Comanche allies, in the summer (June–September) 1874. They surrendered after the Palo Duro Canyon fight. Tene-angopte had to select 26 Kiowa chiefs and warriors to be deported; Satanta was sent to a prison in Huntsville, Alabama, while Guipago, Manyi-ten, Mamanti, Tsen-tainte, and others were sent to St. Augustine, Florida, at what was then known as Fort Marion. Tene-angopte, damned by the &quot;medicine-man&quot; Mamanti, died in May 1875; Satanta committed suicide at Huntsville in October 1878. Guipago, having fallen sick with malaria, was jailed in Fort Sill, where he died in 1879.

The sculptor of the Indian Head nickel, James Earle Fraser, is reported to have said that Chief Big Tree (Adoeette) was one of his models for the U.S. coin; it was minted from 1913 through 1938.
===Early history and migration south===

The Kiowa emerged as a distinct people in their original homeland of the northern Missouri River Basin. Searching for more lands of their own, the Kiowa traveled southeast to the Black Hills in present-day South Dakota and Wyoming around 1650. In the Black Hills region, the Kiowa lived peacefully alongside the Crow Indians, with whom they long maintained a close friendship, organized themselves into 10 bands, and numbered around 3000. Pressure from the Ojibwe in the north woods and edge of the great plains in Minnesota forced the Cheyenne, Arapaho, and later the Sioux westward into Kiowa territory around the Black Hills. The Kiowa were pushed south by the invading Cheyenne who were then pushed westward out of the Black Hills by the Sioux. In their early history, the Kiowa traveled with dogs pulling their belongings until horses were obtained through trade and raid with the Spanish and other Indian nations in the southwest.

Eventually the Kiowa shared with the Comanche a vast territory called Comancheria, on the central and southern great plains in western Kansas, eastern Colorado, most of Oklahoma including the panhandle, and the Llano Estacado in the Texas Panhandle and eastern New Mexico. The close relationship of the two tribes began in the early spring of 1790 at the place that would become Las Vegas, New Mexico, a Kiowa party led by war leader Guikate, made an offer of peace to a Comanche party while both were visiting the home of a mutual friend of both tribes. This led to a later meeting between Guikate and the head chief of the Nokoni Comanche. The two groups made an alliance to share the same hunting grounds and entered into a mutual defense pact and became the dominant inhabitants of the Southern Plains. From that time on, the Comanche and Kiowa hunted, traveled, and made war together. In addition to the Comanche, the Kiowa formed a very close alliance with the Plains Apache (Kiowa-Apache), with the two nations sharing much of the same culture and participating in each other&#x27;s annual council meetings and events. The strong alliance of southern plains nations kept the Spanish from gaining a strong colonial hold on the southern plains.

===Indian wars===
In closing years of the 18th century and in the first quarter of the 19th century, the Kiowa feared little from European neighbors. Kiowa ranged north of the Wichita Mountains. The Kiowa and Comanche controlled a vast expanse of territory from the Arkansas River to the Brazos River. The enemies of the Kiowa were usually the enemies of the Comanche. To the east there was warfare with the Osage and Pawnee.

In the early 19th, the Cheyenne and Arapaho began camping on the Arkansas River and new warfare broke out. In the south of the Kiowa and Comanche were Caddoan speakers, but the Kiowa and Comanche were friendly toward these bands. The Comanche were at war with the Apache of the Rio Grande region.
They warred with the Cheyenne and Arapaho, Pawnee, Sac and Fox, and Osages.

In summer 1833, the Osage attacked an exposed Kiowa camp near Head Mountain, Oklahoma. The Kiowa lost many aged people, children and women. The heads were cut off and placed in kettles. During this &quot;Cut-Throat Massacre&quot;, the Osage captured the sacred Tai-me (the Sun Dance figure of the Kiowa) as well. The Kiowa were unable to perform the Sun Dance until the return of the Tai-me in 1835. Dohasan replaced the old Kiowa chief, since he had failed to anticipate danger.

The Kiowa traded with the Wichita south along Red River and with Mescalero Apache and New Mexicans to the southwest. After 1840, they and their former enemies the Cheyenne, as well as their allies the Comanche and the Apache, fought and raided the Eastern natives moving into the Indian Territory.

From 1821 until 1870, the Kiowa joined the Comanche in raids, primarily to obtain livestock, that extended deep into Mexico and caused the death of thousands of people.

===Colonial Transition===
The years from 1873 to 1878 marked a drastic change in Kiowa lifestyle. In June 1874, the Kiowa, along with a group of Comanche and Cheyenne warriors, made their last protest against the European invaders at the Battle of Adobe Walls in Texas, which proved futile. In 1877, the first homes were constructed for the Indian chiefs and a plan was initiated to employ Indians at the Agency. Thirty Indians were hired to form the first police force on the Reservation.

The Kiowa agreed to settle on a reservation in southwestern Oklahoma. Some bands of Kiowas remained at large until 1875. Some of the Lipan Apache and Mescalero Apache bands, with some Comanche in their company, held out in northern Mexico until the early 1880s, when Mexican and U.S. Army forces drove them onto reservations or into extinction. By the Treaty of Medicine Lodge in 1867, the Kiowas settled in Western Oklahoma and Kansas.

They were forced to move south of the Washita River to the Red River and Western Oklahoma with the Comanches and the Kiowa Apache Tribe. The transition from the free life of Plains people to a restricted life of the reservation was more difficult for some families than others.

===Reservation period===
The reservation period lasted from 1868 to 1906. In 1873, the first school among the Kiowa was established by Quaker Thomas C. Battey. In 1877, the federal government built the first homes for the Indian chiefs and initiated a plan to employ Indians. 30 Indians were hired to form the first police force on the reservation. In 1879, the agency was moved from Ft. Sill to Anadarko. The 1890 Census showed 1,598 Comanche at the Fort Sill reservation, which they shared with 1,140 Kiowa and 326 Kiowa Apache.

An agreement made with the Cherokee Commission signed by 456 adult male Kiowa, Comanche, and Kiowa Apache on Sept. 28, 1892, cleared the way for the opening of the country to white settlers. The agreement provided for an allotment of to every individual in the tribes and for the sale of the reservation lands () to the United States – was to go into effect immediately upon ratification by Congress, even though the Medicine Lodge treaty of 1867 had guaranteed Indian possession of the reservation until 1898. The Indian signers wanted their names stricken but it was too late. A&#x27;piatan, as the leader, went to Washington to protest. Chief Lone Wolf the Younger immediately filed proceedings against the act in the Supreme Court, but the Court decided against him in Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock (1903).

Agents were assigned to the Kiowa people.

===Modern period===
Since 1968, the Kiowa have been governed by the Kiowa Tribal Council, which presides over business related to health, education, and economic and industrial development programs.

On March 13, 1970, the Kiowa Indian Tribe of Oklahoma drafted its constitution and bylaws, and Kiowa voters ratified them on May 23, 1970. The current constitution was approved in 2017.

In 1998, in the landmark decision of &quot;Kiowa Tribe of Oklahoma v. Manufacturing Technologies, Inc.&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Indian tribes retain their sovereign immunity as nations from private lawsuits without their consent, even in off-reservation transactions where they do not waive that immunity.

, more than 4,000 of 12,500 enrolled Kiowa lived near the towns of Anadarko, Fort Cobb, and Carnegie, in Caddo and Kiowa counties, Oklahoma. Kiowa also reside in urban and suburban communities throughout the United States, having moved to areas with more jobs. Each year Kiowa veterans commemorate the warlike spirit of the 19th-century leaders with dances performed by the Kiowa Gourd Clan and Kiowa Black Leggings Warrior Society. Kiowa cultural identity and pride is apparent in their expressive culture and strong influence on the Gourd Dance and Southern Plains art.

==Humanities==

Documentation of the history and development of contemporary Kiowa art formulates one of the most unusual records in Native American culture. As early as 1891, Kiowa artists were being commissioned to produce works for display at international expositions. The &quot;Kiowa Six&quot; were some of the earliest Native Americans to receive international recognition for their work in the fine art world. They influenced generations of Indian artists among the Kiowa, and other Plains tribes. Traditional craft skills are not lost among the Kiowa people today and the talented fine arts and crafts produced by Kiowa Indians helped the Oklahoma Indian Arts and Crafts Cooperative flourish over its 20-year existence.

===Ledger art and hide painting===

Early Kiowa ledger artists were those held in captivity by the U.S. Army at Fort Marion in St. Augustine, Florida (1875–1878), at the conclusion of the Red River War, which also is known as the Southern Plains Indian War. Ledger art emerges from the Plains hide painting tradition. These Fort Marion artists include Kiowas Etadleuh Doanmoe and Zotom, who was a prolific artist who chronicled his experiences before and after becoming a captive at the fort. After his release from Fort Marion, Paul Zom-tiam (Zonetime, Koba) studied theology from 1878 until 1881, when he was ordained as a deacon in the Episcopal church.
=== Kiowa Six ===
Following in Silver Horn&#x27;s footsteps were the Kiowa Six, or, as they have been known in the past, the Kiowa Five. They are Spencer Asah, James Auchiah, Jack Hokeah, Stephen Mopope, Lois Smoky Kaulaity, and Monroe Tsatoke. Coming from the area around Anadarko, Oklahoma, these artists studied at the University of Oklahoma. Lois Smoky left the group in 1927, but James Auchiah took her place in the group. The Kiowa Six gained international recognition as fine artists by exhibiting their work in the 1928 International Art Congress in Czechoslovakia and then participated in the Venice Biennale in 1932.

===Painters and sculptors===

Belindo, Kathy Littlechief, Katherine Dickerson, Charlie Silverhorn, Paul McDaniels Jr., Eugenia McDaniels, Kiowa J. Taryole, Grace Tsontekoy, Richard Aitson, Judy Beaver, Vanessa Paukeigope Jennings, Leatrice Geimasaddle, Teri Greeves, and Tahnee Ahtone.

===Authors===
Kiowa author N. Scott Momaday won the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for his novel &quot;House Made of Dawn&quot;. Richard Aitson (Kiowa/Kiowa Apache) was a published poet. Other Kiowa authors include playwright Hanay Geiogamah, poet and filmmaker Gus Palmer Jr., Alyce Sadongei, Marian Kaulaity Hansson, Tocakut, Russell Bates, and Tristan Ahtone.

===Musicians and composers===
Kiowa music often is noted for its hymns that historically were accompanied by dance or played on the flute. Noted Kiowa composers of contemporary music include James Anquoe, noted for his contributions to Native American culture. Contemporary Kiowa musicians include Cornel Pewewardy, Tom Mauchahty-Ware, and Terry Tsotigh.

===Photographers===
Early Kiowa photographers include Parker McKenzie and his wife Nettie Odlety, whose photographs from 1913 are in the collection of the Oklahoma History Center. Kiowa photographer Horace Poolaw (1906–1984) was one of the most prolific Native American photographers of his generation. He documented the Kiowa people living near his community in Mountain View, Oklahoma, beginning the 1920s. His legacy is continued today by his grandson, Thomas Poolaw, a prominent Kiowa photographer and digital artist.

<text>GoldenEye is a 1995 spy film, the seventeenth in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series produced by Eon Productions, and the first to star Pierce Brosnan as the fictional MI6 agent James Bond. Directed by Martin Campbell, it was the first in the series not to use any story elements from the works of novelist Ian Fleming. &quot;GoldenEye&quot; was also the first &quot;James Bond&quot; film not produced by Albert R. Broccoli, following his stepping down from Eon Productions and replacement by his daughter, Barbara Broccoli (along with Michael G. Wilson, although Broccoli was still involved as a consultant producer; it was his final film project before his death in 1996). The story was conceived and written by Michael France, with later collaboration by other writers. In the film, Bond fights to prevent a rogue ex-MI6 agent (Sean Bean), 006, from using a satellite weapon against London to cause a global financial meltdown.

&quot;GoldenEye&quot; was released after a six-year hiatus in the series caused by legal disputes, during which Timothy Dalton&#x27;s contract for the role of James Bond expired and he decided to leave the role, being replaced by Brosnan. M was also recast, actress Judi Dench becoming the first woman to portray the character, replacing Robert Brown. The role of Miss Moneypenny was also recast, Caroline Bliss being replaced by Samantha Bond. Desmond Llewelyn was the only actor to reprise his previous role, as Q. It was the first Bond film made after the dissolution of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War, which provided a background for the plot. Principal photography for &quot;GoldenEye&quot; took place from January to June of 1995 in the UK, Russia, Monte Carlo, and Puerto Rico; it was the inaugural film production to be shot at Leavesden Studios. The first Bond film to use computer-generated imagery (CGI), &quot;GoldenEye&quot; was also the final film in the career of special effects supervisor Derek Meddings, and was dedicated to his memory.

The film accumulated a worldwide gross of over US$356 million, considerably better than the entire 1980s Bond films, without taking inflation into account, to become the fourth-highest grossing film of 1995. It received positive reviews, with critics viewing Brosnan as a worthy successor to Sean Connery’s portrayal as Bond. It also received award nominations for Best Special Visual Effects and Best Sound from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts.

==Plot==

In 1986, MI6 agents James Bond and Alec Trevelyan infiltrate a Soviet chemical weapons facility called Arkangel. After Trevelyan is caught and seemingly killed by the facility&#x27;s commanding officer, Colonel Arkady Grigorovich Ourumov, Bond destroys the site and escapes in a stolen aircraft.

Nine years later, following the dissolution of the Soviet Union, Bond attempts to prevent Xenia Onatopp, a member of the Janus crime syndicate, from stealing a Eurocopter Tiger attack helicopter during a military demonstration in Monte Carlo, but is unsuccessful. Returning to MI6 Headquarters in London, Bond oversees MI6 staff monitoring an incident in Severnaya, Siberia, after the stolen helicopter turns up at a radar facility there. An electromagnetic pulse blast suddenly hits the site, destroying it and Russian fighter aircraft, while knocking out some satellite systems in orbit above.

The newly appointed M assigns Bond to investigate, after it is determined that the blast came from a Soviet-era satellite armed with a nuclear electromagnetic pulse space-based weapon, codenamed &quot;GoldenEye&quot;. Although Janus is suspected of initiating the attack, Bond suspects that Ourumov, now a general, was involved, because the weapon system required high-level military access. Travelling to Saint Petersburg, Bond contacts his CIA assistant Jack Wade, who advises him to meet the former KGB agent turned gangster, Valentin Dmitrovich Zukovsky, and have him arrange a meeting with Janus. Escorted to the meeting by Onatopp, Bond discovers that Janus is led by Trevelyan, who had faked his death at Arkangel. He learns that Trevelyan seeks vengeance for his parents, Lienz Cossacks who were betrayed by the British by being repatriated to the Soviet Union after collaborating with the Axis powers during World War II.

Bond is sedated and trapped in the stolen Tiger alongside Natalya Simonova, a survivor of the Severnaya attack. After escaping the helicopter&#x27;s destruction, the pair are taken into custody and interrogated by Russian Minister of Defence Dimitri Mishkin. Natalya affirms Ourumov&#x27;s involvement in the use of GoldenEye, and that fellow programmer Boris Grishenko survived along with her and is now working for Janus in operating a second GoldenEye satellite. Before Mishkin can act on the information, Ourumov kills him and captures Natalya. Commandeering a T-55 tank, Bond pursues Ourumov to a missile train used by Janus. He kills Ourumov and escapes the train with Natalya before it explodes.

Bond and Natalya travel to Cuba, after Boris is traced to a location within the island&#x27;s jungles. While flying over the area, the pair are shot down. Onatopp is lowered from a helicopter and attacks them, but Bond destroys the helicopter and kills her. The pair uncover a hidden base beneath a large lake, concealing a satellite dish. Bond is captured while trying to rig the base to explode and learns from Trevelyan that he intends to steal money from the Bank of England and use GoldenEye to erase its financial records and conceal the theft, thus damaging London’s economy. Natalya hacks into the satellite and reprograms it to initiate atmospheric re-entry and thus destroy itself. She is then captured as well. While trying to undo her programming, Boris nervously presses on a pen confiscated from Bond, activating a grenade concealed in the pen by Q Branch. Bond knocks the pen from Boris&#x27;s hand and into a puddle of chemicals that were spilled during an earlier firefight, causing a chemical explosion that allows Bond and Natalya to escape.

To prevent Boris from regaining control of the satellite, Bond sabotages the dish&#x27;s antenna by jamming its gears. Trevelyan tries to intercept him, and the ensuing fight between the two culminates in Trevelyan being dangled below the antenna. Bond then drops Trevelyan into the bottom of the dish. The GoldenEye satellite is subsequently destroyed. Natalya soon rescues Bond in a commandeered helicopter, moments before the antenna malfunctions and explodes, destroying the base. The debris falls onto Trevelyan, crushing him to death, and Boris dies from an explosion caused by ruptured liquid nitrogen canisters. After landing in a meadow, Bond and Natalya prepare to enjoy some solitude together, but are interrupted by the arrival of Wade and a team of U.S. Marines, who escort them to Guantanamo Bay Naval Base.

==Production==
===Development===
Following the release of &quot;Licence to Kill&quot; in July 1989, pre-production work for the seventeenth film in the &quot;James Bond&quot; series, the third to star Timothy Dalton (fulfilling his three-film contract), began in May 1990. A poster for the then-upcoming movie was even featured in the Carlton Hotel during the 1990 Cannes Film Festival. In August, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; reported that producer Albert R. Broccoli had parted company with screenwriter Richard Maibaum, who had worked on the scripts of all but three &quot;Bond&quot; films so far, and director John Glen, responsible for the previous five installments in the series. That same year, Broccoli met with potential directors, which included John Landis, Ted Kotcheff, Roger Spottiswoode (who would later direct &quot;Tomorrow Never Dies&quot;), and John Byrum. 

Broccoli&#x27;s stepson Michael G. Wilson contributed a script, and &quot;Wiseguy&quot; co-producer Alfonse Ruggiero Jr. was hired to rewrite it. Filming was set to begin in 1990 in Hong Kong, for a release in late 1991. A 17-page treatment, dated May 1990, featured James Bond on a mission in East Asia; Bond must investigate why an unknown entity caused a chemical plant in Scotland to explode inexplicably and a threat ordering the British and Chinese to relinquish their authority over Hong Kong. Bond would be aided by an ex-CIA freelance thief named Connie Webb and a senior spy named Denholm Crisp, with the trail leading towards a corrupt technology magnate called Sir Henry Lee Ching. It also would have featured the Chinese Ministry of State Security. 

Wilson and Ruggiero revised the plotline further in a script dated July 1990. It changed the opening to show Bond using a hang-gliding competition as cover to infiltrate a chemical weapons plant, where he must fend off a deadly security robot. The film proper begins in the South China Sea, where a British Harrier jet malfunctions, ejects its pilot, starts flying on its own, and then crashes into a village in China. MI6 subsequently learns that many British military technology manufacturing plants have been recently broken into and Bond is sent to track down the burglar. This draft also featured a climax in which the villain survived the destruction of their lair and subsequently attempted to kill Bond. 

In January 1991, the script was further rewritten by William Osborne and William Davies. After the Gulf War, the chemical plant opening from the prior script was revised to take place in Libya. The film would then have focused on the theft of a high-tech stealth fighter by American mobsters, with Bond trying to find it, first in Vancouver and then in Las Vegas. The aircraft is subsequently secured by a Hong Kong-based industrialist, Sir Henry Ferguson, who wants to use it to allow a Chinese military general to stage a nuclear attack and coup d&#x27;état against Mainland China, with the general then leaving the industrialist in control of Hong Kong.

Dalton declared in a 2010 interview that the script had been ready and &quot;we were talking directors&quot; before the project entered development hell caused by legal problems between Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, parent company of the series&#x27; distributor United Artists, and Broccoli&#x27;s Danjaq, owners of the &quot;Bond&quot; film rights. In 1990, MGM/UA was to be sold for $1.5 billion to Qintex, an Australian-American financial services company that had begun making television broadcast and entertainment purchases. When Qintex could not provide a $50 million letter of credit, the deal fell apart. Italian financier Giancarlo Parretti, CEO of Pathé Entertainment (unrelated to the French studio Pathé) quickly moved in to buy MGM/UA for $1.2 billion and merged the companies to create MGM-Pathé Communications. Parretti intended to sell off the distribution rights of the studio&#x27;s catalogue so that he could collect advance payments to finance the buyout. This included international broadcasting rights to the 007 library at cut-rate prices, leading Danjaq to sue, alleging that the licensing violated the &quot;Bond&quot; distribution agreements the company made with United Artists in 1962, while denying Danjaq a share of the profits. Countersuits were filed. When asked what he would do following resolution of the lawsuits, Dalton told Broccoli that it was unlikely that he would continue in the role.

Parretti&#x27;s behaviour led to the bankruptcy of MGM-Pathé, and additional lawsuits eventually resulted in a foreclosure by financial backer Crédit Lyonnais in 1992. The &quot;Bond&quot; rights lawsuits were settled in December 1992, and the renamed Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, now run by a Crédit Lyonnais subsidiary, began to explore further development of &quot;Bond 17&quot; with Danjaq in 1993. Dalton was still Broccoli&#x27;s choice to play Bond, but the star&#x27;s original seven-year contract with Danjaq expired that same year. Dalton has stated that the delay to his third film effectively ended the contract in 1990.

===Pre-production and writing===
In May 1993, MGM announced that a seventeenth &quot;James Bond&quot; film was in pre-production, to be based on a screenplay by Michael France. France studied for his script by travelling to Russia to interview former KGB agents and visit nuclear research laboratories. With Broccoli&#x27;s health deteriorating (he died seven months after the release of &quot;GoldenEye&quot;), his daughter Barbara Broccoli described him as taking &quot;a bit of a back seat&quot; in the film&#x27;s production. Barbara and Michael G. Wilson took the lead roles in production, while Albert Broccoli oversaw the production of &quot;GoldenEye&quot; as a consulting producer, credited as &quot;presenter&quot;. Wilson wanted to frame the film in the post-Cold War era and the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union, when there were concerns about proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Broccoli contacted Dalton, to ask again if he would come back, and now found him open to the idea.

In August 1993, France, having turned in his first draft, continued to work on the script. In further discussion with Broccoli, Dalton expressed excitement over taking the best elements of his previous two films and combining them as a basis for one final film. Broccoli stressed that, after the long gap without a film, Dalton could not come back and just do a single film but needed to return for multiple films. Although France&#x27;s screenplay was completed by January 1994, production was pushed back with no concrete start. In April 1994, Dalton officially resigned from the role. In a 2014 interview, Dalton revealed that he agreed with Broccoli&#x27;s expectation but could not commit to appearing in four or five more films.
Further work was done on the screenplay throughout 1994. France&#x27;s screenplay introduced the character of &quot;Augustus Trevelyan&quot;, Bond&#x27;s MI6 superior and a defector to Soviet Union, as the main villain. As in the completed version, his scheme involved a stolen orbital EMP weapon. The first draft started with an Aston Martin car chase aboard a high-speed train. However, Barbara Broccoli was concerned that France&#x27;s screenplay was still too unstructured and brought in Jeffrey Caine to rewrite it. Caine kept many of France&#x27;s ideas but added the prologue before the credits and rewrote Trevelyan closer to his iteration in the final film. Kevin Wade did a three-week rewrite and Bruce Feirstein added the finishing touches. In the film, the writing credit was shared by Caine and Feirstein, while France was credited with only the story, an arrangement he felt was unfair, particularly as he believed that the additions made were not an improvement on his original version. Wade did not receive an official credit, but was acknowledged in the naming of Jack Wade, the CIA character he created.

The opening scene, in which an admiral is seduced and then killed, had to be rewritten following a demand from the US military, after which the nationality of the admiral was changed from American to Canadian.

While the story was not based on a work by Ian Fleming, the title &quot;GoldenEye&quot; came from the name of Fleming&#x27;s Jamaican estate, where he wrote the &quot;Bond&quot; novels. Fleming gave a number of origins for the name of his estate, including Carson McCullers&#x27; &quot;Reflections in a Golden Eye&quot; and Operation Goldeneye, a contingency plan Fleming himself developed during the Second World War in case of a Nazi invasion through Spain.

Although &quot;GoldenEye&quot; was released only six years after &quot;Licence to Kill&quot;, world politics had changed dramatically in the interim. It was the first &quot;James Bond&quot; film to be produced after the fall of the Berlin Wall, the collapse of the Soviet Union, and the end of the Cold War, and there was doubt over the character&#x27;s relevance in the modern world. Some in the film industry felt it would be &quot;futile&quot; for the &quot;Bond&quot; series to make a comeback, and that the character was best left as &quot;an icon of the past&quot;. The producers even thought of new concepts for the series, such as a period piece set in the 1960s, a female 007, or a black James Bond. Ultimately, they chose to return to the basics of the series, not following the sensitive and caring Bond of the Dalton films or the political correctness that started to permeate the decade. The film came to be seen as a successful revitalization, and it effectively adapted the series for the 1990s. One of &quot;GoldenEye&quot;″s innovations includes the casting of a female M. In the film, the new M quickly establishes her authority, remarking that Bond is a &quot;sexist, misogynist dinosaur&quot; and a &quot;relic of the Cold War&quot;. This is an early indication that Bond is portrayed as far less tempestuous than Timothy Dalton&#x27;s Bond from 1989.

John Woo was approached as the director, and turned down the opportunity, but said he was honoured by the offer. Michael Caton-Jones and Peter Medak were also considered. The producers then chose New Zealander Martin Campbell as the director. Brosnan later described Campbell as &quot;warrior-like in his take on the piece&quot; and said that &quot;there was a huge passion there on both our parts&quot;.

===Casting===
To replace Dalton, the producers chose Pierce Brosnan, who, after Dalton had initially turned down the role, had been prevented from succeeding Roger Moore in 1986 because of his contract to continue starring in the television series &quot;Remington Steele&quot;. He was introduced to the public at a press conference at the Regent Palace Hotel on 8 June 1994. Before negotiating with Brosnan, Mel Gibson, Hugh Grant, and Liam Neeson passed on the role. Neeson said that his then fiancée Natasha Richardson wouldn&#x27;t marry him if he accepted the role. Broccoli and Campbell met with Ralph Fiennes to discuss his taking the part. Fiennes later played Gareth Mallory / M in &quot;Skyfall&quot; (2012), &quot;Spectre&quot; (2015), and &quot;No Time to Die&quot; (2021). Paul McGann auditioned the role and was the studio&#x27;s second choice if Brosnan turned it down. Brosnan was paid $1.2 million for the film, out of a total budget of $60 million. The English actress Judi Dench was cast as M, replacing Robert Brown, making this the first film of the series to feature a female M. The decision is widely believed to have been inspired by Stella Rimington, who had become head of MI5 in 1992.

The character of Alec Trevelyan was originally scripted as &quot;Augustus Trevelyan&quot; and envisaged as an older character and a mentor to Bond. Anthony Hopkins and Alan Rickman were reportedly sought for the role, but both turned it down. Sean Bean was subsequently cast and the character was rewritten as Bond&#x27;s peer. The character of Natalya Simionova, originally scripted as &quot;Marina Varoskaya&quot;, was supposed to be Paulina Porizkova, but Izabella Scorupco was subsequently cast. The character of Boris Griscenko was originally scripted as &quot;Alexei Makvenio&quot;, but Alan Cumming was still in the early cast. The character of Valentin Zukovsky was originally scripted as Valentin Kosgyn, aka Romaly. The character of General Ourumov was originally named &quot;Illya Borchenko&quot;. The character General Pushkin from &quot;The Living Daylights&quot; appeared in France&#x27;s initial script, but the character was rewritten as Defense Minister Mishkin.

===Filming===
Principal photography for the film began on 16 January 1995 and continued until 2 June. Eon was unable to film at Pinewood Studios, the usual studio for Bond films, because it had been reserved for &quot;First Knight&quot;. Instead, with little time to find a space which could hold the number of large scale sets needed for production, Eon found an old Rolls-Royce factory at Leavesden Aerodrome in Hertfordshire, which had wide, tall, and open aircraft hangars that were uniquely suited to be converted into stages for a new studio. Eon leased the site for the duration of their shoot, gutted the factory and turned it into stages, workshops and offices, and dubbed it Leavesden Studios. This process is shown on the 2006 DVD&#x27;s special features.

The bungee jump was filmed at the Contra Dam (also known as the Verzasca or Locarno Dam) in Ticino, Switzerland. The casino scenes and the Tiger helicopter&#x27;s demonstration were shot in Monte Carlo. Reference footage for the tank chase was shot on location in Saint Petersburg and matched to the studio at Leavesden. The climactic scenes on the satellite dish were shot at Arecibo Observatory in Puerto Rico. The actual MI6 headquarters were used for external views of M&#x27;s office. Some of the scenes in St. Petersburg were actually shot in London – the Epsom Downs Racecourse doubled as the airport – to reduce expenses and security concerns, as the second unit sent to Russia required bodyguards.

The French Navy provided full use of the frigate &quot;La Fayette&quot; and their newest helicopter, the Eurocopter Tiger, to the film&#x27;s production team. The French government also allowed the use of Navy logos as part of the promotional campaign for it. However, the producers had a dispute with the French Ministry of Defence over Brosnan&#x27;s opposition to French nuclear weapons testing and his involvement with Greenpeace; as a result, the French premiere of the film was cancelled.

The sequences involving the armored train were filmed on the Nene Valley Railway, near Peterborough. The train was composed of a British Rail Class 20 diesel-electric locomotive and a pair of Mark 1 coaches, all three heavily disguised to resemble a Soviet armoured train.

===Effects===
The film was the last one of special effects supervisor Derek Meddings, to whom it was dedicated. Meddings&#x27; major contribution was miniatures. It was also the first Bond film to use computer-generated imagery. Among the model effects are most external shots of Severnaya, the scene where Janus&#x27; train crashes into the tank, and the lake which hides the satellite dish, since the producers could not find a round lake in Puerto Rico. The climax in the satellite dish used scenes in Arecibo, a model built by Meddings&#x27; team and scenes shot with stuntmen in Britain.

Stunt car coordinator Rémy Julienne described the car chase between the Aston Martin DB5 and the Ferrari F355 as between &quot;a perfectly shaped, old and vulnerable vehicle and a racecar.&quot; The stunt had to be meticulously planned as the cars are vastly different. Nails had to be attached to the F355 tyres to make it skid, and during one take of the sliding vehicles, the two cars collided.

The largest stunt sequence in the film was the tank chase, which took around six weeks to film, partly on location in St. Petersburg and partly on the old de Havilland runway at Leavesden. According to second-unit director Ian Sharp it was thought up by special effects supervisor Chris Corbould, during a pre-production meeting that lasted only ten minutes. Parts of the tank chase were filmed at the backlot of Leavesden, parts on location in St. Petersburg. The whole chase was storyboarded very carefully, said Sharp. A Russian T-54/T-55 tank, on loan from the East England Military Museum, was modified with the addition of fake explosive reactive armour panels. To avoid destroying the pavement on the city streets of St. Petersburg, the steel off-road tracks of the T-54/55 were replaced with the rubber-shoed tracks from a British Chieftain tank. The T-55 tank used in the film is now on permanent display at Old Buckenham Airfield, where the East England Military Museum is based.

For the confrontation between Bond and Trevelyan inside the antenna cradle, director Campbell decided to take inspiration from Bond&#x27;s fight with Red Grant in &quot;From Russia with Love&quot;. Brosnan and Bean did all the stunts themselves, except for one take where one is thrown against the wall. Brosnan injured his hand while filming the extending ladder sequence, making producers delay his scenes and film the ones in Severnaya earlier.

The opening bungee jump at Arkhangelsk, shot at the Contra Dam in Switzerland and performed by Wayne Michaels, was voted the best movie stunt of all time in a 2002 Sky Movies poll, and set a record for the highest bungee jump off a fixed structure. The ending of the pre-credits sequence with Bond jumping after the aeroplane features Jacques Malnuit riding the motorcycle to the edge and jumping, and B.J. Worth diving after the plane – which was a working aircraft, with Worth adding that part of the difficulty of the stunt was the kerosene striking his face.

The fall of Communism in Russia is the main focus of the opening titles, designed by Daniel Kleinman (who took over from Maurice Binder after his death in 1991). They show the collapse and destruction of several structures associated with the Soviet Union, such as the red star, statues of Communist leaders—notably Joseph Stalin—and the hammer and sickle. In an interview, Kleinman said they were meant to be &quot;a kind of story telling sequence&quot; showing that &quot;what was happening in Communist countries was Communism was falling down&quot;. According to producer Michael G. Wilson, some Communist parties protested against &quot;Socialist symbols being destroyed not by governments, but by bikini-clad women&quot;, especially certain Indian Communist parties, which threatened to boycott the film.

===Product placement===

The film was the first one bound by BMW&#x27;s three-picture deal, so the producers were offered BMW&#x27;s latest roadster, the BMW Z3. It was featured in the film months before its release, and a limited edition &quot;007 model&quot; sold out within a day of being available to order. As part of the car&#x27;s marketing strategy, several Z3&#x27;s were used to drive journalists from a complimentary meal at the Rainbow Room restaurant to its premiere at the Radio City Music Hall.

For the film, a convertible Z3 is equipped with the usual Q refinements, including a self-destruct feature and Stinger missiles behind the headlights. The Z3 does not have much screen time and none of the gadgets is used, which Martin Campbell attributed to the deal with BMW coming in the last stages of production. The Z3&#x27;s appearance in the film is thought to be the most successful promotion through product placement in 1995. Ten years later, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; listed it as one of the most successful product placements in recent years. The article quoted Mary Lou Galician, head of media analysis and criticism at Arizona State University&#x27;s Walter Cronkite School of Journalism and Mass Communication, as saying that the news coverage of Bond&#x27;s switch from Aston Martin to BMW &quot;generated hundreds of millions of dollars of media exposure for the movie and all of its marketing partners.&quot;

In addition, all computers in the film were provided by IBM, and in some scenes (such as the pen grenade scene towards the end), the OS/2 Warp splash screen can be seen on computer monitors. During the Q Lab scene, James Bond can be seen using an IBM ThinkPad laptop ignoring Q&#x27;s instructions on the use of a leather belt modified with a piton gun. This moment was not present in early drafts of the film, but it is understood that director Martin Campbell had 007 fiddling with the keyboard of this computer as a way to show Bond was visibly ignoring the Quartermaster, but also as a way increase IBM&#x27;s product placement arrangement.

A modified Omega Seamaster Professional Diver 300M wristwatch features as a spy gadget device several times in the film, concealing a cutting laser and detonator remote. This was the first time Bond was shown to be wearing a watch by Omega, and he has since worn Omega watches in every subsequent production. While the scene of the tank running through a truck full of drinks was storyboarded with a Pepsi truck, Perrier signed in a deal to be featured, providing around 90,000 cans for the scene.

===Marketing===
As James Bond entered in the 1990s, hand-painted poster designs were eschewed in favor of cutting-edge photomontage tools, promoting the return of 007 portrayed by Pierce Brosnan. Under the direction of John Parkinson and Gordon Arnell from the marketing department of MGM, many posters were produced for the film designed by Randi Braun and Earl Klasky with photographs taken by John Stoddart, Terry O&#x27;Neill, Keith Hamshere and George Withear. In the United States, an advance poster featured a gold-hued close-up on Bond&#x27;s eyes pointing his Walther PPK handgun towards the viewer. The logo of the film was not displayed, only a tagline: &quot;There is no substitute&quot; and the 007 gun logo, in red. For the international market, a different advance poster was issued on which Pierce Brosnan appeared in black dinner jacket holding his silenced PPK gun, next to a 007 logo and under a different tagline: &quot;You know the name. You know the number&quot;. This time, the film&#x27;s logo was introduced, using the MatrixWide typeface (earlier versions of this logo used a modified FrizQuadrata typography). The theatrical artwork had two variations: both retained the same black background and action scenes collage surrounding the three principals (Pierce Brosnan, Izabella Scorupco and Famke Janssen), but the International poster had James Bond in tuxedo while in the US version only had the secret agent&#x27;s face emerging from the shadows. The US variant was used for the cover artwork of the film&#x27;s soundtrack and the box of the Nintendo 64 video game adaptation released in 1997. On a 2015 interview regarding his take on the &quot;GoldenEye&quot; poster campaign, photographer John Stoddart (who previously worked with Brosnan for a Brioni photoshoot) said his only directive was &quot;Bond, girls and guns&quot;

In July 1995, a teaser trailer for &quot;GoldenEye&quot; was attached to prints of Roger Donaldson&#x27;s film &quot;Species&quot; after its debut on the syndicated US television program &quot;Extra&quot;, followed by a more generic theatrical trailer which revealed Bond&#x27;s confrontation with agent 006. Asked about the inclusion of this spoiler in a 2019 interview, former MGM/UA Vice-president Jeff Kleeman pointed out that he felt &quot;the idea of 006 vs 007 was a selling point&quot;. Both trailers were directed by Joe Nimziki.

===Music===

The theme song, &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, was written by Bono and the Edge, and was performed by Tina Turner. As the producers did not collaborate with Bono or the Edge, the film score did not incorporate any of the theme song&#x27;s melodies, as was the case in previous James Bond films. Swedish group Ace of Base had also written a proposed theme song, but label Arista Records pulled the band out of the project, fearing the negative impact in case the film flopped. The song was then rewritten as their single &quot;The Juvenile&quot;.

The soundtrack was composed and performed by Éric Serra. Prolific Bond composer John Barry said that, despite an offer by Barbara Broccoli, he turned it down. Serra&#x27;s score has been criticised: Richard von Busack, in &quot;Metro&quot;, wrote that it was &quot;more appropriate for a ride on an elevator than a ride on a roller coaster&quot;, and Filmtracks said Serra &quot;failed completely in his attempt to tie &quot;GoldenEye&quot; to the franchise&#x27;s past.&quot;

Martin Campbell would also later express his disappointment with the score, citing budget constraints and difficulty working with Serra, who became uncooperative when asked to re-score the St. Petersburg tank chase after Campbell rejected his submitted track. John Altman would later provide the music for the sequence, while Serra&#x27;s original track can still be found on the soundtrack as &quot;A Pleasant Drive in St. Petersburg&quot;.

Serra composed and performed a number of synthesiser tracks, including the version of the &quot;James Bond Theme&quot; that plays during the gun barrel sequence, while Altman and David Arch provided the more traditional symphonic music. The end credits song, Serra&#x27;s &quot;The Experience of Love&quot;, was based on a short cue Serra had originally written for Luc Besson&#x27;s &quot;Léon&quot; one year earlier.

==Release==
&quot;GoldenEye&quot; premiered on 13 November 1995, at the Radio City Music Hall, and went on general release in the United States on 17 November 1995. The UK premiere followed on 21 November at the Odeon Leicester Square, with general release three days later. The film also had the German premiere on 5 December, at which Brosnan was present, at Mathäser-Filmpalast (de) in Munich, with general release on December 28; and the Swedish premiere on 8 December, attended by Brosnan and Scorupco, at Rigoletto (sv) in Stockholm, with general release on the same day. The after-party took place at Stockholm&#x27;s Grand Hôtel. Brosnan boycotted the French premiere to support Greenpeace&#x27;s protest against the French nuclear testing program.

The film earned over $26 million during its opening across 2,667 cinemas in the United States and Canada. In the United Kingdom, it grossed a record $5.5 million for a non-holiday week from 448 theatres and was the third biggest in history, behind &quot;Jurassic Park&quot; and &quot;Batman Forever&quot;. It had the fourth-highest worldwide gross of all films in 1995, and was the most successful Bond film since &quot;Moonraker&quot;, taking inflation into account.

The film was edited to be guaranteed a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) and a 12 rating from the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC). The cuts included the visible bullet impact to Trevelyan&#x27;s head when he is shot in the prologue, several additional deaths during the sequence in which Onatopp guns down the workers at the Severnaya station, more explicit footage and violent behaviour in the Admiral&#x27;s death, extra footage of Onatopp&#x27;s death, and Bond knocking her out with a rabbit punch in the car. In 2006, the film was remastered for the James Bond Ultimate Edition DVD in which the BBFC cuts were restored, causing the rating to be changed to 15. However, the original MPAA edits still remain.

==Reception==
===Initial critical response===
The critical reception of the film was mostly positive. Film review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes holds it at an 80% approval rating with an approval rating of 7.1/10, based on 85 reviews. The website&#x27;s critics consensus states: &quot;The first and best Pierce Brosnan Bond film, &quot;GoldenEye&quot; brings the series into a more modern context, and the result is a 007 entry that&#x27;s high-tech, action-packed, and urbane.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 65 out of 100, based on 19 critics, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;A−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

In the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Roger Ebert gave the film 3 stars out of 4, and said Brosnan&#x27;s Bond was &quot;somehow more sensitive, more vulnerable, more psychologically complete&quot; than the previous ones, also commenting on Bond&#x27;s &quot;loss of innocence&quot; since previous films. James Berardinelli described Brosnan as &quot;a decided improvement over his immediate predecessor&quot; with a &quot;flair for wit to go along with his natural charm&quot;, but added that &quot;fully one-quarter of &quot;GoldenEye&quot; is momentum-killing padding.&quot;

Several reviewers lauded M&#x27;s appraisal of Bond as a &quot;sexist, misogynist dinosaur&quot;, with Todd McCarthy in &quot;Variety&quot; saying the film &quot;breathes fresh creative and commercial life&quot; into the series. John Puccio of DVD Town said that it was &quot;an eye- and ear-pleasing, action-packed entry in the Bond series&quot; and that the film gave Bond &quot;a bit of humanity, too&quot;. Ian Nathan of &quot;Empire&quot; said that it &quot;revamps that indomitable British spirit&quot; and that the &quot;Die Hard&quot; movies &quot;don&#x27;t even come close to 007&quot;. Tom Sonne of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; considered it the best Bond film since &quot;The Spy Who Loved Me&quot;. Jose Arroyo of &quot;Sight &amp; Sound&quot; considered the greatest success of it was in modernising the series.

However, the film received several negative reviews. Richard Schickel of &quot;Time&quot; wrote that after &quot;a third of a century&#x27;s hard use&quot;, Bond&#x27;s conventions survived on &quot;wobbly knees&quot;, while in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, Owen Gleiberman thought the series had &quot;entered a near-terminal state of exhaustion.&quot; Kenneth Turan of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that it was &quot;a middle-aged entity anxious to appear trendy at all costs&quot;. David Eimer of &quot;Premiere&quot; wrote that &quot;the trademark humour is in short supply&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Goldeneye&quot; isn&#x27;t classic Bond by any stretch of the imagination.&quot;

===Retrospective reviews===
Often ranked as Pierce Brosnan&#x27;s best Bond film, &quot;GoldenEye&quot;″s reputation has only improved since its release. It is ranked high in Bond-related lists, as &quot;IGN&quot; chose it as the fifth-best movie, while &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; ranked it eighth, and Norman Wilner of MSN as ninth. &quot;EW&quot; also voted Xenia Onatopp as the sixth-most memorable Bond girl, while &quot;IGN&quot; ranked Natalya as seventh in a similar list. The film enjoys a large and enthusiastic following among Bond fans, especially those who grew up with the &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; video game. In a 2021 Yahoo! survey consisting of 2200 scholars and Bond superfans, &quot;GoldenEye&quot; was voted as the best Bond film, followed by Daniel Craig&#x27;s &quot;Casino Royale&quot; and George Lazenby&#x27;s &quot;On Her Majesty&#x27;s Secret Service&quot;.

===Awards===
The film was nominated for two BAFTAs—Best Sound and Special Visual Effects—in 1996, but lost to &quot;Braveheart&quot; and &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, respectively. Éric Serra won a BMI Film Award for the soundtrack, and it also earned nominations for Best Action, Adventure or Thriller Film and Actor at the 22nd Saturn Awards, and Best Fight and Best Sandwich in a Movie at the 1996 MTV Movie Awards.

==Appearances in other media==
&quot;GoldenEye&quot; was the second and final Bond film to be adapted to a novel by novelist John Gardner. The book closely follows its storyline, but Gardner added a violent sequence prior to the opening bungee jump in which Bond kills a group of Russian guards, a change that would be retained and expanded upon in the video game &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;.

In late 1995, Topps Comics began publishing a three-issue comic book adaptation of the film. The script was adapted by Don McGregor with art by Rick Magyar. The first issue carried a January 1996 cover date. For unknown reasons, Topps cancelled the entire adaptation after the first issue had been published, and to date the adaptation has not been released in its entirety.

Also in 1995, Tiger Electronics released a third-person shooter handheld electronic game in two different variants: a gamepad variant, with a liquid-crystal display (LCD), a cross-shaped push button and two line-shaped ones and four settings buttons on the lower side of the screen, and a &quot;Grip Games&quot; line variant, shaped like a pistol grip, with a trigger used to shoot and other buttons on the rear. The two editions were slightly different.

The film was the basis for &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot;, a video game for the Nintendo 64 developed by Rare and published by Nintendo. It was praised by critics and in January 2000, readers of the British video game magazine &quot;Computer and Video Games&quot; listed it in first place in a list of &quot;the hundred greatest video games&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Edge&quot;″s included it as one of their top ten shooter games of all time. It is based upon the film, but many of the missions were extended or modified.

A version of &quot;Goldeneye&quot; was developed as a racing game intended to be released for the Virtual Boy console. However, it was cancelled before release. In 2004, Electronic Arts released &quot;&quot;, the first game of the James Bond series in which the player does not take on the role of Bond. Instead, the protagonist is an aspiring Double-0 agent Jonathan Hunter, known by his codename &quot;GoldenEye&quot;, recruited by a villain of the Bond universe, Auric Goldfinger. Except for the appearance of Xenia Onatopp, it was unrelated to the film, and was released to mediocre reviews. It was excoriated by several critics including Eric Qualls for using the name &quot;GoldenEye&quot; as an attempt to ride on the success of Rare&#x27;s game. In 2010, an independent development team released &quot;&quot;, a multiplayer only total conversion mod developed using Valve&#x27;s Source engine.

Nintendo announced a remake of the original &quot;GoldenEye 007&quot; at their E3 press conference on 15 June 2010. It is a modernised retelling of the original movie&#x27;s story, with Daniel Craig playing the role of Bond. Bruce Feirstein returned to write a modernised version of the script, while Nicole Scherzinger covered the theme song. It was developed by Eurocom and published by Activision for the Wii and Nintendo DS and was released in November 2010. Both the DS and Wii versions bear little to no resemblance to the locations and weapons of the original N64 release. In 2011, the game was ported to PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 under the name &quot;GoldenEye 007: Reloaded&quot;.

<text>Granville Oral Roberts (January 24, 1918 – December 15, 2009) was an American Charismatic Christian televangelist, who was one of the first to propagate Prosperity Gospel Theology. He was ordained in the Pentecostal Holiness Church from 1936 until his transfer to the United Methodist church in 1968, a controversial relationship that ended in 1987 when his credentials were revoked. He is considered one of the forerunners of the charismatic movement, and at the height of his career was one of the most recognized preachers in the US. He founded the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association and Oral Roberts University.

One of the most well-known and controversial American religious leaders of the 20th century, his preaching emphasized seed-faith. His ministries reached millions of followers worldwide spanning a period of over six decades. His healing ministry and his bringing American Pentecostalism into the mainstream had the most impact, but he also pioneered televangelism, and laid the foundations of the prosperity gospel and abundant life teachings. The breadth and style of his ministry, including his widely publicized funding appeals, made him a consistent subject of contention among critics and supporters.

==Early life==
Roberts was born on January 24, 1918, in Pontotoc County, Oklahoma, the fifth and youngest child of the Reverend Ellis Melvin Roberts (1881–1967) and Claudius Priscilla Roberts (née Irwin) (1885–1974). In an interview on &quot;Larry King Live&quot;, Roberts claimed his mother was of Cherokee descent. Roberts also claimed Choctaw heritage. However, census records indicate that Roberts and his family are listed as &quot;white&quot;, including his mother despite her claims to be &quot;one-quarter Cherokee.&quot; Roberts began life in poverty, and nearly died of tuberculosis when he was 17. After finishing high school, Roberts studied for two years each at Oklahoma Baptist University and Phillips University. In 1938, he married a preacher&#x27;s daughter, Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock.

Roberts became a traveling faith healer after ending his college studies without a degree. According to a &quot;TIME Magazine&quot; profile of 1972, Roberts originally made a name for himself with a large mobile tent &quot;that sat 3,000 on metal folding chairs&quot;.

==Ministry and university==
In 1945, Roberts resigned from his pastorate in Shawnee, Oklahoma, to hold revivals in the area and attend Oklahoma Baptist. But in the late summer of 1945, while preaching in a North Carolina camp meeting, Roberts was asked by Robert E. &quot;Daddy&quot; Lee of Toccoa, Georgia, to consider becoming pastor of his small, eighty-member church. Roberts suggested they pray about it, and unexpectedly, decided to accept. By the end of the year, Roberts resigned and moved back to Shawnee. Apparently, the Georgia conference of the International Pentecostal Holiness Church frowned on having a minister from outside its conference as a pastor. Short though it was, the Toccoa detour had a lasting effect on Roberts and his family. It was there that their daughter Rebecca, then five years old, first met her future husband, Marshall. There were also reportedly two instances of healing, which Roberts would later look back on as his first realization &quot;that I was approaching &#x27;my hour&#x27;.&quot;

Until 1947, Roberts struggled as a part-time preacher in Oklahoma, but when he was 29, Roberts said he picked up his Bible and it fell open at the Third Epistle of John, where he read verse 2: &quot;I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health, even as thy soul prospereth.&quot; The next day, he said, he bought a Buick and God appeared, directing him to heal the sick.

Roberts resigned his pastoral ministry with the Pentecostal Holiness Church to found Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association (OREA). He conducted evangelistic and faith healing drives across the United States and around the world, claiming he could raise the dead. In November 1947, he started &quot;Healing Waters&quot;, a monthly magazine as a means to promote his meetings. Thousands of sick people waited in line to stand before Oral Roberts so he could pray for them. He appeared as a guest speaker for hundreds of national and international meetings and conventions. Through the years, he conducted more than 300 &quot;crusades&quot; on six continents, and personally laid hands in prayer on more than 2 million people.

In January 1955, Oral Roberts held a &quot;salvation and healing&quot; campaign in Johannesburg, South Africa. It was an era of apartheid. He was bitterly assailed by the &quot;Sunday Express&quot; for the hysteria and traffic jams of 20,000 people that packed big Wembley stadium and playing field. Other newspapers reported on the healings and 25,000 people saved. Roberts left behind a residual campaign fund in South Africa of $37,000 less expenses, with the hope that &quot;his campaign will save 100,000 during the coming year&quot;. Three of the four sponsoring churches were Pentecostal, including Apostolic Faith Mission (AFM) and the Assemblies of God – White Group (AG). The campaign committee consisted entirely of white Afrikaner missionaries and ministers, H.R. Carter, D.D. Freeman, A.J. Schoeman (head of AFM), and W.F. Mullan (head of AG). The campaign committee had plans to use the Oral Roberts&#x27; 100,000 Souls for Africa Campaign residual fund to hold revivals in 1955 to win souls for Christ, both Afrikaners (white) and Africans (black). The campaign committee sponsored a young evangelist from the U.S.A. Emanuele Cannistraci, and paid for his revivals in Johannesburg at the Fairview Assemblies Hall and a portion of Bethshan Tabernacle&#x27;s costs for Cannistraci&#x27;s revival in Durban South Africa, a congregation of mixed race. Cannistraci&#x27;s photos, including his claims of healing two deaf and dumb brothers during the revival, were published in Oral Roberts&#x27; &quot;America&#x27;s Healing Magazine&quot;.

He also ran direct mail campaigns of seed-faith, which appealed to poor Americans, often from ethnic minorities. At its peak in the early 1980s, Roberts was the leader of a $120 million-a-year organization employing 2,300 people. This included not only a university but also a medical school and hospital as well as buildings on south of Tulsa valued at $500 million. Another part of the Oral Roberts Evangelistic Association, the Abundant Life Prayer Group (ALPG), was founded in 1958.

In 1963, he founded Oral Roberts University (ORU) in Tulsa, Oklahoma, stating he was obeying a command from God. The university was chartered during 1963 and received its first students in 1965. Students were required to sign an honor code pledging not to drink, smoke, or engage in premarital sexual activities. The Prayer Tower, opened in 1967, is located at the center of the campus.
Roberts was a pioneer televangelist, and attracted a vast viewership. He began broadcasting by radio in 1947, and began broadcasting his revivals by television in 1954. His television ministry continued with &quot;The Abundant Life&quot; program reaching 80% of the United States by 1957, and quarterly Prime Time Specials from 1969 through 1980. In 1996, he founded Golden Eagle Broadcasting.

On March 17, 1968, Roberts and his wife were received as members of the Boston Avenue United Methodist Church in Tulsa, Oklahoma, by Dr. Finis Crutchfield, its then pastor. The United Methodist Church offered more leniency in doctrinal and moral issues than the Pentecostal Holiness Church had. This granted Roberts some leeway, as it was expected that the strictness of the Pentecostal tradition may have impeded his rise in popularity. Before Roberts&#x27; switch to Methodism, Crutchfield arranged a meeting between Roberts and Bishop William Angie Smith, at which the Bishop told Roberts, &quot;We need you, but we need the Holy Spirit more than we need you and we&#x27;ve got to have the Holy Spirit in the Methodist Church.&quot; Roberts became an elder in the Oklahoma Conference of the United Methodist Church. From 1968 through 1987, Roberts was a member of the United Methodist Church&#x27;s ministry.

Roberts affected the American Protestant community. According to one authority in conservative Protestant culture, his ministry&#x27;s influence was second only to that of Billy Graham. His divine healing ministry called for prayer to heal the whole person—body, mind and spirit. Many labeled him a faith healer, but he rejected this with the comment: &quot;God heals—I don&#x27;t.&quot; He played a major role in bringing American Pentecostal Christianity into the mainstream. Even though Roberts was often associated with the prosperity gospel and the faith movement because of his close doctrinal and personal ties with Word-Faith teachers, his abundant life teachings did not fully identify him with that movement.

In 1977, Roberts claimed to have had a vision from a 900-foot-tall Jesus who told him to build City of Faith Medical and Research Center, and the hospital would be a success. In 1980, Roberts said he had a vision that encouraged him to continue the construction of his City of Faith Medical and Research Center in Oklahoma, which opened in 1981. At the time, it was among the largest health facilities of its kind in the world and was intended to merge prayer and medicine in the healing process. The City of Faith operated for eight years before closing in late 1989. The Orthopedic Hospital of Oklahoma still operates on its premises. In 1983 Roberts said Jesus had appeared to him in person and commissioned him to find a cure for cancer.

Roberts&#x27; fundraising was controversial. In January 1987, during a fundraising drive, Roberts announced to a television audience that unless he raised $8 million by that March, God would &quot;call him home.&quot; However, the year before on Easter he had told a gathering at the Dallas Convention Center that God had instructed him to raise the money &quot;by the end of the year&quot; or he would die. Regardless of this new March deadline and the fact that he was still $4.5 million short of his goal, some were fearful that he was referring to suicide, given the impassioned pleas and tears that accompanied his statement. Late in March 1987, while Roberts was fasting and praying in the Prayer Tower, Florida dog track owner Jerry Collins donated $1.3 million. Highly worried by what he perceived as Roberts threatening to starve himself, Collins said, &quot;I did it in order to save the guy from going to heaven in a hurry. It&#x27;s got nothing to do with religion. I&#x27;ve been a Baptist and a Methodist. I believe in religion and not just the church. You have to help one another.&quot; Altogether, Roberts raised a total of $9.1 million. Later that year, he announced that God had raised the dead through his ministry. Some of Roberts&#x27; fundraising letters were written by Gene Ewing, who headed a business writing donation letters for other evangelicals such as Don Stewart and Robert Tilton.

Roberts maintained his love of finery; one obituary claimed that even when times became economically hard, &quot;he continued to wear his Italian silk suits, diamond rings and gold bracelets—airbrushed out by his staff on publicity pictures&quot;.

He stirred up controversy when &quot;Time&quot; reported in 1987 that his son Richard Roberts claimed that he had seen his father raise a child from the dead. That year, the &quot;Bloom County&quot; comic strip recast its character Bill the Cat as a satirized televangelist, &quot;Fundamentally Oral Bill&quot;. In 1987, &quot;Time&quot; stated that he was &quot;re-emphasizing faith healing and [is] reaching for his old-time constituency.&quot; However, the income of his organization continued to decrease (from $88 million in 1980 to $55 million in 1986, according to the &quot;Tulsa Tribune&quot;) and his largely vacant City of Faith Medical Center continued to lose money.

Harry McNevin said that in 1988 the ORU Board of Regents &quot;rubber-stamped&quot; the &quot;use of millions in endowment money to buy a Beverly Hills property so that Oral Roberts could have a West Coast office and house.&quot; In addition, he said a country club membership was purchased for the Roberts&#x27; home. The lavish expenses led to McNevin&#x27;s resignation from the Board. In 1988, Oral Roberts and his son Richard were sued for $15 million in federal court by patients at City of Faith Medical Center, who claimed the two were frauds who did not visit or heal patients in the hospital.

His organizations were also affected by scandals involving other televangelists and the City of Faith hospital was forced to close in 1989 after losing money. Roberts was forced to respond with the sale of his holiday homes in Palm Springs and Beverly Hills as well as three of his Mercedes cars.

Richard Roberts resigned from the presidency of ORU on November 23, 2007, after being named as a defendant in a lawsuit alleging improper use of university funds for political and personal purposes, and improper use of university resources. The university was given a donation of $8 million by Hobby Lobby heir Mart Green, and although the lawsuit was still in process, the school submitted to an outside audit, and with a good report an additional $62 million was given by Green. Richard Roberts continued in his role as ORU chancellor, helping in the leadership of ORU along with Billy Joe Daugherty, who was named as the executive regent to assume administrative responsibilities of the Office of the President by the ORU Board of Regents. Richard Roberts continued as the ORU chancellor until his death, but in 2009, eleven months before his death, handed over the leadership of ORU to its incoming president, Mark Rutland.

The Oklahoma Senate adopted a resolution honoring the life of Oral Roberts, and he accepted this honor in 2009 at the age of 91, seven months before his death. The Oklahoma Association of Broadcasters (OAB) elected Roberts to the OAB Hall of Fame one month before his death.

==Personal life==
Roberts was married to Evelyn Lutman Fahnestock (1917–2005) for 66 years from December 25, 1938, until her death from a fall, at the age of 88, on May 4, 2005. Their daughter Rebecca Nash died with her husband, businessman Marshall Nash, in an airplane crash on February 11, 1977. Their elder son, Ronald Roberts, died by suicide on June 10, 1982, five months after receiving a court order to undergo counseling at a drug treatment center. The other two Roberts children are son Richard, an evangelist and former president of Oral Roberts University, and daughter Roberta Potts, an attorney.

Roberts died of complications from pneumonia on December 15, 2009, at the age of 91. He had been &quot;semi-retired&quot; and living in Newport Beach, California. He was interred next to his wife at the Memorial Park Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma (the same cemetery where T. L. Osborn would be interred nearly four years later).

According to a 1987 article in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot; by Martin Gardner, the &quot;most accurate and best documented biography&quot; is &quot;Oral Roberts: An American Life&quot;, an objective study by David Edwin Harrell Jr., a historian at Auburn University.

<doc id="268873" wikidata="Q254283" url="?curid=268873" title="Royal Swedish Opera">
<text>Royal Swedish Opera () is an opera and ballet company based in Stockholm, Sweden.

==Location and environment==
The building is located in the centre of Sweden&#x27;s capital, Stockholm, in the borough of Norrmalm, on the eastern side of Gustav Adolfs torg across from the former Arvfurstens Palats, now the Ministry for Foreign Affairs. It lies on the north side of the Norrström River and is connected to the Royal Palace through the Norrbro Bridge.

Other historically and architecturally important buildings in the close neighbourhood are the Sager House, the official residence of the Prime Minister of Sweden, and the Riksdag building.

==History==
The opera company was founded with the Royal Swedish Academy of Music by King Gustav III, and its first performance, &quot;Thetis and Phelée&quot; with Carl Stenborg and Elisabeth Olin, was given on 18 January 1773; this was the first native-speaking opera performed in Sweden.

However, the first opera house was not opened until 1782 and served for a century before being replaced at the end of the 19th century. Both houses are officially called the &quot;Royal Opera&quot;, although the terms &quot;The Gustavian Opera&quot; and &quot;The Oscarian Opera&quot; or the &quot;Old&quot; and &quot;New&quot; Opera are used when distinction is needed.

=== The Gustavian Opera ===
The original Stockholm Opera House, the work of architect Carl Fredrik Adelcrantz, was commissioned by King Gustav III, a strong adherent of the ideal of enlightened absolutism and, as such, was a great patron of the arts. The Swedish Opera Company had first been located in Bollhuset, but there was a need to separate the opera from the theatre and give them separate buildings. Construction began in 1775, and the theatre was inaugurated on 30 September 1782 with a performance of the German composer Johann Gottlieb Naumann&#x27;s &quot;Cora och Alonzo&quot;. It was also the place for public masquerade balls, events inspired by the famous opera balls in Paris, which were open for everyone wearing a mask at a cheap cost and somewhat ill-reputed. 
The building was very imposing, with its centre Corinthian tetrastyle portico supporting four statues and topped by the royal crown. The four-tiered auditorium was oval in shape and had excellent acoustics and sight lines. The sumptuous foyer contained neoclassic medallions and pilasters.

It was in the foyer of the opera house where the king met his fate: during a masquerade on 16 March 1792, he was shot by Jacob Johan Anckarström and died 13 days later. (In turn, this event inspired the operas &quot;Gustave III&quot; by Daniel Auber and &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; by Verdi.) Following the assassination, the opera house was closed until 1 November 1792, when it was opened again, which by some was considered shocking. The son of Gustav III, King Gustav IV Adolf of Sweden, did not like the opera, possibly because of the murder of his father, and disliked the fact that the scene of his father&#x27;s murder was used as a place of amusement and leisure, and when a frivolous play was performed for his queen Frederica of Baden in 1806, he decided to close it down. It remained closed until 1809, and when the king was deposed, it took until May 1812 before it was organised enough to be fully opened again.

=== The Oscarian Opera, &quot;Operan&quot; ===

The old opera was demolished in 1892 to give way to the construction of a new Opera drawn by Axel Johan Anderberg, which was finished seven years later and inaugurated by King Oscar II with a production of a Swedish opera (that tradition had been quite firmly established during the 19th century), Franz Berwald&#x27;s &quot;Estrella de Soria&quot;.

The new house had the letters &quot;Kungl. Teatern&quot;, literally &quot;Royal Theatre&quot; (which caused the later-founded Royal Dramatic Theatre to add the distinction &quot;dramatic&quot; to its name). The building is now simply called &quot;Operan&quot; (&quot;The Opera&quot;), written in golden letters above the middle arch on the front facade. It is a majestic neo-classical building with a magnificent gold foyer &quot;(Guldfoajén)&quot; and elegant marble grand staircase leading to a three-tiered auditorium somewhat smaller than the old theatre. It presently seats 1,200. Most productions are now sung in the original language (with Swedish subtitles), with only a few in Swedish.

The Royal Swedish Family of King Carl XVI Gustaf keeps the Royal Box reserved, located in the first tier in the auditorium above the orchestra pit.

== Ensembles, artists and artistic leadership ==

Famous singers who have been part of the opera&#x27;s ensemble have included Jussi Björling, Gösta Winbergh, Nicolai Gedda, Peter Mattei, Jenny Lind, Birgit Nilsson, Elisabeth Söderström, Fritz Arlberg, Anne Sofie von Otter, Katarina Dalayman and Nina Stemme.

The orchestra of the Royal Swedish Opera, the Royal Swedish Orchestra, &quot;Kungliga Hovkapellet&quot;, dates back to 1526. Royal housekeeping accounts from 1526 mention twelve musicians, including wind players and a timpanist, but no string players. Consequently, the Royal Swedish Orchestra is one of the oldest orchestras in Europe.

Armas Järnefelt was on the music staff from 1905, rising to become chief conductor between 1923–1933 and 1938–1946. The Royal Swedish Ballet, &quot;Kungliga Baletten&quot;, was founded by Gustav III of Sweden in 1773.

Past general managers of the Royal Swedish Opera have included Birgitta Svendén, who served in the post until her retirement in 2022. The current general manager of the company is Fredrik Lindgren, since 1 July 2022. 

In November 2020, the company announced the appointment of Michael Cavanagh as its next artistic director, effective in the summer of 2021, with an initial contract of 5 years. Cavanagh held the post until his death in March 2024. In August 2024, the company announced the appointment of Tobias Theorell as its next artistic director, effective in 2025.

Past titled conductors with the company have included Lawrence Renes, who held the post from 2012 through 2017. In January 2020, the company announced the appointment of Alan Gilbert as its next music director, effective in the spring of 2021. Gilbert had first guest-conducted with the company in 2012.

<doc id="268886" wikidata="Q227897" url="?curid=268886" title="Johann Bernoulli">
<text>Johann Bernoulli (also known as Jean in French or John in English; – 1 January 1748) was a Swiss mathematician and was one of the many prominent mathematicians in the Bernoulli family. He is known for his contributions to infinitesimal calculus and educating Leonhard Euler in the pupil&#x27;s youth.

==Biography==
===Early life===
Johann was born in Basel, the son of Nicolaus Bernoulli, an apothecary, and his wife, Margarethe Schongauer, and began studying medicine at University of Basel. His father desired that he study business so that he might take over the family spice trade, but Johann Bernoulli did not like business and convinced his father to allow him to study medicine instead. Johann Bernoulli began studying mathematics on the side with his older brother Jacob Bernoulli. Throughout Johann Bernoulli&#x27;s education at Basel University, the Bernoulli brothers worked together, spending much of their time studying the newly discovered infinitesimal calculus. They were among the first mathematicians to not only study and understand calculus but to apply it to various problems. In 1690, he completed a degree dissertation in medicine, reviewed by Leibniz, whose title was &quot;De Motu musculorum et de effervescent et fermentation&quot;.

===Adult life===
After graduating from Basel University, Johann Bernoulli moved to teach differential equations. Later, in 1694, he married Dorothea Falkner, the daughter of an alderman of Basel, and soon after accepted a position as the professor of mathematics at the University of Groningen. At the request of his father-in-law, Bernoulli began the voyage back to his home town of Basel in 1705. Just after setting out on the journey he learned of his brother&#x27;s death to tuberculosis. Bernoulli had planned on becoming the professor of Greek at Basel University upon returning but instead was able to take over as professor of mathematics, his older brother&#x27;s former position. As a student of Leibniz&#x27;s calculus, Bernoulli sided with him in 1713 in the Leibniz–Newton debate over who deserved credit for the discovery of calculus. Bernoulli defended Leibniz by showing that he had solved certain problems with his methods that Newton had failed to solve. Bernoulli also promoted Descartes&#x27; vortex theory over Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation. This ultimately delayed acceptance of Newton&#x27;s theory in continental Europe.
In 1724, Johann Bernoulli entered a competition sponsored by the French Académie Royale des Sciences, which posed the question:

:What are the laws according to which a perfectly hard body, put into motion, moves another body of the same nature either at rest or in motion, and which it encounters either in a vacuum or in a plenum?

In defending a view previously espoused by Leibniz, he found himself postulating an infinite external force required to make the body elastic by overcoming the infinite internal force making the body hard. In consequence, he was disqualified for the prize, which was won by Maclaurin. However, Bernoulli&#x27;s paper was subsequently accepted in 1726 when the Académie considered papers regarding elastic bodies, for which the prize was awarded to Pierre Mazière. Bernoulli received an honourable mention in both competitions.

===Disputes and controversy===
Although Johann and his brother Jacob Bernoulli worked together before Johann graduated from Basel University, shortly after this, the two developed a jealous and competitive relationship. Johann was jealous of Jacob&#x27;s position and the two often attempted to outdo each other. After Jacob&#x27;s death, Johann&#x27;s jealousy shifted toward his own talented son, Daniel. In 1738 the father–son duo nearly simultaneously published separate works on hydrodynamics. Johann attempted to take precedence over his son by purposely and falsely predating his work two years prior to his son&#x27;s.

The Bernoulli brothers often worked on the same problems, but not without friction. Their most bitter dispute concerned the brachistochrone curve problem, or the equation for the path followed by a particle from one point to another in the shortest amount of time, if the particle is acted upon by gravity alone. Johann presented the problem in 1696, offering a reward for its solution. Entering the challenge, Johann proposed the cycloid, the path of a point on a moving wheel, also pointing out the relation this curve bears to the path taken by a ray of light passing through layers of varied density. Jacob proposed the same solution, but Johann&#x27;s derivation of the solution was incorrect, and he presented his brother Jacob&#x27;s derivation as his own.

Bernoulli was hired by Guillaume de l&#x27;Hôpital for tutoring in mathematics. Bernoulli and l&#x27;Hôpital signed a contract which gave l&#x27;Hôpital the right to use Bernoulli&#x27;s discoveries as he pleased. L&#x27;Hôpital authored the first textbook on infinitesimal calculus, &quot;Analyse des Infiniment Petits pour l&#x27;Intelligence des Lignes Courbes&quot; in 1696, which mainly consisted of the work of Bernoulli, including what is now known as l&#x27;Hôpital&#x27;s rule. Subsequently, in letters to Leibniz, Varignon and others, Bernoulli complained that he had not received enough credit for his contributions, in spite of the preface of his book:

<text>Ulrich Molitor (also Molitoris) (c. 1442 – before 23 December 1507) was a lawyer who wrote a treatise offering qualified support, joined to clarifications and methodological critiques derived Canon Law, to the recent witch-phobic efforts by Heinrich Kramer represented in Krämer&#x27;s then-recently-published manual for the interrogation and prosecution of witchcraft &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; . 

Molitor maintains the tradition held in the Canon Episcopi that attendance of black masses in which Satan is adored and sexually worshipped are hallucinated episodes or dreams, but does not otherwise oppose or refute the existence of witchcraft. He counsels against the admission of confessions extracted by torture in court since this sort of testimony is often false. Molitor&#x27;s work, &quot;De Lamiis et Pythonicis Mulieribus&quot;, was first published in 1489, three years after the first edition of Kramer&#x27;s work, &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot;, and both books were reprinted frequently throughout the 1490s. Moliter was likely to have personally witnessed the inquisitions led by Heinrick Kramer in the diocese of Brixen and the diocese of Constance.

Molitor&#x27;s work is written in the form of a dialogue with Molitor&#x27;s position that of a skeptic in opposition to a witch-phobic fanatic (likely meant to represent Kramer). A third figure, Archduke Sigismund, acts as a wise arbiter. Molitor&#x27;s position is that of the ancient and long-held traditional Catholic law, the Canon Episcopi (906), that considered witchcraft an illusion. Molitor quotes the Bible, Church Fathers and poets and focusses on the devil&#x27;s ability to deceive. Sigismund in the dialogue is quick to dismiss evidence that was produced through the use of torture: &quot;For the fear of punishments incites men to say what is contrary to the nature of the facts&quot;. Sigismund had also experienced an inquisition led by Kramer in Innsbruck in 1485 and may have played a decisive role in shutting it down, thereby preventing seven accused women from being executed.

The density of illustrations, along with the conceit of a dramatic dialogue included in the work indicate that it was intended for popular consumption and not solely as a work of legal or juridical criticism.

<doc id="268904" wikidata="Q1185317" url="?curid=268904" title="Sham Shui Po">
<text>Sham Shui Po () is an area of Kowloon, Hong Kong, situated in the northwestern part of the Kowloon Peninsula, north of Tai Kok Tsui, east of Cheung Sha Wan and south of Shek Kip Mei (). It is located in and is the namesake of the Sham Shui Po District.

A predominately lower-income neighborhood, Sham Shui Po is one of the densest and most vibrant neighbourhoods in Hong Kong. It has a diverse mix of migrants from rural China, working-class families and seniors, with many living in cage homes, subdivided flats and public housing estates. Sham Shui Po has many lively street markets, electronics outlets, fabric stores, restaurants and food vendors. It is famous for Golden Computer Shopping Arcade for bargain electronics and accessories.

==History==
The discovery in 1955 of the Lei Cheng Uk Han Tomb indicates that as early as 2,000 years ago, there were Chinese people settled in what is now Sham Shui Po. Sham Shui Po means &quot;Deep Water Pier&quot; in Cantonese. At the time, the water in Sham Shui Po was deeper than the beach of Cheung Sha Wan to the northwest. It is close to the former peninsula of Tai Kok Tsui, the low ridge of which ends in Sham Shui Po.

At the time of the 1911 census, the population of Sham Shui Po was 1,577. The number of males was 1,028.

In the first stage, the town of Sham Shui Po was bounded by Yen Chow Street, Tung Chau Street, Wong Chuk Street, and Apliu Street. Part of the town was on reclamation land. The town was surrounded by the villages of , Tin Liu, and Tong Mei. A nullah along Nam Cheong Street was constructed to drain the water of rivers to the north and east (which explains the street&#x27;s wideness). The town was closed to Cosmopolitan Dock on the outer shore of Tai Kok Tsui.

Under Japanese occupation, a concentration camp was maintained here for most of the duration of the Second World War. An account of life by a British POW has been published as &quot;The Hard Way: Surviving Shamshuipo POW Camp 1941–45&quot; by Victor Stanley Ebbage (Spellmount, 2011).

==Land use==
As Sham Shui Po was one of the earliest developed areas in Hong Kong, it was once a commercial, industrial and transportation hub of the territory. As of 2003, Sham Shui Po is covered mainly by residential buildings, with public housing estates built on approximately of land. Factories and warehouses are still concentrated mainly in Cheung Sha Wan.

It is connected to the MTR rail network via the Sham Shui Po station on the Tsuen Wan line.

==Cityscape==
==Urban renewal==

Sham Shui Po is an area where urban decay is serious in Hong Kong, so the government is carrying out urban renewal projects.

In July 2003 the Hong Kong Housing Society (HKHS) announced that its first urban renewal project would be to improve the living environment at Po On Road/Wai Wai Road in Sham Shui Po. Covering an area of and affecting approximately 500 households, this project will provide 330 residential flats and some retail units. Government, institutional, and community facilities will also be erected for the community. This development will require the HKHS to acquire about 157 properties, costing an estimated HK$240 million. The total development cost of the project is about HK$720 million. To promote creative tourism in old Hong Kong districts of Wan Chai and Sham Shui Po Hong Kong Design Centre unveiled a budget of HK$60 million.

==Shopping==


The street market in Sham Shui Po is a hotspot for both locals and tourists.

The Apliu Street market is well known in Hong Kong for its electronics. The vendors in this open-air street market sell a wide variety of products at reasonable prices, allowing individuals to trade second-hand goods here. Different shops sell a variety of goods including industrial electronics, analogue and digital radio communications equipment, disco effects equipment, crockery, 1940s-era radios, LPs, torches, and audiophile hi-fi amplifiers in various stages of repair. The Hong Kong government promotes Apliu Street as Hong Kong&#x27;s answer to Akihabara (in Japan).

Golden Computer Centre is one of the major malls selling computer-related equipment (see next section).

The annual Hong Kong computer fair held in the streets of Sham Shui Po attracts a large crowd.

The market on Ki Lung Street is also famous for its fresh food and cheap prices. In the early 1990s, the Hong Kong government rebuilt the market and also added air conditioning.

There are numerous fashionwear wholesalers along Cheung Sha Wan Road. On weekends, some shops allow retail purchases, offering quality clothes at very affordable prices.

Nam Cheong Street and Ki Lung Street are most famous for their fabric stores, containing cloth, sash, ribbons and buttons.

===Golden Shopping Centre===
Once infamous for counterfeit software but today considered one of the cheapest places in Hong Kong to purchase a personal computer, the Golden Shopping Centre is a prominent IT shopping centre. Products range from complete systems, cell phones, to various peripherals. Unlike purely consumer-oriented IT shopping centres, Golden features several stores specializing in professional and esoteric network equipment.

The Golden Shopping Centre is also known for the number of video game stores it contains, where people purchase gaming systems, software and accessories at either a slightly discounted price, or in special in-store packages which might include an extra game or extra accessories. Since the halls are extremely narrow, it is often very congested, especially on weekends. The mall has two floors. The upper floor, Golden Computer Centre (), mainly sells games and gaming software, while the lower floor, Golden Computer Arcade (), focuses on the sales of computer-oriented hardware. They were originally fashion markets named &quot;Golden Shopping Centre&quot; and &quot;Golden Shopping Arcade&quot; respectively.

====Influence on Hong Kong&#x27;s Internet culture====

In the late 1990s, when the Internet started becoming popular, the shop owners of the Golden Computer Centre launched a website to post the prices of computer hardware and software. Later, a forum known as HKGolden was set up on the website, which later became one of the largest Internet forums in Hong Kong.

===Dragon Centre===

Dragon Centre is a nine-storey shopping centre. It was the largest shopping centre in West Kowloon until Elements opened its doors above the Kowloon MTR station.

== Local Delicacies ==
As Sham Shui Po is usually regarded as one of the poorest and oldest districts in Hong Kong, it is well known for people to find cheap and local food in Sham Shui Po. A lot of local restaurants are located in Fuk Wa Street, Fuk Wing Street, Pei Ho Street and Kweilin Street. Some of the famous restaurants include Kung Wo Beancurd Factory, Wai Kee Noodle Cafe, Man Kee Cart Noodle and Kwan Kee Store, which are highly praised for their soy milk and pudding, pork liver noodles, cart noodles and traditional puddings respectively.

<text>Kwun Tong is an area in the Kwun Tong District of Hong Kong, situated at the eastern part of the Kowloon Peninsula, and its boundary stretches from Lion Rock in the north to Lei Yue Mun in the south, and from the winding paths of Kowloon Peak in the east to the north coast of the former Kai Tak Airport runway in the west.

One of the first new towns in Hong Kong, Kwun Tong was, and remains, a major industrial area. Its population has been growing rapidly, and the demand for housing, medical and educational facilities and services has been increasing. In view of this, a number of community development projects, such as the redevelopment of old housing estates and the construction of major parks, have been implemented in recent years. These projects have incorporated a wide range of supporting facilities, like primary and secondary schools, clinics, community centres and open spaces. All these facilities have brought about a new face to the Kwun Tong District, making it a more comfortable place for the people to live.

==History==

The Chinese name of Kwun Tong (&quot;) was formerly written as &quot;&quot; (transcribed as &quot;Koon Tong&quot; in Cantonese Yale). Despite the identical pronunciation of these two names in Cantonese, they have different meanings. &quot;&quot; literally means Mandarin Pond, which was allegedly named after the Koon Fu salt yards () set up by the government to secure central administration of the salt trade and prevent unauthorised salt preparation and trading in the Song dynasty. In those days, there were many salt yards in and around Kwun Tong, whose long coastline stretched to as far as Kowloon Bay and To Kwa Wan in the west. Koon Fu salt yards was one of the four largest salt beds in Dongguan province, and was a site of high political significance.

Since the Song Dynasty, troops were stationed there to monitor the salt yards&#x27; operation. Despite the government&#x27;s close watch, illegal salt trade was still active on Lantau Island. When officials tried to tax salt production on the island, in 1197 Lantau Salt farmers instigated a riot to revolt against them. Government authorities ordered Koon Fu administrators to take control, troops were deployed to the island for a full-scale crackdown, resulting in the massacre of many islanders.

Antiques and coins traced back to Northern Song Dynasty and Southern Song Dynasty were discovered in neighbouring Kowloon City district and Wong Tai Sin. Similar coins were also unearthed along the coast of Kwun Tong starting from Kowloon Bay, suggesting that Kwun Tong has already been a relatively prosperous area since then.

According to other stories, Kwun Tong was a typhoon shelter for the Kowloon Water Police, which made it an important political and defence point of south-eastern Kowloon. Black Hill (Ng Kwai Shan), which today rises up behind Lam Tin Estate, was known as Koon Fu Hill () at that time.

During the Great Clearance in the Qing Dynasty, coastal residents were forced to evacuate inland 50 li (roughly equivalent to 25 Km) to quell support for the anti-Qing loyalists in Taiwan. This caused the salt farms in Kwun Tong to be abandoned. When the ban was lifted in 1669, many of the original inhabitants did not return, re-settlers who came from agricultural backgrounds soon took over, leading to the vanishing of the salt industry in Kwun Tong. 

In the 1950s, when Kwun Tong was being developed as a satellite town, the local residents disliked the word &quot;Koon&quot; (), which literally means &quot;official&quot; or &quot;government&quot;, and they persuaded the Hong Kong government to change the place name to Kwun Tong (, ). The development of Kwun Tong spearheaded the construction and planning of new towns in the New Territories, although the first project was limited in scope and did not share the features of self-contained communities like the later ones.

==Features==

===Industrial area===
Kwun Tong was one of the first and major industrial areas in Hong Kong, with factories having been built there since the 1950s. The industrial area has since then expanded to Kowloon Bay and Yau Tong. Since the manufacturing sector of Hong Kong is in decline, many factories have been torn down and commercial buildings are being constructed to replace them.

In recent years, the government has started to re-develop the coastal area of Kwun Tong to correspond with the re-development of the Kai Tak district. A promenade and a park has been built along the coast near Kwun Tong Pier.

<text>Yuen Long District (formerly Un Long) is one of the districts of Hong Kong. Located in the northwest of the New Territories, it had a population of 662,000 in 2021.

==Geography==

Yuen Long District contains the largest alluvial plain in Hong Kong, the Yuen Long-Kam Tin plain. With an area of 144 km2 (56 square miles), the district covers many traditional villages including Ping Shan Heung, Ha Tsuen Heung, Kam Tin Heung, Fung Kat Heung, Pat Heung, San Tin Heung and Shap Pat Heung, as well as Yuen Long Town and Tin Shui Wai.

Two new towns have been developed within this district. Yuen Long New Town was developed from the traditional market town of Yuen Long Town from the late 1970s. Tin Shui Wai New Town has developed since the early 1990s and is built on land reclaimed from former fish ponds once common in the district.

==History==
According to archaeological findings, there were inhabitants settled in the district around 3,500 years ago. The ruling clan of the Tang Clan () lived there in Kam Tin. Like Tai Po, Yuen Long used to be a traditional market town.

In 1898 the area of the modern day Yuen Long District was leased to the colonial British Hong Kong government by the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory. A 6 days war was broke out between the British army and the militia from Tang and other villages. The iron doors of the walled villages of Tang were looted to UK as spoils of war. They are returned to Tang later, but according to urban legends, the mixed up which doors belongs to which walled villages, nowadays the two sides of the door of Kat Hing Wai are not identical in design.

After the war, the colonial government had established a different approach to administrate the New Territories, which established the district office. Yuen Long was under the District Office North headquartered in Tai Po. A branch office was later stationed in Yuen Long permanently.

The history of the modern day Yuen Long administrative district (despite a few government departments does not map their service area according to the boundary of the District) can be trace back to Yuen Long District Office (previously known as now known as of Home Affairs Department; English name unchanged) of the &quot;New Territories Administration&quot; department of the British colonial government. A reform was held in 1980s that not only the New Territories has their District Offices, but whole HK is grid into Districts, with formal election was held for the councillors of the District Councils. The latest election of the Yuen Long District Council was held in 2019 and scheduled to be held again in 2023.

==Culture==

===Special festivals===
The Tin Hau Festival () is on the 23rd of the third month of the lunar calendar. It celebrates the birth of a local deity, Tin Hau. During the day, residents from various walled villages set off at Fung Cheung Road, go via Kau Yuk Road and the Yuen Long Stadium, and end at Tai Shu Ha Tin Hau Temple, which has a 300-year history.

===Cuisine===

==Popular scenic spots==

===Hong Kong Wetland Park===

Hong Kong Wetland Park () is located at the northern part of Tin Shui Wai. It was intended to be an ecological mitigation area (EMA) for the wetlands lost due to Tin Shui Wai New Town development. In 1998, a project named as &quot;International Wetland Park and Visitor Centre Feasibility Study&quot; was initiated by the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department and the Hong Kong Tourism Board with a view to expanding the EMA to a wetland ecotourism attraction. After concluding that it was feasible to develop a wetland park at the EMA site without compromising its intended ecological mitigation functions and the development of the Wetland Park will also enhance the ecological function of the EMA to a world-class conservation, education and tourism facility, the concerned parties started the Wetland Park Project, which is regarded as one of the Millennium projects by the Administrations.

===Kat Hing Wai===

Kat Hing Wai () in Kam Tin is one of the Yuen Long&#x27;s best-known walled villages. It is the ancestral home of the Tangs, one of the &quot;Five Great Clans&quot; in the territory. Built by the Tangs 500 years ago, it is a rectangular walled village with an area of 100 metres by 90 metres. As a family stronghold, Kat Hing Wai has served the Tangs well through centuries. In the Qing Dynasty, a five-metre high blue brick wall and four cannon towers were added to fend off bandits.

Tai Lam Country Park sits in the western New Territories with an area of 54 km2. Tai Lam has a small area of porphyry in the northeast; for the remaining area, it is composed of highly erodible decomposed granite. In 1952, afforestation started as a measure to protect the water catchment area.

In addition, the plantations also offer a good habitat for birds, pangolins, Chinese leopard cat, and barking deer. Nevertheless, Tai Lam is an excellent place for outdoor activities because of its remoteness.

<text>Tai Po District is one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong. The suburban district covers the areas of Tai Po New Town (including areas such as Tai Po Market, , Tai Po Industrial Estate, Tai Wo Estate), Tai Po Tau, Tai Po Kau, Hong Lok Yuen, Ting Kok, Plover Cove, Lam Tsuen Valley, Tai Mei Tuk and other surrounding areas, and its exclaves Sai Kung North, in the northern part of the Sai Kung Peninsula and including islands such as Grass Island (Tap Mun), and Ping Chau (Tung Ping Chau). Tai Po proper and Sai Kung North are divided by the Tolo Channel and the Tolo Harbour (Tai Po Hoi). The district is located in the Eastern New Territories. The &quot;de facto&quot; administrative centre of the district is Tai Po New Town.

Like Yuen Long, the area of Tai Po used to be a traditional market town. Tai Po New Town, a satellite town, developed around the area of Tai Po and on reclaimed land on the estuaries of Lam Tsuen and Tai Po rivers. It had a population of 310,879 in 2001. The district has the third lowest population density in Hong Kong.
==History==

The district is named after Tai Po. Tai Po&#x27;s population dates back to the eleventh century, people would make sufficient money by clamming, pearl harvesting, and fishing. In Yuen Chau Tsai, stone axe and pottery have been discovered which were believed to be made in Neolithic era.

Tai Po was the seat of the district officers that oversaw the whole of the New Territories with Island House as their official residence. The Island House was completed in 1906, 8 years after the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory. The New Territories was later split into the District North and South (Not to be confused with modern-day Northern District and Southern District of Hong Kong), as well as New Kowloon in 1937. Tai Po remained as the headquarters of the District North after the split. The old headquarters of the District is a declared monument currently. The District North and then further shrunk, which Sha Tin District, Yuen Long District (includes modern-day Tuen Mun) and the modern-day Northern District were split from the District North and District North was renamed Tai Po District, which oversaw Tai Po and nearby Lam Tsuen Valley, as well as an exclave on the northern part of the Sai Kung Peninsula. The seats of the Tai Po District branch of the Home Affairs Department as well as the Tai Po District Officer, are currently located in another government building, Tai Po Government Offices Building, in Ting Kok Road, in the northern shore of Lam Tsuen River.

The Tai Po District Council was formed as the Tai Po District Board in the 1980s, with elections held since that decade.

==Geography==
Lam Tsuen River Tai Po is located in the north of Hong Kong, northeast of Sha Tin. Even though the Tai Po Industrial Estate is located in the district, it is still one of the most unpolluted districts in Hong Kong. Tai Po&#x27;s population density is considerably lower than Kowloon&#x27;s, having many old, small villages in the mountains.

Tai Po is surrounded by fertile valleys which explains why it has held such a population for over a millennium. Tai Po is covered with bicycle tracks, east of Lam Tsuen Valley and west of Tolo Harbour. East Rail line is the main connection of Tai Po to the rest of Hong Kong.

Tai Po has 460 hectares of purely woodland area, the largest in Hong Kong.

===Climate===
==Housing==
Because Hong Kong is in a very densely populated region, Tai Po Town has copied the many urban areas of Hong Kong by building high-rise apartments. 320,000 people have residences in the town, making high-rise apartments necessary and mandatory. These high-rise apartments are located inside estates, such as Tai Yuen Estates and Fu Heng Estates. These high-rise apartments have floors ranging from the low apartments in Tai Po Old Town to the new estates in northern Tai Po ranging from 20 to 34 levels. The area is serviced by the Tai Po Hui Market, Built in 2004.

The Tai Po area also has many &quot;village houses&quot;, resulting from a 1972 Hong Kong legislation which gave any male heir over the age of 18 who could prove he was descended from one of Hong Kong&#x27;s original villages in 1898 the right to build a small house on a plot of land, either owned by the village itself or on leased government land. These houses are restricted by law to be no more than three stories and in height, and no more than in total floor space.

There are also a few private housing developments in the Tai Po area with &quot;detached&quot; and &quot;semi-detached&quot; houses which include communal recreational areas such as swimming pools, tennis courts, and children&#x27;s playgrounds, and entertainment facilities such as private cinemas, health spas and karaoke rooms. These developments are excluded from the &quot;village house&quot; law, and therefore units are often much larger than .

Privately owned residential housing in Tai Po included Tai Po Centre, Plover Cove Garden, Uptown Plaza, The Beverly Hills, and many other residential estates.

==Transportation==


===Buses===
Transportation in Tai Po Town is much like any other place in Hong Kong. Due to the high population, Hong Kong has double-decker buses. Some buses lead to the rest of Hong Kong such as the KMB bus route 271 that goes from Fu Heng Estate in Tai Po Town to West Kowloon Station in Tsim Sha Tsui and bus route 307 which goes from Central Tai Po Town towards the Central Ferry Piers via Central and Wan Chai of Victoria. Some buses lead directly to the airport such as A47X from Tai Po (Fu Heng) to Hong Kong Airport and E41 from Tai Po Centre (Tai Po Plaza and Tai Po Mega Mall) to Hong Kong International Airport within 90 minutes.

=== Railway ===
Two railway stations along the East Rail line serve Tai Po, namely: Tai Po Market station (in the older district) and Tai Wo station (serving newer estates). Trains originate at the Hong Kong-Chinese border, at either Lo Wu or Lok Ma Chau stations, and travel south to Admiralty station in Hong Kong Island, passing through Tai Po on the way.

The railway, previously known as the KCR British Section, opened in 1910. The old Tai Po Market station opened on that date and was closed in 1983 when the modern station of the same name opened as part of an upgrading of the line by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation. Tai Wo station opened in 1989. In 2007 the line was leased for 50 years to the MTR Corporation.

Tai Po Kau station served the Tai Po Kau area between 1910 and 1983. It has since been demolished.

==Education==

Tai Po District is roughly divided into two primary school districts. The 84 school district for Tai Po New Town and surrounding villages, while Sai Kung North belongs to the 95 school district; the Sai Kung District also belongs to the 95 school district.

As of 2018, there were 19 secondary schools in the whole Tai Po District, all located in the Tai Po New Town. The secondary school district of Tai Po District was designated &quot;NET NT6&quot;.

Several international schools are located in the Tai Po District. They do not belong to any school district. The Tai Po campus of Hong Kong Japanese School&#x27;s International Section was opened in 1997. American School Hong Kong was scheduled to open in Tai Po in 2016. Norwegian International School occupied a building formerly known as The Tai Po Bungalow as a campus.

Li Po Chun United World College, located in Ma On Shan of the Sha Tin district, is near the border of the Sai Kung North exclave of the Tai Po district.

The campus of the Education University of Hong Kong, formerly the Hong Kong Institute of Education (HKIED), is located in the Tai Po District since 1997. The institute gained university status in 2016. The campus is located just north of Tai Po Industrial Estate. It is the only university in the district.

The Chinese University of Hong Kong is located on the border between Tai Po and Sha Tin districts.

==Sports==

* Tai Po Sports Ground, an outdoor track and field ground, owned by the government and operated by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department (LSCD)
* Tai Po Swimming Pool, an outdoor swimming pool next to the sports ground, owned by the government and operated by the LSCD

The government leased a government land to the Tai Po Sports Association in 1988, to run another public swimming pool. The swimming pool, which is also known as the &quot;Jockey Club swimming pool&quot;, was closed in 1999. A new swimming pool structure was planned to build. However, the construction was not yet finished, as of 2015.

The district had several sports complexes for the local population, they were owned and operated by the government and located in the Tai Po New Town. Another facility opened in 1983, Li Fook Lam Indoor Sports Centre, was operated by the Tai Po Sports Association Limited, a non-profit making limited company.

===Football===
Tai Po FC is the first district football team ever to make it to the Hong Kong First Division League among the 19 district football sides from the Hong Kong Third District Division League. The club plays its home games at Tai Po Sports Ground and has since won the 2008-09 Hong Kong FA Cup.

The district had several football fields (five-a-side, seven-a-side football) for amateur football. In 2016, another football field and sports complex (which includes an indoor swimming pool) would be built.

==Economy==
Hong Kong Note Printing, which prints all the bank notes in Hong Kong, is located in the Tai Po Industrial Estate, an industrial area of light industries (food processing, printing, etc.)

Hong Kong and China Gas also has its major gas plant in the industrial estate, which supplies most (98%) of the town gas of the city from that plant.

===Spa Resort Development===
There is a plan to develop a spa hotel resort at Ting Kok, near Tai Mei Tuk. The site will occupy 61,000 sq m and has no more than 230 hotel rooms. Tai Po District councilor Yam Kai-Kong admits the benefits from tourism and job opportunities will be good but he is also concerned about the mangroves and increased traffic in the area.

* Tai Po Waterfront Park
* Tsz Shan Monastery

Notable people:

==Electoral subdivisions==
The local council of the district, Tai Po District Council, was divided into several subdivisions, known as electoral constituencies. However, the border of those electoral constituencies would under review in each election. It was also accused of gerrymandering for the proposed change of the border for several constituencies in the district for the 2019 election.

In the election of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong, Tai Po District belongs to the cross-district electoral constituency New Territories East.

In the past, Tai Po District belonged to the Regional Council, the middle-tier local government between the city&#x27;s Legislative Council and the district councils. The Regional Council oversees the New Territories, while its counterpart, Urban Council, oversees Kowloon (including New Kowloon) and the Hong Kong Island. However, they were abolished. The executive function of the Regional Council was a takeover by the Leisure and Cultural Services Department and other government departments.

Before the establishment of the Tai Po District, the area belonged to the District Office North (founded as the District Office which also oversees the area around modern-day Sha Tin), which its headquarter is located in Tai Po; the District Officer was also resided in Tai Po in the Island House on Yuen Chau Tsai.

The election for the village head, as well as councilors of Heung Yee Kuk, has its own electoral constituencies, which are based on the boundary of the villages.

<text>Mastema ( &quot;Masṭēmā&quot;; &quot;Mesetēma&quot;), Mastemat, or Mansemat, is an angel or evil angel in the Book of Jubilees. He first appears in the literature of the Second Temple Period as a personification of the Hebrew word &quot;mastemah&quot; (מַשְׂטֵמָה), meaning &quot;hatred&quot;, &quot;hostility&quot;, &quot;enmity&quot;, or &quot;persecution&quot;.

In the Book of Jubilees, Mastema requests hosts of demons, the spirits of the Nephilim, from God in order to tempt and corrupt humanity. He appears to various prophets and puts them to the test. Throughout the work, Mastema substitutes evil actions attributed to Yahweh in the Torah and abolishes the Godhead of the Hebrew tradition from malice. Nevertheless, Mastema remains subordinative to the Godhead.

==Book of Jubilees==
According to the Book of Jubilees, Mastema (&quot;hostility&quot;) is the chief of the Nephilim, the demons engendered by the fallen angels called Watchers with human women.

Although leading a group of demons, the text implies that he is an angel working for God instead, as he does not fear imprisonment along with the Nephilim. Yet, the matter is blurred because angels and other kinds of spirits are not clearly differentiated in the work.

His function is similar to Satan in the Book of Job, as a servant of God. Another devilish entity, Beliar, is mentioned twice in Jubilees, and probably identical with Mastema.

=== The story ===
According to the Book of Jubilees, a retelling of Book of Genesis and Book of Exodus, Mastema requests permission from God to spare some of the giants (demons) and put them under his control (Jubilees 10:8). In Jubilees 11:10, Mastema is behind the birds mentioned in Genesis 15:11. At the time of Terah, Mastema sends ravens to eat devour the seeds from the fields. It is Mastema who initiates the binding of Isaac and by that, substitutes Yahweh. Likewise, not Yahweh but Mastema hardens the Pharaoh&#x27;s heart (Jub. 48:15–17).

The account of Zipporah at the Inn where Yahweh meets Moses and tries to kill him is retold in a way that attributes the attack to Mastema instead (Jubilees 48:1-3). Mastema is also said to have been chained while the Israelites left Egypt, but then let go to encourage the Egyptians to chase after the Israelites and so come to their doom in the Red Sea. The deaths of the firstborn of the Egyptians are attributed to &quot;all the powers of Mastema&quot;. Mastema is also behind the powers of the Pharaoh&#x27;s sorcerers.

=== Historical perspectives ===
The figure Mastema might be a step in the development of the concept of the Devil as independent from God, during the Second Temple period. By substituting Yahweh&#x27;s malevolent role throughout the Torah by one of his angels, God is abolished from evil actions. Yet, the authors of the Book of Jubilees assert that ultimately, evil is caused by God, as it is God who explicitly grands Mastema hosts of demons. Accordingly, God allows evil to exist, but only for a limited period of time, without committing evil himself.

Although a prince of evil, Mastema never actually harms any of God&#x27;s servants. Whenever Mastema acts, it is only by God&#x27;s permission or Mastema is immediately restraint. In cases when harm actually befalls God&#x27;s people, Mastema is not associated with the act. Mastema and his demons only succeed when they attack a non-Jewish nation. Throughout the Book of Jubilees, God&#x27;s loyalty for the people of Israel remains unshaken. Mastema might be understood as a figure of evil befalling the non-Jewish nations. As such, the text inverts the audience&#x27;s expectations by nullifying the power of the agent of evil as long as they stay loyal to the Jewish tradition.

There are no parallel stories to that of Mastema and Abraham in later Jewish traditions. However, parallels are found between Mastema and Nimrod in Muḥammad al-Kisāʾī&#x27;s &quot;Qisas al-Anbiya&quot;. In the Quran, Mastema&#x27;s function is reflected in the figure Iblis, who likewise requests God to tempt humanity and receives hosts of demons in order to do so, and is subordinative to God, unable to harm God&#x27;s servants.

== Dead Sea Scrolls ==
The name appears in the Dead Sea Scrolls. In the Zadokite Fragments, the expression &quot;angel of mastema&quot; (&quot;mal&#x27;ak ha-mastema&quot;) occurs. Given the definite article ha- indicates that &quot;mastema&quot; is not a proper name here. The &quot;Serek ha-yahad&quot; declares that God: &quot;made Belial for the pit, an angel of mastema; and in dark[ness is] his [rule] and in his counsel is to bring wickedness and guilt about; and all the spirits of his lot are angels of destruction; they walk in the statutes of darkness.&quot; It is unclear if it is meant to refer to a type of angel that Belial is or a proper name.

==In fiction==
*In Anne Rice&#x27;s 1999 novel &quot;Vittorio the Vampire&quot;, Mastema is an angel that aids the main character in attacking a vampire coven.
*In the &quot;Megami Tensei&quot; series of video games and its spin-offs, Mastema is portrayed as a demon, although, within the context of the franchise, the term &quot;demon&quot; is used in its classical meaning (cf. &quot;daemon&quot;) to refer to any supernatural creature. Mastema can be fought but can also join the player&#x27;s group. In &quot;Strange Journey&quot;, Mastema represents the Law alignment and plays a significant role within the game.
*In the Digimon game, Digimon Story: Cyber Sleuth, Mastemon is an Angel Digimon who manipulates light and darkness, and has the power to cross through space-time.
*In the Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card game, the card &quot;Darklord Nasten&quot; (堕天使マスティマ, &quot;datenshi [= Fallen Angel] Mastema&quot;) is based on this demon.
*In the comic book &quot;Birthright&quot;, Mastema is the name of one of the mages living on Earth that maintain the barrier between worlds. She is revealed shortly after her introduction to be the daughter of the series&#x27; main villain.
*In the mobile game &quot;Arknights&quot;, Mostima is the name of an operator that has angelic and demonic qualities.
*In the Korean MMORPG &quot;MapleStory&quot;, Mastema (마스테마) is the name of the devout follower of the playable class &quot;Demon&quot;, and it can transform into a purple cat to conceal its power.

<text>Tsuen Wan District is one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong. It is located in the New Territories and is served by the Tsuen Wan line of the MTR metro system. Its area is 60.7 km2. Its residents, who mostly live in Tsuen Wan Town, enjoy the highest income in the New Territories.

Part of the Tsuen Wan New Town is located in the Tsuen Wan District. An exclave of the district is located on the island of Ma Wan and the northeastern part of Lantau island (including Tsing Chau Tsai Peninsula and Yam O).

The Hong Kong Disneyland Resort is within the boundary of Tsuen Wan District (and partially in the neighbouring Islands District).
==History==
The district was set up in 1982 covering the present-day Tsuen Wan District and Kwai Tsing District. Kwai Chung and the island of Tsing Yi were split from Tsuen Wan District in the mid-1980s, and subsequently formed a new district known as Kwai Tsing.

==Sights==
The Sam Tung Uk Museum is a cultural and agricultural museum and was set up in a former Hakka walled village. Behind Tsuen Wan is Shing Mun reservoir, a valley that was once home to 10 villages that grew mostly pineapples. The dam that stops the reservoir is called Po Lo Pa, lit. &quot;pineapple dam&quot;. There were once disputes and fights among the Shing Mun Valley dwellers and Tsuen Wan residents during the 18th century, over the levying of taxes for pineapple sales. The reservoir valley also has a disused lead mine, where some of the residents of Tsuen Wan used to work. Behind this is Tai Mo Shan, the tallest hill in Hong Kong.

<text>Sha Tin District is one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong. As one of the 9 districts located in the New Territories, it covers the areas of Sha Tin, Tai Wai, Ma On Shan, Fo Tan, Siu Lek Yuen, and Ma Liu Shui. The district is the most populous district in Hong Kong, with a population of 659,794 as per 2016 by-census, having a larger population than many states or dependencies including Iceland, Malta, Montenegro and Brunei.

The Sha Tin District covers approximately 69.4 km2 (26.8 sq. mi), including Sha Tin New Town and several country parks. Built mostly on reclaimed land in Sha Tin Hoi, the well-developed Sha Tin New Town comprises mainly residential areas along the banks of the Shing Mun River Channel. In the early 1970s it was a rural township of about 30,000 people. After Sha Tin&#x27;s first public housing estate, Lek Yuen Estate, was completed in 1976, the settlement began to expand. Today, about 65% of the district&#x27;s population live in public rental housing, housing under Hong Kong&#x27;s Tenants Purchase Scheme, or Home Ownership Scheme.
== History ==
=== Pre-colonial Era ===
According to archeological discoveries, there were inhabitants settled in the region around four thousand years ago.
Sha Tin was formerly named Lek Yuen, literally meaning the &quot;source of trickling&quot; or &quot;source of clear water&quot;. The area of the present day Sha Tin was populated before the Ming Dynasty. As the Shing Mun River runs across the district, most local residents were farmers and relied on agriculture for living. In 1579, Tai Wai Village, the oldest and largest walled village in the district was built. Several other villages were built along the river after Tai Wai Village.

=== Colonial Era ===
Sha Tin started to be administered by the British Hong Kong government after the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory was signed. The establishment of the Sha Tin station of the Kowloon-Canton Railway (British Section) in 1910 caused Sha Tin to be the more common name for the area, replacing Lek Yuen ever since.

Sha Tin was a former market town at the present location of Sha Tin Centre Street and New Town Plaza shopping centre.

Sha Tin Town was the second batch of satellite towns, or new towns, to be built in the New Territories, on land reclaimed from the sea.

==Land use==
In addition to the residential areas, there are four industrial areas for light industries: Tai Wai, Fo Tan, Siu Lek Yuen and Shek Mun.

The Chinese University of Hong Kong is also located in Sha Tin. People typically travel there via the MTR East Rail line and get off at University station. A minibus service operates on campus.

Sha Tin is the location for Hong Kong&#x27;s second equestrian racecourse (the first and most famous being Happy Valley Racecourse) which has a capacity of 85,000. This course hosted the equestrian events during the 2008 Summer Olympics. The Olympics were hosted by Beijing, but there was concern over proper quarantine and disease monitoring in the Chinese capital.

Penfold Park is located inside the racecourse and closed on race days. It is best accessed via the Fo Tan station. Sha Tin Park is another major park located in Sha Tin.

==Shing Mun River==

The Shing Mun River is a 7 km long, 200m wide channel originating at the Shing Mun Reservoir (Tai Mo Shan catchment) that runs as a river from the Tai Wai area, through the Sha Tin town centre to Tide Cove. It has three main tributaries, namely Tai Wai Nullah, Fo Tan Nullah and Siu Lek Yuen Nullah. Along the Shing Mun River are high-rise residential, commercial and industrial buildings with numerous village type developments scattered around.

==Transportation==
===Railways===

Sha Tin District is served by a total of fourteen rapid transit stations on two lines of the MTR railway network, the most of any district in Hong Kong. Five of these stations lie on the East Rail line, namely Tai Wai, Sha Tin, Fo Tan, Racecourse and University. Although all except Racecourse station (which only has service on race days) lie on the original Kowloon–Canton Railway, the oldest in the territory, only Sha Tin station existed at the time the line was inaugurated in 1910, providing direct service to Hung Hom station in Kowloon in the south and the mainland border crossings at Lo Wu and Lok Ma Chau in the north. The other four stations were added later, mostly during the electrification of the line in the 1980s, as a result of the development of the Chinese University, Sha Tin Racecourse, and Sha Tin New Town.

The Ma On Shan line, a branch of the East Rail line, began service in December 2004, serving the eastern parts of Sha Tin and the Ma On Shan area. Its nine stations, running between Tai Wai and Wu Kai Sha, were all located within Sha Tin District, and served newly built housing estates along the route. The only interchange between this line and the rest of the network was at Tai Wai, leading to extreme congestion on the East Rail line between this station and Kowloon Tong, which has a connection to the Kwun Tong line. Both this line and the East Rail line were operated by the Kowloon-Canton Railway Corporation until they were absorbed by the MTR Corporation in 2007.

Railway connectivity to and from Sha Tin District is expected to be significantly improved following the completion of the Sha Tin to Central Link, which will see extensions to both the East Rail and Ma On Shan lines. The first section, known as Tuen Ma line Phase 1, opened in January 2020, extending the Ma On Shan line to Kai Tak via Diamond Hill, and includes a further station serving Hin Keng at the southern end of Sha Tin District. This is expected to relieve congestion on the East Rail line between Tai Wai and Kowloon Tong. By the end of 2021, the full Tuen Ma line would open with a new route through Kowloon City, merging with the West Rail line at Hung Hom and continuing to the northwestern New Territories via western Kowloon. Finally, in 2022, the East Rail line would be extended across Victoria Harbour and terminate at Admiralty station, providing a direct service to Hong Kong Island for the first time.

===Buses===

A total of 110 franchised bus routes serve various points in Sha Tin District. These are predominantly operated by Kowloon Motor Bus, which has a depot in Siu Lek Yuen. They include a combination of routes entirely within the district, routes connecting the district to other parts of the New Territories and Kowloon, and several cross-harbour routes to Hong Kong Island, including one as far as Aberdeen. Furthermore, Long Win Bus operates several routes to Lantau Island, the airport, and the Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge, while New World First Bus has express bus service to eastern Hong Kong Island and Tseung Kwan O.

The district is also served by various public light bus routes.

===Roads===
Sha Tin District is served by an extensive road network. Four trunk routes on Hong Kong&#x27;s strategic route network pass through the district:
*Route 1 between Fo Tan and Aberdeen via Kowloon Tong, Hung Hom, and Wan Chai.
*Route 2 between Ma Liu Shui and Quarry Bay via Diamond Hill and Kwun Tong.
*Route 8 between Tai Wai and Hong Kong International Airport via Lai Chi Kok, Tsing Yi, and Lantau Island.
*Route 9 to Tsuen Wan, Tuen Mun, Yuen Long, Fanling, and Tai Po.

These trunk roads make use of several road tunnels leading to the district. Of these, the Lion Rock Tunnel used by Route 1, is the oldest, having opened in 1967 to replace the overcrowded Tai Po Road to Sham Shui Po. Despite the opening of further tunnels over the years, it remains the most direct route to central Kowloon, and thus the most heavily travelled. The Lion Rock Tunnel was followed by the Shing Mun Tunnels on Route 9 in 1990, the Tate&#x27;s Cairn Tunnel on Route 2 in 1991, and most recently the Tsing Sha Highway on Route 8 (consisting of the Eagle&#x27;s Nest Tunnel and Sha Tin Heights Tunnel) in 2008.

Other major roads in the area include Sha Lek Highway linking central Sha Tin to Ma On Shan, Sha Tin Road linking eastern Sha Tin to Fo Tan, Tate&#x27;s Cairn Highway linking eastern Sha Tin to Ma Liu Shui, Tolo Highway linking Sha Tin to the northern districts, and Sai Sha Road linking Ma On Shan to Sai Kung.

A network of cycle tracks throughout Sha Tin measures about 50 km long and is the longest cycle track network in Hong Kong.

<text>Sai Kung District is one of the 18 districts of Hong Kong. The district comprises the southern half of the Sai Kung Peninsula, the Clear Water Bay Peninsula in the New Territories and a strip of land to the east of Kowloon. Areas in the district include Sai Kung Town, Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark, Tseung Kwan O and over 70 islands of different sizes. The administrative centre had been located in Sai Kung Town until the Sai Kung District Office was relocated to Tseung Kwan O recently. The district&#x27;s population is concentrated in Tseung Kwan O, as of 2011. In 2011, the district was the third youngest district, with a median age of 39.3. Known as the &quot;back garden of Hong Kong&quot;, Sai Kung has been able to retain its natural scenery. Many traditional customs and cultures are still retained in the rural villages.

==History==
The modern geopolitical entity of Sai Kung District was formed after World War II. Settlements existed in the area prior to the signing of the Convention for the Extension of Hong Kong Territory, which ceded the area to the colony of Hong Kong from the Qing Empire in 1898. Those ceded areas are now collectively known as the New Territories and New Kowloon.

According to Professor , unlike other villages of the New Territories, villages in Sai Kung did not form any &quot;yeuk&quot; (), a kind of inter-village alliances in the 19th century in the Qing dynasty.

Under the colonial rule, villages in Sai Kung were grouped under Tung Yeuk (also known as Tung Hoi Yeuk; ) in 1898.

Soon after, the district office of New Territories was established. The New Territories was divided into Northern and Southern District (both not the same as the modern day districts of HK) and New Kowloon in the 1920s. The area around the modern day Sai Kung Town was under the District Office North until 1947, which the area was under the administration of the Southern District (not the same as modern day Southern District) from 1947. The Southern District was under further reform since 1957.

After the end of World War II (the author did not state the exact year, however), the New Territories was divided into 8 sub-divisions, one of which was named after Sai Kung. Such sub-divisions was soon abolished. The North and South District Office were merged to form New Territories Administration, a department of the executive branch of the government, in 1948–1952, which has 3 sub-divisions: Tai Po (covers some of the area of the former Northern District), Yuen Long and Southern District. Sai Kung was under the aforementioned Southern District. Tsuen Wan District Officer was established in 1959 and craved out from the Southern District. The Southern District at that time only administrated the modern-day Sai Kung District and Islands District. A branch office of the Southern District was also established in Mui Wo in 1957, which now belongs to Lantau Island of the Islands District. It was reported that circa the early 1960s, the Southern District was further split into Sai Kung District and Islands District, but merged back in 1963.

By 1969, the New Territories Administration had 7 district offices, of which one was named after Sai Kung.

In 1977, the Hong Kong Governor announced to establish District Advisory Boards to invite locals to become advisors. Although Sai Kung locals, as well as other rural villages of the New Territories, already established their chambers and voting representatives to Heung Yee Kuk, an advisory body to the colonial government, as early as the 1930s.

The Sai Kung District and its District Council (at that time known as District Board) were formally formed in 1982. (Established in 1981, first election in 1982) A year before, the New Territories Administration was merged with its Kowloon and Hong Kong Island counterpart, the Home Affairs Department to form the City and New Territories Administration (it was renamed the Home Affairs Department again in 1993), although the Administration had transferred some functions to the Lands Department in 1982. Since 1985, the district officers of the Hong Kong Districts no longer chaired their respective districts councils. In a larger scale of history, due to the signing of the Sino-British Joint Declaration in 1984, which would hand over the whole colony to the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the colonial government had made several political reforms on local politics.

A water route from the northern Sai Kung Peninsula to Tai Po existed at least since the Qing dynasty. For this historical and other reasons, the northern portion of the Sai Kung Peninsula belongs to the Tai Po District, but not part of Sai Kung District.

Sai Kung was a local industrial centre before the 1900s. For example, in Sheung Yu (), villagers produced mortar and fertiliser from their own lime kiln. Villages also scattered on the islands of Port Shelter, Rocky Harbour, on the Sai Kung Peninsula, on the Clear Water Bay Peninsula as well as other land areas of the District. A temple located on High Island (known in Chinese as Leung Shuen Wan), dates back to 1741.

Sai Kung market town was expanded into the local town centre of the district after the 1950s. However, the District&#x27;s population are now concentrated around the Tseung Kwan O New Town, partially built on reclaimed land in Junk Bay (or known as its Chinese name Tseung Kwan O) in the 1980s.

==Population and settlement==
Sai Kung District covers approximately land area as of 2018, It had a population of 461,864 in 2016 by-census, most of it in Tseung Kwan O (398,479). Sai Kung Central election constituency, which roughly has the same boundary as Sai Kung Town planning zone, has a population of 9,623 in the same by-census. Tseung Kwan O is a new town and has multiple constituencies. However, all Tseung Kwan O constituencies are belongs to Tseung Kwan O Outline Zoning Plan in term of town planning administration.

===Sai Kung Town===
Sai Kung Town is a former fishing village and market township. The designation of the country park areas during the 1970s was a huge boost to the local tourist industry. Sai Kung town underwent significant expansion during the 1970s when the High Island Reservoir and associated water scheme required some villagers and fishermen to be rehoused in Sai Kung. This provided a core of government-funded new development, both housing and commercial, in the town centre. This was followed by the Tui Min Hoi (literal translation &#x27;over the harbour&#x27;) development under the government&#x27;s market town programme.

===Tseung Kwan O===

In addition to Sai Kung, Tseung Kwan O, a booming new town, is also part of Sai Kung District. Tseung Kwan O connects Sai Kung Peninsula with the Kowloon urban area.

Junk Bay was once a natural bay area in Sai Kung, quite near the seafood village of Lei Yue Mun. There once was an iron and steel factory, and the area around Hang Hau Village was known for its shipyards. In 1997, the Hong Kong Government started a major development project in this area, developing it into the seventh Hong Kong new town. Reclamation has since covered the whole bay area and it is now able to accommodate around 380,000 inhabitants, accounting for 95% of the district&#x27;s total population. This new town was renamed &quot;Tseung Kwan O&quot;, its present name.

Tseung Kwan O now includes several high-rise residential estates and an industrial estate. The MTR metro system was extended to Tseung Kwan O, facilitating access to Sai Kung District. In Tseung Kwan O, you can also take the green minibus 101M to get directly to Sai Kung.

==Geography==
In contrast to the densely populated areas of Hong Kong Island and Kowloon, Sai Kung District&#x27;s heartland is a coastal area characterised by its scenery, small villages and seascapes. The area is known for its pristine beaches and quiet living. Sai Kung remains only partly urbanised and is known as the &quot;last back garden&quot; of Hong Kong.

===UNESCO Global Geopark and Country Parks===
====Sai Kung Volcanic Rock Region, Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark====

Sai Kung Volcanic Rock Region lies in Sharp Island, High Island, the Ninepin Group and the Ung Kong Group (Wang Chau, Basalt Island and Bluff Island), where volcanic rocks, intrusive rocks and world-unique acidic hexagonal volcanic columnar rock joints created by Hong Kong&#x27;s last large-scale volcanic activity some 16.5 million to 14 million years ago crop out. With a host of volcanic rock coastal landforms, they form a comprehensive showcase of diverse and complex volcanic activities that explain Sai Kung&#x27;s geological past.

====Sai Kung East Country Park====
Sai Kung East Country Park occupies a vast area of east Sai Kung Peninsula. With the High Island Reservoir, High Island, Tai Long Wan, Pak Tam Au, Chek Keng, Sheung Yiu, Wong Shek Pier and the surrounding countryside, the 4,494 hectare protected area consists of the largest number of bays and coves among all country parks in Hong Kong. Part of the Geopark is also located there.

====Sai Kung West Country Park====
Sai Kung East Country Park, including the Sai Kung West Country Park (Wan Tsai Extension), occupies a vast area of west Sai Kung Peninsula. Old preserved villages, such as Pak Sha O, Yung Shue O and Lai Chi Chong are the places of interest.

====Clear Water Bay Country Park====
Clear Water Bay Country Park occupies the rugged terrain around High Junk Peak in the eastern and the western part of the Clear Water Bay Peninsula. High Junk Peak, one of the Three Sharp Peaks of Hong Kong, is a top attraction in the country park.

===Beaches===
Sai Kung has some of the cleanest beaches in Hong Kong, including:

* Clear Water Bay First Beach
* Clear Water Bay Second Beach
* Long Ke Wan
* Silverstrand Beach
* Tai Long Wan

===Islands===
On summer nights, many people hire small boats known as &quot;kaitos&quot; or &quot;sampan&quot;, some to catch cuttlefish which is a popular pastime for local residents, others for leisurely trips through the island-dotted inland sea of Port Shelter. Islands in the area include:

* Kau Sai Chau
* Kiu Tsui Chau (Sharp Island)
* Leung Shuen Wan Chau (High Island)
* Pak Sha Chau (White Sand Island)
* Yeung Chau (Sheep Island)
* Yim Tin Tsai (Little Salt Field)

The large island of Kau Sai Chau is the location for a public golf course developed and run by the Hong Kong Jockey Club.

==Local and tourist attractions==


There are numerous cultural sites, heritage sites and country parks in the Sai Kung peninsula, such as:

* Hong Kong UNESCO Global Geopark (香港聯合國教科文組織世界地質公園)
* Sheung Yiu Folk Museum (), located in a former Hakka village
* Memorial Monuments for Sai Kung Martyrs During World War II ()
* Sai Kung Outdoor Recreation Centre ()

* High Island Reservoir ()
* Jockey Club Kau Sai Chau Public Golf Course ()
* Yim Tin Tsai Village and St. Joseph&#x27;s Chapel ()

The town centre of Sai Kung has a high concentration of seafood restaurants which attract many tourists.

In addition, there are golf courses and nature trails. There is a golf driving range center in Ho Chung.

In recent years, the government has invested heavily in Sai Kung, with improvements being made to the town seafront, such as the Waterfront Park. An attractive mix of small boutique-style shops has sprung up as well, due to a sizeable expat population and increasing numbers of local visitors, selling everything from secondhand books to cat-themed accessories, and alternative lifestyle stores that offer items like surfboards, candles, incense, seashells, etc.

The revitalisation of the old Centro Building, now renamed Dock 1A, a hub in Sai Kung located at 1A, Chui Tong Road is underway. Previously the home of Tikitiki Bowling Alley and Bar, as well as a large supermarket, the complex will be transformed into a mega shopping mall with its grand opening is expected to happen in January 2025.

==Transport==
The MTR system&#x27;s Tseung Kwan O line currently has five stations in Tseung Kwan O New Town. The new town is also served by a comprehensive bus network that connects it to Kowloon via several main roads including Tseung Kwan O Tunnel and Po Lam Road.

Hang Hau Road and Ying Yip Road link Tseung Kwan O with Sai Kung Town and Clear Water Bay. The nearest MTR station to Sai Kung Town is Hang Hau.

Some isolated parts of Sai Kung Peninsula have no road access and can only be reached on foot or by boat. Where a destination is accessible by public transport, it is usually served via a network of bus routes, public light buses (i.e. minibuses) and taxis.

==Education==
The education in the Sai Kung District is administrated by the Education Bureau and not administrated by Sai Kung District Office. The latter is a division of Home Affairs Department instead. The Education Bureau has its own zoning scheme. For example, Primary One Admission School Net no.95, covers the whole Sai Kung District, as well as Sai Kung North which is part of Tai Po District.

The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology, one of the eight publicly funded tertiary institutions in Hong Kong, is located in Clear Water Bay Road, Sai Kung District.

The Hong Kong Institute of Vocational Education has in Tiu Keng Leng, Tseung Kwan O. The Hong Kong Design Institute is next to the IVE Tiu Keng Leng campus.

==Miscellaneous==
* The northern half of Sai Kung Peninsula belongs to nearby Tai Po District, and not Sai Kung District. This is because communities in the northern half of Sai Kung Peninsula used to be more connected to Tai Po via &quot;kai-to&quot; sea transport before roads were built leading into this area in the 20th century.
* Coincidentally, the Chinese characters &quot;西貢&quot; for &quot;Sai Kung&quot; are also the Vietnamese Chu nom characters for the name &quot;Saigon&quot; (now called Ho Chi Minh City), a major city in Vietnam. However, there is also a street called Saigon Street (西貢街) named after the Vietnamese city, not Sai Kung.

==Media==
Sai Kung District is served by &quot;Sai Kung Magazine&quot;, a free-distribution English language monthly magazine and the community website Saikung.com. The magazine covers the areas of Sai Kung Town, Clear Water Bay, Pak Sha Wan and Ma On Shan.

<text>In physics and materials science, elasticity is the ability of a body to resist a distorting influence and to return to its original size and shape when that influence or force is removed. Solid objects will deform when adequate loads are applied to them; if the material is elastic, the object will return to its initial shape and size after removal. This is in contrast to &quot;plasticity&quot;, in which the object fails to do so and instead remains in its deformed state.

The physical reasons for elastic behavior can be quite different for different materials. In metals, the atomic lattice changes size and shape when forces are applied (energy is added to the system). When forces are removed, the lattice goes back to the original lower energy state. For rubbers and other polymers, elasticity is caused by the stretching of polymer chains when forces are applied.

Hooke&#x27;s law states that the force required to deform elastic objects should be directly proportional to the distance of deformation, regardless of how large that distance becomes. This is known as &quot;perfect elasticity&quot;, in which a given object will return to its original shape no matter how strongly it is deformed. This is an ideal concept only; most materials which possess elasticity in practice remain purely elastic only up to very small deformations, after which plastic (permanent) deformation occurs.

In engineering, the elasticity of a material is quantified by the elastic modulus such as the Young&#x27;s modulus, bulk modulus or shear modulus which measure the amount of stress needed to achieve a unit of strain; a higher modulus indicates that the material is harder to deform. The SI unit of this modulus is the pascal (Pa). The material&#x27;s &quot;elastic limit&quot; or yield strength is the maximum stress that can arise before the onset of plastic deformation. Its SI unit is also the pascal (Pa).

==Overview==
When an elastic material is deformed due to an external force, it experiences internal resistance to the deformation and restores it to its original state if the external force is no longer applied. There are various elastic moduli, such as Young&#x27;s modulus, the shear modulus, and the bulk modulus, all of which are measures of the inherent elastic properties of a material as a resistance to deformation under an applied load. The various moduli apply to different kinds of deformation. For instance, Young&#x27;s modulus applies to extension/compression of a body, whereas the shear modulus applies to its shear. Young&#x27;s modulus and shear modulus are only for solids, whereas the bulk modulus is for solids, liquids, and gases.

The elasticity of materials is described by a stress–strain curve, which shows the relation between stress (the average restorative internal force per unit area) and strain (the relative deformation). The curve is generally nonlinear, but it can (by use of a Taylor series) be approximated as linear for sufficiently small deformations (in which higher-order terms are negligible). If the material is isotropic, the linearized stress–strain relationship is called Hooke&#x27;s law, which is often presumed to apply up to the elastic limit for most metals or crystalline materials whereas nonlinear elasticity is generally required to model large deformations of rubbery materials even in the elastic range. For even higher stresses, materials exhibit plastic behavior, that is, they deform irreversibly and do not return to their original shape after stress is no longer applied. For rubber-like materials such as elastomers, the slope of the stress–strain curve increases with stress, meaning that rubbers progressively become more difficult to stretch, while for most metals, the gradient decreases at very high stresses, meaning that they progressively become easier to stretch. Elasticity is not exhibited only by solids; non-Newtonian fluids, such as viscoelastic fluids, will also exhibit elasticity in certain conditions quantified by the Deborah number. In response to a small, rapidly applied and removed strain, these fluids may deform and then return to their original shape. Under larger strains, or strains applied for longer periods of time, these fluids may start to flow like a viscous liquid.

Because the elasticity of a material is described in terms of a stress–strain relation, it is essential that the terms &quot;stress&quot; and &quot;strain&quot; be defined without ambiguity. Typically, two types of relation are considered. The first type deals with materials that are elastic only for small strains. The second deals with materials that are not limited to small strains. Clearly, the second type of relation is more general in the sense that it must include the first type as a special case.

For small strains, the measure of stress that is used is the Cauchy stress while the measure of strain that is used is the infinitesimal strain tensor; the resulting (predicted) material behavior is termed linear elasticity, which (for isotropic media) is called the generalized Hooke&#x27;s law. Cauchy elastic materials and hypoelastic materials are models that extend Hooke&#x27;s law to allow for the possibility of large rotations, large distortions, and intrinsic or induced anisotropy.

For more general situations, any of a number of stress measures can be used, and it is generally desired (but not required) that the elastic stress–strain relation be phrased in terms of a finite strain measure that is work conjugate to the selected stress measure, i.e., the time integral of the inner product of the stress measure with the rate of the strain measure should be equal to the change in internal energy for any adiabatic process that remains below the elastic limit.

== Units ==

=== International System ===
The SI unit for elasticity and the elastic modulus is the pascal (Pa). This unit is defined as force per unit area, generally a measurement of pressure, which in mechanics corresponds to stress. The pascal and therefore elasticity have the dimension L−1⋅M⋅T−2.

For most commonly used engineering materials, the elastic modulus is on the scale of gigapascals (GPa, 109 Pa).

== Linear elasticity ==

As noted above, for small deformations, most elastic materials such as springs exhibit linear elasticity and can be described by a linear relation between the stress and strain. This relationship is known as Hooke&#x27;s law. A geometry-dependent version of the idea was first formulated by Robert Hooke in 1675 as a Latin anagram, &quot;ceiiinosssttuv&quot;. He published the answer in 1678: &quot;&quot;Ut tensio, sic vis&quot; meaning &quot;As the extension, so the force&quot;&quot;, a linear relationship commonly referred to as Hooke&#x27;s law. This law can be stated as a relationship between tensile force and corresponding extension displacement formula_1,
:formula_2
where is a constant known as the &quot;rate&quot; or &quot;spring constant&quot;. It can also be stated as a relationship between stress formula_3 and strain formula_4:
:formula_5
where is known as the Young&#x27;s modulus.

Although the general proportionality constant between stress and strain in three dimensions is a 4th-order tensor called stiffness, systems that exhibit symmetry, such as a one-dimensional rod, can often be reduced to applications of Hooke&#x27;s law.

== Finite elasticity ==
The elastic behavior of objects that undergo finite deformations has been described using a number of models, such as Cauchy elastic material models, Hypoelastic material models, and Hyperelastic material models. The deformation gradient (F) is the primary deformation measure used in finite strain theory.

=== Cauchy elastic materials ===

A material is said to be Cauchy-elastic if the Cauchy stress tensor σ is a function of the deformation gradient F alone:
:formula_6
It is generally incorrect to state that Cauchy stress is a function of merely a strain tensor, as such a model lacks crucial information about material rotation needed to produce correct results for an anisotropic medium subjected to vertical extension in comparison to the same extension applied horizontally and then subjected to a 90-degree rotation; both these deformations have the same spatial strain tensors yet must produce different values of the Cauchy stress tensor.

Even though the stress in a Cauchy-elastic material depends only on the state of deformation, the work done by stresses might depend on the path of deformation. Therefore, Cauchy elasticity includes non-conservative &quot;non-hyperelastic&quot; models (in which work of deformation is path dependent) as well as conservative &quot;hyperelastic material&quot; models (for which stress can be derived from a scalar &quot;elastic potential&quot; function).

=== Hypoelastic materials ===

A hypoelastic material can be rigorously defined as one that is modeled using a constitutive equation satisfying the following two criteria:

# The Cauchy stress formula_7 at time formula_8 depends only on the order in which the body has occupied its past configurations, but not on the time rate at which these past configurations were traversed. As a special case, this criterion includes a Cauchy elastic material, for which the current stress depends only on the current configuration rather than the history of past configurations.
# There is a tensor-valued function formula_9 such that formula_10 in which formula_11 is the material rate of the Cauchy stress tensor, and formula_12 is the spatial velocity gradient tensor.

If only these two original criteria are used to define hypoelasticity, then hyperelasticity would be included as a special case, which prompts some constitutive modelers to append a third criterion that specifically requires a hypoelastic model to &quot;not&quot; be hyperelastic (i.e., hypoelasticity implies that stress is not derivable from an energy potential). If this third criterion is adopted, it follows that a hypoelastic material might admit nonconservative adiabatic loading paths that start and end with the same deformation gradient but do &quot;not&quot; start and end at the same internal energy.

Note that the second criterion requires only that the function formula_9 &quot;exists&quot;. As detailed in the main hypoelastic material article, specific formulations of hypoelastic models typically employ so-called objective rates so that the formula_9 function exists only implicitly and is typically needed explicitly only for numerical stress updates performed via direct integration of the actual (not objective) stress rate.

=== Hyperelastic materials ===

Hyperelastic materials (also called Green elastic materials) are conservative models that are derived from a strain energy density function (&quot;W&quot;). A model is hyperelastic if and only if it is possible to express the Cauchy stress tensor as a function of the deformation gradient via a relationship of the form
:formula_15

This formulation takes the energy potential (&quot;W&quot;) as a function of the deformation gradient (formula_16). By also requiring satisfaction of material objectivity, the energy potential may be alternatively regarded as a function of the Cauchy-Green deformation tensor (formula_17), in which case the hyperelastic model may be written alternatively as
:formula_18

== Applications ==
Linear elasticity is used widely in the design and analysis of structures such as beams, plates and shells, and sandwich composites. This theory is also the basis of much of fracture mechanics.

Hyperelasticity is primarily used to determine the response of elastomer-based objects such as gaskets and of biological materials such as soft tissues and cell membranes.

==Factors affecting elasticity==
In a given isotropic solid, with known theoretical elasticity for the bulk material in terms of Young&#x27;s modulus,the effective elasticity will be governed by porosity. Generally a more porous material will exhibit lower stiffness. More specifically, the fraction of pores, their distribution at different sizes and the nature of the fluid with which they are filled give rise to different elastic behaviours in solids. 

For isotropic materials containing cracks, the presence of fractures affects the Young and the shear moduli perpendicular to the planes of the cracks, which decrease (Young&#x27;s modulus faster than the shear modulus) as the fracture density increases, indicating that the presence of cracks makes bodies brittler. Microscopically, the stress–strain relationship of materials is in general governed by the Helmholtz free energy, a thermodynamic quantity. Molecules settle in the configuration which minimizes the free energy, subject to constraints derived from their structure, and, depending on whether the energy or the entropy term dominates the free energy, materials can broadly be classified as &quot;energy-elastic&quot; and &quot;entropy-elastic&quot;. As such, microscopic factors affecting the free energy, such as the equilibrium distance between molecules, can affect the elasticity of materials: for instance, in inorganic materials, as the equilibrium distance between molecules at 0 K increases, the bulk modulus decreases. The effect of temperature on elasticity is difficult to isolate, because there are numerous factors affecting it. For instance, the bulk modulus of a material is dependent on the form of its lattice, its behavior under expansion, as well as the vibrations of the molecules, all of which are dependent on temperature.

<text>George Lincoln Rockwell (March 9, 1918 – August 25, 1967) was an American neo-Nazi activist. He founded the American Nazi Party in 1959 and became the self-styled leader of neo-Nazism in the United States. His beliefs, strategies, and writings have continued to influence many white supremacists and neo-Nazis.

Born in Bloomington, Illinois, Rockwell briefly studied philosophy at Brown University before dropping out to join the Navy. He trained as a pilot and served in World War II and the Korean War in non-combat roles, achieving the rank of Commander. Rockwell&#x27;s politics grew more radical and vocal in the 1950s, and he was honorably discharged due to his views in 1960.

In politics, he regularly praised Adolf Hitler, referring to him as the &quot;White Savior of the twentieth century&quot;. He denied the Holocaust and believed that Martin Luther King Jr. was a tool for Jewish communists desiring to rule the white community. He blamed the civil rights movement on Jews, and viewed most of them as traitors. He viewed black people as a primitive, lethargic race who desired only simple pleasures and a life of irresponsibility, and supported the resettlement of all African Americans in a new African state to be funded by the U.S. government. As a supporter of racial segregation and white separatism, he agreed with and quoted many leaders of the Black separatism movement such as Elijah Muhammad and early Malcolm X. In his later years, Rockwell became increasingly aligned with other neo-Nazi groups, leading the World Union of National Socialists.

On August 25, 1967, Rockwell was shot and killed in Arlington by John Patler, a former party member expelled by Rockwell for alleged &quot;Bolshevik leanings&quot;.

== Early life ==
Rockwell was born in Bloomington, Illinois, the first of three children of George Lovejoy Rockwell and Claire (Schade) Rockwell. His father was born in Providence, Rhode Island, and was of English and Scottish ancestry. His mother was the daughter of Augustus Schade, a German immigrant, and Corrine Boudreau, who was of Acadian French ancestry. Both parents were vaudeville comedians and actors. His parents divorced when Rockwell was six years old, and for the rest of his youth he divided his time between his mother in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and his father in Boothbay Harbor, Maine.

Rockwell attended Atlantic City High School in Atlantic City, and applied to Harvard University when he was 17 years old. However, he was denied admission. One year later, his father enrolled him at Hebron Academy in Hebron, Maine.

In August 1938, the twenty year old Rockwell enrolled at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island, as a philosophy major. In his sophomore year, Rockwell dropped out of Brown and accepted a commission in the United States Navy.

== Military service ==
Rockwell appreciated the order and discipline of the Navy, and attended flight schools in Massachusetts and Florida in 1940. When he completed his training, he served in the Battle of the Atlantic and the Pacific War in World War II. He served aboard the USS &quot;Omaha&quot;, USS &quot;Pastores&quot;, USS &quot;Wasp&quot; and USS &quot;Mobile&quot;, primarily in support, photo reconnaissance, transport and training functions. Though he never actually flew in combat, he was considered a good pilot and an efficient officer.

On April 24, 1943, Rockwell married Judith Aultman, whom he had met while attending Brown University. Aultman was a student at Pembroke College, which was the coordinate women&#x27;s college of the university. The couple had three daughters: Bonnie, Nancy, and Phoebe Jean. Rockwell did not get along with his in-laws; he blamed them for not raising Judith to be &quot;docile and compliant&quot;, his image of the perfect wife. His marriage was marred with violent arguments and on at least one occasion, he struck his wife.

After the war ended, Rockwell worked as a sign painter out of a small shop on land owned by his father in Boothbay Harbor, Maine. In 1946, he entered the commercial art program at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn, New York. He and his wife Judith moved to New York City so he could study at Pratt. He did well at Pratt, winning the $1,000 first prize for an advertisement he did for the American Cancer Society. However, he left Pratt before finishing his final year, and moved to Maine to found his own advertising agency.

In 1950, Rockwell was recalled to duty as a lieutenant commander at the beginning of the Korean War. He moved to San Diego with his wife and three children, where he trained pilots in the United States Navy and United States Marine Corps.

Privately, during his time in San Diego, Rockwell became an advocate of Adolf Hitler and a supporter of Nazism. He was influenced by Senator Joseph McCarthy&#x27;s stance against communism, carmaker Henry Ford&#x27;s hatred of Jews, and aviator Charles Lindbergh&#x27;s stance on race. Rockwell supported General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s candidacy for president of the United States. He adopted the corncob pipe, following MacArthur&#x27;s example. In 1951, he read the &quot;Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; and Hitler&#x27;s manifesto &quot;Mein Kampf&quot;.

In November 1952, Rockwell was transferred to Iceland, where he became a Grumman F8F Bearcat pilot and attained the rank of commander. Because families were not permitted to be with American service personnel stationed there, his wife and children stayed with her mother in Barrington, Rhode Island. His wife filed for divorce the following year. Rockwell attended a diplomatic party in Reykjavík where he met Margrét Þóra Hallgrímsson, the niece of Iceland&#x27;s ambassador to the United States; they were married on October 3, 1953, by Þóra&#x27;s uncle, the Bishop of Iceland. They spent their honeymoon in Berchtesgaden, Germany, where Hitler once owned the Berghof mountain retreat in the Bavarian Alps. They made a &quot;pilgrimage&quot; to Hitler&#x27;s Adlerhorst. Together they had three children: Hallgrímur, Margrét, and Evelyn Bentína. In 1957, Hallgrímsson&#x27;s father went to the U.S. to take his daughter back to Iceland because he had learned that Rockwell was &quot;one of the most active racists in the United States.&quot; She subsequently divorced Rockwell and remarried in 1963.

In September 1955 in Washington, D.C., he launched &quot;U.S. Lady&quot;, a magazine for United States servicemen&#x27;s wives. The magazine incorporated Rockwell&#x27;s political causes: his opposition to both racial integration and communism. The publication had financial problems and he sold the magazine. However, he still aspired to pursue a career in publishing.

== Early political activities ==
After his move to Washington, D.C., in 1955, he gradually became radicalized until, in the words of his biographer, he was &quot;on the farthest fringe of the right wing.&quot; In 1957–1958, Rockwell had a series of dreams that ended with him meeting Hitler.

In 1958, Rockwell met Harold Noel Arrowsmith Jr., a wealthy heir and antisemite who provided Rockwell with a house and printing equipment. They formed the National Committee to Free America from Jewish Domination.

On July 29, 1958, Rockwell demonstrated in front of the White House in an anti-war protest against President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s decision to send peacekeeping troops to the Middle East, known as Operation Blue Bat. Rockwell and his supporters specifically protested what they supposed was Jewish control of the government. In October 1958, following the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple bombing, Rockwell&#x27;s home was raided by the police.

Rockwell gained notoriety after Drew Pearson wrote an article describing how Rockwell and his followers dressed in uniforms, armed themselves with guns, and paraded at his home in Arlington County, Virginia.

== American Nazi Party ==

In March 1959, Rockwell founded the World Union of Free Enterprise National Socialists (WUFENS), a name selected to denote opposition to state ownership of property. In December 1959, the organization was renamed the American Nazi Party (later the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party, NSWPP), and its headquarters was relocated to 928 North Randolph Street in Arlington, which also became Rockwell&#x27;s home.

In 1959, he published an &quot;Animal Farm&quot;-type parody, the long-form poem and children&#x27;s book &quot;The Fable of the Ducks and the Hens.&quot;

In 1960, as a result of his political activities, the Navy discharged Rockwell one year short of retirement because he was regarded as &quot;not deployable&quot; due to his political views. The proceedings to dismiss him were an extremely public affair. Even though he received an honorable discharge, this didn&#x27;t matter to Rockwell. Rockwell claimed he &quot;had basically been thrown out of the Navy&quot;, for which he colloquially blamed the Jews. In order to attract media attention, Rockwell held a rally on April 3, 1960, on the National Mall, where he addressed the crowd with a two-hour speech. A second rally was planned for Union Square in New York City. Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. refused to grant him a permit to speak, and he appealed that decision to the New York Supreme Court. When Rockwell emerged in the courthouse rotunda, he was surrounded by a crowd of television reporters. One of the reporters, Reese Schonfeld, interviewed Rockwell, and after Rockwell made comments suggesting that he personally believed 80% of Jewish People were traitors while also admitting that it was a guess and he didn&#x27;t have any scientific backing for the claim, an unidentified Jewish man behind him was yelling and hurling insults at him. Rockwell, provocatively and in an anti-semitic way, claimed that &quot;they don&#x27;t do this whenever a Communist is speaking&quot;, while a melee was breaking out due to the unidentified Jewish man getting angry, requiring a police convoy to escort Rockwell from the courthouse. Rockwell, with the aid of the American Civil Liberties Union, eventually won a permit, but it was long after the date of the planned event. Another rally was set for July 4, 1960, again on the National Mall. Rockwell and his men were confronted by a mob and a riot ensued. The police arrested Rockwell and eight party members. Rockwell demanded a trial, and instead, was committed to a psychiatric hospital for thirty days. In less than two weeks, he was released and found mentally competent to stand trial. He published a pamphlet inspired by this experience titled &quot;How to Get Out or Stay Out of the Insane Asylum&quot;.

On January 15, 1961, Rockwell and a fellow Nazi Party member attempted to picket the local premiere of the film &quot;Exodus&quot; at the Saxon Theatre in Downtown Boston on Tremont Street while staying at the Hotel Touraine. After Boston Mayor John F. Collins declined to deny Rockwell the right to picket, members of the local Jewish community organized a counterdemonstration of 2,000 protestors in response on the corner of Tremont and Boylston Streets on the day of the premiere, which forced police to converge on the theater and force Rockwell into a police cruiser that took him to Logan International Airport where Rockwell was then boarded onto a flight to Washington, D.C. In early 1962, Rockwell planned a rally to celebrate Hitler&#x27;s birthday on April 20. In the summer, he attended a camp organized by British neo-Nazi Colin Jordan in Gloucestershire where they organized the World Union of National Socialists. In September, he awarded one of his members a medal for punching Martin Luther King Jr. in the face.

In the 1964 United States presidential election, Rockwell ran as a write-in candidate, receiving 212 votes. He ran as an independent in the 1965 Virginia gubernatorial election, receiving 5,730 votes, or 1.02% of the total, finishing last among the four candidates. In the summer of 1966, Rockwell led a counter-demonstration against King&#x27;s attempt to bring an end to &quot;de facto&quot; segregation in the white Chicago suburb of Cicero, Illinois. He believed that King was a tool for Jewish Communists who wanted to integrate America. Rockwell believed that integration was a Jewish plot to rule the white community. Rockwell led the American Nazi Party in assisting the Ku Klux Klan and similar organizations during the civil rights movement, in attempts to counter the Freedom Riders and the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom. But he soon came to believe that the Klan was stuck in the past and ineffective in helping him wage a modern racial struggle.

In 1966, after hearing the slogan &quot;Black Power&quot; during a debate with Black Panther Party leader Stokely Carmichael, Rockwell altered the phrase and started a call for &quot;White Power&quot;. In the spring of 1966, the party began publication of several pamphlets and books, including &quot;National Socialist World&quot; edited by William Luther Pierce, writings by Rockwell, the periodical &quot;Stormtrooper Magazine&quot; (originally &quot;National Socialist Bulletin&quot;), and a propaganda comic book, &quot;Here Comes Whiteman!&quot;, where the title superhero character battles enemies modeled after racist stereotypes. In November 1966, the American Civil Liberties Union once again represented Rockwell, defending his right to stage marches or parades in Jewish neighborhoods during Jewish holidays.

===Offices===
Rockwell established his &quot;Stormtrooper Barracks&quot; in a two-story farmhouse at 6150 Wilson Boulevard in the Dominion Hills Historic District. It was there that Alex Haley interviewed Rockwell for &quot;Playboy&quot;. The house has since been razed, and the property has been incorporated into Upton Hill Regional Park. A small pavilion with picnic tables marks the house&#x27;s former location.

The site of the party headquarters, 928 North Randolph Street in Ballston, Virginia, is now a hotel and office building. After Rockwell&#x27;s death, his successor Matthias Koehl relocated the headquarters to 2507 North Franklin Road in Clarendon, Arlington, Virginia. The small building, often misidentified today as Rockwell&#x27;s former headquarters, is now the Sweet Science Coffee shop, formerly The Java Shack. Koehl moved the headquarters to New Berlin, Wisconsin, in the mid-1980s.

== Record label ==
In the 1960s, Rockwell attempted to draw attention to his cause by starting a record label, named Hatenanny Records. The name was based on the word &quot;hootenanny&quot;, a term given to folk music performances. The label released several singles promoting racist and white supremacist beliefs by such bands as Odis Cochran and the Three Bigots and the Coon Hunters. These songs were sold mostly through mail order and at party rallies.

== Hate bus ==
When the Freedom Riders drove their campaign for the desegregation of bus stations in the Deep South, Rockwell secured a Volkswagen van and decorated it with slogans supporting white supremacy, dubbing it the &quot;Hate Bus&quot; and driving it to speaking engagements and party rallies. On May 24, 1961, Rockwell and nine others were arrested on charges of disturbing the peace in New Orleans after trying to picket the movie &quot;Exodus&quot;. They went on a hunger strike in jail. Rockwell was only able to raise enough bond money for himself so he could be released five days later. In June 1961, all ten men were found guilty, receiving sentences ranging from 30 to 60 days and fines ranging from $50 to $100. Once more, Rockwell paid his bond, but left his followers in jail. In 1962, the convictions were overturned on appeal. Several years later, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Louisiana&#x27;s statute on &quot;breach of the peace&quot; was unconstitutional. Ironically, the ruling mainly benefited black civil rights activists.

== Black separatism ==
Rockwell worked with Black separatist leaders who shared his goal of racial segregation, such as Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X. In January 1962, Rockwell wrote to his followers that Elijah Muhammad: He also said of Elijah Muhammad &quot;I am fully in concert with their program, and I have the highest respect for Elijah Muhammad.&quot; He referred to Muhammad as &quot;The Black People&#x27;s Hitler&quot; and donated $20 (worth about $212 in 2024) to the Nation of Islam at their &quot;Freedom Rally&quot; event on June 25, 1961, at Uline Arena in Washington where he and ten ANP members attended a speech by Malcolm X. Rockwell gave a speech to a crowd of 12,000 at a Black Muslim event in the International Amphitheater in Chicago, with Elijah Muhammad and Malcolm X, on February 25, 1962.

Inspired by Black Muslims&#x27; use of religion to mobilize people, Rockwell sought to collaborate with Christian Identity groups. On June 10, 1964, he met and formed an alliance with Identity minister Wesley A. Swift. Rockwell used religious imagery, depicting himself as a Christ-like martyr who was fighting against the Jews. Nazis found a welcome home in Swift&#x27;s church and church members found a political outlet in the American Nazi Party.

== Holocaust denial ==
Rockwell was a Holocaust denier. In an April 1966 interview for &quot;Playboy&quot; conducted by journalist Alex Haley, Rockwell stated, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe for one minute that any 6,000,000 Jews were exterminated by Hitler. It never happened.&quot; When asked in a 1965 interview with the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation if the Holocaust were true, Rockwell replied by claiming he had &quot;incontrovertible documentary proof that that&#x27;s not true.&quot;

== Assassination and trial ==
On August 25, 1967, Rockwell was shot and killed while leaving a laundromat in Arlington, Virginia, only a few yards from where he lived.

Hearing of his son&#x27;s death, Rockwell&#x27;s 78-year-old father said: &quot;I am not surprised at all. I&#x27;ve expected it for quite some time.&quot;

John Patler, who had been expelled by Rockwell from his party in March 1967 for repeated attempts to inject Marxist ideas into party publications, was convicted of the murder in December 1967, and sentenced to 20 years in prison. Patler spent eight years in prison before being paroled. After a parole violation, he spent another six years in prison. 

Matthias Koehl, the second in command at NSWPP, moved to establish control over Rockwell&#x27;s body and the assets of the NSWPP, which at the time had some 300 active members and 3,000 financial supporters. Rockwell&#x27;s parents wanted a private burial in Maine, but declined to fight with the Nazis. On August 27, an NSWPP spokesman reported that federal officials had approved a military burial at Culpeper National Cemetery, Rockwell being an honorably discharged veteran. The cemetery specified that no Nazi insignia could be displayed, and when the 50 mourners violated these conditions, the entrance to the cemetery was blocked in a five-hour standoff, during which the hearse, which had been stopped on railroad tracks near the cemetery, was nearly struck by an approaching train. The next day, Rockwell&#x27;s body was secretly cremated.

==Legacy==
Rockwell was a source of inspiration for David Duke, who openly espoused neo-Nazi sentiments when he was young. As a student in high school, when he learned that Rockwell was murdered, Duke reportedly said &quot;The greatest American who ever lived has been shot down and killed.&quot; Richard B. Spencer is another admirer of Rockwell.

Matthew Heimbach said that Rockwell was &quot;one of the most gifted orators of the 20th century&quot;, and Rockwell&#x27;s writings and speeches were &quot;the things that worked to bring me to National Socialism&quot;.

Two of Rockwell&#x27;s associates, Matthias Koehl and William Luther Pierce, formed their own organizations. Koehl, who was Rockwell&#x27;s successor, renamed the National Socialist White Peoples Party (NSWPP) the New Order in 1983 and shortly thereafter, he relocated its national headquarters to Wisconsin. Pierce founded the National Alliance and he also wrote the racist dystopian novel &quot;The Turner Diaries&quot;, which inspired numerous acts of far-right terrorism in the United States and elsewhere, like the assassination of Alan Berg, the Oklahoma bombing or the 1999 London nail bombings. Several other neo-Nazi groups were formed in the years since Rockwell&#x27;s death, some of them were formed by his followers and other groups were formed by newer generations of white supremacists. Some of them are currently defunct.

==In popular culture==

In the lyrics to the Bob Dylan song &quot;Talkin&#x27; John Birch Paranoid Blues&quot;, the narrator parodies Abraham Lincoln and Thomas Jefferson as being Communists, and he also claims that the only &quot;true American&quot; is George Lincoln Rockwell. Quoting the lyrics: &quot;I know for a fact that he hates Commies, &#x27;cause he picketed the movie &quot;Exodus&quot;.&quot;

The Twilight Zone episode &quot;He&#x27;s Alive&quot; features a character named Peter Vollmer who leads a neo-Nazi movement only to be visited by the spirit of Adolf Hitler. The character of Peter serves as a critique of Rockwell and his American Nazi Party.

For its 1972 album &quot;Not Insane or Anything You Want To&quot;, The Firesign Theatre created a fictional presidential candidate, George Papoon, running on the equally fictional ticket, the Natural Surrealist Light Peoples Party, the name taken as an apparent parody of Rockwell&#x27;s own group, the National Socialist White Peoples Party.

Marlon Brando portrayed Rockwell in the television miniseries &quot;&quot; and he won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Limited Series or Movie for his performance.

In the third season of the post-World War II alternate history television show &quot;The Man in the High Castle&quot;, David Furr portrayed Rockwell as the of North America. Nazi-ruled New York City&#x27;s main airport was named Lincoln Rockwell Airport.

In the 2021 British drama series &quot;Ridley Road&quot;, Rockwell is portrayed by actor Stephen Hogan.

<text>Jean McGivern Turner (born 23 December 1939) is a Scottish medical doctor and former Independent politician. She was the Member of the Scottish Parliament (MSP) for the Strathkelvin and Bearsden constituency from 2003 until 2007.

==Early life and education==
Turner was born in Glagow on 23 December 1939. She attended Hillhead High School before going on to study medicine at the University of Aberdeen, graduating with an MBChB in 1965.

==Career==
===Medical career===
After qualifying as a doctor, she worked as an anaesthetist registrar at the Southern General Hospital, then for 25 years as a general practitioner in the Springburn area in Glasgow.

In August 2007, she was appointed as chief executive of the Scotland Patients Association.

===Political career===
In 2001, a range of services at Stobhill Hospital were under threat and a &quot;Save Stobhill&quot; campaign had emerged. In March 2001 the constituency MSP for Strathkelvin and Bearsden, Sam Galbraith announced his resignation for health reasons, triggering a in the Strathkelvin and Bearsden Holyrood by-election of 2001. By April 44,000 had signed a petition. At the age of 61, having recently retired as a general practitioner, Turner entered the by-election as the independent &quot;Save Stobhill&quot; candidate. In that race, she finished second with 7,572 votes or 18%. She also campaigned against Labour&#x27;s treatment of the NHS.

In October 2002, she confirmed that she would stand as candidate at the elections the following year. In the 2003 Scottish parliamentary elections, she stood again in Strathkelvin and Bearsden on the same platform she used in 2001. This time, Turner won the seat with 10,988 votes or 31%. She finished ahead of Labour&#x27;s Brian Fitzpatrick, who was previously head of policy in Donald Dewar&#x27;s policy unit.

She sat on the Health Committee during her time as a MSP.

In February 2007, Turner announced she would stand for re-election at the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, but lost her seat to the Labour candidate, David Whitton.

He was the son of Jacob Johan Anckarström the Elder and Hedvig Ulrika Drufva. He married Gustaviana Elisabet Löwen (1764-1844) in 1783, and had two daughters and two sons: Gustafva Eleonora Löwenström (1785-1860), Carolina Lovisa, Johan Jacob and Carl David.

Anckarström served as a page at court and then as a captain in King Gustav III&#x27;s regiment between 1778 and 1783. During travels to Gotland, he was accused of slandering the king and fled to Stockholm, where he spent the winter; he was subsequently arrested, brought back, and tried in Gotland. Although he was acquitted due to lack of evidence, he later maintained in his confession that this incident sparked his fire of hatred towards the king, fuelled by the contemporary revolutionary movement in Europe.
Beginning in 1788 the Swedish nobles were starting to become violently opposed to the king, who, through the aid of the other estates in Parliament, had wrested most of their power from them and was now ruling the nation as an absolute ruler. This dislike was increased by a war against Russia and his implementation of the Union and Security Act of 1789 which stripped the nobles of nearly all of their power and privileges, as well as by the king&#x27;s desire to interfere in favor of Louis XVIII in the ongoing French Revolution. Anckarström, a man of strong passions and known to have a violent temper, decided the only path forward was the assassination of the king and communicated his intention to other disaffected nobles, including the Counts Claes Horn and Adolf Ribbing.

An early attempt to kill the king at a masquerade ball ended in failure.

===The murder===
On 16 March 1792, Gustav III had returned to Stockholm, after spending the day at Haga Palace outside the city, to dine and visit a masquerade ball at the Royal Opera. During dinner, the king received an anonymous letter (written by the colonel of the Life Guards, Carl Pontus Lilliehorn) that contained a threat to his life, but as the king had received numerous threatening letters in the past, he chose to ignore the warning.

After dining, the king with Baron Hans Henrik von Essen at his right arm went around the theatre once and then into the foyer where they met Captain Carl Fredrik Pollet. The king, von Essen and Pollet continued through a corridor towards the stage where several dancers and masked men filled the space. Due to the crowd, Pollet receded behind the king, who then leaned back to talk to Pollet.

Anckarström stood at the entrance to the corridor and edged himself behind the king, took out a pistol from his left inner pocket and either he or Count Ribbing, who was next to him, pulled the trigger. Because of the king leaning back at that exact moment the shot went in at an angle left of the third lumbar vertebrae towards the left hip region. The shot consisted of two bullets, furniture tacks and bits of lead clippings; Anckarström later confessed that the composition of the shot was intended to be as lethal as possible.

The king twitched and said “aee” without falling. Anckarström then lost courage; he had thought that the king would fall directly. Bewildered, Anckarström dropped the pistol and knife on the floor, took a few steps and shouted fire. He quickly went towards the entrance, but the guards had already closed the doors. Despondent, he hid his second pistol and mixed in with the crowd. His intention had been to shoot himself with the second pistol. Witnesses told the court that Anckarström had been agitated and asked if the king was badly wounded. All guests at the masquerade were forced to give their names before leaving. 

In the 19th Century the history of the assassination was embellished upon, embellishments that still are taken as facts today. Most notably is the tale of how one of the conspirators (often cited as Claes Fredrik Horn) taps the king on the shoulder and saying “bonsoir, beau masque” (Good evening, beautiful masque) to point out Anckarström&#x27;s target. The other embellishment would be that the king was shot at a certain point in a counter dance, “Plaisir de Grönsö”. The conductor, so the legend goes, marked the sound of the shot in his notes and the music stopped. But the court records show that few people noticed the shot and the music continued playing for some time afterwards.

Anckarström&#x27;s pistols, legend aside, were brought to several gunsmiths the next morning and one who had repaired them for Anckarström recognized them and identified him as their owner. Anckarström was arrested the same morning and immediately confessed to the murder, although he denied a conspiracy until he was informed that Horn and Ribbing had been arrested and confessed in full.

Anckarström was jailed in a prison not far from the Royal Palace in Stockholm. Today the former prison is an underground restaurant named after the viceroy Sten Sture.

Curiously, the murder had been predicted to the king four years earlier, when he paid an anonymous visit to the celebrated medium of the Gustavian era, Ulrica Arfvidsson. She was often employed by his brother, Duke Charles, and was said to have a large net of informers all over town; she was never suspected to be involved, but she was questioned about the murder. In 1791, Charlotta Roos also predicted misfortune to King Gustav III, something he reportedly referred to on his death bed after the assassination.

===Execution===
Gustav III died of his wounds on 29 March and on 16 April Anckarström was sentenced. He was stripped of his estates and nobility privileges. He was sentenced to be cast in irons for three days and publicly flogged, his right hand to be cut off, his head removed, and his corpse quartered. The execution took place on 27 April 1792. He endured his sufferings with the greatest fortitude, and seemed to rejoice in having rid his country of a tyrant. His principal accomplices Ribbing and Horn were stripped of titles and estates and expelled from the country.

===Aftermath===
In the same year, the &quot;Anckarström&quot; family changed its surname to &quot;Löwenström&quot; and donated funds for a hospital as a gift of appeasement. This resulted in the Löwenström Hospital, or &quot;Löwenströmska lasarettet&quot; in Upplands Väsby north of Stockholm. Living descendants of Anckarström include Ulf Adelsohn, and solo sailor Sven Yrvind.

==Operas==
Anckarström is a character in Daniel Auber&#x27;s opera &quot;Gustave III&quot; and Giuseppe Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (&quot;A Masked Ball&quot;). In the operas, his motivation is changed to jealousy over his wife Amelia, with whom Gustav is portrayed as being in love. He is actually portrayed as being Gustav&#x27;s close friend before he switches allegiances. Gustav pardons him with his last breath. In the censored version of the Verdi libretto, set in Colonial-era Boston, he is called Renato (Rene).

<text>The Public Service Association (), or PSA, is a democratic trade union with over workers in the New Zealand public sector.

The stated aims of the PSA are to provide support for public and not-for-profit community services, support worker voices and participation though unions, ensure workplaces are free from discrimination, and advance the Te Tiriti o Waitangi principles of partnership, protection and participation, as they relate to the working lives of the union&#x27;s members.

The PSA is affiliated with the New Zealand Council of Trade Unions and Public Services International but is forbidden, by its own rules, from affiliating with political parties or organisations.

==History==
The New Zealand Public Service Association officially dates from 31 October 1913.

Public servants were poorly paid and were often forced to take pay cuts when the economy stalled. In 1931, for example, all public servant salaries were cut by 10%. It was only loans from the Public Service Investment Society, set up by the PSA in 1928, that prevented many of them from falling into loan sharks. An overcrowded Wellington department was described by the PSA as &quot;a compromise between a hot-house and a tin shed erected by amateur carpenters&quot;. With a change of government in 1936, a five-day working week for public servants was introduced.

In 1950, its membership was nearly 30,000. A major focus of the 1950s was discrimination against women. The PSA also passed the Government Service Equal Pay Act.

In 1979, in response to a notice of strike action by electricity workers, the government introduced the Public Service Association Withdrawal of Recognition Bill. The bill would have given the government the power to seize all the assets of the union and vest them in the public trustee. In the face of mass protests and a PSA offer to submit the dispute to mediation, the government backed down and withdrew the bill. In 1987, the government introduced the State Sector Bill. PSA members held massive protest meetings and a national strike in 1988.

In the early 1990s, the Employment Contracts Act removed unions as legal entities, with restricted rights.

In the late 1990s, the PSA worked with the Government and State Services Commission to reassess and rebuild the public service. It developed the Partnership for Quality.

In 2000, the first Quality for Partnership Agreement was signed by the PSA and the government. Though the current government has chosen not to enter into a formal partnership with the PSA. In 2006, the union negotiated national pay rates for occupational groups in the health sector.

In 2010, the union negotiated a collective employment agreement for its 6,000 local government members in Auckland when eight councils and a large number of council-controlled organisations were amalgamated into a single Auckland council.

==Governance==
===Workplaces and sectors===
Each PSA member in a workplace pays a membership subscription fee.
Those fees provide the vast majority of the union&#x27;s income.

Workplaces are grouped into five sectors:
* Public Service ()
* District Health Boards ()
* State Sector ()
* Local Government ()
* Community Public Services ()

===Groups===
Members may also belong to national groups, and the following groups are represented on the union&#x27;s committees:
* Te Rūnanga o Ngā Toa Āwhina: for those who identify as Māori
* Pasefika Network: for those who identify as Pacific Island people
* PSA Youth: for those who are aged 35 and under

===Meetings and committees===
Each workplace has an annual meeting.
The delegates form a workplace committee and then elect a .
Delegate committees have positions for Te Rūnanga o Ngā Toa Āwhina and Pasefika Network.

Having consulted their members, the delegates in a sector elect their peers to the sector committee.
The delegates on each sector committee elect two co-convenors, at least one of whom must be a woman, and the committee includes delegates from Te Rūnanga o Ngā Toa Āwhina, Pasefika Network and PSA Youth.

Every two years, a national delegates&#x27; congress is held. The current president, Benedict Ferguson, was elected in 2020.

In between congresses, the executive board sets and oversees the implementation of policy.
The board includes the president and leaders of Te Rūnanga o Ngā Toa Āwhina, Pasefika Network and PSA Youth.

<doc id="268938" wikidata="Q1386299" url="?curid=268938" title="Francis Parker Yockey">
<text>Francis Parker Yockey (September 18, 1917 – June 17, 1960) was an American fascist and pan-European nationalist idealogue. A lawyer, he is known for his neo-Spenglerian book &quot;&quot;, published in 1948 under the pen name Ulick Varange, which called for a neo-Nazi European empire.

Yockey supported far-right causes around the world and remains an influence of white nationalist and neo-fascist movements. Yockey was an antisemite, revered German Nazism, and was an early Holocaust denier. In the 1930s he contacted or worked with the Nazi-aligned Silver Shirts and the German-American Bund. He served in the U.S. Army in 1942–43, and went AWOL to help Nazi spies. After
legal appointments in Detroit in 1944–45, he worked for eleven months on the War Crimes tribunal in Germany before he either resigned or was fired for siding with the Nazis. In London, he worked for the British fascist Oswald Mosley&#x27;s Union Movement, and after falling out with Mosley, founded the breakaway European Liberation Front in 1949, leading it until it fizzled around 1954.

During the Cold War, Yockey reportedly worked with Soviet bloc intelligence, and argued for a tactical far-right alliance with the Soviets against what he saw as Jewish-American hegemony. He also briefly wrote anti-Jewish propaganda in Egypt, where he met its president Gamal Abdel Nasser. Yockey remained influential in fascist circles until his suicide in FBI custody in 1960. Yockey&#x27;s last visitor in prison was Willis Carto, who became the leading advocate and publisher of his writings.

==Biography==
Yockey had many aliases, and some facts about him are not certain&quot;.&quot; Acquaintances and declassified FBI files described him as a talented speaker, brilliant, well-read, sometimes charming, humorous and a gifted mimic — but also haughty, immature, secretive, a loner, and, in the FBI&#x27;s words, &quot;nervous, high-strung, erratic, unpredictable and dictatorial&quot;, with &quot;an amazing capacity for alienating people&quot;.

=== Early life and education ===
Yockey was born in 1917 in Chicago, Illinois, the youngest of four siblings in an upper-middle-class Catholic family of Irish and German descent. His father was a stockbroker. Yockey was raised in Ludington, Michigan. He learned classical piano.

He began college as an undergraduate at the University of Michigan, then transferred to Georgetown University, and later completed his degree at the University of Arizona. Before starting law school at Northwestern University, he also studied law at De Paul University, and graduated from the Notre Dame Law School in 1941. In college, he declared he would not dine with black, Jewish or communist students.

Yockey had been attracted to Marxism in early life before gravitating to Adolf Hitler and Nazism in the 1930s, and in college, Oswald Spengler. Other influences include Karl Haushofer and the Nazi theorist Carl Schmitt, whom Yockey was later accused of plagiarizing. Yockey joined pro-German and pro-fascist groups in the late 1930s. In 1938, his essay &quot;The Tragedy of Youth&quot; was published in &quot;Social Justice&quot;, a journal known for publishing antisemitic tracts that was distributed by the &quot;radio priest&quot; Charles Coughlin. In 1939 Yockey spoke at a gathering of Silvershirts.

=== World War II and immediate postwar ===
Yockey enlisted in the U.S. Army in 1942, serving in an intelligence unit. He went AWOL from his camp in Georgia in November 1942 on a Nazi mission to Texas and Mexico City. According to Yockey&#x27;s biographer Kevin Coogan, Yockey secretly helped German Nazi spies who had landed in the United States and Mexico. He was also a friend of a German American intelligence officer Herbert Hans Haupt, who stayed at the home of his wife and was later executed for espionage for his participation in Operation Pastorius. Later, Yockey received an honorable discharge from the Army for &quot;dementia praecox, paranoid type&quot; in 1943 after suffering a nervous breakdown or feigning one. He was placed on a government list of Americans suspected of pro-Nazi views. In 1944 he became an assistant prosecuting attorney for Wayne County, Michigan, but was bored by the work, leaving in 1945.

In early 1946, Yockey found a job with the United States War Department in Wiesbaden, Germany, as a post-trial review attorney for the Nuremberg Trials, and he moved to Germany with his wife and two daughters. Evidence suggests Yockey may have tried to help accused Nazi war criminals including SS General Otto Ohlendorf by sharing top-secret documents with German defense lawyers. Often absent from his job, he was fired for &quot;abandonment of position&quot; on the 26th of November 1946, when it was noticed that he was siding with the Nazis. He agitated against Allied occupation of Germany, and later worked for the Red Cross in Germany but deserted his post. U.S. intelligence began tracking Yockey in Germany in 1946 or 1947. Yockey left his estranged wife and daughters in Germany in 1947 for exile in Ireland. 

Yockey was a central figure in early postwar Nazi networks. Over time, he contacted or worked with far-right figures and organizations including the German-American Bund, the National German-American Alliance, William Dudley Pelley&#x27;s Silver Shirts, Sir Oswald Mosley&#x27;s Union Movement, George Sylvester Viereck, the American H. Keith Thompson, Gerald L. K. Smith, and James H. Madole&#x27;s National Renaissance Party. After the war Thompson and Madole became advocates of Yockey&#x27;s worldview and published some of his essays.

=== Cold War years ===

Yockey identified the United States, not Russia, as Europe&#x27;s main enemy, urged Europeans not to collaborate with America in the Cold War, and wanted to act against American forces in Germany and England. He hoped to weaken or overthrow the government of the United States. Yockey&#x27;s ideas were usually embraced only by those who could countenance an alliance between the far left and the far right.

Without notes, Yockey wrote his first book, &quot;&quot;, in Brittas Bay, Ireland, over the winter and early spring of 1948. &quot;Imperium&quot; is a Spenglerian critique of 19th century materialism and rationalism that scorns democracy and equality, extols Nazism, and blames Jews for various problems. It subscribes to Spengler&#x27;s suggestion that Germany had been destined to fulfil the &#x27;Roman&#x27; role in Western Civilization by uniting all its states into one empire. It is dedicated to &quot;the hero of the Second World War&quot;, by which he meant Hitler. In an early example of Holocaust denial, it also claims that the Nazis&#x27; gas chambers were faked. Yockey mailed copies of &quot;Imperium&quot; to far-right figures in Europe and America. Views expressed in it were endorsed by former Nazi General Otto Remer (who had been Hitler&#x27;s bodyguard); the American Revilo P. Oliver; and Italian esotericist Julius Evola, as well as the praise of Hans-Ulrich Rudel, Giorgio Almirante, Heinz Knoke, and Karl-Heinz Priester.

Yockey became embittered with Sir Oswald Mosley (Hitler&#x27;s leading British proponent) after the latter refused to publish or review &quot;Imperium&quot; upon its completion, after having promised to do so. Mosley punched Yockey in the nose during a dispute in London&#x27;s Hyde Park. With a small group of British fascists including the former Mosleyites Guy Chesham and John Gannon, Yockey formed the European Liberation Front (ELF) in 1948–49. The ELF formed ties with old Nazis along with other fascists. It issued a newsletter, &quot;Frontfighter&quot;, and in 1949 published Yockey&#x27;s virulent anti-American, anti-communist and antisemitic text &quot;The Proclamation of London&quot;, which called for a reinstatement of Nazism and the expulsion of the Jews (whom it labeled &quot;the Culture-distorter&quot;) from Europe. The ELF was opposed by other neo-fascist groups and essentially disappeared by 1954 due to members being alienated by Yockey&#x27;s imperious personality.

The American Nazi Party of George Lincoln Rockwell rejected Yockey&#x27;s anti-American attitude and willingness to work with anti-Zionist communist governments and movements. (Yockey told Willis Carto that he had never heard of the ANP when Carto visited him in prison in 1960.) Other neo-Nazis such as Rockwell&#x27;s ally Colin Jordan disagreed with Yockey&#x27;s views on race, and saw Yockeyism as being &quot;Strasserist&quot; which would undermine Nazism.

Declassified FBI files show that Yockey traveled to Los Angeles, San Francisco, and New York to collaborate with ultra-right activists, while eluding FBI agents who sought to question him. As a fugitive he spoke at the 1950 Christian Nationalist Party convention in Los Angeles organized by Gerald L. K. Smith. He also spent time in New Orleans writing propaganda for use in Latin America. His intercepted letters to other fascists in the 1950s were often signed &quot;Torquemada&quot; after the Spanish Grand Inquisitor. 

Yockey was approached by the group around the anti-Communist Senator Joseph McCarthy in 1951. He was asked to ghost-write a speech for McCarthy which stressed the importance of greater friendship between Germany and the United States. Although McCarthy never delivered it as the theme of the speech, when it was announced through posters in the Yorkville neighbourhood of New York City, the-then Left Wing newspaper &quot;The Daily Compass&quot; ran a front page expose, alongside negative press attention from the &quot;New York Post&quot;, probably influenced by the fact that a series of well known Holocaust deniers were going to speak alongside him.
Yockey collaborated with Soviet bloc intelligence, traveled behind the Iron Curtain, and was suspected of visiting East Germany, the Soviet Union and Cuba. One theory for this derives from a September 1956 story about a mysterious American man, who went by the name of &quot;Frederick C. Hopkins&quot; who was released from Soviet police custody on the 6th of September 1956. He wrote with approval of antisemitic purges in the Eastern bloc countries. In late 1952, he traveled to Prague and witnessed the Prague Trials, and asserted that they &quot;foretold a Russian break with Jewry&quot;. He then became a Czechoslovak Secret Service courier. He is suspected of having been in contact with a Soviet agent by the name of Alfred Francke-Gricksch.

Yockey met Egyptian President Gamal Abdel Nasser, whom he called &quot;a great and vigorous man&quot;, in Cairo in 1953. He worked briefly for the Egyptian Information Ministry, writing anti-Zionist propaganda. In the Arab world, he made contact with Nazi exiles including Otto Ernst Remer and Johann von Leers. Yockey reportedly tried to persuade Nasser to finance development of a cobalt bomb by ex-Nazi scientists.

Yockey was known as a womanizer, and had an affair with Hazel Guggenheim McKinley. In 1957, FBI agents assessed that he was &quot;living in Los Angeles as a pimp or a gigolo&quot; and had written pornography for money, including a sadomasochistic booklet called &quot;Arduous Figure Training at Bondhaven&quot; that was later found in his suitcase&quot;.&quot; The 62-page booklet was published by Nutrix Company of Jersey City and according to the FBI &quot;contained numerous sketeches of partially clad females and [...] was of a masochistic or sadistic nature.&quot;

=== Arrest and death ===
After more than a decade of pursuit by the FBI, Yockey was finally arrested in 1960 after returning to the United States from abroad. En route to Oakland, California, his suitcase had either been lost or had broken open at the Dallas airport, and authorities found several of Yockey&#x27;s falsified passports and birth certificates. When this was reported to the federal government, the FBI tracked Yockey down in Oakland, California, and arrested him. While in prison, he was visited by Carto, who later became the chief advocate and publisher of Yockey&#x27;s ideas. While he was there, he was staying with the principal of a yeshiva called Alexander Scharf, whom he had met in Reno and intended to give a loan of 2,000 USD. Yockey was soon after found dead with an empty cyanide capsule nearby while in a jail cell in San Francisco under FBI supervision. Writing after his suicide, the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; declared him &quot;as important a figure in world Fascism as we now know.&quot;

==Occult and philosophy interests==
Coogan writes that &quot;Yockey&#x27;s occult interests had political ramifications&quot; as he &quot;clearly saw himself as part of an underground elite, a secret new race of god-men&quot;. Yockey was an owner of documents relating to Theosophy, according to the FBI. At the time of his suicide, he had copies of books and articles written by Baltasar Gracián, Otto Weininger, H. G. Wells, and George B. Leonard.

==Influence==

While some postwar European and American nationalists of the post-war period sided with the United States against communism, or in other cases argued for third positionism, Yockey argued for a &quot;red-brown alliance&quot; (red representing the far-left and brown representing the far-right). He argued that rightists should aid the spread of communism and Third World anti-colonial movements when they threatened the United States. This view did not have a very significant influence on the American right, which in the Cold War for the most part remained anti-communist. He had a greater impact in Europe, in the European New Right, where for instance the Belgian Jean Thiriartand the Frenchmen Christian Bouchet, René Binet, and Dominique Venner are known to have been influenced by him. Additionally, the Russian philosopher Aleksandr Dugin, and the French writer Alain de Benoist, adopted positions similar to Yockey&#x27;s, although there is little evidence his work influenced them in this. He also influenced American Nazi Party member Dan Burros and National Renaissance Party founder James H. Madole. The British military writers Liddell Hart and J.F.C. Fuller who was a member of the British Union of Fascists gave early praise to &quot;Imperium&quot;.

Yockey is also remembered as an early and influential Holocaust denier.

Yockey&#x27;s present influence is reflected mostly through the work of Willis Carto and his Liberty Lobby and successor organizations. According to Stephen E. Atkins, &quot;Because of the efforts of Carto, Yockey is more popular after his death than he ever was when he was alive&quot;. Carto ran the &quot;Youth for George Wallace&quot; group supporting segregationist George Wallace&#x27;s 1968 presidential campaign. That group formed the basis for the National Youth Alliance, which promoted Yockey&#x27;s political philosophy and his book &quot;Imperium&quot;. Core members of Carto&#x27;s political groups were members of the Francis Parker Yockey Society, a neo-Nazi cult. Afterward, Yockey continued to be a cult figure among neo-fascists. His influence also persists among Odinists. According to the American political scientist George Hawley, &quot;Yockey&#x27;s vision of a global fascist movement that transcends national borders is now a common trope within the Alt-Right&quot;.

In his 2011 book of correspondences with American conductor David Woodard, Swiss writer Christian Kracht recommended Yockey&#x27;s &quot;Imperium&quot;. The following year, Kracht published his bestselling novel &quot;Imperium&quot;.

In Malta, the Neo-Fascist leader by the name of Norman Lowell is heavily inspired by Yockey&#x27;s book &quot;Imperium&quot;, and has the name of his organization, Imperium Europa directly alluding to it.

The Order of Nine Angles, a Satanist and terrorist group, is known to draw from his beliefs. Other terrorists inspired by Yockey include Leo Felton, responsible for the 2002 white supremacist terror plot and John William King an assailant in the Murder of James Byrd Jr.. Additionally, far-right political activist Augustus Sol Invictus has drawn inspiration from Yockey&#x27;s book &quot;Imperium&quot;, as well as the New Zealander Kerry Bolton.

<text>Texas Earnest Schramm Jr. (June 2, 1920 – July 15, 2003) was an American professional football executive who was the original president and general manager of the Dallas Cowboys franchise of the National Football League (NFL). Schramm, usually referred to as &quot;Tex&quot;, became the head of the Cowboys when the former expansion team started operations in 1960.

==Early life and career==
Despite his name, Schramm was not born in Texas, but in San Gabriel, California. Texas was his father&#x27;s name and where his parents met. Schramm attended Alhambra High School and went to the University of Texas, graduating in 1947 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in journalism. At UT he was a member of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity, as was his father. Schramm interrupted his education to serve as an officer in the United States Army Air Forces during World War II.

Before joining the Cowboys, Schramm was part of the Los Angeles Rams from 1947 to 1956. During his tenure, he hired Pete Rozelle as the Rams&#x27; public relations director, who would eventually become the Commissioner of the National Football League. They remained close friends after Rozelle became NFL commissioner and Schramm became general manager of the Cowboys (each holding his position for 29 years).

==Dallas Cowboys==

In late 1959, when it became apparent that the NFL was intent on expanding to Dallas, Schramm told his friends in football that he was interested in running the team. Chicago Bears owner George Halas introduced Schramm to Clint Murchison Jr., who had tried to bring the NFL to Dallas several times in the past. Murchison hired Schramm as the general manager for a potential Dallas team, which became a reality when the league awarded a franchise to the city on January 28, 1960.

In 1960, Schramm hired head coach Tom Landry and chief scout Gil Brandt. By the mid-1960s, the three men had built the Cowboys into an elite team. The Cowboys, despite two consecutive losses to the Green Bay Packers in the NFL Championship Game in 1966 and &#x27;67, had 20 consecutive winning seasons, and won the most games of any NFL team of the 1970s. They appeared in five Super Bowls that decade, winning Super Bowls VI and XII, and losing Super Bowls V, X, and XIII by a combined 11 points. The Cowboys became a marquee NFL franchise, their popularity inspiring the nickname &quot;America&#x27;s Team&quot;.

In 1966, Schramm met secretly with American Football League (AFL) founder Lamar Hunt to begin the negotiations that led to the 1970 merger of the NFL and AFL, as well as the first Super Bowl in 1967.

Schramm was known as the most powerful general manager in the NFL. The Cowboys&#x27; owners during his tenure, Murchison (1960–84) and Bum Bright (1984–1988), largely left day-to-day operations in his hands. Schramm represented the Cowboys at league meetings and exercised the team&#x27;s voting rights, something normally reserved for team owners.

Schramm was a leading opponent of the 1987 NFLPA Strike. The NFL players union at the time were agitating for a better deal, including free agency rights. Schramm, with other owners, organized the hiring of replacement players while the usual players were on strike, earning a nickname of &quot;the commissioner of replacement football&quot;. Schramm cattily said to executive director of the NFLPA Gene Upshaw &quot;Gene, here’s what you have to understand: we&#x27;re the ranchers and you&#x27;re the cattle, and we can always get more cattle.&quot; Schramm was comparatively effective in convincing regular players of the Cowboys to cross the picket line, albeit at the cost of splitting the team; he aggressively used contract clauses as threats to revoke millions of dollars in annuity payments from players who would not return to work. Running back Tony Dorsett, who had previously criticized other team members for breaking the strike, felt he was financially forced to rejoin as well by Schramm&#x27;s threats. Eventually 21 Cowboys players would break the strike and play with replacement players, a much higher rate than for other teams in the League; the Cowboys went 2-1 during the three strike-affected games. The cost of Schramm&#x27;s threats to the team&#x27;s success was high: The Cowboys would only go 8–35 over the next two and a half seasons, not recovering until new ownership took over.

==Innovations==

Schramm was known for advocating for a number of changes and innovations that helped modernize the NFL. These include instant replay, using computer technology in scouting, multi-color striping of the 20- and 50-yard lines, 30-second clock between plays, extra-wide sideline borders, wind-direction stripes on the goal post uprights, the referee&#x27;s microphone, headsets in the quarterback&#x27;s helmet for hearing plays, and hiring Dee Brock to establish the Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders. While leading the league&#x27;s Competition Committee, he oversaw rule changes such as using overtime in the regular season, putting the official time on the scoreboard, moving goalposts from the front of the end zone to the back, and protecting quarterbacks through the in-the-grasp rule. Schramm&#x27;s desire for a more comprehensive scouting combine led to the annual offseason NFL Scouting Combine in Indianapolis. Don Shula said of Schramm, &quot;I truly believe he had as much, or more, to do with the success of professional football as anyone who has ever been connected with the league.&quot;

==After the Cowboys==

Schramm stayed on only briefly with the Cowboys after Jerry Jones purchased the team and fired Tom Landry. He left to become the president of the World League of American Football. Schramm was inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1991. Schramm&#x27;s entry into the Cowboys Ring of Honor took much longer due to strained relations with Jones. Schramm had created the Ring of Honor, and had been a &quot;one-man committee&quot; on inductions. Jones became that &quot;committee&quot; when he took over. Finally in 2003, Jones announced that Schramm would be inducted into the ring during the next football season. Schramm attended the announcement press conference and spoke, but died a few months later and was inducted posthumously.

Schramm married his high school sweetheart, Martha Anne Snowden, in 1941. Martha Schramm died on December 8, 2002. The couple had three daughters.

<doc id="268943" wikidata="Q968545" url="?curid=268943" title="Mattel Aquarius">
<text>Aquarius is a home computer designed by &quot;Radofin&quot; and released by &quot;Mattel Electronics&quot; in 1983. Based on the Zilog Z80 microprocessor, the system has a rubber chiclet keyboard, 4K of RAM, and a subset of Microsoft BASIC in ROM. It connects to a television set for audiovisual output, and uses a cassette tape recorder for secondary data storage. A limited number of peripherals, such as a 40-column thermal printer, a 4-color printer/plotter, and a 300 baud modem, were released. The Aquarius was discontinued in October 1983, only a few months after it was launched.

==Development==
Looking to compete in the home computer market, &quot;Mattel Electronics&quot; turned to &quot;Radofin&quot;, the Hong Kong based manufacturer of their Intellivision consoles. &quot;Radofin&quot; had designed two computer systems. Internally they were known as &quot;Checkers&quot; and the more sophisticated &quot;Chess&quot;. Mattel contracted for these to become the Aquarius and Aquarius II, respectively.

Aquarius was announced in 1982 and finally released in June 1983, at a price of $160. Production ceased four months later because of poor sales. Mattel paid &quot;Radofin&quot; to take back the marketing rights. Four other companies: &quot;CEZAR Industries&quot;, &quot;CRIMAC&quot;, &quot;New Era Incentives&quot;, and &quot;Bentley Industries&quot; also marketed the unit and accessories.

The Aquarius was often bundled with the Mini-Expander peripheral, which added game pads, an additional cartridge port for memory expansion, and the General Instrument AY-3-8910 sound chip. Other peripherals were the Data recorder, 40 column thermal printer, 4K and 16K RAM carts. Less common first party peripherals include a 300 baud cartridge modem, 32k RAM cart, 4 color plotter, and Quick Disk drive.

==Reception==
Although less expensive than the TI-99/4A and VIC-20, the Aquarius had comparatively weak graphics and limited memory. Internally, Mattel programmers adopted Bob Del Principe&#x27;s mock slogan, &quot;Aquarius -a system for the seventies&quot;. Of the 32 software titles Mattel announced for the unit, only 21 were released, most of which were ports of Intellivision games. Because of the hardware limitations of the Aquarius, the quality of many games suffered. There was such a lack of programmable graphics that Mattel added a special character set (see Character set section), so the games could at least use semigraphics.

As a magazine of the time put it, &quot;The Aquarius suffered one of the shortest lifespans of any computer—it was discontinued by Mattel almost as soon as it hit store shelves, a victim of the 1983 home computer price wars.&quot; 

Decades after the spectacular market failure and exceptionally short original product life of the Aquarius, retrocomputing enthusiasts returned to this platform with renewed interest and intrigue, partly due to rarity and hacker interest in working within—and pushing—tight system constraints. Multiple homebrew games were thus published scores of years after-the-fact, and development and niche user interest in Aquarius software continues, using surviving original hardware, FPGA reimplementations, and emulators. In September 2024, all remaining—hitherto missing—Aquarius characters were added to Unicode 16.0, in the Symbols for Legacy Computing Supplement Unicode block.

=== Aquarius II ===
Just after the release of the Aquarius, Mattel had announced plans for the Aquarius II, and there is evidence that the Aquarius II reached the market in small numbers under the &quot;Radofin&quot; brand, but was also not a commercial success. Technically identical to the previous version, the Aquarius II came with a 16 KB RAM extension, mechanical keyboard and Extended Basic.

==Technical specifications==

* CPU: Zilog Z80 @ 3.5 MHz
* Memory: 4K RAM, expandable to 36K RAM; 8K ROM
* Keyboard: 48-key rubber chiclet keyboard
* Display: 80x72 semigraphics (40x24 text characters - with a 25th &quot;zero&quot; row at top - with a size of 8x8 pixels, equivalent to 320 x 192 pixels) in 16 colors (TEA1002 colour encoder)
* Sound: One voice, expandable to four voices
* Ports: Television, cartridge/expansion, tape recorder, printer
* PSU: Non-removable external power supply hard-wired into case providing 8.8 / 16 / -19 VDC

==Peripherals==
Despite its relatively short time on the market, Mattel Electronics and Radofin managed to have most of the announced peripherals available within a month or so of the release of the system. Some products never materialized beyond prototype phase, and some were available only in specific markets. Beginning in 2016, new user-designed peripherals began to show up, mostly on eBay or on vintage computer forums such as AtariAge.

==Interfacing==

The Aquarius manual did not contain details of any of the ports available. The cassette port, although using the same 5-Pin DIN 41524 connector as the TRS-80, did not have the same pin out and thus was incompatible with readily available cables for the TRS-80, even though they physically fit the sockets on both the computer and cassette player. The Aquarius branded cassette deck came with the appropriate cable.

The cassette port a 5-pin female DIN 41524 connector

The MIC and EAR connections from the Aquarius each go to the tip/center of one of the two mini-plugs being attached to the recorder; Ground goes to the base/outside of both mini-plugs.

The printer interface is a mini-stereo socket with 3 lines, the same as on the Mattel Entertainment Computer System. The Aquarius printers came with their own cables. The interface conforms to RS-232 serial signal standards (+12VDC/-12VDC), with the knowledge of the pinout it is possible to interface printers with a corresponding RS-232 interface. The serial is fixed to 1200 baud 8N2 and provided both carriage return and line feed commands to the printer, thus the printer needed to be set to not auto feed with carriage return.

Pin out for the connector on the Aquarius:
Typical serial printers had DB-25 interfaces; some had DE-9 interfaces; and, some Radio Shack (RS) printers had round 4-pin female DIN connector serial interfaces (with the pin sockets numbered left-to-right: 4, 3, 2, 1). The proper cable for connecting such a printer is as follows:

 MINI-STEREO PLUG DB-25 DE-9 RS FUNCTION

 Tip/Center of Plug Pin 3 Pin 2 Pin 4 Data to Printer
 Middle of Plug Pin 20 Pin 4 Pin 2 Printer Busy/Ready 
 Base/Outside Pin 7 Pin 5 Pin 3 Signal Ground

It is one of the most ethnically diverse places in Hong Kong. With only 45% of the population being Chinese, the largest ethnic minority groups in the community is white (25%) and Filipinos (11.2%). DB is located 2 km west of Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and approximately 12 km west from the nearest point on Hong Kong Island.

As of April 2018, Discovery Bay consists of 15 residential development phases with properties ranging from garden houses to low-, mid-and high-rise.

Discovery Bay is a key community in Lantau Island (after Tung Chung) and enjoys a very low plot ratio of 0.15. Pets are allowed in Discovery Bay.
==History==

In May 1973, the Hong Kong Resort Company (HKR) was established by Edward Wong Wing-cheung, a Hong Kong merchant. Following two years of planning and negotiation, a &#x27;Master Plan&#x27; was agreed in December 1975 between HKR and the Hong Kong government. By New Grant No. 6122 of 10 September 1976, HKR agreed The plan called for development, on Lot 385 at Tai Pak Wan, of &quot;membership club houses and a leisure resort and associated facilities which shall include an hotel or hotels ... a cable-car system ... and a non-membership golf course ...&quot; In addition, HKR handed over HK$61.5 million in exchange for the grant and undertook to spend no less than another HK$600 million on development (excluding site formation costs) within 10 years of the grant.

Within months, however, Wong faced financial difficulty. The Soviet-government-controlled Moscow Narodny Bank Limited filed a writ in Hong Kong on 1 April 1977 against Wong himself for return of US$7 million advanced in 1973, as well as against Wong&#x27;s Panamanian bank holding company, Paclantic Financing Co., Inc. (which was HKR&#x27;s majority shareholder), for US$22.12 million in proceedings in Panama. Both the Chinese and British governments were concerned to prevent the property rights to the single largest piece of privately controlled land in Hong Kong falling into the hands of the Russian bank during times of deepening political uncertainty for Hong Kong. Sir David Akers-Jones, then-Secretary for the New Territories, led the government&#x27;s efforts to avert that prospect, steering HKR into the hands of Hong Kong-based Chinese industrialist Cha Chi-ming. It is suspected that Cha decided to bid for the project under the instruction of Liao Chengzhi, then director of China&#x27;s Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office to avoid Soviet acquisition of Hong Kong land.

Having lost control of HKR and facing bankruptcy proceedings, Wong left Hong Kong in January 1977 while mooting the establishment of a Pacific Atlantic Bank of Miami and going into the casino business with the Anderson group of whom one Robert B. Anderson, of One Rockefeller Plaza, had been a fellow director on the HKR board.

Cha Chi-ming, better known for running China Dyeing Works Ltd during the 1970s, an international textile group, acquired equity interest in HKR in 1977. By 1979 all debts were paid off and work started on the reservoir and the core infrastructure but for a very different sort of project – essentially a residential community offering a relaxed lifestyle. This decision was revisited in 2004 when it was discovered that Akers-Jones did not seek approval from the Executive Council (ExCo) for the deviation from the terms of the Land Grant. In a 2004 report by the government&#x27;s Audit Commission, the Lands Department was severely criticised for allowing this to happen, particularly since Akers-Jones did not call on HKR under Cha to pay any additional land premium. After retiring from government, in 2000 Akers-Jones joined the board of Mingly Corporation, also controlled by Cha.

Unlike other large Hong Kong developments, everything in DB was built with private money, including roads, electricity and the water supply. The government-operated fire and police station, community hall and the government-aided primary school were also built by the developer. These developments have to be approved and checked by the government with the official Master Plan version 6.0a in 2003, including the major extension in 2003 in Yi Pak Wan.


== Geography ==

As with most of the terrain in Hong Kong, Lantau Island seems to be a set of hills that rise out of the water. DB is wedged between the hills and the sea and both environments are accessible from the edges of the developed areas. The hills directly behind DB reach up to , and the hiking trails that traverse all the peaks on Lantau Island are accessible from those hills. The hills of Lantau tend to fall dramatically into jungle-covered valleys that spread up into verdant, grass-covered hills. DB has a series of rock pools which lead to one such valley and into a man-made addition to the water-drainage system. (Note: DB has switched to Government potable water supply since 2000)

=== Environment ===
DB is home to animals of many kinds, most of which are domestic pets. There are, however, a number of wild species that lived or are living on Lantau Island that can be found in and around DB. Most of these creatures are birds such as finches, tits, gulls and kites. Until the construction of the new Hong Kong International Airport in Chek Lap Kok, wild cattle and water buffalo thrived in the pasture-like hills. Increasingly vigorous development all over Hong Kong has reduced the habitat of the local dolphin and whale populations. The most famous of these is the Chinese white dolphin, often called the pink dolphin due to a slight pinkish cast to their skin. (See Environment of Hong Kong)

=== Climate ===
Discovery Bay has a sub-tropical climate characterised by distinct seasons. Summers are usually from June to August, with temperatures often within the mid 20s to low 30s Celsius (80s to 90s Fahrenheit) range. Winters start in December and run till February, with temperatures ranging from teens to low 20s Celsius (high 50s to low 70s Fahrenheit).

As DB is a coastal region, typhoon season (May–November) provides a more intense weather experience for residents. Severe tropical storms tend to only occur later in the season, typically August and September. These storms bring torrential rain and strong winds to the region, sometimes leading to a temporary suspension of ferry services to the resort town.

===Environmental awareness===
DB was awarded the Green Property Management Award (Private Housing) in 2002. To make DB a greener town, DBSML, the management company of DB, has replaced conventional ballasts with energy-saving tubes. The number of lights in common corridors and main entrances of buildings were re-assessed and unnecessary lights were removed. It was thought that a 30% reduction in electricity charges was achieved in La Vista, one of the villages. Apart from energy reduction, flea market, old books collection, old clothes collection and used household items collection have been held on a regular basis to promote recycling.

==Current development==

DB was developed in phases and the developer, HKR, envisages that DB will eventually be home to 25,000 residents. The following data applies as of April 2008:

==Community and Culture==
Community life centres on two commercial hubs: DB Plaza and DB North Plaza. DB Plaza features a bus terminus, ferry pier, an open piazza, and a range of shops, medical and dental clinics, and a veterinary surgery. The DB plaza mall was opened in 2021 bringing in lots of external businesses. The two plazas each have a supermarket and a range of international themed restaurants, bars and food outlets.

Amenities include: two schools, a beach at Tai Pak Bay; four private membership recreational clubs including a 27-hole golf course and a marina (previously a residential area for houseboats, but now a premium yacht club); natural streams and rock pools: a bicycle track alongside Discovery Bay Road; an astro-turf football pitch; basketball courts; children&#x27;s playgrounds scattered around the developments and hiking paths leading to other parts of Lantau Island – including the Trappist Haven Monastery and Mui Wo. A Community Centre / Indoor Recreation Centre was finally completed in 2007, seven years after the extended development in Yi Pak was approved. It was handed over to government-appointed operators in April 2009.
;Clubs in DB
(All are private clubs with separate membership fees)
*Discovery Bay Recreation Club and Club Siena (DBRC)
*Lantau Yacht Club (LYC)
*Discovery Bay Golf Club (DBGC)

Housing units in DB used to be sold with a DBRC debenture (and later a right to join the club), although residents can choose whether to be active members and pay a monthly subscription. DBRC members are automatically members of Club Siena. Debentures of DBMC and DBGC are traded in the secondary market.

The Maria opens into Nim Shue Wan, a bay to the south of DB. There is also a public landing stage for cargo boats and privately operated kat-to ferries that link DB to nearby Peng Chau Island and the Trappist Haven Monastery pier about 2 km to the south. There are also Kai-to services connecting to Mui Wo (Silvermine Bay).

Residents also run activities and groups. These include the Lantau Boat Club (a catamaran sailing and outrigger canoe club), Discovery Bay Pirates Rugby Club, and numerous religious services.

Auberge Discovery Bay Hong Kong

The resort hotel on the waterfront of Yi Pak opened in March 2013 complements the resort lifestyle of Discovery Bay. The 325-room resort features an outdoor swimming pool, gym, all-day dining, Spa Botanica, and 1,300 square metres of function space comprising a 700 square metres ballroom and 11 function rooms; all available to suit every need and stay for leisure, meeting, incentive, event, wedding or a special celebration. Opening alongside the hotel is the first-ever seaside glass wedding chapel in Hong Kong. The glamorous white chapel is 16-metre tall, offering a capacity of 100 guests and a sea view as backdrop for weddings.

==Transportation==
DB is connected the rest of Hong Kong via a road tunnel to the North Lantau Expressway and by a ferry service.

All services accept Hong Kong&#x27;s Octopus card.

===Ferries===

There are 3 different ferry routes operating in Discovery Bay:
* A day time ferry service plies between DB Pier on Tai Pak Bay and Pier 3 in Central District on Hong Kong Island (journey time of approximately thirty minutes; frequency of around 15–30 minutes. Current ticket price, paid by Octopus Card, is HKD$46 for adults and HKD$23 for children for a single journey; If using a DB Resident&#x27;s Octopus Card, the prices for adults and children / students will be HKD$33.5 and HKD$16.8 (regular services). Seniors can enjoy the HKD$2 scheme subsidised by the government. Since 2005, ferries have been equipped with free on-board Wi-Fi wireless broadband Internet, which is unique not only in Hong Kong but across Asia.
*Kai-to ferries operated by an independent operator link DB to nearby Peng Chau Island (via Trappist Haven Monastery) and Mui Wo, also on Lantau Island (journey time approximately 10 and 20 minutes respectively)

There are 2 discount package provided by DBTPL. For plan A, there are total 1,550 stored points in transport card for adult at a price of HK$1,310 and 775 for child at a price of HK$655. For plan B, there are 930 stored points in the card for adult and 465 points for child. The prices are HK$858 and HK$429 respectively.

Ferries were the only way to reach Discovery Bay until the opening of the DB Tunnel in 2000 and remain the main way to reach DB from Central. The service is operated by Discovery Bay Transportation Services Ltd (DBTSL), a wholly owned subsidiary of HKR. The route between DB and Central is served by monohull and catamaran waterjets manufactured by Marinteknik in Singapore; seating 300 and 500 passengers respectively.

=== Buses ===
Commuting within DB is done via a 24-hour internal shuttle bus service operated by DBTSL, which runs between various parts of DB and the Bus Terminus by the DB Plaza/the ferry pier. Travelling between the various villages by bus requires a change at the DB Plaza Bus Terminus. The same applies for residents not living on a direct connection to the schools, churches and most of the clubs.

In 2000, a 2.4 km road tunnel linking DB to the North Lantau Expressway opened, enabling access to DB by road – and shortening the journey to other parts of Lantau, Kowloon and the New Territories. From the tunnel&#x27;s inauguration, shuttle bus services ran to Tung Chung and the Hong Kong International Airport in Chek Lap Kok, and shortly after the opening of Hong Kong Disneyland and the Sunny Bay MTR station in June 2005, an additional route between Sunny Bay and DB was launched, further shortening the time to reach Kowloon and New Territories.

The five external bus are operated by Discovery Bay Transit Services Limited (DBTSL), another wholly owned subsidiary of HKRI:
* DB01R: From DB Plaza Bus Terminus to Tung Chung MTR station (journey time approximately 15–20 minutes; frequency of every 20 minutes during day time, every 10 minutes at peak hours) 
* DB01A: From DB(N) Commercial Centre to Tung Chung MTR station (journey time approximately 15–20 minutes; frequency of every 60 minutes during day time, between 10AM to 8PM).
* DB01P: (*Special Service During School Days*) From Discovery College to Tung ChungMTR station via DB North Plaza and Siena Two (journey time approximately 15–20 minutes; This route only operates on school days of Discovery College, first running towards DB in the mornings at 7:30 and 7:45, and in the afternoons running towards Tung Chung at 3:35 and 3:45 respectively. T\
* DB02R: From DB Plaza Bus Terminus to Hong Kong International Airport in Chek Lap Kok (via Cathay City; journey time approximately 20–30 minutes; frequency of every 30 minutes during day time, every 60 minutes at midnight hours, 24-hour service)
* DB03R: From DB Plaza Bus Terminus to Sunny Bay MTR station (journey time approximately 15–20 minutes; frequency of every 20 minutes during day time, every 5–8 minutes at peak hours).
* DB03P: From DB(N) Commercial Centre to Sunny Bay MTR station (journey time approximately 15–20 minutes; frequency of every 30 minutes during day time, every 20 minutes at peak hours).
* DB08R: From No 28, Coastline to Central Ferry Pier 3. an overnight ferry replacement service. 5 buses from 00:15 to 05:00 with the ferry restarting at 06:30. Journey time approximately 60 minutes.
==== Separate night buses ====
* N3/2 – DB Plaza Bus Terminus &lt;&gt; Midvale / Parkvale
* N3/2/7/8 – DB Plaza Bus Terminus &lt;&gt; Midvale / Parkvale / Caperidge / Capevale / Coastline / Capeland
* N5/1/6 – DB Plaza Bus Terminus &lt;&gt; La Serene / Parkland / Headland / Seabee
* N7/8 – DB Plaza Bus Terminus &lt;&gt; Capridge / Capevale / Coastline / Capeland

===Private transport===
Private cars not permitted to enter the area, with a few exceptions for certain agents of the developer, local businesses or for emergency needs and Taxis are only allowed in DB North.

Golf carts are a common mode of transportation for residents within Discovery Bay, however exiting the resort town in a golf cart is not allowed. The number of golf carts is restricted by Hong Kong Transport Department to 500. This has contributed to the exuberant prices of the vehicle, with some buggies selling for more than $2 million HKD.

The presence of golf carts (with a much slower maximum speed than normal private cars) creates a safer road environment than many other places in Hong Kong, especially compared with the road traffic density in other parts of the territory. As such, DB has gained a reputation for its child and pet-friendly environment. Most golf carts run on petrol, however electric models are being introduced.

Residents can also use the hire car service which is operates as a point-to-point minibus shuttle service (e.g. operating on a basis similar to SuperShuttle airport services in the United States). This service only operates within Discovery Bay.

Motorised scooters have gained popularity in recent years, particularly amongst teenagers.

==Education==
A number of schools and colleges operate in Discovery Bay, ranging from kindergartens to secondary schools. This ranges from government-subsidised to private schools.

Discovery Bay is in Primary One Admission (POA) School Net 99, which contains two aided schools: SKH Wei Lun Primary School (聖公會偉倫小學) in Discovery Bay and Holy Family School (聖家學校) in Peng Chau; no government primary schools are in this net.

Schools located within Discovery Bay include

*Discovery Montessori Academy (DMA) offers an IB Montessori education curriculum for children aged 3-12 years old. It is the first IB Montessori accredited school in Hong Kong and Asia.
*Discovery Bay International School (DBIS), built by the developer in 1983. It is an English-language private international kindergarten, primary and early secondary school providing education from nursery to Year 13.
*Discovery College, a primary and secondary &#x27;through-train&#x27; school set up under the government&#x27;s Private Independent Schools scheme. The college opened for the 2008–2009 academic year, currently operating from Year 1 to Year 13.
*SKH Wei Lun Primary School, a Chinese-language government-aided Anglican primary school providing education from Year 1 to Year 6.
*Discovery Mind Primary School, opened in 2012, provided private primary education.
*L&#x27;Ecole Pierre et Marie Curie Education Centre, a French school, offering programmes in French, English and Mandarin, for Year 1 to Year 6 students.

Nursery and kindergartens operating within Discovery Bay include
*Discovery Montessori School (DMS): Located in the North Plaza Unit 101, DMS has earned a strong reputation among families in the area for providing high-quality Montessori education for children aged 1-6 years old.
*Discovery Bay International School (DBIS) Kindergarten, an English-language private international kindergarten;
*Discovery Mind Kindergarten (DMK), a private kindergarten operating Chinese and English sessions; 
*Sunshine House, an English language private international kindergarten; and
*La Petite Enfance Kindergarten, a French-language private international kindergarten.

There are a number of parents that send their children to the schools in Hong Kong Island, Tung Chung and the Kwai Tsing District.

A further site has been earmarked for the development of a Catholic &#x27;through train&#x27; school. However, as of August 2009, this is still at the proposed stage.

==Municipal services==
DB is owned and developed by HKR International Limited (HKRI). Discovery Bay Services Management Limited (DBSML), a subsidiary of HKRI, manages the development. DB used to have its own private water supply from a reservoir and water treatment plant located near the golf course in the mountain valley above the estate. Since DB Tunnel opened in 2000, DB has been connected to the municipal supply from the Water Supplies Department which sources its water both from reservoirs throughout Hong Kong, Lantau Island and the New Territories and from the Pearl River Delta in the mainland. Current municipal facilities inside DB include a fire station and ambulance depot, a post office and a police reporting post. These facilities were built by the developer and services rendered by various government bodies.

With the opening of the DB Tunnel in 2000, the Government deemed the police station and fire station/ambulance depot unnecessary, and DB relies on services provided by the headquarters in Tung Chung. 

==Issues and criticisms==
=== Discovery Bay Marina Club 2018 ===
On 31 August 2018 the Discovery Bay Marina Club (DBMC) gave notice to all 200+ boat owners to vacate the marina permanently by 31 December 2018 for renovations. The majority of these boats were live-a-boards, used by families. The DBMC offered no time line for the renovations or indication that the boats would be allowed to return. A public campaign was started to have the HKRI reverse their decision. Many families went into debt as their &#x27;house boats&#x27; became worthless overnight. The DBMC, rebranded as &quot;Lantau Yacht Club&quot;, was transformed from the family and community friendly club to an exclusive members-only yacht club.

The problem was first foreseen when DBMC lined up all the berth dates and wouldn&#x27;t renew them. The first open move the club did against its members at the time was removing itself from the marine departments official typhoon shelter list just 2 weeks before Typhoon Mangkhut. This stopped boats from being allowed to take shelter within the DBMC breakwater .

===Sports ground===
Discovery bay currently has one artificial turf pitch beside the community centre, located in the north plaza (there is also a pitch located in-between the two Primary schools).

===Transport===
Whereas other parts of Hong Kong are generally well served by frequent transport options from competing operators, DB is served solely by DBTSL and DBTPL, both subsidiaries of HKRI.

====Ferry dispute, 2008–2009====
On 8 October 2008, the sole ferry service operator DBTPL proposed to increase the ferry fares between Discovery Bay and Central up to 64 per cent. A questionnaire received by residents from Discovery Bay Transportation Services proposes an increase of 16 per cent to 64 per cent. The frequency of services would depend on the size of the increase. A single ride now costs HK$27, or HK$23.20 in 50-trip tickets (Child tickets are HK$17.00). Under the lowest fare-rise option, the number of services on weekdays would fall by 113 to just 40. Under this option, ferries would only travel every 70 minutes even during the morning peak. Overnight ferries could also be scrapped in favour of a coach service from Central. Residents also have the choice of taking buses to Sunny Bay and Tung Chung MTR stations. The ferry operator said in a letter to residents that annual fuel expenses had risen from HK$20 million in 2001 to a projected HK$80 million this year and it had been operating at a deficit, with an accumulated loss of more than HK$120 million since 2001.

HKRI has come up with a new proposal which calls for a 27.5% increase (for 50 trip holders) and a 33.3% increase (for single trips). Furthermore, frequencies are to be reduced from 113 sailings a day to 80. After midnight services will be replaced by a coach service. Residents are still concerned that this is still a substantial increase given the current economic situation and fuel prices have fallen below US$50.00. The eventual deal agreed with the Transport Department (TD) was for single fares of HK$31 per journey with an overnight surcharge of HK$13 per journey between 00:00 and 06:00. This represented a general price increase of 10%.

Ferry prices, 2018–2019

A further increase by HKRI was implemented on 10 June 2018. The new cost of a standard ticket from Discovery Bay to Central will rise a further 15% to HK$46 for adults, while the price of a child&#x27;s ticket, aged 1 to below 12, will rise to $23. Overnight, sailings on or after 12:00 midnight and before 6:00 am, will see a +HK$19.50 surcharge. If you were to pay via Octopus Card, the same charges take effect. Senior citizens can enjoy a HK$2 Government Scheme.

A single adult trip using a Transport Card (T-Card) will cost 43.5 stored points, and overnight 66.5 stored points. A child T-Card trip will cost 21.8 stored points, and 44.7 stored points overnight.

As of October 2017, any DB resident including owners, tenants, occupants and domestic helpers can enjoy privileges around Discovery Bay with a registered DB Resident&#x27;s Octopus Card. A single adult trip with this card costs HK$33.5, and HK$50.50 overnight. For children, a single trip costs HK$16.80 and overnight HK$33.8. Again, senior citizens enjoy a HK$2 Government Scheme.

===Construction===
As an ongoing residential development, construction sites, continual renovation work to many increasingly older apartments and the subsequent dust and noise is an ever-present issue in DB. Buildings are generally renovated every seven years, in compliance with the government regulations.

===Environment===
A number of green groups are pushing for the re-introduction of electric golf carts, replacing the current petrol powered golf carts. However, this is being faced with some resistance of the management company and residents as there are other green priorities including upgrading of the buses to Euro standards.

DB suffers few natural disasters, with the exception of typhoons and hillfires as a result of a mixture of dry weather and carelessness.

<text>The ioras are a small family, Aegithinidae, of four passerine bird species found in south and southeast Asia. The family is composed of a single genus, Aegithina. They were formerly grouped with the leafbirds and fairy-bluebirds, in the family Irenidae.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The genus &quot;Aegithina&quot; was introduced in 1816 by the French ornithologist Louis Pierre Vieillot to accommodate the common iora. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;aigithos&quot; or &quot;aiginthos&quot;, a mythical bird mentioned by Aristotle and other classical authors.
The common iora was described in 1758 and given the binomial name &quot;Motacilla tiphia&quot; by Carl Linnaeus, but there was a some confusion about the nature of bird Linnaeus was referring to. Early taxonomists considered it to variously be a warbler, flycatcher, finch or babbler. When G. R. Gray erected the family Aegithinidae in 1869 he included a number of babbler genera in it with the ioras. Edward Blyth, working in the 1850s, was the first to connect the ioras with the leafbirds and fairy-bluebirds, and included all these with the bulbuls.

=== Species of Aegithinidae===
==Description==
The ioras are small to medium small sized passerines, ranging from in length. Overall the males are larger than the females. These are reminiscent of the bulbuls, but whereas that group tends to be drab in colouration, the ioras are more brightly coloured. The group exhibits sexual dimorphism in its plumage, with the males being brightly plumaged in yellows and greens. Unlike the leafbirds, ioras have thin legs, and their bills are proportionately longer. Calls are strident whistles; songs are musical to human ears.

==Habitat and distribution==

Their habitats include acacia scrub, forest edge, and closed forests, as well as agricultural land and (in the common iora) gardens. They are generally lowland birds, with most reaching only as high as the submontane forests. They are generally highly arboreal and usually occur in the tree canopy, with only very rare records of this family coming down to the ground. The family is overwhelmingly non-migratory, although in West India there is some evidence that Marshall&#x27;s ioras and common ioras are partly migratory in the seasonal semi-desert fringe.

==Behaviour and ecology==
Ioras eat insects and spiders, which they find by nimbly gleaning the leaves of the slenderest outer twigs.

In the two species whose male courtship displays are known, they are elaborate, culminating in the males&#x27; parachute-style descent looking like &quot;green balls of fluff&quot;. The nests are compact open cups felted to branches with spiderweb. Females lay 2 or 3 eggs, which have pinkish speckles and red and purple lines. They incubate at night; the males, by day. Incubation lasts about 14 days. Both parents are responsible for brooding and feeding the chicks.

==Relationship with humans==
Ioras will commonly live close to humans and even lives in the suburbs of cites like Singapore. They are mostly not threatened by human activities, although the green iora is listed as near threatened by the IUCN, habitat loss being responsible for its decline. Unlike many other passerines they are not common species in the cage bird trade.

<text>Richard Allen Garriott de Cayeux (&quot;né&quot; Garriott; born 4 July 1961) is a British-born American video game developer, entrepreneur and private astronaut.

Garriott, who is the son of NASA astronaut Owen Garriott, was originally a game designer and programmer, and is now involved in a number of aspects of computer-game development. On October 12, 2008, Garriott flew aboard the Soyuz TMA-13 mission to the International Space Station as a private astronaut, returning 12 days later aboard Soyuz TMA-12. He became the second space traveler, and first from the United States, to have a parent who was also a space traveler. During his ISS flight, he filmed a science fiction movie &quot;Apogee of Fear&quot;.

The creator of the &quot;Ultima&quot; game series, Garriott was involved in all games in the series, and directly supervised all eleven main installments, starting with 1979&#x27;s &quot;&quot; and concluding with 1999&#x27;s &quot;Ultima IX: Ascension&quot;. Within the context of &quot;Ultima&quot;, Garriott presented himself as the fictional persona of Lord British. The series is considered influential, notably helping with establishing the computer role-playing game genre. He founded the video game development company Portalarium in 2009. He was CEO of Portalarium and creative director of &quot;Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues&quot; until 2018 when he shed the title, later relinquishing all &quot;Shroud of the Avatar&quot; assets to Catnip Games in 2019.

== Early life ==
Richard Allen Garriott was born in Cambridge, England on 4 July 1961, to Helen Mary () Garriott (1930–2017) and Owen Garriott, one of NASA&#x27;s first scientist-astronauts (selected in NASA Astronaut Group 4), who flew on Skylab 3 and Space Shuttle mission STS-9. His parents had been high school sweethearts growing up in Enid, Oklahoma. Although both his parents were Americans, Garriott claims dual citizenship for both the United States and the United Kingdom by birth.

Garriott was raised in Nassau Bay, Texas from the age of about two months. Since his childhood, he had dreamed of becoming a NASA astronaut like his father. Eyesight problems discovered at the age of 13 blocked his ambition, however, so he instead came to focus on computer game development.

Garriott&#x27;s &quot;first real exposure to computers&quot; occurred in 1975, during his freshman year at Clear Creek High School. In search of more experience than the single one-semester BASIC class the school offered, and as a fan of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Garriott convinced the school to let him create a self-directed course in programming. He used the course to create fantasy computer games on the school&#x27;s teletype machine. Garriott later estimated that he wrote 28 computer fantasy games during high school.

One of Garriott&#x27;s game pseudonyms is &quot;British&quot;, a name he still uses for various gaming characters, including Ultima character Lord British and &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; character General British. The name was given to him by his first Dungeons and Dragons friends because he was born in the UK.

== Game design career ==
===Early days===
Garriott began writing computer games in 1974. His first games were created on teletype terminals. The code was stored on paper tape spools, and the game was displayed as an ongoing print-out. In summer 1979, Garriott worked at a ComputerLand store where he first encountered Apple computers. Inspired by their video monitors with color graphics, he began to add perspective view to his own games. After he created &quot;&quot; for fun, the owner of the store convinced Garriott it might sell. Garriott spent $200 printing copies of a manual and cover sheet that his mother had drawn, then put copies of the game in Ziploc bags, a common way to sell software at the time. Although Garriott sold fewer than a dozen copies at the store, one copy made it to California Pacific Computer Company, which signed a deal with him. The game sold over 30,000 copies, and Garriott received five dollars for each copy sold. The he earned was three times his father&#x27;s astronaut salary. &quot;Akalabeth&quot; is considered the first published computer role playing game.

Later that year, Garriott entered the University of Texas at Austin (UT). He joined the school&#x27;s fencing team, and later, the Society for Creative Anachronism. He lived at home with his parents while attending university, and from there created &quot;Ultima I&quot; with his friend Ken Arnold. Its cover, and those of several subsequently Garriott games, were painted by Denis Loubet, whose art Garriott discovered during a visit to Steve Jackson Games.

===Origin Systems===
Garriott continued to develop the &quot;Ultima&quot; series of video games in the early 1980s, eventually leaving UT to work on them full time. Originally programmed for the Apple II, the &quot;Ultima&quot; series later became available on several platforms. &quot;Ultima II&quot; was published by Sierra On-Line, as they were the only company that would agree to publish it in a box together with a printed cloth map. By the time he developed &quot;Ultima III&quot;, Garriott, together with his brother Robert, their father Owen and Chuck Bueche established their own video game publisher, Origin Systems, to handle publishing and distribution, in part due to controversy with Sierra over royalties for the PC port of &quot;Ultima II&quot;.

The use of the term &quot;avatar&quot; for the on-screen representation of the user was coined in 1985 by Richard Garriott for the computer game &quot;Ultima IV: Quest of the Avatar&quot;. In this game, Garriott desired the player&#x27;s character to be their Earth self manifested into the virtual world. Due to the ethical content of his story, Garriott wanted the real player to be responsible for their character; he thought only someone playing &quot;themselves&quot; could be properly judged based on their in-game actions. Because of its ethically nuanced narrative approach, he took the Hindu word associated with a deity&#x27;s manifestation on earth in physical form, and applied it to a player in the game world.
Garriott sold Origin Systems to Electronic Arts (EA) in September 1992 for $30 million. In 1997, he coined the term massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), giving a new identity to the nascent genre previously known as graphical MUDs. In 1999 and 2000, EA canceled all of Origin&#x27;s new development projects, including &quot;Privateer Online&quot;, and &quot;Harry Potter Online&quot;. Garriott resigned from the company and formed Destination Games in April 2000 with his brother and Starr Long (the producer of &quot;Ultima Online&quot;).

===NCSoft===
Once Garriott&#x27;s non-compete agreement with EA expired a year later, Destination partnered with NCSoft where Garriott acted as a producer and designer of MMORPGs. After that, he became the CEO of NCSoft Austin, also known as NC Interactive.

&quot;Tabula Rasa&quot; failed to generate much money during its initial release, despite its seven-year development period. On November 24, 2008, NCSoft announced that it planned to end the live service of &quot;Tabula Rasa&quot;. The servers shut down on February 28, 2009, after a period of free play from January 10 onward for existing account holders.

NCSoft fired Garriot in November 2008, but publicly claimed that he left the company voluntarily, resulting in a lawsuit against them. In July 2010, an Austin District Court awarded Garriott US$28 million in his lawsuit against NCSoft, finding that the company did not appropriately handle his departure in 2008. In October 2011, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the judgment.

===Portalarium===
Garriott founded the company Portalarium in 2009, which developed &quot;Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues&quot;, a spiritual successor to the &quot;Ultima&quot; series. Garriott remarked that had they been able to secure the intellectual property rights to &quot;Ultima&quot; from EA, the game could have become &quot;Ultima Online 2&quot;. On March 8, 2013, Portalarium launched a Kickstarter campaign for &quot;Shroud of the Avatar: Forsaken Virtues&quot;. An early access version of the game was released on Steam in 2014, and the game was fully released in March 2018. The game received &quot;mixed or average&quot; reviews from critics. In October 2019, the assets and rights to &quot;Shroud of the Avatar&quot; were sold to Catnip Games, a company owned by Portalarium CEO Chris Spears. Garriott is no longer associated with either company.

===Current===
In April 2022 he announced he had begun working on a new fantasy MMO that uses NFT technology with long-time contributor Todd Porter. In August 2022, the game was announced as &quot;Iron and Magic&quot;. However, in May 2023, it was reported that the game&#x27;s official website has vanished and its Facebook page has lied dormant since September 2022, leading to many speculations regarding the status of the game.

== Private astronaut ==
In 1983, &quot;Softline&quot; reported that &quot;Garriott wants to go into space but doesn&#x27;t see it happening in the predictable future ... He has frequently joked with his father about stowing away on a spaceship, and recently his speculations have been sounding uncomfortably realistic&quot;. The income from the success of Garriott&#x27;s video game career allowed him to pursue his interest in spaceflight. After the sale of Origin Systems, he invested in Space Adventures and purchased a ticket to become the first private citizen to fly into space. Due to financial setbacks in 2001 after the dot-com bubble burst, however, he was forced to sell his seat to Dennis Tito.

Garriott then returned to creating games; once he had accumulated sufficient funds, he put down another non-refundable deposit. During his mandatory medical examination a hemangioma was discovered on his liver, which could cause potentially fatal internal bleeding in the event of a rapid spacecraft depressurization. Given the choice of forfeiting his deposit or undergoing surgical removal of the angioma, he decided to have the surgery.
On September 28, 2007, Space Adventures announced that Garriott would fly to the International Space Station in October 2008 as a self-funded Private Astronaut at a reported cost of $30 million. On October 12, 2008, after a year of training in Russia, Garriott became the second second-generation space traveler (after Sergei Volkov), the first offspring of an American astronaut to go into space, and the second person to wear the British Union flag in space. His father, Owen Garriott, was at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan for the launch, and was in attendance when he landed safely, along with Russian cosmonauts Sergei Volkov and Oleg Kononenko, twelve days later.
During his spaceflight, Garriott took part in several education outreach efforts. The free Metro newspaper in London provided him with a special edition containing details of British primary school students&#x27; space experiment concepts that Garriott took to the ISS. The Metro has claimed, as a result, that it was the first newspaper in space. He communicated with students and other Amateur Radio operators and transmitted photographs using the Amateur Radio on the International Space Station (ARISS) slow-scan television system, and placed a geocache while aboard the ISS.

Garriott worked with the Windows on Earth project, which provides an interactive, virtual view of Earth as seen from the ISS. Garriott used Windows on Earth software to assist in the selection of locations on Earth to photograph, and the public were able to use the same online tool to track the ISS and see the view Garriott was experiencing. Garriott&#x27;s photographs, along with images taken by his astronaut father Owen Garriott in 1973, will be available to the public through Windows on Earth, adding a personal element to studies of Earth and how Earth has changed over time.

Garriott covertly smuggled a portion of the ashes of Star Trek actor James Doohan on a laminated card, which he placed under the floor cladding of the ISS&#x27;s Columbus module. This action was kept secret until Christmas Day 2020 when Doohan&#x27;s son made the fact public on his Twitter account. At the time of the reveal, Doohan&#x27;s ashes had orbited the Earth more than 70,000 times and traveled more than 1.7 billion miles.

Garriott&#x27;s film &quot;Apogee of Fear&quot; was the first ever fictional (short) film fully filmed in space (whereas &quot;Return from Orbit&quot; was only partially filmed in space). Tracy Hickman wrote the screenplay.

In 2010 he was featured in a documentary, &quot;Man on a Mission: Richard Garriott&#x27;s Road to the Stars&quot;, which covered his spaceflight training and mission into orbit.

== Other exploration ==

In January 2021, Garriott was elected president of The Explorers Club.
In February 2021, Garriott traveled to the bottom of the Mariana Trench, the deepest oceanic trench on the planet. While there, as well as performing scientific duties, he placed a geocache and recorded another short sci-fi film. This made him the holder of both altitude and depth records for these activities.

== Other accomplishments and interests ==
In 1986, Garriott helped start the Challenger Center for Space Science Education with his high school science teacher, June Scobee Rodgers, widow of Challenger Shuttle Commander Dick Scobee, who piloted the ill-fated STS-51-L mission. Scobee Rodgers drew on Garriott&#x27;s early leadership in gaming to help design what have become approximately 50 global interactive networked facilities, where students perform simulated space missions.

Garriott bought the Luna 21 lander and the Lunokhod 2 rover (both currently on the lunar surface) from the Lavochkin Association for $68,500 in December 1993 at a Sotheby&#x27;s auction in New York. (The catalog incorrectly lists lot 68A as Luna 17/Lunokhod 1.) Garriott notes that while UN treaties ban governmental ownership of property on other celestial bodies, corporations and private citizens retain such rights. Lunokhod 2 is still in use, with mirrors aligned to reflect lasers such that precise Earth-Moon distances can be measured. With his vehicle still in use, Garriott claims property rights to the territory surveyed by Lunokhod 2. This may be the first valid claim for private ownership of extraterrestrial territory. Lunokhod 2 held the record for distance traveled on the surface of another planetary body until it was surpassed by NASA&#x27;s Opportunity Rover in 2014.

From 1988 to 1994 Garriott built a haunted house/museum every other year at Britannia Manor, his residence in Austin, Texas. Garriott&#x27;s haunted houses cost tens of thousands of dollars to create each year and took many months and a sizable team to construct, yet were free to the public.

Garriott promotes private space flight and served as vice-chairman of the board of directors for Space Adventures. He is also a trustee of the X PRIZE Foundation.

Garriott participated in the first zero gravity wedding on June 20, 2009, with his wife Laetitia Garriott de Cayeux. The wedding took place in a specially modified Boeing 727-200 aircraft, G-Force One, operated by a company Garriott co-founded, Zero Gravity Corporation.

Garriott wrote a memoir (with David Fisher) covering his accomplishments in games publishing and spaceflight, entitled &quot;Explore/Create: My Life in Pursuit of New Frontiers, Hidden Worlds, and the Creative Spark&quot;. It was published on January 10, 2017.

Garriott was the inspiration for the character James Halliday in Ernest Cline&#x27;s &quot;Ready Player One&quot;.

<text>Young is a town in the South Western Slopes region of New South Wales, Australia, and the largest town in the Hilltops Region. The &quot;Lambing Flat&quot; Post Office opened on 1 March 1861 and was renamed &quot;Young&quot; in 1863.

Young is marketed as the Cherry Capital of Australia and every year hosts the National Cherry Festival. Young is situated on the Olympic Highway and is approximately two hours&#x27; drive from the Canberra area. It is in a valley, with surrounding hills. The town is named after Sir John Young, the governor of NSW from 1861 to 1867.

==History==

Before European settlers arrived in Young, members of the Burrowmunditory tribe, a family group of the indigenous Wiradjuri Nation, lived in the region. Descendants of the Burrowmunditory clan still live in Young.

James White was the first European settler in the district and established &#x27;Burrangong&#x27; station in 1826 with a squatting claim of . His story is told in the novel &quot;Brothers in Exile&quot;.

In late June 1860 Michael Sheedy from Binalong, and a group of other stockmen, were on James White&#x27;s &#x27;Burrangong&#x27; pastoral run looking for horses. The sheltered area known as &#x27;Lambing Flat&#x27; lay along a creek between heavily timbered hills. Stock yards had been built there and used to enclose strayed and wild horses from the surrounding country. The cook for the party, an American, &quot;who was familiar with the appearance of many other goldfields, was struck with the appearance of the place&quot;. The cook washed several spadefuls of earth &quot;and succeeded in getting a good prospect of gold&quot;. After procuring the horses the men returned to Binalong, 32 miles to the south-east, and after a few days Sheedy and six men returned with tools and provisions, &quot;determined to test the auriferous quality of the place&quot;. The second dishful washed by the men produced a nugget of seven pennyweight. By late July 1860 word had spread and there were about fifty persons at Lambing Flat who had joined the search for gold.

From November 1860 through to June 1861, anti-Chinese miners attacked Chinese gold miners in the area, now known as the infamous Lambing Flat riots. As gold became scarce, European miners began to resent what they saw as the greater success of the more industrious Chinese, and hence many Chinese miners were attacked, robbed and killed. The anti-Chinese rebels rallied in numbers of up to 3,000. Eventually the rioters were controlled, Chinese miners had their claims restored to them, but the New South Wales Parliament passed the Chinese Immigration Bill which restricted the number of Chinese that could be brought into New South Wales on any ship and imposed a tax per head on entry.

The town of Young was gazetted in 1861. The goldfields produced of gold sent by escort from the fields. Up to 20,000 miners worked the fields including about 2,000 Chinese miners.

Later in the 1860s, some Chinese, who remained in the district, ran intensive and successful market gardens, supplying Young and other towns, even as far away as Wagga.

The town was incorporated in 1882, with miller, Peter Cram, the first mayor.

In 1889 Young was the first town in Australia to install electricity into the streets and homes of the township; Tamworth NSW had installed electricity to the streets only the previous year.

The former Young Shire was acknowledged as the first Local Government Area to institute a rural school bus system in New South Wales.

==The Lambing Flat Chinese Tribute Gardens==

Young Shire Council established the Lambing Flat Chinese Tribute Gardens adjacent to the site of Chinamans Dam, an old railway dam approximately south of Young. The gardens are intended to create an ambience similar to the Japanese Gardens at Cowra. Chinamans Dam, with an initial capacity of over when it was in railway use, is situated at a hamlet called Pitstone on Sawpit Gully. The dam was built in the 1860s by German brothers (from Hannover), Herman and John Tiedemann, to provide water for the sluicing of their Victoria Hill gold claims. At some time in the 1870s, the brothers sold the area, including the dam, to a Chinese group who worked the site.

The dam was used as a railway facility from 1882 when the NSW Railway Commissioners gave notice of the intention to build the first part of the Blayney-Demondrille railway. To provide water for its steam locomotives, the Commissioners decided to provide a dam and pump water from it to a facility, known as Young Tank, at the post. It is not known whether the railways enhanced the existing dam or built a new facility.

From 1885 to 1901, locomotives stopped at Young Tank to replenish their water. In 1901, watering facilities were built at Young Station. The supply of water was obtained from Chinamans Dam. The capacity of the dam was enlarged in 1911. The dam was a popular spot for swimming and, whilst officially frowned upon, was tolerated.

Following the connection to the South West Tablelands Water Supply Scheme, which provided water from Burrinjuck Dam, the railways ceased to draw water from Chinamans Dam after 1936. The site was returned to the Crown in 1962 and in the following year, a reserve was established and the Shire Council were appointed as trustees. The dam has since been enlarged.
