<text>Duke of Argyll () is a title created in the peerage of Scotland in 1701 and in the peerage of the United Kingdom in 1892. The earls, marquesses, and dukes of Argyll were for several centuries among the most powerful noble families in Scotland. As such, they played a major role in Scottish history throughout the 16th, 17th, and 18th centuries. The Duke of Argyll also holds the hereditary titles of chief of Clan Campbell and Master of the Household of Scotland.

Since 2001, Torquhil Campbell has been Duke of Argyll and is the thirteenth man to hold the title.

==History==
Sir Colin Campbell of Lochow was knighted in 1280. In 1445 James II of Scotland raised Sir Colin&#x27;s descendant Sir Duncan Campbell to the peerage to become Duncan Campbell of Lochow, Lord of Argyll, Knight, 1st Lord Campbell. Colin Campbell (c. 1433–1493) succeeded his grandfather as the 2nd Lord Campbell in 1453 and was created Earl of Argyll in 1457.

The 8th Earl of Argyll was created a marquess in 1641, when Charles I visited Scotland and attempted to quell the rising political crisis (and the fall-out from the event known as The Incident). With Oliver Cromwell&#x27;s victory in England, the marquess became the effective ruler of Scotland. Upon the restoration, the marquess offered his services to King Charles II but was charged with treason and executed in 1661. His lands and titles were forfeited but in 1663, they were restored to his son, Archibald, who became the 9th Earl of Argyll. In 1685 the 9th Earl was executed for his part in the Monmouth rebellion.

On 21 June 1701 the 9th Earl&#x27;s son was created &quot;Duke of Argyll, Marquess of Kintyre and Lorne, Earl of Campbell and Cowal, Viscount of Lochow and Glenyla, Lord Inveraray, Mull, Morvern, and Tiree&quot; for his services to William of Orange. His son, the 2nd Duke, was created Baron Chatham and Earl of Greenwich in 1705 as a reward for his support for the Act of Union and further elevated to the title Duke of Greenwich in 1719. Upon his death his Scottish titles passed to his brother and the English titles became extinct.

The 5th Duke sat as a member of parliament for Glasgow Burghs until his father&#x27;s accession to the Dukedom in 1761 disqualified him from representing a Scottish seat. He then became the member for Dover until 1766, when he was created Baron Sundridge and obtained the right to sit in the House of Lords.

On 17 April 1892, the 8th Duke was created Duke of Argyll in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. Thus, the Duke is one of only five people to hold two or more different dukedoms, the others being the Duke of Cornwall and Rothesay, the Duke of Buccleuch and Queensberry, the Duke of Hamilton and Brandon, and the Duke of Richmond, Lennox, and Gordon.

During the 19th century, a distant Prussian descendant of the family, Jenny von Westphalen, became the wife of the philosopher Karl Marx. In a famous story, when exiled to Paris and reduced to poverty, Marx was nearly arrested for attempting to pawn a part of Jenny&#x27;s dowry: a silver dinner service bearing the coat of arms of the House of Argyll. Of the incident Marx wrote to Engels, possibly in an attempt to solicit another loan from his wealthy friend: &quot;My wife cried all night&quot;. However, the silver was eventually sold to pay off long-standing debts incurred by the &quot;Neue Rheinische Zeitung&quot;.

In the late 19th century the then current Duke of Argyll visited America. While there, he stayed at the American Hotel situated in the main square of the village of Babylon, New York. The townspeople took a liking to the duke, and festivals and parades took place while he visited there. Just before the turn of the century (1900) the township of Babylon renamed the Bythbourne Lake/Park to Argyle Lake/Park (Argyll evolved to the currently accepted Argyle) in memory of the duke&#x27;s visit.

==Family seats and abodes==

The family seat is Inveraray Castle beside Loch Fyne, Inveraray, Argyll. The estate, 75,000 acres, is a mixture of commercial forestry, residential property, sources of renewable energy, and a caravan park.

The principal burial place of the Dukes and Duchesses is St Munn&#x27;s Parish Church, Kilmun. The 11th and the 12th Dukes chose to be buried on the island of Inishail in Loch Awe.

In 1706 John Campbell, second Duke of Argyll, became the inhabitant of a house on the east side of King Street, St James (Soho end), Westminster, London which stood on a site occupied by the western end of Little Argyll Street which in 1735 or 1736 he vacated for redevelopment. A succession of Argyll Houses followed in the same block of streets In 1808 the 6th Duke sold the latter-day House to the 4th Earl of Aberdeen.

In and before 1764 the family had a house near to London at Ham which was then in the county of Surrey, a parish historically associated with Richmond, and a nearby second holding, see map above left.

==Subsidiary titles==
The Duke holds several subsidiary titles, including: &quot;Marquess of Kintyre and Lorne&quot; (created 1701), &quot;Earl of Argyll&quot; (created 1457), &quot;Earl Campbell and Cowall&quot; and &quot;Viscount Lochow and Glenyla&quot; (created 1701), &quot;Lord Campbell&quot; (created 1445), &quot;Lord Lorne&quot; (created 1470), &quot;Lord Kintyre&quot; (created 1626), &quot;Lord Inveraray, Mull, Mover and Tiry&quot; (created 1701), &quot;Baron Hamilton of Hameldon&quot; (created 1776) and &quot;Baron Sundridge&quot; (created 1766). They are in the Peerage of Scotland, except the last two, which are in the Peerage of Great Britain. The Duke is also a &quot;Baronet of Lundie&quot; (created 1627) in the Baronetage of Nova Scotia. The courtesy title for the Duke&#x27;s eldest son and heir is &quot;Marquess of Lorne&quot;, shortened from &quot;Marquess of Kintyre and Lorne&quot;.

The Duke of Argyll is also the chief of the Scottish clan of Campbell and in this capacity is known as &quot;MacCailein Mòr&quot;, which is Gaelic for &quot;The Great MacColin&quot; referring to Cailean Mór (Colin the Great) of Lochawe (Colin of Lochow) who was killed in fighting with Alexander, Lord of Lorne in 1296.

Since James IV&#x27;s reign, the Duke has also held the position of Master of the Household of Scotland.

<text>The science of epidemiology has matured significantly from the times of Hippocrates, Semmelweis and John Snow. The techniques for gathering and analyzing epidemiological data vary depending on the type of disease being monitored but each study will have overarching similarities.

==Outline of the process of an epidemiological study==
# Establish that a problem exists
#* Full epidemiological studies are expensive and laborious undertakings. Before any study is started, a case must be made for the importance of the research.
# Confirm the homogeneity of the events
#* Any conclusions drawn from inhomogeneous cases will be suspicious. All events or occurrences of the disease must be true cases of the disease.
# Collect all the events
#* It is important to collect as much information as possible about each event in order to inspect a large number of possible risk factors. The events may be collected from varied methods of epidemiological study or from censuses or hospital records.
#* The events can be characterized by Incidence rates and prevalence rates.
#* Often, occurrence of a single disease entity is set as an event.
#* Given inherent heterogeneous nature of any given disease (i.e., the unique disease principle), a single disease entity may be treated as disease subtypes. This framework is well conceptualized in the interdisciplinary field of molecular pathological epidemiology (MPE).
# Characterize the events as to epidemiological factors
## Predisposing factors
##* Non-environmental factors that increase the likelihood of getting a disease. Genetic history, age, and gender are examples.
## Enabling/disabling factors
##* Factors relating to the environment that either increase or decrease the likelihood of disease. Exercise and good diet are examples of disabling factors. A weakened immune system and poor nutrition are examples of enabling factors.
## Precipitation factors
##* This factor is the most important in that it identifies the source of exposure. It may be a germ, toxin or gene.
## Reinforcing factors
##* These are factors that compound the likelihood of getting a disease. They may include repeated exposure or excessive environmental stresses.
# Look for patterns and trends
#* Here one looks for similarities in the cases which may identify major risk factors for contracting the disease. Epidemic curves may be used to identify such risk factors.
# Formulate a hypothesis
#* If a trend has been observed in the cases, the researcher may postulate as to the nature of the relationship between the potential disease-causing agent and the disease.
# Test the hypothesis
#* Because epidemiological studies can rarely be conducted in a laboratory the results are often polluted by uncontrollable variations in the cases. This often makes the results difficult to interpret. Two methods have evolved to assess the strength of the relationship between the disease causing agent and the disease.
#* Koch&#x27;s postulates were the first criteria developed for epidemiological relationships. Because they only work well for highly contagious bacteria and toxins, this method is largely out of favor.
#* Bradford-Hill Criteria are the current standards for epidemiological relationships. A relationship may fill all, some, or none of the criteria and still be true.
# Publish the results.

== Measures ==
Epidemiologists are famous for their use of rates. Each measure serves to characterize the disease giving valuable information about contagiousness, incubation period, duration, and mortality of the disease.

=== Measures of occurrence ===
# Incidence measures
## Incidence rate, where cases included are defined using a case definition
## Hazard rate
## Cumulative incidence
# Prevalence measures
## Point prevalence
## Period prevalence

=== Measures of association ===
# Relative measures
## Risk ratio
## Rate ratio
## Odds ratio
## Hazard ratio
# Absolute measures
## Absolute risk reduction
## Attributable risk
### Attributable risk in exposed
### Percent attributable risk
### Levin&#x27;s attributable risk

=== Other measures ===
# Virulence and Infectivity
# Mortality rate and Morbidity rate
# Case fatality
# Sensitivity (tests) and Specificity (tests)

==Limitations==
Epidemiological (and other observational) studies typically highlight &quot;associations&quot; between exposures and outcomes, rather than causation. While some consider this a limitation of observational research, epidemiological models of causation (e.g. Bradford Hill criteria) contend that an entire body of evidence is needed before determining if an association is truly causal. Moreover, many research questions are impossible to study in experimental settings, due to concerns around ethics and study validity. For example, the link between cigarette smoke and lung cancer was uncovered largely through observational research; however research ethics would certainly prohibit conducting a randomized trial of cigarette smoking once it had already been identified as a potential health threat.

<text>The Art of Fugue, or The Art of the Fugue (), BWV 1080, is an incomplete musical work of unspecified instrumentation by Johann Sebastian Bach. Written in the last decade of his life, &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; is the culmination of Bach&#x27;s experimentation with monothematic instrumental works.

This work consists of fourteen fugues and four canons in D minor, each using some variation of a single principal subject, and generally ordered to increase in complexity. &quot;The governing idea of the work&quot;, as put by Bach specialist Christoph Wolff, &quot;was an exploration in depth of the contrapuntal possibilities inherent in a single musical subject.&quot; The word &quot;contrapunctus&quot; is often used for each fugue.

== Sources ==

=== Mus. ms. autogr. P 200 ===

The earliest extant source of the work is an autograph manuscript possibly written from 1740 to 1746, usually referred to by its call number as Mus. ms. autogr. P 200 in the Berlin State Library. Bearing the title &quot;Die / Kunst der Fuga &quot;&quot; / di Sig&quot;[&quot;nore&quot;]&quot; Joh. Seb. Bach&quot;, which was written by Bach&#x27;s son-in-law Johann Christoph Altnickol, followed by &quot;(in eigenhändiger Partitur)&quot; written by , the autograph contains twelve untitled fugues and two canons arranged in a different order than in the first printed edition, with the absence of &quot;Contrapunctus 4&quot;, &quot;Fuga a 2 clav&quot; (two-keyboard version of &quot;Contrapunctus 13&quot;), &quot;Canon alla decima&quot;, and &quot;Canon alla duodecima&quot;.

The autograph manuscript presents the then-untitled &quot;Contrapuncti&quot; and canons in the following order: [&quot;Contrapunctus 1&quot;], [&quot;Contrapunctus 3&quot;], [&quot;Contrapunctus 2&quot;], [&quot;Contrapunctus 5&quot;], [&quot;Contrapunctus 9&quot;], an early version of [&quot;Contrapunctus 10&quot;], [&quot;Contrapunctus 6&quot;], [&quot;Contrapunctus 7&quot;], &quot;Canon in Hypodiapason&quot; with its two-stave solution &quot;Resolutio Canonis&quot; (entitled &quot;Canon alla Ottava&quot; in the first printed edition), [&quot;Contrapunctus 8&quot;], [&quot;Contrapunctus 11&quot;], &quot;Canon in Hypodiatesseron, al roversio &quot;&quot; e per augmentationem, perpetuus&quot; presented in two staves and then on one, [&quot;Contrapunctus 12&quot;] with the &quot;inversus&quot; form of the fugue written directly below the &quot;rectus&quot; form, [&quot;Contrapunctus 13&quot;] with the same &quot;rectus&quot;–&quot;inversus&quot; format, and a two-stave &quot;Canon al roverscio et per augmentationem&quot;—a second version of &quot;Canon in Hypodiatesseron&quot;.

=== Mus. ms. autogr. P 200, Beilage ===

Bundled with the primary autograph are three supplementary manuscripts, each affixed to a composition that would appear in the first printed edition. Referred to as Mus. ms. autogr. P 200/Beilage 1, Mus. ms. autogr. P 200/Beilage 2, and Mus. ms. autogr. P 200/Beilage 3, they are written under the title &quot;Die Kunst / der Fuga / von J.S.B.&quot;

Mus. ms. autogr. P 200, Beilage 1 contains a final preparatory revision of the &quot;Canon in Hypodiatesseron&quot;, under the title &quot;Canon p&quot;[&quot;er&quot;] &quot;Augmentationem contrario Motu&quot; crossed out. The manuscript contains line break and page break information for the engraving process, most of which was transcribed in the first printed edition. Written on the top region of the manuscript is a note written by Johann Christoph Friedrich Bach:

Mus. ms. autogr. P 200, Beilage 2 contains two-keyboard arrangements of &quot;Contrapunctus 13 inversus&quot; and &quot;rectus&quot;, entitled &quot;Fuga a 2. Clav:&quot; and &quot;Alio modo Fuga a 2 Clav.&quot; in the first printed edition respectively. Like Beilage 1, the manuscript served as a preparatory edition for the first printed edition.

Mus. ms. autogr. P 200, Beilage 3 contains a fragment of a three-subject fugue, which would be later called &quot;Fuga a 3 Soggetti&quot; in the first printed edition. Unlike the fugues written in the primary autograph, the &quot;Fuga&quot; is presented in a two-stave keyboard system, instead of with individual staves for each voice. The fugue abruptly breaks off on the fifth page, specifically on the 239th measure and ends with the note written by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach: &quot;.&quot; (&quot;At the point where the composer introduces the name BACH [for which the English notation would be B–A–C–B] in the countersubject to this fugue, the composer died.&quot;) The following page contains a list of errata by Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach for the first printed edition (pages 21–35).

=== First and second printed editions ===

The first printed version was published under the title &quot;Die / Kunst der Fuge / durch / Herrn Johann Sebastian Bach / ehemahligen Capellmeister und Musikdirector zu Leipzig&quot; in May 1751, slightly less than a year after Bach&#x27;s death. In addition to changes in the order, notation, and material of pieces which appeared in the autograph, it contained two new fugues, two new canons, and three pieces of ostensibly spurious inclusion. A second edition was published in 1752, but differed only in its addition of a preface by Friedrich Wilhelm Marpurg.

In spite of its revisions, the printed edition of 1751 contained a number of glaring editorial errors. The majority of these may be attributed to Bach&#x27;s relatively sudden death in the midst of publication. Three pieces were included that do not appear to have been part of Bach&#x27;s intended order: an unrevised (and thus redundant) version of the second double fugue, Contrapunctus X; a two-keyboard arrangement of the first mirror fugue, Contrapunctus XIII; and an organ chorale prelude on &quot;&quot; (&quot;Herewith I come before Thy Throne&quot;), derived from BWV 668a, and noted in the introduction to the edition as a recompense for the work&#x27;s incompleteness, having purportedly been dictated by Bach on his deathbed.

The anomalous character of the published order and the Unfinished Fugue, have engendered a wide variety of theories which attempt to restore the work to the state originally intended by Bach.

== Structure ==
&quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; is based on a single subject, which each canon and fugue employs in some variation:

&lt;score sound=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
 \relative c&quot; { \set Staff.midiInstrument = #&quot;church organ&quot;
 \clef treble
 \key d \minor
 \time 4/4
 d,2 a&#x27; |
 f d |
 cis d4 e |
 f2~ f8 g f e |
 d4
&lt;/score&gt;

The work divides into seven groups, according to each piece&#x27;s prevailing contrapuntal device; in both editions, these groups and their respective components are generally ordered to increase in complexity. In the order in which they occur in the printed edition of 1751 (without the aforementioned works of spurious inclusion), the groups, and their components are as follows.

Simple fugues:

* &quot;Contrapunctus 1&quot;: four-voice fugue on principal subject
* &quot;Contrapunctus 2&quot;: four-voice fugue on principal subject, accompanied by a &#x27;French&#x27; style dotted rhythm
* &quot;Contrapunctus 3&quot;: four-voice fugue on principal subject in inversion, employing intense chromaticism
* &quot;Contrapunctus 4&quot;: four-voice fugue on principal subject in inversion, employing counter-subjects

Stretto-fugues (counter-fugues), in which the subject is used simultaneously in regular, inverted, augmented, and diminished forms:

* &quot;Contrapunctus 5&quot;: has many stretto entries, as do &quot;Contrapuncti 6&quot; and &quot;7&quot;
* &quot;Contrapunctus 6, a 4 in Stylo Francese&quot;: adds both forms of the theme in diminution, (halving note lengths), with little rising and descending clusters of semiquavers in one voice answered or punctuated by similar groups in demisemiquavers in another, against sustained notes in the accompanying voices. The dotted rhythm, enhanced by these little rising and descending groups, suggests what is called &quot;French style&quot; in Bach&#x27;s day, hence the name &quot;Stylo Francese&quot;.
* &quot;Contrapunctus 7, a 4 per Augment&quot;[&quot;ationem&quot;] &quot;et Diminut&quot;[&quot;ionem&quot;]: uses augmented (doubling all note lengths) and diminished versions of the main subject and its inversion.

Double and triple fugues, employing two and three subjects respectively:

* &quot;Contrapunctus 8, a 3&quot;: triple fugue with three subjects, having independent expositions
* &quot;Contrapunctus 9, a 4, alla Duodecima&quot;: double fugue, with two subjects occurring dependently and in invertible counterpoint at the twelfth
* &quot;Contrapunctus 10, a 4, alla Decima&quot;: double fugue, with two subjects occurring dependently and in invertible counterpoint at the tenth
* &quot;Contrapunctus 11, a 4&quot;: triple fugue, employing the three subjects of Contrapunctus 8 in inversion

Mirror fugues, in which a piece is notated once and then with voices and counterpoint completely inverted, without violating contrapuntal rules or musicality:

* &quot;Contrapunctus inversus 12 a 4&quot; [&quot;forma inversa&quot; and &quot;recta&quot;]
* &quot;Contrapunctus inversus 13 a 3&quot; [&quot;forma recta&quot; and &quot;inversa&quot;]

Canons, labeled by interval and technique:

* &quot;Canon per Augmentationem in Contrario Motu&quot;: Canon in which the following voice is both inverted and augmented. The following voice, running at half-speed, eventually lags the first voice by 20 bars, making the canon effect hard to hear. Three versions have appeared in the autograph Mus. ms. autogr. P 200: &quot;Canon in Hypodiatesseron, al roversio &quot;&quot; e per augmentationem, perpetuus&quot;, &quot;Canon al roverscio et per augmentationem&quot;, and &quot;Canon p. Augmentationem contrario Motu&quot;, the third of which appears on the second supplemental &quot;Beilage&quot;.
* &quot;Canon alla Ottava&quot;: canon in imitation at the octave; titled &quot;Canon in Hypodiapason&quot; in Mus. ms. autogr. P 200.
* &quot;Canon alla Decima&quot; [&quot;in&quot;] &quot;Contrapunto alla Terza&quot;: canon in imitation at the tenth
* &quot;Canon alla Duodecima in Contrapunto alla Quinta&quot;: canon in imitation at the twelfth

Alternate variants and arrangements:

* &quot;Contra&quot;[&quot;punctus&quot;] &quot;a 4&quot;: alternate version of the last 22 bars of &quot;Contrapunctus 10&quot;.
* &quot;Fuga a 2 Clav:&quot; and &quot;Alio modo. Fuga a 2 Clav.&quot;: two-keyboard arrangements of &quot;Contrapunctus inversus a 3&quot;, the &quot;forma inversa&quot; and &quot;recta&quot;, respectively.

Incomplete fugue:

* [Contrapunctus 14] &quot;Fuga a 3 Soggetti&quot;: four-voice triple fugue (not completed by Bach, but likely to have become a quadruple fugue: see below), the third subject of which begins with the BACH motif, B–A–C–B (&#x27;H&#x27; in German letter notation).

== Instrumentation ==

Both editions of the &quot;Art of Fugue&quot; are written in open score, where each voice is written on its own staff. This has led some to conclude that the &quot;Art of Fugue&quot; was intended as an intellectual exercise, meant to be studied more than heard. The renowned keyboardist Gustav Leonhardt argued that the &quot;Art of Fugue&quot; was intended to be played on a keyboard instrument, and specifically the harpsichord. Leonhardt&#x27;s arguments included the following:
# It was common practice in the 17th and early 18th centuries to publish keyboard pieces in open score, especially those that are contrapuntally complex. Examples include Frescobaldi&#x27;s &quot;Fiori musicali&quot; (1635), Samuel Scheidt&#x27;s &quot;Tabulatura Nova&quot; (1624), works by Johann Jakob Froberger (1616–1667), Franz Anton Maichelbeck (1702–1750), and others.
#The range of none of the ensemble or orchestral instruments of the period corresponds to any of the ranges of the voices in &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;. Furthermore, none of the melodic shapes that characterize Bach&#x27;s ensemble writing are found in the work, and there is no basso continuo.
#The fugue types used are reminiscent of the types in &quot;The Well-Tempered Clavier&quot;, rather than Bach&#x27;s ensemble fugues; Leonhardt also shows an &quot;optical&quot; resemblance between the fugues of the two collections, and points out other stylistic similarities between them.
#Finally, since the bass voice in &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot; occasionally rises above the tenor, and the tenor becomes the &quot;real&quot; bass, Leonhardt deduces that the bass part was not meant to be doubled at 16-foot pitch, thus eliminating the pipe organ as the intended instrument, leaving the harpsichord as the most logical choice.

It is now generally accepted by scholars that the work was envisioned for keyboard. 

== &quot;Fuga a 3 Soggetti&quot; ==

&quot;Fuga a 3 Soggetti&quot; (&quot;fugue in three subjects&quot;), also called the &quot;Unfinished Fugue&quot; and Contrapunctus 14, was contained in a handwritten manuscript bundled with the autograph manuscript Mus. ms. autogr. P 200. It breaks off abruptly in the middle of its third section, with an only partially written measure 239. This autograph carries a note in the handwriting of Carl Philipp Emanuel Bach, stating &quot;Über dieser Fuge, wo der Name B A C H im Contrasubject angebracht worden, ist der Verfasser gestorben.&quot; (&quot;While working on this fugue, which introduces the name &quot;BACH&quot; [for which the English notation would be B–A–C–B] in the countersubject, the composer died.&quot;) This account is disputed by modern scholars, as the manuscript was written in Bach&#x27;s own handwriting, and thus dates to a time before his deteriorating health and vision prevented him from writing, in their view probably 1748–1749.

Several musicians and musicologists have composed conjectural completions of &quot;Contrapunctus XIV&quot; which include the fourth subject, including musicologists Donald Tovey (1931), Zoltán Göncz (1992), Yngve Jan Trede (1995), and Thomas Daniel (2010), organists Helmut Walcha, David Goode, Lionel Rogg, and Davitt Moroney (1989), conductor Rudolf Barshai (2010), pianist Daniil Trifonov (2021) and composer / conductor Nikolaus Matthes (2025) Ferruccio Busoni&#x27;s &quot;Fantasia contrappuntistica&quot; is based on &quot;Contrapunctus XIV&quot;, but it develops Bach&#x27;s ideas to Busoni&#x27;s own purposes in Busoni&#x27;s musical style, rather than working out Bach&#x27;s thoughts as Bach himself might have done.

== Significance ==

=== Principles of construction ===

Loïc Sylvestre and Marco Costa reported a mathematical architecture of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;, based on bar counts, which shows that the whole work could have been conceived on the basis of the Fibonacci series and the golden ratio.

Dominic Florence proposes that a concept he calls &quot;opposition&quot; governs all the methods that Bach uses in Contrapuncti 1, 2, 3, and 5 to create variety. These include changes in &quot;melody (contrary motion), polyphony (contrapuntal inversion), harmony (dissonance), [rhythmic] density (texture), rhythm (syncopation), and tonality (modulation}&quot;. For example, Contrapuncti 1 and 2 both switch repeatedly between the keys of A minor and D minor; Contrapuncti 2 and 3 in addition enter F major and G minor, Contrapunctus 2 also visiting B-flat major once in a further &quot;tonal remove&quot;: all three begin and end in D minor. He concludes that &quot;Analyses of fugues should focus on continuous, dynamic, organic processes that evolve over time, rather than on the static and discontinuous dismemberment into strictly delineated sections.&quot;

=== Religious interpretations ===

In 1984, the German musicologist Hans Heinrich Eggebrecht suggested a possible religious interpretation of &quot;The Art of Fugue&quot;, which he agreed was impossible to prove: that the work illustrated in musical terms the Christian doctrine of redemption by God&#x27;s grace alone, &quot;sola gratia&quot;, rather than by any action an individual can take. Eggebrecht noted the presence in fugue 3 of the presence of the composer&#x27;s surname Bach in its theme, the sequence of notes B-A-C-H-C#-D. In Eggebrecht&#x27;s view, this could mean that the composer is not just signing the work, but is placing himself by his grave, accepting &quot;sola gratia&quot; as he reaches towards the tonic note, which marks the end of the fugue and symbolically the end of his life. Further, the six-note fragment is chromatic, denoting sinful humanity, whereas the work as a whole is diatonic, symbolising God&#x27;s perfection.

The Russian musicologist Anatoly Milka suggests that the various numbers embedded in the work have a numerological significance related to the Book of Revelation, the last book of the Bible which describes the apocalypse.

=== Unfinished Contrapunctus 14 ===

In his 2007 doctoral thesis about the unfinished ending of Contrapunctus 14, the New Zealand organist and conductor Indra Hughes proposed that the work was left unfinished not because Bach died, but as a deliberate choice by Bach to encourage independent efforts at a completion.

Douglas Hofstadter&#x27;s book &quot;Gödel, Escher, Bach&quot; discusses the unfinished fugue and Bach&#x27;s supposed death during composition as a tongue-in-cheek illustration of the Austrian logician Kurt Gödel&#x27;s first incompleteness theorem. According to Gödel, the very power of a &quot;sufficiently powerful&quot; formal mathematical system can be exploited to &quot;undermine&quot; the system, by leading to statements that assert such things as &quot;I cannot be proven in this system&quot;. In Hofstadter&#x27;s discussion, Bach&#x27;s great compositional talent is used as a metaphor for a &quot;sufficiently powerful&quot; formal system; however, Bach&#x27;s insertion of his own name &quot;in code&quot; into the fugue is not, even metaphorically, a case of Gödelian self-reference; and Bach&#x27;s failure to finish his self-referential fugue serves as a metaphor for the unprovability of the Gödelian assertion, and thus for the incompleteness of the formal system.

<text>In survival analysis, the hazard ratio (HR) is the ratio of the hazard rates corresponding to the conditions characterised by two distinct levels of a treatment variable of interest. 

For example, in a clinical study of a drug, the treated population may die at twice the rate of the control population. The hazard ratio would be 2, indicating a higher hazard of death from the treatment.

To illustrate how hazard ratio is linked to projected risk: in a population where the incidence of a disease is 10% by age 65 (eg: Dementia), a hazard ratio of 4.42 (eg: Aripiprazole medication) results in an expected incidence of 37.3% by age 65.

For example, a scientific paper might use an HR to state something such as: &quot;Adequate COVID-19 vaccination status was associated with significantly decreased risk for the composite of severe COVID-19 or mortality with a[n] HR of 0.20 (95% CI, 0.17–0.22).&quot; In essence, the hazard for the composite outcome was 80% lower among the vaccinated relative to those who were unvaccinated in the same study. So, for a hazardous outcome (e.g., severe disease or death), an HR below 1 indicates that the treatment (e.g., vaccination) is protective against the outcome of interest. In other cases, an HR greater than 1 indicates the treatment is favorable. For example, if the outcome is actually favorable (e.g., accepting a job offer to end a spell of unemployment), an HR greater than 1 indicates that seeking a job is favorable to not seeking one (if &quot;treatment&quot; is defined as seeking a job).

Hazard ratios differ from relative risks (RRs) and odds ratios (ORs) in that RRs and ORs are cumulative over an entire study, using a defined endpoint, while HRs represent instantaneous risk over the study time period, or some subset thereof. Hazard ratios suffer somewhat less from selection bias with respect to the endpoints chosen and can indicate risks that happen before the endpoint.

==Definition and derivation==
Regression models are used to obtain hazard ratios and their confidence intervals.

The instantaneous hazard rate is the limit of the number of events per unit time divided by the number at risk, as the time interval approaches 0:
: formula_1
where &quot;N&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) is the number at risk at the beginning of an interval. A hazard is the probability that a patient fails between formula_2 and formula_3, given that they have survived up to time formula_2, divided by formula_5, as formula_5 approaches zero.

The hazard ratio is the effect on this hazard rate of a difference, such as group membership (for example, treatment or control, male or female), as estimated by regression models that treat the logarithm of the HR as a function of a baseline hazard formula_7 and a linear combination of explanatory variables:
: formula_8

Such models are generally classed proportional hazards regression models; the best known being the Cox proportional hazards model, and the exponential, Gompertz and Weibull parametric models.

For two groups that differ only in treatment condition, the ratio of the hazard functions is given by formula_9, where formula_10 is the estimate of treatment effect derived from the regression model. This hazard ratio, that is, the ratio between the predicted hazard for a member of one group and that for a member of the other group, is given by holding everything else constant, i.e. assuming proportionality of the hazard functions.

For a continuous explanatory variable, the same interpretation applies to a unit difference. Other HR models have different formulations and the interpretation of the parameter estimates differs accordingly.

==Interpretation==

In its simplest form, the hazard ratio can be interpreted as the chance of an event occurring in the treatment arm divided by the chance of the event occurring in the control arm, or vice versa, of a study. The resolution of these endpoints are usually depicted using Kaplan–Meier survival curves. These curves relate the proportion of each group where the endpoint has not been reached. The endpoint could be any dependent variable associated with the covariate (independent variable), e.g. death, remission of disease or contraction of disease. The curve represents the odds of an endpoint having occurred at each point in time (the hazard). The hazard ratio is simply the relationship between the instantaneous hazards in the two groups and represents, in a single number, the magnitude of distance between the Kaplan–Meier plots.

Hazard ratios do not reflect a time unit of the study. The difference between hazard-based and time-based measures is akin to the difference between the odds of winning a race and the margin of victory. When a study reports one hazard ratio per time period, it is assumed that difference between groups was proportional. Hazard ratios become meaningless when this assumption of proportionality is not met.

If the proportional hazard assumption holds, a hazard ratio of one means equivalence in the hazard rate of the two groups, whereas a hazard ratio other than one indicates difference in hazard rates between groups. The researcher indicates the probability of this sample difference being due to chance by reporting the probability associated with some test statistic. For instance, the formula_10 from the Cox-model or the log-rank test might then be used to assess the significance of any differences observed in these survival curves.

Conventionally, probabilities lower than 0.05 are considered significant and researchers provide a 95% confidence interval for the hazard ratio, e.g. derived from the standard deviation of the Cox-model regression coefficient, i.e. formula_10. Statistically significant hazard ratios cannot include unity (one) in their confidence intervals.

===The proportional hazards assumption===
The proportional hazards assumption for hazard ratio estimation is strong and often unreasonable. Complications, adverse effects and late effects are all possible causes of change in the hazard rate over time. For instance, a surgical procedure may have high early risk, but excellent long term outcomes.

If the hazard ratio between groups remain constant, this is not a problem for interpretation. However, interpretation of hazard ratios become impossible when selection bias exists between groups. For instance, a particularly risky surgery might result in the survival of a systematically more robust group who would have fared better under any of the competing treatment conditions, making it look as if the risky procedure was better. Follow-up time is also important. A cancer treatment associated with better remission rates might on follow-up be associated with higher relapse rates. The researchers&#x27; decision about when to follow up is arbitrary and may lead to very different reported hazard ratios.

===The hazard ratio and survival===
Hazard ratios are often treated as a ratio of death probabilities. For example, a hazard ratio of 2 is thought to mean that a group has twice the chance of dying than a comparison group. In the Cox-model, this can be shown to translate to the following relationship between group survival functions: formula_13 (where &quot;r&quot; is the hazard ratio). Therefore, with a hazard ratio of 2, if formula_14 (20% survived at time &quot;t&quot;), formula_15 (4% survived at &quot;t&quot;). The corresponding death probabilities are 0.8 and 0.96. It should be clear that the hazard ratio is a relative measure of effect and tells us nothing about absolute risk.

While hazard ratios allow for hypothesis testing, they should be considered alongside other measures for interpretation of the treatment effect, e.g. the ratio of median times (median ratio) at which treatment and control group participants are at some endpoint. If the analogy of a race is applied, the hazard ratio is equivalent to the odds that an individual in the group with the higher hazard reaches the end of the race first. The probability of being first can be derived from the odds, which is the probability of being first divided by the probability of not being first:

:formula_16; conversely, formula_17.

In the previous example, a hazard ratio of 2 corresponds to a 67% chance of an early death. The hazard ratio does not convey information about how soon the death will occur.

===The hazard ratio, treatment effect and time-based endpoints===
Treatment effect depends on the underlying disease related to survival function, not just the hazard ratio. Since the hazard ratio does not give us direct time-to-event information, researchers have to report median endpoint times and calculate the median endpoint time ratio by dividing the control group median value by the treatment group median value.

While the median endpoint ratio is a relative speed measure, the hazard ratio is not. The relationship between treatment effect and the hazard ratio is given as formula_9. A statistically important, but practically insignificant effect can produce a large hazard ratio, e.g. a treatment increasing the number of one-year survivors in a population from one in 10,000 to one in 1,000 has a hazard ratio of 10. It is unlikely that such a treatment would have had much impact on the median endpoint time ratio, which likely would have been close to unity, i.e. mortality was largely the same regardless of group membership and clinically insignificant.

By contrast, a treatment group in which 50% of infections are resolved after one week (versus 25% in the control) yields a hazard ratio of two. If it takes ten weeks for all cases in the treatment group and half of cases in the control group to resolve, the ten-week hazard ratio remains at two, but the median endpoint time ratio is ten, a clinically significant difference.

<text>The Taupō Volcanic Zone (TVZ) is a volcanic area in the North Island of New Zealand. It has been active for at least the past two million years and is still highly active.

Mount Ruapehu marks its south-western end and the zone runs north-eastward through the Taupō and Rotorua areas and offshore into the Bay of Plenty. It is part of a larger Central Volcanic Region that extends to the Coromandel Peninsula and has been active for four million years. The zone is contained within the tectonic intra-arc continental Taupō Rift and this rift volcanic zone is widening unevenly east–west, with the greatest rate of widening at the Bay of Plenty coast, the least at Mount Ruapehu and a rate of about per year at Taupō. The zone is named after Lake Taupō, the flooded caldera of the largest volcano in the zone, the Taupō Volcano and contains a large central volcanic plateau as well as other landforms.

==Activity==

There are numerous volcanic vents and geothermal fields in the zone, with Mount Ruapehu, Mount Ngauruhoe and Whakaari / White Island erupting most frequently. Whakaari has been in continuous activity since 1826 if you count such as steaming fumaroles, but the same applies to say the Okataina volcanic centre. The Taupō Volcanic Zone has produced in the last 350,000 years over material, more than anywhere else on Earth, from over 300 silicic eruptions, with 12 of these eruptions being caldera-forming. Detailed stratigraphy in the zone is only available from the Ōkataina Rotoiti eruption but including this event, the zone has been more productive than any other rhyolite predominant volcanic area over the last 50,000 odd years at per thousand years. Comparison of large events in the Taupō volcanic zone over the last 1.6 million years at per thousand years with Yellowstone Caldera&#x27;s 2.1 million year productivity at per thousand years favours Taupo. Both the Taupō Volcano and the Ōkataina Caldera have had multiple eruptions in the last 25,000 years. The zone&#x27;s largest eruption since the arrival of Europeans was that of Mount Tarawera (within the Ōkataina Caldera) in 1886, which killed over 100 people. Early Māori would also have been affected by the much larger Kaharoa eruption from Tarawera around 1315 CE.

The last major eruption from Lake Taupō, the Hatepe eruption, occurred in 232 CE. It is believed to have first emptied the lake, then followed that feat with a pyroclastic flow that covered about of land with volcanic ash. A total of of material expressed as dense-rock equivalent (DRE) is believed to have been ejected, and over of material is estimated to have been ejected in just a few minutes. The date of this activity was previously thought to be 186 AD as the ash expulsion was thought to be sufficiently large to turn the sky red over Rome and China (as documented in Hou Han Shu), but this has since been disproven.
Whakaari / White Island had a major, edifice failure collapse of its volcano dated to 946 BCE ± 52 years. It has been suggested that this was the cause of the tsunami tens of metres tall that went up to inland in the Bay of Plenty at about this time. Although significant tsunami&#x27;s can be associated with volcanic eruptions, it is unknown if the cause was a relatively small eruption of Whakaari or another cause such as a large local earthquake

Taupō erupted an estimated of DRE material in its Oruanui eruption 25,580 years ago. This was Earth&#x27;s most recent eruption reaching VEI-8, the highest level on the Volcanic Explosivity Index.

The Rotorua caldera has been dormant longer, with its main eruption occurring about 225,000 years ago, although lava dome extrusion has occurred within the last 25,000 years.

==Extent and geological context==

The Taupō volcanic zone is approximately long by wide. Mount Ruapehu marks its southwestern end, while Whakaari / White Island is considered its northeastern limit.

It forms a southern portion of the active Lau-Havre-Taupō back-arc basin, which lies behind the Kermadec-Tonga Subduction Zone. Mayor Island and Mount Taranaki are recently active back arc volcanoes on the New Zealand extension of this arc. Mayor Island / Tūhua is the northern-most shield volcano adjacent to the New Zealand coast, and is believed to have been active in the last 1000 years. It is formed from rhyolite magma. It has a quite complex eruptive history but only with one definite significant Plinian eruption. Mount Taranaki is an andesite cone and the most recent of four Taranaki volcanoes about west of the Taupō Volcanic Zone.

Associated with the Taupō volcanic zone, intra-arc extension is expressed as normal faulting within a zone known as the Taupō Rift. Volcanic activity continues to the north-northeast, along the line of the Taupō Volcanic Zone, through several undersea volcanoes in the South Kermadec Ridge Seamounts, then shifts eastward to the parallel volcanic arc of the Kermadec Islands and Tonga. Although the back-arc basin continues to propagate to the south-west, with the South Wanganui Basin forming an initial back-arc basin, volcanic activity has not yet begun in this region.

South of Kaikōura the plate boundary changes to a transform boundary with oblique continental collision uplifting the Southern Alps in the South Island. A subduction zone reappears south-west of Fiordland, at the south-western corner of the South Island, although here the subduction is in the opposite direction. Solander Island / Hautere is an extinct volcano associated with this subduction zone, and the only one that protrudes above the sea.


==Scientific study==
===Tectonics===
In the North Island rifting associated with plate tectonics has defined a Central Volcanic Region, that has been active for four million years and this extends westward from the Taupō volcanic zone through the western Bay of Plenty to the eastern side of the Coromandel Peninsula. The dominant rifting axis associated with the Central Volcanic Region has moved with time, from the back-arc associated Hauraki Rift to the intra-arc Taupō Rift. As there is presently no absolute consensus with regard to the cause of the Taupō Rift&#x27;s extension or its exceptional current volcanic productivity, some of the discussion on this page has been simplified, rather than all possible models being presented. 

Recent scientific work indicates that the Earth&#x27;s crust below the Taupō Volcanic Zone may be as little as 16 kilometres thick. A film of magma 50 kilometres (30 mi) wide and 160 kilometres (100 mi) long lies 10 kilometres under the surface. The geological record indicates that some of the volcanoes in the area erupt infrequently but have large, violent and destructive eruptions when they do. Technically the zone is in the continental intraarc Taupō Rift, which is a continuation of oceanic plate structures associated with oblique Australian and Pacific Plate convergence in the Hikurangi subduction zone. At Taupō the rift volcanic zone is widening east–west at the rate of about /year, while at Mount Ruapehu it is only /year and this increases at the north eastern end at the Bay of Plenty coast to /year. The rift has had three active stages of faulting in the last 2 million years with the modern Taupō rift evolving in the last 25,000 years after the massive Oruanui eruption and now being within two essentially inactive rift systems. These are the surrounding limits of the young Taupō Rift between 25,000 and 350,000 years and old Taupō Rift system whose northern boundary is now located well to the north of the other two being created before 350,000 years ago.

The Tauranga Volcanic Centre which was active between 2.95 to 1.9 million years ago, and was previously classified as part of the Central Volcanic Region, appears now to be in a tectonic continuum with the Taupō Volcanic Zone. Recent ocean floor tephra studies off the east coast of the North Island have shown an abrupt compositional change in these, from about 4.5 million years ago, that has been suggested to distinguish Coromandel Volcanic Zone activity from that of the Taupō Volcanic Zone. Further the distinctive Waiteariki ignimbrite that erupted 2.1 million years ago in a supereruption, presumably from the gravity anomaly defined Omanawa Caldera, is within the postulated borders of the old Taupō Rift.

====Faults====
The multiple intra-rift faults are some of the most active in the country and some have the potential to create over magnitude 7 events. The fault structures are perhaps most well characterised related to the Ruapehu and Tongariro grabens. The recent deposits from major eruptions and lake features mean many potentially significant faults are uncharacterised, either completely (for example the 6.5 MW 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake resulted in the mapping of the Edgecumbe fault for the first time) or frequency of events and their likely magnitude are not understood. It can not be assumed that just because the rate of expansion of the rift is greatest near the coast that this is where most significant tectonic earthquakes in terms of human risk will be. The Waihi Fault Zone south of Lake Taupō and associated with the Tongariro graben has a particular risk of inducing massive landslips which has caused significant loss of life and appears to be more active than many other faults in the zone.

===Volcanism===

The north (Whakatane Graben – Bay of Plenty) part of the zone is predominantly formed from andesitic magma and represented by the continuously active Whakaari / White Island andesite–dacite stratovolcano. Although Strombolian activity has occurred the explosive eruptions are typically phreatic or phreatomagmatic. The active emergent summit tops the larger, × , submarine volcano with a total volume of .

The central part of the zone is composed of eight caldera centres the oldest of which is the Mangakino caldera which was active more than a million years ago (1.62–0.91 Ma). This produced ignimbrite that away in Auckland is up to thick. Other than the now buried Kapenga caldera there are five caldera centres, Rotorua, Ohakuri, Reporoa, Ōkataina and Taupō. These have resulted from massive infrequent eruptions of gaseous very viscous rhyolite magma which is rich in silicon, potassium, and sodium and created the ignimbrite sheets of the North Island Volcanic Plateau. The detailed composition suggests subduction erosion might play a predominant role in producing this rhyolite, as later assimilation and fractional crystallization of primary basalt magma, is difficult to model to explain the composition and volumes erupted. This central zone has had the largest number of very large silicic caldera-forming eruptions recently on earth as mentioned earlier. 

During a period of less than 100,000 years commencing with the massive Whakamaru eruption about 335,000 years ago of greater than dense-rock equivalent of material, just to the north of the present Lake Taupō, over total was erupted. These eruptions essentially defined the limits of the present central volcanic plateau, although its current central landscape is mainly a product of later smaller events over the last 200,000 years than the Whakamaru eruption. The other volcanic plateau defining eruptions were to the west, the Matahina eruption of about 280,000 years ago, the mainly tephra Chimp (Chimpanzee) eruption between 320 and 275 ka, the central Pokai eruption of about 275 ka, and the paired Mamaku to the north and east central Ohakuri eruptions of about 240,000 years ago that together produced more than dense-rock equivalent of material. The southern Taupō Volcano Oruanui eruption about 25,600 years ago produced dense-rock equivalent of material and its recent Hatepe eruption of 232 CE ± 10 years had dense-rock equivalent. Since the Whakamaru eruption the central part of the zone has dominated, so that when the whole zone is considered there has been about of rhyolite, of andesite, of dacite and of basalt erupted.

Less gaseous rhyolite magma dome building effusive eruptions have built features such as the Horomatangi Reefs or Motutaiko Island in Lake Taupō or the lava dome of Mount Tarawera. This later as part of the Ōkataina caldera complex is the highest risk volcanic field in New Zealand to man. Mount Tauhara adjacent to Lake Taupō is actually a dacitic dome and so intermediate in composition between andesite and rhyolite but still more viscous than basalt which is rarely found in the zone.

The southern part of the zone contain classic volcanic cone structure formed from andesite magma in effusive eruptions that cool to form dark grey lava if gas-poor or scoria if gas-rich of this part of the zone. Mount Ruapehu, the tallest mountain in the North Island, is a andesite cone surrounded by a ring-plain. This ring plain is formed from numerous volcanic deposits created by slope failure, eruptions, or lahars. Northwest of Ruapehu is Hauhungatahi, the oldest recorded volcano in the south of the plateau, with to the north the two prominent volcanic mountains in the Tongariro volcanic centre being Tongariro and Ngauruhoe which are part of a single composite stratovolcano.

===Risks===

The most likely risk is earthquake associated with multiple active faults, such as within the Taupō Fault Belt, but many faults will be uncharacterised as was the case with the 1987 Edgecumbe earthquake. Earthquakes can be associated with landslides and inland or coastal tsunami that can result in great loss of life and both have happened on the Waihi Fault Zone. The relative low grade volcanic activity of the andesite volcanoes at each end of the zone has resulted in recorded history in both direct loss of life and disrupted transport and tourism. The only high grade eruption in recorded history was atypically basaltic from Mount Tarawera and although very destructive is not likely to be a perfect model for the more typical and often larger rhyolitic events associated with the Taupō Volcano and the Ōkataina Caldera. As mentioned earlier the Ōkataina caldera complex is the highest risk volcanic field risk in New Zealand to man and the recent frequency of rhyolitic events there is not reassuring, along with the timescale of likely warning of such an event. These eruptions are associated with tephra production that results in deep ash fall over wide areas (e.g. the Whakatane eruption of ~ 5500 years ago had ashfall away on the Chatham Islands) ` pyroclastic flows and surges, which rarely have covered large areas of the North Island in ignimbrite sheets, earthquakes, lake tsunamis, prolonged lava dome growth and associated block and ash flows with post-eruption lahars and flooding.

The Waikato River course follows roughly the northern Maroa Caldera rim on one side. The town of Whakamaru and the artificial Lake Whakamaru, on the Waikato River, have the same name too. The paired single event eruption of the Ohakuri Caldera at its north western limits with the Rotorua Caldera added later complexity after this classification was developed. Accordingly, later naming, terms this the Whakamaru caldera complex.

The course of the Waikato River crosses this area, between the artificial Lake Ohakuri (), the town of Mangakino () and Hamilton.
**Artificial Lake Maraetai

Other important features of the TVZ include the Ngakuru and Ruapehu grabens.

===Note===

There is more recent, somewhat different classification, by some of the same authors, that uses the term caldera complex:
*North part: Whakatane Graben – Bay of Plenty
*Central part:
**West of the main fault zone:
***Mangakino caldera complex; may be transitional between Coromandel Volcanic Zone (CVZ) and Taupō Volcanic Zone (TVZ) (1.62 – 0.91 mio. years old)
***Kapenga caldera; lies between the Maroa caldera and the Rotorua caldera, it is completely buried under more recent tephra (circa 700,000 years old)
****Okareka Embayment, lies inside the northern end of the Kapenga caldera, but is now usually regarded as part of the recently active Okataina caldera complex
***Rotorua single event caldera; Mamaku Ignimbrite (circa 225,000 years old)
**Main fault zone:
***Ōkataina caldera complex
****Haroharo caldera complex
****Tarawera volcanic complex
***Whakamaru caldera complex
****Maroa caldera
***Ohakuri single event caldera
***Taupō caldera complex
**East of the main fault zone:
***Reporoa single event caldera; Kaingaroa Ignimbrite (circa 240,000 years old)

Tatchell was selected as the Labour Party&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for Bermondsey in 1981. He was then denounced by party leader Michael Foot for ostensibly supporting extra-Parliamentary action against the Thatcher government. Labour subsequently allowed him to stand in the 1983 Bermondsey by-election in February 1983, in which the party lost the seat to the Liberals. In the 1990s he campaigned for LGBTQ rights through the direct action group OutRage!, which he co-founded. He has worked on various campaigns, such as Stop Murder Music against music lyrics allegedly inciting violence against LGBT people and writes and broadcasts on various human rights and social justice issues. He attempted a citizen&#x27;s arrest of Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe in 1999 and again in 2001.

In April 2004, Tatchell joined the Green Party of England and Wales and in 2007 was selected as prospective Parliamentary candidate in the constituency of Oxford East, but in December 2009 he stood down due to brain damage acquired mainly during protests, as well as from a bus accident. Since 2011, he has been Director of the Peter Tatchell Foundation. He has taken part in over 30 debates at the Oxford Union, encompassing a wide range of issues such as patriotism, Thatcherism and university safe spaces.

==Early life==

Tatchell was born in Melbourne, Australia. His father was a lathe operator and his mother worked in a biscuit factory. His parents divorced when he was four and his mother remarried soon afterwards. He had a half sister and brothers.

Since the family finances were strained by medical bills, he had to leave school at 16 in 1968. He started work as a sign-writer and in department stores. Tatchell claims to have incorporated the theatricality of these displays into his activism.

Raised as a Christian, Tatchell says that he &quot;ditched [his] faith a long time ago&quot; and is an atheist. It has been wrongly reported that Tatchell is a vegan; however, Tatchell himself has stated that although he eats no meat, he does eat eggs, cheese, and, according to Richard Fairbrass, wild salmon, meaning Tatchell is a pescetarian.

He became interested in outdoor adventurous activities such as surfing and mountain climbing. Speaking on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Any Questions&quot; about how insurance and legal risks were making British teachers reluctant to take pupils on outdoor adventures, he said outdoor activities helped him develop the courage to take political risks in adult life.

===Campaigns in Australia===
Tatchell&#x27;s political activity began at Mount Waverley Secondary College, where in 1967 he launched campaigns in support of Australia&#x27;s Aboriginal people. Tatchell was elected secretary of the school&#x27;s Student Representative Council. In his final year in 1968, as school captain, he took the lead in setting up a scholarship scheme for Aboriginal people and led a campaign for Aboriginal land rights. These activities led the headmaster to claim he had been manipulated by communists.

Prompted by the impending hanging of Ronald Ryan in 1967, a 15-year old Tatchell protested against the use of the death sentence, writing to the press and spraying graffiti to raise awareness of the issue. Ryan was convicted of killing a prison warder while escaping from Pentridge Prison in Coburg, Victoria. Tatchell wrote that the trajectory of the bullet through the warder&#x27;s body made it unlikely that Ryan could have fired the fatal shot, casting doubt on the conviction. His protests were unsuccessful.

In 1968, Tatchell began campaigning against the American and Australian involvement in the Vietnam War, in his view a war of aggression in support of a &quot;brutal and corrupt dictatorship&quot; responsible for torture and executions. The Victoria state government and Melbourne city council attempted to suppress the anti-Vietnam War campaign by banning street leafleting and taking police action against anti-war demonstrations.

In 2004, he proposed the renaming of Australian capital cities with their Aboriginal place names.

=== Gay Liberation Front ===

To avoid conscription into the Australian Army, Tatchell moved to London in 1971. He had opened up about being gay in 1969, and in London became a leading member of the Gay Liberation Front (GLF) until its 1974 collapse. During this time Tatchell was prominent in organising sit-ins at pubs that refused to serve &quot;poofs&quot; and protests against police harassment and the medical classification of homosexuality as an illness. With others, he helped organise Britain&#x27;s first Gay Pride march in 1972.

In 1973, he attended the 10th World Youth Festival in East Berlin on GLF&#x27;s behalf. His plans to protest at the festival were not well received by either the British delegation or the GDR hosts, but he was eventually allowed to give a speech at Humboldt University. His lecture was subject to various disruptions; it ended in his denunciation as a &quot;troublemaker&quot; by a member of the audience. The following day, Tatchell attempted to hand out leaflets at a concert, an official of the Free German Youth objected and encouraged fellow concert-goers to destroy the leaflets. Tatchell intended to carry a placard advocating gay rights at the closing rally of the festival. The British delegation incorrectly translated the placard to read &quot;East Germany persecutes homosexuals&quot;; this was put to a vote and the majority decided the placard was not acceptable. Yet, in defiance of the collective decision, Tatchell carried the placard anyway and was then beaten. The placard was torn in half.

Tatchell later claimed that this was the first time gay liberation politics were publicly disseminated and discussed in a communist country, although he noted that, in terms of decriminalisation and the age of consent, gay men had greater rights in East Germany at the time than much of the West.

Describing his time in the Gay Liberation Front, he wrote in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that:

Tatchell collaborated with public artist Martin Firrell to mark the 50th anniversary of the GLF in 2020. The artist&#x27;s &quot;Still Revolting&quot; series drew on Tatchell&#x27;s personal recollections of the GLF, quoting Tatchell&#x27;s 1973 placard &quot;Homosexuals Are Revolting&quot; created by Tatchell for London Gay Pride. The artist&#x27;s addition of the word &#x27;still&#x27; reflects the truth that homosexuality is still regarded as intolerable by some and many LGBT+ people around the world are still struggling for acceptance, security and equality.

=== Graduation ===
After taking A levels at evening classes, he attended the Polytechnic of North London (PNL), now part of London Metropolitan University, where he obtained a 2:1 BSc (Hons) in sociology.

At PNL he was a member of the National Union of Students Gay Rights Campaign. On graduating he became a freelance journalist specialising in foreign stories, during which he publicised the Indonesian annexation of West Papua and child labour on British-owned tea farms in Malawi.

== Politics ==

Tatchell popularised the phrase &quot;sexual apartheid&quot; to describe the separate laws that long existed for gays and heterosexuals.

===Labour candidate for Bermondsey===
In 1978, Tatchell joined the Labour Party and moved to a council flat in Bermondsey, south-east London. At the Bermondsey Constituency Labour Party&#x27;s (CLP) AGM in February 1980, the left group won control and Tatchell was elected Secretary. When the sitting Labour Member of Parliament (MP), Bob Mellish, retired in 1981, Tatchell was selected as his successor, despite Arthur Latham, a former MP and former Chairman of the Tribune Group, being considered the favourite. While Militant was cited as the reason for Tatchell&#x27;s selection, Tatchell disagrees and ascribes his selection to the support of the &quot;older, &#x27;born and bred&#x27; working class; the younger professional and intellectual members swung behind Latham&quot;.

In an article for a left-wing magazine, Tatchell urged the Labour Party to support direct action campaigning to challenge the Margaret Thatcher-led Tory government, stating &quot;we must look to new more militant forms of extra-parliamentary opposition which involve mass popular participation and challenge the government&#x27;s right to rule&quot;. Social Democratic Party MP James Wellbeloved, arguing the article was anti-Parliamentary, quoted it at Prime Minister&#x27;s Questions in November 1981. Foot denounced Tatchell, stating that he would not be endorsed as a candidate and a vote at the Labour Party National Executive Committee denied Tatchell&#x27;s endorsement. However, the Bermondsey Labour Party continued to support him and it was eventually agreed that when the selection was rerun, Tatchell would be eligible, and he duly won. When Mellish resigned from Parliament and triggered a by-election, Tatchell&#x27;s candidacy was endorsed, and the ensuing campaign was regarded as one of the most homophobic in modern British history.

Tatchell was assaulted in the street, had his flat attacked, and had a death threat and a live bullet put through his letterbox in the night. Although the Bermondsey seat had long been a Labour stronghold, the Liberal candidate, Simon Hughes, won the election. During the campaign, Liberal canvassers were accused of stirring up homophobia on the doorsteps. Male Liberal workers campaigned wearing lapel badges with the words, &quot;I&#x27;ve been kissed by Peter Tatchell&quot; following the suggestion that he was attempting to hide his sexuality; this campaign was criticised by Roy Hattersley at a Labour news conference. One of Hughes&#x27; campaign leaflets claimed the election was &quot;a straight choice&quot; between Liberal and Labour. Hughes has since apologised for what may have been seen as an inadvertent slur and later came out as bisexual in 2006.

=== &quot;Democratic Defence&quot; ===

Tatchell published the book &quot;Democratic Defence&quot; in 1985. In it, he outlined his suggestions for a defence policy for the United Kingdom after it underwent nuclear disarmament. Tatchell argued that Britain&#x27;s military was primarily organised on a strategy of basing troops abroad rather than defending Britain itself from outside attacks, which he claimed was a legacy of the British Empire.

Citing the difficulties that the British Army was facing in Northern Ireland during the Troubles, he argued that their current methods had proven ineffective against guerrilla warfare, along with arguing for UK military personnel to be allowed to join trade unions and political parties, and to end strict adherence to &quot;petty regulations&quot;. He praised the Second World War-era British Home Guard as an example of a &quot;citizens&#x27; army&quot;, as well as the armed forces of Sweden, Switzerland and Yugoslavia as positive examples for the UK military to emulate.

In the book, Tatchell also argued for a British withdrawal from NATO and for the establishment of a European Self-Defence Organisation, independent of both the United States, as he felt that Europe had become too dependent on their military protection, and the Soviet Union, which he condemned for their invasions of Czechoslovakia and of Afghanistan, as well its internal repression. He quoted with approval Enoch Powell&#x27;s argument that the threat from the Soviet Union to Britain was greatly exaggerated. The book was reviewed by the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot; in May 1985.

===Green Party===

In February 2000, Tatchell resigned from Labour, citing the treatment of Ken Livingstone during the nomination of a candidate for Mayor of London, and of similar cases in the Scottish and Welsh elections, as evidence that the party &quot;no longer has any mechanism for democratic involvement and transformation&quot;. He fought unsuccessfully for a seat on the London Assembly as an Independent candidate within the Green Left grouping, in support of Livingstone.

On 7 April 2004, he joined the Green Party of England and Wales but did not envisage standing for election. However, in 2007, he became the party&#x27;s parliamentary candidate for Oxford East. On 16 December 2009, he withdrew as a candidate claiming brain damage he says was caused by a bus accident as well as damage inflicted by Mugabe&#x27;s bodyguards when Tatchell attempted to arrest him in 2001 in Brussels, and by neo-Nazis in Moscow.

Tatchell opposes nuclear power; instead he advocates concentrated solar power.

In &quot;Tribune&quot;, he pointed out the adverse effects of climate change: &quot;By 2050, if climate change proceeds unchecked, England will no longer be a green and pleasant land. In between periods of prolonged scorching drought, we are likely to suffer widespread flooding.&quot;

For many years, he supported a green–red alliance. More recently, he helped launch the Green Left grouping within the Green Party. He urged links between trade unions and the Greens. On 27 April 2010, he urged Green Party supporters to vote for Liberal Democrats in constituencies where they had an incumbent MP or a strong chance of winning.

In August 2021, Tatchell endorsed Tamsin Omond and Amelia Womack in the 2021 Green Party of England and Wales leadership election.

=== Iraq War ===

Tatchell opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq, and the subsequent occupation of Iraqi territory by Coalition forces. For nearly three decades, he had supported the Iraqi Left Opposition, an organization opposed to the government of Saddam Hussein due to human rights violations that Hussein had committed against democrats, left-wingers, trade unionists, Shia Muslims and the Kurdish people, and because under Saddam&#x27;s dictatorship there were no opportunities for peaceful, democratic change. He advocated military and financial aid to opponents of the Saddam government, suggesting that anti-Saddam organisations be given &quot;tanks, helicopter gun-ships, fighter planes, heavy artillery and anti-tank and anti-aircraft missiles&quot;. While opposing western intervention, he advocated regime change from within in countries such as Saudi Arabia, Iran and Syria.
Tatchell has written that on 12 March 2003 he ambushed Tony Blair&#x27;s motorcade in an anti-Iraq war protest. He forced Blair&#x27;s limousine to stop, and then unfolded a banner that read &quot;Arm the Kurds! Topple Saddam&quot;. He added that in terms of the political struggle within Britain (as opposed to struggles against absolute tyrants like Hitler and Saddam, where violent resistance can be the lesser of two evils): &quot;I remain committed to the Gandhian principle of non-violence&quot;. After the war he signed the &#x27;Unite Against Terror&#x27; declaration, arguing that &quot;the &quot;pseudo-left&quot; reveals its shameless hypocrisy and its wholesale abandonment of humanitarian values&quot; by supporting resistance and insurgent groups in Iraq that resort to indiscriminate terrorism, killing innocent civilians.

In 2003, Tatchell said he supported giving &quot;massive material aid&quot; to Iraqi opposition groups, including the &quot;Shi&#x27;ite Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq&quot; (SCIRI), to bring down Saddam. But in 2006 Tatchell noted that SCIRI had become markedly more fundamentalist and was endorsing violent attacks on anyone who did not conform to its increasingly harsh interpretation of Islam. He claimed that SCIRI, the leading force in Baghdad&#x27;s ruling coalition, wanted to establish an Iranian-style religious dictatorship, with a goal of clerical fascism, and had engaged in &quot;terrorisation of gay Iraqis&quot;, as well as terrorising Sunni Muslims, left-wingers, unveiled women and people who listen to western pop music or wear jeans or shorts.

In September 2014, Tatchell advocated arming the Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party to fight against ISIS, and argued that the US and EU had been wrong to designate it as a terrorist organisation.

===Syrian civil war===
A previous supporter of the Stop the War Coalition, Tatchell and many other public personalities expressed concern with the coalition&#x27;s allegedly unduly favourable view of Bashar al-Assad&#x27;s government in Syria, and has called for the Labour leader and former Stop the War Chair Jeremy Corbyn not to attend the Coalition&#x27;s Christmas fundraiser 2015. In December 2016, Tatchell and others disrupted Corbyn&#x27;s speech on human rights on the basis that the Labour leader had responded insufficiently to the bombing of Aleppo and urged him to condemn Russian military intervention in Syria.

On 14 February 2015, Tatchell was one of a number of signatories to a letter criticising the trend in the National Union of Students to apply a &quot;No Platform&quot; policy to feminists who criticised the sex industry or challenged demands made by certain groups of trans people. In particular, the letter cited the denial of a platform to Kate Smurthwaite at Goldsmiths College and to Germaine Greer at the University of Cambridge.

Tatchell received death threats after signing the letter. He later stated that he would have worded the letter differently to clarify that he supported the human rights of trans people and sex workers, but that he had signed the letter nonetheless because he believed in the message of free speech on campuses. He said that the initial draft that he signed contained the sentence &quot;Some of us have disagreements with the views expressed [by feminist critics of trans people]&quot;, and that he was &quot;not happy&quot; that this was cut out of the final letter.

On 13 February 2016, Fran Cowling, the national LGBT representative for the NUS, refused to share a platform with Tatchell at Canterbury Christ Church University to discuss the topic of &quot;re-radicalising queers&quot;. Cowling said that Tatchell supported speakers who are &quot;openly transphobic and incite violence&quot; against transgender people, and also that Tatchell had used &quot;racist language&quot;. Tatchell responded that no evidence could be produced to support either claim, and that Cowling had never consulted the NUS membership before deciding to make pronouncements on their behalf, and said, &quot;This sorry, sad saga is symptomatic of the decline of free and open debate on some university campuses. There is a witch-hunting, accusatory atmosphere. Allegations are made without evidence to back them—or worse, they are made citing false, trumped-up evidence.&quot;

== Campaigning ==
Peter Tatchell has campaigned for many civil rights issues, including protests against repression, racism, homophobia, censorship and the death penalty. As a result of his protests and campaigning, Tatchell has been attacked more than 300 times, has had a live bullet through his door and has survived two stabbing attempts (all as of 2009). He was beaten unconscious by Robert Mugabe&#x27;s bodyguards in Brussels and far-right protestors in Moscow left him with permanently blurred vision in his right eye. He suffers memory loss, concentration issues and problems with balance and coordination as a result.

=== OutRage! ===
Tatchell took part in many gay rights campaigns over issues such as Section 28. Following the murder of actor Michael Boothe on 10 May 1990, Tatchell was one of thirty people to attend the inaugural meeting of the radical gay rights non-violent direct action group OutRage!—and although he did not convene this first meeting, he drafted its first Statement of Aims, and has remained a leading member. The group fuses theatrical performance styles with queer protest. As the most prominent OutRage! member, Tatchell is sometimes assumed to be the leader of the group, though he has never claimed this, saying he is one among equals.

In 1991, a small group of OutRage! members covertly formed a separate group to engage in a campaign of outing public figures who were homophobic in public but gay in private. The group took the name FROCS (Faggots Rooting Out Closeted Sexuality). Tatchell was the group&#x27;s go-between with the press, forwarding their news statements to his media contacts. Considerable publicity and public debate followed FROCS&#x27;s threat to out 200 leading public personalities from the world of politics, religion, business and sport. With Tatchell&#x27;s assistance, members of FROCS eventually called a press conference to tell the world that their campaign was a hoax intended to demonstrate the hypocrisy of those newspapers that had condemned the campaign despite having themselves outed celebrities and politicians.

Some OutRage! activities were highly controversial. In 1994, it unveiled placards inviting ten Church of England bishops to &quot;tell the truth&quot; about what Outrage! alleged was their homosexuality and accusing them of condemning homosexuality in public while leading secret gay lives. Shortly afterwards, the group wrote to twenty UK MPs, condemning their alleged support for anti-gay laws and claiming they would out them if the MPs did not stop what they described as attacks on the gay community. The MP Sir James Kilfedder, an opponent of gay equality who received one of the letters, died two months later of a sudden heart attack—on the day one of the Belfast newspapers planned to out him. In a comment in &quot;The Independent&quot; in October 2003, Tatchell claimed the OutRage! action against the bishops was his greatest mistake because he failed to anticipate that the media and the church would treat it as an invasion of privacy.

On 12 April 1998, Tatchell led an OutRage! protest which disrupted the Easter sermon by George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, with Tatchell mounting the pulpit to denounce what he said was Carey&#x27;s opposition to legal equality for lesbian and gay people. The protest garnered media coverage and led to Tatchell&#x27;s prosecution under the little-used Ecclesiastical Courts Jurisdiction Act 1860 (formerly part of the Brawling Act 1551), which prohibits any form of disruption or protest in a church. Tatchell failed in his attempt to summon Carey as a witness and was convicted. The judge fined him the trivial sum of £18.60, which commentators theorised was a wry allusion to the year of the statute used to convict him.

The LGBT press dubbed him &quot;Saint Peter Tatchell&quot; following further OutRage! campaigns involving religion.

A number of African LGBTI leaders signed a statement condemning the involvement of Tatchell and OutRage! in African issues, which led Tatchell to respond that he favoured working with the radical LGBTI groups in Africa rather than the more conservative (according to him) leaders who had signed the statement. Tatchell and OutRage! published a refutation of the allegations.

OutRage!&#x27;s protest against Chief Rabbi Immanuel Jakobovits, who supported the idea of genetic engineering to eliminate homosexuality, led to accusations that Tatchell was antisemitic, following OutRage!&#x27;s leaflets citing the similarity of Jakobovits ideas for the eradication of homosexuality to those of Heinrich Himmler were distributed outside the Western and Marble Arch Synagogue on Rosh Hashanah in September 1993.

Rabbi Dame Julia Neuberger, who had campaigned for gay rights, said, &quot;Drawing a comparison between Lord Jakobovits and Himmler is offensive, racist and [...] makes OutRage appear antisemitic&quot;. She stated that the action and leaflet would &quot;alienate Jews who are sympathetic to gay rights&quot;.

==== Stop Murder Music campaign ====

Tatchell has said that a number of Afro-Caribbean artists produce music that glorifies murder of homosexual men, and incites violence against homosexuals. He argued that British laws against incitement to violence were not being enforced on foreign artists performing in the UK. He also organised protests outside the concerts of singers, mainly Jamaican dancehall and ragga artists, who he says glorify violence toward lesbians and gay men, including murder. Tatchell&#x27;s campaign began in 1992 when Buju Banton&#x27;s song &quot;Boom bye-bye&quot; was released. He has picketed the MOBO Awards ceremony to protest at their inviting performers of what he terms &quot;murder music&quot;.

Tatchell argues that murder is not legal in Jamaica, and glorification of murder is not a legitimate form of Afro-Caribbean culture. In response, Tatchell received death threats and was labelled racist. He defended himself by noting that the campaign was at the behest of the Jamaican gay rights group J-Flag, and the UK-based Black Gay Men&#x27;s Advisory Group, with which he works closely. He pointed to what he described as his life&#x27;s work campaigning against racism and apartheid, and stated that his campaigns against &quot;murder music&quot; and state-sanctioned homophobic violence in Jamaica were endorsed by many black gay rights activists and by many straight human rights activists in Jamaica (male homosexuality remains illegal in Jamaica). The campaign has had positive effects, with seven of eight original murder music singers signing the Reggae Compassion Act, which says that signatories will not &quot;make statements or perform songs&quot; that incite hatred or violence.

Members of the Rastafari movement accused Tatchell of racism and extremism, saying, &quot;He has gone over way over the top. It&#x27;s simply racist to put Hitler and Sizzla in the same bracket and just shows how far he is prepared to go.&quot; Tatchell denies equating Sizzla with Hitler.

===UK campaigning===
====LGBT equality legislation====
In 2006, Peter Tatchell opposed the appointment of Ruth Kelly as Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government as Kelly had not supported equal treatment of lesbians and gay men in any parliamentary votes. Tatchell said &quot;her appointment suggests the government does not take lesbian and gay rights seriously&quot;, adding &quot;Tony Blair would never appoint someone to a race-equality post who had a lukewarm record of opposing racism&quot;.

=====Age of consent legislation=====
In 1996, Tatchell led an OutRage! campaign to reduce the age of consent in the UK to 14 years (as per Romeo and Juliet laws), to adjust for studies that showed nearly half of all young people had their first sexual experiences prior to 16 years old, regardless of sexuality. He stated that he wished to exempt these people from being &quot;treated as criminals by the law&quot;, and that there should be no prosecution if the difference in ages of the sexual partners was no more than three years, provided that these youths were consenting and were given a more comprehensive sex education at a younger date. On 10 March 2008, in the &quot;Irish Independent&quot;, he repeated his call for a lower age of consent to end the criminalisation of young people engaged in consenting sex and to remove the legal obstacles to upfront sex education, condom provision and safer sex advice.

In 1997, Tatchell wrote a letter to &quot;The Guardian&quot; defending an academic book about &quot;boy-love&quot; against what he has said was &quot;censorship&quot;. In the letter, Tatchell said &quot;Whilst it may be impossible to condone paedophilia, it is time society acknowledged the truth that not all sex involving children is unwanted, abusive and harmful&quot;, citing examples of &quot;Papuan tribes and some of my friends&quot; who did not feel harmed by these experiences. Tatchell later said that the letter was edited, and that he &quot;was not endorsing their viewpoint but merely stating that they had a different perspective from the mainstream opinion&quot;. Tatchell has, on several occasions, since reiterated that he does not condone adults having sex with children and that his &quot;articles urging an age of consent of 14 are motivated solely by a desire to reduce the criminalisation of under-16s who have consenting relationships with other young people of similar ages&quot;. Following the publication of a photo of Tatchell alongside the Irish Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, Roderic O&#x27;Gorman, on Twitter, at a Pride event, O&#x27;Gorman issued a statement outlining that the apparent views in Tatchell&#x27;s letter—written 23 years ago, when O&#x27;Gorman was 15—were &quot;abhorrent&quot; to him, and that he appreciated that Tatchell had since clarified his own position.

In 2011, Tatchell wrote an obituary in &quot;The Independent&quot; for Scottish gay rights activist Ian Dunn. Tatchell later said that he had not known about Dunn&#x27;s connections with the Paedophile Information Exchange until &quot;many years after&quot;, and denounced PIE as &quot;disgusting&quot;. In July 2021, Hayley Dixon, Melanie Newman and Julie Bindel said in the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; that a positive review of the pro-paedophilia book &quot;Betrayal of Youth&quot;, attributed to Peter Tatchell, had appeared in the June 1987 edition of the Communist Party of Great Britain newsletter. The review reportedly stated that &quot;consenting, victimless sexual relationships between younger and older people should not be penalised by the law&quot;. Tatchell said he hadn&#x27;t read the book at the time and that a colleague wrote the review for him. He apologised for the review and said it did not reflect his views. Tatchell had also contributed a chapter to the same book, which he later said he had been &quot;conned&quot; into submitting.

======Anti-pornography laws======
In 1998 and 2008, he supported relaxation of the then strict laws against pornography, arguing that pornography can have some social benefits, and he has criticised what he calls the body-shaming phobia against nudism, suggesting that nudity may be natural and healthy for society.

=====Civil partnerships=====
Tatchell has pledged his support for opposite-sex couples to be allowed to have civil partnerships, stating that some opposite-sex couples dislike the &quot;sexist, homophobic history of [the institution of] marriage&quot;, and allowing them into civil partnerships &quot;is simply a matter of equality&quot;.

Writing for &quot;PinkNews&quot;, he said:

In June 2018, the Supreme Court ruled that the ban on opposite-sex civil partnerships was in violation of the European Convention of Human Rights. The government, headed by Theresa May, announced it would change the law in October 2018. On 2 December 2019, the law came into effect in England and Wales, although the law was not extended to Northern Ireland until 13 January 2020. The Scottish Parliament enacted its own law to the same effect on 1 June 2021.

===International campaigning===
====Australia====
While still at school, Tatchell campaigned in favour of better treatment of, and full human rights for, Aboriginal Australians. He has said that Australian cities should be renamed with their original Aboriginal place names. For example, the Tasmanian capital Hobart would be renamed Nibberluna. Tatchell said this would be a fitting tribute to Australia&#x27;s Aboriginal heritage, which he said has been discarded and disrespected for too long.

====Balochistan====
Since 2006, he expressed concern for the Baloch people facing military operations in their homeland, Balochistan in Pakistan. From 2007 to 2009, he campaigned in defence of two UK-based Baloch Muslim human rights activists, Hyrbyair Marri and Faiz Baluch, accused of terrorism charges and tried in London. Both men were acquitted in 2009. He alleged collusion by the British and U.S. governments in regards to the suppression of the Balochs, including arms sales to Pakistan, which he says were used to bomb and attack Baloch towns and villages.

====Gaza and the West Bank====
In May 2004, he and a dozen other lesbians and gay men from OutRage! and the Queer Youth Network joined a London demonstration organised by the Palestine Solidarity Campaign. Their placards read: &quot;Israel: stop persecuting Palestine! Palestine: stop persecuting queers!&quot; Tatchell says that others present accused him of being a Mossad agent sent to disrupt the march, of being a racist or a Zionist, of being a supporter of Ariel Sharon, and of being an agent of the Central Intelligence Agency or MI5. Tatchell has written a number of articles in &quot;The Guardian&quot; on the issue.

====Iran====
Tatchell is a critic of Iran&#x27;s criminal code, which has parts based on sharia and which prescribes punishments for zina offenses, including consensual sexual relations between same-sex partners.

In 2005, Iran executed two teenagers, Mahmoud Asgari and Ayaz Marhoni, aged 16 and 18, who were accused of raping a 13-year-old boy at knifepoint. Tatchell said that Iran has a history of arresting political activists on false charges and extracting false confessions from death penalty convicts, and declared that he believed the original crime was consensual sex between the two, which is illegal in Iran.

Tatchell reiterated his long-standing view that Iran is an &quot;Islamo-fascist state&quot;. He said that information from Iranian exile groups with contacts inside Iran was that the teenagers were at a secret gay party before they were arrested. International human rights groups Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch preferred campaigners to focus on Iran violating the Convention on the Rights of the Child (which forbids the execution of juveniles) rather than the allegation of consensual sex.

====Israel====
In 2006, Israel&#x27;s hosting of WorldPride in Jerusalem was criticised by Israeli religious groups. The event was welcomed by LGBT groups such as Jerusalem Open House (JOH), a local advocacy organisation which supports the rights of both Israeli and Palestinian LGBT people, and by OutRage! in the UK. Tatchell issued a statement on behalf of the latter, in which he said that OutRage! opposed a boycott of WorldPride Jerusalem because holding the event would be a &quot;huge defeat for the Christian, Judaist and Muslim fundamentalists who want it banned and who believe lesbian and gay people should be jailed, flogged or executed&quot;.

In a 2009 article for &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Tatchell condemned what he described as &quot;disproportionate&quot; and &quot;reckless&quot; attacks by the Israeli military on Gaza, but also argued that Western liberals and progressives should not support Hamas which he described as an Islamist group that represses Palestinians.

In 2011, he opposed the International LGBTQI Youth and Student Organisation&#x27;s (IGLYO) plan to hold its general assembly in Tel Aviv that December. While noting the progressive attitude to LGBT people in the country, he said the decision was &quot;divisive, exclusionist, mistaken and regrettable&quot;, and could &quot;inflame homophobia&quot; in the region by giving Arab states the view that LGBT people supported the Israeli government. He urged the IGLYO and the Israeli Gay Youth movement to protest the occupation of Palestine just as LGBT activists had protested against South African apartheid previously.

====Mozmabique and Guinea-Bissau====
Upon moving to London in 1971, Tatchell was active in solidarity work with the independence movements in Mozambique, and Guinea-Bissau.

====People&#x27;s Republic of China====

In April 2008, Tatchell attempted to disrupt the procession of the Olympic torch though London. As a protest against China&#x27;s human rights record, he stood in front of the bus carrying the torch along Oxford Street while carrying a placard calling on Beijing to &quot;Free Tibet, Free Hu Jia&quot; (the name of a recently jailed human rights activist). Tatchell was taken away by police but was not charged. In an interview Tatchell called on the world to boycott the opening ceremony of the Olympics, or to take other visible action.

====Russia====
Tatchell has written articles condemning the Russian anti-LGBT propaganda law. In 2014, Tatchell protested Valery Gergiev&#x27;s support for Vladimir Putin.

Tatchell protested the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi over the gay rights stance of Russia, comparing the event to the 1936 Olympics in Berlin. Tatchell was arrested at the Moscow Pride parade in 2011 amid a spate of anti-LGBT violence by neo-Nazis.

=====Mayor of Moscow=====
In February 2007, the Mayor of Moscow, Yury Luzhkov, visited London mayor Ken Livingstone for an annual meeting that also involved the Mayors of Berlin and Paris, with the mayor of Beijing present as well. Nikolay Alexeyev, one of the organizers of the Moscow gay pride parade, joined Tatchell in protesting the visit. A notice of the protest quoted Talgat Tadzhuddin saying that the Moscow pride marchers should be flogged.

Livingstone asserted that he supported LGBT rights, and said, &quot;In Moscow the Russian Orthodox church, the chief rabbi and the grand Mufti all supported the ban on the Gay Pride march with the main role, due to its great weight in society, being played by the Orthodox church. The attempt of Mr Tatchell to focus attention on the role of the grand Mufti in Moscow, in the face of numerous attacks on gay rights in Eastern Europe, which overwhelmingly come from right-wing Christian and secular currents, is a clear example of an Islamophobic campaign.&quot;

In response, Tatchell said that Livingstone&#x27;s remarks were &quot;dishonest, despicable nonsense&quot;, adding, &quot;The Grand Mufti was not singled out&quot;. He further said the Mayor had brought his &quot;office into disrepute&quot; and &quot;has revealed himself to be a person without principles, honesty or integrity.&quot;

=====Moscow Pride=====
In May 2006, Tatchell attended the first Moscow Pride Festival. He appears in the documentary &quot;Moscow Pride &#x27;06&quot; featuring this event.

In May 2007, Tatchell returned to Moscow to support Moscow Pride and to voice his opposition to a ban on the march, staying at the flat of an American diplomat. On 27 May 2007, Tatchell and other gay rights activists were attacked. He was punched in the face and nearly knocked unconscious, while other demonstrators were beaten, kicked and assaulted. A German MP, Volker Beck, and a European Parliament deputy from Italy, Marco Cappato, were also punched before being arrested and questioned by police. Tatchell later said &quot;I&#x27;m not deterred one iota from coming back to protest in Moscow.&quot; On his release, Tatchell made a report on the incident to the American Embassy.

=====Moscow protest against Yuri Luzkhov=====

On 16 May 2009, the day of the final of the &quot;Eurovision Song Contest&quot; in Moscow, Russian gay rights activists staged a protest in Moscow in defiance of the city&#x27;s mayor, Yuri Luzkhov, who had long banned gay demonstrations and denounced them as &quot;satanic&quot;. Tatchell was among 32 campaigners arrested when they shouted slogans and unfurled banners.

====South Africa====
Tatchell has been involved in anti-apartheid activism since the late 1960s, when he was a teenager. In an essay for the book &quot;Sex and Politics in South Africa&quot;, he describes how his lobbying of the ANC and Thabo Mbeki in 1987 contributed to it renouncing homophobia and making its first public commitment to gay and lesbian human rights. In 1989 and 1990, he and others helped persuade the ANC to include a ban on anti-gay discrimination in the post-apartheid constitution. He assisted in drafting model clauses for what became Section Nine.

In January 2005, after Tatchell was named as one of the UK&#x27;s three most &quot;hate filled bigots&quot; in the &quot;Desi Xpress&quot; newspaper, Aaron Saeed, Muslim Affairs spokesperson for the gay human rights group OutRage!, pointed out that Tatchell had, by that point, been involved in the anti-apartheid movement for over 20 years and had campaigned against racism for 35 years.

====Vietnam and Cambodia====
Tatchell participated in the mass Vietnam Moratorium protests in Melbourne in 1970. The same year, Tatchell founded and was elected secretary of the inter-denominational anti-war movement, Christians for Peace.

In 2002, he brought an unsuccessful legal action in Bow Street Magistrate&#x27;s Court for the arrest of the former U.S. Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, on charges of war crimes in Vietnam and Cambodia.

====Zimbabwe====
Part of Tatchell&#x27;s political activism and journalism in the 1970s involved the Rhodesian Bush War, in which he supported the black nationalist movement, including the Zimbabwe African National Union and its military wing. He even sent medical kits to the black nationalists, who were otherwise unable to get the right to vote or other equal rights from the white government at the time. But he became disenchanted with Robert Mugabe&#x27;s regime and by the 1990s, Zimbabwean activists had contacted him for support in highlighting Mugabe&#x27;s increasing human rights abuses. After Mugabe denounced male homosexuality in 1995, Tatchell helped organise a high profile protest for LGBT rights in Zimbabwe outside the Zimbabwe High Commission in London.

Two years later, he passed through police security disguised as a TV cameraman to quiz Mugabe during the &quot;Africa at 40&quot; conference at Methodist Central Hall, Westminster. Mugabe told him that allegations of human rights abuses were grossly exaggerated; he reportedly spat out his tea when Tatchell told him that he was gay. Mugabe&#x27;s minders then summoned Special Branch guards, who ejected Tatchell. On 26 October 1997, a letter from Tatchell to &quot;The Observer&quot; argued that the United Kingdom should suspend aid to Zimbabwe because of its violence against LGBT people.

Tatchell researched the &quot;Gukurahundi&quot; attacks in Matabeleland in the 1980s, when the Zimbabwean Fifth Brigade attacked supporters of the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union. He said that Mugabe had broken international human rights law during the attack, which is estimated to have involved the massacre of around 20,000 civilians. Then in 1999, journalists Mark Chavunduka and Ray Choto were tortured by the Zimbabwe Army.

Tatchell said that the arrest of Augusto Pinochet in London had set a precedent that human rights violations could be pursued against a head of state, thanks to the principle of universal jurisdiction. On 30 October 1999, Tatchell and three other OutRage! activists approached Mugabe&#x27;s car in a London street and attempted to perform a citizen&#x27;s arrest. Tatchell opened the car door and apprehended Mugabe; he then called the police. The four OutRage! activists were arrested, on charges including criminal damage, assault and breach of the peace; charges were dropped on the opening day of their trial. Mugabe responded by describing Tatchell and his OutRage! colleagues as &quot;gay gangsters&quot;—a slogan frequently repeated by his supporters—and claimed they had been sent by the United Kingdom government.

On 5 March 2001, when Mugabe visited Brussels, Tatchell again attempted a citizen&#x27;s arrest. Mugabe&#x27;s bodyguards were seen knocking him to the floor. Later that day, Tatchell was briefly knocked unconscious by Mugabe&#x27;s bodyguards and was left with permanent damage to his right eye. The protest drew worldwide headlines, as Mugabe was highly unpopular in the Western world for his land redistribution policy. Tatchell&#x27;s actions were praised by Zimbabwean activists and many of the newspapers that had previously denounced him. Police, however, warned Tatchell that he could be the victim of an assassination attempt.

Tatchell ultimately failed in his attempt to secure an international arrest warrant against Mugabe on torture charges. The magistrate argued that Mugabe had immunity from prosecution as a serving head of state.

In late 2003, Tatchell acted as a press spokesman for the launch of the Zimbabwe Freedom Movement (ZFM), which claimed to be a clandestine group within Zimbabwe committed to overthrowing the Mugabe government by force. The civic action support group Sokwanele urged Tatchell to check his sources, speculating that the group might have been set up by the Zimbabwe government to justify violent action. This speculation proved to be unfounded; the Mugabe regime initially dismissed the ZFM as a hoax before claiming it was an effort orchestrated by the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) party. However, two Central Intelligence Organization members were spotted and turned away from the ZFM launch, as shown in the film &quot;Peter Tatchell: Just who does he think he is?&quot; by Max Barber.

===Social issues===

====Animal rights====
Tatchell is an active supporter of animal rights, saying &quot;human rights and animal rights are two aspects of the same struggle against injustice&quot;, and that he advocates for a &quot;claim to be spared suffering and offered inalienable rights&quot; for both humans and animals.

====Cornwall====
Tatchell campaigned on the issue of the constitutional status of Cornwall. In November 2008, &quot;The Guardian&quot; carried an article by him entitled &quot;Self-rule for Cornwall,&quot; in which he said:

This article received the largest number of comments to any Guardian article, according to &quot;This Is Cornwall&quot;. Over 1,500 comments were made, and while some comments were supportive, Tatchell found himself &quot;shocked and disgusted&quot; by the anti-Cornish sentiment shown by many commenters.

====Environmental issues====
For over 20 years, Tatchell has written and campaigned about environmental problems including global warming and resource depletion, pointing out that they often have a disproportionately negative impact on developing countries. In the late 1980s, he was co-organiser of the Green and Socialist Conferences, which sought to ally reds and greens. He championed energy conservation and renewable energy; in particular tidal, wave and concentrated solar power. On 24 May 2009, he appeared on the BBC Daily Politics programme to oppose the Elephant and Castle regeneration scheme, which he said would bring few benefits to local working-class people. However, most of his campaigning continues to be in the areas of human rights and &quot;queer emancipation&quot;.

In August 2008 Tatchell wrote about speculative theories concerning possible atmospheric oxygen depletion compared to prehistoric levels, and called for further investigation to test such claims and, if proven, their long-term consequences.

==== Free speech ====
In 2006, during the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, Tatchell spoke at a 25 March 2006 rally called the Freedom of Expression Rally.

In 2007, he wrote an opinion piece in &quot;The Guardian&quot; saying, &quot;The best way to tackle prejudice is by presenting facts and using reasoned arguments, to break down ignorance and ill-will.&quot; In 2016, Tatchell chose threats to free speech in Britain as the topic of his British Humanist Association annual conference lecture. Speaking with reference to a number of censorship controversies in the 2010s, he said that &quot;the recent trend against freedom of speech means that we must fight the battles of the Enlightenment all over again.&quot;

In 2015, because of his stance on free speech, Tatchell signed an open letter denouncing no-platforming policies in some universities. This resulted in the National Union of Students&#x27; LGBT representative, Fran Cowling, refusing to appear alongside him at a discussion at Canterbury Christ Church University. Cowling cited what she saw as the letter&#x27;s endorsement of transphobic campaigners. Tatchell has said that although he &quot;totally disagreed&quot; with anti-trans activists, he supported their right to free speech and felt it was better to debate them than silence them.

However, in 2018, Tatchell voiced his support for Mark Meechan&#x27;s conviction under section 127 of the Communications Act 2003 for posting a &quot;grossly offensive&quot; video on YouTube.

====Multiculturalism and cultural relativism====
Tatchell has said he is committed to &quot;multiculturalism and the right to be different&quot;. In a 2009 lecture at the Gallery of Modern Art, Glasgow, Tatchell said:
Tatchell said that moral and cultural relativism should not be used as an excuse for &quot;collusion with the violation of human rights when it comes to issues like women’s rights and incitements to homophobic violence&quot;. He also said multiculturalism shouldn&#x27;t be used to institutionalise discrimination, giving as an example the state funding of religious schools, which he said &quot;factionalises pupils along religious lines&quot;. He said that fear of being branded racist or religiously intolerant should not allow dictators and human rights abusers to avoid criticism for their actions.

====Religion====
=====Anglican and Catholic churches =====

Tatchell criticised the Catholic Church and Pope Benedict XVI, whom he described as &quot;the ideological inheritor of Nazi homophobia&quot;. Tatchell said of the Pope, &quot;He&#x27;d like to eradicate homosexuality, but since he can&#x27;t put LGBT people in physical concentration camps, is doing his best to put them in psychological concentration camps.&quot;

Channel 4 indicated in June 2010 that Tatchell would be the presenter of a documentary film examining &quot;the current Pope&#x27;s teachings throughout the world&quot;. The plans sparked criticism from some prominent British Catholics including Conservative politician Ann Widdecombe, who accused Channel 4 of trying to &quot;stir up controversy&quot;. Tatchell asserted that the documentary &quot;will not be an anti-Catholic programme&quot;.

On 15 September 2010, Tatchell, along with 54 other public figures, signed an open letter, published in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, stating their opposition to Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s visit to the United Kingdom.

With respect to Anglicanism, he stated that &quot;it&#x27;s very sad to see a good man like the Archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams, going to such extraordinary lengths to appease homophobes within the Anglican Communion&quot;.

In 2017, Tatchell praised the Church of England&#x27;s new &quot;Valuing all God&#x27;s Children&quot; scheme for schools, which seeks to stop homophobic and transphobic bullying.

=====Islam=====
Tatchell has been critical of Islamic extremism and the use of religion to justify discrimination, though he has also said he supports the rights of Muslims and freedom of expression. In 1995, in an article about the risk to LGBT rights from Islamic fundamentalism in Britain, Tatchell wrote that &quot;although not all Muslims are anti-gay, significant numbers are violently homophobic [...] homophobic Muslim voters may be able to influence the outcome of elections in 20 or more marginal constituencies.&quot;

Tatchell has also been critical of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on British Muslims&#x27; definition of Islamophobia, which he said is &quot;well-intended but worrisome&quot;. He said he prefers the term &quot;anti-Muslim hatred&quot;, since it &quot;focuses on the prejudice against Muslim people that undermines their well-being and life chances&quot; rather than on defending Islam as an ideology. He said that the APPG&#x27;s definition, based on Muslimness, is a vague and subjective term, that it could be used to persecute Muslims themselves, and that it could become &quot;a de facto threat to free speech and liberal values&quot;. He said the definition also didn&#x27;t account for religious sectarianism from Christians and Jews.

Tatchell has described Sharia, the traditional Islamic religious law, as &quot;a clerical form of fascism&quot;. He was the keynote speaker at a 2005 protest at the Canadian High Commission, opposing proposals to extend Ontario&#x27;s arbitration law to cover Sharia. Tatchell said, &quot;It is wrong in principle to create a separate, segregated legal system for Muslims.&quot;

In 2017, Tatchell wrote to the organisers of Pride in London to defend the Council of Ex-Muslims of Britain. In response to calls by the East London Mosque for CEMB to apologise for placards alleging the mosque &quot;incites murder of LGBTs&quot;, Tatchell stated &quot;East London Mosque has refused all dialogue with LGBT community. It refuses to meet LGBT Muslims. I have asked them 11 times since 2015&quot;.

Tatchell has previously condemned Islamophobia, saying &quot;any form of prejudice, hatred, discrimination or violence against Muslims is wrong. Full stop&quot;. He described the Qur&#x27;an as &quot;rather mild in its condemnation of homosexuality&quot;.

He points out that much of his prison and asylum casework involves supporting Muslim prisoners and asylum seekers—heterosexual as well as LGBT. In 2006, he helped stop the abuse of Muslim prisoners at a Norwich jail and helped secure parole for other Muslim detainees. Half his asylum cases are, he reports, male and female Muslim refugees. Two of his highest-profile campaigns involved Muslim victims—Mohamed S, who was framed by men who first tried to kill him and then jailed him for eight years, and Sid Saeed, who brought a racism and homophobic harassment case against Deutsche Bank.

In February 2010, Women Against Fundamentalism defended Tatchell against allegations of Islamophobia and endorsed his right to challenge all religious fundamentalism: &quot;WAF supports the right of Peter Tatchell and numerous other gay activists to oppose the legitimisation of fundamentalists and other right wing forces on university campuses, by the Left and by the government in its Preventing Violent Extremism strategy and numerous other programmes and platforms&quot;.

======Muslim Council of Britain======
Tatchell had described the Muslim Council of Britain as being &quot;anti-gay&quot;, asking how can &quot;they expect to win respect for their community, if at the same time as demanding action against Islamophobia, they themselves demand the legal enforcement of homophobia?&quot;. He noted that the MCB had joined forces with the &quot;rightwing Christian Institute&quot; to oppose every gay law reform from 1997 to 2006. In January 2006, the MCB Chairman Iqbal Sacranie said that homosexuals are immoral, harmful and diseased on BBC Radio 4.

Tatchell argued that &quot;Both the Muslim and gay communities suffer prejudice and discrimination. We should stand together to fight Islamophobia and homophobia&quot;. Tatchell subsequently criticised Unite Against Fascism for inviting Sacranie to share its platforms, describing him as a &quot;homophobic hate-mongerer.&quot;

When the MCB boycotted Holocaust Memorial Day, partly because it was &quot;not sufficiently inclusive&quot;, Tatchell wrote that &quot;the only thing that is consistent about the MCB is its opposition to the human rights of lesbians and gay men&quot;.

======Islam and LGBT rights======

In 2006, Tatchell wrote an opinion column in &quot;The Guardian&quot; arguing that Muslims deliberately conflate offence with violence, in an effort to suppress Muslim reformers in Britain. He argued that Islamist groups like Hizb ut-Tahrir in Britain see &quot;any criticism of Islam is an insult and that all such insults are unacceptable&quot; in order to suppress the &quot;free exchange of ideas&quot;. The Muslim gay rights organisation IMAAN criticised Tatchell, saying, &quot;OutRage! doesn&#x27;t understand our cultural and religious sensitivities. Often, the way they word and phrase their press releases can and does antagonise Muslims. Much as we’ve invited them to meetings so we can talk about the best way to tackle Muslim LGBT issues, they insist on doing things their way.&quot;

In the book &quot;Out of Place: Interrogating Silences in Queerness/Raciality&quot;, in a chapter called &quot;Gay Imperialism: Gender and Sexuality Discourse in the &#x27;War on Terror&#x27;&quot;, Jin Haritaworn, Tamsila Tauqir and Esra Erdem wrote, &quot;rather than help, politics such as Tatchell&#x27;s have worsened the situation for the majority of queer Muslims. It has become increasingly difficult for groups such as the Safra Project, who are forced into the frontline of the artificially constructed gay v. Muslim divide, to contest sexual oppression in Muslim communities. The more homophobia is constructed as belonging to Islam, the more anti-homophobic talk will be viewed as a white, even racist, phenomenon, and the harder it will be to increase tolerance and understanding among straight Muslims [...] The dialogue which Safra and other queer Muslim groups have long sought over this is more often than not ignored or disregarded, and white gay activists such as Tatchell have proved indifferent to the fact that the mud which they sling onto Muslim communities lands on queer Muslims themselves.&quot;

Despite previously attending a &quot;rally for free expression&quot;, where the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons were celebrated, Tatchell sued the small publisher Raw Nerve Books, who issued an apology, and replaced links to the book on their site with that apology, but were later forced to shut down. The Monthly Review described this as censorship, adding, &quot;the violent suppression of &quot;Gay Imperialism&quot; and the book in which it appeared also works as a warning to the authors, editors, and other critics and potential critics of Tatchell to better keep their mouths shut.&quot;

======Yusuf al-Qaradawi======
In July 2004, then-Mayor of London Ken Livingstone invited Yusuf al-Qaradawi to attend a talk called &quot;A woman&#x27;s right to choose&quot; about the wearing of the hijab. Livingstone had read positive coverage of Qaradawi in &quot;The Guardian&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot;.

In October 2004, 2,500 Muslim academics from 23 countries condemned Qaradawi, and accused him of giving &quot;Islam a bad name and foster[ing] hatred among civilizations&quot; and &quot;providing a religious cover for terrorism&quot;.

Tatchell argued that Qaradawi expresses liberal positions to deceive the Western press and politicians, while being &quot;rightwing, misogynist, anti-semitic and homophobic&quot;, using his books and fatwas to advocate female genital mutilation, blame for rape victims who dress immodestly, and the execution of apostates, homosexuals, and women who have sex outside marriage.

Livingstone issued a 2005 dossier praising Qaradawi as a moderate, based on positive press coverage he had received previously. Livingstone pronounced that Tatchell has &quot;a long history of Islamophobia&quot;, and asserted that he is in a &quot;de facto alliance with the American neo-cons and Israeli intelligence services.&quot; Tatchell strenuously denied the accusations, pointing out that he has never said any of the things that Livingstone accused him of saying. Livingstone continued to describe Qaradawi as &quot;one of the leading progressive voices in the Muslim world&quot; in 2010, after having been denied entry to the UK for his extremist views.

Two years after condemning Tatchell, Livingstone stated he &quot;probably shouldn&#x27;t&quot; have called Tatchell an &quot;Islamophobe&quot;.

======Adam Yosef======
In December 2005, Respect Party activist Adam Yosef came under criticism for an article in &quot;Desi Xpress&quot; opposing registered civil partnerships. He asserted that Tatchell needed &quot;a good slap in the face&quot; and his &quot;queer campaign army&quot; should &quot;pack their bent bags and head back to Australia&quot;. &quot;Desi Xpress&quot; staff expressed regret to Tatchell and gave him a right of reply, while Yosef apologised and retracted his article, claiming the &quot;slap in the face&quot; remark was a &quot;figure of speech&quot; and the remark about Australia was not racist. Yosef later backed Tatchell&#x27;s 2009 election campaign.

==Writing==
Tatchell has written numerous articles in newspapers and magazines related to his various campaigns. He was highly critical of the media coverage of the Admiral Duncan pub bombing, claiming than the homophobic attitudes of news outlets had helped fuel the attack, and that the press concerned themselves almost exclusively with the one heterosexual victim, rather than the two other deaths and the dozens of maimed patrons, saying that:

In 1987 Tatchell appeared on the second programme of the first series of &quot;After Dark&quot;, a discussion on press ethics with, among others, Tony Blackburn, Victoria Gillick, Johnny Edgecombe and a &quot;Private Eye&quot; journalist.

On 5 August 1995 Tatchell was interviewed at length by Andrew Neil on his one-on-one interview show &quot;Is This Your Life?&quot;, made by Open Media for Channel 4.

, he has been an Ambassador for the penal reform group, Make Justice Work.

In 2011, he became the Director of the Peter Tatchell Foundation.

Tatchell is a patron of Humanists UK, an Honorary Associate of the National Secular Society and a committed secularist, saying, &quot;As an atheist, secularist and humanist I believe that reason, science and ethics—not religious superstition—are the best way to understand the world and promote human rights and welfare.&quot;

He contributes to &quot;The Jeremy Vine Show&quot; on BBC Radio 2.

=== Role models ===
Tatchell chose Malcolm X as his specialist subject when appearing on &quot;Celebrity Mastermind&quot;, explaining that he considered him an inspiration and a hero (his other inspirations were Mahatma Gandhi, Sylvia Pankhurst and Martin Luther King Jr.). On Malcolm X&#x27;s birthday in 2005, Tatchell endorsed Bruce Perry&#x27;s biography of the African American activist in an article calling for black gay role models, outlining the book&#x27;s reports of X&#x27;s same-sex relationships and sex work. This led to criticism from Peter Akinti, editor of Black in Britain, who said the article was insulting and reductive; he said it was the wrong time to write about Malcolm X&#x27;s alleged sex work and that gay black men did not agree with Tatchell&#x27;s recommendations for role models.

== Awards ==
In 2006, &quot;New Statesman&quot; readers voted him sixth on their list of &quot;Heroes of our time&quot;.

In 2009, he racked up multiple awards. He was named Campaigner of the Year in &quot;The Observer&quot; Ethical Awards, London Citizen of Sanctuary Award, Shaheed Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti Award (for reporting the Balochistan national liberation struggle), Evening Standard 1000 Most Influential Londoners (winning again in 2011), Liberal Voice of the Year and a Blue Plaque in recognition of his more than 40 years of human rights campaigning.

In 2010 he won Total Politics Top 50 Political Influencers. A diary journalist reported rumours that he had been recommended for the award of a life peerage in the British New Year Honours. He was said to have turned it down.

In 2012, the National Secular Society awarded Tatchell Secularist of the Year, in recognition of his lifelong commitment to the defence of human rights against religious fundamentalism.

On 21 September 2012, he was awarded a Lifetime Achievement award at the UK&#x27;s first National Diversity Awards. Alongside Misha B, Jody Cundy, Peter Norfolk and others he was a patron for 2013 National Diversity Awards.

In January 2014, Tatchell was awarded an Honorary Doctorate of Laws by De Montfort University.

== Legacy ==
The Peter Tatchell Papers are held at the London School of Economics in the Hall Carpenter Archive. Supplementary papers are housed at the British Library. The papers can be accessed through the British Library catalogue.

===Peter Tatchell Foundation===
The Peter Tatchell Foundation (PTF) is a non-profit, nonpartisan organisation based in the United Kingdom which &quot;seeks to promote and protect the human rights of individuals, communities and nations, in the UK and internationally, in accordance with established national and international human rights law&quot; and its stated aims and objectives are &quot;to raise awareness, understanding, protection and implementation of human rights, in the UK and worldwide&quot;. Tatchell started the Foundation as a company in 2011, which gained charitable status in 2018. The organisation was named after Tatchell to honour his 50+ years of globally campaigning for human rights. The charity&#x27;s celebrity patrons include Sir Ian McKellen and Paul O&#x27;Grady.

The organisation works with a variety of human rights issues globally, such as homophobia, transphobia, sexism, gender inequality, racism, political freedom, censorship, religious discrimination, unjust detention, freedom of association, capital punishment, asylum and refugees, trade union rights, self-determination of oppressed peoples, torture, genocide, war crimes, crimes against humanity and poverty.

In 2012 the foundation gained funding from The Funding Network for three projects: &quot;Casework &amp; Advice&quot;, including adding an &quot;Advice&quot; section to its website; &quot;Equal Love&quot;, campaigning on same-sex marriage and opposite-sex civil partnerships; and &quot;Olympic Equality Initiative&quot;, working against sexism and homophobia in the Olympic movement.

<text>The  (BWV; ; ) is a catalogue of compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach. It was first published in 1950, edited by Wolfgang Schmieder. The catalogue&#x27;s second edition appeared in 1990. An abbreviated version of that second edition, known as BWV2a, was published in 1998.

The catalogue groups compositions by genre. Even within a genre, compositions are not necessarily collated chronologically. For example, BWV 992 was composed many years before BWV 1. BWV numbers were assigned to 1,126 compositions in the 20th century, and more have been added to the catalogue in the 21st century. The Anhang (Anh.; Annex) of the BWV lists over 200 lost, doubtful and spurious compositions.
==History==

The first edition of the &quot;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; was published in 1950. It allocated a unique number to every known composition by Bach. Wolfgang Schmieder, the editor of that catalogue, grouped the compositions by genre, largely following the 19th-century Bach Gesellschaft (BG) edition for the collation (e.g., BG cantata number = BWV number of the cantata):
# Kantaten (Cantatas), BWV 1–224
# Motetten (Motets), BWV 225–231
# Messen, Messensätze, Magnificat (Masses, Mass movements, Magnificat), BWV 232–243
# Passionen, Oratorien (Passions, Oratorios), BWV 244–249
# Vierstimmige Choräle (Four-part chorales), BWV 250–438
# Lieder, Arien, Quodlibet (Songs, Arias and Quodlibet), BWV 439–524
# Werke für Orgel (Works for organ), BWV 525–771
# Werke für Klavier (Keyboard compositions), BWV 772–994
# Werke für Laute (Lute compositions), BWV 995–1000
# Kammermusik (Chamber music), BWV 1001–1040
# Orchesterwerke (Works for orchestra), BWV 1041–1071, originally in two separate chapters: Concertos (BWV 1041–1065) and Overtures (BWV 1066–1071)
# Kanons (Canons), BWV 1072–1078
# Musikalisches Opfer, Kunst der Fuge (Musical Offering, Art of the Fugue), BWV 1079–1080

The of the BWV listed works that were not suitable for the main catalogue, in three sections:
* I – lost works, or works of which only a tiny fraction had survived (Anh. 1–23)
* II – works of dubious authenticity (Anh. 24–155)
* III – works that were once attributed to Bach, but for which it had been established they were not composed by him (Anh. 156–189)

Within each section of the the works are sorted by genre, following the same sequence of genres as the main catalogue.

Schmieder published the BWV&#x27;s second edition in 1990, with some modifications regarding authenticity discriminations, and more works added to the main catalogue and the . Several compositions were repositioned in the over-all structure of chapters organised by genre and sections. In 1998 Alfred Dürr and Yoshitake Kobayashi published a small edition of the catalogue, based on the 1990 second edition. This edition, known as BWV2a, contained a few further updates and collation rearrangements.

New additions () to BWV2/BWV2a included:
* BWV 1081–1126
* BWV Anh. 190–213

Numbers above BWV 1126 were added in the 21st century. A revised version (3rd edition in total) of the &quot;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; was originally announced by the Bach Archive for publication in 2020, however it was delayed and only finally published in 2022.

==List of compositions by BWV number==

The numbers assigned to compositions by Johann Sebastian Bach and by others in the &quot;Bach-Werke-Verzeichnis&quot; are widely used for the unique identification of these compositions. Exceptionally BWV numbers are also indicated as Schmieder (S) numbers (e.g. S. 225 = BWV 225).

<doc id="265787" wikidata="Q217478" url="?curid=265787" title="Tyrant flycatcher">
<text>The tyrant flycatchers (Tyrannidae) comprise a family of passerine birds which is found virtually throughout North and South America. It is the world&#x27;s largest family of birds, with more than 400 species, and is the most diverse avian family in every country in the Americas, except for the United States and Canada. The members vary greatly in shape, patterns, size, and colors. Some tyrant flycatchers may superficially resemble the Old World flycatchers, which they are named after but are not closely related to. The Tyrannidae is a member of suborder Tyranni (suboscines), a group that lacks the sophisticated vocal capabilities of most other songbirds.

A number of species previously included in this family are now placed in the family Tityridae (&quot;see Systematics&quot;). Sibley and Alquist in their 1990 bird taxonomy had the genera &quot;Mionectes&quot;, &quot;Leptopogon&quot;, &quot;Pseudotriccus&quot;, &quot;Poecilotriccus&quot;, &quot;Taenotriccus&quot;, &quot;Hemitriccus&quot;, &quot;Todirostrum&quot; and &quot;Corythopis&quot; as a separate family Pipromorphidae, but although it is still thought that these genera are basal to most of the family, they are not each other&#x27;s closest relatives.

==Description==
Most species are rather plain, with various hues of brown, gray and white commonplace, often providing some degree of presumed camouflage. Obvious exceptions include the bright red vermilion flycatcher, blue, black, white and yellow many-colored rush-tyrant and some species of tody-flycatchers or tyrants, which are often yellow, black, white and/or rufous, from the &quot;Todirostrum&quot;, &quot;Hemitriccus&quot; and &quot;Poecilotriccus&quot; genera. Several species have bright yellow underparts, from the ornate flycatcher to the great kiskadee. Some species have erectile crests. Several of the large genera (i.e. &quot;Elaenia&quot;, &quot;Myiarchus&quot; or &quot;Empidonax&quot;) are quite difficult to tell apart in the field due to similar plumage and some are best distinguished by their voices. Behaviorally they can vary from species such as spadebills which are tiny, shy and live in dense forest interiors to kingbirds, which are relatively large, bold, inquisitive and often inhabit open areas near human habitations. As the name implies, a great majority of tyrant flycatchers are almost entirely insectivorous (though not necessarily specialized in flies). Tyrant flycatchers are largely opportunistic feeders and often catch any flying or arboreal insect they encounter. However, food can vary greatly and some (like the large great kiskadee) will eat fruit or small vertebrates (e.g. small frogs). In North America, most species are associated with a &quot;sallying&quot; feeding style, where they fly up to catch an insect directly from their perch and then immediately return to the same perch. Most tropical species, however, do not feed in this fashion and several types prefer to glean insects from leaves and bark. Tropical species are sometimes found in mixed-species foraging flocks, where various types of passerines and other smallish birds are found feeding in proximity.

The smallest family members are the closely related short-tailed pygmy tyrant and black-capped pygmy tyrant from the genus &quot;Myiornis&quot; (the first species usually being considered marginally smaller on average). These species reach a total length of and a weight of . By length, they are the smallest passerines on earth, although some species of Old World warblers apparently rival them in their minuscule mean body masses if not in total length. The minuscule size and very short tail of the &quot;Myiornis&quot; pygmy tyrants often lend them a resemblance to a tiny ball or insect. The largest tyrant flycatcher is the great shrike-tyrant at and . A few species such as the streamer-tailed tyrant, scissor-tailed flycatcher and fork-tailed flycatcher have a larger total length — up to in the fork-tailed flycatcher at least — but this is mainly due to their extremely long tails; the fork-tailed flycatcher has the longest tail feathers of any known bird relative to their size (this being in reference to true tail feathers, not to be confused with elongated tail streamers as seen in some from the Phasianidae family of galliforms).

==Habitat and distribution==
Species richness of Tyrannidae, when compared to habitat, is highly variable, although most every land habitat in the Americas has at least some of these birds. The habitats of tropical lowland evergreen forest and montane evergreen forest have the highest single site species diversity while many habitats including rivers, palm forest, white sand forest, tropical deciduous forest edge, southern temperate forest, southern temperate forest edge, semi-humid/humid montane scrub, and northern temperate grassland have the lowest single species diversity. The variation between the highest and the lowest is extreme; ninety species can be found in the tropical lowland evergreen forests while the number of species that can be found in the habitats listed above typically are in the single digits. This may be due in part to the fewer niches found in certain areas and therefore fewer places for the species to occupy.

Tyrannidae specialization among habitats is very strong in tropical lowland evergreen forests and montane evergreen forests. These habitat types, therefore, display the greatest specialization. The counts differ by three species (tropical lowland evergreen forests have 49 endemic species and montane evergreen forests have 46 endemic species). It can be assumed that they both have similar levels of specialization.

Regionally, the Atlantic Forest has the highest species richness with the Chocó following closely behind.

==Status and conservation==
The northern beardless tyrannulet (&quot;Camptostoma imberbe&quot;) is protected under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918. This species is common south of the US border. The situation for a number of other species from South and Central America is far more problematic. In 2007, BirdLife International (and consequently IUCN) considered two species, the Minas Gerais tyrannulet and Kaempfer&#x27;s tody-tyrant critically endangered. Both are endemic to Brazil. Additionally, seven species were considered endangered and eighteen species vulnerable.

The family&#x27;s name is derived from an early description of the eastern kingbird as &quot;the tyrant&quot; by naturalist Mark Catesby in the 1730s. Carl Linnaeus adopted that name for the entire family Tyrannidae, because he admired Catesby&#x27;s work.

The family contains 447 species divided into 104 genera. A full list, sortable by common and binomial names, is at list of tyrant flycatcher species. Species in the genera &quot;Tityra&quot;, &quot;Pachyramphus&quot;, &quot;Laniocera&quot; and &quot;Xenopsaris&quot; were formerly placed in this family, but evidence suggested they belong in their own family, the Tityridae, where they are now placed by SACC.

<text>Liquid Paper is an American brand of the Newell Brands company marketed internationally that sells correction fluid, correction pens, and correction tape. Mainly used to correct typewriting in the past, correction products now mostly cover handwriting mistakes.

==Product history==

In 1956, Bette Nesmith Graham (mother of future Monkees guitarist Michael Nesmith) invented the first correction fluid in her kitchen. Working as a typist, she used to make many mistakes and always strove for a way to correct them. Starting on a basis of tempera paint she mixed with a common kitchen blender, she called the fluid &quot;Mistake Out&quot; and started to provide her co-workers with small bottles on which the brand&#x27;s name was displayed.

By 1958, Graham founded the Mistake Out Company and continued working from her kitchen (and eventually garage) nights and weekends to produce small batches of correction bottles. She was fired from her typist job as executive secretary at Texas Bank and Trust after she accidentally put her own company’s name on a sheet of her employer’s company letterhead. She subsequently decided to devote all her time to Mistake Out.

Graham offered her correction fluid to IBM, which declined the offer (the company announced its own Correcting Selectric with an integrated lift-off tape in 1973). By 1968, the product – now renamed Liquid Paper – was profitable, and in 1979 the company was sold to the Gillette Corporation for $47.5 million with royalties.

==Acquisition==
In 2000, the Liquid Paper product and brand name was acquired by Newell Rubbermaid (now Newell Brands). In some regions of the world, Liquid Paper is now endorsed by Papermate, a widely known writing instruments brand (also owned by Newell).

==Ingredients==

 MSDSs list Liquid Paper as containing titanium dioxide, solvent naphtha, mineral spirits, resins, dispersant, and fragrances.

Liquid Paper came under scrutiny in the 1980s, due to concerns over recreational sniffing. The organic solvent 1,1,1-trichloroethane (TCA) was used as a thinner in the product. Liquid Paper containing TCA was thought to be toxic and carcinogenic, but later studies showed that although the thinner was toxic there was no evidence of carcinogenicity. There were several studies linking fatalities to the TCA contained in correction fluids, including Liquid Paper.

In 1989, Gillette reformulated Liquid Paper without TCA, in response to a complaint under California Proposition 65.

<text>Galloperdix is a genus of three species of bird in the pheasant family, Phasianidae. These terrestrial birds are restricted to the Indian Subcontinent, with the red spurfowl and painted spurfowl in forest and scrub in India, and the Sri Lanka spurfowl in forests of Sri Lanka. They share the common name &quot;spurfowl&quot; with the members of the genus &quot;Pternistis&quot; which are widely distributed in Africa.
==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Galloperdix&quot; was introduced in 1845 by the English zoologist Edward Blyth to accommodate a single species, the red spurfowl, which is therefore the type species. The genus name combines the Latin word &quot;gallus&quot; for a &quot;farmyard cock&quot; with &quot;perdix&quot; meaning &quot;partridge&quot;.

The genus &quot;Galloperdix&quot; is sister to the genus &quot;Polyplectron&quot; and together they form a clade that is sister to &quot;Haematortyx&quot;.

The genus contains three species:

* Red spurfowl &quot;Galloperdix spadicea&quot;
* Painted spurfowl &quot;Galloperdix lunulata&quot;
* Sri Lanka spurfowl &quot;Galloperdix bicalcarata&quot;

<doc id="265799" wikidata="Q16155179" url="?curid=265799" title="Scientology beliefs and practices">
<text>Followers of the Scientology movement maintain a wide variety of beliefs and practices. The core belief holds that a human is an immortal, spiritual being (thetan) that is resident in a physical body. The thetan has had innumerable past lives, some of which, preceding the thetan&#x27;s arrival on Earth, were lived in extraterrestrial cultures. Based on case studies at advanced levels, it is predicted that any Scientologist undergoing auditing will eventually come across and recount a common series of past-life events.

Scientology describes itself as the study and handling of the spirit in relationship to itself, others, and all of life. Scientologists also believe that people have innate, yet suppressed, power and ability, which can be regained if cleared of unwanted behavioral patterns and discomforts. Believers reach their full potential &quot;when they understand themselves in their true relationship to the physical universe and the Supreme Being.&quot; There have been many scholarly studies of Scientology, and the books are freely available in bookshops, churches, and most libraries.

The Church of Scientology believes that &quot;Man is basically good, that he is seeking to survive, (and) that his survival depends on himself and his attainment of brotherhood with the universe&quot;, as stated in the Creed of the Church of Scientology.

== Beliefs ==

=== Thetan ===


Hubbard taught that there were three &quot;Parts of Man&quot;, the spirit, mind, and body. The first of these is a person&#x27;s &quot;true&quot; inner self, a &quot;theta being&quot; or &quot;thetan&quot;. While the thetan is akin to the idea of the soul or spirit found in other traditions, Hubbard avoided terms like &quot;soul&quot; or &quot;spirit&quot; because of their cultural baggage. Hubbard stated that &quot;the thetan &quot;is&quot; the person. You are YOU &quot;in&quot; a body.&quot; According to Hubbard, the thetan uses the mind as a means of controlling the body. Scientology teaches that the thetan usually resides within the human skull but can also leave the body, either remaining in close contact with it or being separated altogether.

According to Scientology, a person&#x27;s thetan has existed for trillions of years, having lived countless lifetimes, long before entering a physical body it may now inhabit. In their original form, the thetans were simply energy, separate from the physical universe. Each thetan had its own &quot;Home Universe&quot;, and it was through the collision of these that the physical universe (matter, energy, space, and time, &quot;MEST&quot;) emerged. Once MEST was created, Scientology teaches, the thetans began experimenting with human form, ultimately losing knowledge of their origins and becoming trapped in physical bodies. Scientology also maintains that a series of &quot;universal incidents&quot; have undermined the thetans&#x27; ability to recall their origins.

Hubbard taught that thetans brought the material universe into being largely for their own pleasure. The universe has no independent reality but derives its apparent reality from the fact that thetans agree it exists. Thetans fell from grace when they began to identify with their creation rather than their original state of spiritual purity. Eventually they lost their memory of their true nature, along with the associated spiritual and creative powers. As a result, thetans came to think of themselves as nothing but embodied beings.

According to L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s 1952 book &quot;&quot;, published in 1952, there are two entities housed by the human body: a genetic entity (whose purpose is to carry on the evolutionary line) and a &quot;Thetan&quot; or consciousness &quot;that has the capacity to separate from body and mind.&quot; According to Hubbard, &quot;In man&#x27;s long evolutionary development the Thetan has been trapped by the engrams formed at various stages of embodiment.&quot; Scientology training is aimed at clearing the person of all engrams, thus creating an &quot;Operating Thetan&quot;. &quot;Among the abilities of the Operating Thetan is the soul&#x27;s capacity to leave and operate apart from the body.&quot;

People are viewed as spiritual beings that have minds and bodies, and a person&#x27;s &quot;spiritual essence&quot; is called the &quot;Thetan&quot;. Scientology teaches that &quot;a thetan is the person himself, not his body or his name or the physical universe, his mind or anything else.&quot; According to the doctrine, &quot;one does not have a thetan, he is a thetan.&quot;

=== Physical universe ===

Hubbard referred to the physical universe as the MEST universe, meaning &quot;Matter, Energy, Space and Time&quot;. In Scientology&#x27;s teaching, this MEST universe is separate from the theta universe, which consists of life, spirituality, and thought. Scientology teaches that the MEST universe is fabricated through the agreement of all thetans (souls or spirits) that it exists, and is therefore an illusion that is only given reality through the actions of thetans themselves.

=== Exteriorization ===

In Scientology, &quot;exteriorization&quot; refers to the thetan leaving the physical body, if only for a short time, during which it is not encumbered by the physical universe and exists in its original state. Scientology aims to &quot;exteriorize&quot; the thetan from the body so that the thetan remains close to the body and capable of controlling its actions, but not inside of it, where it can confuse &quot;beingness with mass&quot; and the body. In this way, it seeks to ensure the thetan is unaffected by the trauma of the physical universe while still retaining full control of the mind and body. Some Scientologists claim that they experienced exteriorization while auditing.

One of Scientology&#x27;s goals is to free the thetan from the confines of the physical MEST universe, thus returning it to its original state. This idea of liberating the spiritual self from the physical universe has drawn comparisons with Buddhism. Although Hubbard&#x27;s understanding of Buddhism during the 1950s was limited, Scientological literature has presented its teachings as the continuation and fulfillment of The Buddha&#x27;s ideas. In one publication, Hubbard claimed to be both Maitreya, the future enlightened being prophesied in some forms of Mahayana Buddhism, and the Antichrist. Some Scientologists regard Hubbard as Maitreya. The concept of the thetan has also been observed as being very similar to those promulgated in various mid-20th century UFO religions.

According to Lawrence Wright, author of &quot;Going Clear&quot;, exteriorization &quot;is the sense that one has actually left his physical being behind&quot;.

=== Immortality ===

Scientology teaches the existence of reincarnation; Hubbard taught that each individual has experienced &quot;past lives&quot;, although generally avoided using the term &quot;reincarnation&quot; itself. The movement claims that once a body dies, the thetan enters another body which is preparing to be born. It rejects the idea that the thetan will be born into a non-human animal on Earth. In &quot;Have You Lived Before This Life?&quot;, Hubbard recounted accounts of past lives stretching back 55 billion years, often on other planets.

At death, the spirit will leave the body: &quot;Life and personality go on. The physical part of the organism ceases to function.&quot; Scientology believes in the &quot;immortality of each individual&#x27;s spirit,&quot; therefore making death not a significant worry. The spirit acquires another body necessary for growth and survival. The primary goal is to achieve an individual&#x27;s true identity.

According to Scientology doctrine, salvation is achieved through &quot;clearing&quot; engrams and implants, the source of human misery, through the auditing process. Salvation is limited to the current life and there is no &quot;final salvation or damnation&quot;, author Richard Holloway writes. &quot;Life is not a one-shot deal. There is only the eternal return of life after life.&quot; According to Scientology beliefs, &quot;the individual comes back. He has a responsibility for what goes on today since he will experience it tomorrow.&quot;

According to Scientology beliefs, Scientology itself is a blend of science and spirituality, with a belief in an immortal spirit and in improving that spirit here on Earth using Scientology&#x27;s methods. Scientologists do not typically dwell on Heaven or Hell or the afterlife, instead focusing on the spirit. Many Scientologists also belong to other churches.

In the Scientology book, &quot;A History of Man&quot;, Hubbard discusses that a human&#x27;s past experiences make up that person&#x27;s present identity. These include experiences such as atoms, seaweed, plankton, and clams, pointing to the belief in recurring lives.

=== Eight dynamics ===

Scientology emphasizes the importance of &quot;survival&quot;, subdividing into eight classifications called &quot;the eight dynamics&quot;. The optimum solution to any problem is the one that brings the greatest benefit to the greatest number of dynamics. The eight dynamics are:

# The first dynamic is the urge toward survival of self.
# The second dynamic is the urge toward survival through sex or procreation. There are two subdivisions: (a) the sexual act itself and (b) the family unit, including the rearing of children.
# The third dynamic is the urge toward survival through groups, for example a school, a club, a team, a town, a nation.
# The fourth dynamic is the urge toward survival through all mankind.
# The fifth dynamic is the urge toward survival through life forms such as animals, birds, insects, fish, and vegetation.
# The sixth dynamic is the urge toward survival as the physical universe, which is called MEST (for matter, energy, space, time).
# The seventh dynamic is the urge toward survival through spirits or as a spirit. Anything spiritual would come under the seventh dynamic.
# The eighth dynamic is the urge toward survival through the Supreme Being or infinity.

Hubbard introduced the Scientology cross in the mid-1950s as a religious symbol for Scientology. The eight points of the cross symbolize the eight dynamics.

=== Supreme being ===

The Church of Scientology states that it has no set dogma on God and allows individuals to come to their own understanding of God. In Scientology, &quot;vastly more emphasis is given to the godlike nature of the [individual] and to the workings of the human mind than to the nature of God.&quot; Hubbard did not clearly define God in Scientology. When pressed about their belief, Scientologists mention the &quot;eighth dynamic&quot; which they say is the &quot;God dynamic&quot;.

Scientologists affirm the existence of a deity without defining or describing its nature. L. Ron Hubbard wrote in his book &quot;Science of Survival&quot;, &quot;No culture in the history of the world, save the thoroughly depraved and expiring ones, has failed to affirm the existence of a Supreme Being. It is an empirical observation that men without a strong and lasting faith in a Supreme Being are less capable, less ethical and less valuable.&quot; Instead of defining God, members assert that reaching higher states of enlightenment will enable individuals to make their own conclusions about the Supreme Being.

=== Tone scale ===

The tone scale is a key construct throughout Scientology and is used to gauge someone&#x27;s value in society or determine how best to control or communicate with someone. Hubbard introduced the tone scale in his 1951 book &quot;Science of Survival&quot; and later expanded it. The concept is a vertical scale of points from −40.0 to +40.0, each representing an emotion or other mental concept. The midpoint is 0.0, labelled &quot;body death&quot;. From 0.0 upward is the &quot;emotional&quot; tone scale, including such points as apathy, grief, fear, anger, boredom, contentment, cheerfulness, enthusiasm, and serenity of beingness. Points below 0.0 are mental concepts rather than emotions, such as shame, blame, regret, sacrifice, hiding, and total failure. In common Scientology parlance, a person high on the tone scale is called &quot;uptone&quot; or &quot;high toned&quot;, and one low on the tone scale is called &quot;downtone&quot; or &quot;low toned&quot;.

According to Hubbard, one&#x27;s tone affects a person&#x27;s attitude, their ability to relate with others, and even body odors. The higher on the scale, the more emotionally alive someone would be. Lower tones, Hubbard asserted, should be exiled from society. During the auditing process, the auditor is trained to observe the client&#x27;s emotional state using the tone scale, to raise an individual on the tone scale and improve his abilities.

=== ARC and KRC triangles ===


The Scientology symbol is made up of two triangles with an &quot;S&quot; connecting them. The top triangle is called the KRC triangle, symbolizing the related concepts of knowledge, responsibility, and control. The lower triangle is called the ARC triangle, symbolizing the related concepts of affinity, reality, and communication, and all three together represent understanding. The large connecting &quot;S&quot; stands for &quot;Scientology&quot;.

Scientology teaches that improving one of the three aspects of the KRC or ARC triangle will increase the other two. In the ARC triangle, communication is held to be the most important.

Among Scientologists, the letters ARC are used as an affectionate greeting in personal communication, for example, at the end of a letter. Social problems are ascribed to breakdowns in ARC – in other words, a lack of agreement on reality, a failure to communicate effectively, or a failure to develop affinity. These can take the form of &quot;overts&quot; – harmful acts against another, either intentionally or by omission – which are usually followed by &quot;withholds&quot; – efforts to conceal the wrongdoing, which further increase the level of tension in the relationship.

=== Morals and ethics ===
Scientology teaches that progress on The Bridge to Total Freedom requires and enables attaining high moral and ethical standards. According to Hubbard, the goal of ethics is to remove impediments to survival, and ethics is essentially a tool to &quot;get technology in&quot;, meaning Scientology&#x27;s use of the term technology. Stephen A. Kent describes Scientology ethics as &quot;a peculiar brand of morality that uniquely benefitted [the Church of Scientology][...] In plain English, the purpose of Scientology ethics is to eliminate opponents, then eliminate people&#x27;s interests in things other than Scientology. In this &#x27;ethical&#x27; environment, Scientology would be able to impose its courses, philosophy, and &#x27;justice system&#x27; – its so-called technology – onto society.&quot;

=== Gender and sexuality ===
Gender and sexuality have been controversial issues in Scientology&#x27;s history. Women may become ministers and rise through the church ranks in the same manner as men. Hubbard&#x27;s writing makes androcentric assumptions through its use of language. Critics of Scientology say that Hubbard was a misogynist. Hubbard&#x27;s use of language was also heteronormative. He described same-sex attraction as a perversion and physical illness, rendering homosexuals &quot;extremely dangerous to society&quot;. Various Free Zone Scientologists have alleged that they encountered homophobia within the church. The church&#x27;s stance on same-sex sexuality has drawn criticism from gay rights activists.

=== Science ===

The church considers itself scientific, although this belief has no basis in institutional science. According to religious scholar Mikael Rothstein Scientologists believe that &quot;all religious claims can be verified through experimentation&quot;. Scientologists believe that their religion was derived through scientific methods, that Hubbard found knowledge through studying and thinking, not through revelation. The &quot;science&quot; of Dianetics, however, was never accepted by the scientific community. Rothstein also writes that there is a possibility that Scientology partly owes its existence to the conflict with the conventional scientific community, which hindered Hubbard&#x27;s original intention. Religious scholar Dorthe Refslund Christensen notes that Scientology differs from the scientific method in that Scientology has become increasingly self-referential, while true science normally compares competing theories and observed facts.

Hubbard initially claimed and insisted that Dianetics was based on the scientific method. He taught that &quot;the scientific sensibilities [carry] over into the spiritual realities one encounters via auditing on the e-meter.&quot; Scientologists commonly prefer to describe Hubbard&#x27;s teachings with words such as knowledge, technology, and workability rather than belief or faith. Hubbard described Dianetics and Scientology as &quot;technologies&quot; based on his claim of their &quot;scientific precision and workability.&quot; Hubbard attempted to &quot;break down the barrier between scientific (objective, external) and religious (subjective, internal) forms of knowledge.&quot; Hubbard describes Scientology&#x27;s epistemology as &quot;radically subjective: Nothing in Scientology is true for you unless you have observed it and it is true according to your observation.&quot; This is a type of self-legitimation through science which is also found in other religions such as Christian Science, Religious Science, and Moorish Science Temple of America.

Sociologist William Sims Bainbridge cites Scientology&#x27;s origins in the subcultures of science fiction and &quot;harmony&quot; with scientific cosmology. Science fiction, viewed to work for and against the purposes of science, has contributed to the birth of new religions, including Scientology. While it promotes science, it distorts it as well. Science fiction writer A.E. van Vogt based the early development of Dianetics and Scientology on a novel based on General Semantics, a self-improvement and therapy program created by Alfred Korzybski to cure personal and social issues.

Scientologists believe that Hubbard &quot;discovered the existential truths that form their doctrine through research,&quot; thus leading to the idea that Scientology is science. Hubbard created what the church would call a &quot;spiritual technology&quot; to advance the goals of Scientology. According to the church, &quot;Scientology works 100 percent of the time when it is properly applied to a person who sincerely desires to improve his life.&quot; The underlying claims are that Scientology is &quot;exact&quot; and &quot;certain&quot;. Michael Shermer, writing for &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 2011, said that Scientology&#x27;s methods lacked enough study to qualify as a science, but that the story of Xenu and Scientology&#x27;s other creation myths were no less tenable than other religions.

B. Hubbard, J. Hatfield, and J. Santucci compare Scientology&#x27;s view of humanity to the Yogachara school of Buddhism, saying that both have been described as &quot;the most scientific&quot; among new and traditional religions, respectively. They cite technical language and claims that teachings were developed through observation and experimentation. They also emphasize that many investigators and researchers consider Scientology to be a pseudoscience because of its absolute and meta-empirical goals.

Scholar Kocku von Stuckrad stated that Scientology is an example of the phenomenon of both the &quot;scientification of religion&quot; and the &quot;sacralization&quot; of science. Donald A. Westbrook argues that there is an &quot;ongoing and dialectical relationship&quot; between religion and science in Hubbard&#x27;s teachings.

=== Rejection of psychology and psychiatry ===


The psychiatric establishment rejected Hubbard&#x27;s theories in the early 1950s. Since then, Hubbard was vehemently opposed to psychiatry and psychology. Scientologists view psychiatry as a barbaric and corrupt profession and consider mental illness a fraud. They allege that psychiatrists were responsible for the Holocaust, apartheid and 9/11.

Scientology established the anti-psychiatry lobby group Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) which operates an exhibit &quot;&quot;. CCHR has helped legislators draft bills, though bills in Florida and Utah failed which would have made it a crime for school teachers to suggest to parents that their child might be suffering from a mental health condition.

== Practices ==
The church makes it clear that Hubbard is considered the sole source of Dianetics and Scientology: &quot;The Scientology religion is based exclusively upon L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s research, writings and recorded lectures – all of which constitute the Scriptures of the religion.&quot; His work, recorded in 500,000 pages of writings, 6,500 reels of tape and 42 films, is archived for posterity. The Religious Technology Center holds &quot;the ultimate ecclesiastical authority and the pure application of L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s religious technologies.&quot;

Individuals applying Hubbard&#x27;s techniques who are not officially connected to the Church of Scientology are considered part of the &quot;Free Zone&quot;. Some of these individuals were litigated against for using and modifying the practices for their own use and that of others, thereby infringing the law on patent, trademarks, or trade secrets.

=== Contracts and legal waivers ===

The Church of Scientology requires that all members sign a legal waiver which covers their relationship with the Church of Scientology before engaging in Scientology services.

=== Auditing ===
The central practice of Scientology is an activity known as auditing, which seeks to elevate an adherent to a state of Clear, one of freedom from the influences of the reactive mind. The practice is one wherein a counselor called an &quot;auditor&quot; addresses a series of questions to a preclear, observes and records the preclear&#x27;s responses, and acknowledges them. An essential element in all forms of auditing is not to suggest answers to the preclear or invalidate or degrade what the preclear says in response. It is of utmost importance that the auditor create a safe and distraction-free session environment.

The term &quot;clear&quot; derives from a calculator button that deletes previous calculations. According to Scientology beliefs, Clears are &quot;optimal individuals&quot;, and &quot;they have been cleared of false information and memories of traumatic experiences that prevent them from adapting to the world around them in a natural and appropriate fashion.&quot; Scientologists believe that clears become more successful in their daily lives and are &quot;healthier, experience less stress, and possess better communication skills than non-Scientologists.&quot;

&quot;Auditing&quot; is sometimes considered controversial, because auditing sessions are permanently recorded and stored within &quot;preclear folders&quot;. Scientologists believe that the practice of auditing helps them overcome the debilitating effects of traumatic experiences, most of which have accumulated over a multitude of lifetimes. The folders are kept in accordance with the Priest/Penitent legal parameters which do not allow these folders to be seen or used for any other purpose or seen by any others who are not directly involved in supervising that person&#x27;s auditing progress.

Auditors are required to become proficient with the use of their E-meters. The device measures the subject&#x27;s galvanic skin response like a polygraph (lie detector), but with only one electrode per hand rather than multiple sensors. The E-meter is primarily used in auditing, which &quot;aims to remove (engrams) to produce a state of &#x27;clear.&#x27;&quot; Auditors do not receive final certification until they have completed an internship, and have demonstrated a proven ability in the skills they have been trained in. Auditors often practice their auditing with each other, as well as friends or family. Church members sometimes pair up during training, doing the same course simultaneously so that they can audit each other up through the various Scientology levels.

According to scholar Harriet Whitehead, the Church of Scientology &quot;has developed a fine-tooled hierarchically organized system of audit (training) sessions where the technology of these sessions, in fact, is the treatment leading to processes of renunciation and eventually reformulation in the individual,&quot; which is similar to psychoanalysis.

==== Traumatic memories and the reactive mind ====

Among Scientology&#x27;s basic tenets are the belief that human beings are immortal, that a person&#x27;s life experience transcends a single lifetime, and that human beings possess infinite capabilities. Scientology presents two major divisions of the mind. The &quot;reactive mind&quot; is thought to absorb all pain and emotional trauma, while the &quot;analytical mind&quot; is a rational mechanism which is responsible for consciousness. The reactive mind stores mental images which are not readily available to the analytical (conscious) mind; these are referred to as &quot;engrams&quot;. Engrams are painful and debilitating; as they accumulate, people move further away from their true identity. Avoiding this fate is Scientology&#x27;s basic goal. Dianetic auditing is one way by which the Scientologist may progress toward the &#x27;Clear&#x27; state, winning gradual freedom from the reactive mind&#x27;s engrams, and acquiring certainty of their reality as a thetan. Hubbard&#x27;s differentiation of the reactive mind and the analytical mind forms one of the basic tenets of Dianetics. The analytical mind is similar to the conscious mind, which processes daily information and events. The reactive mind produces the mind&#x27;s &quot;aberrations&quot; such as &quot;fear, inhibition, intense love and hate and various psychosomatic ills&quot; which are recorded as &quot;engrams&quot;.

Scientology believes people have hidden abilities that have not yet been fully realized. It is believed that increased spiritual awareness and physical benefits are accomplished through counseling sessions referred to as &quot;auditing&quot;. Through auditing, it is said that people can solve their problems and free themselves of engrams. This restores them to their natural condition as thetans and enables them to be &quot;at cause&quot; in their daily lives, responding rationally and creatively to life events rather than reacting to them under the direction of stored engrams. Accordingly, those who study Scientology materials and receive auditing sessions advance from a status of &quot;Preclear&quot; to &quot;Clear&quot; and &quot;Operating Thetan&quot;. Scientology&#x27;s utopian aim is to &quot;clear the planet&quot;, a world in which everyone has cleared themselves of their engrams.

Auditing is a one-on-one session with a Scientology counselor or &quot;auditor&quot;. It bears a superficial similarity to confession or pastoral counseling, but the auditor records and stores all information received and does not dispense forgiveness or advice the way a pastor or priest might do. Instead, the auditor&#x27;s task is to help people discover and understand engrams and their limiting effects for themselves. Most auditing requires an E-meter, a device that measures minute changes in electrical resistance through the body when a person holds electrodes (metal &quot;cans&quot;), and a small current is passed through them.

Scientology believes that watching for changes in the E-meter&#x27;s display helps locate engrams. Once an area of concern has been identified, the auditor asks the individual specific questions about it to help them eliminate the engram and uses the E-meter to confirm that the engram&#x27;s &quot;charge&quot; has been dissipated and the engram has been cleared. As the individual progresses, the focus of auditing moves from simple to increasingly complex engrams. At the more advanced OT auditing levels, Scientologists perform solo auditing sessions, acting as their own auditors.

==== Silent birth ====
Advocated by Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard, silent birth describes &quot;the process of childbirth where labor and delivery is done in a calm and loving environment.&quot; To provide quiet surroundings for the baby&#x27;s delivery, individuals in their immediate vicinity are prompted not to speak. According to Scientology practices, silent birth is &quot;mandatory to provide the best possible environment for the pregnant mother and her new baby.&quot; Shouting, laughing, or making loud remarks must be avoided while the baby is being pushed out. According to &quot;The Multimedia Encyclopedia of Women in Today&#x27;s World,&quot; &quot;its origins are fundamentally rooted in the principle that women, particularly expectant mothers, be given the utmost care and respect.&quot;

=== Training ===

Scientologists also undergo training aside from auditing, which consists of several levels of courses about daily life improvement using various tools and auditing techniques so that members can perform the same procedure as other Scientologists.

==== Interpretation and context ====

Scientology discourages secondary interpretation of its writings. Scientologists are taught to consult only official sources, and never convey their own interpretation of concepts in their own words.

=== Study Technology ===
Hubbard described three barriers to study: lack of mass, too steep a gradient, and the misunderstood word. Scientology teaches that a student who learns only ideas, without also seeing the thing in real life that they are studying (the mass) or at least a picture of it, would suffer feeling dizzy or bored or angry—the remedy would be to provide the student with some mass of the thing they are studying. If a student does not know the fundamentals of a subject and advances too quickly to higher levels, they would feel confused—the remedy for too steep a gradient would be to drop back down to the earlier level the person thought they knew well but did not. When a student reads past a word they do not fully understand, they would &quot;go blank&quot;, yawn, or seem distracted—the remedy would be to find the word they did not know and look it up in a dictionary, then continue studying.

In Scientology, &quot;misinformation or miscommunication is analogous to original sin, inhibiting individual growth and relationships with others.&quot; The &quot;misunderstood word&quot; is a key concept in Scientology, and failure in reading comprehension is attributed to it. Scientology focuses heavily on dictionaries. The Church of Scientology includes glossaries in most books and even publishes several dictionaries covering Scientology-specific terminology, words, phrases, and abbreviations. Critics have accused Hubbard of &quot;loading the language&quot; and using Scientology jargon to keep Scientologists from interacting with others outside of Scientology.

=== The Bridge to Total Freedom ===
The Bridge to Total Freedom, also known as the &quot;Classification, Gradation and Awareness Chart&quot;, is Scientology&#x27;s primary road map to guide a person through the sequential steps to attain Scientology&#x27;s concept of spiritual freedom. In &quot;&quot;, Hubbard used the analogy of a bridge: &quot;We are here at a bridge between one state of Man and a next. We are above the chasm which divides a lower from a higher plateau and this chasm marks an artificial evolutionary step in the progress of Man.[...] In this handbook we have the basic axioms and a therapy which works. For God&#x27;s sake, get busy and build a better bridge!&quot; The current Classification, Gradation, and Awareness Chart is printed with red ink on white paper and hangs as a poster in every Scientology organization. A newcomer to Scientology starts the Bridge at the bottom of the chart and rises through the levels, perhaps reaching the level of Clear, then continuing upward through the OT Levels to higher states of awareness and ability.

=== Detoxification and purification ===
The Purification Rundown is a controversial detoxification program developed by Scientology&#x27;s founder L. Ron Hubbard and used by the Church of Scientology as an introductory service. Scientologists consider it the only effective way to deal with the long-term effects of drug abuse or toxic exposure. The program combines exercise, dietary supplements and long stays in a sauna (up to five hours a day for five weeks). It is promoted variously as religious or secular, medical or purely spiritual, depending on context.

Narconon is a drug education and rehabilitation program founded on Hubbard&#x27;s beliefs about toxins and purification. Narconon is offered in the United States, Canada and some European countries; its &quot;Purification Program&quot; uses a regimen composed of sauna, physical exercise, vitamins and diet management, combined with auditing and study.

=== Psychosis and introspection ===
The Introspection Rundown is a controversial Church of Scientology auditing process that is intended to handle a psychotic episode or complete mental breakdown. Introspection is defined for this rundown as a condition where the person is &quot;looking into one&#x27;s own mind, feelings, reactions, etc.&quot; The Introspection Rundown came under public scrutiny after the death of Lisa McPherson in 1995.

=== Ethics, justice and disconnection ===
Scientology&#x27;s internal ethics and justice system is designed to deal with unethical or antisocial behavior. Ethics officers are present in every org; they are tasked with ensuring correct application of Scientology technology and deal with violations such as non-compliance with standard procedures or any other behavior adversely affecting an org&#x27;s performance, ranging from errors and misdemeanors to crimes and suppressive acts, as defined by internal documents. Scientology teaches that spiritual progress requires and enables the attainment of high &quot;&quot;&quot;ethical&quot; standards. In Scientology, rationality is stressed over morality. Actions are considered &quot;ethical&quot; if they promote &quot;survival&quot; across all eight dynamics, thus benefiting the greatest number of people or things possible while harming the fewest.

While Scientology states that many social problems are the unintentional results of people&#x27;s imperfections, it asserts that there are also genuinely malevolent individuals. Hubbard believed that approximately 80 percent of all people are what he called &quot;social personalities&quot;people who welcome and contribute to the welfare of others. The remaining 20 percent of the population, Hubbard thought, were &quot;suppressive persons&quot;. According to Hubbard, only about 2.5 percent of this 20 percent are hopelessly antisocial personalities; these make up the small proportion of truly dangerous individuals in humanity: &quot;the Adolf Hitlers and the Genghis Khans, the unrepentant murderers and the drug lords.&quot; Scientologists believe that any contact with suppressive or antisocial individuals harms one&#x27;s spiritual condition, necessitating disconnection.

In Scientology, defectors who turn into critics of the movement are declared suppressive persons, and the Church of Scientology has a reputation for moving aggressively against such detractors. A Scientologist who is actively in communication with a suppressive person and, as a result, shows signs of antisocial behavior is referred to as a &quot;potential trouble source&quot;.

=== Fair game ===
The term &quot;fair game&quot; describes policies and practices carried out by the Church against people the Church perceives as its enemies. Hubbard established the policy in the 1950s, in response to criticism both from within and outside his organization. Individuals or groups who are &quot;fair game&quot; are judged to be a threat to the Church and, according to the policy, can be punished and harassed using any and all means possible.

Hubbard and his followers targeted many individuals as well as government officials and agencies, including a program of covert and illegal infiltration of the IRS and other U.S. government agencies during the 1970s. They also conducted private investigations, character assassination and legal action against the Church&#x27;s critics in the media. The policy remains in effect and has been defended by the Church of Scientology as a core religious practice.

=== Holidays ===

Scientology celebrates seven main holidays each year:
* L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s birthday, March 13, celebrates Scientology&#x27;s achievements during the prior year
* Dianetics Day, May 9, marks the anniversary of the 1950 publication of &quot;Dianetics&quot;
* Maiden Anniversary Voyage: June 9 is the anniversary of the of the ship &quot;Freewinds&quot;. 
* Sea Org Day is held on August 12
* Auditor&#x27;s Day is the second Sunday in September
* The IAS event, October 7, celebrates the anniversary of the founding of the International Association of Scientologists
* New Year&#x27;s event, December 31

=== Sunday services ===

A Scientology Sunday service has a sermon, similar to some other religions. It typically begins at 11 am, and Hubbard&#x27;s writings are read aloud during the service. Like other religions&#x27; services, music is played, and sometimes performances are enjoyed. The minister speaks on Scientology doctrine, announces the weekly activities of the community and recent updates from churches around the world. Scientologists also say &quot;A Prayer for Total Freedom&quot;, asking the &quot;author of the universe&quot; to help them as they seek enlightenment.

The way Scientology&#x27;s service has been executed has not changed. The minister chooses from limited possible sermons and group processing exercises. He creates the sermon within a literal interpretation of Hubbard&#x27;s canonical teachings, functioning similarly to other indigenous theologians who work with canonical texts.

According to religious studies scholar James R. Lewis, Sunday services are for interested non-members, and the holidays and events are for existing members of the church.

=== Rituals ===

The church&#x27;s rituals can be categorized in four ways: first, rituals performed for spiritual transformation; second, collective ceremonies usually called events, including Hubbard&#x27;s birthday; third, rites of passage, including weddings and funerals; and fourth, those that mimic Christian rituals, such as Sunday services. Events include the anniversary of Dianetics, the anniversary of Freewinds, and Auditor&#x27;s Day.
== Splinter groups: independents, Miscavige&#x27;s RTC, and squirreling ==

While &quot;Scientology&quot; generally refers to the David Miscavige-led Church of Scientology, other groups are practicing Scientology. These groups, collectively known as the Free Zone or as Independent Scientologists, consist of both former members of the Church of Scientology and new followers of the movement. In 1965, a longtime Church member and &quot;Doctor of Scientology&quot; Jack Horner, dissatisfied with the Church&#x27;s &quot;ethics&quot; program, developed Dianology. Bill Robertson, a former Sea Org member, was a primary instigator of the Free Zone in the early 1980s. The church labels these groups as &quot;squirrels&quot; in Scientology jargon and often subjects them to considerable legal and social pressure.

On January 1, 1982, Miscavige established the Religious Technology Center (RTC). Shortly thereafter, individuals began splintering off the Church of Scientology and forming groups in what they called the &quot;Free Zone&quot;. Most notable was the ousting of David Mayo, Hubbard&#x27;s own auditor and the highest-ranking technical officer in Scientology whom Hubbard had appointed successor guardian of Scientology&#x27;s doctrines. After his removal, Mayo established the Advanced Ability Center, which became quite successful until it was bankrupted in 1986 by years of litigation and harassment from the Church of Scientology.

In the mid-2000s, high-profile defectors Mark Rathbun and Mike Rinder represented and stood for the cause of Independent Scientologists wishing to practice Scientology outside of the Church.

<doc id="265800" wikidata="Q7433868" url="?curid=265800" title="Scientology controversies">
<text>Since its inception in 1954, the Church of Scientology has been involved in a number of controversies, including its stance on psychiatry, Scientology&#x27;s legitimacy as a religion, the Church&#x27;s aggressive attitude in dealing with its perceived enemies and critics, allegations of mistreatment of members, and predatory financial practices; for example, the high cost of religious training:191 and perceived exploitative practices. When mainstream media outlets have reported alleged abuses, representatives of the church have tended to deny such allegations.

==Secrecy==
The church maintains strict control over the use of its symbols, names and religious texts. Although U.S. intellectual property law allows for &quot;fair use&quot; of material for commentary, parody, educational purposes, etc., critics of the church such as Gerry Armstrong have argued the church unfairly and illegally uses the legal system to suppress &quot;fair&quot; uses, including suppressing any mention of the space opera aspects of the religion, including the story of Xenu.:371-383

One example critics cited is a 1995 lawsuit against the &quot;Washington Post&quot;. The Religious Technology Center (RTC), the corporation controlling L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s copyrighted materials, sued to prevent a &quot;Post&quot; reporter from describing church teachings at the center of another lawsuit, claiming copyright infringement, trade secret misappropriation, and the circulation of their &quot;advanced technology&quot; teachings would cause &quot;devastating, cataclysmic spiritual harm&quot; to those not prepared. In her judgment in favor of the &quot;Post&quot;, Judge Leonie Brinkema noted:

==Public absence of Shelly Miscavige==
Shelly Miscavige, wife of Church of Scientology leader David Miscavige, has not been seen publicly since 2007.

In 2013, actress Leah Remini, a former Scientologist and vocal critic of the organization, filed a missing person report with the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) concerned about her disappearance. The LAPD allegedly contacted Miscavige and closed the case within hours. Despite assurances from Church of Scientology spokespeople that Shelly Miscavige is alive and well, many continue to express skepticism.

In 2022, after hearing about an investigation into now-retired LAPD Captain Cory Palka about alerting others of confidential police investigations, Remini revealed photographs of Palka accepting a $20,000 check from Scientology for LAPD charities, and one of a Scientology information kiosk located in the LAPD Hollywood Division. While speaking with Palka in his office, Remini noticed a letter of thanks to him from Scientology with an invitation to lunch at their Celebrity Centre.

As of 2024, Shelly Miscavige&#x27;s whereabouts remain unknown.

==Scientology and psychiatry==

There have been a number of controversies between Scientology and psychiatry since the founding of the Church of Scientology in 1952. Scientology is publicly, and often vehemently, opposed to both psychiatry and psychology. Scientologists view psychiatry as a barbaric and corrupt profession and encourage alternative care based on spiritual healing. According to the Church of Scientology, psychiatry has a long history of improper and abusive care. The group&#x27;s views have been disputed, criticized and condemned by experts in the medical and scientific community and been a source of public controversy.

The Church of Scientology&#x27;s objection to secular ideas about mental health are religious in nature, based on the conviction that humans are essentially divine beings who have been marred by negative experiences acquired over several lifetimes. Scientology also purports that the secular perception of what is mentally normal is not based on science, a contradiction to the claims of psychiatry and psychology.

The Church founded an anti-psychiatry organization called Citizens Commission on Human Rights (CCHR), which operates a public exhibit in Los Angeles, California, called .

==&quot;Attack the Attacker&quot; policy==
Scientology has a reputation for hostile action toward anyone who criticizes it in a public forum; executives within the organization have proclaimed Scientology is &quot;not a turn-the-other-cheek religion&quot;. Journalists, politicians, former Scientologists and various anti-cult groups have made accusations of wrongdoing against Scientology since the 1960s, and Scientology has targeted these critics—almost without exception—for retaliation, in the form of lawsuits and public counter-accusations of personal wrongdoing. Many of Scientology&#x27;s critics have also reported they were subjected to threats and harassment in their private lives.

The organization&#x27;s actions reflect a formal policy for dealing with criticism instituted by L. Ron Hubbard, called &quot;attack the attacker&quot;. Hubbard codified this policy in the latter half of the 1960s in response to government investigations into the organization. In 1966, Hubbard wrote a criticism of the organization&#x27;s behavior and noted the &quot;correct procedure&quot; for attacking enemies of Scientology:

=== Litigation against critics ===

In the past, many critics of Scientology have claimed they were harassed by frivolous and vexatious lawsuits, including journalists Paulette Cooper and Richard Behar; free-speech advocates Karin Spaink, David S. Touretzky, Keith Henson and Grady Ward; and former Scientology members Cyril Vosper, Lawrence Wollersheim, Jon Atack, Gerry Armstrong, Steven Fishman, Dennis Erlich, Arnie Lerma, and Bonnie Woods.

Paulette Cooper was falsely accused of felony charges as she had been framed by the Church of Scientology&#x27;s Guardian&#x27;s Office. Furthermore, her personal life had been intruded upon by Scientologists who had attempted to kill her and/or draw her to suicide in a covert plan known as Operation Freakout brought to light after FBI investigations into other matters (See Operation Snow White).

A prominent example of litigation of its critics is the Church of Scientology&#x27;s $416 million libel lawsuit against Time Warner as a result of their publication of a highly critical magazine article &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot; by Richard Behar. A public campaign by the Church of Scientology accordingly ensued in an attempt to defame this Time Magazine publication. (See Church of Scientology&#x27;s response)

Gareth Alan Cales is being harassed by the Church of Scientology, including false charges against him and his friends.

Similarly, the Church of Scientology&#x27;s legal battle with Gerry Armstrong in &quot;Church of Scientology v. Gerald Armstrong&quot; spanned two decades and involved a $10 million claim against Armstrong.

===&quot;Scientology and Me&quot;===
In 2007 a BBC documentary on Scientology by reporter John Sweeney came under scrutiny by Scientologists. Sweeney alleged &quot;While making our BBC Panorama film &quot;Scientology and Me&quot; I have been shouted at, spied on, had my hotel invaded at midnight, denounced as a &#x27;bigot&#x27; by star Scientologists, brain-washed—that is how it felt to me—in a mock up of a Nazi-style torture chamber and chased round the streets of Los Angeles by sinister strangers&quot;. This resulted in a video being distributed by Scientologists of a shouting match between Sweeney and Scientology spokesman Tommy Davis. The church has reportedly released a DVD accusing the BBC of organising a demonstration outside a Scientology office in London, during which &quot;terrorist death threats&quot; were made against Scientologists. The BBC described the allegations as &quot;clearly laughable and utter nonsense&quot;. Sandy Smith, the BBC programme&#x27;s producer, commented the church of Scientology has &quot;no way of dealing with any kind of criticism at all&quot;.
===Fair Game===

Hubbard detailed his rules for attacking critics in a number of policy letters, including one often quoted by critics as &quot;the fair game policy&quot;. This allowed those who had been declared enemies of the Church, called &quot;suppressive persons&quot; (SPs), &quot;May be deprived of property or injured by any means...May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed&quot;. (taken from HCOPL October 18, 1967 Issue IV, &quot;Penalties for Lower Conditions&quot;)

The aforementioned policy was canceled and replaced by HCOPL July 21, 1968, &quot;Penalties for Lower Conditions&quot;. The wordings &quot;May be deprived of property or injured by any means... May be tricked, sued or lied to or destroyed&quot;, are not found in this reference. Scientology critics argue only the term but not the practice was removed. To support this contention, they refer to &quot;HCO Policy Letter of October 21, 1968&quot; which says, &quot;The practice of declaring people FAIR GAME will cease. FAIR GAME may not appear on any Ethics Order. It causes bad public relations. This P/L does not cancel any policy on the treatment or handling of a SP.&quot;

According to a book by Omar Garrison, HCOPL March 7, 1969, was created under pressure from the government of New Zealand. Garrison quotes from the HCOPL, &quot;We are going in the direction of mild ethics and involvement with the Society&quot;. Garrison then states, &quot;It was partly on the basis of these policy reforms that the New Zealand Commission of Inquiry recommended that no legislative action be taken against Scientology&quot;. The source of Omar Garrison for this is most likely the Dumbleton-Powles Report, additional data and quotations are found in this report.

In 1977, top officials of Scientology&#x27;s &quot;Guardian&#x27;s Office&quot;, an internal security force run by Hubbard&#x27;s wife, Mary Sue Hubbard, admitted that fair game was policy in the GO. (&quot;U.S. v. Kember&quot;, Budlong Sentencing Memorandum – Undated, 1981).

In separate cases in 1979 and 1984, attorneys for Scientology argued the Fair Game policy was in fact a core belief of Scientology and as such deserved protection as religious expression.

===Dead agenting===
&quot;Dead agenting&quot; means to provide negative information or propaganda about an enemy or critic. A &quot;dead agent pack&quot; or &quot;package&quot; is a compilation of documents designed to defame or ruin the reputation of an opponent. It is used to discredit someone who has spoken out against Scientology, or is held as &quot;insurance&quot; to deter someone from speaking out.

In the 1970s, Hubbard continued to codify the policy of &quot;attacking the attacker&quot; and assigned a term to be used frequently within Scientology: &quot;dead agenting&quot;. Used as a verb, &quot;dead agenting&quot; is described by Hubbard as a technique for countering negative accusations against Scientology by diverting the critical statements and making counter-accusations against the accuser; in other words, to &quot;attack the attacker&quot;. Hubbard defined the PR (public relations) policy on &quot;dead agenting&quot; in a 1974 bulletin:

The phrase comes from a misunderstanding of the chapter on espionage in &quot;The Art of War&quot;.

The now-defunct Scientology-sponsored website &quot;Religious Freedom Watch&quot; was often cited by alt.religion.scientology users as a contemporary example of &quot;dead agenting&quot;. It contained false discreditable information about critics of the Church. According to the &quot;New York Press&quot;, the website was &quot;almost universally regarded as a Scientology front group designed to attack the Church&#x27;s critics.&quot; After one person pressured NYP to check the website for information on a particular person, NYP was unable to verify the information with any credible source. 

Dead agenting has also been carried out by flier campaigns against some critics—using so-called &quot;DA fliers&quot;. Bonnie Woods, an ex-member who began counseling people involved with Scientology and their families, became a target along with her husband in 1993 when the Church of Scientology started a leaflet operation denouncing her as a &quot;hate campaigner&quot; with demonstrators outside their home and around East Grinstead. After a long battle of libel suits, in 1999, the church agreed to issue an apology and to pay £55,000 damages and £100,000 in legal costs to the Woods.

===R2-45===

&quot;R2-45&quot; is the name given by L. Ron Hubbard to what he described as &quot;an enormously effective process for exteriorization but its use is frowned upon by this society at this time&quot;. In Scientology doctrine, exteriorization refers to the separation of the thetan (soul) from the body. According to the author Stewart Lamont, Hubbard defined R2-45 as a process by which exteriorization could be produced by shooting a person in the head with a .45 revolver.

While no &quot;R2-45 letters&quot; have been published, orders to use R2-45 on specific individuals were published in a monthly magazine for Scientologists. On March 6, 1968, Hubbard issued an internal memo titled &quot;RACKET EXPOSED&quot;, in which he denounced twelve people as &quot;Enemies of mankind, the planet and all life&quot;, and ordered that &quot;Any Sea Org member contacting any of them is to use Auditing Process R2-45.&quot; The memo was subsequently reproduced, with another name added, in the Church of Scientology&#x27;s monthly journal, &quot;The Auditor&quot;. Another four people were named in a second R2-45 order published in &quot;The Auditor&quot; later in 1968. 
==Criminal convictions of executives==
Much of the controversy surrounding Scientology is reflected in the long list of legal incidents associated with the organization including the criminal convictions of core members of the Scientology organization.

In 1978, a number of Scientologists, including L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s wife Mary Sue Hubbard (who was second in command in the organization at the time), were convicted of perpetrating what was at the time the largest incident of domestic espionage in the history of the United States, called &quot;Operation Snow White&quot;. This involved infiltrating, wiretapping, and stealing documents from the offices of Federal attorneys and the Internal Revenue Service. The judge who convicted Mary Sue Hubbard and ten accomplices described their attempt to plead freedom of religion in defense:

Eleven church staff members, including Mary Sue Hubbard and other highly placed officials, pleaded guilty or were convicted in federal court based on evidence seized in the raids and received sentences from two to six years (some suspended).

Other noteworthy incidents involving criminal accusations and prosecutions against the Church of Scientology include:

* On January 4, 1963, more than one hundred E-meters were seized by U.S. marshals at the Founding Church of Scientology building, now known as the L. Ron Hubbard House, located in Washington, D.C. The church was accused of making false claims that the devices effectively treated some 70 percent of all physical and mental illness. The FDA also charged that the devices did not bear adequate directions for treating the conditions for which they were recommended. Upon appeal, the E-meters were returned, with the direction that they should be used only in &quot;bona fide religious counseling&quot;, and that all meters and referring literature must include a label disclaiming any medical benefits. In the decision, the court gave recognition to Scientology&#x27;s &quot;constitutional right to protection from the government&#x27;s excessive entanglement with religion&quot; as written by James R. Lewis, in &quot;Scientology&quot;.
* In 1978, L. Ron Hubbard was convicted &quot;in absentia&quot; by French authorities of engaging in fraud, fined 35,000 francs, and sentenced to four years in prison. The head of the French Church of Scientology was convicted at the same trial and given a suspended one-year prison sentence.
* The FBI raid on the Church&#x27;s headquarters revealed documentation that detailed Scientology actions against various critics of the organization. Among these documents was a plan to frame Gabe Cazares, the mayor of Clearwater, Florida, with a staged hit-and-run accident. Also, plans were made to discredit the skeptical organization CSICOP by spreading rumors that it was a front for the CIA, and a project called &quot;Operation Freakout&quot; which aimed at ruining the life of Paulette Cooper, author of &quot;The Scandal of Scientology&quot;, an early book that had been critical of the movement.
* In 1988, the government of Spain arrested Scientology president Heber Jentzsch and ten other members of the organization on various charges including illicit association, coercion, fraud, and labor law violations. Jentzsch jumped bail, leaving Spain and returning to the United States after Scientology paid a bail bond of approximately $1 million, and he has not returned to the country since. Scientology fought the charges in court for fourteen years, until the case was finally dismissed in 2002.
* The Church of Scientology is the only religious organization in Canada to be convicted on the charge of breaching the public trust: &quot;The Queen v. Church of Scientology of Toronto, et al.&quot; (1992)
* In France, several officials of the Church of Scientology were convicted of embezzlement in 2001. The Church was listed as a &quot;dangerous cult&quot; in a parliamentary report. In May 2009, a trial commenced in France against Scientology, accusing it of organised fraud. The case focused on a complaint by a woman who says that after being offered a free personality test, she was pressured into paying large sums of money. The church is regarded as a sect in France. The result of the trial was that two branches of the organization and several of its leaders have been found guilty of fraud and fined. Alain Rosenberg, the group&#x27;s head in France, received a two-year suspended jail sentence.
* The Church of Scientology long considered the Cult Awareness Network (CAN) as one of its most important enemies, and many Scientology publications during the 1980s and 1990s cast CAN (and its spokesperson at the time, Cynthia Kisser) in an unfriendly light, accusing the cult-watchdog organization of various criminal activities. After CAN was forced into bankruptcy and taken over by Scientologists in the late 1990s, Scientology proudly proclaimed this as one of its greatest victories.
*In Belgium, after a judicial investigation since 1997, a trial against the organization was due to begin in 2008. Charges include formation of a criminal organization, the unlawful exercise of medicine, and fraud.
*In the United Kingdom the church has been accused of &quot;grooming&quot; City of London Police officers with gifts worth thousands of pounds.
*In Australia, Scientology has been temporarily banned in the 1960s in three out of six states; the use of the E-meter was similarly banned in Victoria. In Victoria, Scientology was investigated by the state government. In the conclusion to his report written as part of this investigation, Kevin Victor Anderson, Q.C. stated &quot;Scientology is a delusional belief system, based on fiction and fallacies and propagated by falsehood and deception&quot;. The report was later overturned by the High Court of Australia, which compelled the states to recognize Scientology as a religion for purposes of payroll taxes, stating &quot;Regardless of whether the members of are gullible or misled or whether the practices of Scientology are harmful or objectionable, the evidence, in our view, establishes that Scientology must, for relevant purposes, be accepted as &#x27;a religion&#x27; in Victoria.&quot;
*In 2009, a Paris court found the French Church of Scientology guilty of organized fraud and imposed a fine of nearly . The prosecution had asked for the Church to be banned, but a recent change in legislation made this impossible. The case had been brought by two ex-members who said they had been pressured into spending large amounts of money on Scientology courses and other services. Commenting on the verdict, the plaintiffs&#x27; attorney said, &quot;It&#x27;s the first time in France that the entity of the Church of Scientology is condemned for fraud as an organized gang&quot;. A Scientology spokesperson likened the judgment to &quot;an Inquisition for modern times&quot; and said the Church would appeal.

== Mistreatment of members ==

In 2007, a 25-year-old woman from Sydney was charged with murdering her father and sister and seriously injuring her mother. Her parents had prevented her from seeking the psychiatric treatment she needed because of their Scientology beliefs.

In 2012, Debbie Cook, who ran the &quot;spiritual Mecca&quot; for seventeen years, came forward and accused the church of repeated accounts of &quot;screaming, slapping&quot; and being &quot;made to stand in a trash and water&#x27;s poured over you&quot; in efforts to confess her sins. This was all done in &quot;The Hole&quot;, located at Scientology&#x27;s International base in Hemet, California. She claims that she was taken there against her will and forced to stay for seven weeks. The church states that she &quot;voluntarily&quot; participated in their program of &quot;religious discipline&quot;. &quot;Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath&quot; is a 2016–2017 A&amp;E documentary series that investigates abuses of the Church of Scientology by interviewing of former members.

===Death of Lisa McPherson===

The most widely publicized death of one of the organization&#x27;s members was that of 36-year-old Lisa McPherson while in the care of Scientologists at the Scientology-owned Fort Harrison Hotel, in Clearwater, Florida, in 1995. McPherson, at the time, was displaying symptoms suggesting she was struggling with mental illness; in one case, she removed all of her clothes after being involved in a minor traffic accident, later remarking she had done so in hopes of obtaining counseling. The Church, however, intervened to prevent McPherson from receiving psychiatric treatment and to keep her in Church custody. Records show that she was then placed in a Scientology program, the Introspection Rundown, which was forced isolation used to handle a psychotic episode. Weeks later, she was pronounced dead on arrival at a hospital. The autopsy identified multiple hematomas (bruises), an abrasion on the nose, and lesions that were consistent with &quot;insect/animal bites&quot;. An autopsy showed that she had died of a pulmonary embolism.

Florida authorities filed criminal charges against the Church of Scientology, who denied any responsibility for McPherson&#x27;s death and vigorously contested the charges. The prosecuting attorneys ultimately dropped the criminal case. After four years, a $100 million civil lawsuit filed by Lisa McPherson&#x27;s family was settled in 2004. The suit resulted in an injunction against the distribution of a film critical of Scientology, &quot;The Profit&quot;, which the Church claimed was meant to influence the jury. The terms of the settlement were sealed by the court.

===Death of Elli Perkins===

Another crime that received substantial news coverage involved the death of Elli Perkins. This included an installment on the CBS investigative news program &quot;48 Hours&quot;.

Perkins was a mother of two, a professional glass artist, and a Scientologist who lived in Western New York. She was a senior auditor at the Church of Scientology in Buffalo, New York. When her then 24-year-old son Jeremy began to show strange and disturbing behavior, Elli did not seek out psychiatric care but used treatment in accordance with Scientology. Scientologists believe that psychiatry &quot;doesn&#x27;t work.&quot;

First, the family sent Jeremy to Scientology&#x27;s Sea Org in California. He returned home some months later because Sea Org had not helped. Found trespassing outside the University at Buffalo on August 14, 2001, Jeremy was arrested and remanded to a local hospital after a court-ordered psychiatric exam confirmed that he had a diagnosis of schizophrenia.

Elli Perkins later convinced the court to release her son into her custody so she could seek alternatives to psychiatry. She also refused any treatment with anti-psychotic medications. Defense attorney John Nuchereno said that Jeremy&#x27;s condition declined over the summer of 2002. He was no longer able to work in the family business. The Church of Scientology ceased efforts to cure Jeremy and classified him as a Type III &quot;potential trouble source&quot; (psychotic).

In the fall of 2002, the family consulted Dr. Conrad Maulfair, an osteopathic physician and Scientologist. Maulfair concluded that Jeremy needed to be purged of certain chemical toxins in his body. Maulfair said he needed to be &quot;energized&quot; through vitamin therapy.

Jeremy became suspicious of his mother; he thought the vitamins were poisoning him. In February 2003, Elli took Jeremy to see Albert Brown, a self-taught &quot;natural healer&quot;. Elli planned to send Jeremy to live with Brown for treatment. He was to leave for Brown&#x27;s on March 13, 2003, but days beforehand began to act more aggressively. On the 13th, after a shower he retrieved a steak knife and tried to slit his wrists. Unsuccessful, Jeremy found his mother in the kitchen and attacked her as she spoke to a friend on the phone. Autopsy reports showed that Elli Perkins was stabbed 77 times.

Jeremy was charged with second degree murder but found not responsible by reason of mental disease. On January 29, 2004, after NY State Office of Mental Health exams, he was assessed &quot;Dangerously Mentally Ill&quot; and committed to a secure facility. Jeremy is on psychotropic medications, which court psychiatrists state have not cured him, but have stabilized his condition.

In March 2006, an advertisement in &quot;LA Weekly&quot; blamed the Church of Scientology for Perkins&#x27; violent death. The &quot;48 Hours&quot; segment on Perkins&#x27; death aired on October 28, 2006. Afterward, CBS reported they had received complaints from Scientologists.

===Death of Noah Lottick===
Noah Lottick was an American student of Russian studies who died by suicide on May 11, 1990, by jumping from a 10th-floor hotel window, clutching his only remaining money in his hands. After his death, a controversy arose revolving around his parents&#x27; concern over his membership in the Church of Scientology.

Noah Lottick had taken Scientology courses, for which he paid . Lottick&#x27;s friends and family remarked that after taking these courses he began to act strangely. They stated to &quot;Time&quot; magazine that he told them that his Scientologist teachers were telepathic, and that his father&#x27;s heart attack was purely psychosomatic. His parents said that he visited their home five days before his death, claiming they were spreading &quot;false rumors&quot; about him.

Lottick&#x27;s suicide was profiled in a &quot;Time&quot; cover story that was highly critical of Scientology, &quot;The Thriving Cult of Greed and Power&quot;, which received the Gerald Loeb Award, and later appeared in &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;.

Lottick&#x27;s father, Dr. Edward Lottick, stated that his initial impression of Scientology was that it was similar to Dale Carnegie&#x27;s techniques. However, after his son&#x27;s death, his opinion was that the organization is a &quot;school for psychopaths&quot;. He blamed Scientology for his son&#x27;s death, although no direct connection was determined. After Dr. Lottick&#x27;s remarks were published in the media, the Church of Scientology haggled with him over that Noah had allegedly paid to the Church and not utilized for services. The Church claimed Lottick had intended this to be a donation.

The Church of Scientology sued Richard Behar and &quot;Time&quot; magazine for $416 million. Dr. and Mrs. Lottick submitted affidavits affirming &quot;the accuracy of each statement in the article&quot;, and stating that Dr. Lottick had &quot;concluded that Scientology therapies were manipulations&quot;. They said that no Scientology staff members attended the funeral of their son. All counts against Behar and &quot;Time&quot; were later dismissed. Lottick&#x27;s father cited his son&#x27;s suicide as his motivation for researching cults, in his article describing a survey of physicians that he presented to the Pennsylvania State Medical Society.

The Church of Scientology issued a press release denying any responsibility for Lottick&#x27;s suicide. Spokesperson Mike Rinder was quoted in the &quot;St. Petersburg Times&quot; as saying that Lottick had an argument with his parents four days before his death. Rinder stated, &quot;I think Ed Lottick should look in the mirror ... I think Ed Lottick made his son&#x27;s life intolerable.&quot;

===Brainwashing===

The Church of Scientology is frequently accused by critics of employing brainwashing.

One alleged example of the Church&#x27;s possible brainwashing tactics is the Rehabilitation Project Force, to which church staff are assigned to work off alleged wrongdoings under conditions that many critics characterize as degrading. Some of these allegations are presented in Stephen Kent&#x27;s &quot;Brainwashing in Scientology&#x27;s Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF)&quot;.

L. Ron Hubbard is believed to have authored &quot;The Brainwashing Manual&quot;.

====The Anderson Report====
The final results of the Anderson Report in 1965 declared:

===Disconnection===

The Church of Scientology has been criticized for their practice of &quot;disconnection&quot; in which Scientologists are directed to sever all contact with family members or friends who criticize the faith. Critics including ex-members and relatives of existing members say that this practice has divided many families. The disconnection policy is considered by critics to be further evidence that the Church is a cult. By making its members entirely dependent upon a social network entirely within the organization, critics assert that Scientologists are kept from exposure to critical perspectives on the church and are put in a situation that makes it extremely difficult for members to leave the church, since apostates will be shunned by the Church and have already been cut off from family and friends.

The Church of Scientology acknowledges that its members are strongly discouraged from associating with &quot;enemies of Scientology&quot;, and likens the disconnection policy to the practice of shunning in religions such as the Amish. However, there is a consensus of religious scholars who oppose Scientology&#x27;s practice:
&quot;I just think it would be better for all concerned if they just let them go ahead and get out and everyone goes their own way, and not make such a big deal of it, the policy hurts everybody.&quot; J. Gordon Melton, Institute for the Study of American Religion, Santa Barbara, California.

&quot;It has to do with feeling threatened because you&#x27;re not that big. You do everything you can to keep unity in the group.&quot; F.K. Flinn, Washington University in St. Louis.

&quot;Some people I&#x27;ve talked to, they just wanted to go on with their lives and they wanted to be in touch with their daughter or son or parent. The shunning was just painful. And I don&#x27;t know what it was accomplishing. And the very terms they use are scary, aren&#x27;t they?&quot; Newton Maloney, Fuller Theological Seminary, Pasadena, California.

===Use of donations and preferential treatment of Scientologist celebrities===
Andre Tabayoyon, a former Scientologist and Sea Org staffer, testified in a 1994 affidavit that money from not-for-profit Scientology organizations and labor from those organizations (including the Rehabilitation Project Force) had gone to provide special facilities for Scientology celebrities, which were not available to other Scientologists:A Sea Org staffer...was taken along to do personal cooking for Tom Cruise and Miscavige at the expense of Scientology not for profit religious organizations. This left only 3 cooks at Gold to cook for 800 people three times a day... apartment cottages were built for the use of John Travolta, Kirstie Alley, Edgar Winter, Priscilla Presley, and other Scientology celebrities who are carefully prevented from finding out the real truth about the Scientology organization ... Miscavige decided to redo the meadow in beautiful flowers; Tens of thousands of dollars were spent on the project so that Cruise and Kidman could romp there. However, Miscavige inspected the project and didn&#x27;t like it. So the whole meadow was plowed up, destroyed, replowed and sown with plain grass.Tabayoyon&#x27;s account of the planting of the meadow was supported by another former Scientologist, Maureen Bolstad, who said that a couple of dozen Scientologists including herself were put to work on a rainy night through dawn on the project. &quot;We were told that we needed to plant a field and that it was to help Tom impress Nicole... but for some mysterious reason it wasn&#x27;t considered acceptable by Mr. Miscavige. So the project was rejected and they redid it&quot;.

==Legitimacy of Scientology as a religion==

The nature of Scientology is hotly debated in many countries. The Church of Scientology pursues an extensive public relations campaign arguing Scientology is a &quot;bona fide&quot; religion. The organization cites a number of studies and experts who support their position. Critics point out most cited studies were commissioned by Scientology to produce the desired results.

Many countries (including Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Mexico, Russia, the United Kingdom), while not prohibiting or limiting the activities of the Church of Scientology, have rejected its applications for tax-exempt, charitable status or recognition as a religious organization; it has been variously judged to be a commercial enterprise or a dangerous cult.

Scientology is legally accepted as a religion in the United States and Australia, and enjoys the constitutional protections afforded to religious practice in each country. In October 1993, the U.S. Internal Revenue Service recognized the Church as an &quot;organization operated exclusively for religious and charitable purposes&quot;. The Church offers the tax exemption as proof that it is a religion. (This subject is examined in the article on the Church of Scientology).

In 1982, the High Court of Australia ruled the State Government of Victoria lacked the right to declare the Church of Scientology was not a religion. The Court found the issue of belief to be the central feature of religion, regardless of the presence of charlatanism: &quot;Charlatanism is a necessary price of religious freedom, and if a self-proclaimed teacher persuades others to believe in a religion which he propounds, lack of sincerity or integrity on his part is not incompatible with the religious character of the beliefs, practices and observances accepted by his followers.&quot;

Other countries to have recognized Scientology as a religion include Spain, Portugal, Italy, Sweden, and New Zealand. The debate continues until today, with a new generation of critics continuing to question Scientology&#x27;s legitimacy as a religion.

===L. Ron Hubbard and starting a religion for money===

While the oft-cited rumor Hubbard made a bar bet with Robert A. Heinlein he could start a cult is unproven, many witnesses have reported that Hubbard said in their presence that starting a religion would be a good way to make money. These statements have led many to believe Hubbard hid his true intentions and was motivated solely by potential financial rewards.

Editor Sam Merwin, for example, recalled a meeting: &quot;I always knew he was exceedingly anxious to hit big money—he used to say he thought the best way to do it would be to start a cult.&quot; (December 1946) Writer and publisher Lloyd Arthur Eshbach reported Hubbard saying &quot;I&#x27;d like to start a religion. That&#x27;s where the money is.&quot; Writer Theodore Sturgeon reported Hubbard made a similar statement at the Los Angeles Science Fantasy Society. Likewise, writer Sam Moskowitz reported in an affidavit during an Eastern Science Fiction Association meeting on November 11, 1948, Hubbard had said &quot;You don&#x27;t get rich writing science fiction. If you want to get rich, you start a religion.&quot; Milton A. Rothman also reported to his son Tony Rothman he heard Hubbard make exactly that claim at a science fiction convention. In 1998, an A&amp;E documentary titled &quot;Inside Scientology&quot; shows Lyle Stuart reporting Hubbard stated repeatedly to make money, &quot;you start a religion.&quot;

According to &quot;The Visual Encyclopedia of Science Fiction&quot;, ed. Brian Ash, Harmony Books, 1977:...[Hubbard] began making statements to the effect that any writer who really wished to make money should stop writing and develop [a] religion, or devise a new psychiatric method. Harlan Ellison&#x27;s version (&quot;Time Out&quot;, UK, No 332) is that Hubbard is reputed to have told [John W.] Campbell, &quot;I&#x27;m going to invent a religion that&#x27;s going to make me a fortune. I&#x27;m tired of writing for a penny a word&quot;. Sam Moskowitz, a chronicler of science fiction, has reported that he himself heard Hubbard make a similar statement, but there is no first-hand evidence.

An article by Professor Benjamin Beith-Hallahmi documents the secular aspects of Scientology from Scientology&#x27;s own writings.

===Free Zone suppression===

The Church has taken steps to suppress the Free Zone, the term for a variety of groups and individuals who practice Scientology outside the strictures of the Church of Scientology proper, and shut down dissenters when possible. The CoS has used copyright and trademark laws to attack various Free Zone groups. Accordingly, the Free Zone avoids the use of officially trademarked Scientology words, including &#x27;Scientology&#x27; itself. In 2000, the Religious Technology Center unsuccessfully attempted to gain control over the web domain scientologie.org in a legal action against the Free Zone. &quot;Skeptic Magazine&quot; described the Free Zone as: &quot;...a group founded by ex-Scientologists to promote L. Ron Hubbard&#x27;s ideas independent of the COS [Church of Scientology].&quot; A &quot;Miami Herald&quot; article wrote that ex-Scientologists joined the Free Zone because they felt that Church of Scientology leadership had: &quot;...strayed from Hubbard&#x27;s original teachings.&quot; One Free Zone Scientologist identified as &quot;Safe&quot; was quoted in &quot;Salon&quot; as saying: &quot;The Church of Scientology does not want its control over its members to be found out by the public and it doesn&#x27;t want its members to know that they can get scientology outside of the Church of Scientology.&quot;

==Personality tests==
In 2008, Kaja Ballo, the 20-year-old daughter of Olav Gunnar Ballo, a Norwegian member of parliament, took a personality test organized by Scientologists in Nice, and received very negative feedback from it. A few hours later, she committed suicide. French police started an investigation of the Scientology church. In the wake of the Ballo suicide linked to the personality test, the spokesman for the church in Norway called the accusation deeply unfair and pointed out that Ballo had previously suffered eating disorders and psychiatric troubles.

The personality test has been condemned by the psychologist Rudy Myrvang. He called the test a recruitment tool, aimed at breaking down a person so that the Scientologists can build the test-taker back up.

==Treatment of Scientologists in Germany==
Based on the 1993 IRS decision granting Scientology tax-exempt status, the U.S. Department of State formally criticized Germany for discriminating against Scientologists and began to note Scientologists&#x27; complaints of harassment and discrimination in its annual Human Rights Reports, starting from the 1993 report. Since then, the U.S. Department of State has repeatedly expressed its concerns over the violation of Scientologists&#x27; individual rights posed by &quot;sect filters&quot;, whereby potential employees are required to divulge any association with Scientology before they are considered for a job. It has also warned that companies and artists associated with Scientology may be subject to &quot;government-approved discrimination and boycotts&quot; in Germany. Past targets of such boycotts have included Tom Cruise and jazz pianist Chick Corea.

In 1997, an open letter to then-German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, published as a newspaper advertisement in the &quot;International Herald Tribune&quot;, drew parallels between the &quot;organized oppression&quot; of Scientologists in Germany and Nazi policies espoused by Germany in the 1930s. The letter was signed by Dustin Hoffman, Goldie Hawn, and a number of other Hollywood celebrities and executives. Commenting on the matter, a spokesman for the U.S. Department of State criticized Germany&#x27;s treatment of Scientologists and said that Scientologists were indeed discriminated against in Germany, but condemned any comparisons of this treatment to the Nazis&#x27; treatment of Jews as extremely inappropriate, an opinion echoed by the United Nations Special Rapporteur on human rights.

German officials sharply rejected the accusations. They said that Germany guarantees the freedom of religion, but characterized Scientology as a profit-making enterprise, rather than a religion, and emphasized that precisely because of Germany&#x27;s Nazi past, Germany took a determined stance against all &quot;radical cults and sects, including right-wing Nazi groups&quot;, and not just against Scientology. According to a 1997 &quot;Time&quot; magazine article, most Germans consider Scientology a subversive organization, with pollsters reporting 70% popular support for banning Scientology in Germany.

In late 1997, the United States granted asylum to a German Scientologist, Antje Victore, who claimed she would be subject to religious persecution in her homeland. In 2000, the German &quot;Stern&quot; magazine published a report asserting that several rejection letters which the woman had submitted as part of her asylum application—ostensibly from potential employers who were rejecting her because she was a Scientologist—had in fact been written by fellow Scientologists at her request and that of the Office of Special Affairs and that she was in personal financial trouble and about to go on trial for tax evasion at the time she applied for asylum. On a 2000 visit to Clearwater, Florida, Ursula Caberta of the Scientology Task Force for the Hamburg Interior Authority likewise alleged that the asylum case had been part of an &quot;orchestrated effort&quot; by Scientology undertaken &quot;for political gain&quot;, and &quot;a spectacular abuse of the U.S. system&quot;. German expatriate Scientologists resident in Clearwater, in turn, accused Caberta of stoking a &quot;hate campaign&quot; in Germany that had &quot;ruined the lives and fortunes of scores of Scientologists&quot; and maintained that Scientologists had not &quot;exaggerated their plight for political gain in the United States&quot;. Mark Rathbun, a top Church of Scientology official, said that although Scientology had not orchestrated the case, &quot;there would have been nothing improper if it had&quot;.

==Scientology and Wikipedia==

In an effort to adhere to Wikipedia policy, the Arbitration Committee of the English Wikipedia decided in late-May 2009 to restrict editing from Church of Scientology IP addresses, to prevent self-serving edits by editors within CoS-administered networks. A &quot;host of anti-Scientologist editors&quot; were topic-banned as well. The committee concluded that both sides had &quot;gamed policy&quot; and resorted to &quot;battlefield tactics&quot;, with articles on living persons being the &quot;worst casualties&quot;. In 2022, the rule of IP addresses from the Church of Scientology being blocked as if they were open proxies was lifted.

==Church of Scientology&#x27;s response to criticism==

Scientology&#x27;s response to accusations of criminal behavior has been twofold; the church is under attack by an organized conspiracy, and each of the church&#x27;s critics is hiding a private criminal past. In the first instance, the Church of Scientology has repeatedly stated that it is engaged in an ongoing battle against a massive, worldwide conspiracy whose sole purpose is to &quot;destroy the Scientology religion.&quot; Thus, aggressive measures and legal actions are the only way the church has been able to survive in a hostile environment; they sometimes liken themselves to the early Mormons who took up arms and organized militia to defend themselves from persecution.

The church asserts that the core of the organized anti-Scientology movement is the psychiatric profession, in league with deprogrammers and certain government bodies (including elements within the FBI and the government of Germany.) These conspirators have allegedly attacked Scientology since the earliest days of the church, with the shared goal of creating a docile, mind-controlled population. As an official Scientology website explains:

L. Ron Hubbard proclaimed that all critics of Scientology are criminals. Hubbard wrote on numerous occasions that all of Scientology&#x27;s opponents are seeking to hide their own criminal histories, and the proper course of action to stop these attacks is to &quot;expose&quot; the hidden crimes of the attackers. The Church of Scientology does not deny that it vigorously seeks to &quot;expose&quot; its critics and enemies; it maintains that all of its critics have criminal histories, and they encourage hatred and &quot;bigotry&quot; against Scientology. Hubbard&#x27;s belief that all critics of Scientology are criminals was summarized in a policy letter written in 1967:

Scientology claims that it continues to expand and prosper despite all efforts to prevent it from growing; critics claim that the Church&#x27;s own statistics contradict its story of continuing growth. Church of Scientology Leader David Miscavige&#x27;s speeches are directed to insiders in tightly controlled venues, and are noted for hyperbole, itemized lists of accomplishments, overwhelmingly positive proclamations, and esoteric insider language.

The Church of Scientology has published a number of responses to criticism available online.

Analyses of Scientology&#x27;s counter-accusations and actions against its critics are available on a number of websites, including the critical archive Operation Clambake.

In 2013, attorneys for the Church of Scientology reacted negatively toward the CNN News Group, threatening legal action for its airing of a story covering the release of Lawrence Wright&#x27;s book, &quot;Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood, and the Prison of Belief&quot;. CNN News Group published the correspondence on its web site. The threats were not followed up by lawsuits.

<text>Smirnoff (; ) is a brand of vodka owned and produced by the British company Diageo. The Smirnoff brand began with a vodka distillery founded in Moscow by Pyotr Arsenievich Smirnov (1831–1898), but its modern incarnation traces back to the 1930s, by American liquor distributor Heublein. Distributed in 130 countries, it is manufactured in different countries depending on market, but is not currently produced in Russia or anywhere in Eastern Europe.

Smirnoff products include vodka, flavoured vodka, and malt beverages. In 2014, Smirnoff was the best selling vodka around the world.
The vodka is unaged, made using a traditional filtration method developed by P. A. Smirnov. Recipe No. 21 was created by Smirnov&#x27;s son Vladimir after escaping Russia during the October Revolution.

== History ==

Pyotr Arsenyevitch Smirnov (9 January 1831 – 29 November 1898) founded his vodka distillery in Moscow under the trade name PA Smirnov in 1864, pioneered charcoal filtration in the 1870s, and by 1886 had captured two-thirds of the market in Moscow by virtue of the first use of newspaper advertising while suppressing clerical calls for temperance by generously contributing to the clergy. Russian royalty reportedly regarded Smirnov as a favorite. When Pyotr died, his third son Vladimir succeeded him. The company flourished and produced more than four million cases of vodka per year.

When the Tsar nationalized the Russian vodka industry in 1904, Vladimir Smirnov was forced to sell his factory and the brand. During the October Revolution of 1917, the Smirnov family fled the country. In 1920, Vladimir Smirnov established a factory in Constantinople (present day Istanbul). Four years later he moved to Lwów (then in Second Polish Republic, now Lviv in Ukraine). He renamed the vodka &quot;Smirnoff&quot;. It sold marginally well but not nearly as it had in Russia prior to 1904. Although an additional distillery was founded in Paris in 1925, sales remained far less than that produced in Russia.

In the 1930s, Vladimir met Rudolph Kunett, a Russian who had emigrated in the 1920s to New York, and had succeeded in business. The Kunett family had been a supplier of grain to Smirnov in Moscow before the Revolution. In 1933, Vladimir sold Kunett the rights to Smirnoff vodka production and sales in North America. Kunett then returned to the United States, quit his sales job, and established his first North American distillery in Bethel, Connecticut, after the end of Prohibition in 1933. However, the business in North America was not as successful as Kunett had hoped. By 1938, Kunett could not afford the sales licenses, and contacted John Martin, president of Heublein, a company that specialized in the import and export of liquors and foreign foods. Using the $14,000 that the Heublein company made from a new product that ended up saving them from bankruptcy, Martin bought the rights to Smirnoff in 1939. His board thought he was mad. Americans were traditionally whiskey drinkers unfamiliar with vodka and so sales were slow. Sales picked up considerably after Heublein advertised it as a &quot;white whiskey&quot; with &quot;no taste, no smell&quot; sealed with whiskey corks.In 1982, the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company acquired Heublein Inc. for $1.4 billion. Its successor, RJR Nabisco, sold the division to Grand Metropolitan in 1987. In 1985 Heublein Corporate Audit Manager Hanson J Kan had recommended to Heublein that it acquire the Grand Metropolitan IDV Smirnoff licensee and its global locations. Grand Metropolitan merged with Guinness to form Diageo in 1997.

=== Since the 1990s ===

During the 1990s, one of Pyotr Smirnov&#x27;s descendants started producing Smirnov (Смирновъ) vodka in Russia, claiming to be &quot;The Only Real Smirnov.&quot; After a number of lawsuits, Smirnoff successfully reclaimed its trademark, while in 2006 Diageo concluded a joint venture deal with the Smirnov company.

The Smirnoff company had the naming rights to the Smirnoff Music Centre, a concert amphitheater in Dallas, Texas, from 2000-08. It also sponsored the Smirnoff Underbelly, a major venue at the Edinburgh Fringe.

In the late-1990s, Smirnoff introduced a series of new products onto the UK and later the European and North American market, which quickly became popular among young people, especially within the club scene (see &quot;Alcopops&quot;).

There are two different products by the name of &quot;Smirnoff Ice:&quot; one, sold in France and the United States, is a citrus-flavoured malt beverage (5.0% ABV) with variants in &quot;Original&quot;, and &quot;Triple Black&quot;. The other, sold in Europe (excluding France), Latin America, Australia and Canada, is a premixed vodka drink. It also has variants in &quot;Original&quot; and &quot;Black Ice&quot; (or in some markets, &quot;Triple Black&quot; or &quot;Double Black&quot;), ranging from 4.5% in the UK, to 7% ABV in different markets.

The Smirnoff Ice marketed in the United States contains no vodka, according to the official Smirnoff website. It is more similar to beer than to vodka, primarily because it is brewed. However outside of the US and countries who receive US manufactured vodka it does contain Smirnoff Vodka No. 21.

&quot;Smirnoff Ice Twisted&quot; was a spin-off of the American Smirnoff Ice that featured flavors such as Mandarin Orange and Green Apple. The confusion in branding between Smirnoff Twist Vodka and Smirnoff Twisted Malt Beverage resulted in the decision to drop the &quot;Twisted&quot; from the flavored line of Smirnoff Ice. It is sold in 22 oz. (650 ml) bottles and six-packs of 12 oz. (355 ml) bottles.

The next line of Smirnoff&#x27;s malt beverages to be produced was &quot;Raw Tea&quot;, similar to the brand Twisted Tea. It came in flavors such as Lemon, Peach, Raspberry and Green Tea. This product line was marketed most notably with the &quot;Tea Partay&quot; music video and website. It was sold in six-packs of 12 oz. (355 ml) bottles. It was discontinued in sometime in 2009.

&quot;Smirnoff Source&quot;, a lightly carbonated beer-alternative, was released in May 2007. It is citrus-flavoured and made with alcohol (3.5% ABV) and spring water and is sold in 4-packs of 1-quart (947 ml) bottles.

A line of 22 flavoured vodkas (based on the No. 21 Red Label) with the &quot;Twist&quot; moniker appended on the end of the name have also been introduced. Flavours include Green Apple, Orange, Cranberry, Raspberry, Citrus (Lemon), Vanilla, Strawberry, Black Cherry, Watermelon, Lime, Blueberry, White Grape, Melon (Honeydew/Cantaloupe), Pomegranate, Passion Fruit, Pear, Peach, Pineapple, Mango, Coconut, and most recently Amaretto.

In 2004, Smirnoff trialled a new blend of vodka in the UK and Canada called Smirnoff Penka. Marketing and distribution were handled by The Reserve Brands of Diageo plc. Penka is no longer available in the UK.

In a 2005 &quot;New York Times&quot; blind tasting of 21 vodkas, Smirnoff won as the &quot;hands-down favorite&quot;.

In 2010, Smirnoff introduced the Cocktail Range. Pomegranate Martini with Meyer Lemon-flavoured Liquor and pomegranate juice, Mojito with a dash of mint and Kaffir lime and Grand Cosmopolitan with cranberry juice. Tuscan Lemonade and Savannah Tea were later added. In 2014, Smirnoff introduced Smirnoff Sours vodkas, available in Fruit Punch, Watermelon, Green Apple, and Berry Lemon.

A 2013 study found that Smirnoff malt beverages were the second-most popular brand specific alcohols consumed by underage youths in the United States.

In 2016, Smirnoff introduced two new Smirnoff Ice flavors: Electric Mandarin and Electric Berry. Also in 2016, Smirnoff introduced the new Spiked line, available in Original, Screwdriver, and Hurricane Punch, as well as their Sourced line of fruit juice vodka, available in Ruby Red Grapefruit, Pineapple and Cranberry Apple.

In 2019, Smirnoff Ice partnered with luxury brand Cremsiffino.

In 2020, Diageo introduced sugar-free Smirnoff Ice, with 4.5% ABV.
Smirnoff was mistakenly targeted for boycotts during the Russian invasion of Ukraine; however, despite its Russian origin, the brand is owned by British company Diageo and for the US market is manufactured in Illinois.

<text>The Lockheed L-2000 was Lockheed Corporation&#x27;s entry in a government-funded competition to build the United States&#x27; first supersonic airliner in the 1960s. The L-2000 lost the contract to the Boeing 2707, but that competing design was ultimately canceled for political, environmental and economic reasons.

In 1961, President John F. Kennedy committed the government to subsidize 75% of the development of a commercial airliner to compete with the Anglo-French Concorde then under development. The director of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Najeeb Halaby, elected to improve on the Concorde&#x27;s design rather than compete head-to-head with it. The SST, which might have represented a significant advance over the Concorde, was intended to carry 250 passengers (a large number at the time, more than twice as many as Concorde), fly at Mach 2.7-3.0, and have a range of 4,000 mi (7,400 km).

The program was launched on June 5, 1963, and the FAA estimated that by 1990 there would be a market for 500 SSTs. Boeing, Lockheed, and North American officially responded. North American&#x27;s design was soon rejected, but the Boeing and Lockheed designs were selected for further study.

==Design and development==

===Early design studies===
Most of the major US aviation firms spent at least some time in the 1950s considering SST designs. Lockheed&#x27;s first attempts date to 1958. Lockheed sought an airplane with cruise speeds of around with takeoff and landing speeds that compared to large subsonic jets of the same era.

Early designs followed Lockheed&#x27;s tapered straight wing, similar to the one used on the F-104 Starfighter, with a delta-shaped canard for aerodynamic trim. During wind-tunnel tests, this design demonstrated substantial shifts in the airplane&#x27;s center of pressure (C/L). These would require large trim changes as the aircraft changed speed, causing trim drag.

A delta wing was substituted which alleviated a portion of the movement, but it was not deemed sufficient. Lockheed knew a variable geometry, swing-wing design could accomplish this goal, but felt it was too heavy: they preferred a fixed-wing solution. In a worst-case scenario, they were willing to design a fixed-wing aircraft using fuel for ballast.

By 1962, Lockheed arrived at a highly swept, cranked-arrow design featuring four engine pods buried in the wings and a canard. The improvement was closer to their goal, but still not optimal.

By 1963, they extended the leading edge of the wing forward to eliminate the need for the canard, and re-shaped the wing into a double-delta shape with a mild twist and camber. This, along with careful shaping of the fuselage, was able to control the shift in the center of pressure caused by the highly swept forward part of the wing developing lift supersonically. The engines were shifted from being buried in the wings to individual pods slung below the wings.

===Later design studies===
The new design was designated L-2000-1 and was 223 ft (70 m) long with a narrow-body 132 in (335.2 cm) wide fuselage to meet aerodynamic requirements, allowing for passenger seating of five abreast seating in coach and a four-abreast arrangement in first-class seating. A typical mixed-class seating layout would equal around 170 passengers, with high-density layouts exceeding 200 passengers.

The L-2000-1 featured a long, pointed nose that was almost flat on top and curved on the bottom, which allowed for improved supersonic performance, and could be drooped for takeoff and landing to provide adequate visibility. The wing design featured a sharp forward inboard sweep of 80°, with the remaining part of the wing&#x27;s leading edge swept back 60°, with an overall area of 8,370 ft² (778 m²). The high sweep angles produced powerful vortices on the leading edge which increased lift at moderate to high angles of attack, yet still retained stable airflow over the control surfaces during a stall. These vortices also provided good directional control as well, which was somewhat deficient with the nose drooped at low speeds. The wing, while only 3% thick, provided substantial lift due to its large area, which, aided by vortex lift, allowed takeoff and landing speeds comparable to a Boeing 707. Additionally, a delta wing is a naturally rigid structure which requires little stiffening.

The plane&#x27;s undercarriage was a traditional tricycle type with a twin-wheeled nose gear. Each of the two six-wheeled main gear utilized the same tires used on the Douglas DC-8, but which were filled with nitrogen and to lower pressures.

To provide an optimum entry date into service, Lockheed decided to use a beefed-up turbofan derivative of the Pratt &amp; Whitney J58. The J58 had already successfully proven itself as a high-thrust, high-performance jet engine on the top-secret Lockheed A-12 (and subsequently on the Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird.) Since it was a turbofan, it was deemed to be quieter than a typical turbojet at low altitude and low speed, required no afterburner for takeoff, and allowed reduced power settings. The engines were placed in cylindrical pods with a wedge-shaped splitter, and a squarish intake providing the inlet system for the aircraft. The inlet was designed with the goal of requiring no moving parts, and was naturally stable. To reduce the noise from sonic booms, rather than penetrate the sound barrier at a more ideal 30,000 ft (9,144 m), they intended to penetrate it at 42,000 ft (12,802 m) instead. It would not be possible on hot days, but on normal days this would be achievable. Acceleration would continue through the sound barrier to Mach 1.15, at which point sonic booms would be audible on the ground. The plane would climb precisely to minimize sonic boom levels. After an initial level-off at around 71,500 ft (21,793 m), the plane would cruise climb upwards, ultimately reaching 76,500 ft (23,317 m). Descents would also be performed in a precise way to reduce sonic boom levels until subsonic speeds were reached.

By 1964, the US Government issued new requirements regarding the SST Program which required Lockheed to modify their design, by now called the L-2000-2. The new design had numerous modifications to the wing; one change was rounding the front of the forward delta in order to eliminate the pitch-up tendency. To increase high-speed aerodynamic efficiency, the wing&#x27;s thickness was reduced to 2.3%, the leading edges were made sharper, the sweep angles were changed from 80/60° to 85/62°, and substantial twist and camber were added to the forward delta; much of the rear delta was twisted upwards to allow the elevons to remain flush at Mach 3.0. In addition, wing/body fairings were added on the underside of the fuselage where the wings are located, allowing a more normally shaped nose to be used. To retain low-speed performance, the rear delta was enlarged considerably; to increase the payload, the trailing edge featured a forward sweep of 10°, extending the inner part of the wing rearward. The new nose reduced the overall length to 214 ft (65.2 m) while retaining virtually the same internal dimensions. Wingspan was identical as before, and despite the thinner wing, the increased wing area of 9,026 ft² (838.5 m²) allowed the same takeoff performance. The airplane&#x27;s overall lift-to-drag ratio increased from 7.25 to 7.94.

During the course of the L-2000-2&#x27;s development, the engine previously selected by Lockheed was no longer deemed acceptable. During the time frame between the L-2000-1 and L-2000-2, Pratt and Whitney designed a new afterburning turbofan called the JTF-17A, which produced greater amounts of thrust. General Electric developed the GE4 which was an afterburning turbojet with variable guide-vanes, which was actually the less powerful of the two at sea level, but produced more power at high altitudes. Both engines required some degree of afterburner during cruise. Lockheed&#x27;s design favored the JTF-17A over the GE-4, but there was the risk that GE would win the engine competition and Lockheed would win the SST contract, so they developed new engine pods that could accommodate either engine. Aerodynamic modifications allowed a shorter engine pod to be used and which utilized a new inlet design. This inlet featured minimal external cowl angles and was precisely contoured to allow a high-pressure recovery using no moving parts, and allowed maximum performance with either engine option. To allow additional airflow for noise-reduction, or to aid afterburner performance, a set of suck-in doors was added to the rear portion of the pod. To provide mid-air braking capability for rapid deceleration and rapid descents, and to assist ground braking, part of the nozzle could be employed as a thrust reverser at speeds below Mach 1.2. The pods were also repositioned on the new wing to better shield them from abrupt changes in airflow.

The additional thrust from the new engines allowed supersonic penetration to be delayed until up to 45,000 ft (13,716 m) under virtually all conditions. Since at this point the possibility of supersonic overland flight was still considered to be an option, Lockheed also considered larger, shorter-ranged versions of the L-2000-2B. All designs weighed exactly the same, with a new tail design, changes to the fuselage length, extensions to the forward delta, increased capacity, and variations in fuel capacity. The largest version featured capacity for 250 domestic passengers, while the medium version featured transatlantic capability with 220 passengers. Despite the fuselage length changes, there was no appreciable increase in the risk of the aircraft pitching upwards too far (over-rotation) on takeoff.

===Design competition===

By 1966, the design took on its final form as the L-2000-7A and L-2000-7B. The L-2000-7A featured a re-designed wing and fuselage lengthened to 273 ft (83 m). The longer fuselage allows for a mixed-class seating of 230 passengers. The new wing featured a proportionately larger forward delta, with greater refinement to the wing&#x27;s twist and curvature. Despite having the same wingspan, the wing-area was increased to 9,424 ft² (875 m²), with a slightly reduced 84° sweepback, and an increased 65° main delta wing, with reduced forward sweep along the trailing edge. Unlike previous versions, this aircraft featured a leading-edge flap to increase lift at low speeds, and to allow a slight down-elevon deflection. The fuselage, as a result of greater length, changes to the wing design, and attempts to further reduce drag, featured a slight vertical thinning in the fuselage where the wings were, a more prominent wing/body &quot;belly&quot; to carry fuel and cargo, a longer nose, and a refined tail. Since the airplane was not as directionally stable as before, the plane featured a ventral fin, located on the underside of the trailing fuselage. The L-2000-7B was extended to 293 ft (89 m), utilizing a lengthened cabin and a more pronounced upward-curving tail to reduce the chance of the tail striking the runway during over-rotation. Both designs had the same maximum weight of 590,000 lb (267,600 kg), and the aerodynamic lift-to-drag ratio was increased to 8:1.

Full-scale mock-ups of the Boeing 2707-200 and L-2000-7 designs were presented to the FAA, and on December 31, 1966 the Boeing design was selected. The Lockheed design was judged simpler to produce and less risky, but its performance during takeoff and at high speed was slightly lower. Because of the JTF-17A, the L-2000-7 was also predicted to be louder as well. The Boeing design was considered more advanced, representing a greater lead over the Concorde and thus more fitting to the original design mandate. Boeing eventually changed its advanced variable-geometry wing design to a simpler delta-wing similar to Lockheed&#x27;s design, but with a tail. The Boeing SST was ultimately cancelled on May 20, 1971 after the US Congress stopped federal funding for the SST program on March 24, 1971.

<doc id="265816" wikidata="Q898312" url="?curid=265816" title="Open system (systems theory)">
<text>An open system is a system that has external interactions. Such interactions can take the form of information, energy, or material transfers into or out of the system boundary, depending on the discipline which defines the concept. An open system is contrasted with the concept of an isolated system which exchanges neither energy, matter, nor information with its environment. An open system is also known as a flow system.

The concept of an open system was formalized within a framework that enabled one to interrelate the theory of the organism, thermodynamics, and evolutionary theory. This concept was expanded upon with the advent of information theory and subsequently systems theory. Today the concept has its applications in the natural and social sciences.

In the natural sciences an open system is one whose border is permeable to both energy and mass. By contrast, a closed system is permeable to energy but not to matter. 

The definition of an open system assumes that there are supplies of energy that cannot be depleted; in practice, this energy is supplied from some source in the surrounding environment, which can be treated as infinite for the purposes of study. One type of open system is the radiant energy system, which receives its energy from solar radiation – an energy source that can be regarded as inexhaustible for all practical purposes.

==Social sciences==
In the social sciences an open system is a process that exchanges material, energy, people, capital and information with its environment. French/Greek philosopher Kostas Axelos argued that seeing the &quot;world system&quot; as inherently open (though unified) would solve many of the problems in the social sciences, including that of praxis (the relation of knowledge to practice), so that various social scientific disciplines would work together rather than create monopolies whereby the world appears only sociological, political, historical, or psychological. Axelos argues that theorizing a closed system contributes to &quot;making&quot; it closed, and is thus a conservative approach. The Althusserian concept of overdetermination (drawing on Sigmund Freud) posits that there are always multiple causes in every event.

David Harvey uses this to argue that when systems such as capitalism enter a phase of crisis, it can happen through one of a number of elements, such as gender roles, the relation to nature/the environment, or crises in accumulation. Looking at the crisis in accumulation, Harvey argues that phenomena such as foreign direct investment, privatization of state-owned resources, and accumulation by dispossession act as necessary outlets when capital has overaccumulated too much in private hands and cannot circulate effectively in the marketplace. He cites the forcible displacement of Mexican and Indian peasants since the 1970s and the Asian and South-East Asian financial crisis of 1997-8, involving &quot;hedge fund raising&quot; of national currencies, as examples of this.

Structural functionalists such as Talcott Parsons and neofunctionalists such as Niklas Luhmann have incorporated system theory to describe society and its components.

The sociology of religion finds both open and closed systems within the field of religion.

<text>A thermostat is a regulating device component which senses the temperature of a physical system and performs actions so that the system&#x27;s temperature is maintained near a desired setpoint.

Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a setpoint temperature. Examples include building heating, central heating, air conditioners, HVAC systems, water heaters, as well as kitchen equipment including ovens and refrigerators and medical and scientific incubators. In scientific literature, these devices are often broadly classified as thermostatically controlled loads (TCLs). Thermostatically controlled loads comprise roughly 50% of the overall electricity demand in the United States.

A thermostat operates as a &quot;closed loop&quot; control device, as it seeks to reduce the error between the desired and measured temperatures. Sometimes a thermostat combines both the sensing and control action elements of a controlled system, such as in an automotive thermostat.
The word thermostat is derived from the Greek words θερμός &quot;thermos&quot;, &quot;hot&quot; and στατός &quot;statos&quot;, &quot;standing, stationary&quot;.

==Overview==
A thermostat exerts control by switching heating or cooling devices on or off, or by regulating the flow of a heat transfer fluid as needed, to maintain the correct temperature. A thermostat can often be the main control unit for a heating or cooling system, in applications ranging from ambient air control to automotive coolant control. Thermostats are used in any device or system that heats or cools to a setpoint temperature. Examples include building heating, central heating, and air conditioners, kitchen equipment such as ovens and refrigerators, and medical and scientific incubators.

==Construction and control==
Thermostats use different types of sensors to measure temperatures and actuate control operations. Mechanical thermostats commonly use bimetallic strips, converting a temperature change into mechanical displacement, to actuate control of the heating or cooling sources. Electronic thermostats, instead, use a thermistor or other semiconductor sensor, processing temperature change as electronic signals, to control the heating or cooling equipment.

Conventional thermostats are example of &quot;bang-bang controllers&quot; as the controlled system either operates at full capacity once the setpoint is reached, or keeps completely off. Although it is the simplest program to implement, such control method requires to include some hysteresis in order to prevent excessively rapid cycling of the equipment around the setpoint. As a consequence, conventional thermostats cannot control temperatures very precisely. Instead, there are oscillations of a certain magnitude, usually 1-2 °C. Such control is in general inaccurate, inefficient and may induce more mechanical wear; it however, allows for more cost-effective compressors compared to ones with continuously variable capacity.

Another consideration is the time delay of the controlled system. To improve the control performance of the system, thermostats can include an &quot;anticipator&quot;, which stops heating/cooling slightly earlier than reaching the setpoint, as the system will continue to produce heat for a short while. Turning off exactly at the setpoint will cause actual temperature to exceed the desired range, known as &quot;overshoot&quot;. Bimetallic sensors can include a physical &quot;anticipator&quot;, which has a thin wire touched on the thermostat. When current passes the wire, a small amount of heat is generated and transferred to the bimetallic coil. Electronic thermostats have an electronic equivalent.

When higher control precision is required, a PID or MPC controller is preferred. However, they are nowadays mainly adopted for industrial purposes, for example, for semiconductor manufacturing factories or museums.

==Sensor types==

Early technologies included mercury thermometers with electrodes inserted directly through the glass, so that when a certain (fixed) temperature was reached the contacts would be closed by the mercury. These were accurate to within a degree of temperature.

Common sensor technologies in use today include:

* Bimetallic mechanical or electrical sensors.
* Expanding wax pellets
* Electronic thermistors and semiconductor devices
* Electrical thermocouples
These may then control the heating or cooling apparatus using:
* Direct mechanical control
* Electrical signals
* Pneumatic signals

==History==
Possibly the earliest recorded examples of thermostatic control were built by a Dutch innovator, Cornelis Drebbel (1572–1633), about 1620 in England. He invented a mercury thermostat to regulate the temperature of a chicken . This is one of the first recorded feedback-controlled devices.

Modern thermostatic control was developed in the 1830s by Andrew Ure (1778–1857), a Scottish chemist. The textile mills of the time needed a constant and steady temperature to operate optimally, so Ure designed the bimetallic thermostat, which would bend as one of the metals expanded in response to the increased temperature and cut off the energy supply.

Warren S. Johnson (1847–1911), of Wisconsin, patented a bi-metal room thermostat in 1883, and two years later sought a patent for the first multi-zone thermostatic control system.
Albert Butz (1849–1905) invented the electric thermostat and patented it in 1886.

One of the first industrial uses of the thermostat was in the regulation of the temperature in poultry incubators. Charles Hearson, a British engineer, designed the first modern incubator for eggs, which was taken up for use on poultry farms in 1879.

==Mechanical thermostats==
This covers only devices which both sense and control using purely mechanical means.

===Bimetal===
Domestic water and steam based central heating systems have traditionally been controlled by bi-metallic strip thermostats, and this is dealt with later in this article. Purely mechanical control has been localised steam or hot-water radiator bi-metallic thermostats which the individual flow. However, thermostatic radiator valves (TRV) are now being widely used.

Purely mechanical thermostats are used to regulate dampers in some rooftop turbine vents, reducing building heat loss in cool or cold periods.

Some automobile passenger heating systems have a thermostatically controlled valve to regulate the water flow and temperature to an adjustable level. In older vehicles the thermostat controls the application of engine vacuum to actuators that control water valves and flappers to direct the flow of air. In modern vehicles, the vacuum actuators may be operated by small solenoids under the control of a central computer.

===Wax pellet===

====Automotive====
Perhaps the most common example of purely mechanical thermostat technology in use today is the internal combustion engine cooling system thermostat, used to maintain the engine near its optimum operating temperature by regulating the flow of coolant to an air-cooled radiator. This type of thermostat operates using a sealed chamber containing a wax pellet that melts and expands at a set temperature. The expansion of the chamber operates a rod which opens a valve when the operating temperature is exceeded. The operating temperature is determined by the composition of the wax. Once the operating temperature is reached, the thermostat progressively increases or decreases its opening in response to temperature changes, dynamically balancing the coolant recirculation flow and coolant flow to the radiator to maintain the engine temperature in the optimum range.
On many automobile engines, including all Chrysler Group and General Motors products, the thermostat does not restrict flow to the heater core. The passenger side tank of the radiator is used as a bypass to the thermostat, flowing through the heater core. This prevents formation of steam pockets before the thermostat opens, and allows the heater to function before the thermostat opens. Another benefit is that there is still some flow through the radiator if the thermostat fails.

====Shower and other hot water controls====
A thermostatic mixing valve uses a wax pellet to control the mixing of hot and cold water. A common application is to permit operation of an electric water heater at a temperature hot enough to kill &quot;Legionella&quot; bacteria (above ), while the output of the valve produces water that is cool enough to not immediately scald ().

===Analysis===
A wax pellet driven valve can be analyzed through graphing the wax pellet&#x27;s hysteresis which consists of two thermal expansion curves; extension (motion) vs. temperature increase, and contraction (motion) vs. temperature decrease. The spread between the up and down curves visually illustrate the valve&#x27;s hysteresis; there is always hysteresis within wax driven valves due to the phase transition or phase change between solids and liquids. Hysteresis can be controlled with specialized blended mixes of hydrocarbons; tight hysteresis is what most desire, however some applications require broader ranges. Wax pellet driven valves are used in anti scald, freeze protection, over-temp purge, solar thermal energy or solar thermal, automotive, and aerospace applications among many others.

===Gas expansion===
Thermostats are sometimes used to regulate gas ovens. It consists of a gas-filled bulb connected to the control unit by a slender copper tube. The bulb is normally located at the top of the oven. The tube ends in a chamber sealed by a diaphragm. As the thermostat heats up, the gas expands applying pressure to the diaphragm which reduces the flow of gas to the burner.

===Pneumatic thermostats===
A pneumatic thermostat is a thermostat that controls a heating or cooling system via a series of air-filled control tubes. This &quot;control air&quot; system responds to the pressure changes (due to temperature) in the control tube to activate heating or cooling when required. The control air typically is maintained on &quot;mains&quot; at 15-18 psi (although usually operable up to 20 psi). Pneumatic thermostats typically provide output/ branch/ post-restrictor (for single-pipe operation) pressures of 3-15 psi which is piped to the end device (valve/ damper actuator/ pneumatic-electric switch, etc.).

The pneumatic thermostat was invented by Warren Johnson in 1895 soon after he invented the electric thermostat. In 2009, Harry Sim was awarded a patent for a pneumatic-to-digital interface that allows pneumatically controlled buildings to be integrated with building automation systems to provide similar benefits as direct digital control (DDC).

==Electrical and analog electronic thermostats==

===Bimetallic switching thermostats===

Water and steam based central heating systems have traditionally had overall control by wall-mounted bi-metallic strip thermostats. These sense the air temperature using the differential expansion of two metals to actuate an on/off switch. Typically the central system would be switched on when the temperature drops below the setpoint on the thermostat, and switched off when it rises above, with a few degrees of hysteresis to prevent excessive switching. Bi-metallic sensing is now being superseded by electronic sensors. A principal use of the bi-metallic thermostat today is in individual electric convection heaters, where control is on/off, based on the local air temperature and the setpoint desired by the user. These are also used on air-conditioners, where local control is required.

====Contact configuration nomenclature====
This follows the same nomenclature as described in and . A thermostat is considered to be activated by thermal energy, thus “normal” refers to the state in which temperature is below the setpoint.
* &quot;NO&quot; stands for &quot;normally open&quot;. This is the same as &quot;COR&quot; (&quot;close on rise&quot;). May be used to start a fan when it is becoming hot, and to stop the fan when it has become cold enough.
* &quot;NC&quot; stands for &quot;normally closed&quot;. This is the same as &quot;OOR&quot; (&quot;open on rise&quot;). May be used to start a heater when it is becoming cold, and to stop the heater when it has become warm enough.
* &quot;CO&quot; stands for &quot;change over&quot;. This serves both as &quot;NO&quot; and &quot;NC&quot;. May be used to start a fan when it is becoming hot, but also (on the opposite terminal), to start a heater when it is becoming cold.

Any leading number stands for number of contact sets, like &quot;1NO&quot;, &quot;1NC&quot; for one contact set with two terminals. &quot;1CO&quot; will also have one contact set, even if it is a switch-over with three terminals.

===Simple two wire thermostats===
The illustration is the interior of a common two wire heat-only household thermostat, used to regulate a gas-fired heater via an electric gas valve. Similar mechanisms may also be used to control oil furnaces, boilers, boiler zone valves, electric attic fans, electric furnaces, electric baseboard heaters, and household appliances such as refrigerators, coffee pots and hair dryers. The power through the thermostat is provided by the heating device and may range from millivolts to 240 volts in common North American construction, and is used to control the heating system either directly (electric baseboard heaters and some electric furnaces) or indirectly (all gas, oil and forced hot water systems). &quot;Due to the variety of possible voltages and currents available at the thermostat, caution must be taken when selecting a replacement device.&quot;

# Setpoint control lever. This is moved to the right for a higher temperature. The round indicator pin in the center of the second slot shows through a numbered slot in the outer case.
# Bimetallic strip wound into a coil. The center of the coil is attached to a rotating post attached to lever (1). As the coil gets colder the moving end — carrying (4) — moves clockwise.
# Flexible wire. The left side is connected via one wire of a pair to the heater control valve.
# Moving contact attached to the bimetal coil. Thence, to the heater&#x27;s controller.
# Fixed contact screw. This is adjusted by the manufacturer. It is connected electrically by a second wire of the pair to the thermocouple and the heater&#x27;s electrically operated gas valve.
# Magnet. This ensures a good contact when the contact closes. It also provides hysteresis to prevent short heating cycles, as the temperature must be raised several degrees before the contacts will open. As an alternative, some thermostats instead use a mercury switch on the end of the bimetal coil. The weight of the mercury on the end of the coil tends to keep it there, also preventing short heating cycles. However, this type of thermostat is banned in many countries due to its highly and permanently toxic nature if broken. When replacing these thermostats they must be regarded as chemical waste.

Not shown in the illustration is a separate bimetal thermometer on the outer case to show the actual temperature at the thermostat.

====Millivolt thermostats====
As illustrated in the use of the thermostat above, all of the power for the control system is provided by a thermopile which is a combination of many stacked thermocouples, heated by the pilot light. The thermopile produces sufficient electrical power to drive a low-power gas valve, which under control of one or more thermostat switches, in turn controls the input of fuel to the burner.

This type of device is generally considered obsolete as pilot lights can waste a surprising amount of gas (in the same way a dripping faucet can waste a large amount of water over an extended period), and are also no longer used on stoves, but are still to be found in many gas water heaters and gas fireplaces. Their poor efficiency is acceptable in water heaters, since most of the energy &quot;wasted&quot; on the pilot still represents a direct heat gain for the water tank. The Millivolt system also makes it unnecessary for a special electrical circuit to be run to the water heater or furnace; these systems are often completely self-sufficient and can run without any external electrical power supply. For tankless &quot;on demand&quot; water heaters, pilot ignition is preferable because it is faster than hot-surface ignition and more reliable than spark ignition.

Some programmable thermostats - those that offer simple &quot;millivolt&quot; or &quot;two-wire&quot; modes - will control these systems.

====24-volt thermostats====
The majority of modern heating/cooling/heat pump thermostats operate on low voltage (typically 24 volts AC) control circuits. The source of the 24 volt AC power is a control transformer installed as part of the heating/cooling equipment. The advantage of the low voltage control system is the ability to operate multiple electromechanical switching devices such as relays, contactors, and sequencers using inherently safe voltage and current levels. Built into the thermostat is a provision for enhanced temperature control using anticipation.

A heat anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the heating appliance is operating. This opens the heating contacts slightly early to prevent the space temperature from greatly overshooting the thermostat setting. A mechanical heat anticipator is generally adjustable and should be set to the current flowing in the heating control circuit when the system is operating.

A cooling anticipator generates a small amount of additional heat to the sensing element while the cooling appliance is not operating. This causes the contacts to energize the cooling equipment slightly early, preventing the space temperature from climbing excessively. Cooling anticipators are generally non-adjustable.

Electromechanical thermostats use resistance elements as anticipators. Most electronic thermostats use either thermistor devices or integrated logic elements for the anticipation function. In some electronic thermostats, the thermistor anticipator may be located outdoors, providing a variable anticipation depending on the outdoor temperature.

Thermostat enhancements include outdoor temperature display, programmability, and system fault indication. While such 24 volt thermostats are incapable of operating a furnace when the mains power fails, most such furnaces require mains power for heated air fans (and often also hot-surface or electronic spark ignition) rendering moot the functionality of the thermostat. In other circumstances such as piloted wall and &quot;gravity&quot; (fanless) floor and central heaters the low voltage system described previously may be capable of remaining functional when electrical power is unavailable.

There are no standards for wiring color codes, but convention has settled on the following terminal codes and colors.
In all cases, the manufacturer&#x27;s instructions should be considered definitive.
Older, mostly deprecated designations:
====Line-voltage thermostats====
Line voltage thermostats are most commonly used for electric space heaters such as a baseboard heater or a direct-wired electric furnace. If a line voltage thermostat is used, system power (in the United States, 120 or 240 volts) is directly switched by the thermostat. With switching current often exceeding 40 amperes, using a low voltage thermostat on a line voltage circuit will result at least in the failure of the thermostat and possibly a fire. Line voltage thermostats are sometimes used in other applications, such as the control of fan-coil (fan powered from line voltage blowing through a coil of tubing which is either heated or cooled by a larger system) units in large systems using centralized boilers and chillers, or to control circulation pumps in hydronic heating applications.

Some programmable thermostats are available to control line-voltage systems. Baseboard heaters will especially benefit from a programmable thermostat which is capable of continuous control (as are at least some Honeywell models), effectively controlling the heater like a lamp dimmer, and gradually increasing and decreasing heating to ensure an extremely constant room temperature (continuous control rather than relying on the averaging effects of hysteresis). Systems which include a fan (electric furnaces, wall heaters, etc.) must typically use simple on/off controls.

==Digital electronic thermostats==

Newer digital thermostats have no moving parts to measure temperature and instead rely on thermistors or other semiconductor devices such as a resistance thermometer (resistance temperature detector). Typically one or more regular batteries must be installed to operate it, although some so-called &quot;power stealing&quot; digital thermostats (operated for energy harvesting) use the common 24-volt AC circuits as a power source, but will not operate on thermopile powered &quot;millivolt&quot; circuits used in some furnaces. Each has an LCD screen showing the current temperature, and the current setting. Most also have a clock, and time-of-day and even day-of-week settings for the temperature, used for comfort and energy conservation. Some advanced models have touch screens, or the ability to work with home automation or building automation systems.

Digital thermostats use either a relay or a semiconductor device such as triac to act as a switch to control the HVAC unit. Units with relays will operate millivolt systems, but often make an audible &quot;click&quot; noise when switching on or off.

HVAC systems with the ability to modulate their output can be combined with thermostats that have a built-in PID controller to achieve smoother operation. There are also modern thermostats featuring adaptive algorithms to further improve the inertia prone system behaviour. For instance, setting those up so that the temperature in the morning at 7 a.m. should be 21 °C (69.8 °F), makes sure that at that time the temperature will be 21 °C (69.8 °F), where a conventional thermostat would just start working at that time. The algorithms decide at what time the system should be activated in order to reach the desired temperature at the desired time. Other thermostat used for process/industrial control where on/off control is not suitable the PID control can also makes sure that the temperature is very stable (for instance, by reducing overshoots by fine tuning PID constants for set value (SV) or maintaining temperature in a band by deploying hysteresis control.)

Most digital thermostats in common residential use in North America and Europe are programmable thermostats, which will typically provide a 30% energy savings if left with their default programs; adjustments to these defaults may increase or reduce energy savings. The programmable thermostat article provides basic information on the operation, selection and installation of such a thermostat.

==Thermostats and HVAC operation==

===Ignition sequences in modern conventional systems===
; Gas
:# Start draft inducer fan/blower (if the furnace is relatively recent) to create a column of air flowing up the chimney
:# Heat ignitor or start spark-ignition system
:# Open gas valve to ignite main burners
:# Wait (if furnace is relatively recent) until the heat exchanger is at proper operating temperature before starting main blower fan or circulator pump
; Oil
: Similar to gas, except rather than opening a valve, the furnace will start an oil pump to inject oil into the burner
; Electric
: The blower fan or circulator pump will be started, and a large electromechanical relay or TRIAC will turn on the heating elements
; Coal, grain or pellet
: Generally rare today (though grains such as corn, wheat, and barley, or pellets made of wood, bark, or cardboard are increasing in popularity); similar to gas, except rather than opening a valve, the furnace will start a screw to drive coal/grain/pellets into the firebox

With non-zoned (typical residential, one thermostat for the whole house) systems, when the thermostat&#x27;s R (or Rh) and W terminals are connected, the furnace will go through its start-up procedure and produce heat.

With zoned systems (some residential, many commercial systems — several thermostats controlling different &quot;zones&quot; in the building), the thermostat will cause small electric motors to open valves or dampers and start the furnace or boiler if it is not already running.

Most programmable thermostats will control these systems.

===Combination heating/cooling regulation===
Depending on what is being controlled, a forced-air air conditioning thermostat generally has an external switch for heat/off/cool, and another on/auto to turn the blower fan on constantly or only when heating and cooling are running. Four wires come to the centrally-located thermostat from the main heating/cooling unit (usually located in a closet, basement, or occasionally in the attic): One wire, usually red, supplies 24 volts AC power to the thermostat, while the other three supply control signals from the thermostat, usually white for heat, yellow for cooling, and green to turn on the blower fan. The power is supplied by a transformer, and when the thermostat makes contact between the 24 volt power and one or two of the other wires, a relay back at the heating/cooling unit activates the corresponding heat/fan/cool function of the unit(s).

A thermostat, when set to &quot;cool&quot;, will only turn on when the ambient temperature of the surrounding room is above the set temperature. Thus, if the controlled space has a temperature normally above the desired setting when the heating/cooling system is off, it would be wise to keep the thermostat set to &quot;cool&quot;, despite what the temperature is outside. On the other hand, if the temperature of the controlled area falls below the desired degree, then it is advisable to turn the thermostat to &quot;heat&quot;.

===Heat pump regulation===

The heat pump is a refrigeration based appliance which reverses refrigerant flow between the indoor and outdoor coils. This is done by energizing a reversing valve (also known as a &quot;4-way&quot; or &quot;change-over&quot; valve). During cooling, the indoor coil is an evaporator removing heat from the indoor air and transferring it to the outdoor coil where it is rejected to the outdoor air. During heating, the outdoor coil becomes the evaporator and heat is removed from the outdoor air and transferred to the indoor air through the indoor coil. The reversing valve, controlled by the thermostat, causes the change-over from heat to cool. Residential heat pump thermostats generally have an &quot;O&quot; terminal to energize the reversing valve in cooling. Some residential and many commercial heat pump thermostats use a &quot;B&quot; terminal to energize the reversing valve in heating. The heating capacity of a heat pump decreases as outdoor temperatures fall. At some outdoor temperature (called the balance point) the ability of the refrigeration system to transfer heat into the building falls below the heating needs of the building. A typical heat pump is fitted with electric heating elements to supplement the refrigeration heat when the outdoor temperature is below this balance point. Operation of the supplemental heat is controlled by a second stage heating contact in the heat pump thermostat. During heating, the outdoor coil is operating at a temperature below the outdoor temperature and condensation on the coil may take place. This condensation may then freeze onto the coil, reducing its heat transfer capacity. Heat pumps therefore have a provision for occasional defrost of the outdoor coil. This is done by reversing the cycle to the cooling mode, shutting off the outdoor fan, and energizing the electric heating elements. The electric heat in defrost mode is needed to keep the system from blowing cold air inside the building. The elements are then used in the &quot;reheat&quot; function. Although the thermostat may indicate the system is in defrost and electric heat is activated, the defrost function is not controlled by the thermostat. Since the heat pump has electric heat elements for supplemental and reheats, the heat pump thermostat provides for use of the electric heat elements should the refrigeration system fail. This function is normally activated by an &quot;E&quot; terminal on the thermostat. When in emergency heat, the thermostat makes no attempt to operate the compressor or outdoor fan.

===Thermostat location===
The thermostat should not be located on an outside wall or where it could be exposed to direct sunlight at any time during the day. It should be located away from the room&#x27;s cooling or heating vents or device, yet exposed to general airflow from the room(s) to be regulated. An open hallway may be most appropriate for a single zone system, where living rooms and bedrooms are operated as a single zone. If the hallway may be closed by doors from the regulated spaces then these should be left open when the system is in use. If the thermostat is too close to the source controlled then the system will tend to &quot;short a cycle&quot;, and numerous starts and stops can be annoying and in some cases shorten equipment life. A multiple zoned system can save considerable energy by regulating individual spaces, allowing unused rooms to vary in temperature by turning off the heating and cooling.

=== Setback temperature ===
HVAC systems take a long time, usually one to several hours, to cool down or warm up the space from near outdoor conditions in summer or winter. Thus, it is a common practice to set setback temperatures when the space is not occupied (night and/or holidays). On the one hand, compared with maintaining at the original setpoint, substantial energy consumption can be saved. On the other hand, compared with turning off the system completely, it avoids room temperature drifting too much from the comfort zone, thus reducing the time of possible discomfort when the space is again occupied. New thermostats are mostly programmable and include an internal clock that allows this setback feature to be easily incorporated.

=== Dummy thermostats ===
It has been reported that many thermostats in office buildings are non-functional dummy devices, installed to give tenants&#x27; employees an illusion of control. These dummy thermostats are in effect a type of placebo button. However, these thermostats are often used to detect the temperature in the zone, even though their controls are disabled. This function is often referred to as &quot;lockout&quot;.

<text>Thermodynamic equilibrium is a notion of thermodynamics with axiomatic status referring to an internal state of a single thermodynamic system, or a relation between several thermodynamic systems connected by more or less permeable or impermeable walls. In thermodynamic equilibrium, there are no net macroscopic flows of mass nor of energy within a system or between systems. In a system that is in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, not only is there an absence of macroscopic change, but there is an “absence of any &quot;tendency&quot; toward change on a macroscopic scale.”

Systems in mutual thermodynamic equilibrium are simultaneously in mutual thermal, mechanical, chemical, and radiative equilibria. Systems can be in one kind of mutual equilibrium, while not in others. In thermodynamic equilibrium, all kinds of equilibrium hold at once and indefinitely, unless disturbed by a thermodynamic operation. In a macroscopic equilibrium, perfectly or almost perfectly balanced microscopic exchanges occur; this is the physical explanation of the notion of macroscopic equilibrium.

A thermodynamic system in a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium has a spatially uniform temperature. Its intensive properties, other than temperature, may be driven to spatial inhomogeneity by an unchanging long-range force field imposed on it by its surroundings.

In systems that are at a state of non-equilibrium there are, by contrast, net flows of matter or energy. If such changes can be triggered to occur in a system in which they are not already occurring, the system is said to be in a &quot;meta-stable equilibrium&quot;.

Though not a widely named &quot;law,&quot; it is an axiom of thermodynamics that there exist states of thermodynamic equilibrium. The second law of thermodynamics states that when an isolated body of material starts from an equilibrium state, in which portions of it are held at different states by more or less permeable or impermeable partitions, and a thermodynamic operation removes or makes the partitions more permeable, then it spontaneously reaches its own new state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium and this is accompanied by an increase in the sum of the entropies of the portions.

== Overview ==

Classical thermodynamics deals with states of dynamic equilibrium. The state of a system at thermodynamic equilibrium is the one for which some thermodynamic potential is minimized (in the absence of an applied voltage), or for which the entropy (&quot;S&quot;) is maximized, for specified conditions. One such potential is the Helmholtz free energy (&quot;A&quot;), for a closed system at constant volume and temperature (controlled by a heat bath):

:formula_1

Another potential, the Gibbs free energy (&quot;G&quot;), is minimized at thermodynamic equilibrium in a closed system at constant temperature and pressure, both controlled by the surroundings:

:formula_2

where &quot;T&quot; denotes the absolute thermodynamic temperature, &quot;P&quot; the pressure, &quot;S&quot; the entropy, &quot;V&quot; the volume, and &quot;U&quot; the internal energy of the system. In other words, formula_3 is a necessary condition for chemical equilibrium under these conditions (in the absence of an applied voltage).

Thermodynamic equilibrium is the unique stable stationary state that is approached or eventually reached as the system interacts with its surroundings over a long time. The above-mentioned potentials are mathematically constructed to be the thermodynamic quantities that are minimized under the particular conditions in the specified surroundings.

== Conditions ==
* For a completely isolated system, &quot;S&quot; is maximum at thermodynamic equilibrium.
* For a closed system at controlled constant temperature and volume, &quot;A&quot; is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium.
* For a closed system at controlled constant temperature and pressure without an applied voltage, &quot;G&quot; is minimum at thermodynamic equilibrium.

The various types of equilibriums are achieved as follows:
* Two systems are in &quot;thermal equilibrium&quot; when their temperatures are the same.
* Two systems are in &quot;mechanical equilibrium&quot; when their pressures are the same.
* Two systems are in &quot;diffusive equilibrium&quot; when their chemical potentials are the same.
* All forces are balanced and there is no significant external driving force.

==Relation of exchange equilibrium between systems==

Often the surroundings of a thermodynamic system may also be regarded as another thermodynamic system. In this view, one may consider the system and its surroundings as two systems in mutual contact, with long-range forces also linking them. The enclosure of the system is the surface of contiguity or boundary between the two systems. In the thermodynamic formalism, that surface is regarded as having specific properties of permeability. For example, the surface of contiguity may be supposed to be permeable only to heat, allowing energy to transfer only as heat. Then the two systems are said to be in thermal equilibrium when the long-range forces are unchanging in time and the transfer of energy as heat between them has slowed and eventually stopped permanently; this is an example of a contact equilibrium. Other kinds of contact equilibrium are defined by other kinds of specific permeability. When two systems are in contact equilibrium with respect to a particular kind of permeability, they have common values of the intensive variable that belongs to that particular kind of permeability. Examples of such intensive variables are temperature, pressure, chemical potential.

A contact equilibrium may be regarded also as an exchange equilibrium. There is a zero balance of rate of transfer of some quantity between the two systems in contact equilibrium. For example, for a wall permeable only to heat, the rates of diffusion of internal energy as heat between the two systems are equal and opposite. An adiabatic wall between the two systems is &#x27;permeable&#x27; only to energy transferred as work; at mechanical equilibrium the rates of transfer of energy as work between them are equal and opposite. If the wall is a simple wall, then the rates of transfer of volume across it are also equal and opposite; and the pressures on either side of it are equal. If the adiabatic wall is more complicated, with a sort of leverage, having an area-ratio, then the pressures of the two systems in exchange equilibrium are in the inverse ratio of the volume exchange ratio; this keeps the zero balance of rates of transfer as work.

A radiative exchange can occur between two otherwise separate systems. Radiative exchange equilibrium prevails when the two systems have the same temperature.

==Thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium of a system==

A collection of matter may be entirely isolated from its surroundings. If it has been left undisturbed for an indefinitely long time, classical thermodynamics postulates that it is in a state in which no changes occur within it, and there are no flows within it. This is a thermodynamic state of internal equilibrium. (This postulate is sometimes, but not often, called the &quot;minus first&quot; law of thermodynamics. One textbook calls it the &quot;zeroth law&quot;, remarking that the authors think this more befitting that title than its more customary definition, which apparently was suggested by Fowler.)

Such states are a principal concern in what is known as classical or equilibrium thermodynamics, for they are the only states of the system that are regarded as well defined in that subject. A system in contact equilibrium with another system can by a thermodynamic operation be isolated, and upon the event of isolation, no change occurs in it. A system in a relation of contact equilibrium with another system may thus also be regarded as being in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium.

==Multiple contact equilibrium==

The thermodynamic formalism allows that a system may have contact with several other systems at once, which may or may not also have mutual contact, the contacts having respectively different permeabilities. If these systems are all jointly isolated from the rest of the world those of them that are in contact then reach respective contact equilibria with one another.

If several systems are free of adiabatic walls between each other, but are jointly isolated from the rest of the world, then they reach a state of multiple contact equilibrium, and they have a common temperature, a total internal energy, and a total entropy. Amongst intensive variables, this is a unique property of temperature. It holds even in the presence of long-range forces. (That is, there is no &quot;force&quot; that can maintain temperature discrepancies.) For example, in a system in thermodynamic equilibrium in a vertical gravitational field, the pressure on the top wall is less than that on the bottom wall, but the temperature is the same everywhere.

A thermodynamic operation may occur as an event restricted to the walls that are within the surroundings, directly affecting neither the walls of contact of the system of interest with its surroundings, nor its interior, and occurring within a definitely limited time. For example, an immovable adiabatic wall may be placed or removed within the surroundings. Consequent upon such an operation restricted to the surroundings, the system may be for a time driven away from its own initial internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium. Then, according to the second law of thermodynamics, the whole undergoes changes and eventually reaches a new and final equilibrium with the surroundings. Following Planck, this consequent train of events is called a natural thermodynamic process. It is allowed in equilibrium thermodynamics just because the initial and final states are of thermodynamic equilibrium, even though during the process there is transient departure from thermodynamic equilibrium, when neither the system nor its surroundings are in well defined states of internal equilibrium. A natural process proceeds at a finite rate for the main part of its course. It is thereby radically different from a fictive quasi-static &#x27;process&#x27; that proceeds infinitely slowly throughout its course, and is fictively &#x27;reversible&#x27;. Classical thermodynamics allows that even though a process may take a very long time to settle to thermodynamic equilibrium, if the main part of its course is at a finite rate, then it is considered to be natural, and to be subject to the second law of thermodynamics, and thereby irreversible. Engineered machines and artificial devices and manipulations are permitted within the surroundings. The allowance of such operations and devices in the surroundings but not in the system is the reason why Kelvin in one of his statements of the second law of thermodynamics spoke of &quot;inanimate&quot; agency; a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is inanimate.

Otherwise, a thermodynamic operation may directly affect a wall of the system.

It is often convenient to suppose that some of the surrounding subsystems are so much larger than the system that the process can affect the intensive variables only of the surrounding subsystems, and they are then called reservoirs for relevant intensive variables.

== Local and global equilibrium ==
It can be useful to distinguish between global and local thermodynamic equilibrium. In thermodynamics, exchanges within a system and between the system and the outside are controlled by intensive parameters. As an example, temperature controls heat exchanges. &quot;Global thermodynamic equilibrium&quot; (GTE) means that those intensive parameters are homogeneous throughout the whole system, while &quot;local thermodynamic equilibrium&quot; (LTE) means that those intensive parameters are varying in space and time, but are varying so slowly that, for any point, one can assume thermodynamic equilibrium in some neighborhood about that point.

If the description of the system requires variations in the intensive parameters that are too large, the very assumptions upon which the definitions of these intensive parameters are based will break down, and the system will be in neither global nor local equilibrium. For example, it takes a certain number of collisions for a particle to equilibrate to its surroundings. If the average distance it has moved during these collisions removes it from the neighborhood it is equilibrating to, it will never equilibrate, and there will be no LTE. Temperature is, by definition, proportional to the average internal energy of an equilibrated neighborhood. Since there is no equilibrated neighborhood, the concept of temperature doesn&#x27;t hold, and the temperature becomes undefined.

This local equilibrium may apply only to a certain subset of particles in the system. For example, LTE is usually applied only to massive particles. In a radiating gas, the photons being emitted and absorbed by the gas do not need to be in a thermodynamic equilibrium with each other or with the massive particles of the gas for LTE to exist. In some cases, it is not considered necessary for free electrons to be in equilibrium with the much more massive atoms or molecules for LTE to exist.

As an example, LTE will exist in a glass of water that contains a melting ice cube. The temperature inside the glass can be defined at any point, but it is colder near the ice cube than far away from it. If energies of the molecules located near a given point are observed, they will be distributed according to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for a certain temperature. If the energies of the molecules located near another point are observed, they will be distributed according to the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution for another temperature.

Local thermodynamic equilibrium does not require either local or global stationarity. In other words, each small locality need not have a constant temperature. However, it does require that each small locality change slowly enough to practically sustain its local Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of molecular velocities. A global non-equilibrium state can be stably stationary only if it is maintained by exchanges between the system and the outside. For example, a globally-stable stationary state could be maintained inside the glass of water by continuously adding finely powdered ice into it to compensate for the melting, and continuously draining off the meltwater. Natural transport phenomena may lead a system from local to global thermodynamic equilibrium. Going back to our example, the diffusion of heat will lead our glass of water toward global thermodynamic equilibrium, a state in which the temperature of the glass is completely homogeneous.

==Reservations==

Careful and well informed writers about thermodynamics, in their accounts of thermodynamic equilibrium, often enough make provisos or reservations to their statements. Some writers leave such reservations merely implied or more or less unstated.

For example, one widely cited writer, H. B. Callen writes in this context: &quot;In actuality, few systems are in absolute and true equilibrium.&quot; He refers to radioactive processes and remarks that they may take &quot;cosmic times to complete, [and] generally can be ignored&quot;. He adds &quot;In practice, the criterion for equilibrium is circular. &quot;Operationally, a system is in an equilibrium state if its properties are consistently described by thermodynamic theory!&quot;&quot;

J.A. Beattie and I. Oppenheim write: &quot;Insistence on a strict interpretation of the definition of equilibrium would rule out the application of thermodynamics to practically all states of real systems.&quot;

Another author, cited by Callen as giving a &quot;scholarly and rigorous treatment&quot;, and cited by Adkins as having written a &quot;classic text&quot;, A.B. Pippard writes in that text: &quot;Given long enough a supercooled vapour will eventually condense, ... . The time involved may be so enormous, however, perhaps 10100 years or more, ... . For most purposes, provided the rapid change is not artificially stimulated, the systems may be regarded as being in equilibrium.&quot;

Another author, A. Münster, writes in this context. He observes that thermonuclear processes often occur so slowly that they can be ignored in thermodynamics. He comments: &quot;The concept &#x27;absolute equilibrium&#x27; or &#x27;equilibrium with respect to all imaginable processes&#x27;, has therefore, no physical significance.&quot; He therefore states that: &quot;... we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.&quot;

According to L. Tisza: &quot;... in the discussion of phenomena near absolute zero. The absolute predictions of the classical theory become particularly vague because the occurrence of frozen-in nonequilibrium states is very common.&quot;

==Definitions==

The most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium of a system is through contact with the surroundings that allows simultaneous passages of all chemical substances and all kinds of energy. A system in thermodynamic equilibrium may move with uniform acceleration through space but must not change its shape or size while doing so; thus it is defined by a rigid volume in space. It may lie within external fields of force, determined by external factors of far greater extent than the system itself, so that events within the system cannot in an appreciable amount affect the external fields of force. The system can be in thermodynamic equilibrium only if the external force fields are uniform, and are determining its uniform acceleration, or if it lies in a non-uniform force field but is held stationary there by local forces, such as mechanical pressures, on its surface.

Thermodynamic equilibrium is a primitive notion of the theory of thermodynamics. According to P.M. Morse: &quot;It should be emphasized that the fact that there are thermodynamic states, ..., and the fact that there are thermodynamic variables which are uniquely specified by the equilibrium state ... are &quot;not&quot; conclusions deduced logically from some philosophical first principles. They are conclusions ineluctably drawn from more than two centuries of experiments.&quot; This means that thermodynamic equilibrium is not to be defined solely in terms of other theoretical concepts of thermodynamics. M. Bailyn proposes a fundamental law of thermodynamics that defines and postulates the existence of states of thermodynamic equilibrium.

Textbook definitions of thermodynamic equilibrium are often stated carefully, with some reservation or other.

For example, A. Münster writes: &quot;An isolated system is in thermodynamic equilibrium when, in the system, no changes of state are occurring at a measurable rate.&quot; There are two reservations stated here; the system is isolated; any changes of state are immeasurably slow. He discusses the second proviso by giving an account of a mixture oxygen and hydrogen at room temperature in the absence of a catalyst. Münster points out that a thermodynamic equilibrium state is described by fewer macroscopic variables than is any other state of a given system. This is partly, but not entirely, because all flows within and through the system are zero.

R. Haase&#x27;s presentation of thermodynamics does not start with a restriction to thermodynamic equilibrium because he intends to allow for non-equilibrium thermodynamics. He considers an arbitrary system with time invariant properties. He tests it for thermodynamic equilibrium by cutting it off from all external influences, except external force fields. If after insulation, nothing changes, he says that the system was in &quot;equilibrium&quot;.

In a section headed &quot;Thermodynamic equilibrium&quot;, H.B. Callen defines equilibrium states in a paragraph. He points out that they &quot;are determined by intrinsic factors&quot; within the system. They are &quot;terminal states&quot;, towards which the systems evolve, over time, which may occur with &quot;glacial slowness&quot;. This statement does not explicitly say that for thermodynamic equilibrium, the system must be isolated; Callen does not spell out what he means by the words &quot;intrinsic factors&quot;.

Another textbook writer, C.J. Adkins, explicitly allows thermodynamic equilibrium to occur in a system which is not isolated. His system is, however, closed with respect to transfer of matter. He writes: &quot;In general, the approach to thermodynamic equilibrium will involve both thermal and work-like interactions with the surroundings.&quot; He distinguishes such thermodynamic equilibrium from thermal equilibrium, in which only thermal contact is mediating transfer of energy.

Another textbook author, J.R. Partington, writes: &quot;(i) &quot;An equilibrium state is one which is independent of time&quot;.&quot; But, referring to systems &quot;which are only apparently in equilibrium&quot;, he adds : &quot;Such systems are in states of ″false equilibrium.″&quot; Partington&#x27;s statement does not explicitly state that the equilibrium refers to an isolated system. Like Münster, Partington also refers to the mixture of oxygen and hydrogen. He adds a proviso that &quot;In a true equilibrium state, the smallest change of any external condition which influences the state will produce a small change of state ...&quot; This proviso means that thermodynamic equilibrium must be stable against small perturbations; this requirement is essential for the strict meaning of thermodynamic equilibrium.

A student textbook by F.H. Crawford has a section headed &quot;Thermodynamic Equilibrium&quot;. It distinguishes several drivers of flows, and then says: &quot;These are examples of the apparently universal tendency of isolated systems toward a state of complete mechanical, thermal, chemical, and electrical—or, in a single word, &quot;thermodynamic—equilibrium.&quot;&quot;

A monograph on classical thermodynamics by H.A. Buchdahl considers the &quot;equilibrium of a thermodynamic system&quot;, without actually writing the phrase &quot;thermodynamic equilibrium&quot;. Referring to systems closed to exchange of matter, Buchdahl writes: &quot;If a system is in a terminal condition which is properly static, it will be said to be in &quot;equilibrium&quot;.&quot; Buchdahl&#x27;s monograph also discusses amorphous glass, for the purposes of thermodynamic description. It states: &quot;More precisely, the glass may be regarded as being &quot;in equilibrium&quot; so long as experimental tests show that &#x27;slow&#x27; transitions are in effect reversible.&quot; It is not customary to make this proviso part of the definition of thermodynamic equilibrium, but the converse is usually assumed: that if a body in thermodynamic equilibrium is subject to a sufficiently slow process, that process may be considered to be sufficiently nearly reversible, and the body remains sufficiently nearly in thermodynamic equilibrium during the process.

A. Münster carefully extends his definition of thermodynamic equilibrium for isolated systems by introducing a concept of &quot;contact equilibrium&quot;. This specifies particular processes that are allowed when considering thermodynamic equilibrium for non-isolated systems, with special concern for open systems, which may gain or lose matter from or to their surroundings. A contact equilibrium is between the system of interest and a system in the surroundings, brought into contact with the system of interest, the contact being through a special kind of wall; for the rest, the whole joint system is isolated. Walls of this special kind were also considered by C. Carathéodory, and are mentioned by other writers also. They are selectively permeable. They may be permeable only to mechanical work, or only to heat, or only to some particular chemical substance. Each contact equilibrium defines an intensive parameter; for example, a wall permeable only to heat defines an empirical temperature. A contact equilibrium can exist for each chemical constituent of the system of interest. In a contact equilibrium, despite the possible exchange through the selectively permeable wall, the system of interest is changeless, as if it were in isolated thermodynamic equilibrium. This scheme follows the general rule that &quot;... we can consider an equilibrium only with respect to specified processes and defined experimental conditions.&quot; Thermodynamic equilibrium for an open system means that, with respect to every relevant kind of selectively permeable wall, contact equilibrium exists when the respective intensive parameters of the system and surroundings are equal. This definition does not consider the most general kind of thermodynamic equilibrium, which is through unselective contacts. This definition does not simply state that no current of matter or energy exists in the interior or at the boundaries; but it is compatible with the following definition, which does so state.

M. Zemansky also distinguishes mechanical, chemical, and thermal equilibrium. He then writes: &quot;When the conditions for all three types of equilibrium are satisfied, the system is said to be in a state of thermodynamic equilibrium&quot;.

P.M. Morse writes that thermodynamics is concerned with &quot;states of thermodynamic equilibrium&quot;. He also uses the phrase &quot;thermal equilibrium&quot; while discussing transfer of energy as heat between a body and a heat reservoir in its surroundings, though not explicitly defining a special term &#x27;thermal equilibrium&#x27;.

J.R. Waldram writes of &quot;a definite thermodynamic state&quot;. He defines the term &quot;thermal equilibrium&quot; for a system &quot;when its observables have ceased to change over time&quot;. But shortly below that definition he writes of a piece of glass that has not yet reached its &quot;&quot;full&quot; thermodynamic equilibrium state&quot;.

Considering equilibrium states, M. Bailyn writes: &quot;Each intensive variable has its own type of equilibrium.&quot; He then defines thermal equilibrium, mechanical equilibrium, and material equilibrium. Accordingly, he writes: &quot;If all the intensive variables become uniform, &quot;thermodynamic equilibrium&quot; is said to exist.&quot; He is not here considering the presence of an external force field.

J.G. Kirkwood and I. Oppenheim define thermodynamic equilibrium as follows: &quot;A system is in a state of &quot;thermodynamic equilibrium&quot; if, during the time period allotted for experimentation, (a) its intensive properties are independent of time and (b) no current of matter or energy exists in its interior or at its boundaries with the surroundings.&quot; It is evident that they are not restricting the definition to isolated or to closed systems. They do not discuss the possibility of changes that occur with &quot;glacial slowness&quot;, and proceed beyond the time period allotted for experimentation. They note that for two systems in contact, there exists a small subclass of intensive properties such that if all those of that small subclass are respectively equal, then all respective intensive properties are equal. States of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by this subclass, provided some other conditions are satisfied.

==Characteristics of a state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium==

===Homogeneity in the absence of external forces===
A thermodynamic system consisting of a single phase in the absence of external forces, in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium, is homogeneous. This means that the material in any small volume element of the system can be interchanged with the material of any other geometrically congruent volume element of the system, and the effect is to leave the system thermodynamically unchanged. In general, a strong external force field makes a system of a single phase in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium inhomogeneous with respect to some intensive variables. For example, a relatively dense component of a mixture can be concentrated by centrifugation.

===Uniform temperature===
Such equilibrium inhomogeneity, induced by external forces, does not occur for the intensive variable temperature. According to E.A. Guggenheim, &quot;The most important conception of thermodynamics is temperature.&quot; Planck introduces his treatise with a brief account of heat and temperature and thermal equilibrium, and then announces: &quot;In the following we shall deal chiefly with homogeneous, isotropic bodies of any form, possessing throughout their substance the same temperature and density, and subject to a uniform pressure acting everywhere perpendicular to the surface.&quot; As did Carathéodory, Planck was setting aside surface effects and external fields and anisotropic crystals. Though referring to temperature, Planck did not there explicitly refer to the concept of thermodynamic equilibrium. In contrast, Carathéodory&#x27;s scheme of presentation of classical thermodynamics for closed systems postulates the concept of an &quot;equilibrium state&quot; following Gibbs (Gibbs speaks routinely of a &quot;thermodynamic state&quot;), though not explicitly using the phrase &#x27;thermodynamic equilibrium&#x27;, nor explicitly postulating the existence of a temperature to define it.

Although thermodynamic laws are immutable, systems can be created that delay the time to reach thermodynamic equilibrium. In a thought experiment, Reed A. Howald conceived of a system called &quot;The Fizz Keeper&quot;consisting of a cap with a nozzle that can re-pressurize any standard bottle of carbonated beverage. Nitrogen and oxygen, which air are mostly made out of, would keep getting pumped in, which would slow down the rate at which the carbon dioxide fizzles out of the system. This is possible because the thermodynamic equilibrium between the unconverted and converted carbon dioxide inside the bottle would stay the same. To come to this conclusion, he also appeals to Henry&#x27;s Law, which states that gases dissolve in direct proportion to their partial pressures. By influencing the partial pressure on the top of a closed system, this would help slow down the rate of fizzing out of carbonated beverages which is governed by thermodynamic equilibrium. The equilibria of carbon dioxide and other gases would not change, however the partial pressure on top would slow down the rate of dissolution extending the time a gas stays in a particular state. due to the nature of thermal equilibrium of the remainder of the beverage. The equilibrium constant of carbon dioxide would be completely independent of the nitrogen and oxygen pumped into the system, which would slow down the diffusion of gas, and yet not have an impact on the thermodynamics of the entire system. 

The temperature within a system in thermodynamic equilibrium is uniform in space as well as in time. In a system in its own state of internal thermodynamic equilibrium, there are no net internal macroscopic flows. In particular, this means that all local parts of the system are in mutual radiative exchange equilibrium. This means that the temperature of the system is spatially uniform. This is so in all cases, including those of non-uniform external force fields. For an externally imposed gravitational field, this may be proved in macroscopic thermodynamic terms, by the calculus of variations, using the method of Langrangian multipliers. Considerations of kinetic theory or statistical mechanics also support this statement.

In order that a system may be in its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium, it is of course necessary, but not sufficient, that it be in its own internal state of thermal equilibrium; it is possible for a system to reach internal mechanical equilibrium before it reaches internal thermal equilibrium.

===Number of real variables needed for specification===

In his exposition of his scheme of closed system equilibrium thermodynamics, C. Carathéodory initially postulates that experiment reveals that a definite number of real variables define the states that are the points of the manifold of equilibria. In the words of Prigogine and Defay (1945): &quot;It is a matter of experience that when we have specified a certain number of macroscopic properties of a system, then all the other properties are fixed.&quot; As noted above, according to A. Münster, the number of variables needed to define a thermodynamic equilibrium is the least for any state of a given isolated system. As noted above, J.G. Kirkwood and I. Oppenheim point out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium may be defined by a special subclass of intensive variables, with a definite number of members in that subclass.

If the thermodynamic equilibrium lies in an external force field, it is only the temperature that can in general be expected to be spatially uniform. Intensive variables other than temperature will in general be non-uniform if the external force field is non-zero. In such a case, in general, additional variables are needed to describe the spatial non-uniformity.

===Stability against small perturbations===
As noted above, J.R. Partington points out that a state of thermodynamic equilibrium is stable against small transient perturbations. Without this condition, in general, experiments intended to study systems in thermodynamic equilibrium are in severe difficulties.

===Approach to thermodynamic equilibrium within an isolated system===

When a body of material starts from a non-equilibrium state of inhomogeneity or chemical non-equilibrium, and is then isolated, it spontaneously evolves towards its own internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium. It is not necessary that all aspects of internal thermodynamic equilibrium be reached simultaneously; some can be established before others. For example, in many cases of such evolution, internal mechanical equilibrium is established much more rapidly than the other aspects of the eventual thermodynamic equilibrium. Another example is that, in many cases of such evolution, thermal equilibrium is reached much more rapidly than chemical equilibrium.

===Fluctuations within an isolated system in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium===

In an isolated system, thermodynamic equilibrium by definition persists over an indefinitely long time. In classical physics it is often convenient to ignore the effects of measurement and this is assumed in the present account.

To consider the notion of fluctuations in an isolated thermodynamic system, a convenient example is a system specified by its extensive state variables, internal energy, volume, and mass composition. By definition they are time-invariant. By definition, they combine with time-invariant nominal values of their conjugate intensive functions of state, inverse temperature, pressure divided by temperature, and the chemical potentials divided by temperature, so as to exactly obey the laws of thermodynamics. But the laws of thermodynamics, combined with the values of the specifying extensive variables of state, are not sufficient to provide knowledge of those nominal values. Further information is needed, namely, of the constitutive properties of the system.

It may be admitted that on repeated measurement of those conjugate intensive functions of state, they are found to have slightly different values from time to time. Such variability is regarded as due to internal fluctuations. The different measured values average to their nominal values.

If the system is truly macroscopic as postulated by classical thermodynamics, then the fluctuations are too small to detect macroscopically. This is called the thermodynamic limit. In effect, the molecular nature of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer have vanished from sight, too small to see. According to Buchdahl: &quot;... there is no place within the strictly phenomenological theory for the idea of fluctuations about equilibrium (see, however, Section 76).&quot;

If the system is repeatedly subdivided, eventually a system is produced that is small enough to exhibit obvious fluctuations. This is a mesoscopic level of investigation. The fluctuations are then directly dependent on the natures of the various walls of the system. The precise choice of independent state variables is then important. At this stage, statistical features of the laws of thermodynamics become apparent.

If the mesoscopic system is further repeatedly divided, eventually a microscopic system is produced. Then the molecular character of matter and the quantal nature of momentum transfer become important in the processes of fluctuation. One has left the realm of classical or macroscopic thermodynamics, and one needs quantum statistical mechanics. The fluctuations can become relatively dominant, and questions of measurement become important.

The statement that &#x27;the system is its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium&#x27; may be taken to mean that &#x27;indefinitely many such measurements have been taken from time to time, with no trend in time in the various measured values&#x27;. Thus the statement, that &#x27;a system is in its own internal thermodynamic equilibrium, with stated nominal values of its functions of state conjugate to its specifying state variables&#x27;, is far far more informative than a statement that &#x27;a set of single simultaneous measurements of those functions of state have those same values&#x27;. This is because the single measurements might have been made during a slight fluctuation, away from another set of nominal values of those conjugate intensive functions of state, that is due to unknown and different constitutive properties. A single measurement cannot tell whether that might be so, unless there is also knowledge of the nominal values that belong to the equilibrium state.

=== Thermal equilibrium ===
An explicit distinction between &#x27;thermal equilibrium&#x27; and &#x27;thermodynamic equilibrium&#x27; is made by B. C. Eu. He considers two systems in thermal contact, one a thermometer, the other a system in which there are several occurring irreversible processes, entailing non-zero fluxes; the two systems are separated by a wall permeable only to heat. He considers the case in which, over the time scale of interest, it happens that both the thermometer reading and the irreversible processes are steady. Then there is thermal equilibrium without thermodynamic equilibrium. Eu proposes consequently that the zeroth law of thermodynamics can be considered to apply even when thermodynamic equilibrium is not present; also he proposes that if changes are occurring so fast that a steady temperature cannot be defined, then &quot;it is no longer possible to describe the process by means of a thermodynamic formalism. In other words, thermodynamics has no meaning for such a process.&quot; This illustrates the importance for thermodynamics of the concept of temperature.

Thermal equilibrium is achieved when two systems in thermal contact with each other cease to have a net exchange of energy. It follows that if two systems are in thermal equilibrium, then their temperatures are the same.

Thermal equilibrium occurs when a system&#x27;s macroscopic thermal observables have ceased to change with time. For example, an ideal gas whose distribution function has stabilised to a specific Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution would be in thermal equilibrium. This outcome allows a single temperature and pressure to be attributed to the whole system. For an isolated body, it is quite possible for mechanical equilibrium to be reached before thermal equilibrium is reached, but eventually, all aspects of equilibrium, including thermal equilibrium, are necessary for thermodynamic equilibrium.

==Non-equilibrium==
A system&#x27;s internal state of thermodynamic equilibrium should be distinguished from a &quot;stationary state&quot; in which thermodynamic parameters are unchanging in time but the system is not isolated, so that there are, into and out of the system, non-zero macroscopic fluxes which are constant in time.

Non-equilibrium thermodynamics is a branch of thermodynamics that deals with systems that are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. Most systems found in nature are not in thermodynamic equilibrium because they are changing or can be triggered to change over time, and are continuously and discontinuously subject to flux of matter and energy to and from other systems. The thermodynamic study of non-equilibrium systems requires more general concepts than are dealt with by equilibrium thermodynamics. Many natural systems still today remain beyond the scope of currently known macroscopic thermodynamic methods.

Laws governing systems which are far from equilibrium are also debatable. One of the guiding principles for these systems is the maximum entropy production principle. It states that a non-equilibrium system evolves such as to maximize its entropy production.

<text>Lascăr Catargiu ( or Lascăr Catargi; 1 November 1823 – ) was a Romanian conservative statesman born in Moldavia. He belonged to an ancient Wallachian family, one of whose members had been banished in the 17th century by Prince Matei Basarab, and had settled in Moldavia.

==Biography==
He was born in Iași, the son of Constantin Catargiu, the scion of an old boyar family.
From 1843 to 1844, he served as deputy &quot;ispravnic&quot; in Huși and then as &quot;pârcălab&quot; in Neamț County. Lascăr Catargiu rose to the office of prefect of police in Iași under the rule of the Moldavian Prince Grigore Ghica (1849–1856). In 1857 he became a member of the &quot;ad hoc Divan&quot; of Moldavia, a commission elected in accordance with the Treaty of Paris (1856) to vote on the proposed union of Moldavia and Wallachia (the Danubian Principalities). His strongly conservative views, especially on land reform, induced the Conservatives to support him as a candidate for the Romanian throne in 1859.

During the reign of &quot;Domnitor&quot; Alexandru Ioan Cuza (1859–1866), Catargiu was one of the Opposition leaders, and received much assistance from his kinsman, Barbu Catargiu (b. 1807), a noted journalist and politician, who was assassinated in Bucharest on 20 June 1862. Lascăr Catargiu consequently took part in the so-called &quot;monstrous coalition&quot; that toppled Cuza, and, on the accession of &quot;Domnitor&quot; Carol I in May 1866, became President of the Council of Ministers but, finding himself unable to cooperate with his Liberal colleagues, Ion Brătianu and C. A. Rosetti, he resigned in July.

After eight more ministerial changes, culminating in the anti-dynastic agitation of 1870–1871 (provoked by the Liberals in the context of the Franco-Prussian War; &quot;see also Republic of Ploiești&quot;), Catargiu formed, for the first time in Romanian history, a stable Conservative cabinet, which lasted until 1876. His policy, which averted political violence and revived the popularity of the crown, was regarded as unpatriotic and reactionary by the Liberals, who resumed office in 1876; and a proposal to impeach the whole Catargiu cabinet was only withdrawn in 1878.
Catargiu remained in opposition until 1889, when he formed another cabinet, taking the portfolio of the Interior; but this administration fell after seven months. In the Ion Emanuel Florescu cabinet of March 1891 he occupied the same position, and in December he again became president of the Council, retaining office until 1895. During this period he was responsible for several important reforms, chiefly financial and commercial. He died in Bucharest and was buried in the city&#x27;s Bellu Cemetery.

The Lascăr Catargiu Boulevard—one of the main roads in central Bucharest—connects Piața Romană to Piața Victoriei. In the middle of the boulevard lies a statue of Catargiu, built by sculptor Antonin Mercié in 1907.

<text>Nathaniel Macon (December 17, 1757June 29, 1837) was an American politician who represented North Carolina in both houses of Congress. He was the fifth speaker of the House, serving from 1801 to 1807. He was a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1791 to 1815 and a member of the United States Senate from 1815 to 1828. He opposed ratification of the United States Constitution and the Federalist economic policies of Alexander Hamilton. From 1826 to 1827, he served as President pro tempore of the United States Senate. Thomas Jefferson dubbed him &quot;Ultimus Romanorum&quot;—&quot;the last of the Romans&quot;.

During his political career he was spokesman for the Old Republican faction of the Democratic-Republican Party that wanted to strictly limit the United States federal government. Along with fellow Old Republicans John Randolph and John Taylor, Macon frequently opposed various domestic policy proposals, and generally opposed the internal improvements promoted by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun.

An earnest defender of slavery, Macon voted against the Missouri Compromise in 1820. In the 1824 presidential election, he received several electoral votes for vice president, despite declining to run, as the stand-in running-mate for William Harris Crawford. He also served as president of the 1835 North Carolina constitutional convention.

After leaving public office, he served as a trustee for the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and protested President Andrew Jackson&#x27;s threat to use force during the Nullification Crisis.

==Early life==
Nathaniel Macon was born near Warrenton, North Carolina, the son of Maj. Gideon Macon, a Virginia native, and North Carolina-born Priscilla Jones, and through his great-grandfather, Col. Gideon Macon, an English citizen of allegedly French Huguenot background, Nathaniel was second cousin of First Lady Martha Dandridge Washington.

Maj. Gideon Macon had built &quot;Macon Manor&quot; and became a prosperous tobacco planter, where Nathaniel was born as the sixth child of Gideon and Priscilla, and he was only two when his father died in 1761. Upon his death, Gideon possessed of land and 25–30 slaves. Nathaniel was bequeathed two parcels of land and all of his father&#x27;s blacksmithing tools. Gideon also left his son three slaves: George, Robb, and Lucy.

===Education===
In 1766, Priscilla (Jones) Macon, now the wife of James Ransom, arranged for the education of two of her sons, Nathaniel and John, along with the two sons of her neighbor Philemon Hawkins II. For this purpose, they engaged Mr. Charles Pettigrew, who later became the principal of the Academy of Edenton in 1733. The two brothers and their neighbors, Joseph and Benjamin Hawkins, later a senator and U. S. Indian agent, were instructed by him from 1766 to 1773.

Three of the four boys (Nathaniel and Benjamin among them) continued on to further their education at the &quot;College of New Jersey&quot; at Princeton as part of the class of 1777. Neither Nathaniel or Benjamin would graduate.

===American Revolution===
Macon performed a short term of military duty during the American Revolution. He returned to North Carolina in the fall of 1776, and studied law for three years. He rejoined the Revolution as a private in 1780, and was likely present at the Battle of Camden.

==Marriage and family==
Macon met Hannah Plummer in 1782 in Warrenton, North Carolina. Her parents William Plummer and Mary Hayes were Virginians like Macon&#x27;s, and they were &quot;well connected&quot;. Macon was a tall man, over , and considered attractive, but he was not the only man who was pursuing Miss Plummer. However, after a number of months of courtship, Hannah and Nathaniel decided to marry.

One story often told of her courtship involves Macon challenging an unnamed potential suitor to a card game, with Hannah Plummer as the prize. The offer was accepted, and Macon lost the card game. Upon losing, he turned to Hannah and exclaimed &quot;notwithstanding I have lost you fairly—love is superior to honesty—I cannot give you up.&quot; This won her favor, and they were married soon afterwards. Their wedding took place on October 9, 1783, and their marriage was an affectionate one.

===In laws===
Her brother was the lawyer Kemp Plummer, the grandfather of Kemp Plummer Battle. Kemp Plummer and Nathaniel Macon were both part of the &quot;Warren Junto&quot; which also included James Turner, Weldon Edwards, William Hawkins, and William Miller, all of whom dominated North Carolina political life at that time. Kemp Plummer was the second owner of the oldest house in Warrenton. The original owner was Marmaduke Johnson, who married Macon&#x27;s half-sister Hixie Ransom. Another Plummer brother was William Plummer II, who married Macon&#x27;s half-sister Betsy Ransom.

===Children, death, and burial===

According to Bible records, the Macons had three children:

* Betsy Kemp Macon (September 12, 1784 – November 10, 1829) married William John Martin (March 6, 1781 – December 11, 1828)
* Plummer Macon (April 14, 1786 – July 26, 1792)
* Seignora Macon (November 15, 1787 – August 16, 1825) married William Eaton

Macon&#x27;s wife, Hannah, died on July 11, 1790, when she was just 29 years old. Although Nathaniel was only 32 at the time of her death, he never remarried. It is said that he was devoted to his wife, and his long unmarried life following her early death would suggest that he was faithful to her memory.

Her remains were buried not far from their home on the borders of their yard. Their only son died just over a year after Hannah and was buried beside her. When Nathaniel died July 29, 1837, at age 79, he was laid to rest next to his wife and son. As he requested, the site of their graves was covered with a great heap of flint stones so that the land would be left uncultivated; Macon believed that no one would go to the trouble of removing all of the flint in order to use the land, thereby preserving the burial site.

=== Buck Spring Plantation ===
Macon and his wife made their home on Hubquarter Creek on their plantation known as &quot;Buck Spring Plantation&quot;. Macon&#x27;s father Gideon&#x27;s will bequeathed to him lands on Shocco Creek and &quot;Five hundred acres of Land lying and being on both sides of Hubquarter Creek&quot;. It was about north of Warrenton, near Roanoke Rapids. His plantation grew to 1,945 acres, served by 70 slaves, with whom he often worked together in the fields, as well as serving as justice of the peace and a trustee of the Warrenton Academy. He raised thoroughbred race horses and had a pack of fox hounds, in 1819 hosting President Monroe for a hunt.

== Political life ==
He served in the North Carolina Senate for Warren County in 1781, 1782, and 1784.

Macon opposed the Constitution and spent his four decades in Congress making sure the national government would remain weak. He was for 37 years the most prominent nay-sayer in Congress—a &quot;negative radical&quot;. It was said of him that during the entire term of his service no other members cast so many negative votes. &quot;Negation was his word and arm.&quot;

He was rural and local-minded, and economy was the passion of his public career. &quot;His economy of the public money was the severest, sharpest, most stringent and constant refusal of almost any grant that could be proposed.&quot; With him, &quot;not only was ... parsimony the best subsidy—but ... the only one&quot;.

He supported all of the foreign policies of Jefferson and Madison from 1801 to 1817. Macon detested Alexander Hamilton and the Federalist program.

=== 1791 to 1799 ===
He was especially hostile to a navy, fearing the expense would create a financial interest. He bitterly opposed the Jay Treaty in 1795, the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798, and the movement for war with France in 1798–99. Macon supported the Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions.

=== 1800 to 1809 ===
Macon served as Speaker of the House from 1801 to 1807. He was the fifth person, and first Southerner to serve in the office. He supported the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, and tried to get Jefferson to purchase Florida as well. Jefferson offered the post of postmaster general to Macon at least twice, but he declined.
During his second term as speaker, Macon broke with Jefferson, believing that the president had strayed from the fundamental principles of Republicanismstrict constitutional construction and state sovereignty, and began collaborating more with John Randolph and John Taylor as part of the splinter &quot;Quids&quot; faction of the Democratic-Republican Party. Even so, he still narrowly won a third term.

He did not seek a fourth term as speaker when the 10th Congress convened in 1807. Instead he chaired the Foreign Relations Committee.

=== 1810 to 1819 ===
Macon Bill No. 1 attacked British shipping, but was defeated. In May 1810, Macon&#x27;s Bill No. 2 was passed, giving the president power to suspend trade with either Great Britain or France if the other should cease to interfere with United States commerce. 
Macon neither wrote nor approved of Bill No. 2. Macon supported Madison in declaring the War of 1812; he opposed conscription to build the army and opposed higher taxes.

He did favor some road construction by the federal government, but generally opposed the policy of internal improvements promoted by Henry Clay and John C. Calhoun. He opposed the recharter of the United States Bank in 1811 and in 1816, uniformly voted against any form of protective tariff.

=== 1820 to 1828 ===
He was always an earnest defender of slavery. In the Missouri debate of 1820 he voted against the compromise brokered by Clay. Macon was also considered a potential candidate for the presidency in 1824 but declined. Macon won 24 electoral votes for vice president as the stand-in running-mate for William Harris Crawford. Macon was asked to run for the vice presidency again in 1828 but declined.

=== After retirement ===
Among his other public acts in retirement were writing a letter in 1832 to President Jackson protesting the threatened use of military action to quell the South Carolina nullifiers. He wrote to Samuel P. Carson that he believed in the right of secession: &quot;A government of opinion established by sovereign States for special purposes can not be maintained by force.&quot;

He served as President of the 1835 convention to amend and reform the Constitution of North Carolina. The resulting amendments to the state constitution mostly related to political reform and greater democracy. He was largely opposed to the amendments that were adopted. He also served as a trustee of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and supported Martin Van Buren in the election of 1836.

<text>Josef Čapek (; 23 March 1887 – April 1945) was a Czech artist who was best known as a painter, but who was also noted as a writer and a poet. He invented the word &quot;robot&quot;, which was introduced into literature by his brother, Karel Čapek.

==Life==
Čapek was born in Hronov, Bohemia (Austria-Hungary, later Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic) in 1887. First a painter of the Cubist school, he later developed his own playful, minimalist style. He collaborated with his brother Karel on a number of plays and short stories; on his own, he wrote the utopian play &quot;Land of Many Names&quot; and several novels, as well as critical essays in which he argued for the art of the unconscious, of children, and of &#x27;savages&#x27;. He was named by his brother as the true inventor of the term &quot;robot&quot;. As a cartoonist, he worked for &quot;Lidové noviny,&quot; a newspaper based in Prague.

His illustrated stories &quot;Povídání o Pejskovi a Kočičce&quot; (English translation as &quot;The Adventures of Puss and Pup&quot;) are considered classics of Czech children&#x27;s literature.

==Death==
Due to his critical attitude towards national socialism and Adolf Hitler, he was arrested after the German invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1939. He wrote &quot;Poems from a Concentration Camp&quot; in the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, where he died in 1945. In June 1945 Rudolf Margolius, accompanied by Čapek&#x27;s wife Jarmila Čapková, went to Bergen-Belsen to search for him. His remains were never found. In 1948 the court officially set the date of his death as 30 April 1947.

<text>Carl Bert Albert (May 10, 1908 – February 4, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the 46th speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977 and represented Oklahoma&#x27;s 3rd congressional district as a Democrat from 1947 to 1977.

At tall, Albert was affectionately known as the &quot;Little Giant from Little Dixie&quot;. Albert held the highest political office of any Oklahoman in American history.

==Early years, education==
Albert was born in McAlester, Oklahoma, the son of Leona Ann (Scott) and Ernest Homer Albert, a coal miner and farmer. Shortly after his birth his family moved to Bugtussle, a small town just north of McAlester. He grew up in a log cabin on his father&#x27;s farm. In high school he excelled in debate, was student body president, and won the national high school oratorical contest, earning a trip to Europe. During this time he was an active member of his local Order of DeMolay chapter; he is an inductee of the Order of DeMolay Hall of Fame. Albert later petitioned his local Masonic Lodge and became an active Freemason. He entered the University of Oklahoma in 1927. There, he majored in political science and won the National Oratorical Championship in 1928, receiving an all-expense-paid trip to Europe. He earned enough money to fund the rest of his undergraduate education through working in the college registrar&#x27;s office and participating in the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps. While at Oklahoma, he was an accomplished amateur wrestler, a member of the Kappa Alpha Order fraternity, and a member of the RUF/NEKS. He graduated Phi Beta Kappa in 1931, was the top male student, then studied at the University of Oxford on a Rhodes Scholarship. He received a Bachelor of Arts in jurisprudence and Bachelor of Civil Laws from St Peter&#x27;s College before returning to the United States in 1934. He opened a law practice in Oklahoma City in 1935. He worked for a series of oil companies in leasing work until the start of World War II.

==War years==
Albert joined the United States Army as a private in 1941. He served briefly with the 3rd Armored Division, but was soon commissioned a second lieutenant in the Army Air Forces. While in the army, Albert married Mary Harmon on August 20, 1942, in Columbia, South Carolina, just before he was sent to the South Pacific. The couple had two children, Mary Frances and David. Albert served in the Judge Advocate General Corps as a prosecutor assigned to the Far East Air Service Command. He earned a Bronze Star Medal and other decorations and left the Army with the rank of lieutenant colonel in 1946. He remained in the Army Reserve after the war, and retired in 1968 with the rank of colonel.

==Entrance into Congress==
Albert was elected to Congress for the first time in 1946. He was a Cold War liberal, and supported President Harry S. Truman&#x27;s containment of Soviet expansionism and domestic measures like public housing, federal aid to education, and farm price supports. Speaker of the House Sam Rayburn noticed his diligence as a legislator and began inviting him to informal meetings in the speaker&#x27;s office. Rayburn also advised Albert to seek the chairmanship of the Agriculture Committee in 1949. Albert was appointed House Majority Whip in 1955 and elected House Majority Leader after Rayburn&#x27;s death in 1961.

Albert seemed to describe himself as a political moderate. He said, he &quot;very much disliked doctrinaire liberals –– they want to own your minds. And I don&#x27;t like reactionary conservatives. I like to face issues in terms of conditions and not in terms of someone&#x27;s inborn political philosophy.&quot;

Albert was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1957.

==Congressional majority leader==

As Majority Leader, Albert was a key figure in advancing the Democratic legislative agenda in the House, particularly health care legislation. Medicare, the federal hospital insurance program for persons 65 and older, was initially proposed by the Kennedy Administration as an amendment to the Social Security program. Albert knew the bill had insufficient Congressional support for passage due to the opposition of ten Republicans and eight southern Democrats. He advised President Kennedy to seek Senate passage of the measure first. Albert calculated that the Senate should bring it to the House as a conference committee report on their own welfare bill, instead of trying direct introduction into the House.

Although well-planned, Albert&#x27;s efforts on behalf of the Medicare bill were not successful at that time. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, Albert worked to change House rules so that the majority Democrats would have greater influence on the final decisions of Congress under President Lyndon B. Johnson. The changes included more majority leverage over the House Rules Committee and stronger majority membership influence in the House Ways and Means Committee. With these changes in place, Albert was able to push through the Medicare bill, known as the Social Security Act of 1965, and to shepherd other pieces of Johnson&#x27;s Great Society program through Congress. Albert did not sign the 1956 Southern Manifesto, and voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Albert voted against the initial House resolution for the Civil Rights Act of 1957 on June 18, 1957, but voted in favor of the Senate amendment to the bill on August 27, 1957.

Albert also chaired the infamous 1968 Democratic National Convention in Chicago. The convention was one of the most chaotic in American history. Riots and protests raged outside the venue, and disorder reigned among delegates tasked with leading the party after Johnson&#x27;s late March decision to not seek reelection, the April assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the June assassination of Robert F. Kennedy and the increasing casualties of the Vietnam War.

==Speaker of U.S. House of Representatives==
When Speaker John W. McCormack retired in January 1971, during the second half of Richard Nixon&#x27;s first term as president, Albert was elected Speaker of the House of Representatives.

In September 1972, Albert was witnessed driving drunk and crashing into two cars in the Cleveland Park neighborhood of Washington.

As the Watergate scandal developed in 1973, Albert, as speaker, referred some two dozen impeachment resolutions to the House Judiciary Committee for debate and study. Also in 1973, he appointed Felda Looper as the first female House page.

In 1973, during Albert&#x27;s second term as Speaker and Nixon&#x27;s second term as president, Vice President Spiro Agnew was investigated for tax evasion and money laundering for a series of bribes he took while he was governor of Maryland. Agnew resigned as vice president and eventually pleaded &quot;nolo contendere&quot; to the charges. This event put Albert next in line to assume the presidency, should that office have become vacant.
Under the provisions of the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Nixon nominated Republican House Minority Leader Gerald R. Ford to succeed Agnew as vice president in October 1973. As the Watergate scandal began to unfold and the impeachment process against Nixon began, it quickly became apparent that if Nixon resigned or was removed from office before Ford was confirmed by both houses, Albert would become acting president under the Presidential Succession Act of 1947. Albert would have been forced to resign from the office of Speaker as well as the House.

This was the first occasion since the Twenty-fifth Amendment&#x27;s ratification when it was possible for a member of one party to assume the presidency after a member of the opposing party vacated the office. As speaker of the House, Albert presided over the only body with the authority to impeach Nixon and had the ability to prevent any vice presidential confirmation vote from taking place in the House. This meant Albert could have maneuvered to make himself acting president. Ted Sorensen prepared a contingency plan for Albert that outlined the steps Albert would have taken had he assumed the presidency. The vice presidency was vacant for about seven weeks; Ford was confirmed and sworn in December 1973.

Nixon resigned on August 9, 1974, and the office of vice president was once more left vacant when Ford succeeded Nixon that day. This event put Albert next in line to assume the presidency for a second time. Former New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller was nominated by Ford, then confirmed and sworn into office as vice president in December.

A different issue arose during Albert&#x27;s last term in office when he was confronted with the Tongsun Park scandal. He was accused of accepting gifts and bribes from a lobbyist who was also a member of South Korean intelligence. Albert denied having accepted bribes and admitted receiving only token gifts, which he disclosed. He decided to retire at the end of the 94th Congress in January 1977, and after leaving the House he turned the gifts over to the General Services Administration as required by law. Albert was never charged with a crime.

==Retirement==
After he left Washington, Albert returned to Bugtussle, turning down many lucrative financial offers from corporate concerns. With help from university professor Danney Goble, Albert published his memoir, &quot;Little Giant&quot; (University of Oklahoma Press, 1990, ).
A post-retirement editorial in the &quot;New York Times&quot; called him &quot;a conciliator and seeker of consensus, a patient persuader . . . trusted for his fairness and integrity.&quot; He lectured at the University of Oklahoma and made speeches both in the United States and abroad.

==Death and legacy==
Albert died in McAlester, Oklahoma at the age of 91 on February 4, 2000. He is buried in Oak Hill Cemetery in McAlester.

The Carl Albert Center at the University of Oklahoma in Norman was established in 1979 for the general purpose of studying Congress and the particular purpose of researching Albert&#x27;s life and political career. The Center holds the archive of Albert&#x27;s Congressional papers along with those of Robert S. Kerr, Helen Gahagan Douglas, Millicent Fenwick, Ernest Istook, Fred R. Harris, Percy Gassaway, and many others. The Congressional Archives hold material from the Civil War era to the present, but the largest portion covers the 1930s to the 1970s.
Carl Albert Indian Health Facility in Ada is part of the Public Health Service and is administered by the Chickasaw Nation of Oklahoma. Durant named its Carl Albert Park for him, and a monument to Albert resides at his birthplace in McAlester.
Several institutions and buildings in Oklahoma bear Albert&#x27;s name. Carl B. Albert Middle School and Carl B. Albert High School in Midwest City and Carl Albert State College in Poteau are named for him, as well as the Carl Albert Federal Building in McAlester.

The University of Oxford established a monument to Albert in the Eunomia Chambers of the St Peter&#x27;s College Law Library.

==Personal life==
Carl Albert married Mary Harmon in 1942; they had a son and a daughter. His cousin Charles W. Vursell served as a member of Congress representing Illinois from 1943 to 1959.

<text>Francolins are birds in the tribe Gallini that traditionally have been placed in the genus &quot;Francolinus&quot;, but now commonly are divided into multiple genera. 

As previously defined, they were paraphyletic as the genus &quot;Pternistis&quot;, which was previously included in &quot;Francolinus&quot;, is more closely related to Old World quails than it is to the other francolins. Beginning in 2004, various ornithologists have recommended that it would be clearer to use &quot;spurfowl&quot; for all members of the genus &quot;Pternistis&quot; and restrict the use of &quot;francolin&quot; to the other species presently or formerly classified in &quot;Francolinus&quot;. When &quot;Pternistis&quot; is excluded, the francolins form a monophyletic clade that is a sister group to a clade comprising the junglefowl (&quot;Gallus&quot;) and the bamboo partridges (&quot;Bambusicola&quot;); together, these clades compose the tribe Gallini.

Although formerly classified in the partridge subfamily Perdicinae, this classification is no longer supported, and they are now classified in the subfamily Pavoninae. 

Francolins are terrestrial (though not flightless) birds that feed on insects, vegetable matter and seeds. Most of the members have a hooked upper beak, well-suited for digging at the bases of grass tussocks and rootballs. They have wide tails with fourteen rectrix feathers. Most species exhibit spurs on the tarsi.

==Distribution==
Of the approximately 17 extant species, the natural range of five (composing the genus &quot;Francolinus&quot; and &quot;Ortygornis&quot;) are restricted to Asia, while the remaining genera are restricted to Africa. Several species have been introduced to other parts of the world, notably Hawaii.

Twelve of the species which occur in Africa are found in the subcontinental region of southern Africa; of these, seven occur in varying proportions within the political boundaries of Namibia and Zambia. Six southern African francolins are considered endemic to the subcontinent, of which three are found in Namibia and Zambia (the Hartlaub&#x27;s, red-billed and Orange River francolins). 

The Cape spurfowl, endemic to the Cape Province of South Africa, occurs marginally in southern Namibia and southwestern Zambia. A fossil francolin, &quot;Francolinus capeki&quot;, has been described from Late Pliocene deposits of Hungary; the contemporary fossil galliforms &quot;&quot;Francolinus&quot; minor&quot; and &quot;&quot;F.&quot; subfrancolinus&quot; are now placed in &quot;Palaeocryptonyx&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
Until the early 1990s, major authorities placed all francolins in the genus &quot;Francolinus&quot;. In 1992 it was suggested that this treatment was problematic, and the francolins should be split into four genera: &quot;Francolinus&quot; for the Asian species, and the African species divided into &quot;Peliperdix&quot;, &quot;Scleroptila&quot; and &quot;Pternistis&quot;. The crested francolin and Nahan&#x27;s francolin were considered possibly quite distinct, but still maintained in &quot;Peliperdix&quot; and &quot;Pternistis&quot; respectively. Based on further evidence, the crested francolin was moved to the monotypic genus &quot;Dendroperdix&quot; in 1998, and the Nahan&#x27;s francolin was moved to &quot;Ptilopachus&quot; in 2006. Though some still maintain all these in &quot;Francolinus&quot;, the split into multiple genera is becoming more widespread. In 2021, two species in &quot;Francolinus&quot; (the grey and swamp francolins) along with the crested francolin were moved into the genus &quot;Ortygornis&quot;, while three species from &quot;Peliperdix&quot; (the coqui, white-throated, and Schlegel&#x27;s francolins) were moved into the new genus &quot;Campocolinus&quot;. &quot;Pternistis&quot; was moved to the tribe Coturnicini and, as with Nahan&#x27;s &quot;francolin&quot;, is no longer considered a francolin.

When split, the English name &quot;francolin&quot; is generally restricted to the members of the genera &quot;Francolinus&quot;, &quot;Ortygornis&quot;, &quot;Campocolinus&quot;, &quot;Peliperdix&quot; and &quot;Scleroptila&quot;, while the name &quot;spurfowl&quot; is used for &quot;Pternistis&quot; (&quot;spurfowl&quot; is also used for &quot;Galloperdix&quot; of the Indian subcontinent). As the Nahan&#x27;s &quot;francolin&quot; is related to the stone partridge rather than the true francolins and spurfowl, its name is sometimes modified to Nahan&#x27;s partridge.

In addition to the major changes proposed at genus level, the species level taxonomy among several francolins/spurfowl is disputed. For example, the distribution of the Orange River francolin (&quot;Scleroptila levaillantoides&quot;) is highly disjunct, leading some authorities to split the northern taxa (from Kenya and northwards) into a separate species, the acacia/Archer&#x27;s francolin (&quot;S. gutturalis&quot;, with subspecies &quot;lorti&quot;), while maintaining the southern taxa (from Angola and southwards) in the Orange River francolin. Most authorities treat the Elgon francolin (&quot;S&quot;. &quot;psilolaema elgonensis&quot;) as a subspecies of the moorland francolin, but others have suggested it is a species (&quot;S&quot;. &quot;elgonensis&quot;), a subspecies of the Shelley&#x27;s francolin, or even a hybrid between the moorland and red-winged francolins.

** Orange River francolin, &quot;Scleroptila gutturalis&quot;

With a paraphyletic classification, the genus &quot;Pternistis&quot; in the tribe Coturnicini is also considered a francolin; due to the resulting paraphyly, this classification is no longer supported and has been recommended against.

<doc id="265836" wikidata="Q377602" url="?curid=265836" title="John W. McCormack">
<text>John William McCormack (December 21, 1891 – November 22, 1980) was an American politician from Boston, Massachusetts. McCormack served in the United States Army during World War I, and afterwards in the Massachusetts State Senate before winning election to the United States House of Representatives.

McCormack advanced through the leadership ranks to become majority leader before being chosen as the 45th speaker of the House. He served as speaker from 1962 until his 1971 retirement.

McCormack&#x27;s congressional career was highlighted by his support for the New Deal measures undertaken to combat the Great Depression, U.S. involvement in World War II, and support for the Great Society programs of the 1960s, including civil rights, education, and health care for the elderly. A staunch anti-communist, McCormack supported U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War. His support for the war and the seniority system in Congress caused increasing numbers of younger members to challenge his leadership; McCormack survived a 1969 contest with Mo Udall for the Speakership. He did not run for reelection to his House seat in 1970, and retired to his home in Boston. He later resided at a Dedham nursing home, where he died in 1980.

At 42 years and 58 days, as of 2022 McCormack&#x27;s service in the U.S. House ranks 18th in terms of uninterrupted time. He is the longest-serving member of the U.S. House in Massachusetts history.

==Early life==
McCormack was born in Boston on December 21, 1891. He was the son of Joseph H. McCormack, a hod carrier and native of Prince Edward Island, Canada, and his wife Mary Ellen (née O&#x27;Brien) McCormack of Boston (1861–1913). He said he was one of 12 children, several of whom died as children or young adults. In fact, Mary Ellen McCormack carried eight children to term, and six lived long enough to be counted in the census or included in other records. John McCormack&#x27;s older siblings Patrick (d. 1911), Catherine (d. 1906), and James (d. 1906) died at ages 24, 19 and 17, respectively. His brother Edward (&quot;Knocko&quot;) died in Boston in 1963 at age 67. McCormack&#x27;s brother Donald died in Texas in 1966 at the age of 65. McCormack also had a half brother named Harry from his father&#x27;s first marriage; Harry died on Prince Edward Island at age 18 in 1902.

McCormack said for most of his life that his father died when McCormack was 13; other sources indicate that his father actually left the family and moved to Waldoboro, Maine, where he worked in the local granite quarries. He died in 1929, and was buried in a pauper&#x27;s grave at Waldoboro Rural Cemetery.

McCormack attended the John Andrew Grammar School through the eighth grade. He then left school to help support his family, initially working for $3 a week (about $95 in 2021) as an errand boy for a brokerage firm. McCormack and his brothers also managed a large newspaper delivery route for $11 a week (about $347 in 2021). He later left the brokerage for the office of attorney William T. Way, where he received a 50-cent a week increase. He began to study law with Way, passed the Massachusetts bar exam at age 21, and was admitted to the bar despite not having gone to high school or college. He was also an active member of the Benevolent and Protective Order of Elks.

==Start of political career==
As a young man, McCormack began his involvement in politics by making campaign speeches on behalf of local Democratic candidates. In May 1917, McCormack was elected to serve as a member of the Massachusetts Constitutional Convention, representing the 11th Suffolk District of the Massachusetts House of Representatives.

==World War I==
In June 1918, McCormack enlisted in the United States Army for World War I, and was initially posted to Camp Devens, Massachusetts, as a member of the 14th Company of the 151st Depot Brigade. After completing his initial training, McCormack was assigned to the Infantry Replacement Center at Camp Lee, Virginia, to receive officer training. McCormack advanced through the ranks from private to sergeant major, and was attending Officer Training School at Camp Lee when the Armistice occurred. He was discharged in late November, following the end of the war.

==Continued political career==
After the war McCormack practiced law and resumed his political career. He soon entered the state legislature, representing the 11th Suffolk District in the House from 1920 to 1922 and serving in the Senate from 1923 to 1926, including holding the leadership position of Democratic floor leader in 1925 and 1926. In 1926 he made an unsuccessful primary election run against incumbent Congressman James A. Gallivan. McCormack made a favorable impression in a losing cause, leaving him well positioned for a future race. He resumed practicing law, and built a successful career as a trial attorney, which enabled him to enjoy an income that reached $30,000 a year (approximately $400,000 in 2016).

McCormack was selected as a delegate to every state Democratic convention from 1920 until his retirement. In addition, he was a delegate to the Democratic National Conventions of 1932, 1940, 1944, and 1948.

==Congressional career==
McCormack&#x27;s opportunity to run for Congress again came after Gallivan died in 1928. That November McCormack won both the special election to complete Gallivan&#x27;s term in the U.S. House as well as the general election for a full term. He was reelected 20 times, initially from the 12th District, and from the re-numbered 9th after 1963. McCormack usually won reelection without difficulty, and he served in the House from November 6, 1928, to January 3, 1971 (the 70th to 91st Congresses). He did not run for reelection in 1970.

===Early years in Congress===
At the beginning of his House career, McCormack served on the Committee on Territories, In his second term, Speaker John Nance Garner appointed McCormack to the powerful Ways and Means Committee, and he served there until 1941.

McCormack maintained a consistently liberal voting record throughout his Congressional career, including support for the New Deal. In 1934, he served as chairman of the Special Committee on Un-American Activities, known as the McCormack-Dickstein Committee, which investigated Communist and Nazi propaganda and recruitment efforts in the United States prior to World War II.

===Ascension to House leadership===
When Sam Rayburn became Speaker in 1940, he backed McCormack for majority leader, a key factor in McCormack&#x27;s victory over Clifton A. Woodrum. For the next 21 years, McCormack was the second-ranking Democrat in the House; he served as majority leader with Rayburn as Speaker when Democrats had the majority (1939–1947, 1951–1953, 1955–1961), and as minority whip with Rayburn as minority leader when the Republicans controlled the House (1947–1949, 1953–1955).

Always staunch in his opposition to both Communism and Fascism, he played a key role in extending the military draft, just before the attack on Pearl Harbor, when isolationist sentiment and opposition to U.S. involvement in World War II were still strong.

He was chairman of the Select Committee on Astronautics and Space Exploration in the 85th Congress (1957 to 1959). In that role, he introduced and secured passage of the bill that created the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA).

McCormack voted in favor of the Civil Rights Act of 1957, and voted in favor of the initial House resolution for the Civil Rights Act of 1960 on March 24, 1960, but did not vote on the Senate amendment to the bill on April 21, 1960.

===Speaker of the House===

After Rayburn&#x27;s death in November 1961, McCormack acted as Speaker until winning election to the post in early 1962; he served from January 1962 until retiring from the House in 1971. McCormack&#x27;s nine years as Speaker were dominated by House passage of Great Society legislation during the administration of Lyndon B. Johnson, including laws to expand civil rights, access to public education, and health care for the elderly.

McCormack was the first Catholic to be elected Speaker, and some critics complained that his religion sometimes showed in his leadership qualities. As an example, during the 1961 debate on federal aid to schools, McCormack insisted that church schools should be included, and the bill died because of disagreement over this issue. In 1963, McCormack changed his position, and oversaw passage of an aid bill devoted primarily to public schools.
The latter part of McCormack&#x27;s tenure increasingly focused on the debate over the Vietnam War, which he supported. McCormack&#x27;s demeanor changed during these years and he reminded some observers of a kindly elder relative attempting to provide wisdom and guidance to unruly younger family members. According to House members, McCormack&#x27;s strength was his personal consideration of members, which inspired them to return his affection and sparked a desire to work with him. His weakness was that the seniority system created entrenched committee chairmen who wielded great power in the House, but could not be controlled by the Speaker. As Speaker, McCormack pursued a national agenda; he was proud of fighting for passage of farm bills, though he said he did not have &quot;more than five flower pots in my whole district.&quot;

Between the assassination of President John F. Kennedy on November 22, 1963, and the swearing-in of Hubert Humphrey as Vice President on January 20, 1965, McCormack was first in the line of succession, thus he received Secret Service protection.

In January 1969, Arizona congressman Morris Udall attempted to unseat McCormack as Speaker. In 1970, the political attacks increased and several congressmen urged McCormack to step down because of his age. Jerome R. Waldie of California asked a party caucus to declare a lack of confidence in his leadership, which it refused to do. McCormack decided not to run for reelection to the House in early 1970, but kept his decision secret until he announced it publicly in May. McCormack was succeeded as Representative in 1971 by Louise Day Hicks, and as Speaker by Carl Albert.

==Retirement and death==

In retirement, McCormack lived in Boston. He died of pneumonia in a Dedham nursing home on November 22, 1980. He was buried at Saint Joseph Cemetery in West Roxbury, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
In 1983, the University of Massachusetts Boston established the John W. McCormack Institute of Public Affairs. In 1985, the university dedicated John W. McCormack Hall, which was named in McCormack&#x27;s honor. In 2003, the McCormack Institute was expanded into a graduate school. In 2010, the school expanded its mission again, and it was renamed the McCormack Graduate School of Policy and Global Studies. The McCormack Graduate School&#x27;s mission currently includes training in social justice, government accountability and transparency, and strengthening democratic institutions.

The John W. McCormack Post Office and Courthouse in Boston was built in the early 1930s, and was renamed in McCormack&#x27;s honor. It was designated a Boston landmark by the city Landmarks Commission in 1998, and in 2011 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

John W. McCormack Middle School in Dorchester was also named for him.

A Massachusetts state government office building at Ashburton Place in Boston is also named for McCormack.

==Family==
In 1920, McCormack married Marguerite Harriet Joyce (usually known as Harriet or M. Harriet); she was seven years older than McCormack and pursuing a career as an opera singer, a vocation she gave up after their wedding. The McCormacks had no children. While Congress was in session, they lived at the Washington Hotel.

Stories about McCormack&#x27;s devotion to his wife became legendary; his friends and colleagues claimed that they always had dinner together, no matter how late McCormack worked, and that they never spent a night apart. McCormack and his wife were devout Roman Catholics, and he was a Knight of Columbus; both were honored by the Vatican in recognition of their work on behalf of the church. Harriet McCormack died at age 87 in December 1971, following a long hospitalization. For more than a year, McCormack had spent every night in an adjoining hospital room.

Edward J. McCormack Jr., the son of McCormack&#x27;s brother Edward (&quot;Knocko&quot;), served as Massachusetts Attorney General from 1958 to 1963. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the Democratic nomination for United States Senator in 1962, and the unsuccessful Democratic nominee for Governor of Massachusetts in the 1966 election.

<doc id="265839" wikidata="Q182137" url="?curid=265839" title="Lake Maracaibo">
<text>Lake Maracaibo () is located in northwestern Venezuela, between the states of Zulia, Trujillo, and Mérida. While Maracaibo is commonly referred to as a lake, its current hydrological characteristics may better classify it as estuary and/or semi-enclosed bay connected to the Gulf of Venezuela. With a surface area of , if counted as a lake it would be the largest in South America, ahead of Lake Titicaca, as well as one of the oldest lakes on Earth, having formed 36 million years ago in the Andes Mountains.

The lake is connected to the Gulf of Venezuela to the north by a narrow spit. It is fed by numerous rivers, the biggest being the Catatumbo River. The fault in the northern section has collapsed and is rich in oil and gas resources. It is Venezuela&#x27;s main oil producing area and an important fishing and agricultural producing area. Eutrophication caused by oil pollution is a major environmental problem facing the lagoon. The area around the lagoon is inhabited by a quarter of the country&#x27;s population and is also the place with the most frequent lightning on Earth. The famous Catatumbo lightning can illuminate nighttime navigation.

==Geology==
Lake Maracaibo is located within the eponymous basin and is one of the oldest lakes on earth. It was formed 36 million years ago when the faults collapsed when the Andes were uplifted in the late Eocene. In the geological history, sea water and fresh water have alternated many times, and have flooded the area. At the end of the last glacial period, the sea level rose, connecting Lake Maracaibo directly with the Atlantic Ocean, and the lighter fresh water floated on the heavier salt water, causing nutrients to be deposited on the bottom of the lake, resulting in the accumulation of more than a five kilometer thick deposit of sediment on the bedrock.

In the Pliocene, the depression of today&#x27;s Lake Maracaibo reached what would be practically its current form. The numerous rivers that flow into the lake have been defining its banks, especially those that form the southern delta of the lake, where the Escalante, Catatumbo and Santa Ana rivers converge.

Lake Maracaibo is located in the Maracaibo lowland in the faulted basin between the Perija Mountains and the Merida Mountains of the Eastern Cordillera Mountains in northwestern Venezuela. The lake is in the shape of a vase. It is 210 kilometers long from north to south, 121 kilometers wide from east to west, covers an area of 13,512 square kilometers, the deepest is 35 meters, the shore length is about 1000 kilometers, and the volume is about 280 cubic kilometers. The largest river entering the lake, the Catatumbo River, enters the lake from west to east, providing 57% of the water entering the lake. In addition to the influence of the prevailing wind, the lake water circulates counterclockwise. There are also the Santa Ana River, Chama River, Motatán River, Escalante River, and about fifty other rivers which drain into it.

Lake Maracaibo is deep in the south and shallow in the north. The northern half of the lake, which looks like a bottleneck, is 55 kilometers long. The southeastern edge of the lake basin with a flat bottom is steep and the northwestern edge is gentle. The southern part is lighter due to river water injection, while the northern part is slightly salty due to tidal influence. The Catatumbo River forms a bird-foot-shaped delta in the southwest of the lake basin, and the surface lake water in the delta has a salinity of only 0.13%. However, the intrusion of seawater from the mouth of the lake makes the salinity of the bottom lake water higher, reaching 0.2–0.3%. The north is connected with the Gulf of Venezuela, and the spit at the mouth of the lake extends for about 26 kilometers.

== Climate ==
The annual average temperature of the lake area is 28 °C, the precipitation is more in the south and less in the north, and the average annual rainfall in the south is 1400 mm. The mountain wind from the Andes at night contacts the warm and humid air on the lake surface, forming an average of 297 mm per year. The meteorological phenomenon known as Catatumbo lightning takes place in southern part of the lake, characterized by a continuous series of lightnings that are almost continuous and silent. This makes Lake Maracaibo the place with the most frequent lightning on Earth. There are about 233 lightning strikes per square kilometer in a year on average. The nocturnal thunderstorms occur on average about 297 days per year. At its peak in September, the lake area can experience up to 280 lightning strikes per hour, approximately 28 lightning strikes per minute, lasting up to 9 hours, and is capable of illuminating nighttime navigation.

==History==
The aboriginal people who lived on the banks of the lake refer to it as Coquivacoa. The tribes of Wayuu, Caquetíos, and Quiriquires also lived in the area. When Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci and Spanish explorer Alonso de Ojeda&#x27;s fleet sailed here on August 24, 1499 (the first time Europeans entered this area), the stilt houses in which the Añú lived in reminded Vespucci of the Italian city of Venice, so he named the region &quot;Veneziola&quot; (&quot;Venezuela&quot; in Spanish), or &quot;Little Venice&quot;. Spain made two attempts to establish settlements around the lake in 1529 and 1569, but it was not until 1574 that the city of Maracaibo was successfully established. The Privateer Henry Morgan raided settlements on the lake in the Spring of 1669 and defeated a Spanish squadron sent to intercept him. On July 24, 1823, Venezuela won the famous Battle of Lake Maracaibo on the lake during the Venezuelan War of Independence.

The original depth of the lake mouth, which was only more than 4 meters deep, was increased to 8 meters after dredging in the 1930s, and the 3-kilometer-long stone breakwater was further increased to 11 meters after its completion in 1957, allowing ocean-going tankers to enter the lake, At the same time, the northern part, which was originally fresh water, became brackish. The 8,678-meter General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge over the lake connecting Maracaibo and Santa Rita was completed in 1962.

==Industry==
Lake Maracaibo is rich in oil and gas resources and is known as the &quot;oil lake&quot;. The first Spaniards who arrived used tar seeping from the lake to fill ship cracks. The Maracaibo oil field was discovered in 1914, the first oil well was constructed in 1917, and large-scale exploitation began in 1922. The oil fields are concentrated in the northeast and northwest of the lake, and the oil-producing layers are mainly Tertiary sandstone and Cretaceous limestone, with a hydrocarbon-bearing area of 1,300 square kilometers, mainly concentrated in the coastal waters 105 kilometers long and 32 kilometers wide in the east of the lake.

On the northwest coast is the capital of Zulia State, the second largest city in Venezuela and an important oil export port in the world. The lake area is also an important fishing and agricultural production area in Venezuela, supporting more than 20,000 fishermen, many of whom live in colorful traditional stilt houses built with iron sheets on the lake. The main crops on the south bank of the lake are bananas, peanuts, cocoa, coconut, sugar cane and coffee, the western shore of the lake developed dairy industry.

Lake Maracaibo and the Catatumbo River are the main traffic lines for the transportation of commodities in the nearby area, and the city of Maracaibo is the transshipment center of coffee produced in the Andes. The waterway can pass through large sea-going ships and oil tankers, exporting crude oil and agricultural and livestock products from the Andean mountains and lakes. The Lake District is home to a quarter of Venezuela&#x27;s population, and with the influx of farmers from the nearby Andes, the population of the Lake District increased from about 300,000 in 1936 to over 3.62 million in 2007.

==Nature==
Lake Maracaibo possesses highly oxygenated waters which makes it rich in algae, and in turn fish, making it very biologically diverse. It is home to clams, blue crabs, shrimp and other aquatic products, and is also home to two endangered aquatic mammals, the West Indian manatee and the Amazon river dolphin. About 145 species of fish inhabit the lake, including many endemic species such as the Maracaibo half-hooked catfish (&quot;Hypostomus maracaiboensis&quot;), the Maracaibo hairy catfish (&quot;Trichomycterus maracaiboensis&quot;), the Maracaibo Lake Lamont catfish (&quot;Lamontichthys maracaibero&quot;), Lake Maracaibo tetra (&quot;Bryconamericus motatanensis&quot;), and Maracaibo wolf anchovies (&quot;Lycengraulis limnichthys&quot;) living in surface waters.

The lake has been drilled about 14,000 times, and more than 15,000 miles of oil and gas pipelines criss-cross the lake floor, but most of these pipelines are half a century old, with oil leaking from many aging underwater pipes. Before the 1950s, the lake water could still be used directly for domestic use, but then due to the intrusion of tidal salt water caused by the widening of the lake mouth channel, the salinity of the northern lake area increased by about 1,000%, and the south also increased by 300–500%.

== Contamination ==
In lakeside towns such as the city of Maracaibo, the lake water is contaminated with E. coli from feces, oil pollution, and eutrophication caused by agricultural sewage discharged into the lake, as well as domestic and industrial wastewater, resulting in the blooms of duckweed and green algae. The presence of large amounts of duckweed blocks the passage of sunlight, significantly affecting biological cycles, preventing the development of native algae and plant species. Additionally, duckweed residues accumulate at the bottom, generating a layer of organic elements that produces large amounts of ammonium, methane and other compounds whose saturation causes eutrophication of the waters.

In the spring of 2004, heavy rains fell in the Lake Maracaibo basin, causing a large influx of fresh water into the lake. This caused nutrients originally deposited on the bottom of the lake to float to the surface of the lake, which in turn allowed the duckweed to rapidly multiply and triggered a bloom that lasted for up to eight months. The blooms were noted in June to have covered 18% of the lake, and the local government had to begin spending about $2 million per month on cleanup work.

Numerous oil spills, at least partly attributed to deficient maintenance, and the indiscriminate discharge of sewage without prior treatment, have significantly deteriorated the water quality, to the point that in some parts of the Zulia area, the water presents levels of contamination that are very dangerous for health.

Within the existing polluting activities, the mining of mineral coal has started more recently, which further contaminates the basin with pollutants.

Likewise, the so-called &quot;cañadas&quot;, which are random drainage courses, drag large amounts of garbage from the human settlements that are in their path to the lake. In addition to this, residential waste such as plastic bags and bottles are also added. These pollutants all eventually get carried into the lake.

== Islands ==
There are many islands in the lake. Some primarily consist of sedimentary rock, such as the Zapara, Pescadores, and San Carlos islands (which is geographically a peninsula), while others like Toad have tectonic origins. The majority of the islands are located in the area of the Tablazo Bay and forms the . The islands of Burro, Providencia, Hijacal, Pájaros, and the artificial islands are located at the neck of the lake and belong to other municipalities.

Artificial islands of Lake Maracaibo:

* – Residential complex in the Coquivacoa Parish of the city of Maracaibo.
* – Island created for the filling of oil tankers in the city of Cabimas. The only island in the sack of the lake.

== Bridge ==

The long General Rafael Urdaneta Bridge connects the western and eastern coast of the lake together. It held the record for being the longest cable-stayed concrete bridge in the world at the time of its inauguration in 1962. Located in the southern part of the Strait of Maracaibo, it is a vehicles-only bridge that accommodates both directions of traffic, while its height allows for the passage of vessels up to 45 meters in height.

<text>Joseph William Martin Jr. (November 3, 1884 – March 6, 1968) was an American Republican politician who served as the 44th speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1947 to 1949 and 1953 to 1955. He represented a House district centered on his hometown of North Attleborough, Massachusetts, from 1925 to 1967 and was the leader of House Republicans from 1939 until 1959, when he was ousted from leadership after the party&#x27;s disastrous losses in the 1958 elections. He was the only Republican to serve as Speaker in a sixty-four year period from 1931 to 1995. He was a &quot;compassionate conservative&quot; who opposed the New Deal and supported the conservative coalition of Republicans and southern Democrats.

Early in his career, Martin worked as a newspaper editor and served in both houses of the Massachusetts General Court. He won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1924. He was elected House Minority Leader after the 1938 elections. He also served as Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1940 to 1942 at the behest of Wendell Willkie, the 1940 Republican presidential nominee. Martin presided over five Republican National Conventions and frequently became involved in presidential politics. He urged General Douglas MacArthur to seek the 1952 Republican presidential nomination, and supporters of Robert A. Taft accused Martin of favoring Dwight D. Eisenhower in Martin&#x27;s role as chairman of the contentious 1952 Republican National Convention. After Eisenhower won the 1952 election, Martin supported Eisenhower&#x27;s internationalist foreign policy.

Martin lost his position as Republican leader after the party lost seats in the 1958 elections. He was succeeded by his more conservative deputy, Charles A. Halleck. Martin continued to serve in Congress until his defeat in the 1966 Republican primary by Margaret Heckler. Martin died in Hollywood, Florida, in 1968.

Martin was a Zionist who supported the recognition of the state of Israel.

==Background==
Joseph Martin was born in North Attleborough, Massachusetts, the son of Catherine (&quot;née&quot; Keating) and Joseph William Martin, a blacksmith. Keating was born in Ireland in 1862, immigrated from Dublin to New York City in 1878, and settled in Newark, New Jersey, where she met Martin Sr., and they married on July 2, 1882; because Martin was a Presbyterian, the union required a matrimonial dispensation, but because Martin Sr. was a Presbyterian, it was relatively easy to obtain. Martin Jr. graduated from North Attleborough High School, where he played shortstop on the school baseball team. He also played semi-professional ball in an intercity league, from which he earned ten dollars per game.

==Career==
Martin served in the Massachusetts House of Representatives (1912–1914), Massachusetts Senate (1914–1917) and the United States House of Representatives (1925–1967). He was a presidential elector in 1920.

Martin was the Chairman of the Republican National Committee from 1940 to 1942, having been recruited to that position by presidential nominee Wendell Willkie, whose nomination came as a complete surprise to political pro Martin. During the New Deal, he stood out as a major opponent of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s policies and opposed his internationalist outlook on foreign affairs. However, he supported a few New Deal measures, such as the establishment of the minimum wage.

During the 1940 presidential campaign, Martin achieved a measure of notoriety as one-third of President Roosevelt&#x27;s famous denunciation of &quot;Martin, Barton and Fish.&quot; The other two were fellow GOP House members Bruce Fairchild Barton and Hamilton Fish III.

Martin won re-election in 1946 against the social justice activist Martha Sharp. During his campaign, he called the 41-year-old woman a &quot;little girl&quot;.

After 1952, Martin joined the moderate wing of the Republican Party and supported Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s internationalist outlook (through support of foreign aid), endorsed federal aid for school construction, and backed Lyndon B. Johnson&#x27;s Economic Opportunity Act of 1964.

In 1960, McGraw-Hill published &quot;My First Fifty Years in Politics&quot;, by Joe Martin as told to Robert J. Donovan, a lively and detailed account of Martin&#x27;s role in American politics over half-a-century. Martin was the longtime publisher of &quot;The Evening Chronicle&quot; newspaper in North Attleborough. After his death it merged with a nearby rival and became &quot;The Sun Chronicle&quot; newspaper.

===Leadership===
Martin was elected House Minority Leader following Republican gains in the 1938 elections. He served as Speaker of the House of Representatives for two terms, separated in time: from 1947 to 1949, and from 1953 to 1955. The terms represented two Republican short-term majorities in the House, and Martin&#x27;s two terms were bookended by Sam Rayburn, the Texas Democrat and mentor of Lyndon Johnson with whom Martin enjoyed a warm personal relationship.

Probably the most controversial moment of Martin&#x27;s congressional career came in April 1951, when he read on the floor of Congress a letter he had received from General Douglas MacArthur, who was commanding US troops fighting in the Korean War. President Harry S Truman had decided on peace negotiations as the best way out of the grinding conflict. MacArthur&#x27;s letter, written in response to one from Martin asking for the general&#x27;s views on Truman&#x27;s policy, was scathingly critical of the president.

Martin had hoped that disclosing the letter&#x27;s contents would bolster MacArthur&#x27;s case. Instead, it ignited a political firestorm and demands for his removal. Six days after Martin read the letter on the House floor, Truman dismissed MacArthur.

Despite the unintended outcome, Martin and MacArthur remained friends. Martin invited the general to deliver what became known popularly as the &quot;Old Soldiers Never Die&quot; speech before a joint meeting of Congress following his dismissal. In 1952, Martin urged MacArthur to seek the Republican presidential nomination. MacArthur, however, favored U.S. Senator Robert A. Taft, of Ohio, who lost the nomination to Willkie in 1940, to Dewey in 1948, and to Eisenhower in 1952. Eisenhower then defeated Governor Adlai E. Stevenson II of Illinois.

In his capacity as leader of the House Republicans, Martin presided over the Republican National Convention on five occasions between 1940 and 1956. In 1940, he was instrumental in the choice of Senate Minority Leader Charles L. McNary of Oregon as Wendell Willkie&#x27;s running mate. Martin&#x27;s most controversial role was at the 1952 Republican National Convention, when several of his rulings were seen as tilting the nomination to Eisenhower over Taft.

In preparation for the 1952 elections, Martin traveled to Hot Springs, Arkansas, for a regional Republican meeting called by the state party chairman Osro Cobb, a former member of the Arkansas House of Representatives, to unveil a potential strategy to make the party competitive in the American South. &quot;We came away from the meeting more determined and better prepared to advance the two-party system in the South,&quot; recalled Cobb in his memoirs, as the Republicans won at the presidential level that year in Tennessee, Texas, Florida, and Virginia.

Martin was in the Speaker&#x27;s chair presiding over the House on March 1, 1954, when four Puerto Rican independence activists opened fire on the House, wounding five Representatives. Martin declared the House in recess as he sought cover behind a marble pillar on the rostrum.
Martin would be the last Republican to serve as Speaker of the House until the election of Newt Gingrich of Georgia 40 years later. Martin remained the leader of the House Republicans until 1958, when the party experienced heavy losses in that year&#x27;s elections. In the aftermath, Martin was ousted from the leadership by his deputy, Charles A. Halleck.

Despite the defeat, Martin chose to remain as a backbench member of the House. Eight years later, in 1966, he was ousted from his seat in the Republican primary by a more liberal Republican, Margaret Heckler, who was 46 years his junior. He was also one of seven Speakers to serve more than one non-consecutive term and the second Republican to do so. Martin voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, and 1964, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. Martin voted in favor of the House amendment to the Voting Rights Act of 1965 on July 9, 1965, but did not vote on the joint conference committee report on August 3, 1965.

A lifelong bachelor, Martin never married.

Martin died in Hollywood, Florida, on March 6, 1968. He was buried at Mount Hope Cemetery in North Attleborough, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==
Today in his hometown of North Attleborough, the Joseph W. Martin Jr. Elementary School bears his name, as does the Joseph W. Martin Institute for Law and Society which houses his personal archives. The Martin Institute is located at Stonehill College in North Easton, Massachusetts.

In 2007, the North Attleborough High School Alumni Association established the Joseph W. Martin Jr. Distinguished Alumni Award to recognize the outstanding professional and civic achievements of the men and women who are former students of North Attleborough High School.

<doc id="265845" wikidata="Q2094491" url="?curid=265845" title="Tip O'Neill">
<text>Thomas Phillip &quot;Tip&quot; O&#x27;Neill Jr. (December 9, 1912 – January 5, 1994) was an American Democratic Party politician from Massachusetts who served as the 47th speaker of the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987, the third-longest tenure in history and the longest uninterrupted tenure. He represented northern Boston in the House from 1953 to 1987.

Born in North Cambridge, Massachusetts, O&#x27;Neill began campaigning at a young age by volunteering for Al Smith&#x27;s campaign in the 1928 presidential election. After graduating from Boston College, he won election to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, where he became a strong advocate of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s New Deal policies. He became Speaker of the Massachusetts House in 1949 and won election to the United States House of Representatives in 1952 to succeed John F. Kennedy.

In the U.S. House, O&#x27;Neill became a protégé of fellow Boston Representative John William McCormack. O&#x27;Neill broke with President Lyndon B. Johnson on the Vietnam War in 1967 and called for Richard Nixon&#x27;s resignation in light of the Watergate scandal. He quickly moved up the leadership ranks in the 1970s, becoming House Majority Whip in 1971, House Majority Leader in 1973, and Speaker of the House in 1977. With the election of President Jimmy Carter, O&#x27;Neill hoped to establish a universal health care system and a guaranteed jobs program. However, relations between Carter and Congress deteriorated, and Carter lost re-election in the 1980 presidential election to Ronald Reagan, a conservative Republican. O&#x27;Neill became a leading opponent of President Reagan&#x27;s conservative domestic policies, but O&#x27;Neill and Reagan found common ground in foreign policy, fostering the Anglo-Irish Agreement and implementing the Reagan Doctrine (despite considerable opposition to Reagan&#x27;s support for the Contras in Nicaragua) in the Soviet–Afghan War.

O&#x27;Neill retired from Congress in 1987 but remained active in public life. He published a best-selling autobiography and appeared in several commercials and other media. He died of cardiac arrest in 1994.

==Early life and education==
O&#x27;Neill was the third of three children born to Thomas Phillip O&#x27;Neill and Rose Ann (née Tolan) O&#x27;Neill in the Irish middle-class area of North Cambridge, Massachusetts on December 9 1912, known at the time as &quot;Old Dublin.&quot; His mother died when he was nine months old, and he was raised largely by a French-Canadian housekeeper until his father remarried when he was eight in 1921. O&#x27;Neill Sr. started out as a bricklayer, and later won a seat on the Cambridge City Council and was appointed Superintendent of Sewers. During his childhood, O&#x27;Neill received the nickname &quot;Tip&quot; after the Canadian baseball player James &quot;Tip&quot; O&#x27;Neill. He was educated in Roman Catholic schools, graduating in 1931 from the now defunct St. John High School in Cambridge, where he was captain of the basketball team; he was a lifelong parishioner at the school&#x27;s affiliated parish church St. John the Evangelist Church. From there he went to Boston College, from which he graduated in 1936.

==Entry into politics==
O&#x27;Neill first became active in politics at 15, campaigning for Al Smith in his 1928 presidential campaign. Four years later, he helped campaign for Franklin D. Roosevelt. As a senior at Boston College, O&#x27;Neill ran for a seat on the Cambridge City Council, but lost; his first race and only electoral defeat. The campaign taught him the lesson that became his best-known quote: &quot;All politics is local.&quot;

After graduating in 1936, O&#x27;Neill was elected at the age of 24 to the Massachusetts House of Representatives, aided by tough economic times among his constituents; the experience made him a strong advocate of the New Deal policies of Roosevelt, which were just then coming to an end. His biographer John Aloysius Farrell said his background in Depression-era working-class Boston, and his interpretation of his Catholic faith, led O&#x27;Neill to view the role of government as intervening to cure social ailments. O&#x27;Neill was &quot;an absolute, unrepentant, unreconstructed New Deal Democrat,&quot; Farrell wrote.

In 1949, he became the first Democratic Speaker of the Massachusetts House of Representatives in its history. He remained in that post until 1952, when he ran for the United States House of Representatives from his home district.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
O&#x27;Neill was elected to the congressional seat vacated by Senator-elect John F. Kennedy in 1952. He would be reelected 16 more times, never facing serious opposition. His district, centered around the northern half of Boston, was originally numbered as the 11th District, but became the 8th District in 1963.

During his second term in the House, O&#x27;Neill was selected to the House Rules Committee where he proved a crucial asset for the Democratic leadership, particularly his mentor, fellow Boston congressman and later Speaker, John William McCormack. O&#x27;Neill voted in favor of the Civil Rights Acts of 1957, 1960, 1964, and 1968, as well as the 24th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. O&#x27;Neill voted against the Alaska Statehood Act but in favor of the Hawaii Admission Act.

After wrestling with the issues surrounding the Vietnam War, in 1967 O&#x27;Neill broke with President Lyndon B. Johnson and came out in opposition to America&#x27;s involvement. O&#x27;Neill wrote in his autobiography that he also became convinced that the conflict in Vietnam was a civil war and that US involvement was morally wrong. While the decision cost O&#x27;Neill some support among older voters in his home district, he benefited from new support among students and faculty members at the many colleges and universities there. In the House of Representatives itself, O&#x27;Neill picked up the trust and support of younger House members who shared his antiwar views, and they became important friends who contributed to O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s rise through the ranks in the House.

In 1971, O&#x27;Neill was appointed Majority Whip in the House, the number three position for the Democratic Party in the House. Two years later, in 1973, he was elected House Majority Leader, following the disappearance of a small plane carrying Majority Leader Hale Boggs and Congressman Nick Begich in Alaska. As Majority Leader, O&#x27;Neill was the most prominent Democrat in the House to call for the impeachment of President Richard M. Nixon in light of the Watergate scandal.

==Speaker of the House==
As a result of the Tongsun Park influence-peddling scandal, House Speaker Carl Albert retired from Congress and O&#x27;Neill was elected speaker in 1977, the same year that Jimmy Carter became president.

===Nursing home scandal===
Tongsun Park had not directly paid O&#x27;Neill, although Park&#x27;s parties in his honor and a new scandal involving a nursing home in which O&#x27;Neill had invested $5,000 as a small-business loan in violation of federal law raised questions of impropriety, but did not prevent his reelection.

===Carter administration===
With substantial majorities in both houses of Congress and control of the White House, O&#x27;Neill hoped that Democrats would be able to implement their legislation, including universal health care and guaranteed jobs programs. However, the Democrats lacked party discipline, and while the Carter administration and O&#x27;Neill started out strong with the passage of ethics and energy packages in 1977, there were major stumbles. Troubles began with Carter&#x27;s threats to veto a water-projects bill, a pet project of many members of Congress. O&#x27;Neill and other Democratic leaders were also upset by Carter&#x27;s appointments of a number of his fellow Georgians, whom O&#x27;Neill considered arrogant and parochial, to federal offices and White House staff.

O&#x27;Neill was also dismayed by Carter&#x27;s frugal behavior in cutting executive staff and reducing the scale of White House entertainment. Carter even ended the practice of serving hard liquor at the White House to guests as a cost cutting measure. As Carter&#x27;s term began in early 1977, Democratic leaders on Capitol Hill were invited to the White House for a breakfast where Carter served them sugar cookies and coffee. O&#x27;Neill, a man of expansive appetite expecting the traditional eggs and sausage, said, &quot;Mr. President... you know, we won the election.&quot; Carter was a reform-minded executive who often clashed with O&#x27;Neill on legislation. O&#x27;Neill wanted to reward loyal Democrats with projects at a time when Carter wanted to reduce government spending. A continually weakening economy and the Iran hostage crisis made prospects bleak for Carter and the Democrats in the 1980 congressional and presidential elections.

===Reagan administration===

O&#x27;Neill was a leading opponent of the Reagan administration&#x27;s domestic and defense policies. Following the 1980 election, with the U.S. Senate controlled by Republicans, O&#x27;Neill became the leader of the congressional opposition. O&#x27;Neill even went as far as calling Ronald Reagan &quot;the most ignorant man who had ever occupied the White House,&quot; &quot;Herbert Hoover with a smile&quot;, and &quot;a cheerleader for selfishness.&quot; He also said that Reagan&#x27;s policies meant that his presidency was &quot;one big Christmas party for the rich.&quot; Privately, O&#x27;Neill and Reagan were always on cordial terms, or, as Reagan wrote in his memoirs, they were friends &quot;after 6 p.m.&quot;. In that same memoir, when questioned by Reagan regarding a personal attack against the president that had made the paper, O&#x27;Neill explained that &quot;before 6 p.m. it&#x27;s all politics&quot;. Reagan once compared O&#x27;Neill to the classic arcade game &quot;Pac-Man&quot; in a speech, saying that he was &quot;a round thing that gobbles up money.&quot; He also once joked he had received a valentine card from O&#x27;Neill: &quot;I knew it was from Tip, because the .&quot;

However, O&#x27;Neill gave tacit approval to Democratic congressman Charlie Wilson to implement the Reagan Doctrine in the Soviet-Afghan war. Wilson&#x27;s position on the appropriations committees, and his close relations with CIA officer Gust Avrakotos, allowed him to steer billions of dollars to the Mujahideen through the CIA and Zia ul-Haq&#x27;s ISI.

There was some contention about constitutional order of succession, which involved O&#x27;Neill, when Reagan was shot in March 1981. Secretary of State Alexander Haig famously said that he was &quot;in control here&quot; in response to a question as to who was in charge (with the president under anesthesia and Vice President George Bush traveling), but it was later pointed out that O&#x27;Neill was next in line after Bush. Reagan was only unconscious for a few hours, and no formal invocation of the line of succession took place.

On October 21, 1986, O&#x27;Neill, representing President Reagan, threw out the ceremonial first pitch at Game 3 of the 1986 World Series, played at Fenway Park.

===Northern Ireland===
One of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s accomplishments as speaker involved Northern Ireland. O&#x27;Neill worked with fellow Irish-American politicians New York governor Hugh Carey, Senator Edward Kennedy, and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan to craft a peace accord between the warring factions. Beginning with the &quot;Saint Patrick&#x27;s Day declaration&quot; in 1977, denouncing violence in Northern Ireland and culminating with the Irish aid package upon the signing of the Anglo-Irish Agreement in 1985, the &quot;Four Horsemen&quot;, as they were called, convinced both Carter and Reagan to press the British government on the subject. In 1981, O&#x27;Neill also created the Friends of Ireland with Kennedy and Moynihan, an organization to promote peace in Northern Ireland.

O&#x27;Neill was made an honorary Irish citizen (an honor granting legally full citizenship) by the Republic of Ireland in 1986.

==Post-speakership==
After retiring from Congress in 1987, O&#x27;Neill published his autobiography, &quot;Man of the House&quot;. Though it had a mixed reception by critics it became a national best-seller. The book also helped turn him into a national icon, and O&#x27;Neill starred in a number of commercials, including those for Trump Shuttle, Commodore Computers, Quality International Budget Hotels and for Miller Lite, in which he appeared with Bob Uecker. Critics, however, noted some inaccuracies with his book such as his views of the Grenada invasion conflicting with his public opinions of the time, David Powers questioning that John F. Kennedy&#x27;s aide Kenneth O&#x27;Donnell allegedly heard more shots during his assassination in a conversation with O&#x27;Neill, and Senator Barbara Mikulski saying that &quot;Tip has his memoirs mixed up,&quot; regarding opposition towards O&#x27;Neill endorsing Geraldine Ferraro in the 1984 vice presidential election.
In 1987, O&#x27;Neill received the Freedom Medal.

On November 18, 1991, O&#x27;Neill was presented with the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George H. W. Bush.

In retirement, O&#x27;Neill, who suffered from colon cancer, made public service advertisements about cancer in which he joined athletes and movie stars in talking candidly about having the disease.

==In popular culture==
O&#x27;Neill was referenced as an example of physical humor in the &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; episode &quot;The Outrageous Okona&quot; when a holographic comedian names O&#x27;Neill and posits that him wearing a dress would qualify as funny. This is the result of the android Data trying to gain a comprehension of comedy, a talent that he does not possess.

O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s emergence as a cultural figure was not restricted to commercials. Four years before his retirement, he had a cameo role in the February 17, 1983, episode of &quot;Cheers&quot; entitled &quot;No Contest,&quot; which featured him ducking into the bar to escape Diane Chambers, who had pestered him on the street about his political ideals. The show, which was ranked 60th in the Nielsen ratings at that time, jumped 20 places the following week. He appeared in an episode of the NBC sitcom &quot;Silver Spoons&quot;, which featured him delivering a mock press conference praising recurring character Freddy Lippincottleman&#x27;s efforts on behalf of the homeless. O&#x27;Neill also made a brief appearance in the 1993 film &quot;Dave&quot; as himself, assessing the work of the fictional American president in the movie. He also voiced narration for a segment of the Ken Burns series &quot;Baseball&quot; in which O&#x27;Neill, a lifelong Red Sox fan, read &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; from the day the Red Sox won the 1918 World Series.

In the comic strip &quot;Shoe&quot;, the character Sen. Batson D. Belfry is modeled after O&#x27;Neill.

O&#x27;Neill was portrayed by Dan Lauria in the 2024 film &quot;Reagan&quot;.

==Personal life==

O&#x27;Neill resided on 26 Russell Street in North Cambridge, although he had lived as a child around the corner on Orchard St. He had a vacation home on Woodland Rd. near Bank Street Beach in Harwich Port, Massachusetts. His wife was Mildred &quot;Millie&quot; Anne Miller (1914–2003). They had five children. His oldest son and namesake, Thomas P. O&#x27;Neill III, a former lieutenant governor of Massachusetts, works in public relations in Boston. Another son, Christopher, is a Washington lawyer. His third son, Michael, is deceased. Daughter Susan has a business in Washington, D.C., and the other daughter, Rosemary (died July 20, 2022) was a political officer for the State Department.

In 1980, O&#x27;Neill was awarded the Laetare Medal by the University of Notre Dame, considered the most prestigious award for American Catholics.

He is the grandfather of actor Thomas Philip O&#x27;Neill IV.

===Death and legacy===
O&#x27;Neill died from cardiac arrest at Brigham and Women&#x27;s Hospital in Boston on January 5, 1994, at the age of 81. President Bill Clinton paid tribute to him, saying, &quot;Tip O&#x27;Neill was the nation&#x27;s most prominent, powerful and loyal champion of working people... He loved politics and government because he saw that politics and government could make a difference in people&#x27;s lives. And he loved people most of all.&quot; Millie died in 2003 and is buried near her husband, at Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Harwich Port, Massachusetts.

The Thomas P. O&#x27;Neill Jr. Tunnel, built through downtown Boston as part of the Big Dig to carry Interstate 93 under Boston, was named after him. Other structures named after him include a House Office Building, the O&#x27;Neill Branch of the Cambridge Public Library (including an outdoor mural), the Thomas P. O&#x27;Neill Jr. Federal Building in Boston, a federal office building in Washington, D.C., a golf course in Cambridge, and the main library (and the plaza in front of it) at his alma mater, Boston College.

On June 22, 2008, the play &quot;According to Tip&quot; debuted in Watertown, Massachusetts, produced by the New Repertory Theatre. The one-man biographical play, written by longtime Boston sportswriter Dick Flavin, features O&#x27;Neill telling stories of his life, from his childhood to after his retirement in politics. Tony Award winner Ken Howard played the title role in the premiere production.

In December 2012, the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum hosted a forum to celebrate the of O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s birth. O&#x27;Neill himself contributed several oral history interviews to its archives chronicling his work for the Democratic party and friendship with President Kennedy.
