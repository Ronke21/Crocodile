<text>Operation Granby, commonly abbreviated Op Granby, was the code name given to the British military operations during the 1991 Gulf War. 53,462 members of the British Armed Forces were deployed during the conflict. Forty-seven British personnel were killed during Op Granby and many more were injured during the hostilities there. The total cost of operations was £2.434 billion (1992), of which at least £2.049 billion was paid for by other nations such as Kuwait and Saudi Arabia. £200 million of equipment was lost or written off.

== Commanders ==
The Joint Commander Gulf Forces, based in the United Kingdom at RAF High Wycombe, was Air Chief Marshal (ACM) Sir Patrick Hine 1 October 1990 – 31 March 1991, and Air Chief Marshal Sir Michael Graydon from 31 March 1991. His political adviser was Andrew Palmer.

The Commander of British Forces Middle East, the in-theatre commander, based in Riyadh, was Air Marshal (AM) Andrew Wilson (September–October 1990), then Lieutenant-General Sir Peter de la Billière 6 October 1990 – March 1991, and Air Vice-Marshal Ian Macfadyen from March 1991.

The Air Commander of British Forces Middle East, initially Arabian Peninsula, was Air Vice Marshal Andrew Wilson from August to 17 November 1990, then Air Vice Marshal William (Bill) Wratten from 17 November 1990.

The Senior British Naval Officer Middle East was Captain Anthony McEwen, Royal Navy until September 1990, on , then Commodore Paul Haddacks from September to December 1990. Commodore Christopher Craig, on and , was in command from 3 December 1990 to March 1991.

==Royal Air Force==
Within nine days of the invasion of Kuwait on 2 August 1990, 12 Panavia Tornado F3 interceptors from 5 (AC) Squadron and 29 (F) Squadron from RAF Coningsby arrived in Saudi Arabia, alongside aircraft of the United States Air Force (USAF). Later, Jaguar GR1 aircraft from RAF Coltishall, and Tornado GR1s, redeployed from service in RAF Germany deployed to the theatre. Buccaneer aircraft from RAF Lossiemouth were deployed in order to laser designate ground targets for the Tornado and Jaguar.

This action had the effect of maintaining the confidence of friendly nations, and limiting the potential for further Iraqi expansion. When an economic embargo was placed on Iraq, these aircraft helped maintain it. The force of Tornado F3s was expanded to 18, drawn from the three British bases then housing F3s, RAF Leuchars, RAF Leeming, and RAF Coningsby, with 27 air crew and 350 ground personnel. RAF ground personnel and aircraft weapons technicians were also taken from TWCU at RAF Honington, and operated Tornados out of Tabuk airfield.

The first SCUD missile attack launched against a coalition airbase was at Tabuk. It was a conventional missile and only caused minor damage.

RAF forces were based at the Royal Saudi Air Force airbase at Dhahran, from where they flew patrols inside the range of Iraqi ground radar systems. Before the launch of the operation to liberate Kuwait, they flew over 2,000 sorties. Victor tankers based at Jubail Naval Base provided AAR support to all the coalition aircraft. Hercules, VC10, and TriStar aircraft supplied both the Royal Air Force and other military endeavours. Nimrod MR.2P aircraft assisted naval operations. At bases in Tabuk, Dhahran, and Muharraq, the RAF deployed Rapier missiles as part of surface-to-air defences. In total, around 6,000 RAF personnel were deployed to the Gulf.
RAF commanders, along with the other partners in the coalition, deemed it necessary to prevent the Iraqi Air Force (IrAF) operating to any significant degree. Believed to have around 700 combat aircraft, as well as Scud ballistic missiles and chemical weapons, they could not be left to help support Iraqi ground forces, now entrenched in positions on the border. Because of the level of supplies coming from Iraq to forces in Kuwait, it would have been impossible to separate targets merely in Kuwait from an offensive into Iraq. Coalition air forces outnumbered the IrAF 3-to-1.

The first part of the Gulf War air campaign was directed against the IrAF. Early on 17 January, RAF Tornado GR1s flew into Iraq, with air-to-air refuelling tanker support. The first targets were Iraqi airbases, which housed a variety of defence systems and aircraft. These attacks were co-ordinated in Riyadh by the Joint Allied Headquarters, with Wratten now leading the British command. Aircraft were almost totally integrated into a single coalition force. Support aircraft in raids, therefore, could be from any coalition power. Within 24 hours, a hundred sorties were completed.

After seven days, the RAF&#x27;s focus, like the rest of coalition air forces, moved to targets supporting Iraqi forces in Kuwait. These included oil refineries, and strategic bridges over the River Euphrates. During operations, civilians were killed in incidences when the sophisticated guidance systems on the weaponry used failed, and buildings close to these bridges, many in populated areas, were hit instead. On the whole, many pilots were frustrated by the lack of combat.

In every combat role, the RAF was second to USAF involvement, but ahead of other members of the coalition. Of the around 55 Allied aircraft lost, eight were RAF Tornados; these aircraft types flew a total of 2,500 sorties. Five air crew were lost in operations, and three in preparations.

==British Army==

A single British Army armoured brigade was initially dispatched to the Gulf, later augmented to a two-brigade division, which became the 1st Armoured Division. The decision was made that the relatively new Challenger tank be sent, rather than the older and more reliable Chieftain tanks, which were being superseded. The Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, &quot;insisted on Challenger&#x27;s reliability in the Gulf. In consequence to this demand, BAOR regiments in Germany became &#x27;a scrap yard&#x27; of [tank hulls] without spares, sitting on wooden blocks. Everything else was being sent to the Gulf as spares in support of 7th Armoured Brigade.&quot; The entire British Army&#x27;s power pack repair facility was deployed to the Gulf with the division.

The ground forces had a peak strength of 28,000 men, comprising 7,000 vehicles, including 179 Challenger 1 tanks, 316 Warriors, 79 artillery pieces and 16 MLRS.

During the ground phase, the 1st Armoured Division took part in the &quot;left-hook&quot; which outflanked Iraqi forces. It participated in the Battle of Norfolk. British Challenger 1 tanks destroyed approximately 300 Iraqi tanks, including achieving the longest-range tank-kill in the war from three miles away.

The British Army also inflicted heavy artillery and various other combat vehicle losses on the Iraqi Army. The British Army destroyed approximately five Iraqi divisions in 48 hours of combat. A friendly fire incident, when an American Fairchild Republic A-10A Thunderbolt aircraft attacked two British Warrior vehicles, resulted in the deaths of nine British service personnel. This incident was featured in an edition of The Cook Report entitled &quot;Death by Maverick&quot;.

==Royal Navy==
The Royal Navy made a significant contribution to Allied efforts in the early stages of the war. In particular, Royal Navy Westland Lynx helicopters were responsible for the destruction of almost the entire Iraqi Navy in the Battle of Bubiyan, also known as the Battle of the Bubiyan Channel.

Royal Navy minehunters cleared Iraqi mines near the Kuwaiti coast, allowing the US battleships &quot;Wisconsin&quot; and &quot;Missouri&quot; to move in close enough to launch devastating bombardments against Iraqi ground forces. HMS &quot;Gloucester&quot; intercepted an Iraqi Silkworm missile heading towards HMS &quot;London&quot;, mine countermeasures vessels, and the US battleships.

<doc id="269135" wikidata="Q897665" url="?curid=269135" title="Lake Tianchi Monster">
<text>Lake Tianchi Monster is the name given to what is said to be a lake monster that lives in Heaven Lake (known as &quot;Cheonji&quot; in Korean) located in the peak of Baekdu Mountain within the Baekdu-daegan and Changbai mountain ranges encompassing Jilin Province of China and Ryanggang Province of North Korea. According to Beijing Youth Daily, an estimated 20 monsters were reported; however, &quot;scientists are skeptical that any large creature would be able to survive in the lake given its recent history of volcanic activity&quot;, and skeptics say &quot;it&#x27;s all in the imagination, or just a floating volcanic rock&quot;.

==Sightings==
The first reported sighting was in 1903. It was claimed that a large buffalo-like creature attacked three people, but was shot six times. The monster then retreated under the water.

In 21 to 23 August 1962, a person using a telescope reportedly saw two of the monsters chasing each other in water. More than a hundred people reported the sightings.

More recent reports describe the monster as having a human-like head attached to a neck. It is said to have a white ring around the bottom of its neck, and the rest of its skin is grey and smooth.

In 2007, Zhuo Yongsheng, a Chinese TV reporter said he had shot a 20-minute video of six unidentified creatures in the volcanic lake on 6 September. He later sent still photos to Xinhua&#x27;s Jilin provincial bureau. According to a news report one of these showed the six &quot;Nessies&quot; swimming in parallel in three pairs. Another one of them featured the animals closer together, leaving circular ripples on the lake surface.

Zhuo said he had seen the six seal-like, finned creatures swimming and frolicking in the lake for an hour and a half, before they disappeared around 7:00 a.m. &quot;They could swim as fast as yachts and at times they would all disappear in the water. It was impressive to see them all acting at exactly the same pace, as if someone was giving orders,&quot; he said. &quot;Their fins—or maybe wings—were longer than their bodies.&quot;

==In popular culture==
The Mountain Goats&#x27; 2008 album, &quot;Heretic Pride&quot; features the song, &quot;Tianchi Lake&quot; about the monster: &quot;Backstroking on the surface, moonlight on its face / Floats the Tianchi monster, staring into space.&quot;

<text>The Scottish Government (, ) is the executive arm of the devolved government of Scotland. It was formed in 1999 as the Scottish Executive following the 1997 referendum on Scottish devolution, and is headquartered at St Andrew&#x27;s House in the capital city, Edinburgh. It has been described as one of the most powerful devolved governments globally, with full legislative control over a number of areas, including the economy, education, healthcare, justice and the legal system, rural affairs, housing, the crown estate, the environment, emergency services, equal opportunities, the transportation network, and tax, amongst others.

Ministers are appointed by the first minister with the approval of the Scottish Parliament and the monarch from among the members of the Parliament. The Scotland Act 1998 makes provision for ministers and junior ministers, referred to by the current administration as Cabinet secretaries and ministers, in addition to two law officers: the lord advocate and the solicitor general for Scotland. Collectively the Scottish Ministers and the Civil Service staff that support the Scottish Government are formally referred to as the Scottish Administration. Only the first minister and their deputy, cabinet secretaries, the law officers, the permanent secretary and Minister for Parliamentary Business serve within the Scottish Cabinet.

The Scottish Government consists of the Scottish Ministers, which is the term used to describe their collective legal functions. The Scottish Government is accountable to the Scottish Parliament, which was also created by the Scotland Act 1998 with the first minister appointed by the monarch following a proposal by the Parliament. The Scottish Parliament can legislate on any matter that is not reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

==History==

===Pre–1707===


Prior to the Treaty of Union 1707, the Crown in Scotland was the most important element of government in the Kingdom of Scotland despite the many royal minorities. Government in the Kingdom of Scotland was mostly executed by the Privy Council of Scotland, the body of advisers to the Scottish monarch. Recognised as having substantially more powers than the parliament, its responsibilities included the political, administrative, economic and social affairs of the country, and supervised the administration of the law, regulated trade and shipping, took emergency measures against the plague, granted licences to travel, administered oaths of allegiance, banished beggars and gypsies, dealt with witches, recusants, Covenanters and Jacobites and tackled the problem of lawlessness in the Highlands and the Borders. 

In the late Middle Ages, it saw much of the aggrandisement associated with the New Monarchs elsewhere in Europe. Theories of constitutional monarchy and resistance were articulated by Scots, particularly George Buchanan, in the 16th century, but James VI of Scotland advanced the theory of the divine right of kings, and these debates were restated in subsequent reigns and crises. The court remained at the centre of political life, and in the 16th century emerged as a major centre of display and artistic patronage, until it was effectively dissolved with the Union of the Crowns in 1603. The Parliament of Scotland also emerged as a major legal institution, gaining an oversight of taxation and policy. By the end of the Middle Ages it was sitting almost every year, partly because of the frequent royal minorities and regencies of the period, which may have prevented it from being sidelined by the monarchy.

===Post–1707===
 

The signing of the 1707 Treaty of Union ended the political independence of Scotland. The Parliament of Scotland, the countries legislature situated at Parliament House, Edinburgh, was subsumed into the Parliament of Great Britain which would be based in London. Following the ratification of the Treaty of Union, Parliament House became the seat of the Supreme Courts of Scotland in which it remains today. Under the terms of the Treaty of Union, various elements of independence from England was retained for Scotland, such as a separate education and legal system (including the Scottish court system – Court of Session and High Court of Justiciary) as was the countries church and religion. Additionally, the Crown of Scotland and the Honours of Scotland were to remain in Scotland, as were all parliamentary and other official records.

In 1885, many domestic policy functions relating to Scotland were brought into the responsibility of the Scottish Office, a department of the Government of the United Kingdom which was headed by a Secretary for Scotland, later the Secretary of State for Scotland. In 1969, a Royal Commission on the Constitution was established to examine the constitutional composition in which various models to introduce devolution in Scotland was considered, some of which were accepted whilst some were rejected. During the 1970s, there was increasing pressure to reform the constitution, and thus, the Labour government under Prime Minister James Callaghan, held a referendum on Scottish devolution in 1979. The referendum would have enacted the Scotland Act 1978, and would have created a Scottish Assembly with limited legislative powers. There would have been a Scottish Executive headed by a &quot;First Secretary&quot;, taking over some of the functions of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Meetings of the Scottish Assembly would have been held at the Old Royal High School in Regent Road, Edinburgh. The former school hall was adapted for use by the Scottish Assembly, including the installation of microphones and new olive-green leather seating. Members would have been elected by the &quot;first past the post&quot; system. Despite a majority of the Scottish population voting Yes in the 1979 referendum (52% in favour), it only amounted to 33% of the electorate and therefore was not recognised.

The 1979 Conservative Party government, headed by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, did not support devolution for Scotland as detailed in the Scotland Act 1978. Instead, it supported the devolution of further powers to the administrative government of Scotland and allowing special treatment of Scottish business in Parliament. 

===Scotland Act 1998===


In 1997, the Labour Party returned to government, with Tony Blair as Prime Minister, and had included the establishment of a Scottish Parliament in its manifesto for the 1997 general election, which they won with a landslide majority of 179. Blair held a referendum on Scottish devolution in September 1997, with 1,775,045 people (74.2%) voting in favour in contrast to 614,400 (25.7%) voting against the proposal. The referendum result was recognised, and the Scotland Act 1998 created both a Scottish Parliament and a Scottish Executive, with many of the functions of the Secretary of State for Scotland being transferred to the Scottish Ministers, accountable to a devolved Scottish Parliament. The new parliament and Scottish Executive were also to have control over tax varying powers, and full legislative control over areas such as healthcare, education, policing, Scots law, environment, housing, local government, culture and some aspects of transportation, amongst others. 

Subsequently, the Scotland Acts of 2012 and 2016 transferred powers over some taxation including Income Tax, Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, Landfill Tax, Aggregates Levy and Air Departure Tax, drink driving limits, Scottish Parliament and local authority elections, some social security powers, the Crown Estate of Scotland, some aspects of the benefits system, some aspects of the energy network in Scotland including renewable energy, energy efficiency and onshore oil and gas licensing, some aspects of equality legislation in Scotland and gaming machine licensing. 

The first Scottish Executive was formed by First Minister Donald Dewar as a coalition between the Scottish Labour Party and the Scottish Liberal Democrats. During this period, ministerial appointees were divided into ministers and deputy ministers. The Labour-Liberal Democrat coalition continued under subsequent First Ministers Henry McLeish and Jack McConnell. Following the 2007 Scottish Parliament election, Alex Salmond became the first politician from the Scottish National Party to lead the Scottish Government. He became first minister in 2007 and served in office until his resignation in 2014, with his former deputy first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, succeeding him in November 2014. 

Since 2007, the Scottish Executive has used the name Scottish Government. The change of name was later recognised in United Kingdom legislation by the Scotland Act 2012. In 2001, former First Minister Henry McLeish had proposed such a change, but experienced some opposition. At the same time that the Scottish Government began to use its new name, a new emblem was adopted. It replaced the use of a version of the Royal Arms with the Flag of Scotland. In September 2014, the Scottish Government held a referendum on Scotland regaining its independence, following the signing of the Edinburgh Agreement in 2012 by the Scottish Government and UK Government which transferred powers from the UK Parliament to the Scottish Parliament to hold a referendum on the issue.

The Scottish Government&#x27;s main headquarters are based at St Andrew&#x27;s House in the capital city, Edinburgh. Additionally, the Scottish Government has offices at Victoria Quay, Saughton House and Bute House (the official residence of the first minister), all located in Edinburgh, with an additional office at 5 Atlantic Quay in Glasgow. All Ministers and officials have access to Scotland House at Victoria Embankment in London, when necessary. Dover House on Whitehall is now used by the Scotland Office and the devolved Scottish Ministers no longer use it.

From 1 January 2021, the Scottish Government instructed all Scottish legislation be legally required to keep in regulatory alignment in devolved competences with future European Union law following the end of the Brexit transition period which ended on 31 December 2020 after the Scottish Parliament passed the UK Withdrawal from the European Union (Continuity) (Scotland) Act 2020.

==Functions==
===Parliament===


The Scottish Government is separate from the Scottish Parliament, with the parliament being made of 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament elected by the electorate of Scotland during Scottish Parliamentary elections. The Scottish Parliament acts as the law making body for devolved matters which fall under the responsibility of the Scottish Government. The work of the Scottish Government, including proposed legislation, policies and activities, is scrutinised by parliament through a variety of different measures such as parliamentary debates, parliament committees and parliamentary questions to the appropriate Cabinet Secretary or government minister.

The Scottish Government is directly responsible for implementing the laws which have received parliamentary approval by the Scottish Parliament. The party with the largest number of MSPs elected to the Scottish Parliament following parliamentary elections is responsible for forming a government. As such, it is the Scottish Government which proposes the majority of bills to the parliament for consideration before becoming law. If parliament gives a bill an overall majority, it passes and becomes enshrined in Scots law following receiving royal assent from the monarch. Each law is approved by the monarch using the Great Seal of Scotland.

Each year, the Scottish Government produces its annual budget for public spending which is presented to members of the Scottish Parliament for consideration. The Budget Bill is scrutinised by the parliamentary committees, and goes through three parliamentary stages before passing – a parliamentary debate on the general principles of the Budget Bill, any changes to the Budget Bill can be put forward to parliament by Scottish Government ministers, with such proposed changes being considered by the Finance and Constitution Committee, and lastly, MSPs determine whether any additional changes are required following the changes proposed by Scottish Government ministers, and members then vote on whether to pass the Bill. Similar to other acts of the Scottish Parliament, if the Budget Bill passes in the Scottish Parliament, it receives royal assent and becomes an Act of the Scottish Parliament.

Strategically, the first minister is the head of the Scottish Government, and not the head of the Scottish Parliament. The head of the Scottish Parliament is usually considered to be the presiding officer who is the speaker of the parliament and presides over all parliamentary business and debates. The Scottish Government is directly accountable to the Scottish Parliament, and both the government and parliament are directly accountable to the public of Scotland. 

=== National Performance Framework ===

The Scottish Government produces a National Performance Framework (NPF) which sets out the government&#x27;s priorities, objectives and overall vision for the country following election. First introduced in 2007, this framework acts a means to measure the performance of the government in eleven national outcome areas which include health, poverty, environment and education. It creates a pledge and commitment on the aspirations and aims that government wishes to create within the country, and serves as a means for the government to highlight national priorities and provides an opportunity for the government to evaluate its progress towards achieving the objectives as set out in the National Performance Framework. Each of the National Outcomes is measured by a number of indicators and associated data sets.

Similarly, the Programme for Government is published annually by the incumbent Scottish Government, and it highlights the government&#x27;s policies, proposed actions and legislation that the government will seek to implement in the forthcoming year.

===Legislation===

The majority of bills proposed to the Scottish Parliament come from the Scottish Government. The process for introducing bills to the parliament for consideration and debate commences with the government publishing and formulating policy. A bill will only become law in Scotland under Scots law once it has been approved by a majority of MSPs in the Scottish Parliament, where it will then be put to the Monarch to receive royal assent. Once royal assent has been given by the Monarch, the bill becomes a law of the Scottish Parliament and becomes embedded in Scots law.

Once a bill is successful in becoming law, the Scottish Government has the responsibility to ensure subordinate legislation, which often comes in the form of Scottish statutory instruments, is implemented accordingly so that the new law begins to work and that any additional measures and features can be added in order to make the law work and ensure its effective implementation and operation.

===Statistics and transparency===

The Scottish Government publishes statistics based on the majority of public life in Scotland, including, but not limited to, education, the economy, healthcare, population, death, marriages and births, as well as living standards. The government uses such statistics in order to evaluate its work against the data to gauge how successful, or unsuccessful, government policy is and whether it is having the desired impact.

In order to ensure accountability, the Scottish Government publishes information for public consumption in order to ensure the work of the Scottish Government is accessible and transparent for the public. It commits itself to publishing information in areas relating to the spending of public money and creating a breakdown of public spending, the work of senior civil servants in the Scottish Government, including their job titles and salaries, as well as government assessment against objectives in order to highlight how well the government is doing in achieving the targets and objectives it creates through the National Performance Framework and Programme for Government. Additionally, the Freedom of Information (Scotland) Act 2002 gives the public the right to ask for information relating to the Scottish Government, as well as other public sectors.

==Budget==

The Scottish Government outlines all spending and tax plans in its annual Scottish budget. In Scotland, the fiscal year runs from 1 April until 30 March, with the budget being presented to the Scottish Parliament by the government usually in November. The accompanying Budget Document is featured with the Budget Bill, which sets out the plans in a legal document. Initially, the Budget Bill is first debated by Scottish Parliament MSPs who conduct votes within the Scottish Parliament on any amendments to the bill before voting on the bill to be made into law. Once passed by parliament and given royal assent by the monarch, the Scottish Government thus becomes legally responsible for implementing the expenditure and taxation plans which were detailed within the budget for the coming fiscal year.

The Budget outlines all plans for how the Scottish Government intends to distribute funds to each government department. The government must provide their reasonings for the allocation of funding, and may also decide on changes in tax rates and bands, changes to welfare benefits. The government also proposes any new taxes, additional welfare benefits and public services in the budget. During the 2019-2020 financial year, approximately 58% of total spending in Scotland was spent by both the Scottish Government and local government, in contrast to 41% of funding spent in Scotland by UK government bodies. The tax powers of the Scottish Government contribute towards a significant amount of the funding within the Scottish budget.

The Scottish Government primarily spends in three main categories – Capital, Resource and Annually Managed Expenditure (AME). AME directly contributes £9 billion to the Scottish budget, and includes all levels of funding that are devolved, however, it also continues to be annually funded by the UK Government on the basis of demand. The areas of budget responsibility in which the Scottish Government has most influence over is resource and capital spending. The resource budget is associated primarily with all day-to-day spending required to provide Scottish public services, whilst the capital budget is primarily for any investment in assets and infrastructure around the country. AME spending is usually required to be spent on areas such as NHS employees and teacher pensions, with that funding being ringfenced, meaning that the Scottish Government has very little influence over spending within AME.

The Scottish Government&#x27;s budget is primarily made up of funding from the following areas:

* Block Grants determined by the Barnett Formula
* Devolved taxes and non-tax income
* Block Grant Adjustments
* Reconciliation payments
* Government borrowing 

The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Local Government is the minister of the Scottish Government responsible for outlining government spending plans in the annual budget.

==Local government== 
Local government in Scotland consists of 32 local authorities which operate independently from the central, devolved Scottish Government. The local authorities, known as councils, provides public services which include education, social care, waste management, libraries and planning in their respective areas. Councils receive their funding from the Scottish Government over a three-year period, however, at times this may be reduced to every one year.

The Cabinet Secretary for Finance and Local Government is the minister within the Scottish Government responsible for relations between the central Scottish Government and local government across Scotland.

==Elections and voting== 

Unlike some other countries, Scotland and the Scottish Parliament do not elect one individual to become the first minister, nor does it directly elect members of the government. Rather, the electorate in Scotland voting in parliamentary elections to the Scottish Parliament by voting for one constituency MSP and a regional MSP. In turn, the party with the largest candidates returned to the Scottish Parliament will be asked by the monarch to form a Scottish Government in their name. From 1999 until 2007, the Scottish Government, then known as the Scottish Executive, was headed by a coalition agreement between the Scottish Labour Party and Scottish Liberal Democrats. Since 2007, the Scottish Government has been run by the Scottish National Party, forming a majority government for the first time in the history of the Scottish Government following the 2011 Scottish Parliament elections. In 2007, Alex Salmond became the first politician from the SNP to lead the Scottish Government. 

In 2024, the Scottish Government passed the Scottish Elections (Representation and Reform) Bill which the government claims will &quot;enhance Scotland’s democratic processes&quot;. One of the major introductions of the bill is the ban on MSPs also serving as an MP or Peer in the House of Commons whilst serving as an incumbent MSP in the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government is directly responsible for all elections to the Scottish Parliament and local government in Scotland. In 2015, the Scottish Elections (Reduction of Voting Age) Bill allowed all 16 and 17 year olds in Scotland to vote, the first time in which they were eligible to legally vote being the 2016 Scottish Parliament election.

==Structure==
=== The Scottish Government ===
====Executive branch====
The Scottish Government consists of a first minister, deputy first minister, nine cabinet secretaries and eighteen other government ministers, collectively for statutory purposes, &quot;the Scottish Ministers&quot;. Cabinet secretaries are senior members of the Scottish Cabinet, whilst the remaining government ministers are junior ministers of the government and act as a deputy to the corresponding cabinet secretary of that department, and support the duties and functions of the cabinet secretary. As junior ministers of the government, ministers do not usually attend the Scottish Cabinet; only the cabinet secretary attends.

Additionally, the Scottish Government is supported by a permanent secretary, two law officers – the Lord Advocate and the Solicitor General for Scotland – who serve as the chief legal advisers to the government, and the chief of staff to the first minister, as well as several other government officials, personal secretaries and advisers to the Scottish Government and the first minister.

====First Minister====

The head of the Scottish Government is the first minister who also serves as the keeper of the Great Seal whilst in office as first minister. The first minister chairs the Scottish Cabinet and is primarily responsible for the formulation, development and presentation of Scottish Government policy. Additional functions of the first minister include promoting and representing Scotland in an official capacity, at home and abroad. In their capacity as Keeper of the Great Seal of Scotland, the first minister is one of only a few individuals permitted to fly the Royal Banner of the Royal Arms of Scotland.

The first minister is nominated by the Scottish Parliament by fellow MSPs, and is formally appointed by the monarch. The first minister appoints members of the Scottish Cabinet and junior ministers of the Scottish Government. As head of the Scottish Government, the first minister is directly accountable to the Scottish Parliament for their actions and the actions of the wider government and cabinet.

The office is held by John Swinney of the Scottish National Party since 7 May 2024.

====Deputy First Minister====

The first minister is supported by the deputy first minister who deputises for the first minister during periods of absence, such as when he is attending overseas visits and international engagements, and may act on the first ministers behalf during First Minister&#x27;s Questions in the Scottish Parliament. Whilst serving as deputy first minister, the office holder holds another cabinet position. Currently, Kate Forbes, the Cabinet Secretary for Economy and Gaelic, serves as the deputy first minister.

====Cabinet====


The Scottish Cabinet collectively takes responsibility for policy coordination within the Scottish Government. It is supported by the Cabinet Secretariat, based at St Andrew&#x27;s House. While the Scottish Parliament is in session, Cabinet meets weekly. Normally meetings are held on Tuesday afternoons in Bute House, the official residence of the First Minister. Members of the Scottish Cabinet receive blue despatch boxes for their use while in office.

There are currently two sub-committees of cabinet:

* Cabinet Sub-Committee on Legislation
* Scottish Government Resilience Room (SGoRR) Cabinet Sub-Committee

====Law officers====


The Lord Advocate is the principal legal adviser for both the Scottish Government and the Crown in Scotland on civil and criminal matters that fall within the devolved powers of the Scottish Parliament. The Lord Advocate provides legal advice to the government on its responsibilities, policies, legislation and the legal implications of any proposals brought forward by the government. The Lord Advocate is responsible for all legal advice which is given to the Scottish Government. 

The Lord Advocate serves as the ministerial head of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, and as such, is the chief public prosecutor for Scotland with all prosecutions on indictment being conducted by the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service in the Lord Advocate&#x27;s name on behalf of the Monarch. The Lord Advocate serves as the head of the systems of prosecutions in Scotland and is responsible for the investigation of all sudden, suspicious, accidental and unexplained deaths which occur within Scotland. 

The officeholder is regarded as one of the Great Officers of State of Scotland, with the current Lord Advocate being Dorothy Bain KC, who was nominated by first minister Nicola Sturgeon in June 2021.

The Solicitor General for Scotland is one of the Law Officers of the Crown, and the deputy of the Lord Advocate, whose duty is to advise the Scottish Government on Scots law. They are also responsible for the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service which together constitute the Criminal Prosecution Service in Scotland. Together with the Lord Advocate, the Solicitor General for Scotland is one of the senior legal advisors to the government in Scotland. Whilst the Solicitor General for Scotland supports the Lord Advocate in their functions, the Solicitor General may also exercise their statutory and common law powers when necessary. The incumbent Solicitor General for Scotland is Ruth Charteris KC.

The Scottish law officers are appointed by the monarch on the recommendation of the incumbent first minister, with the agreement of the Scottish Parliament. They need not be members of the Scottish Parliament.

=== Civil service ===

In addition to the Scottish Ministers, the Scottish Government is supported by a number of officials drawn from the UK Civil Service. They are collectively referred to as the Scottish Administration in the Scotland Act 1998. According to 2012 reports, there are 16,000 civil servants working in core Scottish Government directorates and agencies.

A total of eight director–generals head Scotland&#x27;s civil service department. Each director–general is responsible for a number of directorates and agencies of the Scottish Government and are directly accountable for the legislation proposals, as well as implementing government policy into practice. Public bodies (non–ministerial departments of the Scottish Government) are the responsibility of the senior civil servants as opposed to Scottish Government ministers.

The civil service is a matter reserved to the British parliament at Westminster (rather than devolved to Holyrood): Scottish Government civil servants work within the rules and customs of His Majesty&#x27;s Civil Service, but serve the Scottish Government rather than British government.

====Permanent Secretary====

The Permanent Secretary is the Scottish Government&#x27;s most senior civil servant. They lead the administration&#x27;s strategic board as well as directly support the first minister and cabinet and is the accountable officer with responsibility to ensure that the government&#x27;s money and resources are used effectively and properly. The current permanent secretary is John-Paul Marks, who succeeded Leslie Evans in January 2022.

The Permanent Secretary is a member of the UK Civil Service, and therefore takes part in the UK-wide Permanent Secretaries Management Group under the Cabinet Secretary who performs a number of similar functions in relation to the UK Government. The Scottish Government&#x27;s Permanent Secretary is responsible to the Scottish Ministers in terms of policy.

==== Strategic Board ====
The strategic board is composed of the permanent secretary, the seven directors-general, two chief advisers (scientific and economic) and four non-executive directors. The board is responsible for providing support to the government through the permanent secretary, and is the executive of the Scottish civil service.

==== Directorates ====

The Scottish Government is divided into 55 directorates which execute government policy in specified areas. Unlike in the British government, senior ministers do not lead government departments and have no direct role in the operation of the directorates. The directorates are grouped together into eight &quot;Directorates General&quot;, each run by a senior civil servant who is titled a &quot;Director-General&quot;. As of February 2024, there are eight Directorates General, and supporting these directorates are a variety of other corporate service teams and professional groups.

The Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service serves as an independent prosecution service in Scotland, and is a ministerial department of the Scottish Government. It is headed by the Lord Advocate, who is, along with the procurators fiscal, responsible for prosecution under Scots law.

==== Executive Agencies ====

To deliver its work, there are 10 executive agencies established by ministers as part of government departments, or as departments in their own right, to carry out a discrete area of work. These include, for example, the Scottish Prison Service and Transport Scotland. Executive agencies are staffed by civil servants.

There are two non-ministerial departments that form part of the Scottish administration, and therefore the devolved administration, but answer directly to the Scottish Parliament rather than to ministers: these are the General Register Office for Scotland and the Office of the Scottish Charity Regulator.

==== Public Bodies ====

The Scottish Government is also responsible for a large number of non-departmental public bodies (NDPBs). These include executive NDPBs (e.g. Scottish Enterprise); advisory NDPBs (e.g. the Scottish Law Commission); tribunals (e.g. the Children&#x27;s Panel and Additional Support Needs Tribunals for Scotland); and nationalised industries (e.g. Scottish Water). These are staffed by public servants, rather than civil servants.

The Scottish Government is also responsible for some other public bodies that are not classed as non-departmental public bodies, such as NHS Boards, visiting committees for Scottish penal establishments, and HM Chief Inspector of Constabulary for Scotland.

== Offices ==
The headquarters building of the Scottish Government is St Andrew&#x27;s House, which is located on Calton Hill in Edinburgh. Some other government directorates are based at Victoria Quay and Saughton House in Edinburgh, and Atlantic Quay in Glasgow. The head offices of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service and the Lord Advocate&#x27;s Chambers are at Chambers Street in central Edinburgh.

There are numerous other Edinburgh properties occupied by the Scottish Government. Both the Scottish Fiscal Commission and the Scottish Human Rights Commission are based in the old Governor&#x27;s House on the site of the former Calton Gaol, next door to St. Andrew&#x27;s House on Regent Road. Other offices are scattered around central Edinburgh, including Bute House on Charlotte Square, the official residence of the first minister.

All Ministers and officials have access to Scotland House at Victoria Embankment in London, when necessary. Dover House on Whitehall is now used by the Scotland Office and the devolved Scottish Ministers no longer use it.

The Scottish Government also operates local offices and specialist facilities around Scotland, for example those used by Rural Payments &amp; Services and Marine Scotland.

==International network==
The Scottish Government has a European Union representative office, located at Rond-Point Robert Schuman in Brussels, Belgium, which forms a part of the United Kingdom Permanent Representation to the European Union. The Scottish Government also maintains offices within the British Embassy in Washington, D.C., as well as the British Embassy in Berlin and has accredited representatives within the British Embassy in Beijing.

Scotland has a network of eight international offices across the world located in:

* Beijing (Scottish Government Beijing Office, British Embassy)
* Berlin (Scottish Government Berlin Office)
* Brussels (Scotland House Brussels)
* Copenhagen (Scottish Government Copenhagen Office)
* Dublin (Scottish Government Dublin Office, British Embassy)
* Ottawa (Scottish Government Ottawa Office, British High Commission)
* Paris (Scottish Government Office, British Embassy)
* Washington DC (Scottish Government Washington DC Office, British Embassy)

==Responsibilities==


The responsibilities of the Scottish Ministers broadly follow those of the Scottish Parliament provided for in the Scotland Act 1998 and subsequent UK legislation. Where pre-devolution legislation of the UK Parliament provided that certain functions could be performed by UK Government ministers, these functions were transferred to the Scottish Ministers if they were within the legislative competence of the Scottish Parliament. The Scottish Government&#x27;s main areas for responsibility in the country include education, health and social care, Scots law, policing and justice, emergency services including the fire and ambulance services, local government, taxation, housing, rural affairs, home affairs, tourism, sport, culture, parliamentary elections to the Scottish Parliament and local government, the crown estate, some social security powers and rail franchising, amongst a considerable amount of others. 

The 1998 Act also provided for orders to be made allowing Scottish Ministers to exercise powers of UK Government ministers in areas that remain reserved to the Parliament of the United Kingdom. Equally the Act allows for the Scottish Ministers to transfer functions to the UK Government ministers, or for particular &quot;agency arrangements&quot;. This executive devolution means that the powers of the Scottish Ministers and the Scottish Parliament are not identical.

The members of the Scottish government have substantial influence over legislation in Scotland, putting forward the majority of bills that are successful in becoming Acts of the Scottish Parliament.

<text>In Canadian folklore, the Ogopogo is a lake monster said to inhabit Okanagan Lake in British Columbia, Canada. Some scholars have charted the entity&#x27;s development from First Nations folklore and widespread water monster folklore motifs. The Ogopogo now plays a role in the commercial symbolism and media representation of the region.

==Background==

Okanagan Lake is the largest of five inter-connected freshwater fjord lakes in the Okanagan Valley in British Columbia. Named after the Syilx Okanagan Nation that have lived in the valley since time immemorial, it was created when melting glaciers flooded a valley 10,000 years ago. It stretches for and has a maximum depth of and an average depth of . Okanagan has frozen over during eight winters in the last 110 years.

The lake monster has been mostly described as being a serpentine creature with smooth dark skin with a large body thicker than a telephone pole and being up to in length. The monster has said to move at incredible speeds, coiling its body in vertical undulations, and propelling itself with a powerful tail. Many have compared the creature as being strikingly similar to the cryptid Cadborosaurus, or the extinct Basilosaurus. 

==Etymology==
According to historian Mark M. Orkin, the creature received its colonial name &quot;on a night in 1924 when the strains of an English music-hall song were first heard in the city of Vernon, British Columbia&quot;. Orkin cites the following lines from the song:
:His mother was an earwig,
:His father was a whale;
:A little bit of head
:And hardly any tail—
:And Ogopogo was his name.
Orkin, however, notes that &quot;A somewhat different form of the song appeared in the Vancouver &quot;Province&quot; in 1912, August 24, 1926. According to the &quot;DC&quot; the name was first applied in 1912.&quot; Additionally, the creature may sometimes be referred to by the pet name &quot;Oggy&quot;. Smaller creatures may be referred to as &quot;Ogopups&quot;.

==History==
===Native origins===

According to Ben Radford, the Ogopogo is &quot;more closely tied to native myths than is any other lake monster.&quot; The Secwepemc and Syilx natives regarded the Ogopogo, which they called the Naitaka, as &quot;an evil supernatural entity with great power and ill intent.&quot; The word &quot;n&#x27;ha-a-itk&quot; has various translations, such as &quot;water-demon&quot;, &quot;water god&quot;, or &quot;sacred creature of the water&quot;. In native lore, Naitaka demanded a live sacrifice for safe crossing of the lake. For hundreds of years, First Nations would sacrifice small animals before entering the water. Oral traditions often described visiting chief Timbasket, who rejected the required sacrifice, denying the existence of the demon. Upon entering the lake on a canoe with his family, Naitaka &quot;whipped up the surface of the lake with his long tail&quot; and the canoe and its occupants were sucked to the bottom of the lake. The Naitaka was often described as using its tail to create fierce storms to drown victims. In 1855, settler John MacDougal claimed that his horses were sucked down into the water, and nearly his canoe before he cut the line.

According to Pat Raphael of the Westbank First Nation, a member nation of the larger Okanagan Nation Alliance, the demonic view of Naitaka came about through miscommunication between Canada&#x27;s early European settlers and the Syilx/Okanagan people. To the Syilx, it&#x27;s n ̓x̌ax̌aitkʷ (n-ha-ha-it-koo), a sacred spirit of the lake that protects the valley. The spirit was said to dwell in caves under Rattlesnake Island (a.k.a. Monster Island) or adjacent to Squally Point.

==Alleged sightings==

Susan Allison&#x27;s 1872 sighting was the first detailed Ogopogo account from a white settler. She was the first non-native person to live in the region, establishing relations with the native peoples.

While driving on Highway 97 in 1968, Art Folden noticed something moving in the lake. He pulled off the road and filmed what he claimed to be footage of the alleged creature, showing a large wake moving across the water. Folden estimated that the Ogopogo was offshore. A computer analysis of the footage concluded it was a solid, three-dimensional object. Folden noticed &quot;something large and lifelike&quot; out in the distance on the calm water and pulled out his home movie camera to capture the object. A 2005 investigation conducted by Benjamin Radford with Joe Nickell and John Kirk for the National Geographic Channel television show &quot;Is It Real?&quot;, utilized surveyor boats to find the actual distance of the alleged creature from the shore. They found that it was much closer to shore than originally thought, resulting in a reduction of actual size and speed. They concluded that it was likely a real animal, but its size had been greatly overestimated and that it was probably a water fowl, otter, or beaver too far away to be identified.

In the 1980s, a local tourism agency offered a cash reward for a proven sighting of the beast. Greenpeace announced that the beast must be filmed and not captured: the Ogopogo was listed as an endangered species.

In 1980, around 50 tourists watched an alleged Ogopogo for about 45 minutes off a beach at Kelowna. Larry Thal, a tourist from Vancouver, captured 10 seconds of the sighting on 8 mm film. Some skeptics have suggested that this footage captured only a pair of otters.

In 1989, John Kirk reportedly saw an animal which was long and consisted of &quot;five sleek jet-black humps&quot; with a lashing tail. He believed it to be traveling at around per hour. 

Another sighting occurred in 1989, in an area of log booms near Bear Creek. Ken Chaplin and his 78 year old father Clem staked out the area with a video camera. Chaplin caught what he described as a slim, serpent-like creature measuring up to in length swimming approximately from their canoe. The creature slapped its tail before diving, with force Chaplin described as being enough to &quot;have killed a man if it had hit him.&quot; Chaplin returned to the location with his daughter a few days later and sighted the same creature again. These sightings were cataloged in magazines and newspapers, and appeared in an episode of &quot;Unsolved Mysteries&quot;. However, after analysis by local biologists, Robert Lincoln stated that the size of the animal had been overestimated. Lincoln concluded it was a beaver by the behavior and shape of the animal. Chris Bull, who ran the local fishing department, would later state it was possibly meant to grab attention from the community.

On July 24, 1992, Paul Demara videotaped &quot;something or some things&quot; that were &quot;traveling just below the surface of the water at a fairly good speed,&quot; which was estimated to have been . In the footage, a boat towing a water skier suddenly appears in frame and the skier falls into the water near the object. Within several minutes, DeMara made two other videotapes, each showing what appeared to be multiple animals in the water. Benjamin Radford suggested that the creature was only several otters. In 2005, FBI video specialist Grant Fredricks concluded that the object &quot;was very consistent with debris from a fallen tree in the water,&quot; noting that it &quot;very slowly bobs up and down.&quot; He also pointed out that the alleged creature did not react to the water skier, and the skier did not seem alarmed.

In 2000, a Japanese expedition caught a 40 foot sonar image of an object about 7 meters below the point near Rattlesnake Island. Several underwater caves were also discovered off of the island as well. A following expedition in 2001 resulted in inconclusive sonar readings of a large object, and another in 2006 discovered more caves at much greater depths.

In August 2008, a local photographer named Sean Viloria and his girlfriend Jessica Weagers were sitting by the lakeshore at Peachland when Weagers noticed a disturbance in the water. Viloria snapped one photograph, but his camera died and he wasn&#x27;t able to capture any more. Viloria did not publicize this photo, but described a creature having black hump-like ridges. Eight days later, south of the original sighting, Viloria had pulled his car over to look at the Highway 97 widening project when Weagers spotted another disturbance. Viloria snapped 11 photographs of the unknown object as it surfaced near a boat. Viloria has only shown 3-4 of these photographs to the public. One of them shows a tail or neck-like object surfacing the water, while the others show the back and head of the creature. Viloria estimated the creature as being long, judging by the size of the boat in the background. The photos were examined by many local experts. Chris Bull concluded it didn&#x27;t look like any known animal of the lake. A biologist noted the black/red texture was possibly a different creature or pollution. Members of the show &quot;MonsterQuest&quot; examined the photographs and found no evidence of tampering, as featured in the 2009 episode &quot;Lake Demons&quot;. This broadcast marked the first appearance of the photos on television. Viloria also sculpted a small statue of Ogopogo, which resembles a plesiosaur.

In 2009 an expedition was led by Ogopogo enthusiast Bill Steciuk which consisted of thermal imaging by helicopter, a zodiac chase boat, and a dive team to investigate various caves reported near Rattlesnake Island and Squally Point. The expedition started near the break of dawn where immediately the Chase Boat encountered a cluster of bird activity North of Rattlesnake Island hinting something large was preying below the surface. The thermal imaging helicopter found large heat trails near the surface offshore of Squally Point. Ray Snitynsky who took the thermal images analyzed the object that made the trails ranged from 40-50ft in length. A dive expedition led to the divers recovering a decomposed snake like carcass off an underwater ledge. Unfortunately, a DNA analysis revealed the carcass was a Kokanee salmon that deteriorated to the point it was unidentifiable. The following day, diver Craig Smiley was dropped into the lake near Rattlesnake Island, and hydroacoustic baiting via underwater recordings by Bill Steciuk were used to lure in the creature. When the sound frequency increased, Smiley&#x27;s signal was temporarily lost after sediment was stirred around him supposedly triggering an animal. Smiley also discovered large sinkholes on the lake floor with some up to 5 meters long. This expedition was broadcast on the show Monster Quest in the episode &quot;Lake Demons&quot;.

In 2011, a cell phone video captured two dark shapes in the water. A suggested explanation is that the video shows two logs. Radford analyzed the video for Discovery News and concluded that &quot;the video quality is poor and the camera is shaky, but a closer look at the 30-second video reveals that, instead of one long object, there are actually two shorter ones, and they seem to be floating next to each other at slightly different angles. There are no humps, nor head, nor form; only two long, darkish, more or less straight forms that appear to be a few dozen feet long. In short, they look a lot like floating logs, which would not be surprising since Okanagan Lake has tens of thousands of logs harvested by the timber industry floating just under the lake&#x27;s surface.&quot;

Three sightings were reported in September 2018, one of which described a giant snake approximately long.

In June 2024, there was a reported sighting which described a long snake in the water.

==Explanations==

According to skeptical author Benjamin Radford, contemporary sightings of Ogopogo were most likely misidentifications of water fowl, otter, or beaver, adding, &quot;[the First Nations stories] were not referring to a literal lake monster like Ogopogo, but instead to a legendary water spirit. Though the supernatural N&#x27;ha-a-itk of the Okanagan Valley Indians are long gone, a decidedly less fearsome — and more biological — beast, whose exact form is a matter of debate, has replaced it.&quot;. Joe Nickel and Benjamin Radford propose an origin in claims of &quot;sightings&quot; in wildlife in the region. Otters often swim in a row and their motion can often be mistaken for one continuous serpent. Radford pointed to John Kirk&#x27;s 1989 sighting as likely being a group of otters.

Sturgeon are often mistaken as lake monsters, but their existence in Okanagan is unclear. There is currently an unclaimed $10,000 reward for concrete evidence of sturgeon in Okanagan.

Benjamin Radford has pointed to waterspouts as a likely source of inspiration for First Nation myths. Waterspouts are fairly common on Okanagan Lake, often forming when air temperatures drop and the lake still has a relatively warm water temperature.

==Appearances in other media==

In Season 3, Episode 22 of &quot;The X-Files&quot;, Agent Mulder mentions the Ogopogo in Lake Okanagan to Agent Scully as an example of recognized lake creatures. 

The Ogopogo is referenced in the English language translation of the Super Nintendo game &quot;Final Fantasy IV&quot;, lending its name to a superboss in the game&#x27;s final dungeon. The creature manifests as a more deadly incarnation of the summoned monster Leviathan, and uses a water attack named Deluge.

The animated series &quot;The Venture Bros.&quot; references the Ogopogo in the episode &quot;Return to Malice&quot;. Number 21, a henchman of the series&#x27; antagonist and a prominent secondary character, claims the creature is real, clarifying that it is a plesiosaur, and derides Champ and Nessie as hoaxes.

Lake Okanagan and the Ogopogo feature prominently in the plot of &quot;Ogopogo!&quot;, an episode of &quot;Mike Tyson Mysteries&quot;.

The Yu-Gi-Oh! trading card game features a set of monsters based on cryptids from around the world. Among them is a version of the Ogopogo, with an appearance based on its commonly-accepted features.

<text>The Woolworth Building is a residential building and early skyscraper at 233 Broadway in the Tribeca neighborhood of Lower Manhattan in New York City, United States. Designed by Cass Gilbert, it was the tallest building in the world from 1913 to 1929, and it remains one of the nation&#x27;s 100 tallest buildings .

The Woolworth Building is bounded by Broadway and City Hall Park to its east, Park Place to its north, and Barclay Street to its south. It consists of a 30-story base topped by a 30-story tower. Its facade is mostly clad with architectural terracotta, though the lower portions are limestone, and it features thousands of windows. The ornate lobby contains various sculptures, mosaics, and architectural touches. The structure was designed with several amenities and attractions, including a now-closed observatory on the 57th floor and a private swimming pool in the basement.

F. W. Woolworth, the founder of a brand of popular five-and-ten-cent stores, conceived the skyscraper as a headquarters for his company. Woolworth planned the skyscraper jointly with the Irving Trust, which also agreed to use the structure as its headquarters. The Woolworth Building had originally been planned as a 12- to 16-story commercial building but underwent several revisions during its planning process. Its final height was not decided upon until January 1911. Construction started in 1910 and was completed two years later. The building officially opened on April 24, 1913.

The Woolworth Building has undergone several changes throughout its history. The facade was cleaned in 1932, and the building received an extensive renovation between 1977 and 1981. The Irving National Exchange Bank moved its headquarters to 1 Wall Street in 1931, but the Woolworth Company (later Venator Group) continued to own the Woolworth Building for most of the 20th century. The structure was sold to the Witkoff Group in 1998. The top 30 floors were sold to a developer in 2012 and converted into residences. Office and commercial tenants use the rest of the building. The Woolworth Building has been a National Historic Landmark since 1966, and a New York City designated landmark since 1983.

==Architecture==
Cass Gilbert designed the Woolworth Building in the neo-Gothic style. The building resembles European Gothic cathedrals; Reverend S. Parkes Cadman dubbed it &quot;The Cathedral of Commerce&quot; in a booklet published in 1916. F. W. Woolworth, who had devised the idea for the Woolworth Building, had proposed using the Victoria Tower as a model for the building; he reportedly also admired the design of Palace of Westminster. Gilbert, by contrast, disliked the comparison to religious imagery. The architect ultimately used 15th- and 16th-century Gothic ornament on the Woolworth Building, along with a complementary color scheme. Though the building&#x27;s steel frame was uncommon to neo-Gothic structures, its facade emphasizes vertical design elements, similarly to other neo-Gothic buildings.

The Woolworth Building was designed to be high but was eventually raised to . Several different height measurements have been cited over the years, but the building rises about above the lowest point of the site. The Woolworth Building was 60 stories tall when completed in 1913, though this consisted of 53 usable floors topped by several mechanical floors. The building&#x27;s ceiling heights, ranging from , make it the equivalent of an 80-story building. It remained the tallest building in the world until 40 Wall Street and the Chrysler Building, both in New York City, were constructed in 1929–1930. The building is assigned its own ZIP Code, 10279; it was one of 41 buildings in Manhattan that had their own ZIP Codes .

=== Form ===
The building&#x27;s tower, flush with the main frontage on Broadway, joins an office block base with a narrow interior court for light. The base occupies the entire lot between Park Place to the north, Broadway to the east, and Barclay Street to the south. The site measures wide on Broadway and wide on both Park Place and Barclay Street. The base contains two &quot;wings&quot; extending westward, one each on the Park Place and Barclay Street frontages, which form a rough U-shape when combined with the Broadway frontage. This ensured that all offices had outside views. The U-shaped base is approximately 30 stories tall. All four elevations of the base are decorated, since the building has frontage on all sides.

The tower rises an additional 30 stories above the eastern side of the base, abutting Broadway. Above the 30th floor are setbacks on the north and south elevations. There are additional setbacks along the north, south, and west elevations on the 45th and 50th floors. The 30th through 45th floors measure ; the 46th through 50th floors, ; and the 51st through 53rd floors, . The tower has a square plan below the 50th-story setback and an octagonal plan above. Though the structure is physically 60 stories tall, the 53rd floor is the top floor that can be occupied. Above the 53rd floor, the tower tapers into a pyramidal roof.

=== Facade ===
The lowest four stories are clad in limestone. Above that, the exterior of the Woolworth Building was cast in limestone-colored, glazed architectural terracotta panels. F. W. Woolworth initially wanted to clad the skyscraper in granite, while Gilbert wanted to use limestone. The decision to use terracotta for the facade was based on both aesthetic and functional concerns. Terracotta was not only fireproof but also, in Gilbert&#x27;s mind, a purely ornamental addition clarifying the Woolworth Building&#x27;s steel construction. Each panel was of a slightly different color, creating a polychrome effect. The facade appeared to have a uniform tone, but the upper floors were actually darker and more dense. Behind the terracotta panels were brick walls; the terracotta pieces are attached to the brick walls by metal rods and hangers.

The Atlantic Terra Cotta Company provided the original terracotta cladding. The panels were manufactured in shades of blue, green, sienna, and rose. The terracotta panels were partially vitrified, allowing them to bear large loads. Gilbert also asked that John Donnelly and Eliseo V. Ricci create full-size designs based on Atlantic Terra Cotta&#x27;s models. In 1932, Atlantic Terra Cotta carried out a comprehensive cleaning campaign of the Woolworth&#x27;s facade to remove blackening caused by the city&#x27;s soot and pollution. The Ehrenkrantz Group restored the building&#x27;s facade between 1977 and 1981. During the renovation, much of the terracotta was replaced with concrete and Gothic ornament was removed.

The building has several thousand windows: the exact number is disputed, but various sources state that the Woolworth Building has 2,843, 4,400, or 5,000 windows. Windows were included for lighting and comfort; because the Woolworth Building was built before air conditioning became common, every office is within of a window. Most of the windows are the same size, and each story is the same height. Some of the Woolworth Building&#x27;s windows are set within arch-shaped openings. Most of the building&#x27;s spandrels, or triangles between the top corners of the window and the top of the arch, have golden Gothic tracery against a bright blue backdrop. On the 25th, 39th, and 40th stories, the spandrels consist of iconography found in the royal coat of arms of the United Kingdom. Gold-on-blue tracery is also found on the 26th, 27th, and 42nd floors.

==== Base ====
On the part of the base facing Broadway, as well as the tower above it, there are three bays; the left and right bays have two windows per floor, while the center bay has three windows. The elevations facing Park Place and Barclay Street each have six bays with two windows per floor. The base, on its lowest four stories, is divided into three-story-high entrance and exit bays, each of which has a one-story attic above it. There are nine entrances in total.

The main entrance on Broadway is a three-story Tudor arch, surrounded on either side by two bays: one narrower than the main arch, the other wider. The five bays form a triumphal arch overhung by a balcony and stone motifs of Gothic design. The intrados of the arch contains 23 niches. The topmost niche depicts an owl; the lowest niches on both sides depict tree trunks; and the other twenty niches depict animated figures. The spandrel above the left side of the arch depicts Mercury, classical god of commerce, while that above the right side depicts Ceres, classical goddess of agriculture. Above all of this is an ogee arch with more niches, as well as two carvings of owls hovering above a &quot;W&quot; monogram. There are salamanders within niches on either side of the main entrance. Inside the triumphal arch, there is a smaller arch with a revolving door and a Tudor window; it is flanked by standard doors and framed with decorations. There is a pelican above this smaller arch.

Decorated revolving doors are also located at the northern and southern entrances, at Park Place and Barclay Street respectively. The Park Place and Barclay Street entrances are nearly identical, except for the arrangement of the storefronts. Both entrances are located on the eastern sides of their respective elevations, lining up with the tower above them, and contain a wide arch flanked by two narrower arches. The three entrances feed into the arcaded lobby. The building&#x27;s Park Place entrance contained a stair to the New York City Subway&#x27;s Park Place station, served by the , inside the westernmost bay of the building entrance.

The facade contains vertical piers, which protrude diagonally. There are six such piers on the Broadway elevation. In addition, horizontal belt courses run above the 4th, 9th, 14th, 19th, and 24th stories. The 25th and 26th stories, above the topmost belt course, are separated by dark-bronze spandrels. The 27th floor contains a canopy of projecting terracotta ogee arches. These decorative features make the tower section &quot;appear to merge with the atmosphere&quot;, as architectural writer Donald Reynolds described it. Above the 28th floor, a two-story-tall copper roof with complex tracery in the Gothic style tops the canopies. The 29th and 30th stories of the north and south wings are of similar depth to the six narrow bays on the Park Place and Barclay Street elevations but contain five bays. A small tower with three bays caps these wings.

==== Tower section ====
The 30th through 45th floors contain three bays on each elevation; the side bays contain two windows, while the center bay contains three windows. The 46th through 53rd floors also have three bays on each elevation, but the side bays only contain one window. At the 45th- and 50th-story setbacks, there are turrets at each corner of the tower. The northeast corner turret concealed a smokestack.

There is a pyramidal roof above the 53rd floor, as well as four ornamental tourelles at the four corners of the tower. The roof was originally gilt but is now green. The pyramidal roof, as well as the smaller roofs below, used of gold leaf. The main roof is interspersed with small dormers, which contain windows into the maintenance levels inside. The pyramidal roof is topped by another pyramid with an octagonal base and tall pointed-arch windows. In turn, the octagonal pyramid is capped by a spire. The three layers of pyramids are about , or five stories tall. An observation deck was located at the 55th floor, about above ground level. The deck was octagonal in plan, measuring across, was accessed by a glass-walled elevator. It was patronized by an estimated 300,000 visitors per year but was closed as a security measure in 1941 after the Pearl Harbor attack.

Strongly articulated piers, which carry right to the pyramidal cap without intermediate cornices, give the building its upward thrust. This was influenced by Aus&#x27;s belief that, &quot;From an engineering point of view, no structure is beautiful where the lines of strength are not apparent.&quot; The copper roof is connected to the Woolworth Building&#x27;s steel superstructure, which serves to ground the roof electrically. The Gothic detailing concentrated at the highly visible crown is over-scaled, and the building&#x27;s silhouette could be made out from several miles away. Gilbert&#x27;s choice of the Gothic style was described as &quot;an expression of the verticality of the tower form&quot;, and as Gilbert himself later wrote, the style was &quot;light, graceful, delicate and flame-like&quot;. Gilbert considered several proposals for exterior lighting, including four powerful searchlights atop nearby buildings and a constantly rotating lamp at the apex of the Woolworth Building&#x27;s roof. Ultimately, the builders decided to erect nitrogen lamps and reflectors above the 31st floor, and have the intensity of the lighting increase with height.

=== Structural features ===

==== Substructure ====
In contrast to other parts of Manhattan, the bedrock beneath the site is relatively deep, descending to between on average. The site also has a high water table, which is as shallow as beneath ground level. Due to the geology of the area, the building is supported on either 66 or 69 massive caissons that descend to the bedrock. The caissons range in depth from .

To give the structure a sturdy foundation, the builders used metal tubes in diameter filled with concrete. These tubes were driven into the ground with a pneumatic caisson process to anchor the foundations to the bedrock. Because the slope of the bedrock was so sharp, steps had to be carved into the rock before the caissons could be sunk into the ground. The caissons were both round and rectangular, with the rectangular caissons located mainly on the southern and western lot lines. The caissons are irregularly distributed across the site, being more densely concentrated at the northeastern corner. This is because the building was originally planned to occupy a smaller site at the corner of Broadway and Park Place; when the site was enlarged, the caissons that had already been installed were left in place. The two basement levels, descending , are constructed of reinforced concrete.

==== Superstructure ====
Whereas many earlier buildings had been constructed with load-bearing walls, which by necessity were extremely thick, the Woolworth Building&#x27;s steel superstructure was relatively thin, which enabled Gilbert to maximize the building&#x27;s interior area. Engineers Gunvald Aus and Kort Berle designed the steel frame. Each column carries a load of , supporting the building&#x27;s overall weight of . Where the columns of the superstructure did not match up with the caissons, they were cantilevered above on plate girders between two adjoining caissons. These girders are extremely large; one such girder measures deep, wide, and long.

For the wind bracing, the entire Woolworth Building was considered as a vertical cantilever, and correspondingly large girders and columns were used in the construction. Continuous portal bracing was used between the 1st and 28th floors, except in the interior columns, where triangular bracing was used. The portal braces on the building&#x27;s exterior direct crosswinds downward toward the ground, rather than into the building. Interconnecting trusses were placed at five-floor intervals between the tower and the wings; these, as well as the side and court walls, provided the bracing for the wings. Directly above each of the tower&#x27;s setbacks, the outer walls are supported by girders, as the columns beneath them are offset. Above the 28th floor, knee braces and column-girder connections were used; hollow-tile floors were installed because it would have taken too long to set the concrete floors, especially during cold weather.

=== Interior ===
Upon completion, the Woolworth Building contained seven water systems—one each for the power plant, the hot-water plant, the fire-protection system, the communal restrooms, the offices with restrooms, the basement swimming pool, and the basement restaurant. There are water tanks on the 14th, 27th, 28th, 50th, and 53rd floors. Although the water is obtained from the New York City water supply system, much of it is filtered and reused. A dedicated water system, separate from the city&#x27;s, was proposed during construction, but workers abandoned the plan after unsuccessfully digging into Manhattan&#x27;s bedrock.

The Woolworth Building was the first structure to have its own power plant with four Corliss steam engine generators totaling a capacity of ; the plant could support 50,000 people. The building also had a dedicated heating plant with six boilers with a capacity of . The boilers were fed from subterranean coal bunkers capable of holding over 2,000 tons of anthracite coal.

==== Lobby ====
The ornate, cruciform lobby, known as the &quot;arcade&quot;, was characterized by the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) as &quot;one of the most spectacular of the early 20th century in New York City&quot;. It consists of two perpendicular, double-height passageways with barrel-vaulted ceilings. One passageway runs between the arcade&#x27;s west wing at the Woolworth Building&#x27;s &quot;staircase hall&quot; and the east wing at Broadway. The other runs between the north wing at Park Place and the south wing at Barclay Street. A mezzanine crosses the arcade&#x27;s north and south wings. Where the passageways intersect, there is a domed ceiling. The dome contains pendentives that may have been patterned after those of the Mausoleum of Galla Placidia. The walls of this intersection vault are laid out in an octagonal shape, with mailboxes at the four intercardinal directions.

Veined marble from the island of Skyros in Greece covers the lobby. Edward F. Caldwell &amp; Co. provided the interior lights for the lobby and hallways. Patterned glass mosaics that contain blue, green, and gold tiling with red accents decorate the ceilings. There are other Gothic-style decorations in the lobby, including on the cornice and the bronze fittings. Twelve plaster brackets, which carry grotesques depicting major figures in the building&#x27;s construction, are placed where the arcade and the mezzanine intersect. These ornaments include Gilbert with a model of the building, Aus taking a girder&#x27;s measurements, and Woolworth holding nickels and dimes. Two ceiling murals by C. Paul Jennewein, titled &quot;Labor&quot; and &quot;Commerce&quot;, are located above the mezzanine where it crosses the south and north wings, respectively.

The staircase hall is a two-story room located to the west of the arcade. It consists of the ground level, which contains former storefronts, as well as a mezzanine level above it. The ground floor originally contained 18 storefronts. A marble staircase leads westward from the arcade to a mezzanine, where the entrance to the Irving National Exchange Bank office was formerly located. The mezzanine contains a stained-glass skylight surrounded by the names of several nations. The skylight contains the dates 1879 and 1913, which respectively signify the years of the Woolworth Company&#x27;s founding and the building&#x27;s opening. The skylight is also surrounded by sculpted grotesques, which depict merchandising activities in the five-and-dime industry. Heinigke and Brown manufactured the leaded glass of the mezzanine ceiling, as well as the barrel vault of the lobby.

There is a smaller space west of the staircase hall with a one-story-high ceiling. This room contains a coffered ceiling with a blue-green background. The crossbeams contain Roman portrait heads, while the cornice contains generic sculpted grotesques. The lobby also contains a set of German chimes designed by Harry Yerkes.

==== Basement ====
The basement of the Woolworth Building contains an unused bank vault, restaurant, and barbershop. The bank vault was initially intended to be used for safe-deposit boxes, though it was used by the Irving National Exchange Bank in practice. In 1931, Irving moved some $3 billion of deposits to a vault in its new headquarters at 1 Wall Street, and the Woolworth Building&#x27;s vault was converted into a storage area for maintenance workers. There is also a basement storage room, known as the &quot;bone yard&quot;, which contains replacement terracotta decorations for the facade.

The basement also contains closed entrances to two New York City Subway stations. There was an entrance to the Park Place station directly adjacent to the building&#x27;s north elevation, served by the . This entrance was closed after the September 11 attacks in 2001. Another entrance led to the City Hall station one block north, now served by the , but this was closed in 1982 because of concerns over crime. The area in front of the former entrances was used as a bike-storage area by the 2010s.

A private pool, originally intended for F. W. Woolworth, exists in the basement. Proposed as early as 1910, the pool measured and had a marble perimeter. The pool was later drained but was restored in the mid-2010s as part of the conversion of the Woolworth Building&#x27;s upper floors into residential units.

==== Offices ====
At the time of construction, the Woolworth Building had over 2,000 offices. Each office had ceilings ranging from high. Gilbert had designed the interior to maximize the amount of usable office space, and correspondingly, minimize the amount of space taken up by the elevator shafts. The usable-space consideration affected the placement of the columns in the wings, as the columns in the main tower were positioned around the elevator shafts and facade piers. Each of the lowest 30 stories had 31 offices, of which ten faced the light court, eight faced Park Place, eight faced Barclay Street, and five faced Broadway. Above the 30th-story setback, each story had 14 offices. For reasons that are unknown, floor numbers 42, 48, and 52 are skipped.

Woolworth&#x27;s private office on the 24th floor, revetted in green marble in the French Empire style, is preserved in its original condition. His office included a mahogany desk with a leather top measuring . That desk contained a hidden console with four buttons to request various members of his staff. The marble columns in the office are capped by gilded Corinthian capitals. Woolworth&#x27;s reception room contained objects that were inspired by a visit to the Château de Compiègne shortly after the building opened. These included a bronze bust of Napoleon, a set of French Empire-style lamps with gold figures, and an inkwell with a depiction of Napoleon on horseback. The walls of the office contained portraits of Napoleon, and gold-and-scarlet chairs were arranged around the room. At some point, Woolworth replaced the portrait of Napoleon with a portrait of himself.

==== Elevators ====
The Woolworth Building contains a system of high-speed elevators capable of traveling or per minute. The Otis Elevator Company supplied the units, which consisted of express elevators that ran nonstop between selected floors, as well as local elevators that stopped at every floor between a certain range. There were 26 Otis electric elevators with gearless traction, as well as an electric-drum shuttle elevator within the tower once construction was complete. Of these, 24 were passenger elevators, which were arranged around cruciform elevator lobbies on each floor. Two freight elevators and two emergency staircases were placed at the rear of the building.

The elevators are accessed from bays in the eastern and western walls of the arcade. The walls are both divided by two bays with round arches, and there are four elevators on each wall. The elevator doors in the lobby were designed by Tiffany Studios. The patterns on the doors have been described as &quot;arabesque tracery patterns in etched steel set off against a gold-plated background&quot;.

==History==
===Planning===
The entrepreneur F. W. Woolworth immigrated to the U.S. in 1886 and became successful because of his &quot;Five-and-Dime&quot; (5- and 10-cent stores). He began planning a new headquarters for the F. W. Woolworth Company in 1910. Around the same time, Woolworth&#x27;s friend Lewis Pierson was having difficulty getting shareholder approval for the merger of his Irving National Bank and the rival New York Exchange Bank. Woolworth, who was looking for funding, mentioned his plans for the building at a lunch with Pierson. Woolworth offered to acquire shares in New York Exchange Bank and vote in favor of the merger if Pierson agreed to move the combined banks&#x27; headquarters to the F. W. Woolworth Company&#x27;s new headquarters.

Having received a commitment from the banks, Woolworth acquired a corner site on Broadway and Park Place in Lower Manhattan, opposite City Hall. Woolworth briefly considered purchasing a plot at West Broadway and Reade Street several blocks north. He decided against it because of the prestige that a Broadway address provided; despite its name, West Broadway is a separate street from Broadway.

Woolworth and the Irving National Exchange Bank then set up the Broadway–Park Place Company to construct and finance the proposed structure. Initially, the bank was supposed to purchase the company&#x27;s stock gradually until it owned the entire company, and thus, the Woolworth Building. Irving would be able to manage the 18 floors on a 25-year lease. In addition, Irving would be able to control two of the Broadway–Park Place Company&#x27;s seats, while Woolworth would control the other three seats and serve as that firm&#x27;s president. While negotiations to create the Broadway-Park Place Company were ongoing, Woolworth and his real estate agent Edward J. Hogan purchased several parcels from the Trenor Luther Park estate and other owners. The entire footprint of the current building, a rectangular lot, had been acquired by April 15, 1910, at a total cost of $1.65 million (about $ in ).

==== Original designs ====
Woolworth commissioned Cass Gilbert to design the new building. There are few print documents that indicate early correspondence between Woolworth and Gilbert, and news articles as late as March 1910 mentioned that no architect had been chosen. Gilbert later mentioned that he had received the commission for the Woolworth Building after getting a phone call from Woolworth one day. The architect had recently finished designing the nearby Broadway–Chambers Building and 90 West Street, whose architecture Woolworth admired. Woolworth wanted his new structure to be of similar design to the Palace of Westminster in London, which was designed in the Gothic style. At the time, Gilbert was well known for constructing modern skyscrapers with historicizing design elements.

Gilbert was originally retained to design a standard 12- to 16-story commercial building for Woolworth, who later said he &quot;had no desire to erect a monument that would cause posterity to remember me&quot;. By 1910, the plans called for a building with a 20-story base and 10-story upper section. Woolworth then wanted to surpass the nearby New York World Building, which sat on the other side of City Hall Park and stood 20 stories and . A drawing by Thomas R. Johnson, dated April 22, 1910, shows a 30-story building rising from the site. Because of the change in plans, the organization of the Broadway-Park Place Company was rearranged. Woolworth would be the major investor in the Broadway–Park Place Company, contributing $1 million, and the bank would contribute the other $500,000. The Irving Bank would take up a 25-year lease for the ground floor, fourth floor, and basement.

By September 1910, Gilbert had designed an even taller structure, with a 40-story tower on Park Place adjacent to a shorter 25-story annex, yielding a -tall building. The next month, Gilbert&#x27;s design had evolved into a 45-story building roughly the height of the nearby Singer Building. This proposal called for a neo-Gothic structure with a 26-story base, topped by a square tower rising another 19 stories. After the latest design, Woolworth wrote to Gilbert in November 1910 and asked for the building&#x27;s height to be increased to , which was taller than the Singer Building, Lower Manhattan&#x27;s tallest building. Woolworth was inspired by his travels in Europe, where he would constantly be asked about the Singer Building. He decided that housing his company in an even taller building would provide invaluable advertising for the F. W. Woolworth Company and make it renowned worldwide. This design, unveiled to the public the same month, was a 45-story tower rising , sitting on a lot by . Referring to the revised plans, Woolworth said, &quot;I do not want a mere building. I want something that will be an ornament to the city.&quot; He later said that he wanted visitors to brag that they had visited the world&#x27;s tallest building. Louis J. Horowitz, president of the building&#x27;s main contractor Thompson-Starrett Company, said of Woolworth, &quot;Beyond a doubt his ego was a thing of extraordinary size; whoever tried to find a reason for his tall building and did not take that fact into account would reach a false conclusion.&quot;

==== Plans for world&#x27;s tallest building ====
Even after the revised height was unveiled, Woolworth still yearned to make the building even taller as it was now close to the height of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower, then the tallest building in New York City and the world. On December 20, 1910, Woolworth sent a team of surveyors to measure the Metropolitan Life Tower&#x27;s height and come up with a precise measurement, so he could make his skyscraper taller. He then ordered Gilbert to revise the building&#x27;s design to reach , despite ongoing worries over whether the additional height would be worth the increased cost. In order to fit the larger base that a taller tower necessitated, Woolworth bought the remainder of the frontage on Broadway between Park Place and Barclay Street. He also purchased two lots to the west, one on Park Place and one on Barclay Street; these lots would not be developed, but would retain their low-rise buildings and preserve the proposed tower&#x27;s views. Such a tall building would produce the largest income of any building globally.

On January 1, 1911, the &quot;New York Times&quot; reported Woolworth was planning a building at a cost of $5 million. That month, Woolworth and Hogan acquired the final site for the project. In total, the site had cost $4.5 million (about $ in ) and measured on Broadway, on Barclay Street, and on Park Place. In a &quot;New York Times&quot; article two days later, Woolworth said that his building would rise to its tip. These plans called for a 30-story base and 25-story square tower above it. The 750-foot height was the absolute minimum that Woolworth would agree to, but Gilbert increased the height to so the architectural proportions would fit. Renderings by illustrator Hughson Hawley, completed in April 1911, are the first official materials that reflect this final height.

Gilbert had to reconcile both Woolworth&#x27;s and Pierson&#x27;s strict requirements for the design of the structure. The architect&#x27;s notes describe late-night conversations that he had with both men. The current design of the lobby, with its arcade, reflected these conflicting pressures. Sometimes, Gilbert also faced practical conundrums, such as Woolworth&#x27;s requirement that there be &quot;many windows so divided that all of the offices should be well lighted&quot;, and so that tenants could erect partitions to fit their needs. Gilbert wrote this &quot;naturally prevented any broad wall space&quot;. Woolworth commented at length on each of the dozens of drawings that Gilbert drew up. Woolworth and Gilbert sometimes clashed during the design process, especially because of the constantly changing designs and the architect&#x27;s fees. Nevertheless, Gilbert commended Woolworth&#x27;s devotion to the details and beauty of the building&#x27;s design, as well as the entrepreneur&#x27;s enthusiasm for the project. Such was the scale of the building that, for several years, Gilbert&#x27;s sense of scale was &quot;destroyed [...] because of the unprecedented attuning of detail to, for these days, such an excessive height&quot;.

===Construction===
In September 1910, wrecking crews demolished the five-and-six-story structures which previously occupied the site. Construction officially began on November 4, 1910, with excavation by the Foundation Company, using a contract negotiated personally by Frank Woolworth. The start of construction instantly raised the site&#x27;s value from $2.25 million to $3.2 million. The contract of over $1 million was described as the largest contract for foundation construction ever awarded in the world. It took months for Woolworth to decide upon the general construction company. George A. Fuller&#x27;s Fuller Company was well experienced and had practically invented skyscraper construction, but Louis Horowitz&#x27;s Thompson-Starrett Company was local to New York; despite being newer, Horowitz had worked for Fuller before, and thus had a similar knowledge base. On April 20, 1911, Thompson-Starrett won the contract with a guaranteed construction price of $4,308,500 for the building&#x27;s frame and structural elements. The company was paid $300,000 for their oversight and management work, despite Woolworth&#x27;s attempts to get the company to do the job for free due to the prestige of the project.

The first potential tenants began applying for space in the building in May 1911, before work had even started. On June 12, 1911, the Atlantic Terra Cotta Company received a $250,000 contract to manufacture the terracotta. The next month, Donnelly and Ricci received the $11,500 contract for the terracotta work and some of the interior design work. Gilbert requested Atlantic Terra Cotta use an office next to his while they drew several hundred designs. The construction process involved hundreds of workers, and daily wages ranged from $1.50 for laborers () to $4.50 for skilled workers (). By August 1911, the building&#x27;s foundations were completed ahead of the target date of September 15; construction of the skyscraper&#x27;s steel frame began August 15. The steel beams and girders used in the framework weighed so much that, to prevent the streets from caving in, a group of surveyors examined them on the route along which the beams would be transported. The American Bridge Company provided steel for the building from their foundries in Philadelphia and Pittsburgh; manufacturing took over 45 weeks.

The first above-ground steel had been erected by October 1911, and installation of the building&#x27;s terracotta began on February 1, 1912. The building rose at the rate of stories a week and the steelworkers set a speed record for assembling 1,153 tons of steel in six consecutive eight-hour days. By February 18, 1912, work on the steel frame had reached the building&#x27;s 18th floor. By April 6, 1912, the steel frame had reached the top of the base at the 30th floor and work then began on constructing the tower of the Woolworth Building. Steel reached the 47th floor by May 30 and the official topping out ceremony took place two weeks ahead of schedule on July 1, 1912, as the last rivet was driven into the summit of the tower. After the building was topped out, Gilbert initially told Woolworth that he thought the building was about tall, but Woolworth&#x27;s own engineers found the true height to be . The skyscraper was substantially completed by the end of 1912. The final estimated construction cost was (), up from the initial estimates of for the shorter versions of the skyscraper (). This was divided into $5 million for the land, $1 million for the foundation, and $7 million for the structure. Woolworth provided $5 million, while investors provided the remainder, and financing was completed by August 1911.

=== Woolworth operation ===

==== Opening and 1910s ====
The building opened on April 24, 1913. Woolworth held a grand dinner on the building&#x27;s 27th floor for over 900 guests, and at exactly 7:30 p.m. EST, President Woodrow Wilson pushed a button in Washington, D.C., to turn on the building&#x27;s lights. Attendees included: Francis Hopkinson Smith, who served as toastmaster; author William Winter; businessmen Patrick Francis Murphy and Charles M. Schwab; Rhode Island Governor Aram J. Pothier; Judge Thomas C. T. Crain; US Senator from Arkansas Joseph Taylor Robinson; Ecuadorian minister Gonzalo Córdova; New York Supreme Court Justices Charles L. Guy and Edward Everett McCall; Commissioner of Education of the State of New York John Huston Finley; Collector of the Port of New York William Loeb Jr.; naval architect Lewis Nixon; Rear Admiral Charles Dwight Sigsbee; Commissioner of Docks and Ferries of the City of New York R. A. C. Smith; Colonel William Conant Church; United States Representative from New York Herman A. Metz; New York City Police Commissioner Rhinelander Waldo; banker James Speyer; former Lieutenant Governor of New York Timothy L. Woodruff; writer Robert Sterling Yard; Admiral Albert Gleaves; and reportedly between 69 and 80 congressmen who arrived via a special train from Washington, DC. Additional congratulations were sent via letter from former President William Howard Taft, Governor of New Jersey James Fairman Fielder and United States Secretary of the Navy Josephus Daniels.

The building was declared ready for occupancy on May 1, 1913, and Woolworth began renting the offices at a minimum rate of . To attract tenants, Woolworth hired architecture critic Montgomery Schuyler to write a 56-page brochure outlining the building&#x27;s features. Schuyler later described the Woolworth Building as the &quot;noblest offspring&quot; of buildings erected with steel skeletons. On completion, the Woolworth Building topped the record set by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company Tower as the world&#x27;s tallest building, a distinction it held until 1929. Woolworth had purchased all of the Broadway-Park Place Company&#x27;s shares from the Irving National Exchange Bank by May 1914; his company held no ownership stake in the building. The bank, whose only involvement in the building was now as a tenant, agreed to lease the entire second story for $100,000 a year. The building contained offices for as many as 14,000 employees. By the end of 1914, the building was 70% occupied and generating over $1.3 million a year in rents for the F. W. Woolworth Company.

==== 1920s to 1960s ====
During World War I, only one of the Woolworth Building&#x27;s then-14 elevators was turned on, and many lighting fixtures in hallways and offices were turned off. This resulted in about a 70% energy reduction compared to peacetime requirements. The building had more than a thousand tenants by the 1920s, who generally occupied suites of one or two rooms. These tenants reportedly collectively employed over 12,000 people in the building. In 1920, after F. W. Woolworth died, his heirs obtained a $3 million mortgage loan on the Woolworth Building from Prudential Life Insurance Company to pay off $8 million in inheritance tax. By this point, the building was worth $10 million and grossed $1.55 million per year in rent income. The Broadway-Park Place Corporation agreed to sell the building to Woolco Realty Co., a subsidiary of the F. W. Woolworth Company, in January 1924 at an assessed valuation of $11.25 million (about $ in ). The company paid $4 million in cash and obtained a five-year, $11 million mortgage from Prudential Life Insurance Company at an annual interest rate of 5.5%. The sale was finalized in April 1924, after which F. W. Woolworth&#x27;s heirs no longer had any stake in the building.

In 1927, the building&#x27;s pinnacle was painted green, and the observation tower was re-gilded for over $25,000 (about $ in ). The Atlantic Terra Cotta Company cleaned the Woolworth Building&#x27;s facade in 1932. Prudential extended its $3.7 million mortgage on the building by ten years in 1939, and the observation deck was closed after the bombing of Pearl Harbor in 1941. Ten of the building&#x27;s 24 elevators were temporarily disabled in 1944 because of a shortage of coal. The next year, the building&#x27;s owners replaced the elevators and closed off the building above the 54th story.

By 1953, a new chilled water air conditioning system had been installed, bringing individual room temperature control to a third of the building. The old car-switch-control elevators had been replaced with a new automatic dispatching systems and new elevator cars. The structure was still profitable by then, although it was now only the sixth-tallest building, and tourists no longer frequented the Woolworth Building. The building&#x27;s terracotta facade deteriorated easily, and, by 1962, repairs to the terracotta tiles were occurring year-round. The Woolworth Company had considered selling the building as early as the 1960s, though the planned sale never happened.

==== Restoration and landmark status ====
The National Park Service designated the Woolworth Building as a National Historic Landmark in 1966. The New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission (LPC) considered giving the Woolworth Building official city-landmark status in 1970. The F. W. Woolworth Company called the landmark law &quot;onerous&quot; since it would restrict the company from making modifications to many aspects of the building. The commission ultimately declined to give the Woolworth Building a designated-landmark status because of the company&#x27;s opposition to such a measure, as well as the increased costs and scrutiny. The lobby was cleaned in 1974.

The F. W. Woolworth Company commissioned an appraisal of the building&#x27;s facade in 1975 and found serious deterioration in the building&#x27;s terracotta. Many of the blocks of terracotta had loosened or cracked from the constant thermal expansion and contraction caused by New York&#x27;s climate. The cracks in the facade had let rain in, which caused the steel superstructure to rust. By 1976, the Woolworth Company had placed metal netting around the facade to prevent terracotta pieces from dislodging and hitting pedestrians. The issues with the facade were exacerbated by the fact that very few terracotta manufacturers remained in business, making it difficult for the company to procure replacements. The New York City Industrial and Commercial Incentives Board approved a $8.5 million tax abatement in September 1977, which was to fund a proposed renovation of the Woolworth Building. The Woolworth Company still occupied half the building; its vice president for construction said &quot;we think the building merits the investment&quot;, in part because F. W. Woolworth had used his own wealth to fund the building&#x27;s construction. Much of the remaining space was occupied by lawyers who paid .

The F. W. Woolworth Company began a five-year restoration of the building&#x27;s terracotta and limestone facade, as well as replacement of all the building&#x27;s windows, in 1977. Initially, the company had considered replacing the entire terracotta facade with concrete; this was canceled due to its high cost and potential backlash from preservationists. The renovation, carried out by Turner Construction to plans by the New York architectural firm Ehrenkrantz Group, involved the replacement of roughly one-fifth of the building&#x27;s terracotta. Since there were so few remaining terracotta manufacturers, so Woolworth&#x27;s replaced 26,000 of the tiles with concrete lookalikes; many of those tiles had to be custom-cut. The concrete was coated with a surface that was meant to be replaced every five years, like the glazing on the terracotta blocks. Similarly, the original copper windows were replaced with aluminum frames which allowed them to be opened, whereas the originals were sealed in place. The company also removed some decorative flying buttresses near the tower&#x27;s crown and refaced four tourelles in aluminum because of damage.

The building&#x27;s renovation was completed without fanfare in 1982. The estimated cost of the project had risen from $8 million to over $22 million. Much of the renovation was financed through the city government&#x27;s tax break, which had increased to $11.4 million. The LPC again considered the Woolworth Building for landmark designation in early 1982, shortly after the renovation was completed. Upon the request of the building&#x27;s lawyers, the LPC postponed a public hearing for the proposed landmark designation to April 1982. That year, the building&#x27;s entrance to the City Hall subway station was closed because of fears over crime. The LPC granted landmark protection to the building&#x27;s facade and the interior of its lobby in April 1983. The Woolworth Company (later Venator Group) continued to own the building for a decade and a half. After struggling financially for years, and with no need for a trophy office building, Venator Group began discussing a sale of the building in 1996. To raise capital for its other operations, Venator formally placed the Woolworth Building for sale in April 1998.

===Witkoff Group ownership===

==== Sale and initial plan ====
Venator Group agreed to sell the building in June 1998 to Steve Witkoff&#x27;s Witkoff Group and Lehman Brothers for $155 million (about $ in ). Before the sale was finalized in December 1998, Witkoff renegotiated the purchase price to $137.5 million (about $ in ), citing a declining debt market. Venator shrunk its space in the building from eight floors to four; this was a sharp contrast to the 25 floors the company had occupied just before the sale. Witkoff also agreed to license the Woolworth name and invest $30 million in renovating the exterior and interior of the building. After purchasing the building, the Witkoff Group rebranded it in an attempt to attract entertainment and technology companies. In April 2000, the Venator Group officially moved their headquarters to 112 West 34th Street, and Witkoff indicated that he would sell the upper half of the building as residential condominiums. That October, the company proposed a two-story addition to the 29th-floor setbacks on the north and south elevations of the tower, to be designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, who were also leading the renovation of the building. The LPC denied the proposal.

The company unveiled an ambitious plan in November 2000 that would have converted the top 27 floors of the building into 75 condominiums, including a five-story penthouse. The plan would have included a new residential lobby on Park Place, a 100-space garage, a 75-seat underground screening room, and a spa in the basement. The developers planned to spend $60 to $70 million on the conversion and to be ready for occupancy by August 2002. The LPC opposed the plan because it would have required exterior changes to the roof. The commission eventually approved a modified version of the plan. Following the September 11 attacks, and the subsequent collapse of the nearby World Trade Center, the status of the plan was in doubt, and the proposal was later canceled.

==== Security increases and new plan ====
Prior to the September 11 attacks, the World Trade Center was often photographed in such a way that the Woolworth Building could be seen between the complex&#x27;s twin towers. After the attacks occurred only a few blocks away, the Woolworth Building was without electricity, water and telephone service for a few weeks; its windows were broken, and falling rubble damaged a top turret. Increased post-attack security restricted access to most of the ornate lobby, previously a tourist attraction. &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter David W. Dunlap wrote in 2006 that a security guard had asked him to leave within twelve seconds of entering the Woolworth Building. However, there was renewed interest in restoring public access to the Woolworth Building during planning for its centennial celebrations. The lobby reopened to public tours in 2014, when Woolworth Tours started accommodating groups for 30- to 90-minute tours. The tours were part of a partnership between Cass Gilbert&#x27;s great-granddaughter, Helen Post Curry, and Witkoff&#x27;s vice president for development, Roy A. Suskin.

In June 2003, Credit Suisse First Boston provided $201 million in financing for the property spread across a $125.4 million senior loan, a $49.6 million junior interest and a $26 million mezzanine loan. In April 2005, Bank of America provided a $250 million (about $ in ) commercial mortgage-backed security interest-only loan on the office portion of the building. At the time, the building was 96% occupied, appraised at $320 million, and generated almost $18 million a year in net operating income.

By 2007, the concrete blocks on the Woolworth Building&#x27;s facade had deteriorated because of neglect. A lack of regular re-surfacing had led to water and dirt absorption, which stained the concrete blocks. Though terracotta&#x27;s popularity had increased since the 1970s, Suskin had declined to say whether the facade would be modified, if at all. Around the same time, Witkoff planned to partner with Rubin Schron to create an &quot;office club&quot; on the top 25 floors building to attract high-end tenants like hedge funds and private equity firms. The plan would have restored the 58th floor observatory as a private amenity for &quot;office club&quot; tenants, in addition to amenities like a private dining room, meeting rooms, and a new dedicated lobby. The partners planned to complete the project by the end of 2008, but the financial crisis of 2007–2008 derailed the plans, leaving the top floors gutted and vacant.

===Residential use===

==== Sale and conversion ====
On July 31, 2012, an investment group led by New York developer Alchemy Properties which included Adam Neumann and Joel Schreiber, bought the top 30 floors of the skyscraper for $68 million (about $ in ) from the Witkoff Group and Cammeby&#x27;s International. The firm planned to renovate the space into 33 luxury apartments and convert the penthouse into a five-level living space. The lower 28 floors are still owned by the Witkoff Group and Cammeby&#x27;s International, who planned to maintain them as office space. The project was expected to cost approximately $150 million including the $68 million purchase price. The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the changes to the building in October 2013.

When the sale was first announced in 2012, the developers expected the building&#x27;s conversion to be complete by 2015. However, construction took longer than expected. Workers could not attach a construction hoist to the building&#x27;s landmarked facade without damaging it, and they were prohibited from using the elevators because of the active office tenants on the lower floors and the regular public tours of the landmarked lobby. The renovation included many restorations and changes to the building&#x27;s interior. Two of the elevator shafts only went to the 29th floor, allowing extra floor space for the residents above. A new private lobby was also built for residents and the coffered ceiling from F.W. Woolworth&#x27;s personal 40th floor office was relocated to the entryway. Thierry Despont and Eve Robinson designed the building&#x27;s new interiors with Miele appliances and custom cabinetry. Each unit also received space in a wine cellar, along with access to the restored private pool in the basement. The 29th floor was converted to an amenity floor named the &quot;Gilbert Lounge&quot; after the structure&#x27;s architect, while the 30th floor hosts a fitness facility.

In August 2014, the New York Attorney General&#x27;s office approved Alchemy&#x27;s plan to sell 34 condos at the newly branded Woolworth Tower Residences for a combined total of $443.7 million. After a soft launch in late 2014, units at the building were officially listed for sale in mid-2015. Alchemy initially intended to leverage an in-house sales staff and hired a director from Corcoran Sunshine to lead the effort. However, the new sales director left at the end of 2015 for Extell Development Company amid rumors of slow sales at the project. Following his departure, the company hired Sotheby&#x27;s International Realty to market the units. The building&#x27;s penthouse unit, dubbed &quot;The Pinnacle&quot;, was listed at $110 million, the highest asking price ever for an apartment in downtown Manhattan. If it had sold at that price, the unit would have surpassed the record $50.9 million penthouse at Ralph Thomas Walker&#x27;s Walker Tower, and even the $100.5 million record price for a Manhattan penthouse set by Michael Dell at Extell&#x27;s One57 in 2014; the penthouse ultimately sold for $30 million in 2023.

==== Post-conversion ====
In 2015, The Blackstone Group provided a $320 million loan on the office portion of the building to refinance the maturing Bank of America loan from 2005. United Overseas Bank of Singapore provided a $220 million (about $ in ) construction loan for the residential conversion in June 2016. Due to delays, the conversion was expected to be completed by February or March 2019, about six and a half years after Alchemy bought the property. By February 2019, only three of the building&#x27;s 31 condos had been sold, since the developers had refused to discount prices, despite a glut of new luxury apartments in New York City. The still-vacant penthouse&#x27;s asking price was reduced to $79 million. By 2021, Alchemy had sold 22 condominiums to tenants such as entrepreneur Rudra Pandey.

==Tenants==
===Early tenants===
On the building&#x27;s completion, the F. W. Woolworth Company occupied only one and a half floors. However, as the owner, the Woolworth Company profited from renting space out to others. The Woolworth Building was almost always fully occupied because of its central location in Lower Manhattan, as well as its direct connections to two subway stations. The Irving Trust Company occupied the first four floors when the building opened. It had a large banking room on the second floor accessible directly from a grand staircase in the lobby, vaults in the basement, offices on the third-floor mezzanine, and a boardroom on the fourth floor. In 1931, the company relocated their general, out-of-town, and foreign offices from the Woolworth Building after building their own headquarters at 1 Wall Street. Columbia Records was one of the Woolworth Building&#x27;s tenants on opening day and housed a recording studio in the skyscraper. In 1917, Columbia made what are considered the first jazz recordings, by the Original Dixieland Jass Band, in this studio.

Shortly after the building opened, several railroad companies rented space. The Union Pacific Railroad and Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad occupied the ground floor retail space with ticket offices. Other railroad companies that leased office space included the Alton Railroad, on the 13th floor; the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific Railroad (Milwaukee Road), on the 14th floor; the Canadian Pacific Railway, Great Northern Railway, and New York Central Railroad on the 15th floor; the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad, on the 17th floor; the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company, on the 19th floor; the Canadian Northern Railway; the Los Angeles and Salt Lake Railroad; the Pennsylvania Railroad; the Atlanta, Birmingham and Atlantic Railway; the Kansas City Southern Railway; and the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad.

The inventor Nikola Tesla also occupied an office in the Woolworth Building beginning in 1914; he was evicted after a year because he could not pay his rent. &quot;Scientific American&quot; moved into the building in 1915 before departing for Midtown Manhattan in 1926. The Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company of America was present at the building&#x27;s opening, occupying the southern half of the 18th floor after signing a lease in January 1913. Other early tenants included the American Hardware Manufacturers Association headquarters, the American Association of Foreign Language Newspapers, Colt&#x27;s Manufacturing Company, Remington Arms, Simmons-Boardman Publishing headquarters, the Taft-Peirce Manufacturing Company, and the Hudson Motor Car Company.

===Later 20th century===
By the 1920s, the building also hosted Newport News Shipbuilding and Nestlé. In the 1930s, prosecutor Thomas E. Dewey maintained his offices in the building while investigating racketeering and organized crime in Manhattan. His office took up the entire fourteenth floor and was heavily guarded. The regional headquarters of the National Labor Relations Board also moved into the building in 1937, shortly after its founding in 1935. During World War II, the Kellex Corporation, part of the Manhattan Project to develop nuclear weapons, was based here.

During the early 1960s, public relations expert Howard J. Rubenstein opened an office in the building. In 1975, the city signed a lease for state judge Jacob D. Fuchsberg&#x27;s offices in the Woolworth Building.

===Higher education===
The structure has a long association with higher education, housing a number of Fordham University schools in the early 20th century. In 1916, Fordham created &quot;Fordham Downtown&quot; at the Woolworth Building by moving the School of Sociology and Social Service and the School of Law to the building. The Fordham University Graduate School was founded on the building&#x27;s 28th floor in the same year and a new Teachers&#x27; College quickly followed on the seventh floor. In September 1920, the Business School was also established on the seventh floor, originally as the School of Accounting. By 1929, the school&#x27;s combined programs at the Woolworth Building had over 3,000 enrolled students. Between 1916 and 1943 the building was also home at various times to the Fordham College (Manhattan Division), a summer school, and the short-lived School of Irish Studies. In 1943, the Graduate School relocated to Keating Hall at Fordham&#x27;s Rose Hill campus in Fordham, Bronx, and the rest of the schools moved to nearby 302 Broadway because of reduced attendance because of World War II.

The New York University School of Professional Studies&#x27; Center for Global Affairs leased on the second, third, and fourth floors in 2002 from defunct dot-com startup FrontLine Capital Group. The American Institute of Graphic Arts also moved its headquarters to the Woolworth Building.

===21st-century tenants===
By the early 2000s, the Woolworth Building was home to numerous technology tenants. Digital advertising firm Xceed occupied across four floors as its headquarters, Organic, Inc. took , and advertising agency Fallon Worldwide used two floors. Xceed terminated its lease in April 2001 during the midst of the Dot-com bubble collapse in order to move to smaller offices in the Starrett–Lehigh Building. One month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission&#x27;s (SEC&#x27;s) Northeast Regional Office at 7 World Trade Center was destroyed in the September 11 attacks, the commission&#x27;s 334 employees moved into across five floors of the Woolworth Building. The SEC left for a larger space in Brookfield Place in early 2005. The General Services Administration took over the commission&#x27;s space on November 1, 2005 and used it as offices for approximately 200 staff of the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and U.S. Probation and Pretrial Services System. Following the completion of renovations at the historic Thurgood Marshall United States Courthouse in late October 2017, both offices moved into newly vacated space in the nearby Daniel Patrick Moynihan United States Courthouse.

The New York City Police Department pension fund signed a lease for on the 19th and 25th floors in April 2002. The pension fund renewed their lease for another 20-year term in October 2010. Starbucks opened a location on the ground floor in the spring of 2003. In 2006, Levitz Furniture moved its headquarters to the 23rd floor from Woodbury, Long Island, after declaring bankruptcy a second time. The design firm Control Group Inc. leased an entire floor in 2006.

, the Lawrence Group handles leasing at the Woolworth Building. In May 2013, SHoP Architects moved the company&#x27;s headquarters to the entire 11th floor, occupying of space. In February 2016, the New York City Law Department leased the entire fifth floor for the Department&#x27;s tort office.

===Reception and design influence===
Before construction, Woolworth hired New York photographer Irving Underhill to document the building&#x27;s construction. These photographs were distributed to Woolworth&#x27;s stores nationwide to generate enthusiasm for the project. During construction, Underhill, Wurts Brothers, and Tebbs-Hymans each took photographs to document the structure&#x27;s progression. These photos were often taken from close-up views, or from far away to provide contrast against the surrounding structures. They were part of a media promotion for the Woolworth Building. Both contemporary and modern figures criticized the photos as &quot;&#x27;standard solutions&#x27; at best and &#x27;architectural eye candy&#x27; at worst&quot;.

Later critics praised the building. Amei Wallach of &quot;Newsday&quot; wrote in 1978 that the building resembled &quot;a giant cathedral absurdly stretched in a gigantic fun mirror&quot; and that the lobby &quot;certainly looks like a farmboy&#x27;s dream of glory&quot;. A writer for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; wrote in 1984 that the lobby&#x27;s lighting, ceiling mosaic, and gold-leaf decorations &quot;combine for a church-like atmosphere&quot;, yet the grotesques provided a &quot;touch of irreverence&quot;. Richard Berenholtz wrote in his 1988 book &quot;Manhattan Architecture&quot; that, at the Woolworth Building, Gilbert &quot;succeeded in uniting the respected traditions of architecture and decoration with modern technology&quot;. In a 2001 book about Cass Gilbert, Mary N. Woods wrote that &quot;the rich and varied afterlife of the Woolworth Building ... enhances [Gilbert&#x27;s] accomplishment&quot;. Dirk Stichweh described the building in 2005 as being &quot;the Mozart of skyscrapers&quot;. In 2007, the building ranked 44th among 150 buildings in the AIA&#x27;s &quot;List of America&#x27;s Favorite Architecture&quot;.

In recognition of Gilbert&#x27;s role as the building&#x27;s architect, the Society of Arts and Sciences gave Gilbert its gold medal in 1930, calling it an &quot;epochal landmark in the history of architecture&quot;. On the 40th anniversary of the building&#x27;s opening in 1953, one news source called the building &quot;a substantial middle-aged lady, with a good income, unconcern over years—and lots of friends&quot;. A one-third-scale replica of the Woolworth Building, the Lincoln American Tower in Memphis, Tennessee, was also built in 1924.

===Media===

The Woolworth Building has had a large impact in architectural spheres, and has been featured in many works of popular culture, including photographs, prints, films, and literature. One of the earliest films to feature the skyscraper was &quot;Manhatta&quot; (1921), a short documentary film directed by painter Charles Sheeler and photographer Paul Strand. Since then, the building has made cameo appearances in several films, such as the 1929 film &quot;Applause&quot;. It was also the setting of several film climaxes, such as in &quot;Enchanted&quot; (2007), as well as the setting of major organizations, such as in &quot;Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them&quot; (2016). The television show &quot;Ugly Betty&quot; used the Woolworth Building as the &#x27;Meade Publications&#x27; building, a major location in the series, while one of the vacant condominiums was used in filming the TV series &quot;Succession&quot; in 2021. The building has also appeared in literature, such as Langston Hughes&#x27;s 1926 poem &quot;Negro&quot; and the 2007 novel &quot;Peak&quot;.

<doc id="269162" wikidata="Q8049066" url="?curid=269162" title="Yaohan">
<text>or ; ) was a Japanese retail group, founded in 1930 by and his wife . Initially a single shop selling vegetables, it was expanded by their son Kazuo Wada into a major supermarket chain with most retail outlets located in Shizuoka prefecture, south of Tokyo. It was incorporated in 1948 and listed on Tokyo Stock Exchange. The store was far more established and notable outside Japan, due to restrictive laws in Japan that made it difficult to set up new businesses, such that by the time it opened its first store in the Tokyo metropolitan area, the company was already in a state of decline due to accumulated debts from over-expansion.

==Growth==
 During the 1980s and 1990s, the Yaohan group expanded dramatically outside Japan, especially into Hong Kong (since 1984), China (since 1995) and the US. At its peak, it had 450 outlets in 16 countries, including 9 in Hong Kong, as well in Brazil with stores in São Paulo (since 1971) and Sorocaba, San José, Costa Rica, Los Angeles, Vancouver (Yaohan Centre), Honolulu, London, and San Jose, California. Yaohan&#x27;s first North American location, at Fresno, California, was opened in 1979 at Yaohan Plaza.

Its training center was located at Atami.

Typical of large Japanese companies, new employees were required to go through induction training programs that, in the case of Yaohan, had a strong religious emphasis on the principles of Seicho-no-Ie. Employees also had to go through regular seminars on Seicho-no-Ie and were ultimately required to be members of Seicho-no-Ie. This was not without resistance from its employees. Although the company was less strict on seminar attendance and membership for employees of overseas branches, the same resistance persisted.

===Hong Kong===
The first Yaohan store was opened in New Town Plaza, Sha Tin, Hong Kong in 1984. After that, Yaohan store grew quickly in Hong Kong and had opened nine stores, which include Tuen Mun Town Plaza, Whampoa Garden, Yuen Long, Ma On Shan, Tsuen Wan. All the stores were closed in 1997 due to the financial turmoil and the burst of the Japanese economy bubble. Then many stores were replaced by another Japanese department store chain, JUSCO (now called AEON).

Yaohan is one of the listed companies in Hong Kong during 1986 to 1997. It has owned many companies, such as the Wonderful World of Whimsy, Millie, Santa Ana Bakery and some another fast-food restaurant. But many of them were closed later.

===Macau===
Yaohan store was established and opened in 1992 in Macau. It is the first and the only department store in Macau until now. It was renamed as New Yaohan after the bankruptcy of the original company, and the new company is operated by Yaohan International Company Limited.

===Malaysia===
The Malaysian branch of Yaohan operated by Yaohan Malaysia Sdn Bhd was owned by Metroplex Group Sdn Bhd, with the latter owning 36.5% of its shares while Yaohan Group Malaysia is owned by Yaohan of Japan with 22.87% of its shares owned by Metroplex Group.

Yaohan expended to Malaysia in May 1987 with its first store at The Mall in the Chow Kit district of Kuala Lumpur. Yaohan later opened an outlet in Johor Bahru (with Pelangi Berhad) and Penang.

In 1992, Yaohan Malaysia planned to open five more outlets within five years, including one in Sabah, totalling into nine outlets.

By 1997, Yaohan had expanded to six stores including one in East Malaysia:
* The Mall, Chow Kit, Kuala Lumpur
* Plaza OUG (demolished in 2022), Old Klang Road, Kuala Lumpur
* KOMTAR, George Town, Penang
* Centre Point Sabah, Kota Kinabalu, Sabah
* Terminal One, Seremban, Negeri Sembilan
* Sunway Pyramid, Subang Jaya, Selangor

Following the chain&#x27;s bankruptcy in 1997, all stores were replaced by Aktif Lifestyle Corporation Bhd in January 1998 and later Parkson in 2004.

===Singapore===
The Singapore branch of Yaohan was a joint venture of Yaohan Department Store Co, Ltd. and Development Bank of Singapore, Singapore Nomura Merchant Bank, Singmanex Pte Ltd and Tiger Pte Ltd. As of 1974, the branch had 550 staff; expanding to 1400 by 1979. The branch also owned the Yaohan trademark for Singapore, Malaysia and Brunei.

Yaohan had two bakeries: one in Woodlands and in Jurong, opened in April 1980. Its subsidiary, Shin Mei Trading, exports locally made products such as candy, ivory products and garments.

One of the oldest Japanese retailers in Singapore, its first store in 1974 at Plaza Singapura revolutionised the grocery shopping experience in Singapore, and it quickly became a household name. Other stores were also opened in Thomson Plaza (1979), Bukit Timah (1982), Jurong (1983), and Parkway Parade (1983). The Jurong store was closed in 1989, and a new store planned at the IMM Shopping Mall was due to open in 1990. The sixth store was supposed to open in Kovan Shopping Centre in 1993. When the last store to cease operations in 1997 exited Singapore from Thomson Plaza, its staff were visibly moved and some were in tears. Also in operation in Singapore since 1985 was the Yaohan Best chain (a joint venture with Best Denki), specializing in electronics, which first opened in Yaohan&#x27;s store space.

In 1993, Yaohan Singapore was restructured with its retail business moved to Yaohan Department Store Singapore and real estate moving to Exceltech. Its retail business would be listed in 1996.

===Brunei===
Yaohan expanded to Brunei with its first store at Abdul Razak Plaza opened on March 13, 1987. Over 40,000 customers visited the store on its first day of operations. Yaohan Brunei was a joint venture of Yaohan Department Store of Japan and Haji Awang Abdul Hapidz, then-president of Malay Chamber of Commerce and Brunei National Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

===Thailand===
The first Yaohan store was opened in Thailand at Fortune Town, Ratchadaphisek Road, Bangkok in 1991 following by Future Park Bang Khae in 1994. () Withdrew during the year 1997 following financial crisis.

===Indonesia===
In 1992, Yaohan opened its first branch in Indonesia at Plaza Atrium, a shopping center in the Segitiga Senen superblock, Central Jakarta. Opening on 21 August 1992, the 3-storey store was 100% managed and owned by PT Suryaraya Mantaputama (co-owned by Suhartoyo, T.P. Rachmat, Djoko Soedjatmiko and Ali Santoso), being supported with a US$10 million investment from Yaohan International Company Limited, which also licensed branding, distribution, and basic training. After the Plaza Atrium branch, there were plans to open a second branch in Mal Kelapa Gading 2, although it was instead replaced with a Sogo. This outlet closed in early 1995, due to its inconspicuous location being unattractive for its target customers, resulting in rapid loss. It has since been replaced by Matahari, a local department store chain. A few unrelated supermarkets under the name Macan Yaohan also opened since 1985 in Medan, although all locations had since closed in 2015.

==Decline==

When the company faced financial difficulties, it was split into two companies, one in Japan and with the overseas part headquartered in Hong Kong, in a bid to survive. The group was traded on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange as Yaohan International Company Limited until 11 August 1998. Through a combination of the 1997 Asian financial crisis and the stagnation of the Japanese retail market, however, the group declared bankruptcy with 161 billion yen of debts. It was the biggest postwar failure in Japan&#x27;s retail sector at the time. Already at a &quot;finanical dead-end&quot;, the super-market chain asked for protection from creditors under Japan&#x27;s Corporate Rehabilitation Law on 18 September 1997. Many outlets were closed. 

In December 1997, Yaohan in Japan was bought by ÆON Group and changed its name to Maxvalu Tokai; most of the stores in Hong Kong were also overtaken by ÆON and became JUSCO. Other stores in the US were bought by Maruwa, Mitsuwa, and Marukai, the latter two based in Los Angeles. Stores in Canada were bought by The President Group, a Taiwanese company.

A former Yaohan department store in Macau is operating under the trading name New Yaohan (新八佰伴), operated by Yaohan International Company Limited in Hong Kong which is owned by STDM (controlled by Stanley Ho) and no longer has a connection with the Wada family. Yaohan Best has been renamed as Best Denki.

<doc id="269164" wikidata="Q1025339" url="?curid=269164" title="Gulangyu">
<text>Gulangyu, Gulang or Kulangsu is a pedestrian-only island off the coast of Xiamen, Fujian Province in southeastern China. A UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site, the island is about in area, and is reached by an 8-minute ferry ride from downtown Xiamen. Although only about 20,000 people live on the island, Gulangyu is a major domestic tourist destination, attracting more than 10 million visitors per year, and making it one of China&#x27;s most visited tourist attractions. Gulangyu not only bans cars, but also bicycles. The only vehicles permitted are small electric buggies and electric government service vehicles.

Visitors can reach Gulangyu by ferry from the ferry terminal in Xiamen. Local residents are allowed to use a shorter 5-minute ferry to/from the Lun Du Ferry Terminal. During the day (every 20 minutes, from 7:10 AM to 5:30 PM in Winter and Spring / from 7:10 AM to 6:30 PM in Summer and Autumn), tourists and non-locals take a 20-minute ferry ride from the Dongdu International Cruise Terminal to either San Qiu Tian Terminal or Nei Cuo Ao Terminal in Kulangsu Town. A ticket costs 35 CNY. After 6:00 PM, there is a more convenient ferry from Lundu Terminal 2, which drops off at San Qiu Tian Terminal in Kulangsu Town. That service runs all night, and also costs 35 CNY.

Gulangyu Island is renowned for its beaches, winding lanes and rich architecture. The island is on China&#x27;s list of National Scenic Spots and is classified as a 5A tourist attraction by the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA). It ranks at the top of the list of the ten most scenic areas in the province.

Gulangyu covers an area of 1.91 square kilometres (0.74 sq mi), with a household population of 15,373. Administratively, the island constitutes the Gulangyu Subdistrict, part of Xiamen&#x27;s Siming District.

==History==

===The International Settlement===

For a time, Gulangyu was the only international settlement on Chinese soil apart from the International Settlement at Shanghai.

Soon after Xiamen became a treaty port resulting from China&#x27;s loss in the First Opium War and the Treaty of Nanking in 1842, foreign residents on the island established an informal organization that became formally organized several decades later when its Land Regulations were approved by the government of China (Qing dynasty) in May 1902. Eventually 13 countries, including Great Britain, France, The Netherlands and Japan, were to have extraterritorial privileges there and take part in the Kulangsu Municipal Council that administered the settlement. As with the Shanghai International Settlement, the British played a predominant role in the administration and Sikh policemen from British India were charged with the policing of the Settlement under the Kulangsu Municipal Police. The consulates, churches, hospitals, schools, police stations, etc. built by those foreign communities explain the predominantly Victorian-era style architecture that can still be seen throughout Gulangyu. Japanese occupation of the island began in 1942, and lasted until the end of World War II, when it was returned to China. The Hokkien dialect is spoken on the island, as it is in Xiamen.

===People&#x27;s Republic of China===

After the establishment of the PRC, Gulangyu was a district of Xiamen, one of four in the municipality not located on Xiamen Island until 2003. In May of that year Gulangyu District was absorbed into Siming District, and has since been administered, policed, and adjudicated from Xiamen Island, just across the Lujiang River.

==Attractions==

As a place of residence for Westerners during Xiamen&#x27;s colonial past, Gulangyu is famous for its architecture and for hosting China&#x27;s only piano museum, giving it the nickname of &quot;Piano Island&quot; or &quot;The Town of Pianos&quot; () or &quot;The Island of Music&quot; (). There are over 200 pianos on this island.

The Chinese name also has musical roots, as &quot;鼓浪 Kó͘-lōng&quot; which means &quot;drum waves&quot; so-called because of the sound generated by the ocean waves hitting the reefs. &quot;嶼 sū&quot; means &quot;islet&quot;.

In addition, there is a museum dedicated to Koxinga, Hái-toé Sè-kài () Marine World, a subtropical garden containing plants introduced by overseas Chinese, as well as Xiamen Museum, formerly the Eight Trigrams Tower ().

The island of Gulangyu is a pedestrian-only destination, where the only vehicles on the islands are several fire trucks and electric tourist buggies. The narrow streets on the island, together with the architecture of various styles around the world, give the island a unique appearance. The site is classified as a AAAAA scenic area by the China National Tourism Administration.


Buildings and sights of the former international settlements includes:

* United States Consulate Building by architect Elliott Hazzard
* Kulangsu Catholic Church (Tian Zhu Tang) c. 1917
* Former Office of Great Northern Telegraph Company (Denmark) (Dan Mai Da Bei Dian Bao Gong Si) c. 1871
* Kulangsu Organ Museum (Eight Diagrams Mansion / Bagua Mansion) c. 1907 - designed by John Abraham Otte
* Foreigners&#x27; Football Field (Ren Min Ti Yu Chang) c. 1878
* Former Kulangsu Mixed Court (Hui Shen Gong Tang) c. 1915
* Union Church (Xie He Li Bai Tang) c. 1911
* Christian Cemetery (Fan Zai Mu Yuan)

==Transportation==
Gulangyu is unique in China as a &quot;traffic-free island&quot;. It is connected to the main island of Xiamen by ferry. Neither cars nor bicycles are allowed, unlike Xiamen Island across the river. Recently, electric tourist buggies were introduced. Freight is pulled on wheeled wooden carts up the often steep lanes by strong teams of men.

== Culture ==
The spread of Christianity in 1900s brought western music to the island. Churches and museums were built, and people enjoyed going to music halls to hear performances. Since then, the island&#x27;s local cultural environment mingled with introduced foreign music and art, which is why the Gulangyu cultural scene differs from other parts of China.

== Classical music ==
A number of China&#x27;s most famous classical musicians come from Gulangyu, including the pianist Yin Chengzong, the violist Jing Yang, and the pianist Xu Feiping. Historically, Shu&#x27;an Zhou, Junji Lin, and Zuohuang Chen are other well-known classical musicians from the island. Gulangyu&#x27;s piano ownership per capita ranks the first in nation, and by 2002, Gulangyu Island was given the name of &quot;The Island of Music&quot; by Chinese Musicians&#x27; Association. The piano exhibition halls and museums and overall artistic atmosphere attract many musicians domestically and internationally. The 580-seat Gulangyu Concert Hall is one of Fujian Province&#x27;s most notable acoustic classical music venues.

== Awards ==
In 2005, Gulangyu Island was named the most beautiful district of China by Chinese National Geography magazine.

In May 2007, Xiamen Gulangyu Island was officially accredited as the National 5A Tourist Attractions by the National Tourism Administration of China.

On 8 July 2017, Gulangyu was listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<doc id="269185" wikidata="Q687564" url="?curid=269185" title="Sunni Triangle">
<text>The Sunni Triangle is a densely populated region of Iraq to the north and west of Baghdad inhabited mostly by Sunni Muslim Arabs. The roughly triangular area&#x27;s points are usually said to lie near Baghdad (the southeast point), Ramadi (the southwest point) and Tikrit (the north point). Each side is approximately 125 kilometers (80 miles) long. The area also contains the cities of Samarra, Fallujah, Balad, Hīt, Al-Taji and Al-Karmah.
The area was a center of strong support for Ba&#x27;athist Iraq; from the 1970s on, many government workers, politicians, and military leaders came from the area. Saddam was born just outside Tikrit. After the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, the area became a focus of armed Sunni opposition to Coalition Provisional Authority rule. On December 13, 2003, Saddam Hussein was captured in a raid on the village of Ad-Dawr about south of Tikrit.

The term &quot;Sunni triangle&quot; was used intermittently from the 1970s among academic Iraq specialists, usually to differentiate it from Iraqi Kurdistan in the north and the Shia regions to the south. An early use in mainstream media is a &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; article of September 14, 2002, in which former United Nations weapons inspector Scott Ritter says: &quot;We may be able to generate support for an invasion among some of the Shiites and some of the Kurds, but to get to Baghdad you must penetrate the Sunni Triangle.&quot; However, it didn&#x27;t come into widespread use until a &quot;New York Times&quot; article of June 10, 2003, popularized the term in a report on &quot;a new U.S. effort to quell nascent armed resistance in Sunni Muslim-dominated areas north and west of Baghdad [in an] area known as the &#x27;Sunni triangle&#x27;.&quot; It became commonplace in reports on the US-led Multi-National Force – Iraq&#x27;s efforts to control the region.

The lack of economic diversity within the region is a deterrent to Sunni separatism in Iraq as most of the oil reserves are in Kurdish and Shia regions, and the port cities of Basra and Umm Qasr are far away from the triangle.

The &quot;Sunni Triangle&quot; is distinct from the Triangle of Death, a similarly Sunni area south of Baghdad which saw major combat activity in late 2004.

<doc id="269186" wikidata="Q269871" url="?curid=269186" title="Neofelis">
<text>Neofelis is a genus comprising two extant cat species in Southeast Asia: the clouded leopard (&quot;Neofelis nebulosa&quot;) of mainland Asia, and the Sunda clouded leopard (&quot;Neofelis diardi&quot;) of Sumatra and Borneo.

The scientific name &quot;Neofelis&quot; is a composite of the Greek word &quot;neo-&quot; (νέος) meaning &#x27;young&#x27; and &#x27;new&#x27;, and the Latin word &quot;fēlēs&quot; meaning &#x27;cat&#x27;.

==Taxonomic history==
The generic name &quot;Neofelis&quot; was first proposed by John Edward Gray in 1867 as comprising two species; &quot;Neofelis macrocelis&quot; occurring in the Himalaya, Malacca, and Thailand, and &quot;Neofelis brachyurus&quot; occurring in the former Formosa.
Reginald Innes Pocock recognized the taxonomic classification of &quot;Neofelis&quot; in 1917, but admitted only the single species &quot;Neofelis nebulosa&quot; with several subspecies and &quot;macrocelis&quot; as the type specimen. For almost 90 years, the classification of &quot;Neofelis&quot; as a monotypic genus was widely accepted.
In 2006, &quot;Neofelis diardi&quot; was found to be distinct from its continental relative &quot;Neofelis nebulosa&quot; and classified as a separate species.

== Characteristics ==

Gray described the genus &quot;Neofelis&quot; as having an elongate skull, a broad and rather produced face on the same plane as the forehead, a large and elongate nasal, a moderate orbit, a truncated lower jaw and very long conical upper and lower canine teeth with a sharp cutting hinder edge. This skull has resemblances to that of the fossil &quot;Smilodon&quot;, with very much elongated upper canines. Pocock described the skull of &quot;Neofelis&quot; as recalling in general features that of &quot;Panthera pardus&quot;, especially in the shortness and wide separation of the frontal and malar postorbital processes, relative proportion of mandibular teeth; but differing in the greater posterior width of the nasals, the thicker, more salient inferior edge of the orbit, and the mandible being greatly elevated anteriorly. As a result of this unusual skull anatomy, neofelids have a maximum gape of approximately 90 degrees, the biggest of extant carnivora, a trait shared by the extinct Machairodontinae subfamily.

The Sunda clouded leopard has longer upper canine teeth and a narrower palate between them.

== Distribution and habitat ==
&quot;Neofelis&quot; species range from Nepal and Sikkim eastward to south China and Hainan, southeastward to Myanmar, Annam, the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, Java and Borneo. They are most closely associated with primary evergreen tropical rainforest, but make use of other types of habitat. Sightings have also been made in secondary and logged forest, as well as grassland and scrub. In the Himalayan foothills they have been recorded up to .

=== Distribution of species ===
Between 1821 and 1862, several felids have been described from Southeast Asia that are subordinated under &quot;Neofelis&quot; today:
*&quot;Felis nebulosa&quot; was first described in 1821 by Edward Griffith based on a specimen brought from Guangdong in southern China. Populations range from the Himalayan foothills in Nepal through mainland Southeast Asia into China. 
*&quot;Felis diardi&quot; was first described in 1823 by Georges Cuvier based on a skin and a drawing received from Java. The Sunda clouded leopard is probably restricted to the islands of Sumatra and Borneo. In Java only clouded leopard fossils were found.
*&quot;Leopardus brachyurus&quot; was first described in 1862 by Robert Swinhoe based on two to three skins from Taiwan. Today the Formosan clouded leopard is considered a clouded leopard subspecies &quot;Neofelis nebulosa brachyurus&quot;. It is now considered to be extinct.

== Threats ==
Deforestation is the foremost threat for both &quot;Neofelis&quot; species. They are also threatened by commercial poaching for the wildlife trade. Skins, claws and teeth are offered for decoration and clothing, bones and meat as substitute for tiger in traditional Asian medicines and tonics, and live animals for the pet trade. Few poaching incidents have been documented, but all range states are believed to have some degree of commercial poaching. In recent years, substantial domestic markets existed in Indonesia, Myanmar and Vietnam.

== Conservation ==
Both &quot;Neofelis&quot; species are listed in CITES Appendix I and are protected over most of their range. Hunting is banned in Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Nepal, Taiwan, Thailand, and Vietnam. Hunting regulations apply in Laos.

<text>The term autopoiesis (), one of several current theories of life, refers to a system capable of producing and maintaining itself by creating its own parts.
The term was introduced in the 1972 publication &quot;Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living&quot; by Chilean biologists Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela to define the self-maintaining chemistry of living cells.

The concept has since been applied to the fields of cognition, neurobiology, systems theory, architecture and sociology. Niklas Luhmann briefly introduced the concept of autopoiesis to organizational theory.

==Overview==
In their 1972 book &quot;Autopoiesis and Cognition&quot;, Chilean biologists Maturana and Varela described how they invented the word autopoiesis.
They explained that,
They described the &quot;space defined by an autopoietic system&quot; as &quot;self-contained&quot;, a space that &quot;cannot be described by using dimensions that define another space. When we refer to our interactions with a concrete autopoietic system, however, we project this system on the space of our manipulations and make a description of this projection.&quot;

==Meaning==

Autopoiesis was originally presented as a system description that was said to define and explain the nature of living systems. A canonical example of an autopoietic system is the biological cell. The eukaryotic cell, for example, is made of various biochemical components such as nucleic acids and proteins, and is organized into bounded structures such as the cell nucleus, various organelles, a cell membrane and cytoskeleton. These structures, based on an internal flow of molecules and energy, &quot;produce&quot; the components which, in turn, continue to maintain the organized bounded structure that gives rise to these components.

An autopoietic system is to be contrasted with an allopoietic system, such as a car factory, which uses raw materials (components) to generate a car (an organized structure) which is something &quot;other&quot; than itself (the factory). However, if the system is extended from the factory to include components in the factory&#x27;s &quot;environment&quot;, such as supply chains, plant / equipment, workers, dealerships, customers, contracts, competitors, cars, spare parts, and so on, then as a total viable system it could be considered to be autopoietic.

Of course, cells also require raw materials (nutrients), and produce numerous products -waste products, the extracellular matrix, intracellular messaging molecules, etc.

Autopoiesis in biological systems can be viewed as a network of constraints that work to maintain themselves. This concept has been called organizational closure or constraint closure and is closely related to the study of autocatalytic chemical networks where constraints are reactions required to sustain life.

Though others have often used the term as a synonym for self-organization, Maturana himself stated he would &quot;[n]ever use the notion of self-organization ... Operationally it is impossible. That is, if the organization of a thing changes, the thing changes&quot;. Moreover, an autopoietic system is autonomous and operationally closed, in the sense that there are sufficient processes within it to maintain the whole. Autopoietic systems are &quot;structurally coupled&quot; with their medium, embedded in a dynamic of changes that can be recalled as sensory-motor coupling. This continuous dynamic is considered as a rudimentary form of knowledge or cognition and can be observed throughout life-forms.

An application of the concept of autopoiesis to sociology can be found in Niklas Luhmann&#x27;s Systems Theory, which was subsequently adapted by Bob Jessop in his studies of the capitalist state system. Marjatta Maula adapted the concept of autopoiesis in a business context. The theory of autopoiesis has also been applied in the context of legal systems by not only Niklas Luhmann, but also Gunther Teubner. Patrik Schumacher has applied the term to refer to the &#x27;discursive self-referential making of architecture.&#x27; Varela eventually further applied autopoesis to develop models of mind, brain, and behavior called non-representationalist, enactive, embodied cognitive neuroscience, culminating in neurophenomenology.

In the context of textual studies, Jerome McGann argues that texts are &quot;autopoietic mechanisms operating as self-generating feedback systems that cannot be separated from those who manipulate and use them&quot;. Citing Maturana and Varela, he defines an autopoietic system as &quot;a closed topological space that &#x27;continuously generates and specifies its own organization through its operation as a system of production of its own components, and does this in an endless turnover of components, concluding that &quot;Autopoietic systems are thus distinguished from allopoietic systems, which are Cartesian and which &#x27;have as the product of their functioning something different from themselves. Coding and markup appear allopoietic&quot;, McGann argues, but are generative parts of the system they serve to maintain, and thus language and print or electronic technology are autopoietic systems.

The philosopher Slavoj Žižek, in his discussion of Hegel, argues: 

==Relation to complexity==
Autopoiesis can be defined as the ratio between the complexity of a system and the complexity of its environment.

Autopoiesis has been proposed as a potential mechanism of abiogenesis, by which molecules evolved into more complex cells that could support the development of life.

=== Comparison with other theories of life ===

Autopoiesis is just one of several current theories of life, including the chemoton of Tibor Gánti, the hypercycle of Manfred Eigen and Peter Schuster,

 the (&quot;M,R&quot;) systems of Robert Rosen, and the autocatalytic sets of Stuart Kauffman, similar to an earlier proposal by Freeman Dyson. 
All of these (including autopoiesis) found their original inspiration in Erwin Schrödinger&#x27;s book &quot;What is Life?&quot; but at first they appear to have little in common with one another, largely because the authors did not communicate with one another, and none of them made any reference in their principal publications to any of the other theories. Nonetheless, there are more similarities than may be obvious at first sight, for example between Gánti and Rosen. Until recently there have been almost no attempts to compare the different theories and discuss them together.

==Relation to cognition==
An extensive discussion of the connection of autopoiesis to cognition is provided by Evan Thompson in his 2007 publication, &quot;Mind in Life&quot;. The basic notion of autopoiesis as involving constructive interaction with the environment is extended to include cognition. Initially, Maturana defined cognition as behavior of an organism &quot;with relevance to the maintenance of itself&quot;. However, computer models that are self-maintaining but non-cognitive have been devised, so some additional restrictions are needed, and the suggestion is that the maintenance process, to be cognitive, involves readjustment of the internal workings of the system in some metabolic process. On this basis it is claimed that autopoiesis is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for cognition. Thompson wrote that this distinction may or may not be fruitful, but what matters is that living systems involve autopoiesis and (if it is necessary to add this point) cognition as well. It can be noted that this definition of &#x27;cognition&#x27; is restricted, and does not necessarily entail any awareness or consciousness by the living system. With the publication of The Embodied Mind in 1991, Varela, Thompson and Rosch applied autopoesis to make non-representationalist, and enactive models of mind, brain and behavior, which further developed embodied cognitive neuroscience, later culminating in neurophenomenology.

==Relation to consciousness==
The connection of autopoiesis to cognition, or if necessary, of living systems to cognition, is an objective assessment ascertainable by observation of a living system.

One question that arises is about the connection between cognition seen in this manner and consciousness. The separation of cognition and consciousness recognizes that the organism may be unaware of the substratum where decisions are made. What is the connection between these realms? Thompson refers to this issue as the &quot;explanatory gap&quot;, and one aspect of it is the hard problem of consciousness, how and why we have qualia.

A second question is whether autopoiesis can provide a bridge between these concepts. Thompson discusses this issue from the standpoint of enactivism. An autopoietic cell actively relates to its environment. Its sensory responses trigger motor behavior governed by autopoiesis, and this behavior (it is claimed) is a simplified version of a nervous system behavior. The further claim is that real-time interactions like this require attention, and an implication of attention is awareness.

==Criticism==

There are multiple criticisms of the use of the term in both its original context, as an attempt to define and explain the living, and its various expanded usages, such as applying it to self-organizing systems in general or social systems in particular. Critics have argued that the concept and its theory fail to define or explain living systems and that, because of the extreme language of self-referentiality it uses without any external reference, it is really an attempt to give substantiation to Maturana&#x27;s radical constructivist or solipsistic epistemology, or what Danilo Zolo has called instead a &quot;desolate theology&quot;. An example is the assertion by Maturana and Varela that &quot;We do not see what we do not see and what we do not see does not exist&quot;.

According to Razeto-Barry, the influence of &quot;Autopoiesis and Cognition: The Realization of the Living&quot; in mainstream biology has proven to be limited. Razeto-Barry believes that autopoiesis is not commonly used as the criterion for life.

Zoologist and philosopher Donna Haraway also criticizes the usage of the term, arguing that &quot;nothing makes itself; nothing is really autopoietic or self-organizing&quot;, and suggests the use of &quot;sympoiesis&quot;, meaning &quot;making-with&quot;, instead.

<doc id="269191" wikidata="Q1275851" url="?curid=269191" title="Scott McClellan">
<text>Scott McClellan (born February 14, 1968) is the former White House Press Secretary (2003–06) for President George W. Bush, he was the 24th person to hold this post. He was also the author of a controversial No. 1 &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller about the Bush administration titled &quot;What Happened&quot;. He replaced Ari Fleischer as press secretary in July 2003 and served until May 10, 2006. McClellan was the longest serving press secretary under George W. Bush.

He is now the Vice President for Communications at Seattle University.

==Family==
Born in Austin, Texas, McClellan is the youngest son of Carole Keeton, former Texas State Comptroller and former 2006 independent Texas gubernatorial candidate, and attorney Barr McClellan. McClellan&#x27;s brother Mark headed the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and was formerly Commissioner for the Food and Drug Administration. McClellan is the grandson of the late W. Page Keeton, longtime Dean of the University of Texas School of Law and renowned expert in tort law. He married Jill Martinez in November 2003. They have three sons.

==Career==
McClellan graduated from Austin High School in 1986. He was a top-ranked tennis player there and served as student council president. He later graduated from The University of Texas at Austin, where he was president of Sigma Phi Epsilon and a member of the tennis team in his early college years, with a B.A. in 1991. He served as campaign manager for three of his mother&#x27;s successful campaigns for statewide office. In addition, he worked on political grassroots efforts and was the Chief of Staff to a Texas State Senator.
Karen Hughes, then-Governor of Texas George W. Bush&#x27;s communications director, hired McClellan to be Bush&#x27;s deputy communications director. McClellan served as Bush&#x27;s traveling press secretary during the 2000 presidential election. McClellan became White House Deputy Press Secretary in 2001. McClellan replaced Ari Fleischer, who stepped down as White House Press Secretary on July 15, 2003. McClellan announced his resignation as Press Secretary on April 19, 2006, and was replaced with Tony Snow.

==Memoir and criticism of Bush administration==

McClellan criticized the Bush administration in his 2008 memoir, &quot;What Happened&quot;. In the book, he accused Bush of &quot;self-deception&quot; and of maintaining a &quot;permanent campaign approach&quot; to governing rather than making the best choices. McClellan stopped short of saying that Bush purposely lied about his reasons for the 2003 invasion of Iraq, writing that the administration was not &quot;employing out-and-out deception&quot; to make the case for war in 2002, though he did assert the administration relied on an aggressive &quot;political propaganda campaign&quot; to sell the Iraq War. His book was also critical of the White House press corps for being too accepting of the administration&#x27;s perspective on the war, and of Condoleezza Rice for being &quot;too accommodating&quot; and overly careful about protecting her own reputation.

In a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article on June 1, 2008, McClellan said of Bush: &quot;I still like and admire George W. Bush. I consider him a fundamentally decent person, and I do not believe he or his White House deliberately or consciously sought to deceive the American people.&quot;

Speaking frequently on the TV circuit, McClellan told Keith Olbermann in an interview on June 9, 2008, regarding the Iraq War planning: &quot;I don&#x27;t think there was a conspiracy theory there, some conspiracy to deliberately mislead. I don&#x27;t want to imply a sinister intent. There might have been some individuals that knew more than others and tried to push things forward in a certain way, and that&#x27;s something I can&#x27;t speak to. I don&#x27;t think that you had a bunch of people sitting around a room, planning and plotting in a sinister way. That&#x27;s the point I make in the book. At the same time, whether or not it was sinister or not, it was very troubling that we went to war on this basis.&quot;

As a result of his assertions in his book, McClellan was invited to testify before the U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary. During the actual testimony McClellan said: &quot;I do not think the president had any knowledge&quot; (of the revelation of Valerie Plame Wilson&#x27;s identity as a C.I.A. agent); &quot;In terms of the vice president, I do not know.&quot;

===Response to criticisms===
The Bush administration responded through Press Secretary Dana Perino, who said, &quot;Scott, we now know, is disgruntled about his experience at the White House. We are puzzled. It is sad. This is not the Scott we knew.&quot;

Critics of McClellan&#x27;s book included former White House staffers such as Karl Rove, Dan Bartlett, Ari Fleischer and Mary Matalin. Fleischer and Matalin have claimed that McClellan had not shared similar doubts during his tenure in the White House, and that if he had held such doubts then he ought not to have replaced Fleischer as Press Secretary. McClellan has responded by stating that he, like many other Americans, was inclined to give the administration the &quot;benefit of the doubt&quot; on the necessity of the Iraq War, and did not fully appreciate the circumstances until after leaving the &quot;White House bubble&quot;.

Bob Dole penned an excoriation of McClellan&#x27;s book, writing, &quot;Bottom line is that I have little respect for turncoats like McClellan who have it both ways. Some in public (and private) life have no shame when big bucks are involved. If their motive is &#x27;good government,&#x27; O.K. but that&#x27;s rarely the case.&quot; Dole likened the experience to a personal one, referring to a book, &quot;Senator for Sale,&quot; written in 1995 by his ex-staffer, Stanley Hilton, who worked for him in 1979 and 1980. Dole&#x27;s spokesperson, Nelson Warfield, responded to the book by characterizing it, in the Boston Globe, as &quot;pure garbage,&quot; a &quot;lame attempt at character assassination.&quot;

On May 28, 2008, &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; host Bill O&#x27;Reilly presented a clip from an interview with Fleischer, who suggested that the book was heavily influenced by the publisher&#x27;s editor. In a subsequent interview on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; days later, McClellan told O&#x27;Reilly that contention was not true. McClellan further testified under oath before the House Judiciary Committee that Fleischer&#x27;s assertion was false. McClellan stated on MSNBC&#x27;s &quot;Countdown with Keith Olbermann&quot; that &quot;everything in the book is a clear reflection of my views and everything in the book is mine.&quot;

==2008 election cycle==
McClellan endorsed Barack Obama for president on CNN&#x27;s &quot;D.L. Hughley Breaks the News&quot; aired on October 25, 2008. The endorsement was reported in the press two days earlier as the show had been taped prior to airing.

<doc id="269193" wikidata="Q653752" url="?curid=269193" title="Noise-cancelling headphones">
<text>Noise-cancelling headphones are headphones that suppress unwanted ambient sounds using active noise control (ANC).

Active noise cancellation makes it possible to listen to audio content without raising the volume excessively. In an aviation environment, noise-cancelling headphones increase the signal-to-noise ratio significantly more than passive noise attenuating headphones or no headphones, making hearing important information such as safety announcements easier. Noise-cancelling headphones can improve listening enough to completely offset the effect of a distracting concurrent activity.

==Theory==

To cancel the lower-frequency portions of the noise, noise-cancelling headphones use active noise control. A microphone captures the targeted ambient sounds, and a small amplifier generates sound waves that are exactly out of phase with the undesired sounds. When the sound pressure of the noise wave is high, the cancelling wave is low (and vice versa). The opposite sound waves collide and are eliminated or &quot;cancelled&quot; (destructive interference). Most noise-cancelling headsets in the consumer market generate the noise-cancelling waveform in real time with analog technology. In contrast, other active noise and vibration control products use soft real-time digital processing. According to an experiment conducted to test how lightweight earphones reduced noise as compared to commercial headphones and earphones, lightweight headphones achieved better noise reduction than normal headphones. The experiment also supported that in-ear headphones worked better at reducing noise than outer-ear headphones.

Cancellation focuses on constant droning sounds like road noise and is less effective on short/sharp sounds like voices or breaking glass. It also is ineffective in eliminating higher frequency noises like the sound of spraying. Noise-cancelling headphones often combine sound isolation with ANC to maximize the sound reduction across the frequency spectrum. Noise cancellation can also be used without sound isolation to make wanted sounds (such as voices) easier to hear. Noise cancellation to eliminate ambient noise is never passive because of the circuitry required, so references to passive noise cancellation actually are referring to products featuring sound isolation.

To prevent higher-frequency noise from reaching the ear, most noise-cancelling headphones depend on sound isolation or soundproofing. Higher-frequency sound has a shorter wavelength, and cancelling this sound would require locating devices to detect and counteract it closer to the listener&#x27;s eardrum than is currently technically feasible or would require digital algorithms that would complicate the headphone&#x27;s electronics.

Noise-cancelling headphones specify the amount of noise they can cancel in terms of decibels. This number may be useful for comparing products but does not tell the whole story, as it does not specify noise reduction at various frequencies.

== In aviation ==
By the 1950s, Lawrence J. Fogel created systems and submitted patents regarding active noise cancellation in the field of aviation. This system was designed to reduce noise for the pilots in the cockpit area and help make their communication easier and protect hearing. Fogel is considered to be the inventor of active noise cancellation, and he designed one of the first noise-cancelling headphones systems. Later on, Willard Meeker designed an active noise control model that was applied to circumaural earmuffs for advanced hearing protection. Noise-cancelling aviation headsets are now commonly available.

In 1989, Bose Corporation introduced its Aviation Headset Series I, which became the first commercially available ANR headset. 

Several airlines provide noise-cancelling headphones in their business and first-class cabins. Bose started supplying American Airlines with noise-cancelling headphones in 1999 and started offering the &quot;Quiet Comfort&quot; line for the general consumer in 2000. 

== Sensory protection ==
Aside from its role in communication and occupational health, ANC is used to protect wearers from lower levels of noise that still impact people sensitive to noise.

Noise-cancellation headphones have been used as sleeping aids. Both passive isolating and active noise-cancellation headphones or earplugs help to achieve a reduction of ambient sounds, which is particularly helpful for people suffering from insomnia or other sleeping disorders, for whom sounds such as cars honking and snoring impact their ability to sleep. For that reason, noise-cancelling sleep headphones and ear plugs are designed to cater to this segment of patients.

Noise-cancelling headphones have been provided for patients in intensive care units to reduce the amount of noise exposure that they face while in a hospital environment. Active noise control technology is shown to have a relationship with sleep disturbance, delirium, and morbidity, therefore bringing up concerns about lowering the levels of noise for patients receiving care.

Many neurodivergent people, particularly autists and those with ADHD, are sensitive to everyday noises, and profit from using ANC.

A December 2016 study from the &quot;Hong Kong Journal of Occupational Therapy&quot; found that noise-cancellation headphones helped children with autism spectrum disorder cope with behaviors related to hyper-reactivity and auditory stimuli.

== Health and safety ==

There is a general danger that listening to loud music in headphones can distract the listener and lead to injury and accidents. Noise-cancelling headphones add extra risk. Several countries and states have made it illegal to wear headphones while driving or cycling.

It is not uncommon to get a pressure-like feeling when using noise-cancelling headphones initially. This is caused by the lack of low-frequency sounds as being perceived as a pressure differential between the inner and outer ear.

==Drawbacks==
The active noise control requires power, usually supplied by a USB port or a battery that must occasionally be replaced or recharged. Without power, some models do not function as regular headphones. Any battery and additional electronics may increase the size and weight of the headphones compared to regular headphones. The noise-cancelling circuitry may reduce audio quality and add high-frequency hiss, although reducing the noise may result in higher perceived audio quality.

<text>Jan Švankmajer (born 4 September 1934) is a Czech retired film director, animator, writer, playwright and artist. He draws and makes free graphics, collage, ceramics, tactile objects and assemblages. In the early 1960s, he explored informel, which later became an important part of the visual form of his animated films. He is a leading representative of late Czech surrealism. In his film work, he created an unmistakable and quite specific style, determined primarily by a compulsively unorthodox combination of externally disparate elements. The anti-artistic nature of this process, based on collage or assemblage, functions as a meaning-making factor. The author himself claims that the intersubjective communication between him and the viewer works only through evoked associations, and his films fulfil their subversive mission only when, even in the most fantastic moments, they look like a record of reality. Some of the works he created together with his wife Eva Švankmajerová.

== Life and films ==
Jan Švankmajer was born in Prague on 4 September 1934. His father was a window dresser and his mother a seamstress. His childhood was profoundly influenced by a home puppet theatre, which he received as an eight-year-old boy for Christmas and gradually made his own puppets and painted the sets. Švankmajer admits that since then, puppets have been firmly embedded in his mental morphology, and he always resorts to them when he feels threatened by the reality of the outside world. He sees them not only in the context of theatre, but as a ritual symbol used in magic. The ludic principle on which Švankmajer&#x27;s work is based has its roots in his childhood. 

In 1950-1954 he graduated in scenography at the Higher School of Art Industry in Prague, under Prof. Richard Lander, where he designed and made puppets and sets. His classmates were Aleš Veselý and photographer Jan Svoboda. He then studied directing and stage design at the Department of Puppets at the Theatre Faculty of the Academy of Performing Arts in Prague (1954-1958), where Lander moved to as a teacher at that time. Even during the most rigid Stalinist regime, the atmosphere at the school was liberal and forbidden books on French modern art circulated among the students, brought by the painting teacher Karel Tondl. His classmate and friend was the later film director Juraj Herz. At the end of his studies, he took part in a sightseeing trip to Poland, where he saw reproductions of Paul Klee&#x27;s works for the first time.

During his studies, he staged the folk puppeteers&#x27; play Don Šajn (Don Juan) at the then &quot;Small Theatre D 34&quot; (1957-1958), led by Emil František Burian. In addition to D 34 theatre, he attended the Liberated Theatre and became acquainted with the works of the Russian avant-garde (Mejerhold, Eisenstein). In his graduation performance (C. Gozzi, &quot;The King Stag&quot;) he used a combination of puppets with live actors in masks. Soon after graduation in 1958, he participated as a puppeteer in Radok&#x27;s short film &quot;Johannes Doctor Faust&quot;, inspired by folk puppeteers. During the filming he met composer Zdeněk Liška, cinematographer Svatopluk Malý and designer Vlastimil Beneš. He briefly worked as a director and designer at the &quot;State Puppet Theatre&quot; in Liberec (the predecessor of Studio Ypsilon). In 1958-1960, he completed his compulsory military service in Mariánské Lázně, where he drew and painted intensively (&quot;Men&quot;, pen, watercolour on pressed paper, 1959).

After returning from the army in 1960, he founded the group &quot;Theatre of Masks&quot;, which belonged to the Semafor theatre. During the preparation of the first production of &quot;Starched Heads&quot;, he met Eva Dvořáková, whom he later married. Other productions of the Theatre of Masks were &quot;Johannes Doctor Faust&quot;, &quot;The Collector of Shadows&quot;, &quot;Circus Sucric&quot;. In 1962 he exhibited his drawings in the corridor of the Semafor and Vlastimil Beneš and Zbyněk Sekal, who visited the exhibition, invited him to join the &quot;Máj 57 group&quot;. He took part in the fourth exhibition of the Máj group in Poděbrady (1961), which was banned after three days, and then exhibited with the members of the group until the end of the 1960s.

The avant-garde &quot;Theatre of Masks&quot; did not fit Semafor&#x27;s profile as a musical stage. In 1962, Jiří Suchý closed it down, but Emil Radok facilitated the engagement of the entire group of the &quot;Theatre of Masks&quot; in Magician&#x27;s Lantern. In this year Jan Švankmajer made his first trip to Paris. In 1963 his daughter Veronika was born. After leaving Semafor, he worked until 1964 as director and head of the Black light theatre company at Magician&#x27;s Lantern. He directed two performances for the &quot;Variations&quot; programmes and later also externally for the &quot;Magic Circus&quot;, &quot;The Lost Fairy Tale&quot;. At the same time, together with Emil Radok, he was making up scripts for future films.

In 1964 he made his first short film, &quot;The Last Trick&quot;, based on the principles of black theatre. It features elements typical of all his subsequent work, such as the dynamic use of montage and the juxtaposition of live actors with animated objects. The film was successful abroad, and in the following years Švankmajer was given the opportunity to make short films combining puppetry, animation and elements of live action. In his early films, composed as short grotesques, black humour and peculiarly interpreted poetics of folk puppet plays prevail. In the second film from 1964, &quot;Johann Sebastian Bach: Fantasia in G minor&quot;, the visual component is a kind of &quot;mannerist informel&quot; with a recognizable influence of surrealist photographs by Emila Medková. In 1965, he made the film &quot;Spiel mit steinen&quot; (Playing with Stones) practically alone, with the help of Eva Švankmajerová and cinematographer Petr Puluj in Austria. He tried out various animation techniques, later used, for example, in the film Dimensions of Dialogue. For the Expo 67 competition in Montreal, he made a short film &quot;Man and Technique&quot; and participated in the film &quot;Digits&quot; by Pavel Procházka. In 1968 the Švankmajer family moved to the house No. 97/5 in Nový svět (Hradčany).

In 1968, he signed manifesto The Two Thousand Words. After the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, the whole family emigrated to Austria at the instigation of Eva Švankmajerová. Here he made his second film in an Austrian production in the studio of Peter Puluj (&quot;Picknick mit Weissmann&quot;). In 1968, he received the &quot;Max Ernst Prize&quot; at the Oberhausen Film Festival for his film &quot;Historia naturae&quot;. In 1969 the family decided to return to Czechoslovakia. In 1970 he met Vratislav Effenberger and together with Eva Švankmajerová they became members of the Surrealist Group in Czechoslovakia. Between 1971 and 1989 they contributed to samizdat edited anthologies &quot;Le-La&quot; and catalogues (&quot;Open Game&quot;, &quot;Sphere of Dream&quot;, &quot;Transformations of Humour&quot;, &quot;Imaginative Spaces&quot;, &quot;Opposite of the Mirror&quot;). After 1989 to the first and only issue of the anthology &quot;Gambra&quot; and then to the magazine &quot;Analogon&quot;.

During the short period up to 1970 Švankmajer still managed to make the &quot;Kafkaesque&quot; allegorical short films &quot;The Garden&quot;, &quot;The Apartment&quot; and &quot;Silent Week in the House&quot;, the morbid &quot;Ossuary&quot; and the &quot;puppet&quot; film &quot;Don Šajn&quot; (1970), in which marionettes are replaced by live actors who have wires and guide strings attached to their papier-mâché heads, symbolizing the theme of human manipulation and the limitations of individual freedom. After the advent of the normalization regime, Švankmajer&#x27;s creative work was hampered by censorship and his short films &quot;The Garden&quot; and &quot;The Apartment&quot; ended up in the vault. In 1972, as a volunteer, he underwent an experiment with intravenous administration of LSD at the Military Hospital in Prague. The experiment had a devastating effect on him, with anxiety states that he still recalls in his work 30 years later.

In 1972-1979 he was banned from filming because he refused to make compromise on the post-production of his film &quot;The Castle of Otranto&quot;, based on a gothic novel by H. Walpole. In 1973-1980 he worked as a production designer and film trick maker at Barrandov Studios. In 1975 his son Václav was born. In the 1970s, Jan Švankmajer worked as a stage designer at the Theatre on the Balustrade, the Večerní Brno Theatre, and especially at The Drama Club, where he was invited by Jaroslav Vostrý (&quot;Candide, The Educator, Crackle on the Lagoon, The Golden Carriage&quot;). Eva Švankmajerová participated in the performances as a costume designer and stage designer. Since 1976 he and his wife Eva have been creating ceramics under the joint pseudonym Kostelec.

As a trick designer and production designer in Barrandov Studios, he collaborated on the films of Oldřich Lipský (&quot;Dinner for Adele&quot;, 1977, &quot;The Mysterious Castle in the Carpathians&quot;, 1981) and Juraj Herz (&quot;The Ninth Heart&quot;, 1978, &quot;Upír z Feratu&quot; (The Vampire of Ferat), 1981). At the end of his persecution, he filmed two of Poe&#x27;s short stories, The Fall of the House of Usher and The Pendulum, the Pit and Hope, using themes from the work of Villiers de l&#x27;Isle Adam. In 1981 Jan and Eva Švankmajer bought a dilapidated castle in Horní Stankov, where they wanted to set up a ceramics workshop. Since then, they have been gradually reconstructing the castle and transforming it into a surreal &quot;Cabinet of Curiosities&quot;, consisting of their own artefacts and various collections of art and natural objects. Švankmajer&#x27;s collecting is a form of self-therapy, and in addition to found or purchased objects, it includes art from the natural peoples of Africa and Polynesia.

A retrospective of Švankmajer&#x27;s films from the 1960s attracted international attention at the 1983 FIFA International Film Festival in Annency. He received the &quot;Grand Prix&quot; and the &quot;International Critics&#x27; Prize&quot; for the Dimensions of Dialogue and the Golden Bear at the Berlinale the same year. Terry Gilliam ranks this film among the ten best animated films of all time. At home, Švankmajer became a victim of the score settling between the management of Czechoslovak Television and Short Film Prague, and Dimensions of Dialogue was shown to the ideological committee of the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia&#x27;s Central Committee as a deterrent. After that, he was again unable to work at Short Film studios and went to Bratislava, where he made the film &quot;Do pivnice&quot; (Into the cellar) in 1983. In the same year, he published his book &quot;Hmat a imaginace&quot; (Touch and Imagination) in five copies as a samizdat, summarising the results of his tactile experiments since 1974. He managed to secure money abroad for his project Alice, but the studios of Short Film and Barandov were not interested in filming. At that time, the state had a monopoly on all film production. So he turned to Jaromír Kallista, whom he knew as the producer of Magician&#x27;s Lantern, and asked him if he would direct the project with him as an independent film.

He presented his first feature-length film Alice, which was made during 1987 almost exclusively in a Swiss production (Condor Films), in 1988. The work was a worldwide success and won the &quot;Best Animated Feature Award&quot; at the Annecy International Animation Film Festival (JICA). At the same time, The Dimensions of Dialogue won the &quot;Grand Prize&quot; for the best film in the festival history. In 1990, he made the political grotesque agitprop film &quot;The Death of Stalinism in Bohemia&quot; and in 1992 the short work &quot;Food&quot;, in which he comes to terms with his gastronomic obsessions.

In the following years he devoted himself exclusively to directing feature films. The house at 27 Nerudova Street (Malá Strana), where Švankmajer had his film studio, was privatised and he had to leave it in the middle of the filming of The Faust. In 1991, together with Jaromír Kallista, he bought a former cinema in the village of Knovíz and founded his own film studio ATHANOR, where he made next films. At the prestigious Cardiff Animation Film Festival (1992) he was awarded the &quot;First IFA Prize&quot; and the BBC presented a show of his animated films over two nights.

In 1994, Švankmajer&#x27;s second feature film The Faust was premiered, starring Petr Čepek in the dual roles of Faust and Mephisto. Faust, a random man in the crowd, is manipulated by the entire plot and become accustomed to the role of Faust, which he plays to the bitter end. The film is an attempt at actual interpretation of the Faust myth and asks the question of what a man is allowed to know without destroying himself. This relationship is highly ambivalent and therefore provokes contradictory interpretations. The filming was accompanied by a series of tragic deaths and unexplained circumstances, and Petr Čepek himself completed the film at a time when he was already seriously ill. For this performance Čepek was awarded the Czech Lion in memoriam. The film was selected for the prestigious out-of-competition screening at the Cannes Film Festival. In 1994, &quot;Short Film Prague&quot; released a set of 26 Švankmajer&#x27;s films on cassettes. In Great Britain, Jan Švankmajer received the Lifetime Achievement Award.

In 1996 Švankmajer made Conspirators of Pleasure, a black comedy about people who follow the principle of pleasure and perform harmless imaginative perversions and rituals. He contrasts their personal freedom with the moderating and repressive role of society, education or school. The film is a sarcastic satire on the contemporary world full of sexual perversions and erotic fetishes. Švankmajer has made the most of his many years of artistic experiments on the subject of tactilism. He concluded the film with the words: &quot;I believe that black and objective humour, mystification and the cynicism of fantasy are more adequate means of expressing the decadence of the times than the hypocritical, but popular &quot;smell of humanity&quot; in Czech films&quot;.

The following film Little Otik (2000) won the Czech Lion for Best Film and Best Art Direction (together with Eva Švankmajerová). In 2003 FAMU awarded Jan Švankmajer the title of Doctor honoris causa.

During 2004, Eva and Jan Švankmajer had a retrospective exhibition &quot;Memory of Animation - Animation of Memory&quot; in Plzeň and an exhibition called &quot;Food&quot; in the Prague Castle Riding Hall. Both were a great success with the general public and were considered by critics to be the artistic event of the year. A retrospective of 30 of his films was shown as part of the &quot;Plzeň Film Festival&quot; on the occasion of the author&#x27;s 70th birthday.

On 17 November 2005, the film Lunacy premiered, which is conceived as a philosophical horror film inspired by the personality of the Marquis de Sade and the short stories of Edgar Allan Poe. Eva Švankmajerová, who died shortly before the premiere, was awarded the Czech Lion in memoriam for the artistic concept and poster for this film. Their daughter Veronika Hrubá also collaborated on the film. Student Jurry at the Plzeň Film Festival awarded Lunacy as the &quot;Best Feature Film&quot;. At the 2009 Karlovy Vary International Film Festival, Jan Švankmajer received the Crystal Globe for &quot;Outstanding Contribution to World Cinema&quot;.

His last feature film so far, Insects, based on Švankmajer&#x27;s 1971 short story (inspired by the play Pictures from the Insects&#x27; Life of the Čapek brothers, with a reference to Kafka&#x27;s The Metamorphosis), was screened at film festivals in 2018 and had its UK premiere at the Tate Modern. The Rotterdam festival screened &quot;Insects&quot; in the section &quot;Signatures&quot; dedicated to great authors and filmmakers. Jan Švankmajer has established an exclusive position in the history of cinema and is recognized as one of the few contemporary Czech filmmakers abroad. By 2018, he had received 36 awards and 17 nominations for his films worldwide, including the 2018 Raymond Roussel Medal for Lifetime Achievement in Film, awarded by the Raymond Roussel Society in Barcelona.

Since 1970, Jan Švankmajer has participated in the activities of the &quot;Surrealist Group in Czechoslovakia&quot; and is the chairman of the editorial board of the &quot;Analogon&quot; magazine (104 issues until 2024), to which he also contributes. In 1990, he participated in the collective exhibition of the Surrealist Group &quot;The Third Ark&quot; in Prague&#x27;s Mánes. Since 1991 he has been a member of Mánes Union of Fine Arts. He animates his films alone (&quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;) or in collaboration with top animators such as Vlasta Pospíšilová and Bedřich Glaser. In his feature films, he has collaborated with friends from his time at The Drama Club (Jiří Hálek, Petr Čepek) and other proven actors (Jan Kraus, Jiří Lábus, Pavel Nový, Jan Tříska, Martin Huba, Pavel Liška, Václav Helšus, Anna Geislerová, Veronika Žilková, Klára Issová, etc.).

Jan Švankmajer uncompromisingly defends his personal freedom and rejects any official awards granted by state authorities. In 1989 he rejected the Merited Artist award, in the 1990s the French Ordre des Arts et des Lettres and in 2011 the award proposed by Václav Havel. He considers the state as a source of organized violence and means of oppression and manipulation.

Eva Švankmajerová participated in some of the films as a stage and production designer. Their son Václav Švankmajer is also a filmmaker, including &quot;The Torchbearer&quot;. He contributed to the artwork for the film Insects (2018). Švankmajer&#x27;s daughter Veronika Hrubá collaborated as a costume designer on the films Lunacy (Czech Lion Award), Surviving Life, and Insects.

== Work ==
Švankmajer&#x27;s hard-to-classify artistic style developed in the 1960s in parallel with his work in the theatre and animated films. Jan Švankmajer&#x27;s early drawings were inspired by Paul Klee. Around 1960, he briefly dealt with structural abstraction, but soon returned to figuration and from the late 1960s onwards embraced surrealism. His objects from the early 1960s can be classified as informel only formally, on the basis of similarities in expressivity and surface structure, but in reality they were real objects, subjected to a process of transformation as &quot;accelerated aging&quot; or ornamentation. However, his preoccupation with informel runs through his entire film oeuvre, as macro details of scratched walls and age-marked objects, or the sudden transformation of things into undifferentiated matter, form a significant part of the visual form of his animated films. His &quot;Springs objects&quot; - usually shoes, mineralized in Karlovy Vary spring water - date from 2009.

He became a member of the Surrealist Group, which was formed around Vratislav Effenberger, at a time when the group was going through a crisis. After the occupation of Czechoslovakia in August 1968, the ban on publishing was reinstated, many people went into exile and others resigned from the group. At the same time, the Surrealist movement in France disintegrated. Jan and Eva Švankmajer had a significant influence on the revival of the activities of the Surrealist Group. The group&#x27;s interest in all kinds of imaginative experiments was the basis for the creation of collective anthologies devoted to the themes of interpretation, analogy, eroticism and tactilism. Švankmajer considers imagination to be a gift that humanizes man.

As artist, he was later influenced by the Surrealists Max Ernst, R. Magritte, G. Chirico, of the older ones Hieronymus Bosch and especially the Mannerism of Giuseppe Arcimboldo. Švankmajer&#x27;s films &quot;Playing with Stones&quot;, &quot;Historia naturae&quot; and &quot;Dimensions of Dialogue&quot; have a direct connection with the principles of Arcimboldo&#x27;s Mannerist painting. His collections of curiosities (similar to Rudolf II&#x27;s kunstkomora), folk puppetry, naive folk art, African and Polynesian masks and fetishes, and art brut are strong and lasting inspirations.

He is interested in the authenticity of folk puppetry and the magic associated with puppets, rather than puppets as mere artistic devices or props for animation. The puppet and the thread or guide wire, as an analogy of man&#x27;s destiny and his connection to something above him that determines his fate, are known from various religions and myths. It is a space for the realization of the &quot;impossible&quot;, incompatible with good education, for the realization of even seemingly incredible dreams. The child-puppeteer is thus in fact a shaman, a god and a creator.

He cites the French Poète maudit, German Romanticism (Novalis, E. T. A. Hoffmann), and the Surrealists (A. Breton, K. Teige, B. Péret, V. Effenberger) as major literary sources. The literary inspiration for Švankmajer&#x27;s films were the works of Lewis Caroll, E. A. Poe, Auguste Villiers de l&#x27;Isle-Adam or Marquis de Sade. His interpretation of other authors&#x27; literary works is ultimately a subjective account that preserves only the terrors, dreams, and infantilism of the world he shares with them.

In Švankmajer´s film work, his sense of the concrete irrationality of plots corresponds to some of the types of aggressive cinematic civilism that was applied in the works of the directors of the Czechoslovak &quot;New Wave&quot; (Miloš Forman, Pavel Juráček). His work shares a certain &quot;oppositional&quot; attitude with the films of the Czechoslovak New Wave of the 1960s, but otherwise escapes any classification. Among world theatre directors and filmmakers, he was inspired by the Russian avant-garde theatre artists V. Meyerhold, A. Tairov and Bauhaus artist O. Schlemmer, by filmmakers S. Eisenstein and D. Vertov. He described films Un Chien Andalou, L&#x27;Age d&#x27;Or by Buñuel and Dalí, Amarcord, Roma (1972 film) by F. Fellini and, among the works close to animation, the films of Méliès and David Bowers as a defining cinematic experience. Of contemporary directors, he is close to David Lynch or the Quay brothers.

Švankmajer makes films only when they are finished in his imagination, but during the shooting process he does not stick to the script, he looks for new sources of inspiration and tries to reach an acceptable compromise with the original intention. He himself states that filmmaking is a kind of self-therapy, and in his works he repeatedly comes to terms with his idiosyncrasies, anxieties and obsessions that originated in his childhood. His preference for &quot;decadent genres&quot; such as folk puppets and sets, fair-ground mechanical targets, and black novels is at the root of his anti-aesthetic attitude towards filmmaking. Not only his films, but also his collages, prints, ceramics and three-dimensional objects are based on his infantile worldview, which took the form of a puppet stage with symmetrically cut sets and figures hanging on strings. The alchemical and kabbalistic history of Prague is an undoubted inspiration for him, and his work builds on these sources and combines it with surrealism. Surrealism and Mannerism, which are anchored in the duality of opposites - rationalism with the irrational, sensualism with spiritualism, tradition with innovation, convention with revolt - create the necessary tension for creative activity. In his view, Surrealism represents a contemporary form of Romanticism that restores art to its magical dignity.

Švankmajer strives to make his films, even in their most fantastic moments, look like records of reality. As a filmmaker, he is particularly renowned for his ability to animate any material. He sees film animation not as a technique, but as a magical means capable of animating inanimate matter and thus realising an original infantile desire. In his conception, animation is a transformation or transmutation of matter - from an object to its parts or essence and vice versa, and is close to alchemy. As a hermeticist, he believes that objects touched by people in moments of heightened sensibility have an inner life of their own and somehow preserve the contents of the subconscious. In The Fall of the House of Usher, he replaced people with objects that became vehicles for the plot and the emotions of the acting characters and the atmosphere of the story.

According to Effenberger, the secret of Švankmajer&#x27;s imaginative humour lies in the fact that when he juxtaposes lyrical pathos and raw reality, the rawness fades along with the pathos and lyrical reality becomes what it is in the eyes of a child or a poet. In the alternation of genres, the cementing thread in his films is the dream logic, where apparent contingencies take on the form of inescapable fatality and guide the viewer smoothly through the story - the dream. There are no logical transitions between dream and reality, only the physical act of opening and closing the eyelids.

Švankmajer&#x27;s films are subversive and do not conform to any taboos, conventions or prescriptions of reason. They are a rebellion against the consumerist world, a radical revolution, a liberation from rigid reality and a return to the world of free play. He sees destruction as a creative way of challenging rationality, but his conception of surrealism is exclusive and autonomous. According to Švankmajer, surrealism is a realism that seeks the reality beneath the surface of things and phenomena. What is above reality, meets with hermeticism and psychoanalysis. The author maintains absolute freedom and does not calculate with the taste of the audience - he himself says that he is indifferent whether five or five million viewers come to see his film. His work has also influenced several foreign filmmakers, such as Tim Burton, Terry Gilliam, the Quay brothers, and Henry Selick.

...the theme of freedom, the only theme for which it is still worth picking up a pen, brush or camera...

...it is not worth striving for less than absolute freedom. Society will truncate it beyond recognition in the process anyway. If you start lower than at absolute freedom, you will have no freedom at the end.

...the creative act gives meaning and rebellion (revolt) dignity to life. ibid. p. 362

...I think that without revolt a normal, decent person cannot live. There is no society that is so ideal that one does not have to revolt against it...

=== Works of art ===

During his studies at secondary school, Jan Švankmajer was influenced by interwar surrealism and later especially by Paul Klee. At the turn of the 1950s and 1960s, he briefly turned to structural abstraction as an artist (&quot;Corossion&quot;, 1960, &quot;Slope&quot;, 1961). Informel, however, was only the starting point from which he returned to concrete reality (&quot;The Great Corrosion&quot;, 1963). He gradually replaced existential melancholy with black humour and the creation of three-dimensional objects (&quot;Bottle-Drowned&quot;, 1964, &quot;Hourglass Isolation&quot;, 1964, &quot;Three Heads&quot;, 1965).

From the mid-1960s onwards, information about foreign art reached Czechoslovakia, and Švankmajer was able to get acquainted with the works of Max Ernst, René Magritte and other surrealists. At the same time, he also discovered Rudolphine Mannerism, which influenced his late Informel. Arcimboldo became a lifelong obsession for him and the inspiration for many of his artworks, especially his collages and three-dimensional assemblages. He also dedicated a short film to him, &quot;Historia naturae&quot; (1967), which was associated with the creation of collages (&quot;Švank-meyers Bilderlexikon&quot;), etchings (&quot;Natural History&quot;) and objects (&quot;Natural History Cabinet&quot;) on the theme of fantasy zoology.

After Jan Švankmajer and his wife joined the Surrealist Group around Vratislav Effenberger, from 1971 to 1989 he contributed as author of texts and illustrations to anthologies and catalogues published by the group as samizdats (&quot;Otevřená hra / Open Game, Sféra snu / Sphere of Sleep, Proměny humoru / Transformations of Humour, Obrazotvorné prostory / Imaginative Spaces, Opak zrcadla / Opposite Mirror, Gambra / Gambra&quot;). At that time, he also experimented with spatial collage (the nativity scene &quot;The Birth of Antichrist&quot;, 1971) and, from 1974, especially with the tactile sense. In his writings, he consistently refuses to identify Surrealism with an aesthetic derived from certain founding figures or to reduce it to Surrealist artistic practices, but considers Surrealism to be a &quot;world attitude&quot; as an amalgam of philosophy, ideology, psychology, and magic, and therefore remains relevant. According to him, act of creation is the result of psychic automatism or the materialization of an inner model. The idea is only a part of the creative process, not an impulse to it (Jan Švankmajer: The Ten Commandments). Even in the making of a film, the script serves only as a starting point, but the process of filming itself awakens unplanned images in the unconscious and the final form is created only by the &quot;chaotic authenticity&quot; of the creative process.

Švankmajer&#x27;s Manifesto of New Applied Art, entitled &quot;The Magic of Objects&quot; (1979-1991), is an attempt to legalize irrationality in this field of art and to return the magical dimension to the outwardly utilitarian activity. Functionalism represented &quot;hygienic purification&quot;, which returned applied art to the zero point. Surrealism began to occupy the space thus cleared and items of daily use were created that retained their utilitarian function without losing their magic. Ceramics, which he and Eva Švankmajerová had been working on in the 1970s, was understood this way. The initial impulse was to create the objects of his desire and to satisfy his frustration with the unavailability of the objects of the Rudolf´s Kunstkammer, while eating from them or storing objects in them.

==== Collages, drawings and prints ====
Collages have been one of Švankmajer&#x27;s key artistic devices since the 1960s. He understands them as a technical and at the same time noetic principle and, in addition to art cycles or spatial assemblages, he often uses them in short and feature films. The polarity of his creative expression lies in the connection between the high and the low, the aggressive and the lyrical, the fatal and the grotesque.

In the early 1970s he began to create the &quot;Svank-meyers Bilderlexikon&quot;, as a kind of encyclopedia of the alternative world, including fictional fauna and flora, technical devices, architecture, ethnography and cartography. Švankmajer&#x27;s significant inspiration is nature, from whose register he selects at will and creates anatomical re-creations of fanciful animal and bird creatures. After two years of intensive work, the &quot;Bilderlexikon&quot; project remained a mere torso, and in the early 1970s there was no chance of publishing it in print. Therefore, the author selected ten collages and converted them by hand into graphic etching. The &quot;Bilderlexikon&quot;, which the author continued to develop in later years, includes the cycles &quot;Geography&quot;, &quot;Zoology&quot;, &quot;Technology&quot; (&quot;Masturbation Machine&quot;, 1972-1973), &quot;Architecture&quot;, &quot;Unconventional anatomy&quot; (1998), and &quot;Insects (Hexapoda)&quot; (2018). In 2016, he followed up his cartographic series with the collages&#x27;, in which he pasted depictions of skin diseases from a medical atlas into historical maps (&quot;Sick Maps&quot;, 2016).

The collage series &quot;The Great Adventure Novel&quot; (1997-1999) was created as a reminiscence of his youthful predilection for adventure novels and a tribute to Max Ernst. Švankmajer first illustrated and redrew the illustrations and eventually used them as part of his collages.

In 1999, jointly with Eva Švankmajerová, he created a series of coloured lithographs with fantasy themes as part of a collective game invented by the Surrealists (&quot;Cadavre exquis&quot;, 1999). These works combine the liberating element of play with a critical analysis of psychosocial contents at different levels of consciousness. In 2000, he created a series of collages entitled &quot;Yet Nothing Happens&quot;, in which the red head of the devil appears as a memento in romantic illustrations from the turn of the century.
==== Frottages and combined techniques ====
At the same time Švankmajer was also engaged in coloured frottage (&quot;Man Greets a Demon&quot;, 1999) and collaged some frottage (&quot;Two Dogs&quot;, 1999). In his texts he increasingly deals with the warning signs of the crisis of civilization and the unfortunate state of human society.

After the Prague Art Brut exhibition in 1998, Jan Švankmajer became interested in Art Brut artists and became a collector of these works and together with Eva Švankmajerová began to create medium drawings. They are usually based on frottage, created from randomly scattered substrates, similarly to fortune-telling from lines in the palm of the hand, coffee grounds, animal entrails, etc. This is followed by a kind of passive interpretation, where the hand complements this base with a drawing. Gradually an automatic ornament asserts itself, which is not merely decorative, but captures a certain &quot;rhythm of the soul&quot;. In this way, the medium&#x27;s drawing approaches something archetypal, touching on the music of natural peoples, primal jazz, nursery rhymes and chants. A side line is a series of drawings combined with collage, which the artist, in connection with his other compulsive obsession, called the &quot;Scatological Cycle&quot; (2017).
==== Ceramics ====
In the 1970s, when Švankmajer was not allowed to make films, he looked for other ways to make a living. Eva Švankmajerová, who came from Kostelec nad Černými lesy, where there is a strong tradition of pottery, was close to ceramics. Together they started to create majolica and engobe clay pottery under the &quot;pottery brand&quot; &quot;JE and EJ Kostelec&quot;. The ceramic objects conceal cavities (&quot;Little and Big Demon&quot;, 1990) and invite exploration of the contents, but also touching, stroking or caressing, thus connecting key points of human sensuality. Some replicate various objects from Švankmajer&#x27;s collections in the form of metaphors, thus representing ceramic rebirths of the original models (&quot;Arcimboldo&#x27;s Head,&quot; 1981, &quot;Beethoven Portrayed by Arcimboldo&quot;, 1993).

Jan Švankmajer considered their joint ceramic work to be an attempt to &quot;return the outwardly utilitarian activity to its magical dimension and the legality to irrationality. The shape of the plate, cutlery, etc., can be used to evoke a number of associations during a meal and to eroticize the whole process of eating or to make it a cannibalistic-aggressive act.&quot;

Švankmajer&#x27;s objects encompass a range of artistic techniques, including ceramics combined with various objects (&quot;Masochistic alchemy&quot;, 1966). In the second half of the 1990s, he created the Alchemy series (&quot;Distillation&quot;, &quot;Fifth Essence&quot;, 1996). Objects in glass vitrines often depict some form of dialogue (&quot;Dialogue of bald&quot;, 1994, &quot;Dialogue on Life and Death&quot;, 1996), they are a reference to famous surrealist works (&quot;Eva&#x27;s Shoes - a tribute to Méret Oppenheim&quot;, 2008) or represent a persiflage of the key Rosecrucian symbol of the &quot;mystical wedding&quot; - the fusion of king and queen, in the form of an assemblage of heterogeneous elements including an alchemical retort, shoes, brushes, bones, skull, etc. (&quot;Alchemical Wedding&quot;, 1994).
==== Gestural sculpture and tactile objects ====
Švankmajer&#x27;s imagination, which allows him to animate any kind of material, also allows him to freely use materials when assembling puppets. He created the stone precursors of his puppets from coloured stones in his film &quot;Playing with Stones&quot; (1965) and later used a similar principle to build his gestural puppets from ceramic clay. The puppet thus lost its initially unambiguous character, ceased to be an actor and became a symbol, a kind of multi-significant &quot;proto-fetish&quot; (&quot;Marionette of the Unknown God&quot;, 2002, &quot;Death&quot; - a puppet from the series &quot;Knight, Death and the Devil, a tribute to Albrecht Dürer&quot;, 2012).

Unlike gestural painting, gestural sculpture is not mediated by any instrument and is a pure expression of the emotional and psychological state of the creator. In this work with matter, the primary concern is not visual sensation and aesthetic impact, but the record (fossil, diary) of immediate emotion. Gestural sculpture is intended to evoke associations linked to the sense of touch, to expand the field of tactile perception and to explore previously uncharted areas. The results are tactile objects designed to massage the body and to explore hitherto unknown erogenous zones, tactile portraits, tactile objects inspired by dreams and concealing unexpected tactile sensations, tactile poems as linearly ordered tactile gestures recorded in fired ceramic clay, tactile marionettes assembled from pieces of roughly worked clay, mantras and yantras.

Some of Švankmajer&#x27;s gestural puppets seem to deny their own purpose as puppets - they have everything that belongs to a puppet, except that they cannot be guided. Their charm lies in their menacing and mocking stillness, in which the conventional sign is transformed into an unsettling poetic image, as liberating as it is confusing. His seemingly innocuous monsters, combining gesture-moulded clay with brushes, forks, sieves and other ordinary objects, exude an Ubu-esque preoccupation that mixes tragedy with humour, as well as a sarcastically mocking, almost animalistic cheekiness or contemptuous narcissism. Švankmajer evokes tactile feelings in his films as well, as he assumes the existence of &quot;tactile memory&quot; - a planted tactile experience, related, for example, to sensuality.
In his film &quot;The Fall of the House of Usher&quot;, the gestural animation of clay, which here represents primordial matter (prima materia in the alchemical sense), is used to interpret the poem by E. A. Poe

Švankmajer&#x27;s need to reveal the primary sources of human imagination is also related to his tactile objects. They were originally created as an experiment for the theme of interpretation within the Surrealist Group (&quot;Tactile portrait of E. Š&quot;, 1977), but the result was so stimulating that he continued to work on them for seven years, when he was not allowed to make films, and they became one of the most interesting aspects of his work. According to the artist, the sense of touch stands somewhere in the middle between the human senses, which provide purely objective (sight, hearing) or subjective (smell, taste) information. As a sense that has long had a purely utilitarian role and could not, for practical reasons, be aestheticized, the sense of touch retains a certain primitive connection to the world and an instinctive quality. Tactile sensation has one of the most important functions in eroticism, recalling associations linked to the deepest layers of the human unconscious (&quot;The Pleasure Principle&quot;, Tactile Object, 1996), elevating touch to one of the senses with the potential to inspire modern art.

He considers the sense of touch to be the primordial sense through which the newborn child becomes acquainted with the surrounding world by means of touching the mother. The sense of touch also plays a major role in the practical realization of erotic relationships. Erotic inspiration is present in Švankmajer&#x27;s films as a manifest provocation and parody of utilitarian sex, sarcasm, black humour, interpretation of sexual deviance and existential anxiety. In connection with the film &quot;Conspirators of Pleasure&quot; (1996), a series of artworks was created in which the Švankmajer family used tactile ceramic objects with sexual connotations (&quot;Animated Man and Animated Woman&quot;, 1996, &quot;Philosophy in the Bedroom&quot; - Realised Drawing, 1996, &quot;Philosophy in the Boudoir&quot;, 1996), etc.
==== Assemblages and objects ====
Some of the works are related to Švankmajer´s early films from the 1960s (&quot;Playing with Stones&quot;, &quot;Historia naturae&quot;) and are part of a continuous creative process where each object becomes a stimulus for a new interpretation. The objects in the glass cases are intended for the Cabinet of curiosities project, whose function is initiatory rather than aesthetic. According to Effenberger, Švankmajer&#x27;s &quot;Natural History Cabinet&quot;, containing phantom creatures that seem to have escaped scientific registration only to be discovered by the imagination of a rebellious child determined to protect poetic freedom, is a work of philosophical attitude rather than mere artistic sarcasm. This cycle defies both the rationality of nature and the rationality of modern art. The symbolic merging of disparate elements contains a sense of the miraculous that has blended the tragic with the humorous in the human imagination since ancient cultures.

Some of the most impressive objects &quot;animate&quot; minerals, combining bodies with cut agates and human limbs (&quot;Copulating Agates&quot;, &quot;Mineralogy with Three Legs&quot;, 2003). After 2011, he has been immersing some of his spatial objects in the Carlsbad Mineral Spring, creating &quot;premature fossils&quot;. His &quot;fossilized objects&quot; become covered with a layer of mineral spring deposition, which gives them a uniform reddish-brown surface - a colour characteristic of Švankmajer&#x27;s other works and originating in childhood memories. The artist thus attempts to bring the creation back to nature or at least to involve it in the creative process. The result, according to him, is a kind of &quot;fossils of this fucking civilization as a prefigurement of its destruction&quot; (&quot;The End of Civilization II?&quot;, 2011).
==== Fetishes and reliquaries ====
Puppets and assemblages are followed by objects that have been labelled by the artist directly as fetishes. These are not replicas of objects used for magical acts by natural peoples, nor do they have the aesthetic qualities of statues or masks (&quot;Flying Fetish&quot;, 2002). Švankmajer&#x27;s fetishism consists in linking an unfinished series of sources and contexts, which develop over time from the simpler to the more complex and, like a snowball, pile on top of each other the author&#x27;s affects, emotions, knowledge and obsessions that give energy to the process. He thus proceeds against the meaning of the puppet itself, and in his creative mania he moves on to ever more ambiguous objects, whose external form and semantic functions metamorphose, thus increasing their symbolic quality. Such a fetish is, for example, the nail-battered statue of the Crucified Christ in Lunacy.

The author declares of the fetish - &quot;it is our creation to which we have attributed magical powers. We have charged it with desire and imagination and expect a miracle from it&quot;. Fetishes are wounded to make them obey and fed to give them the power to fulfil our wishes. Jan Švankmajer imitated the ritual of the Congolese Africans, who hammer spikes and sharp pieces of metal into their fetishes to seal their covenant with them. He gathered assemblages of various remains of civilization in drawers from old furniture and &quot;fed&quot; them with blood and cornmeal. When everything began to deteriorate in the drawers in the sun and the fly larvae formed wounds in the matter, he completed the transformation with a heat gun, covered it with asphalt and buried it in ash. In this way, he partly returned to the informel starting point of his work (&quot;Drawer Fetish&quot;, 2015-2017).

He creates a life-size &quot;Horse Fetish&quot; as the central object of his Kunstkamera, using a commercially available laminated horse body, which he combines with parts of various mammal skeletons. The resulting object is reminiscent of some of Peter Oriešek&#x27;s airbrush drawings on the theme of Vanitas. Embedded in the belly of the fetish is one of his assemblage objects in a glass case - &quot;Pegasus Embryo&quot;.

Švankmajer&#x27;s modern reliquaries are shells of various animal remains, adorned with haberdashery props such as braids, faux pearls, buttons and tassels (&quot;Reliquary of the Sixteen Martyrs&quot;, 2015) and accompanied by a drawing. Some are figurative (&quot;Reliquary XV&quot;, 2016), while others are created spontaneously by the artist and are reminiscent in character of Švankmajer&#x27;s medium frottage and drawings (&quot;Reliquary in Landscape&quot;, 2016). In the reliquaries, the seemingly sacred and the profane intertwine and are transformed into co-carriers of a sarcastic vision, becoming parts of &quot;The Emperor&#x27;s New Clothes&quot; in a sell-out of today&#x27;s world of contentless institutions and hackneyed political, economic, or value clichés in general. Their message is not only subjectively grotesque, but above all psychologically and psychosocially aggressive (&quot;Coalition Partners, Resting Titan Before the End of the World&quot;, 2018).

=== Literary work ===
Jan Švankmajer writes down his dreams, and then translates some of them into film scripts or theatre one-act plays.

In his literary texts, he makes no secret of his sceptical view of the current form of human civilisation, which is destroying the spiritual essence of man with its pragmatism, utilitarianism and rationalism. The genre that, in his opinion, most accurately corresponds to its present situation, is the black grotesque. Švankmajer writes, that state is an instrument of repression and the common man a victim of manipulation, as an actor in his film Faust. Freedom and personal integrity can only be preserved through personal revolt. Art has been replaced by advertising and entertainment shows, and consumerism has become the new ideology.

Humanity, perhaps out of impatience, tries to introduce all noble and humanistic ideas first in a swift and bloody way, and only after the failure of this brutal variant does it embark on the lengthy path of peaceful evolution. Švankmajer&#x27;s apocalyptic visions foresee a post-civilizational disintegration of nation-states, coupled with the return of a new feudalism in the form of some kind of principalities, controlled by multinational concerns, where ordinary people will once again become serfs.

In 1983 he published his work &quot;Touch and Imagination&quot; in five copies as a samizdat, which was then reprinted in 1994 by Kozoroh Publishing.

<doc id="269220" wikidata="Q828020" url="?curid=269220" title="New Jersey Route 324">
<text>Route 324 is an isolated and partially closed state highway in Logan Township in the U.S. state of New Jersey. The two-lane concrete route runs along the alignment of Old Ferry Road from the shore of the Delaware River to a cul-de-sac near the interchange between U.S. Route 322 (US 322) and US 130 in Logan Township. The route does not intersect with any state routes or county routes along its entire alignment. The portion from the Delaware River to Springers Lane, consisting of over half of the route, is marked with a &quot;Road Closed&quot; sign, with minimal if any maintenance — potholes and overgrowing vegetation plague this section.

Route 324 was a former alignment of US 322 that served the Bridgeport-Chester ferry between Bridgeport, New Jersey, and Chester, Pennsylvania. The ferry first ran on July 1, 1930, with US 322 being designated along the ferry and its access road in 1936 from Pennsylvania. The highway and ferry also shared the co-designation of State Highway Route S-44, a spur off State Highway Route 44 in Bridgeport. Route S-44 was decommissioned in the state highway renumbering while US 322 remained intact until the opening of the Commodore Barry Bridge in February 1974. The ferry made its last run at 8 p.m. on February 1, and closed down for good. US 322 was realigned onto the Commodore Barry Bridge while the former ferry alignment became Route 324.

== Route description ==

Route 324 begins at a dead-end along the shoreline of the Delaware River and the wreckage of the old ferry dock in Logan Township. Route 324 heads eastward along Old Ferry Road, a two-lane concrete roadway surrounded by trees and fields. The two-lane concrete highway remains such for a distance, paralleling US 322 to the south, passing an access road to a business. The route heads to the east, crossing south of a pond and intersecting with Springers Lane and a dirt road in Logan Township. The entire section west of Springers Lane is marked with a &quot;Road Closed&quot; sign, with minimal maintenance, multiple large potholes, and overgrown vegetation crowding the roadway.

At Springers Lane, which is a former alignment of Route 44, the regularly maintained section of Route 324 begins. The road is now in an open area, crossing under power lines and intersecting with former alignments of roadway, overgrown with grass. A short distance from Springers Lane, the highway continues to the only other intersection along the route, which is for Island Road, a connector to US 130. The highway, however, continues through the desolate portions of Logan Township along a power line. A short distance later, the route passes to the south of the only development along the highway, a boat marina and two homes. Route 324 continues as a two-lane concrete road eastward until reaching a cul-de-sac just short of the US 130/US 322 interchange in Logan Township, where the designation ends.

==History==
The ferry route that Route 324 serviced first made its crossings of the Delaware River on July 1, 1930, from Chester, Pennsylvania, to Bridgeport, New Jersey. The ferry service was run with two boats, &quot;Chester&quot;, a large boat with a capacity of 60 motor vehicles, and &quot;Bridgeport&quot;, a smaller boat with a capacity of 48. The ferry system was seen as an advantage across the Delaware, providing drivers a backup from the few bridges that existed along the river. In 1936, the Bridgeport–Chester Ferry was granted the alignment for the extension of U.S. Route 322 from Pennsylvania and into New Jersey. Along with the U.S. Route 322 designation, the New Jersey State Highway Department designated the alignment of Route 322 from the ferry to U.S. Route 130, then designated as State Highway Route 44, as State Highway Route S-44.

Route 322 survived the state highway renumbering because it was a U.S. Route. However, the co-designation on the ferry stretch, State Highway Route S-44 was decommissioned in favor of just one designation. U.S. Route 322 remained on the ferry route for several years, and plans arose during the 1960s to construct a new bridge between the Delaware Memorial and Walt Whitman bridges. Construction began that year, and on February 1, 1974, the newly named Commodore Barry Bridge opened for traffic. At 8 p.m. that evening, the Bridgeport–Chester Ferry ran its final boat ride across the Delaware, and the service was closed down for good. The alignment of U.S. Route 322 was moved onto the Commodore Barry Bridge, while the former alignment was redesignated Route 324. The route received mileposts in 2017.

In 2018, the portion of Route 324 from its western terminus to Springer Lane was downloaded to Logan Township. The following year, the same portion was vacated by Logan Township.

<text>Tenerife ( ; ; formerly spelled &quot;Teneriffe&quot;) is the largest and most populous island of the Canary Islands. It is home to 42.8% of the total population of the archipelago. With a land area of and a population of 965,857 inhabitants as of January 2025, it is also the most populous island of Spain and of Macaronesia.

Approximately six million tourists visit Tenerife each year, making it the most visited island in the archipelago. It is one of the most important tourist destinations in Spain and the world, hosting one of the world&#x27;s largest carnivals, the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

The capital of the island, , is also the seat of the island council (). That city and are the co-capitals of the autonomous community of the Canary Islands. The two cities are both home to governmental institutions, such as the offices of the presidency and the ministries. This has been the arrangement since 1927, when the Crown ordered it. (After the 1833 territorial division of Spain, until 1927, Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands). Santa Cruz contains the modern , the architectural symbol of the Canary Islands.

The island is home to the University of La Laguna. Founded in 1792 in , it is the oldest university in the Canaries. The city of La Laguna is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It is the second most populous city on the island, and the third most populous in the archipelago. It was the capital of the Canary Islands before Santa Cruz replaced it in 1833. Tenerife is served by two airports; Tenerife North Airport and Tenerife South Airport.

Teide National Park, located in the center of the island, is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site. It includes Mount Teide, which has the highest elevation in Spain, and the highest elevation among all the islands in the Atlantic Ocean. It is also the third-largest volcano in the world, when measured from its base. Another geographical feature of the island, the (massif), has been designated as a UNESCO Biosphere Reserve since 2015. Tenerife also has the largest number of endemic species in Europe.

== Toponymy ==

The name &#x27;Tenerife&#x27; likely comes from Tamazight, but there is no consensus on its correct interpretation.
The island&#x27;s indigenous people, the Guanche Berbers, referred to the island as or in their language (variant spellings are found in the literature). According to Pliny the Younger, Berber king Juba II sent an expedition to the Canary Islands and Madeira; he named the Canary Islands for the particularly ferocious dogs () on the island. Juba II and the ancient Romans called the island of Tenerife , from the Latin word (nsg.; gsg. , npl. ), meaning &quot;snow&quot;, after the snow-covered peak of the Mount Teide volcano. Later maps dating to the 14th and 15th century, drawn by mapmakers such as Bontier and Le Verrier, called the island , (&quot;Hell Island&quot;), due to Mount Teide&#x27;s volcanic eruptions and other volcanic activity.

Although the name given to the island by the (the indigenous peoples of La Palma) was derived from the words (&quot;mountain&quot;) and (&quot;white&quot;), after the island was colonized by the Spanish the name was modified by Spanish phonology: the letter &quot;r&quot; was added to link the two words, producing the single word Tenerife.

However, throughout history, other explanations for the origin of island&#x27;s name have been proposed. For example, the 17th-century historians and , among others, suggested that the indigenous peoples might have named the island for the famous Guanche king, Tinerfe, nicknamed &quot;the Great&quot;, who ruled Tenerife before the Canary Islands were conquered by Castile.

== Demonym ==

The formal demonym used to refer to the people of Tenerife is ; also used colloquially is the term . In modern society, the latter term is generally applied only to inhabitants of the capital, Santa Cruz. The term was once a derogatory term used by the people of La Laguna when it was the capital, to refer to the poorer inhabitants and fishermen of Santa Cruz. The fishermen typically caught mackerel and other residents ate potatoes, assumed to be of low quality by the elite of La Laguna. As Santa Cruz grew in commerce and status, it replaced La Laguna as capital of Tenerife in 1833 during the reign of Fernando VII. Then the inhabitants of Santa Cruz used the former insult to identify as residents of the new capital, at La Laguna&#x27;s expense.

== History ==

The earliest known human settlement in the islands, dating to around 200 BCE, was established by Berbers known as the Guanches. However, the Cave of the Guanches in the northern municipality of Icod de los Vinos has provided the oldest chronologies of the Canary Islands, with dates around the sixth century BCE.

In terms of technology, the Guanches can be placed among the peoples of the Stone Age, although scholars often reject this classification because of its ambiguity. Guanche culture was more advanced culturally, possibly because of Berber cultural features imported from North Africa, but less technologically advanced due to the scarcity of raw materials, especially minerals that would have allowed for the extraction and working of metals. The main activity was gathering food from nature; though fishing and shellfish collection were supplemented with some agricultural practices.

As for religion and cosmology, the Guanches were polytheistic, with further widespread belief in an astral cult. They also had an animistic religiosity that sacralized certain places, mainly rocks and mountains. Although the Guanches worshiped many gods and ancestral spirits, among the most important were Achamán (the god of the sky and supreme creator), Chaxiraxi (the mother goddess, identified later with the Virgin of Candelaria), Magec (the god of the sun), and Guayota (the demon who is the main cause of evil). Especially significant was the cult of the dead, which practiced the mummification of corpses. In addition, small anthropomorphic and zoomorphic stone and clay figurines of the kind typically associated with rituals have been found on the island. Scholars believe they were used as idols, the most prominent of which is the so-called Idol of Guatimac, which is thought to represent a genius or protective spirit.

=== Territorial organisation before the conquest (The Guanches) ===
The title of &quot;mencey&quot; was given to the monarch or king of the Guanches of Tenerife, who governed a &quot;menceyato&quot; or kingdom. This role was later referred to as a &quot;captainship&quot; by the conquerors. Tinerfe &quot;the Great&quot;, son of the &quot;mencey&quot; Sunta, governed the island from Adeje in the south. However, upon his death, his nine children rebelled and argued bitterly about how to divide the island.

Two independent &quot;achimenceyatos&quot; were created on the island, and the island was divided into nine &quot;menceyatos&quot;. The &quot;menceyes&quot; within them formed what would be similar to municipalities today. The &quot;menceyatos&quot; and their &quot;menceyes&quot; (ordered by the names of descendants of Tinerfe who ruled them) were the following:

* Taoro. &quot;Menceyes&quot;: Bentinerfe, Inmobach, Bencomo and Bentor. Today it includes Puerto de la Cruz, La Orotava, La Victoria de Acentejo, La Matanza de Acentejo, Los Realejos and Santa Úrsula.
* Güímar. &quot;Menceyes&quot;: Acaymo, Añaterve y Guetón. Today this territory is made up of El Rosario, Candelaria, Arafo and Güímar
* Abona. &quot;Menceyes&quot;: Atguaxoña and Adxoña (Adjona). Today it includes Fasnia, Arico, Granadilla de Abona, San Miguel de Abona and Arona.
* Anaga. &quot;Menceyes&quot;: Beneharo and Beneharo II. Today this territory spans the municipalities of Santa Cruz de Tenerife and San Cristóbal de La Laguna.
* Tegueste. &quot;Menceyes&quot;: Tegueste, Tegueste II y Teguaco. Today this territory is made up of Tegueste, part of the coastal zone of La Laguna.
* Tacoronte: &quot;Menceyes&quot;: Rumén and Acaymo. Today this territory is made up of Tacoronte and El Sauzal
* Icode. &quot;Menceyes&quot;: Chincanayro and Pelicar. Today this territory is made up of San Juan de la Rambla, La Guancha, Garachico and Icod de los Vinos.
* Daute. &quot;Menceyes&quot;: Cocanaymo and Romen. Today this territory is occupied by El Tanque, Los Silos, Buenavista del Norte and Santiago del Teide.
* Adeje. &quot;Menceyes&quot;. Atbitocazpe, Pelinor, and Ichasagua. It included what today are the municipalities of Guía de Isora, Adeje and Vilaflor

The achimenceyato of Punta del Hidalgo was governed by Aguahuco, a &quot;poor noble&quot; who was an illegitimate son of Tinerfe and Zebenzui.

=== Spanish conquest ===

Tenerife was the last island of the Canaries to be conquered and the one that took the longest time to submit to the Castilian troops. Although the traditional dates of the conquest of Tenerife are established between 1494 (landing of Alonso Fernández de Lugo) and 1496 (the complete conquest of the island), attempts to annex the island of Tenerife to the Crown of Castile date back at least to 1464.

In 1464, Diego Garcia de Herrera, Lord of the Canary Islands, took symbolic possession of the island in the &quot;Barranco del Bufadero&quot; (Ravine of the Bufadero), signing a peace treaty with the Guanche chiefs (&quot;menceyes&quot;) which allowed the &quot;mencey&quot; Anaga to build a fortified tower on Guanche land, where the Guanches and the Spanish held periodic treaty talks until the Guanches demolished it around 1472.

In 1492 the governor of Gran Canaria Francisco Maldonado organized a raid that ended in disaster for the Spaniards when they were defeated by Anaga&#x27;s warriors. In December 1493, the Catholic monarchs, Queen Isabella I of Castile and King Ferdinand II of Aragon, granted Alonso Fernández de Lugo the right to conquer Tenerife. Coming from Gran Canaria in April 1494, the conqueror landed on the coast of present-day Santa Cruz de Tenerife in May, and disembarked with about 2,000 men on foot and 200 on horseback. After taking the fort, the army prepared to move inland, later capturing the native kings of Tenerife and presenting them to Isabella and Ferdinand.

The &quot;menceyes&quot; of Tenerife had differing responses to the conquest. They divided into the &quot;side of peace&quot; () and the &quot;side of war&quot; (). The first included the &quot;menceyatos&quot; of Anaga, Güímar, Abona and Adeje. The second group consisted of the people of Tegueste, Tacoronte, Taoro, Icoden and Daute. Those opposed to the conquest fought the invaders tenaciously, resisting their rule for two years. Castillian forces under the &quot;Adelantado&quot; (&quot;military governor&quot;) de Lugo suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of the Guanches in the First Battle of Acentejo on 31 May 1494, but defeated them at the Second Battle of Acentejo on 25 December 1494. The Guanches were eventually overcome by superior technology and the arms of the invaders, and surrendered to the Crown of Castile in 1496.

=== Spanish rule ===

Many of the natives died from new infectious diseases, such as influenza and probably smallpox, to which they lacked resistance or acquired immunity. The new colonists intermarried with the local native population. For a century after the conquest, many new colonists settled on the island, including immigrants from the diverse territories of the growing Spanish Empire, such as Flanders, Italy, and Germany.

As the population grew, it cleared Tenerife&#x27;s pine forests for fuel and to make fields for agriculture for crops both for local consumption and for export. Sugar cane was introduced in the 1520s as a commodity crop on major plantations; it was a labor-intensive crop in all phases of cultivation and processing. In the following centuries, planters cultivated wine grapes, cochineal for making dyes, and plantains for use and export.

=== Trade with the Americas ===

In the commerce of the Canary Islands with the Americas of the 18th century, Tenerife was the hegemonic island, since it exceeded 50% of the number of ships and 60% of the tonnage. In the islands of La Palma and Gran Canaria, the percentage was around 19% for the first and 7% for the second. The volume of traffic between the Indies and the Canary Islands was unknown, but was very important and concentrated almost exclusively in Tenerife.

Among the products that are exported were cochineal, rum and sugar cane, which were landed mainly in the ports of the Americas such as La Guaira, Havana, Campeche and Veracruz. Many sailors from Tenerife joined this transcontinental maritime trade, among which the corsair Amaro Rodríguez Felipe, more commonly known as &quot;Amaro Pargo&quot;, Juan Pedro Dujardín and Bernardo de Espinosa, both companions of Amaro Pargo, among others.

=== Emigration to the Americas ===

Tenerife, like the other islands, has maintained a close relationship with Latin America, as both were part of the Spanish Empire. From the start of the colonization of the New World, many Spanish expeditions stopped at the island for supplies on their way to the Americas. They also recruited many &quot;tinerfeños&quot; for their crews, who formed an integral part of the conquest expeditions. Others joined ships in search of better prospects. It is also important to note the exchange in plant and animal species that made those voyages.

After a century and a half of relative growth, based on the grape growing sector, numerous families emigrated, especially to Venezuela and Cuba. The Crown wanted to encourage population of underdeveloped zones in the Americas to pre-empt the occupation by foreign forces, as had happened with the English in Jamaica and the French in the Guianas and western Hispaniola (which the French renamed as Saint-Domingue). Canary Islanders, including many &quot;tinerfeños,&quot; left for the New World.

The success in cultivation of new crops of the Americas, such as cocoa in Venezuela and tobacco in Cuba, contributed to the population exodus from towns such as Buenavista del Norte, Vilaflor, or El Sauzal in the late 17th century. The village of San Carlos de Tenerife was founded in 1684 by Canary Islanders on Santo Domingo. The people from Tenerife were recruited for settlement to build up the town from encroachment by French colonists established in the western side of Hispaniola. Between 1720 and 1730, the Crown moved 176 families, including many &quot;tinerfeños,&quot; to the Caribbean island of Puerto Rico. In 1726, about 25 island families migrated to the Americas to collaborate on the foundation of Montevideo. Four years later, in 1730, another group left that founded San Antonio the following year in what became Texas. Between 1777 and 1783, more islanders emigrated from Santa Cruz de Tenerife to settle in what became St. Bernard Parish, Louisiana, during the period when Spain ruled this former French territory west of the Mississippi River. Some groups went to Western or Spanish Florida.
Tenerife saw the arrival of the First Fleet to Botany Bay in June 1787, which consisted of 11 ships that departed from Portsmouth, England, on 13 May 1787 to found the penal colony that became the first European settlement in Australia. The Fleet consisted of two Royal Navy vessels, three store ships and six convict ships carrying between 1,000 and 1,500 convicts, marines, seamen, civil officers and free people (accounts differ on the numbers), and a vast quantity of stores. On 3 June 1787, the fleet anchored at Santa Cruz at Tenerife. Here, fresh water, vegetables and meat were brought on board. Commander of the fleet, Capt. Arthur Phillip and the chief officers were entertained by the local governor, while one convict tried unsuccessfully to escape. On 10 June they set sail to cross the Atlantic to Rio de Janeiro, taking advantage of favourable trade winds and ocean currents.

In June 1799, the Prussian-born naturalist Alexander von Humboldt spent five full days on Tenerife on the first leg of his soon world-famous American journey (1799–1804) and climbed the Pico del Teide.

Emigration to the Americas (mainly Cuba and Venezuela) continued during the 19th and early 20th century, due to the lack of economic opportunity and the relative isolation of the Canary Islands. Since the late 20th century, island protectionist economic laws and a strong development in the tourism industry have strengthened the economy and attracted new migrants. Tenerife has received numerous new residents, including the &quot;return&quot; of many descendants of some islanders who had departed five centuries before.

=== Military history ===

The most notable conflict was the British invasion of Tenerife in 1797. On 25 July 1797, Admiral Horatio Nelson launched an attack at Santa Cruz de Tenerife, now the capital of the island. After a ferocious fight which resulted in many casualties, General Antonio Gutiérrez de Otero y Santayana organized a defense to repel the invaders. Whilst leading a landing party, Nelson was seriously wounded in his right arm by grapeshot or a musket ball, necessitating amputation of most of the arm. Legend tells that he was wounded by the Spanish cannon &quot;Tiger&quot; () as he was trying to disembark on the Paso Alto coast.

On 5 September 1797, the British attempted another attack in the Puerto Santiago region, which was repelled by the inhabitants of Santiago del Teide. Some threw rocks at the British from the heights of the cliffs of &quot;Los Gigantes.&quot;

The island was also attacked by British commanders Robert Blake, Walter Raleigh, John Hawkins and Woodes Rogers.

=== Modern history ===
From 1833 to 1927, Santa Cruz de Tenerife was the sole capital of the Canary Islands. In 1927, the government ordered that the capital be shared with Las Palmas, as it remains at present. This change in status has encouraged development in Las Palmas.

Tourists began visiting Tenerife from Spain, the United Kingdom, and northern Europe in large numbers in the 1890s. They especially were attracted to the destinations of the northern towns of Puerto de la Cruz and Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Independent shipping business, such as the Yeoward Brothers Shipping Line, helped boost the tourist industry during this time, adding to ships that carried passengers. The naturalist Alexander von Humboldt ascended the peak of Mount Teide and remarked on the beauty of the island.

Before his rise to power, Francisco Franco was posted to Tenerife in March 1936 by a Republican government wary of his influence and political leanings. However, Franco received information and in Gran Canaria agreed to collaborate in the military coup that would result in the Spanish Civil War; the Canaries fell to the Nationalists in July 1936. In the 1950s, the misery of the post-war years caused thousands of the island&#x27;s inhabitants to emigrate to Cuba and other parts of Latin America.

Tenerife was the site of the deadliest accident ever in commercial aviation. The Tenerife airport disaster occurred on 27 March 1977 when two Boeing 747s, KLM Flight 4805 and Pan Am Flight 1736 collided on the runway at Los Rodeos Airport in heavy fog conditions, causing the deaths of 583 passengers and crew. A few years later, Dan Air Flight 1008 crashed into a mountain while on approach to Tenerife North, killing 146 people. The plane was travelling too close to an Iberia Air turboprop plane and was asked to go into a holding pattern.

At the beginning of the 21st century, the so-called &quot;Tenerife flood of 2002&quot; took place on 31 March of that year. It was a phenomenon of cold drop characterized by the repeated fall of torrential rains accompanied by thunder and lightning, affecting the Santa Cruz de Tenerife metropolitan area and extending in the NE direction towards the San Andrés area. The rains caused 8 dead, 12 missing and dozens of injured. In addition to the human losses, the flood caused considerable material damage, 70,000 people without light as well as the total or partial destruction of at least 400 homes. The losses were calculated at 90 million euros.

In November 2005, Tenerife was the Canary Island most affected by Tropical Storm Delta. Winds of 140 km/h were recorded on the coast and almost 250 km/h on the Teide, Tenerife&#x27;s summit.

== Geography ==
The oldest mountain ranges in Tenerife rose from the Atlantic Ocean by volcanic eruption which gave birth to the island around twelve million years ago. The island as it is today was formed three million years ago by the fusion of three islands made up of the mountain ranges of Anaga, Teno and Valle de San Lorenzo, due to volcanic activity from Teide. The volcano is visible from most parts of the island today, and the crater is long at some points. Tenerife is the largest island of the Canary Islands and the Macaronesia region.

=== Climate ===

Tenerife is characterized by a generally dry, warm climate. The island has two main different climatic areas, as by Köppen climate classification).

The main climates are the hot semi-arid/arid climate (Köppen: &quot;BSh&quot; and &quot;BWh&quot;) and the subtropical Mediterranean Climate (Köppen: &quot;Csb&quot; and &quot;Csa&quot;) inland or at higher altitudes. The low altitude/coastal areas of the island have average temperatures of in the winter months and in the summer months. There is a high annual total of days of sunshine and low precipitation in the coastal areas. The inland/high altitude areas, such as La Laguna, are wetter, cloudier and cooler, with an average of in the winter and in the summer. The moderate climate of Tenerife is controlled to a great extent by the trade winds, whose humidity is condensed principally over the north and northeast of the island, creating cloud banks that range between in height. The cold sea currents of the Canary Islands also have a cooling effect on the coasts and its beaches, while the topography of the landscape plays a role in climatic differences on the island with its many valleys. The moderating effect of the marine air makes extreme heat a rare occurrence and frost an impossibility at sea level. The lowest recorded temperature in central Santa Cruz is , the coldest month on record still had a relatively mild average temperature of . Summer temperatures are highest in August, with an average high of in Santa Cruz, similar to those of places as far north as Barcelona and Majorca, because of the greater maritime influence. At a higher elevation in San Cristóbal de La Laguna, the climate transitions to a Mediterranean climate with higher precipitation amounts and lower temperatures year round. The climate of Santa Cruz is very typical of the Canaries, albeit only slightly warmer than the climate of Las Palmas.

Major climatic contrasts on the island are evident, especially during the winter months when it is possible to enjoy the warm sunshine on the coast and experience snow within above sea level on Teide. There are also major contrasts at low altitude, where the climate ranges from arid (Köppen &quot;BWh&quot;) on the southeastern side represented by Santa Cruz de Tenerife to Mediterranean (&quot;Csa&quot;/&quot;Csb&quot;) on the northwestern side in Buenavista del Norte and La Orotava.

The north and south of Tenerife similarly have different climatic characteristics because of the rain shadow effect. The windward northwestern side of the island is wetter, receiving 73 per cent of all precipitation on the island, and the relative humidity of the air is superior and the insolation inferior. The greatest rainfall measurements are registered on the windward side between , almost exclusively in the La Orotava mountain range. Although climatic differences in rainfall and sunshine on the island exist, overall annual precipitation is low and the summer months from May to September are normally completely dry. Rainfall, similar to that of Southern California, can also be extremely erratic from one year to another.

The centre of the island is characterized by forests because of the much higher precipitation, mostly Canary Island pine forests in the Teide National Park at altitudes from . Subtropical cloud forests characterised by laurisilva are commonly found in the Anaga Rural Park and Monte de Agua in the Teno Rural Park, with altitudes from and annual averages from and in the latter.

Global climate change has had a major impact on the island, with diminishing rainfall and hot, dry winds affecting vegetation and contributing to an increasing propensity to being subject to forest fires. On 15 August 2023, a forest fire determined to be caused by arson necessitated the evacuation of 12,000 residents within a week.

=== Water ===
The volcanic ground of Tenerife, which is of a porous and permeable character, is generally the reason why the soil is able to maximise the absorption of water on an island of low rainfall, with condensation in forested areas and frost deposition on the summit of the island also contributory causes.

Given the irregularity of precipitation and geological conditions on the island, dam construction has been avoided, so most of the water (90 percent) comes from wells and from water galleries (horizontal tunnels bored into the volcano) of which there are thousands on the island, important systems that serve to extract its hydrological resources. These tunnels are very hazardous, with pockets of volcanic gas or carbon dioxide, causing rapid death.

=== Pollution and air quality ===
The Canary Islands have low levels of air pollution thanks to the lack of factories and industry and the trade winds which naturally move away contaminated air from the islands. According to official data offered by the Health and Industry Ministry in Spain, Tenerife is one of the cleanest places in the country with an air pollution index below the national average. Despite this, there are still agents which affect pollution levels in the island, the main polluting agents being the refinery at Santa Cruz, the thermal power plants at Las Caletillas and Granadilla, and road traffic, increased by the high level of tourism in the island. In addition on the island of Tenerife like on La Palma light pollution must be also controlled, to help the astrophysical observatories located in the island&#x27;s summits.
Water is generally of a very high quality, and all the beaches of the island of Tenerife have been catalogued by the Ministry of Health and Consumption as waters suitable for bathing.

== Geology ==
Tenerife is a rugged volcanic island, sculpted by successive eruptions throughout its history. There are four historically recorded volcanic eruptions, none of which has led to casualties. The first occurred in 1704, when the Arafo, Fasnia and Siete Fuentes volcanoes erupted simultaneously. Two years later, in 1706, the greatest eruption occurred at Trevejo. This volcano produced great quantities of lava which buried the city and port of Garachico. The last eruption of the 18th century happened in 1798 at Cañadas de Teide, in Chahorra. The most recent eruption-in 1909-formed the Chinyero cinder cone in the municipality of Santiago del Teide.

The island is located between 28° and 29° N and the 16° and 17° W meridian. It is situated north of the Tropic of Cancer, occupying a central position between the other Canary Islands of Gran Canaria, La Gomera and La Palma. The island is about from the African coast, and approximately from the Iberian Peninsula. Tenerife is the largest island of the Canary Islands archipelago, with a surface area of and has the longest coastline, amounting to .

In addition, the highest point, Mount Teide, with an elevation of above sea level is the highest point in all of Spain, is also the third largest volcano in the world from its base in the bottom of the sea. For this reason, Tenerife is the 10th-highest island worldwide. It comprises about 200 small barren islets or large rocks including Roques de Anaga, Roque de Garachico, and Fasnia adding a further to the total area.

=== Origins and geological formation ===

Tenerife is a volcanic island that has built up from the ocean floor during the last 20 million years.

Underwater fissural eruptions produced pillow lava, which are produced by the rapid cooling of the magma when it comes in contact with water, obtaining their peculiar shape. This pillow-lava accumulated, constructing the base of the island underneath the sea. As this accumulation approached the surface of the water, gases erupted from the magma due to the reduction of the surrounding pressure. The volcanic eruptions became more violent and had a more explosive character, and resulted in the forming of peculiar geological fragments.

After long-term accumulation of these fragments, the birth of the island occurred at the end of the Miocene epoch. The zones on Tenerife known as Macizo de Teno, Macizo de Anaga and Macizo de Adeje were formed seven million years ago; these formations are called the &quot;Ancient Basaltic Series&quot; or &quot;Series I&quot;. These zones were actually three separate islands lying in what is now the extreme west, east, and south of Tenerife.

A second volcanic cycle called the &quot;Post-Miocene Formations&quot; or &quot;Latest Series II, III, IV&quot; began three million years ago. This was a much more intense volcanic cycle, which united the Macizo de Teno, Macizo de Anaga and Macizo de Adeje into one island. This new structure, called the &quot;Pre-Cañadas Structure&quot; (&quot;Edificio pre-Cañadas&quot;), would be the foundation for what is called the &quot;Cañadas Structure I&quot;. The Cañadas Structure I experienced various collapses and emitted explosive material that produced the area known as &quot;Bandas del sur&quot; (in the present-day south-southeast of Tenerife).

Subsequently, upon the ruins of Cañadas Structure I emerged &quot;Cañadas Structure II&quot;, which was above sea level and emerged with intense explosive activity. About one million years ago, the Dorsal Range (&quot;Cordillera Dorsal&quot;) emerged by means of fissural volcanic activity occurring amidst the remains of the older Ancient Basaltic Series (Series I). This Dorsal Range emerged as the highest and the longest volcanic structure in the Canary Islands; it was high and long.

About 800,000 years ago, two gravitational landslides occurred, giving rise to the present-day valleys of La Orotava and Güímar. Finally, around 200,000 years ago, the giant Icod landslide occurred followed by eruptions that raised the &quot;Pico Viejo-Teide&quot; in the centre of the island, over the &quot;Las Cañadas caldera&quot;.

=== Orography and landscape ===
The uneven and steep orography of the island and its variety of climates has resulted in a diversity of landscapes and geographical and geological formations, from the Teide National Park with its extensive pine forests, juxtaposed against the volcanic landscape at the summit of Teide and Malpaís de Güímar, to the Acantilados de Los Gigantes (Cliffs of the Giants) with its vertical precipices. Semidesert areas exist in the south with drought-resistant plants. Other areas range from those protected and enclosed in mountains such as Montaña Roja and Montaña Pelada, the valleys and forests with subtropical vegetation and climate, to those with deep gorges and precipices such as at Anaga and Teno.

==== Central heights ====
The principal structures in Tenerife, make the central highlands, with the Teide–Pico Viejo complex and the Las Cañadas areas as most prominent. It comprises a semi-caldera of about in area, originated by several geological processes explained under the &quot;Origin and formation&quot; section. The area is partially occupied by the Teide-Pico Viejo strato-volcano and completed by the materials emitted in the different eruptions that took place. A known formation called &quot;Los Azulejos&quot;, composed by green-tinted rocks were created by hydrothermal processes.

South of La Caldera is Guajara Mountain, which has an elevation of , rising above Teide National Park. At the bottom, is an endorheic basin flanked with very fine sedimentary material which has been deposited from its volcanic processes, and is known as Llano de Ucanca.

The peak of Teide, at above sea level and more than above the ocean floor, is the highest point of the island, Spanish territory and in the Atlantic Ocean. The volcano is the third largest on the planet, and its central location, substantial size, looming silhouette in the distance and its snowy landscape in winter give it a unique nature. The original settlers considered Teide a god and Teide was a place of worship.

In 1954, the whole area around it was declared a national park, with further expansion later on. In addition, in June 2007 it was recognised by UNESCO as a World Heritage site. To the west lies the volcano Pico Viejo (Old Peak). On one side of it, is the volcano Chahorra o Narices del Teide, where the last eruption occurred in the vicinity of Mount Teide in 1798.

The Teide is one of the 16 Decade Volcanoes identified by the International Association of Volcanology and Chemistry of the Earth&#x27;s Interior (IAVCEI) as being worthy of particular study in light of their history of large, destructive eruptions and proximity to populated areas.

Tallest mountains on Tenerife:
==== Massifs ====

The Anaga massif (&quot;Macizo de Anaga&quot;), at the northeastern end of the island, has an irregular and rugged topographical profile where, despite its generally modest elevations, the Cruz de Taborno reaches a height of . Due to the age of its material (5.7 million years), its deep erosive processes, and the dense network of dikes piercing the massif, its surface exposes numerous outcroppings of both phonolitic and trachytic origin. A large number of steep-walled gorges are present, penetrating deeply into the terrain. Vertical cuts dominate the Anagan coast, with infrequent beaches of rocks or black sand between them; the few that exist generally coincide with the mouths of gorges.

The Teno massif (&quot;Macizo de Teno&quot;) is located on the northwestern edge of the island. Like Anaga, it includes an area of outcroppings and deep gorges formed by erosion. However, the materials here are older (about 7.4 million years old). Mount Gala represents its highest elevation at . The most unusual landscape of this massif is found on its southern coast, where the Acantilados de Los Gigantes (&quot;Cliffs of the Giants&quot;) present vertical walls reaching heights of in some places.

The Adeje massif (&quot;Macizo de Adeje&quot;) is situated on the southern tip of the island. Its main landmark is the Roque del Conde (&quot;Count&#x27;s Rock&quot;), with an elevation of . This massif is not as impressive as the others due to its diminished initial structure, since in addition to with the site&#x27;s greater geologic age it has experienced severe erosion of its material, thereby losing its original appearance and extent.

==== Dorsals ====
The Dorsal mountain ridge or &quot;Dorsal of Pedro Gil&quot; covers the area from the start at Mount La Esperanza, at a height of about , to the center of the island, near the &quot;Caldera de Las Cañadas&quot;, with Izaña, as its highest point at (MSLP). These mountains have been created due to basaltic fissural volcanism through one of the axis that gave birth to the vulcanism of this area.

The Abeque Dorsal was formed by a chain of volcanoes that join the Teno with the central insular peak of Teide-Pico Viejo starting from another of the three axis of Tenerife&#x27;s geological structures. On this dorsal we find the historic volcano of Chinyero whose last eruption happened in 1909.

The South Dorsal or &quot;Dorsal of Adeje&quot; is part of the last of the structural axis. The remains of this massive rock show the primordial land, also showing the alignment of small volcanic cones and rocks around this are in Tenerife&#x27;s South.

==== Valleys and ravines ====
Valleys are another of the island&#x27;s features. The most important are Valle de La Orotava and Valle de Güímar, both formed by the mass sliding of great quantities of material towards the sea, creating a depression of the land. Other valleys tend to be between hills formed by deposits of sediments from nearby slopes, or simply wide ravines which in their evolution have become typical valleys.

Tenerife has a large number of ravines, which are a characteristic element of the landscape, caused by erosion from surface runoff over a long period. Notable ravines include Ruiz, Fasnia and Güímar, Infierno, and Erques, all of which have been designated protected natural areas by Canarian institutions.
==== Coastline ====
The coasts of Tenerife are typically rugged and steep, particularly on the north of the island. However, the island has of beaches, such as the one at El Médano, surpassed only in this respect by the island of Fuerteventura. There are many black sand pebble beaches on the northern coast, while on the south and south-west coast of the island, the beaches have typically much finer and clearer sand with lighter tones.

==== Volcanic tubes ====
Lava tubes are volcanic caves usually in the form of tunnels formed within lava flows more or less fluid reogenética duration of the activity. Among the many existing volcanic tubes on the island stands out the Cueva del Viento, located in the northern town of Icod de los Vinos, which is the largest volcanic tunnel in the European Union and one of the largest in the world, for a long time considered the largest in the world.

== Flora and fauna ==
The island of Tenerife has a remarkable ecosystem diversity in spite of its small surface area, which is a consequence of the special environmental conditions on the island, where its distinct orography modifies the general climatic conditions at a local level, producing a significant variety of microclimates. This diversity of microclimates allows some 1400 species of plants to exist on the island, with well over 100 of these endemic to Tenerife. The fauna of Tenerife includes some 400 species of fish, 56 birds, five reptiles, two amphibians, 13 land mammals, thousands of invertebrates, and several species of sea turtles and cetaceans.

The vegetation of Tenerife can be divided into six major zones that are directly related to altitude and the direction in which they face.

* Lower xerophytic zone: . Xerophytic shrubs that are well adapted to long dry spells, intense sunshine and strong winds. Many endemic species: spurges, cactus spurge (&quot;Euphorbia canariensis&quot;), wax plants (&quot;Ceropegia&quot; spp.), etc.
* Thermophile forest: . Transition zone with moderate temperatures and rainfall, but the area has been deteriorated by human activity. Many endemic species: juniper (&quot;Juniperus cedrus&quot;), dragon trees (&quot;Dracaena draco&quot;), palm trees (&quot;Phoenix canariensis&quot;), etc.
* Laurel forest: . Dense forest of large trees, descendants of tertiary age flora, situated in a zone of frequent rainfall and mists. A wide variety of species with abundant undergrowth of bushes, herbaceous plants, and ferns. Laurels, holly (&quot;Ilex canariensis&quot;), ebony (&quot;Persea indica&quot;), mahogany (&quot;Apollonias barbujana&quot;), etc.
* Wax myrtle: . A dryer vegetation, poorer in species. It replaces the degraded laurel forest. Of great forestry importance. Wax myrtles (&quot;Myrica faya&quot;), tree heath (&quot;Erica arborea&quot;), holly, etc.
* Pine forest: . Open pine forest, with thin and unvaried undergrowth. Canary Island pine (&quot;Pinus canariensis&quot;), broom (&quot;Genista canariensis&quot;), rock rose (&quot;Cistus&quot; spp.), etc.
* High mountain: over . Dry climate, intense solar radiation and extreme temperatures. Flora well adapted to the conditions.
=== Prehistoric fauna ===
Before the arrival of humans, the Canary Islands were inhabited by certain endemic animals, now mostly extinct. These animals reached larger than usual sizes, because of a phenomenon called island gigantism. Among these species, the best known in Tenerife were:
* The giant rat (&quot;Canariomys bravoi&quot;): Fossils mostly dating from the Pliocene and Pleistocene. Its skull reached up to 7 centimeters long, so it could have reached the size of a rabbit, which would make it quite large compared to European species of rats. Tenerife Giant Rat fossils usually occur in caves and volcanic tubes associated with &quot;Gallotia goliath&quot;.
* The slender-billed greenfinch (&quot;Chloris aurelioi&quot;), an extinct greenfinch from the Holocene.
* The long-legged bunting (&quot;Emberiza alcoveri&quot;), a flightless bunting with long legs and short wings known from Pleistocene to Holocene cave deposits, and one of the few flightless passerines known to science, all of which are now extinct.
* The giant lizard (&quot;Gallotia goliath&quot;) inhabited Tenerife from the Holocene until the fifteenth century AD. It was a specimen reaching a length of 120 to 125 centimeters (47.2 to 49.2 inches).
* The giant tortoise (&quot;Geochelone burchardi&quot;): A large tortoise, similar to those currently found in some oceanic islands like the Galápagos Islands in the Pacific Ocean and the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean. Remains found date from the Miocene; this tortoise may have inhabited the island until the Upper Pleistocene, apparently becoming extinct because of volcanic events long before the arrival of humans. Its shell measured approximately .
=== Protected natural areas ===

Nearly half of the island territory (48.6 percent), is under protection from the Red Canaria de Espacios Naturales Protegidos (Canary Islands Network for Protected Natural Areas). Of the 146 protected sites under control of network in the Canary Islands archipelago, a total of 43 are located in Tenerife, the most protected island in the group. The network has criteria which places areas under its observation under eight different categories of protection, all of them are represented in Tenerife. Aside from Parque Nacional del Teide, it counts the Parque Natural de Canarias (Crown Forest), two rural parks (Anaga and Teno), four integral natural reserves, six special natural reserves, a total of fourteen natural monuments, nine protected landscapes and up to six sites of scientific interest. Also located on the island Macizo de Anaga since 2015 is Biosphere Reserve and is the place that has the largest number of endemic species in Europe.

In contrast to the land-based protected areas, Tenerife also boasts significant marine protected natural areas. Among these is the Zona de Especial Conservación Teno-Rasca (Teno-Rasca Special Area of Conservation), a marine protected area established in 2013. This marine protected area off the coast of Tenerife is known for its ecological significance and biodiversity, including resident populations of cetaceans such as bottlenose dolphins and pilot whales. It is also known as the Tenerife-La Gomera Marine Area and became the first European designated Whale Heritage Area in January 2021.

== Administration ==

=== Law and order ===

Tenerife island&#x27;s government resides with the Cabildo Insular de Tenerife located at the Plaza de España at the island&#x27;s capital city (Palacio Insular de Tenerife). The political Canary organization does not have a provincial government body but instead each island has its own government at their own Cabildo. Since its creation in March 1913 it has a series of capabilities and duties, stated in the Canary Autonomy Statutes () and regulated by Law 14/1990, of 26 July 1990, of the &quot;Régimen Jurídico de las Administraciones Públicas de Canarias&quot;.

The Cabildo is composed of the following administrative offices; Presidency, Legislative Body, Government Council, Informative Commissions, Spokesman&#x27;s office.

=== Government ===
Tenerife is an autonomous territory of Spain. The island has a tiered-government system and a special status within the European Union in which it holds lower tax rates compared to other regions. Santa Cruz is the seat of half of the regional government departments and parliament and it is there that the governor is elected by the Canarian people. Afterwards, they are appointed by Madrid. There are fifteen members of parliament who work together in passing legislation, organising budgets and improving the economy.

=== Municipalities ===
The island, itself part of a Spanish province named Santa Cruz de Tenerife, is divided administratively into 31 municipalities. It is the island with the most municipalities in the Canary archipelago.

Only three municipalities are landlocked: Tegueste, El Tanque and Vilaflor. Vilaflor is the municipality with the highest altitude in the Canaries (its capital is high).

The largest municipality with an area of is La Orotava, which covers much of the Teide National Park. The smallest town on the island and of the archipelago is Puerto de la Cruz, with an area of just .

It is also common to find internal division, in that some cities make up a metropolitan area within a municipality, notably the cities of Santa Cruz and La Laguna.

Below is an alphabetical list of all the municipalities on the island:


=== Counties ===
The counties of Tenerife have no official recognition, but there is a consensus among geographers about them:

*Abona
*Acentejo
*Anaga
*Valle de Güímar
*Icod
*Isora
*Valle de La Orotava
*Teno
=== Flags and heraldry ===

The flag of Tenerife was originally adopted in 1845 by the navy at its base in the Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. Later, and at present, this flag represents all the island of Tenerife. It was approved by the Cabildo Insular de Tenerife and the Order of the Government of the Canary Islands on 9 May 1989 and published on 22 May in the government report of the Canary Islands and made official.

The coat-of-arms of Tenerife was granted by royal decree on 23 March 1510 by Ferdinand II at Madrid in the name of Joan I, Queen of Castile. The coat-of-arms has a field of gold, with an image of Saint Michael (patron saint of the island) above a mountain depicted in brownish, natural colors. Flames erupt from the mountain, symbolizing El Teide. Below this mountain is depicted the island itself in vert on top of blue and silver waves. To the right there is a castle in gules, and to the left, a lion rampant in gules. The shield that the Cabildo Insular, or Island Government, uses is slightly different from that used by the city government of La Laguna, which uses a motto in the arms&#x27; border and also includes some palm branches.

== Natural symbols ==

The official natural symbols associated with Tenerife are the bird blue chaffinch (&quot;Fringilla teydea&quot;) and the Canary Islands dragon tree (&quot;Dracaena draco&quot;) tree.

== Demographics ==
According to INE data as at 1 January 2024, Tenerife has the largest population of the seven Canary Islands and was the most populated island of Spain with 964,021 officially estimated inhabitants, of whom about 22.0 percent (211,436) lived in the capital, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and 40 percent in the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz–La Laguna. Santa Cruz de Tenerife and the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna are physically one urban area, so that together (and including Tegueste and El Rosario) they have a population of 581,947 inhabitants.

Tenerife has two other metropolitan areas recognized by the Ministry of Development; the Tenerife South metropolitan area with 215,532 inhabitants (2024) and the La Orotava Valley metropolitan area with 111,606 inhabitants (2024).

After the city of Santa Cruz the major towns and municipalities as at the start of 2024 are San Cristóbal de La Laguna (160,258), Arona (86,624), Granadilla de Abona (57,143), Adeje (50,549), La Orotava (42,585), Los Realejos (37,522) and Puerto de la Cruz (31,377). All other municipalities have fewer than 30,000 inhabitants, the smallest municipality being Vilaflor with a population of 1,501.

The island has high rates of resident population not registered in population censuses, primarily tourists. This has made several sources point out that more than one million inhabitants actually live on the island of Tenerife today. The island is also the most multicultural in the archipelago, with the highest number of registered foreigners (44.9% of registered in Canary Islands), which represent 14% of the total population of the island. Tenerife stands out in the context of the archipelago, by also concentrating the largest presence of non-EU foreign population.

Tenerife has three large population areas that are very different and distributed: The Metropolitan Zone, the South Zone and the North Zone. With several protected natural parks — 48.6% of the territory — and an urban swarm around the island, in the last half century the insular coastal platform has become a highly urbanized metropolitan system. The high level of population in a relatively small territory — more than 900,000 inhabitants in just over — and the strong urbanization have turned the island of Tenerife, in the words of architect Federico García Barba; on an &quot;island-city&quot; or &quot;island-ring&quot;.
Recently Tenerife has experienced population growth significantly higher than the national average. In 1990, there were 663,306 registered inhabitants, which increased to 709,365 in 2000, an increase of 46,059 or an annual growth of 0.69 percent. However, between 2000 and 2007, the population rose by 155,705 to 865,070, an annual increase of 3.14 percent.

These results reflect the general trend in Spain where, since 2000, immigration has reversed the general slowdown in population growth, following the collapse in the birth rate from 1976. However, since 2001 the overall growth rate in Spain has been around 1.7 percent per year, compared with 3.14 percent on Tenerife, one of the largest increases in the country.

== Economy ==

Tenerife is the economic capital of the Canary Islands. At present, Tenerife is the island with the highest GDP in the Canary Islands. Even though Tenerife&#x27;s economy is highly specialized in the service sector, which makes 78% of its total production capacity, the importance of the rest of the economic sectors is key to its production development. In this sense, the primary sector, which only represents 1.98% of the total product, groups activities that are important to the sustainable development of the island&#x27;s economy. The energy sector which contributes 2.85% has a primary role in the development of renewable energy sources. The industrial sector which shares in 5.80% is a growing activity in the island, vis-a-vis the new possibilities created by technological advances. Finally, the construction sector with 11.29% of the total production has a strategic priority, because it is a sector with relative stability which permits multiple possibilities of development and employment opportunities.

=== Tourism ===

Tourism is the most prominent industry in the Canaries, which are one of the major tourist destinations in the world. Tenerife is the most visited island in the archipelago and one of the most important tourist destinations in Spain.

In 2014, 11,473,600 foreign tourists came to the Canary Islands. Tenerife had 4,171,384 arrivals that year, excluding the numbers for Spanish tourists which make up an additional 30% of total arrivals. According to last year&#x27;s Canarian Statistics Centre&#x27;s (ISTAC) Report on Tourism the greatest number of tourists from any one country come from the United Kingdom, with more than 3,980,000 tourists in 2014. In second place comes Germany followed by Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands, France, Ireland, Belgium, Italy, Denmark, Finland, Switzerland, Poland, Russia and Austria.

Tourism is more prevalent in the south of the island, which is hotter and drier and has many well developed resorts such as Playa de las Americas and Los Cristianos. More recently coastal development has spread northwards from Playa de las Americas and now encompasses the former small enclave of La Caleta. According to the &quot;Moratoria&quot; act passed by the Canarian Parliament in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, no more hotels will be built on the island unless they are classified as 5 star-quality and comprise different services such as golf courses or convention facilities. This act was passed with the goal of improving the standard of tourism service and promoting environmentally conscious development.

The area known as Costa Adeje has many facilities and leisure opportunities such as shopping centres, golf courses, restaurants, water parks (the most well-known being Siam Park), animal parks, and a theatre suitable for musicals or a convention centre. There are many boats offering whale watching tours from the harbour of Puerto Colon. The deep waters off the coast of Costa Adeje are home to several pods of pilot whales.

In the more lush and green north of the island, the main focus of development for tourism has been in the town of Puerto de la Cruz. Puerto de la Cruz is home to the SeaWorld-owned zoo, Loro Parque, which has been accused of mistreatment of animals in its captivity, including orcas and is currently boycotted by major travel agents including Thomas Cook.

In the 19th century large numbers of foreign tourists came, especially British, showing interest in the agriculture of the islands. With the world wars, the tourism sector weakened, but the second half of the 20th century brought renewed interest. Initial emphasis was on Puerto de la Cruz, and for all the attractions that the Valle de la Orotava offered. By 1980, tourism was focused in south Tenerife. The emphasis was on cities like Arona or Adeje, shifting to tourist centres like Los Cristianos or Playa de Las Americas, which now house 65% of the hotels on the island. Tenerife receives more than 5 million tourists every year; of the Сanary islands Tenerife is the most popular.
Currently, the municipality of Adeje in the south of the island has the highest concentration of 5 star hotels in Europe and also has what is considered the best luxury hotel in Spain according to &quot;World Travel Awards&quot;.

=== Agriculture and fishing ===

Since tourism dominates the Tenerifan economy, the service sector is the largest. Industry and commerce contribute 40% of the non-tourist economy. Agriculture contributes less than 10% of the island&#x27;s GDP, but its contribution is vital as it also generates indirect benefits by maintaining the rural appearance of the island and supporting Tenerifan cultural values.

Agriculture is centred on the northern slopes, and is affected by altitude as well as orientation: in the coastal zone, tomatoes and bananas are cultivated, these high yield products are for export to mainland Spain and the rest of Europe; in the drier intermediate zone, potatoes, tobacco and maize are grown, whilst in the south, onions are important.

Bananas are a particularly important crop, as Tenerife grows more bananas than the other Canary Islands, with a current annual production of about 150,000 tons, down from the peak production of 200,000 tons in 1986. More than 90% of the total is destined for the international market, and banana growing occupies about 4200 hectares. After the banana the most important crops are, in order of importance, tomatoes, grapes, potatoes and flowers. Fishing is also a major contributor to the Tenerifan economy, as the Canaries are Spain&#x27;s second most important fishing grounds.

===Energy===
As of 2009, Tenerife had 910 MW of electrical generation capacity, which is mostly powered from petroleum-derived fuels. The island had 37 MW of wind turbines and 79 MW of solar panels.

=== Industry and commerce ===
Commerce in Tenerife plays a significant role in the economy, representing almost 20% of the GDP, with the commercial center Santa Cruz de Tenerife generating most of the earnings. Although there are a diversity of industrial estates that exist on the island, the most important industrial activity is petroleum, representing 10% of the island&#x27;s GDP, again largely due to the capital Santa Cruz de Tenerife with its refinery. It provides petroleum products not only to the Canaries archipelago but is also an active in the markets of the Iberian Peninsula, Africa and South America.

== Main sights ==

=== Monuments ===

Historical sights in the island, especially from the time after the conquest, include the Cathedral of San Cristóbal de La Laguna, the Church of the Conception of La Laguna and the Church of the Conception in the capital. The Basílica de Nuestra Senora de la Candelaria can be found on the island (Patron of Canary Islands). Also on the island are the defensive castles located in the village of San Andrés, as well as many others throughout the island.

The Auditorio de Tenerife, one of the most modern in Spain, can be found at the entry port to the capital (in the southern part of Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife). Near the Auditorio de Tenerife are El Castillo Negro and El Parque Marítimo. The Torres de Santa Cruz are two twin skyscrapers high (the highest residential buildings in Spain and the tallest skyscrapers in the Canary Islands).

=== Archeological sites ===
The island also has several archaeological sites of Guanche time (prior to the conquest), which generally are cave paintings that are scattered throughout the island, but most are found in the south of the island.

Archaeological sites on the island include the Cave of the Guanches, where the oldest remains in the archipelago have been found, dating to the 6th century BC, and the Caves of Don Gaspar, where the finding of plant debris in the form of carbonized seeds indicates that the Guanches practiced agriculture on the island. Both deposits are in the town of Icod de los Vinos. Also noteworthy on the island is the Estación solar de Masca (&quot;Masca Solar Station&quot;), which was an aboriginal sanctuary for the celebration of rites related to fertility and the request for rainwater. This is located in the municipality of 
Buenavista del Norte.

Other archaeological sites include that of Los Cambados and that of El Barranco del Rey both in Arona. One could also highlight the Cueva de Achbinico (first shrine Marian of the Canary Islands, Guanche vintage-Spanish). In addition there are some buildings called Güímar Pyramids, whose origin is uncertain.

There are also traces that reveal the Punic presence on the island, as in the wake commonly called &quot;Stone of the Guanches&quot; in the town of Taganana. This archaeological site consists of a structure formed by a stone block, large, outdoor, featuring rock carvings on its surface. Among these is the presence of a representation of the Carthaginian goddess Tanit, represented by a bottle-shaped symbol surrounded by cruciform motifs. It is thought that the monument was originally an altar of sacrifice linked to those found in the Semitic field and then reused for Aboriginal ritual of mummification.

== Culture and arts ==

=== Literature ===
In the 16th and 17th centuries, Antonio de Viana, a native of La Laguna, composed the epic poem &quot;Antigüedades de las Islas Afortunadas&quot; (&quot;Antiquities of the Fortunate Isles&quot;), a work of value to anthropologists, since it sheds light on Canarian life of the time. The Enlightenment reached Tenerife, and literary and artistic figures of this era include José Viera y Clavijo, Tomás de Iriarte y Oropesa, Ángel Guimerá y Jorge, Mercedes Pinto and Domingo Pérez Minik, amongst others.

=== Painting ===

During the course of the 16th century, several painters flourished in La Laguna, as well as in other places on the island, including Garachico, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, La Orotava and Puerto de la Cruz. Cristóbal Hernández de Quintana and Gaspar de Quevedo, considered the best Canarian painters of the 17th century, were natives of La Orotava, and their art can be found in churches on Tenerife.

The work of Luis de la Cruz y Ríos can be found in the church of Nuestra Señora de la Peña de Francia, in Puerto de la Cruz. Born in 1775, he became court painter to Ferdinand VII of Spain and was also a miniaturist, and achieved a favorable position in the royal court. He was known there by the nickname of &quot;El Canario.&quot;

The landscape painter Valentín Sanz (born 1849) was a native of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and the &quot;Museo Municipal de Bellas Artes de Santa Cruz&quot; displays many of his works. This museum also contains the works of Juan Rodríguez Botas (1880–1917), considered the first Canarian impressionist.

Frescoes by the expressionist Mariano de Cossío can be found in the church of Santo Domingo, in La Laguna. The watercolorist Francisco Bonnín Guerín (born 1874) was a native of Santa Cruz, and founded a school to encourage the arts. Óscar Domínguez was born in La Laguna in 1906 and is famed for his versatility. He belonged to the surrealist school, and invented the technique known as &quot;decalcomania&quot;.

=== Sculpture ===
The arrival from Seville of Martín de Andújar Cantos, an architect and sculptor brought new sculpting techniques of the Seville school, which were passed down to his students, including Blas García Ravelo, a native of Garachico. He had been trained by the master sculptor Juan Martínez Montañés.

Other notable sculptors from the 17th and 18th centuries include Sebastián Fernández Méndez, Lázaro González de Ocampo, José Rodríguez de la Oliva, and most importantly, Fernando Estévez, a native of La Orotava and a student of Luján Pérez. Estévez contributed an extensive collection of religious images and woodcarvings, found in numerous churches of Tenerife, such as the Principal Parish of Saint James the Great (&quot;Parroquia Matriz del Apóstol Santiago&quot;), in Los Realejos; in the Cathedral of La Laguna; the &quot;Iglesia de la Concepción&quot; in La Laguna; the basilica of Candelaria, and various churches in La Orotava.

=== Music ===

An important musician from Tenerife is Teobaldo Power y Lugo Viña, a native of Santa Cruz and a pianist and composer, and author of the &quot;Cantos Canarios&quot;. The Hymn of the Canary Islands takes its melody from the &quot;Arrorró&quot;, or Lullaby, from Power y Lugo Viña&#x27;s &quot;Cantos Canarios&quot;.

Folkloric music has also flourished on the island, and, as in the rest of the islands, is characterized by the use of the Canarian Timple, the guitar, bandurria, laúd, and various percussion instruments. Local folkloric groups such as Los Sabandeños work to save Tenerife&#x27;s musical forms in the face of increasing cultural pressure from the mainland.

Tenerife is the home to the types of songs called the &quot;isa&quot;, &quot;folía&quot;, &quot;tajaraste&quot;, and &quot;malagueña&quot;, which are a cross of ancient Guanche songs and those of Andalusia and Latin America.

=== Architecture ===

Tenerife is characterized by an architecture whose best representatives are the local manor houses and also the most humble and common dwellings. This style, while influenced by those of Andalusia and Portugal, nevertheless had a very particular and native character.

Of the manor houses, the best examples can be found in La Orotava and in La Laguna, characterized by their balconies and by the existence of interior patios and the widespread use of the wood known as &quot;pino tea&quot; (&quot;pitch pine&quot;). These houses are characterized by simple façades and wooden lattices with little ornamentation. There are sash windows and it is customary for the chairs inside the house to rest back-to-back to the windows. The interior patios function like real gardens that serve to give extra light to the rooms, which are connected via the patio by galleries frequently crowned by wood and stone.

Gadgets like stills, water pumps, benches and counters, are elements that frequently form part of these patios.

Traditional houses generally have two storeys, with rough walls of variegated colours. Sometimes the continuity of these walls is interrupted by the presence of stone blocks that are used for ornamental purposes.

The government buildings and religious structures were built according to the changing styles of each century. The urban nuclei of La Orotava and La Laguna have been declared national historical-artistic monuments.

In recent years, various governments have spearheaded the concept of developing architectural projects, sometimes ostentatious ones, designed by renowned architects–for example, the remodeling of the Plaza de España in Santa Cruz de Tenerife by the Swiss architects Herzog &amp; de Meuron. Other examples include the Playa de Las Teresitas project by the Frenchman Dominique Perrault; the center known as Magma Arte &amp; Congresos; the Torres de Santa Cruz; and the Auditorio de Tenerife (&quot;Auditorium of Tenerife&quot;). The latter, by the Spaniard Santiago Calatrava, lies to the east of the Parque Marítimo (&quot;Maritime Park&quot;), in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, and is characterized by its sail-like structure, which evokes a boat, and has become a symbol for the city and island, which makes Santa Cruz de Tenerife one of the Spanish cities with the most futuristic buildings.

=== Crafts ===

Distinctive representatives of craftsmanship on the island are Tenerife lace (&quot;calado canario&quot;), which is drawn work embroidery, and the intricate doilies known as &quot;rosetas&quot;, or rosette embroidery, particularly from Vilaflor. The lace, often made for table linen, is produced by the intricate and slow embroidering of a stretched piece of cloth, which is rigidly attached to a wooden frame and is finished with illustrations or patterns using threads that are crossed over and wound around the &quot;fijadores&quot;, or pins stuck in a small support made of cloth. These decorated, small pieces are afterwards joined, to produce distinct designs and pieces of cloth.

Another Tenerife-based industry is cabinetwork. The north of the island produced various master craftsman who created distinctive balconies, celosias, doors, and windows, as well as furniture consisting of pieces made in fine wood. Basketmaking using palm-leaves was also an important industry. Other materials are chestnut tree branches stripped of their leaves and banana tree fibre (known locally as &quot;la badana&quot;).

Pottery has a long history harking back to the production of ceramics by the Guanches. The Guanches were unfamiliar with the potter&#x27;s wheel, and used hand-worked clay, which gave their pottery a distinctive look. Pottery was used to produce domestic objects such as pots and grills, or ornamental pieces such as bead collars or the objects known as &quot;pintaderas&quot;, which were pieces of pottery used to decorate other vessels.

=== Traditional celebrations ===
==== Carnival of Santa Cruz ====
Perhaps the most important festival of Tenerife, popular both on a national and international level, is the Carnival of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, which has been declared a Festival of International Tourist Interest (&quot;Fiesta de Interés Turístico Internacional&quot;). The carnival is celebrated in many locations in the north and south of the island, but is largest in scope in the city of Santa Cruz. Contests are celebrated, and the carnival includes bands of street musicians (&quot;murgas&quot;), groups of minstrels (&quot;rondallas de Tenerife&quot;), masquerades (&quot;comparsas&quot;), and various associations (&quot;agrupaciones&quot;). Once the Queen of the festival is elected, the first part of the carnival ends, and thereafter begins the actual street carnival, in which large numbers of people gather in the centre of Santa Cruz, with the carnival lasting ten days.

==== Pilgrimages (&quot;Romerías&quot;) ====
The most traditional and widespread religious festivals on the islands are the pilgrimages or &quot;romerías&quot;. These events, which incorporate Christian and non-Christian elements, are celebrated by various means: with wagons and floats, plowing teams and livestock, in honor of the patron saint of a particular place. The processions are accompanied by local dances, local dishes, folkloric activities, local arts and crafts, local sports, and the wearing of traditional dress of Tenerife (&quot;trajes de mago&quot;).

The origins of these events can be attributed to the parties and celebrations held by the richest classes of the island, who would gather to venerate their patron saints, to which they attributed good harvests, fertile lands, plentiful rainfall, the curing of sicknesses and ending of epidemics, etc. They would thus give homage to these saints by consuming and sharing the fruits of their harvest, which included the locally cultivated wines. These have developed into processions to mark festivals dedicated to Saint Mark in Tegueste, where the wagons are decorated with the fruits of the earth (seeds, cereals, flowers, etc.); to Saint Isidore the Laborer in Los Realejos; to Saint Isidore the Laborer and Maria Torribia (&quot;Saint Mary of the Head&quot;) in La Orotava; the Romería Regional de San Benito Abad in La Laguna; Virgin of Candelaria in Candelaria; Saint Roch in Garachico; Saint Augustine in Arafo; and the Romería del Socorro in Güímar.

==== Holiday of the Virgin of Candelaria ====
The Virgin of Candelaria is the patron of the Canary Islands; a feast is held in her honor two times a year, in February and August. The Romeria-Offering to the Virgin of Candelaria is celebrated every 15 August in this event is a tradition that representations of all municipalities of the island and also of all the Canary archipelago come to make offerings to their patron. Another significant act of the feast of the Virgin of Candelaria is called &quot;Walk to Candelaria&quot; held on the night of 14 to 15 August in which the faithful make pilgrimage on foot from various parts of the island, even coming from other islands to arrive at Villa Mariana de Candelaria.

On 2 February we celebrate the feast of the Candelaria. Also on this day come to town many devotees of the Virgin. During the February festivities, the so-called &quot;Procesión de Las Candelas&quot; (&quot;Candlelight Procession&quot;) stands out, in which the faithful accompany the Virgin in the dark of the night lit only by candles and praying the rosary.

==== Holiday of the Cristo de La Laguna ====
It is celebrated every 14 September in honor of a much venerated image of Christ in the Archipelago, the Cristo de La Laguna, is held in the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna. Every 9 September, the venerated image of Christ is lowered in public from the main altar of its Royal Sanctuary, after which, the faithful kiss the feet of the image. The image is solemnly transferred in procession to the Cathedral of La Laguna on the afternoon of that day, where it remains for several days, until 14 September, which is the main day, when it is transferred back to its Sanctuary.

==== Corpus Christi ====

The religious festival of Corpus Christi is particularly important, and is traditionally celebrated with floral carpets laid in the streets. Particularly noteworthy are the celebrations in La Orotava where a very large carpet, or tapestry, of different coloured volcanic soils, covers the Plaza del Ayuntamiento (town square). These soils are taken from the Parque Nacional del Teide, and after the celebration, are returned, to preserve the National Park. The celebration of Corpus Christi in Orotava has been declared of Important Cultural Interest among the official Traditional Activities of the Island.

==== Easter ====
Among the numerous other celebrations that define Tenerifan culture, Easter remains the most important. This is celebrated across the island, but is particularly notable in the municipalities of La Laguna, La Orotava and Los Realejos, where elaborate processions take place on Maundy Thursday, Good Friday and Easter Sunday, or &quot;Resurrection Sunday&quot;. Holy Week in the city of San Cristobal de la Laguna is the largest of the Canary Islands.

== Religion ==

As with the rest of Spain, Tenerife is largely Catholic. However, the practice of other religions and denominations has increasingly expanded on the island due to tourism and immigration, as Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Evangelicalism, Judaism and Afro-American religion. Minority religions are stationed in the island: Chinese Religions, Baháʼí and the neopaganism native form, the Church of the Guanche People, among others. Christianity and Judaism arrived in the island with the Spanish conquest.
An important Catholic festival is the celebration of the feast day associated with the Virgin of Candelaria, patron saint of the Canary Islands, who represents the union of the Guanche and Spanish cultures. The Guanches became devoted to a Black Madonna that Christian missionaries from Lanzarote and Fuerteventura left on a beach near the present-day Villa Mariana de Candelaria, which gave rise to the legends and stories associated with the Virgin. These legends fueled the cult of the Virgin and the pilgrimages to Candelaria that have existed to this day on the island. Another cult to the Virgin Mary exists in the form of Our Lady of Los Remedios (&quot;la Virgen de Los Remedios&quot;), who is patron of the island and Catholic diocese of Tenerife (&quot;Diócesis Nivariense&quot;).
In Tenerife were born two Catholic saints who were of the greatest missionaries in the Americas: Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur and José de Anchieta. The first was a missionary in Guatemala and founder of Order of Our Lady of Bethlehem (the first religious order of the Americas), the second was a missionary in Brazil, and was one of the founders of São Paulo and of Rio de Janeiro. It also highlights the figure of the mystic Mary of Jesus de León y Delgado. This nun died with a reputation for holiness and is highly revered throughout the Canary Islands. Her body is intact in the Convent of Santa Catalina de Siena in San Cristóbal de La Laguna.

Principal Catholic places of worship on the island include:

* &quot;The Basilica of Candelaria&quot; (in Candelaria): The place where the image of the Virgin of Candelaria can be found, this sanctuary is built in neoclassical style, and is visited daily by the parishioners, who visit the Villa Mariana out of devotion to the Virgin.
* The &quot;Cathedral of La Laguna&quot; (in San Cristóbal de La Laguna): The seat of the Diocese of Tenerife (known as the Diócesis Nivariense, or Nivarian Diocese), the cathedral is dedicated to Our Lady of Remedies (&quot;la Virgen de Los Remedios&quot;). A combination of neo-Gothic and neoclassical architectural elements.
* &quot;Real Santuario del Cristo de La Laguna&quot; (in San Cristóbal de La Laguna): One of the most important churches in the Canary Islands, it contains the venerated image of the Cristo de La Laguna, and is a symbol of the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna.
*&quot;* Mother Parish of the Apostle Santiago (Los Realejos)&quot; (&quot;Parroquia Matriz del Apóstol Santiago&quot;): Situated in Villa de Los Realejos, this parish church was the first Christian church built on the island after its conquest by Castilian forces. It is dedicated to Saint James the Great, as the &quot;conquista&quot; was completed on the saint&#x27;s feast day on 25 July 1496. It was, along with the Parish of the Conception of La Laguna, one of the first parishes of the island.
* &quot;The Church of the Conception of La Laguna&quot; (&quot;Iglesia de la Concepción de La Laguna&quot;): One of the most ancient buildings on Tenerife, its construction was ordered by Alonso Fernández de Lugo. It has been declared a National Historic Monument. Around this church were built the dwellings and infrastructure that formed the nucleus of the city of San Cristóbal de La Laguna.

Other important churches include the Church of the Conception in La Orotava (Iglesia de la Concepción); the churches of San Agustín and Santo Domingo in La Orotava; the church of Nuestra Señora de la Peña de Francia in Puerto de la Cruz; the church of San Marcos in Icod de los Vinos; the church of Santa Ana in Garachico; and the Church of the Conception (Iglesia de la Concepción) in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

The first saint of Tenerife and Canary Islands was Saint Peter of Saint Joseph Betancur, born in the town of Vilaflor, Tenerife. His main shrine is the Cave of Santo Hermano Pedro in Granadilla de Abona, near the coast, where he lived in his youth. This cave is considered one of the most important pilgrimage spots of the Canary Islands.

Another notable building on the island is the Masonic Temple of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, generally considered the finest example of Masonic temple architecture in Spain; it was the Masonic center of the country until the military occupation of the island by the Franco regime.

The headquarters of the Islamic Federation of the Canary Islands is in Tenerife; the organization was founded to unite the Muslim communities of the Canary Islands in a common association. For its part, the headquarters of the Evangelical Council of the Canary Islands is also on the island.

== Education ==
Formal education in Tenerife began with the religious orders. In 1530, the Dominican Order established a chair of philosophy at the convent of La Concepción de La Laguna. Still, until well into the 18th century Tenerife was largely without institutions of education.

Such institutions finally began to develop thanks to the work of the Real Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País (&quot;Royal Economic Society of Friends of the Country&quot;), which established several schools in San Cristóbal de La Laguna. The first of these was an institute of secondary education established in 1846 to fill the gap left by the closure of the Universidad de San Fernando (&quot;see University of La Laguna&quot;).

An 1850 annex to this building was the Escuela Normal Elemental, the archipelago&#x27;s first teachers&#x27; college or normal school, which became the Escuela Normal Superior de Magisterio from 1866 onward. These were the only institutions of higher education until the dictator Miguel Primo de Rivera created several institutions. A turning point came around the time of the rise of the Second Spanish Republic. From 1929 to 1933 the number of schools nearly doubled.

Shortly after this, though, the start of the Spanish Civil War and the following dictatorship of Francisco Franco constituted a considerable reversal. Education in the hands of religious orders had a certain importance on the island until the 1970 Ley General de Educación (&quot;General Law of Education&quot;) shifted the balance from religiously based education to public education. Public schools continued their advance during and after the post-Franco Spanish transition to democracy. Tenerife today has 301 centers of childhood education (preschools), 297 primary schools, 140 secondary schools and 86 post-secondary schools. There are also five universities or post-graduate schools, the University of La Laguna, the Universidad Nacional de Educación a Distancia (National University of Distance Learning), the Universidad Internacional Menéndez Pelayo (Menéndez Pelayo International University), the Universidad Alfonso X el Sabio (University of Alfonso X the Wise) and the Universidad de Vic (Escuela Universitaria de Turismo de Santa Cruz de Tenerife, &quot;University School of Tourism of Santa Cruz de Tenerife&quot;). The largest of these is the University of La Laguna.

The Universidad Europea de Canarias (European University of the Canary Islands) is located in La Orotava and is the first private university in the Canary Islands.

=== Science and research ===

While Tenerife is not prominent in the history of scientific and academic research, it is the home of the Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (Astrophysical Institute of the Canaries). There is also an Instituto de Bio-Orgánica Antonio González (Antonio González Bio-Organic Institute) at the University of La Laguna. Also at that university are the Instituto de Lingüística Andrés Bello (Andrés Bello Institute of Linguistics), the Centro de Estudios Medievales y Renacentistas (Center for Medieval and Renaissance Studies), the Instituto Universitario de la Empresa (University Institute of Business), the Instituto de Derecho Regional (Regional Institute of Law), the Instituto Universitario de Ciencias Políticas y Sociales (University Institute of Political and Social Sciences) and the Instituto de Enfermedades Tropicales (Institute of Tropical Diseases). This last is one of the seven institutions of the Red de Investigación de Centros de Enfermedades Tropicales (RICET, &quot;Network of Research of Centers of Tropical Diseases&quot;), located in various parts of Spain.

Puerto de la Cruz has the Instituto de Estudos Hispánicos de Canarias (Institute of Hispanic Studies of the Canaries), attached to Madrid&#x27;s Instituto de Cultura Hispánica. In La Laguna is the Canarian delegation of the Consejo Superior de Investigaciones Científicas (CSIC, Superior Council of Scientific Investigations), the Instituto Canario de Investigaciones Agrarias (Canarian Institute of Agrarian Investigation), the Instituto de Estudios Canarios (Canarian Institute of Studies) and the Centro Internacional para la Conservación del Patrimonio (the International Center of the Conservation of Patrimony).

Other research facilities in Tenerife are the Instituto Tecnológico de Canarias, the Instituto Vulcanológico de Canarias, the Asociación Industrial de Canarias, the Instituto Tecnológico de Energías Renovables (Technological Institute of Renewable Energy) and the Instituto Oceanográfico de Canarias in Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

=== Museums ===
The island boasts a variety of museums of different natures, under dominion of a variety of institutions. Perhaps the most developed are those belonging to the Organismo Autónomo de Museos y Centros, which include the following:
* Museum of Nature and Man: located in Santa Cruz de Tenerife, this museum exhibits the natural riches of the Canary Islands and of the pre-Hispanic people who inhabited these.

== Media ==

Along with many Spanish-language radio and TV stations, Tenerife has two official English-language radio stations. Coast FM broadcasts a mix of adult contemporary music and is the only local news service to broadcast in English.
As the larger of the two stations, Coast FM can be heard across Tenerife and much of the Canary Islands from its transmitters on 106.6, 92.2 and 89.4. Energy FM is a non-stop music station that also broadcasts local news and information on the hour.

== Transport and communications ==

The island of Tenerife is served by Tenerife North Airport (GCXO) and Tenerife South Airport (GCTS). Thanks to its two airports, Tenerife is the island gathers the highest passenger movement of all the Canary Islands, with 18,457,794 passengers,

Tenerife North Airport, the smaller of the two, is located near the metropolitan area Santa Cruz-La Laguna (423,000 inhabitants). It serves inter-insular flights as well as national and European flights. Tenerife South Airport (south) is the busiest Airport in Tenerife, ranking 7th in Spain. It typically serves the mass of regular and vacation charter flights constantly arriving from most of Europe.

The other way to arrive on Tenerife is by ferry, either to Santa Cruz de Tenerife or Los Cristianos, near Playa de Las Américas.

A network consisting of two fast, toll-free motorways (TF1 and TF5) encircles nearly the entire island, linking all the main towns and resorts with the metropolitan area. The exception is in the West, from Adeje to Icod de los Vinos, which is traversed by a smaller winding mountain road. However, plans are in progress to complete the motorway, which caused a heavy debate between the environmentalists and the local businessmen.

Away from the major motorways, there is a network of secondary and communal roads, varying from wide to steep, winding narrow roads, mainly unlit and often with drops on either side of the main carriageway surface.

Public transport on the island is provided by an extensive network of buses and run by TITSA, who operate a fleet of modern, air-conditioned buses. TITSA buses cover most of the island and they are fairly frequent. For more than one journey, customers can purchase a TenMas contactless smart card for €2, which can be topped up with up to €100 travel credit. Using the TenMas card provides a discount over cash fares, and, for Tenerife residents, a card allowing unlimited travel for a monthly fee is also available. The card can be purchased and topped up at bus stations and many newsagents. It is also valid on the tram in the capital, Santa Cruz (See Below).

A hire car is sometimes a good option for discovering the remote wilderness regions, although TITSA operate reliable bus services in the remotest spots, such as the Teno Massif via Masca (355), and up the Anaga mountains (247). TITSA operate two daily services up Mount Teide – from Puerto de la Cruz (348) and from Los Christianos/Las Americas (342) up to the Teide Parador, Teleferico cable car, Montana Blanca and El Portillo. Car rental companies that have offices in the airports are: Autoreisen, Avis, Cicar, Europcar, Goldcar (only south airport), Hertz, Sixt and TopCar.

The metropolitan Area formed by Santa Cruz and La Laguna is served by the &quot;Tranvía de Tenerife&quot; (&quot;Tenerife Tram&quot;) which opened in early 2007, after 3 years of intensive works. The fairly lengthy line from Santa Cruz up the hill to La Laguna serves almost 20 stops. A second line within La Laguna was added in 2009.

=== Roads ===

The main means of transportation in Tenerife is by highways. The most important of these are the Autopista del Sur and the Autopista del Norte (the North and South Motorways), which run from the metropolitan zone to the south and north, respectively. These two motorways are connected by means of the Autovía de Interconexión Norte-Sur in the outskirts of the metropolitan zone. Within the network of roads on the island of Tenerife there are other minor roads that used to include the highway from San Andres and Santa Cruz (Holy Cross in English).

Also planned is the construction of a bypass road north of the metropolitan area of Santa Cruz de Tenerife, La Laguna. This aims to provide dual cores to Guamasa and Acorán, by way of Los Baldíos, Centenero, Llano del Moro, El Sobradillo, El Tablero, and El Chorrillo, among other neighbourhoods. The route will be approximately long and will cost an estimated 190 million euros (270 million in American dollars).

=== Airports ===

Tenerife is most easily reached by air. There are two airports: Tenerife South Airport, in the south, and Tenerife North Airport, near Santa Cruz. Overall, Tenerife has the highest annual passenger count and the greatest number of arrivals in Canary Islands, made more popular by the frequency of cheap flights from many European destinations. Tenerife North Airport and Tenerife South Airport together account for the highest passenger numbers in the Islands with some 14 million passengers annually (AENA report). Of the two airports on the island, Tenerife South is the most popular tourist destination.

=== Ports ===
Besides air transport, Tenerife has two principal maritime ports: the Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife (&quot;Puerto de Santa Cruz&quot;), which serves the various capitals of the Canary Islands, especially those in the east; and the Port of Los Cristianos (&quot;Puerto de Los Cristianos&quot;), which serves the various island capitals of the province of Santa Cruz de Tenerife. The first port also has passenger services, which connect with the mainland port of Cádiz (and vice versa). In 2017, a large important port was opened in the south of the island, the Port of Granadilla, and another one is planned in the west, in Fonsalía. The Port of Santa Cruz de Tenerife is the first fishing port in the Canary Islands with approximately 7,500 tons of fish caught, according to the Statistical Yearbook of the State Ports 2006 (the latest of which is changing). Following this report is the largest port number of passengers recorded. Similarly, the second port of Spain moving ship and loaded into cars, only surpassed by the Port of Algeciras Bay. In the port&#x27;s facilities include a border inspection post (BIP) approved by the European Union, which is responsible for inspecting all types of imports from third countries or exports to countries outside the European Economic Area.

=== Buses (&quot;guaguas&quot;) ===
Tenerife has an extensive system of buses, which are called &quot;guaguas&quot; in the Canary Islands. The bus system is used both within the cities and also connects most of the towns and cities of the island. There are bus stations in all of the major towns, such as the Intercambiador de Transportes de Santa Cruz de Tenerife.

=== Taxis ===
There is a well-regulated taxi service on the island.

=== Tramway ===

Since 2007, the Tenerife Tram connects Santa Cruz de Tenerife and La Laguna through the suburb of Taco. There are 20 stops and it covers a distance of in 37 minutes. It calls at some points of interest including Tenerife&#x27;s two major hospitals, the university complex of Guajara, and a number of museums and theatres. Concerning its power supply, it will support development of further wind farms to provide it with 100 percent clean energy.

==== Railway plans ====
By 2005, plans for a light-rail network linking the capital with the South had been approved by both the Tenerife Council and the Canary Islands Government, though the discussion with the central Spanish Government stalled on budget issues. The original intent was to establish two railway systems that would serve the northern and southern sides of the island connecting these with the capital.
By March 2011, these intentions had been replaced by advanced plans for a single high-speed rail line, the &quot;South Train&quot; which would connect Santa Cruz de Tenerife with Adeje via Santa Maria de Añaza, Candelaria, San Isidro, Tenerife South Airport, and a main stopover station at Adeje which would be designed to service up to 25,000 passengers per day. Trains would run every 15 minutes during rush hours, and would achieve speeds up to . The project, which involves 9 tunnels, 12 false tunnels (together 22.1 km) and 33 viaducts (8.3 km) has been budgeted at EUR 1.7 bn. It has met staunch opposition from local environmentalists. An alternate plan for a high-speed Transrapid maglev has also been put forward.

===Tourist train===
A tourist train (Tren Turístico) serves Costa Adeje to Los Cristianos with several stops including in Playa de las Americas.

===Cableway===

== Sports ==

On the island of Tenerife, a large number of sports are practised, both outdoors and indoors in the various facilities available throughout the island. The sports are numerous – Diving, Rock Climbing, Walking, Cycling, Sailing, Golf, Surfing, Go-Karting, Paragliding – the all year round weather makes it ideal for a wide variety of outdoor sports.
There are also many indoor sporting facilities including fully equipped including &#x27;Tenerife Top Training&#x27; centre in Adeje on the South of the Island. Its most well-known sports team is football club CD Tenerife based in Santa Cruz. The club has spent time in the Spanish top flight, but have in recent decades primarily played in the second division of Spanish football. Also worth mentioning is the ultramarathon CajaMar Tenerife Bluetrail, the highest race in Spain and second in Europe, with the participation of several countries and great international repercussions.

== Healthcare ==
The main hospitals on the island are the Hospital Universitario de Canarias and the Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de Candelaria. Both are third-level hospitals, with specialist facilities that serve all of the Canary Islands. They are both affiliated with the education and research network of the Universidad de La Laguna. However, they belong to different bodies, since the first one is under the directives of the Servicio Canario de la Salud (Canarian Health Service). The Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de Candelaria it is the largest hospital complex in the Canary Islands.

In addition, two large new hospitals have recently been built in the north and south areas of the island, located in the municipalities of Icod de los Vinos and Arona respectively. The Hospital del Norte de Tenerife (&quot;Tenerife North Hospital&quot;) opened in 2012 and the Hospital del Sur de Tenerife (&quot;Tenerife South Hospital&quot;) opened in 2015. These centers will function, according to their classification, as second level hospitals, with services of hospitalization, advanced diagnosis, ambulances and emergencies, and rehabilitation, etc. There are also a total of 39 centers of primary care and specialized clinics which complete the sanitary infrastructure of Tenerife.

== Gastronomy ==

=== Fish ===
Due to the geographic situation of Tenerife, the island enjoys an abundance of fish of various kinds. The species that are consumed the most are the Combtooth blennies (&quot;viejas&quot;), as well as sea bream (&quot;sama&quot;), red porgy (&quot;bocinegro&quot;), gold lined bream (&quot;salema&quot;), grouper (&quot;mero&quot;), and various and abundant types of &quot;Thunnus&quot;. The Atlantic mackerel (&quot;caballa&quot;), sardine (&quot;sardine&quot;), and Jack mackerels (&quot;chicharros&quot;) are also consumed frequently. Moray eels (&quot;morenas&quot;) are also eaten, usually fried. Most seafood is cooked simply, usually boiled, or prepared &quot;a la espalda&quot; (cut into two equally shaped pieces along the spine) or &quot;a la sal&quot; (baked in salt). These dishes are usually accompanied by &quot;mojo&quot; (a local sauce) and wrinkly potatoes.

=== Meat ===
The typical festive meat dish of marinated pork tacos is a very popular dish prepared for town festivities in &quot;ventorrillos&quot;, bars and private homes. Rabbit in salmorejo, goat, beef, pork and poultry are regularly consumed.

=== Canarian wrinkly potatoes ===

The fish dishes along with the meats are often accompanied by wrinkly potatoes (&quot;papas arrugadas&quot;). This is a typical Canarian dish which simply refers to the way the cooked potatoes look. They are boiled in their skins, in water with much salt, and the water is allowed to evaporate, leaving a salty crust.

=== Mojos ===
Mojo, a word probably of Portuguese origin, describes a typical Canarian sauce, served as an accompaniment to food. The sauces come in a variety of colours, flavours and textures, and are usually served cold, often in separate dishes, for the diner to choose how much to apply. Green mojo usually includes coriander, parsley, and garlic; whilst red mojo is piquant, and made from a mix of hot and sweet peppers. A wide variety of other ingredients are also used, including; almonds, cheese, saffron and fried bread. Mojos are served with most meat, and some fish, dishes, and are often used on potatoes, or bread is dipped into them.

=== Cheeses ===
Tenerife exports about 3,400 tons of cheese per year, representing about 50 percent of the output of the island, and about 25 percent of the entire Canary Islands.

After the conquest of the Canary Islands, one of the first commercial activities to be started was cheese production. The sale of cheese provided the inhabitants with an income and cheese was even used as a form of currency for exchange and sale, becoming a crucial product in agricultural areas of the island.

Cheese grew to become one of the most commonly produced and consumed products on the island and is regularly served as part of a starter course or as a snack. Farms at Arico, La Orotava and Teno produced a variety of cheeses, including soft cheeses, cured, smoked and were mostly handmade. Today the main product is goat cheese, although certain amounts are made from sheep&#x27;s or cow&#x27;s milk, and according to the &quot;Registro General Sanitario de Alimentos&quot;, the general health registry, around 75 different cottage cheeses are produced. The cheeses of the Canaries have generally received good international reviews, noted for their sweetness which differentiates them from certain other European cheeses. In particular, Tenerifan cured goats cheese was awarded best cheese in the world final of the 2008 World Cheese Awards held in Dublin, Ireland.

Cheeses from Tenerife now have a quality mark promoted by the Fundación Tenerife Rural, to standardize their quality in an attempt to publicize the qualities of the cheese and improve its marketing.

=== Gofio ===

Gofio is one of the more traditional elements of cooking on the island, It is made with cereal grains that are roasted and then ground. Increasingly used to make a gofio on the island is wheat although there are other types, and they are often made with chickpeas. Relatively common is a mixed-type with wheat. It was served as main food to the &quot;guanches&quot; even before the Spanish conquest. In later times of scarcity or famine it was a staple of the popular Canarian diet. Today it is eaten as a main dish (gofio escaldado) or an accompaniment to different dishes, meats, fishes, soups, desserts. Some famous cooks have even made gofio ice cream, receiving good comments from the critics.

=== Confectionery ===
Confectionery in Tenerife is represented and strongly influenced by La Palma, with confections like &quot;bienmesabe&quot;, &quot;leche asada&quot;, &quot;Príncipe Alberto&quot;, &quot;frangollo&quot;, &quot;huevos moles&quot;, and &quot;quesillo&quot;.

=== Wines ===
Viticulture in the archipelago, and especially in Tenerife dates back to the conquest, when the settlers brought a variety of vines to plant. In the 16th and 17th centuries, wine production played an important role in the economy, and many families were dedicated to the culture and business. Of special mention is &quot;malvasía canary&quot;, considered the best wine of Tenerife and at the time one of the most desired wines in the world, being shipped across to the major warehouses of Europe and America. Writers such as William Shakespeare and Walter Scott make reference to the wine in some of their works. Tenerife has 5 main wine growing regions. These include Abona, Valle de Güímar, Valle de La Orotava, Tacoronte-Acentejo and Ycoden-Daute-Isora.

This typical gastronomy is served in popular establishments known as &quot;guachinches&quot;, opening day is the day of &quot;San Andrés&quot;, 30 November, also known as the young wine festival &quot;Festival de Vino Joven&quot;. The wine of the new harvest is traditionally served with roasted chestnuts, maturing at the same time, and grilled sardines, thus the season normally lasts from late autumn until early spring.

<doc id="269228" wikidata="Q828075" url="?curid=269228" title="New Jersey Route 347">
<text>Route 347 is a state highway in the southern part of New Jersey in the United States. It is a bypass of Route 47 in Dennis Township, Cape May County, and Maurice River Township, Cumberland County, that is long and is completely county-maintained. Route 347 passes through dense woodland for most of its route as a two-lane undivided road. The road is a part of a major route linking the Philadelphia area with the Jersey Shore resorts of Cape May County. The route was created in the 1990s to replace Route 47 Alternate. It has been considered that Route 347 may be partially used for a potential future extension of Route 55, with improvements to the road planned.

==Route description==

Route 347 begins at an intersection with Route 47 in Dennis Township, Cape May County, heading to the northwest on a two-lane undivided road that is county-maintained. After passing a few residences, the road continues into dense woodland. The route passes by East Creek Pond before entering Maurice River Township in Cumberland County. After the county line, Route 347 intersects CR 550 Spur and forms a concurrency as it runs by West Creek Pond. Past the pond, CR 550 Spur splits from the road, which continues west-northwest. At the junction with CR 679, Route 347 turns to the northwest and comes to a crossroads with CR 550. The road remains on its northwest trajectory as it comes to the eastern terminus of CR 670. At this intersection, the northbound direction of Route 47 turns onto Route 347 from CR 670. Route 347 ends at the point where the ramp to southbound Route 47 splits from the road, which continues north as Route 47. Route 347, along with Route 47 and Route 55, constitutes a major route connecting the Philadelphia area to the Jersey Shore resorts of Cape May County, with Route 347 serving as a bypass of a section of Route 47. The route is also part of a hurricane evacuation route for Cape May County in which contraflow lane reversal can be used for a quicker evacuation.

==History==
What is now Route 347 was originally an unnumbered local road connecting to Route 47 at both ends. Route 347 was created in the 1990s, replacing what was originally designated as Route 47 Alternate. A third lane is currently being proposed along Route 347 in order to handle additional traffic at peak times in the summer season. Either a reversible lane or extra shoulder space is being considered for the additional lane. Originally, the route was to be widened to four total lanes. Auxiliary lanes are also planned to be built at the southern terminus with Route 47 in Dennis Township and the Route 47/CR 670 junction in Maurice River Township in order to alleviate traffic. The Route 347 corridor, along with a part of Route 47, is being considered for a southern expansion of Route 55 to the Garden State Parkway in Cape May County.

<doc id="269231" wikidata="Q1447095" url="?curid=269231" title="Jimmy Lai">
<text>Lai Chee-ying (; born 8 December 1947), also known as Jimmy Lai, is a Hong Kong businessman and politician. He founded Giordano, an Asian clothing retailer, Next Digital (formerly Next Media), a Hong Kong-listed media company, and the popular newspaper &quot;Apple Daily&quot;. He is one of the main contributors to the pro-democracy camp, especially to the Democratic Party. Although he is known as a Hong Kong political figure, he has been a British national since 1996. Lai is also an art collector.

A prominent critic of the Chinese Communist Party who met with U.S. Vice President Mike Pence, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, and National Security Advisor John Bolton in July 2019 during the Hong Kong protests, Lai was arrested on 10 August 2020 by the Hong Kong police on charges of violating the territory&#x27;s new national security law, an action which prompted widespread criticism. Lai was allowed bail on 12 August, but on 3 December, Lai was accused of fraud and his bail was revoked. The court decided to jail Lai until April 2021, marking the first time Lai has been detained. Lai regarded his imprisonment as &quot;the summit of his own life&quot;.

In December 2020, Lai was awarded the &quot;Freedom of Press Award&quot; by Reporters Without Borders for his role in founding &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, a news outlet under Lai&#x27;s pro-democracy leadership that &quot;still dares to openly criticise the Chinese regime and which widely covered last year&#x27;s pro-democracy protests.&quot; On 29 December, Lai resigned from his roles with Next Digital as director and chairman of the board.

In April 2021, he was sentenced to an additional 14 months in prison for organizing illegal protests. As of September 2023, Lai remains imprisoned in solitary confinement at Hong Kong&#x27;s Stanley Prison. On 19 August 2024, a motion for an appeal was rejected. He is in solitary confinement.

In November 2024, Lai testified that he might have asked U.S. officials to sanction Beijing and Hong Kong.

==Early life==

Lai was born in Canton (Guangzhou), China, on 8 December 1947. At the age of 12, he entered Hong Kong as a stowaway on a boat. Upon his arrival, Lai began work as a child labourer in a garment factory for a wage of the equivalent of US$8 per month.

==Business career==

=== Giordano ===
Lai&#x27;s factory work saw him rise to the position of factory manager. In 1975, Lai used his year-end bonus on Hong Kong stocks to raise cash and bought a bankrupt garment factory, Comitex, where he began producing sweaters. Customers included J.C. Penney, Montgomery Ward, and other U.S. retailers.

In 1981, Lai founded Asian clothing retailer Giordano. By rewarding sellers with financial incentives in Hong Kong, he built the chain into an Asia-wide retailer. Giordano was said to have more than 8,000 employees in 2,400 shops in 30 countries.

In 1996, Lai sold his stake in Giordano, leaving the garment industry for media and politics, keeping Comitex active as a shell company. After his arrest under National Security Law in August 2020, Lai tried to sell his asset in Hong Kong, including the entire floor of Tai Ping Industrial Centre. The current owner of the property is Comitex Knitters Ltd. Comitex, along with other private companies controlled by Lai, was reported to be the financial tools for his political activities and donations.

=== Other companies ===
In 1997 Lai put up the capital for his twin sister, Si Wai, to acquire numerous properties in the Southern Ontario wine and vacation region of Niagara-on-the-Lake. The Lais Group of Companies now owns additional properties in Caledon and Jordan, both in Ontario. Lai remains the owner despite his arrest.

During the dot-com boom of the late 1990s, Lai started an Internet-based grocery retailer that offered home delivery services, adMart. The business expanded its product scope beyond groceries to include electronics and office supplies, but was shut down after losing between $100 and $150 million. Lai attributed this business failure to overconfidence and a lack of viable business strategy.

In 2011, Next Media reportedly sold 70 per cent stake of Next Media&#x27;s subsidiary Colored World Holdings (CWH, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands) to Sum Tat Ventures (STV, incorporated in the British Virgin Islands), a private company 100 per cent owned by Jimmy Lai. CWH was estimated to have net asset value of US$6.1 million. STV paid US$100 million in cash for 70 per cent stake of CWH. In 2013, STV paid another US$20 million for the remaining 30 per cent stake of CWH. CWH itself had its assets sold in 2011, and ceased operation in 2011. In total, STV paid US$120 million in cash for CWH. On Lai&#x27;s Form 3B disclosure form, STV is listed as having the same correspondence address as Next Media in Hong Kong.

Near the end of 2013, Lai spent approximately US$73 million (or NT$2.3 billion) to purchase a 2 per cent stake (~17 million shares) in Taiwanese electronics manufacturer HTC.

=== Activities in Myanmar ===
In 2014, leaked documents showed Jimmy Lai paid former US deputy defence secretary and former World Bank president Paul Wolfowitz US$75,000 for his help with projects in Myanmar. Lai also reportedly remitted approximately US$213,000 to businessman Phone Win, with whom Lai&#x27;s Hong Kong-registered Best Combo company reportedly collaborated on Yangon real estate projects.

== Media career ==
Lai pioneered a reader-centric philosophy with paparazzi journalism in Hong Kong based on publications such as &quot;USA Today&quot; and &quot;The Sun&quot;. His best-selling &quot;Next Magazine&quot; and &quot;Apple Daily&quot; newspaper featured a mix of racy tabloid material and news items oriented to the mass market with plenty of colour and graphics that attracted a wide range of readers, some of whom were also critics of Lai and his ideology.

===Hong Kong publications===

Owing to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, Lai became an advocate of democracy and critic of the People&#x27;s Republic of China government. In 1990, he began publishing &quot;Next Magazine&quot;, which combined tabloid sensationalism with hard-hitting political and business reporting. He proceeded to found other magazines, including &quot;Sudden Weekly&quot; (), &quot;Eat &amp; Travel Weekly&quot; (), &quot;Trading Express/Auto Express&quot; () and the youth-oriented &quot;Easy Finder&quot; ().

In 1995, as the Hong Kong handover approached, Lai founded &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, a newspaper start-up that he financed with $100 million of his own money. The newspaper&#x27;s circulation rose to 400,000 copies by 1997, which was the territory&#x27;s second largest among 60 other newspapers. According to Lai, he aspired to maintain freedom of speech in Hong Kong through &quot;Apple Daily&quot;. In addition to promoting democracy, Lai&#x27;s publications often ruffled feathers of fellow Hong Kong tycoons by exposing their personal foibles and relations with local government.

In 2003, ahead of the record-breaking pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong during July, the cover of &quot;Next Magazine&quot; featured a photo-montage of the territory&#x27;s embattled chief executive Tung Chee-Hwa taking a pie in the face. The magazine urged readers to take to the streets while &quot;Apple Daily&quot; distributed stickers calling for Tung to resign.

In 2006, &quot;Sudden Weekly&quot; and &quot;Next Magazine&quot; ranked first and second in circulation for Hong Kong&#x27;s magazine market. &quot;Apple Daily&quot; became the No. 2 newspaper in Hong Kong.

In 2020, Lai launched an English version of &quot;Apple Daily&quot;.

===Taiwan publications===

Lai launched Taiwanese editions of &quot;Next Magazine&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Apple Daily&quot; in 2003, taking on heavily established rivals who made considerable effort to thwart him. Rival publishers pressed advertisers to boycott and distributors not to undertake home delivery. His Taiwan offices were vandalised on numerous occasions. As the publications grew to have the largest readership in their category, the advertising boycotts ended.

In October 2006, Lai launched &quot;Sharp Daily&quot; (Shuang Bao in Mandarin), a free daily newspaper targeting Taipei commuters. The company also launched &quot;Me! Magazine&quot; in Taiwan.

In building Taiwan&#x27;s most popular newspaper, &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, and magazine, &quot;Next Magazine&quot;, Lai&#x27;s racy publications were described as having a great impact on the country&#x27;s hitherto staid media culture.

===Publication challenges===

Lai&#x27;s publications remained banned in China since their inception. The ban originated from Lai&#x27;s 1994 newspaper column, where he told Premier of the PRC Li Peng, seen as a driving force behind the Tiananmen Square crackdown, to &quot;drop dead&quot;. He also called the Chinese Communist Party &quot;a monopoly that charges a premium for lousy service&quot;. China&#x27;s government retaliated against Lai by starting a shutdown of Giordano shops, prompting him to sell out of the company to save it. In addition to having his publications banned in China, businesses had distanced themselves from placing advertisements in &quot;Apple Daily&quot; to avoid retaliation from the Chinese government.

Lai had frequently faced hostility from the many Beijing-backed tycoons, including attempts to force supplier boycotts of his companies. Major Hong Kong property developers and top companies advertised only in competing publications not owned by Lai. He also faced a lengthy battle to list on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, which Lai sidestepped through a reverse takeover. He managed to list the company in 1999 by acquiring Paramount Publishing Group in October of that year.

In 2020, Apple Daily published a falsehood-ridden 64-page report produced by Typhoon Investigations alleging Joe Biden&#x27;s son Hunter had a &quot;problematic&quot; connection with the Chinese Communist Party, which was widely cited by far-right influencers such as Steve Bannon. An NBC News report linked the Typhoon Investigations to a fake &quot;intelligence firm&quot; and claimed that the author of the document, a self-identified Swiss security analyst named Martin Aspen, was a &quot;fabricated identity&quot;. The original poster of the document, Christopher Balding, admitted that he wrote parts of the document and later stated that the document had been commissioned by &quot;Apple Daily&quot;. Lai later said that he had personally &quot;nothing to do with&quot; the report, but he admitted his senior executive, Mark Simon, had &quot;worked with the project&quot;. Simon resigned following the NBC report and apologised for having &quot;allowed damage to Jimmy on a matter he was completely in the dark on&quot;. The report was among many incidents many US democracy experts believe was instrumental in the cause of the 2021 insurrection there. Lai admitted on 25 November 2024 that he told Cheung Kim-hung about featuring more negative news in an English edition of Apple Daily, which was launched in May 2020, about a month before the enactment of the Beijing-imposed security law.

==Political activities==
Lai is a longtime champion of the Hong Kong pro-democracy movement. According to Lai, &quot;The Road to Serfdom&quot; by Friedrich Hayek inspired him to fight for freedom. His advocacy had been expressed through his business ventures, such as distributing Giordano t-shirts with portraits of student leaders. His high-profile support for the pro-democracy movements came under strong condemnation from the Chinese government. As the proprietor of one of few that journals that has remained staunchly supportive of the pro-democracy cause, challenging Chinese Communist Party rule, Lai is considered an &quot;anti-China troublemaker&quot;. In May 2020, Lai told CNN news that US president Donald Trump was &quot;the only one who can save us&quot; from China, with Apple Daily publishing a similar plea addressed to Trump the same month. In the 2020 United States elections, Lai backed Trump, praising the latter for his &quot;hardline approach&quot; to Beijing.

On 13 December 2014, Lai was one of the pro-democracy leaders arrested during the clearance of the Admiralty protest site of the Umbrella Movement. On the following day, Lai announced he would step down as head of Next Media &quot;to spend more time with his family and further pursue his personal interests.&quot;

Lai had been the target of hostile attacks and disturbances, including the leaving of machetes, axes and threatening messages in his driveway. He had been rammed by a car, and his home was firebombed several times, most recently in 2019. Lai&#x27;s aide and Next Media spokesman Mark Simon condemned these attacks and stated, &quot;This is a continual effort to intimidate the press in Hong Kong. This is raw and pure intimidation.&quot; Some activists felt that the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong government, which have been Chinese-controlled since the handover in 1997, did not always follow up on these misconducts against Lai, and that culprits are rarely found.

During the early hours of 12 January 2015, two masked men hurled petrol bombs at Lai&#x27;s home on Kadoorie Avenue in Kowloon Tong. At the same time, a petrol bomb was thrown at the Next Media headquarters in Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate. The fires were extinguished by security guards. The perpetrators fled and two cars used in the attacks were found torched in Shek Kip Mei and Cheung Sha Wan. The crimes were denounced as an &quot;attack on press freedom&quot;.
Between July and November 2019 Lai was able to meet with US Vice President Mike Pence and later with US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to discuss the Hong Kong protests. Lai said, &#x27;We in Hong Kong are fighting for the shared values of the US against China. We are fighting their war in the enemy camp.&#x27; Pelosi published a photograph of herself, Lai, along with Martin Lee and Janet Pang and supporting words to the Hong Kong protesters. Lai also later met with then US National Security Adviser John Bolton. Bloomberg reporter, Nicholas Wadham tweeted that the meeting was meant to send a signal to Beijing, as it was very &quot;unusual for non governmental visitors to get this kind of access&quot;.

On 28 February 2020, Lai was arrested for illegal assembly during his attendance in the 2019–2020 Hong Kong protests, and for allegedly intimidating an &quot;Oriental Daily&quot; reporter after the reporter took photos of him in 2017. His case was scheduled to be heard at Eastern Law Court on 5 May. On 18 April 2020, Lai was among 15 high-profile democracy figures arrested in Hong Kong. According to a police statement, his arrest was based on suspicion of organising, publicizing or taking part in several unauthorized assemblies between August and October 2019.

On 3 September 2020, Lai was found not guilty of the &quot;Oriental Daily&quot; criminal intimidation charge.

In December 2020, BBC News interviewed him when he was temporarily out on bail and continuing his activism from Apple Daily newsroom. Lai tearfully admitted his fear for his family as he continues his activism. He stated that if he ended up in jail, then he was living his life meaningfully. Lai stated that &quot;If [the government] can induce fear in you, that&#x27;s the easiest way to control you&quot;, adding that inducing fear was the cheapest and most effective way to control people.

=== National security law and arrests ===

On 30 June 2020, the Hong Kong national security law was enacted by China&#x27;s parliament, by-passing the Legislative Council of Hong Kong. Before the law was enacted, Lai called it &quot;a death knell for Hong Kong&quot; and alleged that it would destroy the territory&#x27;s rule of law.

On 10 August 2020, Lai was arrested at his home for alleged collusion with foreign forces (a crime under the new national security law) and fraud. Other Next Digital staff were also arrested, and police searched the home of both Lai and his son. Later in the morning, approximately 200 Hong Kong police officers raided the offices of &quot;Apple Daily&quot; in Tseung Kwan O Industrial Estate, seizing around 25 boxes of materials. HSBC took the step to freeze his bank account.

After Lai was arrested, the stock price of Next Digital rose as high as 331 per cent on 11 August. Bail was set at HK$300,000 (approx. US$38,705), with a surety of HK$200,000 (approx. US$25,803). &quot;Apple Daily&quot; said that more than 500,000 copies of its subsequent day&#x27;s paper were printed, five times the usual number. The front page of Apple Daily showed an image of Lai in handcuffs with the headline: &quot;Apple Daily must fight on.&quot;

The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, an agency of mainland China, welcomed the arrest and called for Lai to be severely punished. The Hong Kong Journalists Association described the raid as &quot;horrendous&quot; and unprecedented in Hong Kong. The Democratic Party accused the government of trying to create a chilling effect in the Hong Kong media industry. Former governor Chris Patten called the events &quot;the most outrageous assault yet&quot; on Hong Kong&#x27;s press. The head of the University of Hong Kong journalism department called the raid an &quot;outrageous, shameful attack on press freedom&quot;.
On 2 December 2020, Lai reported to the police station as part of his bail condition for his August arrest related to ongoing national security law violation but was immediately arrested by police for alleged fraud, in that he and two Next Digital executives allegedly violated lease terms for Next Digital office space. Police referred to a further investigation into possible national security law violation against one of the three, apparently referring to Lai. The case was adjourned until April 2021, with Lai being denied bail.

On 11 December 2020, Lai became the first high-profile figure to be charged under the new national security law for allegedly conspiring and colluding with foreign forces to endanger national security. The main evidence for those charges, according to the prosecutors, consisted of statements that Lai had made on Twitter. He was accused of using Twitter and other media to request foreign sanctions against Hong Kong and mainland Chinese officials.

On 23 December 2020, Lai was granted bail by the High Court with the following conditions: HK$10 million deposit; HK$100,000 deposit by each of his three guarantors; To remain at his home at all times, except when reporting to police or attending court hearings (de facto house arrest); Surrender all travel documents; Banned from attending or hosting media interviews or programmes; Banned from publishing articles on any media, posting messages or comments on social media, including Twitter; Report to police thrice a week.

On 31 December 2020, the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal ordered him back to prison after the Department of Justice, under prosecutor Anthony Chau Tin-hang, appealed his release on bail. On 9 February 2021, Hong Kong&#x27;s top court denied his bail; a new bail application by Lai was rejected on 19 February.

On 16 February 2021, Lai was arrested while in prison for aiding activist Andy Li in his ill-fated attempt to escape to Taiwan with eleven others in August 2020.

On 1 April, he was convicted on a separate case over &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; during the 2019 protests along six other activists and politicians. On 16 April 2021, he was sentenced to 14 months in prison for the unauthorised assembly charge. As the sentencing was carried out, friends and family shouted &quot;stand strong&quot; and other words of support.

In May 2021, Lai&#x27;s assets were all frozen by the Hong Kong government, including all the shares of Next Digital Limited and the property and local bank accounts of three companies owned by him. On 28 May 2021, Lai was sentenced to additional 14 months&#x27; imprisonment over his role in an unauthorised assembly in 2019. He must now serve 20 months in prison.

On 9 December 2021, (whilst serving his 21 April 2021 sentence) Lai and two others were convicted for their roles in the banned Tiananmen candlelight vigil in Hong Kong. Lai, together with Chow Hang-tung, a vice chairperson of the now-defunct vigil organiser the Hong Kong Alliance in Support of Patriotic Democratic Movements of China, and activist and former reporter Gwyneth Ho were convicted for either taking part in or inciting others to join the vigil. On 13 December 2021, Lai was sentenced to additional 13 months&#x27; imprisonment over his role in the banned vigil.

A documentary about the political activism of Lai was released by the Acton Institute in 2022 to significant critical acclaim called &quot;The Hong Konger.&quot; In the film, Lai refers to how COVID-19 was used as a pretext for banning protesters from organizing following the initial eruption of activity that came after the extradition law was first proposed in 2019. Lai went on to state that, &quot;The younger generation and the older generation have never been so united.&quot; and that, &quot;If we just surrender, we will lose everything.&quot; The documentary is also critical of the relationship between corporate investment and the lure to Western companies of Chinese markets and the potential for profit, as Jack Wolfsohn in the &quot;National Review&quot; wrote: &quot;The documentary mentioned Wall Street&#x27;s complicity in human-rights violations committed by China. Wall Street is so focused on making profits, the documentary points out, that it ignores blatant human-rights violations committed by the Chinese government against the Uyghurs, Tibetans, and the Hong Kongers. Yet, Wall Street continues to invest in China. Lai&#x27;s reaction to this greed was predictable: &quot;Any company that will bow down to China . . . that will hurt the dignity of the American people.&quot;

At an event screening the film, Mark Clifford, president of the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong, warned of future conflicts, specifically speaking of Taiwan and beyond, &quot;It won&#x27;t stop in Taiwan. Totalitarianism is a cancer. It&#x27;s spreading.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Nat Rev &#x27;The Hong Konger&#x27; film review – Jack Wolfsohn – 6/8/2022&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2022, Lai pled not-guilty to the charges related to &quot;collusion with foreign forces.&quot;

In late 2022, Paul Lam and the Department of Justice made several appeals to the court system, in an attempt to disallow Lai from using a UK lawyer, Tim Owen. Upon rejection of the last appeal at the High Court on 28November 2022, the government turned to the NPCSC to give an interpretation of the relevant passages of the National Security Law; on 30December, the NPCSC ruled in favour of the government, giving the chief executive the power to bar foreign lawyers from cases related to national security.

On 10 December 2022, Lai was sentenced to five years and nine months, and fined 2 million Hong Kong dollars, over the fraud case.

On 17 December 2023, the U.S. State Department again called for Lai&#x27;s release shortly before his trial was set to begin. Spokesperson Matthew Miller said: &quot;We urge Beijing and Hong Kong authorities to respect press freedom in Hong Kong. Actions that stifle press freedom and restrict the free flow of information – as well as Beijing and local authorities’ changes to Hong Kong&#x27;s electoral system that reduce direct voting and preclude independent and pro-democracy party candidates from participating – have undermined Hong Kong&#x27;s democratic institutions and harmed Hong Kong&#x27;s reputation as an international business and financial hub.&quot; In December 2023, British foreign secretary David Cameron called for the release of Lai, calling the charges against him politically motivated.

On 12 August 2024 the Hong Kong Court of Final Appeal rejected the appeals by Jimmy Lai and six others against conviction for taking part in an unauthorised procession. The appeal determined the scope of &quot;operational proportionality&quot; in relation to human rights in Hong Kong. The defendants were sentenced to imprisonment. Lai&#x27;s sentence was not suspended. He remained in prison pending other charges related to national security. Lord Neuberger (former President of the UK Supreme Court) immediately became embroiled in controversy as to his presence as a judge in Hong Kong.

In September 2024, a group claiming to be Lai Chee-ying&#x27;s international legal team (comprising four members from Doughty Street Chambers) stated that they had submitted an urgent complaint to the UN Special Rapporteur on Torture. The complaint alleged that Lai Chee-ying receives only 50 minutes of outdoor exercise daily in prison, lacking necessary physical activity and sunlight exposure. It was also claimed that Lai, who has diabetes, has experienced weight loss since incarceration and is not receiving adequate treatment. Additionally, the team asserted that as a devout Catholic, Lai has been denied the opportunity to receive Holy Communion since the start of his trial. This complaint garnered attention from several overseas media outlets.

On September 27, 2024, Robertsons, the Hong Kong law firm representing Lai Chee-ying, issued a statement clarifying that Lai is receiving appropriate treatment in prison. The statement emphasized that although Lai cannot see the sky directly from his cell, he can still access sunlight through the corridor windows outside his cell. Furthermore, he is allowed approximately one hour of exercise daily in a designated area. The statement also noted that Lai is aware he can receive Holy Communion through special arrangements with the Correctional Services Department, which requires a priest to hold a Mass specifically for him. However, due to the inconvenience of this arrangement, no request has yet been made by the priest.

In October 2024, president-elect Donald Trump, during an interview with a host who said that Lai was &quot;very important to America&#x27;s Catholics and the world&#x27;s Catholics&quot; and asked whether Trump would speak to Xi Jinping about &quot;getting Jimmy Lai out and out of the country,&quot; replied &quot;100 per cent yes.&quot; Trump said that it would be &quot;so easy&quot; to free Lai from prison.

Hong Kong activist Jimmy Lai denied allegations of seeking foreign interference during his national security trial, stating he only advocated for support of Hong Kong&#x27;s freedoms. If convicted, he faces life imprisonment.

During his testimony in November 2024, Lai said he might have asked U.S. officials to sanction Beijing and Hong Kong. He has been asked to explain his meetings with then-U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and vice-president Mike Pence. According to Apple Daily, on a talk show hosted by former lawmaker Albert Ho, Lai said he asked the American government to sanction certain Chinese and Hong Kong politicians. Lai has also distanced himself from the international lobbying group &quot;Fight for Freedom, Stand with Hong Kong&quot;, saying that he only met with the group&#x27;s leaders to persuade them not to resort to violence during protests. Lai&#x27;s attorneys have been targeted by phishing attempts linked to the PRC, rape threats, and death threats.

== Films ==

=== &quot;The Hong Konger: Jimmy Lai&#x27;s Extraordinary Struggle for Freedom&quot; ===
&quot;The Hong Konger: Jimmy Lai&#x27;s Extraordinary Struggle for Freedom&quot; is a documentary film produced by American think tank Acton Institute. In the film, Lai&#x27;s various businesses are highlighted, and Lai is shown to prioritise freedom of speech and pro-democracy stances over pure entrepreneurial or profit motives. Jack Wolfsohn of &quot;National Review&quot; said that the film &quot;...sends a vital message about the importance of preserving liberty and fighting tyranny.&quot;

=== &quot;The Call of the Entrepreneur&quot; ===
&quot;The Call of the Entrepreneur&quot; is a documentary produced by Cold Water Media in which Jimmy Lai is one of the main subjects. The film premiered in Grand Rapids, Michigan, US on 17 May 2007.

== Personal life ==
Lai and his first wife, Judy, had three children. She left him for another man. In 1989 he met his current wife Teresa, then a 24-year-old college student; they married two years later, and have children together.

Lai is a practising Catholic.

==Awards==

In June 2021, Lai received the 2021 Gwen Ifill Press Freedom Award from the Committee to Protect Journalists, and in December that year, together with the staff of shuttered &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, the Golden Pen of Freedom Award from the World Association of Newspapers and News Publishers. Sebastien Lai received the latter award on behalf of his incarcerated father.

In April 2022, Lai was amongst five Hong Kong citizens to be nominated for the Nobel Peace Prize for &quot;putting his freedom on the line&quot;.

In May 2022, Lai was awarded an honorary degree from The Catholic University of America, for his faith and decision to remain in Hong Kong to fight for democracy. Due to his current imprisonment, the award was accepted by Lai&#x27;s son, Sebastien.

<doc id="269235" wikidata="Q828123" url="?curid=269235" title="New Jersey Route 413">
<text>Route 413 is a state highway located entirely in the City of Burlington, New Jersey, United States. It is an eastward extension into New Jersey of the longer Pennsylvania Route 413 (PA 413). The western terminus is in the middle of the Burlington–Bristol Bridge crossing of the Delaware River at the New Jersey–Pennsylvania state border; the eastern terminus is at an intersection with U.S. Route 130 (US 130) and County Route 543 (CR 543). Prior to the 1953 renumbering, Route 413 was Route S25, a prefixed spur of Route 25.

==Route description==

Route 413 begins at the state line, midway along the vertical-lift Burlington–Bristol Bridge, as a continuation of PA 413. As the road descends from the bridge, a toll booth spans the width of the road though a toll is only collected for westbound traffic. The highway heads eastward, heading along Keim Boulevard, and becomes maintained by Burlington County. For eastbound traffic, a right-in/right-out intersection with Veterans Drive is present while for westbound traffic, an exit for Reed Street is located before the toll booths. East of here, an oblong traffic circle, bisected by a grade crossing of NJ Transit&#x27;s River Line light rail, is found and has intersections with West Broad Street.

East of here, Route 413 continues as a divided highway with one lane in each direction passing through an area of commercial businesses. The road comes to another oblong traffic circle, with intersections at Oakland Avenue, Washington Avenue, and Lincoln Avenue. One house and two businesses are located along the eastern edge of the circle. East of this circle, Route 413 ends at a complex intersection with US 130 (on which CR 543 runs concurrently), Taylor Avenue, Salem Road, and Mott Avenue.

==History==

In the 1927 renumbering of highways in New Jersey, US 130 was assigned as a part of New Jersey State Highway Route 25, which made up US 1 and US 9 as well. During that renumbering in 1927, Route 413 was originally New Jersey State Highway Route S-25, a prefixed spur of State Highway Route 25. The highway remained intact along its alignment in Keim Road to the Burlington–Bristol Bridge until January 1, 1953.

On January 1, 1953, the New Jersey State Highway Department performed a second renumbering of state highways. State Highway Route 25, which had run at the southern terminus with Route 130, was decommissioned for the sole designation. Since State Highway Route 25 was decommissioned, State Highway Route S-25 would be orphaned and was decommissioned that day. The Highway Department renumbered S-25&#x27;s alignment to Route 413, which continued as PA 413.

<doc id="269240" wikidata="Q7021083" url="?curid=269240" title="Next Digital">
<text>Next Digital Limited (), previously known as Next Media Limited, was the largest listed media company in Hong Kong.

Founded by Jimmy Lai, it had 2,095 employees as of 30 Sep 2020. The media outlet had a user base of 5.0 million monthly unique visitors in Hong Kong, 12.3 million monthly unique visitors in Taiwan, 1.7 million in the US and 399,0002 in Canada up till 2019. &quot;Apple Daily&quot;, the newspaper of the media group, was the most read newspaper in the city. The company became defunct on 15 December 2021.

== History ==
From 20 October 2015, the company has changed its English name to Next Digital Limited, from Next Media Limited. Under a grim political climate, the news outlet&#x27;s intrepid political activism infuriated the Beijing regime. Some companies with ties to China had refrained from putting advertisements on any publication of the media group due to the heightened political pressure exerted on the business bodies in the city.

Next Media&#x27;s irreverent probe into sensitive social topics is what believed to be the reason of a triad-style vandalism targeted at the press offices, followed by the forced shut-down in 2021.

=== Raid by the police ===
On 10 August 2020, Jimmy Lai, the founder of Next Digital, was arrested by the Hong Kong Police early morning that day for alleged collusion with foreign powers after a Beijing-led investigation. A post on Twitter from the media group&#x27;s executive, Mark Simon, confirmed the arrest. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) reported that &quot;the arrest of media tycoon Jimmy Lai bears out the worst fears that Hong Kong&#x27;s National Security Law would be used to suppress critical pro-democracy opinion and restrict press freedom&quot;. Steven Butler, CPJ&#x27;s Asia program coordinator, commented, &quot;Jimmy Lai should be released at once and any charges dropped.&quot;
The Hong Kong Police made arrest of seven people aged 39 to 72 who have been accused of violating the new security law. The arrestees included Jimmy Lai (Founder of Next Digital Limited), Cheung Kim Hung (CEO of Next Digital Limited), Chow Tat Kuen, Royston (executive director and CFO of Next Digital Limited).

== Political position ==
The news media has often offered explicit, proactive support for pro-democracy groups in Hong Kong. The paper is regarded to hold libertarian views on financial and economic issues.

== Awards and recognition ==
A slew of news articles authored by journalists from Next Media had received recognition through news awards such as Human Rights Press Awards, Investigative Feature Writing, Excellence in Reporting on Women&#x27;s Issues, Hong Kong News Awards, Hong Kong Institute of Professional Photographers Awards, Excellence in Video Reporting, Spot News Photography Prizes, Chinese-Language Cartoon / Illustration Merit, Chinese-Language News Merits, etc. On the day of shutdown, queues of citizens snapped up the total 1 million copies of Apple Daily&#x27;s last print, marking a sensational end to the paper&#x27;s decades of journalism and a symbol of Hong Kong&#x27;s media pluralism.

=== &quot;The Hong Konger: Jimmy Lai&#x27;s Extraordinary Struggle for Freedom&quot; film ===
Next Digital was featured in the film, &quot;The Hong Konger: Jimmy Lai&#x27;s Extraordinary Struggle for Freedom&quot;. A documentary film produced by American think tank Acton Institute which received universally positive reviews from critics.

<doc id="269243" wikidata="Q3704214" url="?curid=269243" title="Media of Hong Kong">
<text>Hong Kong&#x27;s media consists of several different types of communications of mass media: television, radio, cinema, newspapers, magazines, websites and other online platforms.

==Overview==
Hong Kong is home to many of Asia&#x27;s biggest media entities and remains one of the world&#x27;s largest film industries. The loose regulation over the establishment of a newspaper makes Hong Kong home to many international media such as the &quot;Asian Wall Street Journal&quot; and &quot;Far Eastern Economic Review&quot;, and publications with anti-Communist backgrounds such as &quot;The Epoch Times&quot; (which is funded by Falun Gong). It also once had numerous newspapers funded by Kuomintang of Taiwan but all of them were terminated due to poor financial performance. The Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong publishes &quot;Kung Kao Po&quot;, a weekly newspaper. Until the increased repression of freedom of expression in Hong Kong following the passing of the |national security law in 2020, &#x27;Apple Daily&quot; being the most read newspaper in the city; it was eventually forced to disband in 2021. Traditional PRC government-friendly journals, &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; and &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot;, are owned by the Central Government Liaison Office. In December 2015, the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; – Hong Kong&#x27;s newspaper of record – was acquired by the Alibaba Group, with the declared aim of promoting an alternative pro-China narrative to international media.

The freedom of press nominally is protected by the Hong Kong Bill of Rights, in contrast to the rest of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, where control over media is pervasive under the General Administration of Press and Publication. However, this freedom has been in decline since the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong in 1997, and further still since the passing of the 2020 Hong Kong National Security Law. Before 2020, Hong Kong enjoyed &quot;real press freedom&quot; and ranked second in Asia after Japan in the Press Freedom Index, although it has been rapidly declining. Different views over topics sensitive in mainland China, such as the 1989 democracy movement culminating in the massacre of protestors in Tiananmen Square, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) rule, and democracy are still dynamically discussed among the media. Many books banned in China, such as the memoir of Zhao Ziyang, a former CCP party leader who stepped down in 1989, were able to be published in Hong Kong, until the crackdowns on free expression from 2020.

As of 31 December 2023, Hong Kong had:
*Daily newspapers: 90 
**Chinese-language dailies: 61
**English-language dailies: 11
**Bilingual dailies: 14
**Japanese dailies: 3
* Periodicals (Including electronic newspapers): 376

As of June 2024, Hong Kong had:
*Television services licensees: 34
**Domestic free television programme licensees: 3
**Domestic pay television programme licensees: 1
**Non-domestic television programme licensees: 9
*Government radio-television stations: 1
*Commercial radio stations / Sound broadcasting licensees: 2

==Law==

===Media authorities===
Formerly, three statutory bodies regulated media in Hong Kong, with another statutory body acting as an independent broadcaster:
*Hong Kong Broadcasting Authority (BA) regulates broadcasters in Hong Kong by licensing and penalties according to the Broadcasting Regulation.
*Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority (TELA) is responsible for monitoring television and radio broadcasting to secure proper standards.
*Telecommunications Authority, (OFCA) the regulatory agency which applied held legislative power over antitrust, spectrum allocation and telecommunications legislation.
*Radio Television Hong Kong operates as an independent government broadcaster with 7 radio channels and 3 television channels, whilst also producing programmes for public dissemination.

In 2012, BA, OFCA and TELA were merged into one to form the new Communications Authority, which combined all the functions of its three predecessor organisations in one.

Non-Governmental bodies:

*Press Council was established in July 2000. The objective of the council is to promote the professional and ethical standards of the newspaper industry, defend press freedom, and deal with public complaints against local newspapers. It is an independent organisation.

===Media regulation===
Freedom of the press and publication are enshrined in Article 27 of the Basic Law, Hong Kong&#x27;s mini-constitution, and are also protected by the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) under Article 39 of the Basic Law.

There is no law called &quot;media law&quot; in Hong Kong. Instead, the media are governed by statutory laws. In brief, there are 31 Ordinances that are directly related to mass media. Six of which are highlighted below.

*&quot;Registration of Local Newspapers Ordinance (Cap. 268)&quot;, provides for the registration of local newspapers and news agencies and the licensing of newspaper distributors.
*&quot;Books Registration Ordinance (Cap. 142) (Cap. 106)&quot;, provides for the registration and preservation of copies of books first printed, produced or published in Hong Kong.
*&quot;Telecommunications Ordinance (Cap. 106)&quot;, makes better provision for the licensing and control of telecommunications, telecommunications services and telecommunications apparatus and equipment.
*&quot;Control of Obscene and Indecent Articles Ordinance (Cap. 390)&quot; controls and classifies articles which consist of or contain material that is obscene or indecent. Obscene Articles Tribunals are established to determine whether an article is obscene or indecent.
*&quot;Broadcasting Authority Ordinance (Cap. 391)&quot;, provides for the establishment and functions of a Broadcasting Authority.
*&quot;Broadcasting Ordinance (Cap. 562)&quot;, licenses companies to provide broadcasting services and regulate the provision of broadcasting services by licensees.

The rest of the Ordinances are of less importance since they do not aim at regulating mass media, but some of their provisions do affect the operation of media organisations and also the freedom of press.

The passing of &quot;Bill of Rights Ordinance (BORO)&quot; in 1986 strengthened the protection of fundamental human rights like press freedom or freedom of speech. This has been reflected in the loosening of control over mass media. Laws that violate the principle of press freedom are gradually amended. For example, section 27 of Public Order Ordinance, which criminalised the publishing of false news, was repealed in 1989.

Nonetheless, there are still concerns among the media sector that some existing laws may still undermine the freedom of the press and publication, e.g. &quot;Official Secrets Ordinance (Cap. 521)&quot; and &quot;Public Order Ordinance (Cap. 245)&quot;.

==Media==
===Television===

Hong Kong has three broadcast television stations, ViuTV, HOY TV and TVB. The latter, launched in 1967, was the territory&#x27;s first free-to-air commercial station, and is currently the predominant TV station in the territory. Paid cable and satellite television have also been widespread. The production of Hong Kong&#x27;s soap drama, comedy series and variety shows have reached mass audiences throughout the Chinese-speaking world. Many international and pan-Asian broadcasters are based in Hong Kong, including News Corporation&#x27;s STAR TV. Hong Kong&#x27;s terrestrial commercial TV networks, Christian Broadcasting Network of Hong Kong and TVB can also be seen in neighbouring Guangdong and Macau (via cable).

However, Asia Television, Hong Kong&#x27;s first TV station, has seen a gradual decline in production quality and audience rating in recent years and faces financial difficulties. Its false report of death of Jiang Zemin severely damaged its credibility. On 1 April 2015, Hong Kong&#x27;s Executive Council gave notice that ATV&#x27;s terrestrial television licence would not be renewed and that it would instead end on 1 April 2016. RTHK and newcomer HKTVE (owned by Richard Li&#x27;s PCCW which also owns the IPTV service Now TV) took over the frequencies of ATV since 2 April 2016. In May 2017, Fantastic Television (now named HOY TV) started its free-to-air broadcast.

===Radio===

*Radio Television Hong Kong (RTHK) – government-funded, operates eight networks in Cantonese, Mandarin and English
*Commercial Radio (CR) – operates CR1, CR2 networks in Cantonese and mediumwave (AM) English-language station AM 864
*Metro Radio Hong Kong (MRHK) – operates Metro Showbiz, Metro Finance and English-language Metro Plus

=== Book publishers ===
Sino United Publishing, formed in 1988 through merger of some of the historic publishing agencies, is Hong Kong&#x27;s largest integrated publishing group. It has an estimated 80% share of the book publishing market. It is Hong Kong&#x27;s largest Chinese-language publishing group, has 51 retail outlets in the territory, and is wholly owned by Central Government Liaison Office, which also owns newspaper titles &quot;Ta Kung Pao&quot; and &quot;Wen Wei Po&quot;.

===Newspapers===

According to independent surveys conducted by The Chinese University of Hong Kong, &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; and &quot;Ming Pao&quot; are the most trusted newspapers in Hong Kong.

The Chinese language newspapers &quot;Headline Daily&quot;, &quot;Oriental Daily News&quot;, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; and &quot;Sun Daily&quot; have the highest shares in the Hong Kong newspaper market, while the &quot;Hong Kong Economic Times&quot; is the best-selling financial newspaper. &quot;The Standard&quot;, a free tabloid with a mass market strategy, is the most widely circulated English newspaper by a significant margin. Its rival, &quot;South China Morning Post&quot;, Hong Kong&#x27;s newspaper of record, has the most paid subscribers among English-language papers in Hong Kong. Since its purchase by Malaysian tycoon Robert Kuok&#x27;s Kerry Media &quot;The South China Morning Post&quot; has publication. It was announced on 11 December 2015 that Alibaba Group would acquire the &quot;South China Morning Post&quot; from Robert Kuok, who has owned it since 1993. Alibaba said that the acquisition was made out of the desire to improve China&#x27;s image in light of the western bias of the journal. The latest to join the newspaper scene is &quot;HK01&quot;, which launched in March 2016. As a Hong Kong–based advocacy media, HK01 are dedicated to disrupting discussion with interactive multimedia storytelling through the Web, print and physical space. Readers can take advantage of its in-depth reporting and all-round analysis in current affairs, local stories and lifestyle features that will help them evolve into critical thinkers.

== Media freedom ==
Although media freedom in Hong Kong is theoretically guaranteed by a bill of rights, the perceived freedom of the Hong Kong media according to the World Press Freedom Index ranks 148th out of 180 countries in 2022, having slid from 18th place in 2002. Concerns have been brought about by a number of factors and high-profile incidents affecting the media. Pundits and journalists alike have been alarmed at the erosion of journalists&#x27; ability to report the news in an objective manner. Journalists have complained about sensitive news stories critical of the government that they have been under undisguised pressure to change or soften. There has also been pressure on organisations including major financial institutions to pull advertising from newspapers that take a pro-democracy or anti-government stance, and the brazen attack on a respected newspaper editor; All told, the incidence of censorship, political pressure to self-censor and intimidation is increasing, according to PEN American Center and the International Federation of Journalists. The Hong Kong Journalists Association noted that there were at least 28 attacks on journalists covering the Umbrella Revolution. The aggressive moves made by publishing houses controlled by Sino United Publishing against independent publishers particularly since the 2014 protests, the unexplained disappearance in 2015 of four individuals linked to an independent publisher of sensitive books, as well as the acquisition of Hong Kong&#x27;s newspaper of record by Alibaba Group all increased fears of political encroachment on press freedom by parties closely linked to the communist regime.

===2003 Article 23 controversy===

In 2003, the government attempted to implement the Article 23 of the Basic Law which prohibits crimes against national security and sedition. The National Security (Legislative Provisions) Bill 2003 states that it is a legal offense for media to be seditious and disclose national secrets, but the vague definition led to concerns that it may become a political tool for accusing dissidents&#x27; voices, as has happened in Mainland China.

The bill caused a significant public outrage and a mass demonstration of 500,000 people, forcing the government to withdraw the bill and　several cabinet members to step down.

=== Booksellers disappearances ===

The disappearances of five Hong Kong people related to an independent publisher and bookstore in October to December 2015 precipitated an international outcry. The unprecedented disappearance of a person in Hong Kong, and the bizarre events surrounding it, shocked the city and crystallised international concern over the possible abduction of Hong Kong citizens by Chinese public security bureau officials and their likely rendition, and the violation of several articles of the Basic Law and the one country, two systems principle. There is widespread suspicion that they are under detention in mainland China.

=== 2020 Apple Daily arrests ===
Following the promulgation of the National Security Law in Hong Kong, &quot;Apple Daily&quot; owner Jimmy Lai was arrested for alleged as part of an investigation into an online group that canvassed foreign countries to sanction Hong Kong. On the same day activist Agnes Chow was arrested over NSL offences. The paper announced its closure on 23 June 2021.

The arrests are perceived as acts of suppression on the freedom of press in Hong Kong by the Chinese and HKSAR government.

==Controversies==

===Credibility===
Ethical studies have been conducted by four journalism groups (Hong Kong Journalists Association, Hong Kong News Executives&#x27; Association, Hong Kong Federation of Journalists, Hong Kong Press Photographers&#x27; Association). They could not deny the fact that the mass media were suffering decreasing respect of Hong Kong citizens. Journalism was no longer seen as a respectable profession. The public had little trust in newspapers. People are actually attributing different motives to journalists. While readers who are pro-government sees journalists advocating their personal views to be producing fake news, readers who are anti-government sees journalists defending power to be producing fake news. The news industry attributed this phenomenon to the citizens&#x27; complaints about the decreasing ethics of journalists.

Stories were exaggerated often violating privacy. A study was conducted by Hong Kong Journalists Association in early 2007 to find that 58.4% of journalists in Hong Kong considered that the degree of freedom of speech had decreased since the handover in 1997. Furthermore, nearly 60% of the interviewed journalists also thought that more self-censorship had been practised then than 1997. Thirty percent of media workers participating in the survey admitted to having self-censored, and some forty percent knew of colleagues who had practised self-censorship. The chairman of the HKJA pointed out that after this self-censorship of media is related to political and economic pressures traceable linked to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). She suggested that many media owners are representatives of the National People&#x27;s Congress, have investments or eye investment opportunities in the mainland and are reluctant to jeopardise the political relationship.

===Yellow journalism===
On 19 October 1998, a woman killed her two young children by pushing them out of a window from a high-rise building and then jumped to kill herself. The husband Chan Kin Hong was widely reported to have little remorse on their death, saying he has &quot;high libido&quot; but his wife lost sexual drive after giving a birth to the latest baby and he had to visit prostitutes regularly. He also met another woman and planned to have his new life.

He caused a significant public outcry. Some days later, Apple Daily published a front-page photograph showing Chan with two prostitutes soon after his family&#x27;s deaths. It was later revealed that the newspaper had paid Chan to pose for the photograph and the newspaper subsequently published a front-page apology.

This incident and other concerns over increasingly aggressive news coverage and paparazzi in the intensive media battles for readers and viewers began widespread public discussions regarding press practices and accompanying ethical concerns that continue to this day over issues of privacy, responsible reporting and journalistic standards.

===Invasion of privacy===

In August 2006, Gillian Chung of the local pop duo Twins filed a writ against &quot;Easyfinder Magazine&quot; for publishing photos of her changing backstage at a concert in Malaysia. This raised another media ethics and aggressive paparazzi concern. And again, the magazine sold well, printing two runs of the magazine, selling out twice.

The Hong Kong Television and Entertainment Licensing Authority received 2875 complaints regarding the revealing photos and the incident was referred to the Obscene Articles Tribunal for further action. On 1 November 2006, Easy Finder lost its appeal against an obscenity ruling on the published article and pictures. The appeal panel upheld the judgement, declaring the article &quot;obscene&quot;, and saying it was a &quot;calculated act of selling sexuality which is corrupting and revolting&quot;.

=== Violent assault on editor ===

Kevin Lau, who had been chief editor of the journal until January 2014, was attacked in the morning of 26 February 2014 as he was about to take breakfast at a restaurant in Sai Wan Ho, Hong Kong. He was seriously injured in a targeted knife attack. Journalists and press of the world saw the attack as an attack on press freedom. Thousands of people, led by leading journalists, attended a rally to denounce violence and intimidation of the media.

=== Siege of &quot;Apple Daily&quot; and attacks aimed at media owner ===
During the Umbrella revolution in 2014, anti-occupation protesters besieged the headquarters of Next Media, publisher of &quot;Apple Daily&quot;. They accused the paper of biased reporting. Masked men among the protesters prevented the loading of copies of &quot;Apple Daily&quot; as well as &quot;The New York Times&quot; onto delivery vans. &quot;Apple Daily&quot; sought a court injunction and a High Court judge issued a temporary order to prevent any blocking of the entrance.

On 12 November, media tycoon Jimmy Lai was the target of an offal attack at the occupied Admiralty site by three men, who were detained by volunteer marshalls for the protest site. The offices of Next Media and the home of Jimmy Lai, who controls the group, were fire-bombed in mid January 2015.

=== 2015 Policy address controversy ===
In the opening and concluding parts of his 2015 policy address, CY Leung attacked University of Hong Kong Students&#x27; Union publication, &quot;Undergrad&quot;, for allegedly advocating independence and self-determination for Hong Kong. He also criticised another HKU publication, from 2013, entitled &quot;Hong Kong Nationalism&quot;. He was criticised by pan-democrats and commentators for using the high-profile public address in an unprecedented attempt to undermine free speech and theoretical academic discussion by effectively declaring discussion of the topic &quot;taboo&quot;. The number two and number three government officials, Carrie Lam and John Tsang respectively, distanced themselves from Leung, suggesting that Leung&#x27;s controversial criticism of the magazines was personal and written by Leung himself; Leung insisted it was a team effort.

=== Sino United returns controversy ===
In January 2015, following CY Leung&#x27;s attack on a compilation book entitled &quot;Hong Kong Nationalism&quot;, Joint Publishing, Chongwa, and Commercial Press – all owned by Sino United Publishing – de-listed the title. Hong Kong media reported that Sino had published and was distributing at least five anti-Occupy titles, and its stores were displaying these prominently, whereas popular books on the Umbrella movement by pro-democracy authors had been banished from their shelves. In March 2015, Up Publications, a small independent publishing house, complained that it was suddenly and unexpectedly faced with a large number of returns from the three main subsidiaries of Sino. Twenty titles were affected by the returns, to the serious detriment to the finances of Up Publications; many of the titles returned were not politically themed. The publisher was allegedly told by a bookshop source that its stance in the 2014 occupation and its publishing of books supportive of the Umbrella Movement were responsible. Although no reason was given for the returns, political motives were suspected as two of the delisted books about the occupation were strong sellers at independent bookshops.

<doc id="269244" wikidata="Q827368" url="?curid=269244" title="New Jersey Route 175">
<text>Route 175 is a short, long state highway in Mercer County, New Jersey, United States. The route runs along a former alignment of Route 29 before the construction of the John Fitch Parkway in the 1960s. The route begins at Route 29 in the capital city of Trenton, running along Sanhican Road, River Road, and West Upper Ferry Road into Ewing Township. The route serves primarily as a frontage road for Route 29. The northernmost portion of Route 175 is parallel to the Delaware and Raritan Canal until coming to an end at a merge with Route 29 in Ewing Township.

Route 175 originates as alignment of Route 29, which followed local roads after the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering. It remained Route 29 through the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering and was moved onto the John Fitch Parkway upon its completion in the 1960s. By 1969, the original alignment was designated as Route 175 and both roads have remained the same since.

==Route description==

Route 175 begins at an off-ramp from Route 29 and Aberfeldy Drive in the capital city of Trenton. Inside the city limits of Trenton, the route carries one-way traffic northbound and is maintained by the City of Trenton. The route heads northward, progressing through the northern residential districts on Sanhican Drive. The highway continues, paralleling Route 29 for a distance. At an intersection with Afton Avenue, the continuation of Abernethy Drive, Route 175 changes names from Sanhican Drive to River Road. The road becomes two-way, enters Ewing Township, and is maintained by the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT). The highway continues, intersecting with County Route 643 (CR 643, Lower Ferry Road) in Ewing. A short distance later, both routes pass under the West Trenton Railroad Bridge, which carries CSX&#x27;s Trenton Subdivision and SEPTA&#x27;s West Trenton Line, and head along the Delaware River, passing to the south of several high-end mansions. Route 175 itself passes to the south of condominium complexes, intersecting with the access road shortly afterward. 

A short distance later, Route 175 juts to the northeast near a commercial business, interchanging with Route 29. After the short interchange, the highway continues along the side of Route 29, intersecting with Wilburtha Road (formerly an intersection with Route 39) in Ewing. The two routes continue northward, crossing through the woodlands north of Trenton, until Route 175 makes a bend to the northeast, intersecting with West Upper Ferry Road. The highway turns onto West Upper Ferry Road, heading to the northeast, crossing through a wealthy district in Ewing surrounded by woodlands. The route begins to enter fields, crossing over the Delaware and Raritan Canal on character-less bridge. After the bridge, Route 175 turns to the north onto River Road, while West Upper Ferry Road continues as CR 634.

Route 175 heads northward along the Delaware and Raritan Canal as River Road, passing through woodlands and residential homes. A short distance later, it intersects with State Police Drive, a road serving the New Jersey State Police headquarters. Continuing along the canal, Route 175 progresses northward, intersecting with Trooper Drive before crossing under Interstate 295 at Interchange 76. Route 175 continues for a short distance, becoming a divided highway just after the overpass. A short distance later, the highway comes to end as the right-of-way continues onto Route 29.

==History==

Route 175 is an original alignment of Route 29 through Trenton and Ewing designated in the 1927 renumbering of state highways in New Jersey. The original plan for a freeway along Route 29 started in the 1930s, with no progress until the 1950s. The freeway section adjacent to Route 175 utilized the right-of-way of what remained of the Trenton Water Power Canal, a 19th-century waterway utilized by the mills of Trenton for water power. Route 29&#x27;s construction resulted in the filling of the canal, and also took up much of Trenton&#x27;s available waterfront along the Delaware River Route 175 was designated as a No Passing Zone by NJDOT on September 14, 1982. The two highways (Route 175 and Route 29) have remained intact since.

<text>The djed, also djt ( 𓊽, Coptic &quot;jōt&quot; &quot;pillar&quot;, anglicized /dʒɛd/) is one of the more ancient and commonly found symbols in ancient Egyptian religion. It is a pillar-like symbol in Egyptian hieroglyphs representing stability. It is associated with the creator god Ptah and Osiris, the Egyptian god of the afterlife, the underworld, and the dead. It is commonly understood to represent his spine.

==Myth==
In the Osiris myth, Osiris was killed by Set by being tricked into a coffin made to fit Osiris exactly. Set then had the coffin with the now deceased Osiris flung into the Nile. The coffin was carried by the Nile to the ocean and on to the city of Byblos in Lebanon. It ran aground and a sacred tree took root and rapidly grew around the coffin, enclosing the coffin within its trunk. The king of the land, intrigued by the tree&#x27;s quick growth, ordered the tree cut down and installed as a pillar in his palace, unaware that the tree contained Osiris&#x27;s body.

Meanwhile, Isis searched for Osiris aided by Anubis, and discovered Osiris&#x27;s location in Byblos. Isis maneuvered herself into the favor of the king and queen and was granted a boon. She asked for the pillar in the palace hall, and upon being granted it, extracted the coffin from the pillar. She then consecrated the pillar, anointing it with myrrh and wrapping it in linen. This pillar came to be known as the pillar of &quot;djed&quot;.

==Origin and development==

The &quot;djed&quot; may originally have been a fertility cult-related pillar made from reeds or sheaves or a totem from which sheaves of grain were suspended or grain was piled around. Erich Neumann remarks that the &quot;djed&quot; pillar is a tree fetish, which is significant considering that Egypt was primarily treeless. He indicates that the myth may represent the importance of the importation of trees by Egypt from Syria. The &quot;djed&quot; came to be associated with Seker, the falcon god of the Memphite Necropolis, then with Ptah, the Memphite patron god of craftsmen. Ptah was often referred to as &quot;the noble &quot;djed&quot;&quot;, and carried a scepter that was a combination of the &quot;djed&quot; symbol and the ankh, the symbol of life. Ptah gradually came to be assimilated into Osiris. By the time of the New Kingdom, the &quot;djed&quot; was firmly associated with Osiris.

In their 2004 book &quot;The Quick and the Dead: Biomedical Theory in Ancient Egypt&quot;, Andrew Hunt Gordon and Calvin W. Schwabe speculated that the ankh, djed, and was symbols have a biological basis derived from ancient cattle culture (linked to the Egyptian belief that semen was created in the spine), thus:
* the &quot;ankh&quot;, symbol of life, thoracic vertebra of a bull (seen in cross section)
* the &quot;djed&quot;, symbol of stability, based on sacrum of a bull&#x27;s spine
* the &quot;was&quot;-sceptre, symbol of power and dominion, a staff featuring the head and tail of the god Set, &quot;great of strength&quot;

==Hieroglyphic usage==

The &quot;djed&quot; hieroglyph was a pillar-like symbol that represented stability. It was also sometimes used to represent Osiris himself, often combined &quot;with a pair of eyes between the crossbars and holding the crook and flail.&quot; The &quot;djed&quot; hieroglyph is often found together with the tyet (also known as Isis knot) hieroglyph, which is translated as life or welfare. The &quot;djed&quot; and the tyet used together may depict the duality of life. The tyet hieroglyph may have become associated with Isis because of its frequent pairing with the &quot;djed&quot;.

==Ceremonial usage==
The &quot;djed&quot; was an important part of the ceremony called &quot;raising the &quot;djed&quot;&quot;, which was a part of the celebrations of the Sed festival, the Egyptian jubilee celebration. The act of raising the &quot;djed&quot; has been explained as representing Osiris&#x27;s triumph over Seth. Ceremonies in Memphis are described where the pharaoh, with the help of the priests, raised a wooden &quot;djed&quot; column using ropes. The ceremony took place during the period when fields were sown and the year&#x27;s agricultural season would begin, corresponding to the month of Koiak, the fourth month of the Season of the Inundation. This ceremony was a part of one of the more popular holidays and celebrations of the time, a larger festival dedicated to Osiris conducted from the 13th to 30th day of the Koiak. Celebrated as it was at that time of the year when the soil and climate were most suitable for agriculture, the festival and its ceremonies can be seen as an appeal to Osiris, who was the God of vegetation, to favor the growth of the seeds sown, paralleling his own resurrection and renewal after his murder by Seth.

Further celebrations surrounding the raising of the &quot;djed&quot; are described in a relief in Amenhotep III&#x27;s Luxor Temple. In the tomb in the temple, the scene shows the raising of the &quot;djed&quot; pillar taking place in the morning of Amenhotep III&#x27;s third Sed festival, which took place in his thirty-seventh regnal year. The scene is described by Sigrid Hodel-Hoenes: 
There is also a scene depicted in the tomb to the right of the above scene which has not been well preserved. Hodel-Hoenes explains that it once showed the pharaoh, accompanied by his queen, using a rope to raise the &quot;djed&quot; pillar. Three men, probably priests of the temple of Memphis, help him in the process. A fourth priest was seen supporting the pillar. Various offerings were presented before the pillar below the ropes. The pharaoh and his queen are each accompanied by four pairs of young women resembling those of the sed-festival. Each of these women is rattling a Hathor sistrum, a musical instrument for percussion with a U-shaped handle and frame seen as resembling the face and horns of the cow goddess Hathor, while holding a menat, a protective amulet associated with Hathor, in the other hand. A line of hieroglyphs running just above the girls&#x27; heads in each row of women says, &quot;Children of the king praising (or charming) the noble &quot;djed&quot; pillar.&quot; Hodel-Hoenes interprets this as identifying the girls as the daughters of Amenhotep III.

There are three additional reliefs below these two reliefs. They depict further ceremonies that accompany the erection of the &quot;djed&quot; pillar, especially games and dances. In one, food-bearers carrying edibles weave between men dancing with heavy steps. A line of singers on the far left seems to sing a short hymn to Ptah, the text of which is written alongside the line. Singing and dancing girls can be seen in the next relief, though Hodel-Hoenes comments on their seeming lack of grace, saying, &quot;only the raised hands and the foot swinging in the air hint at the movements of a dance.&quot; The relief also depicts men involved in a boxing match and a stick dance, sports and dances which can still be seen in Egypt today.

The festival of the raising of the &quot;djed&quot; also involved reenactments conducted at Denderah, Edfu, Busiris, Memphis, and Philae. But the most elaborate and grand celebration occurred at Abydos, the cult center of Osiris. From around the end of the third millennium BC during the beginning of the Dynasty XII and perhaps as early as the Dynasty VI three hundred years earlier, reenactments of the Osiris myth – the deception and murder of Osiris by Seth, the search for Osiris by Isis and Osiris&#x27; mummification, funeral and his resurrection were performed. From the late fourth century BC, a recitation of the &quot;Lamentations of Isis and Nephthys&quot;, a poem describing Isis and Nephthys&#x27; search for Osiris, was added to the ceremony on the 25th day of Koiak. At the Osiris Temple in Abydos, these re-enactments are described as involving hundreds of priests and priestesses in the roles of the gods and goddesses, with 34 reed boats carrying the gods, a sculpture of Osiris inside an elaborate chest, 365 ornamental lamps, incense, and dozens of &quot;djed&quot; amulets.

==Usage as amulets==

The &quot;djed&quot; was often used as amulets for the living and the dead. It was placed as an amulet near the spines of mummified bodies, which was supposed to ensure the resurrection of the dead, allowing the deceased to live eternally. The &quot;Book of the Dead&quot; lists a spell which, when spoken over a gold amulet hung around the mummy&#x27;s neck, ensures that the mummy would regain use of its spine and be able to sit up. It was also painted onto coffins.

==Parallels in other cultures==
Parallels have also been drawn between the &quot;djed&quot; pillar and various items in other cultures. Sidney Smith in 1922, first suggested a parallel with the Assyrian &quot;sacred tree&quot; when he drew attention to the presence of the upper four bands of the djed pillar and the bands that are present in the center of the vertical portion of the tree. He also proposed a common origin between Osiris and the Assyrian god Assur with whom he said, the sacred tree might be associated. Cohen and Kangas suggest that the tree is probably associated with the Sumerian god of male fertility, Enki and that for both Osiris and Enki, an erect pole or polelike symbol stands beneath a celestial symbol. They also point out that the Assyrian king is depicted in proximity to the sacred tree, which is similar to the depiction of the pharaoh in the raising of the &quot;djed&quot; ceremony. Additionally, the sacred tree and the Assyrian winged disk, which are generally depicted separately, are combined in certain designs, similar to the &quot;djed&quot; pillar which is sometimes surmounted with a solar disk. Katherine Harper and Robert Brown also discuss a possible strong link between the &quot;djed&quot; column and the concept of kundalini in yoga.
==As deity==

Later in Egyptian history the Djed pillar was defied. As a deity, he served the same purpose the Djed had as a symbol.

<doc id="269253" wikidata="Q454046" url="?curid=269253" title="Maria das Neves">
<text>Maria das Neves Ceita Baptista de Sousa (born 1958) served as the 11th prime minister of São Tomé and Príncipe. She was a key figure in the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe-Social Democratic Party (MLSTP-PSD) and became the first woman head of government in the country.

==Career==

Maria das Neves received education as an economist in Cuba with specialization in public finances. Before becoming head of government, Maria das Neves worked as a civil servant in the Ministry of Finance, in the World Bank and the UN Children&#x27;s Fund (UNICEF). She married and when her two daughters had grown up, she held major government posts: Minister of Economics (1999–2001), Minister of Finance 2001/02 and Minister of Trade, Industry, and Tourism (2002).

In 2001 Fradique de Menezes was elected president with support of the Centre Party. But there was no clear majority in parliament, and the result was an unstable cohabitation with a number of short-lived cabinets headed by the opposition. A three party coalition was formed under the socialist Gabriel Costa and das Neves was member of the government.

==Prime Minister of São Tomé and Príncipe==

She held the post of prime minister from 7 October 2002 until 18 September 2004, and was the nation&#x27;s first female head of government. President Fradique de Menezes appointed das Neves as prime minister after the three-party Government of National Unity led by Gabriel Costa collapsed following complaints from the army over recent promotions. The country was in a difficult situation, being heavily indebted and dependent on aid. There were disagreements and power struggles. When an oil agreement was signed with Nigeria, there was a military coup on 16 July 2003. The president was abroad and the army and mercenaries took action, arresting das Neves and other government officials. The coup leaders complained about corruption and said that the forthcoming oil revenues would not be distributed fairly. Following international pressure, an agreement was reached and Menezes reinstated after a week. das Neves
was hospitalized after suffering a mild heart attack. She resigned as prime minister, but accepted to continue when President Menezes reaffirmed his confidence in her.

President Menezes dismissed her from the post on 15 September 2004 and asked her party to choose a new prime minister, after allegations of corruption were brought against her and members of her government. She denied participating in any corrupt practices. Three days after her dismissal, a new government led by Damião Vaz d&#x27;Almeida was sworn in. Das Neves was elected an alternate to parliament and became an MP.

==Afterwards==

Maria das Neves is a member of the Council of Women World Leaders, an international network of current and former women presidents and prime ministers, whose mission is to mobilize the highest-level women leaders globally for collective action on issues of critical importance to women and equitable development.

<text>Joaquim Rafael Branco (born 7 September 1953) is a São Toméan politician who was the 16th prime Minister of São Tomé and Príncipe from 2008 to 2010. He is the President of the Movement for the Liberation of São Tomé and Príncipe/Social Democratic Party (MLSTP/PSD).

==Life and career==
Branco was Minister of Finance from 1995 to 1996. He served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 2000 to 2001. He was Minister of Public Works in July 2003, when he was detained by the military during a briefly successful coup d&#x27;etat led by Major Fernando Pereira.

After Prime Minister Patrice Trovoada was defeated in a May 2008 vote of no confidence proposed by the MLSTP/PSD, which was then in opposition, President Fradique de Menezes asked the MLSTP/PSD to form a government in June 2008, and it chose Branco to become the next prime minister. Trovoada&#x27;s Independent Democratic Action (ADI) party denounced Menezes&#x27; designation of the MLSTP/PSD to form a government as unconstitutional.

<text>Fernando Pereira (10 May 1950 – 10 July 1985) was a Portuguese-Dutch freelance photographer, who drowned when French intelligence (DGSE) detonated a bomb and sank the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;, owned by the environmental organisation Greenpeace on 10 July 1985.

The bombing of the boat had been designed to make the ship unsalvageable. The first smaller bomb bent the propeller shaft, making repair uneconomic. Pereira stayed inside the boat to get his camera and other pieces of equipment. The second, more powerful explosion, designed to sink the boat, caused a huge inrush of seawater that drowned Pereira.

The &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot; led a flotilla of yachts protesting against French nuclear testing at Mururoa Atoll in the Tuamotu Archipelago of French Polynesia and was about to depart Auckland for a campaign of legal demonstrations in international waters near the French military operational areas at Moruroa Atoll.

==Subsequent updates==
On the twentieth anniversary of the sinking, it was revealed that the French president François Mitterrand had personally authorized the bombing. Admiral Pierre Lacoste made a statement saying Pereira&#x27;s death weighed heavily on his conscience. Also on that anniversary, Television New Zealand sought to access a video record made at the preliminary hearing where the two agents pleaded guilty. The footage has remained sealed on the court record since shortly after the conclusion of the criminal proceedings. The two agents oppose release of the footage – despite having both profited from writing books themselves on the incident – and have taken the case to the New Zealand Court of Appeal and, subsequently, the Supreme Court of New Zealand.

In 2006, Antoine Royal, brother of the French presidential candidate Ségolène Royal, revealed in an interview that their brother, Gérard Royal, a former French intelligence officer, had been the agent who put the bombs on the &quot;Rainbow Warrior&quot;.

<doc id="269269" wikidata="Q603686" url="?curid=269269" title="Hong Kong Baptist University">
<text>Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) is a public liberal arts university with a Christian education heritage in Kowloon Tong, Kowloon, Hong Kong. 

The university was established as Hong Kong Baptist College with the support of American Baptists, who provided both operating and construction funds and personnel to the school in its early years. It became a public college in 1983. It became Hong Kong Baptist University in 1994.

HKBU has five main campuses: Ho Sin Hang Campus (1966), Shaw Campus (1995), Baptist University Road Campus (1998), Kai Tak Campus (2005), and Shek Mun Campus (2006) for the College of International Education and the Hong Kong Baptist University Affiliated School Wong Kam Fai Secondary and Primary School. The first three campuses are located in the urban heart of Kowloon Tsai, while the Kai Tak Campus is located on Kwun Tong Road and the Shek Mun Campus in the Shek Mun area of Sha Tin District near Shek Mun station.

In 2005, the university and Beijing Normal University jointly established the United International College (UIC) in Zhuhai, Guangdong, China. The college was the first higher education institution founded through collaboration between a Mainland university and a Hong Kong university.

==History==
The Hong Kong Baptist College was opened on 11 September 1956 on the premises of the Pui Ching Middle School, a Baptist-affiliated secondary school, with an initial enrolment of 152 students. In 1957, the government gave the college land on Waterloo Road to build a permanent campus, which was completed in 1966.

The Hong Kong Baptist College Bill 1983 was passed by the Legislative Council on 10 August 1983. The college previously fell under the purview of the Post Secondary Colleges Ordinance and received funding from the Education Department. After this bill became law, the college instead began to receive funding from the University and Polytechnic Grants Committee.

The third reading of the Hong Kong Baptist College (Amendment) Bill was passed by the Legislative Council on 16 November 1994, transforming the college into the Hong Kong Baptist University.

==University identities==
===Emblem===
The emblem of Hong Kong Baptist University consists of three pictorial elements: the Bible, waves and knots. The Bible symbolises the unique quality of Christian education which includes moral and spiritual training in addition to academic education. The waves, on the other hand, symbolise both Hong Kong&#x27;s geographic nature as an island while echoing Confucius&#x27; dictum that &quot;the wise love water&quot; and the University&#x27;s continuing effort to improve its educational quality. The knots, the final symbol, illustrate that within God&#x27;s embrace, Christians are harmoniously linked and loved.

===Logo===
The logo, embodying a book and water motifs, was adopted after the institution was granted its university status in 1994. The acronym &quot;BU&quot; coupled with the outlined book on the logo resembles the Chinese characters of welcome () and progress (), conceptualising the merging of eastern and western cultures. The design of the logo was commended at a design competition held in October 1996. The Hong Kong Designers Association awarded a Certificate of Merit at the Design 96 Show to Kan &amp; Lau Design Consultants for creating the logo.

== Governance ==
Prior to Hong Kong&#x27;s handover, the colony&#x27;s governor was the de jure chancellor of the university. That role has been assumed by the Chief Executive of Hong Kong following the handover.

The chief executive&#x27;s role as the university&#x27;s Chancellor is enshrined in the Hong Kong Baptist University Ordinance.

For a list of pre- and post-handover university chancellors, refer to the articles for the Governor of Hong Kong and the Chief executive of Hong Kong.

== Rankings and reputation ==
HKBU was ranked 252nd worldwide by the QS World University Ranking 2025, and 251-300th worldwide by the Times Higher Education World University Rankings 2025. It was previously ranked 111th worldwide in the THE WUR 2011.

The QS Graduate Employability Ranking 2022 placed HKBU at 301-500th worldwide.

==Major facilities==


The campus is located within Kowloon City.

===Academic Community Hall===
The Academic Community Hall (AC Hall) is an auditorium located in the university. It was opened in May 1978 with a seating capacity of 1,346. Originally, the first president and co-founder of the university, Dr. Lam Chi-fung, conceived the idea of building a hall for university functions. In 1970, on the occasion of their golden wedding anniversary, Dr. and Mrs. Lam donated half a million dollars towards the construction of the auditorium. A local architect, Eric Cumine, took charge of the project. However, Dr. Lam died the following year before the project got underway. The Board of Governors decided to honour Dr. Lam by expanding the planned auditorium into a much larger scale project – the development of the Lam Chi-fung Memorial Building. As a part of the project, the Academic Community Hall would serve as a cultural centre for the university and its surrounding community, thus providing a direct link between town and gown.

===Communication and Visual Art Building===
The Communication and Visual Art Building is located in 5 Hereford Road, Kowloon Tong. The building was built for the School of Communication and Academy of Visual Arts.

===Library===
HKBU Library is an essential component of the University, providing academic resources, support for learning, and research assistance to the HKBU community. It was established concurrently with the founding of Hong Kong Baptist College in 1956. As the institution grew and became a full-fledged university in 1994, the library expanded its collections and services. 

The College’s first library was called the Bessie Fleming Library, after the wife of donor William Fleming. In 1975 the Lui Ming Choi Library was added and became the circulating library, while the Bessie Fleming Library became a reference library. In December 1984 the Fong Shu Chuen Library was opened. In 1995, the Au Shue Hung Memorial Library (AML) replaced the Fong Shu Chuen Library as the main library serving the University. This library now houses most of the collection and study areas. Apart from the AML, there are three branch libraries: the European Documentation Centre (established in 1996), the Dr. Stephen Riady Chinese Medicine Library (opened in 2001), and the Shek Mun Campus Library (opened in 2006).
With the advent of the digital era, HKBU Library has placed more emphasis on electronic resources to facilitate learning and research. The physical collection has been gradually reduced in size, while investments in digital information resources including through digitization have been increased. In recent years, the library has committed to accelerating research and knowledge transfer by fostering an open access culture and enhancing the visibility of HKBU research output.

===Lo Siu Tong College===
The Lo Siu Tong College building is under construction.

==Students&#x27; residences==
The Student Residence Halls of HKBU are located at the &quot;Baptist University Road&quot; campus:
* Ching-Ling Soong Hall, (C.L. Soong Hall, )
* Chen-Ning Yang Hall, (C.N. Yang Hall, )
* Shu-Ren Zhou Hall, (S.R. Zhou Hall, )
* Yuan-Pei Cai Hall, (Y.P. Cai Hall, )

==The College of International Education==
The College of International Education (CIE), which is under the School of Continuing Education, offers programmes from certificates, higher diplomas, professional diplomas, associate degrees, undergraduate and higher degrees for over 6,300 full-time students and 8,200 part-time students to have the opportunities to pursue further study. CIE has their academic activities mainly in the new Shek Mun Campus (8 On Muk Street, Shek Mun, Sha Tin). The rest of the academic activities are based in Madam Chan Wu Wan Kwai School of Continuing Education Tower on campus, and acquired a 48,000 sq. ft. office in Franki Centre, Kowloon Tong.

<text>Bihor County (, ) is a county (județ) in western Romania. With a total area of , Bihor is Romania&#x27;s 6th largest county geographically and the main county in the historical region of Crișana. Its capital city is Oradea (Nagyvárad).

==Toponymy==
The origin of the name Bihor is uncertain, except that it likely takes its name from an ancient fortress in the current commune of Biharia. It possibly came from &quot;vihor&quot;, the Serbian and Ukrainian word for &quot;whirlwind&quot; (вихор), or Slavic &quot;biela hora&quot;, meaning &quot;white mountain&quot;. Another theory is that Biharea is of Daco-Thracian etymology (&quot;bi&quot; meaning &quot;two&quot; and &quot;harati&quot; &quot;take&quot; or &quot;lead&quot;), possibly meaning two possessions of land in the Duchy of Menumorut (Ménmarót). Another theory is that the name comes from &quot;bour&quot;, the Romanian term for aurochs (from the Latin word &quot;bubalus&quot;). The animal once inhabited the lands of northwestern Romania. Under this controversial theory, the name changed from &quot;buar&quot; to &quot;buhar&quot; and to &quot;Bihar&quot; and &quot;Bihor&quot;.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms of Bihor County was adopted in 1998, and is a quarterly shield featuring a castle (for the Castle of Bihar), five wheat stalks with a ribbon,a grape and a scroll with the text of &quot;Deșteaptă-te, române!&quot;, covered with a fess featuring three fish. It was subject to redesign in 2013 after it was discovered by a local teacher that the text on the scroll was erroneously written in Greek, rather than Cyrillic (the original alphabet used to write the poem&#x27;s text) or the Latin alphabet. The county has no significant history with Greece.

==Geography==
This county has a total area of . In the eastern side of the county there are the Apuseni Mountains, with the highest peak being the Cucurbăta Mare (also known as the Bihor Peak), at . The heights decrease westwards, passing through the hills an ending in the Romanian Western Plain – the eastern side of the Pannonian plain.

The county is mainly the Criș hydrographic basin with the rivers Crișul Repede (Sebes Körös), Crișul Negru (Fekete Körös), and Barcău the main rivers.

===Neighbours===

* Sălaj County (Szilágy), Cluj County (Kolozs), and Alba County (Fehér) in the East.
* Hungary in the West – Hajdú-Bihar County and Békés County
* Satu Mare County (Szatmár) in the North.
* Arad County in the South.

==History==
Prior to World War I, the territory of the county belonged to Austria-Hungary and mostly was contained in the Bihar County of the Kingdom of Hungary. After the collapse of Austria-Hungary at the end of the war, and the declaration of the Union of Transylvania with Romania, the Romanian Army took control of the county in April 1919, during the Hungarian–Romanian War. The territory of Bihor County was officially transferred to the Kingdom of Romania from Hungary as successor state to Austria-Hungary in 1920 under the Treaty of Trianon. After the administrative unification law in 1925, the name of the county remained as it was, but the territory was reorganized.

In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. Ten &quot;ținuturi&quot; (approximate translation: &quot;lands&quot;) were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by &quot;rezidenți regali&quot; (approximate translation: &quot;Royal Residents&quot;) – appointed directly by the king – instead of the prefects. Bihor County became part of Ținutul Crișuri.

In August 1940, under the auspices of Nazi Germany, which imposed the Second Vienna Award, Hungary retook the territory of Northern Transylvania (which included part of the county) from Romania. In October 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. In September 1950, the county was disestablished by the communist government of Romania and was replaced by the Bihor Region, whose territory comprised an area similar to the old county. Bihor County was re-established in February 1968, when Romania restored the county administrative system.

==Economy==
Bihor is one of the wealthiest counties in Romania, with a GDP per capita well above the national average. Recently, the economy has been driven by a number of construction projects.

==Historical county==

Historically, the county was located in the central part of Greater Romania, in the southeastern part of Transylvania. Its capital was Brașov. Its territory included the part of the old region of Țara Bârsei. The county&#x27;s territory was enlarged as a result of the administrative reform of 1925. Its territory covered the eastern part of today&#x27;s Braşov County and the south of today&#x27;s Covasna County.

It was bordered on the west by the counties of Făgăraș and Muscel, to the north by Trei Scaune County, to the east by Buzău County, and to the south by the counties of Prahova and Dâmbovița.

===History===
Prior to World War I, the territory of the county belonged to Austria-Hungary and was identical with the Brassó County of the Kingdom of Hungary. After the Hungarian–Romanian War of 1918–1919, the territory of Brașov County came under the administration of the Kingdom of Romania; it was formally transferred to Romania from Hungary as the successor state to Austria-Hungary in 1920 under the Treaty of Trianon.

In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently, he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. 10 &quot;ținuturi&quot; (approximate translation: &quot;lands&quot;) were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by &quot;rezidenți regali&quot; (approximate translation: &quot;Royal Residents&quot;) - appointed directly by the King - instead of the prefects. Brașov County became part of Ținutul Argeș.

In 1940, part of the county was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of Northern Transylvania under the Second Vienna Award. In September 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. The county was disestablished by the communist government of Romania in 1950, when it was incorporated in the larger Stalin Region, renamed Brașov Region in 1960. Brașov County was re-established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system.

===Administration===
Until the administrative reform of 1925, Brașov County was divided into three administrative districts (&quot;plăși&quot;), 23 rural communes, and one urban commune (Brașov).

After 1925, the area of the county was similarly divided into three districts:
#Plasa Bran, headquartered at Bran.
#Plasa Buzăul Ardelean, headquartered at Întorsura Buzăului.
#Plasa Săcele (previously named Plasa Brașov), headquartered at Prejmer.

Plasa Bran included the following settlements: Bran, Codlea, Cristian, Fundata, Ghimbav, Hălchiu, Holbav, Măgura, Moieciul de Jos, Moieciul de Sus, Peștera, Poiana Mărului, Predeal, Râșnov, Satu Nou, Șimon, Sohodol, Șirnea, Tohanu Nou, Tohanu Vechi, Țânțari, Vlădeni, Vulcan, and Zărnești.

Plasa Buzăul Ardelean included the following settlements: Barcani, Budila, Dobârlău, Întorsura Buzăului, Mărcuș, Sărămaș, Sita Buzăului, Teliu, and Vama Buzăului.

Plasa Săcele included the following settlements: Apața, Baciu, Bod, Cernatu, Crizbav, Feldioara, Hărman, Măieruș, Prejmer, Purcăreni, Rotbav, Satulung, Sânpetru, Tărlungeni, Turcheș, and Zizin.

===Economy=== 
As a mountain county, agriculture was poorly developed in Brașov. Much of the county&#x27;s agricultural land was devoted to potatoes, and orchards were planted in hilly areas. Livestock breeding (predominantly cattle and pigs) was an important activity.

Such industry as there was in the county was concentrated in the city of Brașov. In 1925, it had production centers in the chemical, metallurgical, construction, food, textile, machine, pharmaceutical and light industries. Surrounding areas excelled in the metallurgy, extractive, construction, food, textile, and light industries. The city of Brașov was also the main outlet of the county for local products.

Among the natural richness of the county were Zizin&#x27;s mineral waters, containing sodium bicarbonate, iron, iodine, and carbonic acid. Lignite was exploited at Prejmer, and bituminous coal at Vulcan and Cristian.

===Education===
In 1925, there was a state high school (lyceum) for boys and another one for girls, four religious high schools for boys, a gymnasium, six secondary schools, four commercial schools, a normal school for educators, a school of arts and crafts and a school of state for commercial and industrial apprentices. The number of state primary schools was 19 and the religious was 53 (of which, in the Romanian language: 17 Orthodox and 3 Roman Catholic; in the German language: 2 Roman Catholic and 18 Lutheran; in the Hungarian language: 2 Reformed and 10 Lutheran; and one Jewish school)

===Population===
The census of 1920 reported 101,953 inhabitants (about ), of which 36,138 were ethnic Romanians, 33,584 Hungarians, 30,281 Germans, 1,560 Jews, and 390 of other nationalities.

According to the census data of 1930, the county&#x27;s population was 168,125, of which 49.9% were Romanians, 26.6% Hungarians, 19.8% Germans, as well as other minorities. In the religious aspect, the population consisted of 48.8% Eastern Orthodox, 27.8% Lutheran, 9.9% Roman Catholic, 6% Reformed, 2.4% Greek Catholic, 1.7% Jewish, as well as other minorities.

In 1930, the urban population of the county was 59,232, of which 39.3% were Hungarians, 32.7% Romanians, 22.0% Germans, 3.8% Jews, as well as other minorities. As a mother tongue in the urban population, Hungarian was 42.2%, followed by Romanian (32.7%), German (22.4%), Yiddish (0.9%) as well as other minorities. From the religious point of view, the urban population was made up of 30.0% Eastern Orthodox, 22.3% Roman Catholic, 22.0% Evangelical (Lutheran), 13.9% Reformed (Calvinist), 4.4% Jewish, 3.5% Greek Catholic, 3.2% Unitarian, as well as other minorities.

==Historical county==

Historically, the county was located in the central-southern part of Greater Romania, in the northeastern part of the historical region of Muntenia. Its territory included the southern and western parts of today&#x27;s Buzău County and several localities that are today in Prahova County, including the town of Mizil. It was bordered on the west by Prahova County, to the north by the counties of Brașov, Trei Scaune, and Putna, to the east by the counties of Râmnicu Sărat and Brăila, and to the south by Ialomița County.

===Administration===

The county has seen multiple subdivisions administratively.

At the end of the 19th century, the county was subdivided into six districts (&quot;plăși&quot;):
#Plasa Sărata, with the town of Buzău and 16 communes
#Plasa Câmpului, with 14 communes
#Plasa Tohani, with the town of Mizil and 17 communes
#Plasa Buzău, with 17 communes
#Plasa Pârscov, with 16 communes

#Plasa Buzău, headquartered at Pătârlagele
#Plasa Câmpul, headquartered at Buzău
#Plasa Slănic, headquartered at Săpoca
#Plasa Tohani, headquartered at Mizil

Subsequently, the territory of the county was reorganized into seven districts, by abolishing Plasa Câmpul and establishing four new districts:
#Plasa Buzău, headquartered at Pătârlagele
#Plasa Câlnău, headquartered at Buzău
#Plasa Câmpeni, headquartered at Pogoanele
#Plasa Orașul, headquartered at Buzău
#Plasa Pârscov, headquartered at Pârscov
#Plasa Slănic, headquartered at Săpoca
#Plasa Tohani, headquartered at Mizil

<text>Cluj County () is a county () of Romania, in Transylvania. Its seat is Cluj-Napoca.

==Name==
In Hungarian it is known as &quot;Kolozs megye&quot;. Under the Kingdom of Hungary, a county with an identical name (Kolozs County, ) existed since the 11th century.

== Geography ==

Cluj County lies in the northwestern half of the country, between parallels 47°28&#x27; in north and 46°24&#x27; in south, meridians 23°39&#x27; in west and 24°13&#x27; in east, respectively. It covers an area of 6,674 km2 unfolded in the contact zone of three representative natural units: Apuseni Mountains, Someș Plateau and Transylvanian Plain. Cluj County is the 12th largest in the country and occupies 2.8% of Romania&#x27;s area. It is bordered to the northeast with Maramureș and Bistrița-Năsăud counties, to the east with Mureș County, to the south with Alba County, and to the west with Bihor and Sălaj counties.

=== Relief ===
The relief is rugged, constituted mostly of hilly units belonging to Someș Plateau and, to a lesser extent, of mountain portions that represent the northeastern part of Apuseni Mountains. Fields are missing on the territory of Cluj County, being replaced, as step of relief, by well-developed terraces and floodplains in the lower sectors of Someșul Mic and Arieș rivers. The hilly area, extended in the central northern and southern part of the county, include several subunits of Someș Plateau (Cluj, Feleacu, Dej hills), among which are individualized numerous depressions (Apahida, Bonțida, Gilău, Dej, Turda, Câmpia Turzii) at the edge of which there are some contact depressions (Huedin and Iara), at the limit of the mountain. The mountain sector, located in southwest, belongs to Apuseni, mountains group of Western Carpathians, represented by sectors of Vlădeasa Massif (peak Vlădeasa – 1,836 m), Gilău Mountains and Muntele Mare, as well as narrow portions of Trascău, Plopiș, Meseș and Bihor mountains. In the eastern part of Cluj County, east of the river alignment Valea Florilor–Maraloiu–Someșul Mic, is located a part of the Hilly Plain of Transylvania, a special unit of relief, with mountainous character, partially overlapped by some gas-condensate domes.

=== Hydrographic network ===

The hydrographic network is represented by rivers (Someșul Mic with SW–NE direction, whose catchment area is fully developed on the territory of Cluj County, Crișul Repede and lower Arieș), natural lakes and ponds (Cătina Popii I and II, Geaca, Țaga, etc.) and lakes of hydropower interest (Beliș-Fântânele, Tarnița and Gilău). In the northeastern part of Cluj County, Someșul Mic joins Someșul Mare, upstream of Dej, forming the Someș, which flows into the Tisza to the west.

The deep waters are less represented and are characterized by high mineralization. Relatively rich mineral springs, with sulphates, calcium and sodium chloride, can be found in Dezmir, Cojocna, Gădălin, Sic, Gherla, Leghia, Someșeni, Turda, etc.

=== Climate ===

Through its location, Cluj County benefits from a moderate continental climate. In the mountain sector (Vlădeasa Massif and Muntele Mare), the mean annual air temperature is 2 °C, and in the rest of the territory is 6 °C. Annual thermal amplitudes have values between 17 and 19 °C in the mountains and grow at 23–25 °C in hilly areas, plateaus and plains.

Rainfall is distributed unevenly, with minimal amounts in Turda–Câmpia Turzii (about 550 mm) and maximum in Vlădeasa Massif (about 1,400 mm). On average, annual values of rainfall reach 600–650 mm in the Transylvania Plain, 650–700 mm in the Someș Plateau and over 900–1000 mm in mountainous areas.

=== Natural resources ===

Cluj County has rich and varied natural resources. Iron ores came into use in 1962, by exploitations in Căpușu Mic and Băișoara, being conducted over the years a series of geological explorations in Vlaha, Săvădisla and Cacova Ierii. Fossil fuels are represented by brown coal exploited in Ticu–Dâncu–Băgara area and peat, exploited in Călățele–Căpățâna sector. Likewise, there is a gas-condensed dome in Puini in the Transylvanian Plain.

Besides iron ore and mineral fuels, there is a variety of useful minerals and rocks, including: quartz in Muntele Mare and around Someșu Rece (where can also be found feldspar), dacites and andesites in Vlădeasa Massif and around Morlaca, Bologa, Poieni, Săcuieu, Stolna and Iara, granites in Muntele Mare, limestones and dolomites used to fabricate binders (lime, cement), exploited in Săndulești, Tureni, Surduc, Buru, Poieni, etc., calcareous tuffs of high quality with quarries at Tioc–Cornești, kaolin sands at Popești, Topa, Băgara, Gârbău, etc., salt, with significant reserves at Ocna Dejului, Turda, Cojocna, Sic, Nireș, gravel pits on Someșul Mic at Gilău, Florești and on lower Arieș.

=== Vegetation ===

The vegetation is heterogeneous and storeyed due to the prevalence of hilly and mountainous relief. In Cluj County can be met a wide range of plant formations. Sub-alpine floor, present in Vlădeasa Massif and Muntele Mare, is characterized by lawns with midget grasses and juniper bushes. The spruce forests floor, expanded on mountain slopes between 1,000 and 1,600 m, consists predominantly of spruce mixed with fir, and the deciduous forests floor develops on all forms of relief, ranging from 400 to 1,000 m, and consists of sessile forests mixed with beech, hornbeam or elm. On slopes with northern exposure of Luna and Lujerdiu valleys develop compact clusters of sessile, hornbeam, ash and elm forests. In the Hilly Plain of Transylvania appear islands of steppe, alternating with patches of forests.

=== Fauna ===
The fauna is adapted to vegetation flooring, but less constant to its limits, due to great mobility; it is rich in species. In forests are present numerous animals of cynegetic interest, including deer, stag, bear, fox, lynx, wild boar, squirrel, and on Someș Valley naturally entered the muskrat. Around artificial lakes live a series of birds (duck, coot, stork), in the Someș Plateau and Transylvanian Plain was colonized the pheasant, and in Turda Gorge area lives the rock eagle. Mountain rivers are populated with trouts, graylings and nases, and in the lower ones with barbel and chub.

==Historical county==

Historically, Cojocna County was located in the central-northwestern part of Greater Romania, in the northwestern part of Transylvania. After reorganized and renamed to Cluj County, its territory included all of the current Cluj County, and some of the communes now in Sălaj County and Mureș County. It was bordered on the north by the counties of Sălaj, Someș, and Năsăud, on the west by Bihor County, on the south by Turda County, and to the east by Mureș County.

===History===
The territory of the county was transferred in 1920 from the Kingdom of Hungary, as successor state to Austria-Hungary, to Romania by the Treaty of Trianon. Thus, Cluj County was the successor to the former Hungarian administrative unit of Kolozs County (). Until the year 1925 it was called Cojocna County (). In Hungarian, the town of Cojocna is called &quot;Kolozs&quot;, so it was a rough equivalent of the prior Hungarian name. Cojocna County&#x27;s headquarters were in Cluj, but Cluj enjoyed the status of a free city. In 1925, the autonomous status of Cluj was abolished, and the free city was merged with the county of Cojocna, which was renamed Cluj County.

In 1938, King Carol II promulgated a new Constitution, and subsequently he had the administrative division of the Romanian territory changed. 10 &quot;ținuturi&quot; (approximate translation: &quot;lands&quot;) were created (by merging the counties) to be ruled by &quot;rezidenți regali&quot; (approximate translation: &quot;Royal Residents&quot;) - appointed directly by the King - instead of the prefects. Cluj County became part of Ținutul Crișuri.

In 1940, part of the county was transferred back to Hungary with the rest of Northern Transylvania under the Second Vienna Award. The parts of the county that remained under Romanian administration (the south of the county, including Feleacu), were united with Turda County and became Cluj-Turda County. Beginning in 1944, Romanian forces with Soviet assistance recaptured the ceded territory and reintegrated it into Romania. Romanian jurisdiction over the entire county per the Treaty of Trianon was reaffirmed in the Paris Peace Treaties, 1947. The county was disestablished by the communist government of Romania in 1950, and re-established in 1968 when Romania restored the county administrative system.

===Administration===

As of 1925, the county had an area of 5,079 km2 and a population of 352,029 inhabitants, consisted of 226 rural communes (equivalent to today&#x27;s villages), and one urban commune (the city of Cluj), and was administratively subdivided into twelve districts (&quot;plăși&quot;):
#Plasa Aghireșu, headquartered at Aghireșu
#Plasa Almaș, headquartered at Hida
#Plasa Borșa, headquartered at Borșa
#Plasa Călata, headquartered at Călata
#Plasa Câmpia, headquartered at Sărmașu
#Plasa Criș, headquartered at Ciucea
#Plasa Huedin, headquartered at Huedin
#Plasa Mociu, headquartered at Mociu
#Plasa Moților, headquartered at Gilău
#Plasa Nădășel, headquartered at Baciu
#Plasa Someș, headquartered at Răscruci
#Plasa Vlaha, headquartered at Vlaha

The administration and territory of the county were reorganized in 1929, introducing municipalities, towns, communes and villages. The county&#x27; capital remained at Cluj (now Cluj-Napoca). The county had nine districts comprising one city (Cluj), one town Huedin, and 232 villages divided into seven other districts:

#Plasa Aghireșu, headquartered at Aghireșu, containing 28 villages
#Plasa Borșa, headquartered at Borșa, containing 20 villages

<text>Constanța () is a county (județ) of Romania on the border with Bulgaria, in the Dobruja region. Its capital city is also named Constanța.

== Demographics ==

In 2021, it had a population of 655,997 and the population density was 92/km2. The degree of urbanization is much higher (about 75%) than the Romanian average. In recent years the population trend is:

The majority of the population are Orthodox Romanians. There are important communities of Muslim Turks and Tatars, remnants of the time of Ottoman rule. Currently the region is the centre of the Muslim minority in Romania. A great number of Aromanians have migrated to Dobruja in the last century, and they consider themselves a cultural minority rather than an ethnic minority. There are also Romani.

==Geography==
*Călărași County and Ialomița County are to the west.
*Tulcea County and Brăila County are to the north.

Agriculture is an important part in the county&#x27;s economy, with Constanța being the county with the largest irrigation systems in the country (more than 4,300 km2 before 1989, now greatly reduced), cereals being the most important products. Also, the county is famous for its wines from the Murfatlar region.

At Cernavodă there is a nuclear power plant with two reactors, each of the CANDU type of Canadian design. The plant covers over 15% of the country&#x27;s power demand.

The Port of Constanța is the largest port in Romania, the most important of the Black Sea and the 4th in Europe. It is linked with the Danube by the Danube-Black Sea Canal – the widest and deepest navigable channel in Europe, although it is not used to its full potential.

==Historical county==

Following the 1926 administrative reform, the borders of the historical county are identical to the ones of the current Constanța County, with the exception of the Ostrov and Lipnița communes, which were then administered by the Durostor County, the Baia commune, now part of Tulcea County, and the villages of Tereskondu, Pârâul Caprei, Fundeni, Pădureni, Saldu Alde and Enigea-Haidar, now in Bulgaria.

===Geography===

The county neighboured the Black Sea to the east, the counties of Tulcea and Brăila to the north, Ialomița to the west, Durostor to the south-west and Caliacra to the south.

===Administration===
The county originally consisted of four districts (&quot;plăși&quot;):
#Plasa Dunărea
#Plasa Mangalia
#Plasa Ovidiu
#Plasa Traian

Subsequently, the territory of the county was reorganized into seven districts:
#Plasa Cernavodă, headquartered in Cernavodă
#Plasa Dunărea, headquartered in Hârșova
#Plasa Ferdinand, headquartered in Constanța
#Plasa Mangalia, headquartered in Mangalia
#Plasa Negru-Vodă, headquartered in Negru Vodă
#Plasa Traian, headquartered in Ion Corvin
#Plasa Medgidia, headquartered in Medgidia

On the territory of Constanta County there were seven urban localities: Constanţa (with city status) and the urban communes of Carmen-Sylva, Techirghiol, Mangalia, Medgidia, Cernavodă and Hârșova.

===After 1938===
After the 1938 Administrative and Constitutional Reform, this county merged with the counties of Ialomița, Durostor and Caliacra to form Ținutul Mării. It was re-established in 1940 after the fall of Carol II&#x27;s regime. Ten years later, it was abolished by the Communist regime.
