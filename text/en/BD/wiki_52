<text>The preschool educational television program &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was first aired on public television stations on November 10, 1969, and has reached its 55th season in 2025. The history of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; has reflected changing attitudes to developmental psychology, early childhood education, and cultural diversity. Featuring Jim Henson&#x27;s Muppets, animation, live shorts, humor and celebrity appearances, it was the first television program of its kind to base its content and production values on laboratory and formative research, and the first to include a curriculum &quot;detailed or stated in terms of measurable outcomes&quot;. Initial responses to the show included adulatory reviews, some controversy and high ratings. By its 40th anniversary in 2009, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was broadcast in over 120 countries, and 20 independent international versions had been produced. It has won eleven Grammys and over 150 Emmys in its history—more than any other children&#x27;s show.

The show was conceived in 1966 during discussions between television producer Joan Ganz Cooney and Carnegie Corporation vice president Lloyd Morrisett. Their goal was to create a children&#x27;s television show that would &quot;master the addictive qualities of television and do something good with them&quot;, such as helping young children prepare for school. After two years of research, the newly formed Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) received a combined grant of $8 million from the Carnegie Corporation, the Ford Foundation and the U.S. federal government to create and produce a new children&#x27;s television show.

By the show&#x27;s tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of six were watching &quot;Sesame Street&quot; daily, and several studies showed it was having a positive educational impact. The cast and crew expanded during this time, including the hiring of women in the crew and additional minorities in the cast. In 1981, the federal government withdrew its funding, so the CTW turned to other sources, such as its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing and foreign income. During the 1980s, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s curriculum expanded to include topics such as relationships, ethics and emotions. Many of the show&#x27;s storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast and crew, most notably the death of Will Lee—who played Mr. Hooper—and the marriage of Luis and Maria.

In recent decades, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; has faced societal and economic challenges, including changes in the viewing habits of young children, more competition from other shows, the development of cable television and a drop in ratings. After the turn of the 21st century, the show made major structural adaptations, including changing its traditional magazine format to a narrative format. Because of the popularity of the Muppet Elmo, the show incorporated a popular segment known as &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;. In late 2015, in response to &quot;sweeping changes in the media business&quot;, HBO began airing first-run episodes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. As of its 50th anniversary in 2019, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; has produced over 10653 episodes, 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel had almost 5 million subscribers, and the show had 24 million followers on social media.

==Background==
In the late 1960s, 97% of all American households owned a television set, and preschool children watched an average of 27 hours of television per week; programs created for them were widely criticized for being too violent and for reflecting commercial values. Producer Joan Ganz Cooney called children&#x27;s programming a &quot;wasteland&quot;, and she was not alone in her criticism. Many children&#x27;s television programs were produced by local stations, with little regard for educational goals, or cultural diversity. As writer David Borgenicht stated, the use of children&#x27;s programming as an educational tool was &quot;unproven&quot; and &quot;a revolutionary concept&quot;.

According to children&#x27;s media experts Edward Palmer and Shalom M. Fisch, children&#x27;s television programs of the 1950s and 1960s duplicated &quot;prior media forms&quot;. For example, they tended to show simple shots of a camera&#x27;s-eye view of a location filled with children, or they recreated storybooks with shots of book covers and motionless illustrated pages. The hosts of these programs were &quot;insufferably condescending&quot;, though one exception was &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, created and hosted by Bob Keeshan, which author Michael Davis described as having a &quot;slower pace and idealism&quot; that most other children&#x27;s shows lacked.

Early childhood educational research had shown that when children were prepared to succeed in school, they earned higher grades and learned more effectively. Children from low-income families had fewer resources than children from higher-income families to prepare them for school. Research had shown that children from low-income, minority backgrounds tested &quot;substantially lower&quot; than middle-class children in school-related skills, and that they continued to have educational deficits throughout school. The field of developmental psychology had grown during this period, and scientists were beginning to understand that changes in early childhood education could increase children&#x27;s cognitive growth. Because of these trends in education, along with the great societal changes occurring in the United States during this era, the time was ripe for the creation of a show like &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

==Pre-production (1966–1969)==

===Beginnings===

Since 1962, Cooney had been producing talk shows and documentaries at educational television station WNDT, and in 1966 had won an Emmy for a documentary about poverty in America. In early 1966, Cooney and her husband Tim hosted a dinner party at their apartment in New York; experimental psychologist Lloyd Morrisett, who has been called &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s&quot; &quot;financial godfather&quot;, and his wife Mary were among the guests. Cooney&#x27;s boss, Lewis Freedman, whom Cooney called &quot;the grandfather of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&quot;, also attended the party, as did their colleague Anne Bower. As a vice-president at the Carnegie Corporation, Morrisett had awarded several million dollars in grants to organizations that educated poor and minority preschool children. Morrisett and the other guests felt that even with limited resources, television could be an effective way to reach millions of children.

A few days after the dinner party, Cooney, Freedman, and Morrisett met at the Carnegie Corporation&#x27;s offices to make plans; they wanted to harness the addictive power of television for their own purposes, but did not yet know how. The following summer, Morrisett hired her to conduct research on childhood development, education and media, and she visited experts in these fields across the United States and Canada. She researched their ideas about the viewing habits of young children and wrote a report on her findings.

Cooney&#x27;s study, titled &quot;The Potential Uses of Television for Preschool Education&quot;, spelled out how television could be used to help young children, especially from low-income families, prepare for school. The focus on the new show was on children from disadvantaged backgrounds, but Cooney and the show&#x27;s creators recognized that in order to achieve the kind of success they wanted, it had to be equally accessible to children of all socio-economic and ethnic backgrounds. At the same time, they wanted to make the show so appealing to inner-city children that it would help them learn as much as children with more educational opportunities.

Cooney proposed that public television, even though it had a poor track record in attracting inner-city audiences, could be used to improve the quality of children&#x27;s programming. She suggested using the television medium&#x27;s &quot;most engaging traits&quot;, including high production values, sophisticated writing, and quality film and animation, to reach the largest audience possible. In the words of critic Peter Hellman, &quot;If [children] could recite Budweiser jingles from TV, why not give them a program that would teach the ABCs and simple number concepts?&quot; Cooney wanted to create a program that would spread values favoring education to nonviewers—including their parents and older siblings, who tended to control the television set. To this end, she suggested that humor directed toward adults be included, which, as Lesser reported, &quot;may turn out to be a pretty good system in forcing the young child to stretch to understand programs designed for older audiences&quot;. By 2019, 80% of parents watched &quot;Sesame Street&quot; with their children.

===Development===

As a result of Cooney&#x27;s proposal, the Carnegie Corporation awarded her a $1 million grant in 1968 to establish the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop (CTW) to provide support to the creative staff of the new show. Morrisett, who was responsible for fundraising, procured additional grants from the United States federal government, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, and the Ford Foundation for the CTW&#x27;s initial budget, which totaled $8 million; obtaining funding from this combination of government agencies and private foundations protected the CTW from economic pressures experienced by commercial networks. &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was an expensive program to produce because the creators decided they needed to compete with other programs that invested in professional, high quality production.

The producers spent eighteen months preparing the new show, something unprecedented in children&#x27;s television. The show had a budget of $28,000 per episode. After being named executive director of the CTW, Cooney began to assemble a team of producers: Jon Stone was responsible for writing, casting, and format; David Connell took over animation and volume; and Samuel Gibbon served as the show&#x27;s chief liaison between the production staff and the research team. Stone, Connell, and Gibbon had worked on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot; together, but were not involved in children&#x27;s television when Cooney recruited them. At first, Cooney planned to divide the show&#x27;s production of five episodes a week among several teams, but she was advised by CBS vice-president of programming Michael Dann to use only one. This production team was led by Connell, who had gained experience producing many episodes in a short period of time, a process called &quot;volume production&quot;, during his eleven years working on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;.

The CTW hired Harvard University professor Gerald S. Lesser to design the show&#x27;s educational objectives and establish and lead a National Board of Advisers. Instead of providing what Lesser called &quot;window dressing&quot;, the Board actively participated in the construction of educational goals and creative methods. At the Board&#x27;s direction, Lesser conducted five three-day curriculum planning seminars in Boston and New York City in summer 1968. The purpose of the seminars was to ascertain which school-preparation skills to emphasize in the new show. The producers gathered professionals with diverse backgrounds to obtain ideas for educational content. They reported that the seminars were &quot;widely successful&quot;, and resulted in long and detailed lists of possible topics for inclusion in the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; curriculum; in fact, the seminars produced more suggested educational objectives than could ever be addressed by one television series.

Instead of focusing on the social and emotional aspects of development, the producers decided to follow the suggestions of the seminar participants and emphasize cognitive skills, a decision they felt was warranted by the demands of school and the wishes of parents. The objectives developed during the seminars were condensed into key categories: symbolic representation, cognitive processes, and the physical and social environment. The seminars set forth the new show&#x27;s policy about race and social issues and provided the show&#x27;s production and creative team with &quot;a crash course&quot; in psychology, child development, and early childhood education. They also marked the beginning of Jim Henson&#x27;s involvement in &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Cooney met Henson at one of the seminars; Stone, who was familiar with Henson&#x27;s work, felt that if they could not bring him on board, they should &quot;make do without puppets&quot;.

The producers and writers decided to build the new show around a brownstone or an inner-city street, a choice Davis called &quot;unprecedented&quot;. Stone was convinced that in order for inner-city children to relate to &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, it needed to be set in a familiar place. Despite its urban setting, the producers decided to avoid depicting more negativity than what was already present in the child&#x27;s environment. Lesser commented, &quot;[despite] all its raucousness and slapstick humor, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; became a sweet show, and its staff maintains that there is nothing wrong in that&quot;.

The new show was called the &quot;Preschool Educational Television Show&quot; in promotional materials; the producers were unable to agree on a name they liked and waited until the last minute to make a decision. In a short, irreverent promotional film shown to public television executives, the producers parodied their &quot;naming dilemma&quot;. The producers were reportedly &quot;frantic for a title&quot;; they finally settled on the name that they least disliked: &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, inspired by Ali Baba&#x27;s magical phrase, although there were concerns that it would be too difficult for young children to pronounce. Stone was one of the producers who disliked the name, but, he said, &quot;I was outvoted, for which I&#x27;m deeply grateful&quot;.

The responsibility of casting for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; fell to Jon Stone, who set out to form a cast where white actors were in the minority. He did not begin auditions until spring 1969, several weeks before five test shows were due to be produced. He filmed the auditions, and Palmer took them into the field to test children&#x27;s reactions. The actors who received the &quot;most enthusiastic thumbs up&quot; were cast. For example, Loretta Long was chosen to play Susan when the children who saw her audition stood up and sang along with her rendition of &quot;I&#x27;m a Little Teapot&quot;. Stone reported that casting was the only aspect that was &quot;just completely haphazard&quot;. Most of the cast and crew found jobs on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; through personal relationships with Stone and the other producers. Stone hired Bob McGrath (an actor and singer best known at the time for his appearances on Mitch Miller&#x27;s sing-along show on NBC) to play Bob, Will Lee to play Mr. Hooper, and Garrett Saunders to play Gordon.

===Use of research in production===
&quot;Sesame Street&quot; was the first children&#x27;s television program that used a curriculum with clear and measurable outcomes, and was the first to use research in the creation of the show&#x27;s design and content. Research in &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had three functions: to test if the show was appealing to children, to discover what could be done to make the show more appealing, and to report to the public and the investors what impact the show had on its young viewers. Ten to fifteen percent of the show&#x27;s initial budget of $8 million was devoted to research, and researchers were always present in the studio during the show&#x27;s filming. A &quot;Writer&#x27;s Notebook&quot; was developed to assist writers and producers in translating the research and production goals into televised material; this connected the show&#x27;s curriculum goals and its script development. The Muppet characters were created to fill specific curriculum needs: Oscar the Grouch, for example, was designed to teach children about their positive and negative emotions. Lesser called the collaboration between researchers and producers, as well as the idea of using television as an educational tool, the &quot;CTW model&quot;. Cooney agreed, commenting, &quot;From the beginning, we—the planners of the project—designed the show as an experimental research project with educational advisers, researchers, and television producers collaborating as equal partners&quot;.

The producers of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; believed education through television was possible if they captured and sustained children&#x27;s attention; this meant the show needed a strong appeal. Edward Palmer, the CTW&#x27;s first Director of Research and the man Cooney credited with building the CTW&#x27;s foundation of research, was one of the few academics in the late 1960s researching children&#x27;s television. He was recruited by the CTW to test if the curricula developed in the Boston seminars were reaching their audience effectively. Palmer was also tasked with designing and executing the CTW&#x27;s in-house research and with working with the Educational Testing Service (ETS). His research was so crucial to Sesame Street that Gladwell asserted, &quot;... without Ed Palmer, the show would have never lasted through the first season&quot;.

Palmer and his team&#x27;s approach to researching the show&#x27;s effectiveness was innovative; it was the first time formative research was conducted in this way. For example, Palmer developed &quot;the distractor&quot;, which he used to test if the material shown on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; captured young viewers&#x27; attention. Two children at a time were brought into the laboratory; they were shown an episode on a television monitor and a slide show next to it. The slides would change every seven seconds, and researchers recorded when the children&#x27;s attention was diverted away from the episode. They were able to record almost every second of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; this way; if the episode captured the children&#x27;s interest 80–90% of the time, the producers would air it, but if it only tested 50%, they would reshoot. By the fourth season of the show, the episodes rarely tested below 85%.

===July 1969 test episodes===

During the production of &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s&quot; first season, producers created five one-hour episodes to test the show&#x27;s appeal to children and examine their comprehension of the material. Not intended for broadcast, they were presented to preschoolers in 60 homes throughout Philadelphia and in day care centers in New York City in July 1969. The results were &quot;generally very positive&quot;; children learned from the shows, their appeal was high, and their attention was sustained over the full hour. However, the researchers found that although children&#x27;s attention was high during the Muppet segments, their interest wavered during the &quot;Street&quot; segments, when no Muppets were on screen. This was because the producers had followed the advice of child psychologists who were concerned that children would be confused if human actors and Muppets were shown together. As a result of this decision, the appeal of the test episodes was lower than the target.

The Street scenes, as Palmer described them, were &quot;the glue&quot; that &quot;pulled the show together&quot;, so producers knew they needed to make significant changes. On the basis of their experience on &quot;Captain Kangaroo&quot;, Connell, Stone, and Gibbon thought the experts&#x27; opinions were &quot;nonsense&quot;; Cooney agreed. Lesser called their decision to defy the recommendations of their advisers &quot;a turning point in the history of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&quot;. The producers reshot the Street segments; Henson and his coworkers created Muppets that could interact with the human actors, specifically Oscar the Grouch and Big Bird, who became two of the show&#x27;s most enduring characters. In addition, the producers found Saunders&#x27; role as Gordon not to be as likable by children watching the show, resulting in the character being recast by Matt Robinson, who was initially the show&#x27;s filmed segments producer. These test episodes were directly responsible for what Gladwell called &quot;the essence of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;—the artful blend of fluffy monsters and earnest adults&quot;.

==Premiere and first season (1969–1970)==
Two days before the show&#x27;s premiere, a thirty-minute preview entitled &quot;This Way to Sesame Street&quot; aired on NBC. The show was financed by a $50,000 grant from Xerox. Written by Stone and produced by CTW publicist Bob Hatch, it was taped the day before it aired. &quot;Newsday&quot; called the preview &quot;a unique display of cooperation between commercial and noncommercial broadcasters&quot;.

The first season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; premiered on November 10, 1969. It was widely praised for its originality, and was well received by parents as well as children. The show reached only 67.6% of the nation, but earned a 3.3 Nielsen rating, meaning 1.9 million households and 7 million children watched it each day. In &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s&quot; first season, the ETS reported that children who watched the show scored higher in tests than less-frequent viewers.

In November 1970, the cover of &quot;Time&quot; magazine featured Big Bird, who had received more fan mail than any of the show&#x27;s human hosts. The magazine declared, &quot;... It is not only the best children&#x27;s show in TV history, it is one of the best parents&#x27; shows as well&quot;. An executive at ABC, while recognizing that &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was not perfect, said the show &quot;opened children&#x27;s TV to taste and wit and substance&quot; and &quot;made the climate right for improvement&quot;. Other reviewers predicted commercial television would be forced to improve its children&#x27;s programming, something that did not substantially occur until the 1990s. &quot;Sesame Street&quot; won a Peabody Award, three Emmys, and the Prix Jeunesse award in 1970. President Richard Nixon sent Cooney a congratulatory letter, and Dr. Benjamin Spock predicted the program would result in &quot;better-trained citizens, fewer unemployables in the next generation, fewer people on welfare, and smaller jail populations&quot;.

&quot;Sesame Street&quot; was not without its detractors; there was little criticism of the show in the months following its premiere, but it increased at the end of its first season and beginning of the second season. In May 1970, a state commission in Mississippi voted to not air the show on the state&#x27;s newly launched public television network, which at the time had only one station in Jackson. A member of the commission leaked the vote to &quot;The New York Times,&quot; stating that &quot;Mississippi was not yet ready&quot; for the show&#x27;s integrated cast. A commercial television station in Jackson picked up the show instead. Cooney called the ban &quot;a tragedy for both the white and black children of Mississippi&quot;. The state commission reversed its decision three weeks later after the vote made national news.

The producers of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; made a few changes in its second season. Segments that featured children became more spontaneous and allowed more impromptu dialogue, even when it meant cutting other segments. Since federal funds had been used to produce the show, more segments of the population insisted upon being represented on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;; for example, the show was criticized by Hispanic groups for the lack of Latino characters in the early years of production. A committee of Hispanic activists, commissioned by the CTW in 1970, called &quot;Sesame Street&quot; &quot;racist&quot; and said the show&#x27;s bilingual aspects were of &quot;poor quality and patronizing&quot;. The CTW responded to these critics by hiring Hispanic actors, production staff, and researchers. By the mid-70s, Morrow reported that &quot;the show included Chicano and Puerto Rican cast members, films about Mexican holidays and foods, and cartoons that taught Spanish words&quot;.

While &quot;New York Magazine&quot; reported criticism of the presence of strong single women in the show, organizations like the National Organization for Women (NOW) expressed concerns that the show needed to be &quot;less male-oriented&quot;. For example, members of NOW took exception to the character Susan, who was originally a housewife. They complained about the lack of, as Morrow put it, &quot;credible female Muppets&quot; on the show; Morrow reported that Henson&#x27;s response was that &quot;women might not be strong enough to hold the puppets over the long hours of taping&quot;. The show&#x27;s producers responded by making Susan a nurse and by hiring a female writer.

==1970s==
By the mid-1970s, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, according to Davis, had become &quot;an American institution&quot;. ETS conducted two &quot;landmark&quot; studies of the show in 1970 and 1971 which demonstrated &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had a positive educational impact on its viewers. The results of these studies led to the producers securing funding for the show over the next several years, and provided the CTW with additional ways to promote it. By the second season, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had become so popular that the design of ETS&#x27; experiments to track the show&#x27;s educational outcomes had to be changed: instead of comparing viewers with a control group of non-viewers, the researchers studied the differences among levels of viewing. They found that children who watched &quot;Sesame Street&quot; more frequently had a higher comprehension of the material presented.

Producer Jon Stone was instrumental in guiding the show during these years. According to Davis, Stone &quot;gave &quot;Sesame Street&quot; its soul&quot;; without him &quot;there would not have been &quot;Sesame Street&quot; as we know it&quot;. Frank Oz regarded Stone as &quot;the father of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&quot;, and Cooney considered Stone &quot;the key creative talent on &quot;Sesame Street&quot; and &quot;probably the most brilliant writer of children&#x27;s material in America&quot;. Stone was able to recognize and mentor talented people for his crew. He actively hired and promoted women during a time when few women earned top production jobs in television. His policies provided the show with a succession of female producers and writers, many of whom went on to lead the boom in children&#x27;s programming at Nickelodeon, Disney Channel, and PBS in the 1990s and 2000s. One of these women was Dulcy Singer, who later became the first female executive producer of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

After the show&#x27;s initial success, its producers began to think about its survival beyond its development and first season and decided to explore other funding sources. The CTW decided to depend upon government agencies and private foundations to develop the show. This would protect it from the financial pressures experienced by commercial networks, but created problems in finding continued support. This era in the show&#x27;s history was marked by conflicts between the CTW and the federal government; in 1978, the U.S. Department of Education refused to deliver a $2 million check until the last day of the CTW&#x27;s fiscal year. As a result, the CTW decided to depend upon licensing arrangements, publishing, and international sales for its funding. Henson owned the trademarks to the Muppet characters: he was reluctant to market them at first, but agreed when the CTW promised that the profits from toys, books, and other products were to be used exclusively to fund the CTW. The producers demanded complete control over all products and product decisions; any product line associated with the show had to be educational, inexpensive, and not advertised during its airings. The CTW approached Random House to establish and manage a non-broadcast materials division. Random House and the CTW named Christopher Cerf to assist the CTW in publishing books and other materials that emphasized the curriculum. In 1980, the CTW began to produce a touring stage production based upon the show, written by Connell and performed by the Ice Follies.

Shortly after the premiere of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, the CTW was approached by producers, educators, and officials in other nations, requesting that a version of the show be aired in their countries. Former CBS executive Mike Dann left commercial television to become vice-president of the CTW and Cooney&#x27;s assistant; Dann began what Charlotte Cole, vice president for the CTW&#x27;s International Research department, called the &quot;globalization&quot; of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. A flexible model was developed, based upon the experiences of the creators and producers of the original show. The shows came to be called &quot;co-productions&quot;, and they contained original sets, characters, and curriculum goals. Depending upon each country&#x27;s needs and resources, different versions were produced, including dubbed versions of the original show and independent programs. By 2016, 39 different coproductions have been created and produced, &quot;each with its own local name, its own Muppets..., and its own educational objectives designed to meet the educational needs of local children&quot;. By its 50th anniversary in 2019, 150 million children viewed over 150 versions of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; in 70 languages. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported in 2005 that income from the CTW&#x27;s international co-productions of the show was $96 million.

&quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s&quot; cast expanded in the 1970s, better fulfilling the show&#x27;s original goal of greater diversity in both human and Muppet characters. The cast members who joined the show were Sonia Manzano (Maria), who also wrote for the show, Northern Calloway (David), Alaina Reed (Olivia), Emilio Delgado (Luis), Linda Bove (Linda), and Buffy Sainte-Marie (Buffy). In 1973, Roscoe Orman became the third actor to play Gordon.

New Muppet characters were introduced during the 1970s. Count von Count was created and performed by Jerry Nelson, who also voiced Mr. Snuffleupagus, a large Muppet that required two puppeteers to operate. Richard Hunt, who, in Jon Stone&#x27;s words, joined the Muppets as a &quot;wild-eyed 18-year-old and grew into a master puppeteer and inspired teacher&quot;, created Gladys the Cow, Forgetful Jones, Don Music, and the construction worker Sully. Telly Monster was performed by Brian Muehl; Marty Robinson took over the role in 1984. Frank Oz created Cookie Monster. Matt Robinson created the &quot;controversial&quot; (as Davis called him) character Roosevelt Franklin. Fran Brill, the first female puppeteer for the Muppets, joined the Henson organization in 1970, and originated the character Prairie Dawn. In 1975, Henson created &quot;The Muppet Show&quot;, which was filmed and produced in London; Henson brought many of the Muppet performers with him, so opportunities opened up for new performers and puppets to appear on &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

The CTW wanted to attract the best composers and lyricists for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, so songwriters like Joe Raposo, the show&#x27;s music director, and writer Jeff Moss were allowed to retain the rights to the songs they wrote. The writers earned lucrative profits, and the show was able to sustain public interest. Raposo&#x27;s &quot;I Love Trash&quot;, written for Oscar the Grouch, was included on the first album of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; songs, &quot;The Sesame Street Book &amp; Record&quot;, recorded in 1970. Moss&#x27; &quot;Rubber Duckie&quot;, sung by Henson for Ernie, remained on the Top-40 Billboard charts for seven weeks that same year. Another Henson song, written by Raposo for Kermit the Frog in 1970, &quot;Bein&#x27; Green&quot;, which Davis called &quot;Raposo&#x27;s best-regarded song for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&quot;, was later recorded by Frank Sinatra and Ray Charles. &quot;Sing&quot;, which became a hit for The Carpenters in 1973, and &quot;Somebody Come and Play&quot;, were also written by Raposo for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;.

In 1977 the show became the first to have a depiction of breastfeeding on television.

In 1978, Stone and Singer produced and wrote the show&#x27;s first special, the &quot;triumphant&quot; &quot;Christmas Eve on Sesame Street&quot;, which included an O Henry-inspired storyline in which Bert and Ernie gave up their prized possessions—Ernie his rubber ducky and Bert his paper clip collection—to purchase each other Christmas gifts. Bert and Ernie were played by Frank Oz and Jim Henson, who in real life were, like the puppets they played, colleagues and friends. To Davis, this demonstrated the puppeteers&#x27; remarkable ability to play &quot;puppetry&#x27;s Odd Couple&quot;. In Singer&#x27;s opinion, the special—which Stone also wrote and directed—demonstrated Stone&#x27;s &quot;soul&quot;, and Sonia Manzano called it a good example of what &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was all about. The special won Emmys for Stone and Singer in 1979, beating, among others, the independently produced &quot;A Special Sesame Street Christmas&quot; for CBS.

By the show&#x27;s tenth anniversary in 1979, nine million American children under the age of six were watching &quot;Sesame Street&quot; daily. Four out of five children had watched it over a six-week period, and 90% of children from low-income inner-city homes regularly viewed the show.

==1980s==
In 1984, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) deregulated commercial restrictions on children&#x27;s television. Advertising during network children&#x27;s programs almost doubled, and deregulation resulted in an increase in commercially oriented programming. &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was successful during this era of deregulation despite the fact that the United States government terminated all federal funding of the CTW in 1981. By 1987, the show was earning $42 million per year from its magazine division, book royalties, product licensing, and foreign income—enough to cover two-thirds of its expenses. Its remaining budget, plus a $6 million surplus, was covered by revenue from its PBS broadcasts.

According to Davis, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s second decade was spent &quot;turning inward, expanding its young viewers&#x27; world&quot;. The show&#x27;s curriculum grew to include more &quot;affective&quot; teaching—relationships, ethics, and positive and negative emotions. Many of the show&#x27;s storylines were taken from the experiences of its writing staff, cast, and crew. 

In 1982, Will Lee, who had played Mr. Hooper since the show&#x27;s premiere, died. For the 1983 season, the show&#x27;s producers and research staff decided they would explain Mr. Hooper&#x27;s death to their preschool audience, instead of recasting the role: the writer of that episode, Norman Stiles, said, &quot;We felt we owed something to a man we respected and loved&quot;. They convened a group of psychologists, religious leaders, and other experts in the field of grief, loss, and separation. The research team conducted a series of studies before the episode to ascertain if children were able to understand the messages they wanted to convey about Mr. Hooper&#x27;s death; the research showed most children did understand. Parents&#x27; reactions to the episode were, according to the CTW&#x27;s own reports, &quot;overwhelmingly positive&quot;. The episode, which won an Emmy, aired on Thanksgiving Day in 1983 so parents could be home to discuss it with their children. Author David Borgenicht called the episode &quot;poignant&quot;; Davis called it &quot;a landmark broadcast&quot; and &quot;a truly memorable episode, one of the show&#x27;s best&quot;. Caroll Spinney, who played Big Bird and who drew the caricatures prominently used in the episode, reported the cast and crew were moved to tears during filming.

In the mid-1980s, Americans were becoming more aware of the prevalence of child abuse, so &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s researchers and producers decided to &quot;reveal&quot; Mr. Snuffleupagus in 1985. &quot;Snuffy&quot; had never been seen by any of the adults on the show and was considered Big Bird&#x27;s &quot;imaginary friend&quot;. The show&#x27;s producers were concerned about the message being sent to children; &quot;If children saw that the adults didn&#x27;t believe what Big Bird said (even though it was true), they would be afraid to talk to adults about dramatic or disturbing things that happened to them&quot;.

For the 1988 and 1989 seasons, the topics of love, marriage, and childbirth were addressed when the show presented a storyline in which the characters Luis and Maria fall in love, marry, and have a child named Gabi. Sonia Manzano, the actress who played Maria, had married and become pregnant; according to the book &quot;Sesame Street Unpaved&quot;, published after the show&#x27;s thirtieth anniversary in 1999, Manzano&#x27;s real-life experiences gave the show&#x27;s writers and producers the idea. Before writing began, research was done to gain an understanding of what previous studies had revealed about preschoolers&#x27; understanding of love, marriage, and family. The show&#x27;s staff found that at the time that there was very little relevant research done about children&#x27;s understanding of these topics, and no books for children had been written about them. Studies done after the episodes about Maria&#x27;s pregnancy aired showed that as a result of watching these episodes, children&#x27;s understanding of pregnancy increased.

==1990s==
Davis called the 1990s a &quot;time of transition on Sesame Street&quot;. Several people involved in the show from its beginnings died during this period: Jim Henson in 1990 at the age of 53 &quot;from a runaway strep infection gone stubbornly, foolishly untreated&quot;; songwriter Joe Raposo from non-Hodgkin&#x27;s lymphoma fifteen months earlier; long-time cast member Northern Calloway of cardiac arrest in January 1990; puppeteer Richard Hunt of AIDS in early 1992; CTW founder and producer David Connell of bladder cancer in 1995; director Jon Stone of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis in 1997; and writer Jeff Moss of colon cancer in 1998.

By the early 1990s, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was, as Davis put it, &quot;the undisputed heavyweight champion of preschool television&quot;. &quot;Parade Magazine&quot; reported in 2019 that the show&#x27;s music had been honored with 11 children&#x27;s Grammys. The show&#x27;s dominance however, was challenged for the first time by another PBS television show for preschoolers, &quot;Barney &amp; Friends&quot;, causing &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s&quot; ratings to decline. The producers of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; responded, at the show&#x27;s twenty-fifth anniversary in 1993, by expanding and redesigning the show&#x27;s set, calling it &quot;Around the Corner&quot;. With Michael Loman as the new executive producer of the show, new human and Muppet characters were introduced, including Zoe (performed by Fran Brill), baby Natasha and her parents Ingrid and Humphrey, and Ruthie (played by comedian Ruth Buzzi). The &quot;Around the Corner&quot; set was dismantled in 1998. Zoe, one of the few characters that survived, was created to include another female Muppet on the show, to break stereotypes of girls, and to provide female viewers with a positive role model. According to Davis, she was the first character developed on the show by marketing and product development specialists, who worked with the researchers at the CTW. (The quest for a &quot;break-out&quot; female Muppet character continued into 2006 with the creation of Abby Cadabby, who was created after nine months of research.) In 1998, for the first time in the show&#x27;s history, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; pursued funding by accepting corporate sponsorship. Consumer advocate Ralph Nader urged parents to protest the move by boycotting the show.
For &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s 30th anniversary in 1999, its producers researched the reasons for the show&#x27;s lower ratings. For the first time since the show debuted, the producers and a team of researchers analyzed &quot;Sesame Street&quot; content and structure during a series of two-week-long workshops. They also studied how children&#x27;s viewing habits had changed since the show&#x27;s premiere. They found that although &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was produced for three- to five-year-olds, children began watching it at a younger age. Preschool television had become more competitive, and the CTW&#x27;s research showed the traditional magazine format was not the best way to attract young children&#x27;s attention. The growth of home videos during the 1980s and the increase of thirty-minute children&#x27;s shows on cable had demonstrated that children&#x27;s attention could be sustained for longer periods of time, but the CTW&#x27;s researchers found that their viewers, especially the younger ones, lost attention in &quot;Sesame Street&quot; after 40 to 45 minutes.

Beginning in 1998, a new 15-minute segment shown at the end of each episode, &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot;, used traditional elements (animation, Muppets, music, and live-action film), but had a more sustained narrative. &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; followed the same structure each episode, and depended heavily on repetition. Unlike the realism of the rest of the show, the segment took place in a stylized crayon-drawing universe as conceived by its host. Elmo, who represented the three- to four-year-old child, was chosen as host of the closing segment because he had always tested well with this segment of their audience. He was created in 1980 and originally performed by Brian Muehl, and later Richard Hunt, but did not become what his eventual portrayer, Kevin Clash, called a &quot;phenomenon&quot; until Clash took over the role in 1985. Eventually, Elmo became, as Davis reported, &quot;the embodiment&quot; of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, and &quot;the marketing wonder of our age&quot; when five million &quot;Tickle Me Elmo&quot; dolls were sold in 1996. Clash believed the &quot;Tickle Me Elmo&quot; phenomenon made Elmo a household name and led to the &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; segment.

==2000s==
On June 5, 2000, the Children&#x27;s Television Workshop changed its name to Sesame Workshop to better reflect its entry into non-television and interactive media, CTW Sesame Street sign changed its name to 123 Sesame Street sign, www.ctw.org changed its website name to www.sesameworkshop.org. In 2002, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;″s producers went further in changing the show to reflect its younger demographic by fundamentally changing the show&#x27;s structure, which had relied on &quot;Street scenes&quot; interrupted by live-action videos and animation. The target age for &quot;Sesame Street&quot; shifted downward, from four years to three years, after the show&#x27;s 33rd season. As co-executive producer Arlene Sherman stated, &quot;We basically deconstructed the show&quot;. The producers expanded upon the &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; by changing from a magazine format to a narrative format, which made the show easier for young children to navigate. Sherman called the show&#x27;s new look &quot;startlingly different&quot;. Following its tradition of addressing emotionally difficult topics, &quot;Sesame Street&#x27;s&quot; producers chose to address the attacks of 9/11 during this season on its premiere episode, which aired February 4, 2002. This episode, as well as a series of four episodes that aired after Hurricane Katrina in 2005, were used in Sesame Workshop&#x27;s Community Outreach program.

In 2006, the United States Department of State called &quot;Sesame Street&quot; &quot;the most widely viewed children&#x27;s television show in the world&quot;. Over half of the show&#x27;s international co-productions were made after 2001; according to the 2006 documentary &quot;The World According to Sesame Street&quot;, the events of 9/11 inspired the producers of these co-productions. In 2003, &quot;Takalani Sesame&quot;, a South African co-production, elicited criticism in the United States when its producers created Kami, the first HIV-positive Muppet, whose purpose was educating children in South Africa about the epidemic of AIDS. The controversy, which surprised Sesame Workshop, was short-lived and died down after Kofi Annan and Jerry Falwell praised the Workshop&#x27;s efforts. By 2006, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; had won more Emmy Awards than any other children&#x27;s show, including winning the outstanding children&#x27;s series award for twelve consecutive years—every year the Emmys included the category. By 2009, the show had won 118 Emmys throughout its history, and was awarded the Outstanding Achievement Emmy for its 40 years on the air.

The 2008–2009 recession, which led to budget cuts for many nonprofit arts organizations, severely affected &quot;Sesame Street&quot;; in spring 2009, Sesame Workshop had to lay off 20% of its staff. By the show&#x27;s 40th anniversary, it was ranked the fifteenth most popular children&#x27;s show on television. When the show premiered in 1969, 130 episodes a year were produced; starting in 2003, because of rising costs, twenty-six episodes were made. According to the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot;, corporate funding &quot;dried up&quot; and DVD sales &quot;bottomed up&quot;. Also by 2009, Sesame Workshop started a new website containing a large library of classic and more recent free video clips, as well as a series of podcasts.

Starting in 2009, the producers of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; took steps to bring back older viewers; it was also successful in increasing its audience viewership among 3- to 5-year-olds by the end of the 40th season. In 2012, the show&#x27;s 43rd season, &quot;Elmo&#x27;s World&quot; was replaced with &quot;Elmo the Musical&quot;, which was targeted at the program&#x27;s older viewers.

==2010s==
In October 16, 2011, &quot;Sesame Street&quot;&#x27;s YouTube channel was compromised by hackers that deleted the entire channel&#x27;s uploaded videos and replaced them with pornographic content. The channel was closed down in less than 30 minutes by YouTube due to &quot;repeated or severe violations of our Community Guidelines&quot;.

In 2014, in response to increased online and mobile viewing and to the increase in competition from other preschool programs, Sesame Workshop and PBS began producing, airing, and streaming a half-hour version of the program. The hour-long version continued to air on PBS in the mornings and the new version, which consisted of fewer segments, aired in the afternoons, when more children watched television. PBS also began to stream full-length episodes on its website, mobile app, and Roku channel. Also in 2014, Sesame Workshop began an online streaming subscription service called Sesame Go, which aired both old and new episodes of the show.

In late 2015, as part of a five-year programming and development deal, it was announced that premium television service HBO would air first-run episodes of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;. Episodes became available on PBS stations and websites nine months after they aired on HBO. The move came after &quot;sweeping changes in the media business&quot;. &quot;Sesame Street&quot; was operating at a loss of $11 million in 2014; according to the &quot;Hollywood Reporter&quot; in 2019, it was one of the reasons for the move to HBO the following year. The deal allowed Sesame Workshop to produce more episodes, about 35 new episodes per season, compared to the 18 episodes per season it aired previously, and provided the opportunity to create a spinoff series with the &quot;Sesame Street&quot; Muppets and a new educational series. Steve Youngwood, SW&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer, called the move &quot;one of the toughest decisions we ever made&quot;. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the move &quot;drew an immediate backlash&quot;. Critics claimed that it favored privileged children over less-advantaged children and their families, the original focus of the show. They also criticized choosing to air first-run episodes on HBO, a network with adult dramas and comedies. In 2017, in response to the changing viewing habits of toddlers, the show&#x27;s producers decreased its length of episodes presented on all platforms from one hour to thirty minutes, focused on fewer characters, reduced the pop culture references &quot;once included as winks for their parents&quot;, and focused &quot;on a single backbone topic&quot;.

In April 2017, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; introduced Julia, the first Muppet with autism. Her puppeteer, Stacey Gordon, is the mother of an autistic son. The character had already been featured in digital and printed storybooks since 2015.

As of its 50th anniversary in 2019, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; has produced over 4,500 episodes, 35 TV specials, 200 home videos, and 180 albums. Its YouTube channel had almost 5 million subscribers, and the show had 24 million followers on social media. As part of its 50th anniversary PR campaign, &quot;Sesame Street&quot; conducted a traveling show, featuring some Muppets, between February and December 2019. The &quot;unofficial slogan&quot; of the show&#x27;s anniversary was &quot;50 Years and Counting&quot;, which Underwood called &quot;a nod that we are still going strong&quot;.

==2020s==

In 2020, CNN had aired a few town hall segments with &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters to help children understand difficult topics during the COVID-19 pandemic and Black Lives Matter riots.

On January 29, 2024, the Elmo X (formerly Twitter) account posted: &quot;Elmo is just checking in! How is everybody doing?&quot; The post currently has at least 219 million views, at least 20K comments, and at least 46K quote responses. The response to the post was overwhelming worry, anxiety, and fear, sparking a larger online and multimedia conversation about mental health.Some of the most-viewed responses include the likes of, &quot;Elmo, life is just hard,&quot; and &quot;elmo im gonna be real with you, I dont think I can keep living like this, I feel like oscar the grouch in a world of elmo&#x27;s.&quot; The next day, the Elmo account posted: &quot;Wow! Elmo is glad he asked! Elmo learned that it is important to ask a friend how they are doing. Elmo will check in again soon, friends! Elmo loves you.&quot; After that, the Sesame Street social media accounts at large posted similar messages of support, and Sesame Workshop made sure to publicize mental health resources.

On October 30, 2023, &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; reported that &quot;Sesame Street&quot; would drop its longtime &#x27;magazine&#x27; format for season 56 in favor of a more narrative format, with two 11-minute story segments, paired with a new animated series, &quot;Tales from 123&quot;. 

On December 13, 2024, it was announced that HBO would be removing &quot;Sesame Street&quot; from its lineup to &quot;find a new home&quot;. Unfortunately, it is unknown if another company would take over the rights to it.

<text>The 6ths was a band created by Stephin Merritt, also the primary songwriter and instrumentalist behind The Magnetic Fields, The Gothic Archies, and Future Bible Heroes. One story has it that the band was conceived when Merritt, observing that there was no tribute album dedicated to him, decided to make one himself. In the group, Merritt writes and plays songs which are then sung by other artists—a different artist on each track. It has so far produced two well-received albums and many different collaborations.

==Releases==
The two albums the band released were &quot;Wasps&#x27; Nests&quot; in 1995 (Factory Too via London Records) and &quot;Hyacinths and Thistles&quot; in 2000. &quot;Wasps&#x27; Nests&quot; was preceded by a 7&quot; vinyl single of album track &quot;Heaven in a Black Leather Jacket&quot; in 1993 on Merge Records that contains a B-side, &quot;Rot in the Sun&quot;, sung by Merritt himself. The song was also later included on Merritt&#x27;s &quot;Obscurities&quot; compilation in 2011.

The names of both albums, as well as the name of the band, are deliberate tongue-twisters. The words are chosen for their abundance of &quot;s&quot; and &quot;th&quot; sounds; &quot;sixths&quot; alone packs one &quot;th&quot; and three &quot;s&quot; sounds into one syllable. The band&#x27;s website refers to the 6ths as &quot;every lisper&#x27;s nightmare&quot;.

The list of singers on &quot;Wasps&#x27; Nests&quot; includes many notable mid-90s indie-rockers, including Barbara Manning, Mary Timony, Dean Wareham (Galaxie 500, Luna, Dean &amp; Britta), Lou Barlow, Chris Knox (Tall Dwarfs), Robert Scott (The Bats, The Clean), Georgia Hubley (Yo La Tengo), and Mark Robinson.

Some of the more notable artists appearing on &quot;Hyacinths and Thistles&quot; are Bob Mould, Sally Timms (The Mekons), Sarah Cracknell (Saint Etienne), Neil Hannon (The Divine Comedy), Gary Numan, Marc Almond, Momus, Clare Grogan (Altered Images), Melanie, Miss Lily Banquette (Combustible Edison), Katharine Whalen (Squirrel Nut Zippers) and the accomplished toy piano player Margaret Leng Tan. The album also features an improbable duet of singer Odetta accompanied by &quot;Lemony Snicket&quot; author Daniel Handler on accordion.

&quot;Falling out of Love (with You)&quot; from &quot;Wasps&#x27; Nests&quot; was featured on the popular 90&#x27;s children&#x27;s show &quot;The Adventures of Pete and Pete&quot;.

Two songs from &quot;Hyacinths and Thistles&quot;, &quot;You, You, You, You, You&quot; and &quot;As You Turn To Go&quot;, are featured in the movie &quot;Pieces of April&quot; and its accompanying soundtrack by Stephin Merritt. &quot;You, You, You, You, You&quot; was featured in Google&#x27;s 2016 pixel ad.

Their song &quot;Night Falls Like a Grand Piano&quot; was covered by South African group Wonderboom on their 2003 album &quot;Tell Someone Who Cares&quot;.

<text>Her Majesty&#x27;s Inspectorate of Education (HMIe) was an executive agency of the Scottish Government, responsible for the inspection of public and private, primary and secondary schools, as well as further education colleges, community learning, Local Authority Education Departments and teacher education.

HMIe and Learning and Teaching Scotland were merged in 2011 to create Education Scotland.

==History==
The first HM Inspector of Schools (HMI) was appointed in 1840. The rationale for the first appointments of HMI linked inspection to &quot;the improvement of elementary education&quot; and charged HMI to say &quot;what improvements in the apparatus and internal management of schools, in school management and discipline, and in the methods of teaching have been sanctioned by the most extensive experience&quot;. The particular focus in Scotland on combining inspection with self-evaluation has been central to the drive to raise educational standards.

HMIe was headed by Her Majesty&#x27;s Senior Chief Inspector of Education. Its remit was far wider than its English counterpart, the Office for Standards in Education. HMIe&#x27;s equivalent in Wales, Estyn, had a similar remit, including adult education.

Following the Scotland Act 1998 the Inspectorate was made an Executive Agency of the Scottish Government in 2001, and HMIe was answerable to the Scottish Ministers for the running of the Inspectorate and the whole inspection system in Scotland.

In 2003 it employed 178 staff who were based in Edinburgh, Inverness, Glasgow and Dundee. A policy to disperse public sector jobs then led to the relocation of the headquarters from Edinburgh to Livingston, West Lothian along with the opening of new offices in Dunbartonshire and Ayrshire.

On 14 October 2010 the Cabinet Secretary for Education announced that HMIe would be brigaded with Learning and Teaching Scotland into a new executive agency of the Scottish Government to be known as the &quot;Scottish Education Quality and Improvement Agency&quot;. This was later renamed Education Scotland, and came into existence on 30 June 2011.

Senior Chief Inspector 1999 to 2002: Douglas Osler
Senior Chief Inspector 2002 to 2009: Graham Donaldson
Senior Chief Inspector 2010 to 2017: Dr Bill Maxwell
Senior Chief Inspector from December 2017: Gayle Gorman

==Remit==
HMIe was charged with inspecting the quality of education in pre-school centres, primary schools, secondary schools, special schools, community learning and development, further education colleges, initial teacher education, residential educational provision and the education functions of local authorities and services for children.

Following the passing of the Standards in Scotland’s Schools etc. 2000 Act the focus of HMIe shifted to how this legislation is being implemented. It brought new statutory powers to inspect the education functions of local authorities.

<text>In the Gleneagles Agreement, in 1977, Commonwealth presidents and prime ministers agreed, as part of their support for the international campaign against apartheid, to discourage contact and competition between their sportsmen and sporting organisations, teams, or individuals from South Africa. The agreement was unanimously approved by the Commonwealth of Nations at a meeting at Gleneagles, Perthshire, Scotland.

The Gleneagles Agreement reinforced their commitment, embodied in the Singapore Declaration of Commonwealth Principles (1971), to oppose racism. This commitment was further strengthened by the Declaration on Racism and Racial Prejudice, adopted by Commonwealth leaders in Lusaka in 1979. The Commonwealth was a relevant body to impose a sporting ban on South Africa because several of the sports most popular among white South Africans are dominated by Commonwealth member states, for example cricket and rugby union.

<text>Brigadier Leslie Wilton Andrew, (23 March 1897 – 8 January 1969) was a senior officer in the New Zealand Military Forces and a recipient of the Victoria Cross, the highest award of the British Commonwealth for gallantry &quot;in the face of the enemy&quot;. He received the decoration for his actions during the Battle of Passchendaele in 1917.

Andrew joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force as a private in 1915, having gained military experience while serving with the Territorial Force. He saw action on the Western Front from September 1916 to early 1918, and ended the war as an officer in England. He remained in the military after the cessation of hostilities, and joined the New Zealand Staff Corps. He held staff and administrative positions in New Zealand and, while on an officer exchange program, British India.

Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Andrew was appointed commander of the 22nd Battalion, which he led during the Battles of Greece and Crete as well as the early part of the North African Campaign. For a short period in late 1941 he commanded an infantry brigade of the 2nd New Zealand Division, and was awarded the Distinguished Service Order for his leadership. He returned to New Zealand in 1942 and commanded the Wellington Fortress Area for the remainder of the war. He retired from the military in 1952 with the rank of brigadier, and died in 1969 aged 71.

==Early life==
Leslie Wilton Andrew was born on 23 March 1897 in Ashhurst in the Manawatu region of New Zealand, the son of William Andrew, headmaster of a local school, and his wife, Frances Hannah. He grew up in Wanganui, where his father had moved his family having taken up a position in the area, and was educated at Wanganui Collegiate School. After leaving school in 1913 he worked for a solicitor and was later employed by the New Zealand Railways Department as a clerk.

Andrew participated in the cadet program while at school and later joined the Territorial Force. By 1915, he had been promoted to sergeant and had sat the necessary exams to become a commissioned officer in the Territorials.

==First World War==
Andrew volunteered for the New Zealand Expeditionary Force (NZEF) in October 1915, when he was 18. As only men between the ages of 20 and 40 could volunteer for service with the NZEF, he falsified his age to ensure that he would be eligible for duty overseas. A member of the 12th Reinforcements, he embarked for the Western Front via Egypt on 1 May 1916. In France, he was posted to B Company, 2nd Battalion, Wellington Infantry Regiment, with the rank of private.

Andrew&#x27;s arrival at the front coincided with the start of the Somme Offensive. He participated in the Battle of Flers-Courcelette, which began on 15 September, and was wounded. Promoted to corporal in January 1917, he took part in the Battle of Messines the following June.

During the early phase of the Battle of Passchendaele, Andrew&#x27;s battalion was engaged in fighting around the village of La Basseville, a few kilometres southwest of Messines. Originally captured by the New Zealanders prior to the battle on 26 July, the village had been re-taken by the Germans the next day. Under cover of an artillery barrage, the Wellingtons began an advance towards the village. Andrew was tasked with leading two sections to destroy a machine-gun post. During the advance, he noticed a nearby machine-gun post that was holding up the advance of another platoon. On his own initiative, he promptly diverted his force and removed the newly spotted threat with a flanking attack. He then led his men to the original objective. Despite continuous gunfire, he and his men captured the machine-gun post. While most of his men withdrew with the gun, Andrew and another man continued to scout further forward. Coming across another machine-gun post, the two men destroyed it before returning to their lines with information on the increasing numbers of Germans in the area. During his foray, Andrew received a flesh wound to his back.

Andrew was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC) for his leadership and bravery at La Basseville. The VC, instituted in 1856, was the highest gallantry award that could be bestowed on a serviceman of the British Empire. The citation read as follows:

Aged 20, the youngest recipient in the NZEF to receive the VC, Andrew was promoted to sergeant the day after the action at La Basseville. He was presented with his VC by King George V in a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on 31 October 1917. Andrew continued to serve on the Western Front until he was sent to England for officer training. He was commissioned as a second lieutenant in March 1918, and was posted to Sling Camp, the main training facility for the NZEF, as an instructor. He was still in England when the war ended.

==Interwar period==

While in England, Andrew met Bessie Ball, of Nottingham, and they were married on 12 November 1918, the day after the Armistice with Germany. The couple had five children; one died in infancy. Discharged from the NZEF on his return to New Zealand in August 1919, Andrew opted to become a professional soldier and joined the New Zealand Staff Corps despite a poor assessment of his administrative skills by a senior officer. He served in staff positions for the next several years. From 1927 to 1929 he served with the Highland Light Infantry of the British Army, then based in British India, on an officer exchange program. On his return to New Zealand he was appointed adjutant of the 1st Wellington Regiment.

In 1937, having been promoted to captain, Andrew led the New Zealand contingent sent to London for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. While there, he returned to Buckingham Palace, where he had been presented with the VC, this time as commander of the New Zealand guard at the palace on 11 May 1937. Returning to staff duties in New Zealand, he was assistant adjutant and quartermaster general of the Central Military District.

==Second World War==
Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Andrew, a major at the time, was seconded to the 2nd New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF). In early 1940, having been promoted to lieutenant colonel, he was appointed commander of 22nd Battalion, which was then forming at Trentham Military Camp near Wellington. He trained his new command hard, and quickly earned the nickname of &quot;February&quot; due to his habit of issuing 28-day detentions for any breaches in discipline.

In May 1940, the battalion sailed aboard the &quot;Empress of Britain&quot; as part of a convoy transporting the battalion&#x27;s parent formation, the 5th Infantry Brigade, itself part of the 2nd New Zealand Division under Major General Bernard Freyberg, to the Middle East. The German invasion of Holland and Belgium prompted the diversion of the convoy to England. Arriving in June, the battalion, along with the rest of the brigade, formed a mobile reserve for XII Corps, which was tasked with defending the coast of Kent from a possible German invasion. In March 1941 it travelled for Egypt and then to Greece. Andrew led the battalion through the subsequent Battle of Greece, during which it saw little action apart from air raids and two minor engagements with the 2nd Panzer Division on 15 and 16 April at Mount Olympus.

===Battle of Crete===

Evacuated to Crete on 25 April 1941, the 5th Brigade was tasked with the defence of the Maleme airfield. At this stage, 22nd Battalion was regarded as the best of the battalions of the brigade so Andrew was ordered to hold the strategically important Point 107, the dominant hill overlooking the airfield. Forced to disperse the companies of his battalion widely to cover his positions, he closely oversaw the defensive arrangements and ensured sufficient ammunition for his men.

On 20 May 1941, the opening day of the Battle of Crete, 22nd Battalion was heavily bombed and strafed, and Andrew was lightly wounded. In the battalion&#x27;s war diary he noted the bombing was worse than the artillery barrages of Passchendaele and the Somme. German paratroopers began landing in the area, including near his headquarters, and fighting took place at close quarters. Andrew soon lost communications with his forward companies but these were able to drive off the German attackers and hold their positions. The lack of contact with the companies to his front was a concern to Andrew as was the increasing presence of Germans to his rear. He requested support from the adjacent 23rd Battalion but this was refused by his brigade commander, Brigadier James Hargest. Andrew used his battalion reserve to mount a counterattack with the help of two Matilda tanks but this failed. Following this, he advised Hargest that he might have to withdraw from Point 107; &quot;If you must you must&quot; was the reply. Accordingly, Andrew withdrew the remaining units that he was able to contact. As it happened, most of his forward companies remained intact and, after finding they had been abandoned, were able to withdraw from Point 107.

The withdrawal to the positions of the 21st and 23rd Battalions came as a major surprise to Hargest, but instead of ordering an immediate counterattack, he directed Andrew take overall command of the defences of 5th Brigade and conceded the airfield was lost. Once senior commanders became aware of the situation, they ordered that it be rectified. Despite a counterattack to recapture the airfield mounted in the evening of 21 May and into the next morning, Maleme airfield remained in the hands of the Germans. This was a significant factor in the German forces becoming established on Crete as it enabled much needed reinforcements to be landed by aircraft. Andrew and the surviving elements of his battalion were withdrawn from the area to Sphakia and, after acting as a defensive cordon, evacuated from Crete.

===North Africa===
In Egypt, where the 2nd New Zealand Division was being rebuilt after the losses of Greece and Crete, Andrew and Hargest gave evidence in an inquiry on the conduct of the fighting on Crete. Officially, 5th Brigade was held blameless. Andrew remained as commander of 22nd Battalion during the early phases of the North African campaign. At one point during the efforts to lift the siege of Tobruk, his battalion was surrounded at Menastir and fought off elements of the 21st Panzer Division. His leadership during this time was later recognised with a Mention in Despatches.

When Hargest, still commanding 5th Brigade, was captured on 27 November 1941, Andrew was given temporary command of the brigade the next day. He led the brigade up until 8 December 1941, including a period, from 1 to 3 December, when it was besieging Bardia and fighting off German attempts to relieve the town. He reverted to command of the battalion on 9 December 1941 but was later rewarded with the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his leadership of the brigade. He relinquished command of 22nd Battalion in February 1942 and returned to New Zealand in response to a need for experienced officers to oversee development of home defences after the entry of Japan into the war.

==Later life==
Back in New Zealand, Andrew was promoted to full colonel and appointed commander of the Wellington Fortress Area. He was formally discharged from the 2NZEF in October 1943, reverting to the regular army thereafter. He continued leading the Wellington Fortress Area for the rest of the war. In the immediate postwar period, he commanded the New Zealand contingent for the 1946 Victory Parade in London, and the following year attended the Imperial Defence College. He was promoted to brigadier in 1948 and appointed commander of the Central Military District. He continued in this appointment until his retirement from the military in 1952. He was later invited to run for Parliament but declined. In 1953, Andrew was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Coronation Medal.

Andrew died on 8 January 1969 at Palmerston North hospital after a brief illness. Survived by his wife and four children, he was buried with full military honours in a ceremony at Levin RSA Cemetery, in Levin. His funeral was attended by three fellow VC recipients, including Reverend Keith Elliott, a former soldier of the 22nd Battalion, who also provided a reading. A barracks at Linton Army Camp is named after him; in Belgium, in the village of Warneton, just south of La Basseville, there is a commemorative plaque in his memory. On 31 July 2017, the 100-year anniversary of the action at La Basseville that earned him the VC, a plaque in Andrew&#x27;s memory was unveiled at the Wellington railway station.

==Legacy==
In 1953, the book &quot;Crete&quot;, one of the volumes of the Official History of New Zealand in the Second World War, written by Dan Davin and edited by Howard Kippenberger, the latter a friend and fellow battalion commander in the 2NZEF who was present at Crete, was published. In it, Andrew was criticised for his handling of the action at Maleme that ultimately led to the loss of Crete. In private correspondence to Davin, Kippenberger expressed the view that Andrew should have fought his battalion to the last man. Andrew took offence at the public criticism and his relations with Kippenberger would be distant and cool thereafter. As a result, Andrew was also reluctant to contribute to the official history of the 22nd Battalion, implying to its author that Kippenberger would distort events as he believed he had with the Crete book.

Andrew did have his supporters, including former soldiers of the 22nd Battalion, and Bernard Freyberg, the overall commander on Crete, did not blame Andrew for the loss of the island. The lethargic and indecisive conduct of his brigade commander, James Hargest, in the early stages of the fighting on the island was also a significant factor in Maleme airfield falling to the Germans.

==VC==
Andrew&#x27;s Victoria Cross was displayed at the National Army Museum in Waiouru. In December 2007 it was one of nine VCs among 96 medals stolen from the museum. On 16 February 2008, New Zealand Police announced that all the medals had been recovered as a result of a NZ$300,000 reward offered by Michael Ashcroft and Tom Sturgess.

<doc id="262991" wikidata="Q892562" url="?curid=262991" title="Fourth-rate">
<text>In 1603 all English warships with a complement of fewer than 160 men were known as &#x27;small ships&#x27;. In 1625/26 to establish pay rates for officers, a six-tier naval ship rating system was introduced. These small ships were divided into three tiers: fourth-, fifth- and sixth-rates. Up to the end of the 17th century, the number of guns and the complement size were adjusted until the rating system was actually clarified. A &#x27;fourth-rate&#x27; was nominally a ship of over thirty guns with a complement of 140 men.

In the rating system of the Royal Navy used to categorize sailing warships in the 18th century, a fourth-rate was a ship of the line with 46 to 60 guns mounted. They were phased out of ship of the line service during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars, as their usefulness was declining; though they were still in service, especially on distant stations such as the East Indies. &quot;Fourth-rates&quot; took many forms, initially as small two-decked warships, later as large frigates razéed from the initial two-deck warships, and occasionally even heavily armed merchant ships such as HMS &quot;Calcutta&quot;.

==Small two decked warships==
A fourth-rate was, in the British Royal Navy during the first half of the 18th century, a ship of the line mounting from 46 up to 60 guns. While the number of guns stayed in the same range until 1817, after 1756 the ships of 50 guns and below were considered too weak to stand in the line of battle, although the remaining 60-gun ships were still classed as fit to be ships of the line. However, the 50-gun ship continued to be used largely during the Seven Years&#x27; War, and during the time of the American Revolution a whole new group of 50-gun ships was constructed, not for the battle fleet, but to meet the needs of combat in the shallow waters off North America where the larger ships found it difficult to sail. 50-gun ships were also suitable as convoy escorts and for service on foreign stations, where larger enemy vessels were unlikely to be encountered. Some saw service as flagships since, as two-deckers, they were able to accommodate a flag officer and his retinue, and they also had the physical presence of a flagship. Their usefulness was declining, however, and during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars few 50s were built, although several remained in service, especially on distant stations such as the East Indies. The 60-gun ships were also dying out, superseded initially by the 74-gun third-rates, although by 1793 there were still four 60-gun ships left in harbour service.

Some fourth-rates did remain in active service even during the Napoleonic Wars, especially in the shallow North Sea, where the Royal Navy&#x27;s main opponents were the Baltic powers and the Dutch, whose own fleet consisted mainly of 50- to 64-gun ships (e.g. the 56-gun &quot;Delft&quot;). However, HMS &quot;Leander&quot;, 50 guns, was with Horatio Nelson at the Battle of the Nile. As late as 1807, fourth-rates were active in combat zones, illustrated by the fatal incident between HMS &quot;Leopard&quot; (50 guns), and the US frigate &quot;Chesapeake&quot; (38 guns), an incident which nearly led to war.

==Large frigates and spar-decked frigates==
American 44-gun frigates &quot;Constitution&quot;, &quot;United States&quot; and &quot;President&quot; were never in operational use armed with fewer than 50 guns including carronades, and were generally seen as equivalent to fourth-rates. The larger British 24-pounder frigates such as the later 1813 &quot;Leander&quot; and &quot;Newcastle&quot;, were of similar firepower to those big American 44s. The latter were launched (or razéed – i.e. converted by cutting down by one deck from existing smaller third-rate 74-gun two-deckers) during the last years of the Napoleonic War and the War of 1812 and were classed as fourth-rates in Royal Naval service under the revised rating system. This convention continued into the 19th century. Any of these later large fourth-rate frigates threw a close-range broadside (including from their heavy carronades) far superior to the earlier two-decker 50s or even to third-rate 64s.

==Merchant conversions==
Some ships of commerce such as the East Indiamen were heavily armed to protect themselves from pirates and privateers, effectively making them equivalent to fourth-rate ships of the line. The Royal Navy also converted some East Indiamen into fourth-rates for convoy duty, such as HMS &quot;Calcutta&quot;.

<text>Joseph Malet Lambert (1853–1931) was vicar of St. John&#x27;s parish, Hull, UK, later elevated to Dean of Hull, Canon of York, and Archdeacon of the East Riding within the Church of England.

He was active in social reform and the municipal affairs of Hull, including housing, sanitation and education, yet allowed a child in his care to be beaten and neglected to such a point that the child was taken into care.

==Biography==
Malet Lambert was born in Hull in 1853, the son of Joseph Lambert and his second wife, Jane Hudson Malet, of Cork. His mother died when he was young. When he was 11 years old, his father remarried to Rachel Wilson, the daughter of Thomas Wilson, a Hull shipping-line owner. He attended Pocklington Grammar School and later entered his father&#x27;s ship-broking business in the High Street.

Eventually he entered Trinity College, Dublin, graduating with a first rank honors BA in Natural Science 1879. In that same year he was ordained, becoming curate at Tadcaster.

In 1881 he became vicar of Newland, Hull, a position he held for the next three decades. Soon after he was instrumental in creating the parish of St. Augustine&#x27;s, serving the recently built area of The Avenues, and other new urban developments; the district was taken out of his own parish. During his encumbancy the church was expanded with the addition of a chancel (1893), and a north aisle (1902), as well as having the vaults filled in, the nave extended, and other alterations.

In February 1882 he married Miss Rose Harrison, eldest daughter of Arthur Harrison of Northgate House, Cottingham. He received an M.A. in 1883, Bachelor of Laws in 1884 and Doctor of Laws in 1885.

In the 1880s Malet Lambert was involved in the &#x27;Hull Sanitary Association&#x27;, a body set up to improve sewage, refuse, and disease treatment in Hull, and was instrumental in instigated an investigation into the housing conditions of the poor. He also became involved in, a member of the Hull School Board, later becoming its chairman.

In 1894 Malet Lambert became Rural dean of Hull. In 1900 he became Canon of York and in 1917, Archdeacon of the East Riding.

In the early years the beginning of the 20th century, Lambert and his wife were charged with cruelty and neglect of a ten-year-old female child in their care. The child, who had been taken in to be trained as a servant, was presented to a visiting doctor by concerned servants of the house - the child was ascertained to be malnourished by a doctor, weighing aged 11. In addition to the malnutrition of the child she was said to have been keep secret from visitors by Mrs. Lambert, beaten with a stick and poker by Mrs. Lambert, who had instructed her cook to do the same. The contradictions of the Lambert&#x27;s treatment of their charge, and Malet Lambert&#x27;s so-called philanthropic work were noted at the trial, as was the differences in well being of the child and the Lambert&#x27;s own offspring. The child was taken into the care of a workhouse, where she made a rapid recovery.

In 1927 Lambert became the first chairman of the council of the newly established University College (Hull) (see Hull University). Lambert died 17 April 1931.

<text>Pocklington () is a market town and civil parish at the foot of the Yorkshire Wolds in the East Riding of Yorkshire, England. At the 2021 United Kingdom census, its population was 10,123. It lies east of York, and north-west of Hull.

The town&#x27;s skyline is marked by the 15th-century tower of All Saints&#x27; parish church. The ecclesiastical parish includes the hamlet of Kilnwick Percy.

==History==

Pocklington gets its name via the Old English &quot;Poclintun&quot; from the Anglian settlement of Pocel&#x27;s (or Pocela&#x27;s) people and the Old English word &quot;tun&quot; meaning farm or settlement, but though the town&#x27;s name can only be traced back to around 650 AD, the inhabitation of Pocklington as a site is thought to extend back a further 1,000 years or more to the Bronze Age. Pocklington appears on the 14th-century Gough Map, the oldest route map in Great Britain.

In the Iron Age Pocklington was a major town of the Parisi tribe. In 2017, a Celtic warrior&#x27;s grave, dated to about BC 320 to 174, was discovered at a housing development under construction. After archeologists had completed a very long excavation project, the site was found to include a bronze shield, remains of a chariot and the skeletons of ponies. The shield&#x27;s boss bears a resemblance to the Wandsworth shield boss (circa BC 350 to 150), in the British Museum. One design element on the extremely well preserved Pocklington shield, a scalloped border, &quot;is not comparable to any other Iron Age finds across Europe, adding to its valuable uniqueness&quot;, commented Paula Ware, managing director at MAP Archaeological Practice Ltd, in late 2019. Horses were rarely included in Iron Age burials, making the find particularly significant. &quot;The discoveries are set to widen our understanding of the Arras (Middle Iron Age) culture and the dating of artefacts to secure contexts is exceptional,&quot; according to Paula Ware.

By the time of the Domesday Book in 1086, it was the second largest settlement in Yorkshire after York itself.

Pocklington developed through the Middle Ages while many similar places fell into dramatic decline. Pocklington owed much of its prosperity in the Middle Ages to the fact that it was a local centre for the trading of wool and lay on the main road to York, an important national centre for the export of wool to the continent. Wool was England&#x27;s main export in the earlier Middle Ages.

===Town heraldry===
The town&#x27;s coat of arms shield is based on that of the Dolman family, founders of Pocklington School. The arms were granted to the town council in 1980. The crown at the base of the shield is the emblem of the saints, and along with the gold cross, symbolises the town&#x27;s historic connection with Paulinus of York and the Archbishop of York.

The town&#x27;s motto is &quot;Service with Freedom&quot;.

==Governance==

Pocklington is under East Riding of Yorkshire Council, a unitary authority. The town is part of the &quot;Pocklington Provincial Ward&quot; and returns three councillors to the council.

From 2001 to 2024 Pocklington was part of the East Yorkshire Parliamentary Constituency. It became part of the Goole and Pocklington constituency from 2024 onwards.

Pocklington&#x27;s Town Council consists of thirteen elected councillors and is responsible for the cemetery, allotments, the Croft play-park and the Arts Centre. The Mayor of Pocklington is elected annually by the members of the town council.

The town council has a policy of naming all new streets using the surnames of the war dead who served at RAF Pocklington. This has given rise to the names Strother Close, Waite Close, Garrick Drive, Turnbull Close and Harper Close. There is some controversy surrounding the policy as a local resident believes that war heroes from Pocklington and nearby Barmby Moor should also be honoured in this way.

===Town twinning===
Pocklington is twinned with:

* Le Pays de Racan, France (Official)
* Trendelburg, Germany (unofficial)

==Geography==

Pocklington is a spring line settlement at the foot of the Yorkshire Wolds. The rocks underlying this area were deposited on the bed of a tropical ocean. When the land rose, the chalk wolds were formed from the exoskeletons of micro-organisms covering the sea floor. The landscape around Pocklington therefore varies from flat arable land primarily devoted to agriculture to the south and west, and grassy, chalk hills and dry valleys to the north and east. A lot of the more level farming country was, from the Middle Ages onwards, reclaimed from marshland.
Pocklington is bisected by the largely culverted Pocklington Beck, a small brook that feeds into the Pocklington Canal. The beck and canal are usually good fishing grounds but a sewerage overflow in 2003 killed thousands of fish and severely damaged the ecosystem, from which it is now recovered.

==Demography==
According to the 2011 UK census, Pocklington parish had a population of 8,337, an increase on the 2001 UK census figure of 7,632.

The civil parish is not very ethnically diverse, with the 2001 UK census reporting 98.4% of the 7,632 inhabitants being white.

The East Riding of Yorkshire has a higher than average level of Christian belief and a much lower rate of observance for other faiths and those of no faith. This can be attributed to the aforementioned lack of ethnic diversity in the area.

==Entertainment and culture==
Pocklington Arts Centre (formerly the Oak House Cinema) opened in 2000 and offers &quot;a mixed programme of film, music, drama, dance, lectures, workshops and exhibitions&quot;. Previous performers at the arts centre include the comedians Jenny Eclair, Clive James, Dave Gorman and Barry Cryer and the musicians Midge Ure and Steve Harley (in 2-man (2002), 3-man (2010, 2012, 2014 (twice), 2018–2019) and 4-man (2003) electro-acoustic sets only, no full rock band (i.e. Cockney Rebel shows). The centre also puts on &quot;second screenings&quot; of recently released films. The TV presenter Victoria Coren Mitchell used the name of the Pocklington Arts Centre for her Ormerod hoax.

In a tribute to Munich&#x27;s traditional Oktoberfest, Pocklington hosts its own annual &quot;Pocktoberfest&quot;. Unlike the original on which it is based, Pocktoberfest is pared down to a single-issue event: beer. In the 2006 event, 19 casks (or about 452 litres) of ale were consumed. Organiser of the 2012 Pocktoberfest, Clare Saunders, arranged for brewers from Germany. Italy, France, Belgium and the Netherlands to attend the festival, which is sponsored by C &amp; N Wines and Swirlz Ice Cream Emporium.

Pocklington celebrates an annual Flying Man Festival with a multitude of themed events from 12 to 14 May, in memory of the showman Thomas Pelling, the &quot;Flying Man of Pocklington&quot;, who, with a pair of homemade wings, tried to fly from the top of the local church, and was killed when he hit one of the church&#x27;s buttresses.

===Sport===
Pocklington RUFC rugby team is based on Burnby Lane. The first rugby game in Pocklington was held on West Green on Wednesday 12 November 1879 between Pocklington Town and District and Pocklington Grammar School.

The first Pocklington rugby club Pocklington F.C. was formed in 1885. The current club, formed in 1928, plays in Counties 1 Yorkshire and also hosts the traditional &quot;Good Friday Sevens&quot; tournament, which is Yorkshire&#x27;s longest-established sevens tournament launched in 1958 and Pocklington&#x27;s premier sporting event, which sees local, county-based and even international teams compete.

The town has a council-run Francis Scaife Sports Centre, which includes a 20-metre swimming pool and gym. The town has swimming, football and cricket clubs.

Kilnwick Percy Golf Club – locally known as the KP – lies just outside of Pocklington and offers luxury hotel rooms and lodges in addition to its championship golf course.

Pocklington&#x27;s football club, Pocklington Town A.F.C., competes in the Humber Premier League. The club operates three other Saturday football teams alongside an U19s team and girls&#x27; team. In the 2012–13 season the club&#x27;s 1st team won the highest level trophy in the club&#x27;s history by winning the Whitehead&#x27;s Fish &amp; Chips Humber League Cup at North Ferriby United&#x27;s Rapid Solicitors Stadium, a da decade later, the club were champions of the Humber Premier League. The club had floodlights installed during July 2008, allowing the club to make progress in the football league pyramid.

In 2007, Michael Woods, a Pocklingtonian, made his debut for Chelsea.

Pocklington Tennis Club, which has 6 astro-turf style courts and plays in both the York &amp; District Tennis League and the Driffield &amp; District Lawn Tennis League, is located on West Green.

Pocklington is a control point at the quadrennial London-Edinburgh-London long-distance bicycle event.

===Media===
Pocklington has a local weekly newspaper, the &quot;Pocklington Post&quot;, owned by Johnston Press. Television signals are received from either the Emley Moor or Belmont TV transmitter. The town is covered by both BBC Radio York and BBC Radio Humberside. A full-time community radio station, Vixen FM, based in nearby Market Weighton, broadcasts to the town. Also in the area is Beverley FM which serves Beverley and all of its surrounding areas, including Pocklington. A Pocklington-based community radio station, West Wolds Radio, went on air in November 2015 but closed in September 2016.

==Education==

*Pocklington School
*Woldgate School and Sixth Form College

==Religion==
Churches in Pocklington include:

*The Church of England parish church of All Saints, nicknamed the &quot;Cathedral of the Wolds&quot;. The Grade I listed building is 12th- and 13th-century and has a 15th-century west tower.
*Pocklington Christian Fellowship, formerly Pocklington Pentecostal Church, meets in the former Ebenezer Independent Chapel built for Dissenters in 1807.
*Pocklington Methodist Church, whose red brick Neoclassical building was completed in 1864 as a Wesleyan Methodist Church.

*The Roman Catholic church of SS Mary and Joseph, whose Gothic Revival brick building was completed in 1863 to replace a chapel dating from 1807.

There are no non-Christian houses of worship in Pocklington, but Kilnwick Percy Hall, just outside Pocklington, is now a large residential Buddhist Centre called Madhyamaka Kadampa Meditation Centre. It runs regular Buddhist meditation classes.

==Freemasonry==

Pocklington has its own Masonic Hall which is situated on the Mile. It is home to several lodges and orders including:

*Beacon Lodge No. 4362
*Old Pocklingtonian Lodge No. 7867 – formed by former pupils of Pocklington School but membership is no longer restricted to those with a connection to the school.
*Beacon Chapter No. 4362

==Transport==

===Car===

Pocklington lies near the A1079 road, the main arterial route between the cities of York and Hull.

===Bus===

Pocklington is served by a number of bus routes provided by East Yorkshire Motor Services who have a depot in the town centre. Their X46 and X47 routes branded &quot;EastRider&quot; operate hourly through the town between York and Hull. York Pullman also serve the town with their route X36 service 6 days a week.

===Air===

Pocklington Airfield has three concrete and tarmac runways of , sufficient in length to take RAF bombers during the Second World War, but in September 1946 the airfield was closed. Although the site remains in use with gliders – and occasionally hot air balloonists – a lot of the concrete runway surface has gone, and the control tower is not in operation. It is therefore classified as &quot;limited flying&quot;. The airfield is now wholly owned by the Wolds Gliding Club.

The nearest commercial airport is Humberside Airport, another former RAF airfield.

===Rail===
Pocklington was once part of the rail network, with a railway station dating back to 1847. This was closed as a result of the Beeching Report in November 1965. There is a small but vocal pressure group that is trying to get the railway station and line re-opened. The City of York Local Transport Plan for 2006 noted that: &quot;work has recently been undertaken by East Riding of Yorkshire Council to examine the feasibility of reopening the former direct York – Pocklington – Beverley line that closed in 1965... given the unavailability of funding for such a scheme at present and the extensive time required for any reinstatement of a rail line, the scheme remains a longer-term aspiration.&quot;

The Minsters Rail Campaign was campaigning to re-open the railway line between Beverley and York (with stops at Stamford Bridge, Pocklington and Market Weighton). The re-opened railway would skirt the southern edge of the town as the former alignment has since been developed. In 2006, the issue of re-opening the line was raised in Parliament and, although prohibitively expensive, was otherwise considered favourably. However, in 2013, East Riding of Yorkshire Council decided that the line could not be funded.

The old railway building, designed by George Townsend Andrews, was saved from demolition due to its interesting architecture. It now serves both as a bus shelter, and as a sports hall for nearby Pocklington School.

===Boat===

The Pocklington Canal, in commercial use in the 19th century by barges, is now navigable as far as Bielby Basin. Full restoration of the canal is one of the aims of the Pocklington Canal Amenity Society, which was formed in 1969.

<text>The Pulitzer Prizes were first presented on June 4, 1917. The prizes were given for American journalism and literary works published in 1916. Awards were made in four categories; no winner was chosen in five other categories that had been specified in Joseph Pulitzer&#x27;s bequest. The winners were selected by the Trustees of Columbia University, on advice from juries of appointed experts.

==Journalism awards==
A prize of $1,000 was awarded for reporting, and $500 for editorial writing. Because of an insufficient number of candidates, prizes were not issued in the three other journalism categories (public service, newspaper history, and most suggestive paper on development of the Columbia School of Journalism).

* Editorial Writing:
** &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, for &quot;&quot;, an editorial article on the first anniversary of the sinking of (no author was named, but the editorial was written by Frank H. Simonds).
* Reporting:
** Herbert Bayard Swope of the &quot;New York World&quot;, for his series &quot;Inside the German Empire&quot;, published on October 10, October 15 and from November 4 daily to November 22, 1916. The articles were compiled in book form the following year.

==Letters awards==
A prize of $2,000 was awarded for the best book on American history, and $1,000 for the best American biography. Prizes for the best novel and best drama were not awarded, as the jurors did not find a deserving winner.

* Biography or Autobiography:
**Laura E. Richards and Maud Howe Elliott assisted by Florence Howe Hall, &quot;Julia Ward Howe&quot; (Houghton).
* History:
**Jean Jules Jusserand, &quot;With Americans of Past and Present Days&quot; (Scribner)

<doc id="263009" wikidata="Q8265" url="?curid=263009" title="Dream of the Red Chamber">
<text>Dream of the Red Chamber or The Story of the Stone is an 18th-century Chinese novel authored by Cao Xueqin, considered to be one of the Four Great Classical Novels of Chinese literature. It is known for its psychological scope and its observation of the worldview, aesthetics, lifestyles, and social relations of High Qing China.

The intricate strands of its plot depict the rise and decline of a family much like Cao&#x27;s own and, by extension, of the dynasty itself. Cao depicts the power of the father over the family, but the novel is intended to be a memorial to the women he knew in his youth: friends, relatives and servants. At a more profound level, the author explores religious and philosophical questions, and the writing style includes echoes of the plays and novels of the late Ming, as well as poetry from earlier periods.

Cao apparently began composing it in the 1740s and worked on it until his death in 1763 or 1764. Copies of his uncompleted manuscript circulated in Cao&#x27;s social circle, under the title &quot;Story of a Stone&quot;, in slightly varying versions of eighty chapters. It was not published until nearly three decades after Cao&#x27;s death, when Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan () edited the first and second printed editions under the title &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; from 1791 to 1792, adding 40 chapters. It is still debated whether Gao and Cheng composed these chapters themselves and the extent to which they did or did not represent Cao&#x27;s intentions. Their 120-chapter edition became the most widely circulated version. The title has also been translated as &quot;Red Chamber Dream&quot; and &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;. Redology is the field of study devoted to the novel.

==Language==
The novel is composed in written vernacular (&quot;baihua&quot;) rather than Classical Chinese (&quot;wenyan&quot;). Cao Xueqin was well versed in Chinese poetry and in Classical Chinese, having written tracts in the semi-&quot;wenyan&quot; style, while the novel&#x27;s dialogue is written in the Beijing Mandarin dialect, which was to become the basis of modern spoken Chinese. In the early 20th century, lexicographers used the text to establish the vocabulary of the new standardised language and reformers used the novel to promote the written vernacular.

==History==
===Textual history===
&quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; has a complicated textual history that scholars have long debated. It is known with certainty that Cao Xueqin began writing the novel in the 1740s. Cao was a member of a prominent Chinese family that had served the Manchu emperors of the Qing dynasty but whose fortunes had begun to decline. By the time of Cao&#x27;s death in 1763 or 1764, hand-copied manuscripts of the novel&#x27;s first 80 chapters had begun circulating, and he may have written drafts of the remaining chapters.
These hand-copied manuscripts circulated first among his personal friends and a growing circle of aficionados, then eventually on the open market where they sold for large sums of money.

The first printed version of &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, published by Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E in 1791, contains edits and revisions that Cao never authorized. It is possible that Cao destroyed the last chapters or that at least parts of Cao&#x27;s original ending were incorporated into the 120 chapter Cheng-Gao versions, with Gao E&#x27;s &quot;careful emendations&quot; of Cao&#x27;s draft.

====&quot;Rouge&quot; versions====

Up until 1791, the novel circulated in hand-copied manuscripts. Even amongst some 12 independent surviving manuscripts, small differences in some characters, rearrangements and possible rewritings cause the texts to vary a little. The earliest manuscripts end abruptly at the latest at the 80th chapter. The earlier versions contain comments and annotations in red or black ink from unknown commentators. These commentators&#x27; remarks reveal much about the author as a person, and it is now believed that some of them may even be members of Cao Xueqin&#x27;s own family. The most prominent commentator is Zhiyanzhai, who revealed much of the interior structuring of the work and the original manuscript ending, now lost. These manuscripts, the most textually reliable versions, are known as &quot;rouge versions&quot; (&quot;zhī běn&quot; ).

The early 80 chapters brim with prophecies and dramatic foreshadowings that give hints as to how the book would continue. For example, it is obvious that Lin Daiyu will eventually die in the course of the novel; that Baoyu and Baochai will marry; that Baoyu will become a monk. A branch of Redology, known as &quot;tànyì xué&quot; (), is focused on recovering the lost manuscript ending, based on the commentators&#x27; annotations in the Rouge versions, as well as the internal foreshadowings in the earlier 80 chapters.

Several early manuscripts are still extant. At the present, the &quot;Jiaxu manuscript&quot; (dating to 1754) is held in the Shanghai Museum, the &quot;Jimao manuscript&quot; (1759) is held in the National Library of China, and the &quot;Gengchen manuscript&quot; (1760) is held in the library of Peking University. Beijing Normal University and the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences both also held manuscripts of the novel that predate the first printed edition of 1791.

====Cheng–Gao versions====

In 1791, Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan brought out the novel&#x27;s first printed edition. This was also the first &quot;complete&quot; edition of &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot;, which they printed as the &quot;Illustrated Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; ( ). While the original Rouge manuscripts have eighty chapters, the 1791 edition completed the novel in 120 chapters. The first 80 chapters were edited from the Rouge versions, but the last 40 were newly published.

In 1792, Cheng and Gao published a second edition correcting editorial errors of the 1791 version. In the 1791 prefaces, Cheng claimed to have put together an ending based on the author&#x27;s working manuscripts.

The debate over the last 40 chapters and the 1791–92 prefaces continues to this day. Many modern scholars believe these chapters were a later addition. Hu Shih, in his &quot;Studies on A Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; (1921) argued that these chapters were written by Gao E, citing the foreshadowing of the main characters&#x27; fates in Chapter 5, which differs from the ending of the 1791 Cheng-Gao version. However, during the mid-20th century, the discovery of a 120 chapter manuscript that dates well before 1791 further complicated the questions regarding Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan&#x27;s involvement—whether they simply edited Cao Xueqin&#x27;s work or actually wrote the continuation of the novel. Though it is unclear if the last 40 chapters of the discovered manuscript contained the original works of Cao, Irene Eber found the discovery &quot;seems to confirm Cheng and Gao&#x27;s claim that they merely edited a complete manuscript, consisting of 120 chapters, rather than actually writing a portion of the novel&quot;.

The book is usually published and read in Cheng Weiyuan and Gao E&#x27;s 120 chapter version. Some modern editions, such as Zhou Ruchang&#x27;s, do not include the last 40 chapters.

In 2014, three researchers using data analysis of writing styles announced that &quot;Applying our method to the Cheng–Gao version of &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; has led to convincing if not irrefutable evidence that the first 80 chapters and the last 40 chapters of the book were written by two different authors.&quot;

In 2020, Zhang Qingshan, the president of the academic organization Society of the Dream of the Red Chamber, stated that although the authorship of the novel&#x27;s last 40 chapters remains uncertain, it is unlikely Gao E was the one who wrote them.

==Plot summary==

In the novel&#x27;s frame story, a sentient Stone, left over when the goddess Nüwa mended the heaven aeons ago, wants to enjoy the pleasures of the &quot;red dust&quot; (the mundane world). The Stone begs a Taoist priest and a Buddhist monk to take it with them to see the world. The Stone, along with a companion (in Cheng-Gao versions they are merged into the same character), is then given a chance to learn from human existence, and enters the mortal realm. In the Cheng-Gao versions, he is reborn as Jia Baoyu (&quot;Precious Jade&quot;) – thus &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot;.

The novel provides a detailed, episodic record of life in the two branches of the wealthy, aristocratic Jia () clan—the Rongguo House () and the Ningguo House ()—who reside in large, adjacent family compounds in the capital. The capital, however, is not named, and the first chapter insists that the dynasty is indeterminate. The ancestors of the two families were made Chinese nobility and given imperial titles, and as the novel begins the houses are two of the most illustrious families in the city. One of the Jia daughters is made a Royal Consort, and to suitably receive her, the family constructs the Daguanyuan, a lush landscaped garden, the setting for much of subsequent action. The novel describes the Jias&#x27; wealth and influence in great naturalistic detail, and charts the Jias&#x27; fall from the height of their prestige, following some thirty main characters and over four hundred minor ones.

As the carefree adolescent male heir of the family, Baoyu in this life has a special bond with his sickly cousin Lin Daiyu, who shares his love of music and poetry. Baoyu, however, is predestined to marry another cousin, Xue Baochai, whose grace and intelligence exemplify an ideal woman, but with whom he lacks an emotional connection. The romantic rivalry and friendship among the three characters against the backdrop of the family&#x27;s declining fortunes form the central story.

==Characters==
&quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; contains an extraordinarily large number of characters: nearly 40 major characters, and over 400 additional ones. The novel is known for complex portraits of its female characters. According to Lu Xun in the appendix to &quot;A Brief History of Chinese Fiction&quot;, &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; broke every conceivable thought and technique in traditional Chinese fiction; its realistic characterization presents thoroughly human characters who are neither &quot;wholly good nor wholly bad&quot;, but who seem to inhabit part of the real world.

The names of the characters in particular present a challenge to translators, since many of them convey meaning. David Hawkes left the names of the masters, mistresses, and their family members in pinyin (Jia Zheng and Lady Wang, for instance), translated the meanings of the servants&#x27; names, (such as Aroma and Skybright), put the names of the Daoists and Buddhists into Latin (Sapientia), and those of actors and actresses into French.
===Jia Baoyu and the Twelve Beauties of Jinling===
*Jia Baoyu () The main protagonist is about 12 or 13 years old when introduced. The adolescent son of Jia Zheng and his wife, Lady Wang, and born with a piece of luminescent jade in his mouth (the Stone), Baoyu is the heir apparent to the Rongguo House. Frowned on by his strict Confucian father, Baoyu reads &quot;Zhuangzi&quot; and &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot; on the sly rather than the Four Books of classic Chinese education. Baoyu is highly intelligent but dislikes the fawning bureaucrats who frequent his father&#x27;s house. A sensitive and compassionate individual, he has a special relationship with many of the women in the house.
*Lin Daiyu () Jia Baoyu&#x27;s younger first cousin and his true love. She is the daughter of Lin Ruhai (), an official in the lucrative Yangzhou salt commission, and Lady Jia Min (), Baoyu&#x27;s paternal aunt. She is an icon of spirituality and intelligence: beautiful, sentimental, sarcastic, self-assured, an accomplished poet, but subject to fits of jealousy. She suffers from a respiratory ailment. In the frame story, Baoyu, in his previous incarnation as the Deity Shenying, watered the Fairy Crimson Pearl, Daiyu&#x27;s incarnation. The purpose of her mortal reincarnation is to repay Baoyu with tears. The novel proper starts in Chapter 3 with Daiyu&#x27;s arrival at the Rongguo House shortly after the death of her mother.
*Xue Baochai () Jia Baoyu&#x27;s other first cousin. The only daughter of Aunt Xue (), sister to Baoyu&#x27;s mother, Baochai is a foil to Daiyu. Where Daiyu is unconventional and sincere, Baochai is worldly-wise and very tactful: a model Chinese feudal maiden. The novel describes her as beautiful and ambitious. Baochai has a round face, fair skin, large eyes, and, some would say, a more voluptuous figure in contrast to Daiyu&#x27;s slender willowy daintiness. Baochai carries a golden locket with her which contains words given to her in childhood by a Buddhist monk. Baochai&#x27;s golden locket and Baoyu&#x27;s jade contain inscriptions that appear to complement one another perfectly in the material world. Her marriage to Baoyu is seen in the book as predestined, but ultimately fails due to Baoyu&#x27;s love for Daiyu persisting after her death.
*Jia Yuanchun () Baoyu&#x27;s elder sister by about a decade. Originally one of the ladies-in-waiting in the imperial palace, Yuanchun later becomes an Imperial Consort, having impressed the Emperor with her virtue and learning. Her illustrious position as a favorite of the Emperor marks the height of the Jia family&#x27;s powers. Despite her prestigious position, Yuanchun feels imprisoned within the imperial palace, and dies at the age of forty. The name of four sisters together &quot;Yuan-Ying-Tan-Xi&quot; is a homophone with &quot;Supposed to sigh&quot;.
*Jia Tanchun () Baoyu&#x27;s younger half-sister by Concubine Zhao. Extremely outspoken, she is almost as capable as Wang Xifeng. Wang Xifeng herself compliments her privately, but laments that she was &quot;born in the wrong womb&quot;, since concubine children are not respected as much as those by first wives. She is also a very talented poet. Tanchun is nicknamed &quot;Rose&quot; for her beauty and her prickly personality. She later marries into a military family on the South Sea far away from home.
*Shi Xiangyun () Jia Baoyu&#x27;s younger second cousin. Grandmother Jia&#x27;s grandniece. Orphaned in infancy, she grows up under her wealthy paternal uncle and aunt who treats her unkindly. In spite of this Xiangyun is openhearted and cheerful. A comparatively androgynous beauty, Xiangyun looks good in men&#x27;s clothes (once she put on Baoyu&#x27;s clothes and Grandmother Jia thought she was a man), and loves to drink. She is forthright and without tact, but her forgiving nature takes the sting from her casually truthful remarks. She is well educated and as talented a poet as Daiyu or Baochai. Her young husband dies shortly after their marriage. She vows to be a faithful widow for the rest of her life.
*Miaoyu (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Adamantina) A young nun from Buddhist cloisters of the Rong-guo house. Although beautiful and learned, she is aloof, haughty, unsociable, and has an obsession with cleanliness. The novel says she was compelled by her illness to become a nun, and shelters herself under the nunnery to dodge political affairs. Her fate is not known after her abduction by bandits.
*Jia Yingchun () Second female family member of the generation of the Jia household after Yuanchun, Yingchun is the daughter of Jia She, Baoyu&#x27;s uncle and therefore his elder first cousin. A kind-hearted, weak-willed person, Yingchun is said to have a &quot;wooden&quot; personality and seems rather apathetic toward all worldly affairs. Although very pretty and well-read, she does not compare in intelligence and wit to any of her cousins. Yingchun&#x27;s most famous trait, it seems, is her unwillingness to meddle in the affairs of her family. Eventually Yingchun marries an official of the imperial court, her marriage being merely one of her father&#x27;s desperate attempts to raise the declining fortunes of the Jia family. The newly married Yingchun becomes a victim of domestic abuse and constant violence at the hands of her cruel, abusive husband.
*Jia Xichun () Baoyu&#x27;s younger cousin from the Ningguo House, but brought up in the Rongguo House. A gifted painter, she is also a devout Buddhist. She is the young sister of Jia Zhen, head of the Ningguo House. At the end of the novel, after the fall of the house of Jia, she gives up her worldly concerns and becomes a Buddhist nun. She is the second youngest of Jinling&#x27;s Twelve Beauties, described as a pre-teen in most parts of the novel.
*Wang Xifeng (), alias &quot;Sister Feng&quot;. Baoyu&#x27;s elder cousin-in-law, young wife to Jia Lian (who is Baoyu&#x27;s paternal first cousin), niece to Lady Wang. Xifeng is hence related to Baoyu both by blood and marriage. A handsome woman, Xifeng is capable, clever, humorous, and, at times, vicious and cruel. Undeniably the most worldly woman in the novel, Xifeng is in charge of the daily running of the Rongguo household and wields economic as well as political power within the family. Xifeng keeps both Lady Wang and Grandmother Jia entertained with her jokes and chatter. By playing the role of the perfect filial daughter-in-law, she rules the household with an iron fist. Xifeng can be kind-hearted toward the poor and helpless or cruel enough to kill. She makes a fortune by investing in loan sharking rather than maintaining the family estate and brings about the downfall of the family. She dies soon after the family assets are seized by the government.
*Jia Qiaojie () Wang Xifeng&#x27;s and Jia Lian&#x27;s daughter. She is a child through much of the novel. After the fall of the house of Jia, in the version of Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan, she marries the son of a wealthy rural family introduced by Granny Liu and goes on to lead a happy, uneventful life in the countryside.
*Li Wan () Baoyu&#x27;s elder sister-in-law, widow of Baoyu&#x27;s deceased elder brother, Jia Zhu (). Her primary task is to bring up her son Lan and watch over her female cousins. The novel portrays Li Wan, a young widow in her late twenties, as a mild-mannered woman with no wants or desires, the perfect Confucian ideal of a proper mourning widow. She eventually attains high social status due to the success of her son at the Imperial Exams, but the novel sees her as a tragic figure because she wasted her youth upholding the strict standards of behavior.
*Qin Keqing (;a homophone with &quot;look down upon love&quot;) Daughter-in-law to Jia Zhen. Of all the characters in the novel, the circumstances of her life and early death are amongst the most mysterious. Apparently a very beautiful and flirtatious woman, she carried on an affair with her father-in-law and dies before the second quarter of the novel. Her bedroom is bedecked with priceless artifacts belonging to extremely sensual women, both historical and mythological. In her bed, Bao Yu first travels to the Land of Illusion where he has a sexual encounter with Two-In-One, who represents Xue Baochai and Lin Daiyu. Two-in-One&#x27;s name is also Keqing, making Qin Keqing also a significant character in Bao Yu&#x27;s sexual experience. The original twelve songs hint that Qin Keqing hanged herself.



===Other main characters===
*Grandmother Jia (), née Shi. Also called the Matriarch or the Dowager, the daughter of Marquis Shi of Jinling. Grandmother to both Baoyu and Daiyu, she is the highest living authority in the Rongguo house and the oldest and most respected of the entire clan, yet also a doting person. She has two sons, Jia She and Jia Zheng, and a daughter, Min, Daiyu&#x27;s mother. Daiyu is brought to the house of the Jias at the insistence of Grandmother Jia, and she helps Daiyu and Baoyu bond as childhood playmates and, later, kindred spirits. She distributes her savings among her relatives after the seizure of their properties by the government shortly before her death.
*Jia She () The elder son of the Dowager. He is the father of Jia Lian and Jia Yingchun. He is a treacherous and greedy man, and a womanizer. He is jealous of his younger brother whom his mother favors. He is later stripped of his title and banished by the government.
*Jia Zheng () Baoyu&#x27;s father, the younger son of the Dowager. He is a disciplinarian and Confucian scholar. Afraid his one surviving heir will turn bad, he imposes strict rules on his son, and uses occasional corporal punishment. He has a wife, Lady Wang, and one concubine: Zhao. He is a Confucian scholar who tries to live life as an upright and decent person, but out of touch with reality and a hands-off person at home and in court.
*Jia Lian () Xifeng&#x27;s husband and Baoyu&#x27;s paternal elder cousin, a notorious womanizer whose numerous affairs cause much trouble with his jealous wife, including affairs with men that are not known by his wife. His pregnant concubine (Second Sister You) eventually dies by his wife&#x27;s engineering. He and his wife are in charge of most hiring and monetary allocation decisions, and often fight over this power. He is a cad with a flawed character but still has a conscience.
*Xiangling (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Caltrop) – the Xues&#x27; maid, born Zhen Yinglian (, a homophone with &quot;deserving pity&quot;), the kidnapped and lost daughter of Zhen Shiyin (, a homophone with &quot;Hiding the truth&quot;), the country gentleman in Chapter 1. Her name is changed to Qiuling () by Xue Pan&#x27;s spoiled wife, Xia Jingui () who is jealous of her and tries to poison her. Xue Pan makes her the lady of the house after Jingui&#x27;s death. She soon dies while giving birth.
*Ping&#x27;er (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Patience) Xifeng&#x27;s chief maid and personal confidante; also concubine to Xifeng&#x27;s husband, Jia Lian. Originally Xifeng&#x27;s maid in the Wang household, she follows Xifeng as part of her dowry when Xifeng marries into the Jia household. She handles her troubles with grace, assists Xifeng capably and appears to have the respect of most of the household servants. She is also one of the very few people who can get close to Xifeng. She wields considerable power in the house as Xifeng&#x27;s most trusted assistant, but uses her power sparingly and justly. She is supremely loyal to her mistress, but more soft-hearted and sweet-tempered.
*Xue Pan () Baochai&#x27;s older brother, a dissolute, idle rake who was a local bully in Jinling. He was known for his amorous exploits with both men and women. Not particularly well educated, he once killed a man over a servant-girl (Xiangling) and had the manslaughter case hushed up with money.
*Granny Liu () A country rustic and distant relation to the Wang family, who provides a comic contrast to the ladies of the Rongguo House during two visits. She eventually rescues Qiaojie from her maternal uncle, who wanted to sell her.
*Lady Wang () A Buddhist, primary wife of Jia Zheng. Daughter of one of the four most prominent families of Jinling. Because of her purported ill-health, she hands over the running of the household to her niece, Xifeng, as soon as the latter marries into the Jia household, although she retains overall control over Xifeng&#x27;s affairs so that the latter always has to report to her. Although Lady Wang appears to be a kind mistress and a doting mother, she can in fact be cruel and ruthless when her authority is challenged. She pays a great deal of attention to Baoyu&#x27;s maids to make sure that Baoyu does not develop romantic relationships with them.
*Aunt Xue (), née Wang Baoyu&#x27;s maternal aunt, mother to Pan and Baochai, sister to Lady Wang. She is kindly and affable for the most part, but finds it hard to control her unruly son.
*Hua Xiren (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Aroma) Baoyu&#x27;s principal maid and his unofficial concubine. While she still has standing as the Dowager&#x27;s maid, the Dowager gave her to Baoyu so, in practice, Xiren is his maid. Considerate and forever worried about Baoyu, she is the partner of his first adolescent sexual encounter in the real world in Chapter 5. After Baoyu&#x27;s disappearance, she unknowingly marries actor Jiang Yuhan, one of Baoyu&#x27;s friends.

*Qingwen (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Skybright) Baoyu&#x27;s personal maid. Brash, haughty and the most beautiful maid in the household, Qingwen is said to resemble Daiyu very strongly. Of all of Baoyu&#x27;s maids, she is the only one who dares to argue with Baoyu when reprimanded, but is also extremely devoted to him. She is disdainful of Xiren&#x27;s attempt to use her sexual relation with Baoyu to raise her status in the family. Lady Wang later suspected her of having an affair with Baoyu and publicly dismisses her on that account; angry at the unfair treatment and of the indignities and slanders that attended her as a result, Qingwen dies of an illness shortly after leaving the Jia household.
*Yuanyang (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Faithful) The Dowager&#x27;s chief maid. She rejects a marriage proposal (as concubine) to the lecherous Jia She, Grandmother Jia&#x27;s eldest son, and commits suicide right after the Dowager&#x27;s death.
*Mingyan (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Tealeaf) Baoyu&#x27;s page boy. Knows his master like the back of his hand.
*Zijuan (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Nightingale) Daiyu&#x27;s faithful maid, ceded by the Dowager to her granddaughter. She later becomes a nun to serve Jia Xichun.
*Xueyan (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Snowgoose) Daiyu&#x27;s other maid. She came with Daiyu from Yangzhou, and comes across as a young, sweet girl. She is asked to accompany the veiled bride Baochai to trick Baoyu into believing that he is marrying Daiyu.
*Concubine Zhao () A concubine of Jia Zheng. She is the mother of Jia Tanchun and Jia Huan, Baoyu&#x27;s half-siblings. She longs to be the mother of the head of the household, which she does not achieve. She plots to murder Baoyu and Xifeng with black magic, and it is believed that her plot cost her own life.

===Notable minor characters===

*Qin Zhong (, a homophone with &quot;great lover&quot;) – His elder sister is Qin Keqing, Baoyu&#x27;s nephew&#x27;s wife, and so he is technically a generation younger than Baoyu. Both he and Qin Keqing are the adopted children of Qin Ye(). The two boys enroll in the Jia clan&#x27;s school together and he becomes Baoyu&#x27;s best friend. The novel leaves open the possibility that things might have gone beyond innocent friendship. Qin Zhong and the novice Zhineng (, &quot;Intelligent&quot;; &quot;Sapientia&quot; in the Hawkes translation) fall in love but Qin Zhong dies soon after from a combination of his father&#x27;s severe beating, sexual exhaustion, grief and remorse. One commentator writes that Qin Zhong is a pun for &quot;qingzhong&quot; (passion incarnate), and that his sister Qinshi initiates Baoyu into heterosexual relations in his dream and Qin Zhong initiates him into homosexual ones. 
*Jia Yucun () — The childhood tutor of Lin Daiyu. Originally a poor scholar, he became a prefect with the help of Zhen Shiyin before being fired for corruption. He later connected himself with his distant relatives in the Jia family through the Lin family and was reinstated as prefect.
*Jia Lan () – Son of Baoyu&#x27;s deceased older brother Jia Zhu and his virtuous wife Li Wan. Jia Lan is an appealing child throughout the book and at the end succeeds in the imperial examinations to the credit of the family.
*Jia Zhen () – Head of the Ningguo House, the elder branch of the Jia family. He has a wife, Lady You, a younger sister, Jia Xichun, and many concubines. He is extremely greedy and the unofficial head of the clan, since his father has retired. He has an adulterous affair with his daughter-in-law, Qin Keqing.
*Lady You () – Wife of Jia Zhen. She is the sole mistress of the Ningguo House.
*Jia Rong () – Jia Zhen&#x27;s son. He is the husband of Qin Keqing. An exact copy of his father, he is the Cavalier of the Imperial Guards.
*Xue Baoqin () – The paternal cousin of Xue Baochai. Depicted as extremely beautiful and talented. Grandmother Jia originally sought to betroth her to Jia Baoyu.
*Second Sister You () – Jia Lian takes her in secret as his lover. Though a kept woman before she was married, after her wedding she becomes a faithful and doting wife. Because of Wang Xifeng&#x27;s intrigue, she finally kills herself by swallowing a large piece of gold.
*Liu Xianglian () – A descendant of the Liu family and an amateur actor. A bold man, he is good friends with Jia Baoyu and forms a brotherhood with Xue Pan.
*Lady Xing () – Jia She&#x27;s wife. She is Jia Lian&#x27;s stepmother.
*Xing Xiuyan () – The niece of Lady Xing. She is intelligent and courteous, but is a modest beauty due to her and her family&#x27;s financial struggles.
*Jia Huan () – Son of Concubine Zhao. He and his mother are both reviled by the family, and he carries himself like a kicked dog. He shows his malignant nature by spilling candle wax, intending to blind his half-brother Baoyu.
*Sheyue (; Hawkes/Minford translation: Musk) — Baoyu&#x27;s main maid after Xiren and Qingwen. She is beautiful and caring, a perfect complement to Xiren.
*Qiutong () — Jia Lian&#x27;s other concubine. Originally a maid of Jia She, she is given to Jia Lian as a concubine. She is a very proud and arrogant woman.
*Sister Sha () – A maid who does rough work for the Dowager. She is guileless but amusing and caring. In the Gao E and Cheng Weiyuan version, she unintentionally informs Daiyu of Baoyu&#x27;s secret marriage plans.

==Themes==

The opening chapter of the novel describes a great stone archway and on either side a couplet is inscribed:
This couplet is later reiterated, however this time as:
As one critic points out, the couplet signifies &quot;not a hard and fast division between truth and falsity, reality and illusion, but the impossibility of making such distinctions in any world, fictional or actual.&quot; It also symbolizes the peculiar Taoist religious tradition prevalent in Northern China since the Yuan dynasty as practiced in Cao&#x27;s time, as well as Taoism&#x27;s alternate roles in society such as doctrines for philosophical and intellectual rather than religious guidance and one of the schools of thought Buddhist sects in China syncretized with their own. This theme is further reflected in the name of the main family, Jia (, pronounced jiǎ), which is a homophone with the character jiǎ , meaning false or fictitious; this is mirrored the surname of the other main family, Zhen (, pronounced zhēn), a homophone for the word &quot;real&quot; (). It is suggested that the novel is both a realistic reflection and a fictional or &quot;dream&quot; version of Cao&#x27;s own family.

Early Chinese critics identified its two major themes as those of the nature of love, and of the transitoriness of earthly material values, as outlined in Buddhist and Taoist philosophies. 
Later scholars echoed the philosophical aspects of love and its transcendent power as depicted in the novel. One remarked that the novel is a remarkable example of the &quot;dialectic of dream and reality, art and life, passion and enlightenment, nostalgia and knowledge.&quot;

The novel also vividly depicts Chinese material culture, such as medicine, cuisine, tea culture, festivities, proverbs, mythology, Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, filial piety, opera, music, architecture, funeral rites, painting, classic literature and the Four Books. Among these, the novel is particularly notable for its grand use of poetry.

Since the establishment of Cao Xueqin as the novel&#x27;s author, its autobiographical aspects have come to the fore. Cao Xueqin&#x27;s clan was similarly raided in real life, and suffered a steep decline. Marxist interpretation starting in the New Culture Movement saw the novel as exposing feudal society&#x27;s corruption and emphasized the clashes between the classes. Since the 1980s, critics have embraced the novel&#x27;s richness and aesthetics in a more multicultural context.

In the title &quot;Hóng lóu Mèng&quot; (, literally &quot;Red Chamber Dream&quot;), &quot;red chamber&quot; can refer to the sheltered chambers where the daughters of a prominent family reside. It also refers to Baoyu&#x27;s dream in chapter five, set in a &quot;red chamber&quot;, a dream where the fates of many of the characters are foreshadowed. &quot;Mansion&quot; is one of the definitions of the Chinese character &quot;&quot; (lóu), but the scholar Zhou Ruchang writes that in the phrase &quot;hónglóu&quot; it is more accurately translated as &quot;chamber&quot;.

The novel&#x27;s mythological elements were also inspired by the services Cao was involved in at the Dongyue Temple. The temple&#x27;s most venerated gods came from Daoism, Chinese Buddhism, Tibetan Buddhism and shamanic traditions from various regions within and outside of China, and the book&#x27;s spiritual themes, prose stylization, and portrayals of mythical figures were inspired by the traditional stories told about these deities and other oral temple traditions from Beijing. Much of this folklore was already popular during the Yuan dynasty and was retold in various ways in Cao&#x27;s era in the Qing dynasty.

==Reception and influence in modern era==

In the late 19th century, &quot;Hong Lou Meng&quot; influence was so pervasive that the reformer Liang Qichao attacked it along with another classic novel, &quot;Water Margin&quot;, as &quot;incitement to robbery and lust&quot;, and for smothering the introduction of Western style novels, which he regarded as more socially responsible. The eminent scholar Wang Guowei, however, achieved a new method of literary interpretation in an innovative and path-breaking 1904 essay which invoked the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. Wang called the novel &quot;the tragedy of tragedies&quot;, in contrast to the prosperous endings in most earlier drama and fiction. Wang further proclaims the novel as &quot;worthy of being considered as the one great masterpiece in the realm of Chinese art.&quot;

In the early 20th century, although the New Culture Movement took a critical view of the Confucian classics, the scholar Hu Shih used the tools of textual criticism to put the novel in an entirely different light, as a foundation for national culture. Hu and his students, Gu Jiegang and Yu Pingbo, first established that Cao Xueqin was the work&#x27;s author. Taking the question of authorship seriously reflected a new respect for fiction, since the lesser forms of literature had not been traditionally ascribed to particular individuals. Hu next built on Cai Yuanpei&#x27;s investigations of the printing history of the early editions to prepare reliable reading texts. The final, and in some respects most important task, was to study the vocabulary and usage of Cao&#x27;s Beijing dialect as a basis for Modern Mandarin.

In the 1920s, scholars and devoted readers developed &quot;Hongxue&quot;, or Redology into both a scholarly field and a popular avocation. Among the avid readers was the young Mao Zedong, who later claimed to have read the novel five times and praised it as one of China&#x27;s greatest works of literature. The influence of the novel&#x27;s themes and style are evident in many modern Chinese prose works. The early 1950s was a rich period for Redology with publication of major studies by Yu Pingbo. Zhou Ruchang, who as a young scholar had come to the attention of Hu Shih in the late 1940s, published his first study in 1953, which became a best seller. But in 1954 Mao personally criticized Yu Pingbo for his &quot;bourgeois idealism&quot; in failing to emphasize that the novel exposed the decadence of &quot;feudal&quot; society and the theme of class struggle. In the Hundred Flowers Campaign, Yu came under heavy criticism but the attacks were so extensive and full of quotations from his work that they spread Yu&#x27;s ideas to many people who would not otherwise have known of their existence.

During the Cultural Revolution, the novel initially came under fire, though it quickly regained its prestige in the following years. Zhou Ruchang resumed his lifework, eventually publishing more than sixty biographical and critical studies. In 2006, Zhou, who had long distrusted Gao E&#x27;s editions, and the novelist Liu Xinwu, author of popular studies of the novel, joined to produce a new 80 chapter version which Zhou had edited to eliminate the Cheng-Gao emendations. Liu completed an ending that was supposedly more true to Cao&#x27;s original intent. The novel continues to be influential on contemporary Chinese poets such as Middle Generation&#x27;s An Qi, who paid homage to it in her poem &quot;To Cao Xueqin&quot;.

==Translations and reception in the West==

Cao utilizes many levels of colloquial and literary language and incorporates forms of classic poetry that are integral to the novel, making it a major challenge to translate. A 2014 study of fourteen translations of the novel concluded that the work is a &quot;challenge even to the most resourceful of translators, and the process of rendering it into another language is bound to involve more translation problems, techniques, and principles than the process of rendering any other literary work.&quot; Accordingly, the aims and achievements of the translators differ widely.

The first recorded translation into English was in 1812 by the Protestant missionary and sinologist Robert Morrison (1782–1834), who translated part of chapter four for the second volume of his unpublished 1812 book &quot;Horae Sinicae&quot;. In 1816, Morrison did publish a translation of a conversation from chapter 31 in his Chinese language textbook &quot;Dialogues and Detached Sentences in the Chinese Language&quot;. In 1819, the British diplomat and sinologist John Francis Davis (1795–1890) published a short excerpt in the &quot;London Journal Quarterly Review&quot;. Davis also published a poem from chapter 3 in the 1830 &quot;Transactions&quot; of the Royal Asiatic Society. In 1842, Karl Gützlaff&#x27;s article, &quot;Hung Lau Mung, or Dreams in the Red Chamber&quot;, in the sixth volume of the &quot;Chinese Repository&quot;, included translation and criticism of some passages.

A literal translation of selected passages was published for foreigners learning Chinese by the Presbyterian Mission Press of Ningbo in 1846. Edward Charles Bowra of the Chinese Imperial Maritime Customs published a translation of the first eight chapters in 1868 and H. Bencraft Joly of the first fifty-six chapters in 1892. The Reverend E.J. Eitel reviewed Joly&#x27;s translation and condemned the novel, saying that Chinese read it &quot;because of its wickedness.&quot; Herbert Giles, whom John Minford called &quot;one of the more free-thinking British consular officers,&quot; took a more favorable view in a twenty-five page synopsis in 1885 that Minford calls still a &quot;useful guide.&quot; 
Giles further highlighted it in his &quot;A History of Chinese Literature&quot; in 1901.

In 1928, Elfrida Hudson published a short introduction to the novel titled &quot;An old, old story&quot;. An abridged translation by Wang Chi-Chen which emphasized the central love story was published in 1929, with a preface by Arthur Waley. Waley said that &quot;we feel most clearly the symbolic or universal value&quot; of the characters in the passages which recount dreams. &quot;Pao Yu&quot;, Waley continued, stands for &quot;imagination and poetry&quot; and his father for &quot;all those sordid powers of pedantry and restriction which hamper the artist&quot;. In a 1930 review of Wang&#x27;s translation, Harry Clemons of &quot;The Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; wrote &quot;This is a great novel&quot;, and along with the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, it &quot;ranks foremost&quot; among the novels of classic Chinese literature. Although Clemons felt &quot;meaning was only fragmentarily revealed&quot; in the English translated prose and that &quot;many of the incidents&quot; and &quot;much of the poetry&quot; were omitted, he nevertheless thought &quot;at any rate the effort to read &quot;The Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; is eminently worth making.&quot; In 1958 Wang published an expansion on his earlier abridgement, though it was still truncated at 60 chapters.

The stream of translations and literary studies in the West grew steadily, building on Chinese language scholarship. The 1932 German translation by Franz Kuhn was the basis of an abridged version, &quot;The Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;, by Florence and Isabel McHugh published in 1958, and a later French version. Critic Anthony West wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; in 1958 that the novel is to the Chinese &quot;very much what &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot; is to Russian and &quot;Remembrance of Things Past&quot; is to French literature&quot; and &quot;it is beyond question one of the great novels of all literature.&quot; Kenneth Rexroth in a 1958 review of the McHugh translation, describes the novel as among the &quot;greatest works of prose fiction in all the history of literature&quot;, for it is &quot;profoundly humane&quot;. Bramwell Seaton Bonsall finished what is probably the first complete 120 chapter translation in the 1950s, &quot;Red Chamber Dream&quot;, but publication was abandoned when Penguin announced the Hawkes project. A typescript is available on the web.

The respected and prolific Yang Hsien-yi was commissioned to translate the first complete English version. Though he confessed that this was his least favorite of the classic novels, Yang began work in 1961 and had finished roughly 100 chapters in 1964, when he was ordered to stop. He and his wife, Gladys Yang, were imprisoned on suspicion of espionage during the Cultural Revolution, but they finished the translation as a team after their release in 1974. It was published by Beijing Foreign Language Press as &quot;A Dream of Red Mansions&quot;, in three volumes, 1978–1980. The second complete English translation to be published was by David Hawkes some century and a half after the first English translation. Hawkes was already a recognised redologist and had previously translated &quot;Chu Ci&quot; when Penguin Classics approached him in 1970 to make a translation which could appeal to English readers. After resigning from his professorial position, Hawkes published the first eighty chapters in three volumes (1973, 1977, 1980). &quot;The Story of the Stone&quot; (1973–1980), the first eighty chapters translated by Hawkes and last forty by his son-in-law John Minford consists of five volumes and 2,339 pages of actual core text (not including Prefaces, Introductions and Appendices) and over 2,800 pages in total. The word count of the Penguin Classics English translation is estimated at 845,000 words. In a 1980 review of the Hawkes and Minford translation in &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, Frederic Wakeman, Jr. described the novel as a &quot;masterpiece&quot; and the work of a &quot;literary genius&quot;. Cynthia L. Chennault of the University of Florida stated that &quot;The &quot;Dream&quot; is acclaimed as one of the most psychologically penetrating novels of world literature.&quot; The novel and its author have been described as among the most significant works of literature and literary figures of the past millennium.

The sinologist Oldřich Král also undertook a Czech translation of the entire novel, &quot;Sen v červeném domě&quot; (Prague: Odeon, three volumes, 1986–1988). Slovak sinologist and philosopher Marina Čarnogurská translated into Slovak whole four volumes of the novel, &quot;Sen o Červenom pavilóne&quot; (Bratislava: Petrus, 2001–2003. ).

In 2014, an abridged English translation of &quot;Dream&quot; by writer Lin Yutang resurfaced in a Japanese library. Lin&#x27;s translation, about half the length of the original, is reportedly not a literal one.

In a study of fourteen translations into English, German, French, Spanish, Laurence K. P. Wong finds that some challenges to translation are &quot;surmountable&quot;, some &quot;insurmountable,&quot; though translators sometimes hit on &quot;surprisingly happy versions that come very close to the original,&quot; Hawkes, however, normally came up with versions that are &quot;accurate, ingenious, and delightful&quot;. Hawkes recreates the meanings and sounds of the original with &quot;remarkable precision, achieving much greater success than any one of his fellow translators in surmounting the limits of literary translation&quot;. Another scholar agreed that the Yang&#x27;s translation is &quot;literal&quot; in the sense of rendering word for word, but argued that the Hawkes translation achieved what should be called a &quot;higher level of literalness: in the sense of &quot;text for text.&quot; That is, Hawkes tries to maintain the range and contrasting levels of usage of the original while the Yangs smooth out the language with a &quot;plain international English&quot; and add explanations in footnotes.

Other scholars examined particular aspects of the Yangs&#x27; translation and the Hawkes and Minford translation. The names of some characters sound like the words for their personality traits, and some names serve as allusions. Hawkes conveys the communicative function of the names rather than lexical equivalence; for example, Huo Qi is homonymous with &quot;the beginning of catastrophe&quot;, and Hawkes makes the English name &quot;Calamity&quot;. Hawkes sometimes uses Italian/Sanskrit terms when Western Christian culture lacks a term for a concept. Gladys Yang and Yang Hsien-yi prefer literal translation, informing readers of names&#x27; meanings through annotations. Zhu Jian-chun argued that Hawkes’ choice to simply translate certain names that are puns makes the author&#x27;s intentions clearer, and that the Yangs&#x27; choice of transliteration leaves the meaning more elusive, even if the transliterated names are more believable as character names. Zhu questioned the Yangs&#x27; translation of &quot;Dao Ren&quot; as &quot;reverend&quot;. According to Barry Lee Reynolds and Chao-Chih Liao, the Yangs&#x27; version contains more faithful translations of religious expressions but is also less readable to English language readers. Xuxiang Suo argued, “Hawkes successfully conveyed the original textual information to foreign readers with smooth and beautiful English, but the loss of Chinese culture-loaded information is inevitable. Mr. Yang mostly adopted the way of literal translation, trying his best to keep the true and idiomatic Chinese style and national tint.&quot;

==Sequels and continuations==
Owing to its immense popularity, numerous sequels and continuations to the novel have been published, even during the Qing era. There are currently more than thirty recorded sequels or continuations to the novel, including modern ones. Modern (post-1949) continuations tend to follow after the eightieth chapter, and include those by Zhang Zhi, Zhou Yuqing, Hu Nan and Liu Xinwu.

==Adaptations==

At least fourteen cinematic adaptations of the &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; have been made, including the 1944 film directed by Bu Wancang, the 1977 Shaw Brothers adaptation starring Sylvia Chang and Brigitte Lin, and the 1988 film directed by Xie Tieli () and Zhao Yuan (). This last film took two years to prepare and three years to shoot, and remains, at 735 minutes, the longest Chinese film ever made.

In 1981, Jiangsu Song and Dance Ensemble premiered a dance drama version of &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. A reworked version was performed in 1982 in Beijing by China Opera and Dance Drama Theatre featuring lead dancer Chen Ailian.

At least ten television adaptations have been produced (excluding numerous Chinese opera adaptations), and they include the renowned 1987 television series, which is regarded by many within China as being a near-definitive adaptation of the novel. It was initially somewhat controversial as few Redologists believed a television adaptation could do the novel full justice. Producer and director Wang Fulin&#x27;s decision in employing non-professional young actors was vindicated as the television series gained enormous popularity in China. The series&#x27; success owes much to composer Wang Liping (). He set many of the novel&#x27;s classical verses to music, taking as long as four years to deliberate and complete his compositions. Other television versions include a 1996 Taiwanese series and a 2010 version directed by Fifth Generation director Li Shaohong.

Unlike the other great Chinese novels, particularly &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, the &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot; has received little attention in the gaming world, with only two Chinese language visual novels having been released as of 2017. &quot;Hong Lou Meng&quot; and &quot;Hong Lou Meng: Lin Daiyu yu Bei Jingwang&quot; () were both released by Beijing Entertainment All Technology (). The latter one was released on 8 January 2010, and it is an extended version of the first game, with the main heroines of the game fully voiced and additional CG+endings.

An English-language opera based on the novel in two acts was composed by Chinese American composer Bright Sheng, with libretto by Sheng and David Henry Hwang. The three-hour opera had its world premiere on 10 September 2016, by the San Francisco Opera. For their 2020 album, &quot;Transience of Life&quot;, the American art-rock band Elysian Fields set several poems from the novel to music.

In the 2023 video game &quot;Limbus Company&quot; created by South Korean studio Project Moon, character Hong Lu is based on &quot;Dream of the Red Chamber&quot;. He is one of the 12 playable sinners in the game, and wields a guandao.

<doc id="263018" wikidata="Q309772" url="?curid=263018" title="Athenagoras of Athens">
<text>Athenagoras (; ; c. 133 – c. 190 AD) was a Father of the Church, an Ante-Nicene Christian apologist who lived during the second half of the 2nd century of whom little is known for certain, besides that he was Athenian (though possibly not originally from Athens), a philosopher, and a convert to Christianity. 

Athenagoras&#x27; feast day is observed on 24 July in the Eastern Orthodox Church.

==History==
In his writings he styles himself as &quot;Athenagoras, the Athenian, Philosopher, and Christian&quot;. There is some evidence that he was a Platonist, as Alexander Wilder puts it: “Pantaenus, Athenagoras and Clement were thoroughly instructed in the Platonic philosophy, and comprehended its essential unity with the Oriental systems”. A convert to Christianity, Athenagoras went to Alexandria and taught at what would become its celebrated Christian academy.

== Work and writings ==

Although his work appears to have been well-known and influential, mention of him by other early Christian apologists, notably in the extensive writings of Eusebius, is strangely absent. It may be that his treatises, circulating anonymously, were for a time considered as the work of another apologist, or there may have been other circumstances now lost. There are only two mentions of him in early Christian literature: several accredited quotations from his &quot;Apology&quot; in a fragment of Methodius of Olympus (died 312) and some untrustworthy biographical details in the fragments of the &quot;Christian History&quot; of Philip of Side (c. 425). Philip of Side claims that Athenagoras preceded Pantaenus as head of the Catechetical School of Alexandria (which is probably incorrect and contradicted by Eusebius) and notes that Athenagoras converted to Christianity after initially familiarizing himself with the Scriptures in an attempt to controvert them.

From the rhythm of his sentences, and the arrangement of his material, it can be surmised that he attended a school of rhetoric. His writings bear witness to his erudition and culture, his power as a philosopher and rhetorician, his keen appreciation of the intellectual temper of his age, and his tact and delicacy in dealing with the powerful opponents of his religion. Thus his writings are credited by some later scholars as having had a more significant impact on their intended audience than the now better-known writings of his more polemical and religiously-grounded contemporaries. Athenagoras was also an early Christian opponent of the death penalty: &quot;Athenagorus of Athens writes in his apology that: “…we cannot endure even to see a man put to death, though justly…”

Of his writings, there have been preserved but a few: his &quot;Embassy (πρεσβεία) for the Christians&quot; (more usually called by the Latin titled &quot;Legatio Pro Christianis&quot; or simply the &quot;Legatio&quot; and often referred to as the &quot;Apology&quot;), and a treatise titled the &quot;Resurrection of the Dead&quot; a.k.a. &quot;On the Resurrection of the Body&quot;.

===&quot;Legatio Pro Christianis&quot;===
The &quot;Embassy for the Christians&quot;, the date of which is fixed by internal evidence as late in 176 or 177, was a carefully written plea for justice to the Christians made by a philosopher, on philosophical grounds, to the Emperors Marcus Aurelius and his son Commodus, whom he flatters as conquerors, &quot;but above all, philosophers&quot;. 

The &quot;Apology&quot; is an early attempt to use Platonic ideas to interpret Christian belief for Greek and Roman cultures. He first complains of the illogical and unjust discrimination against the Christians and of the calumnies they suffer, and then meets the charge of atheism (a major complaint directed at the Christians of the day was that by disbelieving in the Roman gods, they were showing themselves to be atheists). This first strongly-reasoned argument for the unity of God in Christian literature is supplemented by an able exposition of the Trinity. 

Assuming then the defensive, he justifies the Christian abstention from worship of the national deities by arguing that it is absurd and indecent, quoting at length the pagan poets and philosophers in support of his contention. Finally, he meets the charges of immorality by exposing the Christian ideal of purity, even in thought, and the inviolable sanctity of the marriage bond. In refuting the charge of cannibalism Athenagoras states that Christians detest all cruelty and murder, refusing to attend contests of gladiators and wild beasts and holding that women who use drugs to bring on abortion commit murder for which they will have to give an account to God.

===&quot;On the Resurrection of the Dead&quot;===
The treatise on the &quot;Resurrection of the Dead&quot;, the first complete exposition of the doctrine in Christian literature, was written later than the &quot;Apology&quot;, to which it may be considered as an appendix. The writer brings to the defence of the doctrine the best that contemporary philosophy could adduce. After meeting the objections common to his time, he seeks to prove the possibility of a resurrection in view either of the power of the Creator, or of the nature of our bodies. To exercise such powers is neither unworthy of God nor unjust to other creatures. He argues that the nature and end of man demand a perpetuation of the life of body and soul. Although he clearly teaches the immortality of the soul and of the resurrection body, he argues that the soul is unconscious between death and resurrection: &quot;[T]hose who are dead and those who sleep are subject to similar states, as regards at least the stillness and the absence of all sense of the present or the past, or rather of existence itself and their own life.&quot;

<doc id="263021" wikidata="Q1754143" url="?curid=263021" title="Smile from the Streets You Hold">
<text>Smile from the Streets You Hold is the second studio album by American musician John Frusciante. It was released on August 26, 1997, on Birdman Records, while Frusciante was addicted to drugs and was no longer performing with Red Hot Chili Peppers. The record is an amalgamation of songs from various periods of time, mainly extras not included on Frusciante&#x27;s debut &quot;Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; (1994); included, however, are several tracks recorded in 1993, 1994, 1996 and &quot;A Fall Thru the Ground&quot; from 1988.

==Recording==
Many songs from &quot;Smile from the Streets You Hold&quot; were recorded when Frusciante was still with the Chili Peppers and are from the same period as his previous solo album, &quot;Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot;. One of the earliest songs to be recorded is &quot;A Fall Thru the Ground&quot;, which was recorded in 1988.

In a 1997 interview with &quot;Guitar Player&quot;, Frusciante claimed to have maintained active communication with the spirit world during the album&#x27;s recording phase:

Actor River Phoenix, a good friend of Frusciante and the rest of the Chili Peppers, is posthumously featured on two tracks, &quot;Height Down&quot; (originally titled &quot;Soul Removal&quot;), and &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve Been&quot; (originally titled &quot;Bought Her Soul&quot;). Both songs were supposed to be released on &quot;Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot;, but were pulled by request of Phoenix&#x27;s family after Phoenix&#x27;s death.

&quot;Life&#x27;s a Bath&quot; was recorded in late 1993 while Frusciante was living in a rental home after his former house was damaged in a fire. The previously mentioned &quot;Height Down&quot; and &quot;Well, I&#x27;ve Been&quot; were recorded in spring 1993 at Frusciante&#x27;s former home.

&quot;I May Again Know John&quot;, &quot;Enter a Uh&quot;, &quot;Nigger Song&quot; &amp; the second part of &quot;Smile From the Streets You Hold&quot; were recorded in late 1994 while Frusciante was living in New York City.

&quot;More&quot;, &quot;I Can&#x27;t See Until I See Your Eyes&quot;, and &quot;Estress&quot; were recorded to a cassette on a boombox in 1996. Frusciante&#x27;s poor health is apparent in his voice.

==Release==
Frusciante had &quot;Smile from the Streets You Hold&quot; and &quot;Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt&quot; removed from record stores in 1998 after rejoining the Red Hot Chili Peppers because he felt uncomfortable with them being available to the public. He is quoted as saying that he released &quot;Smile from the Streets You Hold&quot; for drug money. &quot;Niandra Lades&quot; was eventually re-issued and in the early 2000s, Frusciante stated he will one day re-release &quot;Smile from the Streets You Hold.&quot; 

There is also a second print of &quot;Smile from the Streets You Hold&quot; available. The songs on the second print are much lower in sound quality and have frequent hiss and hum, most notable in &quot;Nigger Song&quot; which obscures the recording somewhat. It has been speculated that the original release had had the recordings professionally mastered, but the second release used Frusciante&#x27;s untampered tapes by mistake.

The title song &quot;Smile from the Streets You Hold&quot;, is split in two separate tracks. During a 2001 solo performance, Frusciante said the song was about a friend, with the first half written while the person was alive and the second part being written after their death. Fans have speculated that the song may be about River Phoenix, although this has never been confirmed.

The second print also includes an extended version of &quot;Life&#x27;s a Bath&quot;. Another notable difference between the 17-track version and the 18-track version is that on the former, John can be heard taking a hit from a bong on &quot;For Air&quot;.

== Reception ==

Reviewing the album for &quot;Pitchfork&quot;, James Wisdom wrote: &quot;&quot;Smile For The Streets You Hold&quot; would easily have to be the easiest CD to hate that I&#x27;ve ever heard, but hidden between the disturbingly twisted and tortured vocals there are a few gems ... It&#x27;s fringe – way, way out there. I&#x27;m giving it a 0% because you&#x27;ll have to call this one on your own, sorry.&quot;

<text>Travel behavior is the study of what people do over geography, and how people use transport.

==Questions studied==
The questions studied in travel behavior are broad, and are probed through activity and time-use research studies, and surveys of travelers designed to reveal attitudes, behaviors and the gaps between them in relation to the sociological and environmental impacts of travel.

* How many trips do people make?
* Where do they go? (What is the destination?)
* What mode do they take?
* Who accompanies whom?
* When is the trip made? What is the schedule?
* What is the sequence or pattern of trips?
* What route choices do people make?
* Why do people travel? (Why can&#x27;t people stay at home and remote work or teleshop?)
* To what degree are people aware of the environmental and climate impacts of their travel choices?
* To what degree and how do people rationalize the environmental and climate impacts causes by their travel?
* Where changes in travel behavior would be beneficial to society, how might those changes be promoted?

Other behavioral aspects of traveling, such as letting people get off before entering a vehicle, queueing behavior, etc. (See for example Passenger behavior in Shanghai)

==Data==
These questions can be answered descriptively using a travel diary, often part of a travel survey or travel behavior inventory. Large metropolitan areas typically only do such surveys once every decade, though some cities are conducting panel surveys, which track the same people year after year. Such repeated surveys are useful because they yield different answers than surveys at a single point in time.

That data is generally used to estimate transportation planning models, so that transport analysts can make predictions about people who haven&#x27;t been surveyed. This is important in forecasting traffic, which depends on future changes to road networks, land use patterns, and policies.

Some years ago it was recognized that behavioral research was limited by data, and a special data set was developed to aid research: The Baltimore Disaggregate Data Set which is the result an in depth survey, ca. 1977. Its title indicates today’s emphasis on disaggregated rather than aggregated data. This particular data set is believed lost. A small program to preserve and make available on the web these travel behavior surveys, the Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive, is now under way at the University of Minnesota. There is also the National Personal Transportation Survey (later National Household Travel Survey), conducted every five years or so, but with much less spatial detail.

Today, the best source of information about travel behavior is a Household Travel Survey. In this type of data collection the sampling unit is the household and all its members because people interact the most with other people with whom they share a residence. Data on household characteristics, person characteristics, and a daily diary constitute the Household Travel Survey. The diary can be a trip diary (in which a person records every trip made in a day), or a place-based diary (in which a person record every location visited, the trips made to reach these location and the activities completed), or a time use diary (in which a person everything he/she does in day). Examples include the National Household Travel Survey, the California Household Travel Survey, The Puget Sound Travel Survey. Data from these surveys can be found at https://www.nrel.gov/transportation/secure-transportation-data/.
==Travel behavior and activity analysis==
Analysis of travel behavior from the home can answer the question: How does the family participate in modern society. Consider two non-observable extremes. At one extreme we have the non-specialized household. It does everything for itself, and no travel is required. Ultimate specialization is the other extreme; travel is required for all things. Observed households are somewhere in between. The “in between” position of households might be thought of as the consequence of two matters.

# There is social and economic structure – the organization of society. To participate in this society, the household specializes its occupations, education, social activities, etc.
# The extent to which members of the household specialize turns on their attributes and resources.

Moore (1964) has observed that increasing specialization in all things is the chief feature of social change. Considering social changes, one might observe that 100 years ago things were less specialized compared to today. So we would expect lots of change in household travel over the time period. Data are not very good, but the travel time aspect of what’s available seems contrary to the expectation, travel hasn’t changed much. For instance, the time spent on the journey to work may have been stable for centuries (the travel budget hypothesis). Here are some travel time comparisons from John Robinson (1986).

Most travel behavior analysis concerns demand issues and do not touch very much on supply issues. Yet when we observe travel from a home, we are certainly observing some sort of market clearing process – demand and supply are matched.

==History of travel behavior analysis==
Analytic work on travel behavior can be dated from Liepmann (1945). Liepmann obtained and analyzed 1930s data on worker travel in England. Many of the insights current today were found by Liepmann: time spent, ride sharing, etc. Most academics date modern work from advances in mode choice analysis made in the 1970s. This created much excitement, and after some years an International Association for Travel Behaviour Research emerged. There are about 150 members of the Association; it holds a conference every three years. The proceedings of those conferences yield a nice record of advances in the field. The proceedings also provide a record of topics of lasting interest and of changing priorities. Mode choice received priority early on, but in the main today’s work is not so much on theory as it is on practice. Hagerstrand (1970) developed a time and space path analysis, often called the time-space prism.

==Gender difference in travel patterns==
On November 18–20, 2004, Transportation Research Board (TRB) held its third conference in Chicago, Illinois, with an interest in advancing the understanding of women’s issues in transportation. One of the presented studies, conducted by Nobis et al., revealed that the gender difference in travel patterns is linked to employment status, household structure, child care, and maintenance tasks. They found that travel patterns of men and women are much similar when considering single families; the differences are greater once males and females are compared in multi-person households without children; and are the highest once they live in households with children. Over the past two decades numerous studies have been conducted on travel behavior showing gender as an influential factor in travel decision making.

<text>Davao del Sur (; ), officially the Province of Davao del Sur (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Davao Region in Mindanao. Its capital is Digos. Davao City is the largest city in terms of area and population within the province&#x27;s jurisdiction, yet it is administratively independent from the province; as such, Davao City is only grouped for geographical and statistical purposes and serves as the regional center of Davao Region.

The province is bounded by Davao del Norte to the north, Davao Occidental to the south-east, North Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat to the west, South Cotabato and Sarangani to the south-west, and Davao Gulf to the east.

==History==
===Maguindanao era===
A Maguindanaon Datu under the name Datu Bago was rewarded the territory of the surroundings of Davao Gulf by the Sultan of Maguindanao Sultanate for joining the campaign against the Spanish in the late 1700s. From his ancestral home in Maguindanao, he moved to the area in 1800 and, having convinced Bagobos and other native groups in the area to his side, conquered the entire Davao Gulf area. Having consolidated his position, he founded the fortress of &quot;Pinagurasan&quot; in what is now the site of Bangkerohan Public Market in 1830 which served as his capital. From being a fortification and base of operations from which Datu Bago could gather and rally his forces, the settlement of Pinagurasan eventually grew into a small city extending from present-day Generoso Bridge in Bangkerohan to Quezon Boulevard more than a kilometer down south, as Maguindanaons and Bagobos alike among other nearby tribes in the area flocked into the settlement, eventually becoming the main trade entrepot in the Davao Gulf area. With his immense overlordship of Davao Gulf, Datu Bago was eventually crowned Sultan by his subjects at his capital Pinagurasan in 1843, effectively making his realm virtually independent from the Sultanate of Maguindanao and is now itself a Sultanate that lords over Davao Gulf, now in equal standing with the Mindanaon Muslim kingdoms of Maguindanao and Sulu.

===Spanish colonial era===
Beginnings of both Davao Region and Davao del Sur were associated with the foundation of Davao, which was the first town to be founded in southern Mindanao in 1848, following the conquest of the area by José Uyanguren of the Basque province of Gipuzkoa, Spain (Guipúzcoa in Spanish). In 1849, Nueva Guipúzcoa province was founded in the region conquered by Uyanguren in what is now Davao Region, with Davao, then called &quot;Nueva Vergara&quot;, as the provincial capital. Uyanguren became the provincial governor, but he failed in his efforts to develop Nueva Guipúzcoa.

Thirty-six years after the foundation of Davao, the town of Santa Cruz was founded on October 5, 1884. It is the first town to be founded south of Davao and is now the oldest in the province.

===American invasion era===
The Spanish administration in the Philippines ended in 1898 following the defeat of the Spaniards during the Spanish–American War. In the early 1900s, waves of immigrants from the Visayas, Luzon, and as well as from China and Japan began to live in the region, centered mainly in Davao. The region began to boom in economic growth as agricultural business proliferated in the region.

As part of the &quot;food bowl&quot; of what is now the province of Davao del Sur, otherwise known as the &quot;Padada Valley&quot;, the agricultural area south of the town of Santa Cruz, which is known as &quot;Digos&quot; that time, lured many migrants, majority of whom came from the Visayas and Ilocos regions to settle permanently in the area. Before World War II, an enterprising American by the name of N.E. Crumb leased and transformed the place into an abaca plantation. This became the hub of economic activity in the locality during those days.

===Japanese occupation era===
In 1942, during the start of the World War II in the Pacific, the first waves of invading Japanese units landed and entered the province of southern Davao.

In 1945, the liberation of southern Davao by United States and Philippine Commonwealth troops was supported by Davaoeño guerrilla fighters.

===Philippine independence===
In 1967, Davao Province was divided into three provinces, one of them being Davao del Sur; the town of Digos was made its capital and would become a suburban city for the next 33 years.

===Contemporary===
On October 28, 2013, along with the Barangay Elections, a plebiscite was held to create a new province Davao Occidental, formed out of the southern part of Davao del Sur, covering the municipalities of the 2nd district of the province, namely Don Marcelino, Jose Abad Santos, Santa Maria, Sarangani and Malita (which was designated as the provincial capital) by virtue of &quot;Republic Act 10360&quot; enacted on July 23, 2013, and the majority of votes cast were &quot;Yes&quot;, ratifying the province.

In 2015, the &quot;National Competitiveness Council&quot;, ranked the province as the most competitive province in the country.

==Geography==
Davao del Sur covers a total area of occupying the southwestern section of the Davao Region in Mindanao. When Davao City is included for geographical purposes, the province&#x27;s land area is . The province is bounded by Davao del Norte to the north; Davao Occidental to the south-east; North Cotabato and Sultan Kudarat to the west; South Cotabato and Sarangani to the south-west; and Davao Gulf to the east.

The province is composed of sandy beaches and outlying islands, agricultural plains and valleys, rainforests, swamps, rolling hills and mountains, including the Philippines&#x27; highest peak, Mount Apo, which is at above sea level.

===Administrative divisions===
Davao del Sur comprises 9 municipalities and 1 component city, all encompassed by a lone legislative district. Davao City, although part of the province for geographical and statistical purposes, is governed independently from the province.



===Climate===
The province enjoys a mild, pleasant climate all year round. Because of its topographical characteristics and geographical location, it is rarely visited by typhoons. There is no pronounced wet or dry season. The coolest months are from November to February with an average temperature of . during the peak summer months from March to May, temperatures average but may rise as high as .

==Demographics==

The population of Davao del Sur in the 2020 census was 680,481 people, with a density of . When Davao City is included for geographical purposes, the province&#x27;s population is 2,265,579 people, with a density of .

Davao del Sur is an ethnic mix of Visayans (mostly Cebuanos), Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans with a number of indigenous ethnic groups scattered across the province. The Cebuano language, with Davaoeño as its regional variant, is the main language of the province, although Filipino and English are also widely spoken and used in government functions and publications. Since the late 20th century, a linguistic phenomenon has developed in the Metro Davao area whereby locals have either shifted to the &#x27;national language&#x27; (Filipino) or significantly mix Filipino terms and grammar into their Cebuano speech.

===Religion===
====Catholicism====
Christianity in the form of Roman Catholicism is the predominant religion in the province followed by more than 80% of the people.

====Others====
The remaining faiths are Islam and other Christians such as Aglipayan, Baptists, Iglesia ni Cristo, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Seventh-day Adventist, other Evangelical Christians and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses.

===Indigenous groups===
====Moro peoples====

The major Moro ethnic group is the Kagan tribe, an Islamized group related to the Tagacaolos, Mandaya, Mansaka, and Kalagan, since Davao del Sur was once part of Sultanate of Maguindanao. Some Moro tribes that can be found in Davao del Sur are Maguindanaon, Maranao, Tausug and Iranun.

====Lumad peoples====
The Bagobo people live in an area that extends from Davao del Sur and South Cotabato to the foot of Mount Apo and Davao City all the way to the land bordered by the Davao and Pulangi rivers and up to northern Cotabato and southeast Bukidnon. Numbering about 80,000, their traditional costume is woven from abaca fiber and heavily ornamented with beads, shells, metal discs, embroidery and brightly colored geometric applique. Though Bagobos have the most stunning costumes among the Davao ethnic groups, they wear them only on special occasions. Like the Mandayas and Mansakas, they shave their eyebrows to a thin line and file and blacken their teeth. Bagobo smiths cast little bells which are attached to pouches, bracelets, jackets, anklets and inlaid metal boxes.

The Tagacaolo people number about 23,000 and occupy the area between the western shores of the gulf and the slopes of Mount Apo. This is one of the tribes which resisted Muslim conversion and maintained a highland animistic culture.

The Kalagan people are part Islamized and part Chistianized and related to the Tagacaolos. Numbering only about 7,000, they live along the shores of Davao Gulf.

The Mangguangan people now number only 3,000. They can be found in Davao del Sur and Davao del Norte.

In both groups, women generally wear handwoven abaca tube skirts, embroidered blue cotton tops and heavy jewellery. Men sport wide blue or white fringed and embroidered trousers and a loose shirt. Red is a color only for a headman (&quot;bagani&quot;) and for women of high status.

====Aeta people====

Aeta people live in some areas of Davao City all the way to Davao del Norte, Compostela Valley and Bukidnon. They are related to the Manobos of Cotabato and include sub-groups such as the &quot;Talaingod&quot; of the Kapalong forests in Davao del Norte and the &quot;Matigsalug&quot;. Numbering about 222,000, Ata men wear long-sleeved shirts, carry spears, hunt, log and grow crops. Their womenfolk wear native blouses, &quot;malong&quot; skirts and accessories of brass bracelets and bead necklaces. &quot;Mandaya&quot; and &quot;Mansaka&quot; are culturally related groups who are highly musical - playing the five string bamboo guitar, two-string lute, violin, flute, gong, drum and bamboo Jew&#x27;s harp. They are also excellent silversmiths crafting breastplates, jewellery, daggers and knives. The &quot;Mandayas&quot; are famous for their colorful abaca fiber weaves embroidered with tribal motifs.

==Economy==
==Art and culture==

The colorful artistic heritage of Davao stems from the rich culture of its tribes. For the Bagobos, aesthetics is the meticulous carving of weapons; the elaborate decoration of inlaid metal boxes with bells; and the ornamentation of their abaca fiber dress with embroidery, shells, beads and metal discs. The Mandayas, on the other hand, have a solid tradition in weaving. To produce their famed coarse textured cloth, abaca fiber is colored with earth dyes and woven on a backstrap loom.

The final product is embroidered with bright-colored threads in geometric patterns. Some elements of tribal folklore are also included in the designs. The Mansakas, together with the Mandayas, are also expert silversmiths. They craft weapons, breastplates and dress accessories. Much of its people are Christians. Davao is also a harmonious blend of Christian and Muslim cultures. However, its most stunning cultural aspect is definitely its ethnic art which encompasses music, dance, religious ritual, dress and ornamentation.

<text>Anadoluhisarı (), known historically as Güzelce Hisar (&quot;the Beauteous Fortress&quot;) is a medieval Ottoman fortress located in Istanbul, Turkey on the Anatolian (Asian) side of the Bosporus. The complex is the oldest surviving Turkish architectural structure built in Istanbul, and further gives its name to the neighborhood around it in the city&#x27;s Beykoz district.

==History==
Anadoluhisarı was built between 1393 and 1394 on the commission of the Ottoman Sultan Bayezid I, as part of his preparations for a siege of the then-Byzantine city of Constantinople.

Constructed on an area of , the fortress is situated at the narrowmost point of the Bosporus, where the strait is a mere wide. The site is bound by Göksu () creek to the south, and was previously home to the ruins of a Roman temple dedicated to Uranus. Erected primarily as a watch fort, the citadel has a tall, quadratic main tower within the walls of an irregular pentagon, with five watchtowers at the corners.

Constantinople was blockaded from 1394 on, but Bayezid&#x27;s campaign was first interrupted by the Crusade of Nicopolis, and then ended with his defeat at the Battle of Ankara. An 11-year civil war followed, which ended with the ascent of Mehmed I to the throne. His grandson, Sultan Mehmed II reinforced the fortress with a two-meter-thick wall and three additional watchtowers, and added further extensions, including a warehouse and living quarters. As part of his plans to launch a renewed military campaign to conquer Constantinople, Mehmed II further built a sister structure to Anadoluhisarı across the Bosphorus called Rumelihisarı. The two fortresses worked in tandem in 1453 to throttle all maritime traffic along the Bosphorus, thus helping the Ottomans achieve their goal of making the city of Constantinople (later renamed Istanbul) their new imperial capital.

After the Ottoman conquest of the city, Anadoluhisarı served as a customs house and military prison, and after several centuries, fell into disrepair.

After the fall of the Ottomans and the 1923 establishment of the Republic of Turkey, the newly created Turkish Ministry of Culture tended to and ultimately restored the site in 1991–1993. Today, Anadoluhisarı lends a picturesque appearance to its corner of the Bosphorus alongside the timber yalı homes that define the neighborhood, and functions as a historical site, although it is not open to the public. The latest restoration was conducted by Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality which started in 2021.

<doc id="263035" wikidata="Q726480" url="?curid=263035" title="Calder Memorial Trophy">
<text>The Calder Memorial Trophy is an annual award given &quot;to the player selected as the most proficient in his first year of competition in the National Hockey League (NHL).&quot; It is named after Frank Calder, the first president of the NHL. Serving as the NHL&#x27;s Rookie of the Year award, this version of the trophy has been awarded since its creation for the 1936–37 NHL season. The voting is conducted by members of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association at the conclusion of each regular season to determine the winner.

== Eligibility ==

When the award was established in 1937, there were no requirements beyond that the winner be in his first year of competition in the NHL, and the winner was decided by League President Frank Calder himself.

Currently, the eligibility requirements are that a player cannot have played more than 25 regular season games in any single preceding season, nor in six or more games in each of any two preceding regular seasons, in any major professional league. The last requirement was implemented in 1979 to block Wayne Gretzky (who had played a single season in the World Hockey Association the year before) from winning the award. After the Calder win of 31-year-old Sergei Makarov in 1991 (following the influx of Eastern Bloc players after the fall of the Soviet Union), the rules were further amended to require that winners be 26 years of age or younger.

Further, the limitation is for regular season games only, exempting games played in the playoffs. This has led to aberrations such as Ken Dryden winning the Calder in 1972, despite leading the Montreal Canadiens to a Stanley Cup victory the season before, and winning the Conn Smythe Trophy as the playoff MVP.

== History ==

The Calder Memorial Trophy is named in honour of Frank Calder, the former president of the National Hockey League (NHL) from its inception in 1917 to his death in 1943. Although &quot;Rookie of the Year&quot; honors were handed out beginning in 1932–33, the Calder Trophy was first presented at the conclusion of the 1936–37 NHL season. Calder himself purchased a trophy each year to award to the winner.

After Calder&#x27;s death in 1943 a permanent trophy was cast, and it was renamed the Calder Memorial Trophy.

The trophy has been won the most times by rookies from the Toronto Maple Leafs, who have won it on ten occasions, with the most recent being Auston Matthews in 2017. The second-most is the Chicago Blackhawks with nine wins. 

Since the 1948 season, the voting is conducted at the end of the regular season by members of the Professional Hockey Writers&#x27; Association, and each individual voter ranks their top five candidates on a 10–7–5–3–1 points system. Three finalists are named and the trophy is awarded at the NHL Awards ceremony after the playoffs.

<text>John Glen Wardrop (1922–1989), born in Warwick, England, was an English mathematician and transport analyst who developed what became known as Wardrop&#x27;s first and second principles of equilibrium in the field of traffic assignment.

He studied at Downing College, Cambridge, and worked in Operational Research at British Bomber Command during the Second World War. He then helped to set up, and later headed, the Traffic Section of the Road Research Laboratory near Slough – part of the Directorate of Scientific and Industrial Research within the UK Civil Service – where he published his work on equilibrium. He subsequently followed Dr Reuben Smeed to University College London, becoming Reader Emeritus in Traffic Studies.

== Wardrop equilibria ==

In studies about traffic assignment, network equilibrium models are commonly used for the prediction of traffic patterns in transportation networks that are subject to congestion. The idea of traffic equilibrium originated as early as 1924, with Frank Knight.

The concepts are related to the idea of Nash equilibrium in game theory developed separately. However, in transportation networks, there are many players, making the analysis complex.

In 1952, Wardrop stated two principles that formalize different notions of equilibrium, and introduced the alternative behaviour postulate of the minimization of the total travel costs:

Wardrop&#x27;s first principle of route choice, now known as &quot;user equilibrium&quot;, &quot;selfish Wardrop equilibrium&quot; or just &quot;Wardrop equilibrium&quot;, which is identical to the notion postulated by Knight, became accepted as a sound and simple behavioural principle to describe the spreading of trips over alternate routes because of congested conditions. It states:

The journey times in all routes actually used are equal and less than those that would be experienced by a single vehicle on any unused route. 

The traffic flows that satisfy this principle are usually referred to as &quot;user equilibrium&quot; (UE) flows, since each user chooses the route that is the best. Specifically, a user-optimized equilibrium is reached when no user may lower his transportation cost through unilateral action. A variant is the stochastic user equilibrium (SUE), in which no driver can unilaterally change routes to improve his/her perceived, rather than actual, travel times.

Wardrop&#x27;s second principle, now known as &quot;system optimal&quot; or &quot;social Wardrop equilibrium&quot; states that at equilibrium, the average journey time is at a minimum. That implies that all users behave cooperatively in choosing their routes to ensure the most efficient use of the whole system. For example, this would be the case if an omnipotent central authority could command them all which routes to take. Traffic flows satisfying Wardrop&#x27;s second principle are generally deemed system optimal (SO). Economists and modellers have argued that it can be achieved with marginal cost road pricing, or by a central routing authority dictating route choices.

The potential fall in efficiency from social to selfish equilibria is an example of the price of anarchy.

Wardrop did not provide algorithms for solving Wardrop equilibria, he simply defined them as desiderata. The first mathematical model of network equilibrium was formulated by Beckmann, McGuire and Winsten in 1956. As with Nash equilibria, simple solutions to selfish equilibrium can be found through iterative simulation, with each agent assigning its route given the choices of the others. This is very slow computationally. The Frank–Wolfe algorithm improves on this by exploiting dynamic programming properties of the network structure, to find solutions with a faster form of iteration. Creating new and faster algorithms for both selfish and social Wardrop equilibria remains an active research topic in the 2010s.

<text>Frank Hyneman Knight (November 7, 1885 – April 15, 1972) was an American economist who spent most of his career at the University of Chicago, where he became one of the founders of the Chicago School.

Nobel laureates Milton Friedman, George Stigler and James M. Buchanan were all students of Knight at Chicago. Ronald Coase said that Knight, without teaching him, was a major influence on his thinking. F.A. Hayek considered Knight to be one of the major figures in preserving and promoting classical liberal thought in the twentieth century.

Paul Samuelson named Knight (along with Harry Gunnison Brown, Allyn Abbott Young, Henry Ludwell Moore, Wesley Clair Mitchell, Jacob Viner, and Henry Schultz) as one of the several &quot;American saints in economics&quot; born after 1860.

==Life and career==
Knight (BA, Milligan College, 1911; BS and AM, Tennessee, 1913; PhD, Cornell, 1916) was born in 1885 in McLean County, Illinois, the son of Julia Ann (Hyneman) and Winton Cyrus
Knight. After his early study at the University of Tennessee, most of his academic career was spent at the University of Chicago, where he was the Morton D. Hall Distinguished Service Professor of Social Science and Philosophy. Knight was one of the world&#x27;s leading economists, having made significant contributions to many problems of both economic theory and social philosophy. He is best known for his &quot;Risk, Uncertainty and Profit&quot;, a study of the role of the entrepreneur in economic life. In 1950 he was president of the American Economic Association and in 1957 the recipient of its coveted Francis A. Walker Award, given &quot;not more frequently than once every five years to the living (American) economist who in the judgment of the awarding body has during his career made the greatest contribution to economics.&quot; His ashes are interred in the crypt of First Unitarian Church of Chicago.

Knight is best known as the author of the book &quot;Risk, Uncertainty and Profit&quot; (1921), based on his PhD dissertation at Cornell University. In that book, he carefully distinguished between economic risk and uncertainty. Situations with risk were those where the outcomes were unknown but governed by probability distributions known at the outset. He argued that these situations, where decision making rules such as maximising expected utility can be applied, differ in a deep way from &quot;uncertain&quot; ones, in which not only the outcomes, but even the probability models that governed them, were unknown. Knight argued that uncertainty gave rise to economic profits that perfect competition could not eliminate.

While most economists now acknowledge Knight&#x27;s distinction between risk and uncertainty, the distinction has not resulted in much theoretical modelling or empirical work. However, the Knightian concept of uncertainty has been recognized in a variety of works: John Maynard Keynes discussed it at length in his Treatise on Probability;

Armen Alchian relied on it for discussing market behavior in his seminal paper Uncertainty, Evolution and Economic Theory; Paul Davidson incorporated it as an essential element in the 
Post Keynesian school of economics he co-founded; and G.L.S. Shackle explored the methodological consequences of Knight&#x27;s and Keynes&#x27;s fundamental uncertainty in his Epistemics and Economics. A more model-oriented contribution is the &quot;Markets from Networks&quot; model developed by sociologist Harrison White from 2002.

Knight also famously debated A. C. Pigou about social costs. He also contributed to the argument for toll roads. He said that rather than congestion justifying government tolling of roads, privately owned roads would set tolls to reduce congestion to its efficient level. In particular, he developed the argument that forms the basis of analysis of traffic equilibrium, which has since become known as Wardrop&#x27;s Principle:

Knight was a co-founder and vice president of the Mont Pelerin Society of like-minded economists.

Knight was raised Christian, but later became an atheist.

He translated Max Weber&#x27;s &quot;General Economic History&quot; into English in 1927.

<text>Daniel Alfredsson (; born 11 December 1972), nicknamed &quot;Alfie&quot;, is a Swedish-Canadian former professional ice hockey player and assistant coach for the Ottawa Senators. He spent 18 seasons in the National Hockey League (NHL), primarily with the Senators. He also briefly played for the Detroit Red Wings before his retirement in 2014.

Alfredsson was captain of the Senators, serving from 1999 to 2013. With the Senators, Alfredsson usually played on the first line, which was formerly nicknamed the &quot;CASH&quot; or &quot;Pizza&quot; line with centre Jason Spezza and left winger Dany Heatley, before Heatley&#x27;s trade to the San Jose Sharks. He had traditionally been the fourth forward on the ice in the role of pointman on Ottawa&#x27;s power play unit. One of the league&#x27;s top two-way players, he holds the Senators&#x27; franchise records for goals (426), assists (682) and points (1,108) with 1,178 games played. He had played for Sweden internationally 14 times, including the 2006 gold medal and 2014 silver medal-winning Olympic teams. He was the 75th player to reach 1,000 career points in the NHL, doing so after scoring three goals in a win over the Buffalo Sabres on 22 October 2010. 

Alfredsson holds an Honorary Degree from Carleton University and was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 2022. He was inducted into the IIHF Hall of Fame in 2018.

==Playing career==
===Ottawa Senators (1994–2013)===
Drafted 133rd overall in the sixth round of the 1994 NHL entry draft, Alfredsson was a serendipitous pick by the Ottawa Senators. He had been overlooked by many NHL scouts, but one man in Ottawa&#x27;s front office, John Ferguson, saw the potential and pushed management for his selection. Though largely unheralded entering his first NHL training camp, he would go on to win the Calder Memorial Trophy as rookie of the year in his first NHL season in 1995–96 and was the Senators&#x27; representative at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game. In 1996–97, he improved on his rookie totals and played in the All-Star Game again. He finished second in team scoring, contributing to the Senators&#x27; first modern qualification to the Stanley Cup playoffs.

Alfredsson missed the beginning of the 1997–98 season due to a contract dispute. On 24 August 1997, he demanded a trade from the Senators after the five-year contract offered to him was worth $1 million less annually than that teammate Alexei Yashin received per season. Alfredsson eventually signed a new contract on 12 October worth $14 million over four years. After missing the first five games of the season, he was greeted by a standing ovation in his first game back in Ottawa. Alfredsson would later be named the Senators&#x27; representative at the All-Star Game for the third consecutive season. During that season, Alfredsson would play in only 55 games, due to the earlier contract dispute and a late season ankle injury. The Senators qualified for the playoffs again and defeated the New Jersey Devils, but lost to the surging Washington Capitals in the second round; Alfredsson scored 7 goals in 11 playoff games.

In the 1998–99 season, Alfredsson missed 24 games due to an injury and was limited to only 11 goals. The club once again qualified for the playoffs, and Alfredsson hoped to have a good post-season, but was limited to one goal and three points in a sweep at the hands of the Buffalo Sabres. The next season, he was named captain of the Senators after Alexei Yashin was stripped of the captaincy for refusing to honour his contract. After two somewhat disappointing seasons, Alfredsson&#x27;s scoring totals improved, with 21 goals and 59 points in 57 games. In the 2000 playoffs, the Senators met the Toronto Maple Leafs in the Eastern Conference Quarterfinals. The Senators would lose the inaugural &quot;Battle of Ontario&quot;, although Alfredsson contributed three goals in the six-game series.

In 2000–01, Alexei Yashin returned to the Ottawa lineup but the team captaincy remained with Alfredsson, who would score 24 goals and 70 points in 68 games. The Senators again met the Maple Leafs in the first round of the 2001 playoffs, and Alfredsson was limited to one goal in a four-game series sweep by Toronto. In 2001–02, Alfredsson set a personal best with 37 goals and 71 points in 78 games. In the 2002 playoffs, the Senators once again met the now arch-rival Maple Leafs in the second round, where they lost in seven games. Alfredsson led the team in playoff scoring with 7 goals and 13 points in 12 games.

Alfredsson signed a new two-year contract prior to the 2002–03 season. He increased his scoring totals, finishing with 27 goals and 78 points. The club won the Presidents&#x27; Trophy that season as the NHL&#x27;s top regular season team, despite the organization filing for bankruptcy protection, and qualified for the Eastern Conference Finals before losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils. Alfredsson scored 4 goals and 8 points in 18 games.

In 2003–04, Alfredsson finished the season with 32 goals and 80 points in 78 games. The club lost in the first round of the 2004 playoffs to Toronto, and Alfredsson was limited to one goal and three points in the seven-game series. Mid-season, Alfredsson signed a new five-year contract with the Senators.

Like many NHL players, Alfredsson played for a European team during the 2004–05 NHL lockout. He returned to Sweden to play for Frölunda HC, the team he had played for prior to beginning his NHL career. He played on an all-NHL line with P. J. Axelsson and Samuel Påhlsson, helping the club win the Swedish championship. Alfredsson was a major contributor during the playoffs, scoring 12 goals and 18 points in 13 games.

On 5 October 2005, the opening night of the 2005–06 NHL season, the Senators played the Maple Leafs, with the newly acquired Dany Heatley playing on the top line with Jason Spezza and Brandon Bochenski. The Senators were down by a goal with five minutes remaining in the third period, when Alfredsson, replacing Bochenski on the top line, scored the tying goal. This line combination would remain intact and became known as the &quot;CASH line&quot;. Later in the same game, Heatley and Alfredsson scored the first goals in a regular season NHL shootout when they scored against Maple Leafs goaltender Ed Belfour for a 3–2 victory. With Alfredsson scoring in the shootout, he became the first captain in the NHL history to do so. Alfredsson and Heatley&#x27;s sticks were subsequently sent to the Hockey Hall of Fame.

Alfredsson capped off the 2005–06 regular season with a career-high 103 points (43 goals and 60 assists) tied for first on the Senators alongside Heatley. Perhaps the best game of his NHL career took place on 3 November 2005 against the longtime rival Buffalo Sabres, in which he scored a then career-high four goals and six points. After a disappointing 2006 playoffs, Alfredsson became the subject of trade rumours from the beginning of the 2006–07 season.

Because of his poor play to start the 2006–07 season, Alfredsson considered retirement in November 2006. However, after switching to using teammate Chris Kelly&#x27;s used skates, his performance improved, scoring in the next four games, and ending the season with 29 goals and 58 assists. Alfredsson, notably picky about his skates, would continue to use Kelly&#x27;s freshly broken-in skates until the latter was traded to the Boston Bruins in 2011.

On 23 December 2006, against the Philadelphia Flyers, Alfredsson scored his 600th career point, scoring two goals and adding an assist. In the 2007 playoffs, Alfredsson was the Senators&#x27; leading scorer with 14 goals and 22 points in 20 games. His leadership and strong play helped the Senators as they advanced past the Pittsburgh Penguins, the New Jersey Devils and the Buffalo Sabres, to reach the Stanley Cup Finals for the first time in modern franchise history. He became the first European-born-and-raised captain to lead his team to the Stanley Cup finals. When presented with the Prince of Wales Trophy, he touched the trophy while posing with it, which many hockey players consider a form of bad luck.

Alfredsson was arguably Ottawa&#x27;s best player in the 2007 Stanley Cup Finals, which the Senators ultimately lost to the Anaheim Ducks in a five-game series. In a controversial incident in game four, an Alfredsson slap shot hit Ducks captain Scott Niedermayer at the end of the second period, leading to speculation that Alfredsson intended to injure Niedermayer. Alfredsson dismissed the notion, saying that he had glanced up at the clock to see if he had time to move in for a better shot, and then quickly fired in the heat of an important game.

Along with the rest of the Senators, Alfredsson&#x27;s 2007–08 season was marked by highs and lows. On 24 January 2008, he scored three goals and four assists in an 8–4 victory over the Tampa Bay Lightning, setting the Senators&#x27; record for most points in one game. It vaulted him into the NHL scoring lead at the All-Star break. He was named NHL Player of the Week and the week&#x27;s First Star. Alfredsson and his linemates, Heatley and Spezza, were named to the Eastern Conference All-Star Game roster, although Heatley would not play due to injury. Injuries reduced Alfredsson&#x27;s playing time and effectiveness in the latter half of the season. First, Alfredsson suffered a hip pointer injury, and on 3 April 2008, Mark Bell of the Maple Leafs hit him with a shoulder that left Alfredsson on the ice, unable to get up for several minutes. He missed the final game of the regular season and the beginning of the 2008 playoffs; he had played in every modern Senators playoff game up to that point. On 14 April 2008, with the Senators trailing 2–0 in their playoff series to the Pittsburgh Penguins, Alfredsson made his return in game three of the series, four weeks earlier than initially expected. He was welcomed with a lengthy standing ovation at Scotiabank Place. However, the Senators gave up four unanswered goals (three in the third period) to lose the game 4–1. The Senators lost game four 3–1. Afterwards, in an interview on CBC, he admitted that he had been playing with a ruptured medial collateral ligament (MCL).

In October 2008, Alfredsson underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee to remove a bone chip and returned less than a week later. On 30 October 2008, Alfredsson signed a new four-year contract with Ottawa worth  million. The contract, intended to allow Alfredsson to finish his playing career with the Senators, included a no-movement clause.

The 2008–09 season was a disappointing one for both Alfredsson and the Senators. The team failed to make the 2009 playoffs, and Alfredsson registered only 24 goals and 74 points in 79 games. On 8 July 2009, Alfredsson became the longest-serving active captain in the NHL, as former Montreal Canadiens captain Saku Koivu signed with the Anaheim Ducks and former Colorado Avalanche captain Joe Sakic announced his retirement.

The 2009–10 season saw Alfredsson&#x27;s point total dip again as he scored only 20 goals and had 71 points in 70 games. On 6 April, Alfredsson reached an important milestone, playing in his 1,000th regular season NHL game. Even though the Senators lost to Pittsburgh in the first round of the 2010 playoffs, Alfredsson still scored two goals and added six assists to lead the team in scoring (tied with Matt Cullen). He later admitted that he had been bothered by a sports hernia since February, which could explain his reduced effectiveness in the last weeks of the season and the playoffs.

During the 2010–11 season, Alfredsson recorded his 1,000th career NHL point in a victory over the Buffalo Sabres on 22 October 2010.

At season&#x27;s end, Alfredsson underwent back surgery and was released from hospital the same day. At a 14 June 2011 news conference introducing new Senators&#x27; head coach Paul MacLean, Alfredsson stated that the surgery went well and that he was moving around fine.

Alfredsson began the 2011–12 season healthy, but was diagnosed with a concussion for the first time in his career after receiving a blow to the head from New York Rangers forward Wojtek Wolski on 29 October 2011. He returned on 11 November after missing five games, in a game against the Buffalo Sabres. On 30 December 2011, against the Calgary Flames, Alfredsson scored his 400th career goal, the game winner in overtime. Alfredsson was chosen to represent the Senators again at the 2012 NHL All-Star Game held at Scotiabank Place in Ottawa. Alfredsson was captain of &quot;Team Alfredsson&quot;, scoring twice within one minute and 31 seconds in a 12–9 loss to &quot;Team Chara&quot;. Widely assumed to be a candidate to be moved to a Stanley Cup contender at the 2012 NHL trade deadline, Ottawa&#x27;s strong play resulted in Alfredsson not being placed on the trade market. &quot;I was just really happy we didn&#x27;t have to make that decision&quot;, said Alfredsson of the possibility of leaving Ottawa. In the first round of the 2012 playoffs, Alfredsson and the Senators were eliminated by the first-place New York Rangers in seven games. Speculation was rampant during early summer of 2012 that Alfredsson would announce his retirement, but on 31 July, he confirmed that he would be returning for his 17th season with the Senators.

The lockout-shortened 2012–13 season was a successful one for Alfredsson and the Senators. The team made the 2013 playoffs despite losing several key players to injury for extended periods, and defeated the rival Montreal Canadiens in the first round. Alfredsson was third in team scoring during the regular season with 10 goals and 16 assists in 47 games, and he led the Senators in scoring through the playoffs with 4 goals and 10 points in 10 games. At season&#x27;s end, there was again speculation that Alfredsson might announce his retirement. On 28 June 2013, Senators general manager Bryan Murray confirmed that he had been informed by agent J. P. Barry that Alfredsson &quot;is committed to play next year for the Senators&quot;. While Alfredsson negotiated a new contract with Ottawa, Boston Bruins&#x27; general manager Peter Chiarelli reached out to him in an attempt to gauge his interest in signing with Boston as the Bruins had just lost to the Presidents&#x27; Trophy-winning Chicago Blackhawks in six games in the 2013 Stanley Cup Finals. Chiarelli attempted to convince Alfredsson that Boston could be a good destination for an older player looking to win a Stanley Cup prior to retirement.
===Detroit Red Wings (2013–2014)===
On 5 July 2013, after 17 seasons with the Senators, Alfredsson signed a one-year, $5.5 million contract with the Detroit Red Wings. Alfredsson&#x27;s Ottawa teammates were taken aback by the news. Alfredsson phoned Chris Phillips so that he would not hear the news at the same time as everyone else; Phillips said he was shocked. Marc Methot said many teammates were caught off guard. &quot;We all were pretty adamant that he was going to return because he is grounded in this city (Ottawa) and so well-loved that everyone figured something would work out&quot;, said Methot. Ex-Senators&#x27; head coach Jacques Martin, at the time a hockey analyst on TVA Sports, compared Alfredsson&#x27;s departure to Ray Bourque&#x27;s decision to move to the Colorado Avalanche from the Boston Bruins to win a Stanley Cup. Alfredsson confirmed a day later that his decision to leave Ottawa was motivated by a desire to win a Stanley Cup prior to retirement. &quot;I had not won a Stanley Cup and that’s a big priority for me,&quot; Alfredsson said. He later explained that his departure from Ottawa was due to a contract impasse, though Senators&#x27; general manager Bryan Murray had expected Alfredsson to remain in Ottawa. Alfredsson returned to Ottawa for the first time with the Red Wings on 1 December 2013, and was greeted with a video tribute and loud cheers from the home crowd. He also scored an empty net goal in the Red Wings victory.

The 41-year-old recorded 18 goals and 49 points during his only season with the Red Wings during the 2013–14 season, tying for the team lead in scoring. Back problems kept Alfredsson from attending training camp and starting the 2014–15 season. On 27 November 2014, Alfredsson announced to Swedish press that he had retired as a player.

===Retirement===
On 4 December 2014, Alfredsson signed a one-day contract to officially retire as a member of the Ottawa Senators. Alfredsson took part in the pre-game warm-ups and took the ceremonial face-off as the Senators faced the New York Islanders, a game the Senators lost 2–1.

During Alfredsson&#x27;s career with the Senators, he played in 1,178 games, had 426 goals, 682 assists and 1,108 points, all franchise records. Chris Phillips broke Alfredsson&#x27;s games-played record two months later. On 29 December 2016, Alfredsson became the first player of the current Senators franchise to have his jersey number retired.

* 2014 Winter Olympics (alternate captain, silver medal)

At the 2006 Olympics, Alfredsson set personal highs in goals (5), assists (5) and points (10) and played on the second line with Mats Sundin and Henrik Zetterberg. After an injury to Peter Forsberg, Alfredsson took Forsberg&#x27;s spot as the alternate captain, along with Captain Sundin and defenseman Nicklas Lidström. Alfredsson was named captain of Sweden for the first time at the 2012 IIHF World Championship.

==Post-playing career==

=== Hockey operations career ===
After retiring as a player, Alfredsson joined the Ottawa Senators as senior advisor of hockey operations. Alfredsson and the Senators did not agree to a new contract in July 2017.

=== Coaching career ===

==== Ottawa Senators (2023–present) ====
On 13 October 2023 it was announced that Alfredsson had re-joined the Ottawa Senators organization in a player development coaching role. On 18 December 2023 the Ottawa Senators relieved head coach D. J. Smith of his duties and announced the appointment of Jacques Martin as head coach, and Alfredsson as assistant coach. Alfredsson made his coaching debut in a game on 19 December against the Arizona Coyotes. After interim coach Martin was replaced by the new permanent head coach, Travis Green, it was announced the Alfredsson would remain as part of Green&#x27;s staff.

==Personal life==
Alfredsson married long-time girlfriend Birgitta (née Backman) on 31 July 2004. They are the parents of four sons. The family resides in Ottawa and Särö, Sweden. Alfredsson&#x27;s parents are Hasse and Margareta Alfredsson.

Alfredsson&#x27;s younger brother Henric Alfredsson played with the Ontario Hockey League&#x27;s Ottawa 67&#x27;s as a 19-year-old during their 1999 Memorial Cup-winning season. Henric decided to stay in Ottawa after his junior hockey career with the 67&#x27;s was complete and now works for the Ottawa Police Service.

On 5 March 2015, Alfredsson was presented with the key to the city by Ottawa Deputy Mayor Bob Monette; Mayor Jim Watson was recuperating from a broken pelvis suffered in a snowmobiling accident and was unavailable. The key to the city is the city&#x27;s highest honour, reserved only for the people who make the greatest impact on Ottawa residents. The honour was in recognition not only of Alfredsson&#x27;s accomplishments with the Senators, but also for his off-ice leadership and advocacy with the Ottawa Senators Foundation, the Royal Ottawa Foundation for Mental Health and the Boys and Girls Club of Ottawa.

Alfredsson became a Canadian citizen at a special ceremony at the 2016 World Cup of Hockey on 20 September 2016.

<doc id="263047" wikidata="Q123896" url="?curid=263047" title="François-Alphonse Forel">
<text>François-Alphonse Forel (; 2 February 1841 – 7 August 1912) was a Swiss physician and scientist who pioneered the study of lakes, and is thus considered the founder, and the Father of limnology. Limnology is the study of bodies of fresh water and their biological, chemical, and physical features.

== Childhood and family ==
Forel was born in Morges, Switzerland on Lake Geneva. His father, François Marie Etienne Forel (1765-1865) was a well-respected historian and a jurist and was a strong influence in Forel&#x27;s life. From a young age, François-Alphonse Forel became involved in some of archaeological studies of his father&#x27;s colleagues. Several of Forel&#x27;s family members were also respected scholars and scientists.

== Education ==
Forel began his education at the Collège de Morges. Eventually, he left Morges for secondary school in Geneva at the Gymnase de Genève. There, he studied the natural sciences and medicine. Then he attended university at Académie de Genève where he obtained a Bachelor of Letters and a Bachelor of Physical and Natural Sciences. When he turned 18, he left his home country to attend the Académie de Montpellier in Montpellier, France. He studied at the university for two years and spent a portion of time after that, studying medicine on his own in Paris, France. Later, he moved to Germany and studied at the University of Würzburg. In the year 1865 when Forel was 24 year old, he obtained a doctorate degree in medicine and obstetrics.

== Work and professional life ==
Shortly after obtaining his doctoral decree, Forel returned to Lake Geneva in Switzerland. There, he began his own study of the lake which encompassed zootomy, physics, chemistry, biology, natural history, and even economics. In 1869, he became a science professor at the University of Lausanne (then known as the Academy of Lausanne) which was located near his home at Lake Geneva. He taught histology, anatomy, and physiology.

But his real love was the lake; his investigations of biology, chemistry, water circulation, and sedimentation, and most importantly their interactions, established the foundation of a new discipline. He named his activity &quot;limnology&quot; in analogy with oceanography (&quot;limnography&quot; could have been confused with the limnograph, which measures water level in lakes).

In his chief work, &quot;Le Léman&quot; was published in three volumes between 1892 and 1904. The volumes covered a range of topics including the definition of limnology, as well as the geographic settings, geology, climatology, hydrology and bathymetry of lake systems. The Monograph then went on to describe lacustrine hydraulics, seiches, waves and currents, temperature stratification, optics, acoustics and chemistry. This was cemented by his publication of a handbook on the topic. He discovered the phenomenon of density currents in lakes, and explained seiches, the rhythmic oscillations observed in enclosed waters.

He is also known for his work on the optical phenomenon the Fata Morgana which can be seen when looking out across Lake Geneva among other places.

In collaboration with Wilhelm Ule, developed the Forel-Ule scale, used to evaluate the color of a body of water. In a totally different field, in cooperation with the Italian seismologist Michele Stefano de Rossi, he developed the Rossi–Forel scale to describe the intensity of an earthquake.

== End of life and legacy ==

By the time of his death in 1912, he had amassed a total of 288 academic publications.

So wide was his knowledge that he was referred to as &quot;the Faraday of Lakes&quot; in his obituary in Nature Magazine. He was well regarded by the Scottish scientific community, visiting at least once, and also being elected as an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh.

The Institute F.-A. Forel of the University of Geneva is named after Forel.

Foreltinden, a mountain at Spitsbergen, Svalbard, is named after him.

Forel (station) in Maule, Chile is named after him after he lived close to the station.

The submersible F.-A. Forel (PX-28) is named after him and has been used to make scientific measurements in Lake Geneva.

<text>Jason Rocco Anthony Spezza (born June 13, 1983) is a Canadian former professional ice hockey centre and current assistant general manager of the Pittsburgh Penguins of the National Hockey League. Spezza played 19 career seasons in the NHL from 2002 to 2022.

After beginning his major junior career at the early age of 15 in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL), Spezza was selected second overall in the 2001 NHL Entry Draft by the Ottawa Senators, eventually serving as their team captain following the departure of Daniel Alfredsson. Playing in the American Hockey League (AHL) in 2004–05 due to the NHL lockout, he won the Les Cunningham Award as league MVP with the Binghamton Senators. In 2005–06, Spezza set an Ottawa Senators franchise record with 71 assists, while hitting the 90-point mark for the first of two times in his NHL career. He later played for the Dallas Stars and Toronto Maple Leafs. Following his retirement, he spent a year in the Maple Leafs&#x27; front office, before taking his current role with the Penguins.

Internationally, Spezza represented Canada at three World Junior Championships and two World Championships. When he made his World Junior debut in 2000, he became the third 16-year-old in history to make the team, after Wayne Gretzky and Eric Lindros.

==Early life==
Spezza was born on June 13, 1983, in Mississauga, Ontario. He was born to Italian parents Rino and Donna Spezza along with twin siblings Michelle and Matthew. Growing up in the Toronto area, he watched the Toronto Maple Leafs, but has cited Mario Lemieux as his favourite player as a child. Spezza attended St. Michael&#x27;s College School.

At age one, Spezza won a baby contest and began his youth modelling career. The victory resulted in Spezza becoming the poster boy for &quot;Baby&quot;, a Broadway musical that played at Toronto&#x27;s O&#x27;Keefe Centre in the summer of 1984. At age five, Spezza was chosen for a Minute Maid commercial. Two years later, he modelled clothing for stores Woolco and Kmart.

==Playing career==
===Junior===
Spezza played for the Toronto Marlboros in 1997, recording 114 points in 54 games. At age 15, Spezza began his major junior career in the Ontario Hockey League (OHL) with the Brampton Battalion in 1998–99, under a rule permitting the then-underage player to play on his hometown team. He scored at more than a point-per-game pace as an underaged player with 71 points in 67 games. He subsequently became the youngest player ever to participate in an OHL All-Star game at age 15. After one season with the Battalion, he was required to enter the OHL Priority Draft and was selected by the Mississauga IceDogs in the team&#x27;s second season in 1999–2000. He recorded 61 points in 52 games that season before requesting a trade and subsequently being dealt 15 games into the 2000–01 season to the Windsor Spitfires. Spezza went on to record an OHL career-high 116 points in 66 games that season.

Entering the 2001 NHL Entry Draft having been named the Top CHL Prospect, Spezza was drafted second overall by the Ottawa Senators, after Ilya Kovalchuk was selected by the Atlanta Thrashers. The second overall pick originally belonged to the New York Islanders but was traded to Ottawa (along with Zdeno Chára and Bill Muckalt) in exchange for Alexei Yashin on the day of the Draft. During the summer of 2001, Spezza passed on an invitation to the Canadian junior team&#x27;s summer camp because he said he wanted to prepare for his first NHL camp.

After one more OHL season split between the Spitfires and the Belleville Bulls, resulting in a 105-point season, Spezza began his professional career in the American Hockey League (AHL). He signed his first professional contract with the Senators, a multi-year deal, on September 5, 2001.

===Professional===
====Ottawa Senators (2002–2014)====

Following Spezza&#x27;s fourth OHL season in 2001–02, he was assigned to the Senators&#x27; AHL affiliate the Grand Rapids Griffins for the 2002 Calder Cup playoffs, where he made his professional debut, playing in three playoff games and scoring one goal. He made his NHL debut the next season in 2002–03 with Ottawa, playing in 33 games and recording 21 points, and scored his first NHL goal on October 29, 2002, in a 2–1 loss against the Philadelphia Flyers. However, he played the majority of the season in the AHL with Ottawa&#x27;s new affiliate, the Binghamton Senators, and was called-up regularly to replace injured Ottawa players. He also competed in three Stanley Cup playoff games with Ottawa during his rookie season, helping the team in its 2003 playoff run to the Eastern Conference Finals. In his playoff debut on May 21, 2003, Spezza assisted on the game-winning goal in Game 3. The Senators came within one game of the Stanley Cup Finals, losing to the eventual Stanley Cup champion New Jersey Devils.

Spezza played his first full NHL season with the Senators in 2003–04 and scored 22 goals and 55 points in 78 games. However, due to the subsequent NHL lockout, Spezza returned to the AHL in 2004–05. Scoring 117 points with Binghamton, he outscored Michael Cammalleri of the Manchester Monarchs by eight points to capture the John B. Sollenberger Trophy as the league&#x27;s leading scorer. Spezza was also awarded the Les Cunningham Award as league MVP.

With NHL play set to resume in 2005–06, Spezza returned to Ottawa. Having traded centres Radek Bonk and Todd White during the off-season, the Senators started Spezza on the first line between Dany Heatley and rookie Brandon Bochenski, who was Spezza&#x27;s linemate in Binghamton. Captain Daniel Alfredsson quickly replaced Bochenski on the top line (Bochenski was soon thereafter traded) and the new trio become nicknamed the &quot;CASH&quot; line and &quot;Pizza&quot; line. Wingers Alfredsson and Heatley both finished tied for fourth in league scoring with 103 points, while Spezza tallied 90 points despite an injury-shortened 68-game season. His 71 assists established a team single-season record and was second in the league behind Joe Thornton of the San Jose Sharks (96 assists). In the 2006 playoffs, the Senators defeated the Tampa Bay Lightning in the first round, but fell to the Buffalo Sabres in five games. Spezza added 14 points in 10 playoff games.

During the summer of 2006, Spezza underwent successful back surgery. The following season, he continued on the same pace with Heatley and Alfredsson before suffering another injury. He managed a career-high 34 goals and finished with 87 points in 67 games. On May 19, 2007, he scored a goal and an assist as the Senators defeated the Buffalo Sabres in the Eastern Conference Final four games to one. Ottawa moved to the Stanley Cup Finals against the Anaheim Ducks, but lost in five games in large part because the Spezza–Heatley–Alfredsson line failed to perform against Samuel Påhlsson&#x27;s checking line, backed by star defencemen Scott Niedermayer and Chris Pronger. Spezza finished the 2007 playoffs with a franchise-record 22 points, tied with linemates Alfredsson and Heatley.

Beginning the 2007–08 season in the final year of his contract, on November 2, 2007, Spezza signed a new seven-year, $49 million contract with the Senators effective from the 2008–09 season through to the 2014–15 season. Late that season, on February 9, 2008, Spezza scored his first NHL hat-trick during a 6–1 Senators victory over the Montreal Canadiens. Spezza contributed to all of his team&#x27;s goals for a career-high six-point game. He finished the season tying his career-high in goals with 34 and establishing a new personal mark for points with 92. However, the Senators failed to advance past the first round following their Stanley Cup run the previous season, falling to the Pittsburgh Penguins in four games.

The 2008–09 season was a disappointing one for both Spezza and the Senators. Though he managed to remain injury-free and played in all of his team&#x27;s 82 games for the first time in his NHL career, his point production decreased. Spezza managed 73 points in 82 games, and while still respectable, the numbers were his lowest totals since his first full NHL season in 2003–04. The team struggled all season long and would miss the playoffs for the first time since 1995–96.

Despite missing 22 games due to injury in the 2009–10 season, Spezza still managed to score 23 goals and pick-up 34 assists for 57 points in 60 games to finish second on the team in scoring. In the first round of the 2010 playoffs, the Senators lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins four games to two. Spezza finished with one goal and six assists for seven points in the six games. He also led the team in shots on goal with 24. However, Spezza&#x27;s poor defensive play and costly turnovers in that series resulted in him being booed by fans at Scotiabank Place, and the following off-season was rife with speculation that he would be traded. Spezza himself admitted that he would not object to a trade from Ottawa. Ultimately, no trade occurred.

On December 26, 2010, in a 3–1 win over the Pittsburgh Penguins, Spezza was checked from behind into the boards by Penguins defenceman Kris Letang. Letang received a two-minute penalty for boarding and Spezza was expected to miss four-to-six weeks due to a consequent shoulder injury.

At the end of the 2010–11 season, Spezza was named an interim alternate captain for Ottawa after the team traded away Mike Fisher. In 2011–12, Spezza was named as a permanent alternate captain for the Senators. He remained injury-free and finished fourth in league scoring, earning consideration for the Hart Memorial Trophy. Spezza was ultimately not a finalist for the award, finishing sixth in voting.

Spezza spent time with Rapperswil-Jona Lakers of the Swiss National League A during the 2012–13 NHL lockout and returned to the Senators once a resolution had been negotiated. He registered two goals and three assists in five games before a back injury sidelined him. The Senators announced on January 31, 2013, that Spezza would be out of the Ottawa line-up for a minimum of two months (and possibly longer) as he required surgery for a herniated disc in his back. The injury occurred in a game against the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 27. Spezza ultimately missed the remainder of the regular season and the first round of the 2013 playoffs. He returned to action on May 19, 2013, for the third game of Ottawa&#x27;s Eastern Conference Semi-final series against Pittsburgh.

On September 14, 2013, Spezza was named the eighth captain in Senators&#x27; franchise history, replacing long-time teammate Daniel Alfredsson, who joined the Detroit Red Wings as a free agent on July 5, 2013.

After the conclusion of his first season as the Senators captain in 2013–14, it was revealed by Senators general manager Bryan Murray that Spezza had requested a trade from the Senators. At the 2014 NHL Entry Draft, a potential trade to the Nashville Predators was negotiated by Murray but rejected by Spezza as the Predators were one of the teams listed in his limited contractual no-trade clause.

====Dallas Stars (2014–2019)====

On July 1, 2014, Spezza was traded to the Dallas Stars (along with Ludwig Karlsson) in exchange for Alex Chiasson, Alex Guptill, Nick Paul and a second-round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft. On November 21, Spezza signed a four-year contract with Dallas (effective from the 2015–16 season through to the 2018–19 season) worth an annual average value of $7.5 million. He recorded 17 goals, 45 assists and 62 points in all 82 games in his first season with the Stars, as they missed the 2015 playoffs.

His offensive production improved the following season, scoring 33 goals, 30 assist and 63 points in 75 games as the Stars qualified for the 2016 playoffs as the top seed in the Western Conference. Spezza and the Stars would defeat the Minnesota Wild in six games in round 1 and then lose to the St.Louis Blues in seven games.

Spezza recorded 15 goals, 35 assists and 50 points in 68 games during the 2016-17 NHL season as the Stats as a team would struggle with injuries to players across the roster and miss the playoffs by 15 points.

In 2017-18, Speeza played 78 games with 8 goals and 18 assists and the Stars improved drastically as a team, missing the playoffs by just 3 points.

On October 30, 2018, in a 4–1 win over the Montreal Canadiens, Spezza played in his 1,000th career NHL game. He finished the 2018-19 NHL season with 8 goals, 18 assists and 27 points in 76 games and the Stars got back into a playoff spot for the first time in 3 years. In the 2019 playoffs he played 11 games with 3 goals and 2 assists with Spezza upsetting the Nashville Predators in the first round in six games before getting defeated by the St. Louis Blues in the second round in seven games like 2016.

====Toronto Maple Leafs (2019–2022)====
On July 1, 2019, as a free agent, Spezza signed a one-year, $700,000 contract for the 2019–20 season with the Toronto Maple Leafs, the team he supported as a child. On signing, Spezza said, &quot;Just to have a chance to put on a Leaf jersey is going to be pretty special for me.&quot; However, Spezza was scratched for Toronto&#x27;s opening night game against his former team, the Ottawa Senators, in a highly criticized move by Toronto&#x27;s head coach Mike Babcock. Spezza made his debut with the Maple Leafs in the following game on October 5, against the Columbus Blue Jackets.

On October 5, 2020, Spezza signed a one-year, $700,000 extension with the Maple Leafs.

On January 17, 2021, the Maple Leafs placed Spezza on waivers after 3 games for salary cap reasons. Spezza&#x27;s agent indicated that Spezza would retire if claimed by another team. Ultimately, he went unclaimed and cleared waivers to remain with the Maple Leafs. Two and a half weeks later, Spezza would go on to record his eighth and final career hat trick in a 7–3 victory over the Vancouver Canucks on February 4.

On June 16, 2021, Spezza re-signed with the Maple Leafs to a one-year contract extension worth league minimum again, $750,000. Spezza&#x27;s deal was seen as another hometown discount for the salary cap strapped club, stating &quot;if I could take less, I would&quot; to help the team win. Spezza continued his strong play in a depth role before being suspended six games on December 8 for a hit to the head of Winnipeg Jets defender Neal Pionk that occurred three days prior after Pionk injured teammate Rasmus Sandin with a knee-on-knee hit. Spezza, who had a reputation as a clean player that had never been suspended or fined once in his 19 seasons in the NHL appealed the decision, with NHL commissioner Gary Bettman reducing the suspension to four games on December 17.
Following the Leafs&#x27; elimination in the first round of the 2022 Stanley Cup playoffs by the Tampa Bay Lightning, Spezza announced his retirement after 19 seasons in the NHL. Spezza retired with 995 career NHL points, the most of any player who never hit 1,000. The Maple Leafs offered him a new position as special assistant to general manager Kyle Dubas, which Spezza accepted, saying he was &quot;very grateful to the Leafs for the amazing opportunity to transition into this new role. It enables me to continue to follow my passion; learn and live new experiences within the game I love.&quot; Spezza&#x27;s loyalty to his hometown Maple Leafs factored into his decision, stating that he believed that it was best for the on-ice product for him to retire and open opportunity for young offensive players.

==International play==





As a junior, Spezza represented Canada&#x27;s national junior team three consecutive years. He made his debut at the 2000 World Junior Championships, becoming just the third 16-year-old to make the team in Team Canada history, after Wayne Gretzky and Eric Lindros (this feat was also accomplished the same year by defenceman Jay Bouwmeester and Sidney Crosby in 2004). Spezza contributed 2 assists in 7 games as Canada captured a bronze medal. He returned in 2001 for a second consecutive bronze medal, while improving to three goals and three assists. Spezza made it to the gold medal game with Canada in his third and final World Junior appearance in 2002, but lost to Russia to earn the silver.

As a member of the Senators, Spezza was made a reserve for Canada at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, but did not play. He would make his men&#x27;s debut for Canada at the 2008 World Championships, being named to the team along with Senators linemate Dany Heatley. He earned a silver medal, losing to Russia in the gold-medal game. With the Senators failing to make the NHL playoffs the following year, Spezza again represented Canada at the 2009 World Championships. He won another silver medal, losing to Russia in the gold medal game for the second consecutive year. Spezza, along with Finland&#x27;s Niko Kapanen and fellow Canadian Steven Stamkos, finished the tournament tied for first in goals scored with seven.

Despite his success with the national team in the two previous World Championships, as well as being named a reserve for the 2006 Olympic team, Spezza was left off Canada&#x27;s initial summer camp roster in preparation for the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. However, after veteran Joe Sakic announced his retirement and Ryan Getzlaf declared that he required more time to recover from injury, Spezza was invited to fill in one of the vacant spots.

As the 2012–13 NHL lockout continued, Spezza was named to Canada&#x27;s roster for the 2012 Spengler Cup held in Davos, Switzerland. Spezza joined fellow NHL stars John Tavares, Tyler Seguin, Patrice Bergeron, Ryan Smyth, and Matt Duchene in the Canadian line-up, helping Canada defeat host team HC Davos to capture its first Spengler Cup title since 2007.

At the 2015 World Championships, where Canada won the gold medal for the first time since 2007 with a perfect 10–0 record, Spezza was named best forward and a member of the all-star team; he was the tournament&#x27;s leading scorer.

== Executive career ==
For the 2022–23 Toronto Maple Leafs season, Spezza was hired as special assistant to the general manager, Kyle Dubas. Spezza resigned from his position with the Maple Leafs on May 19, 2023, following Leafs president Brendan Shanahan&#x27;s decision to remove Dubas as general manager.

Shortly afterward, Dubas was hired by the Pittsburgh Penguins as president of hockey operations. On June 14, 2023, Spezza joined that organization as an assistant general manager.

==Off the ice==
===Community programs===
Spezza participates in numerous activities outside of hockey, especially the &quot;Spelling with Spezza&quot; program. Winners received a poster of Spezza and a pair of tickets to an Ottawa Senators&#x27; home game. The program recognizes the importance of spelling. Spezza visited selected classes registered for the program. In his last season with the Senators, over 600 classes in the Ottawa-Gatineau area participated in Spelling with Spezza. He also contributes to Ronald McDonald House Charities.

===Personal life===
Spezza wed his girlfriend, Jennifer Snell, in Ottawa on July 25, 2009. The ceremony took place at Notre Dame Cathedral Basilica and the reception was held across the street at the National Gallery of Canada. Many of his then-current and past teammates were in attendance, including Ray Emery, Antoine Vermette, Brendan Bell, Chris Phillips and Chris Neil, as well as Senators owner Eugene Melnyk.

The couple have four daughters. Spezza and his family resided in the west-end of Ottawa during his tenure with the Senators, but sold the home when he was traded to Dallas.

Spezza&#x27;s younger brother Matthew was a goaltender who last played for the Flint Generals of the International Hockey League (IHL). He died of an accidental drug overdose in 2024 at the age of 37.

===Endorsements===
Spezza was on the cover of the &quot;NHL 2K8&quot; video game for the PlayStation 2, PlayStation 3, Xbox and the Xbox 360 video game consoles.

<text>FHM (For Him Magazine) was a printed British multinational men&#x27;s lifestyle magazine that was published in several countries. It contained features such as the &quot;FHM&quot; 100 Sexiest Women in the World.

The final printed issue of British &quot;FHM&quot; was produced in December 2015, after which the magazine moved to a digital-only platform, with updated daily content on topics such as dating tips, style advice, viral news, sports and entertainment.

==History==
The magazine began publication in 1985 in the UK under the name &quot;For Him Magazine&quot; and changed its title to FHM in May 1992, although the full &quot;For Him Magazine&quot; continued to be printed on the spine of each issue. The first woman to appear on the cover was Gina Bellman in February 1993. The trend towards female cover stars grew over the following year, with both Naomi Campbell and Andie MacDowell appearing.

Circulation expanded to newsagents as a quarterly by the spring of 1987 and then monthly in 1994. EMAP Consumer Media bought the magazine in 1994 and it subsequently went on to dominate the UK men&#x27;s market and began to expand internationally, being published in 32 countries including India. 

FHM&#x27;s High Street Honey competition (2002—) awards £10,000, an FHM TV presenting job and the chance to appear on the FHM front cover.&lt;ref name=&quot;independent/5348723&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2015, British &quot;FHM&quot; announced their intention to suspend publication alongside that of fellow men&#x27;s magazine &quot;Zoo,&quot; leaving the publication available via its website at FHM.com.

The final print edition appeared in February 2016, with &quot;Holly Willoughby&quot; as its cover model.

In August 2016, under the guidance of BauerXcel Media, a property of Bauer Media Group, Nick Dimengo took over as the senior editor of FHM.com.

==&quot;FHM&quot; 100 Sexiest Women in the World==
Each of &quot;FHM&quot;″s international editions publish yearly rankings for the sexiest women alive based on public and editorial voting through the magazine&#x27;s website. Dates of magazine issues, winners, ages of winners at the time of selection, and pertinent comments are listed below. The data below refer &quot;only&quot; to the British edition (the rankings for the international editions vary widely, with many top-ranking women in some editions not appearing at all in others).

==&quot;FHM&quot; international==
&quot;FHM&quot; was published in the following territories.

<text>The Baltimore Sun is the largest general-circulation daily newspaper based in the U.S. state of Maryland and provides coverage of local, regional, national, and international news.

Founded in 1837, the newspaper was owned by Tribune Publishing until May 2021, when it was acquired by Alden Global Capital, which operates its media properties through Digital First Media. David D. Smith, the executive chairman of Sinclair Broadcast Group, closed a deal to buy the paper on January 15, 2024.

==History==
===19th century===
&quot;The Sun&quot; was founded on May 17, 1837, by Arunah Shepherdson Abell and two associates, William Moseley Swain from Rhode Island, and Azariah H. Simmons from Philadelphia, where they had started and published the &quot;Public Ledger&quot; the year before.

Abell became a journalist with the &quot;Providence Patriot&quot; and later worked with newspapers in New York City and Boston.

===20th century===
The Abell family and descendants owned &quot;The Sun&quot; until 1910, when the local Black and Garrett families invested in the paper at the suggestion of former rival owner/publisher of &quot;The News&quot;, Charles H. Grasty, and they, along with Grasty gained a controlling interest; they retained the name A. S. Abell Company for the parent publishing company. That same year The Evening Sun was established under reporter, editor and columnist H.L. Mencken (1880–1956).

From 1947 to 1986, &quot;The Sun&quot; was the owner and founder of Maryland&#x27;s first television station, WMAR-TV (channel 2), which was a longtime affiliate of CBS until 1981, when it switched to NBC. The station was sold off in 1986, and is now owned by the E. W. Scripps Company, and has been an ABC affiliate since 1995. A. S. Abell also owned several radio stations, but not in Baltimore itself (holding construction permits for WMAR sister AM/FM stations, but never bringing them to air).

The newspaper opened its first foreign bureau in London in 1924. Between 1955 and 1961, it added four new foreign offices.

As Cold War tensions grew, it set up shop in Bonn, West Germany, in February 1955; the bureau was later moved to Berlin. Eleven months later, &quot;The Sun&quot; was one of the first U.S. newspapers to open a bureau in Moscow. A Rome office followed in July 1957, and a New Delhi bureau was opened four years later, in 1961 . At its height, &quot;The Sun&quot; ran eight foreign bureaus, giving rise to its boast in a 1983 advertisement that &quot;The Sun never sets on the world.&quot;

The paper was sold by Reg Murphy in 1986 to the Times-Mirror Company of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;.

The same week, a 115-year-old rivalry ended when the oldest newspaper in the city, the &quot;News American&quot;, a Hearst paper since the 1920s with roots dating back to 1773, folded. A decade later in 1997, &quot;The Sun&quot; acquired the Patuxent Publishing Company, a local suburban newspaper publisher that had a stable of 15 weekly papers and a few magazines in several communities and counties.

In the 1990s and 2000s, &quot;The Sun&quot; began cutting back its foreign coverage. In 1995 and 1996, the paper closed its Tokyo, Mexico City and Berlin bureaus. Two more—Beijing and London—fell victim to cost-cutting in 2005. The final three foreign bureaus—Moscow, Jerusalem, and Johannesburg, South Africa—fell a couple of years later. All were closed by 2008, as the Tribune Co. streamlined and downsized the newspaper chain&#x27;s foreign reporting. Some material from &quot;The Sun&quot;″s foreign correspondents is archived at the University of Maryland, Baltimore County.

===21st century===
In the 21st century, &quot;The Sun&quot;, like most legacy newspapers in the United States, has suffered a number of setbacks in the competition with Internet and other sources, including a decline in readership and ads, a shrinking newsroom staff, and competition from 2005 to 2007 with the free daily &quot;The Baltimore Examiner&quot;, along with a similar Washington, D.C.–based publication of a small chain recently started by new owners that took over the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. In 2000, the Times-Mirror company was purchased by the Tribune Company of Chicago. In 2014, it transferred its newspapers, including &quot;The Sun&quot;, to Tribune Publishing.

The &quot;Sun&quot; introduced a new layout design in September 2005, and again in August 2008. By 2010 daily circulation had fallen to 195,561 and 343,552 for the Sunday edition. On April 29, 2009, the Tribune Company announced the lay off of 61 of the 205 staff members in the &quot;Sun&quot; newsroom. On September 23, 2011, it was reported that the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; would be moving its web edition behind a paywall starting October 10, 2011.

&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; is the flagship of the Baltimore Sun Media Group, which also produces the &quot;b&quot; free daily newspaper and more than 30 other Baltimore metropolitan-area community newspapers, magazines and Web sites. BSMG content reaches more than one million Baltimore-area readers each week and is the region&#x27;s most widely read source of news.

On February 20, 2014, The Baltimore Sun Media Group announced that they would buy the alternative weekly &quot;City Paper&quot;. In April, the Sun acquired the Maryland publications of Landmark Media Enterprises.

In February 2021, as part of the planned merger between Tribune Publishing and Alden Global Capital, Tribune announced that Alden had reached a non-binding agreement to sell The Sun to the Sunlight For All Institute, a nonprofit backed by businessman and philanthropist Stewart W. Bainum Jr. The deal was contingent on approval by Tribune shareholders of the merger deal. It fell apart in talks over operating agreements with Tribune for functions including human resources and customer service. Bainum then led a failed bid to acquire all of Tribune Publishing. Bainum subsequently founded &quot;The Baltimore Banner&quot;, pledging $50 million to the nonprofit outlet.

In February 2022, the editorial board of &quot;The Sun&quot; published a lengthy apology for its racism over its 185–year history, including specific offenses such as accepting classified ads for selling enslaved people and publishing editorials that promoted racial segregation and disenfranchisement of Black voters.

====Acquisition by David Smith====
In January 2024, David D. Smith, executive chairman of Sinclair Broadcast Group, reached an agreement to acquire the paper, with conservative commentator Armstrong Williams holding an undisclosed stake. Though the transaction was independent of Sinclair, Smith said he foresaw partnerships between the paper and Sinclair properties like its flagship station, Fox affiliate WBFF-TV (channel 45). Smith said he believed he could grow subscriptions and advertising through a greater focus on community news and integrating technology in ways other print media publishers are not going. In his first visit to the newsroom, he sparred with reporters and said the paper should emulate WBFF&#x27;s news philosophy, including through non-scientific reader polls and aggressive coverage of Baltimore City Public Schools. He dismissed newsroom concerns about the future of public service journalism. Current and recently departed &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reporters told the Neiman Foundation for Journalism in November 2024 that in the months since Smith&#x27;s purchase, he has continued to tell journalists that he doesn&#x27;t read stories published in their paper beyond just the headline, and has neither pitched specific stories nor openly criticized the paper&#x27;s coverage of stories. In December 2024, Smith told &quot;Sun&quot; photographer Amy Davis that he had begun reading &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;.

Since Smith&#x27;s acquisition of &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, the paper has become more conservative, and has published more stories on Baltimore mayor Brandon Scott and his administration, as well as crime in Baltimore. The paper has also republished content from WBFF, also owned by Smith, the conservative news wire The Center Square, columns written by Smith&#x27;s daughter, and features on new restaurants opened by Atlas Restaurant Group, which is owned by Smith&#x27;s nephew. Journalists that worked for &quot;The Sun&quot; before its acquisition also began to leave the company, with many citing concerns they held over the way stories about juvenile crime and city government in Baltimore were written, and other reporters leaving to work for &quot;The Baltimore Banner&quot;.

Williams said the paper&#x27;s editorial page would cease endorsing political candidates and start including more conservative viewpoints, but not at the expense of liberal ones. He said at the time that the newspaper may run his syndicated column &quot;on its merits.&quot; The paper&#x27;s opinion page now regularly publishes Wiliiams&#x27; columns and video commentaries. In June 2024, &quot;The Sun&quot; began republishing content from channel 45&#x27;s website, provoking protests from staffers and the Baltimore Sun Guild, which released a statement expressing concern with the lack of transparency at the paper on the relationship between The Baltimore Sun, Fox45 and other Sinclair newsrooms, and criticizing language used in the station&#x27;s articles and Williams&#x27; editorial articles, particularly toward immigrants and transgender people.

In June 2024, longtime managing editor Sam Davis announced he would retire at the end of the month. Opinion editor Tricia Bishop, who has worked for the newspaper since 1999, would succeed him, with Davis staying on for a few months as a consultant for &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;″s owners.

On June 10, 2024, the Baltimore Sun Guild raised concern with what it said were ethical breaches committed by management since the takeover, including the use of Fox 45&#x27;s content and Williams columns that did not meet &quot;Sun&quot; editorial standards. This included language used to describe immigrants and transgender people. The guild demanded the &quot;Sun&quot; stop republishing WBFF-TV content and asked management to meet with staff to discuss their concerns. Williams said in a statement he respected the guild&#x27;s opinion but hoped the union &quot;reciprocally appreciates legitimate managerial prerogatives in the journalistic enterprise&quot;. In a subsequent &quot;Sun&quot; column, Williams wrote the guild and the Associated Press had no inherent authority to prescribe the way in which language is used. Despite this, the wording used to describe immigrants in one republished Fox 45 story was eventually changed.

The Baltimore Sun Guild has also raised concerns with the new ownership&#x27;s efforts to stall contract negotiations with the paper&#x27;s unionized reporters, with some employees handing out fliers at restaurants owned by David Smith&#x27;s nephew, Alex, calling Smith a &quot;union buster&quot;. Smith denied these accusations, telling &quot;Sun&quot; photographer Amy Davis that he had multiple union employees across the country and that he&#x27;d been negotiating with unions for fifty years, despite employee testimony that Smith threatened to shut down WBFF-TV after its employees started talking about forming a union. Smith also dismissed Davis&#x27;s concerns that management was proposing union-busting clauses in negotiations, including the ability to terminate employees without just cause, saying, &quot;Nobody does that. There are laws to protect people from that&quot;.

Following the &quot;Sun&quot;″s acquisition, one of its arts reporters asked Smith if she should look for a new job amid his acquisition. Smith avoided the reporter&#x27;s question, instead going on a long rant about how he is an artist, a &quot;world-class furniture builder&quot;, and a photographer. In October 2024, the newspaper eliminated its features desk and reassigned its three reporters to news departments. The guild said in a statement that it would be the first time since 1888 that the paper would be without coverage of the city&#x27;s cultural life.

==Editions==
From 1910 to 1995 there were two distinct newspapers, &quot;The Sun&quot;, which was published in the morning, and &quot;The Evening Sun&quot;, which was published in the afternoon. Each newspaper maintained separate reporting and editorial staff.

&quot;The Evening Sun&quot; was first published in 1910 under the leadership of Charles H. Grasty, former owner of the &quot;Evening News&quot;, and a firm believer in the evening circulation. For most of its existence, &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; led its morning sibling in circulation. In 1959, the afternoon edition&#x27;s circulation was 220,174, compared to 196,675 for the morning edition. However, by the 1980s, cultural, technological and economic shifts in America were eating away at afternoon newspapers&#x27; market share, with readers flocking to either morning papers or switching to nightly television news broadcasts. In 1992, the afternoon paper&#x27;s circulation was 133,800. By mid-1995, &quot;The Evening Sun&quot;″s readership—86,360—had been eclipsed by that of &quot;The Sun&quot;—264,583. &quot;The Evening Sun&quot; ceased publication on September 15, 1995.

===Daily===
After a period of roughly a year during which the paper&#x27;s owners sometimes printed a two-section product, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; now has three sections every weekday: News, Sports and alternating various business and features sections. On some days, comics and such features as the horoscope and TV listings are printed in the back of the Sports section.

After dropping the standalone business section in 2009, &quot;The Sun&quot; brought back a business section on Tuesdays and Sundays in 2010, with business pages occupying part of the news section on other days. Features sections debuting in 2010 included a Saturday &quot;Home&quot; section, a Thursday &quot;Style&quot; section and a Monday section called &quot;Sunrise.&quot; The sports article written by Peter Schmuck is published only on weekdays.

===Sunday===
The &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; for many years was noted for a locally produced rotogravure Maryland pictorial magazine section, featuring works by such acclaimed photographers as A. Aubrey Bodine. The &quot;Sunday Sun&quot; dropped the Sunday &quot;Sun Magazine&quot; in 1996 and now only carries &quot;Parade&quot; magazine weekly. A quarterly version of the &quot;Sun Magazine&quot; was resurrected in September 2010, with stories that included a comparison of young local doctors, an interview with actress Julie Bowen and a feature on the homes of a former Baltimore anchorwoman. Newsroom managers plan to add online content on a more frequent basis.

===baltimoresun.com===
The company introduced its website in September 1996. A redesign of the site was unveiled in June 2009, capping a six-month period of record online traffic. Each month from January through June, an average of 3.5 million unique visitors combined to view 36.6 million web pages. &quot;Sun&quot; reporters and editors produce more than three dozen blogs on such subjects as technology, weather, education, politics, Baltimore crime, real estate, gardening, pets and parenting. Among the most popular are Dining@Large, which covers local restaurants; The Schmuck Stops Here, a Baltimore-centric sports blog written by Peter Schmuck; Z on TV, by media critic David Zurawik; and Midnight Sun, a nightlife blog. A &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; iPhone app was released on September 14, 2010.

===&quot;b&quot;===
In 2008, the Baltimore Sun Media Group launched the daily paper &quot;b&quot; to target younger and more casual readers, ages 18 to 35. It was in tabloid format, with large graphics, creative design, and humor in focusing on entertainment, news, and sports. Its companion website was bthesite.com. The paper transitioned from daily to weekly publication in 2011.

&quot;b&quot; ceased publication entirely in August 2015, more than a year after the Baltimore Sun Media Group acquired &quot;City Paper&quot;.

==Contributors==
&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; has won 16 Pulitzer Prizes. It also has been home to many notable journalists, reporters and essayists, including H.L. Mencken, who had a forty-plus-year association with the paper.

==Facilities==
The first issue of &quot;The Sun&quot;, a four-page tabloid, was printed at 21 Light Street in downtown Baltimore in the mid-1830s.

In 1851, the newspaper moved to a five-story structure at the corner of Baltimore and South streets. In 1904, in the Great Baltimore Fire, the structure, known as the &quot;Iron Building&quot;, was destroyed.

In 1885, &quot;The Sun&quot; constructed a building for its Washington, D.C. bureau at 1317 F Street, NW, in Washington, D.C. The building is on the National Register.

In 1906, operations were moved to Charles and Baltimore streets, where &quot;The Sun&quot; was written, published, and distributed for nearly 50 years. In 1950, operations were moved to a larger, modern plant at Calvert and Centre streets. In 1979, ground was broken for a new addition to the Calvert Street plant to house modern pressroom facilities. This facility commenced operations in 1981.

In April 1988, at a cost of $180 million, the company purchased of land at Port Covington and built &quot;Sun Park&quot;. The new building houses a satellite printing and packaging facility, and also is the newspaper&#x27;s headquarters for its distribution operations. &quot;The Sun&quot;″s printing facility at Sun Park has highly sophisticated computerized presses and automated insertion equipment in the packaging area. To keep pace with the speed of the presses and automated guided vehicles, intelligent electronic forklifts deliver the newsprint to the presses.

On January 30, 2022, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; newspaper was printed for the last time at its Sun Park facility. It was reported that &quot;The Sun&#x27;s&quot; printing operations would be moved to a printing facility in Wilmington, Delaware.

In December 2022, the &quot;Sun&quot; announced an agreement to move its offices to 200 St. Paul Place in downtown Baltimore, abandoning Sun Park altogether. After &quot;The Sun&quot;″s purchase in 2024, its new owners signaled plans to move the newsroom to the Bagby Building at 509 S. Exeter St. in Little Italy, farther away from city offices and courts. Business and advertising staffers would move to the new office over the next year.

==Controversies==
* The paper became embroiled in a controversy involving the former governor of Maryland, Robert L. Ehrlich Jr. (R). Ehrlich had issued an executive order on November 18, 2004, banning state executive branch employees from talking to &quot;Sun&quot; columnist Michael Olesker and reporter David Nitkin, claiming that their coverage had been unfair to the administration. This led &quot;The Sun&quot; to file a First Amendment lawsuit against the Ehrlich administration. The case was dismissed by a U.S. District Court judge, and &quot;The Sun&quot; appealed to the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals, which upheld the dismissal.
* Olesker was later forced to resign on January 4, 2006, in a separate incident in which he was accused of plagiarism. The &quot;Baltimore City Paper&quot; reported that several of his columns contained sentences or paragraphs that were extremely similar (although not identical) to material previously published in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;The Sun&quot;. Several of his colleagues were highly critical of the forced resignation, taking the view that the use of previously published boilerplate material was common newsroom practice, and that Olesker&#x27;s alleged plagiarism was in line with that practice.
* Between 2006 and 2007, Thomas Andrews Drake, a former National Security Agency executive, allegedly leaked classified information to Siobhan Gorman, then a national security reporter for &quot;The Sun&quot;. Drake was charged in April 2010 with 10 felony counts in relation to the leaks. In June 2011, all 10 original charges were dropped, in what was widely viewed as an acknowledgement that the government had no valid case against the whistleblower, who eventually pleaded to one misdemeanor count for exceeding authorized use of a computer. Drake was the 2011 recipient of the Ridenhour Prize for Truth-Telling.
* In 2018, in response to the European cookie law, the parent company of &quot;The Sun&quot; did not enable permission-requesting software, and many European visitors (and those from some non-European countries) were forced to visit the site via proxies, potentially muddling the website&#x27;s analytics.
* On September 10, 2024, the &quot;Sun&quot; dismissed reporter Maddi O&#x27;Neill for raising questions on the newsroom&#x27;s internal Slack channel about journalistic standards under that year&#x27;s new ownership. O&#x27;Neill, a legal reporter who joined the paper that same year from &quot;The Daily Record&quot;, was still in her nine-month probationary period and thus could be fired without cause. In a statement, the Baltimore Sun Guild called the firing a &quot;cowardly&quot; decision emblematic of &quot;mismanagement&quot; by the paper&#x27;s new owners. The union later filed a federal complaint, saying O&#x27;Neill was fired for engaging in protected concerted activity.

==Portrayal in &quot;The Wire&quot;==
&quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; was featured in the American crime drama television series &quot;The Wire&quot; in 2008 (season 5), which was created by former &quot;Sun&quot; reporter David Simon.

Like all of the institutions featured in &quot;The Wire&quot;, the &quot;Sun&quot; is portrayed as having many deeply dysfunctional qualities while also having very dedicated people on its staff. The season focuses on the role of the media in affecting political decisions in City Hall and the priorities of the Baltimore Police Department. Additionally, the show explores the business pressures of modern media through layoffs and buyouts occurring at the &quot;Sun&quot;, on the orders of the Tribune Company, the &quot;Sun&quot;″s corporate owner.

One storyline involves a troubled &quot;Sun&quot; reporter named Scott Templeton, and his escalating tendency to sensationalize and falsify stories. &quot;The Wire&quot; portrays the managing editors of the &quot;Sun&quot; as turning a blind eye to the protests of a concerned line editor, in the managing editors&#x27; zeal to win a Pulitzer Prize. The show insinuates that the motivation for this institutional dysfunction is the business pressures of modern media, and working for a flagship newspaper in a major media market like &quot;The New York Times&quot; or &quot;The Washington Post&quot; is seen as the only way to avoid the cutbacks occurring at the &quot;Sun&quot;.

Season 5 was &quot;The Wire&quot;″s last. The finale episode, &quot;-30-&quot;, features a montage at the end portraying the ultimate fate of the major characters. It shows Templeton at Columbia University with the senior editors of the fictional &quot;Sun&quot;, accepting the Pulitzer Prize, with no mention being made as to the aftermath of Templeton&#x27;s career. Alma Gutierrez is shown being exiled to the Carroll County bureau past the suburbs.

==News partnership==
In September 2008, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; became the newspaper partner of station WJZ-TV, owned and operated by CBS; the partnership involves sharing content and story leads, and teaming up on stories. WJZ promoted &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; stories in its news broadcasts. &quot;The Sun&quot; promoted WJZ&#x27;s stories and weather team on its pages.

Since the 2024 purchase led by Sinclair chairman David Smith, the paper has partnered with Sinclair flagship WBFF-TV. Their respective websites republish each other&#x27;s stories and articles from WBFF-TV and other Sinclair outlets appear in the paper. This was a sticking point with the newspaper&#x27;s union, since the articles sometimes did not meet The Sun&#x27;s journalistic standards.

<text>The University of Southern Indiana (USI) is a public university just outside of Evansville, Indiana. Founded in 1965, USI enrolls 9,750 dual credit, undergraduate, graduate and doctoral students in more than 130 areas of study. USI offers programs through the College of Liberal Arts, Romain College of Business, College of Nursing and Health Professions and the Pott College of Science, Engineering, and Education.

USI is classified among &quot;M1 – Master&#x27;s Colleges and Universities: Larger programs&quot;. It is also classified among &quot;community-engaged&quot; institutions.

Since the 2022–2023 school year, USI athletic teams participated in Division I of the NCAA as a member of the Ohio Valley Conference. The teams are known as the Screaming Eagles. Previously, USI participated in Division II as a member of the Great Lakes Valley Conference.

==History==

The University of Southern Indiana began as a regional campus of Indiana State University, opening on September 15, 1965. In 1967, Southern Indiana Higher Education, Inc., (SIHE) raised nearly $1 million to acquire 1,400 acres for the Mid-America University Center. Groundbreaking was held June 22, 1968. Since September 1969, the University has occupied 330 acres, mostly donated by SIHE. The first buildings constructed were the Science Center and the Wright Administration Building. Slowly the school built facilities, as funding became available during the Indiana State University–Evansville period.

On April 16, 1985, ISU–Evansville became an autonomous four-year institution, the University of Southern Indiana. Governor Robert D. Orr, an Evansville native, signed the newly independent school&#x27;s charter. Since gaining its independence, USI&#x27;s growth has continued to where it is now the fastest growing comprehensive university in the state. The university established student housing, diversified the programs offered, and enrollment has more than doubled since gaining its independence. In October 2006, the university completed a master plan that provides the framework to double the size of the school and support a campus of over 20,000 students. The master plan features key planning principles to guide the university and help it create a cohesive campus as it continues to grow.

==Academics==
USI offers over 70 undergraduate majors, 13 master&#x27;s programs, and 2 doctoral programs as of the fall 2018 semester.

<text>The Trouton–Noble experiment was an attempt to detect motion of the Earth through the luminiferous aether, and was conducted in 1901–1903 by Frederick Thomas Trouton and H. R. Noble. It was based on a suggestion by George FitzGerald that a charged parallel-plate capacitor moving through the aether should orient itself perpendicular to the motion. Like the earlier Michelson–Morley experiment, Trouton and Noble obtained a null result: no motion relative to the aether could be detected. This null result was reproduced, with increasing sensitivity, by Rudolf Tomaschek (1925, 1926), Chase (1926, 1927) and Hayden in 1994. Such experimental results are now seen, consistent with special relativity, to reflect the validity of the principle of relativity and the absence of any absolute rest frame (or aether). The experiment is a test of special relativity.

The Trouton–Noble experiment is also related to thought experiments such as the &quot;Trouton–Noble paradox,&quot; and the &quot;right-angle lever&quot; or &quot;Lewis–Tolman paradox&quot;. Several solutions have been proposed to solve this kind of paradox, all of them in agreement with special relativity.

==Trouton–Noble experiment==

In the experiment, a suspended parallel-plate capacitor is held by a fine torsion fiber and is charged. If the aether theory were correct, the change in Maxwell&#x27;s equations due to the Earth&#x27;s motion through the aether would lead to a torque causing the plates to align perpendicular to the motion. This is given by:

:formula_1

where formula_2 is the torque, formula_3 the energy of the condenser, formula_4 the angle between the normal of the plate and the velocity.

On the other hand, the assertion of special relativity that Maxwell&#x27;s equations are invariant for all frames of reference moving at constant velocities would predict no torque (a null result). Thus, unless the aether were somehow fixed relative to the Earth, the experiment is a test of which of these two descriptions is more accurate. Its null result thus confirms Lorentz invariance of special relativity.

However, while the negative experimental outcome can easily be explained in the rest frame of the device, the explanation from the viewpoint of a non-co-moving frame (concerning the question, whether the same torque should arise as in the &quot;aether frame&quot; described above, or whether no torque arises at all) is much more difficult and is called &quot;Trouton–Noble paradox,&quot; which can be solved in several ways (see Solutions below).

==Right-angle lever paradox==

The Trouton–Noble paradox is essentially equivalent to a thought experiment called the &quot;right angle lever paradox&quot;, first discussed by Gilbert Newton Lewis and Richard Chase Tolman in 1909.
Suppose a right-angle lever with endpoints &quot;abc&quot;. In its rest frame, the forces formula_5 towards &quot;ba&quot; and formula_6 towards &quot;bc&quot; must be equal to obtain equilibrium, thus no torque is given by the law of the lever:

:formula_7

where formula_2 is the torque, and formula_9 the rest length of one lever arm. However, due to length contraction, &quot;ba&quot; is longer than &quot;bc&quot; in a non-co-moving system, thus the law of the lever gives:

:formula_10

It can be seen that the torque is not zero, which apparently would cause the lever to rotate in the non-co-moving frame. Since no rotation is observed, Lewis and Tolman thus concluded that no torque exists, therefore:

:formula_11

However, as shown by Max von Laue (1911),
this is in contradiction with the relativistic expressions of force,

:formula_12

which gives

:formula_13

When applied to the law of the lever, the following torque is produced:

:formula_14

Which is principally the same problem as in the Trouton–Noble paradox.

==Solutions==
The detailed relativistic analysis of both the Trouton–Noble paradox and the right-angle lever paradox requires care to correctly reconcile, for example, the effects seen by observers in different frames of reference, but ultimately all such theoretical descriptions are shown to give the same result. In both cases an apparent net torque on an object (when viewed from a certain frame of reference) does not result in any rotation of the object, and in both cases this is explained by correctly accounting, in the relativistic way, for the transformation of all the relevant forces, momenta and the accelerations produced by them. The early history of descriptions of this experiment is reviewed by Janssen (1995).

===Laue current===
The first solution of the Trouton–Noble paradox was given by Hendrik Lorentz (1904). His result is based on the assumption that the torque and momentum due to electrostatic forces are compensated by the torque and momentum due to molecular forces. However, there is no known mechanism for how a Lorentz transformation could produce such molecular forces. In addition, if two point charges are connected by a flexible string, no molecular force could produce a turning moment.

This was further elaborated by Max von Laue (1911), who gave the standard solution for these kind of paradoxes. It was based on the so-called &quot;inertia of energy&quot; in its general formulation by Max Planck. According to Laue, an energy current connected with a certain momentum (&quot;Laue current&quot;) is produced in moving bodies by elastic stresses. The resulting mechanical torque in the case of the Trouton–Noble experiment amounts to:

:formula_15

and in the right-angle lever:

:formula_16

which exactly compensates the electromagnetic torque mentioned above, thus no rotation occurs on both cases. Or in other words: The electromagnetic torque is actually necessary for the uniform motion of a body, &quot;i.e.&quot;, to hinder the body to rotate due to the mechanical torque caused by elastic stresses.


Since then, many papers appeared which elaborated on Laue&#x27;s current, providing some modifications or re-interpretations, and included different variants of &quot;hidden&quot; momentum.

===Force and acceleration===
A solution without compensating forces or redefinitions of force and equilibrium was published by Richard C. Tolman and Paul Sophus Epstein in 1911. 
They applied the notion of a relativistic mass that was different in the longitudinal direction and the transverse direction so that force and acceleration do not always have the same direction. The role played by the concept of force in relativity is very different from that of Newtonian mechanics.
A similar conclusion was reached by Franklin (2006),
using invariant mass that did not change with direction, but using the fact that the direction of relativistic acceleration is different from the direction of relativistic force.

Epstein imagined a massless rod with endpoints &quot;OM&quot;, which is mounted at point &quot;O&quot;, and a particle with rest mass &quot;m&quot; is mounted at &quot;M&quot; (see ). The rod forms the angle formula_17 with the y&#x27;-axis. Now a force formula_18 towards &quot;O&quot; is applied at &quot;M&quot;, and equilibrium in its rest frame is achieved when formula_19. As already shown above, these forces have the form in a non-co-moving frame:

:formula_20

Thus formula_21.

So the resultant force does not directly point from &quot;O&quot; to &quot;M&quot;. Does this lead to a rotation of the rod? No, because Epstein now considered the accelerations caused by the two forces.
He used the concept of a relativistic mass that was different in the longitudinal direction and the transverse direction such that
:formula_22.
The relativistic expressions in the case, where a mass &quot;m&quot; is accelerated by these two forces in the longitudinal and transverse direction, are
:formula_23.

Thus formula_24.

Franklin used the relativistic connection between force and acceleration,
:formula_25
Using this relation between relativistic force and acceleration, it can be shown that
no rotation occurs in this system. Similar considerations are also to be applied to the right-angle lever and Trouton–Noble paradox. So the paradoxes are resolved, because the two accelerations (as vectors) point to the center of gravity of the system, although the two forces do not.

<text>Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel were an English rock band who formed in the early 1970s in London. Their music covered a range of styles from pop to progressive rock. Over the years, they have had five albums on the UK Albums Chart and twelve singles on the UK Singles Chart.

==Career==
Steve Harley grew up in London&#x27;s New Cross area and attended Haberdashers&#x27; Aske&#x27;s Hatcham Boys&#x27; School. His musical career began in the late 1960s when he was busking (with John Crocker aka Jean-Paul Crocker) and performing his own songs, some of which were later recorded by him and the band.

===The original Cockney Rebel===

After an initial stint as a journalist, Harley hooked up with his former folk music partner, Crocker (fiddle / mandolin / guitar) in 1972 to form the original Cockney Rebel. Crocker had just finished a short stint with Trees and they advertised and auditioned drummer Stuart Elliott, bassist Paul Jeffreys, and guitarist Nick Jones. This line-up played one of the band&#x27;s first gigs at the Roundhouse, Chalk Farm, London on 23 July 1973, supporting the Jeff Beck Group. Nick was soon replaced by guitarist Pete Newnham but Steve felt that the Cockney Rebel sound did not need an electric guitar and they settled on the combination of Crocker&#x27;s electric violin and the Fender Rhodes piano of keyboardist Milton Reame-James to share the lead. The band was signed to EMI after playing five gigs. Their first single, &quot;Sebastian&quot;, was an immediate success in Europe, although it failed to score in the UK Singles Chart. Their debut album, &quot;The Human Menagerie&quot;, was released in 1973. Although the album was not a commercial success, the band attracted a growing following in London.

Harley himself was much written about in the musical press, and the other members began to consider themselves regarded and treated as sidemen rather than co-equals, so there was tension in the band even as they were having a big hit with their second single, &quot;Judy Teen&quot;. In May 1974, the British music magazine, &quot;NME&quot; reported that Cockney Rebel were to undertake their first British tour, including a show at London&#x27;s Victoria Palace Theatre on 23 June. The album &quot;The Psychomodo&quot; followed. A &quot;Live at the BBC&quot; album from 1995 included material recorded during a 1974 BBC Radio 1 broadcast. Following the European single &quot;Psychomodo&quot;, a second single from the album, &quot;Mr. Soft&quot;, was also a hit. &quot;Tumbling Down&quot; was issued in America as a promotional single. By this time the problems within the band reached a head, and all the musicians, with the exception of Elliott, quit at the end of a successful UK tour, to become session musicians. The original keyboardist, Milton Reame-James, recalled in 2010 that the original band &quot;said goodbye on the steps of Abbey Road studios and were never to meet up again&quot;. Crocker continued to write songs and perform, forming a duet with his brother. After a brief period with Be-Bop Deluxe in 1974, Reame-James and Jeffreys formed the band Chartreuse in 1976.

===Regrouping===
Harley&#x27;s next appearance on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot;, under his own name, was supported by session musicians including Francis Monkman, and B. A. Robertson. The band&#x27;s single &quot;Big Big Deal&quot; was issued in 1974 and was almost immediately withdrawn.

From then on, the band - billed as Steve Harley &amp; Cockney Rebel - were a band in name only, being more or less a Harley solo project. In 1974, a further album, &quot;The Best Years of Our Lives&quot;, was released, produced by Alan Parsons. This included the track &quot;Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)&quot; which became a UK number one single in February 1975, and was the band&#x27;s biggest selling hit. Their only No. 1, It sold over one million copies globally. Amongst the backing vocalists on the song was Tina Charles. In a television interview recorded in 2002, Harley described how the lyrics are vindictively directed at the former band members who, he felt, had abandoned him. , for whose band Jeffreys and had departed, confirms this story.

One more single from the album, &quot;Mr. Raffles (Man, It Was Mean)&quot; made the Top 20, and the following album &quot;Timeless Flight&quot; was a top 20 success, although both singles &quot;Black or White&quot; and &quot;White, White Dove&quot; failed to chart. After 1975, Harley struggled to match the success of &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; and faded from fame, and Cockney Rebel eventually disbanded. The band had a surprise Top 10 in the summer of 1976 with a cover version of &quot;Here Comes the Sun&quot;. This was followed by the Top 50 single &quot;(I Believe) Love&#x27;s a Prima Donna&quot; and the album &quot;Love&#x27;s a Prima Donna&quot;. Harley also provided vocals on the Alan Parsons Project song &quot;The Voice&quot; on 1977&#x27;s &quot;I Robot&quot;.

===Harley as solo artist===

Harley released two failed solo albums in the late 1970s; 1978&#x27;s &quot;Hobo with a Grin&quot; which featured the two singles &quot;Roll the Dice&quot; and &quot;Someone&#x27;s Coming&quot;, and 1979&#x27;s &quot;The Candidate&quot;. He made a minor comeback as a solo artist in the UK Singles Chart with &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Prisoner&quot; from the latter album. After a brief appearance in the 1980s with a song from Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, the 1982 single &quot;I Can&#x27;t Even Touch You&quot; was released by Harley under the band name, whilst the 1983 minor hit single &quot;Ballerina (Prima Donna)&quot; was also credited to the band on both sides of the vinyl release, although not on the sleeve, where Harley was solely credited. In 1986, Harley released two singles on RAK; &quot;Irresistible&quot; and &quot;Heartbeat Like Thunder&quot;.

Cockney Rebel&#x27;s original bassist, Paul Jeffreys, was one of those who died in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 in 1988. He was with his bride on their honeymoon.

===Revival of the band===
In 1988, Harley formed a new line-up of Cockney Rebel and began touring again in 1989. In April 1990, after the success of the 1989 &quot;Come Back, All Is Forgiven&quot; tour, Harley and several members of that tour&#x27;s line-up reformed as Raffles United, and played four consecutive nights in a pub in Sudbury, London. These concerts were essentially used as &quot;Pop Idol&quot; style auditions for new band members, in particular a new bassist, lead guitarist, drummer, and violinist. Harley&#x27;s brother, Ian Nice, who had played keyboards in 1989, remained on keyboards for both this show, and most of the band&#x27;s tours in the 1990s. The band&#x27;s line-up that got finalised from these shows ended up debuting on June 5, 1990, at Doncaster Dome, and consisted of Harley, Ian Nice on keyboards, Nick Pynn on violin and guitar, Robbie Gladwell on lead guitar, Paul Francis on drums, and Billy Dyer on bass guitar. As of 2022, Gladwell continues to perform this role in the band, whereas Dyer has returned sporadically when the usual bassist for the band has been ill, most notably in 2014 (depping for Lincoln Anderson), and 2021 (depping for Kuma Harada).

Harley has released several solo albums since – &quot;Yes You Can&quot; in 1992 (including the singles &quot;Irresistible&quot; and &quot;Star for a Week (Dino)&quot;), &quot;Poetic Justice&quot; in 1996, and most recently, &quot;The Quality of Mercy&quot; in 2005 (which included the singles &quot;A Friend for Life&quot; and &quot;The Last Goodbye&quot;), the first since the 1970s to be released with the Cockney Rebel name. He dubbed his touring band &#x27;Cockney Rebel Mark III&#x27;.

===Tours and new material since 2010===

In 2010, Steve Harley and Cockney Rebel began touring again setting concert dates for England, Ireland, and Northern Ireland. This was done following the release of the new studio album &quot;Stranger Comes to Town&quot;. In October 2012, the remastered four-disc box-set anthology compilation album &quot;&quot; was released, chronicling the recording career of the original Cockney Rebel line-up. On 24 November 2012 the band including the Orchestra of the Swan and a choir performed the band&#x27;s first two albums &quot;The Human Menagerie&quot; and &quot;The Psychomodo&quot; in their entirety for the first time. A live double-CD and DVD was released in October 2013 of this performance, titled &quot;Birmingham&quot;.

In 2016, the newly reestablished Chrysalis Records, now owned by Blue Raincoat Music, announced that it had acquired the Cockney Rebel catalogue. Harley was one of the artists who appeared on the label&#x27;s first release, a charity single of the Rolling Stones&#x27; &quot;You Can&#x27;t Always Get What You Want&quot; credited to Friends of Jo Cox in tribute to Jo Cox, a Labour Party MP who had been assassinated earlier that year.

In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, Harley&#x27;s live shows resumed in August 2021. The line-up for the full rock band shows consisted of Harley, Wickens, Lascelles, Gladwell, Elliott, and Harada. The 2021 shows marked the first time this line-up toured together (having only previously played festivals in 2016), as well as Gladwell&#x27;s full-time return to the band, having stood in sporadically for Paul Cuddeford on a handful of occasions between 2017 and 2020. The set-lists for the 2021 shows featured many songs that had not been played live for many years, in particular from Harley&#x27;s 1992 album &quot;Yes You Can&quot;.

===Acoustic tours===

After the success of 1998 and 1999&#x27;s respective &#x27;Stripped To The Bare Bones&#x27; and &#x27;Stripped Again&#x27; tours, Harley would continue to tour in an acoustic format. Firstly with Jim Cregan and a selection of other members of Cockney Rebel, depending on the exact date of the show, in 2002. This format produced 2003&#x27;s &quot;Acoustic and Pure: Live&quot; album. With the exception of the 2015 reunion, which was in the full band format, Cregan would next join Harley for 2 acoustic shows in March 2020, which otherwise featured Harley performing alone. In 2003 and 2004, the 5-piece acoustic line-up that played 2004&#x27;s &quot;Anytime! (A Live Set)&quot; album was put together, featuring Lascelles on percussion, Gladwell on lead guitar, Wickens on violin/guitar, and Anderson on double bass. In 2005 and 2006, this format was used in Holland and Belgium while promoting 2005&#x27;s &quot;The Quality Of Mercy&quot; album, and these shows are notable for featuring significant rearrangements of some of the songs from the album, which were never played during concerts in England. These shows were played without Anderson.

Between 2010 and 2019 these concerts were revived as a 3-man line-up, with Harley alongside Wickens and Lascelles (this time on keyboards and percussion, as per his role in the full rock band shows). These shows were originally marketed as the &#x27;3-man acoustic show&#x27; before being renamed to &#x27;Acoustic Trio&#x27; in 2016. The shows in 2010 were marketed as an &#x27;Acoustic Set&#x27;, as they were the first acoustic shows since 2004. This format was phased out in 2020 - in order to promote Harley&#x27;s new album &quot;Uncovered&quot;- in favour of a revived 4-man line-up, though with David Delarre on lead guitar, and Oli Hayhurst on double bass, with Harley and Wickens reprising their roles. The COVID-19 pandemic delayed most of the shows on this tour - with only the first 9 played as planned. Two shows were however played in late-September 2020, both in the acoustic trio format, though Hayhurst accompanied the trio on the second of these shows. In addition, Harley held an online Q and A session via Zoom Videoconferencing in mid-December 2020.

===Reissues and non-band activities===

Two of the bigger hits appeared in UK television advertisements in the 1990s: &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; for Carlsberg Lager in 1995, prompting the track&#x27;s return to the UK Top 40; and &quot;Mr Soft&quot; for Trebor Softmints between 1987 and 1994. &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; was used again in a 2005 advertisement for Marks &amp; Spencer. It was also used on the soundtrack of the 1997 film &quot;The Full Monty&quot; and the 1998 glam rock film &quot;Velvet Goldmine&quot;, in the latter&#x27;s case being used in the end credits.

From 1999 to 2008, Harley presented a show on BBC Radio 2 called &quot;Sounds of the 70s&quot;.

In 2006, EMI released a CD box set compilation album spanning Harley&#x27;s Cockney Rebel and solo work, titled &quot;The Cockney Rebel – A Steve Harley Anthology&quot;.

On 25 July 2007, they performed in Warsaw, Poland, and on 28 July 2007 in Saint Petersburg, Russia, in both cases opening the Rolling Stones&#x27; concerts.

In 2007, the song &quot;Make Me Smile (Come Up and See Me)&quot; was used by the Norwegian national lottery Norsk Tipping in a popular TV commercial in Norway.

In 2018, &quot;Make Me Smile&quot; was used again in an advert for Viagra, the first one of its kind to air on UK television. Harley often joked at his live concerts and in interviews that his 1974 single, &quot;Mr Soft&quot;, may have been more appropriate, given the nature of the product. In 2020, however, the contract with Pfizer ended, and changed to BMW starting in April 2021. Harley had long driven the manufacturer&#x27;s 7-Series model.

Original keyboardist, Reame-James, had since joined with James Staddon, Phil Beer and Robbie Johnson to create &#x27;Banana Rebel&#x27;, who have released a CD &quot;Top Banana&quot;, available from their website.

Steve Harley died at his home in Suffolk on 17 March 2024, aged 73, after announcing that he had been diagnosed with cancer.

<text>A cantenna (a portmanteau blending the words &quot;can&quot; and &quot;antenna&quot;) is a homemade directional waveguide antenna, made out of an open-ended metal can.

Cantennas are typically used to increase the range (or discovery) of Wi-Fi networks.

== Construction ==

The cylinder portion of the can may consist of metal-coated paperboard.

Although some designs are based on a Pringles potato chips can, this tube is too narrow to increase the 2.4 GHz signal by a useful amount, although at 5 GHz it would be about the right size. However, a cantenna can be made from various cans or tubes of an appropriate diameter. Some designs include a pole mount to elevate the cantenna.

At 2.4 GHz, losses can occur if the cable from the cantenna to the Wi-Fi circuitry is too long. A more efficient cantenna can be made by minimising this length or connecting the cantenna directly to the Wi-Fi circuitry.

== Use ==

Cantennas are typically used for extending a wireless local area network (WLAN).

The tiny design makes them ideal for mobile applications such as wardriving.

Cantennas can be used to increase cell phone range, improve reception, and decrease noise.

A cantenna can be used as a satellite dish feed horn. The 5.5 GHz cantenna dimensions are almost perfect in that they make a good fit for the standard TV satellite dish. The resulting setup is a low-cost high-quality high-gain antenna. Such setups are widely used in wireless community networks for long-distance links.

Cantennas may be used with other RF devices such as wireless security cameras.

<doc id="263101" wikidata="Q310453" url="?curid=263101" title="Shunzhi Emperor">
<text>The Shunzhi Emperor (15 March 1638 – 5 February 1661), also known by his temple name Emperor Shizu of Qing, personal name Fulin, was the third emperor of the Qing dynasty, and the first Qing emperor to rule over China proper. Upon the death of his father Hong Taiji, a committee of Manchu princes chose the 5-year-old Fulin as successor. The princes also appointed two co-regents: Dorgon, the 14th son of Nurhaci, and Jirgalang, one of Nurhaci&#x27;s nephews, both of whom were members of the Qing imperial clan. In November 1644, the Shunzhi Emperor was enthroned as emperor of China in Beijing.

From 1643 to 1650, political power lay mostly in the hands of the prince regent Dorgon. Under his leadership, the Qing conquered most of the territory of the fallen Ming dynasty, chased Ming loyalist regimes deep into the southwestern provinces, and established the basis of Qing rule over China proper despite highly unpopular policies such as the &quot;hair cutting command&quot; of 1645, which forced all Qing male subjects to shave their forehead and braid their remaining hair into a queue resembling that of the Manchus. After Dorgon&#x27;s death on the last day of 1650, the young Shunzhi Emperor started to rule personally. He tried, with mixed success, to fight corruption and to reduce the political influence of the Manchu nobility. In the 1650s, he faced a resurgence of Ming loyalist resistance, but by 1661 his armies had defeated the Qing&#x27;s last enemies, Koxinga and the Prince of Gui, both of whom would succumb the following year.

The Shunzhi Emperor died at the age of 22 of smallpox, a highly contagious disease that was endemic in China, but against which the Manchus had no immunity. He was succeeded by his third son who assumed the throne as the Kangxi Emperor and went on to reign for sixty years. Because fewer documents have survived from the Shunzhi era than from later eras of the Qing dynasty, this era is a relatively little-known period of Qing history.

==Historical background==
In the 1580s, when China was ruled by the Ming dynasty (1368–1644), a number of Jurchen tribes lived in Manchuria. In a series of campaigns from the 1580s to the 1610s, Nurhaci (1559–1626), the leader of the Jianzhou Jurchens, unified most Jurchen tribes under his rule. One of his most important reforms was to integrate Jurchen clans under flags of four different colors—yellow, white, red, and blue—each further subdivided into two to form an encompassing social and military system known as the Eight Banners. Nurhaci gave control of these Banners to his sons and grandsons. Around 1612, Nurhaci renamed his clan Aisin Gioro (&quot;golden Gioro&quot; in the Manchu language), both to distinguish his family from other Gioro lines and to allude to an earlier dynasty that had been founded by Jurchens, the Jin (&quot;golden&quot;) dynasty that had ruled northern China from 1115 to 1234. In 1616 Nurhaci formally announced the foundation of the &quot;Later Jin&quot; dynasty, effectively declaring his independence from the Ming. Over the next few years he wrested most major cities in Liaodong from Ming control. His string of victories ended in February 1626 at the siege of Ningyuan, where Ming commander Yuan Chonghuan defeated him with the help of recently acquired Portuguese cannon. Probably wounded during the battle, Nurhaci died a few months later.

Nurhaci&#x27;s son and successor Hong Taiji (1592–1643) continued his father&#x27;s state-building efforts: he concentrated power into his own hands, modeled the Later Jin&#x27;s government institutions on Chinese ones, and integrated Mongol allies and surrendered Chinese troops into the Eight Banners. In 1629 he led an incursion to the outskirts of Beijing, during which he captured Chinese craftsmen who knew how to cast Portuguese cannon. In 1635 Hong Taiji renamed the Jurchens the &quot;Manchus&quot;, and in 1636 changed the name of his polity from &quot;Later Jin&quot; to &quot;Qing&quot;. After capturing the last remaining Ming cities in Liaodong, by 1643 the Qing were preparing to attack the struggling Ming dynasty, which was crumbling under the combined weight of financial bankruptcy, devastating epidemics, and large-scale bandit uprisings fed by widespread starvation.

==Becoming emperor==
When Hong Taiji died on 21 September 1643 without having named a successor, the fledgling Qing state faced a possibly serious crisis. Several contenders—namely Nurhaci&#x27;s second and eldest surviving son Daišan, Nurhaci&#x27;s fourteenth and fifteenth sons Dorgon and Dodo (both born to the same mother), and Hong Taiji&#x27;s eldest son Hooge—started to vie for the throne. With his brothers Dodo and Ajige, Dorgon (31 years old) controlled the Plain and Bordered White Banners, Daišan (60) was in charge of the two Red Banners, whereas Hooge (34) had the loyalty of his father&#x27;s two Yellow Banners.

The decision about who would become the new Qing emperor fell to the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers, which was the Manchus&#x27; main policymaking body until the emergence of the Grand Council in the 1720s. Many Manchu princes argued that Dorgon, a proven military leader, should become the new emperor, but Dorgon refused and insisted that one of Hong Taiji&#x27;s sons should succeed his father. To recognize Dorgon&#x27;s authority while keeping the throne in Hong Taiji&#x27;s descent line, the members of the council named Hong Taiji&#x27;s ninth son, Fulin, as the new emperor, but decided that Dorgon and Jirgalang (a nephew of Nurhaci who controlled the Bordered Blue Banner) would act as the five-year-old child&#x27;s regents. Fulin was officially crowned emperor of the Qing dynasty on 8 October 1643; it was decided that he would reign under the era name &quot;Shunzhi.&quot; Because the Shunzhi reign is not well documented, it constitutes a relatively little-known period of Qing history.

==Dorgon&#x27;s regency (1643–1650)==
===A quasi emperor===
On 17 February 1644, Jirgalang, who was a capable military leader but looked uninterested in managing state affairs, willingly yielded control of all official matters to Dorgon. After an alleged plot by Hooge to undermine the regency was exposed on 6 May of that year, Hooge was stripped of his title of Imperial Prince and his co-conspirators were executed. Dorgon soon replaced Hooge&#x27;s supporters (mostly from the Yellow Banners) with his own, thus gaining closer control of two more Banners. By early June 1644, he was in firm control of the Qing government and its military.

In early 1644, just as Dorgon and his advisors were pondering how to attack the Ming, peasant rebellions were dangerously approaching Beijing. On 24 April of that year, rebel leader Li Zicheng breached the walls of the Ming capital, pushing the Chongzhen Emperor to hang himself on a hill behind the Forbidden City. Hearing the news, Dorgon&#x27;s Chinese advisors Hong Chengchou and Fan Wencheng (范文程; 1597–1666) urged the Manchu prince to seize this opportunity to present themselves as avengers of the fallen Ming and to claim the Mandate of Heaven for the Qing. The last obstacle between Dorgon and Beijing was Ming general Wu Sangui, who was garrisoned at Shanhai Pass at the eastern end of the Great Wall. Himself caught between the Manchus and Li Zicheng&#x27;s forces, Wu requested Dorgon&#x27;s help in ousting the bandits and restoring the Ming. When Dorgon asked Wu to work for the Qing instead, Wu had little choice but to accept. Aided by Wu Sangui&#x27;s elite soldiers, who fought the rebel army for hours before Dorgon finally chose to intervene with his cavalry, the Qing won a decisive victory against Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass on 27 May. Li&#x27;s defeated troops looted Beijing for several days until Li left the capital on 4 June with all the wealth he could carry.

===Settling in the capital===
After six weeks of mistreatment at the hands of rebel troops, the Beijing population sent a party of elders and officials to greet their liberators on 5 June. They were startled when, instead of meeting Wu Sangui and the Ming heir apparent, they saw Dorgon, a horseriding Manchu with his shaved forehead, present himself as the Prince Regent. In the midst of this upheaval, Dorgon installed himself in the Wuying Palace (), the only building that remained more or less intact after Li Zicheng had set fire to the palace complex on 3 June. Banner troops were ordered not to loot; their discipline made the transition to Qing rule &quot;remarkably smooth.&quot; Yet at the same time as he claimed to have come to avenge the Ming, Dorgon ordered that all claimants to the Ming throne (including descendants of the last Ming emperor) should be executed along with their supporters.

On 7 June, just two days after entering the city, Dorgon issued special proclamations to officials around the capital, assuring them that if the local population accepted to shave their forehead, wear a queue, and surrender, the officials would be allowed to stay at their post. He had to repeal this command three weeks later after several peasant rebellions erupted around Beijing, threatening Qing control over the capital region.

Dorgon greeted the Shunzhi Emperor at the gates of Beijing on 19 October 1644. On 30 October the six-year-old monarch performed sacrifices to Heaven and Earth at the Altar of Heaven. The southern cadet branch of Confucius&#x27; descendants who held the title Wujing boshi and the sixty-fifth generation descendant of Confucius to hold the title Duke Yansheng in the northern branch both had their titles reconfirmed on 31 October. A formal ritual of enthronement for Fulin was held on 8 November, during which the young emperor compared Dorgon&#x27;s achievements to those of the Duke of Zhou, a revered regent from antiquity. During the ceremony, Dorgon&#x27;s official title was raised from &quot;Prince Regent&quot; to &quot;Uncle Prince Regent&quot; (&quot;Shufu shezheng wang&quot; 叔父攝政王), in which the Manchu term for &quot;Uncle&quot; (&quot;ecike&quot;) represented a rank higher than that of imperial prince. Three days later Dorgon&#x27;s co-regent Jirgalang was demoted from &quot;Prince Regent&quot; to &quot;Assistant Uncle Prince Regent&quot; (&quot;Fu zheng shuwang&quot; 輔政叔王). In June 1645, Dorgon eventually decreed that all official documents should refer to him as &quot;Imperial Uncle Prince Regent&quot; (&quot;Huang shufu shezheng wang&quot; 皇叔父攝政王), which left him one step short of claiming the throne for himself.
One of Dorgon&#x27;s first orders in the new Qing capital was to vacate the entire northern part of Beijing to give it to Bannermen, including Han Chinese Bannermen. The Yellow Banners were given the place of honor north of the palace, followed by the White Banners east, the Red Banners west, and the Blue Banners south. This distribution accorded with the order established in the Manchu homeland before the conquest and under which &quot;each of the banners was given a fixed geographical location according to the points of the compass.&quot; Despite tax remissions and large-scale building programs designed to facilitate the transition, in 1648 many Chinese civilians still lived among the newly arrived Banner population and there was still animosity between the two groups. Agricultural land outside the capital was also marked off (&quot;quan&quot; 圈) and given to Qing troops. Former landowners now became tenants who had to pay rent to their absentee Bannermen landlords. This transition in land use caused &quot;several decades of disruption and hardship.&quot;

In 1646, Dorgon also ordered that the civil examinations for selecting government officials be reestablished. From then on they were held regularly every three years as under the Ming. In the very first palace examination held under Qing rule in 1646, candidates, most of whom were northern Chinese, were asked how the Manchus and Han Chinese could be made to work together for a common purpose. The 1649 examination inquired about &quot;how Manchus and Han Chinese could be unified so that their hearts were the same and they worked together without division.&quot; Under the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s reign, the average number of graduates per session of the metropolitan examination was the highest of the Qing dynasty (&quot;to win more Chinese support&quot;), until 1660 when lower quotas were established.

To promote ethnic harmony, in 1648 an imperial decree formulated by Dorgon allowed Han Chinese civilians to marry women from the Manchu Banners, with the permission of the Board of Revenue if they were registered daughters of officials or commoners, or the permission of their banner company captain if they were unregistered commoners. Only later in the dynasty were these policies allowing intermarriage rescinded.

=== Conquest of China proper ===

Under the reign of Dorgon—whom historians have variously called &quot;the mastermind of the Qing conquest&quot; and &quot;the principal architect of the great Manchu enterprise&quot;—the Qing subdued almost all of China and pushed loyalist &quot;Southern Ming&quot; resistance into the far southwestern reaches of China. After repressing anti-Qing revolts in Hebei and Shandong in the Summer and Fall of 1644, Dorgon sent armies to root out Li Zicheng from the important city of Xi&#x27;an (Shaanxi province), where Li had reestablished his headquarters after fleeing Beijing in early June 1644. Under the pressure of Qing armies, Li was forced to leave Xi&#x27;an in February 1645, and he was killed—either by his own hand or by a peasant group that had organized for self-defense in this time of rampant banditry—in September 1645 after fleeing though several provinces.

From newly captured Xi&#x27;an, in early April 1645 the Qing mounted a campaign against the rich commercial and agricultural region of Jiangnan south of the lower Yangtze River, where in June 1644 a Ming imperial prince had established a regime loyal to the Ming. Factional bickering and numerous defections prevented the Southern Ming from mounting an efficient resistance. Several Qing armies swept south, taking the key city of Xuzhou north of the Huai River in early May 1645 and soon converging on Yangzhou, the main city on the Southern Ming&#x27;s northern line of defense. Bravely defended by Shi Kefa, who refused to surrender, Yangzhou fell to Manchu artillery on 20 May after a one-week siege. Dorgon&#x27;s brother Prince Dodo then ordered the slaughter of Yangzhou&#x27;s entire population. As intended, this massacre terrorized other Jiangnan cities into surrendering to the Qing. Indeed, Nanjing surrendered without a fight on 16 June after its last defenders had made Dodo promise he would not hurt the population. The Qing soon captured the Ming emperor (who died in Beijing the following year) and seized Jiangnan&#x27;s main cities, including Suzhou and Hangzhou; by early July 1645, the frontier between the Qing and the Southern Ming had been pushed south to the Qiantang River.

On 21 July 1645, after Jiangnan had been superficially pacified, Dorgon issued a most inopportune edict ordering all Chinese men to shave their forehead and to braid the rest of their hair into a queue identical to those of the Manchus. The punishment for non-compliance was death. This policy of symbolic submission helped the Manchus in telling friend from foe. For Han officials and literati, however, the new hairstyle was shameful and demeaning (because it breached a common Confucian directive to preserve one&#x27;s body intact), whereas for common folk cutting their hair was the same as losing their virility. Because it united Chinese of all social backgrounds into resistance against Qing rule, the hair cutting command greatly hindered the Qing conquest. The defiant population of Jiading and Songjiang was massacred by former Ming general Li Chengdong (李成東; d. 1649), respectively on 24 August and 22 September. Jiangyin also held out against about 10,000 Qing troops for 83 days. When the city wall was finally breached on 9 October 1645, the Qing army led by Ming defector Liu Liangzuo (劉良佐; d. 1667) massacred the entire population, killing between 74,000 and 100,000 people. These massacres ended armed resistance against the Qing in the Lower Yangtze. A few committed loyalists became hermits, hoping that for lack of military success, their withdrawal from the world would at least symbolize their continued defiance against foreign rule.

After the fall of Nanjing, two more members of the Ming imperial household created new Southern Ming regimes: one centered in coastal Fujian around the &quot;Longwu Emperor&quot; Zhu Yujian, Prince of Tang—a ninth-generation descendant of Ming founder Zhu Yuanzhang—and one in Zhejiang around &quot;Regent&quot; Zhu Yihai, Prince of Lu. But the two loyalist groups failed to cooperate, making their chances of success even lower than they already were. In July 1646, a new Southern Campaign led by Prince Bolo sent Prince Lu&#x27;s Zhejiang court into disarray and proceeded to attack the Longwu regime in Fujian. Zhu Yujian was caught and summarily executed in Tingzhou (western Fujian) on 6 October. His adoptive son Koxinga fled to the island of Taiwan with his fleet. Finally in November, the remaining centers of Ming resistance in Jiangxi province fell to the Qing.

In late 1646 two more Southern Ming monarchs emerged in the southern province of Guangzhou, reigning under the era names of Shaowu () and Yongli. Short of official costumes, the Shaowu court had to purchase robes from local theater troops. The two Ming regimes fought each other until 20 January 1647, when a small Qing force led by Li Chengdong captured Guangzhou, killed the Shaowu Emperor, and sent the Yongli court fleeing to Nanning in Guangxi. In May 1648, however, Li mutinied against the Qing, and the concurrent rebellion of another former Ming general in Jiangxi helped Yongli to retake most of south China. This resurgence of loyalist hopes was short-lived. New Qing armies managed to reconquer the central provinces of Huguang (present-day Hubei and Hunan), Jiangxi, and Guangdong in 1649 and 1650. The Yongli emperor had to flee again. Finally on 24 November 1650, Qing forces led by Shang Kexi captured Guangzhou and massacred the city&#x27;s population, killing as many as 70,000 people.

Meanwhile, in October 1646, Qing armies led by Hooge (the son of Hong Taiji who had lost the succession struggle of 1643) reached Sichuan, where their mission was to destroy the kingdom of bandit leader Zhang Xianzhong. Zhang was killed in a battle against Qing forces near Xichong in central Sichuan on 1 February 1647. Also late in 1646 but further north, forces assembled by a Muslim leader known in Chinese sources as Milayin () revolted against Qing rule in Ganzhou (Gansu). He was soon joined by another Muslim named Ding Guodong (). Proclaiming that they wanted to restore the Ming, they occupied a number of towns in Gansu, including the provincial capital Lanzhou. These rebels&#x27; willingness to collaborate with non-Muslim Chinese suggests that they were not only driven by religion. Both Milayin and Ding Guodong were captured and killed by Meng Qiaofang (孟喬芳; 1595–1654) in 1648, and by 1650 the Muslim rebels had been crushed in campaigns that inflicted heavy casualties.

==Transition and personal rule (1651–1661)==
===Purging Dorgon&#x27;s clique===
Dorgon&#x27;s unexpected death on 31 December 1650 during a hunting trip triggered a period of fierce factional struggles and opened the way for deep political reforms. Because Dorgon&#x27;s supporters were still influential at court, Dorgon was given an imperial funeral and was posthumously elevated to imperial status as the &quot;Righteous Emperor&quot; (&quot;yi huangdi&quot; 義皇帝). On the same day of mid-January 1651, however, several officers of the White Banners led by former Dorgon supporter Ubai arrested Dorgon&#x27;s brother Ajige for fear he would proclaim himself as the new regent; Ubai and his officers then named themselves presidents of several Ministries and prepared to take charge of the government.

Meanwhile, Jirgalang, who had been stripped of his title of regent in 1647, gathered support among Banner officers who had been disgruntled during Dorgon&#x27;s rule. In order to consolidate support for the emperor in the two Yellow Banners (which had belonged to the Qing monarch since Hong Taiji) and to gain followers in Dorgon&#x27;s Plain White Banner, Jirgalang named them the &quot;Upper Three Banners&quot; (&quot;shang san qi&quot; 上三旗; Manchu: &quot;dergi ilan gūsa&quot;), which from then on were owned and controlled by the emperor. Oboi and Suksaha, who would become regents for the Kangxi Emperor in 1661, were among the Banner officers who gave Jirgalang their support, and Jirgalang appointed them to the Council of Deliberative Princes to reward them.

On 1 February, Jirgalang announced that the Shunzhi Emperor, who was about to turn thirteen, would now assume full imperial authority. The regency was thus officially abolished. Jirgalang then moved to the attack. In late February or early March 1651 he accused Dorgon of usurping imperial prerogatives: Dorgon was found guilty and all his posthumous honors were removed. Jirgalang continued to purge former members of Dorgon&#x27;s clique and to bestow high ranks and nobility titles upon a growing number of followers in the Three Imperial Banners, so that by 1652 all of Dorgon&#x27;s former supporters had been either killed or effectively removed from government.

===Factional politics and the fight against corruption===

On 7 April 1651, barely two months after he seized the reins of government, the Shunzhi Emperor issued an edict announcing that he would purge corruption from officialdom. This edict triggered factional conflicts among literati that would frustrate him until his death. One of his first gestures was to dismiss grand academician Feng Quan (馮銓; 1595–1672), a northern Chinese who had been impeached in 1645 but was allowed to remain in his post by Prince Regent Dorgon. The Shunzhi Emperor replaced Feng with Chen Mingxia (ca. 1601–1654), an influential southern Chinese with good connections in Jiangnan literary societies. Though later in 1651 Chen was also dismissed on charges of influence peddling, he was reinstated in his post in 1653 and soon became a close personal advisor to the sovereign. He was even allowed to draft imperial edicts just as Ming Grand Secretaries used to. Still in 1653, the Shunzhi Emperor decided to recall the disgraced Feng Quan, but instead of balancing the influence of northern and southern Chinese officials at court as the emperor had intended, Feng Quan&#x27;s return only intensified factional strife. In several controversies at court in 1653 and 1654, the southerners formed one bloc opposed to the northerners and the Manchus. In April 1654, when Chen Mingxia spoke to northern official Ning Wanwo (寧完我; d. 1665) about restoring the style of dress of the Ming court, Ning immediately denounced Chen to the emperor and accused him of various crimes including bribe-taking, nepotism, factionalism, and usurping imperial prerogatives. Chen was executed by strangulation on 27 April 1654.

In November 1657, a major cheating scandal erupted during the Shuntian provincial-level examinations in Beijing. Eight candidates from Jiangnan who were also relatives of Beijing officials had bribed examiners in the hope of being ranked higher in the contest. Seven examination supervisors found guilty of receiving bribes were executed, and several hundred people were sentenced to punishments ranging from demotion to exile and confiscation of property. The scandal, which soon spread to Nanjing examination circles, uncovered the corruption and influence-peddling that was rife in the bureaucracy, and that many moralistic officials from the north attributed to the existence of southern literary clubs and to the decline of classical scholarship.

===Chinese style of rule===
During his short reign, the Shunzhi Emperor encouraged Han Chinese to participate in government activities and revived many Chinese-style institutions that had been either abolished or marginalized during Dorgon&#x27;s regency. He discussed history, classics, and politics with grand academicians such as Chen Mingxia (see previous section) and surrounded himself with new men such as Wang Xi (王熙; 1628–1703), a young northern Chinese who was fluent in Manchu. The &quot;Six Edicts&quot; (&quot;Liu yu&quot; 六諭) that the Shunzhi Emperor promulgated in 1652 were the predecessors to the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s &quot;Sacred Edicts&quot; (1670): &quot;bare bones of Confucian orthodoxy&quot; that instructed the population to behave in a filial and law-abiding fashion. In another move toward Chinese-style government, the sovereign reestablished the Hanlin Academy and the Grand Secretariat in 1658. These two institutions based on Ming models further eroded the power of the Manchu elite and threatened to revive the extremes of literati politics that had plagued the late Ming, when factions coalesced around rival grand secretaries.

To counteract the power of the Imperial Household Department and the Manchu nobility, in July 1653 the Shunzhi Emperor established the Thirteen Offices (), or Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus, which were supervised by Manchus, but manned by Chinese eunuchs rather than Manchu bondservants. Eunuchs had been kept under tight control during Dorgon&#x27;s regency, but the young emperor used them to counter the influence of other power centers such as his mother the Empress Dowager and former regent Jirgalang. By the late 1650s eunuch power became formidable again: they handled key financial and political matters, offered advice on official appointments, and even composed edicts. Because eunuchs isolated the monarch from the bureaucracy, Manchu and Chinese officials feared a return to the abuses of eunuch power that had plagued the late Ming. Despite the emperor&#x27;s attempt to impose strictures on eunuch activities, the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s favorite eunuch Wu Liangfu (吳良輔; d. 1661), who had helped him defeat the Dorgon faction in the early 1650s, was caught in a corruption scandal in 1658. The fact that Wu only received a reprimand for his accepting bribes did not reassure the Manchu elite, which saw eunuch power as a degradation of Manchu power. The Thirteen Offices would be eliminated (and Wu Liangfu executed) by Oboi and the other regents of the Kangxi Emperor in March 1661 soon after the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s death.

===Frontiers, tributaries, and foreign relations===
In 1646, when Qing armies led by Bolo had entered the city of Fuzhou, they had found envoys from the Ryūkyū Kingdom, Annam, and the Spanish in Manila. These tributary embassies that had come to see the now fallen Longwu Emperor of the Southern Ming were forwarded to Beijing, and eventually sent home with instructions about submitting to the Qing. The King of the Ryūkyū Islands sent his first tribute mission to the Qing in 1649, Siam in 1652, and Annam in 1661, after the last remnants of Ming resistance had been removed from Yunnan, which bordered Annam.

Also in 1646 sultan Abu al-Muhammad Haiji Khan, a Moghul prince who ruled Turfan, had sent an embassy requesting the resumption of trade with China, which had been interrupted by the fall of the Ming dynasty. The mission was sent without solicitation, but the Qing agreed to receive it, allowing it to conduct tribute trade in Beijing and Lanzhou (Gansu). But this agreement was interrupted by a Muslim rebellion that engulfed the northwest in 1646 (see the last paragraph of the &quot;Conquest of China&quot; section above). Tribute and trade with Hami and Turfan, which had aided the rebels, were eventually resumed in 1656. In 1655, however, the Qing court announced that tributary missions from Turfan would be accepted only once every five years.

In 1651 the young emperor invited to Beijing the Fifth Dalai Lama, the leader of the Yellow Hat Sect of Tibetan Buddhism, who, with the military help of Khoshot Mongol Gushri Khan, had recently unified religious and secular rule in Tibet. Qing emperors had been patrons of Tibetan Buddhism since at least 1621 under the reign of Nurhaci, but there were also political reasons behind the invitation. Namely, Tibet was becoming a powerful polity west of the Qing, and the Dalai Lama held influence over Mongol tribes, many of which had not submitted to the Qing. To prepare for the arrival of this &quot;living Buddha,&quot; the Shunzhi Emperor ordered the building of the White Dagoba (&quot;baita&quot; 白塔) on an island on one of the imperial lakes northwest of the Forbidden City, at the former site of Qubilai Khan&#x27;s palace. After more invitations and diplomatic exchanges to decide where the Tibetan leader would meet the Qing emperor, the Dalai Lama arrived in Beijing in January 1653. The Dalai Lama later had a scene of this visit carved in the Potala Palace in Lhasa, which he had started building in 1645.

Meanwhile, north of the Manchu homeland, adventurers Vassili Poyarkov (1643–46) and Yerofei Khabarov (1649–53) had started to explore the Amur River valley for Tzarist Russia. In 1653 Khabarov was recalled to Moscow and replaced by Onufriy Stepanov, who assumed command of Khabarov&#x27;s Cossack troops. Stepanov went south into the Sungari River, along which he exacted &quot;yasak&quot; (fur tribute) from native populations such as the Daur and the Duchers, but these groups resisted because they were already paying tribute to the Shunzhi Emperor (&quot;Shamshakan&quot; in Russian sources). In 1654 Stepanov defeated a small Manchu force that had been despatched from Ningguta to investigate Russian advances. In 1655 another Qing commander, the Mongol Minggadari (d. 1669), defeated Stepanov&#x27;s forces at fort Kumarsk on the Amur, but this was not enough to chase the Russians. In 1658, however, Manchu general Šarhūda (1599–1659) attacked Stepanov with a fleet of 40 or more ships that managed to kill or capture most Russians. This Qing victory temporarily cleared the Amur valley of Cossack bands, but Sino-Russian border conflicts would continue until 1689, when the signature of the Treaty of Nerchinsk fixed the borders between Russia and the Qing.

===Continuous campaigns against the Southern Ming===

Though the Qing under Dorgon&#x27;s leadership had successfully pushed the Southern Ming deep into southern China, Ming loyalism was not dead yet. In early August 1652, Li Dingguo, who had served as general in Sichuan under bandit king Zhang Xianzhong (d. 1647) and was now protecting the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming, retook Guilin (Guangxi province) from the Qing. Within a month, most of the commanders who had been supporting the Qing in Guangxi reverted to the Ming side. Despite occasionally successful military campaigns in Huguang and Guangdong in the next two years, Li failed to retake important cities. In 1653, the Qing court put Hong Chengchou in charge of retaking the southwest. Headquartered in Changsha (in what is now Hunan province), he patiently built up his forces; only in late 1658 did well-fed and well-supplied Qing troops mount a multipronged campaign to take Guizhou and Yunnan. In late January 1659, a Qing army led by Manchu prince Doni took the capital of Yunnan, sending the Yongli Emperor fleeing into nearby Burma, which was then ruled by King Pindale Min of the Toungoo dynasty. The last sovereign of the Southern Ming stayed there until 1662, when he was captured and executed by Wu Sangui, the former Ming general whose surrender to the Manchus in April 1644 had allowed Dorgon to start the Qing conquest of China.

Zheng Chenggong (&quot;Koxinga&quot;), who had been adopted by the Longwu Emperor in 1646 and ennobled by Yongli in 1655, also continued to defend the cause of the Southern Ming. In 1659, just as the Shunzhi Emperor was preparing to hold a special examination to celebrate the glories of his reign and the success of the southwestern campaigns, Zheng sailed up the Yangtze River with a well-armed fleet, took several cities from Qing hands, and went so far as to threaten Nanjing. When the emperor heard of this sudden attack he is said to have slashed his throne with a sword in anger. But the siege of Nanjing was relieved and Zheng Chenggong repelled, forcing Zheng to take refuge in the southeastern coastal province of Fujian. Pressured by Qing fleets, Zheng fled to Taiwan in April 1661 but died that same summer. His descendants resisted Qing rule until 1683, when the Kangxi Emperor successfully took the island.

===Personality and relationships===
After Fulin came to rule on his own in 1651, his mother the Empress Dowager Zhaosheng arranged for him to marry her niece, but the young monarch deposed his new Empress in 1653. The following year Xiaozhuang arranged another imperial marriage with her Khorchin Mongol clan, this time matching her son with her own grand-niece. Though Fulin also disliked his second empress (known posthumously as Empress Xiaohuizhang), he was not allowed to demote her. She never bore him children. Starting in 1656, the Shunzhi Emperor lavished his affection on Consort Donggo, who, according to Jesuit accounts from the time, had first been the wife of another Manchu noble. She gave birth to a son (the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s fourth) in November 1657. The emperor would have made him his heir apparent, but he died early in 1658 before he was given a name.

The Shunzhi Emperor was an open-minded emperor and relied on the advice of Johann Adam Schall von Bell, a Jesuit missionary from Cologne in the Germanic parts of the Holy Roman Empire, for guidance on matters ranging from astronomy and technology to religion and government. In late 1644, Dorgon had put Schall in charge of preparing a new calendar because his eclipse predictions had proven more reliable than those of the official astronomer. After Dorgon&#x27;s death Schall developed a personal relationship with the young emperor, who called him &quot;grandfather&quot; (&quot;mafa&quot; in Manchu). At the height of his influence in 1656 and 1657, Schall reports that the Shunzhi Emperor often visited his house and talked to him late into the night. He was excused from prostrating himself in the presence of the emperor, was granted land to build a church in Beijing, and was even given imperial permission to adopt a son (because Fulin worried that Schall did not have an heir), but the Jesuits&#x27; hope of converting the Qing sovereign to Christianity was crushed when the Shunzhi Emperor became a devout follower of Chan Buddhism in 1657.

The emperor developed a good command of Chinese that allowed him to manage matters of state and to appreciate Chinese arts such as calligraphy and drama. One of his favorite texts was &quot;Rhapsody of a Myriad Sorrows&quot; (&quot;Wan chou qu&quot; 萬愁曲), by Gui Zhuang (歸莊; 1613–1673), who was a close friend of anti-Qing intellectuals Gu Yanwu and Wan Shouqi (萬壽祺; 1603–1652). &quot;Quite passionate and attach[ing] great importance to &quot;qing&quot; (love),&quot; he could also recite by heart long passages of the popular &quot;Romance of the Western Chamber&quot;.

== Death and succession ==
=== Smallpox ===
In September 1660, Consort Donggo, the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s favourite consort, suddenly died as a result of grief over the loss of a child. Overwhelmed with grief, the emperor fell into dejection for months, until he contracted smallpox on 2 February 1661. On 4 February 1661, officials Wang Xi (王熙, 1628–1703; the emperor&#x27;s confidant) and Margi (a Manchu) were called to the emperor&#x27;s bedside to record his last will. On the same day, his seven-year-old third son Xuanye was chosen to be his successor, probably because he had already survived smallpox. The emperor died on 5 February 1661 in the Forbidden City at the age of twenty-two.

The Manchus feared smallpox more than any other disease because they had no immunity to it and almost always died when they contracted it. By 1622 at the latest, they had already established an agency to investigate smallpox cases and isolate sufferers to avoid contagion. During outbreaks, royal family members were routinely sent to &quot;smallpox avoidance centers&quot; (&quot;bidousuo&quot; 避痘所) to protect themselves from infection. The Shunzhi Emperor was particularly fearful of the disease, because he was young and lived in a large city, near sources of contagion. Indeed, during his reign at least nine outbreaks of smallpox were recorded in Beijing, each time forcing the emperor to move to a protected area such as the &quot;Southern Park&quot; (Nanyuan 南苑), a hunting ground south of Beijing where Dorgon had built a &quot;smallpox avoidance center&quot; in the 1640s. Despite this and other precautions—such as rules forcing Chinese residents to move out of the city when they contracted smallpox—the young monarch still succumbed to that illness.

=== Forged last will ===
The emperor&#x27;s last will, which was made public on the evening of 5 February, appointed four regents for his young son: Oboi, Soni, Suksaha, and Ebilun, who had all helped Jirgalang to purge the court of Dorgon&#x27;s supporters after Dorgon&#x27;s death on the last day of 1650. It is difficult to determine whether the Shunzhi Emperor had really named these four Manchu nobles as regents, because they and Empress Dowager Zhaosheng clearly tampered with the emperor&#x27;s testament before promulgating it. The emperor&#x27;s will expressed his regret about his Chinese-style ruling (his reliance on eunuchs and his favoritism toward Chinese officials), his neglect of Manchu nobles and traditions, and his headstrong devotion to his consort rather than to his mother. Though the emperor had often issued self-deprecating edicts during his reign, the policies his will rejected had been central to his government since he had assumed personal rule in the early 1650s. The will as it was formulated gave &quot;the mantle of imperial authority&quot; to the four regents, and served to support their pro-Manchu policies during the period known as the Oboi regency, which lasted from 1661 to 1669.

=== After death ===
Because court statements did not clearly announce the cause of the emperor&#x27;s death, rumors soon started to circulate that he had not died but in fact retired to a Buddhist monastery to live anonymously as a monk, either out of grief for the death of his beloved consort, or because of a coup by the Manchu nobles his will had named as regents. These rumors seemed not so incredible because the emperor had become a fervent follower of Chan Buddhism in the late 1650s, even letting monks move into the imperial palace. Modern Chinese historians have considered the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s possible retirement as one of the three mysterious cases of the early Qing. But much circumstantial evidence—including an account by one of these monks that the emperor&#x27;s health greatly deteriorated in early February 1661 because of smallpox, and the fact that a concubine and an Imperial Bodyguard committed suicide to accompany the emperor in burial—suggests that the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s death was not staged.

After being kept in the Forbidden City for 27 days of mourning, on 3 March 1661 the emperor&#x27;s corpse was transported in a lavish procession to Jingshan 景山 (a hillock just north of the Forbidden City), after which a large amount of precious goods were burned as funeral offerings. Only two years later, in 1663, was the body transported to its final resting place. Contrary to Manchu customs at the time, which usually dictated that a deceased person should be cremated, the Shunzhi Emperor was buried. He was interred in what later came to be known as the Eastern Qing Tombs, 125 kilometers (75 miles) northeast of Beijing, one of two Qing imperial cemeteries. His tomb is part of the Xiao () mausoleum complex (known in Manchu as the Hiyoošungga Munggan), which was the first mausoleum to be erected on that site.

== Legacy ==


The fake will in which the Shunzhi Emperor had supposedly expressed regret for abandoning Manchu traditions gave authority to the nativist policies of the Kangxi Emperor&#x27;s four regents. Citing the testament, Oboi and the other regents quickly abolished the Thirteen Eunuch Bureaus. Over the next few years, they enhanced the power of the Imperial Household Department, which was run by Manchus and their bondservants, eliminated the Hanlin Academy, and limited membership in the Deliberative Council of Princes and Ministers to Manchus and Mongols. The regents also adopted aggressive policies toward the Qing&#x27;s Chinese subjects: they executed dozens of people and punished thousands of others in the wealthy Jiangnan region for literary dissent and tax arrears, and forced the coastal population of southeast China to move inland in order to starve the Taiwan-based Kingdom of Tungning run by descendants of Koxinga.

After the Kangxi Emperor managed to imprison Oboi in 1669, he reverted many of the regents&#x27; policies. He restored institutions his father had favored, including the Grand Secretariat, through which Chinese officials gained an important voice in government. He also defeated the rebellion of the Three Feudatories, three Chinese military commanders who had played key military roles in the Qing conquest, but had now become entrenched rulers of enormous domains in southern China. The civil war (1673–1681) tested the loyalty of the new Qing subjects, but Qing armies eventually prevailed. Once victory had become certain, a special examination for &quot;eminent scholars of broad learning&quot; (&quot;Boxue hongru&quot; 博學鴻儒) was held in 1679 to attract Chinese literati who had refused to serve the new dynasty. The successful candidates were assigned to compile the official history of the fallen Ming dynasty. The rebellion was defeated in 1681, the same year the Kangxi Emperor initiated the use of variolation to inoculate children of the imperial family against smallpox. When the Kingdom of Tungning finally fell in 1683, the military consolidation of the Qing regime was complete. The institutional foundation laid by Dorgon, and the Shunzhi and Kangxi emperors allowed the Qing to erect an imperial edifice of awesome proportion and to turn it into &quot;one of the most successful imperial states the world has known.&quot; Ironically, however, the prolonged &quot;Pax Manchurica&quot; that followed the Kangxi consolidation made the Qing unprepared to face aggressive European powers with modern weaponry in the nineteenth century.

==Family==
Although only nineteen imperial consorts are recorded for the Shunzhi Emperor in the Aisin-Gioro genealogy made by the Imperial Clan Court, burial records show that he had at least thirty-two of them. There were two empresses in his reign, both relatives of his mother.

He had a total of fourteen children, but only four sons (Fuquan, Xuanye, Changning, and Longxi) and one daughter (Princess Gongque) lived to be old enough to marry. Unlike later Qing emperors, the names of the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s sons did not include a generational character.

Before the Qing court moved to Beijing in 1644, Manchu women used to have personal names, but after 1644 these names &quot;disappear from the genealogical and archival records&quot;. Imperial consorts were usually known by their titles and the name of their patrilineal clan, while imperial daughters were given a title and rank by which they then became known only after their betrothal. Although five of the Shunzhi Emperor&#x27;s six daughters died in infancy or childhood, they all appear in the Aisin-Gioro genealogy.

<text>Instructional scaffolding is the support given to a student by an instructor throughout the learning process. This support is specifically tailored to each student; this instructional approach allows students to experience student-centered learning, which tends to facilitate more efficient learning than teacher-centered learning. This learning process promotes a deeper level of learning than many other common teaching strategies.

Instructional scaffolding provides sufficient support to promote learning when concepts and skills are being first introduced to students. These supports may include resource, compelling task, templates and guides, and/or guidance on the development of cognitive and social skills. Instructional scaffolding could be employed through modeling a task, giving advice, and/or providing coaching.

These supports are gradually removed as students develop learning strategies, thus promoting their own cognitive, affective and psychomotor learning skills and knowledge. Teachers help the students master a task or a concept by providing support. The support can take many forms such as outlines, recommended documents, storyboards, or key questions.

== Essential features ==

There are three essential features of scaffolding that facilitate learning.
# The first feature is the interaction between the learner and the expert. This interaction should be collaborative for it to be effective.
# The second is that learning should take place in the learner&#x27;s zone of proximal development. To do that the expert needs to be aware of the learner&#x27;s current level of knowledge and then work to a certain extent beyond that level.
# The third feature of scaffolding is that the scaffold, the support and guidance provided by the expert, is gradually removed as the learner becomes more proficient.
The support and guidance provided to the learner are compared to the scaffolds in building construction where the scaffolds provide both &quot;adjustable and temporal&quot; support to the building under construction. The support and guidance provided to learners facilitate internalization of the knowledge needed to complete the task. This support is weaned gradually until the learner is independent.

== Effective scaffolding ==
For scaffolding to be effective teachers need to pay attention to the following:
# The selection of the learning task: The task should ensure that learners use the developing skills that need to be mastered. The task should also be engaging and interesting to keep learners involved. This task should be neither too difficult nor too easy for the learner.
# The anticipation of errors: After choosing the task, the teacher needs to anticipate errors the learners are likely to commit when working on the task. Anticipation of errors enables the scaffolder to properly guide the learners away from ineffective directions.
# The application of scaffolds during the learning task: Scaffolds could be organized in &quot;simple skill acquisition or they may be dynamic and generative&quot;.
# The consideration of emotional issues: Scaffolding is not limited to a cognitive skill and can also support emotional responses (affect). For example, during a task the &quot;scaffolder&quot; (expert) might need to manage and control for frustration and loss of interest that could be experienced by the learner. Encouragement is also an important scaffolding component.

== Theory of scaffolding ==
&quot;Scaffolding theory&quot; was first introduced in the late 1950s by Jerome Bruner, a cognitive psychologist. He used the term to describe young children&#x27;s oral language acquisition. Helped by their parents when they first start learning to speak, young children are provided with informal instructional formats within which their learning is facilitated. A scaffolding format investigated by Bruner and his postdoctoral student Anat Ninio, whose scaffolding processes are described in detail, is joint picture-book reading. By contrast, bed-time stories and read-alouds are examples of book-centered parenting events without scaffolding interaction. Scaffolding is inspired by Lev Vygotsky&#x27;s concept of an expert assisting a novice, or an apprentice. Scaffolding is changing the level of support to suit the cognitive potential of the child. Over the course of a teaching session, one can adjust the amount of guidance to fit the child&#x27;s potential level of performance. More support is offered when a child is having difficulty with a particular task and, over time, less support is provided as the child makes gains on the task. Ideally, scaffolding works to maintain the child&#x27;s potential level of development in the zone of proximal development (ZPD). An essential element to the ZPD and scaffolding is the acquisition of language. According to Vygotsky, language (and in particular, speech) is fundamental to children&#x27;s cognitive growth because language provides purpose and intention so that behaviors can be better understood. Through the use of speech, children are able to communicate to and learn from others through dialogue, which is an important tool in the ZPD. In a dialogue, a child&#x27;s unsystematic, disorganized, and spontaneous concepts are met with the more systematic, logical and rational concepts of the skilled helper. Empirical research suggests that the benefits of scaffolding are not only useful during a task, but can extend beyond the immediate situation in order to influence future cognitive development. For instance, a recent study recorded verbal scaffolding between mothers and their 3- and 4-year-old children as they played together. Then, when the children were six years old, they underwent several measures of executive function, such as working memory and goal-directed play. The study found that the children&#x27;s working memory and language skills at six years of age were related to the amount of verbal scaffolding provided by mothers at age three. In particular, scaffolding was most effective when mothers provided explicit conceptual links during play. Therefore, the results of this study not only suggest that verbal scaffolding aids children&#x27;s cognitive development, but that the quality of the scaffolding is also important for learning and development.

A construct that is critical for scaffolding instruction is Vygotsky&#x27;s concept of the zone of proximal development (ZPD). The zone of proximal development is the field between what a learner can do on their own (expert stage) and the most that can be achieved with the support of a knowledgeable peer or instructor (pedagogical stage). Vygotsky was convinced that a child could be taught any subject efficiently using scaffolding practices by implementing the scaffolds through the zone of proximal development. Students are escorted and monitored through learning activities that function as interactive conduits to get them to the next stage. Thus the learner obtains new understandings by building on their prior knowledge through the support delivered by more capable individuals. Several peer-reviewed studies have shown that when there is a deficiency in guided learning experiences and social interaction, learning and development are obstructed. Moreover, several things influence the ZPD of students, ranging from the collaboration of peers to technology available in the classroom.

In writing instruction, support is typically presented in verbal form (discourse). The writing tutor engages the learner&#x27;s attention, calibrates the task, motivates the student, identifies relevant task features, controls for frustration, and demonstrates as needed. Through joint activities, the teacher scaffolds conversation to maximize the development of a child&#x27;s intrapsychological functioning. In this process, the adult controls the elements of the task that are beyond the child&#x27;s ability, all the while increasing the expectations of what the child is able to do. Speech, a critical tool to scaffold thinking and responding, plays a crucial role in the development of higher psychological processes because it enables thinking to be more abstract, flexible, and independent. From a Vygotskian perspective, talk and action work together with the sociocultural fabric of the writing event to shape a child&#x27;s construction of awareness and performance. Dialogue may range from casual talk to deliberate explanations of features of written language. The talk embedded in the actions of the literacy event shapes the child&#x27;s learning as the tutor regulates his or her language to conform to the child&#x27;s degrees of understanding. shows that what may seem like casual conversational exchanges between tutor and student actually offer many opportunities for fostering cognitive development, language learning, story composition for writing, and reading comprehension. Conversations facilitate generative, constructive, experimental, and developmental speech and writing in the development of new ideas.

In Vygotsky&#x27;s words, &quot;what the child is able to do in collaboration today he will be able to do independently tomorrow&quot;.

Some ingredients of scaffolding are predictability, playfulness, focus on meaning, role reversal, modeling, and nomenclature.

== Levels and types in the educational setting ==
According to Saye and Brush, there are two levels of scaffolding: soft and hard. An example of soft scaffolding in the classroom would be when a teacher circulates the room and converses with his or her students. The teacher may question their approach to a difficult problem and provide constructive feedback to the students. According to Van Lier, this type of scaffolding can also be referred to as contingent scaffolding. The type and amount of support needed is dependent on the needs of the students during the time of instruction. Unfortunately, applying scaffolding correctly and consistently can be difficult when the classroom is large and students have various needs. Scaffolding can be applied to a majority of the students, but the teacher is left with the responsibility to identify the need for additional scaffolding.

In contrast with contingent or soft scaffolding, embedded or hard scaffolding is planned in advance to help students with a learning task that is known in advance to be difficult. For example, when students are discovering the formula for the Pythagorean Theorem in math class, the teacher may identify hints or cues to help the student reach an even higher level of thinking. In both situations, the idea of &quot;expert scaffolding&quot; is being implemented: the teacher in the classroom is considered the expert and is responsible for providing scaffolding for the students.

Reciprocal scaffolding, a method first coined by Holton and Thomas, is a method that involves a group of two or more collaboratively working together. In this situation, the group can learn from each other&#x27;s experiences and knowledge. The scaffolding is shared by each member and changes constantly as the group works on a task. According to Vygotsky, students develop higher-level thinking skills when scaffolding occurs with an adult expert or with a peer of higher capabilities. Conversely, Piaget believes that students discard their ideas when paired with an adult or student of more expertise. Instead, students should be paired with others who have different perspectives. Conflicts would then take place between students allowing them to think constructively at a higher level.

Technical scaffolding is a newer approach in which computers replace the teachers as the experts or guides, and students can be guided with web links, online tutorials, or help pages. Educational software can help students follow a clear structure and allows students to plan properly.

===Directive and supportive scaffolding===

Silliman and Wilkinson distinguish two types of scaffolding: &#x27;supportive scaffolding&#x27; that characterises the IRF (Initiation-Response-Follow-up) pattern; and &#x27;directive scaffolding&#x27; that refers to IRE (Initiation-Response-Evaluation). Saxena (2010) develops these two notions theoretically by incorporating Bhaktin&#x27;s (1981) and van Lier&#x27;s (1996) works. Within the IRE pattern, teachers provide &#x27;directive scaffolding&#x27; on the assumption that their job is to transmit knowledge and then assess its appropriation by the learners. The question-answer-evaluation sequence creates a predetermined standard for acceptable participation and induces passive learning. In this type of interaction, the teacher holds the right to evaluate and asks &#x27;known-information&#x27; questions which emphasise the reproduction of information. The nature and role of the triadic dialogue have been oversimplified and the potential for the roles of teachers and students in them has been undermined.

If, in managing the talk, teachers apply &#x27;constructive power&#x27; and exploit students&#x27; responses as occasions for joint exploration, rather than simply evaluating them, then the classroom talk becomes dialogic. The pedagogic orientation of this talk becomes &#x27;participation orientation&#x27;, in contrast to &#x27;display/assessment orientation&#x27; of IRE. In this kind of pattern of interaction, the third part of the triadic dialogue offers &#x27;follow-up&#x27; and teachers&#x27; scaffolding becomes &#x27;supportive&#x27;. Rather than producing &#x27;authoritative discourse&#x27;, teachers construct &#x27;internally persuasive discourse&#x27; that allows &#x27;equality&#x27; and &#x27;symmetry&#x27; wherein the issues of power, control, institutional managerial positioning, etc. are diffused or suspended. The discourse opens up the roles for students as the &#x27;primary knower&#x27; and the &#x27;sequence initiator&#x27;, which allows them to be the negotiator and co-constructor of meaning. The suspension of asymmetry in the talk represents a shift in the teacher&#x27;s ideological stance and, therefore, demonstrates that supportive scaffolding is more than simply a model of instruction.

==The role of guidance==

===Guidance and cognitive load===
Learner support in scaffolding is known as guidance. While it takes on various forms and styles, the basic form of guidance is any type of interaction from the instructor that is intended to aid and/or improve student learning. While this a broad definition, the role and amount of guidance is better defined by the instructor&#x27;s approach. Instructionists and constructionists approach giving guidance within their own instructional frameworks. Scaffolding involves presenting learners with proper guidance that moves them towards their learning goals. Providing guidance is a method of moderating the cognitive load of a learner. In scaffolding, learners can only be moved toward their learning goals if cognitive load is held in check by properly administered support.

Traditional teachers tend to give a higher level of deductive, diadactic instruction, with each piece of a complex task being broken down. This teacher-centered approach, consequently, tends to increase the cognitive load for students.

Constructivist instructors, in contrast, approach instruction from the approach of guided discovery with a particular emphasis on transfer. The concept of transfer focuses on a learner&#x27;s ability to apply learned tasks in a context other than the one in which it was learned. This results in constructivist instructors, unlike classical ones, giving a higher level of guidance than instruction.

===Amount of guidance===

Research has demonstrated that higher level of guidance has a greater effect on scaffolded learning, but is not a guarantee of more learning. The efficacy of higher amount of guidance is dependent on the level of detail and guidance applicability. Having multiple types of guidance (i.e. worked examples, feedback) can cause them to interact and reinforce each other. Multiple conditions do not guarantee greater learning, as certain types of guidance can be extraneous to the learning goals or the modality of learning. With this, more guidance (if not appropriate to the learning) can negatively impact performance, as it gives the learner overwhelming levels of information. However, appropriately designed high levels of guidance, which properly interact with the learning, is more beneficial to learning than low levels of guidance.

===Context of guidance===

Constructivists pay close attention to the context of guidance because they believe instruction plays a major role in knowledge retention and transfer. Research studies demonstrate how the context of isolated explanations can have an effect on student-learning outcomes. For example, Hake&#x27;s (1998) large-scale study demonstrated how post-secondary physics students recalled less than 30% of material covered in a traditional lecture-style class. Similarly, other studies illustrate how students construct different understandings from explanation in isolation versus having a first experience with the material. A first, experience with the material provides students with a &quot;need to know&quot;, which allows learners to reflect on prior experiences with the content, which can help learners construct meaning from instruction. Worked examples are guiding tools that can act as a &quot;need to know&quot; for students. Worked examples provide students with straightforward goals, step-by-step instructions as well as ready-to-solve problems that can help students develop a stronger understanding from instruction.

===Timing of guidance===
Guiding has a key role in both constructivism and &#x27;instructivism&#x27;. For instructivists, the timing of guidance is immediate, either at the beginning or when the learner makes a mistake, whereas in constructivism it can be delayed. It has been found that immediate feedback can lead to working memory load as it does not take in consideration the process of gradual acquisition of a skill, which also relates to the amount of guidance being given. Research on intelligent-tutoring systems suggests that immediate feedback on errors is a great strategy to promote learning. As the learner is able to integrate the feedback from short-term memory into the overall learning- and problem-solving task, the longer the wait on feedback and the harder it is for the learner to make this integration. Yet, in another study it was found that providing feedback right after the error can deprive the learner of the opportunity to develop evaluative skills. Wise and O&#x27;Neill bring these two, seemingly contradictory findings, and argue that it does not only prove the importance of the role of feedback, but that points out a timing feature of feedback: immediate feedback in the short term promotes more rapid problem-solving, but delaying feedback can result in better retention and transfer in the long term.

===Constructivism and guidance===

Constructivism views knowledge as a &quot;function of how the individual creates meaning from his or her own experiences&quot;. Constructivists advocate that learning is better facilitated in a minimally guided environment where learners construct important information for themselves. According to constructivism, minimal guidance in the form of process or task related information should be provided to learners upon request and direct instruction of learning strategies should not be used because it impedes the natural processes learners use to recall prior experiences.
In this view, for learners to construct knowledge they should be provided with the goals and minimal information and support. Applications that promote constructivist learning require learners to solve authentic problems or &quot;acquire knowledge in information-rich settings&quot;. An example of an application of constructivist learning is science instruction, where students are asked to discover the principles of science by imitating the steps and actions of researchers.

===Instructivism and guidance===
Instructionism are educational practices characterized for being instructor-centered. Some authors see instructionism as a highly prescriptive practice that mostly focuses on the formation of skills, that is very product-oriented and is not interactive; or that is a highly structured, systematic and explicit way of teaching that gives emphasis to the role of the teacher as a transmitter of knowledge and the students as passive receptacles. The &#x27;transmission&#x27; of knowledge and skills from the teacher to the student in this context is often manifested in the form of drill, practice and rote memorization. An &#x27;instructionist&#x27;, then, focuses on the preparation, organization and management of the lesson making sure the plan is detailed and the communication is effective. The emphasis is on the up-front explicit delivery of instruction.

Instructionism is often contrasted with constructivism. Both of them use the term &quot;guidance&quot; as means to support learning, and how it can be used more effectively. The difference in the use of guidance is found in the philosophical assumptions regarding the nature of the learner, but they also differ in their views around the quantity, the context and the timing of guidance. An example of application of instructionism in the classroom is direct instruction.

=== Minimal guidance in education ===
With traditional power dynamics in the classroom, the teacher is the authority. In order to engage in meaningful student talk, we need to break this hierarchy.&quot;&quot;Minimal guidance is a general term applied to a variety of pedagogical approaches such as inquiry learning, learner-centered pedagogy, student-centered learning, project-based learning, and discovery learning. It is the idea that learners, regardless of their level of expertise, will learn best through discovering and/or constructing information for themselves in contrast to more teacher-led classrooms which in contrast are described as more passive learning. A safe approach is to offer three options. The teacher designs two options based on what most students may like to do. The third choice is a blank check – students propose their own product or performance.In this approach, the role of the teacher may change from what has been described as &quot;sage on the stage&quot; to &quot;guide on the side&quot; with one example of this change in practice being that teachers will not tend to answer questions from students directly, but instead will ask questions back to students to prompt further thinking. This change in teaching style has also been described as being a &quot;facilitator of learning&quot; instead of being a &quot;dispenser of knowledge&quot;.

Minimal guidance is regarded as controversial and has been described as a caricature that does not exist in practice, and that critics have combined too many different approaches some of which may include more guidance, under the label of minimal guidance. However, there is some evidence that in certain domains, and under certain circumstances, a minimal guidance approach can lead to successful learning if sufficient practice opportunities are built in.

==== Minimal guidance in education: criticisms and controversies ====
One strand of criticism of the minimal guidance approach originating in cognitive load theory is that it does not align with human cognitive architecture making it an inefficient approach to learning for beginner learners in particular. In this strand of criticism, minimal guidance approaches are contrasted with fully guided approaches to instruction which better match inherent human cognitive architecture. While accepting this general line of argument, counter-arguments for individual approaches such as problem-based learning have highlighted how these are not minimal guidance approaches, and are consistent with human cognitive architecture. Other strands of criticism suggest that there is little empirical evidence for the effectiveness of learner-centered approaches when compared to more teacher-led approaches, and this is despite extensive encouragement and support from national and international education agencies including UNESCO, UNICEF, and the World Bank. Further more specific criticisms include the following: minimal guidance is inefficient compared to explicit instruction due to a lack of worked examples, minimal guidance leads to reduced opportunities for student practice, and minimal guidance happens inevitably in project-based learning as a result of the teacher having to manage too many student projects at one time.

==== Minimal guidance in education: synthesis and solutions ====
One of the consequences of this reconceptualization is abandoning the rigid explicit instruction versus minimal guidance dichotomy and replacing it with a more flexible approach based on differentiating specific goals of various learner activities in complex learning.There have been several attempts to move beyond the minimal guidance versus fully guided instruction controversy. These are often developed by introducing the variable of learner expertise and using that to suggest adapting instructional styles depending on the level of expertise of the learner, with more expert learners generally requiring less direct instruction. For example, despite providing many of the criticisms of minimal guidance, cognitive load theory does also suggest a role for less direct guidance from the teacher as learners become more expert due to the expertise reversal effect. Other attempts at synthesis include using pedagogies more associated with martial arts instruction that apply explicit instruction as a means of fostering student discovery through repeated practice. If instead we entertain the possibility that instruction and discovery are not oil and water, that instruction and discovery coexist and can work together, we may find a solution to this impasse in the field. Perhaps our way out of the instructivist-constructivist impasse thus involves not a &quot;middle ground&quot; compromise but an alternative conceptualization of instruction and discovery.

===Applications===
Instructional scaffolding can be thought of as the strategies that a teacher uses to help learners bridge a cognitive gap or progress in their learning to a level they were previously unable to accomplish. These strategies evolve as the teachers evaluate the learners initial level of ability and then through continued feedback throughout the progression of the task. In the early studies, scaffolding was primarily done in oral, face- to-face learning environments. In classrooms, scaffolding may include modelling behaviours, coaching and prompting, thinking out loud, dialogue with questions and answers, planned and spontaneous discussions, as well as other interactive planning or structural assistance to help the learner bridge a cognitive gap. This can also include peer mentoring from more experienced students. These peers can be referred to as MKOs. &quot;MKO&quot; stands for &#x27;More Knowledgeable Other&#x27;. The MKO is a person who has a higher understanding of an idea or concept and can bridge this cognitive gap. This includes teachers, parents, and as stated before, peers. MKOs are central part of the process of learning in the ZPD, or Zone of Proximal Development. An MKO may help a student using scaffolding, with the goal being that the student can eventually lead themselves to the answer on their own, without the help of anyone else. The MKO may use a gradual reduction of assistance in order to facilitate this, as described earlier.

There are a wide variety of scaffolding strategies that teachers employ. One approach to looking at the application of scaffolding is to look at a framework for evaluating these strategies.
This model was developed based on the theoretical principles of scaffolding to highlight the use of scaffolding for educational purposes. It highlights two components of an instructor&#x27;s use of scaffolding. The first is the instructors intentions and the second refers to the means by which the scaffolding is carried out.

Scaffolding intentions:
These groups highlight the instructors intentions for scaffolding

Scaffolding means:
These groups highlight the ways in which the instructor scaffolds

Any combination of scaffolding means with scaffolding intention can be construed as a scaffolding strategy, however, whether a teaching strategy qualifies as good scaffolding generally depends upon its enactment in actual practice and more specifically upon whether the strategy is applied contingently and whether it is also part of a process of fading and transfer of responsibility.

Examples of scaffolding:

Instructors can use a variety of scaffolds to accommodate different levels of knowledge. The context of learning (i.e. novice experience, complexity of the task) may require more than one scaffold strategy in order for the student to master new content. The following table outlines a few common scaffolding strategies:
===Scaffolding mediated by technology===

When students who are not physically present in the classroom receive instruction, instructors need to adapt to the environment and their scaffolding needs to be adjusted to fit the new learning medium. It can be challenging to find a way to adjust the verbal and visual elements of scaffolding to construct a successful interactive and collaborative learning environment for distance learning.

The recent spread of technology used in education has opened up the learning environment to include AI-based methods, hypermedia, hypertext, collaborative learning environments, and web-based learning environments. This challenges traditional learning design conceptions of scaffolding for educators.

A 2014 review of the types of scaffolding used in online learning identified four main types of scaffolding:
* conceptual scaffolding: helps students decide what to consider in learning and guide them to key concepts
* procedural scaffolding: helps students use appropriate tools and resources effectively 
* strategic scaffolding: helps students find alternative strategies and methods to solve complex problems
* metacognitive scaffolding: prompts students to think about what they are learning throughout the process and assists students reflecting on what they have learnt (self-assessment). This is the most common research area and is thought to not only promote higher-order thinking but also students&#x27; ability to plan ahead. Reingold, Rimor and Kalay have listed seven mechanisms of metacognitive scaffolding that encourage students&#x27; metacognition in learning.

These four types are structures that appropriately support students&#x27; learning in online environments. Other scaffolding approaches that were addressed by the researchers included: technical support, content support, argumentation template, questioning and modelling. These terms were rarely used, and it was argued that these areas had unclear structure to guide students, especially in online learning, and were inadequately justified.

As technology changes, so does the form of support provided to online learners. Instructors have the challenge of adapting scaffolding techniques to this new medium, but also the advantage of using new web-based tools such as wikis and blogs as platforms to support and discuss with students.

====Benefits in online learning environments====
As the research in this area progresses, studies are showing that when students learn about complex topics with computer-based learning environments (CBLEs) without scaffolding they demonstrated poor ability to regulate their learning, and failure to gain a conceptual understanding of the topic. As a result, researchers have recently begun to emphasize the importance of embedded conceptual, procedural, strategic, and metacognitive scaffolding in CBLEs.

In addition to the four scaffolding guidelines outlined, recent research has shown:
* scaffolding can help in group discussions. In a 2012 study, a significant increase in active participation and meaningful negotiations was found within the scaffolded groups as opposed to the non-scaffolded group.
* metacognitive scaffolding can be used to encourage students in reflecting and help build a sense of a community among learners. Specifically, Reingold, Rimor and Kalay recommend using metacognitive scaffolding to support students working on a common task. They believe this can support learners to experience their work as part of a community of learners.

Online classes do not require movement need to a different city or long distances in order to attend the program of one&#x27;s choice. Online learning allows a flexible schedule. Assessments are completed at the learner&#x27;s pace. It makes it easier for introverted students to ask questions or drop their ideas, which boost their confidence.

Online education is cost-effective and reduces travel expenses for both the learning institution and students. It improves technology literacy for teachers and students.

==== Downfalls in online learning environments ====
An online learning environment warrants many factors for scaffolding to be successful; this includes basic knowledge of the use of technology, social interactions and reliance on students&#x27; individual motivation and initiative for learning.  Collaboration is key to instructional scaffolding and can be lost without proper guidance from an instructor creating and initiating an online social space.  

The instructor&#x27;s role in creating a social space for online interaction has been found to increase students&#x27; confidence in understanding the content and goals of the course.  If an instructor does not create this space, a student misses out on critical thinking, evaluating material and collaborating with fellow students to foster learning.  Even with instructors implementing a positive social space online, a research study found that students&#x27; perceptions of incompetence to other classmates is not affected by positive online social spaces, but this was found to be less of a problem in face to face courses.  

Due to the distance learning that encompasses an online environment, self-regulation is essential for scaffolding to be effective; a study has shown that procrastinators are at a disadvantage in online distance learning and are not able to be scaffolded in the same degree as if there was an in-person instructor.  

According to the National Centre for Biotechnology Information research paper, teacher-student interactions are not what they used to be. Social relationships among teachers and their students are weakened due to online learning. Teachers tend to have low expectations from their students during online classes, which leads to low participation. Online education increases the risk of anxiety disorder, clinical depression, apathy, learned helplessness, and burnout. Learners without access to a laptop and the internet are often left out of the online learning world. Online learning courses do not provide enough verbal interaction, which makes it difficult for teachers to measure student engagement and learning outcomes. Students with disabilities often require special software to access educational resources online.

Students who had more desire to master the content than to receive higher grades were more successful in the online courses.  A study by Artino and Stephens found that graduate students were more motivated in online courses than undergraduate students but suggests that academic level may contribute to the amount of technological support needed for positive learning outcomes, finding that undergraduate students needed less support than graduate students when navigating an online course.

<text>Blackwardine is a village in Herefordshire, England (at ), in the parish of Ford and Stoke Prior. 

It is the site of a Romano-British settlement known as Black Caer Dun. A golden bracelet and ring have been found here, as well as many human remains. An 1885 account notes &quot;broken pieces of pottery were thickly scattered about and in one part of the railway cutting near the surface some 40 or of charred material 18 inches thick were observed.&quot;

Blackwardine is where Alfred Watkins first developed his theory of Ley lines on 30 June 1921. The place was excavated the same year.

<doc id="263137" wikidata="Q27539" url="?curid=263137" title="Daimler Company">
<text>The Daimler Company Limited ( ), before 1910 known as the Daimler Motor Company Limited, was an independent British motor vehicle manufacturer founded in London by H. J. Lawson in 1896, which set up its manufacturing base in Coventry. The company bought the right to the use of the Daimler name simultaneously from Gottlieb Daimler and Daimler-Motoren-Gesellschaft of Cannstatt, Germany. After early financial difficulty and a reorganisation of the company in 1904, the Daimler Motor Company was purchased by Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) in 1910, which also made cars under its own name before the Second World War. In 1933, BSA bought the Lanchester Motor Company and made it a subsidiary of the Daimler Company.

Daimler was awarded a Royal Warrant to provide cars to the British monarch in 1902; it lost this privilege in the 1950s after being supplanted by Rolls-Royce. Daimler occasionally used alternative technology: the Daimler-Knight engine which it further developed in the early twentieth century and used from 1909 to 1935, the worm gear final drive fitted from 1909 until after the Second World War, and their patented fluid flywheel used in conjunction with a Wilson preselector gearbox from 1930 to the mid-1950s.

Daimler tried to widen its appeal in the 1950s with a line of smaller cars at one end and opulent show cars at the other, stopped making Lanchesters, had a highly publicised removal of their chairman from the board, and developed and sold a sports car and a high-performance luxury saloon and limousine. BSA sold Daimler to Jaguar Cars in 1960, and Jaguar briefly continued Daimler&#x27;s line adding a Daimler variant of its Mark II sports saloon. Jaguar was then merged into the British Motor Corporation in 1966 and British Leyland in 1968. Under these companies, Daimler became an upscale trim level for Jaguar cars except for the 1968–1992 Daimler DS420 limousine, which had no Jaguar equivalent despite being fully Jaguar-based. When Jaguar Cars was split off from British Leyland in 1984, it retained the Daimler company and brand.

Ford bought Jaguar Cars in 1990 and under Ford it stopped using the Daimler marque in 2009 when the last X358 Daimler models were discontinued. The X351 Jaguar XJ took its place and there was no Daimler variant. Jaguar Cars remained in its ownership, and from 2000 accompanied by Land Rover, until they sold both Jaguar and Land Rover to Tata Motors in 2008, who formed Jaguar Land Rover as a subsidiary holding company for them. In 2013, Jaguar Cars was merged with Land Rover to form Jaguar Land Rover Limited, and the rights to the Daimler car brand were transferred to the newly formed British multinational car manufacturer Jaguar Land Rover.

==Origin==
===Simms and the Daimler engine===
Engineer Frederick Richard Simms was supervising construction of an aerial cableway of his own design for the Bremen Exhibition in 1889 when he saw tiny railcars powered by Gottlieb Daimler&#x27;s motors. Simms, who had been born to English parents in Hamburg and raised by them there, became friends with Daimler, an Anglophile who had worked from autumn 1861 to summer 1863 at Beyer, Peacock &amp; Company in Gorton, Manchester.

Simms introduced Daimler&#x27;s motors to England in 1890 to power launches. In an agreement dated 18 February 1891, he obtained British and Empire rights for the Daimler patents. That month, Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft lent Simms a motorboat with a 2 hp engine and an extra engine. In June 1891 Simms had set up a London office at 49 Leadenhall Street and founded Simms &amp; Co consulting engineers. In May 1892, the motorboat, which Simms had named &quot;Cannstatt&quot;, began running on the River Thames from Putney. After demonstrating a motor launch to The Honourable Evelyn Ellis, Simms&#x27;s motor launch business grew rapidly, but became endangered when solicitor Alfred Hendriks was found to have been illegally taking money from the company. Hendriks severed his connections with Simms &amp; Co. in February 1893. Simms&#x27; Daimler-related work was later moved into a new company, The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited, which was formed on 26 May 1893.

===Simms plans to make cars===
Following the success of Daimler-powered Peugeots and Panhards at the 1894 Paris–Rouen competition, Simms decided to open a motor car factory,

On 7 June 1895, Simms told the board of the Daimler Motor Syndicate that he intended to form The Daimler Motor Company Limited to acquire the British rights to the Daimler patents and to manufacture Daimler engines and cars in England. That month, he arranged for the syndicate to receive a ten per cent (10%) commission on all British sales of Daimler-powered Panhard &amp; Levassor cars.

At the same meeting Simms produced the first licence to operate a car under the Daimler patents. It was for a  hp Panhard &amp; Levassor that had been bought in France by The Honourable Evelyn Ellis, who had three Daimler motor launches moored by his home at Datchet. On 3 July, after Ellis bought the licence, the car was landed at Southampton and driven by Ellis to Micheldever near Winchester where Ellis met Simms and they drove together to Datchet. Ellis later drove it on to Malvern. This was the first long journey by motorcar in Britain. Simms later referred to the car as a &quot;Daimler Motor Carriage&quot;.

Later in 1895 Simms announced plans to form The Daimler Motor Company Limited and to build a brand-new factory, with delivery of raw materials by light rail, for 400 workmen making Daimler engines and motor carriages. Simms asked his friend Daimler to be consulting engineer to the new enterprise. Works premises at Eel Pie Island on the Thames where the Thames Electric and Steam Launch Company, owned by Andrew Pears of Pears Soap fame, had been making electrically powered motor launches, were purchased to be used to service Daimler-powered motor launches.

===Simms sells out to Lawson===
Investor Harry John Lawson had set out to use the British Motor Syndicate to monopolise motor car production in Britain by taking over every patent he could. As part of this goal, Lawson approached Simms on 15 October 1895, seeking the right to arrange the public flotation of the proposed new company and to acquire a large shareholding for his British Motor Syndicate. Welcomed by Simms, the negotiations proceeded on the basis that this new company should acquire The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited as a going concern, including the name and patent rights.

In order that the Daimler licences could be transferred from Simms to the new company, all the former partners would have to agree to the transfer. By this time, Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm Maybach had withdrawn from Daimler Motoren Gesellschaft&#x27;s business to concentrate on cars and engines for them. Simms offered to pay DMG £17,500 for the transfer and for a licence for Daimler and Maybach&#x27;s Phénix engine, which DMG did not own. Simms therefore insisted that the transfer be on the condition that Daimler and Maybach rejoined DMG. This was agreed in November 1895 and the Daimler-Maybach car business re-merged with DMG&#x27;s. Daimler was appointed DMG&#x27;s General Inspector and Maybach chief Technical Director. At the same time Simms became a director of DMG but did not become a director of the London company. According to Gustav Vischer, DMG&#x27;s business manager at the time, Simms getting Daimler to return to DMG was &quot;no mean feat&quot;.

The sale of Daimler Motor Syndicate to Lawson&#x27;s interests was completed by the end of November 1895. The shareholders of the Syndicate had made a profit of two hundred per cent (200%) on their original investment.
==Independent (1896–1910)==
===From starting to stability===

On 14 January 1896 Lawson incorporated The Daimler Motor Company Limited. A prospectus was issued on 15 February. The subscription lists opened on 17 February and closed, oversubscribed, the next day. The Daimler Motor Company Limited bought The Daimler Motor Syndicate Limited from Lawson&#x27;s British Motor Syndicate as a going concern. Simms was appointed consulting engineer to the new business but was not to be on the board of directors, possibly because he had become a director of the Cannstatt firm.

One of the duties assigned to Simms was to find a suitable location for the factory. Simms found the Trusty Oil Engine Works, a company in receivership whose six-acre site at Cheltenham included a foundry, a machine shop, and testing facilities. Simms recommended buying the works immediately since, with ready facilities and the availability of skilled workers, they could start up in a very short time. Instead, at the first statutory meeting of the company, held while Simms was overseas, Lawson persuaded the board to buy a disused four-storey cotton mill in Coventry which was owned by Lawson&#x27;s associate Ernest Terah Hooley. Despite Simms&#x27; later protest and pleas to sell the mill and buy the Trusty Oil Engine Works, Daimler stayed with the mill as the site of Britain&#x27;s first automobile factory.

Delayed delivery of machines kept the factory unfinished throughout 1896 and into 1897. During 1896 Daimler sold imported cars from companies for which Lawson held the licences. Cannstatt supplied engine parts but the delivery of working drawings were delayed for months. Four experimental cars were built in Coventry and a Panhard van was dismantled and reverse engineered. Some Daimler engines, with details redesigned by works manager J. S. Critchley, were also made in 1896.

The first car left the works in January 1897, fitted with a Panhard engine, followed in March by Daimler-engined cars. The first Coventry Daimler-engined product made its maiden run in March 1897. By mid-year they were producing three of their own cars a week and producing Léon Bollée cars under licence. Lawson claimed to have made 20 cars by July 1897 making the Daimler Britain&#x27;s first motor car to go into serial production, an honour that is also credited to Humber Motors who had also displayed, but in their case their production models, at the Stanley Cycle Show in London in 1896. The Daimlers had a twin-cylinder, 1526 cc engine, mounted at the front of the car, four-speed gearbox and chain drive to the rear wheels.
Because of Daimler&#x27;s financial difficulty in July 1897 Daimler began asking Lawson&#x27;s Great Horseless Carriage Company to settle its accounts with them. In the same month, they refused to send working drawings of their 4 hp motor frame to DMG in Canstatt. Lack of co-operation with the Canstatt firm caused Simms to resign as Daimler&#x27;s consulting engineer that month. Also in July 1897, the company sold their launch works at Eel Pie Island at a loss of £700 or more.

Ongoing difficulties with the Great Horseless Carriage Company and the British Motor Syndicate caused Lawson to resign from Daimler&#x27;s board on 7 October 1897. He was replaced as chairman by Henry Sturmey, who at the time was five days into a motor tour in his personal Daimler from John O&#x27;Groats to Land&#x27;s End. On arriving at Land&#x27;s End on 19 October, Sturmey became the first person to make that journey in a motor car.

Gottlieb Daimler resigned from the board of the Daimler Motor Company in July 1898 having never attended a board meeting. Sturmey opposed the appointment of a proposed successor who, according to Sturmey, held no shares and knew nothing about the automobile business. A committee was brought in to investigate the activities of the board and the company. The committee summed up the management of the business as being inefficient and not energetic and suggested that it be reorganised and run by a paid managing director. When Evelyn Ellis and another board member did not run for re-election, they were replaced by E. H. Bayley and Edward Jenkinson, with Bayley replacing Sturmey as chairman. Sturmey resigned in May 1899 after Bayley and Jenkinson had reorganised the business.

Simms, as a director of DMG, proposed a union between the Daimler Motor Company in Coventry and DMG in Cannstatt in mid-1900 but the reorganised company was not interested in the merger and turned the offer down.

Persistent financial troubles caused Daimler to be reorganised again in 1904. The previous company was wound up and a new company was formed to acquire the old one and pay its debts and winding-up costs.

Under the chairmanship of Sir Edward Jenkinson, Daimler hired American electrical engineer Percy Martin as works manager and socialite Undecimus Stratton as the head of the London depot, and promoted Ernest Instone to general manager. Jenkinson was succeeded in 1906 by Edward Manville, a consulting electrical engineer.

===Royal patronage===

Known as Britain&#x27;s oldest car manufacturers, Daimler was first associated with royalty in 1898 when the Prince of Wales, later Edward VII, was given a ride on a Daimler by John Douglas-Scott-Montagu later known as Lord Montagu of Beaulieu. Scott-Montagu, as a member of parliament, also drove a Daimler into the yard of the Palace of Westminster, the first motorised vehicle to be driven there.

Daimler had sold the Prince of Wales a mail phaeton in early 1900. In 1902, upon buying another Daimler, King Edward VII awarded Daimler a royal warrant as suppliers of motor cars.

Undecimus Stratton met E. G. Jenkinson, the chairman of Daimler, in 1903 when Jenkinson&#x27;s Daimler was stranded by the roadside. Upon seeing the stranded motorist, Stratton stopped his Daimler and offered assistance. Jenkinson was impressed by Stratton and by his motoring knowledge. At the time, Jenkinson was looking to replace the head of Daimler&#x27;s London depot, a particularly sensitive position because of the royal cars. Taking the position, Stratton soon found himself having to select better royal chauffeurs and mechanics. He quickly became an occasional motoring companion to the King. In 1908, through Stratton&#x27;s Royal connections, Daimler was awarded a &quot;Royal Appointment as suppliers of motor cars to the Court of Spain&quot; by King Alfonso XIII and a Royal Warrant as &quot;Motor Car Manufacturer to the Court of Prussia&quot; by Kaiser Wilhelm II. Stratton also sold Daimlers to the Sultan of Johor. In 1911, he spent some weekends at Sandringham tutoring the new Prince of Wales on the workings and driving of an automobile.

Stratton went into partnership with Daimler&#x27;s commercial manager Ernest Instone in 1921. Stratton and Instone took charge of the Daimler showrooms at 27 Pall Mall, naming the business Stratton-Instone. Stratton died in July 1929 after a brief illness. His successors and Instone bought out Daimler&#x27;s interest in 1930 and renamed the business Stratstone Limited. The following summer the future King Edward VIII rented Stratton&#x27;s house at Sunningdale from his widow.

Every British monarch from Edward VII to Elizabeth II has been driven in Daimler limousines. In 1950, after a persistent transmission failure on the King&#x27;s car, Rolls-Royce was commissioned to provide official state cars and as Daimlers retired they were not replaced by Daimlers. The current official state car is either one of a pair which were specially made for the purpose by Bentley, unofficial chauffeured transport is by Daimler. Elizabeth II&#x27;s own car for personal use was a 2008 Daimler Super Eight but she was also seen to drive herself in other smaller cars.

===Fluted radiator===
Since 1904, the fluted top surface to the radiator grille has been Daimler&#x27;s distinguishing feature. This motif developed from the heavily finned water-cooling tubes slung externally at the front of early cars. Later, a more conventional, vertical radiator had a heavily finned header tank. Eventually these fins were echoed on a protective grille shell and, even later, on the rear licence plate holder.

===Sleeve-valve engines===

Attracted by the possibilities of the &quot;Silent Knight&quot; engine Daimler&#x27;s chairman contacted Charles Yale Knight in Chicago and Knight settled in England near Coventry in 1907. Daimler bought rights from Knight &quot;for England and the colonies&quot; and shared ownership of the European rights, in which it took 60%, with Minerva of Belgium. Daimler contracted Dr Frederick Lanchester as their consultant for the purpose and a major re-design and refinement of Knight&#x27;s design took place in great secrecy. Knight&#x27;s design was made a practical proposition. When unveiled in September 1908 the new engine caused a sensation. &quot;Suffice it to say that mushroom valves, springs and cams, and many small parts, are swept away bodily, that we have an almost perfectly spherical explosion chamber, and a cast-iron sleeve or tube as that portion of the combustion chamber in which the piston travels.&quot;

The Royal Automobile Club held a special meeting to discuss the new engine, still silent but no longer &quot;Wholly Knight&quot;. The Autocar reported on &quot;its extraordinary combination of silence, flexibility and power.&quot; Daimler stopped making poppet-valve engines altogether. Under the observation of the Royal Automobile Club (RAC), two Daimler sleeve-valve engines were put through severe bench, road, and track tests and, upon being dismantled, showed no visible wear, earning Daimler the 1909 Dewar Trophy. Sales outran the works&#x27; ability to supply.

Daimler&#x27;s sleeve valve engines idle silently but they left a slight haze of oil smoke trailing behind them. These engines consumed oil at a rate of up to an Imperial gallon every 450  miles, oil being needed to lubricate the sleeves particularly when cold. However, by the standards of their day they required very little maintenance.

Daimler kept their silent sleeve-valve engines until the mid-1930s. The change to poppet valves began with the Fifteen of 1933.

===First fatal motor accident in the United Kingdom===
A Daimler 6 hp was involved in the first motor accident in the UK to be recorded as having involved the death of the driver. A young engineer was killed in 1899 when the rim of a rear wheel of the car he was driving collapsed under heavy braking in a turn on a sloping road in Harrow on the Hill. The driver and his four passengers were thrown from the car. One of the passengers fractured his skull in the accident and died in hospital three days later.
==Under BSA (1910–1960)==

===Acquisition by BSA===

Under an agreement dated 22 September 1910 the shareholders of The Daimler Motor Company Limited &quot;merged their holdings with those of the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA) group of companies,&quot; receiving five BSA shares in exchange for four ordinary Daimler shares and £1 5s plus accrued dividend for each £1 preference share. This deal was engineered by Dudley Docker, deputy-chairman of BSA, who was famous for previous successful business mergers.

Daimler, a manufacturer of motor vehicles, had a payroll of 4,116 workmen and 418 staff immediately before the merger. BSA produced rifles, ammunition, military vehicles, bicycles, motorcycles and some BSA-branded cars. The chairman of the combined group was Edward Manville, who had been chairman of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders – founded by Simms – since 1907.

However the merger was not a great success. By 1913 Daimler had a workforce of 5,000 workers which made only 1,000 vehicles a year.

===Commercial Division===

In 1911 Daimler had plans to create The Premier Motor Omnibus Company (running Daimler buses) and appoint Frank Searle (ex London General Omnibus Company) as the managing director. However plans had to be scrapped at the last moment, and instead the Daimler managing director, Percy Martin, created the Daimler commercial division, with Frank Searle as its head. Daimler had been involved with various commercial vehicle designs for some time, and this brought vans, trucks, buses, tractors and railcars under the same division head. All vehicles used the Daimler sleeve-valve petrol engines, many using the 105 hp 15.9 L sleeve-valve straight-six engine.

New product announcements followed rapidly, with the 36 hp tractor launched at the June 1911 Norwich Agricultural Show, and its larger 105 hp version, the Foster-Daimler tractor (a joint project with William Foster &amp; Co.) following in January 1912 (mainly destined for the South American market). Both used Daimler sleeve-valve engines, the larger 6-cylinder tractor having a small BSA starter engine. 

In January 1912, new commercial vehicles included a 1-ton delivery van, lorries from 2 to 5 ton and a 40 hp omnibus.

Buses and trucks were able to use the same chassis and engines and, as was common practice for commercial vehicles, then have bespoke bodywork fitted. The Metropolitan Electric Tramways ordering 350 double-decker buses in 1912 and engines were sold to the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC). The bus models were the 13 foot wheelbase CB (same chassis as the 4 ton truck) and the 12 foot wheelbase CC, both with 40 hp engines. With the onset of WW1 CC chassis production was stopped and CB production was ramped up for trucks for the military.

A half-ton delivery van was based on a 12 hp chassis similar to a car chassis.

The railcar project utilised 2 of the large six-cylinder engines. Daimler had created a railcar in 1904, and though it went into service briefly it was hardly a success. The new project in 1911 was of advanced design with the drive engines charging accumulators which could be used to provide a power boost, or to drive the vehicle in the event of engine failure. The bodywork was completed in 1913. The war interrupted the testing though it fared well, although it wasn&#x27;t a commercial success and in 1921 the railcar project was dropped.

There was a close link between the Associated Equipment Company (AEC) and Daimler commercial division. Daimler secured sole marketing rights for any AEC chassis other than those required by AEC&#x27;s owner (the London General Omnibus Company), and in exchange AEC were to fit Daimler engines in their chassis. This agreement was made in 1912, and continued until AEC war service vehicles had to have the Tylor engine fitted. In the late 1920s AEC and Daimler commercial division formed the Associated Daimler Company to build commercial vehicles. The association was dissolved in 1928 with each company retaining manufacture of its original products.
===Royal transport===

By 1914 Daimlers were used by royal families including those of Great Britain, Germany, Russia, Sweden, Japan, Spain, and Greece; &quot;its list of owners among the British nobility read like a digest of Debrett;&quot; the Bombay agent supplied Indian princes; the Japanese agent, Okura, handled sales in Manchuria and Korea.

===World War I work===

During World War I, the military took the normal production cars, lorries, buses and ambulances together with a scout army vehicle and engines used in ambulances, trucks, and double-decker buses. Special products included aero-engines and complete aircraft, tank and tractor engines and munitions.

The first aircraft engine manufactured by Daimler was the 80 hp Gnome Monosoupape rotary. With no drawings available to them, Daimler&#x27;s Gnome engines were reverse-engineered from an engine delivered to them on 7 August 1914. Daimler later built the RAF 1 and 1a air-cooled V8s, the RAF 4 and 4a V12s, the Le Rhone rotary, and the Bentley BR2 rotary alongside other manufacturers. Production of RAF 4 engines gave Daimler experience in building V12 engines which would be appreciated when they later designed and built &quot;Double-Six&quot; V12 engines for their large cars.

Daimler trained air force mechanics at its works and its training methods became the standard for all manufacturers instructing RAF mechanics.

Having its own body shop, Daimler had the woodworking ability to build complete aircraft. By the end of 1914, they had built 100 units of the Royal Aircraft Factory B.E.2c. These were followed by the BE12 and RE8. Daimler purchased an open field beside their Radford factory, cleared the site, and made it available to the Government, who turned it into the main RAF testing ground for aircraft built in the Coventry district. Although Daimler tooled up for production of the Royal Aircraft Factory F.E.4 bomber the aircraft was cancelled due to poor performance. The last wartime aircraft produced was the Airco DH.10 Amiens bomber when they were building 80 aeroplanes a month.
Before the war, Daimler had been making 105 hp engines for the Foster-Daimler tractor which was manufactured by William Foster &amp; Co. in a joint venture with Daimler for the South American market. These tractors were developed into artillery tractors to haul howitzers. Production of the artillery tractors began on 3 December 1914. These engines were later used for the first British tanks ever built, the prototypes &quot;Little Willie&quot; and &quot;Mother&quot; and later in the production Mark I tank. One major difficulty for the tanks was the fine oil haze above their Daimler engines which the enemy quickly learned meant tanks were operating nearby if out of sight. The early tanks weighed up to 28 tons. They were all Daimler powered. The Mark IV tank - the first major improvement in design - had uprated engines delivering 125 hp; these engines had aluminium pistons and are believed to have been designed by W. O. Bentley while he was working on the Bentley BR1 rotary engine in Coventry.

Daimler made more twelve-inch (305 mm) shell casings than any other private business in the country, with a peak production of more than 2000 casings a day. Each was machined from a 990 lb forging down to a finished weight of 684 lb.
===Civil aviation===
After the Armistice it was decided that Daimler Hire should extend its luxury travel services to include charter aircraft through a new enterprise, Daimler Air Hire. Following the take-over of Airco and its subsidiaries in February 1920 services included scheduled services London-Paris as well as &quot;Taxi Planes&quot; to &quot;anywhere in Europe&quot;. In 1922, under the name of Daimler Airway services extended to scheduled flights London to Berlin and places between. Frank Searle, managing director of Daimler Hire and its subsidiaries moved with his deputy Humphery Wood into the new national carrier Imperial Airways at its formation on 1 April 1924. Searle and Wood and their Daimler Airway machines formed the core of Imperial Airways operations.

===Lanchester acquisition and badging===

The bulk of Daimler&#x27;s shareholding in its subsidiary Daimler Hire Limited was sold to the Thomas Tilling Group in 1930. and, in January 1931, Daimler completed the purchase of The Lanchester Motor Company Limited. The new Lanchester 15/18 model introduced in 1931 was fitted with Daimler&#x27;s fluid flywheel transmission.

Although at first they produced separate ranges of cars with the Daimler badge appearing mainly on the larger models, by the mid-1930s the two were increasingly sharing components leading to the 1936 Lanchester 18/Daimler Light 20 differing in little except trim and grille.

This marketing concept already employed with their BSA range of cars continued to the end of Lanchester and BSA car production. Some very important customers, including the Duke of York and at least two Indian princes, were supplied with big Daimler limousines with Lanchester grilles. The Daimler range was exceptionally complex in the 1930s with cars using a variety of six- and eight-cylinder engines with capacities from 1805 cc in the short lived 15 of 1934 to the 4624 cc 4.5-litre of 1936.

===Review of BSA management before the Second World War===

The divisiveness of the Daimler board did not end with the BSA takeover, but continued into the board of BSA. Despite this, Daimler prospered until the late 1920s, increasing its profits and its reputation. Along with an apprenticeship programme that was among the best in the British industry at the time, they attracted a large number of pupils out of public schools. During the First World War, Daimler&#x27;s labour force grew from 4,000 to 6,000 men.

The acquisition of Airco in February 1920 was a financial disaster for the BSA group. Percy Martin had been strongly in favour of the purchase, including Airco&#x27;s extensive production facilities near London, and no one thought to examine Airco&#x27;s true circumstances, leading to liabilities in excess of £1.3 million. All dividends were passed from 1920 to 1924.

By 1930 the BSA Group&#x27;s primary activities were BSA motorcycles and Daimler vehicles. However, all the quality car businesses experienced financial difficulties in the late 1920s. Daimler&#x27;s situation seemed particularly serious. Sales fell sharply in 1927–1928, a period of losses ensued and no dividends were paid between 1929 and 1936. The sleeve valve engine was outdated, Daimler&#x27;s production methods had become old-fashioned, they had an extravagantly large range of products. Their bankers noted the decreasing sales volume, the poor performance for price and the need for up-to-date machine tool equipment. Stratton-Instone&#x27;s dominance of distribution was removed and other outlets arranged. The interests in Singer and the Daimler Hire business were sold and Lanchester bought. The in-house bodywork department was closed and by the spring of 1931 car production ceased, only commercial vehicle production and aero engine work kept Daimler in business.


Laurence Pomeroy joined Damler in late 1926, at first working on commercial vehicles but from 1928 he worked at the products of the main Daimler operation. Pomeroy introduced redesigned poppet valve engines with the Daimler Fifteen in September 1932, developed new models of Daimlers, and recommended what became the September 1932 introduction of the small BSA and Lanchester Tens with poppet valve engines to help Daimler survive the depression. According to Martin, these actions rescued the business from total collapse in 1932. In 1934, the Pomeroy-designed poppet-valve Straight-Eights replaced the Daimler Double-Six sleeve-valve V12s without controversy or embarrassment, thereby being a personal triumph for Pomeroy.

===Management shift===
From before the merger of Daimler into the BSA group the core of Daimler&#x27;s management was formed by chairman Edward Manville, works manager Percy Martin, and sales manager Ernest Instone, who left Daimler in 1921 to start auto dealer Stratton-Instone, and was responsible for Daimler sales in England and Wales thereafter. Instone died in 1932, Manville died in 1933, and Martin, who in January 1934 replaced Alexander Roger, Manville&#x27;s replacement, as chairman, retired in 1935. In May 1936 Laurence Pomeroy was fired as managing director of Daimler with immediate effect. Daimler was not paying dividends and the 1936 BSA shareholders&#x27; meetings were stormy. Attempted solutions had included the Lanchester acquisition and the introduction of smaller cars, the lower-priced 10 hp Lanchester and its matching but six-cylinder stable-mate the Daimler Fifteen (later DB17 and DB18) introduced in the early thirties. This particular product line as the Lanchester Fourteen and Daimler Conquest was to run through to almost the very end.

Edward H. W. Cooke attempted a revival and from 1937 introduced saloons with a freshness of design new to Daimler. The new products had successes in competitions and rallies. His policy was proved sound but another war, post-war austerity and yet more boardroom battles, this time in public, seemed to put an end to Daimler&#x27;s once-proud business.

===Daimler&#x27;s semi-automatic transmissions===

Daimler started testing the &quot;Fluidrive&quot; system in a bus chassis in 1928. This system, patented by Harold Sinclair in 1926, applied Hermann Föttinger&#x27;s fluid flywheel to replace the clutch in the transmission systems of road vehicles. Daimler was initially interested in the fluid flywheel for use in commercial vehicles, but Martin decided to develop the system for use in passenger cars as well. Martin and Pomeroy originally intended to use the fluid flywheel with a conventional gearbox. Their consultant, Frederick Lanchester, warned them that putting a car with that combination on the market would be &quot;a terribly big gambling risk,&quot; and an accident in March 1929 where a Double-Six 30 with a prototype transmission damaged a garage in Devon after Pomeroy left it idling while in gear may have shown the nature of this risk. By October 1930, when Daimler introduced the fluid flywheel on their new Light Double-Six for an extra £50, it was used with the self changing gearbox developed by W. G. Wilson. Martin and the Daimler Company patented their refinements to Sinclair&#x27;s system in 1930.

By November 1933 the combination of fluid flywheel and Wilson preselector gearbox was used in all Daimler vehicles, &quot;ranging from 10 h.p. passenger cars to double-deck omnibuses&quot; according to the chairman&#x27;s report to the shareholders at their Annual General Meeting that month. According to the same report, &quot;more than 11,000 vehicles&quot; were using the transmission by that time. Daimler would continue to develop and use these transmissions until 1956, when Borg-Warner fully automatic units were offered initially as an alternative but later as standard.

The Lanchester Sprite, a 1.6 L car with a unit body and Hobbs fully automatic gearbox, was shown at the British International Motor Show at Earls Court in 1954. Problems with the transmission and other systems were never fully sorted out, and the Sprite was discontinued about two years later with only thirteen being built.

===Second World War work===

During the Second World War, Daimler turned again to military production. A four-wheel-drive scout car, known to the Army as the Dingo had a 2.5-litre engine and the larger Daimler Armoured Car powered by a 4.1-litre engine and armed with a 2-pounder gun were produced, both with six-cylinder power units, fluid flywheels and epicyclic gearboxes. These military vehicles incorporated various innovative features including disc brakes on all four wheels. The Dingo was designed by parent company BSA and took the name &quot;Dingo&quot; from an unsuccessful competitor submitted by Alvis.

During the war Daimler built more than 6,600 Scout Cars and some 2,700 Mk I and Mk II Armoured Cars. Daimler also provided tank components, including epicyclic gearboxes for 2,500 Crusader, Covenanter and Cavalier tanks. They built 74,000 Bren gun, initially at a workshop in their Coventry factory and, after the workshop was destroyed in the April 1941 raid, at a boot and shoe factory in Burton-on-Trent.

Instead of building complete aircraft as they had in World War I, Daimler built aircraft components, including 50,800 Bristol radial aero-engines—Mercury, Hercules and Pegasus—with full sets of parts for 9,500 more of these engines, propeller shafts for Rolls-Royce aero-engines, and 14,356 gun-turrets for bombers including their Browning machine guns. In all, Daimler produced more than 10 million aircraft parts during the war. All this production is Daimler&#x27;s alone excluding BSA&#x27;s other involvements.

Daimler&#x27;s peak workforce, 16,000 people, was reached in this period.

The original Sandy Lane plant, used as a government store, was destroyed by fire during intensive enemy bombing of Coventry, but there were by now &#x27;shadow factories&#x27; elsewhere in the city including one located at Brown&#x27;s Lane, Allesey. In 1952, Jaguar moved to Brown&#x27;s Lane which became the principal Jaguar car plant for several decades. The factory has since been closed but areas retained for smaller Jaguar operations and housing together with development of industrial buildings. The Daimler Radford plant has become a large housing estate.

After that war Daimler produced the Ferret armoured car, a military reconnaissance vehicle based on the innovative 4.1-litre-engined armoured car they had developed and built during the war, which has been used by over 36 countries.

===Postwar decline===

Winston Churchill campaigned for the 1945 and 1950 general elections in the DB18 two-door drophead coupé he had ordered in 1939. The government ordered new limousines for the commanding officers of the occupying forces. New straight-eights were supplied to the former colonies for the planned royal tours.

The first Daimler limousines to be delivered after the war went to embassies and consulates in Europe and to the Lieutenant-Governors of Jersey and Guernsey. These were Straight-Eights built largely from pre-war stock. The first post-war model was the Eighteen, a development of the pre-war Fifteen using the Scout Car&#x27;s 2.5 L engine with a new high-compression cylinder head. The model used curved glass in its side windows which were framed by chromed metal channels instead of the thick pillars that were usual at the time. Because of ongoing restrictions on steel, many of the Eighteen&#x27;s body panels were made from aluminium. The first post-war Lanchester, the Ten, looked like an enlarged Ford Prefect and its body was made in the same factory, Briggs Motor Bodies on the Ford Dagenham site.
Despite the austerity of the times, Daimler celebrated the 1946 golden jubilee of the founding of the business with a luncheon at the Savoy, at which they announced the pricing of the Daimler Eighteen and the Lanchester Ten. Production of large eight-seat limousines, the six-cylinder DE 27 and the eight-cylinder DE36, began in March 1946. These were among the first series-built cars with electrically operated windows. They were also the first Daimler cars since 1909 to use bevel gear final drive instead of Daimler&#x27;s usual worm final drive, and the DE 36 was the last straight-eight automobile to be manufactured in Britain. The DE 27 chassis was also used in the Daimler Ambulance with bodies by Barker and Hooper.

Foreign monarchs, including the Queen of the Netherlands, the King of Thailand, The Aga Khan (and Prince Aly Khan), the Emperor of Ethiopia, the Prince of Monaco, and the King of Afghanistan, re-ordered to replenish their fleets.

Then in June 1947 the purchase tax was doubled on cars costing more than £1,000, with home market sales already having been restricted to cars for &quot;essential purposes&quot;. Petrol remained rationed; initially ten gallons a month, the monthly ration was increased to fifteen gallons in July 1946, but was reduced again late in the summer of 1947. Princess Elizabeth took her -litre coupé, a 21st -birthday gift from her father, to Malta, where her new husband was stationed. The King took delivery of a new open tourer straight-eight in March 1949. In the commodities boom caused by the 1950 Korean War Australasian woolgrowers reported the new electrically operated limousine-division to be &#x27;just the thing&#x27; if over-heated sheepdogs licked the back of a driver&#x27;s ears. A DE 27 limousine given to Princess Elizabeth by the Royal Air Force as a wedding present was traded for a Rolls-Royce when its transmission failed.

Until the early 1950s the British aristocracy, like British royalty, preferred Daimlers because they saw Rolls-Royces as &quot;flashy&quot;.

Rolls-Royce built the straight-eight Phantom IV solely for royalty and heads of state. Former Daimler customers, including British royals and the Aga Khan, switched to the Phantom IV, while the Emperor of Ethiopia and the King and Queen of Greece ordered coachbuilt six-cylinder Silver Wraiths.

====Consorts discounted====

Sir Bernard Docker, chairman of the parent company, took the extra responsibility of Daimler&#x27;s managing director in January 1953 when James Leek was unable to continue through illness. Car buyers were still waiting for the new (Churchill) government&#x27;s easing of the &#x27;temporary&#x27; swingeing purchase tax promised in the lead up to the snap-election held during the 1951 Earl&#x27;s Court Motor Show. Lady Docker told her husband to rethink his marketing policies. 3-litre Regency production was stopped. In the hope of keeping 4,000+ employed the Consort price was dropped from 4 February 1953 to the expected new tax-inclusive level.
Stagnation of all the British motor industry was relieved by the reduction of purchase tax in the April 1953 budget. Daimler announced the introduction of the moderately sized Conquest in May (apparently developed in just four months from the four-cylinder Lanchester 14 or Leda with a Daimler grille).

Daimler and Lanchester (there were no more BSA cars) struggled after the War, producing too many models with short runs and limited production, and frequently selling too few of each model, while Jaguar seemed to know what the public wanted and expanded rapidly. Daimler produced heavy, staid, large and small luxury cars with a stuffy, if sometimes opulent image. Jaguar produced lower quality cars at a remarkably low price, designed for enthusiasts.

The BSA group&#x27;s leadership of the world&#x27;s motorcycle market was eventually lost to Japanese manufacturers.

====Lady Docker&#x27;s Daimlers====
Sir Bernard Docker was the managing director of BSA from early in WWII, and married Norah, Lady Collins in 1949. Nora was twice-widowed and wealthy in her own right. This was her third marriage. She had originally been a successful dance hall hostess. Lady Docker took an interest in her husband&#x27;s companies and became a director of Hooper, the coachbuilders.

Daughter of an unsuccessful Birmingham car salesman Lady Docker could see that the Daimler cars, no longer popular with the royal family, were in danger of becoming an anachronism in the modern world. She took it upon herself to raise Daimler&#x27;s profile, but in an extravagant fashion, by encouraging Sir Bernard to produce show cars.
The first was the 1951 &quot;Golden Daimler&quot;, an opulent touring limousine, in 1952, &quot;Blue Clover&quot;, a two-door sportsmans coupe, in 1953 the &quot;Silver Flash&quot; based on the 3-litre Regency chassis, and in 1954 &quot;Stardust&quot;, redolent of the &quot;Gold Car&quot;, but based on the DK400 chassis as was what proved to be her Paris 1955 &quot;grande finale&quot;, a 2-door coupé she named &quot;Golden Zebra&quot;, the &quot;last straw&quot; for the Tax Office and now on permanent display at The Hague.

At the same time Lady Docker earned a reputation for having rather poor social graces when under the influence, and she and Sir Bernard were investigated for failing to correctly declare the amount of money taken out of the country on a visit to a Monte Carlo casino. Sir Bernard was instantly dumped &quot;for absenteeism&quot; by the Midland Bank board without waiting for the court case. Norah drew further attention. She ran up large bills and presented them to Daimler as business expenses but some items were disallowed by the Tax Office. The publicity attached to this and other social episodes told on Sir Bernard&#x27;s standing as some already thought the cars too opulent and vulgar for austere post-war Britain. To compound Sir Bernard&#x27;s difficulty, the royal family shifted allegiance to Rolls-Royce. By the end of 1960 all the State Daimlers had been sold and replaced by Rolls-Royces.

===Turner&#x27;s engines===
Jack Sangster sold his motorcycle companies Ariel and Triumph to BSA in 1951 and joined their board. In 1956 Sangster was elected chairman, defeating Sir Bernard 6 votes to 3. After a certain amount of electioneering by the Dockers an extraordinary shareholders&#x27; meeting backed the board decision and Bernard and Norah left buying a brace of Rolls-Royces as they went registering them as ND5 and BD9. Many important European customers turned out to have been Docker friends and did not re-order Daimler cars.
Sangster promptly made Edward Turner head of the automotive division which as well as Daimler and Carbodies (London Taxicab manufacturers) included Ariel, Triumph, and BSA motorcycles. Turner designed the lightweight hemi head Daimler 2.5 &amp; 4.5 Litre V8 Engines. The small engine was used to power a production version of an apprentice&#x27;s exercise, the very flexible Dart and the larger engine installed in the Majestic Major, a relabelled Majestic. Under Sangster Daimler&#x27;s vehicles became a little less sober and more performance oriented. The Majestic Major proved an agile high-speed cruiser on the new motorways. Bill Boddy described the SP250 as unlikely to stir the memories of such ghosts as haunt the tree-lined avenues near Sandringham, Balmoral and Windsor Castle.
The two excellent Turner V8 engines disappeared with British Leyland&#x27;s first rationalisation, the larger in 1968 and the smaller a year later.
==Buses 1911–1973==
A significant element of Daimler production was bus chassis, mostly for double deckers. Daimler had been interested in the commercial vehicle market from 1904. In 1906, it produced, using the &quot;Auto-Mixte&quot; patents of Belgian Henri Pieper, a petrol-electric vehicle and on 23 May 1906 registered Gearless Motor Omnibus Co. Limited. It was too heavy. Following the introduction of Daimler-Knight sleeve-valve engines re-designed for Daimler by Dr Frederick Lanchester Lanchester also refined the Gearless design and it re-emerged in 1910 as the KPL (Knight-Pieper-Lanchester) omnibus, an advanced integral petrol electric hybrid. The KPL bus had four-wheel brakes and steel unitary body/chassis construction. Failure to produce the KPL set bus design back twenty years.

Introduction of the KPL was stopped by a patent infringement action brought by London General Omnibus&#x27;s associate Tilling-Stevens in early May 1911 when just twelve KPL buses had been built. This was just after Daimler had poached LGOC&#x27;s Frank Searle and announced him to be general manager of its new London bus service which would be using its new KPL type to compete directly with LGOC.

Some of LGOC&#x27;s vehicles used Daimler engines. With the collapse of Daimler&#x27;s plans, Searle, an engineer and designer of the LGOC X-type and AEC B-type bus, instead joined Daimler&#x27;s commercial vehicle department. Reverting to (before LGOC) omnibus salesman, Searle rapidly achieved some notable sales. 100 to Metropolitan Electric Tramways and 250 to LGOC&#x27;s new owner, the Underground Electric Railways Company of London.

First Searle designed for Daimler a 34-seater with gearbox transmission (the KPL used electric motors each side), very like the B-Type and it was introduced by Daimler in early 1912. The main difference from what became the AEC B-Type was the use of Daimler&#x27;s sleeve-valve engine. In June 1912 what had been LGOC&#x27;s manufacturing plant was hived off as AEC. Between 1913 and 1916 AEC built some Daimler models under contract and Daimler sold all AEC vehicles which were surplus to LGOC needs. After war service, now Colonel Searle, moved to Daimler Hire Limited and its involvement in aviation. The Searle models were developed after World War I, but, from 1926 to 1928, Daimler entered into a joint venture, with AEC vehicles being badged as Associated Daimler, or ADC&#x27;s.

Daimler&#x27;s CO chassis became the main model in the 1930s, followed by a similar, but heavier, CW &#x27;austerity&#x27; model produced during the Second World War (100 with the Gardner 5LW engine (CWG5), the rest with the AEC 7.7-litre engine – CWA6) and in post-war years, production worked through the Daimler CV to the long-running Daimler CR Fleetline, built from 1960 to 1980 (CVG5 and CVG6 had been a common type of bus in Hong Kong between 1950 and 1988 and Fleetline had also become a major type of bus in Hong Kong until 1995). Small numbers of single deck vehicles were also built. Many British bus operators bought substantial numbers of the vehicles and there were also a number built for export. The standard London double-decker bus bought from 1970 to 1978 was the Daimler Fleetline.

Daimler buses were fitted with proprietary diesel engines, the majority by the Gardner company, of Eccles, Lancashire, although there were a few hundred Daimler diesels built in the 1940s &amp; 1950s, and the Leyland O.680 was offered as an option on the Fleetline (designated CRL6) after the merger with Leyland. The bus chassis were also fitted with bodywork built by various outside contractors, as is standard in the British bus industry, so, at a casual glance, there is no real identifying feature of a Daimler bus, apart from the badges (Front engined Daimler buses retained the distinctive fluted radiator grille top). The last Daimler Fleetline was built at the traditional Daimler factory in Radford, Coventry, in 1973. After that date, the remaining buses were built at the Leyland factory in Farington, Lancashire, the final eight years of Fleetline production being badged as Leylands. The last Fleetline built was bodied by Eastern Coach Works in 1981.

During that Jaguar-owned period 1960–1968, Daimler became the second-largest (after Leyland) double-decker bus manufacturer in Britain, with the &quot;Fleetline&quot; model. At the same time, Daimler made trucks and motorhomes. BMH merged with the Leyland Motor Corporation to give the British Leyland Motor Corporation in 1968. Production of Daimler buses in Coventry ceased in 1973 when production of its last bus product (the Daimler Fleetline) was transferred to Leyland plant in Farington. Daimler stayed within BLMC and its subsequent forms until 1982, at which point Jaguar (with Daimler) was demerged from BL as an independent manufacturer.
* Daimler Freeline 1951 to 1964
* Daimler Fleetline 1960 to 1983
* Daimler Roadliner 1962 to 1972

==Trolleybuses 1936–51==
In 1936 Daimler launched a range of trolleybus chassis, and were one of the last British chassis manufacturers to enter this field – only BUT were later. There were two basic models, both fitted with Metropolitan Vickers (MV) electrical equipment: one with four wheels (model CTM4) suitable for bodywork up to long, the other with six wheels (model CTM6) for bodywork up to long. Including some demonstrators, 22 of the CTM4 model and three of the CTM6 were built during 1936–38, all being fitted with double-deck bodywork by several different coachbuilders. The biggest customers for the CTM4 were West Hartlepool Corporation, which bought fourteen, and Derby Corporation, which bought six. None were produced during World War 2, and when the trolleybuses were reintroduced in 1949, either Crompton Parkinson (CP) or English Electric (EE) electrical equipment were available as alternatives to MV, which was still available. The model codes consisted of the letters CT for Commercial Trolleybus, followed by a letter (C, E or M) denoting the manufacturer of the electrical equipment (CP, EE or MV respectively), and a figure for the number of wheels. There were only three customers for the relaunched range: Glasgow Corporation bought thirty CTM6; Rotherham Corporation bought eighteen CTC6 and 26 CTE6; whilst eighteen CTM4 were exported to Pretoria, South Africa. Those for Rotherham were given single-deck bodywork, the others were all double-deck. Production ceased in 1951, at a time when the market for trolleybuses was in decline; including the 25 built in 1936–38, there were a total of 117 Daimler trolleybuses.

==Owned by Jaguar Cars (1960–1966)==

In May 1960, the Daimler business was purchased from BSA by Jaguar Cars for £3.4 million. William Lyons was looking to expand manufacture, wanted the manufacturing facilities and had to decide what to do with the existing Daimler vehicles.

Jaguar had been refused planning permission for a new factory in the area in which it wanted it to be. Daimler had shrunk to representing just 15% of BSA group turnover in 1959–1960 and BSA wished to dispose of its motoring interests. Jaguar stated publicly that it would continue production of the existing range of Daimler, that it would continue normal research and development for future Daimler products, and that it would expand Daimler markets in Britain and overseas.

Jaguar put a Daimler 4.5 L V8 in a Mark X and tested it at the Motor Industry Research Association (MIRA). With an inefficient prototype exhaust, the car went up to 135 mph on MIRA&#x27;s banked track, faster than the production Mark X.

Jaguar discontinued the six-cylinder Majestic in 1962 and the SP250 in 1964, but Daimler&#x27;s core product, the old-fashioned, heavy but fast 4.5 L V8 Majestic Major, was continued throughout Jaguar&#x27;s independent ownership of Daimler. In 1961, Daimler introduced the DR450, a long-wheelbase limousine version of the Majestic Major. The DR450 also continued in production beyond the end of Jaguar&#x27;s independent ownership of Daimler. 864 examples of the long-wheelbase DR450 were sold, as opposed to 1180 examples of the Majestic Major saloon.

The 4.5-litre saloon and limousine were the last Daimlers not designed by Jaguar.

===Jaguar-based Daimlers===

Apart from the DR450 limousine, new models under Lyons control were the result of negotiations between Lyons and the executives of Daimler distributor Stratstone Ltd. In exchange for a small Daimler in the tradition of the Consort and the Conquest, Stratstone gave up their Volkswagen franchise. Lyons&#x27; response was the 2.5 V8, a more luxurious Jaguar Mark 2 with the V8 engine from the SP250, automatic transmission, different badges, and a grille with a fluted top. Despite the obvious Jaguar heritage, motor journalist S. C. H. Davis wrote of the car&#x27;s &quot;marked character&quot; and claimed, &quot;This is not a Jaguar with a Daimler radiator grille and name plate. It can stand on its own.&quot;
While the 2.5 V8, later renamed the V8-250 under new ownership, became the most popular car Daimler ever produced, it was not enough to establish brand loyalty. Unlike Jaguar, whose wide range of models allowed sixty per cent (60%) of new Jaguars to be sold in exchange for Jaguars, few customers traded old 2.5 V8s for new ones. Most 2.5 V8 buyers were trading up from the bigger Ford, Wolseley, or Rover cars.

James Smillie, chairman of Stratstone, made Lyons aware of this situation in 1965. Lyons responded by preparing a Daimler-ised version of the upcoming Jaguar 420 and presenting it to Smillie and Stratstone managing director John Olley. Lyons asked the Stratstone executives what it should be called; Smillie suggested &quot;Sovereign&quot; while Olley suggested &quot;Royale&quot;. Despite Lyons stating his preference for &quot;Royale&quot; at the meeting, the company decided on &quot;Sovereign&quot; two months later. The Sovereign was launched in October 1966 to fill the gap between the 2.5 V8 and the Majestic Major.
==Owned by BMH (1966–1968)==
Jaguar was taken over by British Motor Corporation (BMC) in 1966 and a few months later BMC was renamed British Motor Holdings (BMH).

===Lyons&#x27; reasons and reactions===
Though Jaguar had diversified by adding, after Daimler, Guy trucks and Coventry-Climax to their group they remained dependent on Pressed Steel for bodies. Once BMC had taken control of Pressed Steel Lyons felt compelled to submit to the BMC takeover. Lyons remained anxious to see that Jaguar maintained its own identity and came to resent the association with British Leyland. He was delighted by Sir John Egan&#x27;s accomplishments and by the new independence arranged in 1984.

===End of Daimler brand in the United States===
BMH&#x27;s dealer network in the United States stopped importing Daimlers in 1967, claiming that there was insufficient funds in the group advertising budget to market all of BMH&#x27;s brands in the US.

==Owned by British Leyland (1968–1984)==

===Daimler DS420 Limousine===
The Daimler DS420 Limousine was introduced in 1968 to replace their Daimler DR450 and BMC&#x27;s Vanden Plas Princess. The DS420 used a Jaguar Mk X unitary carcass with a restyled roof and a floor pan extended by 21 inches behind the front seat and strengthened. The extension of the Mark X unit bodies was done by Motor Panels, a subsidiary of Rubery Owen. The floor pan with mechanicals was available to coachbuilders as a rolling chassis for use with specialised bodywork, usually as hearses; Startin of Birmingham built more than 300 DS420-based hearses. Finishing from the bare metal, including final assembly and trimming the interior, was done by Vanden Plas, who had earlier made the Princess for BMC.

The DS420 was withdrawn from production in 1992. From 1986 it had been the last production automobile to use the William Heynes, designed Jaguar XK6 engine. The last DS420-based Startin hearse was delivered on 9 February 1994 to Mr. Slack, a funeral director in Cheshire.

Though based entirely on Jaguar components, the DS420 was unique to Daimler. These limousines, wedding and funeral cars (and the hearses made by independent coachbuilders) are now the Daimlers most remembered.

===Daimler Sovereign, Daimler Double-Six===

These were the first series of vehicles that were badge-engineered Jaguars (XJ Series), but given a more luxurious and upmarket finish.
For example, the Daimler Double-Six was a Jaguar XJ-12, the Daimler badge and fluted top to its grille and boot handle being the only outward differences from the Jaguar, with more luxurious interior fittings and extra standard equipment marking it out on the inside.

===Chairmen===

One strategy to sell Daimlers was through fleet sales of Jaguars to boards of directors; Jaguar would offer to include a more prestigious Daimler for the chairman.

From 1972 to 1974 the chairman of Jaguar Cars was Lofty England, who began his career in the automotive industry as a Daimler apprentice from 1927 to 1932.

===Fluted grilles in Continental Europe and the US===

The Daimler name was dropped in Europe in the 1980s, while Jaguar adopted the Sovereign designation. This caused a great demand for imported Daimler parts as &quot;conversion kits&quot; to convert Jaguars into Daimlers. Deducing from this &quot;conversion kit&quot; market that there was still a demand for Daimler cars, Jaguar Cars returned the Daimler brand to Europe at the end of 1985.

Meanwhile, in the United States, Jaguar marketed the &quot;Vanden Plas&quot; with Daimler fluted grilles and licence plate housings.
==Owned by Jaguar Cars (1984–1989)==

If Jaguar was not to follow Daimler into becoming just another once iconic brand it needed immense amounts of capital to develop new models and build and equip new factories. This was beyond the ability of the BMH—now British Leyland—Group. It was decided to market the Jaguar business by first obtaining a separate London Stock Exchange listing to fix a price then ensuring any successful bid for all the listed shares in the whole business would be from a bidder with, or with access to, the necessary capital. That bidder proved to be Ford.

1984 produced a record group output of 36,856 cars but less than 5% were badged Daimler. Two years later Daimler&#x27;s share had reached 11.5%, and would have been almost 23% if the Vanden Plas sold in the US were included.

When the new XJ40 came into production in 1986, the Series III was kept in production a further six years to 1992 to carry the big Double Six engines.
==Owned by Ford (1989–2007)==
Ford Motor Company paid £1.6 billion to buy Jaguar in 1989 and with it the right to use the Daimler name. In 1992, Daimler (Ford) stopped production of the DS420 Limousine, the only model that was a little more than just a rebadged Jaguar.

When Ford bought Jaguar in 1990, the British press showed a coloured computer-generated image of a proposed &#x27;new&#x27; Daimler car – not merely a rebadged Jaguar XJ. At least one related project has been documented.

Daimler remained the flagship Jaguar product in every country except the US, where the top Jaguar is known as the &quot;XJ Vanden Plas&quot; – Jaguar may have feared that the American market would confuse Jaguar Daimler with Daimler AG.

===Century===
Daimler&#x27;s centenary was celebrated in 1996 by the production of a special edition: 100 Double Six and 100 straight-six cars, each with special paint and other special finishes including electrically adjustable rear seats.

The single 2-door 4-seater convertible built in 1996 to commemorate Daimler&#x27;s centenary and called Daimler Corsica was based on the Daimler Double-Six saloon. The prototype, which lacked an engine, had all the luxury features of the standard saloon but a shorter wheelbase. Painted &quot;Seafrost&quot; it was named after a 1931 Daimler Double-Six with a body by Corsica. Jaguar Daimler Heritage Trust have commissioned it to operate as a fully functional road-legal car and it is on display at The Collection Centre at the British Motor Museum at Gaydon, Warwickshire, England.
===Daimler Super V8===

1997 saw the end of production of the Double Six. It was superseded by the introduction of a (Jaguar) V8 engine and the new car was given the model name Mark II XJ. The engine was the only significant change from the previous XJ40. The replacement for the Double Six was the supercharged Super V8, the supercharger to compensate for the loss of one-third of the previous engine&#x27;s capacity.



===Daimler Super Eight===
After a three-year break a new Daimler, the Super Eight, was presented in July 2005. It had a new stressed aluminium monocoque/chassis-body with a 4.2 L V8 supercharged engine which produced and a torque rating of at 3500 rpm. This car was derived from the Jaguar XJ (X350).

==Owned by Tata (2007–present)==
At the end of 2007 (the formal announcement was delayed until 25 March 2008), it became generally known that India&#x27;s Tata Group had completed arrangements to purchase Jaguar (including Daimler) and Land Rover.

Tata had spoken to the press of plans to properly relaunch England&#x27;s oldest car marque. In July 2008 Tata Group, the current owners of Jaguar and Daimler, announced they were considering transforming Daimler into &quot;a super-luxury marque to compete directly with ultra luxury companies like Bentley and Rolls-Royce&quot;.

An application to register the Daimler name as a trademark in the US was rejected in 2009.

==Current status==
&quot;The Daimler Company Limited&quot;, now The Daimler Motor Company Limited, is still registered as active and accounts are filed each year though it is currently marked &quot;non-trading&quot;. Until 20 December 1988 its name was The Daimler Company Limited.

Before 5 October 2007, Jaguar, while still controlled by Ford, reached agreement to permit the then de-merging DaimlerChrysler to extend its use of the name &quot;Daimler&quot;. The announcement of this agreement was delayed until the end of July 2008 and made by Jaguar&#x27;s new owner, Tata.

By 2007, Jaguar&#x27;s use of the Daimler brand was limited to one model, the Super Eight, which was to be the last Daimler model to be produced.

In 2009, Jaguar lost the right to trademark the Daimler name in the United States.

<text>In demonology, Furcas (also spelled Forcas) is a Knight of Hell (the rank of Knight is unique to him), and rules 20 of demons. He teaches Philosophy, Astronomy (Astrology to some authors), Rhetoric, Logic, Chiromancy and Pyromancy.
Furcas (also known as Ren Vacca) is depicted as a strong old man with white hair and a long white beard, who rides a horse while holding a sharp weapon (pitch fork).

Notably, the 1563 edition says Forcas is an alias of the demon Foras, but in the 1583 edition of &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum,&quot; Forcas is established as a unique demon separate from Foras. According to a translation by Joseph H. Peterson:

The etymology of his name may be derived from the Latin word &quot;furca&quot;, meaning fork, or from Greco-Roman also meaning a sepulchre (tomb).

Furcas is portrayed as a female teacher with a wide array of magical knowledge in Welcome to Demon School! Iruma-kun.

<doc id="263149" wikidata="Q663171" url="?curid=263149" title="Gaap">
<text>Gaap (also Tap, Coap, Taob or Goap) is a demon that is described in demonological grimoires such as &quot;the Lesser Key of Solomon&quot;, Johann Weyer&#x27;s &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot;, and the Munich Manual of Demonic Magic, as well as Jacques Collin de Plancy&#x27;s &quot;Dictionnaire Infernal&quot;,

==Demon==
These works describe Gaap as a prince in human form who incites love. The Munich Manual also says that &quot;Taob&quot; also provides medical care for women, transforms them to make it easier to get to a lover, renders them infertile, and rules twenty-five legions of spirits. The other sources instead describe Gaap as a president, giving him the power to teach philosophy and liberal arts, make others invisible, steal familiars from other magicians, make men stupid, and carry men between kingdoms; in addition to ruling sixty-six legions of demons. Johann Weyer also connects Gaap to necromancers, and states that he was first called upon by Noah&#x27;s son Ham, along with Beleth. He was of the order of &quot;potestates&quot;.

Gaap (or &quot;Goap&quot;) is also one of the four cardinal spirits, of the south in the Lesser Key of Solomon, the west in the Pseudomonarchia Daemonum.

In the &quot;Livre des Esperitz&quot;, Gaap (as &quot;Caap&quot;) is still a prince, but appears as a knight, brings gold and silver anywhere, and rules twenty legions of spirits.

Accomplished occultist Carroll &quot;Poke&quot; Runyon treats Gaap and Coap as different entities, although they were historically the same figure.

According to Thomas Rudd, Gaap is opposed by the &quot;Shem HaMephorash&quot; angel Ieuiah.

==Modern depictions==
* Gaap is depicted in the visual novel &quot;Umineko When They Cry&quot; as a female demon who serves the witch Beatrice. She has the ability to teleport herself and others.
* Gaap is played by Paapa Essiedu in the 2023 &quot;Demon 79&quot; episode of &quot;Black Mirror&quot;.

<doc id="263151" wikidata="Q654564" url="?curid=263151" title="Trencavel">
<text>The Trencavel family was an important French noble family in Languedoc between the 10th and 13th centuries. The name &quot;Trencavel&quot; began as a nickname and later became the family&#x27;s surname. The name may derive from the Occitan words for &quot;Nutcracker&quot; (&quot;trenca avelana&quot;). The name was traditionally restricted in actual use only to those family members named Raymond, but the last Trencavel viscount, Raymond II, preferred the surname over his given name and adopted it for his charters.

The first well-known member of the family was Ato I, viscount of Albi in the early 10th century. He was followed by five generations of viscounts of Albi in direct father-to-son descent. During this same period the family came to dominate the episcopacy of Languedoc. Each of the viscounts from Ato II on had a younger brother named Frotarius (or Frothaire) who was a bishop, be it of Albi, Cahors, or Nîmes.

== History ==
In 1069, the three daughters of Peter II of Carcassonne sold the Counties of Carcassonne, Razès, the Béziers and Agde to Raymond Berengar I of Barcelona for 4,000 &quot;mancusos&quot;. By marriage to Ermengard, daughter of Peter II, Raymond Bernard, son of Bernard Ato III, became viscount of Carcassonne. He had already acquired Nîmes. By 1070, he was viscount of Béziers. His son Bernard Ato IV was viscount of Albi, Béziers, Carcassonne, Nîmes, and Razès. He thus held all the lands of the counts of Carcassonne, but never assumed the comital title. Bernard Ato was formally proclaimed viscount after the death of his mother in 1101.

=== Division ===
The sons of Ato IV divided their inheritance. The eldest, Roger I, took Albi, Carcassonne, and Razès, but had no children. The second, Raymond I took Béziers and Agde. The youngest, Bernard Ato V, inherited Nîmes and married Guilhelma, daughter of William VI of Montpellier. In 1132, Roger and Raymond agreed that in the event of Roger&#x27;s death without heirs, Carcassonne would pass to Raymond. In 1150, Roger died and his three viscounties all passed to Raymond. After a series of disputes, the viscounty of Agde was divided between Raymond and Bernard Ato, with the latter holding the title. The elder branch of Béziers-Albi-Carcassonne-Razès and the younger of Nîmes-Agde were to remain separate for the remainder of the family&#x27;s existence. The practical capital of the elder branch was Béziers.

During this period considerable urban unrest emerged as the growing cities tried to assert their independence. Raymond I was killed during one such revolt in Béziers. There was also revolts in Carcassonne in 1107 and 1120–1124, during which four years the Trencavel were expelled from the city.

The Trencavel&#x27;s lands in the centre of Languedoc gave them considerable power in the 11th and 12th centuries. The counts of Barcelona and Toulouse both had large territories to the east and west, and valued a potential alliance with a family that stood in the middle. For the most part, the Trencavels allied with Barcelona against Toulouse. But as a result of the Albigensian Crusade, the last Trencavels lost their lands and titles.

=== Decline ===
Roger II, son of Raymond I, inherited his father&#x27;s four viscounties. His son, Raymond Roger, also held them, but was captured after the fall of Carcassonne to the Crusaders. He died in prison at the end of 1209. Meanwhile, Bernard Ato VI, son of Bernard Ato V, ceded his rights as viscount of Nîmes and Agde to the Crusading leader Simon de Montfort in 1214. Raymond Roger&#x27;s son, Raymond II, formally ceded his titles in 1210, though he reclaimed Carcassonne in 1224, only to lose it to Louis VIII of France in 1226. He continued to call himself viscount until 1247, when he once again formally ceded his rights, this time to Louis IX, and symbolically broke his vicecomital seals, after several failed attempts to recover his patrimony. He and his sons are the last known Trencavels, ruling only the castle of Limoux.

Raymond II&#x27;s granddaughter was living at Cesseras in 1332, but the family disappears thereafter.

<doc id="263153" wikidata="Q1786347" url="?curid=263153" title="Elemental">
<text>An elemental is a mythic supernatural being that is described in occult and alchemical works from around the time of the European Renaissance, and particularly elaborated in the 16th century works of Paracelsus. According to Paracelsus and his subsequent followers, there are four categories of elementals, which are gnomes, undines, sylphs, and salamanders. These correspond to the four Empedoclean elements of antiquity: earth, water, air, and fire, respectively. Terms employed for beings associated with alchemical elements vary by source and gloss.

==History==
The Paracelsian concept of elementals draws from several much older traditions in mythology and religion. Common threads can be found in folklore, animism, and anthropomorphism. Examples of creatures such as the Pygmy were taken from Greek mythology.

The elements of earth, water, air, and fire, were classed as the fundamental building blocks of nature. This system prevailed in the Classical world and was highly influential in medieval natural philosophy. Although Paracelsus uses these foundations and the popular preexisting names of elemental creatures, he is doing so to present new ideas which expand on his own philosophical system. The homunculus is another example of a Paracelsian idea with roots in earlier alchemical, scientific, and folklore traditions.

===Paracelsus===
In his 16th-century work &quot;A Book on Nymphs, Sylphs, Pygmies, and Salamanders, and on the Other Spirits&quot;, Paracelsus identified mythological beings as belonging to one of the four elements. Part of the &quot;Philosophia Magna,&quot; this book was first printed in 1566 after Paracelsus&#x27; death. He wrote the book to &quot;describe the creatures that are outside the cognizance of the light of nature, how they are to be understood, what marvellous works God has created&quot;. He states that there is more bliss in describing these &quot;divine objects&quot; than in describing fencing, court etiquette, cavalry, and other worldly pursuits. The following is his archetypal being for each of the four elements:

*Gnome, being of earth
*Undine, being of water
*Sylph, being of air
*Salamander, being of fire

The concept of elementals seems to have been conceived by Paracelsus in the 16th century, though he did not in fact use the term &quot;elemental&quot; or a German equivalent. He regarded them not so much as spirits but as beings between creatures and spirits, generally being invisible to mankind but having physical and commonly humanoid bodies, as well as eating, sleeping, and wearing clothes like humans. Paracelsus gave common names for the elemental types, as well as correct names, which he seems to have considered somewhat more proper, &quot;recht namen&quot;. He also referred to them by purely German terms which are roughly equivalent to &quot;water people,&quot; &quot;mountain people,&quot; and so on, using all the different forms interchangeably. His fundamental classification scheme on the first page of Tractatus II of the &quot;Book on Nymphs&quot; is based on where the elementals live, and he gives the following names:
 
Of the names he used, &quot;gnomus&quot;, &quot;undina&quot;, and &quot;sylph&quot; are all thought to have appeared first in Paracelsus&#x27; works, though &quot;undina&quot; is a fairly obvious Latin derivative from the word &quot;unda&quot; meaning &quot;wave.&quot;

In &quot;De Meteoris&quot; he referred to the elementals collectively as &quot;Sagani&quot;.

He noted that undines are similar to humans in size, while sylphs are rougher, coarser, longer, and stronger. Gnomes are short, while salamanders are long, narrow, and lean. The elementals are said to be able to move through their own elements as human beings move through air. Gnomes, for example, can move through rocks, walls, and soil. Sylphs are the closest to humans in his conception because they move through air like we do, while in fire they burn, in water they drown, and in earth, they get stuck. Paracelsus states that each one stays healthy in its particular &quot;chaos,&quot; as he terms it, but dies in the others.

Paracelsus conceived human beings to be composed of three parts, an elemental body, a sidereal spirit, and an immortal divine soul. Elementals lacked this last part, the immortal soul. However, by marriage with a human being, the elemental and its offspring could gain a soul.

=== Other authors and beliefs ===
In his influential &quot;De Occulta Philosophia&quot;, published in 1531–33, several decades before the publication of Paracelsus&#x27; &quot;Philosophia Magna&quot;, Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa also wrote of four classes of spirits corresponding to the four elements. However, he did not give special names for the classes: &quot;In like manner they distribute these into more orders, so as some are fiery, some watery, some aerial, some terrestrial.&quot; Agrippa did however give an extensive list of various mythological beings of this type, although without clarifying which belongs to which elemental class. Like Paracelsus, he did not use the term &quot;elemental spirit&quot; &quot;per se&quot;.

A 1670 French satire of occult philosophy,&quot; Comte de Gabalis&quot;, was prominent in popularizing Paracelsus&#x27; theory of elementals. It particularly focused on the idea of elemental marriage discussed by Paracelsus. In the book, the titular &quot;Count of Kabbalah&quot; explains that members of his order (to which Paracelsus is said to belong) refrain from marriage to human beings in order to retain their freedom to bestow souls upon elementals. &quot;Comte de Gabalis&quot; used the terms &quot;sylphide&quot; and &quot;gnomide&quot; to refer to female sylphs and gnomes (often &quot;sylphid&quot; and &quot;gnomid&quot; in English translations). Male nymphs (the term used instead of the Paracelsian &quot;undine&quot;) are said to be rare, while female salamanders are rarely seen.

The Rosicrucians claimed to be able to see such elemental spirits. To be admitted to their society, it was previously necessary for the eyes to be purged with the Panacea or &quot;Universal Medicine,&quot; a legendary alchemical substance with miraculous curative powers. As well, glass globes would be prepared with one of the four elements and for one month exposed to beams of sunlight. With these steps the initiated would see innumerable beings immediately. These beings, known as elementals, were said to be longer lived than man but ceased to exist upon death. However, if the elemental were to wed a mortal, they would become immortal. This exception seemed to work in reverse when it came to immortals, though, for if an elemental were to wed an immortal being, the immortal would gain the mortality of the elemental. One of the conditions of joining the Rosicrucians however, was a vow of chastity in hopes of marrying an elemental.

====Comparison with Buddhism====
The Four Heavenly Kings rule over the eastern, southern, western and northern cardinal directions which are inhabited by gandharvas, kumbhandas, nāgas, and yakshas, respectively. These spiritual beings are reminiscent of the elementals found in the Paracelsian tradition. Different Buddhist traditions in Asia, including those of Tibet and China associate the cardinal directions with elements as well.

====Comparison with Jainism====
In Jainism, there is a superficially similar concept within its general cosmology, the &quot;ekendriya jiva&quot;, &quot;one-sensed beings&quot; with bodies (&quot;kaya&quot;) that are composed of a single element, albeit with a 5-element system (earth, water, air, fire, and plant), but these beings are actual physical objects and phenomena such as rocks, rain, fires and so on which are endowed with souls (&quot;jiva&quot;). In the Paracelsian concept, elementals are conceived more as supernatural humanoid beings which are much like human beings except for lacking souls. This is quite the opposite from the Jain conception which rather than positing soulless elementals is positing that physical objects have some type of soul and that what are commonly considered inanimate objects have this particular type of soul.

===Twentieth century===
In contemporary times there are those who study and practice rituals to invoke elementals. These include Wiccans, and followers of nature-based religions. 

==Art and entertainment==
Elementals became popular characters in Romantic literature after Paracelsus. Even by the 17th century, elemental spirits after the Paracelsian concept appeared in works by John Dryden and in the &quot;Comte de Gabalis&quot;. Alexander Pope cited &quot;Comte de Gabalis&quot; as his source for elemental lore in his 1712 poem &quot;The Rape of the Lock&quot;.

Fouqué&#x27;s wildly popular 1811 novella &quot;Undine&quot; is one of the most influential literary examples. Another example is the DC Comics superhero team The Elementals, composed of the characters Gnome, Sylph, Salamander, and Undine.

Blackwood introduces an elemental in the novella &quot;The Nemesis of Fire&quot;. Elementals related to the four classical elements appeared in the fiction of Michael Moorcock, notably his 1972 novel &quot;Elric of Melniboné&quot;, and a variant appeared in the 1970s &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; role-playing game. The concept has since been expanded on in numerous other fantasy, computer and trading card games.

<doc id="263154" wikidata="Q1200283" url="?curid=263154" title="Dermot Morgan">
<text>Dermot John Morgan (31 March 1952 – 28 February 1998) was an Irish comedian and actor, best known for his role as the title character on the Channel 4 sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;.

==Early life==
Morgan was born in Dublin, the son of Hilda &quot;Holly&quot; (née Stokes) and Donnchadh Morgan, a civil servant and gifted amateur artist and sculptor. His father died young of an aneurysm, leaving Holly with three children: Dermot, Paul, and Denise. A fourth child, Ruth, died in childhood in 1956. Morgan was educated at Oatlands College in Stillorgan and University College Dublin (UCD), where he studied English literature and philosophy. During his time there, he honed his comic skills; he also fronted a country and Irish band named Big Gom and the Imbeciles, a kind of &#x27;tribute&#x27; act to Big Tom and The Mainliners, a major Irish band of the era.

==Career==
===Father Trendy and &quot;The Live Mike&quot;===
Morgan made his debut in the media on the Morning Ireland radio show produced by Gene Martin, whose sister Ella was the mother of one of Morgan&#x27;s friends. It was through this contact that Morgan made the break into radio and eventually television.

Morgan came to prominence as part of the team behind the highly successful RTÉ television show &quot;The Live Mike&quot;, presented by Mike Murphy. Between 1979 and 1982 Morgan played a range of comic characters who appeared between segments of the show. Morgan lampooned the rampant Modernism within the Post-Vatican II Roman Catholic Church in Ireland by creating Father Trendy, a wishy-washy, trying-to-be-cool hippie-priest (modelled after Father Brian D&#x27;Arcy). Father Trendy always wore an Elvis Presley-style haircut and sometimes a leather jacket. He was also given to drawing ludicrous parallels between religion and secularism in two-minute &#x27;sermons&#x27; to the camera. Morgan also satirised extreme nationalist &quot;Little Irelanders&quot;, by playing an irate and bigoted GAA member who waved his hurley around while verbally attacking his pet hates.

At the height of The Troubles, Morgan also lampooned both the &quot;Wolfe Tones&quot; and the clichés of Irish rebel songs, which he said: &quot;always have lots of blood and guts and fire and thunder in them&quot;. He then sang his own parody of Thomas Osborne Davis&#x27; iconic song &quot;A Nation Once Again&quot;, about the martyrdom of Fido, a dog who saves his IRA master by eating a hand grenade during a search of the house by the Black and Tans during the Irish War of Independence. When Fido farts and the grenade accidentally detonates, the Black and Tans comment that &quot;&#x27;Scuse me mate, was that something your dog ate?&quot; The song climaxed with the words: &quot;I hope that I shall live to see Fido an Alsatian once again.&quot;

===As a singer: &quot;Thank You Very Much, Mr. Eastwood&quot;===
Morgan released a comedy single, &quot;Thank You Very Much, Mr. Eastwood&quot;, in December 1985. It was a take on the fawning praise that internationally successful Irish boxer Barry McGuigan gave his manager, Barney Eastwood, at the end of successive bouts. The single &#x27;featured&#x27; impressions of McGuigan, Ronald Reagan, Bob Geldof and Pope John Paul II, and was the Christmas number one in the Irish singles chart in 1985. 

===&quot;Scrap Saturday&quot;===
Morgan&#x27;s biggest Irish broadcasting success occurred in the late 1980s on the Saturday morning radio comedy show &quot;Scrap Saturday&quot;, in which Morgan, co-scriptwriter Gerard Stembridge, Owen Roe and Pauline McLynn mocked Ireland&#x27;s political, business and media establishment. The show&#x27;s treatment of the relationship between the ever-controversial Taoiseach Charles Haughey and his press secretary PJ Mara proved particularly popular, with Haughey&#x27;s dismissive attitude towards Mara and the latter&#x27;s adoring and grovelling attitude towards his boss winning critical praise.

Morgan pilloried Haughey&#x27;s propensity for claiming a family connection to almost every part of Ireland he visited by referring to a famous advertisement for Harp lager, which played on the image of someone returning home and seeking friends.

The Haughey/Mara &quot;double act&quot; became the star turn in a series that mocked both sides of the political divide, from Haughey and his advisors to opposition Fine Gael TD Michael Noonan as Limerick disk jockey &quot;Morning Noon&#x27;an Night&quot;. When RTÉ axed the show in the early 1990s a national outcry ensued. Morgan lashed the decision, calling it &quot;a shameless act of broadcasting cowardice and political subservience&quot;. An RTÉ spokesman said: &quot;The show is not being axed. It&#x27;s just not being continued!&quot;

In 1991, Morgan received a Jacob&#x27;s Award for his contribution to &quot;Scrap Saturday&quot; from the Irish national newspaper radio critics.

===&quot;Father Ted&quot;===
Already a celebrity in Ireland, Morgan got his big break in Britain with Channel 4&#x27;s Irish sitcom &quot;Father Ted&quot;, which ran for three series from 1995 to 1998. Writers Graham Linehan and Arthur Mathews auditioned many actors for the title role, but Morgan&#x27;s enthusiasm won him the part. &quot;Father Ted&quot; focuses on the misadventures of three morally dubious Irish Catholic priests, whose transgressions have caused them to be exiled to the fictional Craggy Island, off the west coast of Ireland.

====BAFTA Award====
In 1996, &quot;Father Ted&quot; won a BAFTA award for Best Comedy. The same year Morgan also won a British Comedy Award for Top TV Comedy Actor, and McLynn was awarded Top TV Comedy Actress. In 1999, &quot;Father Ted&quot; won a second BAFTA for Best Comedy, with Morgan being awarded Best Comedy Performance posthumously.

===Unreleased works===
Morgan said in an interview with Gay Byrne on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; in 1996 that he was writing a screenplay titled &quot;Miracle of the Magyars&quot;, based on a real-life incident in the 1950s when the Archbishop of Dublin John Charles McQuaid forbade Catholics from attending a football match between the Republic of Ireland and Yugoslavia on religious and spiritual grounds. Yugoslavia won the match 4–1. Morgan planned to use Hungary as the opposing side to the Republic of Ireland – hence the title. At the time of his death in 1998, he had completed the screenplay but the film was never made.

Morgan&#x27;s first project after &quot;Father Ted&quot; was to be &quot;Re-united&quot;, a sitcom about two retired footballers sharing a flat in London. According to former manager John Fischer, Morgan was writing the script for the programme and planned to take the part of &quot;an Eamon Dunphy-type who had gone on to work in journalism, but had ended up living with an old football pal&quot;. Mel Smith was in talks for the role of the friend.

Morgan had been commissioned to write a drama series for the BBC.

==Personal life==
Morgan was married to Susanne Garmatz, a German woman, with whom he had two sons. He later began a relationship with Fiona Clarke, with whom he had another son.

Although he had been raised as a Catholic and had briefly considered becoming a priest during childhood, Morgan became an atheist in his later life, and he was critical of the Catholic Church. He supported Irish football clubs Shamrock Rovers FC and UCD and English football club Chelsea.

==Death==
Before location filming on the third and final series of &quot;Father Ted&quot;, Morgan underwent a mandatory medical examination in which he was found to have high blood pressure, and was prescribed medication. On 28 February 1998, one day after recording the series&#x27; final episode, Morgan suffered a heart attack while hosting a dinner party at his home in London&#x27;s Hounslow area, at which the Scottish musician Jim Diamond was present. He was rushed to the hospital, but died soon afterward. He was 45 years old.

Morgan&#x27;s sister Denise said &quot;He wasn&#x27;t feeling great at the end of the meal and I went to the bedroom with him. He had a heart attack, and I didn&#x27;t recognize it. From my limited training in first aid, I wasn&#x27;t sure exactly what was happening. The symptoms didn&#x27;t match what the books said. I said to him &#x27;I think you are okay&#x27; and we went back to the table. He apologised for having left the room and the next thing he just collapsed. We tried to resuscitate him but it didn&#x27;t work.&quot; &quot;Father Ted&quot; co-star Frank Kelly said &quot;Dermot&#x27;s mind was mercurial. I think he was a kind of comedic meteor. He burned himself out.&quot;

Despite Morgan&#x27;s atheism, a Catholic requiem Mass was offered for him at St Therese&#x27;s Church in the South Dublin suburb of Mount Merrion. The Mass was attended by Irish President Mary McAleese, her predecessor Mary Robinson, and many of the Irish political and religious leaders who had been the targets of his satire in &quot;Scrap Saturday&quot;. His body was cremated at Glasnevin Cemetery, and his ashes were buried in the family plot at Deans Grange Cemetery.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Joker&#x27;s Chair&quot; a bronze throne by sculptor Catherine Green was unveiled by then Taoiseach Bertie Ahern in Merrion Square, in Dublin. It bears his name and dates. 

In December 2013, the documentary &quot;Dermot Morgan – Fearless Funnyman&quot; aired on RTÉ One.

A plaque outside McGuire&#x27;s shop in Mount Merrion was unveiled in 2016. 

A wax statue of Morgan stands in the national wax museum in Dublin as part of a &quot;Father Ted&#x27;s Room&quot; display.

<text>A skeleton is a type of physically manifested undead often found in fantasy, gothic, and horror fiction, as well as mythology, folklore, and various kinds of art. Most are human skeletons, but they can also be from any creature or race found on Earth or in the fantasy world.

==Myth and folklore==
Animated human skeletons have been used as a personification of death in Western culture since the Middle Ages, a personification perhaps influenced by the valley of the dry bones in the Book of Ezekiel. The Grim Reaper is often depicted as a hooded skeleton holding a scythe (and occasionally an hourglass), which has been attributed to Hans Holbein the Younger (1538). Death as one of the biblical horsemen of the Apocalypse has been depicted as a skeleton riding a horse. &quot;The Triumph of Death&quot; is a 1562 painting by Pieter Bruegel the Elder depicting an army of skeletons raiding a town and slaughtering its occupants.

&quot;The Story of the Youth Who Went Forth to Learn What Fear Was&quot; is a Brothers Grimm fairy tale in which a boy named Hans joins a circle of dancing skeletons.

In Japanese folklore, &quot;Mekurabe&quot; are rolling skulls with eyeballs who menace Taira no Kiyomori.
=== Mexico ===
Figurines and images of skeletons doing routine things are common in Mexico&#x27;s Day of the Dead celebration, where skulls symbolize life and their familiar circumstances invite levity. Highly-decorated sugar-skull candy has become one of the most recognizable elements of the celebrations. They are known in Mexico as calacas, a Mexican Spanish term simply meaning &quot;skeleton&quot;.
The modern association between skeleton iconography and the Day of the Dead was inspired by &quot;La Calavera Catrina,&quot; a zinc etching created by Mexican cartoonist José Guadalupe Posada in the 1910s and published posthumously in 1930. Initially a satire of Mexican women who were ashamed of their indigenous origins and dressed imitating the French style, wearing heavy makeup to make their skin look whiter, it later became a more general symbol of vanity. During the 20th Century, the Catrina entrenched itself in the Mexican consciousness and became a national icon, often depicted in folk art.

==Modern fiction==

=== Literature ===
* The animated skeleton features in some Gothic fiction. One early example is in the short story &quot;Thurnley Abbey&quot; (1908) by Perceval Landon, originally published in his collection &quot;Raw Edges&quot;. It is reprinted in many modern anthologies, such as &quot;The 2nd Fontana Book of Great Ghost Stories&quot; and &quot;The Penguin Book of Horror Stories&quot;.
*An anthropomorphic depiction of Death which looks like a skeleton in a black robe appears in almost all volumes of Terry Pratchett&#x27;s fantasy series Discworld, including five novels where he is the lead character.
* In the manga/anime &quot;One Piece&quot;, Brook, who is one of the main characters, is an animated skeleton after consuming the Revive-Revive Fruit.

=== Film and TV ===
* Undead skeletons have been portrayed in fantasy films such as &quot;The 7th Voyage of Sinbad&quot; (1958), &quot;The Black Cauldron&quot; (1985), &quot;Army of Darkness&quot; (1992), &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; (1993), and &quot;Corpse Bride&quot; (2005).
* An extended battle scene against an army of skeletal warriors was produced by animator Ray Harryhausen for &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963) and is remembered as one of the most sophisticated and influential visual effects sequences of its day.
* Undead skeletons always appear as funny characters in Thai fantasy folk television dramas. They are often referred to as &quot;Na Phi&quot; (&quot;uncle ghost&quot;).

=== Games ===

* Animated skeletons have been used and portrayed extensively in fantasy role-playing games. In a tradition that goes back to the pen-and-paper game &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, the basic animated skeleton is commonly employed as a low-level undead enemy, typically easy for a player to defeat in combat. Thus, in games which make use of them, such enemies often appear relatively early in the gameplay and are considered a suitable opponent for novice players. In these contexts, they are commonly armed with medieval weapons and sometimes wear armor. 
* In the PlayStation action-adventure series &quot;MediEvil&quot;, the protagonist is an animated skeleton knight named Sir Daniel Fortesque.
* In the 1999 cult classic &quot;&quot;, Morte is a character who joins the protagonist on his quest and is essentially a sentient, levitating human skull with intact eyeballs who cracks wise and fights by biting.
* In the 2011 &quot;Minecraft&quot; video game, skeletons appear as bow-wielding monsters that shoot players with their bows and burn under the sunlight unless they wear helmets. Sometimes the skeletons spawn with stronger bows or random armor, or can be summoned by players in a world with cheats enabled to wield a melee weapon, or no weapon at all. Variants include the Wither Skeleton, which causes the player&#x27;s health points to wither away, the Stray, a frozen variant found in snowy biomes, and the Bogged, a poisonous variant found in swamp and mangrove swamp biomes. In the spinoff game &quot;Minecraft Dungeons&quot;, there also exists a variant that acts as the guards of The Nameless One, a necromancer boss enemy and the king of the undead. In this form, they are equipped with glaives, shields, and iron armor, and are referred to as Skeleton Vanguards.
* In the video game &quot;Fable III&quot;, there exist a race of antagonal characters called &quot;hollow men&quot; which are featured throughout the game.
* A duo of animated skeleton brothers plays an important role in the role-playing game &quot;Undertale&quot;. Named Sans and Papyrus, the brothers&#x27; dialogue text is printed in Comic Sans and Papyrus fonts, respectively.
* Following a poll taken during their Kickstarter campaign, Larian Studios added a playable skeleton race in their 2017 RPG &quot;&quot;, as well as an ancient skeletal character named Fane.
* The Mario series has some Koopa Troopa-skeleton themed enemies known as &quot;Dry Bones&quot;, where after they get hit, they return to their form. Bowser also has a skeleton form known as &quot;Dry Bowser&quot;, first debuted in New Super Mario Bros., and featured in other games such as Mario Party and Mario Kart.
* &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; series features an enemy called Stalfos, armed skeletons who serve as regular enemies and occasionally as minibosses. Variations such as Stalkids and Stalblins also appear in various games in the series.
* In &quot;Heroes of Might and Magic 3&quot;, skeletons are recruitable troops from the Town Necropolis.

<text>Ouzo (, ) is a dry anise-flavored aperitif that is widely consumed in Greece. It is made from rectified spirits that have undergone a process of distillation and flavoring. Its taste is similar to other anise liquors like pastis, sambuca, mastika, rakı, and arak.

==History==

Ouzo has its roots in &quot;tsipouro&quot;, which is said to have been the work of a group of 14th-century monks on Mount Athos. One version of it was flavored with anise. This version eventually came to be called ouzo.

Modern ouzo distillation largely took off at the beginning of the 19th century following Greek independence. The first ouzo distillery was founded in Tyrnavos in 1856 by Nikolaos Katsaros, giving birth to the famous ouzo Tyrnavou. When absinthe fell into disfavor in the early 20th century, ouzo was one of the products whose popularity rose to fill the gap; it was once called &quot;a substitute for absinthe without the wormwood&quot;. In 1932, ouzo producers developed a method of distillation using copper stills that is now the standard method of production. One of the largest producers of ouzo today is &quot;Varvayanis&quot; (Βαρβαγιάννης), located in the town of Plomari in the southeast portion of the island of Lesbos, while in the same town &quot;Pitsiladi&quot; (Πιτσιλαδή), a variety of high-quality ouzo, is also distilled.

Ouzo is usually mixed with water, becoming cloudy white, sometimes with a faint blue tinge, and served with ice cubes in a small glass. Ouzo can also be drunk straight from a shot glass.

Ouzo is often served with a small plate of a variety of appetizers called mezes, usually small fresh fish, fries, olives, and feta cheese. Ouzo can be described to have a similar taste to absinthe which is licorice-like, but smoother.

On October 25, 2006, Greece won the right to label ouzo as an exclusively Greek product. The European Union now recognizes ouzo, as well as the Greek drinks &quot;tsipouro&quot; and &quot;tsikoudia&quot;, as products with a Protected Designation of Origin, which prohibits European makers other than Greece and Cyprus from using the name.

There is an ouzo museum in Plomari, Lesvos.

==Name==
The origin of the name &quot;ouzo&quot; is disputed. A popular derivation is from the Italian &quot;uso Marsiglia&quot;—&quot; for use in Marseille&quot;—stamped on selected silkworm cocoons exported from Tyrnavos in the 19th century. According to anecdote, this designation came to stand for &quot;superior quality&quot;, which the spirit distilled as ouzo was thought to possess.

During a visit to Thessaly in 1896, the late professor Alexander Philadelpheus delivered to us valuable information on the origins of the word &quot;ouzo&quot;, which has come to replace the word &quot;tsipouro&quot;. According to the professor, tsipouro gradually became ouzo after the following event: Thessaly exported fine cocoons to Marseilles during the 19th century, and in order to distinguish the product, outgoing crates would be stamped with the words &quot;uso Marsiglia&quot;—Italian for &quot;to be used in Marseille&quot;. One day, the Ottoman Greek consulate physician, named Anastas (Anastasios) Bey, happened to be visiting the town of Tyrnavos and was asked to sample the local &quot;tsipouro&quot;. Upon tasting the drink, the physician immediately exclaimed: &quot;This is &quot;uso Marsiglia&quot;, my friends&quot;—referring to its high quality. The term subsequently spread by word of mouth, until &quot;tsipouro&quot; gradually became known as ouzo.
:—&quot;The Times of Thessaly&quot;, 1959

However, the major Greek dictionaries derive it from the Turkish word &quot;üzüm&quot; &#x27;grape&#x27;.

==Preparation==

Ouzo production begins with distillation in copper stills of 96% alcohol by volume (ABV) rectified spirit. Anise is added, sometimes with other flavorings such as star anise, fennel, mastic, cardamom, coriander, cloves, and cinnamon. The flavoring ingredients are often closely guarded company &quot;recipes&quot;, and distinguish one ouzo from another. The result is a flavored alcoholic solution known as &quot;flavored ethyl alcohol&quot;, or more commonly as &quot;ouzo yeast&quot;—&quot;μαγιά ούζου&quot; in Greek—the term for &quot;yeast&quot; being used by Greeks metaphorically to denote that it serves as the starting point for ouzo production.

The &quot;ouzo yeast&quot; is then distilled. After several hours of distillation, a flavored distillate of approximately 80% ABV is produced. The spirit at the beginning of the distillation (heads) and end (tails) is usually removed to avoid light and heavy alcohols and aromatics. The heads and tails are usually mixed and distilled again. The product of this second distillation can be used to produce a different quality ouzo.

This technique of double-distillation is used by some distillers to differentiate their products.

Makers of high-quality &quot;100% from distillation&quot; ouzo proceed at this stage with water dilution, bringing the ouzo to its final ABV. But most producers combine the &quot;ouzo yeast&quot; with less expensive ethyl alcohol flavored with 0.05 percent natural anethole, before water dilution. Greek law dictates that in this case the ouzo yeast cannot be less than 20 percent of the final product.

Sugar may be added before water dilution, which is done mostly with ouzo from Southern Greece.

The final ABV is usually between 42.0 and 55.0 percent; the minimum allowed is 40.5 percent.

Ouzo production itself does not involve fermentation.

==Aperitif drink==

In modern Greece, &quot;ouzeries&quot; (the suffix -erie is imported from French, like in &quot;Boulangerie&quot; or &quot;Pâtisserie&quot;) are common throughout Greece. These café-like establishments serve ouzo with &quot;mezedes&quot;. It is traditionally slowly sipped (usually mixed with water or ice) together with &quot;mezedes&quot; shared with others over a period of several hours in the early evening.

In other countries, it is tradition to have ouzo in authentic Greek restaurants as an aperitif, served in a shot glass and deeply chilled before the meal is started. No water or ice is added but the drink is served very cold, enough to make some crystals form in the drink as it is served.

==Cocktails==
Ouzo is not used in many mainstream cocktail drinks, although in Cyprus it does form the basis of a cocktail called an Ouzini. 

==Appearance==
Ouzo is a clear liquid. However, when water or ice is added, ouzo turns a milky-white colour. This is because anethole, the essential oil of anise, is completely soluble in alcohol at approximately 38% ABV and above, but not in water. Diluting the spirit causes it to separate, creating an emulsion whose fine droplets scatter the light. This process is called louching and is also seen while preparing absinthe.

==Drinks with a similar flavour==

Similar aperitifs include sambuca (from Italy), pastis (from France), oghi (from Armenia), rakı (from Turkey), Mastika (from Bulgaria) and arak (from the Levant). Its aniseed flavour is also similar to the anise-flavoured liqueur of anís (Spain) and the stronger spirits of absinthe (from France and Switzerland). Aguardiente (from Latin America), made from sugar cane, is also similar. The Italian drink &quot;Pallini Mistra,&quot; named after the Greek city of Mystras in the Peloponnese is a version of ouzo made in Rome that closely resembles Greek and Cypriot ouzo.

In Bulgaria and North Macedonia, the similar beverage is called &quot;mastika&quot; ( / ), a name that is shared by the distinct Greek liquor &quot;mastika&quot; which is flavored with mastic crystals. Most commonly it is consumed as an aperitif, usually poured over ice to release its aroma and flavors, and enjoyed with meze. Containing 43–45% alcohol, it has a hot taste, not unlike that of brandy, and is usually made from grapes. In North Macedonia, mastika has traditionally been made in the Strumica area.

<doc id="263158" wikidata="Q1412790" url="?curid=263158" title="Gremlin">
<text>A gremlin is a mischievous fictional creature invented at the beginning of the 20th century to originally explain malfunctions in aircraft, and later in other machinery, processes, and their operators. Depictions of these creatures vary widely. Stories about them and references to them as the causes of especially inexplicable technical and mental problems of pilots were especially popular during and after World War II.

Use of the term in the sense of a mischievous creature that sabotages aircraft first arose in Royal Air Force (RAF) slang among British pilots stationed in Malta, the Middle East, and India in the 1920s, with the earliest printed record in a poem published in the journal &quot;Aeroplane&quot; in Malta on 10 April 1929. Later sources have sometimes claimed that the concept goes back to World War I, but there is no print evidence of this.

There is evidence of an even earlier reference in the 1920s, stating that the term was used in the RAF to refer to a lowly menial person, such as a low-ranking officer or enlisted man saddled with oppressive assignments.

==Aviation origins==

Although their origin is found in myths among airmen claiming that gremlins were responsible for sabotaging aircraft, the folklorist John W. Hazen states that some people derive the name from the Old English word &quot;gremian,&quot; &quot;to vex&quot;, while Carol Rose, in her book &quot;Spirits, Fairies, Leprechauns, and Goblins: An Encyclopedia&quot;, attributes the name to a portmanteau of Grimm&#x27;s Fairy Tales and Fremlin Beer. According to Paul Quinion, it is plausible that the term is a blend of the word &quot;goblin&quot; with the name of the manufacturer of the most common beer available in the RAF in the 1920s, Fremlin.

An early reference to the gremlin is in aviator Pauline Gower&#x27;s 1938 novel &quot;The ATA: Women with Wings&quot;, where Scotland is described as &quot;gremlin country&quot;, a mystical and rugged territory where scissor-wielding gremlins cut the wires of biplanes when unsuspecting pilots were about. An article by Hubert Griffith in the servicemen&#x27;s fortnightly &quot;Royal Air Force Journal&quot; dated 18 April 1942, also chronicles the appearance of gremlins, although the article states the stories had been in existence for several years, with later recollections of it having been told by Battle of Britain Spitfire pilots as early as 1940.

This concept of gremlins was popularized during World War II among airmen of the Royal Air Force (RAF) units, in particular the men of the high-altitude Photographic Reconnaissance Units (PRU) of RAF Benson, RAF Wick and RAF St Eval. The flight crews blamed gremlins for otherwise inexplicable accidents which sometimes occurred during their flights. Gremlins were also thought at one point to have enemy sympathies, but investigations revealed that enemy aircraft had similar and equally inexplicable mechanical problems. As such, gremlins were portrayed as equal opportunity tricksters, taking no sides in the conflict, but acting out their mischief from their own self-interest. In reality, the gremlins were a form of &quot;buck passing&quot; or deflecting blame. This led John Hazen to note that &quot;the gremlin has been looked on as new phenomenon, a product of the machine age – the age of air&quot;. The concept of gremlins as a scapegoat was important to the morale of pilots according to the author and historian Marlin Bressi: Examples of Gremlins can be seen in the IBCC Digital Archive.

==Popularization by Roald Dahl==
British author Roald Dahl is credited with getting the gremlins known outside the Royal Air Force. He would have been familiar with the myth, having carried out his military service in 80 Squadron of the Royal Air Force in the Middle East. Dahl had his own experience in an accidental crash-landing in the Western Desert when he ran out of fuel. In January 1942, he was transferred to Washington, D.C. as Assistant Air attaché at the British Embassy. It was there that he wrote his first children&#x27;s novel, &quot;The Gremlins,&quot; in which &quot;Gremlins&quot; were tiny men who lived on RAF fighters. In the same novel, Dahl called the wives of gremlins &quot;Fifinellas&quot;, their male children &quot;Widgets&quot;, and their female children &quot;Flibbertigibbets&quot;. Dahl showed the finished manuscript to Sidney Bernstein, the head of the British Information Service, who came up with the idea to send it to Walt Disney.

The manuscript arrived in Disney&#x27;s hands in July 1942, and he considered using it as material for a live action/animated full-length feature film, offering Dahl a contract. The film project was changed to an animated feature and entered pre-production, with characters &quot;roughed out&quot; and storyboards created. Disney managed to have the story published in the December 1942 issue of &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine. At Dahl&#x27;s urging, in early 1943, a revised version of the story, again titled &quot;The Gremlins&quot;, was published as a picture book by Random House. (It was later updated and re-published in 2006 by Dark Horse Comics).

The 1943 publication of &quot;The Gremlins&quot; by Random House consisted of 50,000 copies, with Dahl ordering 50 copies for himself as promotional material for himself and the upcoming film, handing them out to everyone he knew, including the British ambassador in Washington Lord Halifax, and the US First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt who read it to her grandchildren. The book was considered an international success with 30,000 more sold in Australia but initial efforts to reprint the book were precluded by a wartime paper shortage. Reviewed in major publications, Dahl was considered a writer-of-note and his appearances in Hollywood to follow up with the film project were met with notices in Hedda Hopper&#x27;s columns.

The film project was reduced to an animated short and eventually cancelled in August 1943, when copyright and RAF rights could not be resolved. But thanks mainly to Disney, the story had its share of publicity, which helped in introducing the concept to a wider audience. Issues #33–41 of &quot;Walt Disney&#x27;s Comics and Stories&quot; published between June 1943 and February 1944 contained a nine-episode series of short silent stories featuring a Gremlin Gus as their star. The first was drawn by Vivie Risto, and the rest of them by Walt Kelly. This served as their introduction to the comic book audience as they are human gremlins who lived in their own village as little flying human people.

While Roald Dahl was famous for making gremlins known worldwide, many returning Air Servicemen swear they saw creatures tinkering with their equipment. One crewman swore he saw one before an engine malfunction that caused his B-25 Mitchell bomber to rapidly lose altitude, forcing the aircraft to return to base. Folklorist Hazen likewise offers his own alleged eyewitness testimony of these creatures, which appeared in an academically praised and peer-reviewed publication, describing an occasion he found &quot;a parted cable which bore obvious tooth marks in spite of the fact that the break occurred in a most inaccessible part of the plane&quot;. At this point, Hazen states he heard &quot;a gruff voice&quot; demand, &quot;How many times must you be told to obey orders and not tackle jobs you aren&#x27;t qualified for? – This is how it should be done.&quot; Upon which Hazen heard a &quot;musical twang&quot; and another cable was parted.

Critics of this idea state that the stress of combat and the dizzying heights caused such hallucinations, often believed to be a coping mechanism of the mind to help explain the many problems aircraft faced while in combat.

==In media==
===Film===
* In 1943, Bob Clampett directed &quot;Falling Hare&quot;, a &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon featuring Bugs Bunny. Inspired by Roald Dahl&#x27;s book and Walt Disney&#x27;s proposed film, this short is one of the earliest films to include multiple gremlins, though only one was consequential. It features Bugs Bunny in conflict with a gremlin, first at an airfield and then in an airborne plane. It was followed in 1944 by &quot;Russian Rhapsody&quot;, another &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; short showing Russian gremlins (modeled on Warner Brothers animation staff) sabotaging an aircraft piloted by Adolf Hitler. The gremlin in &quot;Falling Hare&quot; has a color scheme reflecting one used on U.S. Army Air Forces training aircraft of the time, using dark blue (as on such an aircraft&#x27;s fuselage) and a deep orange-yellow color (as used on the wings and tail surfaces).
* The 1944 romantic comedy &quot;Johnny Doesn&#x27;t Live Here Anymore&quot; had animated gremlins with an uncredited Mel Blanc providing the voice.
* The 1981 animated film &quot;Heavy Metal&quot; contains a segment titled &quot;B-17&quot; had creatures referred to as &quot;Gremlins&quot; in which the sole surviving pilot of a battle weary aircraft is ravaged by the reanimated corpses of his fellow crew.
* The 1984 film &quot;Gremlins&quot;, produced by Steven Spielberg and directed by Joe Dante, is loosely inspired by Roald Dahl&#x27;s characters, featuring evil and destructive monsters which mutate from small furry creatures. Murray Futterman, a WWII veteran calls the creatures &quot;Real Gremlins&quot;. A sequel followed in 1990, called &quot;Gremlins 2: The New Batch&quot;.
* In &quot;Cast a Deadly Spell&quot;, a 1991 HBO television film, gremlins are said to have been &quot;brought back from the pacific&quot; to the United States in World War II and are seen damaging cars and houses.
* In &quot;&quot; (2008), Alex sees Mort (mistaking him for a gremlin) messing with the engine and falling off the aircraft.
*In the movie franchise &quot;Hotel Transylvania&quot; the gremlins are seen as guests of the monster hotel built by Count Dracula.
*A batlike gremlin appears in the 2020 film &quot;Shadow in the Cloud&quot;. The film starts with a depiction of gremlins in WW II circa posters as a creative scapegoat used by airmen to deflect negligence in maintenance and responsibility for their aircraft. Once the protagonist boards the aircraft, she finds an actual gremlin is sabotaging the aircraft. The creature looks like a cross between a large bat with razor-sharp claws and a monkey with a long tail. The gremlin sabotages the aircraft by taking out an engine, attacking the protagonist in the lower turret and another crew member in the upper turret.

===Television===

* A 1963 episode of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;, &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot; directed by Richard Donner and based on the short story of the same name by Richard Matheson, featured a gremlin attacking an airliner. In the original television episode, the gremlin appears as a stocky ape-like creature which inspects the aircraft&#x27;s wing with the curiosity of an animal before damaging it. William Shatner plays a passenger named Bob Wilson (just recovered from a mental breakdown) who sees the gremlin (played by Nick Cravat) on the aircraft&#x27;s wing as he tries to warn the stewardess and other airplane staff members about it. Upon realizing that the gremlin&#x27;s work on the wing would cause the airplane to crash, Bob steals a sleeping sky marshal&#x27;s revolver and causes a breach in the auxiliary exit to shoot the gremlin. When the airplane lands, Bob is removed from the aircraft on a stretcher in a straitjacket. Rod Serling narrates that Bob Wilson&#x27;s conviction will not be long as the final scene shows that the gremlin left evidence of Bob&#x27;s claim in the form of a damaged wing. This episode was remade as a segment of &quot;Twilight Zone: The Movie&quot; (1983) with John Lithgow playing a similar character called John Valentine. John Valentine (who is depicted as suffering from aviatophobia) sees the gremlin and tries to warn the people on the airplane as the gremlin intentionally damages the wing. After stealing an airplane security guard&#x27;s gun and breaking open his window, John opens fire on the gremlin which defends itself by breaking the gun and flies away when the airplane nears the airport. John is taken away in a straitjacket as the maintenance crew discovers unexplained damages and claw marks on the wing to the surprise of the passengers nearby.
* The 1975 &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Ark in Space&quot; is set on a supposedly impervious, yet now decrepit space station. In it, the Doctor&#x27;s companion Harry Sullivan explains the station&#x27;s fate, saying, &quot;Gremlins can get into everything, old girl. First law of the sea.&quot;
* A gremlin makes an appearance in a Halloween special of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (original airdate: 28 October 1993) paralleling &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;″s &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot;, (the segment is even named &quot;Terror at 5½ Feet&quot;) in which the gremlin (with its vocal effects provided by Frank Welker) attempts to destroy the wheel of Bart Simpson&#x27;s school bus. Bart ends up using a flare gun to get it off the bus only for it to land on Ned Flanders&#x27; car. Bart is taken away in a straitjacket and later sees the gremlin outside of the ambulance holding Ned&#x27;s severed but still living head.
* The &quot;Eek! The Cat&quot; episode &quot;The Eex Files&quot; (original airdate: 5 November 1994) starts out with Eek on an aircraft beside a man claiming to see someone outside on the wing. Of course when he looks, there is no one there. At the end of the episode, Eek is dropped off by an alien on the wing of the aircraft and meets the gremlin, then promptly offers to help him &quot;find his wallet&quot;. The final scene shows the half-crazed man looking out the window and &quot;spazzing out&quot; when he sees them both tearing up the wing.
* A &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; special titled &quot;Night Ghoulery&quot; (original airdate: 25 August 1995) includes a spoof of &quot;Night Gallery&quot;, with Babs Bunny presenting in Rod Serling&#x27;s style. It has a segment named &quot;Gremlin on a Wing&quot;, which parodies &quot;Nightmare at 20,000 Feet&quot;, with Plucky Duck in William Shatner&#x27;s place, accompanied by Hamton J. Pig in an aircraft, and a gremlin similar to that which appeared in the Bugs Bunny short &quot;Falling Hare&quot;.
* In the &quot;Johnny Bravo&quot; episode &quot;The Man Who Cried Clown&quot; (original airdate: 8 December 1997), which is part of &quot;The Zone Where Normal Things Don&#x27;t Happen Very Often,&quot; Johnny sees an evil clown on the wing of the aircraft and is having difficulty convincing the pilots and anyone of its existence which even included a cameo by someone resembling William Shatner who quotes &quot;Oh no you don&#x27;t! I&#x27;m not falling for that again.&quot; When he catches and beats up the clown in the airplane&#x27;s restroom, he is confronted and informed by a pilot that the clown in question and another clown were needed to keep the aircraft in balance during flight. The pilots and some nearby people beat up Johnny and make him take the incapacitated clown&#x27;s place.
* At the end of episode 9 of &quot;Muppets Tonight&quot;, Miss Piggy sees a gremlin outside of her airplane window. William Shatner is seen sitting next to her as he claims that he has been complaining about the gremlin for years, but nobody does anything about it.
* &quot;The Real Ghostbusters&quot; episode &quot;Don&#x27;t Forget the Motor City&quot; (original airdate: 3 December 1987) has the Ghostbusters traveling to Detroit to battle gremlins who are sabotaging a factory run by a fictional analog of General Motors.
* A gremlin appears in the &quot;Are You Afraid of the Dark?&quot; episode &quot;The Tale of the Curious Camera&quot; (2 March 1994). After getting his portraits back from the basketball team, Matt finds that he didn&#x27;t show up in the photos. To make it up to him, the photographer gives him an antique camera because it has apparently chosen him. Matt soon learns that anything or anyone he takes a picture of will have something bad happen to it whether he wants it or not. It is discovered that a gremlin inhabits the camera.
* In the &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; episode &quot;Gordon and the Gremlin&quot; (original airdate: 16 September 1998), gremlins are blamed for Gordon&#x27;s fire not lighting and problems with the turntable. This episode references &quot;Gremlins&quot; (1984).
* In the &quot;Extreme Ghostbusters&quot; episode &quot;Grease&quot; (original airdate: 25 September 1997), the Ghostbusters have to capture a gremlin that was damaging New York&#x27;s machines, while at the same time the FBI believes them to be the cause of the sabotage.
* In &quot;So Weird&quot; (1999), the gang stop at a town called &quot;Simplicity&quot; where gremlins are destroying everything mechanical. In the fiction of the episode, gremlins were the original inventors and were upset with humans for taking their technology for granted. The gremlins are only appeased by the gang re-writing a locally based tech conglomerate&#x27;s jingle to be about simple living.
* In the cartoon series &quot;American Dragon: Jake Long&quot;, the episode &quot;Jake Takes the Cake&quot; (original airdate: 26 August 2005) features gremlins who mess with any type of mechanical devices and cause a lot of trouble until they are put to sleep and captured.
* The 2013 entry for the &quot;Kamen Rider&quot; series titled &quot;Kamen Rider Wizard&quot; features a Phantom known as Gremlin. His human name Sora is Japanese for &quot;sky&quot;, possibly an allusion to planes. He wields a pair of swords modeled after scissor blades, reflecting the claims that gremlins use scissors to cut wires in biplanes.
* The &quot;Ben 10&quot; alien, Juryrigg, looks like a gremlin and is known to break down and modify machines.
* The 2010 &quot;Super Sentai&quot; series, &quot;Tensou Sentai Goseiger&quot; featured the antagonistic cryptid-themed monster group Yuumajuu.

*&quot;Gremlin Americanus: A Scrap Book Collection of Gremlins&quot; by artist and pilot Eric Sloane may predate the Roald Dahl publication. Published in 1942 by B.F. Jay &amp; Co, the central characters are characterized as &quot;pixies of the air&quot; and are friends of both RAF and USAAF pilots. The gremlins are mischievous and give pilots a great deal of trouble, but they have never been known to cause fatal accidents but can be blamed for any untoward incident or &quot;bonehead play&quot;, qualities that endear them to all flyers.
*&quot;Ssh! Gremlins by H.W.&quot;, illustrated by Ronald Neighbour (&quot;Neb&quot; of the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;), published in 1942 by H. W. John Crowther Publication, England, features numerous humorous illustrations describing the gremlins as whimsical but essentially friendly folk. According to &quot;H.W.&quot;, contrary to some reports, gremlins are a universal phenomenon and by no means only the friends of flying men.

This was the first gremlin card in Magic since Gremlin Mine printed in the 2011 set &quot;New Phyrexia&quot;. Prior to that, the earliest gremlin card was Phyrexian Gremlins printed in the 1994 &quot;Antiquities&quot; set.

<text>Tsipouro () is an un-aged brandy from Greece and in particular Thessaly, Epirus, Macedonia. Tsipouro is a strong distilled spirit containing 40–45% alcohol by volume and is traditionally produced from grape pomace (the residue of the winepress) . Tsipouro is typically produced in two varieties: pure, which is the default, and anise-flavored, which is a relatively new variation introduced during the 1900s. While tsipouro is usually not aged in barrels, barrel-aged versions are also available. It is similar to tsikoudia produced on the island of Crete, but unlike tsikoudia, which is single-distilled and contains no additional flavorings, tsipouro is typically double-distilled and may sometimes include spices, i.e. anise.

== History ==

According to tradition, the first production of tsipouro was the work of Greek Orthodox monks in the 14th century on Mount Athos in Macedonia, Greece.

== Method of production ==
Ripe dark grapes are passed through crusher/destemmers. The mass is left to settle for a few days, just enough to get fermentation started. Formerly, wine would be collected, and only the solid residue would be used for tsipouro in an attempt to get the most out of the plant. Today some producers use the whole of the pulp, without taking out the must for wine production. This results to a superior product, called &quot;apostagma&quot;, sold at approximately twice the price of tsipouro.

In the next stage, the mass is fed into distillation units, where temperature and pressure are closely monitored. The first and last distinct batches (the &quot;head&quot; and the &quot;tail&quot;) are discarded. Only the intermediate batch (known as the &quot;heart&quot;) is kept to make tsipouro. This process is repeated to obtain doubly distilled tsipouro, which might be superior.

Finally, the distillate is left to settle and mature in stainless steel tanks. It can also be aged in wooden barrels to give &quot;aged tsipouro&quot;, a relatively new beverage that can be compared to whiskey.

== Serving ==

Depending on the time of year, tsipouro is used either as refreshment or as a hot beverage, and depending on the time of day, it replaces the drinking of coffee or wine. Tsipouro and tsikoudia, like all alcoholic beverages in Greece, are generally consumed at social gatherings.

According to Greek manufacturers, the best way to enjoy tsipouro is straight from the fridge. Some people prefer to either dilute with water or add ice.

Tsipouro is usually served in shot glasses with meze (a small side dish) such as nuts, dried fruit, raisins, cheese, olives, seafood, meat, halva, or paximadi (rusk).

In 2006, Greece filed a request for tsipouro to be recognized as a PDO (protected designation of origin) product, which was granted later that year.

== Relation to ouzo ==

Anise-flavoured tsipouro is also available, produced especially in Macedonia and Thessaly. Anise-flavoured tsipouro and ouzo have almost identical taste, but vary enormously in their method of production. The alcohol used to produce ouzo is 96% ABV rectified spirit (ethyl alcohol of agricultural origin) and therefore does not retain the flavours of the primary distilled products, whereas the lower degree of distillation of tsipouro allows it to retain the aroma of the pomace.

<text>The Fiat 128 is a transverse front-engine, front wheel drive small family car manufactured and marketed by Fiat from 1969 to 1985 as a two- or four-door sedan, three- or five-door station wagon as well as two- or three-door coupé. The 128 running gear and engine, reconfigured for a mid-engined layout, were used in the Fiat X1/9 sports car.

With engineering by Dante Giacosa and engine design by Aurelio Lampredi, the 128 was noted for its relatively roomy passenger and cargo volume — enabled by a breakthrough innovation to the front-engine, front-drive layout which became the layout &quot;adopted by virtually every other manufacturer in the world&quot; for front-wheel drive. Fiat promoted in its advertising that mechanical features consumed only 20% of the vehicle&#x27;s volume.

Named European Car of the Year in 1970, over three million were ultimately manufactured.

In 2012 automotive journalist Jamie Kitman called the 128 a &quot;pioneer of the small cars we drive today.&quot;

==Development==
With engineering by Dante Giacosa and engine design by Aurelio Lampredi, the 128 was noted for its relatively roomy passenger and cargo volume — enabled by a breakthrough innovation to the front-engine, front-drive layout which became the layout &quot;adopted by virtually every other manufacturer in the world&quot; for front-wheel drive. Giorgetto Giugiaro noted that in 1970, Volkswagen completely dismantled a Fiat 128, recognizing it as the reference for their forthcoming Golf.

Fiat promoted in its advertising that Enzo Ferrari drove a 128 as his personal vehicle.&quot;

Fiat built an entirely new plant in Rivalta, north-west of Turin, specifically to manufacture the new 128. In all, 2,776,000 sedans and wagons were built in Italy, plus 330,800 coupés and 3Ps.

==Front drive innovation==
Front-wheel drive had previously been introduced to small, inexpensive cars by BMC, firstly with the Mini in 1959 and then with the larger 1100/1300 series in 1962. During the mid-1960s, Fiat set about designing a new car to compete with the latter. The BMC design of Alec Issigonis had the transmission and engine sharing a single oil sump — despite disparate lubricating requirements — and located the engine&#x27;s radiator at the side of the engine, away from the flow of fresh air and drawing heated rather than cool air over the engine. The layout often required the engine to be removed to service the clutch.
The Fiat 128&#x27;s arrangement had numerous differences. As engineered by Dante Giacosa, it featured a transverse-mounted engine with unequal-length drive shafts and an innovative clutch release mechanism — an arrangement which Fiat had strategically tested on a previous production model for a full five years, the Primula from its less market-critical subsidiary, Autobianchi. The layout enabled the engine and gearbox to be located side by side without sharing lubricating fluid while orienting an electrically controlled cooling fan toward fresh air flow. By using the Primula as a test-bed, Fiat was able to sufficiently resolve the layout&#x27;s disadvantages, including uneven side-to-side power transmission, uneven tire wear and potential torque steer, the tendency for the power of the engine alone to steer the car under heavy acceleration.

The compact and efficient layout — a transversely-mounted engine with transmission mounted beside the engine driving the front wheels through an offset final-drive and unequal-length driveshafts — subsequently became common with competitors and arguably an industry standard.

The layout was sufficiently flexible that Fiat reconfigured the 128 drive-train as a mid-engined layout for the Fiat X1/9.
==Design==
The all new 1.1 litre Fiat SOHC engine, engineered by noted engine designer Aurelio Lampredi, featured an iron block mated to an aluminum head along with a belt-driven single overhead camshaft.

The 128 was styled similarly to the 124 and 125 and featured rack-and-pinion steering, Pirelli 145R13 Cinturato or 145R13 Michelin ZX radial tyres, front disc brakes, independent rear suspension with a transverse leaf spring, and a strut-type front suspension with integral anti-roll bar.

Initially, the 128 was available as a two-door or four-door sedan. At the 1970 Turin Motor Show a three-door station wagon model called &quot;Familiare&quot; was added to the line-up. On launch, the car was only available with a 1116 cc engine with , or in USA.

The 128 sedan and estate underwent a small refresh in 1972, featuring revisions on the grille, bumpers, dashboard and steering wheel plus addition of a brake servo. 1974 saw the launch of the 128 Special, with rectangular headlights, chrome accents, extra equipment, better seats and upholstery, plus availability of a 1290 cc engine, producing . 
In 1976, the sedan and stationwagon received a proper facelift with a new front and rectangular headlights for all versions, new bumpers with incorporated indicators, redesigned tail lights for the sedan and a new dashboard, as well as modifications to the engines and gearbox in order to reduce the fuel consumption. At this time, the wagon was renamed &quot;Panorama&quot; and received a single rear side window of a somewhat smaller area than the earlier split unit. 

Production of all 128s except that of the base 1,100 cc powered model ended in 1979 after the introduction of the Fiat Ritmo/Strada in 1978. In 1980 production of the small three-door station wagon Panorama was dropped from the range and 128 production finally ended in 1985.
==Road test==
The British &quot;Motor&quot; magazine tested a Fiat 128 in April 1970, shortly after its UK launch. The car had a top speed of and accelerated from 0- in 15.5 seconds. An &quot;overall&quot; fuel consumption of was recorded. This put it fractionally behind the contemporary Morris 1300 on maximum speed but usefully ahead on acceleration. The two were closely matched on fuel economy, where both were outrun by the Ford Escort 1300 Super also included in the comparison, here in its four-door version. The Fiat&#x27;s £876 manufacturer&#x27;s recommended price was not too far above the Morris 1300&#x27;s £830 and the Escort&#x27;s £838. The testers commended the Fiat&#x27;s interior space and excellent performance. Wind and road noise were low, but engine noise was not. The 128 went on sale on the UK market around the same time as the Rootes Group&#x27;s Hillman Avenger, and shortly before the Vauxhall Viva was transformed from its second generation to its third generation. The market leader in this sector at the time was British Leyland&#x27;s 1100 and 1300 range. Sales of imported cars in the UK were in the first stages of a sharp rise in their market share at the beginning of the 1970s, with Fiat and likes of Datsun, Renault and Volkswagen being particularly successful.

==Variants==
===128 Rally===

The Fiat 128 Rally was a sporty, 1.3-litre-engined version of the 128 two-door saloon, introduced at the 41st Geneva Motor Show in March 1971 and produced up to 1974.

Compared to the regular 128&#x27;s 1,116 cc four-cylinder engine, the Rally&#x27;s type &quot;128 AR&quot; engine had been bored out 6 mm to 86 mm—while keeping the 55.5 mm stroke—for a total displacement of . There was also a twin-choke Weber 32 DMTR carburettor, revised valve timing and a slightly higher 8.9:1 compression ratio. Engine output was now at 6,200 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm.
Other mechanical improvements were the addition of a vacuum servo, an engine protection plate, better tyres, new gear ratios for the 4-speed transmission, a higher capacity battery and an alternator in place of the dynamo).
A number of exterior features set the Rally apart from other 128s. At the front there was a black radiator grille, carrying the round Fiat emblem typical of the marque&#x27;s sports cars; split bumpers joined by a tubular steel bar; and halogen headlamps and bumper-mounted auxiliary lamps. At the rear dual round tail lamps replaced the square ones found on the regular two-door 128. &quot;Rally&quot; badging on the bonnet and boot lid and stripes along the side sills completed the sporty look.
The interior was upholstered in black leatherette, and the dashboard housed upgraded instrumentation: a tachometer was standard equipment, and water temperature and oil pressure gauges took the place of the ashtray, relocated to the centre console. Front sports seats with headrests and a two-spoke sports steering wheel replaced the standard items.

At the October 1972 update of the 128 model range, the Rally received new upholstery (leatherette with cloth seat centres) and a black plastic protection to the front bumper tube.
===128 Coupé and 3P===

At the 53rd Turin Motor Show of November 1971 Fiat introduced the 128 Coupé, also called 128 Sport, a 2-door, 4-seat coupé designed in-house and based on a shortened 128 chassis. It was produced until 1975, but in latter years sales were dropping off considerably in favor of the mid-engined X1/9. Since Fiat had to pay a commission to Bertone for every X1/9, it was decided to provide some internal competition in the form of the updated hatchback coupé 128 3P. &quot;3P&quot; stands for &quot;Tre Porte&quot;, or &quot;Three Doors&quot; in Italian. Designed by Paolo Boano of Fiat Centro Stile, the 128 3P used the existing design back to the B-pillar, with some detail modifications to the grille and headlights.

The Coupé version was available with two different engines (1100 and 1300) and in two different trim levels (S and SL) for a total of four variants.
In its base &quot;S&quot; trim, the coupé had single rectangular front headlamps, and wheels and hubcaps from the saloon. The pricier &quot;SL&quot; (for Sport Lusso) was distinguished by quadruple round headlamps, a specific grille, steel sport wheels without hubcaps, chromed window surround trim, door handles and fuel cap, and black decorative striping along the sills and across the tail panel. Inside it gained a leatherette-wrapped steering wheels, perforated leatherette upholstery, extended four-gauge instrumentation, loop pile carpeting and black headlining.

The two engines were developed from the units found in the 128 saloon and 128 Rally respectively, and both were fitted with twin-choke carburettors and a two-piece exhaust manifold. The 1100 (1,116 cc) produced at 6,000 rpm and at 3,800 rpm, while the 1300 (1,290 cc) produced at 6,600 rpm and at 3,800 rpm. Top speed was over and respectively. The 128 3P was also assembled by SEAT in Spain as the SEAT 128, Spanish cars were fitted with engines from the 124.

Compared with the 128 saloon, the coupé had a shorter wheelbase (at ), and tracks 20 mm wider at the front and 45 mm narrower at the rear.
Suspension was the familiar all-independent 128 layout—save for the front anti-roll bar, which had been replaced by radius rods. The braking system consisted of discs at the front and drums at the rear; it was made more efficient by fitting smaller diameter front discs and the front and the vacuum servo first used on the 128 Rally.


==Licensed production==
===Argentina===
In Argentina, the 128 was produced from 1971 to 1990 by Sevel Argentina as a four-door sedan or five-door wagon, the Fiat 128 Rural, the latter unique to Argentina. Several trims and versions were available, including the IAVA sport series. In 1983 the car received a facelift with new headlamps, tail lamps and front grille, which was marketed as the Fiat Super Europa.

===Colombia===
In Colombia, the Fiat 128 was produced by &quot;Compañía Colombiana Automotriz&quot; in Bogota between 1973 and 1980. It was only built as a 4-door sedan. Between 1973 and 1978, it was marketed as Fiat 128 L, with a 1.3-liter, 4-cylinder engine. Starting in 1978, a version with a 1.1-liter engine called the Fiat 128 San Remo was also offered.

===Egypt===
Until 2009, CKD kits from Zastava were manufactured by Egypt&#x27;s Nasr car company as the Nasr 128.

===Poland===
The Yugoslav-exclusive hatchback variant (known as the Zastava 101) of the 128 was manufactured with CKD kits from Zastava in Poland and marketed as the Zastava 1100p by FSO between 1971 and 1976.

===Serbia===

The 128 formed the basis of the Zastava 128 (four-door sedan) and Zastava 101 (three-door and five-door hatchbacks) ranges of cars manufactured by the &quot;Zastava Automobili&quot; company in Serbia. The 128-based Zastavas were available throughout Europe in the &#x27;70s. In Britain, three variants were offered: a three-door hatchback (Zastava Yugo 311/313), four-door saloon (Zastava Yugo 411/413) and a five-door hatchback (Zastava Yugo 511/513). The car was until the end of its production still very popular and was the Serbian automaker&#x27;s most affordable model.

Production ended in November 2008 after Fiat purchased the Zastava factory in Kragujevac, however production of the pick up variant Zastava Poly continued in very limited numbers at the Zastava Special Automobiles factory (156 cars built in the last year) until December 2010.

===South Africa===
For South Africa only, a pickup version was also developed by Fiat in Italy to contest that country&#x27;s popular &quot;bakkie&quot; category. It entered production in 1978. It could handle a payload of and was based on the station wagon model. As per dealer demands, the fuel tank was enlarged to .

===Spain===

In Spain, SEAT manufactured the 3P coupé as the SEAT 128 3P. It was available with two engine options from the 124 engine family, the 1.2-litre and the more powerful and well-known 1430 engine from the SEAT 1430. Was marketed as &quot;Three Times SEAT&quot; in order to underline its triple combination of sportiness, versatility, and design. The SEAT 128 never enjoyed great commercial success, however. 31,893 128s were made between 1976 and 1980.

===Sri Lanka===

In Sri Lanka, the Fiat 128 was manufactured by the Upali Motor Company until 1978. This car was commonly known as the Upali Fiat in Sri Lanka. 
==Cars developed from FIAT 128==
===Fiat X1/9===

The Fiat X1/9 is a two-seater mid-engined sports car designed by Bertone and manufactured by Fiat from 1972 to 1982 and subsequently by Bertone from 1982 to 1989.

Designed around the Fiat SOHC engine and transmission from the front wheel drive Fiat 128, the X1/9 relocated the transverse drive train and suspension assembly from the front of the 128 to the rear of the passenger cabin, directly in front of the rear axle, giving a mid-engined layout. With a transverse engine and gearbox in a mid-mounted, rear-wheel drive configuration, the X1/9 was noted for its balanced handling.

===Moretti 128===
The Moretti Motor Company of Turin, Italy produced the Fiat 128-based Moretti 128 in coupé and cabriolet versions.

Built in the plants of via Monginevro in a semi-handmade way (these custom-built cars were not assembled in a chain) and in a very limited number (less than a hundred), it cost about 1,500,000 lire in 1969. The interior was very neat and could be customized with many accessories (sports steering wheel, electric windows, leather upholstery ...). In 1975, the two models underwent a slight restyling (new black bumpers, wider) and equipped with the 1290 cm3 - 60 HP engine of the contemporary Special sedan.

===Sears XDH-1===

Sears XDH-1 is an experimental electric car built for Sears, Roebuck and Company by their DieHard battery supplier Johnson Controls (Globe Union) in 1977 to celebrate the 10th anniversary of its DieHard brand of car batteries. The car was a Fiat 128 Coupé equipped with 20 DieHard (12-inch deep cycle marine) batteries, and an electric motor.
===Fiat ESV 2000===
The ESV 2000 is an Experimental Safety Vehicle that Fiat developed in 1972 based on its 128 model. It had a totally new 5-door hatchback design, with an extra strong passenger cell, but used the mechanicals of the standard 128 with 1290 cm3 engine. The ESV 2000&#x27;s weight was 360 kg (794 lbs) higher than that of the original 128.

<doc id="263162" wikidata="Q770768" url="?curid=263162" title="Counts and dukes of Anjou">
<text>The Count of Anjou was the ruler of the County of Anjou, first granted by King Charles the Bald of West Francia in the 9th century to Robert the Strong. Ingelger and his son, Fulk the Red, were viscounts until Fulk assumed the title of count. 

Ingelger&#x27;s male line ended with Geoffrey II. Subsequent counts of Anjou were descended from Geoffrey&#x27;s sister Ermengarde and Count Geoffrey II of Gâtinais. Their agnatic descendants, who included the Angevin kings of England, continued to hold the title and territory until King Philip II Augustus seized the region and annexed it to the French crown lands.

In 1360, the county was raised to a dukedom becoming known as Duke of Anjou, subsequently leading the Duchy of Anjou. The title was held by Philip V of Spain before his accession to the throne in 1700. Since then, some Spanish Legitimist claimants to the French throne also claim the title even to the present day, as does a nephew of the Orléanist pretender.

==Counts of Anjou==
===Robertian dynasty===
The Robertians, or Robertian dynasty, comprised:
===House of Ingelger===

==== Agnatic descent ====
==== Cognatic descent ====
==== House of Plantagenet ====
In 1204, Anjou was lost to king Philip II of France. It was re-granted as an appanage for Louis VIII&#x27;s son John, who died in 1232 at the age of thirteen, and then to Louis&#x27;s youngest son, Charles, later the first Angevin king of Sicily.

===Capetian dynasty===

====House of Anjou====
In 1290, Margaret married Charles of Valois, the younger brother of king Philip IV of France. He became Count of Anjou in her right.

====House of Valois====

In 1328, Philip of Valois ascended the French throne and became King Philip VI. At this time, the counties of Anjou, Maine, and Valois returned to the royal domain. On 26 April 1332, Philip granted the county to his eldest son, John:
Following John&#x27;s ascension to the throne as John II in 1350, the title again returned to the royal domain.

==Dukes of Anjou==
The dukes contributed greatly to social reform in the 1300s and 1400s.

===First creation: 1360–1481 – House of Valois-Anjou===
On the death of Charles IV, Anjou returned to the royal domain.

===Second creation: 1515–1531 – House of Savoy===
===Third creation: 1566–1576 – House of Valois-Angoulême===
===Fourth creation: 1576–1584 – House of Valois-Angoulême===
===Fifth creation: 1608–1626 – House of Bourbon===
===Sixth creation: 1640–1660 – House of Orléans===
===Seventh creation: 1668–1671 – House of Bourbon===
===8th creation: 1672 – House of Bourbon===
===9th creation: 1683–1700 – House of Bourbon===
===10th creation: 1710–1715 – House of Bourbon===
===11th creation: 1730–1733 – House of Bourbon===
===12th creation: 1755–1795 – House of Bourbon===
==Dukes of Anjou without legal creation==

===1883–present – House of Bourbon===
After the death of Henri, Count of Chambord, only the descendants of Philip V of Spain remained of the male line of Louis XIV. The most senior of these, the Carlist claimant to the Spanish throne, became the eldest of the Capetians. Some of them used the courtesy title of Duke of Anjou, as shown below:

At the death of Alfonso Carlos in 1936, the Capetian seniority passed to the exiled King of Spain, Alfonso XIII. In 1941, Infante Jaime, Duke of Segovia, succeeded his father Alfonso XIII (Alphonse I of France according to the Legitimists) as the heir male of Louis XIV and therefore as the Legitimist claimant to the French throne. He then adopted the title of Duke of Anjou.

===2004–present – House of Bourbon-Orléans===
On 8 December 2004, Henry, Count of Paris, Duke of France, Orléanist Pretender to the French throne, granted the title Duke of Anjou to his nephew, Charles-Philippe d&#x27;Orléans. Since he did not recognize his cousin&#x27;s courtesy title, in his view, the title was available since 1795.

<text>The People&#x27;s Daily () is the official newspaper of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). It provides direct information on the policies and viewpoints of the CCP in multiple languages.

, the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; to be &quot;State Controlled Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== History ==
The paper was established on 15 June 1948 and was published in Pingshan County, Hebei, until its offices were moved to Beijing in March 1949. Ever since its founding, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; has been under direct control of the CCP&#x27;s top leadership. Deng Tuo and Wu Lengxi served as editor-in-chief from 1948 to 1958 and 1958–1966, respectively, but the paper was in fact controlled by Mao Zedong&#x27;s personal secretary Hu Qiaomu. The newspaper is the official &quot;mouthpiece&quot; () of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party. It is often viewed as most representative of the mainstream perspective of China&#x27;s government.

A large number of articles devoted to a political figure, idea, or geographic focus is often taken as a sign that the mentioned official or subject is rising. Editorials in the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; are regarded both by foreign observers and Chinese readers as authoritative statements of official government policy. Distinction is made between editorials, commentaries, and opinions. Although all must be government approved, they differ sharply on the amount of official authoritativeness they contain by design – from the top. For example, although an opinion piece is unlikely to contain views opposed to those of the government, it may express a viewpoint, or it may contain a debate that is under consideration and reflect only the opinions of the writer: an editorial trial balloon to assess internal public opinion. By contrast, an official editorial, which is rather infrequent, means that the government has reached a final decision on an issue.

During the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; editorial of 26 April, which condemned &quot;unlawful parades and demonstrations,&quot; marked a significant moment in the newspaper&#x27;s history. The editorial increased tension between the government and protesters, and top CCP leaders argued about whether to revise it. An article that compiles the most important editorials was released by the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; during the student movement.

An analysis of the wording of all the issues of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; from 1995 to 2000 was used in the writing of &quot;The First Series of Standardized Forms of Words with Non-standardized Variant Forms&quot;. In March 2018, &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; won the Third National Top 100 Newspapers in China.

The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; maintains a unit called People&#x27;s Data that conducts overseas social media data collection and analysis for police, judicial authorities, CCP organizations. People&#x27;s Data also has data sharing agreements in place with various companies such as DiDi and Temu&#x27;s parent company Pinduoduo. In 2022, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; launched a commercial software service called &quot;Renmin Shenjiao&quot; (People&#x27;s Proofreader) that provides outsourced content censorship. The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; also provides artificial intelligence companies in China with training data that CCP leaders consider permissible. In 2024, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; released a large language model-based tool called Easy Write.

=== Overseas editions ===
The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; also maintains a multilingual internet presence; and established the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily Online&quot; (人民网) in 1997. The website of &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; includes content in Arabic, French, Russian, Spanish, Japanese and English. In comparison to the original Chinese version, the foreign-language version offers less in-depth discussion of domestic policies and affairs and more editorials about China&#x27;s foreign policies and motives. Haiwainet (海外网) is the website of the overseas edition of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;.

The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; in recent years has been expanding on overseas social media platforms. It has millions of followers on its Facebook page and its accounts on Instagram, Twitter and YouTube. An unusually high proportion of its followers are virtually inactive and are likely to be fake users, according to a study by the Committee to Protect Journalists. The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; also maintains agreements with foreign newspapers to republish its content.
== Organization ==
The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; is published by the People&#x27;s Daily News Agency, a ministerial-level institution. The agency is also responsible for the publication of the nationalist tabloid &quot;Global Times.&quot;

== Writing practices ==
The &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; employs &quot;writing task groups&quot; () of various staff to compose editorial pieces to signal the significance of certain pieces or their relationship to the official views of the CCP. These groups are published under &quot;signatures&quot; (i.e., pen names: 署名 &quot;shǔmíng&quot;) that may correspond with the topic and weight of a piece, and what specific government or CCP body is backing it, often with homophonous references to their purpose.

== Reactions ==
During the AIDS epidemic, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; downplayed the epidemic domestically while &quot;presenting AIDS as a relatively innocuous social problem for the country.&quot;

A 2013 study of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; coverage of the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak reported that it &quot;regurgitated triumph and optimism&quot; and framed the outbreak as an &quot;opportunity to showcase China&#x27;s scientific achievements, and the strength of national spirits, as well as the wise leadership of the party and effective measures to protect the lives of ordinary citizens.&quot;

In February 2020, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; published an article stating that the novel coronavirus &quot;did not necessarily originate in China.&quot; In March 2020, the online insert of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, distributed by &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, published an article stating that Traditional Chinese medicine &quot;helps fight coronavirus.&quot; In May 2020, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; stated that the novel coronavirus had &quot;multiple origins.&quot; In November 2020, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; published a claim that COVID-19 was &quot;imported&quot; into China. In January 2021, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; inaccurately attributed deaths in Norway to the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine.

In 2020, the United States Department of State designated the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; a foreign mission, thereby requiring it to disclose more information about its operations in the U.S.

In 2021, ProPublica and &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; was part of a coordinated state propaganda campaign to deny human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

In 2023, the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; sparked a backlash on Chinese social media for exhorting citizens to not complain about their own poverty or boredom.

<text>Xinhua News Agency (English pronunciation: ), or New China News Agency, is the official state news agency of the People&#x27;s Republic of China. It is a State Council&#x27;s ministry-level institution, and was founded in 1931. It is the largest media organ in China.

Xinhua is a publisher, as well as a news agency; it publishes in multiple languages and is a channel for the distribution of information related to the Chinese government and the ruling Chinese Communist Party (CCP). Its headquarters in Beijing are located close to the central government&#x27;s headquarters at Zhongnanhai.

Xinhua tailors its pro-Chinese government message to the nuances of each international audience. The organization has faced criticism for spreading propaganda and disinformation and for criticizing people, groups, or movements critical of the Chinese government and its policies. , the Media and Journalism Research Center evaluated the Xinhua News Agency to be &quot;State Controlled Media&quot; under its State Media Matrix.

== History ==

The predecessor to Xinhua was the Red China News Agency (), founded in November 1931 as the Chinese Soviet Zone of Ruijin, Jiangxi province. It mostly republished news from its rival Central News Agency (CNA) for party and army officials. The agency got its name of Xinhua in November 1935, at the end of the Long March, in which the Chinese Red Army retreated from Jiangxi to Shaanxi. By the outbreak of the Second Sino-Japanese War in 1937, Xinhua&#x27;s &quot;Reference News&quot; translated CNA news from the Kuomintang, and also international news from agencies like TASS and Havas. Xinhua first started using letterpress printing in 1940.

During the Pacific War the agency developed overseas broadcasting capabilities and established its first overseas branches. It began broadcasting to foreign countries in English from 1944. In 1949, Xinhua followed a subscription model instead of its previous limited distribution model. In the direct aftermath of the Chinese Civil War, the agency represented the People&#x27;s Republic of China in countries and territories with which it had no diplomatic representation, such as British Hong Kong. In 1956, Xinhua began reporting on anti-Marxist and other opinions critical of the CCP. In 1957, Xinhua switched from a journal format to a newspaper format.

The agency was described by media scholars as the &quot;eyes and tongue&quot; of the CCP, observing what is important for the masses and passing on the information. A former Xinhua director, Zheng Tao, noted that the agency was a bridge between the CCP, the government, and the people, communicating both the demands of the people and CCP policies.

In 2018, the United States Department of Justice directed Xinhua&#x27;s U.S. branch to register as a foreign agent under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. In 2020, the United States Department of State designated Xinhua and other state-owned media outlets as a foreign mission. Xinhua registered in the U.S. as a foreign agent in May 2021.

In June 2022, Fu Hua, the former CCP Committee Secretary of &quot;Beijing Daily&quot;, was appointed president of Xinhua. In September 2022, Fu stated, &quot;Xinhua will never depart from the party line, not even for a minute, nor stray from the path laid down by General Secretary Xi Jinping&quot;.

== Reach ==
By 2021, Xinhua had 181 bureaus globally, publishing news in multiple languages. Xinhua is also responsible for handling, and in some cases, censoring reports from foreign media destined for release in China. In 2010, Xinhua acquired prime commercial real estate on Times Square in Manhattan and started an English-language satellite news network. Xinhua has paid other media outlets such as &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, and &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; to carry its advertorial inserts, branded as &quot;China Watch&quot; or &quot;China Focus&quot;.

=== Internal media ===
The CCP&#x27;s internal media system, in which certain journals (&quot;neican&quot;) are published exclusively for government and party officials, provides information and analysis which are not available to the public. Xinhua produces reports for these internal journals that contain information that the CCP considers too sensitive for public consumption and can pertain to subjects for security and intelligence purposes.

Xinhua reporters file certain internal reports to CCP leadership from secure rooms in some Chinese embassies. Informed observers note that journalists generally like to write for the internal publications because they can write less polemical and more comprehensive stories without making the omissions of unwelcome details commonly made in the media directed to the general public. The internal reports, written from a large number of countries, typically consist of in-depth analyses of international situations and domestic attitudes towards regional issues and perceptions of China.

The Chinese government&#x27;s internal media publication system follows a strict hierarchical pattern designed to facilitate party control. A publication called &quot;Reference News&quot;—which includes translated articles from abroad as well as news and commentary by Xinhua reporters—is delivered by Xinhua personnel, rather than by the national mail system, to officials at the working level and above. A three-to-ten-page report called Internal Reference (&quot;Neibu Cankao&quot;) is distributed to officials at the ministerial level and higher. One example was the first reports on the SARS outbreak by Xinhua which only government officials were allowed to see. The most classified Xinhua internal reports are issued to the top dozen or so party and government officials.

=== Headquarters and regional offices ===

Xinhua headquarters is located in Beijing, strategically located near Zhongnanhai, which houses the headquarters of the CCP, the General Secretary, and the State Council. Xinhua established its first overseas affiliate in 1947 in London, with Samuel Chinque as publisher. It distributes its news from the publication&#x27;s overseas headquarters in New York City, in conjunction with distributing coverage from the United Nations bureau, as well as its other hubs in Asia, Middle East, Latin America, and Africa.

As of 2024, Xinhua has over 170 overseas bureaus.

==== Hong Kong ====
Xinhua&#x27;s branch in Hong Kong was not just a press office, but served as the &quot;de facto&quot; embassy of the PRC in the territory when it was under British administration. It was named a news agency under the special historic conditions before the 1997 handover, because the People&#x27;s Republic did not recognize British sovereignty over the colony, and could not set up a consulate on what it considered to be its soil. In the early 1980s, the deputy secretary of Xinhua, Wong Man-fong, negotiated with Hong Kong-based triads on behalf of the Chinese government to ensure their peace after the handover of Hong Kong.

Despite its unofficial status, the directors of the Xinhua Hong Kong Branch included high-ranking former diplomats such as Zhou Nan, former Ambassador to the United Nations and Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs, who later negotiated the Sino-British Joint Declaration on the future of Hong Kong. His predecessor, Xu Jiatun, was also vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee, before fleeing to the United States in response to the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre, where he went into exile.

It was authorized by the special administrative region government to continue to represent the central government after 1997, and it was renamed &quot;The Liaison Office of the Central People&#x27;s Government in the Hong Kong SAR&quot; on 18 January 2000, retaining branch chief Jiang Enzhu as inaugural director.

==== Cairo ====
Xinhua opened its Middle East Regional Bureau in Cairo, Egypt in 1985.

=== Cooperation with other media outlets ===
In 2015, Xinhua and other Chinese state media outlets signed cooperation and content-sharing agreements with Russian state media outlets.

In November 2018, Xinhua News Agency and the Associated Press (AP) of the United States signed a memorandum of understanding to expand cooperation. Some lawmakers in the US congress asked the AP to release the text of its memorandum of understanding with Xinhua. In response, AP spokeswoman Lauren Easton told &quot;The&quot; &quot;Washington Post&quot; that AP&#x27;s agreement with Xinhua is to allow it to operate inside China and has no bearing on AP&#x27;s independence, and that Xinhua has no access to AP&#x27;s sensitive information and no influence over AP&#x27;s editorial decisions.

In December 2022, journalist Joshua Kurlantzick said that Xinhua has had more success than other Chinese state media outlets such as China Global Television Network and China Radio International in acting as a part of China&#x27;s media offensive, with Xinhua having signed content sharing agreements with many news agencies around the world. He noted that &quot;unlike with, say, a television station that a viewer has to actively turn on, and probably knows the channel, most print or online readers do not check the bylines of news articles—making it easier for Xinhua copy to slip through to readers.&quot; He also noted: &quot;In developing countries, Xinhua is increasingly stepping into the void left by other news wires like the Associated Press, because Xinhua content is free or cheap&quot;, and warned about Xinhua content being used by local news outlets in countries such as Thailand, saying: &quot;Readers don&#x27;t really notice where it comes from. That&#x27;s going to skew the views of the general reading public, and that&#x27;s quite dangerous.&quot;

=== Partnerships ===
In 2018, Xinhua, in partnership with Tencent&#x27;s subsidiary Sogou, launched its first artificial intelligence-generated news anchor.

== Reception ==
=== Overview ===
==== Political bias, censorship, and disinformation ====
In 2005, Reporters Without Borders called Xinhua &quot;The World&#x27;s Biggest Propaganda Machine&quot;, pointing out that Xinhua&#x27;s president held the rank of a minister in the government. The report stated that the news agency was &quot;at the heart of censorship and disinformation put in place&quot; by the government.

In a 2007 interview with &quot;The Times of India&quot;, then Xinhua president Tian Congming affirmed the problem of &quot;historical setbacks and popular perceptions&quot; with respect to Xinhua&#x27;s credibility. &quot;Newsweek&quot; criticized Xinhua as &quot;being best known for its blind spots&quot; regarding controversial news in China, although the article acknowledges that &quot;Xinhua&#x27;s spin diminishes when the news doesn&#x27;t involve China&quot;.

During the 2002–2004 SARS outbreak, Xinhua was slow to release reports of the incident to the public. However, its reporting in the aftermath of the 2008 Sichuan earthquake was seen as more transparent and credible as Xinhua journalists operated more freely.

Xinhua has criticized perceived foreign media bias and inaccurate reporting, citing an incident during the 2008 Tibetan unrest when media outlets used scenes of Nepalese police arresting Tibetan protesters as evidence of Chinese state brutality with commentary from CNN&#x27;s Jack Cafferty calling China&#x27;s leaders &quot;goons and thugs&quot;. CNN later apologized for the comments.

=== Historical events ===

==== 1968 industrial espionage allegations ====
During the May 68 events in France, Xinhua and PRC embassy press office staff were reported to exploit civil unrest to undertake industrial espionage at French factories.

==== 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre ====
Xinhua staff struggled to find the &quot;right line&quot; to use in covering the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests and massacre. Although more cautious than &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot; in its treatment of sensitive topics during that period – such as how to commemorate reformist CCP leader Hu Yaobang&#x27;s April 1989 death and then ongoing demonstrations in Beijing and elsewhere – Xinhua gave some favorable coverage to demonstrators and intellectuals supportive of the movement. Conflict between journalists and top editors over the censorship of stories about the Tiananmen Square crackdown lasted for several days after the military&#x27;s dispersal of demonstrators on 4 June, with some journalists going on strike and demonstrating inside the agency&#x27;s Beijing headquarters. Government oversight of the media increased after the protests – top editors at the agency&#x27;s bureaus in Hong Kong and Macau were replaced with appointees who were pro-Beijing.

==== 2012 Mark Bourrie resignation and espionage allegations ====
In 2012, Xinhua&#x27;s Ottawa correspondent Mark Bourrie resigned after Ottawa bureau chief Zhang Dacheng allegedly requested him to report on the Dalai Lama for Xinhua&#x27;s internal media, which Bourrie felt amounted to gathering intelligence for China. Zhang denied the allegation, telling the Canadian Press that Xinhua&#x27;s policy is to &quot;cover public events by public means&quot; and his bureau&#x27;s job is to cover news events and file the stories to Xinhua&#x27;s editing rooms, who would then decide which stories would be published. Bourrie, who had a press pass providing him access to the Parliament of Canada, had previously tried to consult the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS) in 2009 on the matter of writing for Xinhua, but was ignored by CSIS.

==== Portrayal of Indians during the 2017 Doklam standoff ====

During the 2017 China–India border standoff, Xinhua&#x27;s English-language new media program &quot;The Spark&quot; released a satirical video named the &quot;Seven Sins of India&quot; on 16 August 2017, in which presenter Di&#x27;er Wang spoke of Indians having &quot;thick skin&quot; and &quot;pretending to sleep&quot; on the matter of the border dispute. Wang stated that India was physically threatening Bhutan, and compared India to a &quot;robber who breaks into a house and does not leave&quot;. An actor in the video portraying &quot;India&quot; with a turban, beard and accent sparked allegations of racism and anti-Indian sentiment. The video was criticized on Twitter and by Indian and Western media.

==== 2018 Devumi allegations ====
In January 2018, &quot;The New York Times&quot; published an investigative report on social media promotions, alleging that the US-based company Devumi was providing &quot;Twitter followers and retweets to celebrities, businesses and anyone who wants to appear more popular or exert influence online.&quot; The article alleged an unnamed Xinhua editor bought &quot;hundreds of thousands of followers and retweets on Twitter&quot;.

==== 2019 Hong Kong protests ====

In 2019, Xinhua was criticized for perceived bias in its portrayal of the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests as violent and illegitimate, which led Twitter to ban it and other state-sponsored media outlets from ad purchases.

==== COVID-19 pandemic ====

In 2020, Xinhua was one of several Chinese state media agencies reported to have been disseminating propaganda, targeted advertisements and social media posts, and news that showed the Chinese government in a better light.

In 2022, journalist Joshua Kurlantzick noted that Xinhua&#x27;s coverage of the pandemic, while being &quot;sometimes factual and on the face of it little different in style from other newswires, often downplayed the threat of the virus within China and to other countries&quot;, and that it frequently highlighted the efforts of doctors and citizens in combating the virus, while ignoring the ways China had initially covered up the signs of an outbreak and Chinese citizens&#x27; growing anger at the government&#x27;s response.

==== Uyghurs ====
In 2012, Xinhua launched a Uyghur language website. In 2021, Xinhua published a &quot;fact check&quot; following the publication of a BBC News report on the situation in Xinjiang which, according to &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, &quot;included an attempt to directly refute the testimony of one witness quoted in the BBC report. (Notably, Xinhua&#x27;s fact check did not address the bulk of the testimony from other survivors.)&quot;

==== Russian invasion of Ukraine ====
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Xinhua and other Chinese state media outlets paid for digital ads on Facebook supporting pro-Kremlin disinformation and propaganda, including dissemination of the Ukraine bioweapons conspiracy theory, after Meta Platforms banned Russian state media advertisement buys.

==== 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan ====
During the 2022 Chinese military exercises around Taiwan, Xinhua published an altered image of a Taiwanese Chi Yang-class frigate near the coast of Hualien County appearing to be a People&#x27;s Liberation Army Navy vessel. The Taiwanese Ministry of National Defense labelled the image as disinformation.

<doc id="263169" wikidata="Q316565" url="?curid=263169" title="Giorgetto Giugiaro">
<text>Giorgetto Giugiaro (; born 7 August 1938) is an Italian automotive designer. He has worked on supercars and popular everyday vehicles. He was named Car Designer of the Century in 1999 and inducted into the Automotive Hall of Fame in 2002. He was awarded the Compasso d&#x27;Oro industrial design award six times, including a lifetime achievement awarded in 1984.

In addition to cars, Giugiaro designed camera bodies for Nikon, &quot;Navigation promenade&quot; of Porto Santo Stefano, in 1983, the organ of the Cathedral of Lausanne (composed of about 7000 pipes) in 2003, and developed a new pasta shape, &quot;Marille&quot;. He also designed several watch models for Seiko, mainly racing chronographs, as well as office furniture for Okamura Corporation.
==Influence on design==

Giugiaro&#x27;s earliest cars, like the Alfa Romeo 105/115 Series Coupés, often featured tastefully arched and curving shapes, such as the De Tomaso Mangusta, Iso Grifo, and Maserati Ghibli.




From the late 1960s, Giugiaro&#x27;s designs became increasingly angular, transitioning via the gentle bends of the 1971 Maserati Bora, and culminating in the straight-lined, &quot;folded paper&quot; era of the 1970s and &#x27;80s designs such as the 1974 first VW Golf, the 1976 Lotus Esprit S1, 1978 BMW M1, and the 1981 DMC DeLorean. During the early 1990s, he went along with the era, and introduced more curvy designs again, with his Lamborghini Calà, Maserati Spyder, Ferrari GG50 and Grundig Space Fidelity.

Giugiaro is perhaps most widely known for the DMC DeLorean. Notable in its own time for its unique design, the car was prominently featured in the Hollywood blockbuster movie series &quot;Back to the Future,&quot; but his most commercially successful design is the Volkswagen Golf Mk1.

In 1976, Giugiaro explored a new taxi concept with the Museum of Modern Art (MOMA), which became the 1978 Lancia Megagamma concept. Fiat had commissioned the 1978 concept from Italdesign, asking for a 4-meter length, high roof, high h-point, multi-functional, monospace design — but ultimately decided the concept was too risky for production. In retrospect, the Megagamma was more influential than successful in its own right. It is considered the &quot;conceptual birth mother of the MPV/minivan movement.&quot; it influenced design of such mini/compact MPVs as the Nissan Prairie (1981) and Fiat 500L (2011), as well as larger MPVs, including the Renault Espace and Chrysler minivans.

===Career and studios===
* Giugiaro started his career as a stylist at the in-house Special Vehicle Design department of Italy&#x27;s major carmaker Fiat (1955–1959)
* From 1959–1965, he worked in a similar capacity for Gruppo Bertone, a company exclusively working for &quot;other&quot; carmakers, primarily as a styling and design studio, similar to a building architecture firm, as well as handling low volume production of special edition cars for other carmakers. Although Bertone and Italy&#x27;s other car and industrial design studios would create design proposals for other car brands on their own initiative, and sometimes even show concept cars under their own name, they never combined their design and production work for other carmakers with independent car manufacturing in their own right and under their own brand name, like Lotus in the UK, or Porsche in Germany.
* In 1965 Giugiaro switched to working for Ghia, another of Italy&#x27;s car design studios, through 1967; followed by:
* a brief stint at Studi Italiani Realizzazione Prototipi (SIRP), in 1968, after which
* Giugiaro founded his own studio, Italdesign Giugiaro (1968–2015).
* From 2015 (to present day), he turned over a new leaf with GFG Style

<text>The Strengthening Nation Forum () is a Chinese bulletin board on the website of the &quot;People&#x27;s Daily&quot;, an official newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party.

The purpose of the forum is for discussion on how to make China a stronger nation. The forum is somewhat remarkable being sponsored by an organ of the Chinese Communist Party yet having a relatively open amount of uninhibited discussion including sometimes extremely strong criticism of the People&#x27;s Republic of China government. Scholars of the Chinese internet such as Peng Lan, argue that its creation to mobilize internet resistance to the bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade was a landmark moment in Chinese internet history, and the forum has been cited as being important in the development of online Chinese nationalism.

With politically sensitive issues such as the July 1, 2003 demonstrations in Hong Kong against Hong Kong Basic Law Article 23, the amount of coverage and analysis within the forum is often more extensive than with the paper itself.

After Zhao Ziyang&#x27;s death on January 17, 2005, the forum was flooded with messages expressing condolence. These messages were promptly deleted by the moderators, as the government feared any mass mourning for the purged leader would cause civil unrest, and some posters responded by ridiculing the moderators. One person asked: &quot;I could post messages in the morning, but why not in the evening?&quot;

<doc id="263173" wikidata="Q244960" url="?curid=263173" title="Double-clutching (technique)">
<text>Double-clutching (also called double de-clutching outside of the United States) is a method of shifting gears used primarily for vehicles with an unsynchronized manual transmission, such as commercial trucks and specialty vehicles. While double clutching is not necessary in a vehicle that has a synchronized manual transmission, the technique can be advantageous for smoothly downshifting in order to accelerate and, when done correctly, it prevents wear on the synchronizers which normally equalize transmission input and output speeds to allow downshifting.

With this method, instead of pushing the clutch in once and shifting directly to another gear, the driver first engages the transmission in neutral before shifting to the next gear. The clutch is depressed and released with each change. A related downshifting or rpm-matching technique is heel-and-toe shifting, in which the throttle is &quot;blipped&quot; (i.e. momentarily opened during downshifting) by the driver&#x27;s heel during braking.

==History==

Before the introduction of transmission synchronizers in 1927, double clutching was a technique required to prevent damage to an automobile&#x27;s gearing during shifts. Due to the difficulty and most often unnecessary redundancy involved in the technique, coupled with the advent of synchronized gearing systems, it has largely fallen into disuse in light vehicles. However, many tractor units are still supplied with an unsynchronised gearbox which requires a double-clutching technique to be used.

==Technique==
In a non-synchromesh gearbox with neutral between gears, a typical shift involves two gear changes, once into neutral, and again into the target gear. During any shift, disconnecting drive components via a clutch unloads the force from the opposing components from the engine and transmission. Disengaging the clutch for each shift out of, and then into, each gear is double clutching or declutching. Due to the absence of a neutral spacing, double-clutching is impossible for sequential gear changes, as with a fully sequential gearbox used in motorcycles and racecars.

The double-clutching technique involves the following steps:
*The accelerator (throttle) is released, the clutch pedal is pressed and the gearbox is shifted into neutral.
*The clutch pedal is then released, and the driver matches the engine speed to the gear speed either using the throttle (accelerator) (when changing to a lower gear) or waiting for the engine speed to decrease (when changing to a higher gear) to a level suitable for shifting into the next gear.
*At the moment when the revs between the input shaft (i.e. engine revs) and gear are closely matched, the driver then presses the clutch again, shifts into the next gear, and releases the clutch. The result should be a smooth gear change.

Although double clutching is a testing requirement when obtaining a commercial driver&#x27;s license in some jurisdictions, many truckers learn to shift gears without using the clutch. This is known as floating gears or float shifting, with the clutch needed only during starting and stopping. However, this is not recommended by non-synchro gearbox manufacturers such as Eaton as it will generally cause additional wear on the gears.

Double clutching can be difficult to master, as it requires the driver to gauge the speed of the vehicle and throttle to the intended gear accurately; vehicle weight and road gradient are important factors as they influence the vehicle&#x27;s acceleration or deceleration during the shift.

Sometimes, truck drivers use the engine brake to help match the engine speed to the gear. The most common situation is with a loaded vehicle that has no split gears or half gears in the lower range, from gears 1–4. In this case, it is especially difficult and sometimes impossible to get from 1 to 2, and sometimes even from 2 to 3 while starting on a hill. The problem is that by the time the engine speed has dropped sufficiently to enable a shift into the higher gear, the vehicle will have slowed down too much or possibly even stopped, making the shift impossible. The engine brakes, which on some models can be set to different intensities (retarding variable numbers of engine cylinders) enable a shift by dropping the engine speed quickly enough to catch the higher gear before the vehicle has decelerated too much. This technique, sometimes called &quot;jake shifting&quot;, requires high skill and much practice shifting without the clutch, and is usually not recommended among truck drivers because mistakes can cause damage to the transmission. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), municipalities across the United States have banned the use of compression-release engine brakes, which includes jake shifting, because of noise emission.

==Theory==
The purpose of the double-clutch technique is to aid in matching the rotational speed of the input shaft being driven by the engine to the rotational speed of the gear the driver wishes to select. The output shaft in the transmission is directly driven by the rotating wheels, and each gear set is a different ratio, so in a five-speed transmission in fourth gear, one will have three lower gearsets not engaged spinning at three different, and faster, rates and one higher gear spinning at a &quot;slower&quot; rate than the input shaft. In order to shift down, the fourth gear has to be disengaged, leaving no gears connected to the input shaft. This is &quot;neutral&quot;, and the input shaft and gears all need to be accelerated so the speed of the output shaft and the lower gear the operator wishes to select match speeds long enough for the dog clutch to lock them together. When the speeds are matched, the gear will engage smoothly and no clutch is required. If the speeds are not matched, the dog teeth on the collar will &quot;clash&quot; or grate as they attempt to fit into the holes on the desired gear.

A modern synchromesh gearbox accomplishes this synchronization more efficiently. However, when the engine speed is significantly different from the transmission speed, the desired gear can often not be engaged even in a fully synchronized gearbox. An example is trying to shift into a gear while traveling outside the gear&#x27;s speed or directional range, such as accidentally into first from near the top of the second, or intentionally from reverse to forward gear while still moving at speed. Double clutching, although (slightly) time-consuming, ease gear selection when an extended delay or variance exists between engine and transmission speeds, and reduces wear on the synchronizers (or baulk rings), which are brass cone clutches themselves, and wear very slightly each time they are used to equalize the transmission revs with the output revs.
