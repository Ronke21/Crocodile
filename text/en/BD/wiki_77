<text>Iloilo ( ; ), also called Iloilo Province, officially the Province of Iloilo (; ; ; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Western Visayas region. Its capital and largest city is Iloilo City, the regional center of Western Visayas and politically independent from the province. Iloilo occupies the southeast portion of the Visayan island of Panay and is bordered by the province of Antique to the west, Capiz to the north, the Jintotolo Channel to the northeast, the Guimaras Strait to the east, and the Iloilo Strait and Panay Gulf to the southwest. Iloilo City, its capital, is the center of the Iloilo–Guimaras metropolitan area or Metro Iloilo–Guimaras, and is geographically located in the province and grouped under it by the Philippine Statistics Authority, but remains politically independent from the provincial government. According to the 2020 census, the population of the province (excluding Iloilo City) is 2,051,899. If Iloilo City is included, the population is 2,509,525 in total. 

Iloilo is known for its rich history and cultural heritage. The southern part of the province is home to many Spanish-era historic sites, including the Miag-ao Church, a UNESCO World Heritage Site in the Philippines. It also boasts several other prominent structures, such as the San Joaquin Campo Santo, San Joaquin Church, and Santa Barbara Church, all recognized as National Cultural Treasures by the National Museum of the Philippines. In the northern part, it is known for beaches and islands, including the Bantigue Sandbar, Tangke Lagoon, Cabugao Island, and Antonia Island, all part of the Islas de Gigantes. Additionally, Sicogon Island, situated south of the group of islands, has gained popularity as a luxury tourist destination. 

==Etymology==
The name of the province is derived from Iloilo City, which in turn is derived from the older name &quot;Irong-irong&quot; (Philippine Spanish: &quot;Irong̃-írong̃&quot;) meaning &quot;nose-like&quot;, referring to the promontory between two rivers (Iloilo and Batiano) where the Fort San Pedro and the 17th-century Spanish port were located.

==History==
===Early history===
No pre-Hispanic written accounts of Iloilo and Panay island exist today. Oral tradition, in the form of recited epics like the Hinilawod, has survived to a small degree. A few recordings of these epic poems exist. The most notable are the works of noted Filipino Anthropologist Felipe Jocano.

While no current archaeological evidence exist describing pre-Hispanic Iloilo, an original work by Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro published in 1907 called &quot;Maragtas&quot; details the alleged accounts of the founding of the various pre-Hispanic polities on Panay Island. The book is based on oral and written accounts available to the author at the time. The author made no claim on the historical accuracy of the accounts.

According to Maragtas, Madja-as was founded after ten datus fled Borneo and landed on Panay Island. The book then goes on to detail their subsequent purchase of the coastal lands in which they settled from the native Ati people.

Datu Paiburong, one of the ten fleeing datus, established a settlement and named it Irong-Irong after an islet of the same name on the Batiano River. Afterwards, the warriors Labaodungon and Paybare, upon advice of datu Paiboring then recruited local fighters from the Philippines and fellow immigrants from Borneo and they returned to Borneo at Odtojan where the enemy of the ten datus, Makatunaw, ruled, Rajah or Sultan Makatunao, and they killed him and sacked the city he ruled and returned to the newly founded towns of the ten datus.

===Spanish colonial era===
Spain eventually succeeded on conquering of the island of Panay when Spanish conquistador Miguel López de Legazpi moved his headquarters from the island of Cebu and creating the first Spanish settlement in the island in Ogtong in 1566. This is mainly due in part to the rivalries between the Bisaya and the Moro, of which the former found an ally in Spanish against the latter. The Bisayas accepted alliances with Spain, to defend themselves against the enslaving Moros. To this end, Iloilo contributed troops in the Castille War against the Sultanate of Brunei.

In 1581, the encomienda in Ogtong was moved to La Villa Rica de Arevalo, because of frequent coastal raids by the Dutch privateers. Furthermore, an attack in the year 1600 (Part of the Spanish–Moro conflict) where there was a large Muslim armada to destroy Iloilo City, led by two Moros named Sirungan and Salikala who lead the Muslim force of 70 ships and 4,000 warriors that had raided and attacked several Visayan islands in order to abduct slaves to sell to their allies in the Sultanate of Demak and the Sultanate of Malacca, eventually caused the move of the city center further on to the mouth of the Irong-Irong river founding what is now Iloilo City and constructing Fort San Pedro to defend it in 1616.

Nevertheless, when the 4,000 Moros led by Sirungan and Salikala tried to attack Iloilo City they were repulsed with heavy losses in the town of Arevalo by a force of 1,000 Hiligaynon warriors and 70 Mexican arquebusiers under the command of Juan García de Sierra, the Spanish officer who died in the battle. The Spanish Christianized the area.

Soon, the area itself began to prosper, due to its successful textile and sugar industry. As a result, it received Chinese immigrants from the west (that worked for its trades) and Latinos from the ports of Mexico in the east (to man its military installations). The Jesuits soon built a school for Spanish and Visayan boys in Tigbauan, Iloilo. Later in the 1700s, Iloilo was home to 166 Spanish Filipino families and 29,723 native families.

===American colonial era===
During the American colonial period, Iloilo became a home to many firsts: including the first department stores and cinema theaters in the Commonwealth of the Philippines.

===Japanese occupation===

Iloilo experienced severe devastation during the events of World War II. The Japanese built &quot;comfort stations&quot; in Iloilo in 1942, where they imprisoned Filipino &quot;comfort women&quot; who they routinely gang-raped, brutalized, and murdered for entertainment. Nevertheless, during the Japanese occupation, Macario Peralta Jr., freed most of Panay (with little exceptions) from Japanese Imperialism, thus other allied guerillas in other provinces from Romblon, Palawan, Marinduque and portions of Masbate and Mindoro, considered majority liberated Panay Island, the &quot;Primus inter pares&quot; in their alliance network.

===Philippine independence===
Iloilo became a province of the newly fledged Republic of the Philippines when the archipelago gained independence from the United States on July 4, 1946.

==Geography==

The province is bordered by the province of Antique to the west, Capiz to the north, the Jintotolo Channel to the northeast, the Visayan Sea and Guimaras Strait to the east, and the Iloilo Strait and Panay Gulf to the southwest.

The province is divided into two distinct geographic regions; the highlands of the Central Panay Mountain Range on the western border and the lowland plains which account for a larger portion of the province. Small islands east of its northernmost tip also dot the Visayan Sea - of these, Pan de Azucar and Sicogon are well-known. Mount Baloy is the highest mountain in Iloilo with an elevation of above sea level, located on the triple border of Iloilo, Capiz, and Antique. Other peaks are Mount Llorente 4,409 ft.

===Climate===
==Demographics==
The population of Iloilo in the 2020 census was 2,051,899 people, with a density of . If the highly urbanized city of Iloilo is included for statistical purposes, the province&#x27;s total population is 2,509,525 people, with a density of .

People from Iloilo are called Ilonggos. There are three local languages used in the province: Hiligaynon (Ilonggo), Kinaray-a and Capiznon. Hiligaynon and dialects/variants of it are spoken in Iloilo City and in some towns of the province, especially to the northeast. Tagalog and English are widely used as administrative, educational, and commercial languages.

===Language===


Hiligaynon is concentrated in the city of Iloilo and surrounding areas, as well as the northeastern portion of the province, Guimaras and the Negros Island (especially in Negros Occidental and to a lesser extent in Negros Oriental), as well as the provinces of South Cotabato, Sultan Kudarat, and North Cotabato in Soccsksargen, Mindanao. It is also spoken in the neighboring provinces, such as Capiz, Antique, Aklan, Masbate, Palawan and Romblon as well as in some parts of Maguindanao. It is also spoken as a second language by Cebuano speakers in Negros Oriental, Kinaray-a speakers in Antique, Aklanon/Malaynon speakers in Aklan, and Capiznon speakers in Capiz.

The language is referred to as &quot;Ilonggo&quot; in Iloilo and Negros Occidental. More precisely, Ilonggo is an ethno-linguistic group referring to the people living in southeastern Panay and its associated culture. The boundaries of the language called Ilonggo and that called Hiligaynon are unclear. The disagreement of which name is correct extends to Philippine language specialists and native laypeople.

===Religion===
Iloilo is a Roman Catholic-predominated province comprising about 87% of the population. Independent Catholic and Protestant churches also exist such as members of Iglesia Filipina Independiente or Aglipayan Church, Baptists, Presbyterians, Methodists, Adventists, and other Evangelical Christians; There are also non-Protestant and other Christian sects such as Iglesia Ni Cristo, Church of Christ of Latter day Saints (Mormons) and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses while non-Christians are usually represented by Muslims, and to a lesser extent, Buddhists and Hindus.

==Economy==
Iloilo is one of the most competitive provinces in the Philippines, recognized for its strong economy, resilience, and effective governance. This collaboration has resulted in an economic boom that has generated thousands of jobs and propelled the province to become one of the richest in the country.

Its capital, Iloilo City, is one of the largest cities in the country in terms of economic activity. It serves as the economic center of the province and supports a wide range of industries and services, including real estate, accommodation, healthcare, education, retail, business, and IT/BPO sectors. It also functions as a key port for domestic and international trade. The city&#x27;s diverse economy significantly contributes to the overall development of the province.

Metro Iloilo, which includes the neighboring municipalities of Pavia, Oton, Leganes, and Santa Barbara, also plays a significant role in the province&#x27;s economy. Pavia is known as an agricultural-industrial center, combining farming with industrial developments, and is also recognized for its commercial centers and residential developments. Oton contributes with its agricultural production and emerging retail sector, and will soon host the largest central business district (CBD) in Iloilo. Leganes is notable for its light industries and hosts the province&#x27;s first agro-industrial economic zone, contributing to both agriculture and light manufacturing. Santa Barbara is known for its historical sites and a growing tourism industry.

The northern part of Iloilo is notable for its robust fishing industry and expanding tourism sector, benefiting from its proximity to the Visayan Sea and natural attractions like beaches and marine reserves. The central part of the province functions as an agri-industrial hub, producing a variety of agricultural products such as corn, rice, bananas, pineapples, and sugar. The highland areas, including Bucari in Leon and Alimodian, are known for high-value crops like strawberries and mangoes, and offer tourism opportunities through inland resorts and trekking sites.

The sugar industry is a key economic driver in Passi City and nearby towns like Lambunao, Dueñas, San Enrique, and Bingawan. In southern Iloilo, the economy is largely driven by tourism, with historical sites, colonial architecture, and coastal attractions in towns such as Tigbauan, Guimbal, Miagao, and San Joaquin playing a significant role in the local economy.

==Government==
The government of Iloilo was established in 1566 when the Spanish settled a colonial center in Ogtong (now Oton). Control was later shifted to La Villa Rica de Arevalo (now Arevalo, Iloilo City) in 1581, which also served as the seat of the Spanish Government overseeing vast territories encompassing Iloilo, Capiz, Aklan, Antique, and surrounding islands such as Negros, Guimaras, Cuyo, Palawan, Caluya, Romblon, and Boracay. Over time, these territories gained independence. By 1616, the seat of government was transferred to La Punta, now known as Iloilo City Proper. This relocation marked a significant increase in colonial power, and the city&#x27;s economy boomed, making it the largest in the Philippines after Manila during the Spanish period until the American period.

The Governor of Iloilo serves as the local chief executive of the province, with the official office located at the Iloilo Provincial Capitol. Historically, the governor, along with the alcalde-mayor and presidente municipal, held office at the Casa Real de Iloilo from 1869 until 2006, when the larger capitol building adjacent to it was completed.

==Culture==

The old buildings in downtown Iloilo showcase the influence of Spanish architecture, reflecting the historical presence of the Spaniards in the region. However, even before the arrival of the Mexicans, Spaniards, and other Europeans, Iloilo had already established trade relations with ancient Indonesians, Malaysians and Vietnamese, Indian, Arab, Chinese, Korean and Japanese merchants. The Spanish government encouraged foreign merchants to trade in Iloilo, although they were not granted land ownership privileges. Over time, intermarriage between foreign merchants, Spaniards, and the locals led to the emergence of the Mestizo class, who eventually became the ruling class of the Ilonggos, known as the Principalía.

Iloilo is also home to two of the nation&#x27;s cultural minorities: the Sulod-Bukidnon and the Ati. These indigenous groups contribute to the cultural diversity of the province and add to its vibrant tapestry of traditions and customs.

<doc id="266811" wikidata="Q194226" url="?curid=266811" title="Battle of the Yarmuk">
<text>The Battle of the Yarmuk (also spelled Yarmouk) was a major battle between the army of the Byzantine Empire and the Arab Muslim forces of the Rashidun Caliphate. The battle consisted of a series of engagements that lasted for six days in August 636, near the Yarmouk River (also called the Hieromyces River), along what are now the borders of Syria–Jordan and Syria-Israel, southeast of the Sea of Galilee. The result of the battle was a decisive Muslim victory that ended Roman rule in Syria after about seven centuries. The Battle of the Yarmuk is regarded as one of the most decisive battles in military history, and it marked the first great wave of early Muslim conquests after the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, heralding the rapid advance of Islam into the then-Christian/Roman Levant.

To check the Arab advance and to recover lost territory, Emperor Heraclius had sent a massive expedition to the Levant in May 636. As the Byzantine army approached, the Arabs tactically withdrew from Syria and regrouped all their forces at the Yarmuk plains close to the Arabian Peninsula, where they were reinforced, and defeated the numerically superior Byzantine army. The battle is widely regarded to be Khalid ibn al-Walid&#x27;s greatest military victory and to have cemented his reputation as one of the greatest tacticians and cavalry commanders in history.

==Background==

In 610, during the Byzantine–Sasanian War of 602–628, Heraclius became the emperor of the Byzantine Empire, after overthrowing Phocas. Meanwhile, the Sasanian Empire conquered Mesopotamia and in 611 they overran Syria and entered Anatolia, occupying Caesarea Mazaca (now Kayseri, Turkey). In 612, Heraclius managed to expel the Persians from Anatolia but was decisively defeated in 613 when he launched a major offensive in Syria against the Persians. Over the following decade, the Persians were able to conquer Palestine and Egypt. Meanwhile, Heraclius prepared for a counterattack and rebuilt his army.

In 622, Heraclius finally launched his offensive. After his overwhelming victories over the Persians and their allies in the Caucasus and Armenia, Heraclius launched a winter offensive against the Persians in Mesopotamia in 627, winning a decisive victory at the Battle of Nineveh, thus threatening the Persian capital city of Ctesiphon. Discredited by the series of disasters, Khosrow II was overthrown and killed in a coup led by his son Kavad II, who immediately sued for peace and agreed to withdraw from all occupied territories of the Byzantine Empire. Heraclius restored the True Cross to Jerusalem with a majestic ceremony in 629.

Meanwhile, there had been rapid political development in the Arabian Peninsula, where Muhammad had been preaching Islam and, by 630, had successfully annexed most of Arabia under a single political authority. When Muhammad died in June 632, Abu Bakr was chosen as caliph and his political successor. Troubles emerged soon after Abu Bakr&#x27;s succession, and several Arab tribes openly revolted against him. He declared war against the rebels. In what became known as the Ridda wars of 632–633, Abu Bakr managed to defeat his opponents and unite Arabia under the central authority of the caliph at Medina.
Once the rebels had been subdued, Abu Bakr began a war of conquest, beginning with Iraq. His most brilliant general, Khalid ibn al-Walid, conquered Iraq in a series of successful campaigns against the Sassanid Persians. Abu Bakr&#x27;s confidence grew, and once Khalid had established his stronghold in Iraq, Abu Bakr issued a call to arms for the invasion of Syria in February 634. The Muslim invasion of Syria was a series of carefully planned and well-co-ordinated military operations, which employed strategy, instead of pure strength, to deal with the Byzantine defensive measures.

The Muslim armies, however, soon proved to be too small to handle the Byzantine response, and their commanders called for reinforcements. Khalid was sent by Abu Bakr from Iraq to Syria with reinforcements and to lead the invasion. In July, the Byzantines were decisively defeated at Ajnadayn. Damascus fell in September, followed by the Battle of Fahl, in which the last significant garrison of Palestine was routed.

After Abu Bakr died in 634, his successor, Umar, was determined to continue the Caliphate&#x27;s expansion deeper into Syria. Though previous campaigns led by Khalid had been successful, he was replaced by Abu Ubaidah. Having secured southern Palestine, Muslim forces now advanced up the trade route, and Tiberias and Baalbek fell without much struggle and conquered Emesa early in 636. The Muslims then continued their conquest across the Levant.

==Byzantine counterattack==
Having seized Emesa, the Muslims were just a march away from Aleppo, a Byzantine stronghold, and Antioch, where Heraclius resided. Seriously alarmed by the series of setbacks, Heraclius prepared for a counterattack to reacquire the lost regions. In 635 Yazdegerd III, the Emperor of Persia, sought an alliance with the Byzantine Emperor. Heraclius married off his daughter (according to traditions, his granddaughter) Manyanh to Yazdegerd III, to cement the alliance. While Heraclius prepared for a major offensive in the Levant, Yazdegerd was to mount a simultaneous counterattack in Iraq, in what was meant to be a well-coordinated effort. When Heraclius launched his offensive in May 636, Yazdegerd could not co-ordinate with the maneuver, probably owing to the exhausted condition of his government, and what would have been a decisive plan missed the mark.
Byzantine preparations began in late 635 and by May 636 Heraclius had a large force concentrated at Antioch in Northern Syria. The assembled Byzantine army contingents consisted of Slavs, Franks, Georgians, Armenians, Christian Arabs, Lombards, Avars, Khazars, Balkans and Göktürks. The force was organized into five armies, the joint leader of which was Theodore Trithyrius. Vahan, an Armenian and the former garrison commander of Emesa, was made the overall field commander, and had under his command a purely Armenian army. Buccinator (Qanatir), a Slavic prince, commanded the Slavs and Jabalah ibn al-Aiham, king of the Ghassanid Arabs, commanded an exclusively Christian Arab force. The remaining contingents, all European, were placed under Gregory and Dairjan. Heraclius himself supervised the operation from Antioch. Byzantine sources mention Niketas, son of the Persian general Shahrbaraz, among the commanders, but it is not certain which army he commanded.

The Rashidun army was then split into four groups: one under Amr in Palestine, one under Shurahbil in Jordan, one under Yazid in the Damascus-Caesarea region and the last one under Abu Ubaidah along with Khalid at Emesa.

As the Muslim forces were geographically divided, Heraclius sought to exploit that situation and planned to attack. He did not wish to engage in a single pitched battle but rather to employ central position and fight the enemy in detail by concentrating large forces against each of the Muslim corps before they could consolidate their troops. By forcing the Muslims to retreat, or by destroying Muslim forces separately, he would fulfil his strategy of recapturing lost territory. Reinforcements were sent to Caesarea under Heraclius&#x27; son Constantine III, probably to tie down Yazid&#x27;s forces, which were besieging the town. The Byzantine imperial army moved out from Antioch and Northern Syria in the middle of June 636.

The Byzantine imperial army was to operate under the following plan:
*Jabalah&#x27;s lightly armed Christian Arabs would march to Emesa from Aleppo via Hama and hold the main Muslim army at Emesa.
*Dairjan would make a flanking movement between the coast and Aleppo&#x27;s road and approach Emesa from the west, striking at the Muslims&#x27; left flank while they were being held frontally by Jabalah.
*Gregory would strike the Muslims&#x27; right flank, approaching Emesa from the northeast via Mesopotamia.
*Qanatir would march along the coastal route and occupy Beirut, from where he was to attack the weakly defended Damascus from the west to cut off the main Muslim army at Emesa.
*Vahan&#x27;s corps would act as a reserve and would approach Emesa via Hama.

==Rashidun strategy==
The Muslims discovered Heraclius&#x27; preparations at Shaizar from Byzantine prisoners. Alert to the possibility of being caught with separated forces that could be destroyed, Khalid called a council of war and advised Abu Ubaidah to pull the troops back from Palestine and Northern and Central Syria and concentrate the entire Rashidun army in one place. Abu Ubaidah ordered the concentration of troops in the vast plain near Jabiyah, as control of the area made cavalry charges possible and facilitated the arrival of reinforcements from Umar, so that a strong, united force could be fielded against the Byzantine armies. The position also benefited from close proximity to the Rashidun stronghold of Najd, if retreat became necessary. Instructions were also issued to return jizya (tribute) to people who had paid it.

However, once concentrated at Jabiyah, the Muslims were subject to raids from pro-Byzantine Ghassanid forces. Encamping in the region was also precarious as a strong Byzantine force was garrisoned in Caeseara and could attack the Muslim rear while they were held in front by the Byzantine army. On Khalid&#x27;s advice the Muslim forces retreated to Dara&#x27;ah (or Dara) and Dayr Ayyub, covering the gap between the Yarmuk Gorges and the Harra lava plains, and established a line of camps in the eastern part of the plain of Yarmuk. This was a strong defensive position, and the maneuverers brought the Muslims and Byzantines into a decisive battle, which the latter had tried to avoid. During the maneuvers, there were no engagements except for a minor skirmish between Khalid&#x27;s elite light cavalry and the Byzantine advance guard.

==Battlefield==

The battlefield lies in the plain of Jordanian Hauran, just southeast of the Golan Heights, an upland region currently on the frontier between Jordan and Syria, east of the Sea of Galilee. The battle was fought on the plain east of Raqqat stream ravine. That ravine joins the Yarmuk River, a tributary of the Jordan River, on its south. The stream had very steep banks, ranging from – in height. On the north is the Jabiyah road and to the east are the Azra hills although the hills were outside the actual field of battle. Strategically, there was only one prominence in the battlefield: a elevation known as &quot;Tel al Jumm&#x27;a&quot;, and for the Muslim troops concentrated there, the hill gave a good view of the plain of Yarmuk. The ravine on the west of the battlefield was accessible at a few places in 636 AD, and had one main crossing: a Roman bridge (&quot;Jisr-ur-Ruqqad&quot;) near &quot;Ain Dhakar&quot; Logistically, the Yarmuk plain had enough water supplies and pastures to sustain both armies. The plain was excellent for cavalry maneuvers.

==Troop deployment==
Most early accounts place the size of the Muslim forces between 36,000 and 40,000 and the number of Byzantine forces between 60,000 and 70,000 (This number has been estimated by taking into account the logistical situation of the Empire and with the view that they could never have mustered such troops when the Empire was at its apex but especially not with the especially weak and exhausted realm of 628 onwards). Modern estimates for the sizes of the respective armies vary: some estimates for the Byzantine army are around 40,000 at most, while other estimates are 15,000 to 20,000. Estimates for the Rashidun army are between 15,000 and 40,000, most likely around 36,000. Original accounts are mostly from Arab sources, generally agreeing that the Byzantine army and their allies outnumbered the Muslim Arabs by a 2 to 1. The only early Byzantine source is Theophanes, who wrote a century later. Accounts of the battle vary, some stating it lasted a day, others six days.

===Rashidun army===
During a council of war, the command of the Muslim army was transferred to Khalid by Abu Ubaidah, Commander in Chief of the Muslim army.
After taking command, Khalid reorganized the army into 36 infantry regiments and four cavalry regiments, with his cavalry elite, the mobile guard, held in reserve. The army was organised in the &quot;Tabi&#x27;a&quot; formation, a tight, defensive infantry formation.
The army was lined up on a front of , facing west, with its left flank lying south on the Yarmuk River a mile before the ravines of Wadi al-Allan began. The army&#x27;s right flank was on the Jabiyah road in the north across the heights of &quot;Tel al Jumm&#x27;a&quot;, with substantial gaps between the divisions so that their frontage would match that of the Byzantine battle line at . The centre of the army was under the command of Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah (left centre) and Shurahbil bin Hasana (right centre). The left wing was under the command of Yazid and the right wing was under Amr ibn al-A&#x27;s.

The centre, left and right wings were given cavalry regiments, to be used as a reserve for a counterattack if they were pushed back by the Byzantines. Behind the centre stood the mobile guard under the personal command of Khalid. If Khalid was too occupied in leading the general army, Dharar ibn al-Azwar would command the mobile guard. Over the course of the battle, Khalid would repeatedly make critical and decisive use of that mounted reserve.

Khalid sent out several scouts to keep the Byzantines under observation. In late July, Vahan sent Jabalah with his lightly armoured Christian-Arab forces to reconnoitre-in-force, but they were repulsed by the mobile guard. After the skirmish, no engagement occurred for a month.

====Weaponry====
Helmets used included gilded helmets similar to the silver helmets of the Sassanid empire. Mail was commonly used to protect the face, neck, and cheeks as an aventail from the helmet or as a mail coif. Heavy leather sandals, as well as Roman-type sandal boots, were also typical of the early Muslim soldiers. Armour included hardened leather scale or lamellar armour and mail armour. Infantry soldiers were more heavily armoured than horsemen. Large wooden or wickerwork shields were used. Long-shafted spears were used, with infantry spears being long and cavalry spears being up to long. Short infantry swords like the Roman gladius and Sassanid long swords were used; long swords were usually carried by horsemen. Swords were hung in baldrics. Bows were about long when unbraced, similar in size to the famous English longbow. The maximum useful range of the traditional Arabian bow was about . Early Muslim archers, while being infantry archers without the mobility of horseback archer regiments, proved to be very effective in defending against light and unarmoured cavalry attacks.

===Byzantine army===
A few days after the Muslims encamped at the Yarmuk plain, the Byzantine army, preceded by the lightly armed Ghassanids of Jabalah, moved forward and established strongly fortified camps just north of the Wadi-ur-Ruqqad.

The right flank of the Byzantine army was at the south end of the plains, near the Yarmuk River and about a mile before the ravines of &quot;Wadi al Allan&quot; began. The left flank of the Byzantines was at the north, a short distance before the Hills of Jabiyah began, and was relatively exposed. Vahan deployed the Imperial Army facing east, with a front about long, as he was trying to cover the whole area between the Yarmuk gorge in the south and the Roman road to Egypt in the north, and substantial gaps had been left between the Byzantine divisions. The right wing was commanded by Gregory and the left by Qanatir. The centre was formed by the army of Dairjan and the Armenian army of Vahan, both under the overall command of Dairjan. The Byzantine regular heavy cavalry, the cataphract, was distributed equally among the four armies, each army deploying its infantry at the forefront and its cavalry as a reserve in the rear. Vahan deployed Jabalah&#x27;s Christian Arabs, mounted on horses and camels, as a skirmishing force, screening the main army until its arrival.

Early Muslim sources mention that the army of Gregory had used chains to link together its foot soldiers, who had all taken an oath of death. The chains were in 10-man lengths as a proof of unshakeable courage on the part of the men, who thus displayed their willingness to die where they stood and not to retreat. The chains also acted as an insurance against a breakthrough by enemy cavalry. However, modern historians suggest that the Byzantines adopted the Graeco-Roman testudo military formation in which soldiers would stand shoulder-to-shoulder with shields held high and an arrangement of 10 to 20 men would be completely shielded on all sides from missile fire, each soldier providing cover for an adjoining companion.

====Weaponry====
The Byzantine cavalry was armed with a long sword, known as the &quot;spathion&quot;. They would also have had a light wooden lance, known as a &quot;kontarion&quot; and a bow (&quot;toxarion&quot;) with forty arrows in a quiver, hung from a saddle or from the belt. Heavy infantry, known as &quot;skoutatoi&quot;, had a short sword and a short spear. The lightly armed Byzantine troops and the archers carried a small shield, a bow hung from the shoulder across the back and a quiver of arrows. Cavalry armour consisted of a hauberk with a mail coif and a helmet with a pendant: a throat-guard lined with fabric and having a fringe and cheek piece. Infantry was similarly equipped with a hauberk, a helmet and leg armour. Light lamellar and scale armour was also used.

==Tensions in Byzantine army==
Khalid&#x27;s strategy of withdrawing from the occupied areas and concentrating all of his troops for a decisive battle forced the Byzantines to concentrate their five armies in response. The Byzantines had for centuries avoided engaging in large-scale decisive battles, and the concentration of their forces created logistical strains for which the empire was ill-prepared.

Damascus was the closest logistical base, but Mansur, leader of Damascus, could not fully supply the massive Byzantine army that was gathered at the Yarmuk plain. Several clashes were reported with local citizens over supply requisition, as summer was at an end and there was a decline of pasturage. Greek court sources accused Vahan of treason for his disobedience to Heraclius&#x27; command not to engage in large-scale battle with Arabs. Given the massing of the Muslim armies at Yarmuk, however, Vahan had little choice but to respond in kind. Relations between the various Byzantine commanders were also fraught with tension. There was a struggle for power between Trithurios and Vahan, Jarajis, and Qanatir (Buccinator). Jabalah, the Christian Arab leader, was largely ignored, to the detriment of the Byzantines given his knowledge of the local terrain. An atmosphere of mistrust thus existed between the Romans, Armenians and Arabs. Longstanding ecclesiastical feuds between the Monophysite and Chalcedonian factions, of negligible direct impact, certainly inflamed underlying tensions. The effect of the feuds was decreased coordination and planning, one of the reasons for the catastrophic Byzantine defeat.

==Battle==
The battle lines of the Muslims and the Byzantines were divided into four sections: the left wing, the left centre, the right centre and the right wing. Note that the descriptions of the Muslim and the Byzantine battle lines are exactly each other&#x27;s opposite: the Muslim right wing faced the Byzantine left wing (see image).
Vahan was instructed by Heraclius not to engage in battle until all avenues of diplomacy had been explored, probably because Yazdegerd III&#x27;s forces were not yet ready for the offensive in Iraq. Accordingly, Vahan sent Gregory and then Jabalah to negotiate, but their efforts proved futile. Before the battle, on Vahan&#x27;s invitation, Khalid came to negotiate peace, with a similar end. The negotiations delayed the battles for a month.

On the other hand, Umar, whose forces at Qadisiyah were threatened with confronting the Sassanid armies, ordered Sa&#x27;d ibn Abi Waqqas to enter negotiations with the Persians and to send emissaries to Yazdegerd III and his commander Rostam Farrokhzād, apparently inviting them to Islam. That was most probably the delaying tactic employed by Umar on the Persian front. Meanwhile, he sent reinforcements of 6,000 troops, mostly from Yemen, to Khalid. The force included 1,000 Sahaba (companions of Muhammad), among whom were 100 veterans of the Battle of Badr, the first battle in Islamic history, and included citizens of the highest rank, such as Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, Abu Sufyan, and his wife Hind bint Utbah.

Also present were such distinct companions as Sa&#x27;id ibn Zayd, Fadl ibn Abbas, Abdul-Rahman ibn Abi Bakr (the son of Abu Bakr), Abdullah ibn Umar (the son of Umar), Aban ibn Uthman (the son of Uthman), Abdulreman ibn Khalid (the son of Khalid), Abdullah ibn Ja&#x27;far (the nephew of Ali), Ammar ibn Yasir, Miqdad ibn Aswad, Abu Dharr al-Ghifari, Malik al-Ashtar, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, Qays ibn Sa&#x27;d, Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, Ubada ibn as-Samit, Hisham ibn al-A&#x27;as, Abu Huraira and Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl. As it was a citizen army, in contrast to a mercenary army, the age of the soldiers ranged from 20 (in the case of Khalid&#x27;s son) to 70 (in the case of Ammar). Three of the ten companions promised paradise by Muhammad, namely Sa&#x27;id, Zubayr and Abu Ubaidah, were present at Yarmuk.

Umar, apparently wanting to defeat the Byzantines first, used the best Muslim troops against them. The continuing stream of Muslim reinforcements worried the Byzantines, who fearing that the Muslims with such reinforcements would grow powerful, decided that they had no choice but to attack. The reinforcements that were sent to the Muslims at Yarmuk arrived in small bands, giving the impression of a continuous stream of reinforcements to demoralize the Byzantines to compel them to attack. The same tactic would be repeated again during the Battle of Qadisiyah.

===Day 1===
The battle began on 15 August. At dawn, both armies lined up for battle less than a mile apart. It is recorded in Muslim chronicles that before the battle started, George, a unit commander in the Byzantine right centre, rode up to the Muslim line and converted to Islam; he would die the same day fighting on the Muslim side. The battle began as the Byzantine army sent its champions to duel with the Muslim mubarizun. The mubarizun were specially trained swordsmen and lancers, with the objective to slay as many enemy commanders as possible to damage their morale. At midday, after losing a number of commanders in the duels, Vahan ordered a limited attack with a third of his infantry forces to test the strength and strategy of the Muslim army and, using their overwhelming numerical and weaponry superiority, achieve a breakthrough wherever the Muslim battle line was weak. However the Byzantine assault lacked determination; many Byzantine soldiers were unable to press the attack against the Muslim veterans. The fighting was generally moderate although in some places, it was especially intense. Vahan did not reinforce his forward infantry, two thirds of which was kept in reserve with one third deployed to engage the Muslims, and at sunset, both armies broke contact and returned to their respective camps.

===Day 2===


Phase 1: On 16 August, Vahan decided in a council of war to launch his attack just before dawn, to catch the Muslim force unprepared as they conducted their morning prayers.
He planned to engage his two central armies with the Muslim centre in an effort to stall them while the main thrusts would be against the wings of the Muslim army, which would then be driven away from the battlefield or pushed towards the centre. To observe the battlefield, Vahan had a large pavilion built behind his right wing with an Armenian bodyguard force. He ordered the army to prepare for the surprise attack.

However, Khalid had prepared for such a contingency by placing a strong outpost line in front during the night to counter surprises, which gave the Muslims time to prepare for battle. At the centre, the Byzantines did not press hard, intending to pin down the Muslim centre corps in their position and preventing them from aiding the Muslim army in other areas. Thus the centre remained stable, but on the wings the situation was different. Qanatir, commanding the Byzantine left flank, which consisted of mainly Slavs, attacked in force, and the Muslim infantry on the right flank had to retreat. Amr, the Muslim right wing commander ordered his cavalry regiment to counterattack, which neutralized the Byzantine advance and stabilized the battle line on the right for some time, but the Byzantine numerical superiority caused them to retreat towards the Muslim base camp.

Phase 2: Khalid, aware of the situation at the wings, ordered the cavalry of the right wing to attack the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing while he with his mobile guard attacked the southern flank of the Byzantine left wing, and the Muslim right wing infantry attacked from the front. The three-pronged attack forced the Byzantine left wing to abandon the Muslim positions they had gained on, and Amr regained his lost ground and started reorganizing his corps for another round.

The situation on the Muslim left wing, which Yazid commanded was considerably more serious. The Muslim right wing enjoyed assistance from the mobile guard but not the left wing, and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. There, the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory&#x27;s army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defence. Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps and for a moment Vahan&#x27;s plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken though morale was severely damaged.

The retreating Muslim army was met by the ferocious Arab women in the camps. Led by Hind, the Muslim women dismantled their tents, and armed with tent poles, charged at their husbands and fellow men singing an improvised song from the Battle of Uhud, which then had been directed against the Muslims.

That boiled the blood of the retreating Muslims so much that they returned to the battlefield.

Phase 3: After managing to stabilize the position on the right flank, Khalid ordered the mobile guard cavalry to provide relief to the battered left flank.

Khalid detached one regiment under Dharar ibn al-Azwar and ordered him to attack the front of the army of Dairjan (left centre) to create a diversion and threaten the withdrawal of the Byzantine right wing from its advanced position. With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory&#x27;s flank. Here again, under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell back but more slowly because they had to maintain their formation.

At sunset, the central armies broke contact and withdrew to their original positions and both fronts were restored along the lines occupied in the morning. The death of Dairjan and the failure of Vahan&#x27;s battle plan left the larger Imperial army relatively demoralized, but Khalid&#x27;s successful counterattacks emboldened his troops despite their being smaller in number.

===Day 3===

On 17 August, Vahan pondered over his failures and mistakes of the previous day, where he launched attacks against respective Muslim flanks, but after initial success, his men were pushed back. What bothered him the most was the loss of one of his commanders.

The Byzantine army decided on a less ambitious plan, and Vahan now aimed to break the Muslim army at specific points. He decided to press upon the relatively exposed right flank, where his mounted troops could maneuver more freely as compared to the rugged terrain at the Muslims&#x27; left flank. The junction was to be between the Muslim right centre, its right wing held by Qanatir&#x27;s Slavs, to break them apart so that they would be fought separately.

Phase 1: The battle resumed with Byzantine attacks on the Muslim right flank and right centre.

After holding off the initial attacks by the Byzantines, the Muslim right wing fell back, followed by the right centre. They were again said to have been met by their own women, who abused and shamed them. The corps, however, managed to reorganize some distance from the camp and held their ground preparing for a counterattack.

Phase 2: Knowing that the Byzantine army was focusing on the Muslim right, Khalid ibn al-Walid launched an attack with his mobile guard, along with the Muslim right flank cavalry. Khalid ibn al-Walid struck at the right flank of the Byzantines left centre, and the cavalry reserve of the Muslims right centre struck at the Byzantines left centre at its left flank. Meanwhile, he ordered the Muslims&#x27; right-wing cavalry to strike at the left flank of the Byzantines left wing. The combat soon developed into a bloodbath. Many fell on both sides. Khalid&#x27;s timely flanking attacks again saved the day for Muslims and by dusk, the Byzantines had been pushed back to the positions they had at the start of the battle.

===Day 4===

Phase 1: Vahan decided to persist with the previous day&#x27;s war plan as he had been successful in inflicting damage on the Muslim right.

Qanatir led two armies of Slavs against the Muslim right wing and right centre with some assistance from the Armenians and Christian Arabs led by Jabalah. The Muslim right wing and right centre again fell back.
Khalid entered the fray yet again with the mobile guard. He feared a general attack on a broad front, which he would be unable to repulse, and so ordered Abu Ubaidah and Yazid on the left centre and the left wings, respectively, to attack the Byzantine armies at the respective fronts. The attack would result in stalling the Byzantine front and prevent a general advance of the Imperial army.

Phase 2: Khalid divided his mobile guard into two divisions and attacked the flanks of the Byzantine left centre, and the infantry of the Muslim right centre attacked from the front. Under the three-pronged flanking maneuver, the Byzantines fell back. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing renewed its offense with its infantry attacking from the front and the cavalry reserve attacking the northern flank of the Byzantine left wing. As the Byzantine left centre retreated under three-pronged attacks of Khalid, the Byzantine left wing, having been exposed at its southern flank, also fell back.

While Khalid and his mobile guard were dealing with the Armenian front throughout the afternoon, the situation on the other end was worsening. Byzantine horse-archers had taken to the field and subjected Abu Ubaidah and Yazid&#x27;s troops to intense archery preventing them from penetrating their Byzantine lines. Many Muslim soldiers lost their sight to Byzantine arrows on that day, which thereafter became known as the &quot;Day of Lost Eyes&quot;. The veteran Abu Sufyan is also believed to have lost an eye that day. The Muslim armies fell back except for one regiment, led by Ikrimah bin Abi Jahal, which was on the left of Abu Ubaidah&#x27;s corps. Ikrimah covered the retreat of the Muslims with his 400 members of the cavalry by attacking the Byzantine front, and the other armies reorganized themselves to counterattack and regain their lost positions. All of Ikrimah&#x27;s men were either seriously injured or dead that day. Ikrimah, a childhood friend of Khalid, was mortally wounded and died later in the evening.

===Day 5===
During the four-day offence of Vahan, his troops had failed to achieve any breakthrough and had suffered heavy casualties, especially during the mobile guard&#x27;s flanking counterattacks. Early on 19 August, the fifth day of the battle, Vahan sent an emissary to the Muslim camp for a truce for the next few days so that fresh negotiations could be held. He supposedly wanted time to reorganize his demoralized troops, but Khalid deemed victory to be in reach and he declined the offer.

Until now, the Muslim army had adopted a largely defensive strategy, but knowing that the Byzantines were apparently no longer eager for battle, Khalid now decided to take the offensive and reorganized his troops accordingly. All cavalry regiments were grouped together into one powerful mounted force with the mobile guard acting as its core. The total strength of the cavalry group was now about 8,000 mounted warriors, an effective mounted corps for an offensive attack the next day. The rest of the day passed uneventfully. Khalid planned to trap Byzantine troops, cutting off their every route of escape. There were three natural barriers, the three gorges in the battlefield with their steep ravines, &quot;Wadi-ur-Ruqqad&quot; at west, &quot;Wadi al Yarmouk&quot; in south and &quot;Wadi al Allah&quot; in east. The northern route was to be blocked by Muslim cavalry.

There were however, some passages across the deep ravines of Wadi-ur-Raqqad in west, strategically the most important one was at Ayn al Dhakar, a bridge. Khalid sent Dharar with 500 cavalry at night to secure that bridge. Dharar moved around the northern flank of Byzantines and captured the bridge, a maneuver that was to prove decisive the next day.

===Day 6===

On 20 August, Khalid put into action a simple but bold plan of attack. With his massed cavalry force, he intended to drive the Byzantine cavalry entirely off the battlefield so that the infantry, which formed the bulk of the imperial army, would be left without cavalry support and thus would be exposed when attacked from the flanks and rear.
At the same time, he planned to push a determined attack to turn the left flank of the Byzantine army and drive them towards the ravine to the west.

Phase 1: Khalid ordered a general attack on the Byzantine front and galloped his cavalry around the left wing of the Byzantines. Part of his cavalry engaged the Byzantine left wing cavalry while the rest of it attacked the rear of the Byzantine left wing infantry. Meanwhile, the Muslim right wing pressed against it from the front. Under the two-pronged attack, the Byzantine left wing fell back and collapsed and fell back to the Byzantine left centre, greatly disordering it. The remaining Muslim cavalry then attacked the Byzantine left wing cavalry at the rear while they were held frontally by the other half of the Muslim cavalry, routing them off the battlefield to the north.
The Muslim right-wing infantry now attacked the Byzantine left centre at its left flank while the Muslim right centre attacked from front.

Phase 2: Vahan, noticing the huge cavalry maneuver of the Muslims, ordered his cavalry to group together, but was not quick enough. Before Vahan could organize his disparate heavy cavalry squadrons, Khalid had wheeled his cavalry back to attack the concentrating Byzantine cavalry squadrons, falling upon them from the front and the flank while they were still moving into formation. The disorganized and disoriented Byzantine heavy cavalry was soon routed and dispersed to the north, leaving the infantry to its fate.

Phase 3: With the Byzantine cavalry completely routed, Khalid turned to the Byzantine left centre, which already held the two-pronged attack of the Muslim infantry. The Byzantine left centre was attacked at its rear by Khalid&#x27;s cavalry and was finally broken.

Phase 4: With the retreat of the Byzantine left centre, a general Byzantine retreat started. Khalid took his cavalry north to block the northern route of escape. The Byzantines retreated west towards &quot;Wadi-ur-Ruqqad&quot;, where there was a bridge at &quot;Ayn al Dhakar&quot; for safe crossing across the deep gorges of the ravines of Wadi-ur-Ruqqad. Dharar had already captured the bridge as part of Khalid&#x27;s plan the night before. A unit of 500 mounted troops had been sent to block the passageway. In fact, that was the route by which Khalid wanted the Byzantines to retreat all along.
The Byzantines were surrounded from all sides now.

Some fell into the deep ravines off the steep slopes, others tried to escape in the waters but were smashed on the rocks below and still others were killed in their flight. Nevertheless, many of the soldiers managed to escape the slaughter. Jonah, the Greek informant of the Rashidun army during the conquest of Damascus, died in the battle. The Muslims took no prisoners in the battle, but they may have captured some during the subsequent pursuit. Theodore Trithyrius was killed on the battlefield, and Niketas managed to escape and reach Emesa. Jabalah ibn al-Ayham also managed to escape and later briefly came to terms with the Muslims, but he soon defected to the Byzantine court again.

==Aftermath==
Immediately after the operation was over, Khalid and his mobile guard moved north to pursue the retreating Byzantine soldiers and found them near Damascus and attacked. Vahan, who had escaped the fate of most of his men at Yarmuk, was probably killed in the ensuing fighting. Khalid then entered Damascus, where he was welcomed by the local residents, thus recapturing the city.

When news of the disaster reached Heraclius at Antioch, the emperor was devastated and enraged. He blamed his wrongdoings for the loss, primarily referring to his incestuous marriage to his niece Martina.
He would have tried to reconquer the province if he had the resources but now had neither the men nor the money to defend the province any more. Instead, he retreated to the cathedral of Antioch, where he observed a solemn service of intercession. He summoned a meeting of his advisers at the cathedral and scrutinized the situation. He was told almost unanimously and accepted the fact that the defeat was God&#x27;s decision and a result of the sins of the people of the land, including him. Heraclius took to the sea on a ship to Constantinople in the night.

His ship supposedly set sail, and he bade a last farewell to Syria,:&quot;Farewell, a long farewell to Syria, my fair province. Thou art an infidel&#x27;s (enemy&#x27;s) now. Peace be with you, O Syria—what a beautiful land you will be for the enemy&#x27;s hands&quot;.&quot;&quot;Heraclius abandoned Syria with the holy relic of the True Cross, which was, along with other relics held at Jerusalem, secretly boarded on ship by Sophronius, Patriarch of Jerusalem, just to protect it from the invading Arabs. It is said that he had a fear of water, and a pontoon bridge was made for Heraclius to cross the Bosphorus to Constantinople. After abandoning Syria, he began to concentrate on his remaining forces for the defence of Anatolia and Egypt instead. Byzantine Armenia fell to the Muslims in 638–39, and Heraclius created a buffer zone in central Anatolia by ordering all the forts east of Tarsus to be evacuated.

In 639–642 the Muslims, led by Amr ibn al-A&#x27;as, who had commanded the right flank of the Rashidun army at Yarmuk, invaded and captured Byzantine Egypt.

==Evaluation==
The Imperial Byzantine commanders allowed their enemy to have the battlefield of his choosing. Even then, they were at no substantial tactical disadvantage. Khalid knew all along that he was up against a force superior in numbers and, until the last day of the battle, conducted an essentially defensive campaign, suited to his relatively limited resources. When he decided to take the offensive and attack on the final day of battle, he did so with a degree of imagination, foresight and courage that none of the Byzantine commanders managed to display. Although he commanded a smaller force and needed all the men he could muster, he had the confidence and foresight to dispatch a cavalry regiment the night before his assault to seal off a critical path of the retreat that he had anticipated for the enemy army.

Because of his leadership at Yarmuk, Khalid ibn al-Walid is considered one of the finest generals in history, and his use of mounted warriors throughout the battle showed just how well he understood the potential strengths and weaknesses of his mounted troops. His mobile guard moved quickly from one point to another, always changed the course of events wherever they appeared, and, then just as quickly, galloped away to change the course of events elsewhere on the field.

Vahan and his Byzantine commanders did not manage to deal with the mounted force and use the sizable advantage of their army effectively. Their own Byzantine cavalry never played a significant role in the battle and were held in static reserve for most of the six days. They never pushed their attacks, and even when they obtained what could have been a decisive breakthrough on the fourth day, they were unable to exploit it. There appeared to be a decided lack of resolve among the Imperial commanders, but that may have been caused by difficulties commanding the army because of internal conflict. Moreover, many of the Arab auxiliaries were mere levies, but the Muslim Arab army consisted for a much larger part of veteran troops.

The original strategy of Heraclius, to destroy the Muslim troops in Syria, needed a rapid and quick deployment, but the commanders on the ground never displayed those qualities. Ironically, on the field at Yarmuk, Khalid carried out, on a small tactical scale, what Heraclius had planned on a grand strategic scale. By rapidly deploying and maneuvering his forces, Khalid was able to concentrate sufficient forces at specific locations on the field temporarily to defeat the larger Byzantine army in detail. Vahan was never able to make his numerical superiority count, perhaps because of the terrain, which prevented large-scale deployment.

However, Vahan never attempted to concentrate a superior force to achieve a critical breakthrough. Although he was on the offensive five out of the six days, his battle line remained remarkably static. That stands in stark contrast to the very successful offensive plan, which Khalid carried out on the final day by reorganising virtually all his cavalry and committing it to a grand maneuver, which won the battle.

George F. Nafziger, in his book &quot;Islam at war&quot;, described the battle:

<text>Negros Occidental (; ), officially the Province of Negros Occidental (; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the Negros Island Region. Its capital is the city of Bacolod, of which it is geographically situated and grouped under by the Philippine Statistics Authority, but remains politically independent from the provincial government and also one of the two regional centers in Negros Island Region (the other one is Dumaguete). It occupies the northwestern half of the large island of Negros, and borders Negros Oriental, which comprises the southeastern half. Known as the &quot;Sugarbowl of the Philippines&quot;, Negros Occidental produces more than half the nation&#x27;s sugar output.

Negros Occidental faces the island-province of Guimaras and the province of Iloilo on Panay Island to the northwest across Panay Gulf and the Guimaras Strait. The primary spoken language is Hiligaynon and the predominant religious denomination is Roman Catholicism. Bacolod is the capital, seat of government and the largest city of the province (by population), but is governed independently as a highly urbanized city. With a population of 2,623,172 inhabitants, it is the most populated province in Negros Island Region, the second most-populous province in the Visayas after Cebu and the 8th most-populous province of the Philippines. The province also has the most chartered cities among all the provinces in the Philippines with a total of 13.

==History==
===Spanish colonial era===

Negros was originally known to the natives as &quot;Buglas&quot;, meaning &quot;cut off&quot; in old Hiligaynon. When the Spaniards arrived in April 1565, they named it &quot;Negros&quot; because of the dark-skinned natives they found. Two of the earliest native settlements were Binalbagan and Ilog which later became towns in 1572 and 1584, respectively. Other settlements were Hinigaran, Bago, Marayo (now Pontevedra), Mamalan (now Himamaylan) and Candaguit (now a sitio of San Enrique).

Ilog was made the first capital of the province in 1743. This was later transferred to Himamaylan. Bacolod finally became the capital in 1849. The island was divided into Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental in 1890. The two provinces were briefly unified as the independent Cantonal Republic of Negros, with Bacolod as the capital on November 27, 1898.

===America invasion era===
The Cantonal Republic of Negros became a protectorate of the United States until 1901, when the republic was dissolved, with the two provinces annexed back to the Philippines. During the succeeding decades between 1901 and the 1930s, Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental were both under Insular Government of the United States of America as with the rest of the nation and later under the Government of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. Economic growth continued especially with Philippine sugar having a part of the US market. The socio-economic lives of the island of Negros, from the 1950s up to the late 1980s, depended as before, mainly on the sugar industry.

From 1914 to 1927, parts of Western Negros hosted several newly established settlements which became cities connected by railroads constructed to flow towards several &quot;sugar centrals&quot; which were processing the extremely sweet raw sugar canes grown in Negros&#x27; volcanic soil and farmed by several &quot;Haciendas&quot;. These haciendas littered the countryside as the central sugar mills eventually grew to become full pledged towns and cities: chief among which were Ilog, Hinigaran, La Carlota, Silay, Pulupandan, Bacolod, San Carlos and Bais 

Western Negros also saw massive immigration from Panay as the Spanish, Chinese, and French mestizos who administered the Haciendas imported laborers from Panay island to foster the farming of Negros&#x27; sugar plantations and thereby displacing the Cebuano speaking natives.

===Japanese occupation era===
During World War II, both Negros provinces were invaded by Imperial Japanese forces, resorting many residents to flee to the inland mountains. Negros Island was liberated by combined Philippine &amp; American troops with the local Negrense guerillas attacking the Japanese on August 6, 1945. The 7th, 73rd, 74th and 75th Infantry Divisions of the Philippine Commonwealth Army were established from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the 7th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was active from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, at the Military General Headquarters in Negros Occidental. They started the engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial Military Operations in Negros from 1942 to 1945 against the Japanese Imperial forces.

===Philippine independence===
==== The Negros Famine ====

By the time Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; second term began, sugar had become a critical Philippine export, responsible for 27% of the county&#x27;s total dollar earnings. With international sugar prices rising rapidly through the early 1970s, Marcos decided to put domestic and international sugar trading under government control, first through the Philippine Exchange Co. (Philex), and later through the Philippine Sugar Commission (Philsucom) and its trading arm, the National Sugar Trading Corporation (NASUTRA), which were both controlled by Marcos crony Roberto Benedicto.

However, the international price of sugar eventually crashed. Quality of life and sugar production were intertwined, so lower production meant lower quality of life for thousands that relied on the industry for sustenance and financial stability. The NASUTRA monopoly forced many sugar planters into bankruptcy or deep in debt. In 1984, over 190,000 sugar workers lost their livelihood, and about a million &quot;sacadas&quot; and their families in Negros suffered in what would later become known as the &quot;Negros Famine.&quot; The percentage of malnourished infants eventually went up to as high as 78%. Negros Occidental&#x27;s problem on malnourished infants gained global prominence among the press in 1985, as they ran covers on both, local and international newspapers. 

==== Maricalum mining disaster ====
The Province has a history of problems with mine pollution, one of the worst episodes being the tailings dam failure and spill of 28 million tonnes of copper mine tailings from a mine of the Maricalum company on November 8, 1982

==== The Escalante Massacre====

During the 1970s and 1980s, atrocities against peasants were committed, with one such harrowing example being the Escalante Massacre.

==== Creation and abolition of Negros del Norte ====
Negros del Norte was created from Negros Occidental on January 3, 1986, but its creation was declared unconstitutional on July 11, 1986, and was immediately abolished on August 18, 1986.

====Post-EDSA Revolution====

Towards the end of 1987, after the successful overthrow of the Marcos regime, the overall economic situation started to show a positive upturn. The campaign for agricultural diversification had been gaining momentum, paving the way for more landowners to invest in prawn and fish farming, seafood catching, raising of livestock and high-value organic produce such as fruits and vegetables, as well as other cash crops. Investments&#x27; upswing became apparent by 1988. The participation of the industrial sector accelerated the consumer-led economic growth and development manifested with the increase in sales of consumer goods and by-products. Today, Negros Occidental remains one of the most progressive and largely developed Philippine provinces, in large due to the profits from the sugar industry, but also due to economic diversification in other fields. Due to the vast population of Negros Occidental, it became the province with the most number of cities outside of the National Capital Region.

===Contemporary===
On May 29, 2015, the Negros Island Region was formed when Negros Occidental and its capital was separated from Western Visayas and transferred to the new region along with Negros Oriental, when President Benigno Aquino III signed &quot;Executive Order No. 183, s. 2015&quot;. But it was abolished on August 9, 2017, when President Rodrigo Duterte revoked &quot;Executive Order No. 183, s. 2015&quot; through the signage of &quot;Executive Order No. 38&quot;, citing the reason of the lack of funds to fully establish the NIR according to Benjamin Diokno, the Secretary of Budget and Management, reverting Negros Occidental and its capital back into Western Visayas. However, with the Philippines&#x27; current presidential administration promoting federalism, the idea of the twin provinces of Negros Occidental and Negros Oriental reunified into one federal state/region is already in the talks of local provincial politicians, with additional support from the native Negrenses. There is also a suggestion, jointly approved by the provincial governors, that Negros Occidental along with Negros Oriental, be renamed with their pre-colonial names as &quot;&quot;Buglas Nakatundan&quot; and &quot;Buglas Sidlakan&quot; respectively, with Negros, as a federal state, be named as &quot;Negrosanon Federated Region&quot;, due to the Negro associated with the name &quot;Negros&quot;&quot;.

==Geography==
Negros Occidental is located in the western side of Negros Island, the fourth largest island in the Philippines, with a total land area of . If Bacolod is included for geographical purposes, the province has an area of . The province is approximately long from north to south. The Visayan Sea bounds it in the north, Panay Gulf on the west, the Tañon Strait on the east, the province of Negros Oriental on the southeast, and Sulu Sea on the southwest. 

Much of Negros Occidental is composed of plains and gentle slopes, the former of which dominate the northern and central parts of the province. Since the whole island is volcanic, its soil is ideal for agriculture. Eighty percent of all arable land in the island region is cultivated. Beaches also dot its coastal areas, such as those located in Sipalay, the Sipaway Island in San Carlos, and the Lakawon Island in Cadiz. In contrast, the southwestern section of the province is more mountainous and hilly; some are situated at least 100 meters above sea level. The mountain range in the southeastern part of the province serves as its basis of boundary with Negros Oriental. Kanlaon volcano is the province&#x27;s highest peak (sharing it with Negros Oriental), as well as of the entire Visayas region, rising to a height of above sea level. Mount Mandalagan is the province&#x27;s second highest mountain (as well as the highest mountain located &quot;wholly&quot; in the province), being situated above mean sea level. 

Slopes and areas close to Mandalagan are heavily forested. The Northern Negros Natural Park is a forest reserve located in these areas. Initially established as a forest reserve in 1935, it was converted to a natural park in 2005. Numerous diverse arrays of fauna and flora, some of which are endemic to its forests, dominate the entire park.

=== Climate ===

Negros Occidental has a tropical climate due to the fact that it is situated close to the equator, being located at least nine degrees north of it. The northern section of the province has a tropical rainforest (Köppen: &quot;Af&quot;) climate, whereas the southern portion has a tropical monsoon (Köppen: &quot;Am&quot;) climate. Mount Kanlaon itself, along with its higher-elevated slopes, are classified as having a dry-winter subtropical highland climate (Köppen: &quot;Cwb&quot;) due to their higher elevations, allowing for a significantly cooler temperature compared to the province as a whole.

Under the Coronas climate classification, Negros Occidental is situated under the Type III climate. This means that the province has a relatively short dry season from November to April, while remaining wet for the rest of the year. Occasionally, the southwestern section is classified as a Type I climate, with more pronounced wet and dry seasons.

While most of the province has temperatures expected for a tropical climate, some places are cooler, particularly the localities located close to Mandalagan, Kanlaon, and the mountain range near its border. More specifically, the towns of Don Salvador Benedicto and Candoni boast average temperatures somewhat lower compared to those situated at the coast.

===Administrative divisions===
Negros Occidental comprises 19 municipalities and 13 cities (one highly-urbanized and twelve component), further subdivided into 662 barangays. It has the most chartered cities among all the provinces in the Philippines. Although Bacolod serves as the capital, it is governed independently from the province as a highly urbanized city.



==Demographics==


The population of Negros Occidental in the 2020 census was 2,623,172 people, with a density of . If Bacolod is included for geographical and statistical purposes, the total population is 3,223,955 people, with a density of .

Negros Occidental is the second most-populous province in the Visayas after Cebu, having the second largest number of congressional districts and the 7th most-populous (4th if highly urbanized cities and independent component cities are included in the population of corresponding provinces) in the Philippines based on the 2015 Census. As of 2010, the population of registered voters are 1,478,260.

Residents of Negros are called &quot;Negrenses&quot; (and less often &quot;Negrosanons&quot;) and many are of either pure or mixed Austronesian heritage, with foreign ancestry (i.e. Chinese and/or Spanish) as minorities. 

===Languages===
Negros Occidental is predominantly a Hiligaynon-speaking province with 84% of residents speaking it as a first language, because of its linguistic ties with Iloilo. Cebuano is spoken by the remaining 16%, especially in the cities and towns facing the Tañon Strait, due to their proximity to the island-province of Cebu, and the province&#x27;s eastern parts that border Negros Oriental. A mixture of Hiligaynon and Cebuano is spoken in Sagay and surrounding places, which both face Iloilo and Cebu. Filipino and English are widely spoken and used on both sides of the island for educational, literary and official purposes.

===Religion===

Catholicism is the predominant religion, with over 2 million adherents. Negros Occidental falls under the jurisdictions of the Roman Catholic Dioceses of Bacolod, San Carlos &amp; Kabankalan. Other major Christian denominations include Baptist churches, Aglipayan Church, Iglesia ni Cristo has 3 districts supervision has 3-4% adherents , Seventh-day Adventist Church, and Evangelicalism. Islam is practised by a minority, with 1,842 claiming it as their religion.

==Economy==

Known as the &quot;Sugarbowl of the Philippines&quot;, the sugar industry is the lifeblood of the economy of Negros Occidental, producing more than half of the country&#x27;s sugar. There are 15 sugar centrals located throughout the lowland areas the north and west of the island, stretching from northwest along the coasts of the Visayan Sea and Guimaras Strait. Among the larger mills are in San Carlos, La Carlota, Bago, Binalbagan, Kabankalan, Sagay, Silay, Murcia and Victorias. Victorias Mill in Victorias City is the largest sugar mill in the country, and the world&#x27;s largest integrated sugar mill and refinery. Sugar is transported from plantations to refineries by large trucks that use the national highway.

A fishing industry is found in Cadiz, and other fishponds that dot the province. One of the country&#x27;s largest copper mines is located in Sipalay City. There also exists a cottage industry which produced handicrafts made from indigenous materials.

The province is rich in mineral deposits. Minerals that abound in the province are primary copper with estimated reserve of 591 million metric tons and gold ore with estimated reserve of 25 million tons. Silver and molybdenum deposits are also abundant, as well as non-metallic minerals suitable for agricultural and industrial uses. Notwithstanding its great potential, the mining industry in Negros Occidental has remained virtually dormant since the biggest copper mine in Sipalay suspended its operation in 2000.

Bacolod is the center of commerce and finance in Negros Occidental. It has oil companies, factories, bottling plants, allied industrial businesses, steel fabrication, power generation, agri-businesses, prawn culture and other aqua-culture ventures.
It is also the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) hub of the Negros Island Region of the Philippines. Bacolod has an estimated 35,000 workforce in the IT-BPO industry working in 20 major companies. Among the notable BPO companies operating in the city are Convergys, Teleperformance, TTEC, Focus Direct International, Inc. – Bacolod, Panasiatic Solutions, Ubiquity Global Services, Transcom Asia and iQor. As of 2019, Negros Occidental has a total of 13 operating PEZA-registered IT Parks and Centers.

In 2012, a two-hectare portion of the four-hectare Paglaum Sports Complex was partitioned for the construction of the provincial government-owned Negros First CyberCentre (NFCC) as an IT-BPO Outsourcing Hub with a budget of P674-million. It is located at Lacson corner Hernaez Streets in Bacolod and offers up to 22,000 square meters of mixed IT-BPO and commercial spaces. Its facilities are divided into three sections — Information Technology, Commercial Support Facilities, and Common IT Facilities. It was inaugurated in April 2015 in rites led by President Benigno S. Aquino III. The area was initially a residential zone and has been reclassified as a commercial zone as approved by the Comprehensive Zoning Ordinance.

By 2014, Negros Occidental is the province with the highest income in all of the Philippines, earning an average of P3.332 billion.

===Food and agriculture===

Negros Occidental&#x27;s output of more than 1 million metric tons for crop year 2002–2003 accounts for nearly half of the country&#x27;s sugar production in an industry that generates an estimated annual revenue of more than . There are 12 sugar mills in the province, of which only 10 are presently operational. Victorias Milling Company has the highest rated capacity with 15,000 tonnes cane per day.
However, the volatility of the sugar industry forced the province to shift, albeit slowly, to other high-value crops and alternative industries. The diversification has proven to be highly successful. Production of rice, the basic commodity for food security, has been increasing. By 2003, annual output of 437 thousand metric tons of palay was 33% better than two years ago. This allowed the province to significantly raise its sufficiency level from 65% to more than 84%. The improvement could be attributed to the introduction and promotion of hybrid rice, which increased rice yields to 3.8 metric tons per hectare. Because of the success of the program, area planted to hybrid rice has increased nearly fivefold. The highest hybrid yield was recorded at 10.3 tons per hectare.

Corn also registered increasing gains. Production for 2003 of 42 thousand metric tons outperformed 2001 output by 18%. Average yield per hectare has also grown by 18%. Other fruit and vegetable crops, except for banana and cassava, likewise improved their harvest. Harvested coconut was placed at 139 million nuts, while production of banana; fruit and vegetable crops totaled 110 million kilograms. Livestock and poultry are industries where Negros Occidental has strongly diversified.

With the province successfully quarantined from the foot and mouth disease and bird flu, as well as with other endemic diseases under control, total production of livestock and poultry in 2003 of 49 thousand metric tons exceeded estimated local demand by 18%. Fishing is likewise an industry where the province has remained focused. After all, 9 of its cities and 16 of its municipalities are located along the coastline and a great portion of the population depends on fishing for their livelihood.

The area for exploitation by this industry is huge, covering most of the coastal areas and the rich fishing grounds of the Visayan Sea on the north, Sulu Sea on the south, Tañon Strait on the east and Guimaras Strait and Panay Gulf at the west. These rich coastal areas and fishing grounds continue to be generous to the people of Negros Occidental. In 2003, products from deep-sea fishing, municipal marine and inland waters, and aquaculture reached 87 thousand metric tons, 30% better than 2001 production.

==Government==

Negros Occidental is headed by a governor and vice governor, which has its offices at the Negros Occidental Provincial Capitol. Both positions are elected by a popular vote to serve for a three-year term. Since the province is an administrative division of the country, it is still subject to the laws and policies of the republic, such as those under the Constitution, Republic Acts, and Executive Orders. Members of the Sangguniang Panlungsod and Sangguniang Bayan of the 13 cities and 19 municipalities, respectively, are also elected by a popular vote, serving for a three-year term as well. Cities and municipalities are further subdivided into barangays, each headed by a barangay captain, who also oversees the administrative services of the government. Bacolod, as a highly urbanized city, is not under the jurisdiction of the provincial government and does not participate in the election of provincial officials, even though it hosts most of the province&#x27;s government agencies. 

Under the House of Representatives, Negros Occidental is represented by six congressional districts. The city of Bacolod, being a highly urbanized city, has its own representation through a separate congressional district. Each of these districts elects its own representative, who is meant to represent certain groups of municipalities and cities. Officials in these positions are elected, by popular vote, to serve for a three-year term as well. In cases where the representatives resign from their position, the position remains vacant until a caretaker is assigned to take over the affected district. 

Historically, Negros Occidental has been grouped under Western Visayas for the allocation of regional services as well as for statistical purposes. However, with the reinstatement of Negros Island Region in June of 2024, the province is slowly being augmented to the aforementioned new region, with regional operations fully expected by 2025. Fourteen executive departments’ regional offices are planned to be established in Bacolod.

==Festivals and culture==
===Festivals===
====Panaad sa Negros Festival====
The Panaad sa Negros Festival, also called simply as the Panaad Festival (sometimes spelled as Pana-ad), is a festival held annually during the month of April in Bacolod, the capital of Negros Occidental province in the Philippines. Panaad is the Hiligaynon word for &quot;vow&quot; or &quot;promise&quot;; the festival is a form of thanksgiving to Divine Providence and commemoration of a vow in exchange for a good life. The celebration is held at the Panaad Park, which also houses the Panaad Stadium, and is participated in by the 13 cities and 19 towns of the province. For this reason, the province dubs it the &quot;mother&quot; of all its festivals.

The first Panaad sa Negros Festival was held at Capitol Park and Lagoon in a three-day affair in 1993 that started April 30. The festival was held at the lagoon fronting the Provincial Capitol for the first four years. As the festival grew each year, it became necessary to locate a more spacious venue. In 1997, the festival was held at the reclaimed area near where the Bredco Port is located today. The construction of the Panaad Stadium and sports complex paved the way for the establishment of the Panaad Park as the permanent home of the festival.

It has 30 heritage houses declared by the national historical institute, most notable of which is Balay Negrense; it is also the hometown of National Artist of the Philippines for Architecture Leandro Locsin and international mezzo-soprano Conchita Gaston.

This blossoming in art was due to the economical importance of the area during the Spanish era, Negros became probably the most hispanized and pro-Spanish area, due to the enormous investments of Spain in the sugar business.

Another famous treasure of Negrense art heritage can be found in Victorias City, within the confines of the Victorias Milling Company in its chapel is the world-famous mural of the Angry Christ, painted by artist Alfonso Ossorio, a scion of the Ossorio family who owned the mill.

Left unused by the family, the structure was abandoned in the mid-1970s and fell into disrepair until a group of concerned Negrenses formed what would later become the Negros Cultural Foundation and managed to acquire the house from the heirs of Gaston through a donation. With donations from prominent individuals and later the Department of Tourism, the structure was repaired and furnished with period furniture and fixtures. The museum was officially inaugurated on October 6, 1990.

===Mariano Ramos Ancestral House===

The Mariano Ramos Ancestral House is the home of the late Don Mariano V. Ramos, the son of Agaton Ramos and Dolores Varela, was the first appointed Presidente Municipal of Bacolod, Philippines. It was built in the 1930s and its architecture is a combination of Castilian and Tuscan and has three storeys, including the tower room, known as the torre.

During World War II, Don Mariano&#x27;s Ancestral house was the most prominent structure with a view over the whole city. The commanding Japanese general was disguised as a family gardener. As the war broke, the Japanese seized the Mariano Ramos Ancestral house in order to use it as a watchtower and as a headquarters.

===San Diego Pro-cathedral===

The San Diego Pro-cathedral, formerly known as the San Diego Parish Church or the St. Didacus Parish Church before its declaration as a pro-cathedral in 1994, is an early 20th-century church in Silay City, Negros Occidental in the Philippines. It is the only pro-cathedral outside of the national capital of Manila, and is unique in Negros Occidental for being the only church in the province featuring a cupola or dome.

===The Ruins===
The mansion dates back to the 1900s when it was built by sugar baron Don Mariano Ledesma Lacson for his first wife, Maria Braga, a Portuguese from Macau whom he met in his vacations in Hong Kong. The mansion&#x27;s structure is of Italianate architecture enhanced by a belvedere complete with renaissance-type balustrading typical of the homes of English ship captains. It was burned down in World War II to prevent the Japanese from using it. It was opened to the public by descendants of the original owner and is listed as among the World&#x27;s 12 most fascinating ruins.
===Paglaum Sports Complex===

The Paglaum Sports Complex is a provincial-owned sports venue adjacent to the Negros Occidental High School established during the 1970s that hosted various football events, such as the 1991 Philippines International Cup and the football event of the 2005 Southeast Asian Games. It also hosted three editions of the Palarong Pambansa (1971, 1974, 1979). However, the stadium became unfit to host football matches following the erection of business establishments around the area. In 2012, a two-hectare portion of the four-hectare complex was partitioned for the construction of the Capitol-owned Negros First CyberCentre (NFCC) as an IT-BPO Outsourcing Hub. As of 2013, the provincial government has been proposing for a renovation of the stadium to serve as alternative venue to Panaad Park and Sports Complex, particularly for football competition. Recently, the Paglaum Sports Complex also serves as an alternative venue to the Bacolod Public Plaza for the MassKara Festival celebration.

===Negros Occidental Multi-Purpose Activity Center===
The Negros Occidental Multi-Purpose Activity Center (NOMPAC) is a provincial-owned multi-use gym located in Bacolod, adjacent to the Capitol Park and Lagoon. It is currently used mostly for basketball, karatedo and boxing matches. Aside from the gym, it also serves as evacuation site of the city and province during disasters and likewise also serves as cultural facilities in many events and celebrations.

===Negros Occidental Convention Center===
Eugenio Jose Lacson led the groundbreaking of the 2-story multipurpose PHP1.03 billion Negros Occidental Convention Center in Silay. It was Mayor Albee Benitez who initiated the project near the Bacolod-Silay Airport. His brother 3rd District Rep. Jose Francisco Benitez certified the center as green building for conferences, cultural events, and social gatherings.

<doc id="266816" wikidata="Q1505272" url="?curid=266816" title="Vashon, Washington">
<text>Vashon () is a census-designated place (CDP) in King County, Washington, United States. It covers an island alternately called Vashon Island or Vashon–Maury Island, the largest island in Puget Sound south of Admiralty Inlet. Before the construction of a tombolo built in 1913, Vashon Island and Maury Island were connected only during low tide; now they are considered a tied island.

The population was 11,055 at 2020, up from 10,624 at the 2010 census and the size is .

The island is connected to West Seattle and the Kitsap Peninsula to the north and Tacoma to the south via the Washington State Ferries system, as well as to Downtown Seattle via the King County Water Taxi. The island has resisted the construction of a fixed bridge to preserve its relative isolation and rural character. Vashon Island is also known for its annual strawberry festival, sheepdog trials, and agriculture.

==History==
Vashon Island sits in the midpoint of southern Puget Sound, between Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. In the nearby Pacific Ocean, roughly west of Vashon Island, lies the tectonic boundary known as the Cascadia Subduction Zone, and as such, Vashon Island is one of many areas at risk for earthquakes or related natural disasters. The Cascadia Subduction Zone last saw a major rupture in 1700, but the potential of the zone could cause one of the worst natural disasters in the history of North America.

=== Native American inhabitants ===
Up until the late 1700s, Vashon and Maury Islands were inhabited solely by American Indians, and there is evidence of human activity on Vashon Island dating back 10,000 to 12,000 years. Historical data from the era when the first Native Americans settled Vashon–Maury Island is limited. Some of the Native peoples known to have lived on Vashon Island were the Marpole culture from about 7,000 years ago, the Salish about 1,000 years ago, and the Sqababsh (known in Chinook Wawa as the S&#x27;Homamish) starting about 500 years ago, the latter of which established 5 known major village sites. The Tulalip Indians is another tribe that populated the villages along the shores of both islands. Fishing was abundant in the cold saltwater of the central Puget Sound basin, helping Native American tribes to thrive. Moreover, the many waterways and inlets provided easy travel by way of canoe.

===Euramerican settlement===
The first non–Native American to explore and the first to chart this island was Captain George Vancouver, during his surveys of the Puget Sound area with the British Royal Navy. The island was named on May 28, 1792, by Vancouver after his friend James Vashon of the Royal Navy. Starting in 1824, different explorer and settler groups stayed on Vashon Island.

Maury Island, immediately to the southeast of Vashon, was named in 1841 by then Lt. Charles Wilkes in honor of William Lewis Maury, an officer in the United States Exploring Expedition. Maury was naturally separated from Vashon by a narrow passage, until local landowners decided to build an earth bridge, or isthmus, linking them together in 1916, thus creating the hamlet of Portage. Therefore, the two-piece isle was renamed Vashon-Maury Island. Between the two sections, it covers nearly .

The first logging on the island began in 1852. By 1855–1856, the S&#x27;Homamish people were interned at Fox Island. European-Americans settled Vashon Island between 1865 and 1890. During that time the main economies on the island were fishing and logging.

In 1890, Japanese Americans started growing strawberries for sale. Denichiro Mukai came to the island in 1910 and became renowned for barreling fresh strawberries using a special method that concentrated flavor and moisture in the fruit and permitted long-distance shipping. In time, Mukai designed and built his own home and elaborate garden and then constructed a sturdy timber framed barreling plant. During the peak years, ice cream, jam and preserve makers across the West were customers of Mukai, relishing the oak barrels for their lingering flavor and mythologizing about the island of strawberry fields. This became an important part of the island economy during the next 50 years, until the Japanese American population was forcibly relocated into internment camps as a response to Japanese/American tension caused by WWII.

In 1892, Vashon College opened in the Burton section of Vashon. During its operation, it was one of the leading colleges in the area. It burned down in 1910.

== Geography ==

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Vashon CDP has a total area of , of which comprise the island and are the waters of Puget Sound surrounding the island.

To the west Vashon Island is separated from the Kitsap Peninsula by the Colvos Passage. The Dalco Passage separates Vashon Island from Tacoma to the south. Neighborhoods of Vashon Island include Magnolia Beach, which had a post office from 1908 to 1953, and Raeco, with a post office from 1907 to 1911.

===Climate===
This region experiences warm (but not hot) and dry summers, with no average monthly temperatures above . According to the Köppen Climate Classification system, Vashon has a warm-summer Mediterranean climate, abbreviated &quot;Csb&quot; on climate maps.

== Demographics ==

As of the census of 2000, there were 10,123 people, 4,193 households, and 2,838 families residing in the CDP. The population density was . There were 4,867 housing units at an average density of . The racial makeup of the CDP was 93.61% White, 0.45% Black or African American, 0.70% Native American, 1.56% Asian, 0.06% Pacific Islander, 0.87% from other races, and 2.75% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.56% of the population.

There were 4,193 households, out of which 30.9% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 56.2% were married couples living together, 7.9% had a female householder with no husband present, and 32.3% were non-families. 23.8% of all households were made up of individuals, and 8.0% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.40 and the average family size was 2.86.

In the CDP, the population was spread out, with 23.2% under the age of 18, 4.6% from 18 to 24, 25.1% from 25 to 44, 34.0% from 45 to 64, and 13.1% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 44 years. For every 100 females, there were 94.5 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 91.0 males.

The median income for a household in the CDP was $58,261, and the median income for a family was $67,010. Males had a median income of $50,201 versus $36,426 for females. The per capita income for the island was $31,983. About 4.6% of families and 6.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 5.2% of those under the age of 18 and 2.2% of those 65 and older.

Based on per capita income, Vashon ranks 32nd of 522 areas in the state of Washington to be ranked.

== Government ==
In 1994 the Vashon Island Committee for Self-Government circulated a petition calling for the incorporation of Vashon and Maury Islands. At the time only some 448 residents of about 10,000 signed the petition which was then filed with the King County Auditor.

The Vashon-Maury Island Community Council was a body whose purpose was to advise the King County Council on matters relating to Vashon Island and Maury Island. In 2013, it collapsed due to a requirement that it comply with the state&#x27;s public records act and threats of lawsuits undermined the function of the organization. However, with the adoption of formal bylaws on June 15, 2020, a new Vashon-Maury Island Community Council was officially created by island residents. The new group was formed as a non-profit to help island residents address important issues facing their community.

== Public safety ==
Vashon Fire is led by Matt Vinci and is a combination professional-volunteer department. There is one staffed station, Station 55, which houses a minimum staffing of three firefighter/EMTs and two King County paramedics. Station 55 contains four aid units, one engine, one quint, one brush truck, two water tenders, one boat, one ATV, and one support unit. Vashon Fire uses ValleyCom as its dispatch center. There are two outlying stations that contain water tenders and backup engines: Station 56 located in Burton and Station 58 located in Dockton. The department is primarily funded by a property tax levy which last had a voter approved lid lift in 2017.

The island has an established emergency operations center manager who runs emergency drills with members of the community emergency response team (CERT) in order to provide the best response in times of emergencies such as earthquakes. The drills were established as routine through the group VashonBePrepared, a nonprofit, FEMA-sanctioned coalition of disaster preparedness organizations that were previously established on the island. Sometimes the drills have members of the Washington Army National Guard participating and supporting the volunteers.

=== Crime ===
There are some claims that the island is home to various drug houses, a claim which has caused the Vashon Youth &amp; Family Services to offer substance abuse counseling as part of the regular assembly of social services.

Homicide rates on the island are extremely low, with only two homicides reported in the last twenty years and other forms of crime are also largely not seen. In 2005 the Sheriff&#x27;s Office investigated one rape, six assaults, and forty-nine burglaries, in 2006 they investigated three rapes, eight assaults, and sixty-three burglaries.

Major crimes on the Island include a serial rapist who operated from 2003 through 2010 until he was arrested and charged due to DNA evidence, and a police officer who pleaded guilty to incest and other sex crimes involving his underage stepdaughter.

== Economy ==
=== Agriculture ===
While orchards and strawberry farms formerly played a major role in the Vashon economy, the pressures of suburban residential development have all but eliminated any major commercial agriculture on the island. However, many small farms operate on the island, providing locals with fresh organic produce, milk, and eggs.

Despite the changes, the island continues to observe the tradition of holding a Strawberry Festival every July. In certain areas like Dockton, a significant amount of private property was occupied and subsequently seized from Japanese-American citizens who farmed strawberries on that land until World War II, when they were moved to internment camps away from the island.

Local orchards and wineries are established on the island, with some focusing on developing perry, an alcoholic beverage derived from pear juice instead of grapes. There are at least three wineries that produce 100% locally produced wines and other alcoholic-based beverages.

=== Manufacturing and industry ===
Vashon has lost two of its major industrial employers: K2 Sports moved its manufacturing to China, and the Seattle&#x27;s Best Coffee roastery operation was closed shortly after SBC was bought by Starbucks. Currently, the largest manufacturer on Vashon is Pacific Research Laboratories, locally referred to as &quot;The Bone Factory&quot;.

In 2014 it was reported that the company Edipure was to purchase the old K2 ski plant to manufacture more than 60 marijuana-based snacks including crackers, candy and gummy bears.

==Infrastructure==
=== Transportation ===
There are no bridges to Vashon Island, so all access to the island is by sea or by air. Most travel on and off the island is on the Washington State Ferry system. A bridge connecting Vashon to Seattle and Kitsap County was planned in 1959, but was ultimately not funded. A second bridge proposal from the Washington State Transportation Commission was withdrawn in 1992 after objections from island residents.

Vashon Municipal Airport is on the northern half of the island. There is no regularly scheduled air service to the airport.

King County Metro provides bus service down the length of the island daily. Two routes (route 118 and 119) start at the Vashon Ferry Terminal in the north; at Valley Center mid-way down the island, the routes split with route 118 serving the southern part of Vashon Island while route 199 serving Maury Island. On September 10, 2016, on-island Sunday service returned to route 118. 

==== Ferries ====
The southern terminus of the Vashon Highway is the Tahlequah Ferry Terminal in the Tahlequah neighborhood, connected to the Point Defiance neighborhood of Tacoma by the Point Defiance–Tahlequah ferry. The northern terminus of the Vashon Highway is the Heights Dock at Point Vashon, serving the state ferry docks at Southworth, and Fauntleroy in West Seattle. Passenger-only service from Heights Dock to Colman Dock in Downtown Seattle is provided by the King County Ferry District, with sailings throughout the day on weekdays.

As of July 1, 2024, the King County Water Taxi increased their service to the island from downtown Seattle. They now have an additional four trips in between their morning and afternoon/evening service. These extra trips are Monday through Friday and sponsored by Washington State.

The island previously had ferries that were run by private companies, including the Puget Sound Navigation Company (also known as the Black Ball Line). After a six-day strike by workers in February 1947 left Vashon Island without service, a group of residents acquired three passenger ferries and operated them on their own the following year under the King County Ferry District. The Black Ball Line planned to restart service on May 15, 1948, but were blocked by a mob of Vashon Island residents who rushed the when it attempted to dock. The ferry district remained without private competition until it was dissolved in 1951 and replaced by Washington State Ferries.

=== Health care ===
In 2016 it was reported that the medical clinic on the island had closed after CHI Franciscan Health had left the clinic, claiming financial concerns. Another provider, the non-profit NeighborCare Health, pledged to open a new clinic later in the year, alleviating the issue of transporting patients to hospitals off the island via the ferry, which can take upwards of three hours. NeighborCare&#x27; lease on the island&#x27;s clinic expired in 2020, and the clinic was operated by Sea Mar.

During the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic, Vashon faced a shortage of tests, medical resources, and protective equipment. A team of local doctors created their own response plan, dubbed the &quot;Rural Test &amp; Trace Toolkit&quot;, with the hopes of creating a model for other isolated communities.

==== Vaccination concerns ====
Many of those who live on the island choose not to vaccinate their children due to vaccine hesitancy. It was reported in 2015 that 23.1% of kindergartners in the Vashon Island School District legally opted out of vaccinations against diphtheria and tetanus, whooping cough, measles, mumps, rubella, polio, varicella, and hepatitis B. The number, at the time, was five times the state average. Of those who do not vaccinate, more than 98% cite &quot;Personal&quot; rather than &quot;Religious&quot; or &quot;Medical&quot; as exemptions. Their failure to vaccinate has caused resentment in the community.

Due to expanded access to vaccines, media coverage of the measles outbreaks, and education about the benefits of vaccination, the vaccine rate for the Vashon Island School District has risen over the years, even though it is still one of the lowest in the United States. The district&#x27;s rates of fully immunized students rose 31% over six years, from 56% to 74% as of the 2017–2018 school year; although still below the 95% target rate for the rest of the country. In 2019, it was reported that some 11.6% of families on the island had failed to vaccinate their children.

==Education==
&quot;Public schools:&quot;
There are three public schools provided by the Vashon Island School District
* Chautauqua Elementary School
* McMurray Middle School
* Vashon Island High School

&quot;Private schools:&quot;
There are two private schools in Vashon.
* The Harbor School (grades 4 to 8). 65 students were enrolled as of September 2013.
* Carpe Diem Primary School (Kindergarten to 3rd grade). 26 students were enrolled as of September 2013.

== Arts and culture ==
The annual studio tour was created in the late 1970s by some of the potters who lived on the island. The group was rebranded in February 2018 as the Vashon Island Visual Artists, and they applied for non-profit status in 2015. The group now operates semi-annual tours of studios of local artists, classes, workshops, salons, exhibits, and social activities for artists, with membership around 300. The island is home to a choral group established in 1989 under the name Island Singers, and now known as the Vashon Island Chorale.

On the first Friday of every month, there is a gallery walk where the art galleries in town open for visitors. The Vashon Center for the Arts along with cafés are also open during the First Friday gallery walk which have shown the work of local artists including Ann Leda Shapiro.

== Media ==

=== Broadcast radio stations ===

In 2014, a small media outlet, the Voice of Vashon, acquired a low-power FM radio broadcast license from the FCC. KVSH-FM went live on 101.9 FM in October 2014, and is also still available for live streaming. The Voice of Vashon started filing as a non-profit starting from the 2015 tax year. The Voice of Vashon records and broadcasts community arts events with support from King County 4Culture grants. The Voice of Vashon board includes director and producer Rick Wallace. The Voice of Vashon also operates a television station, Comcast Channel 21, and its emergency broadcast system at 1650AM. Each of these outlets serves Vashon and Maury Islands year round, 24 hours/day, 7 days/week, with island-generated or specific information, entertainment and emergency alerts.

Maury Island is home to numerous AM transmitters. KIRO 710 (built in 1941) has two massive towers for its 50,000-watt day/night transmitter. KTTH 770, which transmits 50,000 watts during the day and 5,000 watts at night, shares towers with KPTR. KIRO and KTTH are owned by Bonneville International.

There was a tower originally built in 1946 for KEVR 1090AM, which later became KING radio, and is now KPTR, owned by iHeartMedia. It transmits 50,000 watts day/night and operates three towers. This site is shared with KTTH.

On Vashon Island, radio station KVI 570 has a single tower on a beach in Tramp Harbor, nicknamed &quot;KVI Beach&quot;. KVI transmits 24 hours a day at 5,000 watts. KNWN 1000 transmits 50,000 watts day/night and has a three-tower setup on the northeast corner of the island. Both KVI and KNWN are owned by Lotus Communications.

KGNW AM 820 propagates its signal from three towers in the center of the island. It operates 50,000 watts during the day and 5,000 at night. It is owned by Salem Media Group. KJR 950 shares the towers at the KGNW site, transmits 50,000 watts day/night, and is owned by iHeartMedia.

These stations have located their transmitters on Vashon and Maury Islands because local soil conductivity, important for signal propagation in the megawatt broadcast frequency range, is greater than elsewhere in the Puget Sound area. The surrounding sea water is also helpful for radio propagation.

== Sports and recreation ==
The island is home to the Vashon Island Rowing Club who participates in many events such as the Opening Day celebrations on Seattle&#x27;s Montlake Cut. The island is also home to the Vashon Island Golf &amp; Country Club.

The Vashon Sheepdog Classic occurs each year at the Misty Isle Farms, with local food and merchandise vendors, with all profits going to area nonprofits. The trials are completed by a team composed of a dog and its handler who are released into a shedding ring and work to herd the sheep into specific areas.

== Points of interest ==

===Historic landmarks===
Vashon Island has a number of buildings and sites that are listed on the King County Historic Register:

===Other points of interest===

* The bike in the tree. A bicycle placed in the fork of a tree, allegedly when a child chained a bike to the tree decades ago and never picked it up, and the tree subsequently grew around it. This is a common local and tourist attraction, and has been subject to vandalism in recent years. The bike in the tree served as the inspiration for the Christmas book &quot;Red Ranger Came Calling&quot; by Berkeley Breathed.
* Point Robinson Lighthouse. Point Robinson Beach on the east shore of Maury Island has been the site of a lighthouse since 1885. The current Point Robinson lighthouse has been fully automated since 1978.
* Fisher Pond, a 90-acre terrestrial and freshwater conservancy, the largest on Vashon Island
* Jesus Barn Farm, a farmstead founded in 1893. During the 1960s it was turned into an agrarian lifestyle commune. Local lore suggests this is when the iconic &quot;Jesus&quot; was first painted on the side of the barn.

<text>Guimaras (), officially the Province of Guimaras (; ), is an island province in the Philippines located in the Western Visayas region. The capital is Jordan, while the largest local government unit is the municipality of Buenavista. The province is situated in Panay Gulf, between the islands of Panay and Negros. To the northwest is the city and province of Iloilo and to the southeast is Negros Occidental. The whole island is part of the Metro Iloilo&quot;–&quot;Guimaras, one of the twelve metropolitan areas of the Philippines.

The province consists primarily of Guimaras Island, and also includes Inampulugan, Guiwanon (or Guiuanon), Panobolon, Natunga, Nadulao, and many surrounding islets.

Guimaras, formerly known as &quot;Himal-os&quot;, was a sub-province of Iloilo until it was made an independent province on May 22, 1992.

==History==

===Spanish colonial era===
About 1581, Gonzalo Ronquillo de Peñalosa, Spanish governor and Captain-General of the Philippine Islands, established a settlement in Guimaras for the purpose of Christianizing the island&#x27;s natives. He and his subordinates organized the &quot;pueblicitos&quot; or villages of Nayup under the patronage of Saint Peter the Apostle, and Igang with Saint Anne as patroness.

Evangelization of Guimaras occurred around the same time the friars were making inroads in Panay. The Augustinians established the &quot;visitas&quot; (chapelries) of Nayup and Igang as subordinate to Oton, Iloilo. Gómez Pérez Dasmariñas, the 7th Spanish Governor-General, noted in a June 20, 1591, report to King Philip II that the friars of Oton made regular visits to the island.

In 1742, the island came under the jurisdiction of Dumangas – now known as Iloilo, until 1751 when the Augustinian Order was replaced by the Jesuits, after which the Dominican order took over Guimaras. The Jesuits, who had established a school in Iloilo and had missions in Molo and Arevalo, took charge of the island. By 1755, it was organized into a regular parish. When the population increased considerably, the island was given its municipal status with a seat of government at Tilad (today Buenavista).

===American colonial era===
Under American rule, the Guimarasnons were given the opportunity to elect their municipal president in 1908.

Douglas MacArthur, a fresh graduate from West Point as a Second Lieutenant at the age of 23, came to Iloilo as the head of the company of U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. They constructed roads and the Santo Rosario Wharf, presently named MacArthur&#x27;s Wharf, which are still in use today. In November 1903, while working on Guimaras, he was ambushed by a pair of Filipino brigands or guerrillas; he shot and killed both with his pistol.

===Japanese occupation===
In 1942, Japanese Imperial forces landed on Guimaras Island as the Empire of Japan began its occupation of the country during the Second World War. The Japanese controlled almost every island between the Philippines and Hawaii. The U.S. Forces needed these islands to run aircraft to and from the Philippines, while denying Japan usage. The U.S. Army and Navy planned indirect attacks that would eventually lead them to Luzon.

In 1945, 10 U.S. divisions and 5 independent regiments would battle for Luzon, making it the largest campaign of the war and involving more troops than the United States had used in North Africa, Italy or southern France. The combined United States and Philippine Commonwealth forces landed on Guimaras Island, attacking the Japanese and defeating them in the Battle of Guimaras, which led to the liberation of the island.

===Philippine independence===
====Provincial status====
Guimaras gained its status as a sub-province of Iloilo through &quot;Republic Act 4667&quot;, which was enacted by Congress on June 18, 1966. It was proclaimed as a regular and full-fledged province on May 22, 1992, after a plebiscite was conducted to ratify the approval of its conversion pursuant to Section 462 of &quot;R.A. 7160&quot;.

Shortly after Guimaras acquired its provincial status, President Fidel V. Ramos appointed Emily Relucio-López as its first Governor.

The province of Guimaras was originally composed of three municipalities: Buenavista, Jordan, and Nueva Valencia. In 1995, through &quot;Republic Act No. 7896&quot; and &quot;Republic Act No. 7897&quot;, the municipalities of Sibunag and San Lorenzo were created. The two new municipalities officially acquired their municipal status after the May 8, 1995, plebiscite held simultaneously with the local election.

Ernesto L. Gedalanga was the first appointed mayor of Sibunag and Arsenio Zambarrano was also appointed mayor of San Lorenzo. The temporary seat of government of the Municipality of Sibunag is at Barangay Dasal while the temporary seat of Government of the Municipality of San Lorenzo is at Barangay Cabano.

===Contemporary===
====Guimaras oil spill====
In August 2006, the Guimaras oil spill occurred. The 998-ton MT &quot;Solar 1&quot;, chartered by Petron (the Philippines&#x27; largest oil refiner), carrying 2.4 million litres of bunker fuel, sank off the island&#x27;s southern coast, contaminating . The Philippine Coast Guard called this the worst oil spill in the country&#x27;s history. According to officials, of mangroves were affected, including parts of the Taklong Island National Marine Reserve.

==Geography==
Guimaras comprises primarily of Guimaras Island, and numerous minor islets, prominent among which are Inampulugan, Guiwanon (or &quot;Guiuanon&quot;), Panobolon, Natunga and Nadulao. The province covers a total area of occupying the southeastern section of the Western Visayas region.

Sibunag River is the longest river in Guimaras with a total length of in municipality of Sibunag, followed by Cabano River long in San Lorenzo, Mantangingi River 17.4 km in Buenavista.

Mount Bontoc is the highest point in the province of Guimaras with an elevation of above sea level, located in municipality of Sibunag. Mount Dinulman is the second highest mountain with an elevation of also located in Sibunag.

The province has 5 municipalities. There is only one legislative district of Guimaras which encompasses all five towns.


==Demographics==

The population of Guimaras in the 2020 census was 187,842 people, with a density of .

===Language===
The people of the province, called &quot;Guimarasnon&quot;, speak Hiligaynon as the primary language, as it was once a sub-province of Iloilo. Filipino and English are widely spoken and understood.
===Religion===
====Catholicism====
The two predominant religions in the municipality are the Roman Catholic Church and the &quot;Iglesia Filipina Independiente&quot; (Philippine Independent Church). The St. Paul&#x27;s Theological Seminary (SPTS) in Jordan is the regional seminary of the Philippine Independent Church serving its Visayas and Mindanao dioceses.

==Economy==
The sectors having the most potential to support Guimaras&#x27; economic development are mangoes, tourism, cashew cultivation, and food processing. Another expanding sector is fishery, which includes growing seaweed. Infrastructure, capacity-building initiatives, more favorable legislation, and higher investments are just a few examples of local variables that have boosted the potential growth of these industries.

Guimaras is well known for its agricultural crops, particularly the mangoes, half of all exported mangoes come from this island. The island province is famous for producing one of the sweetest mangoes in the world, thus earning the nickname &quot;Mango Capital of the Philippines&quot; from local and foreign tourists. Guimaras mangoes are reportedly served at the White House and Buckingham Palace. Guimaras&#x27; largest event of the year is the &quot;Manggahan Festival&quot; (the Mango Festival). The variety of mangoes produced are also best for making dried mangoes, jam and other special delicacies. They also produce other fruits and vegetables such as bananas, tomatoes, and eggplants among others.

==Transportation==

Steel or Fiberglass Ferry boats ply regularly from Iloilo-Guimaras Ferry Terminal in Iloilo City Proper to Jordan, Guimaras and Buenavista, Guimaras, taking about 15 to 20 minutes per journey. RORO or roll-on/roll-off vessels sail from Lapuz, Iloilo City to Jordan Port in Jordan, Guimaras, every 30 minutes to one hour starting at 4:30AM to 6:30PM, taking about 30mins per way.

There is also a Ferry plying from Sibunag Port to Pulupandan in Negros Occidental.

==Government==
The Governor of Guimaras is Joaquin Carlos Rahman A. Nava, a member of the National Unity Party. The province&#x27;s Vice Governor is John Edward G. Gando, a member of PDP–Laban. Guimaras is represented in the Philippine House of Representatives by Lucille Nava, also a member of PDP–Laban.

==Tourism==

Guimaras attracts tourists particularly in May, when the Manggahan Festival takes place. In the festival, locals wear mango-inspired costumes and design mango-themed floats in a parade that makes its way around the island. Pastries and confectionery with mango ingredients, as well unprepared mangoes, are also sold in relatively large quantities. Tourism also includes visits to agricultural areas across the island, such as the Oro Verde Mango Plantation.

The island is also a growing destination for ecotourism. Talkong Island, off Guimaras&#x27; south coast, is a area of natural beauty recognized by the Philippine government. Tourists frequently visit areas such as the Guisi, Alubihod, Tatlong Pulo, and Natago beaches. Ave Maria Island is another ecological destination near Jordan. Some tourists also choose to visit the San Lorenzo Wind Farm, a series of turbines located near the island&#x27;s eastern coast.

Guimaras is also a site for religious tourism. The Balaan Bukid Shrine hosts twelve markers of the Way of the Cross as individuals make an ascent towards a hilltop where the main shrine rests. Navalas Church, built between 1880 and 1885, bears one of the few remaining sites of Roman Catholic Spanish heritage on the island. The Trappist Monastery is located near the center of the island, providing a retreat center for visitors in addition to selling various mango-based foodstuffs to help support the monks of the monastery.

<doc id="266848" wikidata="Q311122" url="?curid=266848" title="Castilleja">
<text>Castilleja, commonly known as paintbrush, Indian paintbrush, or prairie-fire, is a genus of about 200 species of annual and perennial mostly herbaceous plants native to the west of the Americas from Alaska south to the Andes, northern Asia, and one species as far west as the Kola Peninsula in northwestern Russia. These plants are classified in the broomrape family Orobanchaceae (following major rearrangements of the order Lamiales starting around 2001; sources which do not follow these reclassifications may place them in the Scrophulariaceae). They are hemiparasitic on the roots of grasses and forbs. The genus was named after Spanish botanist Domingo Castillejo.

==Taxonomy==
&quot;Castilleja&quot; was scientifically described by Carl Linnaeus the Younger using a partial description by José Celestino Bruno Mutis in 1782. The type species was &quot;Castilleja fissifolia&quot; from Columbia. The genus as a whole has never been renamed, however five others were described and named that are considered to be synonyms of &quot;Castilleja&quot;. For example, in 1818 Thomas Nuttall described a genus that he named &quot;Euchroma&quot; meaning finely colored, moving the species now known as &quot;Castilleja coccinea&quot; out of &quot;Bartsia&quot; where it had been placed by Carl Linnaeus and also named another species as &quot;Euchroma grandiflora&quot;. However, Nutttall&#x27;s &quot;Euchroma grandiflora&quot; had already been named and correctly placed as &quot;Castilleja sessiliflora&quot; by Frederick Traugott Pursh in 1813.

===Species===
There are 216 species that are considered valid by Plants of the World Online. More than half, 119 species, are native to North America north of Mexico.

===Names===
The name &quot;Castilleja&quot; was chosen by Mutis as an honor for the Spanish naturalist Domingo Castillejo. Castillejo was a professor of medical materials and botany at the Cadiz Royal College of Surgery between 1770 and 1786. Mutis wrote in Latin, &quot;Ab Stemodia quantum ex characteríbus video, valde diversa haec singularissimeplanta, proculdubio numeranda ínter Didynamas. Castillejam dixi in merítissimum honorem D. Castillejo Botanici Gadensis.&quot;

==Description==
The species in &quot;Castilleja&quot; are quite varied in form and lifecycle. The genus includes many species that are completely herbaceous, lacking woody material in their above-ground parts. Though it also includes some slightly woody subshrubs and even a few woody shrubs. They may grow as annual plants, but most of the species are perennial. Their roots are equally diverse in structure ranging from taproots to fibrous root systems. Some species also have modified underground stems called rhizomes to spread short distances.

Stem lengths range from a minute 1 centimeter to as much as 2 meters. In almost all species the leaves are attached to the stems and alternating. The inflorescences are always at the ends of the stems, which may or may not branch. The inflorescence usually have bracts that are brightly colored for the whole length or towards their ends.

==Ecology==
&quot;Castilleja&quot; species are eaten by the larvae of some lepidopteran species, including &quot;Schinia cupes&quot; (which has been recorded on &quot;C. exserta&quot;) and &quot;Schinia pulchripennis&quot; (which feeds exclusively on &quot;C. exserta&quot;), and checkerspot butterflies, such as &quot;Euphydryas&quot; species. Pollinators aid these plants in reproduction, with insects visiting the flowers, as well as hummingbirds for some species.

&quot;Castilleja&quot; species can play an important role in plant community dynamics and multitrophic interactions. For example, &quot;Castilleja&quot; hemiparasitic reliance on other plant species may affect competition and dominance among other plant species in its community. Additionally, the foliage of some &quot;Castilleja species&quot; naturally contains defensive compounds that are sequestered in the tissues of larvae of specialist insect species that have developed a tolerance for these compounds and are able to consume the foliage. These sequestered compounds then confer chemical protection against predators to larvae.

==Hybridization==

Some species in the &quot;Castilleja&quot; genus are able to hybridize, especially when ploidy levels match, and hybrids may produce viable seed. This hybridization potential has been identified as a threat to the genetic integrity of certain endangered &quot;Castilleja&quot; species.

==Uses==
The author Gregory L. Tilford claims that the flowers of Indian paintbrush are edible. However, these plants have a tendency to absorb and concentrate selenium in their tissues from the soils in which they grow, and can be potentially very toxic if the roots or green parts of the plant are consumed. Highly alkaline soils increase the selenium levels in the plants. In addition &quot;Castilleja&quot; species will take up alkaloids from other plants when parasitizing them.

==Symbolism==
&quot;Castilleja linariifolia&quot; is the state flower of Wyoming.

<doc id="266849" wikidata="Q1799776" url="?curid=266849" title="Postage stamp reuse">
<text>Postage stamp reuse is the technique of fraudulently reusing postage stamps from sent mail to avoid paying the cost of postage.

==Reuse==
A postage stamp is a small piece of paper attached to mail that indicates that the postage (the cost of sending the mail) has been paid. Because stamps are sent on most mail, the stamp on a received item can be removed and placed on a different piece of mail to be sent, thus reusing the stamp without paying the proper postage.

In many countries, such as the United States, reuse of used stamps, whether cancelled or not, is illegal.

==Prevention==
===Mute cancellation (&quot;killer&quot;)===

After use, many stamps are marked with a cancellation by the postal system, which defaces the stamp and prevents its reuse. The cancellation usually includes a killer placed on the stamp that has black bars, cork impressions or other obstructive shapes to deface the stamp. Instead of using an entirely separate mark, some countries use their postmark, placed on the stamp, to cancel mail.
===Grilling===

In the United States, the experiment of grilling was tried in 1867, where tiny squares were embossed into the paper after the stamp was printed, the idea being that this would break up the paper fibers and let more ink be absorbed into the paper. Grilling was abandoned around 1871 due to the stamps being more likely to tear. Unusual types of grills are typically found on rare U.S. stamps.

===Design with water-soluble inks===

In the 1880s in Great Britain, the use of inks which were water-soluble, thus preventing successful washing, was used. Only lilac and green colors were available. This scheme was abandoned after a few years, and the few surviving unwashed stamps have become collectibles.

===Surface coating===
Later experiments involved surface coatings. Between 1901 and 1907 Austria applied varnish bars, thin diagonal strips of varnish, to the paper before printing the design. Russia did the same between 1909 and 1915, applying the varnish in a pattern of lozenges. In both cases the theory was the same; the ink of the printed design would not soak into the varnish, so that in the washing process the design would tend to flake off, forming a telltale pattern on the washed stamp. The United States also coated a few of their $1 revenue stamps with varnish around the turn of the 20th century.

===Perfin===

A perfin is a stamp that has had initials or a name perforated across it to discourage theft. By agreement with postal authorities, a perfin stamp on a letter could be used only by the owner of the perfin. Therefore, a stolen perforated stamp would be of no value to the unauthorized bearer.

===Varia===
More unusual methods have included tearing or slicing the stamp, but this is a slower process and can easily damage the contents, and was only occasionally used. An example is 19th century Afghanistan, where cancellation involved the removal of part of the stamp rather than applying ink or other surface marking.

<text>World Rugby is the governing body for the sport of rugby union. World Rugby organises the Rugby World Cup every four years, the sport&#x27;s most recognised and most profitable competition. It also organises a number of other international competitions, such as the World Rugby Sevens Series, the Rugby World Cup Sevens, the World Under 20 Championship, and the Pacific Nations Cup.

World Rugby&#x27;s headquarters are in Dublin, Ireland. Its membership now comprises 133 national unions. Each member country must also be a member of one of the six regional unions into which the world is divided: Africa, North America, Asia, Europe, South America, and Oceania.

World Rugby was founded as the International Rugby Football Board (IRFB) in 1886 by , and , with joining in 1890. , and became full members in 1949. became a member in 1978 and a further 80 members joined from 1987 to 1999. The body was renamed the International Rugby Board (IRB) in 1998, and took up its current name of World Rugby in November 2014. In 2009, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to include rugby sevens in the 2016 Summer Olympics. World Rugby gained membership of the Association of Summer Olympic International Federations (ASOIF) in 2010.

==History==

Until 1885 the laws of rugby football were made by England as the founder nation. However, following a disputed try in an international between Scotland and England in 1884, letters were exchanged in which England claimed that they made the laws, and the try should stand. Scotland refused to play England in the 1885 Home Nations Championship. Following the dispute, the home unions of Scotland, Ireland and Wales decided to form an international union whose membership would agree on the standard rules of rugby football. The three nations met in Dublin in 1886, though no formal regulations were agreed upon.

On 5 December 1887, committee members of the Irish Rugby Football Union, Scottish Rugby Union (named the Scottish Football Union at the time) and Welsh Rugby Union met in Manchester and wrote up the first four principles of the International Rugby Football Board. England refused to take part in the founding of the IRFB, stating that they should have greater representation, as they had more clubs. The England Union also refused to accept the IRFB as the recognised lawmaker of the game. This led to the IRFB taking the stance of member countries not playing England until they joined, and no games were played against England in 1888 and 1889. In 1890 England joined the IRFB, gaining six seats while the other unions had two each. The same year, the IRFB wrote the first international laws of rugby union.

In 1893, the IRFB was faced with the divide between amateurism and professionalism, which was nicknamed the &quot;Great Schism&quot;. Following the introduction of working-class men to the game in Northern England, clubs began paying &quot;broken time&quot; payments to players, due to the loss of earnings from playing on a Saturday. Cumberland County Union also complained of another club using monetary incentives to lure players, leading to the IRFB conducting an enquiry. The IRFB was warned by all the chief clubs in Lancashire and Yorkshire that any punishment would lead to the clubs seceding from the union. The debate over broken time payments ultimately caused the 22 leading clubs in Yorkshire and Lancashire to form the Northern Rugby Football Union. The competing unions&#x27; laws of the game diverged almost immediately; the northern body&#x27;s code eventually became known as rugby league football.

England&#x27;s seats on the IRFB were reduced from six to four in 1911. The Australian Rugby Union, New Zealand Rugby Football Union and South African Rugby Board joined the board with one seat each in 1948, with England&#x27;s seats being reduced to two, the same as the other home nations. The three Southern Hemisphere unions were given a second seat each in 1958. The French Rugby Federation was admitted in 1978, the Argentine Rugby Union, Italian Rugby Federation and USA Rugby Football Union in 1987, and the Canadian Rugby Union, and Japan Rugby Football Union were admitted in 1991. In 2016, the Georgia Rugby Union, Romanian Rugby Federation, and the USA were added to the voting Council with one vote each. Additionally, current Council members Argentina, Canada and Italy were granted a second representative and vote. The six regional associations represented on the council also received an additional vote.

After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, World Rugby suspended Russia from international and European continental rugby union competition. In addition, the Rugby Union of Russia was suspended from World Rugby.

===Rugby World Cup===

In the 1960s Australians Harold Tolhurst and Jock Kellaher suggested a World Rugby Championship be held in Australia but the IRFB refused. In 1983 and 1984 respectively, the Australian and New Zealand Rugby Football Unions each proposed hosting such a tournament. The following year the board committed to conduct a feasibility study. A year later another meeting took place in Paris, and the Union subsequently voted on the idea. The South African Rugby Board&#x27;s vote that proved crucial in setting up a tied vote, as they voted in favour, even though they knew they would be excluded due to the sporting boycott because of their apartheid policies. English and Welsh votes then changed, and the vote was won 10 to 6.

==Member unions==
As at June 2024, World Rugby has 113 member unions and 17 associate member unions.

Membership of World Rugby is a four-step process:

# A Union must apply to become an associate member of its Regional Union
# After all membership criteria are met, including one year as an associate member, the Union is admitted to the Regional Union as a full member
# After completion of stages 1 and 2, and two years as a full member of a Regional Union, the Union may then apply to become an Associate member of World Rugby. As an associate member, the union can participate in World Rugby funded tournaments but not the Rugby World Cup
# Following two years of associate membership of World Rugby, the union may then apply to become a Full Member

Regional Unions

Six regional associations, which represent each continent, are affiliated with World Rugby and help to develop the fifteen-a-side game as well as Rugby sevens across the world. Not all members of the regional associations are members of World Rugby. Below is a list of member and associate unions and their regional associations with the year that they joined World Rugby. Associate unions are in &quot;italics&quot;.

==Governance==
===Council===
The World Rugby Council meets twice a year and manages and controls the affairs of World Rugby. The Council formulates and oversees the implementation of World Rugby&#x27;s strategic plan and application of policy decisions, and selects the host nation(s) for the Rugby World Cup. The Council considers recommendations of the General Assembly. The Council may admit or expel member nations. The council is also the supreme legislative authority of World Rugby. Most Council decisions require approval of simple majority, but to amend the World Rugby&#x27;s by-laws, regulations, or the Laws of the Game requires approval of three quarters of the council.

Prior to 2016, the council had 28 voting members from 12 national unions. In November 2015, World Rugby announced that they would add more unions to the voting council and give the six regional associations two votes each on the council.

, the council had 52 members including the non-voting chairman, so there were 51 voting members from 17 national unions and 6 regional associations, allocated as follows:

* (33) Eleven unions with three votes each: , , , , , , , , , , and .
* (6) Six unions with one vote each: , , , , and .
* (12) The six regional associations representing Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, South America and Oceania with two votes each.

In total, Europe has 22 votes; Oceania 9 votes; South America 6 votes; Africa 5 votes; Asia 5 votes and North America 4 votes.

A Chairman and Vice Chairman are elected from among the council members. These positions are held by Bill Beaumont of England and Bernard Laporte of France, respectively, elected .

===Executive committee===
The executive committee, in accordance with bye-laws 9.14–9.16, ensures the effective management and operation of the World Rugby. The Committee formulates and monitors the implementation of the World Rugby&#x27;s strategic plan, business plan, operational plan and budget. 
In 2016, as part of the reforms to the World Rugby Council, the executive committee was increased to 12 members. The Chairman, Vice-chairman, nine elected officials, including two independent members, and the Chief Executive sit on the World Rugby Executive Committee.

===General Assembly===
A General Assembly of the full membership is convened every two years. The General Assembly may make recommendations to the council, and may consider business that the council has referred to it, but the General Assembly has no legislative powers.

===Leadership===
The current Chair of World Rugby is Brett Robinson who was elected following the Executive Council vote on
14 November 2024.

Previous chairmen include Bill Beaumont (2008 to 2024), Bernard Lapasset (2008 to 2016), Syd Millar (2002 to 2007) and Vernon Pugh, QC (1994 to 2002).

In July 2012, Brett Gosper was appointed as the new Chief Executive of what was then the IRB. He will leave this role at the end of 2020 to become head of the National Football League&#x27;s operations in Europe.

==Funding==
In 2013 World Rugby released £18.6 million of funding over three years for developing rugby in Canada, the United States, Japan, Romania, Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga. Argentina also received additional support to enable it to retain its tier one status. The money, built up from successful World Cups, was released following a report commissioned by World Rugby highlighting the growing disparity between tier one and tier two nations. This is in addition to the £10–12 million it normally gives out grants and tournament costs. The emphasis is on three areas infrastructure, high performance units and cross border competitions. In April 2006, tier-3 rugby nations Georgia, Portugal, Tunisia and Russia were identified as key investment nations over the next three years. The program was designed to increase the competitiveness of international rugby union.

==Tournaments==
===Rugby World Cups===
World Rugby organises the Rugby World Cup, the sport&#x27;s most recognised and most profitable competition, which has been held every four years since 1987. Despite the profitability of the World Cup, the majority of its revenues and viewers come from a small number of countries. For the 2007 Rugby World Cup final, 97% of viewers came from the founding nations, including: England, France, Wales, Ireland, Scotland, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand, with just 3% of viewers coming from all other countries.

The most recent Rugby World Cup was held in France in 2023. South Africa defeated New Zealand 12–11 in the Rugby World Cup final, winning a record fourth title.

World Rugby also organises the women&#x27;s Rugby World Cup, also held every four years. It was first held by the IRB in 1998, though tournaments in 1991 and 1994 were retrospectively recognised in 2009. The women&#x27;s World Cup is contested by fewer teams than the men&#x27;s Cup, with only the 1998 and 2002 editions featuring more than 12 teams (these competitions both had 16 teams, compared to the 20 teams in the men&#x27;s Rugby World Cup).

On 21 August 2019, World Rugby announced that all future men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s World Cups would officially be known as &quot;Rugby World Cup&quot;, with no sex or gender designations. The first tournament to be affected by this policy was the 2021 Rugby World Cup, for women&#x27;s team in New Zealand.

===Sevens===
World Rugby organised three international sevens tournaments - two annual Sevens Series (one for men and one for women) which are now defunct. The quadrennial Rugby World Cup Sevens is still active.

The men&#x27;s season-long annual Sevens Series took place over 10 legs, each held in a different country. The women&#x27;s Sevens Series is held over five- or six-legs. Both tournaments followed the same principle—points are awarded based on a teams position in each round of the series, and the team with the most points at the end of the Series is crowned champions. Following the inclusion of rugby sevens into the Olympics, beginning with the 2014–15 series, the series prior to an Olympic event (i.e. the series which ends in the year before the Olympics takes place) forms the first phase of Olympic qualification. When Olympic Qualification was included, the top four teams from both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s series qualified for the Olympic Games, and remaining teams competed in regional competitions for one of the remaining places.

The quadrennial Rugby World Cup Sevens includes both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s world cup tournaments. It was originally due to be discontinued after the inclusion of rugby sevens into the Olympic Programme. However, it was later decided to retain the tournament, as it involved a significantly larger number of teams than the Olympics would, and to move the tournament so as to create a more even sevens calendar (with the &quot;major&quot; sevens events alternating every two years). As a result, the most recent tournament was the 2018 Rugby World Cup Sevens in San Francisco, US. The men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s competitions at this event were both won by New Zealand.

====SVNS====

In 2023 World Rugby re-branded the Sevens series to a new World Rugby SVNS Series known as the HSBC SVNS. The new format will showcase the twelve best men’s and women’s teams, which will conclude in a Grand Final weekend where the top eight teams will compete to be crowned Series champions. The teams ranked ninth to twelfth will compete against the top four teams from a new Challenger Series in a relegation play-off to see who secures their place in the 2024–2025 season. Both men and women’s teams will earn the same with equal participation fees. Both men and women will play in joint tournaments in eight cities around the world. Starting in December 2023 in Dubai, Cape Town, Perth, Vancouver, Los Angeles, Hong Kong, Singapore and will conclude in Madrid in June 2024. The tournament is set to bring about a festival type atmosphere and serve as a build up to the Paris 2024 Olympic Games.

===Developmental competitions===
World Rugby organizes annual international competitions involving Tier 2 nations.

* Pacific Nations Cup, which has been played annually since 2006. The national teams of Fiji, Samoa, Japan, Tonga, Canada and the United States currently compete for the cup. At various times in the past, the national teams of Japan, Georgia, Canada, and the United States, plus second-tier representative sides from Australia and New Zealand, have also been involved.
* Pacific Challenge, which is a competition involving the national &quot;A&quot; sides from Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga (and more recently Junior Japan, Canada A, and Argentina&#x27;s Pampas XV).
* Americas Rugby Championship, whose current incarnation involves Argentina&#x27;s &quot;A&quot; side, currently branded as Argentina XV, and the full national teams of Brazil, Canada, Chile, Uruguay, and the USA.

===Junior competitions===
World Rugby organizes two competitions for under-20 national teams, the World Rugby Under 20 Championship and the World Rugby Under 20 Trophy. These competitions were created following the merger of under-19 and under-21 representative teams, into an under-20 age group

===Current title holders===
==Olympics==

The sport of rugby union has been played at the Summer Olympics on four occasions, with the last being in 1924. The winners, and thus the reigning champions, were the U.S. team. Rugby union made one more appearance as a demonstration event but was then removed from the Games. World Rugby has most recently been very keen to see it return to the Games and is adamant that the sport (specifically referring to rugby sevens) satisfies every respect of the criteria set out in the Olympic Charter.

The main problem for reintroducing the 15-man game to the Olympics is the 7-day turnaround required by World Rugby regulations for players to rest between games. Since the Olympics only officially run for 16 days, with only slight expansions allowed to accommodate sports such as football, this effectively makes it impossible to conduct a 15s tournament within the current Olympic schedule. This limitation does not apply to sevens, as games last only 14 minutes instead of the 80 minutes in the 15s game. All of the events in the current men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s Sevens Series, which feature a minimum of 16 national teams for men and 12 for women, are conducted within a single weekend.

But in furthering the World Rugby cause, the organisation became an International Olympic Committee Recognised International Federation in 1995, marked by a ceremonial signing by President Juan Antonio Samaranch prior to a match between Wales and South Africa in Cardiff.

World Rugby cites rugby union&#x27;s global participation, with men playing the game in well over 100 countries and women playing in over 50 as well; the organisation&#x27;s compliance with the World Anti-Doping Code; and that a rugby sev3ns tournament could be (and generally is) accommodated in one stadium and is relatively inexpensive to play. Not only is the sevens game successful in the context of the Sevens World Series and World Cup Sevens, it is also very successfully played in the Commonwealth Games; the sevens tournament at the 2006 Games in Melbourne set all-time attendance records for a sevens tournament.

As a result of this, World Rugby applied to the International Olympic Committee for a Sevens tournament to form part of the Olympics. Subsequently, Sevens was accepted into the Summer Olympic Games and was first played in 2016 in Rio de Janeiro which was won by Fiji in the men&#x27;s competition (defeating Great Britain) and by Australia in the women&#x27;s competition (defeating New Zealand). In the Tokyo Olympics 2020 edition, the Fiji 7s men&#x27;s team and the New Zealand 7s women&#x27;s team claimed the gold medals in their respective competitions.

==Laws and regulations==
The laws of rugby union are controlled by a standing Laws Committee, which is established by the World Rugby Council. The current chairman of the committee is Bill Beaumont. The Laws of the Game are formulated by World Rugby, and are then circulated by the national Unions. The official laws of the game are written in English, French, Russian and Spanish. There are variations for under-19 and Sevens rugby. There are 21 regulations in total, these regulations range from definitions, eligibility, advertising, disciplinary, anti-doping and a number of other areas. World Rugby also approves equipment, which are tested at an Approved Testing House.

===Experimental law variations===

In 2006, the IRB initiated proposals for variations to the laws, which were formulated and trialled initially at Stellenbosch University in South Africa. Further trials were set down for 2007 and 2008. The law variations aimed to push the balance between defensive and attacking play more in favour of attacking play, and to reduce stoppages for penalties and infringements.

===Anti-doping===
World Rugby is compliant with the WADA code. The World Rugby anti doping programme includes testing at the under 19 and under 21 level, sevens and senior 15 a side. Testing is a mix of in-competition at World Rugby organised events, as well as out-of-competition testing, which can occur during a specified one-hour time slot designated by a player. In 2003, World Cup year, the World Rugby member unions undertook approximately 3,000 tests. &quot;Keep Rugby Clean&quot; is a campaign message run by the World Rugby Anti-Doping Manager Tim Ricketts. The programme is supported by stars such as Brian O&#x27;Driscoll.

==World rankings==
World Rugby publishes and maintains the World Rugby Rankings of the men&#x27;s national rugby union teams (and more recently also for women&#x27;s teams). The concept was launched in October 2003, at the start of that year&#x27;s world cup in Australia. The rankings are calculated using a Points Exchange system, whereby nations take points off each other based on a match result. Several years of research went into developing the rankings system, using an extensive database of international matches that date back to 1871.

The system&#x27;s reliability is assessed in a number of objective ways, which includes predictions of current strength and responds to changes in form. The system takes into account home advantage, in that the home nation is treated as though it has an extra three rating points, effectively handicapping them, as they will gain fewer ranking points for a win, and lose more should they lose. In the case of a freak result, there is a maximum number of movements on the ranking that any nation can gain from one match.

If a nation does not play for a number of years they are considered dormant, and excluded from the rankings, upon returning, picking up from where they were excluded. If a nation is to merge or split, the highest rating of any of the rankings is inherited.

Currently all capped international matches are equally weighted, whether or not they take place within a competition or are played as tests; the sole exception to this is the World Cup final tournament.

==Recognitions and awards==
The World Rugby Awards were introduced in 2001, to honour outstanding achievements in rugby union. Prior to 2009, all of the awards were announced at an annual ceremony; the most recent such ceremony was held in London on 23 November 2008.

However, as a response to the Great Recession, the annual ceremony only saw the International Player, Team, and Coach of the Year Awards presented in 2009 and 2010; all other awards were presented at different times throughout the year. The IRB reinstated a single year-end ceremony in 2011 after the 2011 Rugby World Cup. Since then, it has chosen to present some awards at times relevant to those specific prizes—such as Sevens awards after the London Sevens, the final event of the Sevens World Series, and the Junior Player award after the final of the Junior World Championship. The bulk of awards will be presented at the year-end Awards ceremony.

The current awards are:
* World Rugby Men&#x27;s 15s Player of the Year
* World Rugby Women’s 15s Player of the Year
* World Rugby Men’s Sevens Player of the Year
* World Rugby Women&#x27;s Sevens Player of the Year
* World Rugby Junior Player of the Year
* Vernon Pugh Award for Distinguished Service
* World Rugby Coach of the Year
* World Rugby Men’s 15s Breakthrough Player of the Year
* World Rugby Women’s 15s Breakthrough Player of the Year
* World Rugby Referee Award
* World Rugby Women&#x27;s 15s Dream Team of the Year
* World Rugby Men&#x27;s 15s Dream Team of the Year
* World Rugby Team of the Year

At the year-end ceremony, the International Rugby Players&#x27; Association also hands out the following awards:
* IRP Men&#x27;s Try of the Year
* IRP Women&#x27;s Try of the Year
* IRP Special Merit Award

In the past, the following awards have also been awarded:
* IRB International U21 Player of the Year
* IRB Under 19 Player of the Year
* IRB Chairman&#x27;s Award
* IRB Development Award
* IRB Spirit of Rugby Award

The awards that recognise achievements in the preceding 12 months tend to be won by that season&#x27;s most successful nation(s): France in 2002, England in 2003, South Africa in 2004, New Zealand in 2005, South Africa again in 2007. For those award categories that have nominees, a shortlist is drawn up by an independent panel of judges, who are all former internationals. The panel then reconvenes to choose a winner. The current judges are Jonathan Davies, Will Greenwood, Gavin Hastings, Michael Jones, Dan Lyle, Federico Méndez, Francois Pienaar and past Player of the Year winners Fabien Galthié and Keith Wood, with John Eales as convenor. The judges have a total of over 500 caps between them.

In 2006 a Hall of Fame was established to chronicle the achievements and special contribution of the sport&#x27;s players, coaches, administrators, match officials, institutions and other individuals. The Hall of Fame was inaugurated at the 2006 IRB Awards, when William Webb Ellis and Rugby School were named as the first two inductees. Hall of Fame inductees in 2007 were Pierre de Coubertin, Danie Craven, John Eales, Gareth Edwards and Wilson Whineray. The 2008 inductees were the 1888–89 New Zealand Native football team and its organiser Joe Warbrick, Jack Kyle, Melrose RFC and Ned Haig (for their roles in the invention of rugby sevens), Hugo Porta, and Philippe Sella. Since then, induction ceremonies have been held annually, except in 2010.

The last year for a single induction ceremony was 2009. Starting in 2011, ceremonies have been held at multiple locations around the world. Also, some or all of the inductions have had an overriding theme since 2009:
* 2009 – Lions tours to South Africa; all candidates for induction were either Lions or Springboks.
* 2011 – The year&#x27;s final set of inductions, held at the IRB Awards in Auckland on the night after the 2011 Rugby World Cup final, was, according to the IRB, &quot;under the theme of Rugby World Cup founders, visionaries and iconic figures&quot;.
* 2012 – The IRB&#x27;s theme for this year&#x27;s inductions was &quot;Rugby - a global Game&quot;, &quot;celebrat[ing] Rugby&#x27;s expansion to become a global sport played by millions of men and women worldwide.&quot;

==UK neurological injuries lawsuit==
In December 2023 a group of 295 former rugby players sued World Rugby, the Rugby Football Union and the Welsh Rugby Union 
for allegedly failing to put in place reasonable measures to protect the health and safety of players. This alleged failure was said to have caused disorders such as motor neurone disease, early onset dementia, chronic traumatic encephalopathy, epilepsy and Parkinson&#x27;s disease.

<text>A reflecting telescope (also called a reflector) is a telescope that uses a single or a combination of curved mirrors that reflect light and form an image. The reflecting telescope was invented in the 17th century by Isaac Newton as an alternative to the refracting telescope which, at that time, was a design that suffered from severe chromatic aberration. Although reflecting telescopes produce other types of optical aberrations, it is a design that allows for very large diameter objectives. Almost all of the major telescopes used in astronomy research are reflectors. Many variant forms are in use and some employ extra optical elements to improve image quality or place the image in a mechanically advantageous position. Since reflecting telescopes use mirrors, the design is sometimes referred to as a [[catoptrics|catoptric]] telescope.

From the time of Newton to the 1800s, the mirror itself was made of metalusually speculum metal. This type included Newton&#x27;s first designs and the largest telescope of the 19th century, the Leviathan of Parsonstown with a wide metal mirror. In the 19th century a new method using a block of glass coated with very thin layer of silver began to become more popular by the turn of the century. Common telescopes which led to the Crossley and Harvard reflecting telescopes, which helped establish a better reputation for reflecting telescopes as the metal mirror designs were noted for their drawbacks. Chiefly the metal mirrors only reflected about of the light and the metal would tarnish. After multiple polishings and tarnishings, the mirror could lose its precise figuring needed.

Reflecting telescopes became extraordinarily popular for astronomy and many famous telescopes, such as the Hubble Space Telescope, and popular amateur models use this design. In addition, the reflection telescope principle was applied to other electromagnetic wavelengths, and for example, X-ray telescopes also use the reflection principle to make image-forming optics.

==History==


The idea that curved mirrors behave like lenses dates back at least to Alhazen&#x27;s 11th century treatise on optics, works that had been widely disseminated in Latin translations in early modern Europe. Soon after the invention of the refracting telescope, Galileo, Giovanni Francesco Sagredo, and others, spurred on by their knowledge of the principles of curved mirrors, discussed the idea of building a telescope using a mirror as the image forming objective. There were reports that the Bolognese Cesare Caravaggi had constructed one around 1626 and the Italian professor Niccolò Zucchi, in a later work, wrote that he had experimented with a concave bronze mirror in 1616, but said it did not produce a satisfactory image. The potential advantages of using parabolic mirrors, primarily reduction of spherical aberration with no chromatic aberration, led to many proposed designs for reflecting telescopes. These included one by James Gregory, published in 1663. In 1673, experimental scientist Robert Hooke was able to build this type of telescope, which became known as the Gregorian telescope.

Five years after Gregory designed his telescope and five years before Hooke built the first such Gregorian telescope, Isaac Newton in 1668 built his own reflecting telescope, which is generally acknowledged as the first reflecting telescope. It used a spherically ground metal primary mirror and a small diagonal mirror in an optical configuration that has come to be known as the Newtonian telescope.

Despite the theoretical advantages of the reflector design, the difficulty of construction and the poor performance of the speculum metal mirrors being used at the time meant it took over 100 years for them to become popular. Many of the advances in reflecting telescopes included the perfection of parabolic mirror fabrication in the 18th century, silver coated glass mirrors in the 19th century (built by Léon Foucault in 1858), long-lasting aluminum coatings in the 20th century, segmented mirrors to allow larger diameters, and active optics to compensate for gravitational deformation. A mid-20th century innovation was catadioptric telescopes such as the Schmidt camera, which use both a spherical mirror and a lens (called a corrector plate) as primary optical elements, mainly used for wide-field imaging without spherical aberration.

The late 20th century has seen the development of adaptive optics and lucky imaging to overcome the problems of seeing, and reflecting telescopes are ubiquitous on space telescopes and many types of spacecraft imaging devices.

==Technical considerations==

A curved primary mirror is the reflector telescope&#x27;s basic optical element that creates an image at the focal plane. The distance from the mirror to the focal plane is called the focal length. Film or a digital sensor may be located here to record the image, or a secondary mirror may be added to modify the optical characteristics and/or redirect the light to film, digital sensors, or an eyepiece for visual observation.

The primary mirror in most modern telescopes is composed of a solid glass cylinder whose front surface has been ground to a spherical or parabolic shape. A thin layer of aluminum is vacuum deposited onto the mirror, forming a highly reflective first surface mirror.

Some telescopes use primary mirrors which are made differently. Molten glass is rotated to make its surface paraboloidal, and is kept rotating while it cools and solidifies. (See Rotating furnace.) The resulting mirror shape approximates a desired paraboloid shape that requires minimal grinding and polishing to reach the exact figure needed.

===Optical errors===
Reflecting telescopes, just like any other optical system, do not produce &quot;perfect&quot; images. The need to image objects at distances up to infinity, view them at different wavelengths of light, along with the requirement to have some way to view the image the primary mirror produces, means there is always some compromise in a reflecting telescope&#x27;s optical design.

Because the primary mirror focuses light to a common point in front of its own reflecting surface almost all reflecting telescope designs have a secondary mirror, film holder, or detector near that focal point partially obstructing the light from reaching the primary mirror. Not only does this cause some reduction in the amount of light the system collects, it also causes a loss in contrast in the image due to diffraction effects of the obstruction as well as diffraction spikes caused by most secondary support structures.

The use of mirrors avoids chromatic aberration but they produce other types of aberrations. A simple spherical mirror cannot bring light from a distant object to a common focus since the reflection of light rays striking the mirror near its edge do not converge with those that reflect from nearer the center of the mirror, a defect called spherical aberration. To avoid this problem most reflecting telescopes use parabolic shaped mirrors, a shape that can focus all the light to a common focus. Parabolic mirrors work well with objects near the center of the image they produce, (light traveling parallel to the mirror&#x27;s optical axis), but towards the edge of that same field of view they suffer from off axis aberrations:

* Coma – an aberration where point sources (stars) at the center of the image are focused to a point but typically appears as &quot;comet-like&quot; radial smudges that get worse towards the edges of the image.
* Field curvature – The best image plane is in general curved, which may not correspond to the detector&#x27;s shape and leads to a focus error across the field. It is sometimes corrected by a field flattening lens.
* Astigmatism – an azimuthal variation of focus around the aperture causing point source images off-axis to appear elliptical. Astigmatism is not usually a problem in a narrow field of view, but in a wide field image it gets rapidly worse and varies quadratically with field angle.
* Distortion – Distortion does not affect image quality (sharpness) but does affect object shapes. It is sometimes corrected by image processing.

There are reflecting telescope designs that use modified mirror surfaces (such as the Ritchey–Chrétien telescope) or some form of correcting lens (such as catadioptric telescopes) that correct some of these aberrations.

==Use in astronomical research==

Nearly all large research-grade astronomical telescopes are reflectors. There are several reasons for this:
* Reflectors work in a wider spectrum of light since certain wavelengths are absorbed when passing through glass elements like those found in a refractor or in a catadioptric telescope.
* In a lens the entire volume of material has to be free of imperfection and inhomogeneities, whereas in a mirror, only one surface has to be perfectly polished.
* Light of different wavelengths travels through a medium other than vacuum at different speeds. This causes chromatic aberration. Reducing this to acceptable levels usually involves a combination of two or three aperture sized lenses (see achromat and apochromat for more details). The cost of such systems therefore scales significantly with aperture size. An image obtained from a mirror does not suffer from chromatic aberration to begin with, and the cost of the mirror scales much more modestly with its size.
* There are structural problems involved in manufacturing and manipulating large-aperture lenses. Since a lens can only be held in place by its edge, the center of a large lens will sag due to gravity, distorting the image it produces. The largest practical lens size in a refracting telescope is around 1 meter. In contrast, a mirror can be supported by the whole side opposite its reflecting face, allowing for reflecting telescope designs that can overcome gravitational sag. The largest reflector designs currently exceed 10 meters in diameter.

== Reflecting telescope designs ==

===Gregorian===

The Gregorian telescope, described by Scottish astronomer and mathematician James Gregory in his 1663 book &quot;Optica Promota&quot;, employs a concave secondary mirror that reflects the image back through a hole in the primary mirror. This produces an upright image, useful for terrestrial observations. Some small spotting scopes are still built this way. There are several large modern telescopes that use a Gregorian configuration such as the Vatican Advanced Technology Telescope, the Magellan telescopes, the Large Binocular Telescope, and the Giant Magellan Telescope.
===Newtonian===



The Newtonian telescope was the first successful reflecting telescope, completed by Isaac Newton in 1668. It usually has a paraboloid primary mirror but at focal ratios of about f/10 or longer a spherical primary mirror can be sufficient for high visual resolution. A flat secondary mirror reflects the light to a focal plane at the side of the top of the telescope tube. It is one of the simplest and least expensive designs for a given size of primary, and is popular with amateur telescope makers as a home-build project.
===The Cassegrain design and its variations===

The Cassegrain telescope (sometimes called the &quot;Classic Cassegrain&quot;) was first published in a 1672 design attributed to Laurent Cassegrain. It has a parabolic primary mirror, and a hyperbolic secondary mirror that reflects the light back down through a hole in the primary. The folding and diverging effect of the secondary mirror creates a telescope with a long focal length while having a short tube length. 
====Ritchey–Chrétien====

The Ritchey–Chrétien telescope, invented by George Willis Ritchey and Henri Chrétien in the early 1910s, is a specialized Cassegrain reflector which has two hyperbolic mirrors (instead of a parabolic primary). It is free of coma and spherical aberration at a nearly flat focal plane if the primary and secondary curvature are properly figured, making it well suited for wide field and photographic observations. Almost every professional reflector telescope in the world is of the Ritchey–Chrétien design.

====Three-mirror anastigmat====

Including a third curved mirror allows correction of the remaining distortion, astigmatism, from the Ritchey–Chrétien design. This allows much larger fields of view.

====Dall–Kirkham====
The Dall–Kirkham Cassegrain telescope&#x27;s design was created by Horace Dall in 1928 and took on the name in an article published in &quot;Scientific American&quot; in 1930 following discussion between amateur astronomer Allan Kirkham and Albert G. Ingalls, the magazine editor at the time. It uses a concave elliptical primary mirror and a convex spherical secondary. While this system is easier to grind than a classic Cassegrain or Ritchey–Chrétien system, it does not correct for off-axis coma. Field curvature is actually less than a classical Cassegrain. Because this is less noticeable at longer focal ratios, Dall–Kirkhams are seldom faster than f/15.

===Off-axis designs===

There are several designs that try to avoid obstructing the incoming light by eliminating the secondary or moving any secondary element off the primary mirror&#x27;s optical axis, commonly called off-axis optical systems.

==== Herschelian ====

The Herschelian reflector is named after William Herschel, who used this design to build very large telescopes including the 40-foot telescope in 1789. In the Herschelian reflector the primary mirror is tilted so the observer&#x27;s head does not block the incoming light. Although this introduces geometrical aberrations, Herschel employed this design to avoid the use of a Newtonian secondary mirror since the speculum metal mirrors of that time tarnished quickly and could only achieve 60% reflectivity.

====Schiefspiegler====

A variant of the Cassegrain, the Schiefspiegler telescope (&quot;skewed&quot; or &quot;oblique reflector&quot;) uses tilted mirrors to avoid the secondary mirror casting a shadow on the primary. However, while eliminating diffraction patterns this leads to an increase in coma and astigmatism. These defects become manageable at large focal ratios — most Schiefspieglers use f/15 or longer, which tends to restrict useful observations to objects which fit in a moderate field of view. A 6&quot; (150mm) f/15 telescope offers a maximum 0.75 degree field of view using 1.25&quot; eyepieces. 
A number of variations are common, with varying numbers of mirrors of different types. The Kutter (named after its inventor Anton Kutter) style uses a single concave primary, a convex secondary and a plano-convex lens between the secondary mirror and the focal plane, when needed (this is the case of the &quot;catadioptric Schiefspiegler&quot;). 
One variation of a multi-schiefspiegler uses a concave primary, convex secondary and a parabolic tertiary. One of the interesting aspects of some Schiefspieglers is that one of the mirrors can be involved in the light path twice — each light path reflects along a different meridional path.

====Stevick-Paul====

Stevick-Paul telescopes are off-axis versions of Paul 3-mirror systems with an added flat diagonal mirror. 
A convex secondary mirror is placed just to the side of the light entering the telescope, and positioned afocally so as to send parallel light on to the tertiary.
The concave tertiary mirror is positioned exactly twice as far to the side of the entering beam as was the convex secondary, and its own radius of curvature distant from the secondary. Because the tertiary mirror receives parallel light from the secondary, it forms an image at its focus.
The focal plane lies within the system of mirrors, but is accessible to the eye with the inclusion of a flat diagonal.
The Stevick-Paul configuration results in all optical aberrations totaling zero to the third-order, except for the Petzval surface which is gently curved.
====Yolo====

The Yolo was developed by Arthur S. Leonard in the mid-1960s. Like the Schiefspiegler, it is an unobstructed, tilted reflector telescope. The original Yolo consists of a primary and secondary concave mirror, with the same curvature, and the same tilt to the main axis. Most Yolos use toroidal reflectors. The Yolo design eliminates coma, but leaves significant astigmatism, which is reduced by deformation of the secondary mirror by some form of warping harness, or alternatively, polishing a toroidal figure into the secondary.
Like Schiefspieglers, many Yolo variations have been pursued. The needed amount of toroidal shape 
can be transferred entirely or partially to the primary mirror. In large focal ratios optical assemblies, both primary and secondary mirror can be left spherical and a spectacle correcting lens is added between the secondary mirror and the focal plane (&quot;catadioptric Yolo&quot;). The addition of a convex, long focus tertiary mirror leads to Leonard&#x27;s &quot;Solano&quot; configuration. The Solano telescope doesn&#x27;t contain any toric surfaces.
===Liquid-mirror telescopes===

One design of telescope uses a rotating mirror consisting of a liquid metal in a tray that is spun at constant speed. As the tray spins, the liquid forms a paraboloidal surface of essentially unlimited size. This allows making very big telescope mirrors (over 6 metres), but they are limited to use by zenith telescopes.

==Focal planes==

=== Prime focus ===

In a &quot;prime focus&quot; design no secondary optics are used, the image is accessed at the focal point of the primary mirror. At the focal point is some type of structure for holding a film plate or electronic detector. In the past, in very large telescopes, an observer would sit inside the telescope in an &quot;observing cage&quot; to directly view the image or operate a camera. Nowadays CCD cameras allow for remote operation of the telescope from almost anywhere in the world. The space available at prime focus is severely limited by the need to avoid obstructing the incoming light.

Radio telescopes often have a prime focus design. The mirror is replaced by a metal surface for reflecting radio waves, and the observer is an antenna.
=== Cassegrain focus ===

For telescopes built to the Cassegrain design or other related designs, the image is formed behind the primary mirror, at the focal point of the secondary mirror. An observer views through the rear of the telescope, or a camera or other instrument is mounted on the rear. Cassegrain focus is commonly used for amateur telescopes or smaller research telescopes. However, for large telescopes with correspondingly large instruments, an instrument at Cassegrain focus must move with the telescope as it slews; this places additional requirements on the strength of the instrument support structure, and potentially limits the movement of the telescope in order to avoid collision with obstacles such as walls or equipment inside the observatory.

=== Nasmyth and coudé focus ===

====Nasmyth====

The Nasmyth design is similar to the Cassegrain except the light is not directed through a hole in the primary mirror; instead, a third mirror reflects the light to the side of the telescope to allow for the mounting of heavy instruments. This is a very common design in large research telescopes.

====Coudé====

Adding further optics to a Nasmyth-style telescope to deliver the light (usually through the declination axis) to a fixed focus point that does not move as the telescope is reoriented gives a &quot;coudé&quot; focus (from the French word for elbow). The coudé focus gives a narrower field of view than a Nasmyth focus and is used with very heavy instruments that do not need a wide field of view. One such application is high-resolution spectrographs that have large collimating mirrors (ideally with the same diameter as the telescope&#x27;s primary mirror) and very long focal lengths. Such instruments could not withstand being moved, and adding mirrors to the light path to form a &quot;coudé train&quot;, diverting the light to a fixed position to such an instrument housed on or below the observing floor (and usually built as an unmoving integral part of the observatory building) was the only option. The 60-inch Hale telescope (1.5 m), Hooker Telescope, 200-inch Hale Telescope, Shane Telescope, and Harlan J. Smith Telescope all were built with coudé foci instrumentation. The development of echelle spectrometers allowed high-resolution spectroscopy with a much more compact instrument, one which can sometimes be successfully mounted on the Cassegrain focus. Since inexpensive and adequately stable computer-controlled alt-az telescope mounts were developed in the 1980s, the Nasmyth design has generally supplanted the coudé focus for large telescopes.

===Fibre-fed spectrographs===

For instruments requiring very high stability, or that are very large and cumbersome, it is desirable to mount the instrument on a rigid structure, rather than moving it with the telescope. Whilst transmission of the full field of view would require a standard coudé focus, spectroscopy typically involves the measurement of only a few discrete objects, such as stars or galaxies. It is therefore feasible to collect light from these objects with optical fibers at the telescope, placing the instrument at an arbitrary distance from the telescope. Examples of fiber-fed spectrographs include the planet-hunting spectrographs HARPS or ESPRESSO.

Additionally, the flexibility of optical fibers allow light to be collected from any focal plane; for example, the HARPS spectrograph utilises the Cassegrain focus of the ESO 3.6 m Telescope, whilst the Prime Focus Spectrograph is connected to the prime focus of the Subaru telescope.

Despite the prevalence of Christianity, native beliefs about the &quot;aswang&quot; and the &quot;babaylan&quot; are still prevalent among the people. &quot;Kulam&quot; or witchcraft, locally known as &quot;amulit&quot; is still feared by many residents.

===Cuisine===
Two main dishes associated with Aklan and Aklanons are inubaran and binakol.

Inubaran, is a Filipino chicken stew or soup made with chicken cooked with diced banana pith, coconut milk (&quot;gata&quot;) or coconut cream (&quot;kakang gata&quot;), a souring agent, lemongrass, and various spices. The souring agent (called &quot;aeabihig&quot;) is traditionally either &quot;batuan&quot; fruits (&quot;Garcinia morella&quot;) or &quot;libas&quot; leaves (&quot;Spondias pinnata&quot;). The name means &quot;[cooked] with &quot;ubad&quot; (banana pith)&quot;, not to be confused with &quot;ubod&quot; (palm heart); although &quot;ubod&quot; can sometimes be used as a substitute for &quot;ubad&quot; which can be difficult to acquire. Variants of the dish can also be made with other types of meat or seafood. It is a type of &quot;ginataan&quot;.

Binakol, also spelled binakoe, is a Filipino chicken soup made from chicken cooked in coconut water with grated coconut, green papaya (or chayote), leafy vegetables, garlic, onion, ginger, lemongrass, and &quot;patis&quot; (fish sauce). It can also be spiced with chilis. &quot;Binakol&quot; can also be cooked with other kinds of meat or seafood. It was traditionally cooked inside bamboo tubes or directly on halved coconut shells.

&quot;Linapay&quot; also known as &quot;tinamuk&quot;, is a dish related to Laing but from Aklan in the Western Visayas. It is made from pounded freshwater shrimp (&quot;ueang&quot;) mixed with &quot;gawud&quot; (grated young coconut meat) and wrapped with taro leaves (&quot;gutaw&quot;) and cooked in coconut milk.

===Festivals===
The province is known for its festivities which includes the Ati-Atihan festival in Kalibo. Originally, the festival was to celebrate the treaty between the Ati and the Malayan tribes who settled in the Island. The Ati live in the mountain regions and the Malay people in the flatlands or close to the water. The festivity begins on the dry season, at which time the Ati come down from the mountains to trade and celebrate with the Malayan tribes. When the Spaniards settled in the region and converted the Malays to their Christian religion, they asked the Malays to celebrate this festivity to coincide with the Feast of the Santo Niño (Holy Child) which is usually held during the third week of January.

==== Ati-Atihan Festival ====
The Ati-Atihan Festival is a feast held annually in honor of the Santo Niño (Infant Jesus), held on the third Sunday of January in the town of Kalibo, Aklan, Philippines, on the island of Panay. It originally came from Batan, Aklan, then adopted later by some neighboring towns. The name &quot;Ati-Atihan&quot; means &quot;to be like Atis&quot; or &quot;to make believe Atis&quot;, the local name for the Aeta aborigines who first settled in Panay Island and other parts of the archipelago.

The festival consists of tribal dance, music, accompanied by indigenous costumes and weapons, and parade along the street. Christians and non-Christians observe this day with religious processions. It has inspired many other Philippine Festivals including the Sinulog Festival of Cebu City and Dinagyang of Iloilo City, both adaptations of the Kalibo&#x27;s Ati-Atihan Festival, and legally holds the title &quot;The Mother of All Philippine Festivals&quot;, being the oldest festival in the Philippines and in spite of the other Sinulog and Dinagyang festivals&#x27; claims of the same title.

The costumes worn at the festival is patterned after the African tribal design like those seen at the Rio Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil.

A 1200 A.D. event explains the origins of the festival. A group of 10 Malay chieftains called &quot;Datus&quot;, fleeing from the island of Borneo settled in the Philippines, and were granted settlement by the Ati people, the tribes of Panay Island. Datu Puti made a trade with the natives and bought the plains for a golden salakot, brass basins and bales of cloth. They gave a very long necklace to the wife of the Ati chieftain. Feasting and festivities followed soon after.

Some time later, the Ati people were struggling with famine as the result of a bad harvest. They were forced to descend from their mountain village into the settlement below, to seek the generosity of the people who now lived there. The &quot;Datus&quot; obliged and gave them food. In return, the Ati danced and sang for them, grateful for the gifts they had been given.

The festivity was originally a pagan festival from this tribe practicing Animism, and their worshiping their anito god. Spanish missionaries gradually added a Christian meaning. Today, the Ati-Atihan is celebrated as a religious festival.

In 2012, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts (NCCA) and the ICHCAP of UNESCO published &quot;Pinagmulan: Enumeration from the Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage&quot;. The first edition of the UNESCO-backed book included the &quot;Ati-atihan Festival&quot;, signifying its great importance to Philippine intangible cultural heritage. The local government of Aklan, in cooperation with the NCCA, was given the right to nominate the Ati-atihan Festival in the UNESCO Intangible Cultural Heritage Lists.

The people attend masses for the &quot;Santo Niño&quot;, and benefit dances sponsored by government organizations. The formal opening mass emphasizes the festival&#x27;s religious event. The procession begins with a rhythmic drumbeats, and dances parading along the streets. The second day begins at dawn with a rosary procession, which ends with a community mass, and procession. The phrase &quot;Hala Bira! Pwera Pasma!&quot; is originally associated with the Sto. Nino Ati-Atihan Festival as the revelers and devotees keep on going with the festivities all over the town from morning to the wee hours of the next morning, rain or shine, for one week or even more. They believe that the miraculous Child Jesus will protect them from harm and illness. The highlight of the festival occurs on the third Saturday of January, when groups representing different tribes compete for tourists&#x27; attention and prizes. The festival ends with a procession of thousands of people carrying torches and different kinds of images of the Santo Niño on the third Sunday. The contest winners are announced at a masquerade ball which officially ends the festival.

==== Bariw Festival ====
Bariw Festival is a unique festival showcasing the skills of every Nabasnon in weaving bags, mats and hats made of &quot;bariw&quot; leaves – the prospering livelihood in the municipality. It is highlighted by the dance performance of local talent and ingenuity to the beat of the drums and indigenous rhythm celebrated every May 14 of the year.

==== Bugna Festival ====
Bugna Festival is a festival showcasing the different locally produced products and eco-tourism destinations of Tangalan like the marine sanctuary and coral garden, Afga Point, Campo Verde, Jawili Falls, Bughawi beach and reforestation project every May 16 of the year.

==== Kali-Ugyon Festival ====
Kali-Ugyon Festival (&quot;kali&quot; stands for Kalipayan or happiness and &quot;Ugyon&quot; meaning &quot;unity&quot;). This is the festival celebrated in Libacao every December 30 to January 1, costumed in modern and indigenous outfits bringing people together on the streets for merry-making and to drive away evil spirits in the coming New Year.

<text>Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) was a regional airline in the United States based in the A-Tech Center in College Park, Georgia, flying to 144 destinations as a Delta Connection carrier on behalf of Delta Air Lines via a code sharing agreement and, as of February 2010, commenced service as a United Express carrier on behalf of United Airlines via a separate code sharing agreement. It was a wholly owned subsidiary of SkyWest, Inc. ASA operated nearly 900 flights each day. Its main hub was located at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport (ATL) which is also a hub for Delta. After a 2010 merger with ExpressJet, ASA adopted the ExpressJet name and branding in 2011.

In November 2011, ASA and ExpressJet received a single operating certificate from the FAA and in December 2011, all flights were then operated by ExpressJet on behalf of its major airline code sharing partners.

== History ==
On March 12, 1979, the company was incorporated as Atlantic Southeast Airlines, Inc. with headquarters established in the Atlanta area. June 27 saw the start of operations with three 19-passenger de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter turboprop aircraft on an intrastate route between Atlanta and Columbus. From 1979 to 1999 the call sign for ASA was &quot;ACEY&quot;. In 1999 there was confusion between the ACEY call sign and that of the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) New Mexico-based fighter unit&#x27;s call sign &quot;ACER&quot;. The FAA insisted that one of the entities change its call sign; ASA was the one to change since it had used ACEY for the least amount of time. June 27, 1999, ASA changed to call sign CAA &quot;Candler&quot; after the founder of Coca-Cola, Asa Candler (whose first name also forms the company&#x27;s acronym). On March 15, 2006, ASA was allowed to change its call sign back to ACEY, after the New Mexico fighter unit was disestablished. Over the years, ASA&#x27;s ICAO identifier changed from ASE to CAA to ACY to ASQ.. The company went public when the initial stock offering was completed in 1982.

The first of a fleet of Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante twin engine turboprop commuter airliners was delivered to ASA in December 1980. On April 1, 1983, the company acquired Southeastern Airlines. On May 1, 1984, ASA joined the Delta Connection program as one of the first regional partners. After only a few years as a true regional airline, the company was named &#x27;Regional Airline of the Year&#x27; by &quot;Air Transport World&quot; in January 1987.

ASA initiated jet service with introduction of British Aerospace BAe 146-200 aircraft in 1995. Two years later, the company began using Canadair CRJ200 regional jets for service from its Atlanta hub. CRJ service from the Dallas/Fort Worth hub began in 2000.

On September 8, 1998, the company was honored as one of the global aviation and aerospace industry&#x27;s best managed companies by Aviation Week and Space Technology magazine.

Delta Air Lines acquired the company on March 22, 1999, increasing its stake in Atlantic Southeast Airlines from 28% to 100%, and operations began on May 11 of that year. In 2000, Comair, a Delta Connection partner, joined ASA in announcing industry&#x27;s largest regional jet order. Also in 2000, ASA went international with flights to Toronto, Canada, from Atlanta.

In 2001, President Skip Barnette was named Regional Airline Executive of the year by the 2000 Commuter/Regional Airline News. Near the end of 2001, ASA carried the 2002 Olympic Flame between Miami, Florida, and Mobile, Alabama, as part of Delta&#x27;s sponsorship of the 2002 Winter Olympic Games in Salt Lake City, Utah.

In 2002, ASA received and began using its first Delta Connection 70-seat Canadair (now Bombardier) CRJ700 aircraft. All previous CRJs were CRJ200 models, which only offered 50 seats. Also in 2002, ASA began service to its 100th airport: Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Cincinnati, Ohio. By June 2003, ASA had received its 100th CRJ. In 2004, a special-edition CRJ700 was delivered to ASA to celebrate its 25th anniversary of passenger service.

On August 15, 2005, Delta announced that it had entered into an agreement to sell ASA to SkyWest, Inc. for $425 million, and on September 8, 2005, SkyWest announced that the acquisition had been completed, and that the code shares and flying would commence that night.

Shortly after the completion of the purchase by SkyWest, Inc. the decision was made to close ASA&#x27;s Salt Lake City hub and transfer 12 of ASA&#x27;s CRJ700s to SkyWest Airlines. Eventually only 4 of the 12 airplanes were transferred between the certificates. SkyWest Airlines also took delivery of the remainder of ASA&#x27;s regional jet orders, as 5 additional CRJ700s and 17 CRJ900s. 

On June 1, 2006, ASA filed with the US Department of Transportation for an exemption to begin service from Los Angeles International Airport to nine Mexican destinations under the Delta Connection brand. This service is contingent on US as well as Mexican government approvals. ASA also announced the opening of a Los Angeles crew base on December 1, 2006, to support the expanded west coast operations. ASA began operations at its new Los Angeles focus city on December 15, 2006.

On December 20, 2006, Skywest Inc. announced that 8 Comair CRJ700 aircraft would be transferred to Atlantic Southeast Airlines and operated out of Delta&#x27;s Cincinnati hub beginning in January 2007. This followed a request for proposal put out by Delta Air Lines aiming to reduce costs of its Delta Connection service.

On December 30, 2008, Delta announced that 10 CRJ900 aircraft would be allocated to Atlantic Southeast Airlines beginning in April 2009. Eight aircraft will be delivered from the factory and two already in service with Pinnacle Airlines will be transferred to ASA. As part of the fleet enhancement, 20 CRJ200 aircraft were removed from ASA&#x27;s Delta Connection Agreement beginning in June 2010.

ASA had the lowest rate of on-time performance, and the worst rate of mishandled baggage among all 19 US air carriers reporting to the US Department of Transportation for the full-year 2006. ASA&#x27;s baggage handling performance improved slightly in 2007, but they once again ranked last out of all 20 reporting carriers for on-time performance. ASA is not directly responsible for the mishandled baggage problems since ASA baggage is handled by Delta Air Lines. Under former CEO Brad Holt&#x27;s new leadership, on-time performance steadily improved, with full recoveries in markets such as Montgomery, Alabama, where ASA was honored for exceeding the city&#x27;s expectation in improving performance.

After over five years of contentious negotiations with the Air Line Pilots Association, a new three-year agreement was reached in late September 2007 with ASA&#x27;s 1800 pilots. ASA&#x27;s Flight Attendants represented by the Association of Flight Attendants reached a contract agreement as of August 2008. 

On May 21, 2010, Atlantic Southeast unveiled a new brand (top of page on right), moving away from &quot;ASA,&quot; and a new vision.

In August 2010, SkyWest announced that it had entered into a definitive merger agreement with ExpressJet Holdings, whereby Atlantic Southeast, as SkyWest&#x27;s wholly owned subsidiary, will purchase ExpressJet for $6.75 per share. Day one of the combined airlines was Friday, November 12, 2010. The combined airline will be based in Atlanta. At the time ExpressJet operated as Continental Express and United Express. The airline expected to be operating under one certificate 4th quarter of 2011.

On July 13, 2011, Atlantic Southeast announced that it would change its name to &quot;SureJet&quot; after completion of its merger with ExpressJet. However, the reaction of employee groups at both airlines was so negative that the new name was put on hold less than 24 hours after being announced. Brand information and press releases pertaining to &quot;SureJet&quot; were removed from Atlantic Southeast&#x27;s public and employee websites and the company&#x27;s combined identity was reconsidered. On October 14, 2011, the company announced that Atlantic Southeast&#x27;s official company name would change to ExpressJet Airlines on December 31, 2011. 
 On November 22, 2011, both Atlantic Southeast and ExpressJet gained approval from the FAA for a single operating certificate that would allow them to operate as a single carrier under the ExpressJet name making ExpressJet the largest regional airline in the world with more than 400 aircraft.

== Fleet ==
As of January 2011, the Atlantic Southeast Airlines fleet consisted of the following aircraft with an average age of 8.4 years:
Most CRJ aircraft were operated for Delta Connection, though 14 CRJ-200 aircraft were operated for United Express.

=== Previous aircraft ===

Embraer Brasilia aircraft were retired from service in 2003, and aircraft that have not been sold are in storage at Hot Springs, Arkansas. The airline operated the following aircraft types at various times during its existence:
*19 - ATR 72-210
*6 - BAe 146-200 (&quot;first jet aircraft type operated by ASA&quot;)
*2 - de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter
*5 - de Havilland Canada Dash 7
*13 - Embraer EMB-110
*67 - Embraer EMB-120
*10 - Short 360

==Corporate affairs==

===Corporate headquarters===

Before the merger, it headquartered in the A-Tech Center in College Park, Georgia, The City of Atlanta owns the facility, which now houses the Atlanta Police Department Helicopter Unit.

In December 2007 the airline announced it was moving its headquarters into the A-Tech facility, a hangar at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport previously named the &quot;North Hangar.&quot; The hangar includes of hangar bays for aircraft maintenance. It has of adjacent land and 1,400 parking spaces for employees. The airline planned to relocate 100 employees from Macon, Georgia, to the new headquarters. The Atlanta City Council and Mayor of Atlanta Shirley Franklin approved of the new 25-year ASA lease, which also gave the airline new hangar space to work on 15 to 25 aircraft in overnight maintenance; previously its aircraft were serviced at Concourse C. The airport property division stated that the hangar was built in the 1960s and renovated in the 1970s. Eastern Airlines and Delta Air Lines had previously occupied the hangar. Delta&#x27;s lease originally was scheduled to expire in 2010, but the airline returned the lease to the City of Atlanta in 2005 as part of its bankruptcy settlement. The city collected an insurance settlement of almost $900,000 as a result of the cancellation.

The airline had its headquarters in Greater Atlanta for a 26-year span until December 2007. In 1985 Atlantic Southeast Airlines was headquartered in what is now College Park.
In 1995 ASA was headquartered in a building in the Atlanta City limits. Prior to the headquarters move to the hangar, the ASA headquarters were in of space in the 100 Hartsfield Centre Parkway building, now named One Hartsfield Centre. That building is also in College Park, near Hartsfield Airport. ASA had occupied Suite 800. The airline announced it was moving to the A-Tech Center as its lease was expiring at 100 Hartsfield Centre Parkway.

<text>SkyWest Airlines is an American regional airline headquartered in St. George, Utah. SkyWest operates and maintains aircraft used on flights that are scheduled, marketed and sold by four partner mainline airlines. The company is contracted by Alaska Airlines (as Alaska SkyWest), American Airlines (as American Eagle), Delta Air Lines (as Delta Connection), and United Airlines (as United Express). In all, it is the largest regional airline in North America when measured by fleet size, number of passengers carried, and number of destinations served.

SkyWest operates from 258 cities in the United States, Canada and Mexico with an extensive network of routes largely set up to connect passengers between smaller airports and the large hubs of its partner airlines. In total, SkyWest carried 38.6 million passengers in 2023.

In 2024, the company operated an average of 2,190 flights per day, of which approximately 890 (41%) were United Express flights, 700 (32%) were Delta Connection flights, 380 (17%) were American Eagle flights, and 220 (10%) were Alaska Airlines flights.

== History ==
Frustrated by the limited extent of existing air service, Ralph Atkin, a St. George, Utah, lawyer, purchased Dixie Airlines on April 26, 1972, to shuttle businessmen to Salt Lake City. After early struggles, SkyWest began a steady expansion across the western U.S. It became the eleventh largest regional carrier in 1984 when it acquired Sun Aire Lines of Palm Springs, California, and had its initial public offering in 1986.

In early 1986, SkyWest began codesharing as Western Express, a feeder service for Western Airlines at its Salt Lake City hub and other mainline Western destinations utilizing Embraer EMB 120 and Fairchild Metroliner turboprop aircraft. Following the acquisition and merger of Western by Delta Air Lines in 1987, SkyWest then became a Delta Connection air carrier with codeshare service being flown on behalf of Delta to destinations in Arizona, California, Colorado, Montana, Nevada, Utah and Wyoming.

From 1995 through 1997, SkyWest operated codeshare service for Continental Airlines as Continental Connection on flights out of Los Angeles that were also operated as Delta Connection.

In 1997, SkyWest began operating as United Express in addition to Delta Connection on flights out of United Airlines hubs at SFO, LAX and DEN. SkyWest became United&#x27;s largest United Express operation by the late 1990s. Flights were initially operated with Embraer EMB 120s and Bombardier CRJ200 regional jets. CRJ700s were added in the early 2000s and the Embraer 175 were added in 2014.

A partnership with Continental was revived in 2003 as Continental Connection out of George Bush Intercontinental Airport in Houston but was discontinued in June 2005. This operation used Embraer EMB 120s.

On August 15, 2005, Delta sold Atlantic Southeast Airlines to the newly incorporated SkyWest, Inc., for $425 million in cash. The acquisition was completed on September 8, 2005.

In 2007, SkyWest began code sharing with Midwest Airlines at its hubs in Milwaukee and Kansas City using Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft. In 2010 the codeshare with Midwest had ended, and a new codeshare agreement began with AirTran Airways at Milwaukee. On September 6, 2011, AirTran Airways ended its codesharing and partnership with SkyWest. Shortly after, SkyWest began a codesharing agreement with US Airways to operate CRJ200 aircraft from US Airways&#x27; hub in Phoenix, Arizona.

On August 4, 2010, SkyWest, Inc., announced that it planned to acquire ExpressJet and merge it with SkyWest subsidiary Atlantic Southeast Airlines in a deal reported to have a value of $133 million. The purchase aligned the largest commuter operations of United Airlines and Continental Airlines, who were in a merger process, and was approved on September 13, 2010, by the Federal Trade Commission.

In May 2011, SkyWest replaced Horizon Air on six routes on the West Coast being operated for Alaska Airlines. The flights were based out of Seattle and Portland and flew to several California cities, including Fresno, Burbank, Santa Barbara and Ontario. Horizon Air had been operating these routes with Bombardier CRJ700 aircraft however Horizon retired this aircraft from its fleet. Alaska Airlines had a similar agreement with PenAir for Alaskan flights and Horizon Air for flights in the lower 48.

On November 15, 2012, SkyWest began a capacity purchase agreement with American Airlines for 12 Bombardier CRJ200 aircraft operating as American Eagle from American&#x27;s hub in Los Angeles, California. This codeshare agreement with American was greatly expanded over the next several years to include destinations from American&#x27;s hubs at Chicago, Dallas/Fort Worth, and Phoenix. Larger CRJ700/900 aircraft were introduced to the American Eagle system in 2016, and the smaller CRJ200s were discontinued in 2020. Embraer 175 aircraft joined the American Eagle system in late 2021.

On September 6, 2017, SkyWest Airlines reported that it has entered into aircraft purchase agreements and capacity purchase agreements to acquire and fly 15 new aircraft with Delta Air Lines and 10 new aircraft with Alaska Airlines. Of the 25 aircraft, 15 Embraer 175SC aircraft will fly under an agreement with Delta in a 70-seat configuration. The Embraer 175SC is built on the same airframe as other Embraer 175 aircraft and can be retrofitted to 76 seats in the future. The agreement with Alaska includes 10 Embraer 175 aircraft which will be configured with 76 seats, similar to aircraft SkyWest has previously placed into service with Alaska. Expected delivery dates of the 25 aircraft run from March 2018 through the end of 2018.

On December 18, 2018, SkyWest, Inc., announced that it would sell ExpressJet Airlines to another airline holding company with ties to United Airlines, ExpressJet&#x27;s sole client. The $70 million sale closed on January 23, 2019.

In early 2024, regional carrier SkyWest Airlines purchased a 25% ownership stake of Contour Airlines to gain access to its infrastructure, personnel, and operational expertise as it launches its own Part 135 operation. SkyWest also plans to supply Contour with CRJ200 aircraft and partner with the airline to both recruit young pilots and provide opportunities to pilots who would otherwise need to retire due to age.

In March 2024, SkyWest Airlines signed a deal with United Airlines to operate an additional 20 Embraer 175 aircraft for United Express. Unlike other aircraft, these are financed by United Airlines, not SkyWest.

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Ownership and structure ===
SkyWest is owned by SkyWest, Inc., an airline holding company. SkyWest also provides contract ground handling services at airports across the United States.

=== Business model ===
The vast majority of SkyWest&#x27;s contracts are fixed-fee, with partner airlines paying a set amount for each flight operated, regardless of the number of passengers carried. The remaining 7% of flights are operated under a pro-rate contract, with SkyWest assuming all costs, setting fares, retaining all revenue from non-connecting passengers, and splitting the fares of connecting passengers on a pro-rated basis with the partner airline. SkyWest currently operates on a pro-rate basis on 68 routes across 10 hubs through agreements with American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.

As of early 2021, SkyWest operates in 50 smaller cities that are subsidized under the federal government&#x27;s Essential Air Service program. 36 are served under the United Express brand and 14 under the Delta Connection brand. The state of Wyoming subsidizes service to four other airports in Wyoming and operates under the United Express brand. All subsidized routes are flown with Bombardier CRJ200 regional jets.

=== Business trends ===
Performance figures for SkyWest Airlines are fully incorporated into the accounts of its parent company, SkyWest, Inc.

== Fleet ==

=== Current fleet ===
SkyWest has the largest fleet of any regional airline in the United States. Since 2015, the airline has exclusively operated jet aircraft. Most SkyWest aircraft are painted in the livery of partner carriers, but SkyWest does have a small number of aircraft in its own livery that can be operated for any partner airline as needed.

SkyWest is a major operator of the Bombardier CRJ family of regional jets, was the launch customer for CRJ200, is largest operator of the CRJ200 and took delivery of the last CRJ ever built, a CRJ900.

Like most regional airlines in the United States, SkyWest is subject to scope clause requirements of its mainline carrier partners and their pilot unions; those requirements limit the size of the aircraft flown by a regional airline, measured in seat capacity.

, the SkyWest Airlines fleet consists of the following aircraft:

Note: the above chart only shows aircraft in scheduled service. It does not include aircraft owned by SkyWest but that are: leased to other operators, removed from service, transitioning between agreements with partners, used as spares, parked, or in the process of being parted out.

=== Historical fleet ===
SkyWest previously operated Embraer EMB 120 turboprop aircraft until 2015. The airline also operated Fairchild Metroliner turboprops. In 1984, SkyWest was operating the largest Metro propjet fleet in the world with 26 aircraft, and by 1991 the Metro fleet had grown to 35 aircraft with 15 Brasilia propjets also being operated. By 1994, the first jet, a Bombardier CRJ100, was added to the fleet and by 1996 all of the Metro propjets had been retired as they were progressively replaced with Brasilia aircraft. SkyWest was also the launch customer for the CRJ200 regional jet.

According to the airline&#x27;s website, at its inception SkyWest was operating all flights in the early 1970s with small propeller-driven, piston-engine aircraft, including:

* Piper Cherokee 140 – two passenger seats
* Piper Cherokee Arrow – four passenger seats
* Piper Cherokee Six – six passenger seats
* Piper Navajo – eight passenger seats
* Piper Navajo Chieftain – nine passenger seats

== Lawsuits ==
In October 2023, SkyWest was sued by the Association of Flight Attendants (AFA-CWA), who alleged that the company illegally fired two flight attendants as retaliation for engaging in protected union organizing activities and that the company illegally stood up a company union in violation of the Railway Labor Act.

In July 2024, the US Department of Labor also sued SkyWest, alleging that company financially supported and controlled the SkyWest Inflight Association (SIA) as a company union, and that the SIA under SkyWest&#x27;s control failed to perform its duties as a representative agency and illegally barred two employees from running for leadership positions due to their support for an independent labor union.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* January 15, 1987: SkyWest Airlines Flight 1834, a Fairchild Metroliner, collided with a Mooney M20 transporting an instructor and a student, while on a flight between Pocatello, Idaho, and Salt Lake City, in the vicinity of Kearns, Utah. All ten aboard both planes, eight on Flight 1834 and two in the Mooney, were killed. The accident was found to be a navigation error of the student pilot aboard the Mooney.
* January 15, 1990: SkyWest Airlines Flight 5855, a Fairchild Metroliner, collided with terrain during an instrument approach to Elko, Nevada. There were four serious and nine minor injuries, but no fatalities. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and was written off.
* February 1, 1991: SkyWest Airlines Flight 5569, a Fairchild Metroliner, was awaiting departure clearance on an active runway at Los Angeles International Airport for a scheduled flight to Palmdale when USAir Flight 1493, a Boeing 737-300 arriving from Columbus, Ohio, collided with it while it was landing. SkyWest 5569 was directed hold on runway 24L, one minute later, US1493 was cleared to land on 24L by the same controller. The 737 landed on the SkyWest aircraft. The two planes slid down the runway, then off to the side, coming to rest against an unoccupied firehouse, and burst into flames. All twelve on the SkyWest aircraft were killed (ten passengers and two pilots), and 22 of the 89 aboard the 737 died (20 passengers, one pilot, and one flight attendant). The cause was found to be air traffic controller error.
* May 26, 2007: SkyWest Airlines Flight 5741, an Embraer EMB 120, was involved in a serious runway incursion when the plane nearly collided with Republic Airways Flight 4912, an Embraer 170, on intersecting runways at San Francisco International Airport. There were no reported injuries to passengers and no reported damage to either aircraft. The cause was found to be air traffic controller error.
*July 17, 2012: A suspended SkyWest Airlines pilot, Brian Hedgelin, under investigation by police for the recent fatal stabbing of a woman at his Colorado Springs residence, stole a SkyWest CRJ200 at St. George Regional Airport in Utah. The aircraft was out of service at the time with no other passengers or crew on board. After apparently scaling the airport perimeter fence, Hedgelin started the aircraft and attempted to taxi from the gate but clipped a jet bridge and the terminal building, damaging the left wing and causing a fuel leak; he then taxied the aircraft through a fence and into a parking lot, striking several parked cars in the process. Hedgelin fatally shot himself in the aircraft aisle. The stolen aircraft, Canadair CRJ200ER &quot;N865AS&quot;, was damaged beyond repair and written off.

<text>Continental Connection was the brand name under which several commuter airline carriers and their holding companies operated services marketed exclusively by Continental Airlines. As such, all Continental Connection banner carrier services were operated primarily with turboprop aircraft in contrast to Continental Express, whose flights were operated by Continental&#x27;s regional jet partners, ExpressJet and Chautauqua Airlines. Continental Connection operations were merged into Continental Express in 2012.

According to the Official Airline Guide, earlier Continental Express flights, such as those operated by Royale Airlines followed by Britt Airways from the Continental hub at Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH), were operated with such turboprop aircraft as the ATR 42, Embraer EMB 110, Embraer EMB 120, and Grumman Gulfstream I during the 1980s.

All flights operated by Continental Connection carriers were given full OnePass frequent-flyer credit, as if they were mainline Continental flights.

The &quot;Continental Connection&quot; name was discontinued and the operation adopted United Airlines&#x27; existing United Express branding following the merger of Continental Airlines with United in 2010.

* On September 7, 2011, Colgan Air Flight 3222, with 23 passengers en route from Houston, TX to Lake Charles, LA landed at Southland Field, which was not their scheduled destination. The crew was subsequently relieved of duty.

<text>Silver Airways is a regional airline in the United States with its headquarters in Hollywood, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale. It was founded in 2011 with assets from the former Gulfstream International Airlines, and currently operates scheduled flights from its hubs in Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and Tampa, Florida, as well as San Juan, Puerto Rico. The airline started flying on December 15, 2011.

 Silver Airways received $20,515,042 in annual federal subsidies for Essential Air Services that it provided to rural airports in the United States.
== History ==
On November 4, 2010, Gulfstream International Airlines filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection. In May 2011, Victory Park Capital bought the assets of Gulfstream International Group, including 21 of Gulfstream&#x27;s Beechcraft 1900D aircraft, from Raytheon Aircraft Credit Corporation. The company had been operating as Continental Connection on behalf of Continental Airlines.
On December 15, 2011, the airline was rebranded as Silver Airways. That same day, they took delivery of one of six recently purchased Saab 340 aircraft. Upon the merger of Continental Airlines into United Airlines on April 1, 2012, Silver operated as United Express until the affiliation with United ended in July 2013.

In the first half of 2012, Silver Airways made several moves to turn itself around. Its maintenance facilities were moved from Fort Lauderdale to Gainesville Regional Airport, taking over the former Eclipse Aviation facility that had remained vacant since 2009. It purchased six more Saab 340 aircraft bringing the Saab fleet to 12. Scheduled service on the Saabs started on the Florida and Bahamas routes. Shortly after, routes were added from Gainesville Regional Airport to Orlando International Airport and Tampa International Airport began.

Silver Airways expanded its network numerous times in the second half of 2012. First, Washington Dulles International Airport saw scheduled service to destinations in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Virginia. Silver&#x27;s Florida route network expanded to Jacksonville. Service began from Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport to destinations in Mississippi and Alabama. On August 7, 2012, Silver Airways made national news headlines when one of its flights landed at the wrong airport.

In late 2011, Silver Airways began a new operation in Montana, serving eight cities from a hub at Billings. Seven of the eight cities were served through government subsidies by way of Essential Air Service contracts. The Montana operation lasted for two years, ending by mid-2013.

On February 11, 2013, Victory Park Capital announced it had hired industry veteran Dave Pflieger to strengthen and grow the airline. On June 28, 2013, Silver Airways announced that it would cease Montana operations over the next few months. The announcement came on the heels of the Department of Transportation&#x27;s (DOT) decision to eliminate subsidized service in two key Montana communities, Lewistown and Miles City. Service ended after the last flights on July 15, 2013, for Lewistown and Miles City. To ensure no interruption of service and a smooth transition for the flying public in the remaining Montana markets serviced by Silver Airways, Silver continued its operations in those communities until such time as the DOT awarded the routes to another airline and the new carrier started service to those communities.

In September 2013, Silver Airways announced an expansion of its intra-Florida and Florida–Bahamas network. In 2013, Silver Airways was named one of the Top 10 Best U.S. Airlines in the Condé Nast Traveler&#x27;s 26th annual Readers&#x27; Choice Awards.

In the first half of 2014, Silver Airways made several network changes. It ended Beechcraft 1900 operations in Cleveland&#x27;s EAS network. Then, Silver Airways closed much of its Atlanta network and redeployed its aircraft to other markets. In February 2014, the airline and its owners, Victory Park Capital, announced they had obtained up to $73 million in additional financing from GB Credit Partners, LLC, the investment management affiliate of Gordon Brothers Group and Crystal Financial LLC. Plans were also made to strengthen its core network and Saab 340B+ fleet. In March 2014, Silver Airways completed its first ever IATA Operational Safety Audit (IOSA).

In May 2014, Silver announced a new partnership with JetBlue. In May 2014, Silver Airways announced it was a new stand-alone airline after the launch of its own independent reservations system. CEO Dave Pflieger described the airline as a hybrid carrier, part start-up, part turnaround, both independent, and a partner to a larger airline (United). He also noted that it was &quot;rationalizing&quot; its fleet and network and &quot;only flying where it makes sense,&quot; so the airline could not only meet but exceed guests&#x27; expectations and continue to grow the airline.

In January 2015, Silver Airways added Panama City, Florida, to its list of destinations by starting services to Orlando and Tampa from the Northwest Florida Beaches International Airport. It also announced the launch of a direct service between Jacksonville and Tampa.

On February 27, 2015, Silver Airways previewed its new maintenance headquarters at Orlando International Airport. The project is a complete renovation that is home to a maintenance, repair and overhaul facility that includes two large aircraft hangars, each capable of housing three to four aircraft, as well as office space. Silver Airways has committed to a long-term 30-year lease from the Greater Orlando Aviation Authority to headquarter its new maintenance facility in Orlando. In August 2015, Silver Airways ended its Gainesville service, several months after missing and restructuring payments on its Gainesville maintenance hangar.

On March 2, 2016, Silver Airways filed an application with the U.S. Department of Transportation to provide service from five Florida cities to ten Cuban cities. However, later, Silver Airways was only granted nine Cuban cities, being denied a Havana route.

On June 2, 2016, Silver Airways, Great Lakes Airlines and Frontier Airlines announced a partnership for recruiting pilots. On September 13, 2016, it was announced that a majority stake of Silver Airways has been acquired by a private equity firm Versa Capital Management LLC in Philadelphia. On August 1, 2017, Silver Airways announced an order for 20 ATR 42-600 aircraft, with options for up to 30 more.

On April 23, 2018, Silver Airways announced the acquisition of Seaborne Airlines, a San Juan–based airline serving the Caribbean. In November 2019, Silver Airways created a codeshare partnership with Delta Air Lines and American Airlines to provide single ticket booking with baggage transfers to destinations in the Caribbean.

In February 2020, Silver Airways announced new services to Charleston International Airport from its hubs in Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and Tampa; however, due to the COVID-19 pandemic and its impacts on aviation, the services were initially postponed until November 2020, when service was finally started.

In March 2020, Silver announced the introduction of its own services to its San Juan base previously acquired along with its subsidiary Seaborne Airlines, with routes from San Juan launching in phases between March and July 2020 as more of the airline&#x27;s ATR 42-600 aircraft would be delivered.

On November 9, 2021, Silver Airways began contract flying for Amazon Air with feeder flights from Albuquerque and Des Moines to Amazon&#x27;s hub at the Fort Worth Alliance Airport near Fort Worth, Texas. Silver is using two ATR 72-500 aircraft configured for airfreight operations and painted with Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Prime Air&quot; logo. However, Amazon cut ties with Silver in July 2023, ending the airline&#x27;s cargo services.

On December 30, 2024, Silver Airways filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. The company expects to continue operations throughout the procedure with plans to exit bankruptcy by the first quarter of 2025.

== Facilities ==
The airline headquarters are located at 2850 Greene Street, Hollywood, FL 33020, in unincorporated Broward County, Florida, near Fort Lauderdale. Previously its headquarters were in Dania Beach, Florida, also near Fort Lauderdale. The airline also maintains a maintenance facility at Orlando International Airport in a facility previously utilized by Comair.
In April 2023, the company faced eviction from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport for failure to pay rent since 2021.

== Destinations ==
Over its history, Silver Airways has domestically operated both scheduled commercial flights originating from its Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, and Tampa hubs in Florida, as well as Essential Air Services based in Atlanta (Georgia), Billings (Montana), Boston (Massachusetts), Cleveland (Ohio), and Washington, D.C. Internationally, the airline operates services between Florida and the Bahamas, and in March 2020 began its own operations based in San Juan (Puerto Rico) to surrounding destinations in the Caribbean, alongside those of its subsidiary Seaborne Airlines.

The following table lists destinations served by the airline :

<doc id="266875" wikidata="Q528492" url="?curid=266875" title="CommuteAir">
<text>CommuteAir is a regional airline of the United States founded in 1989. Today, CommuteAir operates more than 1,600 weekly flights, exclusively on behalf of United Express, serving over 75 U.S. destinations and 3 in Mexico. CommuteAir&#x27;s fleet of Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft fly from its bases at Washington–Dulles and Houston–Intercontinental. The company was previously called CommutAir until July 26, 2022, when it legally changed its name to the present-day CommuteAir.

== History ==

The airline was established in 1989, with headquarters at Clinton County Airport in Plattsburgh, New York. Operations began on August 1, 1989, as a marketing affiliate of USAir.

The airline changed affiliations to Continental Airlines in January 2000, when US Airways and CommuteAir failed to reach a mutually acceptable extension agreement, and CommuteAir decided not to renew the codeshare agreement. In July 2001, the company announced plans to downsize its fleet and workforce by approximately half and change the route structure of the airline. In early 2002, the company began a &quot;micro-hub&quot; operation based in Albany, New York. At its high point in 2003 and 2004, the hub served 21 cities within the Northeast and Canada with a fleet of Beechcraft 1900s. Service was also provided out of Boston&#x27;s Logan International Airport to several Northeast cities.

In January 2003, CommuteAir announced an agreement with Continental to feed the latter&#x27;s Cleveland, Ohio hub. Service commenced on March 16, 2003, serving Kalamazoo, Michigan and Elmira, New York. Two cities were added the following month and by August 2003, CommuteAir served 12 cities from the Cleveland hub.

CommuteAir leased sixteen Bombardier Q200 aircraft from Horizon Air in 2006. The following year, the Beech 1900s were phased out.

On October 30, 2007, the company moved all remaining operations from Clinton County Airport, due to the closure of the airport. All operations were then conducted out of Cleveland Hopkins International Airport.

On October 2, 2008, the company began operations out of Newark Liberty International Airport, following Continental Airlines plan to adjust to the softening industry.

CommuteAir&#x27;s pilot group voted for union representation by the Air Line Pilots Association in 2008. That same year, Continental Airlines announced that it would cut flights and more than 3,000 jobs. Subsequently, it was announced that some of CommuteAir&#x27;s Cleveland flights would be eliminated as part of Continental&#x27;s cutbacks.

In 2010, following the merger of United and Continental, CommuteAir became a United Express carrier and United Airlines asked CommuteAir to obtain five Bombardier Q300s. Two of the aircraft were allocated to Cleveland services and three aircraft were allocated to Newark services.

In 2012, CommuteAir opened a hub at Washington-Dulles International Airport.

In July 2014, CommuteAir closed its pilot base at Cleveland Hopkins International Airport, after United Airlines withdrew its Cleveland hub. CommuteAir also closed its Cleveland maintenance base, and replaced it with a new maintenance base in Albany, New York.

On November 9, 2015, CommuteAir announced that it has reached an agreement with United Airlines to significantly increase the number of airplanes flown under the United Express brand by adding Embraer ERJ 145 jet operations to the company&#x27;s existing fleet of Bombardier turbo-prop aircraft.

In July 2016, CommuteAir began commercial service with its inaugural flight on the ERJ 145 jet from Washington, D.C. to Columbia, SC.

In September 2017, the Q300 was phased out and in January 2018, the Q200 was phased out, marking the end of turbo-prop operations.

On July 30, 2020, it was announced that United Airlines had decided to end its contract with fellow United Express affiliate ExpressJet and transferred these operations to CommuteAir. CommuteAir became the sole operator of the United Express ERJ 145 fleet.

On September 30, 2020, CommuteAir started servicing United&#x27;s Houston hub and on March 28, 2021, it began service out of Denver International Airport. The latter marks the return of the ERJ 145 to the Denver United Express fleet since COVID and the cessation of operations by Trans States Airlines. CommuteAir operated its final flights from Denver in May 2024 before closing its pilot and flight attendant bases and consolidating its operations in Houston and Washington-Dulles.

On January 19, 2023, hacker maia arson crimew announced she had compromised web servers belonging to CommuteAir and obtained access to flight and personnel scheduling systems, the personal data of airline staff, and a 2019 copy of the US Government No Fly List.

CommuteAir operated the final turboprop flight for United Express on Sunday, January 7, 2018.

This flight, UCA4909/C54909 between Syracuse Airport and Dulles Airport was operated by tail number N363PH. It marked the end of an era for both CommuteAir and United Express. The Bombardier DHC-8-200 was subsequently ferried to Roswell International Air Center for retirement.

== Incidents and accidents ==
=== CommutAir Flight 4821 ===

On January 3, 1992, CommutAir Flight 4821, a Beechcraft 1900C operating for USAir Express was flying from Plattsburgh, New York to Newark, New Jersey, with stops in Saranac Lake and Albany in New York, crashed into a wooded mountaintop as it was landing at Adirondack Regional Airport. Of the four people on board (two passengers and two crew), two were killed while the other two sustained serious injuries.

The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error in establishing a stabilized approach and cross-checking instruments. Factors related to the accident were: weather conditions and possible precipitation static interference, caused by inadequate grounding between the radome and fuselage that could have resulted in unreliable glide slope indications.&quot;

=== CommutAir Flight 4933 ===

On March 4, 2019, CommutAir Flight 4933, operating for United Express, landed off the runway during its second attempt at landing in Presque Isle International Airport. The left main landing gear was torn from the aircraft and embedded in one of the two rear engines. The accident resulted in a loss of the airframe. Passengers and crew were evacuated, with three passengers and one crew member requiring treatment for minor injuries.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed the accident to confirmation bias which prompted the pilots to continue descending even though they could not see the runway due to snow. Contributing factors were poor decision-making by the captain, fatigue of the first officer, and misalignment of the localizer caused by snow. The NTSB criticized the airline&#x27;s training practices, as the captain had been promoted to that status despite a history of training failures and disciplinary action. The NTSB also noted that at least six CommutAir flight crews had noticed the localizer misalignment prior to the accident but none had reported it under the airline&#x27;s safety program until after the event; one CommuteAir crew had reported the problem to the Federal Aviation Administration beforehand, but the agency did not issue a NOTAM because protocol dictated that more than one report was required.

<text>Cleveland State University (CSU) is a public research university in Cleveland, Ohio, United States. It was established in 1964 and opened for classes in 1965 after acquiring the entirety of Fenn College, a private school that had been in operation since 1923. CSU absorbed the Cleveland-Marshall School of Law in 1969. Today it is part of the University System of Ohio, has more than 120,000 alumni, and offers over 200 academic programs amongst eight colleges. It is classified among &quot;R2: Doctoral Universities – High research activity&quot;.

==History==
Public education in Cleveland was first started in 1870, when Cleveland YMCA began to offer free classes. By 1921, the program had grown enough to become separate from YMCA, being renamed Cleveland YMCA School of Technology. Two years later, the school offered courses towards a bachelor&#x27;s degree for the first time. This is now regarded as Fenn College&#x27;s founding date, although the college would not be formally renamed until 1929. Fenn College took over several buildings in the area including Fenn Tower, Stilwell Hall, and Foster Hall.

In 1964, the State of Ohio purchased the entirety of Fenn College&#x27;s campus in downtown Cleveland and established a commuter college that targeted area residents. This new institution became known as Cleveland State University. The university consisted of the Fenn College of Engineering (now the Washkewicz College of Engineering), the colleges of business administration, arts and sciences, and education. Industrialist James J. Nance served as Chair of the first Board of Trustees.

Over the next several decades, Cleveland State University quickly grew in size and claimed over 15,000 students in 1997. However, only six hundred students resided in university housing. In the mid-2000s, President Michael Schwartz ended open admissions and implemented a vision to move from a &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; fourth-tier university to a second-tier university. The university entered into a partnership with Northeast Ohio Medical University in 2008.

In 2012, CSU opened the Galleries At CSU on Euclid Avenue. Also in 2012, Cleveland State University partnered with the South China University of Technology allowing students to complete their education and receive joint degrees. In 2018, CSU established the CSU School of Film and Media Arts, having used a $7.5 million appropriation from the State of Ohio to renovate an entire floor of the IdeaStream Center at Playhouse Square. It is the first standalone film school in Ohio.

On March 11, 2020, an email was sent to Cleveland State students regarding the changes made due to the coronavirus pandemic. Classes were all switched to remote learning.

==Campus==

CSU&#x27;s main campus in downtown Cleveland is bounded on the east and west by Interstate 90 and East 17th Street, respectively; and by Payne Avenue to the north and Carnegie Avenue on the south. It also has a satellite campus in Westlake, Ohio, included in the Greater Cleveland area.

In 2006, Cleveland State University completed its student Recreation Center and a renovation of Parker Hannifan Hall for the College of Graduate Studies. To make the campus more amenable to residence and increase the number of students living on campus thousands of housing units were built, anchored by a new dormitory, Fenn Tower, a reuse of the school&#x27;s most historic building. Fenn Tower housed what was the world&#x27;s longest Foucault pendulum, but the pendulum was removed during the residence hall renovation in 2006 and is now in the Cleveland State University archives.

The university worked with private developers and the City of Cleveland to develop housing, retail, and &quot;collegetown&quot; amenities around Fenn Tower, particularly along the main thoroughfare of Euclid Avenue. In 2010, Euclid Avenue was upgraded as part of the Euclid Corridor Project which brought bus rapid transit to the university and connected Public Square in downtown Cleveland to University Circle, approximately four miles to the east. Cleveland State University&#x27;s $65 million construction project, intended to transform the campus from a mostly commuter school into a residential campus, included the new Student Center and Julka Hull, which houses the College of Education and School of Nursing. Both projects were finished in 2010. In 2011, the new Euclid Commons dorms complex, which features apartment-style living for CSU students, opened. That same year, the university&#x27;s Dramatic Arts Program moved into the renovated Middough Building and Allen Theatre at Playhouse Square Center in collaboration with the Cleveland Play House.

During the fall semester of 2012, the first phase of the private Langston apartment and retail complex opened along Chester Avenue across from Rhodes Tower. In the spring semester of 2013, the former Viking Hall dormitory was torn down to make way for the university&#x27;s new Center for Health Professions. This was opened in the fall of 2015. 

==Administration==
The Cleveland State University Board consists of nine trustees, a Secretary to the Board, two faculty representatives, and two student representatives. The board members, along with the University President, are charged with fulfilling the goals set forth in the University Mission Statement as well as acting as the governing body in all policy matters of the university requiring attention. In January 2006 the Board of Trustees amended their bylaws so they could restructure board committees as well as include Community members on the Board. Community members serve as non-voting advisers and are appointed by the Board Chairman for a term approved by the Board.

* Washkewicz College of Engineering

The Division of University Studies focuses on academic support services, and the Division of Continuing Education extends academic services beyond the campus.

The College of Law traces its origins to the founding of Cleveland Law School in 1897. One of the most famous alumni of the College of Law was Tim Russert, host of television program &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, who graduated in 1976. It was formerly known as the Cleveland–Marshall College of Law, until the school dropped Marshall&#x27;s name from the school in 2022.

The university is partnered with Northeast Ohio Medical University to train future healthcare professionals in urban settings. Undergraduate students at CSU can obtain early admission to medical school and obtain a certificate in urban health.

===Reputation and rankings===
In its 2025 rankings, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked the university&#x27;s undergraduate program 342nd (tied) among 436 national universities, and 183rd among public national universities. The Levin College of Public Affairs and Education was placed fourth in urban policy and 13th in the local government management in the 2019 &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranking of graduate public affairs programs.

===Research===
Cleveland State maintains a variety of research links within Ohio. These research collaborations include Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland MetroHealth Medical Center, Council for International Exchange of Scholars, NASA Glenn Research Center, Great Lakes Science Center, Cleveland Museum of Natural History, International Space University, Internet2, Ohio College of Podiatric Medicine, Ohio Department of Education, and the Ohio Supercomputer Center.

In 2022, &quot;The Chronicle of Higher Education&quot; reported on a researcher at Cleveland State University whose &quot;home institution was essentially providing a soapbox for racist pseudoscience.[...] Despite nearly a dozen publications over more than a decade arguing for the intellectual inferiority of Black people,&quot; the professor was judged to have meritorious research and was promoted and given tenure. In 2022 he was fired following an investigation by the National Institutes of Health that found that he had violated regulations concerning the handling of medical data.

==Student life==
===Student media===
The campus&#x27; student-run radio station, 89.3 WCSB, has a 630-Watt transmitter on top of Rhodes Tower (formerly called University Tower). Additionally, Cleveland State is served in print by The Cauldron, an independent student newspaper, The Cleveland Stater, a laboratory newspaper in the School of Communication, The Vindicator, Cleveland State University&#x27;s art and culture magazine, and The Gavel which won the 2005 American Bar Association&#x27;s -Student Division&#x27;s first prize for the best law school newspaper in the country. There is no student television station at this time, though the university offers a film production and video production major with courses through its Digital Video Communication Center and a variety of related majors through the School of Film and Media Arts.

===Information technology===
CSU is a member of the OneCommunity (formerly OneCleveland) computer network, an initiative of Case Western Reserve University that connects nonprofit institutions throughout Northeast Ohio, allowing large scale collaborations over a high-speed fiber optic network.

===Greek organizations===
Cleveland State University is home to 4 NIC fraternities, Delta Sigma Phi, Sigma Phi Epsilon, Sigma Tau Gamma, and Tau Kappa Epsilon. There are 3 NPC sororities, Delta Zeta, Phi Mu, and Theta Phi Alpha and all 9 NPHC organizations have a chapter affiliated with the campus.

==Athletics==
When the school was still known as Fenn College, the sports teams&#x27; nickname was the Foxes. When the university was renamed Cleveland State, the nickname changed as well, and CSU&#x27;s sports teams became the &quot;Vikings&quot;. That nickname stands to this day. The school colors are university green and fresh green. For many years the school mascot was the comic strip character Hägar the Horrible along with his wife Helga, and the couple appeared at sporting events as well as on University literature. A new mascot, &quot;Vike&quot; was introduced in 1997 and Hagar was phased out by 1998. Another new mascot named &quot;Magnus&quot; was introduced in August 2007.

Cleveland State fields varsity teams in 17 sports, with most teams competing in the Horizon League. The men&#x27;s basketball team was noteworthy in 1986 when seeded 14th in the East Region of the NCAA tournament, it upset heavily favored 3-seed Indiana and Saint Joseph&#x27;s before a one-point loss to a Navy team led by future Hall of Famer David Robinson, an unprecedented achievement for such a low seed. The Vikes made yet another NCAA tournament appearance in 2009, upsetting the highly favored 4 seed Wake Forest before falling to Arizona in the second round. The school fields two teams that compete outside the Horizon League; wrestling competes in the Mid-American Conference and men&#x27;s lacrosse in the ASUN Conference.

===Football===
On October 14, 2008, CSU President Michael Schwartz stated &quot;he wants a blue ribbon panel to give him a recommendation on the football team before July 1, 2009, when he was scheduled to retire. He also said the program will have to be structured to pay for itself.&quot; The establishment of a football team became an official item on the student government election ballot. Although over two-thirds of the voters favored establishment of a football team over half of them were not willing to pay a fee for Division I non-scholarship football in addition to any potential future tuition increases that may be instituted by the university.

<doc id="266887" wikidata="Q1048169" url="?curid=266887" title="Treaty of Berlin (1878)">
<text>The Treaty of Berlin (formally the Treaty between Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Great Britain and Ireland, Italy, Russia, and the Ottoman Empire for the Settlement of Affairs in the East) was signed on 13 July 1878. In the aftermath of the Russian victory against the Ottoman Empire in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877–1878, the major powers restructured the map of the Balkan region. They reversed some of the extreme gains claimed by Russia in the preliminary Treaty of San Stefano, but the Ottomans lost their major holdings in Europe. It was one of three major peace agreements in the period after the 1815 Congress of Vienna. It was the final act of the Congress of Berlin (13 June – 13 July 1878) and included the United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary, France, Germany, Italy, Russia and the Ottoman Empire. Chancellor of Germany Otto von Bismarck was the chairman and dominant personality.

The most important task of the Congress was to decide the fate of Bulgaria, but Bulgaria itself was excluded from participation in the talks, at Russian insistence. At the time, as it was not a sovereign state, Bulgaria was not a subject of international law, and the same went for the Bulgarians themselves. The exclusion was already an established fact in the great powers&#x27; Constantinople Conference, which had been held one year before without any Bulgarian participation.

The most notable result of the conference was the official recognition of the newly independent states of Romania, Serbia, and Montenegro (which had de facto been acting independently for decades). Furthermore, Russia regained access to the formerly demilitarised Black Sea region.

==Background==
The Paris Peace Treaty of 1856, which ended the Crimean War, had made the Black Sea a neutral territory. The treaty had protected the Ottoman Empire, ended the Holy Alliance (Austria, Prussia and Russia) and weakened Russia&#x27;s overall position. In 1870, Russia invoked the doctrine of &quot;rebus sic stantibus&quot; and effectively terminated the treaty by breaching provisions concerning the neutrality of the Black Sea. The great powers became increasingly convinced that the Ottoman Empire would not be able to hold its territories in Europe.

In 1875, the Herzegovina uprising resulted in the Great Eastern Crisis. As the conflict in the Balkans intensified, atrocities during the 1876 April Uprising in Bulgaria inflamed anti-Turkish sentiments in Russia and Britain, which eventually culminated in the Russo-Turkish War of 1877.

== Terms ==

The treaty formally recognized the independence of the &quot;de facto&quot; sovereign principalities of Romania, Serbia and Montenegro (plus their expansion) and the autonomy of Bulgaria although the latter &quot;de facto&quot; functioned independently and was divided into three parts: the Principality of Bulgaria, the autonomous province of Eastern Rumelia, and Macedonia, which was given back to the Ottomans, thus undoing Russian plans for an independent and Russophile &quot;Greater Bulgaria&quot;. The Treaty of San Stefano had created a Bulgarian state, which was just what Britain and Austria-Hungary feared the most.

The Treaty of Berlin confirmed most of the Russian gains from the Ottoman Empire specified in the Treaty of San Stefano, such as Batumi and Adjara, but the valley of Alashkerd and the town of Bayazid were returned to the Ottomans. The regions of Ardahan and Kars were also ceded to Russia. The 1879 Treaty of Constantinople was a further continuation of negotiations. It reaffirmed the provisions of the Treaty of San Stefano which had not been modified by the Berlin Treaty and established amounts of compensation that the Ottoman Empire owed to Russia for losses to businesses and institutions during the war. It granted amnesty to Ottoman subjects and for release of prisoners of war. In addition, Article VII of the treaty provided that in the territory acquired by Russia, subjects could choose whether they wished to be Ottoman or Russian subjects for a period of six months after the agreement became effective.

Despite the pleas of the Romanian delegates, Romania was forced to cede southern Bessarabia to the Russian Empire. As a compensation, Romania received Dobruja, including the Danube Delta. The treaty also limited the Russian occupation of Bulgaria to 9 months, which limited the time during which Russian troops and supplies could be moved through Romanian territory.

The three newly independent states subsequently proclaimed themselves kingdoms: Romania in 1881, Serbia in 1882 and Montenegro in 1910, and Bulgaria proclaimed full independence in 1908 after it had united with Eastern Rumelia in 1885. annexed Bosnia in 1908, sparking the Bosnian crisis, a major European crisis that reinforced alliances.

The Treaty of Berlin accorded special legal status to some religious groups and also would serve as a model for the Minority Treaties, which would be established within the framework of the League of Nations. It stipulated that Romania recognize non-Christians (Jews and Muslims) as full citizens. It also vaguely called for a border rectification between Greece and the Ottoman Empire, which occurred after protracted negotiations in 1881, with the transfer of Thessaly to Greece.

In the &quot;Salisbury Circular&quot; of 1 April, the Marquess of Salisbury, appointed foreign secretary the next day, made clear his own and his government&#x27;s objections to the Treaty of San Stefano and its favourable position of Russia. Historian A. J. P. Taylor wrote, &quot;If the congress was a defeat for Russia, it was not a complete success for Austria-Hungary or even for Great Britain... The Macedonian question haunted European diplomacy for a generation and then caused the Balkan war of 1912. Bosnia first provoked the crisis of 1908 and then exploded the World war in 1914, a war which brought down the Habsburg monarchy. If the treaty of San Stefano had been maintained, both the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary might have survived to the present day. The British, except for Beaconsfield in his wilder moments, had expected less and were, therefore, less disappointed. Salisbury wrote at the end of 1878: &#x27;We shall set up a rickety sort of Turkish rule again south of the Balkans. But it is a mere respite. There is no vitality left in them.

The Kosovo Vilayet remained part of the Ottoman Empire. Austria-Hungary was allowed to station military garrisons in the Ottoman Vilayet of Bosnia and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. The Vilayet of Bosnia was placed under Austro-Hungarian occupation although it formally remained part of the Ottoman Empire until it was annexed by Austria-Hungary thirty years later, on 5 October 1908. The Austro-Hungarian garrisons in the Sanjak of Novi Pazar were withdrawn in 1908, after the annexation of the Vilayet of Bosnia and the resulting Bosnian Crisis, to reach a compromise with the Ottoman Empire, which was struggling with internal strife because of the Young Turk Revolution (1908). The chaotic situation in the Ottoman Empire also allowed Bulgaria to formally declare its independence on 5 October 1908.

<text>The Austrian Empire, officially known as the Empire of Austria, was a multinational European great power from 1804 to 1867, created by proclamation out of the realms of the Habsburgs. During its existence, it was the third most populous monarchy in Europe after the Russian Empire and the United Kingdom, while geographically, it was the third-largest empire in Europe after the Russian Empire and the First French Empire.

The empire was proclaimed by Francis II in 1804 in response to Napoleon&#x27;s declaration of the First French Empire, unifying all Habsburg possessions under one central government. It remained part of the Holy Roman Empire until the latter&#x27;s dissolution in 1806. It continued fighting against Napoleon throughout the Napoleonic Wars, except for a period between 1809 and 1813, when Austria was first allied with Napoleon during the invasion of Russia and later neutral during the first few weeks of the Sixth Coalition War. Austria and its allies emerged victorious in the war, leading to the Congress of Vienna, which reaffirmed the empire as one of the great powers of the 19th century.

The Kingdom of Hungary—as Regnum Independens—was administered by its own institutions separately from the rest of the empire. After Austria was defeated in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 was adopted, joining the Kingdom of Hungary and the Empire of Austria to form Austria-Hungary.

==History==
===Foundation===

Changes shaping the nature of the Holy Roman Empire took place during conferences in Rastatt (1797–1799) and Regensburg (1801–1803). On 24 March 1803, the Imperial Recess () was declared, which reduced the number of ecclesiastical states from 81 to only 3 and the free imperial cities from 51 to 6. This measure was aimed at replacing the old constitution of the Holy Roman Empire, but the actual consequence of the Imperial Recess, along with the French occupying the Electorate of Hanover in the same month and various Holy Roman states becoming allied with or against France, was the end of the empire. Taking this significant change into consideration, Holy Roman Emperor Francis II created the title Emperor of Austria for himself and his successors, thereby becoming Francis I of Austria. This new title and state were created to safeguard his dynasty&#x27;s imperial status as he foresaw either the end of the Holy Roman Empire, or the eventual accession of Napoleon as Holy Roman Emperor, who had earlier that year adopted the title Emperor of the French and established the First French Empire. Initially Francis II/I continued to hold both titles but abdicated the throne of the Holy Roman Empire in 1806.

This new empire or &quot;&quot; () comprised all the lands of the Habsburg monarchy, which had until then been legally separate realms in personal union (a composite monarchy) under Francis and his predecessors. By contrast, the Austrian Empire was legally a single state, although the overarching structure and the status of its component lands at first stayed much the same as they had been under the composite monarchy. This was especially demonstrated by the status of the Kingdom of Hungary, a country that had never been a part of the Holy Roman Empire and which had always been considered a separate realm – a status that was affirmed by Article X, which was added to Hungary&#x27;s constitution in 1790 and described the state as a . Hungary&#x27;s affairs remained administered by its own institutions (King and Diet) as they had been beforehand; thus no Imperial institutions were involved in its government.

The fall and dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire was accelerated by French intervention in the Empire in September 1805. On 20 October 1805, an Austrian army led by General Karl Mack von Leiberich was defeated by French armies near the city of Ulm. The French victory resulted in the capture of 20,000 Austrian soldiers and many cannons. Napoleon&#x27;s army won another victory at Austerlitz on 2 December 1805. Francis was forced into negotiations with the French from 4 to 6 December 1805, which concluded with an armistice on 6 December 1805.

The French victories encouraged rulers of certain imperial territories to ally themselves with the French and assert their formal independence from the Empire. On 10 December 1805, Maximilian IV Joseph, the prince-elector and Duke of Bavaria, proclaimed himself king, followed by the Duke of Württemberg Frederick III on 11 December. Charles Frederick, Margrave of Baden, was given the title of Grand Duke on 12 December. Each of these new states became French allies.

Francis II agreed to the humiliating Treaty of Pressburg, signed in Pressburg (today Bratislava, Slovakia) on 26 December 1805, in which he recognised these new titles and ceded large amounts of territory to Napoleon&#x27;s German allies and the French Satellite Kingdom of Italy. In practice this meant the dissolution of the long-lived Holy Roman Empire and a reorganization under a Napoleonic model of the German states. Austrian claims on those German states were renounced without exception.

On 12 July 1806, the Confederation of the Rhine was established, comprising 16 sovereigns and countries. This confederation, under French influence, &quot;de facto&quot; put an end to the Holy Roman Empire. On 6 August 1806, Francis proclaimed the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire, as he did not want Napoleon to succeed him.

The dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire was not recognized by George III of the United Kingdom who was also the Elector of Hanover (formally Brunswick-Lüneburg) and Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg; Hanover and Lauenburg were incorporated into the French satellite Kingdom of Westphalia in 1807, having been occupied several times since 1801, but Britain remained at war with France and no treaty was signed recognising their annexation. His claims were later settled by the creation of the Kingdom of Hanover which was held by George IV and William IV as Kings of Hanover. Succession could only be in the male line, so on Queen Victoria&#x27;s accession to the British throne, her uncle, Ernest Augustus, succeeded as King of Hanover, thus ending the personal union with Great Britain that dated to 1714.

===Metternich era===
Klemens von Metternich became Foreign Minister in 1809. He also held the post of Chancellor of State from 1821 until 1848, under both Francis I and his son Ferdinand I. The period of 1815–1848 is also referred to as the &quot;Age of Metternich&quot;. During this period, Metternich controlled the Habsburg monarchy&#x27;s foreign policy. He also had a major influence in European politics. He was known for his strong conservative views and approach in politics. Metternich&#x27;s policies were strongly against revolution and liberalism. In his opinion, liberalism was a form of legalized revolution. Metternich believed that absolute monarchy was the only proper system of government. This notion influenced his anti-revolutionary policy to ensure the continuation of the Habsburg monarchy in Europe. Metternich was a practitioner of balance-of-power diplomacy. His foreign policy aimed to maintain international political equilibrium to preserve the Habsburgs&#x27; power and influence in international affairs. Following the Napoleonic Wars, Metternich was the chief architect of the Congress of Vienna in 1815. The Austrian Empire was the main beneficiary from the Congress of Vienna and it established an alliance with Britain, Prussia, and Russia forming the Quadruple Alliance. The Austrian Empire also gained new territories from the Congress of Vienna, and its influence expanded to the north through the German Confederation and also into Italy. Due to the Congress of Vienna in 1815, Austria was the leading member of the German Confederation. Following the Congress, the major European powers agreed to meet and discuss resolutions in the event of future disputes or revolutions. Because of Metternich&#x27;s main role in the architecture of the Congress, these meetings are also referred to as the &quot;Metternich congress&quot; or &quot;Metternich system&quot;. Under Metternich as the Austrian foreign minister, other congresses would meet to resolve European foreign affairs. These included the Congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle (1818), Carlsbad (1819), Troppau (1820), Laibach (1821), and Verona (1822). The Metternich congresses aimed to maintain the political equilibrium among the European powers and prevent revolutionary efforts. These meetings also aimed to resolve foreign issues and disputes without resorting to violence. By means of these meetings and by allying the Austrian Empire with other European powers whose monarchs had a similar interest in preserving conservative political direction, Metternich was able to establish the Austrian Empire&#x27;s influence on European politics. Also, because Metternich used the fear of revolutions among European powers, which he also shared, he was able to establish security and predominance of the Habsburgs in Europe.

Under Metternich, nationalist revolts in Austrian north Italy and in the German states were forcibly crushed. At home, he pursued a similar policy to suppress revolutionary and liberal ideals. He employed the Carlsbad Decrees of 1819, which used strict censorship of education, press and speech to repress revolutionary and liberal concepts. Metternich also used a wide-ranging spy network to dampen down unrest.

Metternich operated very freely with regard to foreign policy under Emperor Francis I&#x27;s reign. Francis died in 1835. This date marks the decline of Metternich&#x27;s influence in the Austrian Empire. Francis&#x27; heir was his son Ferdinand I, but he suffered from health issues. Ferdinand&#x27;s accession preserved the Habsburg dynastic succession, but he was not capable of ruling. The leadership of the Austrian Empire was transferred to a state council composed of Metternich, Francis I&#x27;s brother Archduke Louis, and Count Franz Anton Kolowrat, who later became the first Minister-President of the Austrian Empire. The liberal Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire forced Metternich&#x27;s resignation. Metternich is remembered for his success in maintaining the status quo and the Habsburg influence in international affairs. No Habsburg foreign minister following Metternich held a similar position within the empire for such a long time nor held such a vast influence on European foreign affairs.

Historians generally consider the Metternich era as a period of stability: the Austrian Empire fought no wars nor did it undergo any radical internal reforms. However, it was also thought of as a period of economic growth and prosperity in the Austrian Empire. The population of Austria rose to 37.5 million by 1843. Urban expansion also occurred and the population of Vienna reached 400,000. During the Metternich era, the Austrian Empire also maintained a stable economy and reached an almost balanced budget, despite having a major deficit following the Napoleonic Wars.

===Revolutions of 1848===

From March 1848 through November 1849, the Empire was threatened by revolutionary movements, most of which were of a nationalist character. Besides that, liberal and even socialist currents resisted the empire&#x27;s longstanding conservatism. Although most of the revolution plans failed, some changes were made; significant lasting reforms included the abolition of serfdom, cancellation of censorship and a promise made by Ferdinand I of Austria said to implement a constitution throughout the whole Empire.

===The Bach years===
After the death of Prince Felix of Schwarzenberg in 1852, the Minister of the Interior Baron Alexander von Bach largely dictated policy in Austria and Hungary. Bach centralized administrative authority for the Austrian Empire, but he also endorsed reactionary policies that reduced freedom of the press and abandoned public trials. He later represented the Absolutist (or &quot;Klerikalabsolutist&quot;) party, which culminated in the concordat of August 1855 that gave the Roman Catholic Church control over education and family life. This period in the history of the Austrian Empire would become known as the era of neo-absolutism, or Bach&#x27;s absolutism.

The pillars of the so-called Bach system (&quot;Bachsches System&quot;) were, in the words of Adolf Fischhof, four &quot;armies&quot;: &quot;a standing army of soldiers, a sitting army of office holders, a kneeling army of priests and a fawning army of sneaks&quot;. Prisons were full of political prisoners, like Czech nationalist journalist and writer Karel Havlíček Borovský who was forcibly expatriated (1851–1855) to Brixen. This exile undermined Borovský&#x27;s health and he died soon afterwards. This affair earned Bach a very bad reputation among Czechs and subsequently led to the strengthening of the Czech national movement.

However, Bach&#x27;s relaxed ideological views (apart from the neo-absolutism) led to a great rise in the 1850s of economic freedom. Internal customs duties were abolished, and peasants were emancipated from their feudal obligations.

In her capacity as leader of the German Confederation, Austria participated with volunteers in the First War of Schleswig (1848–1850).

Sardinia allied itself with France for the conquest of Lombardy–Venetia. Austria was defeated in the 1859 armed conflict. The Treaties of Villafranca and Zürich removed Lombardy, except for the part east of the Mincio river, the so-called Mantovano.

===After 1859===
The Constitution of 1861, also known as &quot;February Patent&quot;, created a House of Lords () and a House of Deputies (). But most nationalities of the monarchy remained dissatisfied.

After the second war with Denmark in 1864, Holstein came under Austrian administration, and Schleswig and Lauenburg under Prussian administration. But the internal difficulties continued. Diets replaced the parliament in 17 provinces, the Hungarians pressed for autonomy, and Venetia was attracted by the now unified Italy.

After the Austrian army was defeated in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866 and the German Confederation was dissolved, the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867 was adopted. By this act, the Kingdom of Hungary and the Empire of Austria as two separate entities joined on an equal basis to form the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary. The frequent abbreviation K.u.K. (&quot;Kaiserliche und Königliche&quot;, &quot;Imperial and Royal&quot;) does not refer to that dual monarchy but originated in 1745, when the &quot;royal&quot; part referred to the Apostolic Kingdom of Hungary. However, during World War I Austria-Hungary issued military stamps for use in occupied regions, with the text &quot;K.u.K. Feldpost&quot; or K.u.K. Militärpost.

==Foreign policy==

The Napoleonic Wars dominated Austrian foreign policy from 1804 to 1815. The Austrian army was one of the most formidable forces the French had to face. After Prussia signed a peace treaty with France on 5 April 1795, Austria was forced to carry the main burden of war with Napoleonic France for almost ten years. This severely overburdened the Austrian economy, making the war greatly unpopular. Emperor Francis I therefore refused to join any further war against Napoleon for a long time. On the other hand, Francis I continued to intrigue for the possibility of revenge against France, entering into a secret military agreement with the Russian Empire in November 1804. This convention was to assure mutual cooperation in the case of a new war against France.

Austrian unwillingness to join the Third Coalition was overcome by British subsidies, but the Austrians withdrew from the war yet again after a decisive defeat at the Battle of Austerlitz. Although the Austrian budget suffered from wartime expenditures and its international position was significantly undermined, the humiliating Treaty of Pressburg provided plenty of time to strengthen the army and economy. Moreover, the ambitious Archduke Charles and Johann Philipp von Stadion never abandoned the goal of further war with France.

Archduke Charles of Austria served as the Head of the Council of War and Commander in Chief of the Austrian army. Endowed with the enlarged powers, he reformed the Austrian Army to preparedness for another war. Johann Philipp von Stadion, the foreign minister, personally hated Napoleon due to an experience of confiscation of his possessions in France by Napoleon. In addition, the third wife of Francis I, Maria Ludovika of Austria-Este, agreed with Stadion&#x27;s efforts to begin a new war. Klemens Wenzel von Metternich, located in Paris, called for careful advance in the case of the war against France. The defeat of French army at the Battle of Bailén in Spain on 27 July 1808 triggered the war. On 9 April 1809, an Austrian force of 170,000 men attacked Bavaria.

Despite military defeats of the Austrian army—especially the Battles of Marengo, Ulm, Austerlitz and Wagram—and consequently lost territory throughout the Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars (the Treaties of Campo Formio in 1797, Luneville in 1801, Pressburg in 1806, and Schönbrunn in 1809), Austria played a decisive part in the overthrow of Napoleon in the campaigns of 1813–14. It participated in a second invasion of France in 1815, and put an end to Murat&#x27;s regime in south Italy.

The latter period of Napoleonic Wars featured Metternich exerting a large degree of influence over foreign policy in the Austrian Empire, a matter nominally decided by the Emperor. Metternich initially supported an alliance with France, arranging the marriage between Napoleon and Francis I&#x27;s daughter, Marie-Louise; however, by the 1812 campaign, he had realised the inevitability of Napoleon&#x27;s downfall and took Austria to war against France. Metternich&#x27;s influence at the Congress of Vienna was remarkable, and he became not only the premier statesman in Europe but the virtual ruler of the Empire until 1848—the Year of revolutions—and the rise of liberalism equated to his political downfall. The result was that the Austrian Empire was seen as one of the great powers after 1815, but also as a reactionary force and an obstacle to national aspirations in Italy and Germany.

During this time, Metternich was able to maintain an elaborate balance between Prussia, the lesser German states, and Austria in the German Confederation. Thanks to his efforts, Austria was seen as the senior partner with Prussia keeping watch over Germany as a whole. Further, Metternich opposed the weakening of France in the years after Napoleon, and viewed the new monarchy in Paris as an effective tool in keeping Russia at bay. From 1815 to 1848, Metternich steered Austria Imperial foreign policy, and indeed the mood of Europe, and managed to keep peace on the continent despite the growing liberal and radical movements inside most major powers. His resignation in 1848, forced by moderates in the court, and revolutionaries in the streets, may have caused the spread of the revolutions throughout the monarchy. It is stipulated that Metternich&#x27;s departure emboldened liberal factions in Austria and Hungary, but this cannot be confirmed for certain.

During the Crimean War, Austria maintained a policy of hostile neutrality towards Russia, and, while not going to war, was supportive of the Anglo-French coalition. Having abandoned its alliance with Russia, Austria was diplomatically isolated following the war, which contributed to Russia&#x27;s non-intervention in the 1859 Franco-Austrian War, which meant the end of Austrian influence in Italy; and in the 1866 Austro-Prussian War, with the loss of its influence in most German-speaking land.

The old Habsburg possessions of Further Austria (in today&#x27;s France, Germany and Switzerland) had already been lost in the 1805 Peace of Pressburg.

From 1850, Croatia, Slavonia, and the Military Frontier constituted a single land with disaggregated provincial and military administration, and representation.

Administratively, most of the crown lands excluding Hungary, Croatia, Slavonia, Transylvania, Lombardy–Venetia and the Military Frontier were divided into (&#x27;circles&#x27;), an administrative division introduced under Maria Theresa in the 18th century. Following the revolutions of 1848 a brief attempt was made to introduce modern-style political districts (in addition to the ), but the reforms of Bach in 1853/54 instead instituted a system which delegated the responsibilities of the among subordinate (&#x27;office districts&#x27;), a system which persisted until 1867.

In the course of the post-1848 reforms Transylvania was also divided into in 1851 (re-divided in 1854); the Voivodeship of Serbia and Banat of Temeschwar was also divided into .

<doc id="266899" wikidata="Q2249826" url="?curid=266899" title="Third eye">
<text>The third eye (also called the mind&#x27;s eye or inner eye) is an invisible eye, usually depicted as located on the forehead, supposed to provide perception beyond ordinary sight. In Hinduism, the third eye refers to the ajna (or brow) chakra. In both Hinduism and Buddhism, the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows, representing the enlightenment one achieves through meditation.

Especially in Eastern spiritual practices, the third eye refers to the gate that leads to the inner realms and spaces of higher consciousness, and often symbolizes a state of enlightenment. The third eye is often associated with religious visions, clairvoyance, the ability to observe chakras and auras, precognition, and out-of-body experiences.

==In Hinduism==

In Hinduism, the third eye refers to the ajna (or brow) chakra, said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows. Hindus place a &quot;tilaka&quot; between the eyebrows as a representation of the third eye, which is also seen on expressions of Shiva. He is referred to as &quot;Tryambaka Deva&quot;, or the three-eyed lord, where his third eye symbolizes the power of knowledge, and the detection of evil. His eye is depicted by three horizontal lines in the middle of his forehead.

==In Buddhism==
In Buddhism, the third eye is said to be located around the middle of the forehead, slightly above the junction of the eyebrows, Buddhists regard the third eye as the &quot;eye of consciousness&quot;, representing the vantage point from which enlightenment beyond one&#x27;s physical sight is achieved, and use an urna to the same effect as Hindus. The third eye, or the “Eye of Wisdom”, is discerned on the deity Buddha.

==In Taoism==
In Taoism, third eye training involves focusing attention on the point between the eyebrows with the eyes closed, and while the body is in various qigong postures. The goal of this training is to allow students to tune into the correct &quot;vibration&quot; of the universe and gain a solid foundation on which to reach a more advanced meditative state. Taoism teaches that the third eye, also called the mind&#x27;s eye, is situated between the two physical eyes, and expands up to the middle of the forehead when opened. Taoism asserts that the third eye is one of the main energy centers of the body located at the sixth Chakra, forming a part of the main meridian, the line separating left and right hemispheres of the body.

==In Theosophy==
Adherents of theosophist H. P. Blavatsky have suggested that the third eye is in fact the partially dormant pineal gland, which resides between the two hemispheres of the brain. Reptiles and amphibians sense light via a third parietal eye—a structure associated with the pineal gland—which serves to regulate their circadian rhythms, and for navigation, as it can sense the polarization of light. She states that certain functions of the mind are associated with the pineal gland and the acervulus cerebri was absent in children below the age of six. C. W. Leadbeater thought that by extending an &quot;etheric tube&quot; from the third eye, it is possible to develop microscopic and telescopic vision. It has been asserted by Stephen Phillips that the third eye&#x27;s microscopic vision is capable of observing objects as small as quarks. According to this belief, humans had in far ancient times an actual third eye in the back of the head with a physical and spiritual function. Over time, as humans evolved, this eye atrophied and sunk into what today is known as the pineal gland. Rick Strassman has hypothesized that the pineal gland, which maintains light sensitivity, is responsible for the production and release of DMT (dimethyltryptamine), an entheogen which he believes could be excreted in large quantities at the moments of birth and death.

<doc id="266907" wikidata="Q318703" url="?curid=266907" title="Edmund Randolph">
<text>Edmund Jennings Randolph (August 10, 1753 September 12, 1813) was a Founding Father of the United States, attorney, and the seventh Governor of Virginia. As a delegate from Virginia, he attended the Constitutional Convention and helped to create the national constitution while serving on its Committee of Detail. He was appointed the first United States Attorney General by George Washington and subsequently served as the second Secretary of State during the Washington administration.

==Early life==
Randolph was born on August 10, 1753, to the influential Randolph family in Williamsburg in the Colony of Virginia. He was educated at the College of William and Mary. After graduation, he began reading law with his father John Randolph and uncle Peyton Randolph. 

In 1775, with the start of the American Revolution, Randolph&#x27;s father, an active Loyalist, fled with his family to Britain. Son Edmund stayed in America, where he joined the Continental Army as an aide-de-camp to General George Washington.

Upon the death of his uncle Peyton Randolph in October 1775, Edmund Randolph returned to Virginia to act as executor of the estate and, while there, was elected as a representative to the Fourth Virginia Convention. He was later mayor of Williamsburg and then attorney general of Virginia, a post he held until 1786. He was married on August 29, 1776, to Elizabeth Nicholas, the daughter of Robert C. Nicholas, and had a total of six children, including Peyton Randolph, Governor of Virginia from 1811 to 1812.

==Political career==
===Early political career===

Randolph was selected as one of 11 delegates to represent Virginia at the Continental Congress in 1779 and served as a delegate until 1782. He also remained in private law practice, handling numerous legal issues for Washington and others.

Randolph was elected as Governor of Virginia in 1786. That year, he was a delegate to the Annapolis Convention. He had taken on the young John Marshall as a student and then law partner and transferred his lucrative law practice to Marshall when Randolph became governor since Virginia law barred executive officers from private practice in its courts.

====Constitutional Convention====

The following year, as a delegate from Virginia to the Constitutional Convention, at 34, Randolph introduced the Virginia Plan as an outline for a new national government. Although an enslaver himself, he argued against the importation of enslaved people and for a strong central government and advocated a plan for three chief executives from various parts of the country. The Virginia Plan also proposed a bicameral legislature, both houses of which would have delegates chosen based on state population. Randolph proposed and was supported unanimously by the convention&#x27;s delegates &quot;that a Nationally Judiciary be established&quot; (Article III of the U.S. Constitution would establish the federal court system). The Articles of Confederation lacked a national court system for the United States.

Randolph was also a member of the &quot;Committee of Detail,&quot; which was tasked with converting the Virginia Plan&#x27;s 15 resolutions to a first draft of the Constitution.

Randolph ultimately refused to sign the final document, one of only three members who remained in the Constitutional Congress but refused to sign (the others were the fellow Virginian George Mason and Elbridge Gerry of Massachusetts). Randolph thought the final document lacked sufficient checks and balances and published an account of his objections in October 1787. He thought that the federal judiciary would threaten state courts, and he considered the Senate too powerful and Congress&#x27;s power too broad. He also objected to the lack of a provision for a second convention to act after the present instrument had been referred to the states.

====Role in ratification====
Randolph served a significant role in the drafting of the original constitution. He helped to propose the Virginia Plan as a delegate from Virginia. This plan was eventually revised into the final draft of the U.S. Constitution. However, Randolph did not sign the Constitution&#x27;s final draft because he wanted increased protections for individuals and did not agree with all of the revisions made to the original Virginia Plan. 
====Virginia Convention====
Randolph nevertheless reversed his position at the Virginia Ratifying Convention in 1788; an event held at the Richmond Theatre. He chaired the nearly equally-divided convention, and Mason (as one of the leaders of the opposition, along with Patrick Henry) greatly resented Randolph&#x27;s change of position. Mason and other opponents demanded amendments before ratification. Randolph noted that he had seen several responses to the insistence that modifications were necessary before ratification. Some thought the objection to be insubstantial because the Constitution provided a process for amendment. In common with other advocates of amending the Constitution before ratification, Randolph insisted that it would be easier to amend the Constitution before its ratification when a majority might do so than to ratify an imperfect Constitution and then to assemble the votes of three-fourths of the states. He did not think the people should become accustomed to altering their constitution with any regularity once it was adopted.

Governor Randolph had written, &quot;If after our best efforts for amendments, they cannot be obtained, I will adopt the constitution as it is.&quot; Ultimately, Randolph said he voted for ratification of the Constitution because by June 2, eight other states had already done so, and he did not want to see Virginia left out of the new national government. Randolph believed Virginia must choose between the stark alternatives of ratification and disunion. Randolph never doubted the union&#x27;s advantages.

In the Richmond Ratification Convention, Randolph ultimately pointed the way to an understanding of ratification with which Virginia&#x27;s leaders could be satisfied. He assured his fellow members of the Virginia political elite that the Constitution that it was being asked to ratify in the summer of 1788 would have minimal significance and that it would enter more a league of sovereign states than a consolidated union.

Randolph wrote that his tactics swayed five of the ten delegates whose views had been entirely unknown to vote for ratification. Ultimately, Virginia&#x27;s Federalists secured the Constitution&#x27;s ratification by precisely five votes.

===Washington&#x27;s Cabinet===
President Washington rewarded Randolph for his support. In September 1789, Randolph was appointed the first Attorney General of the US. Here he maintained a precarious neutrality in the feuds between Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson (who was a second cousin to Randolph). Serving in Washington&#x27;s cabinet, as in the ratification dispute of 1787–88, Randolph tried to bring people together rather than contest with others in pursuit of self-righteous ideological purity. He continued to make important contributions to the new nation&#x27;s structure and its relationship with the states.

When Jefferson resigned as Secretary of State in 1793, Randolph succeeded him. The primary diplomatic initiative of his term was the Jay Treaty with Britain in 1794. However, Hamilton devised the plan and wrote the instructions, leaving Randolph the minor role of signing the papers. Hostile to the resulting treaty, Randolph almost gained Washington&#x27;s ear for his concerns but was overridden in the wake of the Fauchet scandal (see below). Near the end of his term as Secretary of State, negotiations for Pinckney&#x27;s Treaty were finalized.

====The Fauchet scandal and resignation====
A scandal involving an intercepted French message led to Randolph&#x27;s resignation from Washington&#x27;s cabinet in August 1795. As Secretary of State, Randolph was tasked with maintaining friendly relations with France. The British Navy had intercepted and turned over to President Washington correspondence from Joseph Fauchet, the French ambassador to the United States, to his superiors. The letters reflected a contempt for the United States for which Randolph appeared primarily responsible, the contents implying that Randolph had exposed the inner debates in Washington&#x27;s cabinet to the French and had related that the administration was hostile to France. Elkins and McKitrick concluded that, at the very least, there &quot;was something here profoundly disreputable to the government&#x27;s good faith and character.&quot;

Washington immediately overruled Randolph&#x27;s negative advice about the Jay Treaty. A few days later, Washington handed the minister&#x27;s letter to Randolph in the presence of the entire cabinet and demanded an explanation. Randolph was speechless and immediately resigned. Chernow and Elkins concluded that France did not bribe Randolph but that he &quot;was rather a pitiable figure, possessed of some talents and surprisingly little malice, but subject to self-absorbed silliness and lapses of good sense.&quot;

Randolph&#x27;s published response, &quot;Vindication&quot;, illustrates his concerns about public and private perceptions of his charactersuch concerns for reputation holding great value in the 18th century. In the event, Randolph secured a published retraction from Fauchet.

After his resignation, Randolph was held personally responsible for losing a large sum of money during his administration of the state department. He was eventually adjudged to owe the government more than $49,000, which he paid.

==Marriage to Elizabeth Nicholas==
Elizabeth Nicholas was a daughter of Robert Carter Nicholas Sr, then the state treasurer of Virginia. Randolph wrote to his children after his wife&#x27;s death: &quot;We were both born in the city of Williamsburg, within twelve hours of each other; myself on the 10th of August 1753, and she on the 11th. My aunt Randolph, who saw each of us soon after our birth, facetiously foretold that we should be united in marriage-a circumstance which, improbable at the time from the dissensions of our families, seemed daily to grow into an impossibility from their increasing rancor. In childhood we were taught the elements of reading at the same school... she won me by the best of all graces, cheerfulness, good sense, and benevolence. I do not recollect that I reflected much upon that range of qualities, which I afterwards found to be constituents of nuptial happiness; but Providence seemed to be kinder to me than my most deliberate judgment could have been... I desired nothing more than that she should sincerely persuade herself that she would be happy with me.&quot;

They married on August 29, 1776. Their marital relationship was close and so free of friction that his daughters could not forget one singular instance of misunderstandingMrs. Randolph having related some particular incident, and her husband hastily exclaimed: &quot;That is mere gossip.&quot; The lady repaired to her room and did not answer her husband&#x27;s gentle knock. Then Randolph said, &quot;Betsey, I have urgent business in town, but I shall not leave this house until permitted to apologize to you.&quot; The door opened, and the unprecedented scene ended.

After Mrs. Randolph&#x27;s death in 1810, the heartbroken husband wrote some account of her and their married life, which was addressed to his children as &quot;the best witnesses of the truth of the brief history.&quot; In part, Randolph wrote, &quot;My eyes are every moment beholding so many objects with which she was associated; I sometimes catch a sound which deludes me so much with the similitude of her voice; I carry about my heart and hold for a daily visit so many of her precious relics; and, above all, my present situation is so greatly contrasted by its vacancy, regrets, and anguish, with the purest and unchequered bliss, so far as it depended on her, for many years of varying fortune, that I have vowed at her grave daily to maintain with her a mental intercourse.&quot;

==Later life==
After leaving the federal cabinet, Randolph returned to Virginia to practice law, where he was a leader of the state bar. His most famous case was defending Aaron Burr at his trial for treason in 1807.

In 1791, Randolph was elected to the American Philosophical Society.

==Death and legacy==
Randolph lived his final years as a guest of his friend Nathaniel Burwell at Carter Hall, near Millwood, Virginia, in Clarke County. He suffered from paralysis in his final years and died at 60 on September 12, 1813. He is buried nearby at the Burwell family cemetery adjacent to &quot;Old Chapel.&quot;

Randolph County, Virginia (now West Virginia) was formed in 1787 and named in Randolph&#x27;s honor. Randolph County, Illinois was also named after him. Randolph, who was the governor of Virginia when the state ceded what was then sometimes called Illinois County, Virginia (a title disputed by Pennsylvania and others) to the new federal government, which created the Northwest Territory. Randolph County&#x27;s motto is &quot;where Illinois began&quot; because it was one of the first two settled counties in the territory. It contains Kaskaskia, the first seat of Illinois County, which later became the Illinois Territory&#x27;s capital and ultimately the state&#x27;s first capital.

The town of Randolph, Vermont is also named after him.

The Edmund J. Randolph Award is the highest award given by the US Department of Justice to persons who make &quot;outstanding contributions to the accomplishments of the Department&#x27;s mission.&quot;

<text>Harrods is a Grade II listed luxury department store on Brompton Road in Knightsbridge, London, England. It was designed by C. W. Stephens for Charles Digby Harrod, and opened in 1905; it replaced the first store on the grounds founded by his father Charles Henry Harrod in 1849, which burned down in 1881. The store spans of selling space, making it the largest department store in Europe and one of the largest in the world. Harrods is one of the most famous department stores worldwide, attracting 15 million visitors annually .

The original holding company, Harrod&#x27;s Stores Limited, was formed and began trading on the London Stock Exchange in 1889. It was acquired by and merged into the House of Fraser in 1959, which itself was acquired by the Fayed brothers and became a privately held company in 1985. When the House of Fraser was relisted on the stock exchange, the Harrods business was split off to remain privately held in 1994. The present-day legal entity, the Harrods Group, was established by the Fayed brothers in 2006. It was sold to the Qatar Investment Authority, the sovereign wealth fund of Qatar, in 2010.

== History ==
In 1824, at the age of 25, Charles Henry Harrod established a business at 228 Borough High Street in Southwark. He ran this business, variously listed as a draper, mercer, and a haberdasher, until at least 1831. During 1825, the business was listed as &#x27;Harrod and Wicking, Linen Drapers, Retail&#x27;, but this partnership was dissolved at the end of that year. His first grocery business appears to be as &#x27;Harrod &amp; Co. Grocers&#x27; at 163 Upper Whitecross Street, Clerkenwell, E.C.1., in 1832.

In 1834, in London&#x27;s East End, he established a wholesale grocery in Stepney at 4 Cable Street with a special interest in tea. Attempting to capitalise on trade during the Great Exhibition of 1851 in nearby Hyde Park, in 1849 Harrod took over a small shop in the district of Brompton, on the site of the current store. Beginning in a single room employing two assistants and a messenger boy, Harrod&#x27;s son Charles Digby Harrod built the business into a thriving retail operation selling medicines, perfumes, stationery, fruits and vegetables. Harrods rapidly expanded, acquired the adjoining buildings, and employed one hundred people by 1881.

However, the store&#x27;s booming fortunes were reversed in early December 1883, when it burnt to the ground. Remarkably, Charles Harrod fulfilled all of his commitments to his customers to make Christmas deliveries that year—and made a record profit in the process. In short order, a new building was built on the same site, and soon Harrods extended credit for the first time to its best customers, among them Oscar Wilde, Lillie Langtry, Ellen Terry, Charlie Chaplin, Noël Coward, Gertrude Lawrence, Laurence Olivier and Vivien Leigh, Sigmund Freud, A. A. Milne, and many members of the British Royal Family. Beatrix Potter frequented the store from the age of 17. First published in 1902, her children&#x27;s book, &quot;The Tale of Peter Rabbit&quot;, was soon on sale in Harrods, accompanied by the world&#x27;s first licensed character, a Peter Rabbit soft toy (Peter and toys of other Potter characters appeared in Harrods catalogues from 1910). In 1921, Milne bought the 18-inch Alpha Farnell teddy bear from the store for his son Christopher Robin Milne who would name it Edward, then Winnie, becoming the basis for Winnie-the-Pooh. In December 1926, Agatha Christie, who visited Harrods as a girl, marvelled at the spectacle of the store&#x27;s Christmas display. The store has also featured in fiction, for example Mr. Bean (played by Rowan Atkinson) visited Harrods to buy Christmas decorations in the 1992 &quot;Mr. Bean&quot; episode &quot;Merry Christmas, Mr. Bean&quot;.

On 16 November 1898, Harrods debuted England&#x27;s first &quot;moving staircase&quot; (escalator) in their Brompton Road stores; the device was actually a woven leather conveyor belt-like unit with a mahogany and &quot;silver plate-glass&quot; balustrade. Nervous customers were offered brandy at the top to revive them after their &#x27;ordeal&#x27;.

The store was a founding member of the International Association of Department Stores from 1928 until 1935; its then-president, Franck Chitham, was also president of the association in 1930.

Mah-Jongg, a lemur, was sold to Stephen Courtauld and Virginia Courtauld (née Peirano) in 1923. Mah-Jongg lived with the Courtaulds for fifteen years, accompanying the couple on their travels and changes of residence, including Eltham Palace in the Royal Borough of Greenwich. In 1969, Christian the lion was bought at Harrods by John Rendall and Anthony &#x27;Ace&#x27; Bourke. The lion was set free in Kenya after reaching maturity.

The Disney at Harrods partnership added the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique salon on 25 November 2013 to the previously operating Disney Cafe and Disney Store.

== Architecture ==

The store occupies a site and has over one million square feet () of selling space in over 330 departments making it the biggest department store in Europe. The UK&#x27;s second-biggest shop, Selfridges, Oxford Street, is a little over half the size with of selling space. By comparison Europe&#x27;s second-largest department store the KaDeWe in Berlin has a retail space of .

The figurative sculptures that once adorned the Harrods food hall were consigned for sale at West Middlesex Auction Rooms in 2012. The two Mermaids supporting a giant Clam and the Stag and Boar sheltering under an English Oak are purchased by Greaves &amp; Thomas for inclusion in an elaborate fountain for Ryde, Isle of Wight.

=== Memorials ===

Following the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales, and Dodi Fayed, Mohamed Al-Fayed&#x27;s son, two memorials to the couple commissioned by Al-Fayed were erected inside Harrods. The first, located at the base of the Egyptian Escalator, was unveiled on 12 April 1998, consisting of photographs of the two behind a pyramid-shaped display that holds a wine glass smudged with lipstick from Diana&#x27;s last dinner as well as what is described as an engagement ring Dodi purchased the day before they died.

The second memorial, unveiled in 2005 and located by the escalator at door three is entitled &quot;Innocent Victims&quot;, a bronze statue of the two dancing on a beach beneath the wings of an albatross, a bird said to symbolise the &quot;Holy Spirit&quot;. The sculpture was created by William Mitchell, a close friend of Al-Fayed and artistic design advisor to Harrods for 40 years. Al-Fayed said he wanted to keep the pair&#x27;s &quot;spirit alive&quot; through the statue.

== Products and services ==
The Harrods motto is &quot;Omnia Omnibus Ubique&quot;, which is Latin for &quot;all things for all people, everywhere&quot;. Several of its departments, including the Seasonal Christmas department, jewellery departments and the Food Halls, are well known.

The shop&#x27;s 330 departments offer a wide range of products and services. Products on offer include clothing for women, men, children and infants, electronics, jewellery, sporting gear, bridal trousseau, pet accessories, toys (including Christmas and signature teddy bears), food and drink, health and beauty items, packaged gifts, stationery, housewares, home appliances, furniture, and much more.

A representative sample of shop services includes 23 restaurants, serving everything from high tea to tapas to pub food to haute cuisine; a personal shopping-assistance programme known as &quot;By Appointment&quot;; a watch repair service; a tailor; a dispensing pharmacy; a beauty spa and salon; a barbers shop; Ella Jade Bathroom Planning and Design Service; private events planning and catering; food delivery; a wine steward; bespoke picnic hampers and gift boxes; bespoke cakes; bespoke fragrance formulations; and Bespoke Arcades machines.

Up to 300,000 customers visit the shop on peak days, comprising the highest proportion of customers from non-English speaking countries of any department store in London. More than five thousand staff from over fifty different countries work at Harrods.

In October 2009, Harrods Bank started selling gold bars and coins that customers could buy &quot;off the shelf&quot;. The gold products ranged from to , and could be purchased within Harrods Bank. They also offered storage services, as well as the ability to sell back gold to Harrods in the future.

Harrods used to provide paid &quot;luggage room&quot; services for storing luggage/ items; however, post COVID they stopped providing this service.

=== Stocking issues ===
Harrods and Mohamed Al-Fayed were criticised for selling real animal fur, provoking regular protests organised outside Harrods. Harrods is the only department store in Britain that has continued to sell fur. 

Harrods was sharply criticised in 2004 by the Hindu community for marketing a line of feminine underwear (designed by Roberto Cavalli) which featured the images of Indian goddesses. The line was eventually withdrawn and formal apologies were made.

== Customers ==
=== Customer dress code ===
In 1989, Harrods introduced a dress code for customers. The store turned away people whose dress is not in compliance with the code. Forbidden items include cycling shorts; high-cut shorts, Bermuda or beach shorts; swimwear; athletic singlets; flip flops or thong sandals; bare feet; bare midriff; or wearing dirty or unkempt clothing. Patrons found not in compliance with the code and barred from entry include pop star Kylie Minogue, Jason Donovan, Luke Goss, a Scout troop, a woman with a Mohican hair cut, and the entire first team from FC Shakhtar Donetsk who were wearing tracksuits.

As of 2023, Harrods takes the following position: &quot;We do not have a specific dress code for entry into the store, including any of our restaurants. However, we do reserve the right to refuse entry to anyone who is not deemed to be appropriately dressed. Sportswear, including trainers, shorts, and tracksuits, are permitted across all areas of the store and restaurants.&quot;

=== Royal warrants ===
Harrods was the holder of royal warrants from:
*Queen Elizabeth II (Provisions and Household Goods)
*Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh (Outfitters)
*Charles, Prince of Wales (Outfitters and Saddlers)
*Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother (China and Glass)

In August 2010, in a letter to &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, chairman Mohamed Al-Fayed revealed that he had burnt Harrods royal warrants, after taking them down in 2000. Harrods had held the royal warrants since 1910. Describing the warrants as a &quot;curse&quot;, Al-Fayed claimed that business had tripled since their removal. Prince Philip removed his warrant in January 2000, and the other warrants were removed from Harrods by Al-Fayed in December, pending their five-yearly review. Prince Philip had been banned from Harrods by Al-Fayed. Film of the burning of the warrants in 2009 was shown in the final scene of &quot;Unlawful Killing&quot;, a film funded by Al-Fayed and directed by Keith Allen.

=== Asma al-Assad ===
Asma al-Assad, the wife of the President of Syria, Bashar al-Assad, used an alias to shop at Harrods despite economic sanctions imposed by the European Union that froze funds belonging to her and her husband.

== Ownership ==
A chance meeting in London with businessman, Edgar Cohen, eventually led to Charles Harrod selling his interest in the store for £120,000 () via a stock market flotation in 1889. The new company was called Harrod&#x27;s Stores Limited. Sir Alfred James Newton became chairman and Richard Burbidge managing director. Financier William Mendel was appointed to the board in 1891 and he raised funding for many of the business expansion plans. Richard Burbidge was succeeded in 1917 by his son Woodman Burbidge and he in turn by his son Richard in 1935.

The department store was acquired by House of Fraser in 1959, fighting off competition from Debenhams and United Drapery Stores. The business was in turn was purchased by the Fayed brothers in 1985 for £615 million. In 1994, Harrods was moved out of the House of Fraser Group to remain a private company prior to the group&#x27;s relisting on the London Stock Exchange. Omar Fayed, Mohamed&#x27;s youngest son, joined the Harrods board in 2006.

Following denial that it was for sale, Harrods was sold to Qatar Holdings, the sovereign wealth fund of the State of Qatar for £1.5 billion in May 2010. A fortnight previously, chairman of Harrods since 1985, Mohamed Al-Fayed, had stated that &quot;People approach us from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar. Fair enough. But I put two fingers up to them. It is not for sale. This is not Marks and Spencer or Sainsbury&#x27;s. It is a special place that gives people pleasure. There is only one Mecca.&quot;

The sale was concluded in the early hours of 8 May, when Qatari Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani came to London to finalise the deal, saying that the acquisition of Harrods would add &quot;much value&quot; to the investment portfolio of Qatar Holdings while his deputy, Hussain Ali Al-Abdulla, called it a &quot;landmark transaction&quot;. A spokesman for Mohamed Al-Fayed said &quot;in reaching the decision to retire, [Fayed] wished to ensure that the legacy and traditions that he has built up in Harrods would be continued.&quot;

Al-Fayed later revealed in an interview that he decided to sell Harrods following the difficulty in getting his dividend approved by the trustees of the Harrods pension fund. Al-Fayed said &quot;I&#x27;m here every day, I can&#x27;t take my profit because I have to take a permission of those bloody idiots. I say is this right? Is this logic? Somebody like me? I run a business and I need to take the trustee&#x27;s permission to take my profit.&quot; Al-Fayed was appointed honorary chairman of Harrods, a position he held for six months.

== Criticism and controversy ==
=== Staff issues ===
Harrods has been criticised by &quot;Guardian&quot; journalist Sali Hughes as &quot;deeply sexist&quot; for making female employees wear six kinds of makeup at all times without requiring this of male employees. Harrods was criticised by members of the Black community after the &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; reported that Harrods staff told a black woman that she would not be employed unless she chemically straightened her hair, stating that her natural hair style was &quot;unprofessional&quot;.

Harrods&#x27; restaurants and cafes included a 12.5% discretionary service charge on customers&#x27; bills, but failed to share the full proceeds with kitchen and service staff. Several employees joined the UVW union, which claimed that 483 affected employees were losing up to £5,000 each in tips every year. A surprise protest and roadblock organised by the union outside Harrods during the January sales of 2017 was followed by an announcement that &quot;an improved tronc system&quot; would give 100% of service charges to staff.

=== Sexual abuse allegations ===
Twenty female former staff members alleged that during Al Fayed’s ownership, Harrods not only failed to intervene, but helped cover up his sexual abuse of young staff members, including multiple rapes or attempted rapes.

The first report of abuse arose in 1985 soon after Al Fayed took ownership of the store, when a 15-year-old girl alleged she had been inappropriately touched by him. This was dismissed by the Crown prosecution service when Al fayed denied the claim. Further female staff and ex-staff members have subsequently come forward to add their names to the growing list of workers reportedly abused by Al Fayed and his brother Salah, now being accused of similar activity, with allegations now in the hundreds. A timeline of sexual abuse allegations by current and former staff now exists while investigations continue.

=== Trademark litigation ===
In 1986, the town of Ōtorohanga, New Zealand, briefly changed its name to &quot;Harrodsville&quot;. This was a protest in support of a restaurateur, Henry Harrod of Palmerston North, who was being forced to change the name of his restaurant following the threat of lawsuits from Mohamed Al Fayed, the then owner of Harrods department store. As a show of solidarity for Henry Harrod, and in anticipation of actions against other similar-sounding businesses, it was proposed that every business in Ōtorohanga change its name to &quot;Harrods&quot;. With the support of the District Council, Ōtorohanga temporarily changed the town&#x27;s name to Harrodsville. After being lampooned in the British tabloids, Al Fayed dropped the legal action and Harrodsville and its shops reverted to their former names. The town&#x27;s response raised widespread media interest around the world, with the BBC World Service and newspapers in Greece, Saudi Arabia, Australia and Canada covering the story.

On 27 October 2008, in the case of Harrods Ltd v. Harrods Limousine Ltd, the Harrods store applied to the Company Names Tribunal under s.69(1)(b) Companies Act 2006 for a change of name of Harrods Limousine Ltd, which had been registered at Companies House since 14 November 2007. The application went un-defended by the respondent and the adjudicator ordered on 16 January 2009 that Harrods Limousine Ltd must change their name within one month. Additionally the respondent was ordered not to cause or permit any steps to be taken to register another company with an offending name which could interfere, due to its similarity, with the goodwill of the applicant. Finally, Harrods Limousine Ltd was ordered to pay Harrods&#x27; costs for the litigation.

<text>Northwest Airlink was the brand name of Northwest Airlines&#x27; regional airline service, which flew turboprop and regional jet aircraft from Northwest&#x27;s domestic hubs in Minneapolis, Detroit, and Memphis. Service was primarily to small-to-medium-sized cities and towns where larger aircraft might not be economical to operate and also to larger markets to either provide additional capacity or more frequent flights than could be justified using mainline aircraft. The Northwest Airlink trade name was replaced by the [[Delta Connection]] trade name for Delta Air Lines following the Delta/Northwest merger.

== History ==
Northwest Airlink was formed in December 1984 when Northwest Airlines took steps to enhance its domestic services by entering a marketing agreement with Mesaba Airlines. Mesaba was the dominant airline serving Minneapolis/St Paul at the time. Under the agreement, Mesaba would operate as Northwest Orient Airlink. Mesaba initially operated commuter and regional turboprop aircraft. The Mesaba fleet at this time comprised fourteen Beechcraft 99 and one Fokker F27 aircraft. In 1985 Big Sky Airlines entered the Northwest Airlink agreement with 8-18 passenger seat aircraft including Jetstream 31 and Fairchild Metroliner commuter propjets. Another Northwest Airlink operator was Fischer Brothers Aviation flying CASA C-212, Dornier 228 and Short 360 commuter turboprops.

An Official Airline Guide (OAG) flight schedule dated February 1994 lists the following commuter and regional air carriers operating Northwest Airlink service:

* Express Airlines I 
* Express Airlines II
* Mesaba Airlines
* Northeast Express Regional Airlines
* Precision Airlines

In 2001, Pacific Island Aviation was operating Northwest Airlink service with Short 360 commuter turboprop aircraft between Guam, Saipan and Tinian.

Northwest Jet Airlink was subsequently formed to operate services with Avro RJ85 jets flown by Mesaba Airlines. Another Northwest Jet Airlink operator was Business Express Airlines flying Avro RJ70 jets.

==Incidents and accidents==
* March 4, 1987: Northwest Airlink Flight 2268, operated by Fischer Brothers Aviation, a CASA C-212 &quot;N160FB&quot; was on a scheduled flight from Mansfield to Detroit with an intermediate stop in Cleveland when it crashed while landing at Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport. The plane yawed violently to the left about 70 feet above the runway, skidded to the right, hit 3 ground support vehicles in front of Concourse F, and caught fire. Out of 19 occupants onboard (16 passengers and 3 crew), 9 were killed. The cause of the crash was determined to be pilot error.
* December 1, 1993: Northwest Airlink Flight 5719 being operated by Express Airlines I, a Jetstream 31, was flying a scheduled flight from Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport to International Falls with an en-route stop in Hibbing when it crashed while approaching for landing at Chisholm-Hibbing Airport. The plane descended struck the tops of trees and then two ridges and came to rest inverted on its right side. All 18 occupants (16 passengers and 2 crew) died. The cause of the crash was the lack of crew-coordination and loss of awareness of the altitude during a night instrument landing.
* October 14, 2004: Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701 was a Bombardier CRJ200 with a crew of two operating a ferry flight (with no passengers) from Little Rock, AR to Minneapolis, MN. It crashed in a residential area in Jefferson City, MO due to the flight crew pushing the plane past its capabilities and ignoring warnings. Both pilots were killed. The NTSB has since finished its investigation of the accident.
*April 12, 2007: Pinnacle Airlines Flight 4712, a Bombardier CRJ200 from Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport overran the runway when landing at Cherry Capital Airport (TVC), Traverse City, Michigan. The plane was damaged, but no one was injured. The NTSB determined that the cause of the accident was the &quot;pilots’ decision to land at TVC without performing a landing distance assessment&quot;, which in turn was caused by fatigued pilots and unclear directions from the TVC controller tower. The report recommended more landing distance training, post-accident drug testing, and further criteria for runway closures in snow and ice conditions.

<text>Endeavor Air is a regional airline in the United States headquartered at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, and staffs, operates, and maintains aircraft used on Delta Connection flights that are scheduled, marketed, and sold by Delta Air Lines.

The airline was founded as Express Airlines I in 1985 and was renamed Pinnacle Airlines in 2002. In 2012, Pinnacle&#x27;s parent company filed for Chapter 11 reorganization, then emerged as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines. The airline was renamed Endeavor Air on August 1, 2013.

Its corporate headquarters are located in Delta Air Lines Building C, on the property of Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. It has hubs in Atlanta, Cincinnati, Detroit, Minneapolis/St. Paul, New York&#x27;s LaGuardia &amp; JFK and Raleigh/Durham airports. Until the restructuring, Endeavor also operated a hub in Memphis.

== History ==
=== Express Airlines I ===
In February 1985, the airline was established as Express Airlines I, offering regional airline service to major airlines. The airline&#x27;s founder, Michael J. Brady, had planned to create several regional airlines under parent company Phoenix Airline Services, Inc, hence the roman numeral &quot;I&quot; in the name. A second company, established as Express Airlines II (known as &quot;Express II&quot;), was created by spinning off Express I&#x27;s operations at Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport to a separate entity. However, Express II contracted with Express I to provide crew scheduling, operational control, and training. Express II was later recombined back into Express I.

Express I began its first code-sharing agreement, in May 1985, with Republic Airlines. Republic was the dominant carrier in Memphis but, in keeping with the hub-and-spoke concept, wanted to add more smaller cities and free up its larger DC-9 jets to serve longer stage-length routes. Express I accomplished this by adding service, operating as Republic Express, to three cities using BAe Jetstream 31 aircraft. Within six months, Express Airlines I was operating in ten markets using nine Jetstream 31s and two Saab 340 aircraft.

By its first anniversary, Republic Express, as the service was known, was operating 20 Jetstream 31s and seven Saab 340s in 32 markets. Following regulatory and shareholder approvals, Northwest Airlines acquired Republic Airlines on October 1, 1986. Subsequently, the Republic Express brand merged with the Northwest Airlink brand.

Over the next decade, Express I provided airline services as Northwest Airlink to 56 cities in the Southeast and upper Mid-West. In 1997, Northwest Airlines bought Express I from Phoenix Airline Services. On April 1, 1997, Express I became a wholly owned subsidiary of Northwest Airlines. In order to consolidate the many Airlink systems operated at that time, Express I ceased flying from Minneapolis-St. Paul, and instead concentrated on the Memphis hub.

In August 1997, Express I moved its corporate headquarters to Memphis, allowing all the various departments to function from its main base of operations. On May 7, 2000, Express I became the launch operator of the Bombardier CRJ at Northwest.

Express I further expanded with the development of three additional Maintenance, Repair, Overhaul (MRO) facilities related to CRJ operations. The primary CRJ MRO is located in Knoxville, Tennessee, and is capable of handling up to four aircraft undercover. There were two additional CRJ maintenance sites located in Indiana at South Bend and Fort Wayne, but both were closed after the bankruptcy.

=== Pinnacle Airlines ===
On May 8, 2002, Express Airlines changed its name to Pinnacle Airlines. A new holding company, Pinnacle Airlines Corporation, had been created earlier that year. Pinnacle Airlines, Inc was moved from Northwest Airlines, Inc to Pinnacle Airlines Corporation. Over the next decade, the parent company acquired other airlines, such as Colgan Air and Mesaba Airlines.

In 2006, Northwest agreed to a new Air Service Agreement (ASA) that contracted Pinnacle to fly 124 CRJs until 2017. A clause within the ASA stipulated that if Pinnacle and the Air Line Pilots Association did not agree on a new pilot contract by March 31, 2007, then Northwest could remove up to 17 CRJs from Pinnacle&#x27;s fleet. After the deadline passed with no new pilot contract, Northwest exercised its right to remove 17 CRJs from Pinnacle, starting in September 2008 at a rate of two CRJs per month. These 17 CRJs were handed over to Mesaba Airlines in 2008, which Pinnacle&#x27;s parent company later acquired in 2010.

Northwest had also allowed Pinnacle to seek flying for other carriers. On April 30, 2007, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. signed a 10-year contract with Delta Air Lines to be a Delta Connection carrier. The 16 CRJ900s began delivery in November 2007 and the deliveries were completed in May 2009. The first batch of delivered aircraft was based in Atlanta and began service in December 2007. On June 10, 2008, Pinnacle announced that Delta planned to withdraw from the contract by July 31, 2008, for failure to make its timetable. However, on July 18, 2008, Delta announced that an agreement had been reached that would allow Pinnacle to continue flying for Delta under the terms of the initial contract. The remaining 4 CRJ900s would be delivered between January and May 2009, at which point all 15 CRJ900s would be in service for Delta Connection.

The FAA fined Pinnacle over $1 million for allegedly operating two Canadair Regional Jets in 2009 and 2010 that were not in compliance with FAA regulations. On one of the aircraft, the flight crew performed procedures that should have been conducted by maintenance personnel. FAA inspectors had denied a request to make the work an operations task. On a second aircraft, Pinnacle was accused of failing to conduct proper monitoring of a cracked low-pressure turbine case.

On January 4, 2012, Pinnacle&#x27;s fleet grew when its parent company moved aircraft and personnel from Mesaba Airlines, which ceased operations when the operating certificate was returned to the FAA. It also acquired personnel from Colgan Air after it ceased operations on September 5, 2012.

=== Endeavor Air ===
On April 1, 2012, Pinnacle&#x27;s parent company and its subsidiaries filed for bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The airline discontinued its operation of its Saab 340 and Bombardier Q400 turboprop aircraft by the end of November 2012. On May 1, 2013, Pinnacle Airlines Corporation emerged from Chapter 11 reorganization as a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines. After restructuring, the airline was renamed to Endeavor Air, its headquarters were moved to Minneapolis, Minnesota, and agreements with Delta were made to operate 76-seat and 50-seat regional jets.

On October 27, 2016, Endeavor Air adopted EDV as its new ICAO airline code and &quot;Endeavor&quot; as its callsign, replacing its previous code of FLG and &quot;Flagship&quot; callsign.

In March 2017, Endeavor announced it would be re-opening an Atlanta crew and maintenance base, operating CRJ200 aircraft at this hub. By July 2017, Endeavor had five crew and ten maintenance bases. CRJ900 operations were added to Atlanta later in the year, with the transfer of aircraft from ExpressJet. The CRJ700 was introduced in 2018.

Endeavor grew further in 2019 with the addition of aircraft from GoJet Airlines and new deliveries of 70-seat CRJ-900 aircraft.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* Northwest Airlink Flight 5719 (December 1, 1993): A Jetstream 31 (registration N334PX), operated by Express Airlines II, collided with trees and crashed while on approach to Chisholm-Hibbing Airport in Hibbing, Minnesota. All sixteen passengers and both pilots perished. The investigation determined that the captain exhibited a history of hostile and intimidating behavior toward first officers, which contributed to a breakdown in cockpit communication. This loss of coordination led to the crew&#x27;s failure to monitor altitude during a nighttime landing in poor weather conditions.
* Pinnacle Airlines Flight 3701 (October 14, 2004): A Bombardier CRJ200LR (registration N8396A), operated by Pinnacle Airlines, crashed in a residential area of Jefferson City, Missouri, during an repositioning flight from Little Rock, Arkansas, to Minneapolis. The aircraft lost power in both engines after the crew attempted to exceed its operational limits by reaching its maximum certified altitude. The crew could not restart the engines and was unsuccessful in gliding the aircraft to a safe landing. Both pilots were fatally injured, they were the only people aboard the aircraft.
* Pinnacle Airlines Ground Incident (January 24, 2012): A Bombardier CRJ200ER (registration N8524A), operated by Pinnacle Airlines, sustained irreparable damage at Rhode Island T. F. Green International Airport in Providence. The aircraft was connected to ground support equipment that caught fire, causing substantial damage to the aircraft&#x27;s electrical systems, leading it to be written off.
* Delta Connection Flight 3413 (May 1, 2018): A Bombardier CRJ900LR (registration N606LR), operated by Endeavor Air as Delta Connection Flight 3413, sustained substantial damage at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. The incident occurred when the wing of a Boeing 767-300ER operated by Delta Air Lines collided with the CRJ900&#x27;s tail while taxiing.
* Delta Connection Flight 4994 (January 2, 2023): A Bombardier CRJ900LR (registration N928XJ), operated by Endeavor Air as Delta Connection Flight 4994 , sustained substantial damage at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City. The incident occurred when the wing of an Airbus A330 operated by ITA Airways collided with the CRJ900&#x27;s tail while taxiing.
* Delta Connection Flight 5526 (September 10, 2024): A Bombardier CRJ900LR (registration N302PQ), operated by Endeavor Air as Delta Connection Flight 5526, sustained substantial damage at Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport. The incident occurred when the wing of an Airbus A350 operated by Delta Air Lines collided with and severed the CRJ900&#x27;s tail while taxiing.
* Delta Connection Flight 4819 (February 17, 2025): A Bombardier CRJ900LR (registration N932XJ), operated by Endeavor Air as Delta Connection Flight 4819, crashed and overturned upon landing at Toronto Pearson International Airport following a flight from Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport. The accident resulted in injuries to at least 21 individuals.

== Employee relations ==
On February 14, 2024, Endeavor flight attendants picketed at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport and Delta&#x27;s headquarters to bring attention to what they refer to as the &quot;Delta Disparity Difference,&quot; the 45% pay difference between Delta mainline flight attendant pay and those at the regional carrier. Endeavor flight attendants alleged that many of them struggle to make ends meet while Delta paid $1.4 billion profit-sharing bonuses to their mainline employees. In May, 2024, over 1,000 Endeavor Air flight attendants sent a letter to Delta CEO Ed Bastian asking for higher pay. In the letter, Endeavor flight attendants allege that many of them are on public assistance and don&#x27;t feel like a valuable part of Delta.

<text>Mesaba Aviation, Inc. (operating as Mesaba Airlines) was a regional airline in the United States that operated from 1944 until it merged with Pinnacle Airlines in 2012 to form Endeavor Air. It was based in Eagan, Minnesota From 2010 to 2012, the airline was a wholly owned subsidiary of Pinnacle Airlines Corp. with code sharing flights operated as Delta Connection for Delta Air Lines and US Airways Express for US Airways. Previously, the airline operated code sharing service as Northwest Airlink and Northwest Jetlink on behalf of Northwest Airlines which subsequently merged with Delta. Mesaba also previously operated connecting flight services in association with Republic Airlines before this air carrier was subsequently merged into Northwest. Mesaba Airlines effectively ceased operations on January 4, 2012, when all aircraft and personnel were transitioned to the Pinnacle Airlines operating certificate. Mesaba&#x27;s operating certificate was surrendered on July 31, 2012.

==History==
Mesaba (from the Ojibwe language, &quot;misaabe&quot;: &quot;Soaring Eagle&quot;) was founded in 1944 by Gordy Newstrom in the Mesabi Range city of Coleraine, Minnesota and started operations in the same year under the name of Mesaba Aviation. It had one airplane, a Piper Cub purchased for $1,300, and it was used to shuttle employees of the Blandin Paper Mill Company from Grand Rapids, Minnesota to Minneapolis. In 1950 Newstrom moved the company to Grand Rapids.

In 1973, the Halverson family of Duluth, Minnesota, bought Mesaba from Newstrom. Subsequently, they started regularly scheduled airline services serving Spencer, Iowa, Ely, Virginia, and Duluth.

The Swenson family of Thief River Falls, Minnesota, purchased Mesaba Aviation in 1977. They took the company public in 1982 as the airline began flying to destinations in Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota with Beechcraft Model 99 commuter turboprops.

In 1983, Mesaba became a codeshare partner of Republic Airlines, flying regional and commuter turboprop aircraft from small regional communities to the Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport. In 1986, after the merger of Republic Airlines and Northwest Orient Airlines, Mesaba transitioned its codeshare partnership and began operations as a Northwest Airlink carrier on behalf of Northwest Airlines.

Mesaba began feeder service from Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport to small airports across the east and midwest utilizing Fokker F27 and Fairchild Metroliner turboprop aircraft in 1988. Maintenance bases were established both in Detroit and Wausau, Wisconsin. The same year, Mesaba managed to add an additional 325 employees. It also expanded its network to four new routes including Cleveland, Dayton and Akron in Ohio, and Erie, Pennsylvania.

In 1991, Mesaba built two new hangar facilities, in Detroit and Wausau, Wisconsin, and added the first of 25 de Havilland Canada Dash 8 turboprop aircraft, leased from Northwest Airlines.

In 1995, Mesaba and Northwest reached an agreement to provide service with Saab 340 turboprop aircraft. By 1997, Mesaba added additional flights to several new cities including Aspen, Colorado, Bozeman, Montana and Montreal in Canada. In 1999, &quot;Forbes&quot; placed Mesaba at number 41 on their list of Top 200 Small Companies in America.

===Growth into jet operations===

The Northwest Airlines hub in Memphis was exclusively served by Airlink partner Express Airlines I, which later operated as Pinnacle Airlines and is now Endeavor Air, until 1997 when Mesaba initiated its first jet aircraft service using the Avro RJ85, the first jetliner type to be flown by either Airlink airline. The Avro RJ85 jetliner, which was a later model version of the BAe 146-200 featuring an improved cabin and more efficient engines, was operated on Northwest Jetlink flights with the aircraft being configured with 16 first class seats and 53 coach seats. This marked the first time a regional airline had offered first class as well as a coach on a regional jet aircraft. Mesaba was split off at this time into Airways Corporation in order to address objections from mainline pilots flying for Northwest concerning Mesaba&#x27;s operation of a jet fleet. Mesaba also became the first regional airline to have a first class seating option via the Avro RJ85 jet, with this British-built four-engine aircraft being approximately twice as large as the 50-passenger regional jets manufactured by Canadair and Embraer. Eventually, as Pinnacle transitioned to an Bombardier CRJ regional jet fleet, Mesaba took over Northwest Airlink Saab 340 turboprop operations.

In 2000, the company took delivery of its final Avro RJ85 jet, along with eleven new Saab 340 turboprop aircraft. This made Mesaba the operator of the largest fleet of Avro RJ85 aircraft in the world with 36 of the type, and the second-largest operator of the Saab 340.

After the September 11 terrorist attacks, Mesaba was forced to reduce its workforce by 400 employees to achieve cost savings. In the fall of 2003, Northwest wanted to retire the Avro jet fleet, which comprised about half of Mesaba&#x27;s revenue. They were inefficient and aging, according to Northwest. However, Mesaba was able to negotiate a deal with Northwest which enabled the Avro fleet to remain in service. In 2005, Mesaba began receiving fifteen new Canadair CRJ regional jets that would eventually replace the larger Avro jets.

===Bankruptcy===
On September 14, 2005, Northwest Airlines filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy protection. Subsequently, the airline withheld over US$25 million in payments from their regional partners, Mesaba and Pinnacle. Northwest proceeded to announce plans to ground the entire Avro jet fleet by Q1 2007, ten Saab 340B aircraft by January 2006, and also halt the delivery of the 13 remaining CRJs, leaving Mesaba with an awkward and expensive fleet of two aircraft types. Facing rising fuel costs, downsizing plans, and lack of income from Northwest, Mesaba filed for Chapter 11 Bankruptcy on October 13, 2005.

In an interview in January 2006, Mesaba President John Spanjers announced that the Mesaba fleet would be cut in half by the end of the year. Twelve Avro RJ85 jets had already been removed from the fleet, and the balance would be grounded by the end of the year. Ten Saab 340 &quot;B&quot; model aircraft were returned to Pinnacle Airlines (from whom they were leased) during January 2006 while the three remaining &quot;A&quot; model Saab 340&#x27;s and the two Bombardier CRJ regional jets that had been delivered to Mesaba prior to bankruptcy would leave the fleet before mid-year. These changes left Mesaba with a fleet of 49 Saab 340 turboprops.

On April 14, 2006, the company announced reductions of the Avro RJ85 fleet, at Northwest Airlines&#x27; direction. The RJ85 jets ceased flying out of Memphis on June 8, Minneapolis/St. Paul on October 31, and Detroit on December 4, 2006. Separately it was announced that one of the two 50-seat CRJ200 regional jets operated by Mesaba would be transferred to Northwest in order to initiate flying operations (expected in late 2006) for newly formed Northwest Airlines subsidiary Compass Airlines.

By the end of October 2006, all three of the major unions representing the pilots, flight attendants, and mechanics reached tentative agreements that still needed to be approved by the membership. On November 27, 2006, the three unions announced that their membership had ratified the new agreements.

In December 2006, Northwest Airlines planned to purchase Mesaba Airlines from owner MAIR Holdings and operate it as a wholly owned subsidiary. Tentative agreements concerning the sale were made; however, the merger could not have been approved without going through bankruptcy board proceedings and approvals of regulators and various interest groups. On April 24, 2007, Mesaba Airlines emerged from bankruptcy protection and was officially acquired by Northwest Airlines.

With the merging of Northwest Airlines into Delta Air Lines, Mesaba underwent numerous changes as a subsidiary of the new company. A portion of the Saab 340 fleet was relocated to Atlanta. Delta also allocated five more CRJ900 regional jets to Mesaba to be operated out of Delta&#x27;s Salt Lake City hub. In 2009, several routes were added, utilizing the new CRJ900s and the existing Saab 340 aircraft.

===Fined for not deplaning passengers===

On November 24, 2009, Mesaba was one of three airlines, including Continental Airlines and ExpressJet, fined by the US Department of Transportation (DOT) for delaying passengers from deplaning for over six hours overnight in Rochester, MN on August 8, 2009. Mesaba&#x27;s civil penalty was US$75,000, 50% more than the fine for Continental and ExpressJet. It was the first fine ever from the DOT for misconduct related to passengers&#x27; being held in planes on the tarmac for an extended time.

When the ExpressJet flight was diverted to Rochester due to bad weather in Minneapolis, Mesaba personnel in the Rochester terminal agreed in advance to help deplane the passengers. However, when the plane landed, Mesaba personnel reneged, stating that there were no TSA personnel in the terminal. The DOT stated that the rules for such circumstances allow passengers to be deplaned and kept in a secure area, even when there are no TSA personnel available. The DOT ruled that the actions by Mesaba personnel constituted an &quot;unfair and deceptive practice&quot; because they had agreed to deplane the passengers. Continental and ExpressJet were fined because they did not follow their own internal procedures and passenger commitments, and were ultimately responsible for the passengers&#x27; welfare.

Since the incident, the ramp personnel in Rochester along with other ground stations handled by Mesaba, Comair, and Compass, have since been merged and renamed Regional Elite Airline Services (REAS).

===Sale to Pinnacle===
On July 1, 2010, Delta Air Lines sold Mesaba to Pinnacle Airlines Corporation for $62 million. The same day, Pinnacle Airlines Corporation announced that they intended to have Mesaba Airlines operate an all-turboprop fleet, whereas sister company, Pinnacle Airlines, would remain an all-jet operator. It was also announced that Pinnacle&#x27;s other subsidiary, Colgan Air, would cease to exist, and Mesaba would inherit the Colgan fleet of Saab 340s and Bombardier Q400s. In time, all aircraft and personnel were transferred to Pinnacle Airlines.

In 2011, Mesaba Airlines began operating flights out of New York City&#x27;s LaGuardia Airport for US Airways under the US Airways Express brand. This codeshare service utilized Saab 340 aircraft and replaced the service that was being operated by Colgan Air.

Ultimately Colgan&#x27;s Bombardier Q400 turboprops were never transferred to Mesaba as they were retired from service by United Express, whom they operated for on a code sharing basis on behalf of United Airlines, before the transition from Colgan to Mesaba took place.

On January 4, 2012, Mesaba was folded into Pinnacle Airlines. Mesaba&#x27;s operating certificate was surrendered on July 31, 2012. Mesaba Airlines ended operations as one of the world&#x27;s safest air carriers with no fatalities recorded during its 68 years of operations.

==Awards==
In early 1998, in recognition of the successful introduction of two new airliner types to the fleet (the Saab 340 and the Avro RJ85) while maintaining excellent operating performance, Mesaba Airlines was presented with the Air Transport World (ATW) &quot;Regional Airline of the Year for 1997&quot; award. Saab AB painted two new Saab 340 aircraft in special commemorative liveries celebrating both the award and Mesaba&#x27;s 25th anniversary of scheduled airline service.

On August 31, 2005, Mesaba Airlines was named the winner of the 2005 Operational Excellence Award by AIG Aviation, a U.S. based underwriter of aviation insurance. The award has been presented only four times since its creation in 1998 and recognizes clients that exhibit a strong commitment to building quality safety and loss prevention programs. Mesaba was the unanimous selection out of an entry pool of more than 650 companies.

==Destinations==
Over the years, Mesaba grew to operate a fleet of turboprop and turbofan powered airliners from Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport, Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, Memphis International Airport, John F. Kennedy International Airport, Salt Lake City International Airport and Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport on code sharing flights primarily to small-to-medium-sized cities on behalf of its major airline partners.

<doc id="266914" wikidata="Q371306" url="?curid=266914" title="Envoy Air">
<text>Envoy Air Inc. is an American regional airline headquartered in Irving, Texas in the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of the American Airlines Group and it is paid by fellow group member American Airlines to staff, operate and maintain aircraft used on American Eagle flights that are scheduled, marketed and sold by American Airlines.

Envoy Air operates a fleet consisting of exclusively Embraer regional jet aircraft. The company has a team of more than 18,000 employees, operating more than 1,000 daily flights to over 150 destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico, Caribbean and South America.

Envoy was formerly known as American Eagle Airlines and was formed when American&#x27;s parent company merged several airlines owned by the group and operating regional flights. The name was changed to avoid confusion with other regional carriers that operate on behalf of American Eagle. The name &quot;American Eagle Airlines&quot; was also used between April 1980 and April 1981 by an unrelated air charter service that suspended operations and filed bankruptcy before flying any scheduled operations.

== History ==

Envoy began as a collection of regional carriers with contracts to carry the American Eagle brand name. The first American Eagle flight was operated by Metroflight Airlines, which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Metro Airlines (formerly Houston Metro Airlines), on 1 November 1984, from Fayetteville, Arkansas, and Fort Smith, Arkansas, to Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Metroflight utilized Convair 580 turboprop aircraft that had been formerly operated by Frontier Airlines.

Other carriers that have flown in American Eagle livery include Executive Airlines, Command Airways, Air Virginia, Simmons Airlines, Chaparral Airlines and Wings West Airlines. Among other aircraft in its fleet, Chaparral flew Grumman I-C turboprops which were stretched, 37 passenger regional airliner versions of Grumman&#x27;s successful propjet business aircraft and was one of only a few air carriers to ever operate the type in scheduled passenger service.

Until 1987 these third-party carriers flew under contract with American Airlines to provide regional feed to its hubs. During 1987 and 1988 AMR Corp. acquired its regional carriers, starting with Simmons Airlines. AMR&#x27;s final airline d.b.a. American Eagle acquisition was Executive Airlines in 1989.

By mid-1991 AMR had consolidated the number of carriers to four. The May 15, 1998, merger of Wings West and Flagship into Simmons (and the name change of Simmons Airlines to American Eagle Airlines) reduced the number of carriers flying as American Eagle under separate operating certificates to two: American Eagle Airlines and Executive Airlines.

American Eagle Airlines launched its regional jet service in May 1998 using Embraer ERJ 145 aircraft.

AMR struck a codesharing deal with Trans World Airlines (TWA), allowing TWA to sell American Eagle Airlines flights feeding into Los Angeles and later New York&#x27;s JFK Airports. These services were branded by TWA as Trans World Connection flights. These American Eagle Airlines/Trans World agreements were forged well in advance of AMR&#x27;s acquisition of TWA in 2001.

During 2007, AMR began studying ways to spin American Eagle Airlines off into a separate company, including, but not limited to, the possibility of selling the company to stockholders or an unaffiliated third party. In 2008, AMR said any plans had been put on hold until the airline industry stabilized after the 2007–2008 financial crisis. In July 2011, AMR announced the spin-off of American Eagle Airlines, but those plans were again shelved when AMR filed for bankruptcy in November 2011.

On 14 January 2014, American Airlines Group officially announced the rebranding of its American Eagle subsidiary as Envoy. Aircraft operated by American Eagle continued to operate under the current American Eagle branding, but an &quot;Operated by Envoy Air&quot; label was added, similar to the label used by other contract airlines that fly aircraft with American Eagle livery. This name change was created to avoid confusion when American Airlines announced that other regional carriers would operate on behalf of American. The term &#x27;Envoy&#x27; is a reincarnation of the now deprecated Envoy Class of seating on US Airways aircraft.






== Corporate affairs ==

Envoy Air&#x27;s headquarters are in Irving, Texas, in two buildings located north of the northeast portion of DFW Airport. American Eagle was previously headquartered at the American Airlines headquarters in Fort Worth, Texas, and had employees in several buildings: HDQ1, HDQ2, the Systems Operations Control (SOC) center, the DFW American Eagle hangar, the DFW-area warehouse CP-28, the Flight Academy, and the Flagship University. It was scheduled to consolidate operations and move 600 employees from the headquarters, SOC, and training divisions into the Irving offices in July 2014, which were formerly occupied by Epsilon.

== Fleet ==

As of , the Envoy Air fleet consists of the following aircraft:

In September 2009, AMR Corporation announced plans to add a First Class cabin to its fleet of 25 Bombardier CRJ700 regional jets and also signed a letter of intent with Bombardier, Inc. to exercise options for the purchase of 22 additional CRJ700 aircraft for delivery beginning in the middle of 2010.

In January 2014, American Eagle&#x27;s pilots&#x27; union reached an agreement with the regional carrier&#x27;s management that guaranteed 60 of the 90 new Embraer 175 aircraft that American Airlines ordered in December were to be operated by Eagle. The deal included options for 90 other aircraft to be operated by the regional carrier. Delivery of the aircraft would begin in the first quarter of 2015. This deal was voted down by the pilots&#x27; union, the Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA).

Envoy was awarded 40 new Embraer 175 aircraft with 90 options. Deliveries began on November 13, 2015.

In October 2016, Envoy announced that they had taken delivery of two additional Embraer 175 aircraft.

In May 2018, Envoy announced that they had taken delivery of fifteen additional Embraer 175 aircraft between March and November 2019 bringing the total of E175&#x27;s to 69 by the end of 2019.

In November 2018, Envoy announced that they had taken delivery of an additional fifteen Embraer 175 aircraft totaling 84 by mid-2020.

In December 2019, Envoy transferred all of the remaining Bombardier CRJ700 aircraft to PSA Airlines.

In March 2020, it was announced that all twenty of the Embraer 175 aircraft operated by Compass Airlines would be transferred to Envoy upon their closure in April 2020.

In February 2021, American Airlines announced that the remaining ERJ140 fleet belonging to Envoy would end service on May 5, 2021.

On March 1, 2021, Envoy ordered six Embraer 170 jets, expected to enter the fleet in 2021.

On June 20, 2023 at the Paris Air Show, the American Airlines Group ordered seven Embraer 175 jets, on behalf of Envoy Air.

=== Historical turboprop fleet ===
The American Eagle brand operated a variety of twin turboprop aircraft over the years via its various regional and commuter airline partners, including the ATR 42 and ATR 72; Beechcraft Model 99; British Aerospace Jetstream 31 and 32 models; CASA C-212 Aviocar; Convair 580; Fairchild Swearingen Metroliner; Grumman Gulfstream I (stretched G-IC model); NAMC YS-11; Short 330 and Short 360; and the Saab 340.

== Incidents and accidents ==

* January 2006: American Eagle Flight 3008 from San Luis Obispo to Los Angeles, a Saab 340B+ operated by American Eagle Airlines, encountered icing at 11,000 feet and regained control only at 6,500 feet, after some 50 seconds&#x27; descent. During the incident, in which no one was injured, the autopilot disconnected, the stall alarm/clacker sounded, and the plane rolled sharply left and right, experienced vibration, and pitched down. Manual deice boots were activated and ice could be heard shedding off and striking the fuselage. After this incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) issued a safety recommendation which referenced other Saab 340 icing incidents, including the American Eagle Flight 4184 accident.
* On November 11, 2019, American Eagle Flight 4125 slid off the taxiway at Chicago O’Hare Airport after landing on runway 10L in icy conditions. The Embraer 145LR was taken out of the snow later. None of the 41 occupants were injured.
* On October 24, 2020, an American Eagle ERJ-145LR (N674RJ) operating as Envoy Air Flight 4194 from Miami to Freeport, Bahamas had a runway excursion upon landing. Nobody was injured in the crash. The aircraft had suffered main gear damage and the left main broke off.
* On December 31, 2022, a baggage handler employed by Piedmont Airlines, an American Airlines regional carrier, was killed on the ramp at Montgomery Regional Airport when sucked into the jet engine of an Envoy Embraer 175 which was scheduled to fly as American Airlines Flight 3408.

<text>Hyannis Air Service Inc., operating as Cape Air, is an airline headquartered at Cape Cod Gateway Airport in Hyannis, Massachusetts, United States. It operates scheduled passenger services in the Northeast, the Caribbean, Midwest/Wisconsin, and Eastern Montana.

The airline operates its flights as Part 121 Airline &amp; Part 135 public air charters using light aircraft. It has interlining and codeshare agreements with other major carriers for ticketing and baggage transfers. Flights between Hyannis and Nantucket, Massachusetts, are operated under the Nantucket Airlines brand, also operated by Hyannis Air Service, Inc. The company slogan is &quot;We&#x27;re your wings.&quot;

== History ==
Cape Air was co-founded in 1988 by company pilots Craig Stewart and Dan Wolf, and investor Grant Wilson. Initially, Cape Air flew between Provincetown and Boston in Massachusetts, a route that had been recently discontinued by Provincetown-Boston Airlines (PBA) after airline deregulation. Throughout the early 1990s new routes were added to destinations across Cape Cod and southeastern New England. In 1994, Cape Air and Nantucket Airlines merged and now offer hourly flights between Nantucket and Hyannis. 

In 1993, Cape Air began service in Florida with flights operating from Key West International Airport to Naples Municipal Airport. Florida service expanded in 1996 with flights from Key West to both Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport and Southwest Florida International Airport in Fort Myers. Cape Air also began a network in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean in 1998, which were mostly based out of Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

2004 marked the launch year of FAR Part 121 certification and a new hub of operations in Guam. This included a new fleet type consisting of three ATR 42 Turboprop aircraft. The startup team, led by Pacific Administrator, Captain Russell Price, launched scheduled service in July 2004 with the three ATR aircraft and two of the C402. Service was operated as Continental Connection, the regional brand of Continental Airlines, and flights flew from Guam to the Northern Mariana Islands of Saipan and Rota. Due to the International Dateline and the midnight connecting service to/from Japan, it was sometimes referred to as &quot;America&#x27;s First Flight&quot; i.e.: the first departure daily of any airline flight in the United States.

In the 2000s, Cape Air&#x27;s flights in Florida between Fort Myers and Key West also began operating under the Continental Connection banner, though the Cessnas remained in the Cape Air livery. Cape Air also began flying flights for Continental Connection from Tampa International Airport to both Sarasota and Fort Myers (the latter route had been previously operated by Continental Connection carrier Gulfstream International Airlines).

In late 2007, the airline began a new round of expansion in the Northeast and Midwest. On 1 November 2007, the airline began service between Boston and Rutland, Vermont, with three daily round trips. The route is operated under contract with the U.S. government Essential Air Service (EAS) program. With the help of an intrastate minimum revenue guarantee, Cape Air expanded into Indiana on 13 November 2007, offering flights from Indianapolis to Evansville and South Bend. Passenger revenue did not grow quickly enough to make the operation economically sustainable once the revenue guarantee ended, so the last Cape Air flight in Indiana was on 31 August 2008.

Cape Air began flights between Florida Keys Marathon Airport and Fort Myers in 2008 but this service was discontinued a year later. By the end of 2009, Florida service was no longer operated as Continental Connection and flights from Fort Myers to Key West were Cape Air&#x27;s only remaining Florida service. Cape Air ended all intra-Florida flights in 2013.

The airline expanded into upstate New York in early 2008, following the sudden demise of Delta Connection carrier, Big Sky Airlines. Cape Air began flying three daily round-trips on Essential Air Service routes from Boston to the Adirondack cities of Plattsburgh and Saranac Lake on February 12, 2008. The airline continued its expansion into New York when they started to fly the EAS routes out of Albany to Watertown, Ogdensburg, and Massena, and Rutland Airport. Cape Air commenced service from Rockland, Maine, and Lebanon, New Hampshire, to Boston on November 1, 2008. The company purchased four additional Cessna 402s to assist with the major growth.

Cape Air was also looking to offer services on the west coast. Cape Air submitted bids to offer service between Newport and Portland in the state of Oregon. The airline was hoping to be selected by the Newport city council to receive a financial grant to jump-start the service. Ultimately they lost out to SeaPort Airlines, which was able to start service sooner than Cape Air. However, in September 2013, the DOT selected Cape Air to provide EAS service between Billings and five communities in Eastern Montana, including, Sidney, Glendive, Glasgow, Havre and Wolf Point. Service in Montana started on December 10, 2013. The airline also expanded operations in the mid-Atlantic region. Cape Air provided scheduled flights from both the Hagerstown Regional Airport and the Lancaster Airport to the Baltimore/Washington International Airport (BWI). Service out of Baltimore ended in October 2012.

In May 2013, Cape Air named Linda Markham as the new president and chief administrative officer.

Cape Air carried 750,000 passengers in 2014 and offered up to 550 daily flights, achieving revenues of $120 million.
Cape Air is the largest independent regional airline in the United States, with new routes driving steady increases over time.

In 2016, Cape Air started flying from Fort Lauderdale, Florida, to Bimini, Bahamas.

Cape Air flights in Guam continued operating under the United Express branding following the merger of Continental Airlines and United Airlines in 2010. On April 16, 2018, United Airlines announced the end of its partnership with Cape Air. Services ended on May 31, 2018, which marked the end of United Express operations in Guam, along with the retirement of the last turboprop aircraft in the United Express fleet.

By 2023, Cape Air was flying between Chicago’s O’Hare and Manistee County Blacker Airport near Manistee, Michigan, and had codesharing or interline agreements on the route with other carriers including American and United.

=== Pilots ===
In early 2016 the company had canceled flights citing a shortage of pilots. The Air Line Pilots Association disputed the existence of a pilot shortage instead citing low wages as the reason for the lack of pilots. Cape Air takes on pilots as co-pilots after 500-750h in entry-level roles like instructing.
They are promoted to captain after 1,500h as first officers and they can join partners JetBlue or Spirit Airlines after 1,500h again in around two years.
Cape Air also recruits pilots over 65, the mandatory retirement age for FAR Part 121 airlines, so long as they maintain a first-class medical.

===Nantucket Airlines===
In 1994 Cape Air merged with Nantucket Airlines. Since then, Nantucket Airlines has operated as a sister airline to Cape Air focusing on flights between Nantucket Memorial Airport and Barnstable Municipal Airport. Nantucket Airlines utilizes a small sub-fleet of Cessna 402C Businessliners/Utililiners painted in Nantucket Airlines livery.

==Destinations==
===Codeshares===
====JetBlue====
Since February 2007, Cape Air and JetBlue Airways have had an interline agreement. The agreement allows Cape Air to carry JetBlue Airways passengers from Boston&#x27;s Logan Airport and San Juan to Cape Air&#x27;s destinations throughout the Northeast, Florida and the Caribbean. The agreement allows customers on both airlines to purchase seats on both airlines under one reservation. Customers also get their baggage transferred and Cape Air and JetBlue Airways are located in the same terminal in Boston and San Juan which allows for an easy connection.

====American Airlines====
Cape Air and American Airlines (AA) announced a code-sharing agreement for the Caribbean in February 2013. The cities served by the AA codeshare are Anguilla, Nevis, Tortola, Vieques and Mayaguez. In the Midwest, Cape Air and American have had a code sharing agreement since 2010, which allows passengers from Marion, IL, Owensboro, KY, and Kirksville, MO, to connect in St. Louis, MO. This ended on July 31, 2023, and those airports now have service to Chicago, IL via Contour Airlines.

==== United Airlines ====
Cape Air has been a longtime partner with United Airlines (UA) and offers a code sharing agreement for many destinations. Passengers traveling through the Caribbean on select codeshare flights can enjoy special through-fares, advanced boarding passes and the ability to earn miles on a Cape Air flight.

=== Interline agreements ===
Cape Air partners with the following airlines to provide interline flow-through ticketing and baggage transfers:

* Alaska Airlines
* American Airlines
* Condor
* Delta Air Lines
* Hawaiian Airlines
* JetBlue
* Qatar Airways
* United Airlines

=== Seaplane base ===

The airline operates Cape Air Boston Harbor Seaplane Base near Logan International Airport, .

==Fleet==
, Cape Air&#x27;s fleet consists of the following aircraft:

In November 2010, Cape Air announced that it was considering new aircraft types to replace the Cessna 402. In April 2011, Italian aircraft producer Tecnam announced it will be producing the Tecnam P2012 Traveller. The aircraft made its first flight in July 2016. The first aircraft was delivered to Cape Air in March 2019. Cape Air formerly utilized the ATR 42 for United Express operations in Guam. However, when United retired its propeller fleet, the partnership ended between the two airlines. At the 2019 Paris Air Show, Eviation Aircraft announced that Cape Air would add the electric Eviation Alice aircraft to their fleet.
==Accidents and incidents==

*On June 12, 2007, Cape Air grounded its entire Cessna 402C fleet nationwide after three in-flight engine failures. The problem was blamed on premature wear on the crankshaft counterweight. All 402 services were canceled for two days while the counterweights were inspected and replaced as necessary. Normal service resumed about four days after the initial fleet grounding. The FAA stated that they were monitoring repairs, but that all action taken by Cape Air was voluntary and not ordered by the FAA.
*On September 26, 2008, a repositioning flight from Martha&#x27;s Vineyard crashed while en route to Boston. Shortly after takeoff from runway 33, the Cessna 402C plane went down about two and a half miles from the airport, killing the pilot, who was the sole occupant. Prior to this date, Cape Air had maintained a fatality-free record over its 18-year history. The probable cause of the crash was later determined to be a loss of aircraft control due to spatial disorientation.
*On January 22, 2009, a Cape Air 402C with six passengers aboard during a night flight from Key West to Fort Myers, Florida lost power in both engines as a result of fuel starvation due to faulty maintenance of the fuel selector. The aircraft made a successful emergency landing at Naples Municipal Airport.
*On September 9, 2021, a Cape Air 402C with one crew member and six passengers aboard went down in trees on approach to Provincetown Airport, coming from Boston. There were no fatalities, but occupants suffered burns and broken bones. The pilot told investigators that the aircraft was traveling faster than expected and the plane struck trees during an attempt for a go around.
*On September 17, 2024, a Cessna 402C headed to Bar Harbor went back to Boston Logan and landed on one wheel. The pilot and two passengers exited safely.

<doc id="266925" wikidata="Q695215" url="?curid=266925" title="Treaty of Berlin (1926)">
<text>The Treaty of Berlin (German-Soviet Neutrality and Nonaggression Pact) was a treaty signed on 24 April 1926 under which Germany and the Soviet Union pledged neutrality in the event of an attack on the other by a third party for five years. The treaty reaffirmed the German-Soviet Treaty of Rapallo (1922).

Ratifications for the treaty were exchanged in Berlin on 29 June 1926, and it went into effect on the same day. The treaty was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 3 August 1926. It was renewed by additional protocol signed on 24 June 1931, ratified on 5 May 1933. The additional protocol was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 15 February 1935.

==Reactions==
In Germany, the treaty was compared with Bismarck&#x27;s famous Reinsurance Treaty with Russia in 1887. The votes to endorse the treaty in the Foreign Committee of the Reichstag had been unanimous, a first for the Weimar Republic.

#German Chancellor Wilhelm Marx: &quot;intent to adapt German-Russian relationship established at Rapallo to new political situation created by the Locarno treaties&quot;.
#Weimar Republic Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann: &quot;the idea of combining this Locarno policy with a consolidation of our relations with Russia&quot;.
#Soviet Diplomat Maxim Litvinov: &quot;amplification of the Rapallo Treaty&quot;.

==Text==
The German Government and the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics,

Being desirous of doing all in their power to promote the maintenance of general peace,

Being convinced that the interests of the German people and the peoples of the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics demand constant and trustful co- operation,

Having agreed to strengthen the friendly relations existing between them by means of a special Treaty have agreed upon the following provisions:

Article 1
The relations between Germany and the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics shall continue to be based on the Treaty of Rapallo.

The German Government and the Government of the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics will maintain friendly contact in order to promote an understanding with regard to all political and economic questions jointly affecting their two countries.

Article 2
Should one of the Contracting Parties, despite its peaceful attitude, be attacked by one or more third Powers, the other Contracting Party shall observe neutrality for the whole of the duration of the conflict.

Article 3
If on the occasion of a conflict of the nature mentioned in Article 2, or at a time when neither of the Contracting Parties is engaged in warlike operations, a coalition is formed between third Powers with a view to the economic or financial boycott of either of the Contracting Parties, the other Contracting Party undertakes not to adhere to such coalition.

Article 4
The present Treaty shall be ratified and the instruments of ratification shall be exchanged at Berlin.

It shall enter into force on the date of the exchange of the instruments of ratification and shall remain in force for five years. The two Contracting Parties shall confer in good time before the expiration of this period with regard to the future development of their political relations.

In faith whereof the plenipotentiaries have signed the present Treaty.

Signed: Herr Stresemann

Signed: M Krestinski

==Aftermath==
In June 1926, German banks granted the Soviets credits to the total amount of 300 million marks &quot;thanks to the cooperation of the German Government&quot;. Interest was fixed at 9.4% per annum. In October 1926, the Soviet government invited a notable group of Reichstag deputies to Moscow. Georgy Chicherin, visited Berlin at December 1926 and remarked on the improvement of the present German-Soviet relations compared to 1925.

From then on, however, there was a slow decline in relations, with a complete breakdown reached a few months after Hitler&#x27;s 1933 rise to power. Prolongations of the Treaty were signed on 24 June 1931, and in the same year, German banks granted the Soviet Union 300 million marks′ worth of additional credits for purchasing German industrial goods.

<text>United Express is a regional flight service network that supports United Airlines&#x27;s operations, primarily by serving smaller cities and connecting traffic to United&#x27;s main hubs. Representing approximately 6% of United&#x27;s total capacity for 2023, United Express operates through partnerships with regional carriers, including CommuteAir, GoJet, Mesa Airlines, Republic Airways, and SkyWest. These carriers operate under capacity purchase agreements, where United contracts for flight services, pays fixed and performance-based fees, and covers additional costs like fuel and landing fees. The regional carriers operate United-branded flights, following schedules set by the airline, while United manages pricing, revenue, and loyalty programs for passengers.

==Fleet/Airlines==
, the combined United Express-branded fleet consists of the following regional jet aircraft:
In addition to the aircraft in the table above, United owned or leased the following regional aircraft as of December 31, 2024: 6 Bombardier CRJ550, 5 Embraer 175 and 38 ERJ 145XR aircraft that are temporarily grounded and 8 Bombardier CRJ700 awaiting conversion to CRJ550.


==History==

Major airlines in the United States had long maintained relationships with regional carriers which fed passengers from small markets to larger cities. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 spurred industry consolidation, and as the hub system became more pronounced, airlines formalized these relationships through code sharing, co-branding and listing regional partners&#x27; flights in computer reservations systems. 

On May 1, 1985, United formally partnered with Air Wisconsin, Horizon Air, and WestAir as United Express, feeding its hubs at Chicago–O&#x27;Hare, Seattle/Tacoma, and San Francisco, respectively. Aspen Airways joined in 1986 the hub at Denver–Stapleton. Horizon Air was bought by Alaska Airlines in 1987 at which time Horizon&#x27;s contract with United was cancelled and a new carrier, North Pacific Airlines (NPA), was established by WestAir to service the Seattle hub as well as hubs at Portland, Spokane, and Boise. Aspen was dismantled in 1990 being sold to Air Wisconsin and Mesa Airlines. NPA was merged into its parent, WestAir, in 1991. San Juan Airlines of Seattle and SouthCentral Air of Anchorage, Alaska, also operated as United Express from 1987 through 1989. 

In 1988, Presidential Airways became a United Express carrier for United&#x27;s new hub at Washington–Dulles, but quickly floundered. In response, WestAir formed an eastern division to serve Dulles. WestAir itself experienced turmoil; in 1991 it spun off the new division into an independent company, Atlantic Coast Airlines (ACA), which years later would go on to become Independence Air.

In 1990, Mesa Airlines took over all of the United Express routes from Denver formerly operated by Aspen Airways except the Denver to Aspen route which went to Air Wisconsin. Mesa also added a number of new routes from Denver as well. In 1992 Mesa created a new division called California Pacific Airlines to begin new United Express service from the Los Angeles hub. In 1995 Mesa took over all United Express routes at the Seattle and Portland hubs formerly operated by WestAir. Mesa Airlines contract operating as United Express was cancelled in 1998 at which time Air Wisconsin and Great Lakes Airlines took over the Denver routes while SkyWest took over the Los Angeles, Seattle, and Portland routes. 

In 1992, Great Lakes Airlines became a United Express partner, followed by Trans States Airlines the following year. In 1997, as United officially designated Los Angeles one of its hubs, SkyWest Airlines became a United Express partner as well. Great Lakes left the United Express system in early 2002, although it continued to do codeshare flights until they ceased operations in 2018.
 

In 1993, Trans States Airlines started United Feeder Service (UFS), to operate British Aerospace BAe ATP aircraft for United Airlines. The aircraft, originally owned by Air Wisconsin, were transferred and subsequently owned by United. UFS operated routes to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare from close markets in the U.S. Upper Midwest. UFS was eliminated from the United Express carrier network in 1999 and disappeared.

When United declared for Chapter 11 reorganization in 2002, it pressured its regional partners for reduced fees. In 2004, ACA canceled its contract and attempted to reinvent itself as low-cost carrier called Independence Air, but ceased operations only 18 months later. The next year, Air Wisconsin unsuccessfully bid to retain its flying contract, though it did retain some ground-handling United Express operations. To compensate, United initiated new service agreements with Colgan Air, Trans States subsidiary GoJet Airlines, and Republic Airways Holdings subsidiaries Chautauqua Airlines and Shuttle America. Mesa Airlines was also reinstated into the United Express system.

In 2005, United announced that service levels on major United Express routes would be upgraded to a new product called explus. Routes with explus service offer First Class seats and meal service on larger, 70-seat Embraer 170s and 66-seat Bombardier CRJ700s. Expanding the traditional regional partner role, United started to use the airplanes configured with explus amenities instead of, or alongside with, mainline jets on routes linking large cities, such as Chicago to Houston.

United announced a new Express focus city in San Antonio in 2006, but the experiment was short-lived. Trans States was the carrier operating the San Antonio operation.

United decided to cancel Dash 8 and CRJ200 service with Mesa Airlines in November 2009. On November 16, 2009, it was announced that ExpressJet would begin operating Embraer ERJ 145s beginning in the spring of 2010. Mesa Airlines continued service using CRJ700 regional jets and added the Embraer 175 in 2015.

All Continental Express and Continental Connection service officially merged into United Express in late 2010 including that of Cape Air which was operating as Continental Connection on behalf of Continental Micronesia in Guam. Silver Airways was also a Continental Connection carrier that converted to United Express using turbo prop aircraft. Silver operated throughout Florida as well as routes from Washington Dulles Airport however their affiliation as United Express ended in 2013. 

On April 1, 2012, Pinnacle Airlines Corp. filed for bankruptcy and announced it would draw down its Colgan Air operation. In May, United reached a deal with Republic Airways Holdings for its subsidiary Republic Airways to fly the Q400 in Colgan&#x27;s place. The eight-year capacity purchase agreement included all 28 aircraft previously operated by Colgan as well as four currently flown by Republic for Frontier Airlines.

In August 2015, United announced the start of a new subsidiary, United Ground Express (UGS), to provide ground operation service in select airports within its domestic network. UGS has grown to serve 60 United line stations and three hubs.

By September 2016, Republic Airways’ Q400s were phased out of service, replacing them with 50 more Embraer 175s.

On February 27, 2017, United Airlines announced the return of their partnership with Air Wisconsin as a United Express carrier. They would be flying a fleet of 65 Bombardier CRJ200s beginning second-half 2017.

In September 2017, the Q300 was phased out, and in January 2018, the Q200 was phased out. These were the final prop aircraft in the United Express system within the United States.

On April 16, 2018, United Airlines announced the end of its partnership with Cape Air. Services ended on May 31, 2018, which marked the end of United Express operations in Guam, along with the retirement of the last turboprop aircraft in the United Express fleet.

In March 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Trans States Airlines announced that it would be ceasing operations on April 1, 2020, ending its operations as United Express.

On July 30, 2020, it was announced that United Airlines had decided to end its contract with ExpressJet and transferred these operations to CommuteAir. ExpressJet continued its operations until September 30, 2020, and CommuteAir became the sole operator of the United Express Embraer ERJ 145 fleet.

In August 2022, Air Wisconsin announced that it would again be leaving the United Express brand and transferring exclusively to American Eagle. The transition started in March 2023.

United has also selected SpaceX&#x27;s Starlink as its in-flight internet connectivity provider for mainline and two-class regional aircraft in September 2024. This high-speed satellite internet service will enable live streaming, cloud-based work applications, and gaming, with complimentary access provided to all passengers.

United Airlines entered into a sale-leaseback agreement with Mesa Airlines in late 2024 under which United would purchase 18 Embraer 175 aircraft from Mesa for $230 million, then lease those aircraft back to Mesa. The deal involved the transfer of eight E175s by the end of December 2024, with the remaining ten aircraft in early 2025.

;Historical turboprop fleet
The United Express brand, through its various regional and commuter airline partners, operated a variety of twin turboprop aircraft over the years including the following types.
== Accidents and incidents ==
* On February 2, 1988, United Express Flight 3749 from Denver to Durango, CO, operated by Aspen Airways using a Convair 580 aircraft, drifted off a snow-packed runway at night while landing at Durango-La Plata County Airport and crashed into a snowbank. No injuries were reported among the 38 passengers and three crew members on board.
* On December 26, 1989, United Express Flight 2415 operated by North Pacific Airlines, a BAe Jetstream 31 crashed on approach to Tri-Cities Airport near Pasco, Washington. The four passengers and two crew members on board were killed. The crew executed an excessively steep and unstabilized instrument landing system (ILS) approach. That approach, along with improper air traffic control commands and aircraft icing, caused the aircraft to stall and crash short of the runway.
* On January 7, 1994, United Express Flight 6291 operated by Atlantic Coast Airlines, a BAe Jetstream 41 crashed on approach to Port Columbus International Airport. Two passengers and three crew members were killed, while three passengers (a Taiwanese family) survived the accident. The NTSB report concluded the aircraft was never properly stabilized for the approach to runway 28L. The aircraft slowed to a stall, which was not recognized by the flight crew in a timely manner. The subsequent stall recovery was performed contrary to the Airplane Flight Manual procedure, which resulted in the aircraft impacting the ground less than 2 miles from the runway. Furthermore, after investigating the backgrounds of the cockpit crew, the NTSB concluded that Atlantic Coast shouldn&#x27;t have paired an inexperienced first officer with a captain who had a history of failed check rides.
* On November 19, 1996, United Express Flight 5925 operated by Great Lakes Airlines, a Beechcraft 1900C collided with a King Air during landing at Quincy Regional Airport. The ten passengers and two crew members on board were killed. The pilots of the King Air were blamed for failing to effectively monitor both the common frequency and to scan for traffic.
* On April 9, 2017, passenger Dr. David Dao was dragged off of United Express Flight 3411 by law enforcement. He had been selected to be deplaned to make room for deadheading crew, but had refused to give up his seat, stating that he needed to see patients the following day. He suffered a concussion, lost teeth, and a broken nose. The airline later faced criticism and backlash for how the incident was handled.
* On March 4, 2019, United Express Flight 4933 operated by CommuteAir, a Embraer ERJ 145, landed in a snow-covered grassy area to the right of the runway at Presque Isle International Airport and was severely damaged; two passengers and the first officer suffered minor injuries. The accident was attributed to an inadequately reported ILS misalignment combined with &quot;confirmation bias&quot; and fatigue that led the first officer to continue the approach despite being unable to see the runway due to blowing snow.

<text>The Treaty of Rapallo was an agreement signed on 16 April 1922 between the German Reich and Soviet Russia under which both renounced all territorial and financial claims against each other and opened friendly diplomatic relations. The treaty was negotiated by Russian Foreign Minister Georgi Chicherin and German Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau. It was a major victory for Russia especially and also Germany, and a major disappointment to France and the United Kingdom. The term &quot;spirit of Rapallo&quot; was used for an improvement in friendly relations between Germany and Russia.

The treaty was signed in Rapallo. Ratifications were exchanged in Berlin on 31 January 1923, and registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 19 September 1923. The treaty did not include any military provisions, but secret military co-operation was already scheduled between Germany and Russia, which was a violation of the Treaty of Versailles.

A supplementary agreement, signed in Berlin on 5 November, extended the treaty to cover Germany&#x27;s relations with the other Soviet republics: of Ukraine, Belarus, Armenia, Georgia, and Azerbaijan. Ratifications were exchanged in Berlin on 26 October 1923, and the supplementary protocol was registered in &quot;League of Nations Treaty Series&quot; on 18 July 1924. The agreement was reaffirmed by the Treaty of Berlin, 1926.

==Background==
Both Germany and Russia were left vulnerable after the end of the First World War. Germany had lost the war and become diplomatically isolated, and the postwar Treaty of Versailles led to German disarmament and the cession of German territories, including all her colonies. Russia had left the war in 1917 because of the Bolshevik Revolution and ceded many of its western territories to Germany at the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk. After Germany&#x27;s defeat in the war in 1918, the territory was transformed into a number of new independent states, including Poland. Like Germany, Russia was left diplomatically isolated, as its transition to communist rule had led to the loss of western allies as &quot;the policies pursued by the victors, especially France, left no alternative to Germany but to move closer to Russia&quot;.

Germany initially hoped to pursue peaceful changes to the Treaty of Versailles, and its main territorial goal was to reclaim certain portions of western Poland. An initially-conciliatory posture failed in 1919, which led Germany to institute an economic blockade of Poland in January 1920. The effort to force changes also failed and led to severe losses for German businessmen. Those failures led Germany to look for other alternatives, which reached their most extreme form in the proposal of Hans von Seeckt, the commander of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot; (German military), who suggested for Germany and Russia to conclude an alliance for a joint invasion of Poland and then a war on France. His proposals did not have much impact on official policy, but the general idea of seeking closer cooperation with Russia began to gain currency among a number of groups, including German businessmen who saw market opportunities there.

Like Germany, Russia hoped to make territorial gains at Poland&#x27;s expense but was left without an effective means of doing so. In early 1919, the Polish–Soviet War had broken out over border disputes. After initial Russian victories, the Poles counterattacked successfully, and a compromise peace was reached in March 1921, which left Soviet desires for border revision largely unfulfilled. The war also left the Russians even further isolated from Britain and France.

The common isolation and interest in revision in Poland led to a natural sympathy between Russia and Germany. At the Tenth Party Conference in 1921, the Russians settled on a policy of pursuing opportunities for trade with the Western powers, which could supply badly needed industrial materials:
The joint German–Russian concerns first led to the signing in May 1921 of a treaty under which Germany recognised the Soviet regime as the only legitimate government of Russia and agreed to suspend relations with all other Russian groups that still claimed power. The treaty paved the way for future German–Russian co-operation.

==Negotiations==

British Prime Minister David Lloyd George and French Prime Minister Aristide Briand feared that the terms of the 1919 Treaty of Versailles were too harsh on Germany, would prevent its full economic recovery and would hurt all of Europe. Both men needed a diplomatic victory to secure their shaky political status. They called a new international &quot;Economic and Financial Conference&quot; of 34 nations in the Italian city of Genoa in April 1922. All the major countries were invited, but the United States refused to attend. Also not invited were the two pariah nations of Germany and Soviet Russia; in the latter, Communists had recently won a civil war. 

Lloyd George, excessively confident in his own diplomatic skills, brought along no senior members from the British Foreign Office. To his consternation, there was a change in the French government. The new prime minister, Raymond Poincaré, was aggressively hostile to Germany. He felt that the terms of the reparations demanded of Germany were not harsh enough and would allow an economic recovery for France&#x27;s great enemy. Poincaré replaced Lloyd George&#x27;s ideas with a scheme to hurt Germany and planned to work with the Russians, who had not been represented at Versailles but were allowed to ask for reparations. Before 1917, Western European financial interests had made heavy loans and investments in Tsarist Russia, which the new communist regime refused to honour. Because of that refusal to pay the old debts, Russia was economically and politically isolated from the rest of the world. Poincaré&#x27;s scheme, which was kept secret from the Germans, would involve an entirely-new round of financial reparations to be paid by Germany to the Russians, and in turn, the Russians would use that money to pay off those old debts. Russia&#x27;s leader, Vladimir Lenin, had reversed earlier plans to organize anticapitalist revolutions across Europe and now sought a peaceful interlude of economic development. His New Economic Policy would necessitate extensive trade with the outside world. However Lenin was in poor health and left Russian foreign policy to Georgy Chicherin, a brilliant diplomat who proved the most effective negotiator of them all.

Russia had already started collaboration with a German military in a project so secret that the German civilian government and diplomats did not know about it, but it made Moscow much more favourable toward a friendly deal with Germany. Furthermore France was trying to impose strict controls on Russian trade. In the German government, attitudes were split between the &quot;Easterners&quot;, who wanted closer ties with Russia and included many diplomats and the socialists, and the &quot;Westerners&quot;, who gave priority to normalising relations with Britain and France. Foreign Minister Walther Rathenau, the head of the German delegation, was a committed Westerner but was open to argument. While the main conference was dragging on in Genoa, the Russian and the German delegations secretly met at Rapallo, a nearby small resort city, and quickly signed a treaty involving mutual diplomatic recognition, cancellation of debts owed in each direction and pledges to increase economic ties. 

The Rapallo Treaty provided diplomatic cover for military cooperation, which was kept top secret, and allowed Germany to rebuild its military arsenal in Russia with the establishment of a flying school at Lipetsk, the building of a chemical weapons plant at Volsk, a tank school near Kazan, two factories for the production of tanks near Moscow and Rostov-on-Don and joint battlefield manoeuvres. In return, Russian officers could be trained undercover in German military academies. The military entente was underpinned by a trading agreement whereby German banks offered credit lines to Russia to buy military and industrial machinery and supplies, and Russia could export vast quantities of grain.

The Rapallo Treaty was a stunning surprise. Its news caused the collapse of the main conference at Genoa. Lloyd George and Poincaré denounced the treaty vehemently.

==Historical lessons==
Over the next century, the term &quot;Rapallo&quot; came to have very different lessons for different groups of concerned observers and scholars. In Britain and France and the smaller nations of Europe, it became the symbol of a sinister German–Soviet conspiracy to control Europe, a theory underscored by the 1939 Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, a non-aggression pact between Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union and a key event in the run-up to the outbreak of the Second World War in Europe. For Germany, “Rapallo” symbolized a hopeful independent foreign policy of cleverly playing off Eastern and Western Europe so that the defeated nation could escape harsh repression. For the Soviet Union, “Rapallo” was the first great Communist diplomatic triumph, showed how the weaker nation could use pacifism to outmanoeuvre bourgeois enemies and gave the underdog regime an opportunity for normal diplomatic and commercial relations while it secretly built up military prowess.

==Text of agreement==

The German Government, represented by Dr Walther Rathenau, Minister of State, and the Government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, represented by M. Tchitcherin, People&#x27;s Commissary, have agreed upon the following provisions:Article 1 The two Governments are agreed that the arrangements arrived at between the German &quot;Reich&quot; and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic, with regard to questions dating from the period of war between Germany and Russia, shall be definitely settled upon the following basis:

[a] The German &quot;Reich&quot; and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic mutually agree to waive their claims for compensation for expenditure incurred on account of the war, and also for war damages, that is to say, any damages which may have been suffered by them and by their nationals in war zones on account of military measures, including all requisitions in enemy country. Both Parties likewise agree to forgo compensation for any civilian damages, which may have been suffered by the nationals of the one Party on account of so-called exceptional war measures or on account of emergency measures carried out by the other Party.

[b] Legal relations in public and private matters arising out of the state of war, including the question of the treatment of trading vessels which have fallen into the hands of either Party, shall be settled on a basis of reciprocity.

[c] Germany and Russia mutually agree to waive their claims for compensation for expenditure incurred by either party on behalf of prisoners of war. Furthermore, the German Government agrees to forgo compensation within regard to the expenditure incurred by it on behalf of members of the Red Army interned in Germany. The Russian Government agrees to forgo the restitution of the proceeds of the sale carried out in Germany of the army stores brought into Germany by the interned members of the Red Army mentioned above.

Article 2Germany waives all claims against Russia which may have arisen through the application, up to the present, of the laws and measures of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic to German nationals or their private rights and the rights of the German &quot;Reich&quot; and states, and also claims which may have arisen owing to any other measures taken by the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic or by their agents against German nationals or the private rights, on condition that the government of the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic does not satisfy claims for compensation of a similar nature made by a third Party.

Article 3Diplomatic and consular relations between the German Reich and the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic shall be resumed immediately. The conditions for the admission of the Consuls of both Parties shall be determined by means of a special agreement.

Article 4 Both Governments have furthermore agreed that the establishment of the legal status of those nationals of the one Party, which live within the territory of the other Party, and the general regulation of mutual, commercial and economic relations, shall be effected on the principle of the most favoured nation. This principle shall, however, not apply to the privileges and facilities which the Russian Socialist Federal Soviet Republic may grant to a Soviet Republic or to any State which in the past formed part of the former Russian Empire.

Article 5 The two Governments shall co-operate in a spirit of mutual goodwill in meeting the economic needs of both countries. In the event of a fundamental settlement of the above question on an international basis, an exchange of opinions shall previously take place between the two Governments. The German Government, having lately been informed of the proposed agreements of private firms, declares its readiness to give all possible support to these arrangements and to facilitate their being carried into effect.

Article 6 Articles 1[b] and 4 of this Agreement shall come into force on the day of ratification, and the remaining provisions shall come into force immediately.Original text done in duplicate at Rapallo on 16 April 1922

<text>Air Wisconsin Airlines is a regional airline based at Appleton International Airport in the town of Greenville, Wisconsin near Appleton, Wisconsin. The company began operations as a United Express partner in 1965 on behalf of United Airlines and merged with United Airlines in 1985. The partnership with United ended in 2005 at which time the airline became a feeder for US Airways, operating as US Airways Express. When US Airways merged into American Airlines in 2015, Air Wisconsin became an American Eagle affiliate. From March 2018 to April 2023, Air Wisconsin returned to operate as a United Express carrier, with hubs at Chicago–O&#x27;Hare International Airport (ORD) and Washington–Dulles. In April 2023, it shifted back once again to operating only for American Eagle. The agreement with American is set to conclude in April 2025, after which the airline plans to transition to only flying charter and Essential Air Service subsidized flights.

== History ==



In 1963 investors from the Fox Cities raised $110,000 to start a new airline. The airline was established as an independent commuter air carrier in 1965 and started operations on August 23, 1965, just one day after the brand new Outagamie County Regional Airport was opened using de Havilland Dove commuter aircraft configured with nine passenger seats. It was founded to connect Appleton with Chicago and initially had 17 employees and two de Havilland Dove aircraft. According to the August 23, 1965, Air Wisconsin timetable, the airline was flying one route between Appleton and Chicago–O&#x27;Hare with four round trips on weekdays and two round trips on Saturdays and Sundays operated with the British-manufactured Dove twin prop aircraft.

By the mid 1970s, Air Wisconsin was flying two small commuter turboprop airliner types, the de Havilland Canada DHC-6 and Fairchild Metroliner, and was operating a small hub at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare Airport with service primarily to destinations in Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin as well as to Minneapolis/Saint Paul from several small cities in Wisconsin.

In September 1978 the airline was certified by the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) as a regional air carrier (Air Wisconsin previously had commuter air carrier status with the CAB). In October 1978 it had over $10 million in assets. Joining Air Wisconsin in 1965 as traffic manager and eventually becoming president, Preston H. Wilbourne&#x27;s leadership oversaw Air Wisconsin grow to an airline serving 29 cities in an eleven state area with 32 aircraft boarding over 10,000 passengers daily. Air Wisconsin gained the nicknames &quot;Air Willy&quot; and &quot;Rag Tag&quot; and more recently &quot;Air Wis&quot; and &quot;Air Wisky&quot;.

By 1985, Air Wisconsin had become a large independent regional air carrier operating BAe 146-200 and British Aircraft Corporation BAC One-Eleven jets as well as de Havilland Canada Dash 7 turboprops with flights as far west as Grand Island, Nebraska, and Minneapolis/Saint Paul, and as far east as Bridgeport and New Haven, Connecticut, with a large connecting hub located at Chicago&#x27;s O&#x27;Hare Airport (ORD). By early 1986, the airline was serving sixteen airports with its British-manufactured jets with flights to Appleton, Bridgeport, Cedar Rapids, Iowa, Chicago–O&#x27;Hare, Flint, Michigan, Fort Wayne, Indiana, Grand Island, Green Bay, Wisconsin, Kalamazoo, Michigan, Lincoln, Nebraska, Moline, Illinois/Quad Cities, New Haven, South Bend, Indiana, Toledo, Ohio, Waterloo, Iowa, and Wausau/Stevens Point, Wisconsin, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, with other flights and destinations in its route system being served with the Canadian-manufactured four engine Dash 7 turboprop.

Air Wisconsin pioneered the concept of code sharing on behalf of United Airlines when the carrier began operating as United Express on May 1, 1985. As an independent air carrier prior to its business agreement with United to provide passenger feed, Air Wisconsin rapidly became the nation&#x27;s largest regional airline in the 1980s. On May 17, 1985, it merged with Mississippi Valley Airlines (MVA) and continued to fly as United Express, operated by Air Wisconsin.

By late 1989 Air Wisconsin was operating United Express code share service from two United hubs: Chicago–O&#x27;Hare (ORD) and Washington–Dulles (IAD). According to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) at this time, United Express flights were operated with BAe 146-200 jets and Fokker F27 turboprops nonstop to Chicago–O&#x27;Hare from Akron/Canton, Ohio, Appleton, Cedar Rapids, Champaign, Illinois, Fort Wayne, Green Bay, Kalamazoo, La Crosse, Wisconsin, Lansing, Michigan, Lexington, Kentucky, Moline/Quad Cities, Oshkosh, Wisconsin, Peoria, Illinois, Roanoke, Virginia, South Bend, Toledo, and Wausau, and with BAe 146-200 jets and Short 360 turboprops nonstop to Washington Dulles from Charleston, West Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, and Richmond, Virginia, as well as Harrisburg, Reading, and State College, Pennsylvania.

In 1990 Air Wisconsin acquired Denver-based Aspen Airways and was itself bought by United Airlines a year later.

During the 1990s, Air Wisconsin operated British Aerospace (BAe) ATP turboprop aircraft as well as BAe 146-100, BAe 146-200, and BAe 146-300 jet aircraft on United Express services. These were all large aircraft types when compared to other regional aircraft in operation at the time. Air Wisconsin was the only U.S. operator of the BAe ATP turboprop and also the BAe 146–300, which is the largest member of the BAe 146 family of jet aircraft. United Airlines sold Air Wisconsin and the BAe 146 fleet to CJT Holdings in 1993. Air Wisconsin was then renamed Air Wisconsin Airlines Corporation (AWAC) as UAL retained the rights to the Air Wisconsin name and logo. During the ski seasons, Air Wisconsin was operating BAe 146 jet shuttle service as United Express on the former Aspen Airways route between Aspen, Colorado, and Denver with at least fourteen daily nonstop flights in each direction.

In February 1998 AWAC acquired the assets of Mountain Air Express including Dornier 328 turboprop aircraft which were used to expand United Express service in the west. In the fall of 2003 AWAC acquired ten Bombardier CRJ jet aircraft from bankrupt Midway Airlines and became a feeder for AirTran Airways under the name AirTran JetConnect, but this relationship was discontinued in July 2004. Towards the end of the contract with United Airlines Air Wisconsin was unable to secure a long-term deal or extension to continue providing regional service for UAL. United failed to renew its contract with AWAC, allowing it to expire in April 2005, and the last flight under the United flag operated on April 16, 2006, using the BAe 146.

During 2005 AWAC invested $175 million U.S. into US Airways for their bankruptcy exit financing in exchange for a long-term contract operating as US Airways Express. In 2005 AWAC began operating all of its CRJ200 regional jets as a US Airways Express carrier with flight crew bases located in Philadelphia, New York LaGuardia, Washington Reagan National, and Norfolk, Virginia. US Airways merged with American Airlines in 2015 and Air Wisconsin operated as an American Eagle regional air carrier via a code sharing agreement with American until March 2018.

On November 20, 2014, it was reported that Air Wisconsin was nearing an agreement with Delta Air Lines to fly as a Delta Connection carrier beginning in January 2015. Under the terms of the deal, 26 CRJ200 aircraft were to be transferred to Air Wisconsin from Endeavor Air. In January 2015, Air Wisconsin said that negotiations had ended and that it did not want to fly under the Delta Connection brand.

In 2016, it was announced that Air Wisconsin would close all of its ground handling operations in all cities served by the air carrier primarily due to the formation of a wholly-owned subsidiary of United called United Ground Express. This would leave only three American Eagle ground handling cities served, which the airline deemed uneconomical.

On March 1, 2017, Air Wisconsin announced a new agreement with United Airlines to once again operate under the United Express banner upon the expiration of the airline&#x27;s current agreement with American Eagle in 2018. Additionally, the new agreement with United would provide for the creation of a career pathway program whereby Air Wisconsin pilots would be offered the opportunity to move up to United upon meeting its hiring standards.

In September 2021, the company announced that they had signed a lease for at least 1 Bombardier CRJ200SF (converted cargo aircraft) set to enter service from December 2021. The aircraft was never delivered and the cargo program has most likely been canceled.

On August 22, 2022, Air Wisconsin announced a five-year contract to operate up to 60 CRJ200s for American Eagle, starting in March of 2023. These aircraft are based at Chicago-O&#x27;Hare, to fill in for the Envoy Air ERJ 145s that will be transferred over to Piedmont Airlines. The airline also plans to utilize some CRJ700s. This ended their partnership with United Airlines.

On January 10, 2025, Air Wisconsin announced it is terminating its CRJ-200 operations for American Airlines to pursue independent operations providing charter and Essential Air Service subsidized flights. It is anticipated that American and Air Wisconsin will continue an interline and codeshare relationship. 

On January 31, 2025, Air Wisconsin released a statement that due to their business shift in operations, they would lay off more than 500 workers across Wisconsin. The majority of those workers listed are currently based in Milwaukee or Appleton, Wisconsin. Additional notices on February 3, 2025 stated that more than 200 employees will also be laid off at both Dayton International Airport and at Chicago O&#x27;Hare.

<doc id="266934" wikidata="Q638066" url="?curid=266934" title="Independence Air">
<text>Independence Air was a low-cost airline, owned by FLYi, Inc., headquartered in the Loudoun Gateway Corporate Center in Dulles, Virginia, United States (near Washington, D.C.) that operated from 1989 until 2006. Its route network focused on the east coast of the United States, but it also extended to the west coast. The route network was based at Washington Dulles International Airport.

It ceased all operations at 20:24 UTC-5 on January 5, 2006. The airline had been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy since November 7, 2005. 

==History==
Independence Air started life as Atlantic Coast Airlines on December 15, 1989, operating feeder services as United Express for United Airlines and Delta Connection for Delta Air Lines. After United withdrew the contract when the ACA labor and management would not agree to the concessions it requested, Atlantic Coast reinvented itself as low-cost carrier Independence Air. It was announced on November 19, 2003, and operations as Independence Air began on June 16, 2004. At its inception, it was unique among low-cost carriers in that its fleet mainly consisted of 50-seat regional jets, although the airline later introduced larger Airbus A319 equipment. It was based at Washington Dulles International Airport (IAD) and contributed to Dulles&#x27; substantial increase in passenger use, bringing one million new customers to the airport in its first three months of operation. The airline was also credited with helping to reduce fares to and from the airport, and it took time after the airline&#x27;s shutdown for the traffic volume to recover.

===Criticism===
From the beginning, the airline faced criticism including that it expanded too quickly, had a poor fleet mix and did not have the resources to compete with the legacy airlines, who despite their own financial troubles, would match the fares offered by Independence. Further, industry experts believed that the reasons behind the airline&#x27;s failure were not problems with the low-cost strategy, but miscues on the part of airline management. Atlantic Coast&#x27;s / Independence Air&#x27;s former partner at Dulles, United Airlines, responded vigorously to Independence Air&#x27;s emergence as a stand-alone carrier by leveraging Washington area passenger loyalty to the United Mileage Plus frequent flyer program. United offered its Mileage Plus members substantial bonuses, including free trips around the world on United and other Star Alliance carriers; these proved effective in maintaining United&#x27;s grip on the lucrative business travel market, and Independence Air could not respond to United&#x27;s promotional onslaught. (United&#x27;s primary offer for free flights based on a sliding scale of flight segments to/from a Washington airport - IAD, DCA, BWI. 24 segments yielded a United coach ticket, 48 segments yielded a Star Alliance round-the-world business class ticket.) Problems, including flights flying far below capacity, were identified in October 2004, less than six months following the airline&#x27;s launch as the parent company attempted to avoid bankruptcy.

===Promotional activities===
On May 20, 2004, even prior to its inaugural flight, Independence Air signed a deal with the Washington Redskins to become the official airline sponsor of the team for three years. In the summer of 2005, the airline offered college students the GLiDE Summer Travel Pass. This move was meant not to bring in revenue, but to try to fill seats that otherwise would have flown empty. This promotional tool was not enough to prevent trouble, due in part to the airline losing almost $150 million in its two years of operation.

Independence Air became quickly known for the humorous touches it added to the flying experience, such as replacing the flight attendant safety announcements with prerecorded versions of the warnings by celebrities such as James Carville and Mary Matalin. They also attracted attention from their partnership with the Laugh Factory and the use of former baggage handler Dave George as &quot;the Flyi Guy&quot; — the airline&#x27;s resident comedian.

==Corporate affairs==
===Headquarters===
Independence Air had its headquarters in Loudoun Gateway III in the Loudoun Gateway Corporate Center in Dulles, unincorporated Loudoun County, Virginia. The facility is located at the intersection of Virginia Route 28 and Virginia Route 606, north of the Dulles Toll Road and near Washington Dulles International Airport. The three-story, building has an about 25,000 RSF floor plate. The entire Loudoun Gateway Corporate Center has about of space. Grubb &amp; Ellis had originally leased of the building to Atlantic Coast Airlines.

==Fleet==

From the airline&#x27;s beginning, its fleet mix was cited as one of the causes of its financial troubles. Independence Air&#x27;s fleet ebbed and flowed in an attempt to stay in business. In February 2005, the airline canceled the lease on more than 20 Bombardier CRJ200 jets and British Aerospace Jetstream 41 turbo-prop planes.

At the time of its last flight, Independence had 42 planes, down from a peak of 87.

===Historical fleet===
Independence Air previously operated the following aircraft:

==Decline==
After its emergence as an independent brand name, Independence Air became known for offering very low airfares: as little as $29 one-way to Florida from Washington Dulles International Airport. However, the company never overcame a series of financial problems during its transition, and its decline started only six months after its launch.

In February 2005, one of its aircraft was repossessed after the company missed a lease payment, after trying and failing to restructure the lease. Later that year, three more aircraft were sold or repossessed and in November 2005, FLYi, Inc., their parent company, declared bankruptcy. The company cited rising costs in the airline industry as the reason its low-cost strategy did not succeed.

In the intervening months between FLYi&#x27;s declaration of bankruptcy and Independence Air&#x27;s cessation of operations, a number of airlines expressed an interest in acquiring the airline&#x27;s assets including: Mesa Air Group, United Airlines and Richard Branson.

Not finding a suitable buyer in time to keep the planes flying, Independence Air announced on January 2, 2006, that it would cease operations at 7:26 p.m. UTC-5 on January 5, 2006, following a flight from Westchester County Airport in New York. When the airline ceased operations, it employed more than 2,500 staff,
 many of whom had been with the airline since its inception as Atlantic Coast Airlines. Over its 18 months of operation, Independence carried more than 8 million passengers.

On March 10, 2006, Northwest Airlines bought the operating certificate of Independence Air for $2 million to establish a new regional airline. On March 29, 2006, Northwest reported that Independence Air would be renamed Compass Airlines. The first flight route would be a twice daily service between Washington Dulles International Airport and Minneapolis-Saint Paul International Airport beginning in early June 2006.

==Destinations==
At the time of its shutdown on January 5, 2006, Independence operated 200 daily departures to 37 destinations throughout the United States, up from 78 flights at its launch.

<doc id="266937" wikidata="Q152925" url="?curid=266937" title="Locarno Treaties">
<text>The Locarno Treaties were seven post-World War I agreements negotiated amongst Germany, France, Great Britain, Belgium, Italy, Poland and Czechoslovakia in late 1925. In the main treaty, the five western European nations pledged to guarantee the inviolability of the borders between Germany and France and Germany and Belgium as defined in the Treaty of Versailles. They also promised to observe the demilitarized zone of the German Rhineland and to resolve differences peacefully under the auspices of the League of Nations. In the additional arbitration treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia, Germany agreed to the peaceful settlement of disputes, but there was notably no guarantee of its eastern border, leaving the path open for Germany to attempt to revise the Versailles Treaty and regain territory it had lost in the east under its terms. 

The Locarno Treaties significantly improved the political climate of western Europe from 1925 to 1930 and fostered expectations for continued peaceful settlements which were often referred to as the &quot;spirit of Locarno&quot;. The most notable result of the treaties was Germany&#x27;s acceptance into the League of Nations in 1926. 

The treaties effectively went out of force on 7 March 1936 when troops of Nazi Germany entered the demilitarized Rhineland and the other treaty signatories failed to respond. 

== Background ==

Under the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, Germany lost 13% of its European territory and 12% of its population, primarily to France (Alsace–Lorraine) and a restored Poland. In order to make sure that Germany could no longer threaten France militarily, its territory west of the Rhine was occupied by Allied troops and all German military activity in the region prohibited; an area fifty kilometres east of the Rhine was also demilitarized. Germany had not been allowed to participate in the treaty negotiations and deeply resented what it considered to be the humiliating terms. Revising the Versailles Treaty became the main goal of German foreign policy during the Weimar Republic.

==Foreign policy goals==
Germany thought that only by revising the Treaty of Versailles could it restore the full internal and diplomatic independence it had lost under the treaty&#x27;s restrictions. Gustav Stresemann, who had been chancellor and foreign minister of Germany in late 1923 and then stayed on as foreign minister in the following cabinets, had hoped that by attempting to fulfil the terms of the treaty he could gain the goodwill of the Allies and restore some freedom of diplomatic movement. He wanted to secure the peace, especially with France, recover the land lost to Poland, end reparations payments and the occupation of the Rhineland, and by so doing gradually make Germany a great power again.

For its part, France was concerned primarily with security against further German aggression. It had signed treaties with Poland, Czechoslovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia, creating a &quot;cordon sanitaire&quot; ringing Germany on the east. In the west, France had occupied the Ruhr in order to force the reparations payments, which Germany had defaulted on several times. France was also seeking additional security guarantees from Britain. 

British foreign policy during the interwar years was radically different from France&#x27;s. It sought to restore Germany as a peaceful, prosperous nation. Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain hoped that if Franco-German relations improved, France would gradually abandon its . Once France had ended its alliances in Eastern Europe as the price of better relations with Germany, Poland and Czechoslovakia would have no great power ally to protect them and would be forced to adjust to German demands. Chamberlain believed that the chances for a lasting peace in Europe would improve after they handed over the territories claimed by Germany such as the Sudetenland, the Polish Corridor and the Free City of Danzig.

==Initiation of the treaties==
The push for the Locarno Treaties came as an indirect result of the Allies&#x27; refusal to withdraw their troops from the Cologne region and areas of the occupied Rhineland to the north of it. The Treaty of Versailles stipulated the withdrawal five years after the signing of the treaty if Germany had faithfully fulfilled its terms. An Allied inspection of Germany&#x27;s military installations had found significant violations of Versailles&#x27; disarmament provisions, most notably its failure to adhere to the 100,000-man limit on its army. As a result, the planned withdrawal was postponed. On 5 January 1925, the Allies justified their decision in a note with vague references to German &quot;breaches of the disarmament clauses of the Treaty of Versailles&quot;.

In order to resolve the issue, German foreign minister Stresemann sent secret memorandums to Great Britain (January 1925) and France (in February) suggesting a treaty which would require all parties interested in the Rhine borders to solve their issues peacefully. Germany, he stated, was ready to guarantee the current border status and to conclude an arbitration pact with France. Privately, Stresemann hoped that settling border issues with France would make it possible for Germany to adjust its eastern border with Poland to Germany&#x27;s advantage.

Following Great Britain&#x27;s muted expression of openness to the German proposal, France cautiously followed suit. It wanted Belgium to be included in the treaty and assumed that it would not go into effect until Germany joined the League of Nations. A French condition that particularly concerned Germany asked that the signers of the treaty on Germany&#x27;s western border be guarantors of the arbitration treaties Germany would sign with Poland and Czechoslovakia. Germany agreed to accept France&#x27;s conditions with the important reservation that it would not make guarantees about its eastern borders. Great Britain also did not support France on the issue. Stresemann&#x27;s diplomatic feelers faced strong opposition at home, especially regarding the renunciation of Germany&#x27;s claim to Alsace–Lorraine, which was west of the Rhine. The objections came from Chancellor Hans Luther, Defence Secretary Otto Gessler, the political parties of the Right and the leadership of the &quot;Reichswehr&quot;. 

Following discussions in London in early September between representatives of Great Britain, France, Germany, Belgium and Italy, the parties agreed to meet in Locarno, Switzerland in October to finalize the treaty.

== Parties and agreement ==

=== Attendees ===

The key attendees at the Locarno meeting between 5 and 16 October 1925 were:

Signatories of the main treaty (the &quot;high contracting parties&quot; referred to in the text of the treaty):

* Germany: Chancellor Hans Luther and Foreign Minister Gustav Stresemann
* France: Minister of Foreign Affairs Aristide Briand
* Great Britain: Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain
* Belgium: Minister of Foreign Affairs Emile Vandervelde
* Italy: Senator Vittorio Scialoja, with periodic attendance by Prime Minister Benito Mussolini
Signatories of the four separate treaties (in addition to Germany and France)::
* Poland: Minister of Foreign Affairs Aleksander Skrzyński
* Czechoslovakia: Foreign Minister Edvard Beneš

=== Treaties and agreements ===
The seven treaties and agreements were:

* Treaty of mutual guarantee between Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain and Italy (main treaty)
* Arbitration agreements between:
** Germany and France
** Germany and Belgium
* Arbitration treaties (rather than agreements because they were not addenda to the main treaty) between: 
** Germany and Poland
** Germany and Czechoslovakia
* Separate treaties between
** France and Poland
** France and Czechoslovakia

=== Main terms of the treaty of mutual guarantee ===
* Germany, France, Great Britain, Belgium and Italy guaranteed to maintain the inviolability of the borders between Germany and Belgium and between Germany and France as established by the Treaty of Versailles. They also pledged to observe the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland as defined in Articles 42 and 43 of the Treaty of Versailles.
* Germany and Belgium, and also Germany and France, mutually promised that they would in no case resort to war against each other. Three exceptions were allowed, including breach of the terms of the demilitarized Rhineland.
* Germany, France and Belgium resolved to settle disputes peacefully with the involvement of the League of Nations Council.
* Articles 4 and 5 spelled out the mutual guarantees of the provisions and the actions to be taken against a signatory who violated the treaty. The League of Nations was to play a central role in adjudicating violations. If it determined that a breach had occurred, the other signatories were to assist the country against which the violation had taken place.

=== Arbitration agreements and treaties ===

==== Germany–France and Germany–Belgium ====

The terms of the two arbitration agreements were identical and were intended to peacefully handle &quot;all disputes of every kind between Germany and France / Belgium with regard to which the parties are in conflict as to their respective rights, and which it may not be possible to settle amicably by the normal methods of diplomacy.&quot; Each arbitration agreement set up a five-member Permanent Conciliation Commission with one member named by Germany, one by France or Belgium and three others by common agreement from three different countries. If the Permanent Conciliation Commission(s) were not able to reach an agreement, the matter was to be passed to either the Permanent Court of International Justice or an arbitral tribunal as established by the Hague Convention of 1907. If the two parties had not been able to reach an agreement within a month after the Permanent Conciliation Commission finished its work, either party could request that the question be brought before the Council of the League of Nations. 

The parties could choose to bypass the Permanent Conciliation Commissions and go directly to the Permanent Court of International Justice or an arbitral tribunal.

==== Germany–Poland and Germany–Czechoslovakia ====
The arbitration treaties between Germany and Poland and Germany and Czechoslovakia were in their major points nearly identical to Germany&#x27;s arbitration agreements with France and Belgium. The independent treaties with Poland and Czechoslovakia were, however, non-binding, and there was no guarantee of Germany&#x27;s eastern borders that mirrored the statements in the main treaty that fixed its western borders where they had been set by the Treaty of Versailles. Stresemann did not want an &quot;Eastern Locarno&quot;. His goal was to use economic means to push Poland into border negotiations.

Poland especially was unhappy about the addendum to the Locarno Treaties titled &quot;Collective Note to Germany Regarding Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations&quot;. Article 16 required member nations to participate in sanctions or military action against a country that attacked a member state of the League. The Collective Note stated that the League would take into consideration a country&#x27;s military capability when invoking Article 16. Germany interpreted the note to mean that after it joined the League of Nations, it would be free to make its own decision on how to respond if the League invoked Article 16 against the Soviet Union (e.g. for attacking Poland).

=== France–Poland and France–Czechoslovakia ===
The treaties between France and Poland and France and Czechoslovakia guaranteed mutual assistance under Article 16 of the Covenant of the League of Nations if either party was attacked without provocation due to a failure of the terms of the Locarno Treaties to be observed.

==Effects and evaluations ==

In November 1925 the German Reichstag approved the Locarno Treaties by a vote of 291 to 174 with 3 abstentions; in the British House of Commons, the vote to pass was 375 to 13. The treaties were formally signed in London on 1 December. In Germany the approval led to the collapse of the Luther government. The parties of the Right were angry over the loss of Alsace–Lorraine, while those on the Left feared that Germany could be drawn into a &quot;capitalist war&quot; against the Soviet Union.

Locarno contributed to the worsening of the atmosphere between Poland and France and weakened the Franco-Polish alliance. Since Germany did not commit to guarantees on its eastern borders, the Locarno Treaties were a defeat for Poland and one of the contributing factors to the fall of the Grabski cabinet on 14 November 1925. Józef Beck, at the time Poland&#x27;s military attaché to France, ridiculed the treaties, saying that &quot;Germany was officially asked to attack the east in return for peace in the west.&quot; Józef Piłsudski said that &quot;every honest Pole spits when he hears the word [Locarno]&quot;. Proposals in 1934 (after Adolf Hitler had become German chancellor) for an &quot;eastern Locarno&quot; pact securing Germany&#x27;s eastern frontiers foundered on German opposition and on Poland&#x27;s insistence that its eastern borders should be covered by a western guarantee.

Overall the Locarno Treaties marked a dramatic improvement in the political climate of western Europe from 1925 to 1930. They promoted expectations for continued peaceful settlements, often called the &quot;spirit of Locarno&quot;. As a result of the treaties, the delayed withdrawal of British troops from the Cologne region took place in January 1926, and Germany was accepted into the League of Nations with a permanent seat on the Council on 10 September 1926. In additional signs of the improved relations between Germany and the Allied powers, the Inter-Allied Commission overseeing Germany&#x27;s disarmament was disbanded in 1927, the Young Plan for settling reparations issues was signed in 1929, and the last of the occupying troops left the Rhineland in 1930, five years earlier than set by the Treaty of Versailles.

The Nobel Peace Prize was awarded to the lead negotiators of the treaty: Austen Chamberlain in 1925 and Aristide Briand and Gustav Stresemann jointly in 1926.

Historian Sally Marks wrote in her 1976 book &quot;The Illusion of Peace&quot;:Henceforth the spirit of Locarno would reign, substituting conciliation for enforcement as the basis for peace. Yet for some peace remained a desperate hope rather than an actuality. A few men knew that the spirit of Locarno was a fragile foundation on which to build a lasting peace.Hans Mommsen, in &quot;The Rise and Fall of Weimar Democracy&quot;, summed up the Locarno Treaties in the following words:The &quot;Spirit of Locarno&quot; as a symbol for a new era of international understanding and commitment to avoid European military conflict, however, concealed a tenacious struggle over the interests of national states in which Stresemann, unlike Aristide Briand, showed no inclination whatsoever to make generous concessions. The memorable words of the French premier that Locarno marked &quot;the beginning of an era of trust&quot; never became reality. … In Stresemann&#x27;s verdict, Locarno represented no more than a first step on the road to the &quot;gradual reacquisition of German sovereignty through a network of European treaties.&quot;
== End of the treaties ==
The Nazi regime under Adolf Hitler repudiated the Locarno Treaties when it sent troops across the Rhine on 7 March 1936. Hitler justified the remilitarization of the Rhineland and the breaking of both the Treaty of Versailles and of Locarno by citing Germany&#x27;s right to self-determination and the Franco-Soviet Treaty of Mutual Assistance of 2 May 1935, which he called a breach of the Locarno Treaties. There was no reaction from the signatories of the Locarno Treaties other than verbal condemnation. Italy had already promised not to act, and France did not have the support of Great Britain. Although the Locarno Treaties remained technically in force, the German remilitarization of the Rhineland and the lack of response to it marked their practical end.

<doc id="266938" wikidata="Q13727" url="?curid=266938" title="Antique (province)">
<text>Antique (), officially the Province of Antique, is a province in the Philippines located in the Western Visayas region. Its capital and most populous town is San Jose de Buenavista. The province is situated in the western section of Panay Island and borders Aklan, Capiz, and Iloilo to the east, while facing the Sulu Sea to the west.

The province is home to the indigenous Iraynun-Bukidnon, speakers of a dialect of the Kinaray-a language, who have crafted the only rice terrace clusters in the Visayas through indigenous knowledge and sheer vernacular capabilities. The rice terraces of the Iraynun-Bukidnon are divided into four terraced fields, namely, General Fullon rice terraces, Lublub rice terraces, Bakiang rice terraces, and San Agustin rice terraces. All of the rice terrace clusters have been researched by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts and various scholars from the University of the Philippines. There have been campaigns to nominate the Iraynun-Bukidnon Rice Terraces, along with the Central Panay Mountain Range, into the UNESCO World Heritage List.

==Etymology==
Antique was one of the three (districts) of Panay before Spanish colonizers arrived on the islands. The province was known at that time as &quot;Hantík&quot;, the local name for the large black ants found on the island. The Spanish , influenced by the French, recorded the region&#x27;s name as &quot;Hantique&quot; (with the silent &#x27;h&#x27;), but this was only adopted in areas near Malandog River in present Hamtic town which then became the provincial capital (shortly before Bugason and San Jose). The province bearing its former capital&#x27;s name is spelled and pronounced as &quot;Antique&quot; (än-ti-ké), without &#x27;h&#x27; and pronounced in (Kinaray-a) dialectic way.

== History ==
=== Early history ===

Historians believe that the earliest people who settled on the island of Panay were tribal Negritos or Atis. Oral history, relayed as the &quot;Maragtas&quot;, states that ten &quot;datus&quot; or minor tribal Malay chieftains escaped persecution from a city called Odtohan from Borneo due to a tyrant ruler called Makatunaw. The ten datus, led by Datu Puti, sailed northward with their families and communities, landing on Panay after departing Borneo. There are claims that the narrative of the Maragtas is dated to 1200 to fit with the transition of the Srivijayan Empire to Majapahit but there is no written evidence about this, nor there are any existing claims that links the datus to Borneo. Nevertheless, the Maragtas narrative is to be considered as part of the local history of the people.

According to the Maragtas, the Bornean datus upon arrival met with the Ati chieftain Datu Marikudo and his wife Maniwantiwan. They offered the chieftain a salakot (wide-brimmed hat) (believed to be of pure gold by present-day locals) as well as a golden necklace, earrings, bracelets and trinkets they wore when they fled Borneo. The gifts also include pearls and fine clothes as a show of respect to the indigenous people. Datu Marikudo responded to the datus&#x27; generosity by giving them the lowlands and moving to the mountains with his Ati tribe as the mountains are sacred to them. The legendary arrival of Bornean boats at the shores of Antique is commemorated annually in the Binirayan festival.

The island of Panay was then divided into three : Hantik, Akean and Irong-Irong. Irong-Irong became Iloilo, Akean became the present-day Aklan and Capiz, and Hantik (also called Hamtik or Hamtic) became Antique. Hantik was named for the large black ants found on the island called &quot;hantik-hantik&quot;.

=== Spanish colonial era ===
During the Spanish colonial period, the coastal province was vulnerable to attacks by Moro raiders. Under the direction of the Spanish friars, a series of watchtowers, like the &#x27;Old Watchtower&#x27; in Libertad and Estaca Hill in Bugasong, were built to guard Antique.

In 1790, Antique was converted into a politico-military province with the town of Antique (now Hamtic) as its first capital. The provincial seat of government was later transferred to Bugasón (old name of Bugasong), and finally to San Jose de Buenavista. By the end of the 1700s, Antique had 9,228 families.

=== Japanese occupation ===
In 1942, the Imperial Japanese Army landed in Antique and occupied the province during the Second World War.

During the Japanese Insurgencies and Occupation (1942–1944), the military general headquarters and camp bases of the 6th and 62nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army was active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the military general headquarters and camp bases of the 6th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was re-activated between October 28, 1944, and June 30, 1946. Additionally, during the implementation of the anti-imperial Japanese military operations on Panay Island between 1942 and 1945 in the Antique province, Filipino military forces aided the local guerrilla resistance against the Imperial Japanese Army.

Between 1944 and 1945, Philippine Commonwealth forces of the 6th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary and the 6th and 62nd Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army defeated the Japanese troops and liberated the province. The liberation was achieved with the active support of recognized local guerrillas.

=== Philippine independence ===
==== During the Marcos dictatorship ====

One of the significant events of the Philippines&#x27;s Martial Law era was the Bacong Bridge Massacre, which took place in the town of Culasi, Antique on December 19, 1981. Sometimes also known as the Culasi incident, it involved the Philippine Constabulary killing 5 protester-farmers at the Bacong River bridge in Culasi&#x27;s Barangay Malacañang. The victims were identified as Leopoldo A. Anos, Aquilino M. Castillo, Fortunato M. Dalisay, Remegildo P. Dalisay, and Joel B. Plaquino, and were later honored at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani, which recognizes the heroes and martyrs who fought the authoritarian regime.

===Contemporary===
In 2014, the first ever Philippine rice terraces found outside the Cordilleras was discovered in Antique through satellite and a team of scientists and locals. The heritage site, known as the Antique Rice Terraces of the Panay-Bukidnon people, is believed to be at least 200 years old. In 2017, the province hosted the Palarong Pambansa for the very first time.

==Geography==

Antique is one of the six provinces comprising Western Visayas or Region VI, and one of the four provinces on the island of Panay.

The province, with a total land area of , is an elongated stretch of land occupying the entire western side of the island. It is bounded by the rugged central mountains of Panay, bordering on the provinces of Aklan in the northeast, Capiz on the east, Iloilo in the southeast and the Sulu Sea on the west. Its westernmost and northernmost point is Semirara Island at , while its eastern tip is approximately . Anini-y is the province&#x27;s most southerly point at . Resembling a seahorse in shape, it is long and at its widest point.

===Physical Features===

Antique has rugged and varied land. Nogas Island, Hurao-Hurao Island and Mararison Island have long stretches of white sand beaches that are ideal for shell-hunting. Batbatan Island on the other hand, appeals to scuba divers because of the well-preserved coral reefs.

Mount Madja-as is located in Culasi, is the highest peak on the island of Panay. This mountain is a dormant volcano with lakes and 14 waterfalls.

<doc id="266939" wikidata="Q472728" url="?curid=266939" title="Ibn Warraq">
<text>Ibn Warraq (born 1946) is the pen name of an anonymous author critical of Islam. He is the founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic Society and used to be a senior research fellow at the Center for Inquiry, focusing on Quranic criticism. Warraq is the vice-president of the World Encounter Institute.

Warraq has written historiographies of the early centuries of the Islamic timeline and has published works which question mainstream conceptions of the period. The pen name Ibn Warraq (, most literally &quot;son of a papermaker&quot;) is used due to his concerns for his personal safety; Warraq stated, &quot;I was afraid of becoming the second Salman Rushdie.&quot; It is a name that has been adopted by dissident authors throughout the history of Islam. The name refers to the 9th-century skeptical scholar Abu Isa al-Warraq. Warraq adopted the pseudonym in 1995 when he completed his first book, entitled &quot;Why I Am Not a Muslim&quot;.

He is the editor of several books, also including &quot;The Origins of the Koran&quot; (1998), &quot;The Quest for the Historical Muhammad&quot; (2000), &quot;What the Koran Really Says&quot; (2002) and the writer/editor &quot;Leaving Islam&quot; (2003). He is a controverisal figure among his contemporaries as many academic specialists in Islamic history consider him to be polemical, overly revisionist and lacking in expertise.

==Early life and education==
Warraq claims to have been born in Rajkot, Gujarat in British India and his family migrated to the newly independent Pakistan in 1947. His family were of Kutchi origin. Although born in India, he held a Pakistani passport.

His mother died when he was an infant. He stated in an interview that he &quot;studied Arabic and read the Qur&#x27;an as a young man in hopes of becoming a follower of the Islamic faith.&quot; His father decided to send him to a boarding school in England, which in Warraq&#x27;s opinion, was partly to circumvent a grandmother&#x27;s effort to push an exclusively religious education on his son at the local madrasa. After his arrival in Britain, he only saw his father once more, when he was 14; his father died two years later. At 18, he took part in the Bridge in Britain exchange in Israel, working on a kibbutz for six months. He had no idea that Pakistan had no relations with Israel and the scholarship embarrassed his father. He enjoyed the experience greatly. It also made him more aware of being from a Muslim background, as he met people of different religions in Israel.

By 19, he had moved to Scotland to pursue his education at the University of Edinburgh, where he studied philosophy and Arabic with Islamic studies scholar W. Montgomery Watt.

After graduating, Warraq was a primary school teacher in London for five years and moved to France with his wife in 1982, opening an Indian restaurant. He also worked as a courier for a travel agent. Warraq claims to have been &quot;shy&quot; for most of his youth.

==Career==

Warraq claims to have been induced into writing against Islam due to the inclination of Western intellectuals in blaming Rushdie during the &quot;Satanic Verses&quot; controversy. He noticed a lack of anti-Islam tracts in &quot;Free Inquiry&quot;, an American secular humanist publication, and wrote on topics such as &quot;Why I am not Muslim.&quot; Warraq claims to have been hosted by David Frum, speech-writer of George W. Bush at the White House shortly after the 9/11; Frum maintains silence. In March 2006, he co-signed in response to violent protests in the Islamic world surrounding the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy, declaring Islam as a totalitarian regime.

In October 2007, Warraq participated in an Intelligence Squared debate, &quot;We Should Not Be Reluctant to Assert the Superiority of Western Values,&quot; in London. He argued in favor of the motion; arguing on the same side as him were Douglas Murray and David Aaronovitch, while their opponents were Tariq Ramadan, William Dalrymple, and Charles Glass. Although he does not subscribe to any particular religion, he has a higher opinion of humanism than of Islam and has described himself as an atheist. He is the founder of the Institute for the Secularisation of Islamic Society (ISIS). He has also been on the advisory board of the International Free Press Society, and been associated with the counter-jihad movement.

==Books and reception==
Ibn Warraq continued writing with several works examining the historiography of the Qur&#x27;an and Muhammad. Other books treated the topic of secular humanist values among Muslims. In &quot;The Origins of The Koran: Classic Essays on Islam&#x27;s Holy Book&quot;, Ibn Warraq includes some of Theodor Nöldeke&#x27;s studies. In 2005, Warraq spent several months working with Christoph Luxenberg, who wrote about Syriac vs. Arabic interpretation of Quranic verse.

A pattern in Warraq&#x27;s work is paying homage to earlier scholarly works on Christianity by borrowing their titles and applying them to Islam: &quot;Why I Am Not a Muslim&quot; is taken from Bertrand Russell&#x27;s &quot;Why I Am Not a Christian&quot; (1927), &quot;The Quest for the Historical Muhammad&quot; is taken from Albert Schweitzer&#x27;s &quot;The Quest of the Historical Jesus&quot; (1910), and &quot;What the Koran Really Says&quot; is taken from German author Manfred Barthel&#x27;s &quot;Was wirklich in der Bibel steht&quot; (&quot;What the Bible Really Says&quot;, 1980).

===Praise===
In a 1996 review of &quot;Why I Am Not a Muslim&quot;, Daniel Pipes wrote that &quot;With few exceptions, he [Warraq] relies almost entirely on the Western tradition of Islamic studies&quot; but concluded that &quot;Despite his anger, &#x27;Ibn Warraq&#x27; has written a serious and thought-provoking book&quot; calling for &quot;an equally compelling response from a believing Muslim.&quot; Pipes also described &quot;Why I am not a Muslim&quot; (1995) as &quot;well-researched and quite brilliant.&quot; David Pryce-Jones said that it was &quot;a scrupulously documented examination of the life and teaching of the Prophet Muhammad, of the Qur&#x27;an and its sources, and the resulting culture.&quot; Christopher Hitchens described &quot;Why I Am Not a Muslim&quot; as his &quot;favorite book on Islam.&quot;

In 2007, Douglas Murray described Ibn Warraq as: 

In a 2008 review of Ibn Warraq&#x27;s book, &quot;Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said&#x27;s Orientalism&quot;, political scientist Peter Berkowitz described Warraq as a &quot;worthy critic&quot; for Edward Said. Berkowitz said that &quot;with a rare combination of polemical zest and prodigious learning, it [&quot;Defending the West&quot;] is the first [book-length critique] to address and refute Said&#x27;s arguments &#x27;against the background of a more general presentation of salient aspects of Western civilization.&#x27;&quot; In a 2009 review of &quot;Defending the West&quot; A. J. Caschetta concluded that &quot;Ibn Warraq&#x27;s critique of Said&#x27;s thought and work is thorough and convincing, indeed devastating to anyone depending on Saidism. It should do to &quot;Orientalism&quot; what Mary Lefkowitz&#x27;s &quot;Not Out of Africa&quot; did to Martin Bernal&#x27;s &quot;Black Athena&quot;.&quot; Pryce-Jones said that it &quot;demolishes in close detail the Saidian &#x27;narrative.&#x27;&quot;

In a 2012 review of Ibn Warraq&#x27;s book, &quot;Virgins? What Virgins&quot;, Rice University historian of Islam David Cook wrote: &quot;As a scholar of Islam myself, I find Ibn Warraq&#x27;s attitude to be very refreshing, and his scholarship for the most part to be accurate and devastating in pinpointing the weaknesses in Muslim orthodoxy.&quot; The book&#x27;s third essay, Cook continues, &quot;could almost serve as a history of our field, and of its systematic failure to critique the foundational texts of Islam as those of other faiths have been critiqued.&quot;

===Criticism===
In reviewing Ibn Warraq&#x27;s compilation &quot;The Origins of the Koran,&quot; religious studies professor Herbert Berg has labelled him as &quot;polemical and inconsistent&quot; in his writing. Berg lauded the inclusion of the essay by Theodor Nöldeke, but panned the inclusion of William St. Clair Tisdall&#x27;s as &quot;not a particularly scholarly essay&quot;. He concluded &quot;[i]t seems that Ibn Warraq has included some of the essays not on the basis of their scholarly value or their status as &#x27;classics&#x27;, but rather on the basis of their hostility to Islam. This does not necessarily diminish the value of the collection, but the reader should be aware that this collection does not fully represent classic scholarship on the Quran.&quot;

In reviewing Ibn Warraq&#x27;s essay in his &quot;Quest for the Historical Muhammad&quot; (2001) Fred Donner, a professor in Near Eastern studies, notes his lack of specialist training in Arabic studies, citing &quot;inconsistent handling of Arabic materials,&quot; and unoriginal arguments, and &quot;heavy-handed favoritism&quot; towards revisionist theories and &quot;the compiler&#x27;s [i.e. Ibn Warraq&#x27;s] agenda, which is not scholarship, but anti-Islamic polemic.&quot; Anthropologist and historian Daniel Martin Varisco has criticized Ibn Warraq&#x27;s book &quot;Defending the West: A Critique of Edward Said&#x27;s Orientalism&quot;, writing that &quot;This modern son of a bookseller imprints a polemical farce not worth the 500-plus pages of paper it wastes.&quot;

His work, &quot;The Origins of the Koran&quot;, is itself based on a polemic by St. Clair Tisdall &quot;The original sources of the Qur&#x27;an&quot; which was described by François de Blois as a &quot;decidedly shoddy piece of missionary propaganda&quot;.

François de Blois in reviewing &quot;The Origins of the Koran&quot;, states that &quot;it is surprising that the editor, who in his &quot;Why I am not a Muslim&quot; took a very high posture as a critical rationalist and opponent of all forms of obscurantism, now relies so heavily on writings by Christian polemicists from the nineteenth century&quot;. Asma Afsaruddin states that &quot;Ibn Warraq is not interested in debate; he wants nothing less than wholesale conversion to his point of view within the community of scholars of Islam&quot; and added that his work, &quot;The Origins of the Koran&quot;, &quot;needlessly poisons the atmosphere and stymies efforts to engage in honest scholarly discussion&quot;.

<text>Capiz (), officially the Province of Capiz (Capiznon/Hiligaynon: &quot;Kapuoran sang Capiz&quot;; ), is a province in the Philippines located in the central section of Western Visayas region. Its capital is the city of Roxas, which is the most populous. It is located at the northeastern portion of Panay Island, bordering Aklan to the north, Antique to the west, and Iloilo to the south. Capiz faces the Sibuyan Sea to the north.

Capiz is known for the &quot;Placuna placenta&quot; oyster shell that has the same name locally and is used for decoration and making lampshades, trays, doors and capiz-shell windows. Likewise, the province is known as the &quot;Seafood Capital of the Philippines&quot; and was among the top 15 most frequently visited places in the Philippines. Capiz is the site of the famous coral-stone Santa Mónica Church in the town of Panay, home to the largest Catholic Church bell in Asia. The bell was made from 70 sacks of gold and silver coins donated by the townsfolk. Measuring seven feet in diameter, five feet in height and weighing 10,400 kilograms or just over 10 metric tons, the Panay bell is popular among tourists visiting Capiz.

== History ==
===Spanish colonial era===
The account of early Spanish explorers about Capiz and its people was traced back in 1566 when the Spaniards set foot in the mouth of Banica river.

Early settlements were seen in the town of Panay. The town was originally called Bamban. The name was changed by the early Spaniards to Panay, a word which means &quot;mouth of the river.&quot; This is also the location of a fortress built by Juan de la Isla in late 1570. The Paseo de Evangelización 1566 can be found in the town plaza and was erected through the efforts of Rev. Msgr. Benjamin F. Advíncula.

When the Spaniards led by Miguel López de Legazpi came to Panay from Cebu in 1569, after sailing from Mexico, they found people with tattoos, and so they called the island &quot;Isla de los Pintados&quot;.

How the island itself came to be called Panay is uncertain. The Aeta (Negritos) called it Aninipay, after a plant that abounded in the island. Legend has it that López de Legazpi and his men, in search of food, exclaimed upon the island, &quot;pan hay en esta isla&quot;! &quot;There is bread in this island&quot;! and the island of Panay closely resembles the shape of a heart and the heart of Jesus Christ is considered present in the Eucharistic Bread. The Spanish then came and established their first settlement on the island at the mouth of the Banica River and called it Panay. This was the second Spanish settlement in the Philippines, following San Miguel, Cebu. Unknown to many, Calle Revolución in Panay is the second oldest street in the Philippines after Calle Colón in Cebu City, Central Visayas.

Later in 1569, Captain Diego de Artieda, who was sent by López de Legazpi, landed in the town of Panay and proclaimed it as the capital of the province. Later, the Spaniards moved the capital to its present site upon founding the town of Capiz (not the province, and now Roxas City) which was near the sea and provided docking facilities.

In 1716, the province was created a separate &quot;encomienda&quot; and was later organized into a politico-military unit. By the end of the 1700s, Capiz had 11,459 native families and 89 Spanish Filipino families.

Although Capiz joined the Tagalog-led Philippine Revolution, the Spaniards didn&#x27;t surrender to the Tagalogs but they did surrender to the people of Iloilo and eventually Iloilo and Capiz were part of the same Federal Republic of the Visayas a substate which was formed within the First Philippine Republic, the first capital of which was in Cavite while the United States of America had betrayed the Philippine Revolution which they initially supported and influential American officers swore allegiance to. These American officers betrayed their oaths and occupied Manila.
